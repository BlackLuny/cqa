P35Cctq2aa	Yes labor acording to your question will be soon. My 1st child was 2 wks early I was 3cm when I went in, and had been for a month. you should be going in to labor in the next few days. if you really want to go in to labor just have sex. I had to quit having sex b/c it was causing me to dilate earlier then normal. There is a chemical in siemen that causes women to dilate. Ever had cramps after sex? Well, that is why. when I was ready to have my kid I just had sex and he didn't pull out. try that and see what happens, if you haven't started labor by the time you read this...... Good luck and congradulations!|`|2842e23df90fbee0e32380e1af7d286baa	Well I was gonna say no girl but if its your second baby then I bet it won't be more than a couple of days!!  Good luck!!|`|WuVHoL4Paa	from experience you can be dialated for a while like that but my boys were also born early still|`|23e6287b78d1587e57b2d262f45629b1aa	It shouldn't be long at all now.  I was due to be induced Nov 1st and went in only to be sent home that night because I wasn't dialated at all. (2nd baby). Later that night, I took a shower and ended up in Labor and Delivery. I had started natural labor and my son was born the next day. <br>  <br>   With a second baby, anything can happen. It can take hours, it can take minutes, but rest assured, it will be very soon.|`|OOYHJAcfaa	That's the weird thing about labor. I was 80% and 2 cm when I was like 8 months pregnant and had the baby at full term! There is just no way of know for sure and your doctor will tell you that. But you are getting close anyway being 39 wks the longest you'll have to wait is 2 weeks after the due date because then they'd induce you.|`|jx0wnNs6aa	Get out that raspberry tea and have a quick stroll around the block. My best friend is 39 weeks and 3 days today and not dialated! Good luck!!!|`|67a9a1a0a07127c002c465e1db642cbcaa	It is probably well on it's way. If you are already 3 cm dialated. I would say probably a week - give or take. I wish you good luck on your delivery. I wish the sibling good luck too. I am sure they will be happy to have a playmate.|`|WWboIqCHaa	When I had my son. I kept feeling pressure so I went to the doctor. I didn't have any pain. I went to the doctor and I was 6 cm and fully effaced. They rushed me into the hospital. I had no idea I was in labor. lol. My labor was good compared to some others. You can expect to have your little one pretty soon. Congrats.

Ich bitte dich!! <br>  die frage is so gestellt absoluter schwachsinn! ich hoffe, das war eindeutig genug!|`|d8a4b98587dc0e6bc7c8b11f7f5f5045aa	Am besten jeden zweiten Tag einmal.|`|8daa21b3ef73a69926a3ad458aebec0daa	Da es nicht wirklich einfach ist, den exakten Termin des Eisprungs zu errechnen, sollte man sich besser an der Faustregel orientieren, dass die fruchtbarste Zeitspanne in einem 28-Tage-Zyklus zwischen dem 11. und 15. Tag liegt. Schwieriger mit der Berechnung wird es allerdings bereits, wenn der pers?nliche Zyklus nicht genau 28 Tagen entspricht. Für diesen Fall und für alle die es etwas einfacher m?gen gibt’s folgende Seite<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gyn.de/kinderwunsch/eisprungtermin.php3" rel="nofollow">http://www.gyn.de/kinderwunsch/eisprungt...</a><br>  <br>  Genussmittel wie Alkohol und Zigaretten wirken sich ungünstig auf die Fruchtbarkeit aus und k?nnen für die Entwicklung eines Kindes katastrophale Folgen haben. Kaffee und schwarzer Tee sollten nur in Ma?en genossen werden: Schon mehr als drei Tassen t?glich besitzen einen negativen Einfluss auf die Fruchtbarkeit. W?hrend der Schwangerschaft erh?ht exzessiver Kaffee- oder Teekonsum das Risiko einer Fehl-, Früh - oder Totgeburt. Das Spurenelement Zink ist am Aufbau von Sexualhormonen beteiligt und beeinflusst die Fruchtbarkeit. Bei Frauen führt Zinkmangel zu Zyklusst?rungen, und die Chancen für eine Empf?ngnis sinken. Sind M?nner schlecht mit Zink versorgt, werden nicht genug Testosteron und Spermien produziert. EineVielzahl von Studien hat gezeigt, dass Zink in solchen F?llen den Hormonspiegel wieder ansteigen l?sst, die Potenz verbessert und schlie?lich auch die Zahl der Spermien erh?ht.

eBnxR9F6aa	ton enfant de 6 ans ne veux plus t'obe?r, du coup tu cris dessus...j'ai connue cette situation y'a maintenant quelques annees avec ma fille qui avait aussi 6 ans et son ptit frere 1 an. J'ai mis du temps a comprendre qu'elle se "rebellé" de mon autorité pour me faire reagir, me montrer qu'elle etait la et qu'il n'y avait pas que son ptit frere. <br>  Je pense qu'il faut que tu arrete de crier dessus ca n'apportera rien sauf de l'enervement pour tout le monde. Parle lui trankillement, fait des choses qu'avec lui, montre lui que tu l'aime. Fait des choses que tu peux faire qu' avec lui et montre lui qu'il est grand par rapport a son ptit frere. Demande lui ce qui ne va pas ? est ce qu'il trouve que tu ne t'occupe pas assez de lui? mais montre lui aussi que quand c'est non c'est non! soit ferme mais pas de crie, pas de fessé, pas de mot mechant a propos de lui (il est chiant, etc..) je pense qu'il a peur, peur de te perdre toi sa maman, peur de ne pas trouver sa place dans la famille, et peur peut etre aussi des changements du a l'ecole etc... soit attentive et reste le plus calme possible sinon cela deviendra creichendo!!! et vous en serait malheureux tous les deux. biz bon courage.

FMNLm2ipaa	allora due negativi e due positivi non hanno problemi. i problemi nascono con la donna neg e l uomo positivo (come nel mio caso). e il problema non si pone alla prima gravidanza (che il bimbo prende poi il gruppo negativo come la madre) ma in quelle future. x il nostro corpo percepisce la gravidanza come corpo estraneo e attiva gli anticorpi che creano un aborto. pero intorno al sesto/ settimo mese e al momento del parto, viene fatta alla donna un′iniezione che inibisce la creazione di anticorpi per le future gravidanze|`|1f023db3e89570f0653cae6cb45b9862aa	Io ho l'Rh negativo, gruppo AB, e ho due figlie.

GvBSu0thaa	Secondo me dovresti comunque parlarne con i tuoi, avrai bisogno di loro e non mi pare giusto chiedere il loro aiuto nell'imminenza della nascita. Eventualmente ti potresti sposare così ti fai dichiarare emancipata...|`|Z2uQ6pklaa	Bhe, mi sembra logico che, a guardare nelle domande precedenti, tu sia molto confusa... Non dico che la mia risposta ti schierisca le idee, ma vorrei fosse così. L'articolo parla chiaro... Quella ragazza voleva avere il figlio, ma i genitori hanno rifiutato una decisione del genere da parte della figlia, hanno fatto bene? Io, personalmente, credo che Valentina ringrazierà i genitori di questa cosa... Insomma, a 13 anni non puoi cresciere un figlio, se un adolescente! Poi mi sono preoccupato leggendo la parte dell'articolo relativa alla legge... La legge parla chiarissimo, oserei dire... Sei minorenne, incinta, e chi deve prenderne atto sono i genitori. Tu lo vuoi tenere, ma la scelta più importante è quella dei genitori, quindi io dico che tu divresti dirlo ai tuoi... Insomma, messa come sei non hai molta scelta, chi lo sà, magari Dio farà il miracolo e terrete il bel pupetto! I miei migliori auguri! <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  X Diegosk: Non per niente Sara ha postato l'articolo di una ragazza di un anni in meno di lei per far vedere cosa significa!

Non so come la pensano i tuoi genitori, solo tu puoi sapere se loro sarebbero dall'idea di farti abortire, ma qualcosa ti dico: il tuo ragazzo, anche se fosse minore d'età, ha il 50% di responsabilitá. Non siamo più nei tempi nei quali alla donna si la lasciava da sola con una vita piena di umiliazioni perche "ragazza madre". Gli uomini devono prendersi le loro responsabilitá, perchè per fare un figlio CI VOGLIONO DUE!!! se lui è sato molto contento quando è andato al letto con te, deve far altretanto adesso che sei in cinta, e qualsiasi decisione ci sia da prendere, la dovete prendere tu e lui.

Lo hai dimenticato. <br>  <br>  Il tuo tipo ha 19 anni, e tu 14, quindi Lui é responsabile di stupro di minorenne (la legge non ti considera conseziente). Contribuendo a nascondere la tua gravidanza ai tuoi commette un altro reato. Se comunichi la cosa ai tuoi quando é troppo tardi per abortire, stai tranquilla che il minimo che gli può capitare é finire in galera per qualche anno (in questi casi la denuncia é obbligatoria, procede d'ufficio la polizia).<br>  <br>  Se pensi di imporre ai tuoi genitori il carico di un ulteriore figlio (il tuo), e continuare a vivere la tua vita da adolescente, sbagli. Il caso di cui hai letto sul giornale non é bello, ma non é colpa dei genitori se sono poveri. La legge per l'aborto é stata fatta anche per questo.<br>  Un mezzo che un tempo usavano molto le ragazze che, come te, restavano incinte a 14 anni, era la prostituzione. Possiamo dire che i bordelli erano pieni di ragazze madri. La legge sull'aborto ha eliminato quel fenomeno, infatti non ci sono più prostitute italiane minorenni.<br>  <br>  Rifletti attentamente. Essere madre significa essere realista.|`|ozmi8Upfaa	Anche se sei ancora piccina di età, è giusto che tu prenda le tue decisioni...se credi sia giusto così fai bene a non dirlo ai tuoi genitori!!!! però se pensi che loro possano capirti allora dillo perche loro ti potranno aiutare sicuramente....un piccolo consiglio è solo quello di pensare al bene del bimbo e quindi a cio che tu e il papà potete dargli!!!!

Si, lo avevo letto. E' bruttissimo e doloroso quello che ha passato quella ragazza. Ma credimi,  è sbagliato tenere nascosto ai tuoi che sei incinta.

Dove andrai a lavorare senza un diploma, se al giorno d'oggi nemmeno i laureati trovano lavoro? Con cosa manterrai sto bimbo?<br>  <br>  Se davvero vuoi tenerlo, cerca di convincere i tuoi genitori, perchè è più probabile che siano loro a fare da mamma e papà al bambino, piuttosto che te.<br>  <br>  Con questo ti faccio i miei migliori auguri, e non prendertela male, ma so cosa significa avere un figlio.. e ti posso garantire che non è semplice come sembra!|`|N1rdaUVEaa	Dovresti guardare solo il tuo caso e non farti condizionare da quello che succede in giro. Avere un bambino è un dono meraviglioso, ma guarda la realtà, non puoi affrontare questa situazione senza l'aiuto dei tuoi genitori. é' una cosa più grande di te, se decidi di tenerlo hai bisogno di tutta l'esperienza e il supporto che solo loro possono offrirti. Se hai già avuto la maturità di avere rapporti con il tuo ragazzo, allora dovresti mantenere questa maturità anche per le avversità assumendoti le tue responsabilità. Devi pensare al bambino e a quanto sei in grado di offrirgli senza l'aiuto dei tuoi genitori.

A7cZtZFyaa	My daughter just started sleeping in her own room. She is almost 4 months old. Like you said, it was much easier for me breastfeeding. In fact, my boyfriend asked me time and time again when she is going in her own room! Easy for him!!<br>  She wakes once for a feed now normally between 2am and 4am so I go get her from her room and I will sometimes just put her back down in the bassinet in my room.|`|AA11210211	We put both of our children in their own room when they were about 3 months give or take a few weeks.We had them in a bassinet in our room.As soon as they started to roll over we put them in their crib in their own room.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Personally I don't believe a child should be in their room until 2-4 years of age.<br>  <br>  However for SIDS prevention its recommended that you roomshare for at least 6 months and preferably 12 months.<br>  <br>  I think if you tried to make it work for a few weeks he'd learn to roll over and go back so sleep, or he's one of the dads that even the baby on a monitor keeps them up all night.|`|60HmdFZsaa	My husband and I kept our son in our room until he was ready for his own bed.  I guess we were afraid to live him alone.  The transition was easy.  He enjoyed having his own stuff, and his own toddler bed.  I guess my husband and I really wanted to keep an I on our son every night.  You know DIDS.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|ME62Mtv4aa	i did at around 3 3 1/2 months|`|AA10949064	I put my daughter in her crib at 6 weeks old.  Once she started sleeping 3 - 4 hour shifts, I knew it was time to transfer her from the pack n' play to the crib.  The very first night I put her in the crib, she slept from 12:00 - 5:00 which was much longer than in the pack n' play.  I have read that if you want to have an easy transition into the crib, it's best to get them in there by 3 months.  The longer you wait, the harder it is for both of you.<br>  <br>  The worst you can do is try it for one night on the weekend and see how it goes.  You might be surprised!  Each child is different - you just have to try and see how it goes.<br>  <br>  P.S. I use the Kiddopatamus SwaddleMe blankets - my daughter can not get out of them.  They are the best thing ever invented.  You can get them at Babies R'Us, Burlington Coat Factory, Target, etc.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|yCwPxulYaa	My daughter went into her own room at 4 1/2 months. We co-slept before that and because noone was getting any sleep (my daughter was waking 4-5 times a night, or more), we decided to try her in her own bed.  The first night in her crib, she only woke up twice.  Now after about 6 weeks in her crib, she is FINALLY sleeping through the night 9-10 hours. <br>  <br>  You will know when you are ready.  <br>  She is 6 months old.|`|nwWBddEnaa	the only way i would settle was with my daughter in her own room, she slept better aswel and if your worried about her getting cold they have them fleecy onesies that go over the normal sleep suit, that's what we did because our daughter kept getting tangled lol, i wish you all the best x|`|f15fae9678a173ccb0d1f8132c549bedaa	We are about to put our baby girl who is 14 months into her own bedroom.

We are going to start sleeping her in her own room this weekend. I think this will help with the amount of sleep that we are all getting! A lot of the times I here her moving in her crib and think she needs something when she's really just repositioning. I think with her being in her own room I'll only wake up when I hear her crying over the monitor. <br>  <br>  The reason why people say 6 months is because for the first 6 months is when your child is at the highest risk for SIDS. But as long as you are sleeping them correctly there shouldn't be any problems. Just remember no bumpers and nothing at all in the crib besides the baby.This includes no blankets!! :-)|`|C8wg1uyhaa	My sone is going into his own room when we get a move in a couple of weeks and he is nearly a year.I think it depends on the child really.I know people who kids go into their own room at bout 4 months and others whose kids are 2 years old and still sleep in their parents bedrooms.As long as they are sleeping right thru the night then i think it should be ok for them to go into their own room.|`|HIRYscJlaa	I was breastfeeding too and my son slept in his own room in his own crib from the day he came home...since it was just across the hall I didn't see the difference in whether or not he was beside me.

I recommend whatever is easiest.  I breastfed, but preferred to sit in the rocking chair vice nurse in bed, so I switched my baby to the crib by about 3 weeks old.<br>  <br>  Could your partner just go back to sleeping in the bed with you?  My husband did the whole time, on a queen sized bed.<br>  <br>  You could set up a dim light in the nursery and a low table and read aloud while you nurse.  I looked forward to the night feedings after I started reading during them.  It doesn't matter much what you read.  Baby listens to your voice.<br>  <br>  It isn't much different baby being in a separate bed in your room or in their own room with a monitor.<br>  <br>  You can get baby beds that butt up against the parent's bed if that is what you prefer.
uSsmriwWaa	I got that diagnoses at 17 weeks. I was in the ER for dehydration after throwing up like crazy. The ER doctor said it's a condition when you have very bad "morning sickness" and it lasts into the second trimester. There are no tests to do. It's more of a label they give you. As long as you stay hydrated, you'll be fine. I stopped throwing up around 18 weeks and then it came back at 31 weeks. I had a perfectly healthy baby boy. He was almost 9 lbs., so he didn't suffer from it. It's nothing that's going to harm your baby. Feel better!|`|AA10689692	If you had hyperemesis, you wouldn't be that far along and just now going to the doctor for it.  The nausea/vomiting starts at around 3 weeks or so and you are not able to keep anything down at all and are usually hospitalized several times if you actually have hyperemesis, and not just regular morning sickness.  For me, I was in the hospital about five times from it and had to get a central line put in my arm twice so I would not get dehydrated and to deliver medication.  And that's just the start of it, it was an absolute nightmare and miserable experience!|`|ZVqEDvZSaa	<br>  Hyperemesis gravidarum may develop rapidly within a few weeks or gradually over a few months. Individuals with hyperemesis gravidarum experience severe and persistent nausea and vomiting that occur before the 20th week of pregnancy (gestation) and are severe enough to result in progressive weight loss of greater than five percent of their original body weight. In addition, frequent vomiting may also lead to dehydration and vitamin and mineral deficit. Hyperemesis gravidarum often leads to hospitalization to restore lost fluids and nutrients to affected women.<br>  <br>  Check out the site..it has a lot of helpful information.<br>  <br>  <br>  Goodluck|`|XGd21yjSaa	Weight loss of more than 5% of your pre-pregnancy weight, malnutrition, vomiting that interference with normal activities, and excessive production of ketone bodies (byproducts that burn fatty acids in the liver and kidneys for energy when your body is not receiving enough carbs), and dehydration are indications of hypermesis. If you haven't lost weight, you probably do not have it.<br>  <br>  I was diagnosed at 16 weeks. I would throw up 10+ times a day. I lost 13 pounds within my first trimester and I was hospitalized multiple times with an IV.  It was miserable. There is no treatment for hypermesis, except for anti nausea medication.

vue9NOhYaa	Because we live in a society where formula is 'the norm' and breastfeeding is something 'nice' -- if you really want to do it.  So most mothers who have trouble DO quit ... and those who stick with it are proud of themselves for not succumbing to the societal standard of 'formula is really just as good.'|`|CVdcrY3kaa	I'm suprised and proud of myself.

Some feel like they've been through a very difficult situation and to come out of that victorious is something to be proud of. <br>  <br>  Everybody does manage to feed their baby; if they didn't they would die f4rom malnutrition  Quit with all the judgmental self righteous BS about breast feeding.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	I'm really sick of people treating my with awe and calling me supermom because I'm *still* nursing my 3 year old and I nursed during pregnancy.<br>  <br>  And no, when you prepare formula PROPERLY (which many parents do not) it is not easier than breastfeeding.  Though I will say that if you have to pump and work its probably a bit more work to breastfeed and pump.  <br>  <br>  Exclusive pumping is a LOT of work, and women that exclusively pump because they have to deserve respect, as do women that pump milk for breast banks as well as nurse their own.|`|ec20340954300949b5d60c056689dd33aa	oh you're askin for it here...lol<br>  <br>  It's easier to have someone else feed the baby..like the father and keep doing what you were doing,yes. <br>  I breastfed my daughter for 6mths. Then she was formula fed after that. My son is 7 weeks and still exclusively breastfed. I love breastfeeding but sometimes I just want to take a shower without having to rush because the baby will be hungry or be able to go somewhere with friends without making sure I have enough pumped for the hubby. I can see why some people switch...but I am a firm believer in "breast is best"|`|vOomJtbsaa	You spend soooo much time on Y!A slamming formula feeding Moms and asking these preposterous questions.  I highly doubt you even have a child, let alone have enough time to sit around breastfeeding it.  Get a life Fagina! <br>  Once again, its none of your business how other ladies choose to feed their children or what they do or don't do with their breasts!|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	they are just proud- i am surprised because i said i would for 6 months and here is am still nursing at almost 23 months|`|nKXTjqQWaa	What are you going to say to your daughter when she says "Mom, I'm not planning on breastfeeding my child"|`|B5MDTdtPaa	i applaud women for breastfeeding for a long time i really do...i really could not cope breastfeeding it was so much harder for me than formula feeding...i really wanted to breastfeed but i did it for about 10 days (wich felt like a month!) and she wouldnt sleep longer than 1,1/2 hours without needing a feed so i didnt sleep for more than 1, 1/4 hours at a time, i was getting so depressed due to excessive sleep deprivation..as soon as i switched to formula she slept 3-4 hours a time and i then could have sleep and my post partum lifted and i was able to cope bringing up my daughter..we are so happy now, but those 10 days were the worst of my life, i seriously could not cope if i had carried on i could have gotten seriously depressed i cried constantly everyday i breastfed saying how i couldnt cope it was horrible, i believe try your very best at it but at then end of the day whatever works best for you and your baby..i wanted to stop after 3 days but i struggled thorugh the 10days as i wanted the best for my child until i literally got v depressed it was a big concern and my entire family worried as i was ringing them in tears saying how i want to sleep and i cant cope and i was referred with post partum..formula saved us so to speak..|`|t9S0dqfLaa	I'm proud that I was able to breast feed as long as I could because it was the hardest thing I ever went through, I never became engorged my son was never able to latch on and we went to several lactation consultants.  I was constantly hooked to an industrial sized rented pump from the hospital and was able to pump a whopping 1 oz per breast in an hour. After 2 months of this crap I quit because my son wasn't happy and I wasn't happy, we switched to formula and it wasn't until then that I realized that all this trying to breast feed took so much time away from mothering my baby and now I'm very happy I gave up.  You're able to breast feed your baby.  Yea for you, does it really matter?  Nope.|`|rAD0mL7Saa	Well, I couldn't feed my boy sufficiently, and neither could bottles at first and he kept losing weight until I put him on solids. Whenever I talked to anyone about it it seems like no-one could feed their child adequetely. And I spent 20 hours a day feeding with correct attachment and I was eathing a lot of food, avoiding basil, adding oil to my food, drinking loads of water. You name it I did it. And a lot of people said they had the same thing, although none of them spent anywhere near as long trying as I did. As I said, even formula wasn't nourishing him and he was getting underweight. But I found breastfeeding a lot more convenient even though he was pretty permanently attached to my nipples. I had a sling so I could walk around feeding him with everything hidden, and no-one even realised I was feeding him. people actually came up to me and pulled the sling back to see him before they realised (yes people do that without any warning or asking) I was feeding him. For a while while both my children were using bottles I was on a perpetual bottle hunt as my daughter was walking and it all came back just how long it takes to wash/sterilise etc the bottles.|`|yCwPxulYaa	Breastfeeding has been the hardest thing I have ever done.  Not everyone has an easy time breastfeeding.  I had latching problems at the beginning, poor weight gain, my milk almost dried up because I have hyperthyriodism, and my baby has had 3-4 nursing strikes where she wouldn't eat for days.  So yes, I am very surpised we have made it this long.  She is 6 months old and has never had a bottle.  I am sure formula feeding would have been easier. Sometimes I wish I would of just formula fed her.  But I am glad (and surprised) that we have been able to stick it out.  <br>  <br>  Not everyone CAN manage to breastfeed.  I know at any second, my thyroid could go out of wack and my milk dry up.  It has almost happened before and my baby quit gaining weight and having wet diapers.  So if I had to, my baby would get formula and I have NO problem with that.<br>  <br>  Oh and I have also had mastitis 3 times with 104 fevers.|`|QmTCMZtgaa	You may not be taking into consideration that we live in a society where it's not as easy as it should be to breastfeed.  Those who do manage to do it, even for a short time, are proud of it because it is an accomplishment.  <br>  <br>  Our culture is very fast-paced and not exactly breastfeeding friendly. Many moms have to work full-time and must return to their jobs very soon after giving birth (we don't have adequate work leave policies in the US), making it very impractical to nurse or pump (have you ever tried keeping up a pumping schedule while planning meetings and deadlines?). <br>  <br>  Formula is "pushed" on expectant mothers from the time they first see a doctor about pregnancy.  Free cans of it are sent to expectant moms as soon as the pregnancy becomes public information.  After giving birth, many hospitals will again push formula as the best option if nursing isn't going exactly as it should.  Some women will think that the doctors know better then they do and will follow that advice.  <br>  <br>  While recovering from labor/delivery and 9 months of pregnancy, some women are just too tired or sick to keep up the extremely taxing schedule of feeding every two hours.  <br>  <br>  Some babies just won't nurse on their own and if a mom doesn't know where to turn for support or advice, may turn to formula out of desperation (because no mom wants to see her baby go hungry).<br>  <br>  You really should try to be less judgmental about this.  Just because a woman makes a decision that you don't necessarily agree with, doesn't mean she loves her baby any less, or that she isn't trying to do what is best for her baby.<br>  <br>  Congratulations to you for being able to feed your baby, it's the same thing the rest of us are doing.|`|UghJ0XROaa	Formula is viewed as normal now, regardless of how you feel about it. I have no issue with someone using formula, but it's convenient way out for some. Again, do what you want for your baby, but since formula is viewed as being normal, it's no big deal to anyone. I am proud of myself for breastfeeding so long, years ago women stayed at home and breastfed, i work a full time job and have to pump and store and it's a hassle. So yeah i am proud, i don't have the convenience of staying to do it. I don't blame anyone for going to formula when they go back to work, because it's hard! Do i think formula should be the normal or expected way to feed a baby? No, but it's not my call to make and it's great for people who need it or choose to use it.|`|CugCzH9iaa	I don't really get it either except they are proud of themselves for being "so attached" to their baby.  I am breastfeeding my third baby and would NEVER say I am Happy I was able to handle it for so long it sounds like you just want a compliment!  the alternative is formula and either way she has to eat...its so much better for her!!! To me formula is HARDER, it is expensive, and you have to make it instead of just "whipping it out"!|`|RT3Og4Oiaa	Seriously...do you ever stop? Why do you ask these questions over and over again? To make yourself higher on that Pedestal that you put yourself on? I'm very proud of  you and other mothers that breast feed, and I am proud for all the mothers who formula feed....YOU ALL are feeding and taking care of your children...But for crying out loud...ENOUGH!!!! <br>  <br>  And I totally agree with Noah's Mommy, with EVERYTHING she said.<br>  <br>  ---"But that didn't stop me from feeding my baby."<br>  <br>  And you know what? Nothing stopped me from feeding my baby as well......Golly Gee go figure.|`|T0gv52CDaa	I think it is harder for some women than others.  I nursed my 1st 13 months, and am currently nursing my 2nd, and have found it easy both times.  Only pumping is challenging for me.  I know some women though that absolutely hate it, and are miserable well beyond the 1st couple of weeks that it hurts everyone.|`|b3892e48ce1ff2d86e671ceef5fd7a83aa	Well, it is difficult for some people- my SIL, for example, her daughter had a really bad tongue tie that went undiagnosed and nobody knew why she was having such a horrible time until years later when her daughter developed speech problems. Not even the doctors!<br>  <br>  Plus, as a pregnant mom (I'm due in 3 days) you hear a lot of horror stories, a lot of people warn you, "it's going to be very very hard for a while," etc. So yes, I would imagine you would feel surprised if it was easy for you. :)|`|08GDBedGaa	breastfeeding can be hard and restricting for some mum's so formula suits there lifestyle, some is better than none!!! yes babies do need to eat that is why it's great there is such good formula's around these days, to provide for babies, mum's who cannot "manage"to breastfeed!!|`|3NyM1cq5aa	Because it is hard for a lot of people!  There were so many times I was thisclose to giving up.  But I stuck with it and I AM proud of myself!  It was the best decision for my son and me, but it isn't for everyone.  Anyone who attempts breastfeeding should be proud of themselves for at least giving it a shot.<br>  You are so irritating.|`|WxQFe0GYaa	Women should be happy when they breastfeed their child.  Why aren't you?  You act like it's a chore and you just did it because you felt you had to.  Some women are excited about being able to do that for their child.|`|955YoHvVaa	Oh go breastfeed your baby already..you spend alot of time on here judging other mothers..go pay attention to your child and grow up already.|`|u9sGH0AXaa	I am proud because my mom told me she was not able to bf me.  So my whole pregnancy I was doubtful. Then when I had her it came naturally.|`|vCq3dR40aa	For some, breastfeeding is extremely difficult to start. Problems with latch on, breast infections, low milk supply due to overtired or overstressed, thrush, . . . <br>  <br>  Once you work through that stuff, then there is the long nights with not enough sleep.<br>  <br>  However, if you just recently tried to properly wash a bottle and nipple while your baby is crying in hunger and then make formula, and perhaps wait while it warms up, you and baby might be much happier nursing.  It is fast, safe, and baby frequently has less problems with gas and spit up.<br>  <br>  For me, I am very glad I could nurse my baby.  I know it is best for her and if you ask me, best for me too.<br>  <br>  I am told it will also reduce the saggyness of your breasts.|`|BGcVEjfGaa	For me it was harder after the 6 months simply because my milk went away!  Poof!  With my first it was because I was pregnant again but with my second it happened again for no inexpicable reason.  I didn't want to stop breastfeeding at all but I had to because I was no longer producing anything.  I don't really like formula feeding but it was what a I had to do.  It was very sad.  It seemed like overnight I went from having more than enough milk to nothing.  I tried everything!  Fenugreek, pumping, you name it, I tried it.  So please don't be hard on the mothers who had to stop.  Most of them probably didn't want to.  I know I didn't.|`|DzPZ8EEkaa	Ummm, in a perfect world maybe.  There are lots of reasons that a mother may find it difficult to continue breastfeeding their baby....a bit unrealistic to assume otherwise in my opinion.  It is a wonderful gift that you give to your child and you should feel proud however long you are able to do so.  You shouldn't feel so superior, but grateful instead for being able to breastfeed as long as you have.  Try not to judge.|`|959ad44e37da1dfd2d46c54b82c1535faa	It took me about 3-4 weeks to finally get it!. I never give up...I cried so many times....but we got it.

We had latching problems and I fed my son with a medicine dropper for the first week! But I never gave up on breast feeding. I knew I just had to keep trying. I think support is a big thing. Women are so convinced that formula is fine and that breast feeding is REALLY hard if they don't have great support they give up. I know when I hear someone breast fed for a few weeks I'm like, "Wow, a whole two months? Huh." A friend of mine lasted eight months and was so sick of feeling like a milk cow she was glad to stop. I guess I just can't relate to that. Why would you be sick of feeding your child? Sick of bonding with them and holding them or sick of doing what's best for them? I don't know. I guess not all of us were cut out for it but I'd like to know what those proud formula feeders would have done two hundred years ago. If they couldn't get a wet nurse would they have just let their baby starve? Seems weird to me that you would have a baby and not feed them naturally and do what's best for them.|`|3CVfUiiJaa	I managed to feed my baby just fine....he has no trouble eating his formula.  What strikes me is how narrow minded, and arrogant you are.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Oh god, when do you stop?<br>  <br>  We get it. You don't like formula and you "exclusively breastfeed" your baby. <br>  <br>  I think any amount of breastfeeding is beneficial to your baby, even the two weeks I was able to give my son helped him out a bit. So good for those mothers for being proud of something they did. Everyone IS able to feed their baby, it may just not be what you "approve" of. My son wouldn't latch but he was ABLE to have formula and has made it through 11 healthy months thus far.<br>  <br>  (On a side note, how in the world do you have a TC badge when all your questions/answers are judgmental? Oh, wait, I'm sure you have multiple accounts to boost this one up.)|`|kzt8Kdkfaa	I am surprised when I look back on the early weeks...I clearly remember crying at 4 am and thinking I cannot do this, I am going to switch.  If you would have told me then I'd still be nursing at 16 months, I'd've thought you were crazy.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I thought you just resented women who formula fed - now you resent women who are proud of breastfeeding too?<br>  <br>  You are a hard woman to please, Fajina.|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	Ohhh get off your high horse fajita!<br>  <br>  ANY time spent breastfeeding is beneficial to the baby.

I wanted to have at least 3 kids and got so excited that I got pregnant. At the very end of pregnancy I ended up with emergency c-section and after that I was told that I may not be able to have any more kids. We tried for few years with no results. I went into depression trying to conceive. After 10 years of trying different methods we gave up. Suddenly last December (15 years after my son was born, week before Christmas) I went to the hospital with what I though was hernia and found out I was 3.5 months pregnant! Right now I have beautiful baby girl. Don't lose hope but at the same time be realistic. Get yourself and your partner check and have fun trying. Good luck guys.|`|8e48GIVUaa	I liked mycycle.com its free and easy to use. If you are having unprotected sex 3-4 times a week and not getting pregnant its time to see the doc. You may not be ovulating or your partner may have a low sperm count. In either case there are often easy fixes that wont increase your chances of having a "litter". Baby dust to you!!!!!<br>  <br>  Edit: this may sound silly but maybe you ovulate so soon after your period that you "miss" it. If you dont already try having sex every other day for a few entire cycles, even when on your period, maybe not the really heavy days but the lighter ones at the end.|`|99BUI37uaa	You should both get checked out by a specialist.

b7d318294d0b5d18993e97bdb9835a11aa	The point where you went wrong was about when you got married and became a stepfather...and maybe failed to discuss guidelines for how you can discipline the child when mother is not available. It is impossible to anticipate and list all the possible "crimes" an 8 year old can commit and appropriate punishments, but by bringing this topic up before something happened, you may have gotten a hint about your wife's parenting and disciplining style. <br>  <br>  In my house that action would definitely merit a spank with a talk from both parents. But if I were married to a man not my children's father, I might pause at the thought of him administering physical punishment, especially if we had never discussed it before. This sort of happened, but with my mother-in-law. We talked about it and agreed that certain punishments were ok, even slaps on the hand, but in the end, we, my husband and I were only comfortable with corporal punishment if it was us who administered it; because we know our own limitations (we don't spank for every mischief, but grandma wanted to). <br>  <br>  I do not think that it is uncivilized to spank. I think if done lovingly (sounds dumb to say it this way, but most parents may understand) it is an acceptable form of discipline and by the way, is not illegal, though some persons would argue that spanking with a bare hand is legal and spanking with an object is illegal (look it up if you are uncertain).<br>  <br>  At this point, to save your marriage I would ask for forgiveness from both of them. Tell them you reacted because of anger, disappointment , and fear (of how out of control that could have gotten). Ask if you can talk about what you can do to make it better. Tell her that a "time out" did not seem appropriate, but you may have over stepped your boundary. <br>  <br>  A reasonable person would be open to discussion and be able to reflect on the seriousness of the child's action. It is ok for her to be mad at you, but not ok to let the matter go, end a marriage, or be insulting to you for your response. She should understand how you felt at the time and maybe take into consideration if you a new parent and have never disciplined a child before...<br>  <br>  Depending on how she responds to you trying to remedy the situation, you have an answer about whether or not you two should be together. Can you handle not being allowed to discipline the child in the future (she could turn into a disrespectful monster towards you)?  <br>  <br>  Good luck and God bless.|`|jsiCuoKzaa	get rid of them both. Her mother just enabled her daughters bad behavior by dressing you down for what ANY parent should have done. I dunno about the wooden spoon. personally I like hand spanking or a rubber hose (leaves no marks) UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES should any paddling leave a mark that is going too far, but you were within your rights. I'd kick'em both out.. Ihave kicked women to the curb for much less.|`|TcR4EJjHaa	It was not right of you to whoop her.That is her mother's job.You should have put her on a time out until her mother came home.<br>  <br>  I do think it is a tad pathetic that her mother coddles her even though she could have very well kill you and herself.<br>  <br>  Better off without that careless person.|`|75acbeaefbdb50e3100c79930d1c607caa	its hard to say cuz she is not ur child but it is not like she didnt have that siht commin her mom is at fault here she needs to be more on her kid!<br>  i think a wooden spoon to the azz is better then kickin her mom azz|`|xw2JQrChaa	i don't think you went too far.<br>  the mother should have taught the child long ago that fire is not safe.<br>  it's your mothers house, and you have all right to be mad.|`|13ba52d1d8f776526728149760b05c93aa	I think that you two should have discussed discipline before you were married; obviously that wasn't the case. I personally do think you crossed the line. While the girl probably knows right from wrong, it isn't necessary to spank, and definitely not hitting the child with an inanimate object. Violence breeds violence. The appropriate thing to do is to talk to her about what she did wrong, why she shouldn't have done it, and when she is in trouble because she did something wrong how to get help. You definitely need to educate her about the danger of playing with fire. Maybe take her to a children's hospital burn unit and have her talk to some of the children there. I think then she will realize how fire can hurt people, even children. She could have been injured or killed (not to mention, anyone else in the house, too). The mother was bound to freak out if you were beating her child with a spoon, when clearly that won't resolve the problem and it won't teach the child not to play with fire. And yes, I do think some type of discipline beyond just a time out is necessary, but for a child of that age, it's difficult to say what she would understand. I think education is the key here. Hope that helps and good luck.|`|Swtvqg8jaa	I do not agree with hitting any child but maybe this isn't really what your question is.<br>  I believe that you should have dealt with it WITH your wife. You are not the father and unfortunately I believe discipline should come from the biological parent. I lived with a step father who was very abusive and it has scarred me for life. I am not saying you are abusive but if you want everything to work out you need to work with your wife when it comes to her daughter.<br>  Good luck|`|iVVtBjhXaa	Your step-daughter was curious.  Yes, all kids know not to play with fire but a lot of people do things they're not supposed to do without thinking of the consequences.  She panicked when she realized what she had done and didn't know how to fix it, knew she would be in trouble and did the first thing that came to her mind--she ran away.  You did what you thought first to do--spank her as punishment.  I don't know any parent who, if they made a list of all things a kid can be punished for, would write "set fire" as one of them.   I probably would have spanked my kid or step-kid, too.  I don't think that's enough punishment, really, for almost making the family homeless or worse.  Her mother probably reacted to your spanking her daughter the way she did because she wasn't there to see how bad it was.  Also, maybe she believes that she's the only one who should discipline her daughter because you're not the girl's father.  Hopefully, your step-daughter doesn't get the idea that her mom will protect her no matter what she does.  Talk to your wife when you've both calmed down about actions and punishments for them.   First, tell her you're sorry about your snap reaction (even though you were right--she could have killed you both).  Then tell her you would like to discuss how to discipline your daughter.  Keep calm and she will, too.  Good luck.|`|f02dd6fe2f69b561fd27780ddb405724aa	Hey i am a mother of 3 boys my oldest is 4 and i caught him playing with a cig. lighter and I spanked his a** to and did not  think twice about it.

I think what you should have done was wait for her mom to come home, tell her the situation and together think of an appropriate punishment.  Is this the only punishment she got for doing this (a spanking?)   Before all of this though, you should have sent her to her room (or whereever there was no smoke damage) and cool off first.|`|0qP8gLpyaa	It's the mothers lack of a firmer hand that the kid does this stuff. Be glad it was able to go out easily.  While I don't think you should have used a wooden spoon, I would have spanked her as well for this.  this is why at this age time out is ridiculous. You don't give a kid time out for playing with lighters or matches... and time out at 8 is ridiculous.|`|G9ywiLqvaa	i think your question should be "did my wife go too far?"<br>  getting an annulment because you spanked her kid?  huh?  talk about an overreaction!<br>  <br>  ok, ok, maybe you stepped out of the boundary a bit.  the mode of disciplining should always be discussed and agreed upon by the mother and the father/step dad.  but hey, it was a spur of the moment decision.  the girl almost had you and her killed!<br>  <br>  i suggest you talk it out with your wife when she's cooled down.  maybe she's realized you were right.  it just hasn't sunk in yet that you're as responsible to her daughter now just as she is.  <br>  <br>  then plan out a proper disciplining guide for her daughter...together.  i mean, really, she's 8 years old!  my son knows he can't play with fire because fire is dangerous --and he's only 4 years old!<br>  <br>  |`|HclKftzAaa	I don't think you went to far personally.<br>  <br>  But i would think that you and her would have agreed on a set of discipline rules before this happened....

I totally agree with your side of the argument, my man.<br>  <br>  I say that it is all right for parents to spank their kids PROVIDED THAT it is done with love and not out of anger. Also, some kids will not be receptive to this form of discipline, so it's like jousting windmills. But so long as the parent has calmed down from the anger, I say it is completely justified, provided that the offense merits physical spanking. In this case, it most certainly DID. <br>  <br>  If this woman annuls the marriage, that is her choice. You shouldn't have to put up with a pyromaniacal step child.

You both have to agree as to what is appropriate discipline for you to dole out and what has to wait until she comes home.<br>  <br>  By the way, the punishment wouldn't have ended with the spanking.  Grounding and chores for a month would probably have followed.|`|gILygKvRaa	well, i think you were a teensy bit out of line. Its not your child and you need to dicuss with her mother about punishing her. But of course it was YOUR house and you have every right to enforce your rules your wife was being a bit overprotective and maybe its because shes not used to someone punishing her child. The way i see it, you need to talk to your wife and then you and her need to have a serious talk about fire with  your daughter. YES she IS your daughter to now

The bleeding for those four weeks was lochia, NOT your period.   And if you have implanon, they are lower still. <br>  <br>  I think you can relax.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Exclusive breastfeeding is highly effective, about 99% effective until your period returns OR the first 6 months.<br>  <br>  By definition, for the purposed of "lactatonal amennorhea method" any bleeding before 56 days post-partum (8 weeks) is NOT the return of your period.<br>  <br>  However Implanon has a failure rate of 0.05% so unless I'm missing something about it not being effective the first 3 weeks I'm not sure why you are using condoms.  Breastfeeding should add to the effectiveness of Implanon, if anything.<br>  <br>  <br>  PS Most of the women that "got pregnant" while breastfeeding weren't following all of the rules.  Its at least every four hours during the day and at least every 6 at night.  NO pumping, NO bottles.

Feeding formula, pumping instead of nursing[2], and feeding solids all reduce the effectiveness of LAM.<br>      * The infant must breastfeed at least every four hours during the day and at least every six hours at night.<br>      * The infant must be less than six months old.<br>      * The mother must not have had a period after 56 days post-partum (when determining fertility, bleeding prior to 56 days post-partum can be ignored).<br>  <br>  [edit] Ecological breastfeeding<br>  <br>  Ecological breastfeeding is a stricter form of LAM developed by Sheila Kippley, one of the founders of the Couple to Couple League. Studies have shown it has a 1% failure rate in the first six months postpartum, and a 6% failure rate before the woman’s first postpartum menstruation.[3][4] The Seven Standards of ecological breastfeeding are slightly different from the LAM criteria:<br>  <br>      * Breastfeeding must be the infant’s only source of nutrition – no formula, no pumping, and (if the infant is less than six months old) no solids or water at all.<br>      * The infant must be pacified at the breast, not with pacifiers or bottles or by placing a finger in the mouth.<br>      * The infant must be breastfed frequently. The standards for LAM are a bare minimum; greater frequency is better. Sucking should include non-nutritive sucking when the infant cues the mother, not just breastfeeding as a means of nutrition. Scheduling of feedings is incompatible with LAM.<br>      * Mothers must sleep with their infants in the same bed to allow for nursing throughout the night.<br>      * Mothers must not be separated from their infants. This includes substitutes for mother such as babysitters and even strollers or anything else that comes between mother and physical contact with her child. Babywearing (using cloth carriers) means tactile stimulation between mother and child and increases access to the breast. Any separation from the mother will decrease the efficacy of ecological breast feeding.<br>      * Mothers must take daily naps with their infants.<br>      * A mother must not have had a period after 56 days post-partum (bleeding prior to 56 days post-partum can be ignored).<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://ccli.org/nfp/basics/effectiveness-p04.php" rel="nofollow">http://ccli.org/nfp/basics/effectiveness...</a><br>  In the light of this demonstrated effectiveness, the ethical propriety of certain allegations about natural family planning must be questioned. For example, the FDA Consumer for May, 1985 ran an article that listed "Natural Family Planning or Rhythm" as having an estimated effectiveness of "very variable, perhaps 53-86%.13 Correspondence with the editors and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services medical advisors to the FDA Consumer revealed that the basis for that very low figure were two Latin American studies. One was almost entirely a calendar rhythm study in Colombia. 14 and the other was a comparison between the Ovulation Method (OM) and the Sympto-Thermal Method (STM) also done in Colombia by some of the same people involved in a somewhat similar study in Los Angeles. 15<br>  <br>  The Colombian calendar rhythm study was conducted in six birth control centers and had many problems. The overall Pearl rate was 47.0 pregnancies per 100 woman years which translates to a 53% effectiveness rate.<br>  <br>  The rhythm investigators also studied the effectiveness of the Pill in those same Colombian birth control center and reported a Pearl unplanned pregnancy rate of 10.5 or an 89.5% effectiveness rate.<br>  <br>  Thus, the FDA authorities used a study that reported a 89.5% effectiveness rate for the Pill and a 53% effectiveness rate for calendar rhythm. However, they ignored the Colombian 89.5% figure for the Pill and reported only a 99% figure, supposedly from other sources. In fact, they did not even report an 89.5 to 99% range in effectiveness for the Pill; they reported on the single highest figure. Can that be called ethical and fair?<br>  <br>  The Colombian OM-STM comparison study used by the FDA to allege low effectiveness for NFP failed to report on "method failures," concentrating entirely on user effectiveness. With the life-table method of statistics there was a net pregnancy rate of 24.2% for OM users and 19.8% for STM users. In terms of the older Pearl formula, the pregnancy rates were 33.8 per 100 woman years for OM users and 26.0 for STM users during the one year of the follow-up phase.<br>  <br>  As the authors reported, "The results of this study indicate that these two methods of NFP cannot be considered as simple methods of family planning but as a new way of life which requires changes in sexual behavior cannot be achieved in a short period of time.. The degree of motivation toward following periodic abstinence is related to cultural factors that make abstinence difficult to practice in Colombia."|`|vCq3dR40aa	While it is not unheard of to be fertile at 7 weeks, I think you are fairly safe.  (breastfeeding at least every 3-4 hours during the day and no breaks more than 9 hours, even at night)  Of course, as you already know, you won't know when you become fertile because it is traditionally before you have your first period.|`|AA10949064	This is a huge misconception among many women.  "They" say it's impossible to get pregnant while breastfeeding, but if you ask your doctor, you will get the exact opposite answer.  In fact, you are VERY fertile after just having your baby and need to be extra cautious when having sex.  My doctor made it very clear to make sure my hubby and I had protected sex until we were clear with my birth control.<br>  <br>  My suggestion - if you really don't want to get pregnant right now, which you really shouldn't if you want your body to heal properly, call your doctor and see about getting the morning after pill.  You have 72 hours to take it.  Better safe than sorry!!!<br>  <br>  Your body really needs an entire year to get back to "normal."  Plus like you had said, you really want to have this time to enjoy your new bundle of joy, not another pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Good luck in your decision.|`|KyFCYs0Yaa	I don't think you should have anything to worry about if you have been on birth control for a week. They told me to use protection for a month after I started using birth control though...<br>  You can still get pregnant while breastfeeding. I think that is an old wives tale, (probably why pioneer families had 15 kids! :)<br>  If you are going to take a test I would wait about 3 weeks. You might not get your period at all while breastfeeding, so if you just wait to start your period, you might go crazy waiting! But if for some reason you did ovulate, and are indeed pregnant, your hormone levels won't be enough to turn anything positive for at least 2 weeks, probably more like 3. <br>  Good Luck, and get some KY to keep those condoms safe! lol|`|M5jF5w5Taa	One of my favorite parenting books written by a pediatrician put it this way--<br>  <br>  There's a name for people who use breastfeeding as birth control: Parents.<br>  <br>  Some women are completely period-free the whole time they breastfeed, but I got mine back after only 2 months. So don't be hard on yourself, but don't trust that breastfeeding prevents pregnancy.|`|C8wg1uyhaa	It is possible that u could be pregnant.One of my friends was breastfeeding her second child constantly and when he was 7 weeks old she found out she pregnant again.|`|BGcVEjfGaa	It is definitely possible to get pregnant while breastfeeding exclusively.  I did.  You are especially fertile the first few weeks after having your baby.<br>  However, if you are on birth control and breastfeeding your chances are substantially less.  So don't worry too much.<br>  Also, please don't use your period as a factor.  I breastfed my first son and never had a cycle.  He was 6 months old when I got pregnant with my second son.  (or thereabouts)  I was almost 8 weeks pregnant with my second child before I even knew.  The only signs were morning sickness and my breast mild dwindled.  Soooo.... there you go.  My second child is 7 1/2 months old and I STILL haven't had a period.  So I haven't had one in almost 3 years!  (cool huh?)<br>  So there's my answer, but please don't stress yourself out too much.<br>  And yes, the heat of the moment can be a real booger!  My second can vouch for that!
UJsm1OLeaa	My daughter is 17 months old too and just had tubes put in last friday. she too had so many ear infections and i was so over giving her all different antibiotics. she was a little groggy after the surgery for a few hours then was right back to normal. i swear she even talks more because she likes the sound of her voice better,,,lol... i would do it if he is a good candidate for them. every other mom i talked to whose child had them put in has given a 100% review of them.  the most difficult part is trying to put ear plugs in her when she is bathing but i am sure we will work it out. good luck|`|lVuvUqoiaa	My husband had tubes put in his ears as a child and had to see a speech therapist for years afterwards.  He had major tonsil problems too but didn't get them removed.  <br>  When I was a child, I had ear infection after ear infection and had my tonsils removed.  That did the trick for me.<br>  Maybe consult another doctor?  If you don't feel comfortable doing it, don't let your child go through it.  Good luck to you!  :-)|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	Aidan had them very shortly after his 1st birthday.  He had what seemed like a never-ending ear infection in both ears.  I want to say it was 7, maybe 8 of them.  He got his 1st at 7 months old.  He turned 4 last month and his tubes fell out on their own about a year prior.  He has NEVER had another ear infection since getting the tubes [knocking on wood now].  They were a blessing!!!!!!  <br>  The hard part was keeping water out of his ears during bath time and swimming that first year.  The hardest was seeing him cry immediately after the surgery.  I wouldn't trade it for anything though, it was the best thing we ever did!!!!<br>  <br>  ETA:  I forgot something else..... he lost a little bit of his hearing prior to the tubes and it all returned after getting them|`|36a3ynpJaa	I know someone who had tubes put in.  It is not something I would  recommend.  It is much better to find out what is causing the infections.  Have you moved since he had the infections? It could be something in your home that is causing the infections, like mold or allergies.  Also if someone is smoking, that could be a factor.
ZGfcM9wLaa	There's no reason to feel guilty at all. It's perfectly normal. Everyone needs time for themselves or we would all be insane. I have 4 kids, no help, no family, no help at all so if you have a chance to get a break every once in awhile, take advantage of it. You will see once it's time to go pick up your baby that you will feel so much better. Not only you, but it's also good for babies to get a break from their parents too.|`|64c705e332ca73b5ae16bb7956f90becaa	You shouldn't feel guilty for wanting to have a baby-sitter to baby sit your baby for a day, sometimes you do need to have some time to yourself to think and relax, and get stuff done. It's unfortunate that your family isn't close to you, because it'd be easier for you to take your baby to your family. If you're gonna hire a baby-sitter, you need to find someone who's qualify and that you can trust. But I say don't feel guilty about getting someone to baby sit your kid, you need the free time.|`|c1EPejxSaa	ohh yes!! i feel the same way quite often!! i am a mother of two small children. I have a son who turned 3 about a mnth ago and i also have a daughter that is 11 months old, and to top it off i am pregnant again but this time i am having TWIN BOYS!! There are lots of time i wish i had someone to just take the kids for a while so i can have some time alone and to my self just to regroup. i have no one to do it either and my kids father works while i stay at home with them everyday!|`|mcmOslOFaa	My oldest is 9 years old...it is still herd for me to let my three kids go to a babysitter.  i have a 9, 7 ,and 3 year old. I think it just how you are as a mommy!!  you are a great mom, and feel as though it is your job to have her at all times and it is nobody else job to raise her.  i do understand about wanting a break and needing a break. and YOU should get one without feeling guilty, you deserve it!  Even if it is for only an hour that will help for you to let her go for 2 hours next time.  But start out with small time frames and this will help the both of you adjust.  Good luck sweety, and try not to feel guilty, just go for a walk alone or have lunch with some friends.  It will really help you!!|`|G2auAv1Saa	Don't feel guilty about it. It will help you regroup, clear your mind and be a better mommy. Find a good daycare in the area and see what their drop in rates are and do it every few weeks even if all you do in your time off is grocery shop or take a nap. Don't ever feel guilty about taking care of your needs too, your mood and mental status does effect your child|`|AA11210211	Don't feel guilty hun every mom needs time to herself.I personally haven't gotten a babysitter but my mom and my in-laws have watched the kids for us,but If I didn't have that outlet I would definitely hire a babysitter.I say go for it and treat yourself to some alone time:)|`|cYRZpGkqaa	It's normal. I found my time to regroup when I got a part-time job for a few months. It wasn't the working itself, it was the breaks I got at work, lol. I would just sit outside and relax. It's normal. Don't feel bad.|`|cp30vrVoaa	No, this is perfectly normal and it would be healthy for you, too.|`|AA12032374	I felt that way many times. I did find a sitter for my son but it took lots of effort to find the right one. I was a stay at home Mom at the time, so money was tight. I found a great sitter that I took him to 2 days a month, and had Mom time. I went and had my nails done, hair done, or even just stayed home at took a nice hot bath and relaxed. Everyone needs a little "me" time. Please don't feel guilty about your own feelings. They are what you are feeling. There is no need for the guilt. Take some time for yourself, it will make you a better Mom, wife and all around person.|`|IPl3Yh1kaa	You feel guilty about wanting to recharge your battery? Don't. I have a sitter that comes in twice a week. 3 hours on Tuesday and 4 hours on Wed. By Thursday I am feeling like a new happy women! <br>  <br>  I have no family close just like you, and I thought I was superwomen. I did all the night feedings, all the day feedings, all the EVERYTHING until one day I snapped and told my hubby I needed help. As soon as I got it a weight was lifted. <br>  <br>  You are a better mother when you are alive and happy not down trodden and exhausted. Check references, and get a sitter a few hours a week! Good luck to you.|`|s4aX6bF6aa	you're not alone...every parent feels like this at one time or another...i myself feel this about once a week...i just feel like i need someone to watch my 2 year old if just for a few hours...that way i could regroup and regain my footing from a busy week...it's natural to want 'me' time and it's well deserved time when you get 'me' time...everyone needs to know that they're ok in the end.|`|XPnCeJ29aa	Very very normal.<br>  And completely needed.<br>  Everyone needs some time for themselves!!<br>  Some more than others and that is OKAY!<br>  I have my son sleep at my moms every saturday night, and she will usually watch him once during the week for 3 hours.<br>  I need the break, and Im fine with knowing that, it keeps me happier.|`|5RAQxWtKaa	Sounds like getting a good sitter is just what you need.  9 months is a good age because she is able to move and "socialize" more.  Couple of ways of finding someone:<br>  <br>  -Do a play group, it will get you out of the house, plus you can meet other moms that have sitters, they can give you recommendations. Or maybe you can do a "I'll watch your baby if you watch mine."  It might be easier to leave her with another mom.<br>  <br>  -Call up a pre-school and find out if they could ask the teachers if they are interested in sitting for you.  I worked in a preschool, and I loved the extra money.  Also, well, I had more training then a 16 year old. It might make you feel better.<br>  <br>  -If you have any Colleges around, call them up.  You can post something in the "student work office."  <br>  <br>  -Talk to the town hall, or police station on how you can run a background check, and get references. As someone that did a lot of babysitting/nannying, I was always willing to share all this info. <br>  <br>  -Be willing to pay a little more then the going rate.  Honestly, a more qualified sitter costs more.<br>  <br>  If you are really nervous about leaving her then don't try to go for a whole day, just maybe an hour or two. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA11920812	Completely normal. I have often thought of taking my kids to the daycare I took them to when I worked. Just once or twice a month. However, my husband and I decided it`d be easier on the pocketbook if he watched them a few evenings while I went out by myself. I`ve also taken them to my mom`s for the afternoon.<br>  <br>  It doesnot make you a bady mommy!! Not at all!! I am a much better mommy haven taken time for myself. I know it is the reason I was able to overcome ppd. <--- Being supermom is just not reality.|`|IGXE3aDraa	I think it would be a good idea to "regroup" ever mother needs a little time to remember she is a woman and herself. many people get lost in their children and forget that they are an entity as well. go to the local high school and ask the guidance counselor if she perhaps knows of a responsible person who would like to make a little money every once in a while. i'm sure they can hook you up with some young adults that would be happy to watch your baby while you remember that you remember yourself. good luck|`|Knierqi9aa	Yes, we all need a break.  I have been a SAH mom for over 8 years, but love it becaue I DO have outlets for myself.  No matter how much you love yuor child/husband, you need some "me" time.  I also have never lived near family, so have had to find my own sitters and other moms to "regroup" with.  I have found that being around other moms (w/ or without the kids) makes a huge difference.  Find a local MOPS group, (google it; they have chapters everywhere), set up a date night for you and your hubby.  don't feel bad, just take control of your situation so that you can be the best mom.  It's very easy to begin to resent your situation if your needs go unmet. Tell your husband how you feel; he may have no idea.  Do a few errands in the evening, alone, after dinner.  let him spend some alone time w/his child too; that very important, especially if you plan on having more kids; he needs to have a "turn" to be "on-duty" as well. Sure, get a sitter for the day and just enjoy yourself.  Your human and deserve some free time too.<br>  <br>  As for Chris n?  you can't adequately answer a question on how to perfom surgery if your not a surgeon...need I say more?|`|T2BEuG5maa	It is perfectly normal to need a little time to yourself. My husband takes the kids every once in awhile for a few hours and lets me go to the spa. It really helps a lot to have a bit of a break and you are more rejuvinated and prepared to take care of your child. I have found that some daycares provide drop in care. Ask other moms in the area if they know of a good one and you can usually drop the kids off for a few dollars an hour. Then you can have the option of taking care of stuff at home or going out.|`|h93SVSxLaa	Everyone needs a Mommy day... well i like to call them adult days. Time for you to be an adult to regroup who your are besides the caretaker for the most precious thing in the world. Interview people around you and find some one you are comfortable with and make sure to get a day in for yourself every once in a while. It won't hurt your daughter to have someone else to play with her for a few hours. just make sure you are happy with the person. Then go window shopping or something you did before you had her. Have fun enjoyu and DON"T feel guilty about it!
tQVBDx5Paa	Well he must be on a four hour schedule (which I have heard of but never experienced) and sleep at least 12 hours at night....I don't know how a newborn goes that long without eating.  Emma was eating every three hours and sleeping 8 hours so she was eating five bottles a day.  At 11 weeks they were 7 ounce bottles.|`|aUifz2a4aa	It doesn't seem like enough. I breast feed, but express milk for him as well.<br>  He is 4 weeks old and will drink 5 oz from a bottle and he eats every couple hours during the day, and less frequently at night.<br>  I have fed him 3 times already today! And its just after noon.|`|B2Gki86uaa	It doesn't seem enough because a newborn baby's stomach can take no more than 4-5oz at a time so it would be only 15oz max which is less than the minimum amount that a baby needs (19oz a day)-  |`|J9rnzW7taa	no a baby of that age shold be on at least 6 bottles a day |`|lgyl0tSpaa	A baby that young needs to be fed every 2-4 hours depending on what you are feeding-breastmilk or formula- and how many ounces he takes per feeding. I breastfed my son primarily and gave him occasional bottles just so I could gage what he was taking in and about 9 weeks he was still only taking 3 to 3-1/2 ounces and every 3 hours like clockwork. Formula fed babies sometimes take more because it easier to empty a bottle than a breast and they will need fed less frequently. Either way 3 feedings is not enough. It is possible that 3 bottles a day as a supplementary feeding method to breastfeeding would be acceptable.|`|Ih8M8PV7aa	The best answer will be one from the baby's doctor. She can even call the doctor's office and ask, if she can't go there personally. I too nursed my babies, but like you said, 3 bottles of formula a day doesn't sound right.|`|CNXUEHZqaa	it seems like very little to me. i'm sure that an 11 week old should be on 4 to 5  seven once bottles a day. it depends on the baby i suppose, if the baby is growing and a healthy weight there probably isn't an issue |`|hKy4e4X4aa	 no a baby should eat every 2-4 hours when they are young as they get older the get more hungry tell your friend to talk to her baby's doctor about the correct feeding|`|crspNObZaa	babies need to eat every three hours or so, so definetly not enough.|`|S7XTl9NCaa	Many correct answers here, but I'll chime in with mine anywho... It's not enough. At that age they should be eating every 3 to 4 hours at least.|`|dyc0lHHgaa	No.  They should def. be eating more frequently.  My dd is 13 weeks and she eats 5 -  6 times a day.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	no that is not enough....bay should have about 5-6 4 ounce bottles a day that age. |`|CTMFTU9saa	I believe as long as they are taking in the correct amount of ounces for their body weight then it should be fine.  I would just space out the number of ounces for more feedings during the day.  An 11 week old who is only eating 3 times a day must get very hungry in-between those feedings.  
OLpWRv2uaa	3 baby's? I think your lack of sex drive is someone of a higher power telling you to stop overpopulating the earth. 2 is enough. |`|4S6V4sb4aa	i have had 3 kids and im only 20 i lost my sex drive when i was pregnant also... and really still dont have it back like it should be... and have hurd from a cpuple people as well some times it goes up and some times u loose it i really dnt knw y it has alot to do with ur hormones.|`|UUtTDAJraa	Well it's normal to not have a sex drive while pregnant. It really is different with everyone. Who knows if after you will regain it back. It could be months, even years. I was in your situation with a no sex drive and it's not pleasant. I tried dieting and exercising but it didn't do anything. Until I tried this natural herbal enhancer which is meant to increase the sex drive along with other things I've noticed. It's a topical oil called Hersolution Gel which is like an instant libido boost. Along with that my sensations are just blasting and my orgasms are then best. Read up about it at herenhancement.com where I saved on it at the time. It got better with every application. I was skeptical at first but the companies return policy made me commit. From what I remember you have to try out for a couple months but then after that you can return it if it doesn't work. It would work great for your situation considering your pregnant and theres no need to swallow anything. Well good luck and I hope this helps.|`|kG6VWsGvaa	Every pregnancy is different, so it's normal for things like this to happen. Some women may experience a very high sex drive, while others may have no desire for sex at all. It'll pass soon.|`|AA10458750	 If you don't want it, you don't want it...you know.....theres nothign you can do. It may be your body's way of telling that intercourse may not be safe for this pregnancy. |`|vorphSsraa	i haven't had a sex drive since i found out i was pregnant. i'm 33 weeks and still have no sex drive. it's normal, some people either want it or they don't.|`|LbLai4Hpaa	im under 5 weeks and i have ZERO sex drive which is normally nothing like me... i just cant seem to get it either... hope everything works out for ya though cuz i know what the nagging hubby is like haha!!! congratulations!!!|`|yf7sGLkdaa	If you want, you can borrow some of mine.|`|c34f14807bea7b972646385cad6c11b1aa	It's completely normal.  My guess is that your drive will come back in 13 weeks.  
EJrM8gr9aa	i spent 2 months in the hospital for preterm labor so my son could have the best chance he can have. because of that, i am very cautious. everyone has there philosophy about how they think it occurs. i was once told that some people think that cribs with baby bumpers dont produce enough air flow so due to the lack of oxygen, they pass away. because of that, and the fact that i NEED to be able to see him at all times, his crib doesnt have a bumper|`|CMuaKItfaa	I lost my nephew to SIDS.  When I had my own two sons, I worried until one day when I decided that I wasn't in control.  I had to let go of my fear because it was ruining my time with my children.  I was able to calm down but my husband never did.  He would jump out of bed in a panic and run to their crib to see if they were breathing.  It's tough, but somehow we got beyond the difficult times and now we have new things to be stressed about..:)  |`|HJNJCaFGaa	well, i think we all are. of course. but since i just answered your other question, i want to add that i guarantee your severe fear of it is part of your PPD. that's very common. as you have already said, if you know the causes, stop reading about it! :)<br>  there are not symptoms before hand.<br>  statistics will not make you feel better or worse -- really. please do yourself the favor of not tormenting yourself.<br>  that said, just be sure your baby sleeps on her back, that you don't use blankets or crib bumpers...you know all this. co-sleeping also reduces the chances and may alleviate some PPD symptoms as well.|`|yZ8fv8ozaa	I was paranoid about SIDS for both my boys!!<br>  I could barely sleep when they were new borns because I was up every 10 minutes checking there breathing!<br>  I think it is a totally normal thing for mothers to worry about that sort of thing..<br>  From what I know there are no symptoms to look for because they dont actually know the cause of it they just know how to reduce risk.<br>  You will eventually stop being so paranoid! I think it just comes with the territory of being a mother! and especially a new mother!!<br>  <br>  Enjoy motherhood!!!|`|0mcXVxt8aa	This won't help you, but yes, i was scared of that--then when they got older, I was scared about other things.  When they got old enough for school, i was scared that they would be abducted.  I used to hold on really hard when we went anywhere.  Now my kids are grown, and now I worry about my grandkids.<br>  <br>  It doesn't stop---it just becomes a different worry.<br>  <br>  Just do your very best.|`|5dRFku3Yaa	Omg yes!!! I sometimes jump up out of bed and make sure my son is breathing. He's 4 weeks today, and I have been like this since the day he was born. I always put him to sleep on his back, I nor my hubby smokes, and I breastfeed, and I try to do everything to reduce the risks, but I am constantly living in fear, making sure my son is breathing at all times of the day and night. I hope I can one day eventually get over this. Oh and by the way my older daughter is 7 and I still check her breathing too. Not as often, but when her allergies act up she has really bad congestion, so I always check on her too.|`|GK5uwBBdaa	my friends had a house fire and i stayed at a hotel with them after that , well ten days after the fire my friend woke me up screaming , their 3 month old died in his sleep! It was the worst day of my life now 7 years later i still think of it and check on my daughter constantly , she 2 now but it still scares me! now im 7 days away from my due date with my second and i know that onces she's here i'll be up all night checking on her. give your baby a pacifier. it reminds them to keep breathing in their sleep and always put your baby to bed on their back.|`|kPfnPbx1aa	It is normal to be very paranoid about SIDS.  We could barely sleep in the first month or so -constantly checking breathing every 10 minutes(which is not periodic in the first month anyway).<br>  <br>  We read all the research and did all the things to minimize the risk (have fan, back, no smoking, no objects, etc.). But the best investment that made (to reduce our paranoid) was the AngelCare movement & sound monitor.  It sounds alarm if does not detect movement in 40 seconds (i.e. baby stops breathing).  That way we didn't have to cehck breathing every 10 mins and finally get some sleep.<br>  <br>  Now at six months, we still have the Angelcare monitor and it works great.  Of course, it does nothing to prevent SIDS but it does everything for a little peace of mind.<br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|MtC3CWZraa	The “S” stands for sudden because there aren’t symptoms.<br>  <br>  No, I don’t fear it. What good would it do? It’s not something I can control so I make the best choices and hope for positive outcomes. I’m not going to give this much though unless Mother Nature forces me to do so. If it’s going to happen, it will occur whether I choose to worry or choose to be happy so I choose happy.<br>   <br>  |`|IDS64Eh8aa	There is no warning as far as I know, that's why it has "sudden" in the name. And yes, I've been worried ever since my daughter was born, that's why we ended up co-sleeping, I've become a very light sleeper and every little move or a change in her breathing wakes me up. There are always people who think that co-sleeping causes SIDS because parents can roll onto their baby etc, but that would actually be classified as smothering, nothing to do with SIDS (most cases of SIDS actually happen with babies sleeping alone in their own bedroom).

I'm guessing it was in the begining of March.<br>  <br>  Definitey go by the first date if it was based on an ultrasound.   If it was by LMP it would be less accurate.  As she get's further along, the dating will be less accurate.

Add two weeks, that makes it March 3 for conception date.  If he was with her on March 28th, it seems a little late to me.  Even if you go with Dec 10th as the due date, that makes about March 12th for date of conception.  <br>  <br>  I guess it's possible, but he should definately get a paternity test.|`|ZGXxP4vRaa	You already asked this question.  The due dates she gave are correct according to her LMP and she could have conceived then.  Just stop trying to make excuses for this guy and wait until the baby can be tested.

vue9NOhYaa	There is TONS of research on the benefits of breastfeeding.  It reduces the risk of dozens of diseases, ranging from common, usually-not-very-serious ones like ear infections and colds, to rare-and-potentially-deadly-ones like meningitis and childhood cancers.  There are also long-term health benefits.  Adults who were breastfed as children are less likely to develop diabetes, crohn's disease, and some other illnesses.  Mothers who breastfeed reduce their risk of breast and ovarian cancer. Suckling is good for baby's jaw, reducing the risk of malocclusion [braces], and the sugars in breastmilk rarely harm baby's teeth, so 'baby-bottle mouth' isn't usually an issue with a breastfed baby nursing at night. <br>  <br>  Breastfeeding appears to increase baby's IQ by 3-8 points (on average), and enhances bonding. <br>  <br>  (Now ... I'm sure that 50 people are going to give me thumbs down and scream that "I was formula fed and I'm smart ... and my child is formula fed and has NEVER had an ear infection or meningitis" -- these are all statistical averages, and don't necessarily apply to individual babies ... there is no way to 'prove' what might have happened to Baby X if she had been breastfeed rather than formula fed, or vice versa.)<br>  <br>  From a practical viewpoint, breastfeeding saves a LOT of money -- both directly (no formula to buy) and indirectly (lower medical costs, less laundry [spit-up breastmilk doesn stink or stain], later introduction of solid foods for most breastfed babies.  It's very convenient (once the early learning days are over) -- no bottles to wash or trips to the store, or wondering how to keep formula cold while you're out or warm it up -- just latch baby on wherever you happen to be. And most mothers love it.<br>  <br>  Breastfeeding can be difficult at first. We live in a society where few of us have ever seen a nursing mother, and where formula is the norm -- breastfeeding is usually viewed as a nice 'extra' ... if you can do it it may give baby some vague, undefined 'boost'.... but formula is really just as good, so if you don't want to or have trouble, 'breastfeeding isn't for everyone, and formula fed babies are just as healthy and smart.' So, the biggest problem you will face is lack of support -- friends, family and even your doctor may respond to problems with "You gave it a good try ... now here's some formula." But most women CAN breastfeed, with sufficient support and education. (There are dozens of good books on the market to provide that education.) So, the best strategy is to educate yourself, surround yourself as much as possible with supportive people, contact a lactation consultant if you have more than minor difficulties -- and commit to succeeding.  (Most women who 'fail' are either not knowlegable, or give up too quickly, or both.)<br>  <br>  But yes, you may be sore at first, and frustrated.  Both you and your baby will be learning a new skill, and it can take a little time.  But if you stick with it, you will both master that skill, and then breastfeeding is usually very easy and convenient -- and immeasurably beneficial to your baby.<br>  <br>  (Oh ... negatives --- besides the abovementioned early learning curve ... you are the only one who can feed your baby.  If you will want/need to be away from time to time, you'll need to pump and have the caregiver offer bottles.  Or, if necessary, you can supplement with the occassional bottle of formula (though even a few bottles may interfere with some of the benefits of breastmilk.)<br>  <br>  It's pretty time consuming, esp. at first. (But it's not really ' work' -- you are relaxing in a comfy chair with your baby.) Young babies nurse often -- typically 10-12 times a day at first. <br>  <br>  A very few babies are sensitive to something in mom's diet, so you may have to eliminate a food or two. (But, contrary to myth, there are no foods that you HAVE to eliminate routinely. Most babies aren't bothered by brocolli or chocolate or spices or garlic. Caffeine and alcohol in moderation are fine, as are most OTC and prescription drugs.)|`|ANHsv4ENaa	Breast feed babies statistically are healthier and smarter than formula fed babies. Formula is harder for a baby to digest and does not give them the same immunities as breast milk. Breast feeding also decreases your risk of cancer and helps you lose weight after giving birth as well as making your uterus shrink back to size faster. It helps you to bond with your baby and it's what the baby is designed to do so it's very comforting for them. It's free and you don't have to worry about buying formula or running out. Get the book The Womanly Art of Breast Feeding. It is very, very helpful. I would contact La Leche League in your area and set up a support system for after you give birth. Educate yourself and learn techniques and tricks to make breast feeding easier. YOU CAN DO IT!! Just have confidence in yourself and stick to it and don't give up. Make sure you have support and learn a lot so you know what's going on early. Women find it hard to breast feed because they didn't learn about it before the baby came and they don't know a lot and get discouraged. Check out some of these sites.|`|tZt7fUYYaa	Its beneficial because your milk contains antibodies to certain things and gives your baby a good immune system. Its a lovely bonding experience and so much easier and cheaper than formula feeding. Also you dont have to make up bottles at night. However it can be hard to begin with as you are both learning how to do it. Babies are born with a natural sucking reflex but that doesnt mean they will be able to do it straight of the bat. I had many tears with mine (her and me) until it was established. Once it is, its a breeze. I feed her at night and she goes back to sleep immediately whilst still eating and i am only half awake. Its tiring though as you are souly responsible for feeding unless you can express, my daughter was great at first and would take from the breast and the bottle. Now she doesnt want the bottle at all so its not always good to try both. I just did as i was getting stressed!!!! I would say though that the positives outweigh the negatives and you will be proud if you can keep it up. I know i am. 12 weeks and going strong. I love not spending ￡8 on formula...its lovely.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	Breastmilk provides everything your baby needs. Antibodies to protect your baby from illness, the perfect amount of fats/nutrients, and it automatically adjusts to how much your baby needs to eat. Not to mention it's gentle on the babies belly. The first few weeks of breastfeeding can be difficult, but if you stick with it I promise it gets easier!! Call your local hospital and see if they offer a breastfeeding class, they help a lot. Also ask if you can see a LC while in the hospital, or someone else trained to help with breastfeeding issues. You CAN do it!|`|kzt8Kdkfaa	In addition to all of the health benefits for both you and baby, there is also some piece of mind...you won't have to worry about bpa in bottles or melamine in formula or whatever current scare comes along with bottlefeeding.  You should see the questions on here on the days when those reports come out, while I feel for their panic, I am relieved that I don't even have to think twice about it!|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	this will give you lots of info on it<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.promom.org/101/" rel="nofollow">http://www.promom.org/101/</a><br>  <br>   breastfeeding cna be difficult but it will pass- if it hurt real bad then your baby is not latched on right. there really was no negatives for me|`|08GDBedGaa	breastfeeding is the one of the most natural acts of this world, your milk is specifically designed for your baby.  breast feeding is good for you too, helps your uterus shrink back down and can be a temporary contraceptive, also can help you lose the extra weight, but mainly the baby needs are met. It's a special bonding process there is so much goodness for baby everything this little human needs is in there, but alot of reasons people fail or do not choose to breastfeed is because of being misinformed of how to correctly breastfeed or/and  because of convenience, if you are choosing or having  to return to work quite soon, breastfeeding isn't always an option, it can be difficult and very tying, for instance you can not be too far from baby, for too long in the first 6 months, but i've been breastfeeding, my 6 month old daughter and i love it :)|`|GqsLNUE8aa	I'm sure you'll get lots of info about the physical/emotional benefits to both the child and you if you choose to breastfeed. I just wanted to add briefly that in the long run (after engorgement and leakage) breastfeeding is easier for you. In addition to never having to get out of bed (if you co-sleep) for night feedings, no warming, sterilizing or making up/packing up bottles you will also notice that your baby is much easier to soothe. All the babe will ever ever need to be calm and happy is the boob. That seriously makes your life easier. Not to mention you won't have to worry about things like allergies, asthma, diabetes type 1, obesity, failure to thrive, and colic. In general, your baby will be healthier and it is easier.<br>  <br>  haha briefly I said eh, guess I had more to say than I thought. BREASTFEED! you'll be proud ya did:)|`|8XcRFF6Taa	The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends breastfeeding for at least the first 12 months, The World Health Organizations recommends at least the first 2 years.  Research has shown that babies who are breastfed have higher IQ's, less susceptible to getting sick, lowers risk of SIDS(sudden infant death syndrome), lowers risk of high cholesterol and heart disease, less likely to deal with depression as an teen/adult, and many many other benefits.  Breastfeeding is hard work, pumping is even worse but its only for a year(or more) and really is the best start to your growing baby. Definitely worth it!!!  The most difficult time for some mothers is the beginning, you're new to breastfeeding and so is your baby.  While some infants have no problem nursing others need to help and patients to figure it out.  There are always lactation consultants eager to help:)  Your hospital will most likely have one.<br>  <br>  **Breastfeeding also burns up to 1,200 calories a day and it tightens your tummy(your uterus contracts after feedings) so it gets you bikini ready with out all the work of exercising and dieting:)<br>  <br>  Congratulations and good luck on breastfeeding!|`|311bce43c0d6a6dc9442d046a8943886aa	It isn't difficult at all! you just got to make sure the baby is latched on properly and you will not have any problems! breastfeeding is great, I formula fed my first two, and now breastfeeding my youngest! its the best decision i ever made, lol..i really wish i would have done this sooner for my other two...Breast milk has alot of nutrients that your baby needs to build their immune system..You also get more sleep when breastfeeding and a lot of bonding time..you dont have to get up in the middle of the night to make a bottle, your milk is all ready and warm for baby..They dont get sick as often and if they do end up catching a cold or something, it lasts only a couple days...breast milks also good for pink eye and boo-boos!...( weird but true) its also good for a lot of other things as well... i love it..when im breastfeeding my 4 month old, she will stop drinking and look up at  me with the biggest smile ever, lol...its the cutest thing ..|`|A7cZtZFyaa	The best thing you can do for yourself is learn what is normal and what when breastfeeding. Many women believe they don't have enough milk when their baby wants to feed what seems to be all day, and this is normal. It is very rare that you won't have enough milk for baby. You are right, breastfeeding will present challenges, but the best thing you can do is educate yourself about it.<br>  Breastfeeding is the best thing for baby for many, many reasons. The main reason is because human milk is what babies are made to eat. It is just what is meant to be.<br>  Breastfeed babies are one third less likely to die of SIDS.<br>  <a href="http://www.parentingweb.com/lounge/whybf.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.parentingweb.com/lounge/whybf...</a>|`|u1DDrXO2aa	<a href="http://www.fda.gov/opacom/lowlit/feedbby.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fda.gov/opacom/lowlit/feedbby...</a><br>  <br>  I do suggest it i wish that i would have breastfeed my son but i chose not to ..do you really know whats in formula im sure they dont tell you all of it but i mean obliviously they wouldnt give your child something that was not ok but there are a lot more benefits in giving them breast milk and you dont have to worry about the extra cost of formula and you loose your weight a lot faster when you do so..but thats a mothers choice your 18wks you should go to parenting classes and they will tell you all you need to know about both!!|`|BGcVEjfGaa	Breastfeeding is definitely the best option for your baby.  Not only has it come into light that it helps to prevent childhood obesity, it has also been shown to contain all the correct antibodies for a healthy immune system.  When you are sick, you can continue breastfeeding and it helps to keep the baby from getting sick as well (or at least getting as sick and he will get better faster) unlike formula, which doesn't protect him at all.  There are so many good reasons to breastfeed your baby.  Healthwise it is awesome but it also is a wonderful feeling to feed your baby this way.  I breastfed both of my children and the first one has yet to get very sick and he's almost 2.  My youngest one is very healthy at the moment, too and he is 7 months.  <br>  Breastfeeding is definitely NOT easy when you start out.  I remember crying out of frustration, and later, pain.  It does hurt your nipples quite a bit at first and I don't care what anyone says, the "let down" isn't a "tingling" sensation.  It can be very uncomfortable for the first few weeks.  But all of this fades and becomes easier.  There's awesome creams for the nipples and the letdown only lasts for a couple seconds.<br>  Another upside is that when you are traveling you don't have to worry about bottles, formula, warming the bottles, etc.   This is a real pain sometimes.  I know because I had to stop bf my first son at 7 months because I was pregnant with my second.  It is so much easier just to be able to grab a blanket, pull over, cover up, and feed your baby.<br>  Another HUGE plus, it helps you to lose the baby weight faster.<br>  The downsides are these, frustrating and painful at first, it does tend to make you more tired, and you shouldn't drink or smoke while breastfeeding your baby.  <br>  Honey, you will know when the time comes.  A lot of mothers do really well with bottle feeding.  It isn't a bad approach at all.  <br>  Don't stress out over it now.  When your baby is born I'm sure that the decision will be easy.<br>  The pros definitely outweigh the cons, but either way, the healthy baby is the most important factor and either option with accomplish that goal.  <br>  Congratulations and GOOD LUCK!  :)|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	There are NO benefits of breastfeeding, breastfeeding is the normal method of infant feeding against which other methods must be measured.<br>  <br>  There are, therefore, risks to not breastfeeding; and these risks are various depending on: <br>  *how you feed the baby: bottle, cup, SNS, etc<br>  *What you feed the baby: mom's own pumped milk, mom's own frozen milk, banked breast milk, donated breastmilk, cow's milk based formula, soy based formula, meat based formula, hydrolyzed infant formula, or elemental formula.<br>  <br>  Learning to breastfeed can be difficult, breastfeeding itself is not.  Just like learning to roller blade can be difficult but once you've mastered it its very easy.<br>  <br>  If you want to succeed at breastfeeding you should do two things:<br>  1) Educate yourself so you can avoid the common problems (like if a doctor says you should give your baby formula because they have jaundice you know to tell them they are ignorant)<br>  2) Spend time with moms who are nursing NOW.  The more you see breastfeeding the more likely you are to succeed.  The more support you have from people who breastfeed the more likely you are too succeed.<br>  <br>  La Leche League<br>  FREE in person breastfeeding support and meetings<br>  International: <a href="http://www.llli.org/webindex.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.llli.org/webindex.html</a><br>  USA: 1-877-4-LaLeche<br>  <br>  ----------<br>  Information is Your Ally in preparing to breastfeed:<br>  10 Tips for Success<br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/start/prepare/bf-preparation.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/start/prepare...</a><br>  <br>  -----------<br>  How to Know a Health Professional<br>  is not Supportive of Breastfeeding<br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/newman/18MD_unsupportive.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/newman/18MD_unsu...</a><br>  <br>  ---------<br>  <a href="http://www.bobrow.net/kimberly/birth/BFLanguage.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bobrow.net/kimberly/birth/BFL...</a><br>  "The truth is, breastfeeding is nothing more than normal. Artificial feeding, which is neither the same nor superior, is therefore deficient, incomplete, and inferior. These are difficult words, but they have an appropriate place in our vocabulary."<br>  <br>  The lactation consultant says, "You have the best chance to provide your baby with the best possible start in life, through the special bond of breastfeeding. The wonderful advantages to you and your baby will last a lifetime." And then the mother bottlefeeds. Why?<br>  <br>  In part because that sales pitch could just as easily have come from a commercial baby milk pamphlet. When our phrasing and that of the baby milk industry are interchangeable, one of us is going about it wrong...and it probably isn't the multinationals. Here is some of the language that I think subverts our good intentions every time we use it.<br>  <br>  Best possible, ideal, optimal, perfect. Are you the best possible parent? Is your home life ideal? Do you provide optimal meals? Of course not. Those are admirable goals, not minimum standards. Let's rephrase. Is your parenting inadequate? Is your home life subnormal? Do you provide deficient meals? Now it hurts. You may not expect to be far above normal, but you certainly don't want to be below normal.<br>  <br>  When we (and the artificial milk manufacturers) say that breastfeeding is the best possible way to feed babies because it provides their ideal food, perfectly balanced for optimal infant nutrition, the logical response is, "So what?" Our own experience tells us that optimal is not necessary. Normal is fine, and implied in this language is the absolute normalcy--and thus safety and adequacy--of artificial feeding. The truth is, breastfeeding is nothing more than normal. Artificial feeding, which is neither the same nor superior, is therefore deficient, incomplete, and inferior. Those are difficult words, but they have an appropriate place in our vocabulary.<br>  <br>  Advantages. When we talk about the advantages of breastfeeding--the "lower rates" of cancer, the "reduced risk" of allergies, the "enhanced" bonding, the "stronger" immune system--we reinforce bottlefeeding yet again as the accepted, acceptable norm.<br>  <br>  Health comparisons use a biological, not cultural, norm, whether the deviation is harmful or helpful. Smokers have higher rates of illness; increasing prenatal folic acid may reduce fetal defects. Because breastfeeding is the biological norm, breastfed babies are not "healthier;" artificially-fed babies are ill more often and more seriously. Breastfed babies do not "smell better;" artificial feeding results in an abnormal and unpleasant odor that reflects problems in an infant's gut. We cannot expect to create a breastfeeding culture if we do not insist on a breastfeeding model of health in both our language and our literature.<br>  <br>  We must not let inverted phrasing by the media and by our peers go unchallenged. When we fail to describe the hazards of artificial feeding, we deprive mothers of crucial decision-making information. The mother having difficulty with breastfeeding may not seek help just to achieve a "special bonus;" but she may clamor for help if she knows how much she and her baby stand to lose. She is less likely to use artificial milk just "to get him used to a bottle" if she knows that the contents of that bottle cause harm. <br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>  Inverting reality becomes even more misleading when we use percentages, because the numbers change depending on what we choose as our standard. If B is 3/4 of A, then a is 4/3 of B. Choose A as the standard, and B is 25% less. Choose B as the standard, and A is 33 1/3% more. Thus, if an item costing 100 units is put on sale for "25% less,"the price becomes 75. When the sale is over, and the item is marked back up, it must be marked up 33 1/3% to get the price up to 100. Those same figures appear in a recent study (3), which found a "25% decrease" in breast cancer rates among women who were breastfed as infants. Restated using breastfed health as the norm, there was a 33-1/3% increase in breast cancer rates among women who were artificially fed. Imagine the different impact those two statements would have on the public.<br>  <br>  -------<br>  101 Reasons to breastfeed<br>  <a href="http://www.promom.org/101/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.promom.org/101/index.html</a><br>  <br>  -------<br>  Breastfeeding prevents cancer<br>  <a href="http://www.prematureoptimism.com/linkBlog/?p=14" rel="nofollow">http://www.prematureoptimism.com/linkBlo...</a>
3RWbAyyUaa	here are some tips from www.keepkidshealthy.com:<br>  <br>  Four to Five Months <br>  <br>  At this age, breast milk or formula is the only food that your baby needs and he should be taking 4-6 feedings each day (24-32 ounces), but you can start to familiarize your baby with the feel of a spoon and introduce solid foods. Cereal is the first solid you should give your baby and you can mix it with breast milk, formula or water and feed it to your baby with a spoon (not in a bottle). Start by feeding one tablespoon of an iron-fortified Rice cereal at one feeding and then slowly increase the amount to 3-4 tablespoons one or two times each day. <br>  <br>   <br>  Six to Seven Months <br>  <br>  While continuing to give 4-5 feedings of breast milk or formula (24-32 ounces) and 4 or more tablespoons of cereal each day, you can now start to give well-cooked, strained, or mashed vegetables or commercially prepared baby foods. Start with one tablespoon of a mild tasting vegetable, such as green beans, peas, squash or carrots and gradually increase to 4-5 tablespoons one or two times each day. <br>  Start fruits about a month after starting vegetables and again, gradually increase to 4-5 tablespoons one or two times each day. You can use peeled, cooked, or canned fruits (but only those packed in light syrup or water) that have been blenderized or strained<br>  <br>  You can also begin to offer 2-4 ounces of 100% fruit juices. Start by mixing one part juice with two parts of water and offer it in a cup.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>   <br>  Eight to Nine Months <br>  While continuing to give 3-4 feedings of breast milk or formula (24-32 ounces) and 4 or more tablespoons of cereal, vegetables and fruit one or two times each day, you can now start to give more protein containing foods. These include well-cooked, strained or ground plain meats (chicken, beef, turkey, veal, lamb, boneless fish, or liver), mild cheese, peanutbutter (this is controversial though), or egg yolks (no egg whites as there is a high chance of allergic reactions in infants less than 12 months old). If using commercially prepared jars of baby food, do not use vegetables with meat as they have little meat and less protein and iron than jars with plain meat. <br>  Start with 1-2 tablespoons and increase to 3-4 tablespoons once each day. If your baby doesn't seem to like to eat plain meat, then you can mix it with a vegetable that they already like as you offer it.<br>  <br>  You can also start to offer soft table foods and finger foods at this age. Give soft, bite-size pieces of food, such as soft fruit and vegetable pieces, pastas, graham or saltine crackers, and dry cheerios, but do not give these foods if the child is going to be unattended in case of choking.<br>  <br>  You can also begin to offer 3-4 ounces of formula or 100% fruit juice in a cup at this time.<br>  <br>   <br>  |`|5674af22a90ad20c6b854d7b715cd54eaa	I started at 6 months with lunch, just vegetables and sometimes fruit. At 7 months I added dinner, by then she was eating more so I usually did vegetables and fruit. At 8 months (just three days ago) I added breakfast and she has oatmeal with fruit mixed in. By now she has a pincer grasp and all of that so she can eat cheerios and things like that for snacks and plain pasta/cubed vegetables for dinner. I give her a sippy cup with water every meal and she takes as much as she wants. I also feed her a bottle 3-4 times a day, whenever she wants and as much as she wants. |`|crspNObZaa	liam was growing so fast that the dr. suggested food at four months for me. he gets baby cereal in the morning and a container of gerber organics stage one for lunch and a container for dinner. he is also breastfed after each feeding and once in between each one. he is not fat, but rather long and very lean, he gets enough breastmilk, when i pump i get about 4oz each side, so he just needs more....|`|HKEywfRkaa	I started giving my son gel fruits at 4 months. He was still on 4-5 bottles a day. By 6 months he had cut himself down to 3 bottles and was eating at breakfast, lunch and dinner, with dessert. I gave him kids weet-bix for breakfast, pasta with sauce for lunch and heaps of different mashed vegies with diced bacon pieces and/or diced chicken for dinner with pureed fruit salad for dessert. He started on small size jars for all meals but soon let me know (through whinging!!) when he was hungry for more!<br>  Just a tip, keep the old jars so you can make and freeze your own food in perfect portion sizes. It saves so much money and is so much better for them! |`|a4a2BKHAaa	you should be giving her breakfast, lunch and diner. try and feed her table food right from the start. you can get some tips at <a href="http://www.learning-graph.com/recipes.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.learning-graph.com/recipes.ht...</a>

Un petit tour dans le rayon jouet avec elle vous permettra d'apprécier son enthousiasme par rapport à ce fameux Oui-oui.

Quand on me raconte que poussinette se promène partout et se mets debout tout le temps et s'amuse à se lacher, à 9 mois, c'est normal, elle le fait aussi à la maison.<br>  Quand on me dit que bilou a fait le zouave toute la journée à l'école, c'est normal aussi.<br>  C'est plutot quand on me dit que mes enfants sont sages et obé?ssants que je suis étonnée! LOL|`|XWQgoFbcaa	oui c'est une vrai fayotte ,moi je dit vaut mieux qu'il soit calme chez les autres sinon on va te dire<br>  hooo infernal la gamine ,finalement c'est pas plus mal, bon c'est sur pourquoi elle n'est pas comme ca chez toi???!!!!!<br>  <br>  je crois qu'ils sont tous pareil..................<br>  moi c'est la sieste ,avec son pere ,elle est interminable ,voir je m'inquiete car avec moi c'est rare qu'on depasse 1h00............|`|b2328b56b35b6fc7f6b91616282a1554aa	bein, moi, je pense que très t?t, ils comprennet à qui ils peuvent faire tout voir et avec qui il faut qu'ils soient plus sages!<br>  Et maman fait malheureusement parti des gens avec qui on peut se lacher à priori d'après nos diablotins!|`|e6zZEQq0aa	En même temps, il vaut mieux que ce soit dans ce sens là : toute calme et cool à l'extérieur et petit monstre à la maison...<br>  Imagines si tu voyais ta fille super mignone à ma maison et que le personnel de la petite enfance te décrive une mini-tornade....y'aurait de quoi être vexée.|`|gdevokYoaa	moi je n'ai jamais douté ?a de la ptite clémence<br>  roo la la !!|`|29ac5e1374fbe3a0cd97c10e85591a36aa	Oui tout le temps, moi quand j'écoute ma nounou mon fils est obéissant (oui mais faut lui répéter 3 fois non), mange de tout (hum hum) et ne pleure jamais (?a c'est vrai). <br>  <br>  Par contre pour les bêtises là je le reconnais bien, dernièrement elle avait caché un oeuf au chocolat dans son lit et avait oublié de le retirer, mon fils l'a retrouvé à son réveil (et c'était un gros oeuf) et s'en est régalé, il en a d'ailleurs fait profiter les murs, les draps, le sol, etc.... Et ma nounou qui se disait c'est bizarre il dort plus que d'habitude. Ben tiens !|`|W5DGwzCRaa	Peut-être qu'elle est complètement différente avec les autres...<br>  Ce serait quand même très étonnant.

Mouais, c'est ?a, à d'autre! Du haut de ses 3mois, je peux vous dire qu'elle en a du caractère ma puce, et ses braillements, j'y ai droit toute la journée...<br>  <br>  Comme quoi, nos gosses nous en font parfois voir de toutes les couleurs, mais chez les autres, de vrais petits anges. Rassure toi, ?a veut dire que tu fais du bon boulot et que oui, ta fille sera sans doute une petite fayotte!|`|iyhqeD5caa	oué, tout le temps ;)<br>  <br>  il parait que c'est bon signe comme quoi ton enfant a bien compris ce qui se faisait et ne se faisait pas mais qu'il se permet de se lacher avec toi parce qu'il a confiance en ton amour inconditionnel ;)|`|da3c1a3e6e6a6ffd29819b3832af687eaa	lol Parfois oui, quand je parle de leurs enfants aux mamans elles ont l'impression que je leur parle d'une autre, et inversement!|`|KNnurBKraa	Que veux tu, nos cher(e)s chérubin(e)s savent qu'ils preuvent abuser de leurs parents...|`|64a9196b651e584bb14079942e61227caa	Vaut mieux ?a plut?t qu'on te dise : et bien il est terrible en ce moment il ne fait que des bêtises (oui ben à la maison aussi on a bien le même quoi ;-)<br>  <br>  <br>  Bon je plaisante, avec mes petits c'est plut?t assez égal entre la crèche et la maison mais pour mon ainé...

vue9NOhYaa	Some women continue to make small amounts of milk for many years after giving birth.  It's not a concern.<br>  <br>  If, however, you dried up and have just recently started producing milk again, you would want to check with your doctor.  Breast discharge can be a symtoms of a medical problem.|`|AA12032374	that did happen to me, my milk was still producing after 6 months, not as long as yours. I went to the DR and he prescribed a pill (can't remember the name, as it was many years ago) that helped. It stopped the production of milk after taking just one pill. I then breast fed my second child and when I stopped, it only took 2 weeks for the milk to stop. My best advise for you is to go to the DR and discuss this issue, they will be able to help|`|T2BEuG5maa	Your milk should have dried up a long time ago. The longest I have heard of someone keeping it is about 5 months. You should see a doctor. It could just be that your body is still producing the hormone that is making you think that you need to nurse. It could be a simple matter fo taking a pill to counteract the hormone.|`|Fy9S6hjIaa	Even people who have never had children lactate occasionally.  It has to do with hormones. I wouldn't worry about it as long as its just sometimes and isn't a large amount.|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	I agree with the first poster.  It is probably hormonal.  I had my last child five and a half years ago, and my milk has been gone since he was just a few months old since I never breast fed him.  See your doctor.
AA12192295	I think that kinda sucks for the kids. When your little, your birthday is the only day that is all yours. For me it was the one day my brother couldn't take away from and all the attention was on me. I just think it might take some of the special feel out of it for the kids.|`|MXXOICquaa	my mom and her sister have the same birthday except a year apart and their dads is the day before theres its alot easier for the kids to remember birthdays when they are like that|`|721055bb4f4a90cbc769262d4684a39daa	You might think its cool but your kids are going to hate sharing a birthday growing up! Your birthday is supposed to be YOUR special day where the focus is on you! I don't think your kids will like it.|`|jwsba3qAaa	cool for you, not so cool for them<br>  <br>  but super cool cause that's my birthday too =)<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|lLnB9mwtaa	Its cool in the parent's place but in the place of the child, it sucks because you should own your birthday,,,|`|21d5c68986f5b4adce3681da769878cfaa	congratulations,having a baby is cool in itself|`|OMTSqrSFaa	wow thats brill xx|`|ph4DLp3Baa	I'd hate to have the same birthday as my brother!!!

48a21bc4a622371e98beb983ee0cf2b1aa	il reste encore un danger car à 3 mois ton fils ne sait pas encore mettre ET enlever volontairement son doudou de son visage. Si il en a besoin pour s'endormir alors laisse lui le temps de sombrer au pays des rêves et dès qu'il dort tu le pousses hors de portée pour être tranquille.<br>  <br>  moi j'ai plus de chance ce genre de doudou il en a, il aime bien lui aussi se colle ?à sur la figure mais pour dormir je lui enlève et ?à ne lui pose pas de problème.|`|3Hv93bewaa	tu peut tout simplement attendre qu il s endorme et lui retiré si cela peut te rassuré ou alors  attaché le <doudou> au barreau de son lit comme cela des que ton petit bout de chou bougeras il n enmenneras pas son doudou avec lui <actuce personnelle> bisous a junior|`|6ayGMDtvaa	ma pepette a 4 mois et demi et elle a son  doudou, moitié peliche, moitié tissus!!  elle le met également sur son visage, le serre et s'endort!<br>  <br>  moi ce que je fais je le lui maisse et quand elle dort , je lui enlève, je ne pense pas que cela risque quelque chose mais moi je dors mieux!!! lol|`|TyervaEsaa	oui si le doudou est plus grand que le ptit boutchou|`|ZhH1bQ22aa	Oui moi je le dirai car je suis un secouriste et l'enfant surtout un bébé a besoin de l'air et non de sn gaz carbonique donc évite le ses genres d'actes looooooooooooooh|`|4ddb7dc3bad2af6ce8ddfef10bacaa25aa	Ma fille a un t-shirt avec mon odeur à la crèche (depuis ses 3 mois) mais à la maison aucun tissu dans son lit. Par contre elle a une peluche, moins dangereux à mon go?t. Tu ne veux pas essayer de l'habituer à autre chose que tu trouverais moins "dangereux" ?|`|6R8t1Stgaa	Faut pas exagérer... Au risque, vous lui "présentez" un nouveau doudou (en forme de peluche) et vous remplacez l'ancien progressivement.<br>  <br>  On a jamais vu un doudou empecher un bébé de respirer. Le seul risque pourrait être l'étranglement avec, par exemple, la queue du doudou. Mais faut arrêter de voir des risques partout, sinon vous allez finir par rester à coté de votre bébé 24h / 24...<br>  <br>  Dans l'absolu, y'a aucune solution : si le doudou est trop petit, y'a risque que le bébé l'avale, et s'il est trop gros, y'a risque d'étouffement.|`|Yp1eMpwnaa	En principe, les doudous sont soumis à des normes, donc je ne pense pas que le tissu soit asssez épais et le doudou assez large pour que bébé s'étouffe. <br>  <br>  Mais si tu tiens vraiment à te rassurer, tente de faire un noeud à son doudou, au milieu, si bébé l'accepte comme ?a, ?a t'aidera peut-être à te rassurer...|`|cUZo5NJSaa	Il faut faire attention car ton bébé est encore petit et il ne maitrise pas tous ses gestes.<br>  Essaye de lui proposer un vrai doudou, avec lequel il n'y aura aucun risque.<br>  Et puis ?a t'évitera de t'inquiéter et tu seras plus sereine...|`|qjK7OQo8aa	Il est important de ne pas habitué votre enfant à avoir un doudou; vous connaitrez l'horreur si votre enfant le perd. là c'est l'enfer. Néanmoins d'un point de vu sécurité vérifiez bien la norme sur l'étiquette, normalement il n'y a pas de problèmes mais on ne sait jamais.|`|3904fbf005e6b4c5209f593b2033a295aa	tu as raison de te méfier, mon bébé a réussi à risquer de s'étouffer avec des trucs soumis aux normes<br>  du coup, je suis très vigilante

VYPblEgnaa	OMG pleeeaaassseeee dont give out any personal information or anything.....and please whatever u do dont call him....tell your parents and let them deal with it......ive been there except i thought i liked the guy when i was younger (12) and he was trying to get me to come to him because he was one of those guys that "pimp" young girls out. PLEASE steer clear of him....delete him if he hasnt made any real threats.....i mean he doesnt kno where u r right? anything like that? and by the way if he does make real threats print them off and contact your police. seriously the internet is NOTHING to play with. I know first hand....a lot of bad things happened when i was dealing with a similar prob.....please b careful|`|AOqNb4J2aa	Heya tell her to delate him again and to block him from her profile so he cant get back on and leave comments.tell her its not going to make a ifferene ether hes on or not cause e still cant send her a message if she blocks in.|`|QJf2XNaTaa	Tell her to delete him! If she doesn't, log in on her account and delete it. Call the police if he does anything again.|`|4NNjT8yhaa	JUST DELETE HIM!!!!!! NOW FOR YOUR OWN SAKE!!!! DO IT and tell ur friend to stop being so stupid if he wants her number etc he probably doesn't know anything about her. DELETE HIM!|`|EZMkioAgaa	Tell him you're going to ask your uncle about him..o yeah..ur uncles a cop...then delete him..|`|Jo8nlGVsaa	Honestly the best thing to do is to tell her parents, even if you think they'd get mad. This guy could be a killer, or a rapist. Its a really serious thing, and if you don't want your friend to get hurt tell someone. I know you two are young and the Internet is newer to you. I have dealt with people like this before, one which ended up being a listed sex offender. Encourage your friend to keep all personal information off the site, delete yours if it'll make her delete hers. Good Luck|`|ObuVZwgwaa	Firstly the obvious answer is jus delete him. <br>  Some people are logged onto the internet even when they arent at their computer. And who cares if he notices shes deleted him i bet hes doing it to a cuple of other ppl and wnt worry about it. <br>  <br>  Secondly save all of the messages he sends this way if he ever makes any contact by phone, post or actually meets u or stalks u u have evidence showing that he has threatened u and stuff.<br>  <br>  Tell ur parents. Please. For her own saftey u have to tell some sort of adult even if its a teacher or w.e.<br>  <br>  And, if she doesn't delete him after hes being all pervy then she obviously likes the attention<br>  <br>  x|`|bDCS9KxDaa	i'd say delete him now.<br>  and don't ever talk to him again.<br>  <br>  he seems like a freak, and the more you talk to him the more interested he gets.<br>  <br>  it doesn't matter if he's online or not, delete him. if he still doesn't leave you alone, i'd suggest your friend delete her account.|`|cldZlGM2aa	you do realise you can keep yourself signed in for 2 weeks non-stop, even when you're computer is off it will say you're online? thats what he's done. and if you delete him, he won't be able to say anything else to him, he wont be able to get in touch with you again so just delete him for crying out loud. you can report him and block him as well.|`|cbp7Gukbaa	Just delete him for gods sake.Have you ever heard of a peadophile? Get away from him.Are you guys silly or what?|`|387f6c8511dc708488cdb19cf6a783daaa	Don't they have a 'report abuse' type button on there? If they do then just report him and they will delete him. Don't, under any circumstances give him any of your or your friend's personal details. He cannot trace either of you so just be bold and DELETE the creep, without telling your friend if necessary. It is people like him that wreck lives and seduce young girls. He is probably about 50yrs old with smelly breath Ughh. Delete him NOW.|`|hGY08GjRaa	I like the suggestion about the uncle cop.. but I'll go one better<br>  <br>  Tell him "I TOLD my cop uncle about you and he says I should delete you and never talk to you again. So, bye."|`|rB3cyt0Paa	tell your friend to..<br>  <br>  1. Delete the dude<br>  2. Cancel her account<br>  3. Report this guy to the website|`|CZ3gQoIZaa	Just delete him! He can't do anything. And who cares if he notices?<br>  The other thing is, if she's 13 and has Bebo, she isn't aloud! This is why!!!<br>  And tell your parents, or she should tell hers, because then you hae adults to help you out and you know he can't do anything since you have parents backing you up.<br>  Next time. DONT make an acount on the internet. You should take this a  lesson. <br>  <br>  EDIT: or at least where people can add you, see pictures and personal info.|`|KSfK4qR1aa	tell her to delete him and there is no way anything else will happen,<br>  <br>  shes on an internet cafe when accepted so he cant chase an IP address.<br>  <br>  aswell as this peedos are to thick to even hide the porn on there pc let alone track some1 down.<br>  <br>  im a college student studying IT and if she deleted him the odds of ever finding even what country shes in is phenominally low even to a genious.<br>  <br>  the second you delete him hell just move onto some other girl who should do exaclty the same, i cant believe she hasnt just deleted him.<br>  <br>  he cant do anything through bebo anyway even if you message him abuse first, all he can do is type things to her, if she ends up in danger its causes shes done it herself, shes got the chance to get out now!
69167cdc9a56adbef31bad1056b17fd0aa	Tout d'abord pour obtenir l'agrément : il faut appeler la PMI donc tu dépends, ils te convoqueront a une réunion d'information (expliquant ce qu'est le métier d'assmat etc...) après cette réunion tu iras retirer un dossier de demande d'agrément. Tu le rempliras et fourniras les docs demandés, passer une visite médical, il faut soit le rapporter contre un certificat de dép?t, ou l'envoyer par recommandée AR. Ton dossier sera examiné, ils ont 3 mois pour le faire a partir de la date de dép?t du dossier complet. Tout dossier incomplet retardera l'obtention de l'agrément.<br>  <br>  Tu recevras la visite d'une puéricultrice et/ou assistante sociale, qui viendra pour visiter ton logement, voir si les conditions d'accueil sont bonnes (hygiène, grandeur du logement, matériels de puer, sécurité etc...) elle te posera des questions sur ta fa?on de pratiquer ce métier (que feras tu si un enfant ne veut pas manger, s'il s'est blessé, les soins, les repas etc....) ainsi que sur les relations que tu auras avec les parents. Elle te demandera aussi comment ca se passe avec tes enfants (si tu en as) et si ton mari accepte ta décision de faire ce métier.<br>  <br>  Une fois que tu recevras ton agrément, tu devras faire une première formation (avant de pouvoir accueillir des enfants) de 60 heures (c'est le conseil général qui s'en occupe et te convoqueront).

Ensuite dans les 5 ans tu feras le reste de cette formation 60 heures.<br>  <br>  Un agrément n'est valable que 5 ans, après il faudra faire une demande de renouvellement.<br>  <br>  Pour le nombre d'enfants, cela dépend de la grandeur du logement (si chambre pour les petits, et coin pour le jeu etc....).

Iq0Z1uEGaa	Je pense que la régression et la jalousie sont normales. Il a s?rement l'impression que son petit frère monopolise l'attention, le temps et l'amour de ses parents.<br>  <br>  Je peux te conseiller d'essayer d'organiser des moments avec lui seul (si c'est possible), des moments pendant lesquels tu joues avec lui, .... <br>  <br>  Favorises aussi les moments calins et ne te lasses pas de lui répéter que tu l'aimes toujours autant, que ton coeur est assez grand pour 2 amours, sans en baisser un en faveur de l'autre, dis lui que tu l'aimes jusqu'au bout du monde, jusqu'au ciel.....<br>  Essayes aussi de l'impliquer dans la vie de son petit frère, aider au bain, au repas.... il va adorer !<br>  <br>  Je comprends que quand il est pénible, fatigué, ... c'est pas facile et qu'on a plus envie de s'éloigner pour souffler mais c'est justement la qu'il faut prendre sur soi et s'en rapprocher.<br>  <br>  Bon courage, ?a va passer !<br>  <br>  rajout : j'ai oublié ! ce conseil vaut aussi et surtout pour papa !|`|da3c1a3e6e6a6ffd29819b3832af687eaa	Je te détaillerai tout en privé, mais je pense toujours qu'il est jaloux et je pense aussi qu'il a besoin d'autorité, et il la cherche même là où il y en a moins.|`|ZhH1bQ22aa	Ne t'inquiète pas car se sont les caprices des enfants et je crois qu'il est jaloux aussi de son frère mais il faut vous deux le papa et toi vous puissiez donner les mêmes éducations aux enfants si papa dit quelque chose, il ne faut pas que maman dit le contraire et tout marchera sans problème dans votre foyer|`|7VYJ63hAaa	Ton fils à un problème de jalousie, il pense que vous l'avez délaisser pour son frère et que toute l'attention de la famille est orienter vers le nouveau venu, son frère à envahit son milieu de vie, et pense qu'il va le détr?ner de son prestige, alors il manifestait  tout ?a par des crises de colère, jalousie etc;..<br>  <br>  Je te conseille, de lui montrer beaucoup d'intérêts même plus que son frère, et essayer de lui faire comprendre qu'il est ton petit chéri, avec des calins, des bisous, etc..<br>  <br>  Fais lui partager certaines taches concernant le nouveau né en lui demandant gentiment de t'aider à  lui donner son bain , à le changer, à lui donner à manger, en lui parlant  d'un air doux , gentil, en le responsabilisant ne cessant de lui rappeler qu'il est l'aine et que tu compte sur lui pour prendre soin de  son petit frère.|`|GtXS4eaOaa	le papa travaillant et ayant peu de temps, il doit surement favoriser les échanges avec le petit dernier, non?toi tu es disponible pour les 2, donc pas de problème pour le grand, il trouve sa place! pour la régression, c'est pareil, le petit frére est venu lui piquer sa place!<br>  tout comme le père qui rentre le soir ( Oedipe!)!<br>  par contre pour l'école, à savoir quand ses troubles du comportement ont réellement commencé???|`|Q0DqzjiSaa	régression et jalousie sont des comportements normaux à l'arrivée d'un rival...<br>  On est passé à coté, ouf mais voilà comment... Maintenant, je suis persuadée que c'est aussi un grand coup de chance!<br>  1. Bilou a toujours été très impliqué dans ma grossesse. Il l'a su avant tout le monde, dès qu'on lui a dit, il a eu un lit de grand, un rehausseur dans la voiture, il devait faire attention à maman (car décollement important de l'oeuf), ect... Les inconvénients du bébé ont rapidement été là et comme je devais me reposer, je m'en suis moins occupée durant la grossesse, d'où peu de changements pour lui à l'arrivée de sa petite soeur.<br>  Il nous a aidés à choisir la liste de naissance, les faire-parts....<br>  2. c'est une petite soeur... J'ai l'impression qu'il l'a bien prit car ce sont des sexes différents. Donc moins de rivalité. En prime, en tant que grand frère, il est très attentif à sa soeur!<br>  3. Poussinette a apporté un cadeau à son grand frère à la naissance. Et Bilou fut le premier à venir la voir à la maternité. Elle était dans son berceau et je me suis occupée de lui pendant plusieurs minutes avant de lui montrer sa soeur.<br>  4. Nous lui avons donné des responsabilités de grand! Il peut lui donner le biberon, la purée, nous aide pour la laver, la changer... En prime, il va à la piscine (c'est pour les grands, poussinette ne peut pas encore y aller), a des activités où elle ne peut pas le suivre. Donc, il est grand. Il y a des avantages et des inconvénients à être l'ainé mais on met l'accent sur les avantages. <br>  <br>  Voilà, ?a marche à merveille chez nous. Bilou est fou de Poussinette. Il s'en occupe très bien. Il n'y a pas de jalousie. Il joue avec elle, lui explique pleins de choses. Quand elle était nouveau-née, et qu'elle pleurait, il lui chantait des chansons, lui "lisait" des histoires...<br>  <br>  Bilou aura 4 ans fin du mois et poussinette aura à ce moment là 10 mois.<br>  <br>  Je pense que si ton fils est infernal dès le retour de son père, c'est parce qu'il veut attirer son attention. Quelle est la réaction de ton mari quand il rentre? Il va directement vers le petit frère? Si oui, qu'il essaie de focaliser son attention vers le grand, lui demander de raconter sa journée avant d'aller voir le bébé...<br>  Pour l'école, je pense que c'est également une fa?on d'attirer votre attention. Il sait que ?a vous inquiète et donc, il s'en sert.<br>  <br>  Si tu sens que c'est nécéssaire, n'hésite pas à faire appel à un psy. Il n'y a aucune honte à cela. Il faut savoir se faire aider quand on est dépassé.<br>  <br>  Courage et gros bisous!|`|AOZLxrSzaa	Bonjour,<br>  <br>  Votre enfant a un comportement difficile?<br>  Voici enfin une méthode étonnamment simple, con?ue par un psychologue, une méthode pratique en 10 jours pour en finir avec les troubles du comportement chez l'enfant!<br>   Voici le lien pour télécharger cette méthode:<br>  <a href="http://go.philipe.dlambertpsy.1.1tpe.net/" rel="nofollow">http://go.philipe.dlambertpsy.1.1tpe.net...</a><br>  <br>  Bonne lecture

f3Oqi21paa	Onesie Pictures - Buy packets of onesies that total the number of guests you'll have at the shower along with glitter glue and hand them out to your guests. Have everyone draw a picture on the onesies and then have the mom-to-be vote on her favorite. That person wins a prize, and the mom-to-be gets to keep all the onesies. <br>  <br>  Advice for Years Ahead -Have every one draw a # from a bowl (as many numbers as there are guests--mom and hostess too starting with 0 for the birth day). The # represented the future age of the baby and give every one a piece of pretty paper and a matching envelope and have then write a letter to the baby at that age. No one is aloud to read it. They were sealed and given to my mom to open on future birthdays. They can included everything from advice to funny stories about the new mommy. <br>  <br>  Race to dress & hand the mother her baby - First you must have 2 of each of the following items, live size baby dolls, diapers, blankets, baby hats, baby T- shirt, baby socks, shoes, baby bibs, pants or jumpers., baby bottles or pacifiers, & 2 baskets. You will need a stop watch. Fill the baskets with 1 of each item, and one dolls. Place them at different tables and have each player stand by there basket, set the stop watch at 0, then on your mark say GO. Have 2 players at a time race to dress the dolls have them stand at the same distance from the mother... Player who takes the baby fully dressed and wrapped in it's blanket and with the bottle to the mother wins, Stop the watch and write her name and time down, then you can do the next 2 players. If you have 10 or more guest and they all want a chance at it then who ever has the less time monitored by you wins. This turns out to be very funny when you see them toss and slam those baby dolls around, to do it as fast as they can!<br>  <br>  “Who Am I?” is another fun party game. Before the party, print out a list of famous people. As each guest arrives, pin a name to their back. Their job is to figure out who they are. They can ask each other guest just 3 questions, and they cannot ask a question like “who am I.” The questions must be able to have a “yes” or a “no” answer. When you give instructions, give them some sample questions such as “Am I male or female?” and “Am I dead or alive?”<br>  <br>  This next game takes some legwork ahead of time, but is well worth it. Before the shower, ask your guests to bring a baby picture of themselves. Once they arrive, arrange the pictures on a particle board, and label each photo with a number. Provide a sheet that the guests can fill out, trying to match the guest name with the number. The winner (or winners) receive a door prize.<br>  <br>  For “The Composer” you will divide everyone into several groups of at least 4 people. Give each group a classic children’s song, such as “I’ve been working on the Railroad,” “home on the range,” “twinkle twinkle,” etc. Each group should rewrite the lyrics to the classic song, with the mom-to-be, her partner, and her baby in mind. After a few minutes, each group should sing their song for the mom-to-be.|`|sFNNDqhGaa	one way to approach this is to look for a game where you can take 50 and turn them into 7 - 10 teams of 5 to 7 people. <br>  <br>  Then make the games more difficult, by adding a few extra challenges. <br>  Example instead of handing 1 baby trivia game the the group. hand out a trivia challenge, a word Scrabble and a who knows the mommy to each group. They can divide the challenges amongst them selves or work as a team.

The large the group the the faster you loose their attention.

Focus on the Mom and let the guests mingle. <br>  <br>  Good luck - Sarah|`|dnAIE30waa	We just hosted a co-ed baby shower in August and the games were a bust. Everyone was busy talking and the guys eating, that no one was really interested in the games. Is this baby shower co-ed? If so maybe skip the games. If it is just women then maybe do some games. The one thing we did was have everyone (who wants to participate) bring a pack of diapers. Numbers were put onto the diapers and given to the person who brought them. We put all the packs of diapers into a pack n play and pulled out packs of diapers for door prizes. Bingo is fun sometimes, There is a game where people empty their lose change into a piggy bank for the baby. The guests guess how much money was collected and the closest person wins a gift but the money in the bank goes to the baby,again (just lose change) no one will go broke.|`|J9W2LXzCaa	 I had lots of people at my shower too and these are some of the ones we did that were my favorite. You can set up a pool on how big the baby will be or what day it is born or at what time. You can give everyone a few safety pins to wear and every time someone says baby the person that notices it takes a pin from them and pins it on their shirt. The person at the end of the baby shower that has the most pins wins. You can also melt mini chocolate bars into baby diapers and have everyone guess which one is which. Also you can give them a pad of paper and have them work out how many words they can spell from baby shower and whichever team had the most wins. Also if she is still pregnant you can have everyone guess how many sheets of toilet paper it will take to wrap around her tummy and the one closets wins. My favorite that we did at my shower was a scavenger hunt. My mother in law stuck all kinds of baby related items around the house and divided people into teams then she sent them around to look for all the items with certain clues they had. The first one to find them all won. You can also set up two tables at the front of the room and have a competition where you blindfold two teams and line them up at each table. You the have two baby dolls that both have mud (pudding) all over them two wash bins with water a diaper baby powder clothes and a bottle all in a row and set a timer. You then put each blind folder person in front of a station and say go to see who's team can get the baby undressed bathed dried off new diaper with powder clothed and fed first all while not being able to see whichever team does it first and the baby looks halfway normal wins. you can either give away prizes then or you can compete the winning teams against each other until there is only one winning team. Its kinda messy but a lot of fun. Good luck and I hope you have fun.|`|4b05658f9b80d400cfc53e2ea5ecf209aa	50+ people....I would choose just a couple of games and then just let people mingle.  Here are some ideas:<br>  <br>  How Many Diapers In The Diaper Cake?<br>  <br>  Letters To The Baby (Have each guest write a letter to the baby when they arrive or throughout the shower).<br>  <br>  Advice Book (Pass around a nicely bound blank book and have the guests each take a page to share advice.)<br>  <br>  **These "games/activities" are nice because they don't take up a lot of time and they allow the guests to share a piece of themselves with the new family (the advice/letters games I am talking about).<br>  <br>  Good luck and have fun.

cab8f3eed982d7c810bf2e8fc14f2cecaa	no! *cries* lol. Umm I think he's getting his 3rd tooth and went to bed before 9pm(which my son hardly ever does) and woke up 2 times just kinda whining so I checked him and patted his back. Well about 4 am this morning he wakes up screaming at the top of his lungs. OMG did that ever shock me awake. I went into him and he was laying there fussing and was wide awake so we rocked for about 15 mins. Then I was falling asleep almost dropping him. So I changed him and then layed him back into his crib with his crib toy that makes soothing soft music and he slept till almost 9 am. Which again woke me up bc he was tired of trying to entertain himself and wanted to eat haha!|`|7uVlYPEIaa	I am lucky, I have twin girls that have slept through the night since they were 3 months old.

He would have severe screaming fits in the middle of the night. The girls go to bed between 8-8:30, wake up at 7:30 am. Generally they take their naps together before everyone else gets home, but if they are going to take a short nap in the afternoon it's one or the other. Too much chaos to sleep with 3 boys and husband home I guess.<br>  <br>  No you don't sleep when they are gone either according to my mom and grandma. Just lay awake and wonder what they are doing while you aren't there to watch.|`|RPc63EK2aa	nope, since birth until 10 week old, my son always sleep at night for 30 mins. - 1 hour, then he will be woke up for milk....again sleep, it takes 15-30 mins. for him to go back to sleep...after an hour he will be woke up again, sometimes for milk, sometimes for nothing just he want to open his eyes....the other night was worst of all my nights with my baby, he just sleep for 5-15 mins. and woke up, again 5-15 mins. for him to sleep again, when he will sleep, another 10 mins. or 15 mins. he will woke up again...its hard coz i am working mom at day...i dont have sleep at all... <br>  your lucky your daughter now will sleep continuously...|`|OgzHcNMsaa	My daughter was strangely sleeping all day yesterday so I knew I\d have a struggle in the night. She finally went to sleep at around 3ish  am and woke up at 9 am|`|h85kkDsbaa	My son slept through from 8 weeks and he even got 2 teeth without waking in the night. The past few nights he has been waking for a feed about 1am so its been abit of a shock having to get up in the night again, even tho i never sleep all night because i always wake up to check on him. He has a bit of a cough and i think he is teething and that's why.<br>  <br>  Last night he didn't wake for a feed but he woke up about 5/6/times for his dummy back.<br>  <br>  Hope your little one continues to sleep well for you|`|DeOCEm4Oaa	My daughter is 14  months and last night night she slept 7pm - 8am. She usually sleeps 7am - 7pm unles she's teething, sometimes she'll wake. She has slept through the night from 3 months. I had MY first full night sleep 3 weeks ago. that means I slept from 10 - 7 without getting up to go to the toilet... Its the first time I've woken up and actually felt refreshed in 2 years... - I wanted to tell you this story to let you know it does get better! And you will find that you will wake its your body clock its been through alot of changes. Once she's had a good week of full night's sleeps you'll relax and sleep better. Good luck.|`|8cfQwsC8aa	My little girl was brilliant last night.  She slept from 8pm - 7:30am.  She is 15 weeks and has done this since about 9 weeks but she used to sitr and you would be up putting her dummy in her mouth about 6 times a night but the last week she has just slept solid until 7:30.  She must take after me and just love her sleep hehe|`|03szAlNvaa	She woke up two times which is what she normally does! I think she has slept right through the night about three times but i woke up every few hours expecting her to want a feed!|`|iMaTMWMxaa	No, apparently not. I only know because I stirred in the night, and saw my daughter next to me, and no husband lol!!<br>  <br>  He was up all night. What a wonderful wonderful daddy :)|`|XKfrNzhUaa	I woke up in a panic when my son slept though the night for the first time but he was only 8 weeks old. hes 12 weeks now and we go to bed around 9:30-10 and he will sleep until 6 or 7 am.|`|e49178f67a815a64799d8c1237b9affaaa	7pm to 7am last night.  Sleep is so good....|`|dXVA1wHDaa	Was a very good night, he went down to bed at around 7.15pm and woke up at 7.45am.  Now it's 10.40 and he's gone down for another bap, haha, he loves to sleep.|`|EFc8VGwRaa	my 10 week old soon slept great last night he has slept right through from birth, he goes to sleep at 8.30 and doesnt wake up untill 5.30-7.30..
Y9DAtGReaa	1) you should talk to your doctor about that, but probably not.<br>  <br>  2) it effects everyone differently. but for me yes, i felt like i was pregnant again.<br>  <br>  3) same as above, i still had little break outs|`|xJA92xNsaa	Dr. tyrone never used or any of his ladies. but if you want to really not get pregernat then  try you husban on some magnum sheathes.
ovzUvTifaa	It is up to you and whether you feel that he is ready. At 20 months, I would venture to say that he is probably very ready. All children are different. Some take days, some take months - regardless of the age you start.<br>  <br>  I will give you the one piece of advice that has been given to me, though. Once you decide to start potty training, stick with it. If you try for a day or two and go back to diapers, it will confuse your child. Understand that he could learn very fast or he could take months and go at his pace.<br>  <br>  You hear of kids who potty train in a few days time when they're 16 months old or 3 years old. You hear of 1 year olds and 4 year olds alike who take 3 or 5 months.<br>  <br>  Oh - the other suggestion I had was to either: let him run bare-bottomed for a couple days or put him in underwear. You can choose to bring him to the potty seat when you 'catch' him start to go or you can go in intervals throughout the day or a combination of both. I've heard of people who are big fans of the "keep-em-naked-and-bring-them-to-the-pot... method. :) I think I will be doing that with my son (we're starting now too). It makes sense. That's basically how puppies are trained. They (puppies and kids both) begin to learn that "when I do this, I go here". You verbalize to the child (nicely) "You peed! Pee-pee goes in the potty! Good job using the potty!" Then after you see they are getting the hang of it (a day or two) and starting to head to the potty themselves, then put underwear on them.<br>  <br>  There are a thousand methods of potty training. Just go with your gut and find what works with your son. :)|`|5I4imquJaa	it all depends on the child....do they know what the potty is for?<br>  once they have that worked out, half the problem is solved...<br>  <br>  i bought a potty for my son, who is 16 months old now, and he sits on it every so often as i leave it in the living room.......<br>  <br>  there is no right or wrong time, also, allow for troubles/hard times you have yourself, cause if you are finding it hard to deal with, so will the kid|`|AA11025762	my son saw his older friends use the potty and wanted to do the same.<br>  <br>  i would say when u r home now, let him go bumless and watch him. if he wets the floor say "awww u could go on potty for that" or if u see him going rush over saying about quick quick potty.  so he learns to associate the potty with him his body functions.  also going bumless will make him aware of the feelings of needing and going to the loo cos he will see it splash on the floor etc..<br>  <br>  just generally make a big fuss over toilet functions. after a while keep asking him if he needs to use the potty, if he sits on it and does nothing, go "awww no weewee never mind next time" and when he does go in the loo (accidently i found with my son first fw times) we made such a big clapping dancing thing out of it! <br>  soon he will take himself to the potty when he is bumless and then u can judge when to take the plunge of big boy pants. once in pants no going back.. he has to wet them to understand about taking them down..<br>  <br>  i honestly dont understand people like the first answer who says about dirtying the floor! how else can they learn.. its only baby pee or poo and it cleans up! jeez|`|JvM44Bx5aa	Approx. 2 - 4 years old.  But there is no right or wrong age.  It depends on your son whether he is ready for potty train or not.|`|cd8581c7a80494fd4bdb2cf1069ac931aa	I'd say you're well past the age when you should have been!|`|XPCUtf7baa	It all depends on the child. My daughter (who is my first) showed signs that she was ready to be potty trained at about 21 months. Within a month she was pretty much completely potty trained with only the occasional potty in her sleep. My nephew however is 3 1/2 and still struggling with it. The most important thing is to be patient. Some kids take more time whereas others pick it up fairly quickly. It's a hard thing to master so praise him when he does it but don't scold when he has an accident, my brother did that and now his son is still having problems. Good luck...not having to change diapers is one of the greatest milestones!!! lol.|`|lc6Nm3SVaa	my 1st 2 children were started at 2 1/2yrs an were ready just in time for school at 3. my 3rd child now however, we started him at 21 months an he is toilet training now, it is a longer process with him tho, takin months to master properly whereas my other 2 trained in weeks. every child is different though, its up 2 u, ur partner and ur child when u all feel ready to start, good luck|`|9T9UaXIfaa	Probably 2 years old because they might start "dirtying" your house.|`|p07RwZK2aa	It depends on the child. When they start to show signs is the time to start. After you have bought them a potty and explained what it is for, some signs are: <br>  <br>  - showing signs of needing to pee (wriggling, holding themselves etc) before peeing<br>  - Wanting to go with you to the bathroom <br>  - Refusing to wear diaper <br>  etc. <br>  <br>  My twin daughters were ready at 22 months and I potty trained them easily. <br>  When my son was 2 years old I tried potty training him. I know they said that you should never go back but this was bad... his body just wasn't ready. He couldn't control when he needed to pee and he showed no interest. So I started again when he was 3 and he picked it up after a few slow months. <br>  <br>  So you see how different it is for different kids?

Low levels of the hormone progesterone can contribute to premenstrual symptoms such as tension, irritability, anxiety or other mood changes. Vitex has been shown to help these symptoms due to its effect on the pituitary gland.<br>  <br>  Clinical trials have shown that Vitex agnus-castus can help correct irregularities of the menstrual cycle, such as cycle length. Vitex encourages ovulation and helps to normalise the menstrual cycle. It can assist in reducing breast pain, fluid retention and premenstrual acne.<br>  <br>  I used this for 1 month and got my period after 24 days in comparisson to 5 and a half weeks before and 6 weeks the month before|`|rn5VVojAaa	Wow i am in exactly the same situation and have puurchased Vitex to help my cyles, but i have yet take it as i was unsure if it wld affect me taking clomid. what were your day 21 progesterone levels, ? mine was 80. plz don't be sad, hope it happens soon|`|MmQi03oXaa	I did Vitex and had success.<br>  <br>  I stopped BC in Aug 07 and didn't get my period back.

But if you don't feel the pop, or if it's just coming out as a slow trickle then maybe not.|`|721055bb4f4a90cbc769262d4684a39daa	I would like to think so, its like a rush or gust of warm water coming out of a whole that usually doesn't express liquid. but they say some women's waters break while going to the bathroom and they don't notice.|`|HM0cxcahaa	Unless you had merconium in your amniotic fluid i would suggest not.|`|Ws1hky6Zaa	if it comes out heavily then yes, but if it does slowly then not until you get out you wont.|`|OMTSqrSFaa	yes cus its a funny bloody yellow green .. colour lol you would no if it broke .. xx|`|TsSOFoWEaa	PPL dont know what they're talking about. I had to ask my doc that question too. Now I can tell you from experience. When you break your water it dosent just happen all at once. Water keeps coming out for hours on end. It dosent just stop. Trust me. You will be surprise with how much water your belly is holding.|`|wi5NqhAcaa	hey could you email me back it would be good to know what is happening. I would be going through it in about 7 months. x.dreama.x@hotmail.com but i think that you should go to the doctor right now. Some waters don't brake until the baby come out. :) Email me please|`|aQFtHspwaa	no, the only way to know is if a doctor or nurse examens you
EJrM8gr9aa	dont question it and just consider yourself lucky. with my first preganacy i had morning sickness for 5 months and when i started feeling good i was put in the hospital for preterm labor and was stuck there for 2 month til i had my son. during my second one, i had got an infection and had to deliver or i wouldve died. he ended up passing away 2 days later. i never got to enjoy either pregnancies so im glad that someone enjoys theres. good luck :]|`|0c330dc5c7e321c8e8dfd2f50ecea522aa	My mom did with me. She had like one day of morning sickness and that was it. Maybe you are just one of the lucky ones and have it easy. Good luck with the birth|`|nbSp469Waa	Ya, I don't like girls like you.  LOL.  That's fantastic that you are having such a great pregnancy.  Keep up the good work!!!|`|uCLenopbaa	your lucky!  i was the exact same way  && i still am!!<br>  i love being pregnant so much, i dont want it to end.<br>  but i cant wait to meet my little prince lol.<br>  <br>  i can STILL fit into my jeans, but not my shirts lol.<br>  i've olny gained 22lbs.  my doctor is so shocked; but says everything is going perfect.|`|jYPeis3Saa	well lucky you!!!<br>  <br>   i was sick morning noon and night from week 8 through week 37 when my son was born. it was horrible. i also had a complicated labor and delivery. never really had cravings. i was exhausted all the time too. and my hormones were definitly out of control! everyone and everything irritated the crap out of me. had horrible leg cramps at night and bad sciatica. <br>  but as hard as my pregnancy and delivery was, i loved being pregnant! sounds strange, but i really did! <br>  <br>  everyone is different. you could have a really easy labor and delivery. or it could be difficult. <br>  <br>  i tell my husband that the next baby better have some mercy on me since its brother sure didnt. lol!! ive definilty been bitten by the baby bug again, but my husband hasnt so i just have to wait. boo! :(|`|vFXkjvFgaa	This sounds like me. The only thing I can complain about was at 6/7w when I had some bleeding and thought I was having a m/c. But other than that I am doing great, especially when I look at some of my friends who are pregnant. <br>  <br>  I am 33w and have gained 19 lbs, I am at about 135lbs right now. I finally caught up, my dr considered me under weight up until a couple weeks ago. I can still wear most of the my prepreg shirts but not the pants obviously since Im 33w lol. But I have a couple pairs that I can wear and use the rubber band trick on.<br>  <br>  I do get BH contractions often though. My blood pressure has been great and I just havent gotten the sh*tty feeling yet, you know? My first trimester I was such an emotional wreck though, lol. My poor husband. But once I got out of the first tri my mood has been GREAT.<br>  <br>  Nothing on my body really hurts YET but I did have m/s in my first tri. Ugh.<br>  <br>  My moms two pregnancies were very easy as well...<br>  <br>  But ahh, you are so lucky to get massages so often and you are VERY lucky to get to see a chiropractor regularly - Ive heard it makes all the difference in the world.<br>  <br>  Well, Im rambling. Congrats and good luck!|`|IwOEdthhaa	Other than cravings and always being tired, I didn't feel pregnant until I was about 8 mos along. Everybody would tell me their horror stories about pregnancy and/or birth and I freaked out entering the delivery room. I knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that something had to go wrong. I was convinced that something goes wrong during every pregnancy and since nothing had happened yet, I was going to have complications during birth.<br>  <br>  Luckily I was wrong. Some of us are just lucky. Be grateful and keep in touch with your doctor, just in case.|`|u2C6bngXaa	That's awesome! I had morning sickness, but that was about it until about 36 weeks...that's when my body fell apart! But I'm not on full bed rest, so that's positive! You may have none, some or all "issues" later...

cce5f84847d7ecc5675489d7f269c5cdaa	I took a bath with my son when he was very young, about 2 months - maybe less. It's a great way to bond! It also gets you both cleaned and I enjoyed it very much... sometimes, I nursed him in there. He seemed to like it. He's now 5 months and we take the occasional bath together. Just make sure that there's another adult with you and never, ever stand up with a wet, slippery baby! If there isn't an adult, you can place a thick towel on the floor and set him down on it before you get out. I hope it helps and I hope you enjoy it as much as we do!|`|3Fq0HaIAaa	I'm 3 years older than my brother and 6 years older than my sister and my parents would have us take baths together when we were young with the littler one in a baby bath in the tub or just in the tub if they could sit well. It was a lot of fun and I know I loved washing them. It made everyone love bath time and yes, it was easier to get the little one clean.|`|ZBXCz0GLaa	Yes I have.  My son loves it.  I have done it ever since he could be still enough in the bath.  I bought extra mats to cover the entire floor of the tub to prevent slipping.<br>  <br>  My cousin has this seat <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=7977227&sourceid=1500000000000003260330&ci_src=14110944&ci_sku=7977227" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...</a>  <br>  <br>  It worked for her, too bad I didn't see that when my son was younger! I could have used it.|`|ttrA4TiRaa	do it all the time.. ever since they both were babies.. my son is 2 1/2 and my dauther 15 months and we still take baths together... they love being in the water and playing and the skin to skin contact is very good for them as well... |`|AA10015577	I used to all the time and it was definately a success.  It did make things a lot easier especially when my son hated having his hair washed. <br>  |`|cY8DgJv5aa	Use to do it all the time.  It was always a blast.  I think its easier to get them clean when you're in the water with them.|`|YPuVx2Niaa	Yes!  I enjoyed bath time with my kids.  They loved it too.  It broke the monotony.|`|M6c0hUefaa	Yeah, we take a shower together pretty much every night. She sits in her bath seat and it's usually a little easier than if we were to shower separately.|`|A2XYCdOYaa	I'm gonna start taking baths with my daughter once she is old enough to sit up, at the moment I'd feel a bit uneasy having a bath with her because of her age.|`|Kmrl0FX8aa	No, I haven't done this. I know others who have, but I don't think it's right (personally). I know people will disagree. But, I think it's important to teach a baby privacy, plus it just seems weird to me. Sorry.|`|TcR4EJjHaa	I just couldn't bring myself to do it after one time.I am OCD and the thought of either of my boys peeing or pooping in the water disgusted me lol.<br>  <br>  If you have no issues, then I'd say go for it.|`|61eadcf38f72b14203ed398198796d52aa	I always do - it's the only way my daughter will take a bath and not scream the whole time =P  She's 4.5 months now and just starting to play in the tub.|`|LbkLg4RFaa	Yes.  It's lots of fun for baby (and mummy).  To me he seemed safer in the big bath with me in there as well. 
p2Njf5gBaa	I am so sorry for your loss honey.  <br>  I am 21 with a 9 month old.... I know how it is when you dedicate every moment to your son.  You love them soo much, but on the other head you sometimes wonder, who am I besides a mother.  <br>  <br>  You need to find a hobby, such as a craft, or just something recreational that you enjoy.  Try taking naps when your son naps during the day, that way you can have Little extra energy at night after they go to bed to do something just for you.  Whether it be sitting in tub with a glass of wine or a bowel of chocolate just reading a book.  Or baking, I dip pretzels in chocolate when I have had a really long day.... lol... there is something soothing to me about making chocolate covered pretzels.  Then it makes me feel good because I can bring them as treats to whoever I may be visiting within the next week.  Scrap booking can be fun.  I just recently taught myself to crochet.... lol... and I have been making funky scarves for Christmas.  A hobby or craft is always something to help you relax and take your mind off of things. <br>  Maybe on weekends you could have someone watch your son for a while, and you could meet up with some girlfriends that you haven't seen for lunch.  You will feel more refreshed after you return home, after a afternoon like that.... I guarantee it!  Try to get out of the house more too.... this really helps.  Sometimes i will think to myself... wow... I haven't left the house in a week... no wonder I feel like I am going stir crazy.  Even if you can't afford anything... just take your son to a store and walk around.... it make give you ideas for something you may want to do.  Do to a craft store.... or a dollar store... I find these stores very amusing!  <br>  Hang in there.... and your not alone...... take care!  |`|46cbd785e6475e81fd1cbbaa46a93a81aa	once my little guyis down for the night i like to take a bath,,,,sit down watch some tv....during the day i dont really have time time to do anything else|`|J1stiMioaa	sounds familiar to me too! i never got to grieve over the death of my son as i was pregnant with my 3rd and didnt want him to pick up on the stress, my youngest is now 16 months old and i litterally dont get time to go to the toilet on my own never mind have a life! i try to rest when he does as it gives me a bit more energy 4 at night when hes gone to bed to do my jewellery making!|`|8fr7tMfYaa	My day is pretty much 99% taking care of my almost 9 month old son, .5% computer time, and .5% cleaning.  After he goes to sleep my husband and I will watch a movie or I will play computer games.  That's pretty much my social life right now lol.  I did join a meetup group though with other mom's with babies around his age.  They have several meetups throughout the week and some on weekends too.  It is a great way to go out and socialize and have your baby socialize too.  I found some groups in my area on Meetup.com.  Good luck :)|`|J9Tbun7naa	How about a mother's group...I live for my thursday outing with my mum's group. The bubs get to play with each other and I get some adult conversation. <br>  if you don't have one in your area you could talk to your health visitor about joining one.... or look at some classes for your son... gymbaroo, swimming lessons etc....fun for bubs and a chance for you to meet other parents too.<br>  My daughter is 9 months too so feel free to email me if you want to chat or anything.|`|TkSY2ZUfaa	Hi hon! I'm sorry for your loss, you didn't mention the daddy, is he around? If so, wait until he gets home and then go out, get your nails done, your hair.. <br>  <br>  My husband and I have date nights and my mom watches my son, he's 9mo as well, and I am 22. I work but tomorrow is my last day and I will be staying home with my baby! I'm so excited! I brush my hair every single night, that's a little me time, lmao.. Stay calm and enjoy your son!! If you ever need to talk feel free to email me :) I don't have any hobbies I can think of.. But I will buy some workout dvds and do them in the mornings, I like to dance so I'll look for something with that.. They say that working out early gives you energy for the day.. We'll see..<br>  <br>  God Bless|`|xKk1l01Aaa	So even if you do find a hobby how do you find time to do that with a baby. The reason why I ask is because I have no social life besides a few close friends that also have kids. I don't really get time to myself unless the kids are asleep and with a 16 month old and a 3 week old it's rare. So basically unless you find a baby sitter you don't really have time to yourself.|`|voKnIZ6Waa	honestly....i really dont. i shower at night when he's asleep and then get into bed with him. thats my alone time for the day lol and it only last 5-10 mintues. 
03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	It doesn't make any difference at all if you sleep on your back, side, or stomach.  Yes, you are being paranoid.|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	my doctor told me to sleep however im comfortable<br>  your body will soon tell you when to move<br>  ive always been a back sleeper and have had 5 healthy babies no problems<br>  baby 6 is due this month and im still on my back<br>  its fine millions of women do it  x x x|`|OLW0Irbhaa	You should be concerned but not to the point you make yourself crazy.  Go to sleep on your side and you will wake up if you end up on your back.  If that happens get back on your side.  The concern is that the weight of the baby/uterus compresses the artery that runs behind all those structures and limits flow of blood and oxygen.|`|LKIhUMCgaa	no u shouldn't. u will sleep on whichever side is more comfortable for u. i sleep on my left side, back, and my right side. everything is fine. if i were to be sleeping just on my left side, i get horrible aches in my body. they say it's not recommended to sleep on ur back, but mostly for u bc the baby's weight might press on ur organs too much, but at 16 weeks ur baby doesn't weight that much yet.<br>  <br>  i'm 31 weeks pregnant and i'm perfectly fine sleeping on either side.|`|s1utniuvaa	I am 17 weeks and I end up in all positions, on my back, belly, left and right side. The doctor said my body will tell me when I can't lay in a certain position anymore, either it would cause me pain or I would wake up and move.|`|g9ZFjl6paa	no your fine. i sleep on my back sometimes but mainly try to sleep on my sides. your fine. if you get to worried just talk to your doctor<br>  <br>  <br>  congrats on the pregnancy|`|AJQDCFOvaa	Sleeping on your back possess a problem with oxygenation.The weight of your unborn child can press on to your abdominal aorta and vena cava causing supine hypotension.Manifestations include light-headedness,faintness and palpitations.This condition can be both detrimental to you and your unborn child.It is indeed a concern but this phenomenon is very much preventable.You should preferably be lying on your left side to facilitate circulation.<br>  <br>  So sleeping on your back while pregnant is a problem.Not a big problem at all because its just a matter of being accustomed with sleeping on the left side while pregnant.|`|T9fek24eaa	Its not that big of a deal. The reason you are not supposed to sleep on your back is because the weight of your uterus (and baby) pressed down on the vena cava (which is a major artery) and constricts blood flow and puts a strain on your heart. But the great thing about this is you can not accidentally do that, you WILL feel it, even if you are sleeping it will wake you up because you will have trouble breathing. Don't worry about it.|`|AA11728165	No, you shouldn't worry about it. You're fine to sleep on your back. I had the same problem and asked my doctor about it and he said that as long as I use pillows under my knees and some extra pillows under my head (to keep my head above my heart), that me and the baby would be just fine. I slept on my back until the last couple weeks (when I just couldn't!).|`|4XfjUcvDaa	I was concerned about the same thing.  I had a few problems and had to see a high risk doctor and asked the doctor the same question.  her response was if you feel that you are waking up dizzy, light headed and even out of breath then you need to worry.  If you are not waking up with any of these problems then it is not harming the baby.|`|HqVoLzjcaa	Yes you r being paranoid. You should try to sleep what ever way is comfortable for you because at the end you ain't gonna have too many options. Actually you're gonna be miserable trying to get comfortable.|`|5cfrig5Eaa	maybe you should talk to your doctor about this i don't think it is a big deal but to be on the safe side talk to your doctor|`|BO28Mn8haa	you are fine. you should just avoid sleeping on your stomach

I went  through the exact  same things. I got the chlomifene tablets and after one course i was pregnant and now have a beautiful one year old girl.<br>  Perservere. It will be worth it. Have you done a pregnancy test lately? The nausea might mean you're pregnant. That's when i found out i was pregnant, when the nausea started.|`|ACTa6N5Naa	I have PCOS too but not heard anyone really have the side effects your describing with being on Metformin! It sucks your feeling that ill! Can you not phone NHS 24?  Just an idea!!  My doctors won't let me speak to them until I make an appointment with them either! Good luck hope you feel better soon!!
d5479b73829d5fa0818d9eec2850a058aa	The method of dating a baby with ultrasound is to either measure the length of the femur and date or measure the circumference of the head and date.  However, I have had three babies, the first they said was 3 weeks premature, the second they said was overdue and the third they delivered by section because they said he was too big.  The problem is they estimate the age of the child from a set of 'average' measurements.  So if your baby has a small head (like my first) they will date the baby later than your dates, if the baby has a big head they will say the baby is overdue like my other two. Additionally the two girls stopped growing for almost six weeks, they were super big up to about thirty weeks and then just totally slowed down, so much so that they would keep admitting me to hospital for tests.  They were both fine. <br>  <br>  In my experience the baby will come when he's ready.|`|S1gJJHNzaa	yes and no.. yes, if you see an increase in temp you are producing progesterone.. you might slowly go, over the course of days, (I never see an increase until 2 mornings after I O) up or shoot up quickly.<br>  <br>  and no because just because you see the temp rise doesn't mean for sure you ovulated.. I had a big temp rise and didn't ovulate but instead produced a cyst, which also can produce progesterone..<br>  <br>  so many things can effect your temp too.. I'd go with the dr.  Its only a few days difference, right?|`|NbBe2o9Taa	You and/or Dr. may  be off by two weeks.  That's normal.  So you may be 24, 26 or 28 weeks?  The first two weeks of pregnancy is not counted so that's why.  Question for you.  When charting your BBT, when did you think/know you were pregnant?
NTJwVcWuaa	In my first pregnancy I was so tired, that I couldn't do hardly anything the first trimester. I even had to leave my work. I could hardly move. <br>  <br>  The "pains" of pregnancy varie from woman to woman, but they seem to get easier once you enter your 2nd trimester. <br>  <br>  Some of the things you can do to feel your best:<br>  1. take your vitamins<br>  2. drink a lot of water. Your pee should be totally clear. Water will make you feel better and help with tiredness. <br>  3. eat some leafy greens like spinach. You want to make sure you have enough iron. Your blood supply will double during your pregnancy.<br>  4. get plenty of rest. Making a baby is not easy. Your body is working extra hard all the time. <br>  5. try to keep a bit active if you can like taking a walk..<br>  <br>  good luck in your pregnancy.|`|FjFAEvzcaa	The first trimester is all about feeling drained..... for some, all the way through!|`|EDo0gxpdaa	It's normal. That early on your body is adjusting to something growing inside of it. So you will feel tired and like you have no energy. It gets better though, The second trimester is the easiest. Good luck and congrats.|`|M27qHXzCaa	Welcome to pregnancy!!!  They are all normal (unfortunatly)  I am 7 weeks pregnant and I have all the same symptoms..  It will eventually get better in your second trimester and then it all comes back in the third.  Get lots of rest and make sure you take your prenatal vitamins  they help.  I haven't really found anything to help with the energy thing but you can use a heating pad on your shoulders on low.. Good Luck!!|`|WbaSpiYpaa	I just found out I'm pregnant, and I feel the same way.  So, congratulations, I believe this is totally normal.|`|k8aH9b4Yaa	wow, lol. sorry have to laugh, 5 weeks and drained!!! lol, I'm due tomorrow! get used to it you have a long ways to go. When you get to 39.6 weeks and have a 7 pound baby kicking up a storm in your belly lets talk about drained!|`|kpFDaA1Naa	A lot of women report feeling utterly exhausted. I know I did. <br>  <br>  When you think about what your body is doing, it's not surprising that you feel exhausted. I remember reading it somewhere that while your body is currently growing a placenta, building new blood vessels, building breast tissue, and growing a baby ... you're expending more energy while you're ASLEEP right now than what a non-pregnant woman would be if she was mountain climbing. <br>  <br>  So it's no wonder you feel totalled after doing just the smallest things right now.|`|ryvO8DMaaa	I have been completely exhausted this entire pregnancy.  Hopefully for you the 2nd trimester will be better than it was for me.  Congrats on your pregnancy!
Fy9S6hjIaa	My mother has 3 kids at ages older than you are, and everything was absolutely fine!  She had my younger brothers and sister when she was 39, 41 and 43.  My dad was 48, 50, and 52.  <br>  <br>  I think you and your husband are both plenty young to have a perfectly healthy pregnancy!  You're not even 40 yet.  You've still got a few good years!!!!!!|`|CJvHQl5vaa	That is crazy.  Many women start their first baby at 38.  Don't listen to popular opinion, talk to your doctor.  There are tons of women who have menopause babies, for pete's sake, and they can be as late as their late 40s!  These women enter menopause, assume they aren't fertile, stop using birth control, and apparently have one good egg left, because tadah, they get pregnant!  38 isn't too old by any stretch of the imagination!|`|MQqlcBcFaa	My friend's got a sister who is 15yrs younger to her. I guess her mom might have been in late 30's or early 40's then. That little girt is absolutely healthy.She's very active and intelligent too. So I don't think you're to old now.|`|e29b0c8b08bfccce474d6efcc471aa17aa	No, if you really want another baby, try! Better late than never! :) Just make sure you have good medical care and take care of yourself. Good luck!|`|7at1Hyn8aa	Well, you are getting to the point where doctors recommend you not try another pregnancy.  <br>  That does not mean you could not try, it just means it will not be as easy to get pregnant, and there might be a somewhat higher chance of complications.<br>  Bottom line, there is no time like the present, but make an appointment with your doctor, to make sure there is nothing going on right now, that would complicate things before you get going.<br>  <br>  In regards to your husbands age: It does not matter much when it comes to fathering a child. Men can do the deed successfully into their high 80th or beyond.<br>  <br>  One more thing to think about: If you were to get pregnant now, you would be 49 when your child turns 10, 59 when it turns 20.|`|6uYVRaebaa	well it is true that there would be alot more risks than there would be if you were younger, but 38 isn't an omg shes prego age!! lol if you kno what i mean, im only 17, but my mother's friend (43ish) is pregnant and everything is going fine. If its really what you want than go for it!! :)|`|XPCUtf7baa	My mom had 6 kids, starting when she was 21 and ending when she was 43 and we all ended up just fine...in fact, the youngest one is probably the smartest out of all of us! lol. So if it's something you want to pursue don't let age get in your way. You still have plenty of time left, especially with all of the advances that we have now. Doctors know what to do with a high risk pregnancy and you will be fine. Good luck!|`|T6oxOUAgaa	No you are not. But if are considering this you must try for it now while you have the time. Because the older you get the harder it is to conceive. And the health issues involve for both you and the child!!<br>  <br>  LOTS OF LUCK!!!|`|b26NgqOFaa	not really, no you are not too old. You just have a higher risk now that you are over 35. I was 33 when I got pregnant for the second time and I was considered higher risk for certain reasons. There are so many tests that are done now- obstetrics has changed a lot since you had your first child. You would be well monitored. I would not let anything hold you back if you really want to have a baby now. My good friend had her first baby at 45 and another one 2 years later. They are both perfect.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	I don't think you are.  I didn't have my first one until I was 32 and I had two more after that.
lKz8CoqVaa	I had a miscarriage back in June and was told also that everything would pass naturally, after I took the pills that they gave me.  First off, it took almost 2 weeks for it to work, then when I did finally start bleeding, it lasted for almost a full 2 months.  I was miserable!  I have a wonderful doctor, whom I trust very much and she told me that every woman's body is different.  She also noted that if it went on for more than 2 months, we would do something about due to health risks like anemia.  (Don't know what her plan was) Fortunately, I stopped just in time and we didn't have to move forward with it.
ZLKiiDLmaa	Sei grande oramai, se tua mamma non sa rispettare le tue scelte significa che è una persona ottusa! Non te la prendere e vai avanti, non stai facendo male a nessuno, mi pare. Sei una persona sensibile e intelligente, che ragiona con la sua testa quindi non cedere e imponiti di dire sempre l'ultima parola. Non sei tu nel torto ma tua mamma e tua sorella ( che dovrebbe pensare di più ai cavoli loro ) che non ti rispettano come "essere pensante".<br>  <br>  La tua scelta può esere paragonata ad una scelta religiosa o di vita, che merita sicuramente rispetto. Non pretendere però che tutti siano gentili e attenti, pronti a rassicurarti perchè "questo è un gran brutto mondo".  <br>  <br>  Ciao!!!<br>  <br>  ps: Questa ragazza non sta domandando se la sua scelta è giusta ma parla del rapporto con i suoi famliari, mi sembra evidente! Quindi invece di dare giudizi campati in aria leggete bene il testo ( cosa che si impara alle elementari!)|`|27ee5d59610c101a3a6a821ea6c381b5aa	Finché vivi in casa con tua madre ed è lei a cucinare, mi sembra rispettoso mangiare ciò che prepara. Penso comunque che dovresti essere libera di non mangiare la carne se non ti va, ma essere vegani significa non mangiare nemmeno pesce, uova latticini ecc., per cui preparare un pasto equilibrato diventa alquanto difficile. Inoltre lo capirei se si trattasse di ovviare ad un problema di salute, ma con questa alimentazione, senza assumere integratori, la salute finisce per rovinartela! Inoltre non è che non uccidi non mangiando proteine animali: uccidi migliaia di bestiole innocenti anche mangiando frutta e verdura e portando dei vestiti (pensa ai danni arrecati alla fauna idrica da concimi, erbicidi e pesticidi, e questo anche nelle coltivazioni di lino e cotone), utilizzando un mezzo di trasporto (macchine, treni, bus, aerei ecc. uccidino ogni giorno centinaia di migliaia di animali, e questo anche per portare in giro te), magari prendi la pillola, e si sa che gli ormoni espulsi con le urine finiscono in laghi e fiumi rendendo sterili i pesci, e potrei farti ancora decine e decine di esempi. A ben guardare, qualsiasi attività umana in qualche modo uccide... Ora, che fare? Se seguissimo tutti il tuo ragionamento, dovremmo compiere un suicidio di massa!!!!!<br>  <br>  Se ti senti abbastanza adulta da prendere questa decisione, dimostra a tua madre che sei anche abbastanza adulta per metterla in pratica. Dille di non cucinare più per te se non accetta la tua scelta e arrangiati a preparare dei piatti vegani che consumerai solo tu, mentre il resto della famiglia potrà continuare a mangiare ciò che vuole. In questo modo le dimostrerari di non essere solo una bambina viziata coi grilli per la testa, ma un'adulta che sa assumersi le proprie responsabilità. La situazione non cambierà da un giorno all'altro, ma se saprai dimostrare di essere coerente, forse un giorno ti stimerà per la tua determinazione e imparerà a riespettare le tue scelte. Anche se non fosse, tu non puoi farci niente. Devi vivere la tua vita come meglio credi, non come meglio crede lei.|`|91eMqQwsaa	vede la tua scelta come una cosa molto drastica.. e come ogni mamma pensa giustamente che con questo tipo di alimentazione il tuo organismo possa avere delle conseguenza negative, e non è che ha tutti i torti!<br>  forse prima dovresti partire con mangiare meno carne e con un alimentazione vegetariana che, comprendendo formaggi e uova   avrebbe un impatto meno forte sia sul tuo organismo che su tua mamma!<br>  poi con lei dovresti andare da un nutrizionista, vedere se alla tua età (a 19 si è ancora nell' età dello sviluppo, visto che si smette di crescere dopo i 25 anni!!) e vedere se l' alimentazione vegana fa per te, così tua mamma sentendo un parere esperto si tranquillizza,  e tu sei sicura di non far mancare al tuo organismo elementi essenziali, ti darà delle pastiglie integrative o cose del genere..<br>  come ti hanno già detto queste cose sono spesso dettate da una moda..non so se è il tuo caso e non ho intenzione di giudicarti..<br>  cerca però di capire anche l' idea di tua mamma, che ripeto le sue motivazioni sono più che valide!|`|da7fa48badab560c0e879b65473b3599aa	tua nadre dovrebbe accettare la tua scelta, rispettandola, aldila' che sia contraria o meno...<br>  e cmq e' una scelta ETICA e non la trovo sbagliata, pertanto tua madre anche se la trovasse sbagliata dovrebbe solo accettarla.<br>  parlaci e ti auguro che capiscano.....|`|8aqP2pQ7aa	Ciao io ho 23 anni e sono vegetariana da 10 anni, forse più. Ovviamente anche io ho avuto difficoltà all’inizio con la mia famiglia, soprattutto con mio padre, anche se ho cercato di abituarli gradualmente a questa mia scelta. In realtà la mia non è stata una vera e propria decisione, ero molto piccola e l’unica cosa che volevo era non mangiare la carne di un mio simile e così ho cominciato a rifiutarla; mangiavo il contorno di insalata ad esempio e il pollo rimaneva integro sul piatto così sono stati loro a distanza di poco tempo a dirmi: il pollo lo mangi, non lo metto nel piatto? <br>  Ho cominciato con il pollo ma con l’andare del tempo ho rifiutato tutto, sino a togliere dall’alimentazione il pesce, il prosciutto e tutto il resto. <br>  Quindi, è vero che io ero molto piccola ed venuto tutto molto molto spontaneamente, ma è anche vero che tu sei grande =) quindi puoi benissimo prenderti le tue responsabilità e soprattutto non dar conto delle tue scelte alla famiglia. Non devi imporre le tue idee, perché se non le condividono ti diranno sempre NO, devi prendere il pentolino e cucinarti da te, devi dimostrare di avere una testa e di essere capace di agire in maniera autosufficiente. Inoltre per tua madre questa tua scelta potrebbe comportare cucinare di più e più pasti, potrebbe rappresentare un peso insomma. Quindi organizzati, se loro hanno pesce a cena tu prepari l’insalata per tutti e una mozzarella per te. <br>  <br>  Inoltre vorrei rispondere a chi dice che l’uomo uccide da sempre. Bhè…ma l’uomo non è forse dotato di intelligenza superiore? Non è forse dotato di fantasia e raziocinio, elementi mancanti agli animali? Bene, se è davvero così, perché non la piantiamo con questa storia della caccia e ci rendiamo una volta e per tutte conto che l’uomo è in grado di scegliere?! L’uomo non è superiore solo perché ha architettato guerre e armi da fuoco, ma anche perché ha la capacità di distinguere il giusto dal sbagliato, ha la capacità di dominare i propri istinti e allora l’intelligenza dovremmo saperla sfruttare anche per le cose più giuste. Oppure la storia dell’uomo superiore all’animale la tiriamo in ballo solo quando ci fa più comodo? <br>  <br>  Detto questo… scusa lo sfogo : ) e in bocca al lupo ; )|`|EVMMLcbOaa	Gli uomni sono onnivori di costituzione hanno bisogno di introdurre sostanze differenziate e proteine per poter vivere. tua mamma ha ragione, si preoccupa per te e cerca di farti ragionare, la tua scelta "definitiva" ti porta a rispettare gli animali ma non te stessa! ogni eccesso e' di per se' un errore ricorda! saremo anche creature intelligenti (anche li' e' da vedere ogni singolo caso) ma non per questo dobbiamo autodistruggerci!!<br>  hai mai letto i casi di donne con la tua stessa ossessione che hanno visto morire i loro figli purche' dargli da mangiare carne o derivati animali? rifletti!|`|WDWOM7KKaa	Ti assicuro che rispetto gli animali, ma non amo il pietismo animalista. L'uomo è in cima alla scala alimentare e questa non è una colpa, oso dire che è naturale. Lo sterminio delle balene, i canili lager o addirittura la caccia non per necessità, ma per divertimento, sono una pura deformazione che, ovviamente, non approvo. Però anche gli animali, per sopravvivere, si uccidono.|`|XbFGjNr8aa	Tutti gli uomini hanno ammazzato animali per sopravvivere... perchè dovremmo fermare questa (aaahhhh succulenta, deliziosa,...) tradizione? E' nella natura: il più forte sopravvive. Comunque è una tua scelta e va rispettata|`|aoyRrLTEaa	prima cosa mi pare che vegana, non significhi solo non mangiare carne ma tutto quello che deriva da animali..........questa è una cosa molto pericolosa una mia amica era vagana e dopo 15 anni che era così è stata talmente male che in ospedsle l'hanno obbligata a ricominciare  a mangiare noprmale se non voleva morire. il mondo è stato fatto così il nostro corpo ha bisogno di tutto il cibo...........anche a me non va di uccidere nessuno animale, a me non piace la carne e la mangio veramente poco, ma ogni tanto va mangiata. io credo che tu madre magari usa questo metodo duro per farti cambiare idea .............ma lo fa solo per il tuo bene!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|kgs7jIeZaa	Tua mamma non ha tutti i torti...se non dovessi uccidere per mangiare, dovresti bere solo acqua. Mangiando una carota o una patata la estirpi dalla sua terra, uccidendola. Le piante hanno sviluppato i loro frutti con semi apposta per farli raccogliere dagli animali come noi, ma se non piantiamo quei semi alla pianta gli facciamo solo un torto! Quindi per mangiare in modo etico dovresti mangiare solo frutta e piantare tutti i semi che trovi. Lascia perdere...siamo animali eterotrofi e il nosto istinto di sopravvivenza ci dice che siamo al vertice della catena alimentare. Che male c'è? Siamo più forti, più intelligenti...senza massacrare nessuno, ognuno mangia quello di cui ha bisogno. Perché squali e leoni non si pongono questo problema? Perché devono sopravvivere. Non sopravviveresti cibandoti di soli zuccheri e fibre vegetali. E poi che male c'è a mangiare un uovo di gallina non fecondato? Chi uccideresti?

I think it's good to start early.|`|e88112505e8833a8d5f57952e86c543eaa	as soon as possible. This will help in the early detection of any abnormalities in your pregnancy. Then the OB/GYNE doctor will just give you a schedule for your next visit.  If the baby seems normal and your repro is normal, you'll be back after a month.|`|tNdAABV9aa	If this is your first baby and you've never had any miscarriages or anything like that, then anytime before the end of the first trimester is usually recommended. Just make sure you are eating well and taking some vitamins, and obviously no drinking or smoking. Oh, and I recommend stopping by the library to pick up some books about pregnancy so you can be well informed at your doctors visits. <br>  <br>  Good luck.
saXxWTkZaa	I think its normal but I also think its time to break the families curse (your words) and head to uni instead. <br>  <br>  I used to get extremely broody when I was 17, so I used to borrow my 1 year old brother for the weekend, (i was living with my grandmother as she was too infirm to look after herself) it used to put me off for a few months. I still started young, pregnant at 19 and altho i can never regret having any of my kids I do feel like I missed out on my youth to a certain extent. <br>  <br>  You have better opportunities than I did, please don't blow them.

It's normal yo feel this way - I did too around 15-16, but you just have to use your common sense and keep taking your pills. You should only have children when you feel ready to actually raise a baby - so make sure you finish uni, get yourself a stable financial situation and then, if you want to have children, feel ready to care for them and have a stable partner that feels the same, go for it. Until then, do the mature thing and WAIT! Your hormones will not rage like this forever!|`|RLzEmNAsaa	Its called hormones honey!! Its normal.<br>  <br>  It happens during your PMT because then you get  a huge surge of hormones rushing around your body.

I was already married for 2 or 3 years when i got preg, i lost that preg and we waited another 15 months or so to get preg again by the time i had my son i wa 29 years old and now i am having my second at 31 so you have plenty of time to be preg, keep taking your pills and use a condom.  Its really nice to be able to have a significant other that you can slowly get to know maybe even get married, buy a house, finish school, most importantly go on vacations and travel with each other before settling down with children.  once you have children your life changes, not for the worse for the better but in a whole diff way and you have to be ready to make sacrifices.  good luck|`|Zy8T0XNOaa	Some women have a very strong maternal instinct...  . I know that in your heart you know it is not the right time  but the urge to have one is there. . The rational side of you tells you that it is not the right time but the maternal side of you would love a baby. You need to get your life in order before you have a baby as it really does turn your life upside down even if they are really wished for. Perhaps you can babysit for somebody or help out at a playgroup so that you can get experience of being around young children ?|`|t71zTClJaa	Many times girls feel this way.  I did around this same time.  However, I did hold off and I am glad that I did.  When I finally did get pregnant (after I was married for almost a year) I became very sick for many months with hyperemesis (severe morning sickness) and I didn't get to complete my master's degree program.  So you must look at all aspects of being pregnant and see if it might hold you back from anything.  You can always get a fake belly to "tide you over" for now.  I totally understand the longing for a belly, it's my favorite part of being pregnant.  And if you cannot be stopped, look into surrogacy.  Many couples are looking to have a "host" for their embryos/fetus and since you only want the pregnancy, check into it.  Weigh everything though, whether you are mature enough to handle the responsibility of growing another person's child.  Good luck!

crspNObZaa	many of the busses will let you sit in the wheelchiar area, at least the buses in anaheim let me sit in the wheelchair section when i had my stroller.|`|KL1Y5FeHaa	If you are using public transport with young children you should find that people are quite curtious, they will help you or move out of the way, make room for you and allow you to get on first. Keep your infant in the stoller and ask your toddler to hold onto the pram. |`|sSrwcZb9aa	Well, I'm not a mom, but I take the bus to work maybe 95% of the time, so I've seen lots of people do it lots of different ways. I'd suggest doing a couple 'dry runs' - make the first one during a non-crowded time, and bring the stroller. The next time, go during your normal work time (rush hour, I'm guessing), leave the stroller at home, and see how it goes. By then, you should have figured out how to work it out best.<br>  <br>  First off, the front baby carrier is a good idea. How far would you have to walk - is it at all possible for the toddler to walk while you have the infant in your carrier, eliminating the stroller altogether? <br>  <br>  Second of all, I wouldn't worry about the seats. People on public transportation usually are very understanding about this, and frequently will move over so your child can sit next to you, and watch out for the child so you don't leave the bus or train without him, or vice versa. Another alternative is to let your child sit, and stand and hold on to a hand rail or something similar nearby. Or, you could take turns in the seat, and hold your toddler's hand while you're sitting down.<br>  <br>  The stroller thing is the most difficult. Either you could collapse the stroller shortly before getting onto the bus and drag it up the steps with you (the simple solution here is to allow your toddler to hold and swipe/show the bus pass), or if it's a less crowded environment the driver might put down the wheelchair ramp for you to bring the stroller on then collapse it once you've gotten moving, or not bother collapsing it at all if it's not too crowded. <br>  <br>  And, last but not least, there are ways to keep your kid near you. I've seen everything from wrist-to-wrist 'child leashes' for kids who might run off, to parents with kids holding onto a lanyard clipped onto their belt loop because I guess they weren't afraid that the kid would let go and wanted their hands free. As far as the whole 'child leash' thing goes, I know some people are rabidly against them, but I've seen photos of my parents using one on my siblings and I when we were kids, and even friends' parents had borrowed it as well, and we never turned out any worse than any other kids. Plus, if it's crowded or otherwise dangerous, it's about safety, not control or anything.

(But don't overbuy the newborn sizes, they grow quite quickly!)<br>  -Nappy rash cream<br>  -Wipes<br>  -Powder<br>  -Baby bath/bath wash<br>  -Lotions<br>  -Shampoo<br>  -A good sterilizing agent (We use Miltons)|`|awRNr2VMaa	dont go by weight on clothing because its never right! my son is 15 lbs and 7 months (no hes not a preemie and hes perfectly healthy! crawling and pulling up and he eats solids 3 times a day and 2 or 3 7 oz bottles in between!)  and he JUST got out of 0 - 3 months! his poor little butt wouldnt hold his pants up! i would buy plenty of newborn clothes but not too much. i would buy some 0 - 3 months too. walmart has alot of onesies that come in 5 a pack for 10 bucks and they also have sleepers (pajamas) 3 pack for 10 bucks i would get atleast 6 sleepers (spit up and if the baby has a poop or pee accident through the diaper) and atleast 10 newborn onesies for the same reason! good luck and congrats! |`|bf2b826fb186efa4963970654d24ac34aa	Here's a good site with a list for you: <a href="http://babyproducts.about.com/od/preparingforbaby/a/basiclayette.htm" rel="nofollow">http://babyproducts.about.com/od/prepari...</a><br>  Ask friends or relatives if they have any hand me downs and go to thrift stores for clothes. The great things about babies is they grow so fast most stuff barely gets used. Don't be surprised if you get inundated with second hand stuff once word gets around that you're expecting. We sure did and we already have two older boys. But on the plus side, we got a baby swing & reclining stroller now.|`|Zy07f0Zwaa	You should definitely have nappy supplies. To cut down on costs you could use washable nappies rather than disposable. You should also breastfeed to avoid the cost of formula. Most children grow out of clothes so quickly so you could always try buying the next size up (In Australia we have 00000, 0000, 000, 00, 0 and then into 1's 2's etc). <br>  <br>  Good luck xx |`|crspNObZaa	I bought for my little boy:<br>  -one package of 0-3 month clothes (both onsies and sleepers)<br>  -two packages of 3-6 month clothes (both onsies and sleepers)<br>  -3+ packages of 6-9 month clothes(both onsies and sleepers)<br>  <br>  He had lots of stuff that was blousy at first, but now at four months he wears 6-9 month sized clothes, so it is better to buy bigger. Also wait until after your baby shower before you start buying things. <br>  <br>  You will also want<br>  <br>  -some soft toys/rattles<br>  -5-6 cloth diapers (I find they make excellent burp pads in case baby spits up on you)<br>  -a bouncer or baby swing (to soothe baby)<br>  -bottles (even if you are going to breastfeed having some is good)<br>  -a breastpump (if you plan on breastfeeding)<br>  -pacifiers (some babies have trouble breastfeeding if you give them a pacifer, mine did, as soon as I stopped giving it to him he got MUCH better)<br>  -5 or so recieving blankets<br>  -2 or 3 warmer blankets<br>  -a mobile or some device that moves/lights/sounds for at night (most babies will fall asleep watching them)<br>  -a good sanitizer <br>  -crib/bassinette<br>  -Fitted sheets for crib/bassinette<br>  -infant tylenol<br>  -baby lotion and bath wash<br>  -baby bath tub<br>  -diaper rash ointment (just in case)<br>  -a digital thermometer with covers<br>  -you will need a highchair later on (around 4 months)<br>  -car seat<br>  -a stroller is nice but not nessessary<br>  -diapers and wipes<br>  -My mother in law got a bedside sleeper for me and I love it, (mainly because I am breastfeeding and he is right there) they are sometimes expensive but are great.|`|AA10241099	there are alot of things that you need. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.surebaby.com/baby_checklist.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.surebaby.com/baby_checklist.p...</a><br>  <br>  go there. it shows the usual checklist for preparing for a newborn baby. Grab the absolute necessities first. Then work on the rest. I always made sure I bought onesies and things of that sort in the newborn size. But dont over-do it. Grab some of the next size. All babies grow at a different rate, but my daughter was out of newborn sizes within a month. I'm 38 weeks pregnant with my second and I just made sure that i kept all the tags on the newborn clothes so that if she grows out of them before she gets to wear them, I can return them for the next size up. Good luck. |`|szGql9nGaa	Get some newborn cloths but not alot...they grow fast...when i found out i was having a boy i bought like 20+ little new born outfits..he wore them like twice..it was a waste of money...My some of every size my kids tall hes 11 months old and fits in 18-24 months cloths
3d5b0daf71aeea109b4c7e30ef86a3dcaa	Stress can make you miss your period. Like you said, you are a full time student and planning a wedding. Both very stressful. <br>  You should go get on some birth control if you are not planning on starting a family at this point. I am sure you and your fiance want to finish college and start careers before the family. They will give you a pregnancy test there before you start your birth control. <br>  You can also get a blood test from a doctor if you are that worried about it. <br>  |`|ouEix2a2aa	Contact your medical doctor for these irregularities.

xq7S9H5Raa	My dear only you and your boyfriend can make that decision.  This is something personal and no one else holds the answer to your intimate experience with your boyfriend.  Whatever you do just remember there is always consequences.|`|LvK6rg1caa	always wear a condom unless you can handle the consequences (you can either get pregnant or an STD).|`|7XBoIgd6aa	Your on the pill and your clean your fine.|`|YI8V5e36aa	Yeah if your on the pill hell yeah go for it... to be extra safe tell him to pull out|`|Ndj9ln7Iaa	If you want to have the chance of getting pregnant...|`|hXSSCFZIaa	I don't see why not.  It sounds like you have been very careful and responsible.  Go for it!|`|rwPc39vTaa	do it if ur planning to get pregnant if not just dont.... trust me, guys are jerks. he'll tell you he loves you forever now but once ur pregnant he's be nowhere in sight.
YBQvzEhGaa	I still occasionally have this problem for myself.  Try inserting the earring through the hole in the back of the ear and push it through to the front. It always works for me.|`|v0aKxF6iaa	you can try inserting it from back to front|`|trXjBRlRaa	Even as an adult with pierced ears since 16 (now I am 40) I can still run into this issue. With a little gentle nudging it will go back through. I recommend inserting and then pulling it out, using some rubbing alcohol, and reinsert right away. Do this daily over the next couple of weeks and all should be good. It might just be that side will continue to cause her issues by closing up more quickly than the other, which is what happens to me. Also, try a different angle when inserting as the hole may not be 100% straight through.|`|PW8A2HObaa	Yes.  When I changed my 5yo's earrings for the first time.  I let her air out her holes all day.  At night, when I put them back in, I had to pop one back through.

Ccq8zEcnaa	You can take a test as early as 20-24 days after unproctected sex occurs. This is what my fertility doctor told me, and sure enough for my first we found out on the 21st day after sex. The results ARE much more accurate though after 30 days. I think your symptoms may just be from your body ovulating or your cycle getting ready to start.|`|C4ibOR7Laa	i took a test the morning my period was due and it was positive, im now almost 17weeks pregnant|`|g9ZFjl6paa	after you miss your period. maybe wait a week or 2 after to make sure.|`|HJe7ln7gaa	You can take a test a week after the day you were supposed to get your period.

I had my endometriosis treated with surgery though and I fell pregnant 2 weeks after we started trying for a baby.<br>  <br>  I would say that you have a good chance of falling pregnant just like anyone. Don't try work out ovulation dates and stress yourself over falling pregnant or else it could work against you.<br>  <br>  Rather have fun and enjoyt he sex regularly and you will be pregnant before you know it!

7a29609061cc85b8213f55d1598f7a9aaa	I completely understand where you are coming from.<br>  <br>  The thing we ladies need to understand about MIL's is that they are used to looking after their 'boys' and then we come along and of course we don't know how to do it properly, cos they've been doing it for 25, 30 years...etc<br>  <br>  I am sure most MIL's don't mean to be interferring, i am sure they mean well, but they can't see that by trying to 'fix' us it infers that something is broken.<br>  <br>  I am not a mother of a boy, but it does seem to be difficult for a mother to make that break and let him cut lose towards you, the next caretaker.<br>  <br>  It is probably even more difficult for your MIL if she is away most of the year<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The only advice i can give is to ask your hub to have a word to let his Mom know that this is your house and she is expected to fit in, not take over, and of course, thank her for her help, but say my wife will ask if she needs you to pitch in with the cooking/ shopping etc<br>  <br>  In saying that, i have an ex-MIL from hell, and when i continually asked my hub to have a word, he said no, cos he couldn't be bothered having an arguement with her<br>  <br>  so i wish you luck<br>  x|`|Pi8KfmOxaa	instead of taking up a battle with your mother inlaw, get your hubby to sort it out.i know its annoying but i think in her own way shes trying to help|`|HXfHkoSHaa	I can totally see your point, but in reality, she's only in your life for a few weeks a year.  While keeping the things that are really important to you for yourself (such as the cake), let her do a lot of what she wants.  You say she is nice after all. She probably means well.  Let her cook yucky food, and be in your way.  She probably looks forward to her visit all year.  Make it nice for her.  I say, grin and bear it.|`|7FGsxx4Qaa	I can understand your frustration but like you say,you only have to tolerate her for a few weeks of the year..Friction between the two of you will,inevitably,cause friction between you and your husband..................|`|AA11601031	This is how World War III starts:  Two women are shipwrecked on a deserted island.|`|aWWgPkryaa	You are not wrong, it's your house, I would try and iron things out a bit though or else it's going to be an uncomfortable stay and she could make sure that your husband gets drawn in.<br>  <br>  She is probably feeling a bit rattled and uncomfortable right now.  If it were me I would put the children to play on their own (or, good for emergencies, in front of CBB's) and make both of you a cup of tea and have a calm assertive chat with her. I would be really honest and say we love it when you come to stay and appreciate you helping, but that you find it hard because you feel that she is taking over and that's difficult as you have a routine and know what food the kids like. <br>  <br>  If you say that you 'feel' that she takes over, she cannot argue with that, as she has now way of knowing how you feel, so that works better than saying 'you try and take over'. <br>  <br>  You could also say I know you want to help and I want you to spend as much time with your grand children as possible, this helps me out loads as I can get things done in the kitchen and enjoy cooking without being interrupted.  You could say that you want her to enjoy being a guest and looked after, after all, by the time you are a grandma you should be taking it easy!<br>  <br>  Good luck....<br>  <br>  <br>  You probably know allready, but if you trim the fat and caserole the braising steak in a nice stock on a low heat for about 2 1/2 hours it will be quite nice! ;-)|`|7qDnKoRaaa	It is your Home and she is a guest but you need to compromise let her cook one night if it keeps her happy but dont let her take over .<br>  <br>  It is your home and your family and if she over steps the mark let her know that you apreciate she is trying to help you|`|4e01ea3c043d72bb0dcd6600971480b9aa	my sister used to come over for six weeks at a time and helped with nothing, all she kept saying when I asked her to help with meals was...'I'm on my holidays'<br>  either/either is annoying but as it's only a few weeks a year, sit back and let her do it....hahaha that way she's doing all the grafting|`|t9hfLZOsaa	Try to connect with her it might be a good relationship trying to grow..but if it's getting like crazy creepy and a little scary kind of fun then i would advise you to stay away from that situation =\|`|wSGLYBPgaa	i don't get what u try in to say u have to  say it like u mean it|`|YR9h8p77aa	Just be assertive, not rude, but assertive.

There is no reason to upset her and that's probably what happened since she is now acting different.  <br>  <br>  Another option is, next time she visits, have a menu set up for the entire time she is there.  If she asks about it tell her it's just easier this way.  Also, try to include her in the kitchen while you are cooking.  This way she will feel needed, but not given the opportunity to take over.|`|b8f0CfSsaa	Your not wrong, you probably just feel rude because it is a case of 'The straw that broke the camels back'.<br>  <br>  She does sound pushy, but that is probably because she is away from her grand kids for most of the year. Just try and play to her better nature by saying 'I really appreciate all your help when you come over, but your my guest and I love playing the host!' also tell her how important making your daughters cake yourself is and that she can feel free to contribute in some other way, eg. making cup cakes or something (so much easier to not mess up!)<br>  <br>  As for the steak thing....ermmm, ask her to make a casserole or something (I've never tried braising steak so I don't know how it could be used!)<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  x|`|t2x7Cr6Gaa	No i'd go mad!!! ... Just tell your man and ask what he thinks you should do, maybe he'll have a chat with her. If he starts the it's my mum she's  only trying to help reply by saying.. well she's not really helping and she is making me feel uncomfortable in my own home, would you please  have a word with her. He will probably tell her and she might be a bit weird with you but that's the perfect time to sit her down and back up what your man has talk to her about. Tell her you appreciate she is just trying to help, but you like doing things in your own home, it's you daughters birthday cake not her daughters, if i was you i would just tell her how you feel. Say i like you but i don't like how you are being in my home , tell her you love having her visit but she doesn't need to help with anything , even tell her to sit down and relax, after all shes meant to be on holiday. Try asking your man first anyway. These are only my opinions , so just some suggestions to try n help you out, hope they give you some idea of what to do.. Good luck.|`|uE0jhj9Qaa	I have issues with my mum in law sometimes. I thinks thats just what happens. But this is what id do if I were you. TAKE OFF. Not like leave but let someone else run the house for awhile. Seriously, go get your nails done sit in the sun, read a book. DO as little as possible. She only comes for a short bit and is completely gone the rest of the year. When else can you catch up on things you wish you could do but are too busy doing the mommy maid wifey thing. I say take a break, if she cooks bad think about if you cooked bad and she was complaining to your hub or you? That would hurt you, You are a mom and that feeling never goes away...she wants to mommy you all and I think you should let her. Thats ahat she is so let her have at it and you can be the kid again. It was kinda rude when she was trying to be nice and help. But Ive been rude too. I dont have a mil millions of miles away...mine is "better at everything" mom and lives 30 min away.  Criticizing tyou is a problem, not trying to fix diner or dust or anything else.
add1238669d46216eb94b39fb19e0553aa	well its possible as i always tell people that tell me they cant be pregnant because they were on the pill, "meet my daughter madeline" i was on the pill for years when i got pregnant with her!!!|`|yPNvecc7aa	Well it SOUNDS like pregnancy. <br>  HOWEVER, you are on the pill. I've scared myself a couple of times while I was on the pill too and my fears were all unfounded. I went to my Doctor, who both times, confirmed that I wasn't pregnant. She would ask "Why did you think you were pregnant?" and I would feel really stupid that it took me taking a trip all the way down there just to realize the reason I was nauseous was because I had a couple of beers the night before (or something stupid like that). Then she would pat my knee and say "Just keep taking your pill dear."<br>  <br>  Who knows why we do this to ourselves!? Just take a pee test and I'm sure it will turn out negative. Good luck!|`|4WASY7QWaa	Well, I wish that i could make you feel better, but I really cant. What I can do is tell you that you could make yourself feel better by taking that pregnancy test. You did miss a pill and if you had sex you could be pregnant. Also was your period a normal one? If it was lighter than usual, lasted shorter that normal or just wasn't the same it could have been implantation bleeding. Just take the test to make sure. Good luck!|`|AA11451321	Hi<br>  I am 14 weeks pregnant today, and i gag every morning when i brush my teeth, sometimes throwing up my breakfast!

Its too early to test so you will have to wait to know for sure but I think its too early to be feeling nauseous.<br>  <br>  |`|n9qY46Svaa	Birth control is not 100% effective, and can still cause you to have a period even if you are pregnant.<br>  <br>  Sorry for not making you feel better but - your symptoms sound like early pregnancy to me.  It's time to test.|`|wQgVN6KTaa	If you had your period I doubt you're pregnant.  Take a test to ease your mind.  You could be getting a bug...it is that time of year.

Not all teen pregnancy are irresponsible and ruin peoples lives.  Heck, back in the 70's most parents were teenagers!!<br>  <br>  Personally, I would have been a shocking parent in my teens and didn't have my first baby until I was 34.  Now, some people may think that having a baby in my 30's is irresponsible and not fair on the child as the generation gap will be too wide.<br>  <br>  Your life is what you make it.

Some of there parents will through them out, they will drop out of school, they could really resent there baby.|`|9ko5WUFkaa	It's hard for you to see right now, but as you get older you are going to realise that there were a lot of things you missed out on by being a mum so young.  At 16 you kind of think you know everything but there is so much to learn about life.  I don't think being a mother young ruins your life, but there are a lot of things you will never do, or will have to wait until you are older and they won't quite be the same.  Getting a good eductaion is very hard when your a mother - it can be done but you have to be committed.  Without a good education you will be very lucky if you ever get a decent job.  Your teen years are the only time in your life that you will be that age and have the freedoms that go along with it.  You don't have to pay rent or a mortgage, you don't have many bills, once you are in your late teens you have the freedom to come and go as you please, you can get jobs and quit the crappy ones and any money you have you are free to spend as you see fit.  You can fall in and out of love, you can travel the world or you can buy a cheap car and drive around your own country.  You only get one youth.  You are meant to have fun and make mistakes - being a parent doesn't give you the same life lessons.  It gives you different ones, about early responsibilty and how to deal with missing out on these things while the people around you are enjoying them. <br>  Now I realise that the things I've mentioned are selfish endevours, but they help you learn about the world you live in.  Being a teenage parent seriously reduces you opportunities to do these things.  I don't think for a second that a teen can't be a good parent - one of my best friends had her son at 16 and has been one of the best mothers I know.  But by the time she was 25 she realised that there were a lot of things she wished she had done.  She also realised that what she thought she knew at 16 was nothing - she finally understood that she was still a kid when she had her child and still had so much growing up to do.  <br>  <br>  As you get older you'll understand better what I'm trying to say - regardless of how self-sufficent you are, you'll learn there is more to life.  I just hope you don't regret the choices you made while you were still a kid.  I'm not saying you'll regret having your child, but you might see what chances you've missed by having one so early in your life.|`|76hhm6Quaa	it doesn't mean your whole life is ruined, but your education is importan|`|lg5Jgl80aa	Its just because most older people think that people like us cant cope with the responsibility but we can and you have to. I was in the middle of doing my GCSE when i fell pregnant, i was on the pill so it wasn't planned but my life is far from ruined my daughter is the best thing that has ever happened to me and im still with her father. Im only just 18 and my daughter will be 1 next month. just don't take any notice. My health visitor told me that its a fact that young mums turn out to be better parents cause there less or a difference in age and you Connect better.
7edddef837f9013ff2f1f46a6893dcb7aa	I'm 36 weeks pregnant with my first child, and she was a complete surprise.  Because of past medical problems, I knew that I would probably not be able to have biological kids and I was ok with that. The day I found out I was pregnant, I went to the doctor having mentally prepared myself for the 'it's time for a hysterectomy' conversation.  You can only imagine my surprise when the ultrasound showed a 12-week fetus instead of the expected endometriosis build-ups and ovarian cysts. I had been taking BC pills to help with cramps and to relieve endometriosis symptoms, and because I thought I was probably infertile, I didn't think I would get pregnant by missing a week of pills. surprise!!<br>  <br>  My husband and I had only been married for 5 months at the time, and to be totally honest, it took a few days for us to absorb the surprise.  We were not planning to try to have children or adopt a child for quite some time. We wanted to enjoy life with just the two of us for a while longer.  But, even though we hadn't been married for long, we had been together for over 4 years. And we're in our 30's and each have good engineering jobs with insurance and other nice benefits...so, we're in good shape. <br>  <br>  After getting over the initial surprise, we're really excited to welcome this new little person into our lives.  We can't wait to meet her!|`|qi6mAsCZaa	Both were planned. It didn't really sink in until later. I loved being pregnant with the first one. I guess since I know what is happening and what WILL happen, I'm just ready to get this one over with and see the baby. I enjoyed the pregnancy when i could feel him. Until then, it kinda sucks cause of the sickness and fatigue. It's still amazing to think of how your body is creating another human being! It is worth it all the suffering (lol) when the baby is finally here!|`|hg2QGI0Zaa	1st was unexpected.. I was 14 and dumb. I got depressed.<br>  2nd was unexpected.. I was 16 and on the pill.

Pregnancy itself isn't the greatest but it is amazing knowing I'm pregnant and that our baby girl is going to be here in less than 4 months. I'm so excited and nervous.|`|IXqCB5oqaa	All  of my soon to be 6 children have been planned except one, after I had my twins I was nursing them around 14 months of age and I never had a period.

I felt overwhelmed and unorganized, had a rocky relationship with my husband at the time as well, I still wouldn't take a moment of it back though. |`|DkEYzONuaa	1st we had talked about it, but had not said ok lets do it.  Yet at the same time we were not really using protection.  We were thrilled when we found out I was pregnant.<br>  2nd we had talked about it and decided to start trying.  I got pregnant a little faster than expected, but again we are thrilled.<br>  We will have 2 little princesses running around.|`|PnHcsa47aa	Neither of my boys were planned, and I was panicked at first, but came around.

r4N3R0dtaa	Yes and no, it depends on your situation. If you're expecting your period and are experiencing a light brown spotting instead there is a possibility that it's implantation bleeding. If you're already pregnant sometimes it could signify that something may be wrong and it's best to check with your doctor. If you past 36 weeks pregnant it could signify the start of losing your mucus plug.   |`|QBKzvw4faa	Yes.. I think so.. Most my friends had discharge when they were preggers.. usually around the time they should have had their period.. |`|27xxWLrdaa	If it was only a little bit...I'm sure you are ok. Your body is going through a lot of changes right now.|`|qOBYfdlBaa	how far along are you?  i had that in the beginning of my pregnancy and at the end when i started losing my mucus plug.  you're prolly okay but if you're worried ask your doctor.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Yes! It is implantation bleeding

IRFbj0G9aa	I am sorry to say this but your BF seems to suffer from a superiority complex.  And it sounds like he's a quite condescending towards you.  I feel you.  You do not want a yes man. You want a man that understands you and where you are coming from.   Not one that needs  to give you a moral lesson about society everyday and make it about himself, have you noticed that by putting you on the defensive it stops being about you and it becomes about him and what he feels about the situation.  This person thinks a bit too much of himself and just wants to hear himself at every opportunity that is why it happens all the time.   This person I am sorry to say does not sound like he is looking  for an adult relationship that includes love and admiration and support ( even if you are being a bit caddy he will see past it and know why you are being like that).  I think he needs to put you down cause he feels so bad about himself.  I think you analyzed it pretty well, you don't seem like a lady who lives in a dream bubble?  Question is what are you going to do about it?  Are you going to continue to live like this?  Do you really need someone taking you down a noch or two on a daily basis.  Heck I don't know you from atom, and I get what you're saying about the neighbour.  And in regards to the b**** I would stop  being so nice, why don't you throw the kindness and consideration towards some other mom who is deserving and appreciative and perhaps needs it more?  And FYI for your BF why can he be caddy and call her a B**** when he chooses so but you are not allowed to let loose and be a bit caddy in the privacy of your own home?  Tell him to get a life and leave the pseudo social babble for his mirror.  Cause honey that is the only place he feels comfortable.  I know I have bashed the man you love but maybe you should start think about moving along?  Do you really need to show your kids that this is how it is supposed to be, that love means being undermined and belittled.|`|5ci9IZd2aa	Sounds like you need to move on from your boyfriend and your neighbor. It sounds like your getting used. Your neighbor sounds like the type who expects certain things and is not appreciative of the favors your doing. Why your bf would side with a neighbor who is using you> the only thing I could think of is maybe he hates confrontation, so when you get mad at this lady he doesn't want it to go that far, so he trys to put out the flame.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	While I certainly understand what you're saying, I'd just say I think it might just be a personality type.  Does he do the same thing to other people? I have a natural tendency to do the same thing ... if somebody says white, my first thought is "well, why not black?"  It's a useful skill for a lawyer (I was always the one anticipating the arguments that the other side would use) but admittedly annoying in interpersonal relationships.....  I'm just trying to say that as annoying as it is, it isn't necessarily passive aggressiveness as just the way he thinks.  At least it is for me.  So I wouldn't get upset that he might have deep negative motives, because he very well may not.<br>  <br>  That said, I'm not a complete clod, and if in a quiet moment someone told me that that particular habit of mine was making them upset, I would do my best to bite my tongue next time.  So you might try that.|`|wUooHVU3aa	Sounds like you are matched/paired up with a self proclaimed "problem solver". Instead of being able to listen, sympathize and discuss with you, he's dead set on solving your issue. There is little you can do to change this person or his attitude. Don't count on it to change over time, for him to reach some level where he "stops" or for him to realize what he is doing bothers you, and working on changing.

KBirCZGFaa	I'm in the exact same situation! I'm expecting, and my boy will be 1 and 5 months when the new baby comes.  I tried this "Toilet Training in Less Than a Day" method, and it worked wonders!<br>  <br>  I did the training on Feb. 11th at 8:30 a.m. His last accident of the day was at 11:00 am, and by that time, he was going to the potty all by himself when he felt the urge, pulling down his own pants, peeing in the little potty, pulling up his own pants, dumping his urin in the toilet flushing the toilet, and returning the potty bowl to the potty chair. All on his own! He had two more accidents over the next 3 days. Potty Training was on Wed, and his last accidnent was Saturday. It has now been 2 weeks, and he has kept his pants dry in his big boy underwear. I don't even have to remind him! I just sit and read a magazine while he takes care of his own business!<br>  <br>  Do you want to know how this is possible? Get this book: "Toilet-Training in Less Than a Day." I checked it out at the library, read it carefully, took notes, and followed it as closely as I could. All of my friends scoffed, but they were wrong! It worked! <br>  <br>  Overall, the process was exahusting for me because I was giving constant praise and instruction for 4-6 hours. But my son loved it! He got constant attention from his mom, and special treats and drinks. He thought it was a game, and had a lot of fun. <br>  <br>  The reason a lot of moms don't do this is because (a) they haven't heard of it - the potty-traning trend lately is to nearly let kids teach themselves OR (b) it takes too much preperation. To be prepared, you have to read the book carefully, you need to have half-a-day for just this. There should be no other kids around or distractions like toys or TV. It's best to even have snacks and lunch prepared ahead of time. Not every mom can do this, but I could because I stay home and have no other kids. OR (c) if you have tried another method, and the child has experienced failure, this method might not work so well.<br>  <br>  So, how does it work? <br>  I am not going to tell you because I can't write that much here! It's a 100 page book, and if you try to cut corner or wing it from what I say, it won't be done right. But, to give you an idea, it a lot of verbal instruction, manual guidanc with your hands on the child's to help him along, constant praise from the moment the child begins following instruction, special treats for rewards. The doctors who developed the program, used what they know about accelerating the learning process: Learningi s best done with not distractions or interruptions. Learning is best understood through teaching (the child teaches a doll first). Learning is quickly accomplished through lots of practice in a small window of time.<br>  <br>  This was an effective way of potty-training. It was 100% positive and fun for my son. I tell everyone I know.|`|q1y7kgnEaa	u can start potty training as soon as your son shows it....like...starts taking his diaper off, shows interest in your toilet, can point to his private area to show u he went potty, can say he went, buy him a potty chair, take him to the bathroom with u whenever u go....i didnt start my kids until 2, but it  can be done before then, if your son is ready, u cant force it on him, u have to make sure he is ready, he will tell u, or show u in ways, if u get him a potty seat, and he will sit on it, try giving him something while he sits on it to make it more enjoyable, let him flush your toilet so he can see what happens when he potties, i was reading up on a site earlier, it said that when your child dirtys the diaper, drop it into the toilet while he watches u and then flush it down the toilet while he watches so he can see what happens when he potties and how u get rid of it....be sure to reward him when he does use it, dont punish if he sits on it but doesnt use it....it could take a couple months or more...what helped for my kids, i took them to the potty with me everytime i went and if i didnt go very often, i would take them like every 15 to 20 minutes, u could also put a cheerio or 2 in the toilet and let him aim for it, i gave my son a book to look at when he was sitting on his....if u want to know anything else, i might be able to help further, feel free to message me on yahoo, mommyoftwo20 is my screen name....hope this helped|`|XrBtVkvMaa	Oh dear! The memories! Oh, your question hit me right in the heart. I think my aorta is about to plum explode, darn it!  I had a very similar question to yours, not ten or fifteen-point-five-and three-quarters years ago, or sommat, when rearing my own youngings.  Excuse my southern lingo, deary me, oh deary Lordy, I know it can be hard to interpret, for you mere Northerners.<br>  I was raised among the cattle of my two daddies' farm in Alabama.  During this time sleeping and feeding among the cows, through the most maternal and truly spiritual of their birth rituals, I learnt alot about rearing youngings, namely calves, but I soon realised, from the age of five in fact, that this wasn't in the very tiddly widdly least very different from rearing human youngings! No diddly dee it ain't!<br>  So when I joined in with the Grand Priestess Mama Cow, during her birth ceremony (wherein she dipped her honey-sugar cowlets forehead in the Rivers of Phoenix, then let it play among the daffodilly-ohs of the Garden of Eden, smoking tobacco while hanging angelically from the vines of the trees) I was simply humbled to be a part of the potty-traning rituals of the Western-Honey-Ham-Bruschetta Cows! Oh deary I, oh deary me! Oh Lordy, twas an experience, if nothing is and nothing ain't! <br>  Hence when I moved to Egypt and lived on the second floor of the Sphinx, with my twelve babies and Daddy Bull, I was simply graciously gobsmackedly pleased-as-punch, to be able to serve my kiddies well in teaching them how to release their bowels on the deep and historically fertile sands of Egypt.  And like sands through the hourglass, so are the days of our lives.<br>  Indeedy, well I'm glad to lend my services to you deary and truly hope that this is of some assistance.  As George W. Bush is living evidence of, only Southern maternal instincts can rear good livestock! Oh Lordy!|`|aQFtHspwaa	He will let you know when he is ready. Wait until he shows interest in going on his own. If you pressure him it will only make the process harder for both of you.|`|Pi8KfmOxaa	i started very young with my first child and it went on an on we cracked for weeks at a time then back to square one lol,my second child i was adviced by my health visitor to wait till she was nearer 2 1/2 as often if you try to early they regress back to wetting,so i tried that and she was dry day and night in a week and we never had another accident again|`|X6BrtJ9eaa	If I were you I would wait until he shows some awareness that he has wet himself. This is more difficult in these days of "stay dry" nappies! (I used terry towelling nappies for all 6 of my children so it was a lot easier, because they didn't like the feeling of being wet). I used different methods with all my children. The boys used to shuffle on their bottoms instead of crawling and when one of them got severe nappy rash at 10 months the health visitor suggested putting him on the potty for 20 minutes a day to let the air get to him, so I used to read him a story or 2 and he was dry during the day when he was about 13 months. On the other hand one of my daughters was nearly 3 years old before she was dry during the day, so I just had to clean up after her as we ran out of plastic pants because she was too big and I wasn't going to start buying disposables for a 3 year-old. Another would not use the potty at all, then we hit on the idea of a toilet trainer seat and sure enough she wanted to go to the toilet just like mummy!<br>  There is no hard and fast rule.<br>  Good luck:-)
7paub0N9aa	Well you COULD possibly tell as early as 14 weeks but typically you can always tell by 16 weeks.  Most doctors will schedule the ultrasound between 16 and 22 weeks because they don't technically do the ultrasound for the sex of the baby, they do it to see the heart, lungs etc. <br>  so they have to wait till at least 16 weeks or more to be sure they will get that information.<br>  <br>  Good luck and Congrats on your new addition to your family!!  <br>  How exciting!!!  ; )<br>  KG  <3<br>  |`|6frr3VM0aa	I was involved in a car accident at 14weeks3days. I was given an ultrasound to make sure my son was okay..and found out that day his sex.<br>  <br>  Usually dr's wont schedule it before 18 weeks because its hard to tell and would be a waste of time and money.|`|hVUseUFkaa	17 weeks you can find out...<br>  <br>  But where I go make you wait till you're 20 weeks so that they can do a full check over on the baby. Was so worth the extra to weeks (so impatient, seemed to take forever)|`|AA11495320	I found out at 17 weeks with my first baby, but they made me wait until 24 weeks to find out this time. I don't know why. My first was a boy and now I'm pregnant with a girl!|`|RSAOwUEqaa	the doctors usually like to do them between 18 to 22 weeks. i got mine at 22 weeks. i wanted one at 16 but my doctor wanted to wait. good luck!|`|nvyDTvQdaa	most dr's do one between 18-22 weeks.  However, sometimes you can tell earlier, it all just depends on the dr.|`|50e0975b0e8c470ea8e974086f449b63aa	I would say 16-17 depending on babies position |`|e7BJuW2Caa	This is my first and I find out on Nov. 7th by then I will be 18w2d.  <br>  BTW Congrats!!!|`|zwctZ812aa	your doctor probably couldnt tell before 16 weeks, so I wouldn't get my hopes up for that.  It really depends on when your doctor schedules the ultrasound to check the baby's anatomy.  most doctors do the ultrasound to confirm the pregnancy, and then one between 18 and 22 weeks to check anatomy, and then one towards the end to check the baby's position.  usually your best chance for finding out the sex is at the 18-22 weeks appointment, but i had an ultrasound at 19 weeks, and another at 24, and the tech couldnt tell the sex at either one! i had to wait until i was 28 weeks and had a 4-d one done (out of pocket) cuz i wanted to know so bad! good luck, i hope your baby cooperates!|`|ed45267264b8e14db51a0d554e40d2a3aa	With my first son found out at 20 weeks, and am expecting again found out at 18 weeks. I don't want too early than 17 weeks because they can not know the gender for sure. |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I know most doctors wait until your 20 week ultrasound but my friend had a lot of problems in her pregnancy so they were doing ultrasounds once a week and she found out at 12 weeks. I think most of the time they'll wait til later so that they get a more accurate result. Congrats!!|`|YX1NeQJyaa	Earliest to get an accurate read is 18 weeks. Wouldn't recommend any earlier than that because things can change. After 20 weeks you'll have an even more accurate read. Though it can be done earlier, I would wait til at least 18-20 weeks.|`|MtC3CWZraa	16 or 17 is about as early as you can get a reliable result. |`|ByUS0k8waa	20 weeks is the normal to find out the sex. 
lXTA58vsaa	type it into wikipedia|`|zQWNb6neaa	Ovulating is when the ovaries release an egg. It happens once a menstrual cycle, usually around the middle of the cycle.|`|dqSA7j7gaa	You need to go to fertilityfriend.com, and read their website.<br>  Or look it up on the internet.|`|1557866d22112c5c71c048ca6dd77616aa	when a woman has her period she usually ovulates (releases an egg to be fertilized).  Some women do not ovulate every month.  When the egg is fertilized then you will have a baby.  Most women will pass the egg when they have their period.<br>  <br>  Women track their ovulation to increase their chances of getting pregnant because they will want to have sex on the days that they are ovulating.<br>  <br>  Maybe you should talk to your parents about the "birds and the bees"....<br>  <br>  Hope this helped.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It's hard to explain ovulation. It's best to google it or something to get a better definition. It happens once a month like a period does. 
PUMIYkw8aa	I am being told the same thing! Frustrating isnt it!? I dont think there is such a thing as being over prepared- and i like to point that out whenever anyone says anything to the effect. We're new moms: we're excited, scared, and want things to be just right for our new little one. WHAT is wrong with that? Keep up the good work mamma :D|`|sRdUy663aa	Hey dear cool, there is nothing wrong. its always good to be prepared. rather than waiting till the last minute. Its your baby, you can buy stuff you want to, there is no question of others expecting you to do things their way. And yeah you are doing this because you know under what circumstances you are doing it.. so just ignore your friends for their comments. Good Luck.|`|zRipwNLOaa	sounds like my life...im a marine wife and in nc and nearest family is in ca and hi  and being in a military town friends come-then get orders and are gone... im not expecting a baby shower either and I have been getting things together since the start of my 2nd trimester...do whats right for you and forget them.|`|513baad318d6fe572e9a3f122067f767aa	im around 21 weeks and i got nothing waiting to see what i get if not ill go get it after since the baby ain't going to need it all at once.<br>  <br>  i think i haven't gotten anything ready since i don't know the sex yet|`|AA11661793	Its better to be prepared then not prepared and rushing at the end. Good luck!|`|0fe4f3702c5dd1a403524194d3e9fabdaa	I wish I was as prepared as you are! I am 18 weeks & have registered for a few things but nothing major yet. But I just found out at 15 weeks what we were having & Its been crazy lately with the holidays & my husband getting laid off. But after the holidays I plan on cleaning out the baby's room & painting it. Then when we get our taxes back we will buy furniture. I have already started thinking about where are baby will stay when I go back to work. Its never to early to start planning & preparing! When you get bigger you arent going to feel like decorating your baby's room & who knows the baby might come early & you want to be prepared. Don't listen to your freinds! Just do whatever you want! Congrats & Good Luck!|`|UXRwYHrMaa	everyone prepares for a baby differently, and no one can tell you the right way for *you*. This is great preparation for the rest of your life as a mother. People will always be offering unsolicited advice about the right way to do things, or how you are doing something wrong.<br>  <br>  I think your friend's comment is probably well intended. Most of my friends are super excited to find a way to be a part of the baby's life, and one thing that they are looking forward to is picking out the stuff for the baby that will be from them. They like thinking that they bought the baby the high chair etc. So perhaps you could just think of some less necessary things, or things you can never get too much of (diapers, shampoo etc), or things you don't have yet (fancy ear thermometer), or even a big ticket dream item (sliding rocker) and reassure them that you would love their help and having them be part of the whole baby process.<br>  <br>  As for a baby sitter, what is the harm in preparing early? I don't see any. Just tell your friends that who you leave your child with is a big and important decision for you. You respect their opinion, but you feel that you will be able to enjoy the remainder of your pregnancy more at ease if you know that things are set up.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I'm 25 weeks pregnant and I'm pretty much in the same situation as you except that I don't even have friends where I'm at. I pretty much have already went out and bought everything except for a few things. I don't think it is too early. I know that I waited until we knew the sex of the baby before we went all out but if you know that you aren't gonna be getting much or anything at all it's nice to start so that you don't have to buy everything all at once. Don't feel bad. Congrats!|`|0zzAUTZjaa	Congratulatons!!! It's great to be prepared. You are nesting. They grow fast so don't buy too many of the same sized clothes. and remember to take care of yourself too. Relax a bit. God knows you will wish you could get some rest after the baby comes.|`|n2r1F6TVaa	I think what you are doing is very good. preparing early is never a bad habbit. The problem is with your friends , if they bother you so much just walk up to them and tell them its good to prepare early and they shouldnt treat you negatively for any reason. youre only doing whats right... good luck :D|`|add1238669d46216eb94b39fb19e0553aa	i dont think your over prepared at all sounds like your thinking like a mommy. you are making sure your child has everything as soon as he/she gets here and thats great. as for daycare its never to early to start looking at different daycares and interviewing them.|`|ZSSUfSXwaa	I wouldnt say there's nothing wrong about that... I'll say you're extremely efficient!! You're 21 weeks you say!! WOW my hat's off to you...<br>  <br>  I think it's great that you're prepared for your baby. And whatever you get at your shower you get and if you get doubles well Im sure you could exchange it for something else you need. However I would slow down... you're only 21 weeks.. there's no need to be panicking about a sitter etc... and to be honest you wont be able to be sure about the person till you see her interacting with your baby. There's no other way, of course you can check references, and credentials... but what worked for some might not work for you... and viceversa. <br>  <br>  And you will get things, not just at your shower but from friends and family, a baby is a different thing, people teng to gush all over them, and send gifts and stuff. <br>  <br>  There's no reason to feel guilty about buying your own baby stuff that's part of the fun;) Enjoy pregnancy, relax!!!! You look like you're very excited about this baby and it's wonderful, but not need to fret... just slowly but steadily...|`|379adf8ec6ff418678fc28b78cee178baa	As far as choosing a babysitter i dont think you can be too carefull or start looking too soon. Most people/places who are worth a darn have waiting lists a year long so absolutely be looking NOW if you know you will need someone right way. Plus, you want to feel confident in who you do choose so i would recommend visiting and observing as mush as possible now. I just had a baby shower and as thankful as i am for what i got i did NOT get the things that i need, just a bunch of "cute" clothes which i already have a ton of! When i was preg with my first i thought i needed everything and had to have it ready way in advance, but once my daughter was born i looked around at all the stuff and realized that all she REALLY needed was a fully tummy, a clean bottom, and her mother's loving arms. These are things that we have to learn on our own, so just keep doing what youre doing and enjoy your pregnancy!|`|98WKYtfwaa	Don't worry, i'm in the same boat, i've not bought anything for my baby yet but i've been looking and planning everything out. My friends are saying i'm silly as i've got plenty time, my family seem to think i shouldn't think ahead as i don't know what's gonna happen.<br>  <br>  It's really annoying. Just tell them that this is your baby and you wanna be prepared, if they question the baby shower, tell them you don't expect to get everything off a couple of friends since you don't have many good friends in the city and you have little or no family. They should understand.|`|CdodhnP5aa	Don't worry about what they think you do what you feel is right and you can register for whatever you think you still need prior to the shower. And honestly I would rather get gift cards than people buying whatever they wanted for me, then you can get diapers and formula (if you don't breast feed)ETC.<br>  And if getting on your nerves about you being excited and buying things for the new baby tell them I will have a registry and you are more than welcome to purchase the baby items he/she needs from the list I've provided I was just so excited to get things ready I couldn't wait.|`|Ed7qNFdzaa	if your going to have to go back to work right away, your friends are foolish to think you shouldn't be working on that now. do these people have children? or are they people who's mom are watching their children? you don't have that option. many qualified day care providers are booked up for a year in advance, you DO need to be worried about this now. <br>  <br>  also, you have no idea if you are going to have a baby shower. if no one steps up to throw you one, you will be left in the lurch at the end of your pregnancy trying to get it together. my suggestion is don't tell these people about what you've bought. continue to prepare regardless, and if someone steps up to throw you a shower, register for the things you haven't gotten yet. <br>  <br>  save some of the big items for the end. like the stroller/car seat/infant carrier/bathtub/high chair/ crib/crib comforter set.<br>  <br>  now if you've already got all that stuff. wow, you are efficient. and your friends are just mad that they won't have anything to get you. LOL. but they will get over it.<br>  <br>  :)

If its the ultrasound you are going for yet they will try to hear the heart beat  and also print a picture of the dot lol your baby. |`|13ba52d1d8f776526728149760b05c93aa	Yes, they will do an internal exam, but they don't always do an ultrasound. It depends on your midwife. It's actually not too bad, but be prepared with any questions you may have. Congratulations!|`|5JB1fHz9aa	They probably won't do an ultrasound unless you have already scheduled one.  Depending on your doctor you will have to do blood work either in the office or in a different one.  At my doctors they just tested to see if I was pregnant and then two weeks later I went back for more blood work and an internal exam.  Than I scheduled an ultrasound and by then it wasn't a spec...and even at 9 weeks you will be able to see the baby clearly.|`|df378c28318ff6097f7f272b0367e6cbaa	My doctor did an ultrasound because its the only way to get the heartbeat at this point in your pregnancy.  He also did a pap and  I had lab from which they drew tons of blood!  You will also need to pee in a cup.|`|AA12033653	At my first appointment they did a vaginal exam, a urine test, Blood pressure check, weight check, and they sent me for blood work.  Some doctors offices do the blood work on site, mine does not.  My first appointment did not have a sonogram, my first sonogram was at 12 weeks.  <br>  <br>  Also, your doctor will go over what you should stay away from, food, medications etc.  They will also talk to you about what to expect going forward with your appointments.  |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	If they do an ultrasound then they will show you it. But I know that a lot of people don't get ultrasounds until they are further along to check for certain defects. If they do an ultrasound then yes they will give you a copy of it. Congrats!|`|SfymamWtaa	no you just take a urine test and some blood work,weight and blood pressure they might schedule you for a sonogram|`|gccK6q20aa	i got my first one done at 8 weeks and they gave me pictures. he looked like a little peanut
nsqGQFj3aa	it only sank in for me about a week after i had him. but when it does its the most amazing feeling in the world. the feeling of, i would literally do absolutely anything to stop this little baby from being hurt - anything. you would die for him, you would kill for him. that's what being a mum is all about. congratulations and keep safe x|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	I'm 38wk 4d and it hasn't sunk in for me yet. I don't think it will sink in until i've had her. I can't wait!|`|69DjSUVAaa	It took me right up towards the end of my pregnancy to sink in that i was going to have a baby at the end of it all. Up until then i just enjoyed being pregnant. Now i love being a Mummy x|`|q7HvkRpyaa	It didn't really sink in this time until the 20 week ultrasound when we found out it's a girl. The first time I took several tests and it sunk in at the first ultrasound. It will really sink in for you either when you find out what it is or when you start showing a little. Congrats to you.|`|0RFUKkBLaa	Im 15 weeks and it still hasnt kicked in for me either especially as i dont have many symptoms. My friend is due in 6 weeks time and she said its only starting to kick in a little to her now. Prob wont be until we have our gorgeous babies in our arms|`|kcGFK36Waa	it hasn't really sunk into me either. And I'm 39 weeks. BUT think it will once I see my baby girl!|`|ARAYm7BLaa	About 2 weeks after the birth|`|zoyw8CRKaa	I am now 14 weeks and it started to sink into my brain when i was about 12 weeks when i had seen my baby pn the screen for the 1st time up to that point i was very nervous even to the point where i said to my hubby what if we go and there is no baby. From then on it hit me and i actually started to get excited. Every women is different mentally and you need to relax a little more and enjoy it talk to your baby bond as your gonna be a mummy now and that's a amazing feeling.<br>  <br>  Good luck with baby xx|`|782343119cddb699707bd00049d73fe9aa	For me, it has gone in stages. Its hard to explain, but I'll do my best. The first time I felt her kick while I was pregnant was amazing. All I could think was I actually have a human being growing inside me. That's when I started having my doubts whether I'd be a good mommy or not. It became more and more real with every ultrasound I could see her grow. After I gave birth and held my baby girl for the first time, it really set in. I am a mommy. She's 7 weeks tomorrow and I still look at her in amazement. I can't believe after trying so hard, that my husband and I are parents finally!|`|433165e2c7b432dcd07898d64f6f19c8aa	I'm 29 weeks pregnant with twins and it still hasn't sunk in for me yet either! Carrying real little people inside you is an amazing wonder, and my husband and i still look at each other in amazement sometimes that its real. I dont think i'll actually become accustomed to being a mummy until our sons are here.. Good luck to you!|`|d6dzoHvvaa	I feel the same way I will be 10 weeks tom. and it still hasn't really kicked in yet. I mean I am excited and everything but I don't think it will hit me until I start showing maybe or maybe when I hear the heartbeat which will be in 2 weeks. Good luck and congrats!|`|c9NuCZnaaa	My son is 8 months old and i still can't believe im a mom! It didnt really hit until a day or two afterwards though. I didnt get to hold my baby for long before i was whisked away for emergency op. So we didnt bond that well. After a couple of days of having him though it finally sunk in. When everyone started giving me cards and such that had mummy and daddy written in :)|`|DRb4Qlypaa	It sunk in for me somewhat when I heard the heartbeat on the ultrasound, but all women are not the same. I am 9 weeks 5 days now and i was 7 weeks 6 days when I had my ultrasound, it still is hard to believe sometimes.|`|XwjjKkPCaa	I know Nikki i'm 10 weeks along and i dont feel like im really going to be a mummy!<br>  <br>  Its strange but exciting!<br>  <br>  xxx|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I don't think it sunk in until my 20 week ultrasound. I had one at 7 weeks and saw my baby but it didn't look like a baby at that point. I also had a blood test at 3 weeks to confirm it and it still didn't sink in. I just kept thinking that somehow they made a mistake. We tried for so long and now it's finally happening and I just couldn't believe it. But when I saw her at 20 weeks and she looked like a baby it finally sank in. Plus, once you start feeling the baby move and kick and you look at your belly and see all the jolts it's so real. I can't wait.|`|9PKq01sAaa	i am in the same situation like you. 8 weeks and 3 days, and i do the same question. ''am i really pregnant'' and all the day thinking about the baby.this is my 1st pregnancy after a long time trying. i have my first ultrasound on the 13th of february and the time is passing so slow, i am already thinking about the things that we are going to buy and we even decided the names.<br>  Well good luck|`|iYVsKhFhaa	it takes a while for it to sink in trust me... im 22 weeks and i still dont feel like a mom or anything maybe untill your angel come to this world and you get to hold him/her in your arms and just be with them will let you noe that you are a mom|`|2fTQ0b0Baa	It took me until after I took my son home for the hospital for it to really sink in. My mom was worried during my pregnancy cause she could see it didn't kick in. Don't worry it will.|`|6GZPaqtFaa	im 30 weeks n hav days when it kicks in n days when it doesnt! sure its normal!|`|XxfwFdY9aa	My daughter is 6 and I still can't get my head around it sometimes. I love being a mum though, I just find it a bit mind blowing|`|mSPGjNsEaa	You will know when you have the baby Good Luck Hon !!|`|yMHs4V9kaa	It is so funny my husband and I talk about this a lot, he felt like a daddy right away and sometimes I still don't feel like I am. When she was first born I had this baby that needed me and it felt great but with all the comotion it still didn't sink in. Really when she was about a year old on her birthday and she had a personality and wasnot so so dependent it kicked in a little but now that we are having number to it has really kicked in for me. For you it probably won't until you really start to feel the baby and then when you see the baby. There are little stages that just kinda come up and make you feel more mommy-ish:)

5JB1fHz9aa	My baby has been measuring two weeks ahead and my midwife isn't concerned with the weight of the baby, but she might not let me go to my due date if he is big.  My first was 8 pounds 8 ounces, but he as late and I had him vaginally with no complications except tearing, but that happens to a lot of woman.  I know with my first my midwife just felt my tummy and guessed his weight, but with this one no one has done that I am going to get an ultrasound this Friday to see how big the baby is.  So you could have a larger baby or your due date might be off or you may even have too much amniotic fluid.  I wouldn't stress about it unless your doctor is.|`|oXzHvsBpaa	Yes my doctor did it just buy "picking up my stomach" He guessed abut 7.5lbs and this was the day before I was induced. He was right on also. My baby weight 7lbs 7 oz at birth. There is no way for you to do it yourself though. If your doctor didn't bring it up then your baby is right on. I also asked what my babies weight was when they did sonograms so I would know.<br>  <br>  Edit: They also did a ultrasound the day that I was induced. They also said about 7.5 lbs and like I said they were exact. Though before that every ultrasound was a 1lb off most of the time. I was told that I was going to have a big baby in the beginning around 9lbs or so. They were wrong.|`|eV7rtxmuaa	I had the same concern. However ultrasounds arent always accurate. I had a ultrasound at 39 weeks to get an idea on the weight of my baby and i was told 9 pounds 8 ounces. I gave birth to a 8 pound baby at 40 weeks 5 days.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I think that if the doctors were concerned about your baby's weight then they would have done an ultrasound to check it. They must not be too concerned. Good luck and Congrats!|`|FSY30gbvaa	Your weight has no dependence on the baby's size. <br>  <br>  For example:<br>  I gain 80lbs in my first pregnancy. Had a 10lb 11oz baby. <br>  2nd pregnancy gained 8lbs had a 12lb 11oz baby.<br>  <br>  Weight can be determined with a ultrasound, but its a iffy science.|`|ZvaFsGvjaa	Even with an ultrasound it's hard to determin baby's weight so I doubt you would be able to tell just by external examination.<br>  You won't know 100% until he or she is born.(captain obvious, I know lol)|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	No, I wouldn't be concerned. 20-25 lbs is the norm for pregnancy so it sounds like you're right on target. As far as the baby's weight, it's a toss up - some doctors can get a good prediction, but overall the weight could be off in either direction by as much as a pound. So I wouldn't use it as as surefire way to tell if you're having a 'big' baby. And some doctors consider 8 lbs to be big - when in fact it's normal. I believe anything over 9 1/2 lbs is considered "large." I wouldn't worry too much. Your baby takes what he needs from you, so he's probably doing just fine!|`|ROJans2Taa	some docs can estimate within a few ounces, however they are just expert guesses, i asked my doc, with my second pregnancy, I gained 42 lbs, and always measured on que, she said maybe around 7lbs, he was born 8lbs 7 ounces, and with my first, I only gained 19lbs and measured small, they told me she was gonna be tiny, however she was 7lbs 7 ounces and almost 21 inches long,lol. even with ultrasound they can be off, im not sure if it has to do with the technician or the machine. best luck
oXzHvsBpaa	I used Preggy Pops though out my whole pregnancy. They work gread. I bought the preggy pops at Babies R Us and I have also seen them in Motherhood Maternity. Good Luck!|`|208061cacdaa51404c312bf865d65713aa	I used simple grocery type of remedy...Ginger Ale and salt crackers did wonders for me!...nothing fancy but it really works. The trick is to eat them right on the bed before you wake up. I used to keep the by my night stand and eat a few crackers and sip some ginger ale before starting my day...it does work, try it :-) and Congrats!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	You can buy Preggie Pops at the maternity store Motherhood. I bought them and they work GREAT! You can also try regular popsicles. They help me a little. But go to motherhood. They have a bunch of stuff. |`|WEvqRY27aa	I was in the store Motherhood, and they have morning sickness lolly pops and snacks. So maybe try going to Motherhood.|`|NDQS5HJyaa	I've seen some of those things in Babies R Us actually. Specifically the pregnant morning sickness pops... not sure how much they actually work though.
ly59dQ3gaa	It's normal.  All of my symptoms virtually went away at 12 weeks on the dot.  You're in your honeymoon stage of pregnancy.  The second trimester rocks, but be prepared for the third.  You'll get tired again and may experience a little sickness again.  |`|rC6gL7KOaa	It's normal honey, your appetite can come and go at any point in pregnancy. Last week (10 weeks) I didn't have much of an appetite and I actually lost 4 pounds since I found out I was pregnant. This week, I'm eating anything that isn't locked down! One thing pregnant women get wrong is that they think that just because you're pregnant, you have to eat a whole lot. It's really all psychological. At this point your baby is the size of a plumb, it doesn't require you to eat a whole pizza! The hunger is our body's way of reacting to hormonal changes, it has nothing to do with the baby. So try not to worry, after you hear the heartbeat, you're pretty much assured that everything will be ok. |`|IWinNj2saa	I am 18 wks, 4 days, and not feeling hungry at all. I think I ate a total of 2 times yesterday, Ramen noodles, and Ceasar Salad for dinner. It happens. Just make sure you are taking your prenatal vitamins, as they will add the extra nutrition you might be lacking due to appetite loss. The baby survives off of your nutrition, and will survive, if you miss a meal every now and then. Don't make it a habbit though. |`|UGBL3wREaa	Since what your describing is something we can't know 100% what your feeling...I'll put it this way...when I went into labor at 12 weeks for my MC it felt like period cramping. I suggest drink more water and just keep an eye on things down below. Don't stress to much..hopefully your doctor is right!|`|gklH61Uiaa	It's hard for me to feel hunger sometimes. I can't tell if I'm bloated or if shes lying weird.<br>  As long as you're not losing weight, don't worry about it.<br>  Keep eating!|`|uqj4bPlaaa	It is fine to have such variations through your pregnancy.<br>  Don't worry. <br>  But continue with small frequent meals. Think of the nutritive value of whatever you eat. <br>  Even if you are nothungry, eat for the baby's health. <br>  <br>  Dr. Jyoti M. <br>  (MedicineAsk.com)|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I'm 24 weeks and that still happens to me. It is normal for symptoms to come and go. I wish my constant sickening hunger would go away. lol. It will go away for a day or two and then come back again. I'm sure your baby is okay. Congrats!|`|o1RLOd61aa	That is normal. Your hormones are just going through a change...and its probably effecting your appetite. If i don't recall i also didn't eat very much...i felt sick and didn't want food. But don't worry. Its normal.<br>  <br>  ~Jess~|`|DD5CMWfkaa	It's normal. There was a point where I wasn't hungry at all and actually ended up losing 5lbs, oops! But don't worry your apetite will come back! 
xMvb2o29aa	21 weeks |`|ioZeveazaa	I will be 19 weeks on the dot.|`|AA11466534	I was 4 months|`|REx9YVLXaa	I was 19 weeks when I found out I was having a girl.|`|AA10780655	with my first i was 20 weeks, with this one i was 18 weeks|`|YVWlAvqEaa	20 weeks, I was 5 months|`|0DUzshQUaa	I was 16 weeks|`|basZBA84aa	With My Pregnancy i was 20weeks and 1 day. the doctor said that one of the best times to find out the sex is 5months or 20 weeks. you could go earlier but their is a chance that they would say a girl and it would be a boy because the testies have not dropped yet.<br>  <br>  on the other hand my aunt had 2 sonograms they were positive that it was a girl and guess what they had a boy. they spent weeks returning gifts because everyone bought pink or purple|`|qAwcwVybaa	I was 19 weeks when I had my ultrasound to find out the sex (I'm having a boy!).  I think I was 20 weeks when I found out with my first child.  A friend of mine who is also pregnant found out when she was 16 weeks.  I think most doctors like to do it between 18-20 weeks.  Best of luck!|`|7edddef837f9013ff2f1f46a6893dcb7aa	19 week ultrasound showed us that she's a girl, and an amniocentesis at 22 weeks confirmed it.|`|rsEK17n1aa	well usually a doctor will due ultrasound between 17 to 20 weeks.  But to get an accuarate answer I will say 25 weeks.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I'm 15.4 weeks now and I find out on November 10th. I'll be 20 weeks then. I can't freaking wait!!!!|`|gG60OCZuaa	22 weeks and the doctor was 100% sure it was a girl.|`|mZjdxuweaa	I WAS 20 WEEKS!

DzHOggxsaa	They took 8 tubes from me. =(|`|aSMW3kaJaa	Not too much.  I've had 5 kids, and have ended up having 3 different OB's, and they vary.  I think the most they've taken for a first visit was 3 small vials, but that wasn't done at the appointment, they scheduled me a lab appointment where they did the draw.  I wouldn't worry about the blood draw.  It's fast and easy.  Congrats on your pregnancy!  I hope it's nice and easy for you.|`|0ae94159aebb0543d95ea52595c8db2caa	Too much. LOL. It's like 5 tubes (if not more, been a while so I can't remember). |`|SaEw6GFaaa	They took 6 from me...|`|x6IyESABaa	3 Vials !! I almost died !<br>  <br>  I'm 13 weeks now. Visit my baby's blog at:<br>  <a href="http://www.joanna-shawn.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.joanna-shawn.blogspot.com/</a>|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Mine wasn't at my prenatal visit. I had to schedule a whole other appointment at the lab for that. They took like three huge tubs from me.
yznZqcznaa	I was rally worried too but my ultrasound showed the baby had stopped developing at 5.5 weeks.  If I would have seen the heart beat I would have cried too. That was very nice of your Dr to show you that your baby was ok.  She is not in the Atlanta area by any chance is she?|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I saw mine at 7 weeks and 2 days and I didn't cry in the room but later when I got home I did. I didn't really get too emotional about anything until yesterday when I got to see our baby girl for the first time looking like a baby and not just a peanut. It was a wonderful experience. Especially finding out she's a girl and not an IT anymore. lol. I cried in the ultrasound room yesterday.|`|2ad181c21364a9bc452bc03d80d57598aa	I wasn't to emotional, I was overjoyed. but when I got to see my baby for the first time it was under scary circumstances. when I heard the heartbeat for the first time again, extremely overjoyed. and a few months ago when I found out it was a boy... I cried. Very Very Happy tears! for me that made me realize that this is real. I'm going to be a mommy... are the kicks that I feel. I know there is really something in there! a picture on a screen does wonders for me.. but when I can feel him inside moving around.. its more real to me and just crazy. I love it. Congratulations btw!! |`|41750b9e94be3f10bf789863a1a3a228aa	Yep!  Totally normal to worry and be grateful at your miracle.  Enjoy every moment of it and try to not give in to the fears (it easy though)|`|bIvsLrCUaa	I didn't really get emotional, I got very happy and excited though. :)<br>  Just wait until you find out what it is! :) I found out today that I'm gonna be a Mommy to a Beautiful Baby Girl! Although my fiance and I were hoping for a boy, we are extremely happy and wouldn't change it for the world! :)<br>  <br>  Congrats!
AVePRVWKaa	I think Noah is a great name and if you like it then go for it! Don't worry about what other people think, even if it is your mom.  My father in law hated the name we picked for our son, and when we told him his name when we were pregnant he didn't talk to us for about a month because we didn't include him in in the decision (which was not his in the first place to make!) Moral of the story is...he got over it and so will your mom :) <br>  <br>  Just a thought...Noah is getting to be a very popular name though, as long as you don't mind that :)|`|zi8tWO9Qaa	Noah Jacob is so wonderful! It is just the best! Noah Brown and Jake Brown both work, so he could go with either. Jake is also one of my most favorite names ever, but Noah is so soft and graced... It's a wonderful name!!|`|RgVmmtj5aa	Hey --<br>  <br>  I really like Noah Jacob a lot !  (I don't particularly like "Nolan" though ... but that's just me)<br>  <br>  Good luck with your new baby !!|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	I actually hate Nolan. I love Noah though- it's on our list too.

Either way he will have a beautiful name. Who cares what your mother says it's your son. Congrats!|`|AA10825039	its cute espically for a country boy...nothing wrong w it...|`|Elxuvon8aa	I like Noah Jacob it is very cute|`|YGlzeym5aa	Noah Jacob is a really nice name, go with that.|`|xIowgWL7aa	I like Noah Jacob.<br>  <br>  Nolan would have been my older daughter's middle name if she was a boy and she has told me on several occasions that she thought it was a horrible name, along with the first name I would have given her (Edward). I think its a wonderful name, despite what she says.|`|F7tyzrMzaa	Awww I love that. Noah is awesome, it sounds better than Nolan in my opinion. I'm not very keen on that. Don't listen to your mom, it's your baby, name him what you want to. |`|z6BtwSE8aa	I love Noah Jacob. Noah has always been one of my favorite names.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	I like Noah jacob.|`|nwi9Fv9Baa	Out of these two, I really like Nolan Jacob.  I'm warming up a bit to Nolan, I think.  (I used to feel differently... but that's another story, nevermind. :) )<br>  <br>  Other suggestions:<br>  Nathan/Nate Jacob<br>  Heath Jacob<br>  Jake Henry<br>  Eli Jacob<br>  Colton Jacob/Jake<br>  Bennett Jacob/Jake<br>  Harper Jacob<br>  Hendrick Jacob<br>  <br>  These are most interesting name in the bunch, I think.  I actually have some more, I just didn't want to make the answer too long :)|`|xMBEIw5oaa	I love Noah! <br>  <br>  Other suggestions: Gabriel, Isaac, Elijah, Luke, Rory, Patrick, Emile, Isaiah, Kurt, Nicholas<br>  :)|`|0ae82875d90599adb0cdb67f352191b8aa	As much as I hate names that people pick for their kids nowadays, I really like Noah.  That's a great name, and Noah Jacob Brown doesn't sound pretentious or anything.  <br>  I say go with it.|`|ZFMeU7RWaa	Love it! I'm not sure that Noah Jacob is unique though as both names are very popular at the moment.  I don't like Nolan Jacob though.|`|VJ2lMc0Laa	Noah Jacob is a lovely name and it has a special meaning behind it (Has Jacob is your brothers name),Its your child name him has you wish :-)<br>  Good luck!!!<br>  stacey xxxx|`|4JQ71C1caa	Noah Jacob is really cute. |`|5yYnZrJ2aa	Dont think either are very nice, but if I had to choose I would say Nolan.

ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	My doctor told me NO because it has alcohol in it. They say just to take sudafed. Call and ask your doctor what you can take for a cough.|`|5Eg8dpnMaa	It's not good to take any medication during pregnancy. Unless you have a fever, my doctor recommends that you just solider it out. 
Kwgdnsubaa	I had three girls and they all acted shy.  But my friend had two boys and they showed it all off, so much in fact that even if she hadn't wanted to know she would have.  I think girls are just modest. LOL  good luck.<br>  |`|kRqm2X2Baa	LOL my son had no problems showing off that he was a boy. But apparently he was shy about showing his face. When I went to have 20 week ultrasound he refused to show it and no matter how much the tech jiggled and and tried he wouldn't show it. He would turn over then by the time the tech had slid over to see his face would straight away turn back the other way. I had to go back two weeks later because of that. I was a high risk pregnancy and a condition showed up in the 20 week scan was the reason they had me come back so they could look at his face. |`|mZjdxuweaa	my friend is 33 weeks and her baby has yet to show them what they are packin!! lol she has had like 4 ultrasounds and still nothing! |`|Kdv4Lomcaa	My baby did the very same thing during our last scan...good thing we didn't want to find out the gender anyhow...now it is really going to be a surprise!|`|mBeGdFO2aa	Yup, my u/s tech couldn't see and I was crushed!  I went to a private clinic 2 days later and found out we were having a girl :)|`|aboQfYqeaa	Not my little boy.  The little show off showed the goods right away.  That is so cute though, to see the little legs crossed like that.  I saw my boy rub his nose during his ultrasound, it was funny....like he had an itch.<br>  <br>  Congrats on your pregnancy and good luck with your shy baby.  =)|`|AA10667190	I go for another on November 5th but that is exactly what mine did at my 16 week scan so we have no idea what we are having either at this point!!!!  It is funny and it is precious to see their little legs crossed we seen ours cross and uncross them several times.  Congrats and good luck!!!!  If we don't find out this next time, we are just going to leave it as a surprise :)|`|AA12135528	My first one kept his back turned the whole time...even when the doc tried to poke me to get him to move.<br>  <br>  He made up for it with the next ultrasound.....he was showing what he had off to the world, lol.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I hopefully find out on the 10th and I really hope our baby co-operates because I really really want to know. Sorry your baby didn't. Congrats!|`|T0gv52CDaa	Not my boys.  Both my now 2 year old, and the one I'm carrying now posed spread eagle to make sure we knew what we were getting.  My 2 year old still has no sense of modesty :o).
XOYDAJdFaa	You can buy ovulation tests over the counter, but anything else you would have to see your dr for. |`|0LCJuBA8aa	i dont think theres anything you can buy over the counter, id make an appt with your doc to see why youre not ovulating and ask him these questions. good luck! :)|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	No not really. You can go see a doctor and see if they can prescribe you something. Good luck!
dNkDUPsHaa	It is completely normal! I had it from 10 weeks until about 20 weeks, then it stopped. My doctor said that it is normal unless it starts getting bloody. If you are VERY freaked out about it and this doesn't comfort you, call you doc. They will be able to calm your nerves! :)|`|735KiHn2aa	Well, most of the time when a pregnant woman  has any sort of pink or brown discharge, there is nothing to worry about. But I would still definitely call your OB and let them know. Take it easy the rest of the day as well.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I would call your doctor immediately just incase. |`|Wkf0YTKtaa	You are probably fine, but call your doctor and explain it to her.|`|rz6pQJFDaa	I went through the same thing a few weeks ago, right after my husband and I had intercourse.  I was freaking out!  I called the doctor and spoke to a really kind nurse, who said that as long as it's very light, doesn't last longer than about an hour, and you're not having painful cramping, everything's okay.  I put my feet up for the rest of the day and felt fine after the reassurance.<br>  <br>  If you are feeling scared, I'd call your doctor and speak to someone.  Your practice nurse will want to stay informed about any bleeding you have so they can monitor your pregnancy better.<br>  <br>  I hope you're okay and that the baby's fine.|`|DdSnno9daa	its normal as long as it don't stink|`|GjuRYsITaa	doctors say that brown blood is old blood and you shouldn't worry if its red and a lot then worry
UrrRgmDwaa	I just turned 25 and my baby is 4 months old. Everyone is different, but I don't feel like I am too young to have a baby and I haven't gotten any mean comments or anything. The best age for a woman to have a baby is actually 25. It can get harder to get pregnant the older you get. My best friend is 23 and pregnant right now. She is so excited and everyone is really excited for her. If you don't feel that your ready, you will be when the baby gets here. It all just comes naturally.  Becoming a mother is such a special journey. You'll do fine and your husband and family will be there to back you up. Go for it, you won't regret it. My little girl makes me see life in a whole new way.  |`|3i8vQa2faa	Well wow! You think your to young?!? <br>  Im in my teens and STiLL in High School, and im pregnant!!<br>  Im 2 months almost 3.<br>  Yes i know im really stupid! I really regret it. My mom doesnt even know yet im going to tell her this Friday. :(<br>  Im scared..Im like wayyy to young. But you, i dont think your too young. Im not saying that your old or anything im just saying that you seem at the right age :D<br>  and I wish the best 4 u and ur baby and ur husband. |`|yPNvecc7aa	It's kind of a non-issue since you're already pregnant.<br>  <br>  But in their 20's and early 30's is the general age people have babies. So unless you're incredibly immature, no you're not too young.<br>  <br>  I'm 27 and so is my pregnant sister in law.<br>  <br>  Oh and congrats!|`|hJwheleJaa	I'm 34 weeks pregnant and I JUST turned 20 a few weeks ago. I got married on my 18th birthday and we just had our 2 year Anniversary. I definitely don't think 25 is too young. And 32 for sure isn't. We plan on being done having babies by the time we are that age. |`|aec0a315ba82df417988623b48e5f8b7aa	i am 25, and this is my first baby, you are not too young you know that.  my husband is 28.  i am 35 weeks pregnant|`|9y8Gd55haa	Well its a personal opinion, but I'm 19 and am due tomorrow.  I don't think your to young.|`|AA10478980	I think you are a great age to be having your first child. Congratulations!|`|APrvPTsNaa	No, you are not too young. I had both my sons by the time I was your age. You're not a child.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I'm almost 21 weeks pregnant and I'm 21 and my husband will be 25 next month. I don't think I'm too young so I definitely don't think you are too young. I think that age doesn't really matter unless you're under 18. I think that as long as you are mature and financially ready for a baby then it shouldn't be a problem. Unless of course you aren't married. I definitely think that people should be married but it doesn't really happen like that now a days. Congrats!|`|YJN1JnT8aa	I was 20  when I had my first daughter and my husband was 22, and now I am 25 just turned 25 in sept, and I'm 35 weeks preggo with daughter number 2. I think this is a good age to have kids, you still have the stamina and energy to play wiht them, My mom was 38 when she had me and we couldn't do the things that younger moms get to do with thier children. So congrats on the new baby. I think 25 is a great age to start a family.|`|AA12387863	If you think you are too young, then maybe you are. However, I was 19 when my first one was born and happily married to the man I am still married to. (Almost 25 years) My mother had her first at 16 with the man she is still married to. But I have known people that got married When they were 35 and had a baby when the were 40 and they still didn't know what they were doing. Everyone is an individual. When you are 9 weeks pregnant is not the time to start second guessing yourself. Good Luck!|`|mg3Tdo5Baa	I don't think your young at all. I am 22 and 29 weeks pregnant with my fiancee and I's first child, a little boy. I admit that I would have rather have waited a year or two but I would rather be this age and have a baby. As long as we're finacially stable and able to give our children the love and support they need, I am fine with being young. Congrats!|`|fArN0QEMaa	i am only 21 and am 33 weeks! Age does not matter as long as you love and take care of your child. Im shure there are some 30 year old women out there who are pregnant and on drugs and will be horrable moms..... while there are women younger the us who will be great moms. Age has nonthing to do with it|`|dAV2CnNmaa	Im younger than you are and I am 34 weeks tomorrow. Although mine wasn't planned I feel I am ready to look after my child and I will do all the best for him when he comes around. I don't think you are too young and if you are ready then you are perfectly fine.<br>  Good luck with everything, I hope it goes well for you|`|cCNJ0d5Saa	That's just slightly younger than the average (28) and if you feel you're ready, you're ready. I'm 20, I'll be 21 when this baby is here and I know I'm ready. My DH and I planned this kid and are prepared for it.<br>  <br>  You will get some looks, but who cares? Who wants to be 40 when having their first kid? I'd like some time at the end of my life to enjoy my husband again and be alive to see my grandkids grow up!|`|71b04ae04f4a311b132775b2d931bd76aa	I'm turning 24 and have two kids.  There are good things about waiting, and good things about being young.  honestly, I think you are a good age.<br>  <br>  pregnancy diet info, very important:<br>  <a href="http://www.blueribbonbaby.org/ifyouarepregnant/the-importance-of-good-diet/" rel="nofollow">http://www.blueribbonbaby.org/ifyouarepr...</a>|`|rpkDn73Vaa	Well honey, no one knows if YOU are ready. Diffrent people diff times, ya know?  I had my 1st and 2nd at 18, and 20.  Then my 3rd at 28, now I am 29 on my last baby.  It's up to you, and if you feel ready.  I think you will be just fine.  Anyway who is ever READY for a baby?? lol.  Good luck sweety!! I wish you and your new family all the luck!!|`|tht0DrHsaa	I don't think your to young but what does it matter your already pg. If you didn't want to have a baby you should have used protection.|`|oxUYiLKPaa	One of my best friends is 26 and pregnant she would have given anything to be pregnant at 25! You are at a great age to have a baby..|`|aYNMs5vUaa	dear you are lucky my mom when she was 29 years old she had 8 kids so no you have the perfect age congratulation, be happy and enjoy it. |`|lGKz4Yofaa	No way your perfect age! Congrats!! You'll love being a mom! I am 23 and expecting! I cant wait were having a boy in Janaury! My husband is 24|`|BCkKdJlfaa	I think you are at a great age I dont think that you are too young I had my little guy when I was 19 but that was just right for me. I think it all depends on if you are ready or not. Good Luck!|`|bel5T1Ulaa	I'm 7 weeks with #1 and I will be 24 in January. Believe it or not I am one of the last of my buddies to have a baby!|`|fjeFBGlqaa	i am 23 and on my second.|`|Pa6VIIWpaa	Well it really depends on the person who is pregnant.  Some women might think that is too young.  Others might think it is not.  I had my first at 24 and my sis had her first at 23.|`|VryIJJWsaa	25 is a great age....lots of people younger than you have babies and do just fine|`|tManvxfQaa	nope as long as you are married and want to be a mother its perfect|`|miPubuDYaa	I don't think you are to young. i think that is prefect age actually. As long as your in a healthy relationship. I think that is great.<br>  <br>  |`|XSn0Ny3haa	im your age, and i see alot of people my age have kids .... some on accident,and are single moms working at walmart... some got ther bachelors degree,and got married,bought a house and are having a baby. some are still getting wasted and dancing on tables. i think the age doesnt matter as long as you are content with the idea. you have time to think it over. i like the idea of being preggo now,but the reality is i want the american dream and waiting till i can get all those things first. if there was a choice involved i would say, around 28 is a better age.|`|horefBCyaa	my mom had me when she was 24. and most of family started their family around that age-being married and all. i think that's a good age. haha i think i'm gonna be the rebel of the family. =)|`|1da22694eee1f6055b5ea295d06bcf40aa	I had my first when I was 21. I lost one when I was 23 and now I am 24 and would love another one. Your at the perfect age I think.|`|JQASQ2mRaa	hi <br>  it is right age..dont worry
MhyuXBoEaa	I work in the medical field and the facility should not be billing you for what medicaid didn't cover that is normally a contracted fee amount. I would call the hospital.. and as far as visits for pregnancy goes that does not count for ER visits. I would call the hospital and ask them if the billing is correct they may have made an error when entering the payment then if they say it is correct then call your medicaid provider. |`|ygVTtSNVaa	Wow. Don't call the hospital you need to call Medicaid.. If you call the hospital they will just tell you that Medicaid was on there and covered so much, but you need ot talk to medicaid and ask why they only covered so much. I haven't paid a penny out of hand with my Medicaid, but I also have a primary insurance of Blue Cross through my husband. Definitley call them and see why though. Best of luck|`|sGJhKesdaa	good question, i would call your social worker and find out, b/c if it is pregnancy realted it should be all covered for the baby's sake, that is what they explained to me anyways, when i got on pregnancy medicaid.  they may not have known it was for baby|`|GUUgeptjaa	Most likely the hospital put in the wrong code and medicade will not cover whatever code they put in.  Call the hospital and tell them to resubmit with the correct medicade codes for whatever services you got.  |`|SbB9vsxBaa	I was on medicaid when I was prego and it didnt matter if I was going to the ER or if it was just a checkup medicaid covered EVERYTHING. That is the point of it i thought. I would call and ask |`|Xhgq35dNaa	Yeah...that doesn't sound right to me...call your social worker and get a straight answer.|`|kcGFK36Waa	What? that's odd!! Before I got insurance I had Medical (like Medicaid) till I was 8 weeks. And they covered everything and I went to ER twice the first time I didn't even have Medical and they still covered it. You should really call the hospital there is something very wrong with that because it should cover everything. And mine was pregnancy only Medical also. |`|6d6GHChPaa	I have never gotten a bill while on medicaid. And for my first pregnancy I spent 7 days in the hospital around 4 months along b/c of a kidney infection. Sounds to me like an error on the hospitals part. Wait until they call you back and maybe you can get it straightened out. If not, call your case worker.|`|aec0a315ba82df417988623b48e5f8b7aa	are you on medicaid or pregnancy medicaid?  they may be different, if they ( medicaid ) didn't know you are pregnant they might have done the paper work wrong.  you should call and find out before you make a payment on anything|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	WOW! I am on medicaid as well and I can't believe they didn't cover all of it. I would call your medicaid office and ask them why. THey would know better then the hospital. |`|AA10529334	Don't call the hospital call medicaid. <br>  <br>  www.righthealth.com has the phone numbers for all the states.|`|XHeiEgF1aa	They should have covered all of it. You need to call Medicaid asap!

ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I am so sorry. I'm not a mother of a child with Downs syndrome but my mother has a brother with Downs syndrome and he is a year younger than me. I don't think every Downs child has that problem because he's always been very talkative since as far back as I can remember. I would maybe speak to a professional and see if they can help you out. God Bless You!|`|xnT5bzmuaa	Get her into speech therapy it will help her alot. Also occupational and physical therapy would help her alot too. I use to work for a pediatric therapy center and you would be amazed at how much these three therapies help children with down syndrome. The sooner you get her into these therapies you will be so amazed at how much it will help her. Wish you the best of luck and hope this helps.|`|9c8893607c79c3c2b3e1d6817da78217aa	Everyone is different. I work with 48 individuals with down syndrome in their 50's and only a few of them can talk.|`|bmqsO2nfaa	You need to see a specialist to answer your questions.  There are different levels of Down Syndrome.|`|DfSOyRaeaa	i have a step son who is downs, just turn 4 he in school and stuff she can't talk either  cause he has in large tongue  and stuff and he can only eat smashed up food and stuff knows everything and stuff started walking just after he turn 2 and just learn to ride a bike a month ago but to answer your question it up to him my can't talk cause of his  tongue it too big but he trys to say words you just have to listen very carefully |`|KjY2pANcaa	Why dont you get her some help from an ocupational and speach therepist<br>  Down,s people are teachable but dont push them into stress or they wont learn|`|ZncV5gc0aa	Enroll her into public school special ed. You know she probably won't be really ready until next year, but you get free speech therapy and day to day interaction with a teacher who knows all about overcoming mental challenges. Once you get her in school you will see a big difference! Even if she isn't speaking yet, get the flash cards out and put your hand in front of your mouth. Show her when you go "pa" you put air on your hand, etc. She might not copy, but she will be taking some of it in. Good luck!
Iqifd3SGaa	Who ever came up with the phrase morning sickness was an idiot...lol. I call it all day sickness because it can strike at any time. For some it is worse in the morning because of an empty stomach though. And prenatal vitamins used to bring on the sickness for me too, they are pretty nasty. Everything you described is normal. |`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	with my last and this one i am sick at night and tired by 5 or 6 i change from busy to blahhh|`|FtBqmFDEaa	When I was pregnant I was physically sick and felt nauseaus every day until 20+ weeks with both of my babies and the time I miscarried at 16 weeks. Just the way it goes. I had a boy and a girl so it makes no difference what sex the baby is, old wives tale. <br>  <br>  It should pass soon. Try to rest and eat little and often, ginger biscuits are said to help. |`|VhH9RJrSaa	not everyone gets morning sickness but almost everyone get sick adjusting to the prenatal. I was told to eat a good meal for dinner and then take my prenatal right before i go to sleep. this way you dont get nauseated. im 33 weeks and i take my prenatal every night before bed and i havent had a problem with them since. Your eating patterns will change constantly, i havent noticed any consistency in mine. dont worry. take your prenatals at night i promise you'llbe better off.|`|C0GeEv7kaa	Yes that it very normal. When taking your prenatal, make sure you take it with food. I'm in my third trimester and there's times when I feel like I can't stuff my face enough, but then again there's times I'm just not hungry. For the past week I haven't been hungry until lunchtime. |`|z8GbX4LXaa	Its normal to be nauseous at anytime when you preggers|`|QYYWBrG7aa	yes i had my morning sickness at night.worst thing EVER|`|tj0X2YaYaa	All of it is normal.  As for the evening as opposed to morning, it can be either/or.  You could just react badly to the prenatal vitamins, or you could just get sick in the evening no matter what.  My morning sickness came in the evening, but was worse after prenatal vitamins.|`|vek2OwQfaa	yes... I dont' know why they call it morning sickness. I personally had the all day sickness. Even during the night I would wake up and want to puke. It was horrible. U can try different prenatals just to see if there is something more gentle on your stomach. It may help a little. Hang in there it will pass. Good luck!|`|X83LVP6Iaa	Morning sickness does not mean you only have the sickness in the morning. For some women it can occur all day, just in the morning or just in the evenings. Morning sickness is just the name of the nausea you are feeling. |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	You can get morning sickness at any time of the day or even all day. They just call it that for some reason.|`|3rG4BFN8aa	you can get it any time of the day|`|aXESNuBKaa	yes you can get 'morning' sickness at any time of the day.|`|78FXygtoaa	i had it allll day for the first 3 months. lol good luck|`|PfNTPviyaa	Girl, I was sick morning, noon and night!  The name "morning sickness" is a total misnomer, and it is very common in early pregnancy to feel sick at any time throughout the day! <br>  <br>  Though, it is possible your vitamins are contributing to the problem :)  try taking them right before you go to sleep with a large glass of water and a few crackers ... this seemed to do the trick for me! <br>  <br>  Your hormones are raging, and its okay if everything seems to be out of whack for a while -- including your appetite!  <br>  <br>  Listen to your body, eat when your hungry and don't worry when your not :) |`|ynHbXymuaa	The trick to eat small meals throughout the day and snack too, LOTS of water even gatorade is good idea. As for the nausea hopefully it will go away, you just need to find out what helps you. me, I had to get up first thing in the morning and drink a V8. Good Luck and Enjoy the little one when your bundle of joy arrives.|`|7wZoPVChaa	i have morning, afternoon, evening, and night sickness.... sometimes the vitamins can make you nauseas, so that may be the case. everything sounds normal to me. pregnancy is great, but it can be a *****, too.|`|cDGAtS8raa	Yes, my doctor told me to take my prenatals before I go to bed so I will be able to sleep through the nausea because vitamins can do that to you.|`|JggabOlOaa	Yes you most certainly can.
PwmBdiEfaa	It is different for everyone. I am small and petite too and yes, I started noticing my belly around 7 weeks. My mom always told me when you get pregnant you aren't self-conscious anymore and you just tend to "let it hang out". <br>  <br>  I really think that I was just showing already by then, cuz I was always super-skinny. I am going to suggest Palmers Cocoa Butter lotion to start using on your tummy NOW to help with stretch marks. I swear by it! Gained 42 lbs with my pregnancy and have NO stretch marks.<br>  |`|IbOL868caa	Of course more petite, thinner women will show sooner than a thicker women would. Normally its about 3 to 4 months when a baby bump appears, but like I said it depends ont he women's size also, and how much fluid she is retaining and if she is bloated or not, around your normal period time you still get period bloating.|`|Rp0oD8bBaa	If you are small and petite you will start to show earlier than someone who is heavier.  I consider myself a bit heavier and was about 5 months pregnant before others could tell I was pregnant.  I started to see my body change sooner, but with clothes on, others couldn't tell until I was 5 - 5 1/2 months.<br>  <br>  |`|fSjYICnvaa	everyone shows at different times. but at 7 weeks its very rare for you to show even on second or third time around. the baby is the size of a pea at that time.but maybe you are further along then you think and that could be why your are showing. it could also be water retention as you store a lot while pregnant. |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I started gaining weight immediately after I found out. I probably looked bigger around 7 weeks or so but I wasn't showing. I just had a little bit of fat. I'm 19.2 weeks pregnant now and I'm still not that big and I weighed 100 lbs. prepregnancy.|`|5BgLAxfyaa	i didn't show on my first baby til i was like 7 months, and then noone still couldn't really tell. same as with a friend of mine...but that second baby!! wow! i was gigantic. it depends on your body.|`|205b07c52427397dd81b53d355175453aa	No i had a lil bump to i really was small to you are fine it will start really soon to get bigger and bigger if you are small |`|XkNqNVZyaa	Everyone is different. Im also petite, and when i was exactly 4 and a half months pregnant i got my bump. Congrats!! |`|TIPibQR9aa	The smaller/skinnier you are the sooner you will see a belly. I was about three months when I started to see a baby bump so you could very well have one!|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	i am small like you my 1str i was 19 weeks or so this one 11 week |`|sBHhnDwaaa	Everyone shows differently. I barely showed at like 18 weeks, and my picture was at 22 weeks, so it just depends.|`|nJHZQ5ylaa	all people are different, you show later with your first, ppl normally show at 4months or so, if your are normally skinny then you would show a little as you will be bloated, if you naturally have a flat tummy then that is why you will be showing. |`|5RoYyprkaa	It could be gas or bloating. Lots of my friends go through that, it goes away though and you'll get your baby belly. My best friend got hers at 5 months. She's due on the 11th!!! Ah, sorry, I'm excited for her, since I've had no luck getting pregnant yet!|`|KYvlD9o9aa	Well let me tell u... I am 6 weeks and I am showing I think. I have gained some weight also and I am also a petitie girl. Its ok... most like you are 7 weeks like you think |`|Jjyl4YBsaa	my tummy popped big time at 4 months exactly
WWfL5tMvaa	I breastfed my son for 19 months. i didn't have a period till he was 14 months. i was also on birth control. i stopped them hoping that i will get pregnant but nothing happened. then the doctor told me it might be the nursing is not letting you to get pregnant so i stopped nursing him and nothing happened yet. i see lots of women pregnant and nursing in the same time. i wished to be like that but it didn't work with me! so i think it differs from one to another so take it easy<br>  but the period thing is fine my friend didn't have any till her son was 16 months. when i started lowering the number of nurses for my son i  started  getting my period. so don't worry and try to relax and enjoy nursing.|`|WdvLcYaVaa	Well, it just depends on your body. My son is almost 14 months and I am still breastfeeding him. I got my period back at 6 wks pp even though I was exclusively breast feeding. I am using OPK's and I am ovulating too. It can vary from woman to woman as to when you start back. If you have not gotten your period by the 12 month mark you should go see your OB/GYN to discuss your options. Good luck to you!|`|1u4CS5J3aa	I don't know how she did it but I know a woman who not only conceived once while breastfeeding AND being on birth control but it happened twice. She has a 5 year old a 3 year old a 1.5 year old and a 5 month old. So its possible maybe you should ask your OB about the period thing 9 months seems to be a pretty long time to go with out as most mommies I have talked to had a period while breastfeeding after recovery from birth.
AA12033653	Get yourself a test, no matter the results consult a doctor.  If your test is positive then you need to start the prenatal appointments, and if it is negative, then there may be something wrong.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|dFOcEmWMaa	oh hunny you better take another one, cuz im 26 weeks along, and your story sounds the same as mine|`|vek2OwQfaa	You should probably call your doctor at this point and either get a blood test done, or go take another test in about 1 week. If you still get a negative then it could be something else.|`|LMkj8D8eaa	i'd go the doctor and get a urine pregnancy test....it'd be more accuarate, and if u aren't pregnant, then i would go the doc to see what's wrong with yah.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  good luck|`|HqVoLzjcaa	You should take another test when you're 2 weeks late. And after that if it still says negative and your menstrual still haven't come go to the Dr. |`|UXRwYHrMaa	You have ALL the classic signs. Test now. Hopefully this means congrats!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I would go see your doctor and see if they'll give you a blood test because it is possible to get a false negative. |`|MKg9tsWraa	if u think there is a possibility that u are pregnant and ur overdue for ur period then i would say yes definately do another test, as it should show by now whether you are or not. x|`|TRAPvJ4oaa	You should test again now that you are late.
4S7lR5Qwaa	its your own heart beat sweetheart.<br>  when you do listen in to baby it will sound alot quicker, like a train - its a wonderful sound.<br>  you can buy equipment from mothercare, argos, etc that listens in to baby but they dont work well at 13 weeks - but do work at 20 weeks plus<br>  you can probably hear your own because its beating twice as fast now because of the blood supply needed for baby and you.<br>  CONGRATULATIONS on baby and just wait for the moving about - if its your first look out for butterflies or little balls of wind that instantly come and go - thats the baby moving you should feel that around 18 wks.<br>  |`|kwQi2OM9aa	That's your pulse hun, your blood flow is increased when you're pregnant, so even if you never noticed it before it probably a little bit harder and more noticable now...  Lol and I don't think you're ignorant, I used to wonder about that before I got pregnant, used to scare me into thinking I might be lol.  Good luck and congrats!|`|T56QzXiNaa	It's your pulse.  Your baby is still too small for you to feel anything.  You'll feel kicking around week 20, but you won't be able to "feel" the baby's heartbeat ever.  You can only "hear" the baby's heartbeat at the doctors office.  <br>  <br>  I'm not judging.  You should go online and look up what to expect at 13 weeks.  You'll learn how big the baby is and how it's developing.<br>  <br>  Go here:  <a href="http://www.babycenter.com/6_your-pregnancy-13-weeks_1102.bc" rel="nofollow">http://www.babycenter.com/6_your-pregnan...</a><br>  |`|SsNC8OIuaa	It's your own pulse.  It may be magnified if you have an anterior placenta because the placenta pulses with your heart and can be quite loud on a monitor.  You can't ever feel the babies pulse though.  |`|r4N3R0dtaa	It's your own pulse. |`|jQDeTTVhaa	no you cant its your heart beat that you feel|`|PXplwKsVaa	I am guessing that you are feeling the abdominal aortic artery..yours no the baby's. |`|IbOL868caa	No, you cant...I am almost 33 weeks along and I cant feel the babies heartbeat through my belly. If you feel anything, its your own..if you check closely you can feel your own heartbeat in a lot of places on your body.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It's yours. I have the same thing.|`|1K0n0Sk8aa	that will be your pulse you cant fell the babys heart beat at all |`|O5WberWnaa	no its your own hun,<br>  ive just got one of the dopplers today and heard my babys hb for the first time today
UDCW4NAKaa	I may not be a pregnant woman, but my other half is now 6 months pregnant and she had rotten sickness up until about a month ago, when we had a little get away and spent a week by the sea, so if you are not already by the sea, go for a weekend if you can because it seemed to some good in my other halfs case, she found paella is good, if you are still eating nuts cashew paella is great and seems to stay down(until she decided to be safe and not eat nuts!), if not, lots of celery to bulk it up a bit and make it a bit nicer by putting a bit of stock in witht the paella rice to start with to give that a bit more flaver- but to be honest you can most things in paella, whatever you fancy but lots of celery, peppers, basically any veg you like(keep it simple, dont fart about with strong spices etc as they will just start you off again!), just google for a good receipe! My other half has also found that walking helps a tonne- she works a few minutes walk away from where we live and since once night she had an urge for us to walk back as opposed to drive we have always done it because baby seems to move for a few minutes once we get back and then settles and seems to calm the sickness somewhat, also if you go for a walk just before bed, little one stops moving a few minutes after you get back and you can sleep a bit more easy!<br>  <br>  And congratulations by the way! Goodluck! <br>  |`|A0wK46aKaa	it might sound strange but i found eating ice cubes use to settle my stomach, Mashed potatoes cereal bread i lived on sausage rolls|`|qicxk5GMaa	when I was sick a few things that helped were goldfish crachers, animal crackers and pretzels.  Hope this helps.|`|nBy68dLBaa	Saltine Crackers and Sprite work for me. |`|OJFz0LBZaa	through out the day i sucked on soft mints that helped my sickness and i could eat a meal and after i had eaten  then sucked on more mints it worked for me and a few friends, cant help but try it, good luck but it should pass soon and you will be feeling better  |`|qygYwdRpaa	Keep some crackers or cereal by your bed and eat something 15-30 minutes before getting up <br>  Don't go hungry - eat frequent small meals and snacks throughout the day <br>  Don't overeat - keep your meals small <br>  Drink fluids between meals rather than with your food (about an hour after eating) <br>  Eat what appeals to you: your main goals right now are fluids and calories <br>  <br>  What to avoid <br>  Avoid fatty (especially fried) foods and spicy foods <br>  Avoid cooking food with strong smells, and make sure your kitchen is well-ventilated so odors don't linger <br>  Avoid strongly flavored or strong smelling foods (garlic, onions, broccoli, cabbage) <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|0zWJlNi1aa	Try ginger biscuits or else what worked for me was Black jacks - not sure if youre in the UK?  (I dont know if they sell them in other places!!) or try Liqourice - Im not sure why this helps but lots of pregnant ladies have said this helps<br>  |`|3CG3rby0aa	Just be patient and it will pass. do what you can to deal with it.  the foods you are eating are the same ones i am right now.  good luck!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Honestly everyone is different.

433165e2c7b432dcd07898d64f6f19c8aa	I had mine on Wednesday, and was horrified to discover my previous two scans had failed to pick up on the fact there was actually another bubba in there and i was actually expecting non identical twins, and wasn't just too huge for my dates. Now that my hubby and i are having to get used to fact there's another muffin hidden in there behind muffin one, and have now had to double up on everything accordingly, I'm learning to study their movements and get the appropriate naps inbetween.. I've suffered 3 miscarriages, so it's still scary as well as a little overwhelming. Muffin one is stretching, kicking, stroking and poking me during the day in sporadic periods, then quietens down at night about 10ish. Muffin 2 starts up with a vengeance at about midnight, and quietens down about an hour later and sticks to poking and prodding me for the remaining 4 hours instead.. I think i have about a 4 hour window at night where neither of them move and i can get uninterrupted sleep. During the day i grab cat naps (when i'm not working) at the times muffin one is taking a break.. When i'm awake wondering which bodily organ is poking out at me, is quite entertaining.|`|260f178c6fc34e7d0c73b917e2a51e55aa	Im due for my 20 week scan on the 25th of Nov and were finding out what were having, i live in kent and were having our scan done in Dareth valley hospital, i cant wait, im due 06.04.09. what are you hoping for?

SfymamWtaa	sounds like you might have a UTI|`|9d99924ae7cd2add40a289bc1930a1b4aa	yes it is pregnancy signs, but its better u goto doctor or take a test to be 100% sure,, good luck|`|arJqnL4saa	frequent urination is a sign of pregnancy. however, what your describing could also be a uti (urinary tract infection). those sometimes cause you to feel like you have to pee when you don't. If it continues, I would see the doctor.|`|lQORNmNiaa	It's possible.  Have you missed a period?  Frequent urination is a symptom of a lot of things, including a UTI or bladder infection, and even diabetes.  You should be checked by a doctor in order to know for sure.  |`|AA11916244	It could be but it sounds like you have a uti to me. Trust me i get one every few months. Call ur dr or u can buy uti testing strips at the drugstore.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	You may have a urinary tract infection. I would go see your doctor asap|`|djhGQ5xuaa	Could be a urinary tract infection, but yes that could be a sign of pregnancy too. Before I found out I was pregnant I had started having to go pee in the middle of the night which I never did before. |`|ZvqaU5Boaa	ya they deff could be. you should take a test. hope i helped : )<br>  <br>  ~?Jojo?~
V0r6VUwzaa	Its illegal for them to turn you away. The house doctor will deliver your baby. |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I don't think they could turn you away. I understand that you want your baby born there but either way you need to go see a doctor so that you can make sure everything is okay with your baby|`|F0m7ey0Caa	I can't believe that no one will take you. Are there any clinics in your area that would take you? Many of them have a nurse practitioner as the main care giver. You are then transferred out to a doctor in the third trimester, I believe. It is probably due to the medical card. No offense, been close to that. Made just a little too much to get one (like $50 more than their limit) but not enough to pay for everything on my/our own.<br>  You go to the doctor that is 1 1/2 hours away. You need to be seen asap! Your are coming up quick on your 20 wks and there are certain tests that need to be done. Plus you'll need an ultrasound then as well. Once you see that doctor, you can discuss the issue of being transferred to a closer doctor and if they cannot find one for you, you just tell him/her that you want to deliver in that hospital. <br>  No, the hospital cannot turn you away if you are in labor and go in to ER. The worst that can happen if you do, is that you don't get the original doctor that you are going to and you get who ever is on call that day.<br>  Get a doctor appointment scheduled! Take care of yourself and congrats on your baby!<br>  <br>  **How old are you my dear? Ask your mom or someone to go with you and help you out. If there is no one, be strong and get the ball rolling. I know it is scary. I didn't go to the doctor with my first child until about 4 months. Thank goodness she was healthy and everything turned out alright. Does the father know he is going to be a father? If so, have him go with you. Support teams are very helpful so see who you can get to go with you. Take care!|`|cG80UU5Waa	I don't know. If you were very close to giving birth they can't turn you away, but if you are still in the earlier phases they might put you in an ambulance and send you off to another hospital. I didn't think they did stuff like that but if all their beds are full at that hospital or if you have the "wrong" insurance...well, I have heard some horror stories.<br>  <br>  So, be careful. Just going to CDH when your doctor is 1 1/2 hours away and works out of another hospital is really a bad idea. <br>  <br>  You have time, try to find someone who works out of CDH. At the end of pregnancy you see your doctor once a week, so you don't want to be an hour and a half drive from them. Also, you don't want to deliver at a hospital that doesn't have you preregistered or have your medical records on file.<br>  <br>  Call for Information<br>  <br>  For more information or a physician referral to an obstetrician/gynecologist at Central DuPage Hospital, please call (630) 933-4CDH (4234).<br>  <br>  I found this number on their website, gl.
rDlCTXVLaa	First off, I am very sorry for your loss... I had a M/C in March at 6 weeks, I waited one full cycle before trying again, I wanted a regular period first, so I'd know exactly when it happened. I got pregnant again in June. It will happen, Good luck and God Bless...<br>  <br>  Edit: it took about 6 weeks for my hormones to reach zero, but everyone is so different. Have your HCG checked, it may still be elevated since you were already 15 weeks, but it goes down fast.|`|VMASMHX6aa	I'm really sorry for your loss. What an awful thing to go through.<br>  <br>  You definitely cannot rely on those ovulation tests. This is because you will still have the pregnancy hormone in your body, and ovulation tests will show positive in the presence of the pregnancy hormone.<br>  It will probably take around 2 months before your pregnancy hormones have completely died down. I had a blighted ovum and found out at 9 weeks (so I was much less pregnant than you both in terms of weeks and in the developement of the baby) and I got positive pregnancy and ovulation tests for over 5 weeks after I had a D&C.<br>  <br>  Me and my hubby started tryinf straight away but it took me 10 weeks to ovulate again after my D&C. I know this because I track my temps. I fell pregnant again and am not about 6 weeks.<br>  <br>  I think that the decision when to try again is a very personal one. However, I think considering how far along you were, it's pretty unlikely that you will conceive very quickly because it takes a while for the hormones to die down.|`|aGxbD6snaa	sorry to hear about your loss, its possible that you may be pregnant although as you were quite far on the hormone levels may still be present. the best thing you can do is see your doctor and get a blood pregnancy test so they can measure the hcg level. good luck.|`|TPJbEhNBaa	You should wait at least 6 weeks to allow time for your body to heal and get back to normal and for you to get a normal period.  If you just stopped bleeding a week ago from the miscarriage, it is way too early to be getting pregnant.  The chance of miscarrying again are significantly higher if you don't let your body get back to normal.  I would wait at least until your next period before trying again.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I'm not sure how long it takes for your levels to go down but if you want to start then have sex. I am pretty sure though that even if your HCG levels were up from the previous pregnancy then I don't really think that would affect the ovulation test. Go ahead and try for it. good luck and god bless you and your husband|`|bel5T1Ulaa	in my opinion you should really give it some more time. your body needs to heal for one and most people need some time for emotional healing after a miscarriage that far along
lOFbABTtaa	I would definitely go for a second opinion. We tend to trust our dr's too easily and always think they know best, The rule of thumb is to seek advice if you have been TTC for a year without any success, so if you told the dr that you have been trying for a year then he should not have given you pills and told you to come back in 2 months time. He should have ordered some tests. Very painful periods could be a sign that something is wrong and your dr should know this! Get a second opinion and good luck!|`|KzmTLOQHaa	Hey Girl!! unfortunately now and days you have to tell doctors what to do. I had to mention it to my doctor that I wanted blood work done just to make everything was ok. It wasn't going to hurt anything. And you would be surprised at the doctors that are just in it for the money. They know that if you keep having problems then you keep coming in and paying for the co pay. I told you about the experience I had with the first doctor I went to didn't I? She said the same thing and didn't seemed concerned in the least. So I went to another doctor that same week and found out my progesterone was all screwed up. So if you feel that something is wrong and would like to get answers then the doctor that you go to should support that. What in the heck would it hae hurt to do some test?? If anything it would have put your mind at ease knowing the answers you wanted. So yeah in answer to you question  YES  you should go to another doctor! Sorry about the rambling I just got alittle worked up  lol|`|VMASMHX6aa	Your doctor sounds pretty rubbish and if he's the only one at your surgery it's going to be difficult to get a second opinion.<br>  <br>  I really think you need to take matters into your hands a bit more. There is so much you could discover about what is going on by charting.<br>  Charting will give you a good idea what the problem could be - whether you are ovulating or not, whether your luteul phase is an ok length, whether you are timing intercourse correctly or even whether you are actually getting pregnant each month but then having very early miscarriages. This is actually a lot more than blood tests from your doctor which are often mistimed and reveal very little.<br>  <br>  Don't let this set you back. Just see it as the start of your own investigations.|`|c73QkZ2haa	If its something that worries you i would say seek a second opinion but usually a doctor doesnt worry about infertility issues until you have been trying for a year or more. But its your body so if you feel like you need to do further investigation than id say seek out more advice.|`|s8P8C92zaa	Dr.'s dont always know whats best.My sister has a lot of fertility prob.s the dr.'s never get too concerned, she does all this research online, then asks the dr. if the can try this or test that...|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I would go see another doctor if I were you. I had excruciating period cramps every month for over 2 years and I would go to my doctor and to the ER and they would never do anything. I got a new doctor because my husband and I had been ttc for 2 1/2 years with no luck and the minute I told him about the cramps he was concerned that I had endometriosis so I had a  laparoscopy to see. Thankfully I didn't but 3 weeks later he prescribed me Clomid and I was pregnant soon after. So we'll see how it goes after I have the baby. Hopefully my periods aren't as bad cuz that sucked. Good luck. I know how painful it can be. I totally recommend finding a new doctor that will do more than just give you something for the pain. You need to find the cause and see if that is what's stopping you from conceiving. |`|6m3GF5Pdaa	Wow Im glad I saw your question! I was going through the same thing when I was your age. I keep going to the DR & they would say the same thing to me & would put me on pain meds... I went to several other Dr for years & still no one would listen to me! Just more pain meds. I was trying to get pregnant & a few more yrs passed & nothing! Well my husband I split up & I remarried a few years later & recently try to conceive again... I am now 33 & thought I should demand someone go in & look at me I was 100% sure I had endometriosis, So my Dr did a laposcopic surgery on me & I had no Endometriosis but I had a ton & I mean a ton of scar tissue. He removed it all & a couple of weeks later I went in for a hsg he found that both my tubes were blocked with scar tissue but luckily he got one un blocked. Now I have one working tube & still haven't got pregnant!<br>  You are still young & you should demand your Dr to go in & look before its to late.<br>  If I could go back in time I would have demanded he go in & if not I would have got another Dr!<br>  Sorry this was so long... But good luck to you!|`|geNT36PWaa	you could make an appointment to see another doctor at the surgery some doctors are not so sympathetic when it comes to fertility... if after 6 months they are still not going to look into it for you I would change your GP all together... <br>  <br>  dont forget tho s/he will be aware than endo is more rare than people think and lots of common symptoms can be related to it and will make you stress and relate them to something completely different as these fertility issues have such big press!<br>  <br>  however, have you tried ovulation tests? and you can also get tests to check male sperm count from boots!! about a tenner but defo worth the money! plus if the ovulation tests show you are not ovulating or that your partner has mobility issues then you have something to go back to him with!<br>  <br>  EDIT: try doing the home tests then go back to him with the results! if he won't take any action then change your GP hun x
l3lhcRDcaa	I was also slightly confused as if I massage my breasts I get clear liquid and milky yellow liquid come out in different areas.<br>  <br>  I asked my doctor about it and he said that the glands are preparing for milk production so the clear liquid is probably colostrum in it's early form and the milky stuff is proper colostrum.<br>  <br>  Either way it is normal.|`|Bg6txvxqaa	I'm 5 months and I've had a little bit of this too, it's normal, don't worry!|`|Ws1hky6Zaa	yes it is, this is normal
ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It sounds like you may have experienced implantation bleeding. I would wait another week and test again. If it still says negative then make an appointment with your doctor. Good luck!
WmNcnUmlaa	I would call your doctor so they have a record of it but it sounds normal.  I have had these pains starting from when I was about 14 weeks.  Nothing to worry about.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I have pains on my front left side all the time. I asked my doctor and she said it's just ligaments and stuff and not to worry. I would call your doctor though just to be on the safe side.|`|zuZKj3xXaa	I had  that around 14 weeks.. its just you growing.. everything hurts when your pregnant at times lol<br>  you'll soon figure that out:)|`|Xct8kXLsaa	it may have been the baby up on a nerve. i was having wierd pains at about 16 weeks and thats what the doc told me it was.|`|IXssGo92aa	yahh i had it i dont know what it is, beacause i dont remember what the doctor said it was called, but it' has something to do with dehidration... |`|5OQLmECTaa	it could have been round ligament pain, where your ligaments were/are getting stretched out and it basically hits a nerve for a while... it is painful!  but like you have, it goes away and comes back at different times.
OWReYgV5aa	I am very sorry ...I went through this 2 years ago.  The reasons for miscarriage early are usually nothing you can prevent as it's nature's way of terminating a pregnancy that would never had produced a healthy baby.  It has nothing to do with a tilted uterus..I have one, also...I'm not sure about bacterial vaginosis..but I doubt that would cause it, either.  The only thing you could possibly do to cause one is maybe drugs or tons of caffeine but even then..it's not likely.   It's normaly a chromosomal issue and it happens to TONS of women.  Since you already have a child, then you know you are capable and it will most likely not happen again...the chances or having a healthy pregnancy the next time are still very high.  In my case, I chose to have a D&C because I did not want to take the chance of any complications had I tried to miscarry on my own.  I didn't want to have to rush to the hospital and not have my own Dr. there to do the procedure if I had to have it anyway due to complications.  Many women go through the miscarriage on their own..but I decided that I didn't want to deal with the bleeding and pain and passing of the embryo...I thought it would be emotionally better for me to have the D&C..and I was right.  I had VERY minimal bleeding afterward if any...and no pain..just a little crampy.  And then you deal with it emotionally and move on.  I am now 8 weeks pregnant and all is going well so far.  Before you try to conceive again...just be as healthy as you can be, take folic acid and prenatals and you should be fine.   Good Luck and stay positive!!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I think it all depends on what caused the first one. Lots of woman have one and get pregnant and have a healthy baby. Speak to your doctor about your concerns. Good luck and I'm sorry about the miscarriage. |`|AyWWItGpaa	Sorry for your loss hon , the same happenned to me when i was 8 weeks pregnant.<br>  Around 6 weeks afterwards i conceived again and now have a gorgeous 7 month old little boy.<br>  I was sooo worried for the first trimester until i actually got my ultrasound and later when i heard the heartbeat. But you must try not to you will just get so stressed out like i did this is why im telling you to try not to cause i was pretty much a nightmare to be around lol!<br>  The common reason for a miscarriage is just that the foetus has a defect , Not anything that you did. In most cases women will go onto to have children without there being anyproblems. Which obviously you know you can if you already have a child.<br>  <br>  My advice take the d&c , i chose to have the medical option which was pessaries inserted into my vagina to open the womb and for the miscarriage to complete. HOWEVER. this procedure failed and id put myself thru contractions and bad things like that for no reason. So i had to have the d&c anyway. I went home 3 hours later to be with my family which is what i wanted the most.<br>  I only bled for 1 day afterwards - because i had sex after 2 days. Obviously you are meant to wait 2 weeks because your womb is still open and there is great risk of infection. However i just wanted that comfort.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck hun x<br>  |`|LCLWxDcNaa	Is your uterus still tilted?  Usually a full term pregnancy will correct most tilted uterus issues.  The tilted uterus usually just makes it difficult to conceive, it does not usually cause miscarriage.  If you have had a healthy live birth and no other miscarriages your chances of getting pregnant again and carrying to term are very high.  There are a large number of pregnancies that miscarry that early, some women don't even know they were pregnant.  These early term miscarriages are due to to some genetic issue, nothing you did or have done, natures way of making sure that babies that make it into the world have the best chance.  <br>  As for the D & C, for a 5 week miscarriage, it is not necessary, but if your doctor thinks its a good idea, go for it.  It just makes sure that there isn't any remaining tissue to create an infection and due to your bacterial vaginosis, it might be a good idea.  It will not affect your ability to get pregnant again.  The bleeding will be more severe than if you were to pass it yourself, but not by much at only 5 weeks.  Doctor's don't usually try to discover a cause of miscarriages unless you have miscarried multiple times.  Usually it is just a DNA mismatch and nothing to worry about.  I had a healthy child and miscarried and was able to get pregnant again and go full term shortly after and that is the case with most miscarriages.
e1VMt2lIaa	Stop having sex with her until she gets birth control. You've made up your mind that you dont want another child right now. <br>  <br>  If you continue to have sex with her, she WILL get pregnant.<br>  <br>  Seems like she's trying to get pregnant.<br>  <br>  Just refuse until she's on birthcontrol.<br>  <br>  Nuvaring works well.

There is no difference in feeling for a girl, trust me.<br>  <br>  Do not keep pulling out. She will get pregnant.<br>  Do not just use spermicide. She will get pregnant.<br>  Do not try the "temperature" or cycle method. She will get pregnant.<br>  <br>  If she's not willing to take any form of birth control (there are so many kinds; more than just taking a pill everyday, that she can use.

This is a real game with some women, and  she just might lie to you... and she wouldn't be the first.|`|407e267410ec98d0524af9efd1fd2790aa	You could check into spermicides, but i can't remember if they pulled those off the market or not. what about gettin her an IUD? it cost a little more, unless your insurance will cover it. It will not release hormones into her system, and it last for five years. You can have it removed if you decide to get pregnant before that time. I have one and love it. I too didn't like condoms, or the BC, but the IUD was a great option for us. It's a simple in office at a gyno to insert (or remove) it. Best of luck!|`|AA11596041	Just avoid the middle of her cycle.  If she has a 30 day cycle, just avoid around the 13th to 17th day.  If she has a regular cycle every month, she should know when she ovulates.|`|33O7ZTRRaa	Sorry to say, you guys are kind of playing w/ fire in this situation.  If you don't use any kind of protection than you are increasing the chances of pregnancy.  <br>  There are so many different kinds of condoms out there that will not take aware from the pleasure.  There are also different lubricants (KY yours and mine, or warming lubricant).  You can also look into spermicidal lubricants, which will kill sperm.<br>  Is she against all birth control, or just the pill?  There are other kinds of birth control, there is the patch, or an IUC (intra uterine contraceptive), like Mirena which lasts for up to 5 years, but can be removed sooner if you want to get pregnant.  She can also you a diaphragm.  <br>  You guys really need to sit down and discuss this and find a workable solution.  You need to be using some kind of birth control method in order to prevent pregnancy.<br>  And the withdrawl (pull out) method will only work for so long...trust me.  <br>  Again, just sit down and discuss things with her.  If she is not willing to use any kind of birth control, then you will have to tell her that you don't want another child right now, and since there is no male birth control available in pill form, that leaves you with using a condom.  Tell her that you are willing to try different kinds until you find one that she is comfortable with, but that you want to practice safe sex.<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  |`|sIQzny5Taa	There's nothing over the counter that you can use to make you less fertile, and if there was it would probably be lasting and you might not be able to have kids ever again. I think she is either A) trying to become pregnant "accidentally" even though she really wants to get pregnant or B) just doesn't give a damn and doesn't care if she gets pregnant repeatedly she will just keep having abortions. You've only known her for a few months, so you probably don't know her all that well. I'm not saying you don't love her, and I'm not saying she doesn't love you, but if she refuses to have sex with you with any form of protection, but doesn't want to get pregnant, than she's got some serious issues. You will get her pregnant from the pull out method, you will get her pregnant no matter what you do without protection, you can even possibly get her pregnant USING protection! But there's less chance of that. And please, using a condom really doesn't make it feel any different for us at all, and if she's so in tune with her vagina then she would know that ribbed condoms actually give more pleasure to the woman. So, you either stop having sex with her, or be prepared for baby # 2. Good luck.|`|9rNNOEnwaa	Honestly I'd be careful with this one. I've known woman like this "that didn't want kids at the moment" only to accidentally on purpose get pregnant thus trapping the poor guy.<br>  <br>  Now I don't know you or the love of your life and I am not trying to say anything bad about either of you. I am only saying to be careful.|`|498a254714397d2ad22e5024acb666f6aa	Wow, Josh, I'm sorry.  If you use the POOT (Pull out on time) method, there is still a chance at pre-ejac getting her pregnant.  If she doesn't want to get pregnant and doesn't want to use birth control, sorry, but maybe you shouldn't sleep with her.  I hope things work out, but this just kinda sucks.|`|XHeiEgF1aa	Get some spermicidal lube. It helps tremendously. She may not need the lube, but the spermicide will do wonders. I would use some at the beginning and add some more halfway through to make sure. If you are pulling out, there is nothing in there but precum and the lube will take care of that.|`|rC6gL7KOaa	What does she have against birth control? I don't know of any other method you could use to prevent pregnancy. Pull out method IS NOT 100% effective, I got pregnant the first time using that.  Hmm, I can't help but think that maybe your girlfriend does secretly want to get pregnant.|`|9c8893607c79c3c2b3e1d6817da78217aa	I'm not sure what you could do, but she could look into FAM. By charting her temperatures, she will know exactly when she ovulated and when it is safe to have sex without getting pregnant.|`|2B2fgmw9aa	Try vaginal contaceptive films or foam, some type of spermicide, or have her get on the depo shot or nuva ring or something of the sorts that way she doesn't have to remember the pill.|`|e758fb3958a37c72824b506ee2786432aa	I don't know if they make it... but you could try looking for spermicidal lubricant?|`|ul79DG2kaa	Sounds like she wants to get pregnant and then blame it on you.  You didn't pull out fast enough so this is your fault. Like others have said she will get pregnant.  She should be taking responsibility for her own birth control.  There is a reason she doesn't want to use condoms.  She could be latex sensitive.  I am and I have to use non-latex ones.  They are called Avanti by Durex.  You will have to find them, usually in adult stores and they are pricey.  Cheaper than a baby though.  If she still refuses,  well then no sex.  Sorry man but one of you has to be responsible.|`|WEQzKbszaa	Well, she needs to start tracking her ovulation and cut out sex two weeks out of the month pretty much... or she needs to get some form of birth control... or you guys will be expecting soon.<br>  <br>  Tell her to get an IUD or IUS.  They can stay in for five years and you do not have to worry about regularly taking a pill or using something.  I highly suggest Mirena IUS.<br>  <br>  HTH<br>  <br>  Animalcrackers247|`|UudGWhnJaa	they have like spermicide luberication. but i dont know how effective it is....the pull out method does not work. be real careful and i hope that i helped you a bit. sit her down and explain to her she needs to understand and respect your feelings.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Don't have sex with her unless she uses protection.|`|aXESNuBKaa	spermicide|`|ae8abd07f171986eac5713fd79554f9caa	Personally, I think she is setting you up for more than a few potentially serious problems in your relationship. Is she morally against birth control, or does she not like side effects associated with the pill/patch/ring? If it's just she doesn't like taking the medication, then contraceptive foam/jelly is an option. She should respect your decision to use some type of contraceptive...just as I assume you would respect hers if your positions were reversed. Otherwise I think it is time for some relationship counselling, there needs to be some sort of compromise in this situation for the two of you.|`|tSZFmmnXaa	Spermicide.<br>  <br>  She may also want to consider having an Inter-Uterine Device like Mirena placed inside. They last for a good 5 years and more. Though they can be a little uncomfortable, they are about 99% effective in preventing pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Only thing that can happen is an ectopic pregnancy - a pregnancy inside of the fallopian tube, and these are rare.<br>  <br>  She will need a doctors prescription for it though. But it is a safe bet against unwanted pregnancy if she does not want you to use condoms, and if she doesn't want to go on the pill.|`|z781U5Foaa	You can tell her to get the depo shot which is done once a month but it can increase her risk of miscarriage later when she DOES want to have kids and that'll be hard on her. She should talk to her doc about it first.<br>  <br>  You know there are thousands of types of condoms, right? If she's fixed that condoms take away pleasure, try a different kind like lubricated or ribbed (ribbed usually increases pleasure for females) <br>  <br>  Or just add more things into your sex life besides penetration, like vibrators and toys and oral sex. Sounds like she's a little too focused on intercourse cuz shes taking a huge, huge risk by not using any form of birth control.
ioZeveazaa	I would skip the skating part and just enjoy the party. You DO NOT want to risk falling because that could be really bad. You can still have fun at the party. Good luck and have fun!|`|Yn6pM2Xyaa	in general they say once you are preggers you should maintain your normal level of activity and exertion and as you gain a belly you should stop participating in activites that require balance, riding a bike for example because having the belly hinders your balance.  At the same time too if you have a belly and you land on it there is the possibility for damage to occur to the fetus.  As you are only 8 weeks preggers balance is not an issue and you would not have a belly yet so thats not a problem either BUT that being said I wouldn't suggest you try to do figure 8's on skates.  If there is a role you can play in to help with the party that does not require you to be on ice then go for it but if you want to skate or there is a real need for you then you should be just fine.  Do what you feel comfortable with.|`|HF2HiUQJaa	You can go, it should be fine, just don't get ahead of yourself on the skates, normally when you fall on skates you land on your bum anyway.<br>  your baby wouldn't even be the size of a grain of rice atm so you shouldn't have anything to worry about, just take it easy.|`|015q1IKQaa	Skip the ice skating you can really hurt your baby if you fall|`|O5WberWnaa	hi hun.myself personally i wouldnt risk it.you have a little life inside you now.good luck x|`|HFcFU6OYaa	I wouldn't do it.|`|no5cuRbtaa	i'm 9 wks pregnant myself and i wouldn't do it. what if something happens? you'd blame yourself for the rest of your days. <br>  grow up and welcome to parenthood - there will be other things you won't be able to do once you are pregnant and then have a baby, like drinking and smoking, partying all night long, sleeping until noon etc..etc...<br>  not to be pessimistic ok - i've been a mum for 5 yrs and i just love it. it's just that you'll have to learn to choose what's best for your children now - and not what's convenient for you.|`|AA10442022	Skip it! if you do fall you dont want that guilt over your head- the first trimester is the most important time for you- your baby is so fragile and even the smallest jolt could cause it to stop developing- i am not saying go on bedrest but stay away from activities where you could fall :)|`|H0fXySX9aa	skip ice skating i was an ice skater as a child and even i fell dont risk it just watch <br>  <br>  the worry with falling is the risk of miscarrige and if you are not used to it its not worth the risk for that prescious bundle you are carrying|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	No I wouldn't risk it. You don't want to accidently fall on your stomach. I would just watch but I wouldn't actually skate. I'm sorry!

u8bEX5Qzaa	I understand the grouchy part but in all seriousness there should be a section called that. There's this place called answer bag, it's like yahoo 7 answers but they have a section called that, no lie lol. That question gets asked so many times on here!|`|s8f2ZPdGaa	There are two types of "Am I pregnant?" questions.<br>  <br>  Type 1:<br>  <br>  A 14 year old girl who was irresponsible and is now in a bad situation and because of her young age has no idea what to do.<br>  <br>  &<br>  <br>  Type 2:<br>  <br>  Women who are actively TTC and looking for hopeful advice from those who have been pregnant before.<br>  <br>  Type 1 fustrates me but what can you do, right?  However, with type 2 I try hard to help those hopeful TTCer's with my own knowledge.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I think there should be. And that way if people want to answer questions like that then they can go to the category. Lol. It doesn't really annoy me but all the questions are pretty much the same and the answers are pretty much obvious as well. (Unprotected sex leads to pregnancy)haha. |`|gzQIstDFaa	DEFINITELY!<br>  I wonder how many times a day that gets asked on here. <br>  Let's face it ladies- no one on answers can tell you whether or not you are. You wait till you miss a period and then you either test or see a dr or even both! |`|Q6YboW9Daa	There should be an "Am I Pregnant?" category and an "Abortion" category.  |`|U7R151uHaa	No it's one question   - why don't people look before asking more and more. There are so many and it is a bit tiring. Take a test or wait it out.|`|CPdgExZXaa	i think that if anyones questions even come close to that category they should be permentantly deleted off yahoo :)|`|bfba7e678801603c16db14f522c65b85aa	YES!!! I think we should start a petition or something to get one started... or somehow force them to browse through the thousands of other questions that list the same symptoms or problems they are asking about|`|a6d2Ocecaa	Yessssss ! Omg . So sick and tired of those questions. They just tke up so many space on here . WE ARE NOT HUMAN HPT TEST PPL ! Geezzz !|`|pkqpVY7Raa	Yeah, and they should just have automated answers which say 'The pull out method IS NOT A METHOD, take a home pregnancy test or one at your doctors.'|`|F6W0s7Ehaa	They may be ridiculous but there are some helpful replies.|`|cHJ1Xf2saa	yep, i agree!<br>  <br>  I can't stand the ones where they say there 14 and ask what they should do|`|uXMqQ6GNaa	I vote for it. :)|`|8N4aPcpaaa	Get over it...LOL|`|ytgI66nFaa	I feel the same way. why don't they go to the doctor or take a test.|`|w2uktQyBaa	Tell me about it, I want to just say to everyone asking... umm... how about you take a test and find out???!  :)|`|yPPUcJn6aa	Well, we are psychic on here.........lol|`|SDjrojZXaa	or a not trying to concieve but i just may have....lol some people are so rediculous!

Sometimes, there are 15 of those questions on one page and it seems like a waste of space in a section where the space would be better served for women who are already pregnant and need answers.  The women who are TTC and have questions should know how to word the questions and where to place them.  |`|3qI1oyFaaa	YES.<br>  SERIOUSLY.<br>  DRIVES.ME.CRAZY.<br>  Especially the questions asked by incredibly stupid people. If you don't know what can and can't get you pregnant, keep your legs closed. I saw a question a minute ago where the girl's "partner" put the condom on wrong and had to take it off and put it on correctly. If you can't master the skill of putting on a condom, don't have sex because the LAST thing the world needs is people like that reproducing.<br>  Thanks, venting feels gooooooood.|`|yPNvecc7aa	Well I some of the questions may sound ridiculous, but they are still honest.<br>  <br>  However I do think that the "Am I pregnant?" questions on here should be in the "Trying to conceive" category. |`|14VY9VQCaa	you don't have to read them hun. its hard when your trying believe me i've been there most of them just want to hear reassurance x |`|PUMIYkw8aa	Ha! YES! I wanted to post this question myself, thanks for having the guts :D|`|rC6gL7KOaa	I agree!! How the heck would we know if they're pregnant?|`|0do2ixtWaa	I agree it is annoying..  It is simple <br>  TAKE A TEST!!!! <br>  <br>  LOL|`|hJwheleJaa	I agree. Like... every other question is AM I PREGNANT!? Its like... take a damn test!
a03fa4884ad51e3db19db55334d523a5aa	Wait a little while and take another test. When i first got pregnant i was tired alot, sleeping sometimes 14 hours a day! After you take another test whether positive or neg, i think you should go see a doctor and tell them what's been going on.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I would test in another week.

If it comes out to be POSITIVE, then you are.... If it is NEGATIVE, that could mean 1 of 3 different things, 1) it could mean your not pregnant, obviously<br>  2) It could mean you took it too early<br>  Or<br>  3) It could be a FALSE NEGATIVE, They do happen...<br>  <br>  But if you really want to make sure, wait and see if you miss your period... but keep in mind that a small number of "pregnant" women can have up to 3 periods and still be pregnant, it is possible...|`|rsEK17n1aa	I think you tested to early I will give it a week or 2 and test yourself again.  |`|7c590b9146b7b250a93a8753d07308c5aa	I would go to the doctor and get BLOOD DRAWN!|`|ioZeveazaa	I would go see a doctor.

KDW7gvckaa	Occassionally when my son is being looked after by his granma and he runs out of my expressed breast milk he will get a little bit of formula and it gives him a pain in the tummy when he has it. Formula is alot heavier then breast milk is, so it will take a while for his stomach to get used to it. You could try giving your son "gripewater" or a similar product (I use infacol wind drops every feed - breast feed -). <br>  Also, just a warning about soy formula, it is renound for constipating babies. So if he isn't lactose intolerant stick with the regular formula for a few more days, and give the drops a go. Hopefully the drops will help, along with time for his stomach to adjust. <br>  <br>  Hope all pans out well for you.|`|1567c029c49472b97cf18cca163e810baa	my daughter would cry SOOO much after i fed her.Her poops were almost black and hard.  I had to switch to similac low iron. My doctor didnt want me to because he said she should be getting the extra iron but i read a ton of articles that said when babies are born they are born with a storage of iron that lasts until they are about 4 months old. That is when they should get other iron supplementation like in the formula... I would switch for now and see if that helps - it cant hurt!!|`|36guiahyaa	You can either try baby gas medicine for a while or switch to soy formula but when switching formula it takes a little while for them to adjust to it. If at all possible breast feeding is the best. If not just give the baby a chance to get use to the formula. Formula can be really harsh on a baby especially if you nursed first.|`|jNN7YHphaa	it could be too much iron in with i would go to a formula with less iron or it can be gas. sometimes babies are sensitive to certain formulas. I would try different formulas and see what works best for your baby.|`|P0EAzyw8aa	change to a soy formula this should help any bowel problems<br>  he will have to get used to the taste but after a few bottles he will be ok with it. cramps/wind usually mean lactose intolerance and this can occur after being ok with it previously. when he is about 4 months choose baby food that contains no milk or cheese as this might effect him.
0Sv8PiH9aa	If your period was lighter then normal and was more like spotting then you may be.

HN9twtQlaa	Leela sounds nice, but I dislike the spelling of the name. I'm not quite sure about alternative spellings, but something just doesn't look right about that double ee. Grace is an overused filler middle name, but it is quite pretty. <br>  <br>  Lana sounds nice, yet I would not recommend this name. Spell it backwards. Nevaeh is to heaven as Lana is to _____. If you really like the name Lana, then I'd recommend you use it as a nickname for Alana. Alana Macy flows quite well. <br>  <br>  Delilah Shae: I love the name Lila, and the sound of the name Delilah. However, I would not use it because of the negative associations with her character in the bible (and this is coming from a non-Christian), and because of the name's meaning: 'delicate, weak, languishing'. I'm not fond of Shae, but I don't hate it either. <br>  <br>  Daniel and Cameron both feel a little bit dated to me. They are names common with boys my age. On the other hand, Oliver and Henry have a certain old fashioned charm. Henry Oliver is actually one of my favourite name combinations. Joseph and James are both timeless classics, and you really can't go wrong with either name. <br>  <br>  I have many favourite names. I've just started to list all of the names that I find interesting here: <a href="http://www.behindthename.com/members/view.php?id=81972" rel="nofollow">http://www.behindthename.com/members/vie...</a>|`|OQVLOgUwaa	Leela Grace is pretty<br>  Lana Macy Is going to et pronounce LA na and Macy reminds me of Macy's, what about Larna Marcy?<br>  Delilah Shae is also pretty but I prefer Shay<br>  <br>  Daniel Oliver is a great boys name!<br>  Cameron James is also great nn CJ?<br>  Joseph Henry is cute too.<br>  <br>  My favorites are <br>  Girls: Audrey, Caitlin, Katherine, Eleanore, Shayla<br>  Boys: Connor, Liam, Silas, Seth, Shay|`|Vt1ZACkDaa	Leela Grace - it's nice<br>  Lana Macy ( Lar-na )- it's nice<br>  but how about Lana Grace? I like that better<br>  Delilah Shae - Delilah is nice but shae is alright <br>  <br>  Daniel Oliver - nice!<br>  Cameron James- Nice!<br>  Joseph Henry -nice!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I do like all of them.

My favorite boy's names are Bobby, William, Frank, Floyd, and Roman. Do you like any of those?|`|e17025d63b591426b1c43c2197cd3fc8aa	I like Grace and Macy for a girl. I love oliver, James, and Joseph Henry for a boy. 
O5WberWnaa	hi.contractions are really painfull.the only bit that hurts is when the babys head is crowning(that stings) ive had 4 natural births and im due with my 5th in april.aslong as you listen to your midwife you will be fine.good luck and dont worry x|`|Js09FbDnaa	I was in labor with no painkillers for 19 hours total. The first 10 hours were uncomfortable but not terribly painful. Sort of like wearing jeans that are too tight, then popping the button open and going aaahh, then they button themselves back up and you're going ow ow but not dying in pain.<br>  <br>  The last 9 hours were really bad BUT they are manageable. Definitely the most painful part of childbirth by far.<br>  <br>  When it got time to push, it was painful but at that point you really don't care, and you push & push and it's over. I was sore from head to toe but not in pain once he was born. And you really forget the worst of it with time, it's all worth it.<br>  <br>  Congrats!|`|5kDY65NGaa	Contractions are certainly more painful. Most ppl do not feel much during pushing due to several reasons like they already had contractions so the pain of pushing seems less, The idea of just getting it out gives power , and its quick. For me contractions were 4 hours and pushing was for 10 mins. so later was quite easy...|`|MOG0Q8kiaa	pain is unbearable wife passed out because of pain.|`|VzzTNuPYaa	i ended up having my first and only baby by emaergency c section as i was only 6 months pregnant and once my waters broke they stopped, so i had to be rushed in.<br>  <br>  But i went through all of labour and would of done i guess if he hadn't have been so tiny and small.<br>  <br>  I went through ALL of the contractions and only had gas and air for 5 mins before i was rushed through to theatre (it was a close call i got to the hosp in time!)<br>  <br>  The contractions were excrutiating---i remember thinking "thank god there's no knife in this car else i'll be ending my own life so i dont have to go throught his anymore" lol!!<br>  <br>  One minute i was screaming with the pain the next whimpering as i couldnt take it anymore. (My labour went VERY VERY quickly though)<br>  <br>  But, looking back, i am glad of the pain as it really helped me to push him out (or try)<br>  <br>  Now i didnt GIVE birth (poor fellow only got his little arm and the cord just out of my cervix) but i gave birth to my waters....lol very strange! That did kind of sting down there, but compared to the contractions...... and asking my mum....id say the contractions are the most painful.<br>  <br>  However, i personally get more scared thinking about it ocming out and ripping rather than the mind-blowingly painful contractions! lol|`|eFk4erZoaa	Most pains are unique but I would have to say yes the contractions hurt much more worse than the actual pushing and without a pain killer, the pushing will be burning and hurting quite a bit but you'll want to do it to get it over with.|`|44KcdFrwaa	yeah i had a natural birth and the contractions were awful and i had them for 20 hours, the pushing out bit is also painful aswell|`|WrGq35zSaa	For me yes.<br>  I never even felt my son's coming out, the contractions were killing me. I had 2 drug-free vaginal births, and with my first, I was trying to get off the bed, and my first born son's head was half out. I had no idea.<br>  I didn't know they were out, till they were getting my Husband to cut the cord. But I felt every single contraction.<br>  |`|JBzNXFidaa	Different pain. The actual pushing and crowning stings like crazy. Imagine all that stretching!! In my opinion, the contractions were much worse. They last 4 hours. Pushing lasted 20 mins, so that might make a difference too.
EvXqkrvAaa	Every womens breasts will increase to different sizes and at different stages of pregnancy but they will deffinately get bigger during pregnancy, not sure why areola and nipple gets darker, everyone's do it. Most womens do eventually turn back pink (or colour they were before pregnancy) but they will stay big forever.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Everyone is different. I'm 20 weeks pregnant and mine have already gone up an entire cup size. If you are flat chested they will still get bigger. I don't exactly know why your nipples get darker I just know it has to do with your hormones. |`|T4EACRm8aa	It may not increase at all. It depends on the person.<br>  Most women's breasts do increase when they are pregnant but "how much" depends on the person.<br>  Diet, genes, exercise, etc. can all be factors.<br>  Mostly it is out of your control.|`|iyRWN59Xaa	Don't you think that would depend on the woman?  Not only that, but it depends on the pregnancy of that one woman.  My first pregnancy they became HUGE.  This second pregnancy, still big, but they didn't get as big this time.|`|bTKD2GHnaa	i went from a AUSTRALIAN b cup to a e cup, they were huge.after my milk came in they got even bigger. my nipples went darker, don't know why. they will get bigger but they will get smaller after breast feeding ( and normally a little saggy)|`|veO1RXrCaa	It depends,  This time the change has been really dramatic.  I got even bustier all the sudden.  With my son it was a slow steady change.  And last time my nipples etc got really big.  Like tea saucers.  This time they have gotten darker and the actual nipple is bigger not some much the aureole.  Im not sure why it gets darker maybe increased blood flow to the area.  <br>  <br>  ETA Yes it goes back to normal.  At least for me it did.    Its quite amazing.|`|gxlEqdclaa	Usually you will go up a cup size but some women go up 2 or 3 cup sizes. It doesnt matter what size you are to begin with all boobs get bigger. Im not sure why nipples go darker.
RQPqbpxVaa	This sounds exactly like what happened to a friend of mine.  <br>  <br>  The best thing she did in this situation was to get rid of him.  She doens't talk to him, she doesn't respond to his texts, and told him it's over.  Why would you want to keep putting yourself through this?  If he's that much of a jerk, stop punishing yourself.  You can find someone so much better.  Someone who wants to be with you.  Someone who would like to spend their life with you and have that beautiful baby with you.  <br>  <br>  Stop putting wasted effort into a guy who's just stringing you along for sex.  Find a real man.|`|bIvsLrCUaa	He doesn't sound like a very good man.<br>  <br>  I personally would forget about him and find someone else.|`|v0596BTeaa	Move on.  Find a man who wants a real relationship with you, not just texts and the occasional episode of 'fun'.  Grow up! and sort out your life.|`|fc3045470b792b9f04d696b7f2f9cd91aa	This is not a pregnancy question.  You are asking for advice about a man, who frankly doesn't sound like he's interested in doing anything with you but have sex.  For your sake, you need to let him go before you get involved with him and get pregnant again.  No man that loves you will tell you that he loves you, then disappear for days on end without calling you. Leave him alone.|`|fY0uG1o2aa	you do realize that when he is NOT texting you its because he is with another woman he is fooling (just like you).<br>  <br>  You do not need this man, unless you plan on being baby mama #200 million.. This man probably has kids everywhere.<br>  <br>  and btw-  go get yourself tested for every std out there. Your life may depend on it.|`|fPX1lD8uaa	You need to find a way to move on... it seems to me like he's using you.  Just stop all contact with him and find someone who will appreciate, love and not pay head games with you.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|44QPXU5eaa	I am sorry but you need to cut ALL ties with that boy. Once a cheater always a cheater. If he does love you he would be going out of his way to prove it to you but it just sounds like he is keeping you on the side for when he wants a bit of fun. I know that sounds mean but you deserve so much better then that! Get away from him and find a MAN that is going to treat you like a queen and give you everything you can image. It will be hard but time heals everything. Good luck honey be strong|`|9XXZ8lHfaa	You say that you cant get over this guy, why? he has treated you and all of these other women really bad. Why would you want to have a relationship with someone who treats women this badly. if you decide that you want to have a relationship with him what is the guarantee that he wont continue to sleep around, with his track record i hope that you are both having safe sex and not just to prevent another unwanted pregnancy either.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It sounds like he's playing you. If he loved you he wouldn't go that long without talking to you and he wouldn't ignore you. I think that if you let him treat you that way then he's going to keep doing it. You need to tell him how you feel and if things don't change then you have a decision to make. Either you go on like things are or you need to just forget him even if it's hard. Good luck.|`|g8AYh6YCaa	this may sound harsh but hes playing you for a plank, dump this guy on his lousey b-hind and move on, god i hate guys like these...hes using you for "fun" you deserve alot better, <br>  <br>  get out there on a girly nite out and bag yourself a proper decent guy! theres plenty out there!<br>  <br>  and if he realises what hes missing, keep it cold and dont get involved! that will teach him a lesson|`|LOXGwXDwaa	he obviously doesn't care about you.<br>  he's just fooling around, he likes to call/txt you when he has<br>  noone else to bother or have fun with.<br>  comeee on, dont be so naive and get tricked by him!!<br>  hes a total jerk, ignore him, and DO NOT reply back to his texts!!!<br>  why would u still like him? if he lies, cheats, and is just nott reliable??<br>  |`|Q6YboW9Daa	Grow up and get over him.  He's a douche bag.
59GymH27aa	I wouldn't bother too much with those websites as everyone is different and you don't want to feel bad if you are putting on 'too' much weight or worry if not enough.<br>  <br>  Also wanted to say read your profile and I really hope you OH is out in time for the birth.  My partner only made it out 3 days before and I was so grateful to have him there.  Good luck xxx|`|fjZeVLOQaa	i woodnt bother with them websites coz everybody is different as long as ur bump is growing an ur midwife is happy why worry there r measurements that ur midwife should start doing of ur belly soon,nothing is accurate as i was sent at 39 weeks pregnant for a growth scan because they thought i was gonna ave a big baby due to my measurements turns out i had 7lb 5oz boy 10 days over my due date,i was carryin alot of water,|`|VEEbzc4jaa	Well im 30 weeks and i should have (apparantely) have put on about 15-18lbs and i have only put on 9lb. Midwife isnt worried so im not. She sed i should count myself lucky.<br>  <br>  Dont worry mate, they will raise the alarm bells if there worried. Its not necessary the weight you gain but the growth of the baby that counts.|`|RizlnGVYaa	<a href="http://www.i-am-pregnant.com/encyclopedia/W/Weight-Gain/" rel="nofollow">http://www.i-am-pregnant.com/encyclopedi...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  this should help you out and you should get an idea of the weight you may put on through pregnancy..<br>  =]  xxx|`|90oKpg9paa	ignore your first answer if you were not gaining enough weight your midwife would have spoken with you about this and obviously everything is fine with your baby!<br>  everyone is different and everyone gains weight at different speeds i didnt really start putting any weight on till i was about 22 weeks pregnant with my first and she was a healthy georgeous little girl x x|`|l3lhcRDcaa	I found a great website: <br>  <a href="http://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/weight-gain-tracker" rel="nofollow">http://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/we...</a><br>  <br>  This will tell you the average weight gain which you should stick to and also allow you to plot your own weight gain. When I was 23 weeks I had gained around 9lbs.<br>  <br>  I am now 37 weeks.|`|BUI9HnH1aa	there is a weight calculator at babycenter.com<br>  but everyone is different , and there isnt really a set weight that u should gain ..<br>  <br>  I had gained about 6lbs by 23 weeks , but a friend who was pregnant at the same time had gain around 25lbs by 23 week|`|e5a8ca9a40c842fd6f909812078000a7aa	Hey :)<br>  <br>  I don't really know of any sites but i'm sure if you Googled it you might find quite a few!!!<br>  <br>  My favourite pregnancy site though is 3dpregnancy.com its an american site but it tells you what size your baby is by saying something like 'this week your baby is the size of a packet of oreos....' Thats what mine is this week hehehe!!<br>  <br>  Good Luck hun xxx
6kKbxd3Jaa	I tink the best thing you can do for your daughter is to give her a sibling, i don't think 3 or maybe even 4 years when the new sibling is born, is such a big age gap. <br>  <br>  Obviously you will have to assess your finances, and see if you are able to move into a bigger place but that doesn't necessarily mean to do that straight away that could happen after the baby is born.<br>  <br>  Congratulations on expanding your family!|`|HoaYK0aTaa	Hi,first of all good luck with the new baby.<br>  I have 3 children and there are 4 years between all of them.now grown up aged 38,34,and 30.<br>  They have always been close and each helped the others growing up.<br>  It also meant one child was out of nappies before the next one arrived,and I didn`t have the trauma of two toddlers together!<br>  You could always move later on if you have a boy,or if a girl they could share a room indefinately.<br>  You go for it!|`|hFsl7WpPaa	I think that is the perfect age for you to have another child. Your daughter is old enough to play by herself a little and can do things for herself and you could involve her by getting her to help you out by getting nappies etc.|`|fjZeVLOQaa	i got 3 boys 12years,8years an 6 months an i find its easier with an age gap as the understand an can get involed more,and as ur not actually expectin yet u ave plenty of time to assess if u need to move even if u dont move untill the new baby is 18 months or so|`|R8HWkcoMaa	The age gap will probably make it easier if anything.<br>  <br>  I have had both ways there are 5yrs between 1st & 2nd but only 2.7 yrs between 2nd & 3rd.<br>  <br>  They all get on fine now (they are 11, 6 & 3).<br>  <br>  Children only have to have seperate bedrooms if they are different sexes once one of them reaches 10 yrs old.|`|fHgbL046aa	I wouldn't worry about it at all. I say go for it! I am 20 weeks pregnant and my daughter is 16 years old. I wouldn't say my situation is Ideal, but none the less I am ecstatic.Good luck|`|W5G9LLenaa	The age gap won't matter but you say you're doing it for your daughter and your partner, but what about you, how do you feel?
AA11673900	Ultrasound?|`|AA11128798	An ultrasound is the only way to be sure.|`|4729cf49ace823bdfc0dd70ac28b8fecaa	Ultrasound is probably the best bet.|`|AA11409466	Also a technician can use a fetal heart monitor to see if there are two heartbeats.|`|AA12342988	I asked mum's of twins if they knew before their first u/s...majority said: NO. It was a surprise to them at their 8wk u/s to discover there was more than one.
AA11663226	I think you might be. like it was said earlier wait a few weeks and see. I hope you are . If so congrats in advance!|`|d95aa0e044dd2bcc4c66c3d8eee4430aaa	You should take a test...I think you should wait 1 -2 week to take it though...It'll be more accurate.|`|606bdd67f689698b9e77086d3bdd07bbaa	ummmmmm, yes I would say you are !!!|`|794055db8ccebca72e1e3b5d63059114aa	I hope you are!!! The best of luck to you and your family!|`|e235f43ac3f119ecf3c83eb380d40e01aa	Maybe you should buy a pregnancy test? And then see your family doctor for accuracy?? But good luck!!!
0BC2WTyoaa	Lexie Angelina Morgan Brown<br>  Lexie Ashlyn Morgan Brown<br>  Lexie Ava Morgan Brown<br>  Lexie Alexandria Morgan Brown<br>  <br>  I prefer the spelling Lexi after typing it a few times.|`|eBKJRmEgaa	I think it looks contrived (well, it is!). I also think Lexie is insubstantial as a first name, it's only a nickname.<br>  Alexandra Morgan Brown would be nice. Or even better, Alexandra Morgaine Brown or Alexandrie Morgana.|`|syrh8J6Vaa	I don not like 4 names so maybe a hyphonated name would give you the results you are looking for without dooming your baby when it comes to writting the name on a form that only has enough room for 3 names.  So my choice would be Lexi anne-marie Brown|`|qmvJPRlVaa	I like Alexis a lot better with Lexie for a nickname. Alexis Morgan Brown sounds nice.|`|TJIIMwmxaa	I like Lexie Amber and i would call her that too. But do what you want to do. My daughter has four names but it doesn't spell anything though lol..|`|SF1uPJZhaa	For a stripper in a story you're writing or an actual human child?<br>  |`|QAMF2HBYaa	if I were a kid I don't think I'd be keen on Morgan for a middle name. Go with Amber Morgan and when she's older she can grow into the Morgan or pretty much ignore it forever. Besides Amber is one of those kind of nice gem names which go over well.<br>  <br>  But yeah, why Lexie? Is it short for anything? If so, give her the longer version and let her decide if she wants to shorten it. Lexie is a bit cute and she may resent having to appear as cute as the name is.|`|QBKzvw4faa	I don't like Lexie Amber Morgan..<br>  <br>  I really like Lexie Morgan.. <br>  <br>  & LAMB as initals is kinda weird.. |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I hate when people their children 2 middle names. It's weird. I do like Lexie though. Leave out the amber. I like Lexie Morgan Brown.|`|O13WA5Hqaa	I'm not crazy about Lexie (sound a bit weird), maybe just Amber Morgan Brown ? :D - that sounds pretty :D<br>  <br>  Addie|`|SUnDwvEnaa	Why would you give your child 4 names just so it spells out any 4 letter word... Let alone "LAMB?" She's going to get teased for that. Stick with Lexie Morgan Brown.|`|il9Tdmchaa	I like Lexie Morgan I've always loved the name Morgan for a girl.|`|F2cmBaClaa	lexie morgan brown|`|2590ff94dee238fa148fd707c96bb4fbaa	What about Lexie Amber Brown?|`|3rRAbNDqaa	My daughters name is Lexi and we love it. We are always asked what its short for and when we explain its just Lexi we get lots of compliments. I think it's beautiful and simple, easy to pronounce and easy to spell. |`|tSXZU983aa	Alexis Morgan Brown - or if you want the four names to spell lamb I also like Lexia Angelina Morgan Brown. |`|Yy7M4l5eaa	Lexie Amber sounds better to me!|`|v0owYYwBaa	EW NO
XSMlYubmaa	GO OUT!! I'm 37 weeks pregnant and still go out. I would go crazy sitting at home all the time. No one will expect you to drink, and it's fun to watch all the dumb drunks. More importantly you want to make sure that your bf gets home safe. When I walk into the bar, everyone yells the DD is here! I'll give rides to anyone who needs them. THey better return the favor when I go out and get hammered off of 3 beers after baby comes. LOL Take along a pop and carry it with you so that everyone knows that you aren't drinking and it shouldn't' be an issue. You're pregnant not dead. Get out and have some fun! |`|AA10439410	I would go! If it's not a dangerous situation for you or the baby, you owe it to yourself to get out of the house...especially while you still can. In twelve more weeks, you'll be shut in for a little while! Plus, your bf needs to unwind while he still can, and if he plans on drinking and may need a designated driver, you can do that with ease. Have fun, don't worry about it, and enjoy yourself!|`|FvonW0Gmaa	Just go and have fun.  YOu will regret it if you don't.  You aren't planning on drinking, you aren't planning on smoking, and if anything happens that you feel uncomfortable with, hopefully your husband will respect you and get you out of there.  I don't think it's a big deal.  I mean, I know you probably get tired early and stuff, but I think once you are there you will be glad that you went. |`|L42LJ1P4aa	I think you should stop feeling so sensitive about being pregnant and enjoying yourself. It's okay to party as long as you're not drinking, doing drugs, or engaging in acts that can harm your baby. If people invited you, they like you and want you to come! Regardless of your pregnancy, holiday season is around the corner and its time to enjoy yourself and socialize!|`|PRg9UgOlaa	Give it a shot and go, but ask your boyfriend before you go if you two can leave (together! my hubby tries to get someone else to take him home) if you feel uncomfortable. He should be okay with this. Just make sure you ask him before you go. I am sure you will enjoy yourself, so give it a shot!!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It's up to you. But if they all know you're pregnant then I'm sure no one is going to judge you. As long as it's a safe environment then I don't see any problem with getting out of the house and having fun.|`|L1huUpWsaa	Go out and have some fun!  As long as you don't drink or smoke. It is okay to do something fun even when you are pregnant!  If you feel nervous, just joke that you were brought along to be the designated driver!  |`|6776aca5f3e214a39f2baaa61927b183aa	you are pregnant.  no one thinks your fat, they think you are pregnant, which is the case so don't worry.  |`|hZGuxDKXaa	Go and show off your beautiful belly :)|`|lSbhtFygaa	go and have fun enjoy yourself just dont do anything to harm the baby ....show off your big pregnant belly...i love too.|`|wBCR9Ad5aa	yeah go. its not like u gonna be all crazy party girl.|`|gx4s68s8aa	I would go.  I am sure you will look really cute.  Don't worry people don't judge pregnant woman (I mean we all came from pregnant mother's didn't we)  But you might want to bring your favorite pregnant friendly drink.  That way you aren't just sipping ice water or whatever they happen to have that is nonalcoholic.  So go out and have fun.|`|WxQFe0GYaa	I'm a little confused.  Why would you be totally embarrassed?  Why would anyone be judging you?  I don't see any reason not to go to the party.  |`|AA10949064	I don't understand why you would be embarrassed about being out in public while you are pregnant?  Are women supposed to stay home and hide until they have their baby?  Go out and have a good time.  Be proud of your belly - that's YOUR baby in there!!!  If anyone has anything to say (I doubt they will), tell them to mind their own business.|`|lARcutEqaa	I'd say go out and enjoy yourself and if you end up feeling un-comfortable you can always go home. You'll probably be overwhelmed with congrats and belly rubs so I'm sure it'll be a positive experience. |`|X83LVP6Iaa	You do not have to stpo your social life just because you are pregnant. You can still go, have a good time and not drink alcohol. |`|fjeFBGlqaa	yea i get worried too,but its not good to just sit in the house,so go and if its not right leave. your boyfriend should understand.
miPubuDYaa	No i do not think you are pregnant. However if it still concerns you make an appointment with your doctor|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It's possible. Lots of people have false positives. You are having a lot of symptoms so you could be pregnant. Get a blood test.|`|NAj9UquUaa	yes u could be preggers but you could have a disease please contact me and il try and help not trying to worry u

It's kind of pretty!Stephanie is a beautiful name, its meaning is crown. It is a special name and not one that you hear too often. I think the worst thing that happens to this elegant name is that it is misspelled quite often. Whatever your name may be you should be proud and carry it well, after all your parent(s) with great love named you. You also can pronounce it Stef-an-ee. Also I think it is a wonderful name as not too many people have it and it is just a really intriguing name! Also my cousine is called Stephanie!|`|HguYciCBaa	I love this name.<br>  <br>   I think that it could be considered common so maybe changing up the spelling. The author Stephenie Meyer spells her a little different.

AA10780655	it depends it your at risk for preterm labor. Im at risk and Ive been getting checked at every appointment since 20 weeks. But I think most people start getting checked around 36 weeks.|`|AA11210211	It all depends on the doctor,mine started doing them at 30 weeks with my first pregnancy but they never did one with my second because I had problems dilating with my first and had a c-section and my body won't dilate so there was no need.|`|JT4OSUPeaa	I started getting checked about my 36th week, I heard that was about the average time.|`|kfCVRyVjaa	I was sort of wondering this too.   I'm 28 weeks and no one's gone near me 'down there' yet!.  I think the chances are that they don't check until you think you are in labour.<br>  <br>  In the UK at least I think this might be the case but open to be corrected.|`|oXzHvsBpaa	It depends on the doctor but its usually around 37 weeks or so. My doctor checks at 38 but I was never checked because I was being induced. |`|tivpa7Vlaa	 the Dr. doesnt check your cervix unless u r in labor. i am 36wks (9mths) and never had a cervix check yet. they don't usually check it unless they have a reason|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I wondered that too so I asked at my last appointment which was at 18 weeks and they told me they'll start checking me after 20 weeks so at my next appointment I guess they'll start doing that. I would expect for you to start getting them done at your next appointment too. |`|5OQLmECTaa	i just got my first test like that and i just turned 36 weeks.  and he asked if i wanted it first he didn't just reach in if you know what i mean.  and not dilation for me :(  i think baby is going to stay for her due date.|`|r4N3R0dtaa	Some doctors vary when they start checking for dilation but I'm 38 weeks and my doctor just started checking at my last appointment, so for me, I started to be checked at 38 weeks. |`|yQWnMSc6aa	Mine doesn't check until labor. However, I've had a few cervical checks because of preterm labor. It's VERY uncomfortable because during pregnancy usually the cervix is really high up. |`|OjHFN4imaa	My doctor (obgyn) never checked me at all. My midwife won't either. Not until labor has been well established. It helps prevent possible infections. I like not being checked. It's all so tender in there anyways..|`|Ov80qgeWaa	I think at about 36 or 37 weeks they will start checking your cervix to see what's going on.  Just be prepared...because it doesn't feel very good!|`|SIK58haraa	the doc checked me yesterday for the first time and I am 37 weeks.|`|ugTZWQCsaa	usually around 36 weeks or later|`|GNSimXSpaa	i just had my 36 week appt and they checked my cervix.
zIMoBfuvaa	sounds like everything is fine especially since the dr did say "everything was fine.". I wouldnt worry..they would have told you if something was wrong.|`|AykczQleaa	If there was anything wrong, the dr would have told you.  Or, at least I hope he would have.  The techs usually aren't allowed to say anything about what they see.  |`|dA9Tcp8Qaa	She could of been new and wanted to make sure she had everything right. <br>  <br>  I understand you being worried, but try not to. They said it was okay.|`|3sIoLMsVaa	When an ultrasound person takes the pictures, they have to make sure they took the pictures from the right angles. Every doctor is different and every doctor wants something different. They did the same thing to me and everything is fine.<br>  <br>  You have to remember that the ultrasound person works with hundreds of doctors, they have to please everyone!|`|mBeGdFO2aa	You want the tech to show the pics to the doctor.  My tech did tell me at the beginning: I always go over the pics with the doctor at the end, it's what I always do, do not be worried about this.<br>  <br>  If the doctor didn't tell you anything, I wouldn't be concerned about it :)|`|f5ZdHKvyaa	baby may have been lay funny and she wanted to just double check i'm sure if anything was wrong they would have said and want to do another scan. Try not to worry i had to have 6 scans and my baby was fine.|`|8w0786yeaa	They would have told you if something is wrong.  There was nothing wrong to have a doctor do a double check.|`|HF2HiUQJaa	The best thing you could do is to talk to the technician who did your scan and just ask them what they were looking at in the pics because it has got you very worried. If they said there is nothing wrong then there isn't, they won't lie to you, if there is something wrong they would tell you there and then, they won't hide anything from you. My friends son had the same thing happen, doc left the room to show another doc the ultrasound pics then came back in and told them their son had a cleft lip, so don't worry, if they said everything looks fine then everything is, they were probably just unsure about something and needed advice from another doc. Call them anyway just to put your mind at ease.|`|568N8wQuaa	Im sure your baby is fine, they would have told you if they had concerns trust me, the woman was probably new, or she probably mad a mistake with a previous ultra sound and is now double checking everything. Im sorry that happened to you, can i say that if it happens again don't be afraid to voice your concerns then and there, its your right.<br>  <br>  Congratulations and I hope you enjoy the rest of your pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Samantha x|`|T0gv52CDaa	Was the doctor who came in to check your OB, or the radiologist?  With my first son, at the 20 week ultrasound, the radiologist felt that his kidney's were enlarged.  He didn't tell me anything except that he wanted me to schedule a final u/s in 5 weeks.  At my next appointment with my OB she told me of their findings and that the reason for the 3rd ultra sound was to make sure that they had gone down to normal size.  Everything turned out to be fine with my son.  Most likely your baby is fine too, but the radiologist would leave it up to your OB to inform you if there were any concerns.  If you are really worried though, call your OB and ask.|`|2IxhQFzNaa	When I had a ultrasound at 20 weeks. The level II ultrasound. The tech did it. Then the Dr. came it to look it over. The Dr. said everything was perfect. The techs only know so much. A Dr. has to look at it though to make sure everything is ok. The tech just gets the images and the Dr. reads the images. If something was wrong the Dr. should have told you right then and there. Then the Dr. looked again himself to make sure that it was a girl like the tech said. Everything sounded the same for you as it did for me. Im sure everything is fine. |`|EfcS6HwJaa	A highly trained professional doctor said that there was nothing wrong...what do you think he is lying to you.  the tech probably just wanted to double check on everything and that is not a bad quality to have...just to make sure everything is all right.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	If there had been something wrong then the doctor would have told you. I understand why you are concerned but maybe you should talk to your daughter so that you can ease your mind a little bit. |`|Ulkdaardaa	The doctor is obligated to let you know if he thought something was wrong,  double checking is a good thing I wouldn't worry about a thing.  |`|kAdgwDFqaa	If something was wrong they would have told you.  Relax|`|60a20811e5cbf8f085c0afb72b184e44aa	I think it's typical that the doc looks at the ultrasound. It's like an xray of sorts. Just because tech reviews, doesn't mean that doc won't review. Ask again at next visit or call nurse if you are very concerned to calm yourself but I am guessing that everythng is fine if they have said everything is fine.|`|5HgFqU20aa	The tech is there to just take pictures,so to speak. <br>  If there was anything to worry about the doctor would have told you. Nothing to worry about, sweetheart. ((HUGS)). <br>  <br>  If you are really concerned either make an inquiry by telephone or ask at your next visit. <br>  <br>  Congrats and Good Luck|`|J9Tbun7naa	The technician is not qualified to analyse the results which is why she would've consulted the Dr... maybe some of the pics she took weren't quite clear enough.<br>  I am sure that if she said everything was fine then everything is fine.|`|9fea2a31ad2061394c0ccf90e32f204baa	If the doctor came in and then  said everything was fine then everything is fine but you should have asked your doctor this at the time.|`|ayzEz77Zaa	the doctor would have told you if there was anything wrong so don't worry to much on it the stress isn't good for the baby or you 
ElbIQ2xSaa	smoke a joint and have a bath.<br>  I used to get crippling cramps when I had my periods and my boyfriend would roll me a little joint and I would sit in the hot bath and relax. ha ha Im no pothead by any means...but it worked.|`|hVwI9uJOaa	i don't know about getting drunk, but i've had very bad period pains for ever, so bad that i used to take Panadine forte. <br>  <br>  the past couple of years i've been taking Nurofen Plus and they work wonders. also Naprogesic is reeeally good, specially naprogesic coz it's designed for period pain. <br>  But. <br>  <br>  you should definitely go to the doctor, and if they say it's normal, say Bull Sh*t. i ended up in hospital two months ago coz of the pain and they found out i have endometreosis. make sure your doctor sends you for an ultra sound. endo is very common in women, specially in their teens and 20s, or if they haven't had children. 1 in 5 women have it, if it's found early then they can control it, if not, ( like me) you have to have laparoscopy( keyhole surgery).<br>  <br>  |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Don't get drunk to take pain away. They have these things at walmart that are heating pads that you just put inside the front of your undies and it heats up. Believe me it works. I've been to the ER tons of times for horribly painful periods and besides heavy painkillers that they've prescribed those work the best. They're about $7 bucks for three and they work wonders. Try them. It's kinda a red box and they'll say for menstrual pain. Good luck and I hope it gets better.|`|b3dd5b0104705123682f2e1118ea1a2eaa	If you really want to be angry with yourself afterwards, then you must get drunk to get the pain go away.  Don't be stupid.  If you really suffer terribly from period pain, then go to a doctor and get correct mediation for it.  Alcohol is definitely not the answer.|`|iyRWN59Xaa	Uhm, no.  What about taking some Advil.  I had severe cramps and Advil always worked for me.  Also, try a heating pad on your tummy too.  But, getting drunk is not the way to go.|`|CoXE3uVVaa	i use to get really bad pains... man they were bad... theres a Tylenol and an advil that are just meant to take the pain away i must they they really helped me.|`|Oz4iblUEaa	well hun it could make it worse as they say liquor thins out blood so when a  woman is on her cycle she will bleed harder while drinkin..so it could add more pain with a heavier flow|`|79q0EPf1aa	The answer is NO my dear because if being drunk would take pain away then all the ladies would be drinking|`|VDpmh2VJaa	In the old days when there were no drugs my grandfather gave all the girls straight shot of whiskey to get the cramping pains to go away...try it.|`|ykP7I3caaa	yeah it should. try eating a banana or two because that really helps me. something to do with the nutrients in them being good for periods.  a heating pad helps me, i doubt a hot water bottle would because it just cools off etc and it doesnt cover your whole stomach. you should go on birth control though that will take it right away. try to buy a heating pad, not a hot water bottle. lay under a warm blanket with it and cover your whole stomach and put a pillow under the arch of your back [important!] or between your knees if you're on your side. but your back is best. try to make sure you're completely level lying flat and straight. sometimes it helps to bend your knees though. eat a banana and take a womens multi vitamin. and yes, get a little tipsy. try to use whine or something like that and not straight up vodka. it can really really help to eat well before your period.|`|ciPMWGfdaa	I take 2 aleve and it helps ALOT.  You need to stay away from alcohol and caffeine that does nothing to help it actually makes it worse.  I used to have them so bad I would pass out and throw up.  My doctor said no caffeine, or alcohol and take 2 aleve for the pain.  I tried hydrocodone that didn't help, vicodin that didn't either.  Hope this helps.|`|awRNr2VMaa	sure it will take the pain away but only until you wake up ... if it hurts that bad go to the doc it could be an infection or a sist or something i would go just to be safe!|`|wNSW0zCMaa	No, actually alcohol and caffiene make them feel even worse.|`|r9vT2RYXaa	well, if your drunk you probably won't notice the pain.<br>  You'll notice the pain from falling down stairs.<br>  Go for it! 
CJqK40uFaa	it  very well could have been. you can feel it from 15 weeks and over, dont let people tell her its too early. she knows her own body, and if she thinks it was the baby it probably was! good luck and congrats!|`|F9AiIcVfaa	yes it would have been the baby moving. this is what i expienced at 16 weeks. some ppl feel the baby as early as 13 weeks.<br>  congrats and best wishes|`|3cxwalh0aa	Yep, it could definitely be flutters. Soon enough you'll get to feel the baby kick, too! :)|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I think it is possible to feel that from 15 weeks on. |`|iyRWN59Xaa	Sure, she could feel fluttering by now.|`|wi7Ern8Raa	15 weeks is just a bit early with a first pregnancy to feel movement.  I was 18 weeks into my first pregnancy (with twins), before I felt anything, and even with my second pregnancy (a singleton) when I knew what to expect, I didn't feel anything until 17 weeks, and I am also VERY slim.  So I guess it could have been the baby, but not likely.  Tell her to hang in there -- there will come a day very soon when she'll feel it and she won't wonder if that was it -- it will be very obvious!  |`|AA12226266	baby flutters , from 15 weeks on you start feeling baby . enjoy |`|lzUF22l0aa	it deffintly could of been. ive been feeling my baby move since week 16 or 17. Good luck with everyhting
AA10625328	your water breaks|`|66ad94a5160780320e4522a1ca28f019aa	Some womens water breaks, but most dont unitl there doctors break it, so you cant really count on that. When your contractions get closer together is really when you know, they should be 5 mins apart for an hour. I have heard some women say that they have extreme back pain also. You may want to go to the lamaze class they should be able to tell you all the signs and give you more details.|`|4b1cd6f8acf288d3e4c34e492e956fcaaa	Every woman is different but with me I had a few things that were the same each time.  I got a burst of energy the few days before labor began some people call this feathering the nest.  I did lots of cleaning, shopping, and all around getting ready.  The other thing that I remember the most is I got really worried about all the little things not so much labor just things like packing my bag.  Good Luck|`|AA12117337	I knew that I was going into labor when I started feeling a lot of pressure and it got really uncomfortalbe for me to sit still in one position (I kept moving around). And then of course, when you are having contractions you know that you can be going into labor.|`|dd1cacb1cb6661c8e66a10af484aaf3faa	well some obvious physical signs are urge to push, contractions that won't stop,rupturing of the membranes (bag of waters), losing the mucus plug , dilated to 10cm- other women describe nesting instincts that kick in a few days before like scrubbing toilets with a toothbrush etc -- being a mother hen may signal baby is on its way. Other women get nauseated and have increased loose bowel movements etc right before they go into labor or as a start to labor- watch for low backache that won't go away, and contractions that don't go away!-- contractions feel like your stomach is very hard and can be compared to a very severe menstrual cramp that is rhythmic etc-- and lastly trust me you'll know when it is time to have the baby! :) good luck!
90zcKChJaa	They say a cup of coffee a day is 'safe', but everyone has a different threshold. I drank decaf throughout pregnancy for the taste...it's hard, but it's a taste of sleep deprivation that is to come once that baby is here!! lol. Drink LOTS of water. you will feel better when you are well hydrated and so will your baby! ;)|`|5OQLmECTaa	orange juice or any kind of juice for that matter, it is healthy and has plenty of sugar to help to get going... but you can still have coffee just not very much.  only like one cup and then no more caffeine the rest of the day.|`|wxImZRssaa	My doctor told me it was ok to have one to two cups of coffee a day. So every morning I would have one cup of coffee, and make do just drinking ice cold water for the rest of the day.|`|sBHhnDwaaa	Spiced Cider!!!<br>  18 oz Tang<br>  8 oz Instant Tea<br>  1 teaspoon of ginger, cinnamon, and ground cloves<br>  <br>  Mix it all together and add about 2 or 3 tablespoons to a cup of hot water.

My Dr. said it was ok.|`|5sTPhPGiaa	Chai Tea Latte!|`|nJNSiI4qaa	One cup of joe a day won't hurt you or the baby, you can confirm that w/your doctor.  I cut down to that one cup when I was pregnant, and this is still all that I drink.  It's good that we don't have to give up EVERYTHING right?|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	My doctor told me that you can still have a little bit of coffee. I think that if you are just having a cup or two of coffee in the morning then you are fine. Just speak to your doctor but I'm sure they'll say the same thing. Congrats!|`|ek2hPVogaa	i drank coffee during both of my pregnancies and had 2 healthy babies, one 7lbs and one 9 lbs, I really did nothing to modify my diet. |`|7wZoPVChaa	check with your doc, but mine said that one cup of coffee a day would be ok. just dont go overboard with caffeine.|`|FYt2gY87aa	I think you should get some Coffee and drink it every morning|`|bByy9iqeaa	Well, I suggest you stay away form cafeen anyways, because  it is said to potintualy harm the baby. If you are not taking prenatal vitiamins<br>  I suggest you start, this can help with your energy level. You should also walk every day for atleast a half hour, this should also help your energy level and it will help your labor be easier.(Dialate faster, speed up the labor process, and help in the delivering process) You may also ask your doctor for anymore tips for increasing your energy. Oh, and one tip, take a short nap if possible everyday.<br>  I hope this helps, the exercise and naps really helped me , also try soda if you really need the caffeen , but not Mt. Dew, it has way too much caffine in it. Caffine can cause your child to be hyper when born. Remeber, this is important for your labor process, exercise (walking), with my 1st child I did not, labor time 29hrs and 15 mins, dialation was very slow. 2nd I did some, but not enough, labor time 16hrs 40 mins, dialation faster, labor easier, but with my 3rd, I walked for 30 mins 5 times a week, labor time 8hrs, I was not even sure I wass in labor all I felt was pressure pushing down that woke me up, a 20 min drive to the hospital got there I was at 5cm, took a stroll down to the waiting room sat there for 20mins, returned to the labor room I was at 8, the nurses said if they didn't have proof I was in labor by my dialation, they wouldn't even think I was in labor. my labor took so long for the last one because, they kept waiting for me to dialated to ten from 9, I never have, pushed the baby through the cervics and in 15 mins he was out.|`|vue9NOhYaa	You can continue to drink coffee. Caffeine in moderation is fine. |`|cnMXJMFUaa	I couldn't have lived without my coffee when pregnant, you can absolutely have 2-3 cups a day and still be within whats considered the "safe" range!<br>  <br>  To take ALL caffeine out could cause you horrible headaches!|`|mBeGdFO2aa	Coffee!  I still have 2 cups every day, 28 weeks along now.  Or you can have tea, it has less caffeine or decaf, you'll still get that coffee flavour.<br>  <br>  the whole caffeine thing is totally over done, *millions* of women have drank coffee and have totally normal pregnancies and children before that 'study' came out last year.<br>  <br>  Your decision, but most women I know don't have a problem with caffeine :)|`|jNgh3e3Faa	Try half a cup. Slowly lower the amount and how often you drink it. Eventually you will be able to tell yourself you are okay with juice or water or maybe even some teas. Ask your doctor.Caffeine is shown to reduce the baby's weight and also reduces your breast size over time. |`|tae4IGumaa	chocolate milk|`|e68b22a4892a43457f773b8e0670573faa	Orange Juice
w3gd3iMIaa	No, that's an old one.  Now we know that baths are fine.  |`|8RfmosODaa	I don't think thats true. As long as they aren't hot baths your fine! Keep relaxing! |`|o2YHnKXiaa	That isn't true you can take as many baths as you want but they can't be to hot. As long as there warm there is nothing to worry about. |`|sYsfI856aa	My doctor and midwife have both told me it's alright to take baths while pregnant. Just make sure they don't exceed 100 degrees F and they are safe.  Also do NOT use bubble bath, doing so risks more infections, use bath oil instead. Lavender bath oil is very nice as it's calming and it helps keep your skin from drying out from bathing so much. I bathed every night while pregnant with my first and am doing so again. It's good for you to help you relax. So don't worry and just keep it at or under 100degrees F. |`|SfymamWtaa	you can take plenty of baths just no hot tubs or saunas|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I was told that as long as they're not hot then you are fine. I take one every night as well. Congrats!|`|isokr9cfaa	baths are perfectly safe during pregnancy as long as they're not too hot.|`|HKjns4EPaa	Back when my grandmother had children this was an old wives tale. There is no way taking a bath is unhealthy. They used to believe germs and what not would enter your body through your vagina and harm the fetus. But there isn't anyway that could really happen. Baths are safe all the way up  until the time your water breaks, at that point, no more baths.|`|a6694dfd49fcd265ee4c7718ccff9a75aa	As long as it's not above like 100 or 110 degrees...I don't think it hurts anything...it's not like a hot tub at a hotel or something. It's fine. <br>  <br>  The only time it would hurt is after your water broke...then you can get an infection.|`|fb8cf1b6c2124ec3abca58d3c8ea4a2baa	baths are fine - so is bubble bath, but bubble bath does increase your risk of a UTI - not really any risk to the baby though.  Keep it up girl, enjoy the relax while you can!|`|xD1LbRi4aa	As long as you dont put any bubbles in your bath and its just warm water then yes its fine. |`|LzwghKMOaa	I love taking baths!!! It calms my baby down from all the kicking! when my ma was 3 cm, dialated, she took a hot hot bath for like 15 minutes and she went from 3-10 cm.
nOzQUsToaa	Aurora is my favourite girl name, I'm planning to use it for my future baby. She's going to be Aurora Noelie, nicked Rory. =) I might change my mind later, as I'm quite young, but now it is the best name for me =). |`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Sleeping Beauty. :) Isn't that her name in the movie, Aurora Dawn? |`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	I like Dawn better than Aurora<br>  <br>  But Aurora, you can call her Aurora or Rori<br>  <br>  They both are nice names|`|EXBMxFCKaa	Dawn is a pretty name that'd work as an old-fasioned but not overused middle name for something a bit more becoming. I think Aurora is a bit of a moutful, not to mention it's harsh sounding but I do think of Sleeping Beauty. Dawn I think of serenity. <br>  <br>  |`|5edYekPjaa	I prefer AURORA. Is a very beautiful name. My favourite girl name is JAMIE AURORA: it reminds me a very pretty girl, with bright green eyes and an amazing body. And who is also a sweet girl|`|v6DRUwH7aa	Yes!  Princess Aurora comes to my mind automatically!|`|QmvYGkNJaa	I don't like Aurora at all. Sorry, but I DO like Dawn. It's a very pretty name.|`|d6e11chxaa	When I hear Aurora, I think of the city in the Denver metro area. It's also referred to as Saudi Aurora. It's pretty ghetto!  There's also a town in Illinois named Aurora, but I don't know what that town's like. I also think of Sleeping Beauty.<br>  <br>  Dawn sounds dated to me. I would expect to see it on a lady in her mid thirties. It's certainly not a bad name, but not one I would use.|`|Yntg6ugZaa	When I hear Aurora, I think majestic, magical, beautiful, like the Aurora Borealis, or the Northern Lights.<br>  <br>  When I hear Dawn, I think bright, beautiful, calm, relaxing, sort of like the dawn.<br>  <br>  Just what I think. =)|`|2LB3bWdpaa	I think Aurora is pretty and i actually dont associate it with Sleeping Beauty when i hear it .  However, Dawn always makes me think of a girl from the Babysitter's Club books/movie, even after about 8-10 years lol. |`|fqRFFDbUaa	I like them but remember your child will hopefully be very sucessful adults, so would you like to hear. President Aurora Smith passed a law or Dr. Dawn will be with you soon. Or Miss Aurora i dont understand this problem|`|decbee83e79c8ae5e31d1a89e0cdf3beaa	Dawn reminds me of an old lady who is very proper in her speech.<br>  whilst aurora reminds me of sleeping beauty, but it also reminds of someone who has exquisite beauty. <br>  xxx|`|yv94euDBaa	I hate Dawn. But Aurora is pretty. I do think of Sleeping Beauty though.<br>  <br>  Maybe Aurelia instead.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Aurora reminds just makes me think VERY quiet and shy. Not very outgoing for some reason. But they are pretty names.
VJcypcIhaa	Stress would definitely screw with your body's rhythm. To make yourself feel a little less stressed about it, what would be the harm in taking a home pregnancy test just to be sure?<br>  <br>  I'm sure it'd put you more at ease.<br>  <br>  Hope things get less stressful :)|`|175061f78daa0acce0c1ddee4462560caa	Stress maybe.. but I've never been THAT stressed for it to effect my period. Idk if that's even true!<br>  <br>  Have you ever had sex w/o a condom? Even if there was no ejaculation inside you? B/c that is till possible to cause pregnancy.|`|3b17edd3b4e73692d332dda278331c47aa	It is probably just stress especially if your practicing safe sex. You could take a pregnancy just to ease your mind. |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	You could be pregnant because condoms aren't 100% effective. If you think you are you should take a test. It could be stress as well though. Good luck!!!
miPubuDYaa	Not the month i got pregnant but the month before i stop taking the pill. Voila 6 weeks later i was pregnant!<br>  <br>  BTW i too was on vacation when i concieved|`|NvoHMxQcaa	Well first, I found out when I ovulated. Then I made sure to time intercourse around a week before that, and had it everyday or at the least every other day. But especially the day before ovulation and day of. Also, every time we had sex, I would make sure to do the missionary position (man on top). After intercourse was over, i would never get up and start walking around or go to the restroom. I would always put a pillow or two under my butt so my hips were elevated and I would stay like that for about 20-25 minutes.<br>  All of this worked for me. And I got pregnant the first time!<br>  <br>  Good luck! Baby dust!|`|mTyu7CKoaa	After intercourse (i always made my husband be on top when we were trying to conceive) I would instantly put a few pillows under my butt, and hold my legs to my chest... Im sure it looked silly but it worked|`|eU5Eth2aaa	The only thing my husband and I did differently was to not use protection!  And it worked!  We didn't want to stress about trying so we just did what we would always do, but this time without protection.|`|qBFojHLMaa	we did, but not purposely, we both by chance had the big 'O' at the same time. Dont know if that helped, but a month later we found out we were pregnant.|`|X1ACfL8eaa	We were on vacation when we conceived. If you read a couple questions down from yours you'll see that many people conceived while on vacation, maybe try that!|`|RduAWmLBaa	After having sex my husband would lay on top of me 4 a few minutes b4 pulling out. and then i would lay on my bed with my legs up in the air against the wall for a little while seems to work ha ha good luck!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I was put on clomid that month and I also used the clearblue easy fertility monitor! The monitor is really nice because it tells you exactly when you're ovulating and the days leading up to ovulation!|`|hCvEbRYWaa	Yes, I used Preseed. That stuff is amazing. I'll swear by it!|`|44PnMUCLaa	Yup, we used Pre Seed.
AA11036437	You would have no idea you were miscarrying until your were in the later stages of the miscarriage. Had you not have seen the Dr for an ultrasound at 8 weeks you would have started bleeding and lost the baby anyway (like you did) It takes the body a bit of time to recognise the pregnancy is not viable.<br>  <br>  In my first pregnancy I started bleeding lightly at 7 weeks and was told to take bed rest which I did. I had an ultrasound at 9 weeks and they said it was only measuring 5 weeks. I miscarried at 10 weeks.<br>  <br>  My second pregnancy resulted in identical twins!<br>  <br>  My 3rd Pregnancy I went for an ultrasound at 9 weeks and they said that there was no heartbeat. I had to have a d&c, if I hadn't of had a d&c I would probably miscarried within a week or so.<br>  <br>  The risk of miscarriage is higher in the first 12 weeks so even if they scanned you sooner say at 6 or 7 weeks you could still miscarry. That is why they don't scan you sooner. Unfortunately a miscarriage is mother natures way of saying the pregnancy was not viable.<br>  <br>  Every miscarriage is different. The first time I knew I was going to miscarry. The second time it was a complete shock at the ultrasound to find I had suffered a missed miscarriage.<br>  <br>  The best thing to do is try and relax and take good care of yourself (easier said than done) I know how you are feeling. I am just into my 4th pregnancy (5 weeks) I will see my Dr next week for a referral for an ultrasound which I will have at around 9-12 weeks. Every little twinge I get I'm worrying and I keep going to the toilet all the time checking I'm not bleeding! I feel that I can't relax and enjoy being pregnant until I know everything is ok. But only time will tell, so until then fingers crossed.<br>  <br>  Good Luck with yours! I will keep everything crossed for you too! If you ever need a chat you can email me of get me on yahoo messenger.|`|PN7ELn3aaa	I'm sorry to hear about your loss. <br>  <br>  Don't worry, a lot of doctor's won't see you until 8-10 weeks just because there is very little they can do to see how the baby is going before that. <br>  <br>  A "missed abortion" refers to a miscarriage that is "missed" by the mother. Unfortunately, they are not that uncommon as far as miscarriages go. <br>  <br>  Most of the time a mother will realize when she is miscarrying because there is symptoms that go along with it like cramping and bleeding.<br>  <br>  Try not to worry about miscarriage and enjoy your pregnancy! I wish you the best of luck.|`|xIowgWL7aa	I would think that given your history, your doctor would want to see you well before 10 weeks to at least do a blood test to check on your hormone levels or do an early ultrasound just to be on the safe side.<br>  <br>  Maybe you should seriously think about finding another doctor, one will understand your concerns. Pregnancy after a loss can make you a little crazy since you think that every cramp, every twinge and even the lightest spotting could be a sign of another miscarriage. <br>  <br>  Please think about seeing another doctor, even if it is just for blood work to ease your mind.<br>  |`|USAqDvv2aa	i have also been through a missed miscarriage. i went for our first scan at 12 weeks and the baby had stopped growing at about 8 and a half weeks. i have been told that when i fall again we can go to the doc and ask to be refured to the early pregnancy clinic. they would give a scan for no reason apart from peace of mind. im sure all will be ok. i know it must be terrifing but just relax! all the best! ****|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It all depends on your body. I'm sure your baby is fine though. Just keep positive. It will go by really fast and before you know it you will see your baby and all your worries will fade away. Good luck and Congrats!
qe0RNp7xaa	Today.|`|E2h4QuxKaa	When you find a doctor, they will usually schedule right away and let you know what to do from there.  They are going to want to get you on some vitamins right away and make sure of how far along you are and all that fun stuff.|`|phwivaqNaa	Doctors wont normally see you until about 7-8 weeks, unless you are bleeding or having a problem.<br>  <br>  That is when the heartbeat is picked up and they cant do very much before that point.|`|9hrJfhIIaa	My OB/GYN had me come in when I was about 6 weeks for an initial work-up, transvaginal sono at 8 weeks 2 days, and I had my second visit at 12 weeks and 5 days.|`|oXzHvsBpaa	I wasn't seen till I was 8 weeks along. It depends on the doctor though. Some wait and some want to see you right away.|`|eHjk9di0aa	As soon as you find out you are pregnant. Start taking prenatal vitamin if you aren't already.|`|eU5Eth2aaa	I went in for my first appointment right after I got that BFP!  I was between 5 & 6 weeks pregnant..|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	They usually try to schedule you around 7 or 8 weeks. If you tell them you don't know when your last period was they'll usually do an ultrasound. that's how I got one at the beginning!|`|7ZsvzIP7aa	Usually they will want to see you when you are around 8 weeks. Even before you go to the doctor, get some prenatal vitamins and start taking those if you haven't already. Congrats on the pregnancy!!|`|d3f01e98de2e5c51674e288f380af4d6aa	They usually won't schedule you until you are anywhere from 6 to 10 week. Find a doctor soon because OB appointments fill up fast.|`|6GUBvoGYaa	I had my first appt at 5 weeks and 1 days and my second when i was 6 weeks and 4 days so we could hear the heart beat. you should make an appt soon.|`|qRwjtaNbaa	You should go as soon as you can. Pre-natal care is very important.|`|i4zN7Kyyaa	you should go NOW you shouldve gone as soon as you found out you were pregnant!!|`|ttrA4TiRaa	its good to try and contact a docter whenever you first find out. good luck with the search of a obgyn|`|J2tmtqikaa	go to the doctors straight away get iron tablets but you will see the midwife when you are 8 weeks then scan at 12 weeks
TTvHeUKHaa	That sounds just like me and yes I was pregnant!<br>  |`|86317b487f4728e8a25bb23708d9b96eaa	It really is too early to tell, it's possible though.  But I'd wait until you miss your next period, then do the test, its too early for these tests to be 100% accurate.|`|RqZOTRuraa	Well.. sounds like it COULD be symptoms but you won't know for sure until you take a test, good luck!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Those are all symptoms. Chances are you are pregnant! Congrats!|`|6d6GHChPaa	Sounds like you could be pregnant. This early on the symptoms are more minor (like maybe what you are mentioning) and until your period and you can test there is no way to know for sure. But I am guessing you are.|`|1de8bb03424117a574ddcd8dbec13a8faa	i wouldn't wait until monday to find out the sooner you find out the better.
nsBbUnm7aa	Yes.. just go buy a test and get rid of any anxiety that you may be feeling.  Could be negative and you start the next day just having the pressure off.  GOOD LUCK.|`|CJ3XHvIDaa	well then you might as well be pregnant but you need to go get a test done to make sure.|`|AA10826403	um yeah you could be, but are you sure your not making up symptoms because your nervous that you could be pregnant? Why don't ppl get a pregnancy test or go to their doctors anymore? That is the only way you are going to get a straight answer, we aren't going to know anymore than you are telling us, so come on and do us a favor go to the doctors.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Yes. You should take a pregnancy test and schedule an appointment with your doctor.|`|PhGV5d2jaa	Take a HPT or go see your doctor. We don't know anymore than you do.|`|lxQQ7JZyaa	IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU MIGHT BE PREGNANT. I WOULD HAVE TAKEN A TEST WHEN I WAS 2-3 WEEKS LATE. GO TAKE A TEST FIND OUT FOR SURE AND GO FROM THERE.|`|wOJpb0ZGaa	Sounds like you could be. Take a test thats the only way you'll know for sure.|`|Ow8q6ytAaa	Time to pee on stick.|`|xvH98hWuaa	Yes u could be pregnant, just go and take a test and u will know for sure.
ItG88e6iaa	You will have to wait a few wks to find out...most likely until your next period if you just got off your period not to long ago and had unprotected sex on monday chances are pretty high that you will become preggo.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Unfortunetly you are going to have to wait a few weeks to find out. |`|Avusjoojaa	you will have to wait a coouple weeks to find that out.|`|hJwheleJaa	You have to wait at least a week after your missed period. Then you should take a test. However, don't test too early or you might get a false negative!|`|e1adb1e6bf7618d36ecfea10a335a315aa	Wait two weeks and take a digital First Response test. 
mFQydvncaa	wow, i am huge now at 18 weeks. with my first i showed at 3 months and with this one i started at 11 weeks|`|YmEGCGtnaa	i didnt really "pop" til 25 weeks...but ppl at work etc started asking me if were expecting around 20 weeks. but didnt get the annoying questions from strangers (boy/girl? when are you due? etc) from strangers til 25 weeks. in other words i wasnt so visibly pregnant til 25 weeks.<br>  and i am very petite---5'2 and weighing 100 lbs before pregnancy so that didnt show true for me, the smaller you are the sooner you show, personally it seems to be the exact opposite.|`|uuHPneEcaa	I started popping around my 5th month.. my baby's grandfather went out of town on November 25th when he came back December 8th I was BIG AS HELL! all women are different. I weighed 128ibs before I got pregnant now I am at 158.. So yeah|`|G94NlpZ0aa	Depends on the person.<br>  I had a little bump at 19 weeks. <br>  Then alittle bigger at 22 weeks.<br>  and now I'm at 26 weeks and feel huge. lol<br>  but i've only gained about 8 pounds so far.<br>  <br>  Doc says to gain 3 pounds a month for the rest of my pregnancy.|`|nCKdkYSyaa	I was around 24-25 weeks when i finally started to look pregnant. I am also 5'4'' and about 118 lbs <br>  <br>  Heres me at 24 weeks, i was tiny compared to some women! lol<br>  <a href="http://s228.photobucket.com/albums/ee246/robandtiff2005/?action=view&current=24wkspic3.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://s228.photobucket.com/albums/ee246...</a>|`|AA12380496	I was about four months along when i began to show!!|`|FNjUT8n4aa	im 5' 6" and weighed 113 lbs and i got my bump at  22 weeks.|`|dxTwHB1yaa	If you're talking about your belly button, that never happened to me.<br>  <br>  But if you're taking about showing, I'd have to say you really noticed it about five months along.|`|no9N3zjMaa	I didn't show till I was 5 months. At 18weeks the baby is still pretty tiny only about 5 inches<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.babycenter.com/6_your-pregnancy-18-weeks_1107.bc?intcmp=timeline" rel="nofollow">http://www.babycenter.com/6_your-pregnan...</a>|`|yPNvecc7aa	I was around 20 weeks when it became noticeable to my family.

You are nearly there!<br>  : )|`|6yy0jtzDaa	i had a small belly at 18 weeks but when i hit 22 weeks i popped lol it was just there one day don't worry you will get your belly|`|iMY2fgYdaa	I didn't show until I was almost 6mos...I just looked pudgy..it takes longer to show on your first baby because your muscles will hold up longer..when you have your second you should pop out much much faster|`|AA11538461	I started showing at seven weeks.|`|84b26tbzaa	during my first pregnancy i didny pop until i was 6 months now im pregnant with my second and at 15 weeks im showing|`|xPfJG3FGaa	nobody could tell i was pregnant til i was 6 months!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I'm 21 and am also 5"4'. Before I got pregnant I weighed about 100 lbs and I started actually "showing" at about 18 weeks. Everyone is different though. I'm sure you'll pop soon. And just wait before you know it your belly will just start doubling in size over night. Congratulations!|`|2ObqoJbKaa	Im 13 weeks pregnant, and I show a little. I got a little round belly that sticks out a little. Everyone's different though, and shows at different times.|`|9bcd0af449bde02dc1f98498d7b11d88aa	I was about six months when I really started showing- with this one and with my first. Congrats and enjoy the cute little belly. I'm 81/2 mos and am starting to wish it was detachable-LOL.
uuHPneEcaa	ur only a month pregnant. its just morning sickness. I felt the same way nothing is wrong. I am now 27 1/2 weeks pregnant with a lil boy. and everything is fine with him. U could talk to ur doctor and see if there is a pill u can take for it.<br>  <br>  and i was only 5 days late on my period when i took my pregnancy test and it came out positive. I was only 3 weeks when I found out I was pregnant.|`|phwivaqNaa	It's morning sickness.  If it is really bad, your doctor can prescribe something for nausea.  Dont let you stomach get empty.<br>  <br>  Are you sure you are only a month?  A pregnancy test cant even detect it until your missed period and you would be barley a month at that time.|`|2ObqoJbKaa	Its a normal part of pregnancy for some women. In early pregnancy I had alot of stomach cramping and pain. and the doctors said that its normal. Its just the uterus stretching and getting ready for baby. I also in the beginning was extrememly tired all the time. Don't worry your fine. IF the pain is just horribly unbearable, maybe you should talk to your doctor about it then. but its normal to feel discomfort in your stomach right away. Talk to your doctor though, it'll make you feel better. good luck.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It's completely normal. You can always try preggo pops. They helped me a lot. You can get them online or even at Motherhood Maternity. Good luck and Congrats!
UFYjEKVqaa	I took one with my first child and i loved it I learned a lot, how the birth process works, a fathers role in the birth, how to handle pain & idiot nurses... But there are some classes that are STUPID ( like a previous poster had mentioned.. imagine yourself in the womb!?!?! Silly!)<br>  I tried to take one with my 2nd and it was one of those stupid/silly classes so I quit going.<br>  <br>  If it is a Lamaze class then I would highly recommend going and sticking with it.|`|frvbZ6auaa	I took a class with my first, and it wasn't really beneficial. They showed videos and talked, and that was pretty much it. One thing they did do was teach you pain coping techniques, but I had forgotten all of them by the time delivery came around. The best part of it was getting to tour the birthing center where I would be having my baby. It was nice to see everything they had available and what they would do if something unexpected were to happen. We also preregistered and filled out all the admission paperwork so we didn't have to worry about all that when I went into labor. But, every class is different and yours may be very beneficial to you, I just didn't like most of mine. It was like sex ed all over again, just with the emphasis on birthing. Best of luck!!|`|tivpa7Vlaa	yes i just got done with my classed. i believed it helped alot..especially for my hubby it gave him an insite on what i will be going thru. girl honestly u will forget all about the techniques once the pain set in so have your birthing partner go with u so he/she can refresh your memory when u r in labor.|`|y6g0RnuAaa	I went to one and it was nice. They pretty much told me things I already knew from reading books and searching online. It made me feel more confident and reinforced the things I had already learned. <br>  I have a DVD called "Laugh and Learn about Childbirth" which was pretty cool but it only covered topics you would need during prelabor and while in the hospital. Most of those classes will cover  breast feeding, formula feeding and caring for your newborn too. If you feel unsure, you should go. If you'd like the DVD, let me know- it is just collecting dust.|`|en5e64Puaa	I was hoping me and my hubby could sign up for one, but we are too late do to one.  My hosiptal does offer saturday classes but my hubby works on saturdays.  <br>  <br>  I think it's helpful if your partner can go with you so that way they know what is going on.  <br>  <br>  I think is what i'm going to do so I can prepare my hubby is watch videos on youtube and on some other websites.  <br>  <br>  This is our first :)|`|NroZQN5vaa	I went to the hospital's class. It was kind of stupid. We spent like 30 minutes trying to picture ourselves in our wombs. "Feel how warm it is. Hear your heart beat. Swim in the fluids..." Crazy. I think it was a waste of time when I could have been reading about actually giving birth, not picturing how happy my daughter was inside me. It was a waste for me, but you might have better luck. Either way, it won't hurt to go!|`|GjuRYsITaa	i went to 1 with my first found it boring so didn't go back |`|5OQLmECTaa	yes it is helping!!  i went last week and last night and next week we get to take a tour of the labor and delivery room and the nursery.  then i have 2 more classes about infant care after that.<br>  <br>  although alot of the terms they use i already know about and didn't learn too much b/c i've been on here asking questions and reading books, it has helped me be more calm about everything.<br>  last night they showed us the actual stuff they use in the epidural, and how it is placed and a video of how it is done, and i am not as scared to get one.  i actually got to hold the part that goes into me, and it doesn't seem that bad.  we watched a video last night too but i think it may have scared my husband a little.  lol|`|Fm3L8vsYaa	not sure what type of class your will be but im taking a 3 weeks prenatal class. we went over both types of delivery and what could go wrong and what they do for everything. they went over all hospital policies and what to do from the moment you arrive until you are discharged. we toured the maternity unit and the nursery and postpardum room and next week weare learning about newborn care and practicing diaper changes and all that stuff.<br>  <br>  |`|AA11538461	I took classes at the birth center.  We used the Bradley method.  It was a tremendous help.  I would have reacted in the wrong way otherwise.  It did not come natural for me to know what to do.  I had to practice daily for several months to learn how.  |`|1PP6YfUZaa	I went to my first one and never bothered with the rest. My BF has gone a son from a previous relationship so i hope we will be ok none of my freinds or family bothered either x <br>  <br>  edit: this website has helped me more with my pregnancy then any midwife or classes x|`|EpfVsCa2aa	I never did with my 3 kids and i done good in labor and delivery, but some people want to, so they will know what its like when they go in labor, good luck|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I am taking lamaze and a baby care class next month.|`|fPX1lD8uaa	I never took a class, and I did fine.  |`|fvmKx667aa	After being told its worthless and I shouldnt bother, I still took the classes. Even if I forget how to breathe when it comes down to it I learned a lot. I learned that at the first sign of a contraction I dont need to go to the hospital, why not labor at home where I am comfortable. Then when contractions get at least 5 minutes apart or my water breaks go in. I feel more comfortable knowing the process the baby goes through to come out. They teach you about all your pain medication options available to you. Yeah they show you a cou ple crappy videos and do some silly stuff but its fun and you meet new people. She also has your partner give you massages which is always a plus. My boyfriend feels a little more comfortable about the whole experience now that we finished the class, thats the biggest plus.|`|JgPmFXDDaa	My husband and I signed up for a class since this is our first baby and we wanted to make sure that we could be as prepared as possible.  The classes weren't really all that informative and some of the things that were suggested have to be taken with a grain of salt realizing that every baby is different and not all techniques will work for all babies.  We are glad we took the course, we ended up learning a few interesting things and it helped us feel more prepared as a couple.  I don't think that with any of our future pregnancies we will take the course again but it was nice to take it for the first.|`|BEP4GRORaa	I took a 2 day class 6 years ago when I was expecting my son.I learned a lot and it was so exciting to to be around other expectant mothers. I don't think I got the breathing part down right because it did not work for me. But I was induced so I can't say it would've worked if I hadn't. On the last day of the class I remember it was almost over when I started to get contractions that were coming every 3 minutes apart. Luckily, the place where the classes where being held was in the hospital's women's center where I was having my son. I went into preterm labor that day and I was given a pill to stop the contractions and then had to be given a shot to stop them. Finally the shot worked. I was 34 weeks when that happened. I was glad I was so close to the hospital when that happened. It was helpful to me. I am so happy we took those classes my boyfriend and I.<br>  <br>  Good Luck and best wishes|`|NqK0VX3kaa	i took the class. it helps alot because they tell you what to expect and some things they will be using during labor. also they give you a bunch of free stuff like parenting magazines and free samples and such. it was a big help for me and my husband cause it gives your coach plenty of information to help you during your labor.|`|gv926jZ0aa	It wasn't too bad. I thought I was going to be embarrassed, but you learn a little at least.
o2ehEqinaa	I'm also 16 weeks pregnant and still no changes in my boobs yet.  My friend's boobs have grown 2 cup sizes and she's 20 weeks along.  Everyone's different I guess.<br>  Congrats on your pregnancy!|`|9Gc18dVAaa	I am also 16 weeks, due May 1:)  Congrats!  My breasts have gotten more noticeable veins, but have not gotten any larger ,this is my fifth but I am not sure if that makes a difference.  They are firmer however, and my nipples are darker.  I would not worry about it, you should be just fine.  You should expect colostrum around 36-40 weeks, but some women do not get any leaking until after birth.  Good luck!!!|`|RdhSERbraa	I am 38 weeks pregnant and my boobs haven't gotten any bigger either. My nipples on the other hand have gotten huge. My boobs were very tender at the beginning and now if anything is sensitive it is my nipples. Especially if it is cold out. Other than that I haven't experienced anything else boob related. LOL|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	My boobs haven't really hurt at all throughout my pregnancy and I'm 20 weeks. Now my boobs did go up an entire cup size already though but they were only a 36C pre-pregnancy, so no where near your size. Now my nipples have hurt the entire time. Mine haven't got veiny or anything like that either. Some people just change in different ways.|`|dL4t09IVaa	Mine haven't changed but I'm still nursing my 16 month old. If you're already big then you're probably not going to notice that much change. No worries! Everyone is different. And colostrum usually comes (if it comes for you, doesn't for everyone) around 6 months I think... that's average.|`|iwYu32N2aa	hmm mind you that everyone s different. I have not seen any veins come about yet for me. Mine have gotton bigger. But not to be rude but do you want your boobs to get bigger? Think about the major back pain you will have once your belly gets bigger.<br>   Best of Luck|`|yrDqtazLaa	Mine didn't either, if I laid on them wrong they would hurt, but other than that, no changes. After I had my babies, though, they got HUGE.
ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I am 21 weeks and I kinda have what you're talking about. I don't really know what weight plays in it because I weigh 117. When I lay flat it is easy to feel her but when I stand up I don't feel her as much. I would call your doctor just in case but I'm sure it's just the baby. Good luck|`|kcGFK36Waa	I think its just the baby putting pressure down there. Trust me as the baby gets bigger the pressure will be worse!! But that's not 1/2 as bad as when they press on your ribs! Gosh that hurts really bad!!! |`|xeS8pUfbaa	because of your weight i doubt that you are feeling the baby. when you are over weight you dont feel the baby till you are about 24-25 weeks is what my DR told me
kOowil7haa	Actually, I can see what your friends are saying because you're kind of rounded higher up in the belly than you'd expect from just being a little heavy.  You look good!  <br>  <br>  This is my second baby but I got that high-up bump really early.  When I laid down on my back it flattened out - does that happen for you? That's how I knew it wasn't just "bloating", it was the muscles and skin relaxing to make room for the baby, even though the uterus was still small. <br>  <br>  Everyone's different for how/when they show. Congrats!|`|uTmUu3s1aa	Your uterus is still hiding beneath your pubic bone, so any roundness that they are seeing is bloating.   ONce you're closer to 12 weeks and beyond your uterus will start to rise above your pubic bone.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It's totally possible that you are showing. Everyone is different. Congrats.|`|mVD3TQkFaa	No you are not showing. |`|rDPADat1aa	When I went to your myspace profile, it said you had it set to private so no one other than your friends could see it.  So that isn't going to work.  Oops, never mind, I see you mean the profile picture.  Duh on me. :D<br>  <br>  As far as whether or not you're showing yet, you probably aren't showing very much yet if at all but you may look different as pregnancy affects your body in many different ways.  Plus, the showing may also be from bloating which is very common in early pregnancy.  Give it another month or two and you'll likely be showing a little more.<br>  <br>  Good luck and congrats on the baby!|`|mBeGdFO2aa	I wasn't 'showing' but my hips and waist got *much* wider, so much that I couldn't wear my regular clothes :)
3URupc7caa	yeah they said that to me at my first scan and dated me 2 weeks behind what i actually thought i was..and i didnt get a picture either but when i went 2 weeks later for my next scan everything was ok and the baby was measuring normal size..i also got some piccies :D<br>  Im sure it will be the same for you :D Good luck :) x|`|VEEbzc4jaa	Wouldnt give you one?...........or were you unaware you had to buy it. They should give you one really but i know there not free anymore.<br>  <br>  Scans are great arent they! I havent seen my baby for 10 weeks now as ive had my last scan and im sooooo eggar to go and pay for another one just for that special moment you feel when you see them. x|`|uVuYdcRcaa	Hi,<br>  <br>   No, they usually allow you to have a picture! That seems to be a bit unfair.<br>  <br>   When you go for your next scan in 2 weeks ask for a scan picture - it YOUR baby so they should allow it!<br>  <br>  Lx|`|RW3SzwINaa	you should get the picture.. and congratulations!!|`|3a8c03abddba3f41c749843651814e92aa	How far along are you?|`|SndrZbn8aa	They wouldn't give you a picture? wth That doesn't make sense. I have heard that certain practices won't give out pictures. You should give them a ring and find out if this is the case in their practice. If not, and they refuse a pic at the next appointment find out exactly what their reason is then don't take no for an answer! <br>  <br>  They're saying your baby is small based on how far along you are and how fast the baby should be developing. Hopefully at your next sonogram they can gather some more information about how fast it's growing. It's fairly common to find that the baby isn't as big as what they consider average or even bigger.|`|iQZhxehuaa	On my 1st pregnancy I had to go back for a second scan and the sonographer didn't give us a picture of the 1st scan either. She did try but my daughter was not in a good position, so she suggested that as we are going back for another scan to wait until then for a picture. Ask for 1 at your next scan.<br>  I know the excitement you are going through (making me broody again!!)Congratulations!!|`|0eqfW0ASaa	i do to|`|BXMHgiK5aa	No normally they allow you to buy a picture.<br>  <br>  Congrats.|`|WFVWKOtgaa	Maybe if you early on.<br>  they think there no point if its smallx.|`|ioZeveazaa	No that is not normal. They should have atleast given you one picture.
qicxk5GMaa	my first appt was at 10 wks and they did do an ultrasound.  They also did a full pap smear.  the ultrasound they did was vaginal... and I got my first picture... I could make out the head, body and 2 little circles that are the arms.  |`|TQW5E6olaa	I had a vaginal ultrasound at 8 weeks to confirm my pregnancy, i guess that would be considered my first appt...<br>  <br>  It depends on your insuranc also, some specify hoe many you can have, i had 10 total|`|vue9NOhYaa	Probably not. Unless there are questions about your dates or concerns about the progress of your pregnancy.|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	It all depends on your doc and your insurance.<br>  <br>  My first visit was at 11 weeks and they did do an u/s.<br>  <br>  If you do get one, it is very exciting to see for the first time...we watched our little one wiggle and arm and do a jump!|`|en5e64Puaa	I think it depends on your doctor.  My doctor did one on my first appointment to see how far along I was (even though I knew when my last period was) and then did another one at 20 weeks.   So it's possible. :)<br>  <br>  Good luck and Congrats!!!|`|EHY3FnAmaa	I had a quick sonogram done at my first appointment but they may not offer it unless you ask!<br>  Good Luck!|`|kcGFK36Waa	About 2 weeks after your first appt. |`|fvmKx667aa	You might, it depends on your Dr. Some dont do them in office so will send you somewhere in the next week. I didnt get one at my first appointment with my Dr, but I was about 8 weeks. I got my first at 12 weeks, so you might. |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	The only time they really do an ultrasound is if you don't know how far along you are so they'll do one to determine a due date. If they don't do one today then you probably wont get one until 20 weeks. Congrats!|`|18b1c2fa1b37397b38c8345df8858955aa	I had an ultrasound done when I was 9 weeks only because I wasn't sure of my LMP. Some doctors will have an ultrasound done to make sure that everything is ok.|`|SXJg28Hlaa	My app is tomorrow(6 weeks)....And I dont think I will get a u/s... or maybe yes,because for the time I think I have,my belly is growing too fast....<br>  <br>  Congratulations!!!!|`|445676ee4ba9ef6e5bd44f0f3b9d7501aa	That depends on your doctor.<br>  <br>  At 11 weeks, I was at my 2nd appointment, and yes, I did get an ultrasound.|`|3cxwalh0aa	It depends on the doctor. Some will do it, some will wait until your 20-week appointment. Good luck! :)|`|AA12226266	some dr's do some wait a little more it all depends on you ob 
QW4V0UhRaa	Honestly, don't worry.<br>  <br>  Many women even choose to smoke pot during their pregnancy since it alleviates discomfort, pain, and morning sickness.<br>  <br>  Of course there are health effects associated with this, but you'd have to be doing it on a regular basis over the pregnancy period in order to actually after the baby.<br>  What would then happen, is that the child would be at an increased risk of hyperactivity , and they may have problems focusing and solving problems.<br>  Heavy smokers can give birth to children with a higher risk of leukemia.<br>  <br>  However, as you're most definitely NOT a heavy smoker, you have no cause for concern.<br>  You should let your doctor know just to be on the safe side, but stop worrying. That's definitely not very good for the baby.|`|CUMdhfKzaa	I think the worrying about it is more damaging than the actual incident.  At least dope is natural.  Some people drink alcohol when pregnant, and that's got to be worse.|`|v3IobQCgaa	If I were you:<br>  <br>  I'd get checked out by my doctor just to be sure... and then seriously re-assess what kind of people I hang around with, and who I maybe should dump from my life before my baby gets here.|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	Not that I would recommend it to anyone, but I know someone who smoked a joint a day during pregnancy and had no worries. In fact, her doctor told her it was ok to do so (but this was in another country!). I don't agree with it or anything, but if she got the ok for a joint a day, a couple of brownies won't hurt. You should definitely mention it to your doctor though.<br>  I'd also be pretty pissed off with whoever served them - they should have told you exactly what it was before you ate it.|`|WQR0KEqZaa	I think your baby will be ok as it was a one off, i hope you have told your friends what you think off them who lets people eat them cakes without telling people what they are first??<br>  When you go to your first anti natal mention it to your midwife and explain what happened, but try not to worry, some people take alot worse and all turns out well. good luck.|`|AA10937078	Oh barf!<br>  <br>  The THC in "brownies" is not as strong as it is when you smoke the weed.<br>  Did you feel weird after eating them?<br>  <br>  Consult with your doctor.  I'm pretty sure you'll be okay.<br>  <br>  Pick some better quality of friends.  Clean and sober friends would be a better choice!|`|AA11131747	You need to tell your doctor what happened.|`|qqiVKUBpaa	You'll be fine, pot is pretty harmless. It would probably hurt the baby more if your friends were smoking cigarettes around you. But call your doctor first thing and let him/her know what happened. I completely understand how you feel though, I would have worried myself sick over eating something like that pregnant. I agree you should reevaluate your friends though. Anyone who would intentionally feed a pregnant woman pot brownies does not seem like a good friend.|`|c9NuCZnaaa	the best you can do is get to a doctor as SOON AS POSSIBLE. it may not have harmed your baby but there is still a slim chance that there could be something wrong. better to be safe than sorry. just keep calm and good luck with your pregnancy|`|H0fXySX9aa	A lot of prescription drugs now a days have some form of hard drug i them in  a low dose.<br>  i would contact your doc but to be honest its not like smoking the drug did you feel ok after wards and cooking does get rid of a lot of it.<br>  |`|VEi3R0craa	call your dr and talk to them.  if it was me I would report them they put your baby at risk this is the stage that all the important things are forming.|`|D4Jr9gvbaa	and who know's what else they were laced with, call your doctor as soon as possible. This is about the health of YOU and your child.|`|7tbdtMWTaa	just ring your doctor for advice..|`|B1CfeLu9aa	tell your doctor - but i think you'll be fine don't worry|`|3nKKxjy0aa	I'd go to your doctor but while i was pregnant (before i found out i was pregnant) i smoked it a lot (i was young) and the doctor said that it didn't damage her in any way (thank god)<br>  <br>  p.s i was 5 month gone before i knew<br>  <br>  EDIT: whoever said weed brownies taste awful, that's because your a terrible baker then cos i make them a lot (for friends birthdays or as a treat when mum watches my kid)( and if done properly they taste just as good as any other brownie without having a lack of weed<br>  <br>  EDIT EDIT: for those saying pot is halmless, if you don't already know theres WEED and SKUNK, skunk is the one that causes all the problems (mental health etc) and has weed is really expensive in most places now it'd mostg likely have been skunk in the brownie (it also tastes better cooked than weed)|`|PRaS1leGaa	Tell your Doctor immediately and see What he or she can do about it. I totally believe you didn't eat them on purpose. Even if you did( I doubt you did since your pregnant) drugs can cause miscarriage, premature babies, and even possible diseases of some kind later in life. I know this because I was a premature baby because my birth mom done drugs. She also had a miscarriage 3 years before with a Little boy from taking drugs. A few years after I was born my birth mom had an "abortion" with twins by taking drugs. She didn't go to a doctor thought to have the abortion she did it herself by taking drugs.|`|448a85191a54cc7c72fb3006ad32edebaa	you will be fine and so will baby, thousands of women smoke dope every day of their  pregnancy and babies are fine. probably just made it sleep for like, a day, in future eat what you have prepared yourself. just goes to show that drugs are not used by hoodies in the ghetto, all walks of life participate in illegal substances, dont trust anyone where you and your babys health is concerned!|`|DUxXb722aa	you need to tell you doc what you told us here. dont worry about getting introuble, its the health of your baby and you.  it really depends on your body and not bodies are the same, so i woulod say you might be fine and so will the baby. just go tell your doc and i would really be pissed at the person who made those and didnt tell anyone. i herd those are more potnent than actually smoking the weed. |`|c62a95c6696d81427b76aa335ba9d509aa	I really don't think you have done any harm! I have a friend who had to smoke pot through out her whole pregnancy due to not being able to take her proper medication while pregnant, and her baby was born just fine! I would never ever suggest a woman does any type of drug while pregnant, but I don't think you have harmed your little one. Be sure to bring this up when you see your doctor next for piece of mind. Good luck and I hope you have a great pregnancy!|`|m6oc91sxaa	You are perfectly fine....there are people that smoke weed during their entire pregnancies and their babies come out just fine....There are people that smoke, drink, and do god knows what else the entire 9 months...<br>  <br>  I REALLY don't think this one time will affect anything...<br>  <br>  it really isn't worth getting stressed out over or contacting your doctor about it...cause then you're doctor is going to question you as to why you're associating with the people you're associating with and how you put yourself in that situation..<br>  <br>  its just not worth it...<br>  <br>  trust me on this|`|8JOl4OFNaa	you should be fine. before pot was illegal it was used to help women with menstrual cramps. also, consider the fact that people in other countries smoke it all the time and are just fine. its also better that you ate it rather then smoking it because if anything, just the smoke would be harmful|`|NYzeX4oiaa	 NO ADVISE ON SMOKING, DRINK LOTS OF WATER IT SHOULD FLUSH YOUR SYSTEM THE BABY SHOULD BE FINE JUST WATCH WHO YOU EAT FROM BECAUSE THERE ARE LOTS OF RECIPES OUT WORST THAN THAT ......GOOD LUCK CONGRATS!!!! |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I'm sure you are fine but I would discuss it with your doctor just to be on the safe side.

c48afdc3bf4b6c1c186518faf5e86417aa	This is my third, and I will be having an epidural again.  I choose to use it  because it really calms me during the strong labor and I'm able to enjoy the delivery.  Plus for me, even with the epidural I can still feel some pressure when the baby is about to come, so I still can feel when to push.  As for the baby "not being as alert" with meds, that's not true at all!  My babies came out with their eyes open wide and totally alert, and then they cried like crazy!  The epidural caused no problems whatsoever.  I can understand why some women don't want to use them though.  Some just want to go "natural" or they've heard horror stories about women having horrible spinal pain and headaches the rest of their lives from the epidural.  But as for me, I'm totally for them.|`|rlVHIKBdaa	I am going to have an epidural and only an epidural. I do not do well with pain and while I know going into it that it will be painful I believe that living in the 21st century negates the use of antiquated ideas and medicine. <br>  I will NOT get any opioid. Those are the meds that go into your bloodstream and affect the way you feel and can adversely affect the baby. Modern epidurals have almost no side effects for the mother or baby and can make the whole experience more relaxed and rewarding.|`|13ba52d1d8f776526728149760b05c93aa	I chose to have a completely natural childbirth this past July. For one, being induced with pitocin does speed up the contractions (which are definitely the worst part of labor and childbirth), but in some cases you may not dilate, which could lead to an emergency c-section. I see c-section as a major surgery, and would much prefer natural childbirth because complications can arise from surgery (and what if that wound opened or got infected? I shudder just thinking about it!). Of course sometimes it's necessary to have a c-section, but I think most doctors prefer to avoid that route unless medically necessary.<br>  <br>  Also, I chose not to have the epidural because it can often slow things down, and it doesn't always last through the entire birth. Furthermore, I didn't want to feel woozy or disoriented when my daughter was born. That, and I hate needles, and the thought of a needle inserted near my spine just scared me beyond belief. <br>  <br>  I would say the pain of natural childbirth was about an 8 on a scale of 10 (and I only say that because I had an episiotomy with no local anesthetic - otherwise it was about a 7). It really wasn't that bad, I promise. The contractions were the worst part, honestly. I wasn't medicated, and I healed much more quickly and I felt great. Some of the other mothers who were in the hospital at the same time as me felt awful after their epidurals (I felt really bad for them because I was able to enjoy my newborn and they were not feeling well at all). I felt happy and great afterward! I think it's a personal decision, but in all honesty, childbirth really isn't that bad. If you've ever had kidney or gallstones, that pain is FAR worse than childbirth IMO.|`|qerRhztsaa	I am neither avoiding medication nor am I going immediately ask for it; I plan to go into labor and see how it goes and if I just can't take the pain, then I will ask for medication.  Some women have easier labors than others, so if I can tough it out I probably will.  However, I am not at all opposed to medication if I need it.  I'm pregnant with my first so I'm not too sure what to expect!!  This may sound weird but part of me wants to experience the pain of childbirth.  My sister is in nursing school and tells me about women that feel absolutely zero pain, pressure, anything while giving birth, and that doesn't really seem right to me.|`|MnoiiKb4aa	I was in labor for over 24 hrs. HORRIBLE PAIN. I did get an epidural, which I did not feel at all. After I got the epidural, I felt much better! Later, the baby got stuck in my pelvis, and we had to do an emergency c-section because I began to run a fever. c/s was fine, and recovery was not as bad as many people (who have never even had a c/s) will tell you it is. I am pg w #2 and going strait for the c/s. I would not recommend going through labor without at least an epidural!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I want meds for sure but a lot of woman want to have it naturally like they did in the past. I can understand why they would but I know that I don't want to go through that type of pain unless I really have to.|`|oxxBmhV0aa	I'm going to try to go for natural..Because, if you go natural you're baby comes out drug-free and more alert (that's what I heard anyways) but, I'll probably give in and get meds..|`|XUR91zMeaa	i am going to have the epi. i am not good at all with pain. i faint when i feel strong pain so i would not be able to do it without. this is my first pregnancy. good luck to you all.|`|AwzkiUnsaa	Just to prove that they can do it without pain meds. They say it's safer, but eh, if an epidural wasn't safe then why are millions of women getting them. Me on the other hand... Contractions hurt, and they hurt really bad, and if I don't have to deal with the pain then I won't.|`|L2HodKQRaa	Natural. I want to have my baby faster and if you are on the meds it takes longer because your numbed out down there. That's what my doctor says anyway. |`|w4zjmhxoaa	I went all natural.  Here's why:<br>  <br>  You don't have to be confined to your bed (if you choose and epidural, you're stuck -- with a catheter)  Labor usually goes faster if you're able to walk around.  And you're able to go into the jacuzzi, which is soothing<br>  Without meds you're able to feel exactly when to push, which usually makes the pushing time less, and the tearing is less also.  You know when and how much to push, you do it when your body is ready and not when a midwife or doctor tells you to.<br>  You can actually feel the baby coming out, which is a really cool feeling.  <br>  You get the pain out of the way, and are able to be up walking around much sooner.  You don't have to wait for the epidural to wear off.  <br>  Babies tend to be more alert after a natural birth.<br>  It's what our bodies were meant to do!<br>  <br>  But it's a choice every woman will have to make for themselves!  Do whatever is going to be best for you!|`|32747dcd374c857319720ae0aa088b0faa	I had both of my kids natural, and if I had any more (not planning to) I would do it again. When I have had pain meds after surgeries, I hated them. For me, it is easier to deal with the pain than the way those things make me feel. Yes, I obviously needed the general anesthesia during the surgeries, but screw the meds afterwards. <br>  <br>  Childbirth is not a disease, it's a natural occurrence. Women were having babies for thousands of years before pain meds. I would hate to have cloudy memories of my children's births because of meds. I don't see anything horribly wrong with them if you they don't affect you that way though.|`|OLAtwLV6aa	well with my first I wanted to go Natural YEAH OKKKKKKAY what was I on...lol <br>  without meds labor doesn't go faster trust me I was in labor for about 17 hours before I begged for the EPI after another 4 hours I felt GREAT with that EPI No pain of course I didn't get to give birth because previously when my water broke she had a bowel movement inside me so I need a C section but with this one TRUST me I'm skipping the LABOR and going for the  C Section <br>  |`|f5udtuwBaa	im 37 weeks and im gonna try going natural this time. the first time the epidural just totally paralysed me and i was in labour for 18.5 hours and i want to be able to move around and not be so confined this time around. hope i can do it coz i am a whinger usually LOL|`|unaKa6thaa	Epidural!! I had one with my son and it was great! it did wear off by the time it came to push but i am going to try and wait a little longer to get it (if i can) and hopefully it won't wear off. Hopefully this one will be a little faster. No doubt i'm having the epidural.
mfYfeFCgaa	She should definitely NOT take aspirin or ibuprofen. Tylenol is fine, but for some people it just doesn't work. Tell her to try the Tylenol and if it doesn't give her relief, to talk to her doctor about it to see if she could get something else. It's always smart not to take any medicine during pregnancy until you discuss it with your OB, but some things are ok to take. I'm 14 weeks pregnant myself and I've had migraines most of my life. They've gotten a little better since I've been pregnant but not much and my doctor has ok'd me to continue taking the migraine medicine Maxalt that I was taking before, as long as I'm careful to use it sparingly, only when I really need to. Alot of people will try to say a pregnant woman shouldn't take anything more than a tylenol, but that''s just not always realistic. Most drugs are pregnancy class C, which means their effect on an unborn baby are not completely known and should only be taken if the benefits outweigh the risks. I know every woman wants to do everything possible to make sure her baby is safe and born healthy, but to do that she has to keep herself healthy and look out for her own welfare as well. Of course a certain amount of discomfort and inconvenience in pregnancy is expected, but you don't have to be in agony, that's not good for the baby either, because the added strain on the body can divert it's focus from incubating the baby the way it needs and being in severe pain can cause an increase in blood pressure and heart rate which can be unhealthy for the baby as well. Headaches are quite common in pregnancy and hot baths, ice packs, and a dark quiet room can be helpful, along with taking some tylenol. Some women have migraines for the first time in pregnancy and some meds are available that are relatively safe. If the tylenol doesn't help at all, she might ask the doctor about a mild narcotic like codeine or vicodin to help. Tell her to hang in there and just ask the doctor for ideas on the best way to treat her headaches.

ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I found out I was pregnant when I was 3 weeks pregnant so it is possible. The line was VERY faint though. Good luck. By a first response test. |`|ErCJnABBaa	While you don't HAVE to wait until a missed period to take an HPT, doing so will save you money in the long run.  Yes an HPT MIGHT give a BFP before AF is due.  But each month you only have about a 20% chance of getting pregnant, and that assumes you'd done the baby dance at the right time of the month.  So each month, you are MOST LIKELY to get a BFN.  Since you are likely to get a BFN, why not wait and give AF at least one shot at giving you that BFN for free.<br>  <br>  BTW, since you can only get pregnant when you ovulate, and since AF will arrive two weeks after ovulation (+/- a couple of days), waitig three weeks (when you know when AF is due)  is a none issue.  Doing the baby dance three weeks before AF is due is doing the baby dance too early to get you pregnant.  It has to be closer to the time that you ovulate.  Once you baby dance close enough to the time you ovulate, three weeks later will be AFTER AF is due.|`|RkFcl9rjaa	you can take it 5 days before or after missing your period.|`|IVNM1O5naa	you will get the most accurate results if you wait until you have missed your period. clear blue easy is the most accurate in my opinion.|`|B3Bp4gRaaa	there are some test that you can take 5days sooner but why waste your money if sometimes people still get their periods while it says positive..just wait those extra 5 days..more if youre irregular 
eHjk9di0aa	Probably not, the tenderness could just be caused by fluctuations in your hormones... you did miss two pills after the fact.<br>  <br>  But as the other posters noted, it is a possibility just a very small one|`|ErCJnABBaa	Whether you remembered your pill or not.  If you did the deed, there is always the possibility that you could be pregnant (remember, birth control is never 100%).<br>  <br>  All you can do is wait about a week, and if AF still has not shown, take another HPT.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It's always a possibility if you have unprotected sex. I would wait a week and test again if you are that worried.
f7a373eb7a994b57f8de966c9eb0968baa	I started showing around 14 weeks the first time and 16 weeks the second time, but it is different for every woman.  <br>  <br>  A lady came in my office the other day and she was 12 weeks, and I could see she had a little pooch.|`|e6ea3ab6207a414f0db0aee1dbf52b01aa	i am on number two and 11 weeks and you can sure tell already.|`|20197e178062d18611e09a43125664efaa	depends on your frame, and your metabolism, and your eating habits... some gain alot some nearly nothing... my experience is very nauseous, Acute reactions to particular odors like raw beef...lost it all the time!

YOu can still have a big tummy before that, but that's usually because of bloating from intestinal gas.|`|AA11559698	With my first viable pregnancy ( I've had 2 miscarriages ) I showed around 4 months, with THIS one, I'm almost 11 weeks, and showing already!  It's different for every woman, and every pregnancy.|`|aad31321a43cec235de461109e01a1e4aa	mine shows at 4|`|AA12089906	Generally with subsequent pregnancies you show sooner, probably because your uterus is used to expanding to make room for the baby.  If this is your first you may not show for awhile, but it depends on how you are carrying, your body frame, and your eating habits.  I gained more early on and less later in the pregnancy (28 lbs all together) and I was thin to begin with, so I showed fairly early, at about three months.  But each of my pregnant friends was different.  There isn't any real right or wrong answer, it's all about each person's body.
7HzfgRmwaa	Nope! I think boy!<br>  My little baby's was always that high and everyone said girl - but i have a healthy baby boy growing in me! <br>  Good Luck ;)<br>  <br>  EDIT*** Its not high! Its a good heart rate. Anything above 185 i believe is kinda on the high side. Either way sounds like you have a strong baby girl or boy in there :)|`|GeMenejZaa	no that is normal. and the heart rate isn't always the best way to tell. its 150 and up supposed to be a girl, but im having a girl and her heart rate was between 147-150 which is considered slow for a girl....so you never know|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I wouldn't go off of that just yet to determine the sex because as far as I know later on in the pregnancy the heart rate will start to get more regular. Right now I think because you are so early on that it's probably just fast. I'm not 100% on that though. Congrats|`|mVD3TQkFaa	Yes that can be normal it is on the high side but I was told that 140-180bpm is normal and it tends to be higher earlier in pregnancy. i'm having a girl and she has always been 150-155bpm but that is no way to determin sex. |`|50e0975b0e8c470ea8e974086f449b63aa	That early in pregnancy the heart beat will be a little high it will decrease as the baby gets bigger and not have to work as hard to help organs grow|`|kAdgwDFqaa	It's a myth but my baby's heartbeat was that high and she is a girl.  |`|uDPmazlxaa	in the first trimester the heartbeat is higher than later in pregnancy.  That is fine now, but most likely it will drop to 140-160.  Mine was that high at 10 weeks.  With my first, a girl, I am thinking she was aroun 155 most of the time. That isnt reliable (the heartrate prediction) because the heartbeat will be higher when they are moving than when sleeping.   |`|Kdv4Lomcaa	The earlier you are in your pregnancy, the higher the heart rate.  I would not use this as an indicator whether it is a girl or boy...at least not just yet, as the heart rate will likely have decreased by your next visit and will continue to decrease the further along you get.|`|kgSBcnRaaa	My babies heartbeat was in the low 180's at the beginning and now at 31 weeks it is in the low 140's.  It gets lower as the baby gets bigger and develops more.  The heartbeat myth did not work for me.  My baby had high heartbeats every appointment and I am having a boy.|`|xEh1pOsNaa	It is high.

Gas is your bodies reactions to the foods you are eating.  When you are pregant, your body digests much slower and processes food differently...the gas fills up your intestines in response and can either sit there or let loose.  I think its a bit easier to control bloating if you drink lots of water and try to eat less salty/fried foods.  The gas may be unavoidable.|`|hKYU7yxAaa	I think bloating can be gas or water that you are holding. maybe if you let some of the gas go your bloating will go down but it hasn't for me hehe|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Bloating is when you feel like your stomach is full of air and you look a little pudgy.|`|963a60ad2fe21d7cef6dc7185c595623aa	Gas can cause you to bloat, but so can water retention.  |`|1zj4Lz9Raa	It's pretty much the same thing...

Once they figured out that it was my eyesight I realised that I missed out on learning how to write properly in school.  I couldn't see the blackboard when we were being shown the letters.

I can do simple math, but no algebra, geometry, etc. I think they expect too much from kids these days. If she is being put under pressure and has the teacher standing over her all the time because her math skills are not good, they aren't going to get better. The teacher may be confusing her. Work with her at home for a short period each night. Don't work for more than 45 minutes. If you keep trying to explain you are just going to upset her and fry her brain trying to figure it out. She is only in 1st grade, give her some time.<br>  As for the headaches, sit down with her and ask HER what is really going on. Talk to her with no distractions and with no one else around.

As for math try fun games, there are great websites with  math games, flash cards, she's very good in reading maybe math just isn't her thing but she will come along.  As for her eyes, has she gone to an optometrist or is she just getting tested at school.  My son, now in 2nd grade, complained of similar problems as your daughter, but passed all eye exams at school.  I took him to a pediatric eye doctor and he has 2 lazy eyes and required glasses for school and watching TV.  I would get her checked out.  Good Luck
3OwhTtayaa	Lame. Demand a pic or change doctors! That is absolutely not porn. That is your unborn child and she has every right to have a pic.

Next time use protection I would wait until next week to test though!!!|`|AA10030081	It is possible to be pregnant and still have a period. What you should do is go to your nearest clinic or doctor and have a test done. You do not have to wait to miss a period to see if you are, you can find out with in the first week or so after having unprotected sex with a blood testt at a doctors office or clinic. I know because both my pregnancies I still had my period while pregnant.|`|OuuYoSBeaa	25%... if your period is late, then take a test.<br>  <br>  EDIT: if yall would do some research on this, there is only a 25% chance of conception even if you hit ovulation on the nose...get the facts before thumbing down someone who took the time to get the facts|`|tOEsgYxCaa	You may be causing your period to be late by panicking. So either relax for a day or day and see if it comes or put yourself your of the misery and test now there are some very good early detection tests that you can do today|`|50e0975b0e8c470ea8e974086f449b63aa	Look like all your cycles are at least 2 days apart I would wait and see if it comes tomorrow 
ubkt5RQiaa	yes it did!  The good news is, it actually does go away.  I have been somewhat tired the whole pregnancy (I'm 29 weeks) but nothing compared to what the beginning was.  Hang in there, it should improve in the next few weeks!  You might want to bring it up to your dr though at your next visit.  Sometimes extreme fatigue can be a symptom of an iron deficiency.  |`|UgX5WeGPaa	OMG... absolutely!!!  in your first trimester your EXHAUSTED, in your second you get energy back in your third trimester and toward the end you so big and uncomfortable that your tired from lugging around the big belly!  <br>  man i remember i'd work all day (in an office) and go home and crash on the couch!  i couldnt keep my head up! it was horriable!  <br>  it'll go away, dont worry.|`|wyNVJXUiaa	Hi yes I was exhausted during my first trimester and beginning of second trimester.  There was this time where I did not want to stand, sit, nor lay down because I was so exhausted.  It will get better though!  But do bring it up with your doctor so that he/she is aware and can give suggestions.|`|X83LVP6Iaa	Yes. It happens to me still every now and then and I am 24 weeks on Thursday. Infact I am tired right now..LOL|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Oh this still happens to me. Not as bad but from about 4 weeks-15 weeks it was where I would take a 2-4 hour nap during the day and couldn't stay up past 8:30pm. It sucked. I eat like every 30 mins and I drink water constantly but it just kicked my butt. Things should start getting a little better here in the next few weeks|`|L42LJ1P4aa	Yes, it's fatigue which is common during pregnancy but if it's getting to be too muhc, it's something you should talk to your OB/doctor/midwife about.|`|lCHuXjyVaa	yes im tired as im writing, but for me its like i dont want to d anything just lay down al day and i get bored but i dont feel like going out its not much fun for me , my friends think im getting boring  :( |`|OsRIALBOaa	make sure you ask the doctor to order some iron tests... you might be low on iron|`|faPKwClPaa	I agree with the first poster.<br>  <br>  Also, that's pregnancy for ya!  I used to joke that getting up each morning was really a roll of the dice - I could never be sure how I felt (energetic, lathargic, happy, moody, etc) on any given day.|`|GjuRYsITaa	oh yes im like it now ive just sent my son to the shop to get me some red bull im in bed by 8 most nights and asleep soon after, my partner has to come home after doing a 12 hour shift and deal with the kids some days he even has to do dinner cause im so knackered
dtoPlMuhaa	Advise her to go to her doctor. It is better to be safe rather than sorry. If she does have an infection she may need antibiotics. And the poor thing needs to fell ok for the number of kids she has to look after. Tell her she needs to put herself first just this one time.<br>  Hope things are better soon.|`|Js09FbDnaa	sounds like a possible infection, have her call the doctor in the morning. The pain & strong smell are very common for a yeast infection & UTI and /or bladder infection|`|Xct8kXLsaa	since she has had kids before i say she knows her body better than anyone. if she is willing to wait until her 6 week post check up then let her. i would tell her to atleast call her doc.|`|ACKaN9XWaa	Oh, that doesn't sound good at all. Tell her to go see her doctor immediately! Good luck!
dLbRLitPaa	The majority on here will tell you no, but I will say this - my baby was successfully induced (by me) using it and me and baby were perfectly fine. My ob actually suggested it to me to begin with sooooo... if it were not safe then I seriously doubt he would have suggested it.<br>  <br>  Also it worked well for my sister - she successfully self induced with it and she and her child were perfectly healthy too.<br>  <br>  It DOES taste bad (like drinking vasoline) and it DOES make you empty your bowels - expect upset tummy for at least an hour, but the plus to that is that you don't have to worry about using the restroom on the delivery table! ;o) <br>  <br>  So, yes it works.<br>  Yes, it's safe - unless you want to believe old wives tails about what is and is not safe - there's a list a mile long with tons of things people seem to think isn't or is safe... It's crazy.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!<br>  <br>  and update if you decide to use it!!<br>  <br>  PS I used about 2 tablespoons for my 1st dose and followed that with dark grape juice which cut the taste out pretty quick - after my frequent restroom breaks were over with - I took another tablespoon or two and that was it - I was in labor. Contractions had started after the 1st dose but the 2nd dose made them `stronger. I also walked A LOT after the contractions began. Had my baby girl that night!! :)|`|pXSKSS3daa	You just asked this question. Pretty much everyone told you NO. I don't know what you want to hear, but I doubt anyone is going to tell you to go for it.<br>  <br>  Consult your OB. They'll most likely tell you that nothing will work unless your body is ready for labor, castor oil can cause you to have diarrhea pretty badly, and it may increase chances for fetal distress.|`|wENdWT5kaa	No, it isn't, all it will do is give you cramps and the runs and there is a chance that it will pass to your baby causing it to take a bowel movement in utero which will cause major health problems. <br>  <br>  Do not take that risk. |`|5ET4mWkzaa	For some women it works and others it doesn't. My best friend took castor oil and it caused her to go into labor but her daughter passed her first stool while in the womb and ended up inhaling it on the way out. She had to stay in the hospital for a week. It's not worth it. I never tried it.|`|sAbah6dTaa	my mom swore it worked on my little brother, i went overdue with my last pregnancy, and wanted me to take it.<br>  <br>  i think it would be fine, if you are brave enough. lots of people did it back in the day, and i've never heard anything harmful. <br>  <br>  it just makes you poop alot, and when you're empty, you start to push more and makes you go into labor ??? <br>  <br>  good luck, i feel for you!|`|cIBDSGvsaa	Gestation is usually 41 weeks. Wait another couple of weeks and don't play with nature.|`|yU0dp5HDaa	You already posted this like 20 minutes ago!|`|WOyYKoXlaa	I wouldn't recommend it. I know you probably very uncomfortable but you wouldn't want to put you or your baby in danger. Hang in there. Keep yoru self busy.<br>  Make sure your bags are packed, make sure the baby's clothes are ready. Make any last minute returns. Get thank you card done for all those baby gifts you've been receiving. PUt Halloween decorations up. GO to the movies with SO or Friends. Gosh knows you won't have time when the baby comes. Start a online Blog on how yoru feeling and what your expecting when you delivery. Sign up for all those great baby sites Like Pampers, Huggies, Formula sites, Breastfeeding sites like Kellymom.com or join a group of mom's having babies right now just like you...Cafemom.com or Parenting.com. Watch all those girly movies you've been dying to see...cause your not going to have time or be awake enough when the baby comes. <br>  Hang in there. Keep busy. as soon as you relax enough YOUR body will geer up for labor OR doc will schedule an induction. Safe Delivery vibes coming your way. Congratulations your about to be a MOMMY.|`|b7329aa7a50c45d2073625da82916595aa	No...Didn't you already post this like 10 minutes ago. The answer is not going to change. It is a bad idea.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I've heard it is bad for your baby.|`|XbMvV2P0aa	yes it is safe but you will be on the toilet the whole day lol
ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I'm 33 weeks pregnant and we have the entire nursery already set up and have for like a month now. We just buy things here and there to put in there but we are all set. I'm the type of person that gets too excited to wait. Plus, I didn't want her to come early and not have everything in order. I think setting it up now would be fine and that way you can always do it gradually instead of all at once right when you're due! Congrats!|`|KaNjj6HBaa	If you are on number 3 girl I would get thins ready as soon as possible!  As far as the clothes getting dusty as long as you keep them in a closet or dresser I think you are fine! I started getting things ready at about 32 weeks. Your life is going to be crazy enough in a little more than a month, prepare everything as soon as you can! just my opinion though!|`|NVmDVBPyaa	oh I totally understand.  I asked the same question a few weeks ago and Im expecting number 4 :):)  Go ahead and get everything else ready and organized.  I held off till 35 weeks to wash everything but you could do it earlier.  The worse that will happen is that you will have to wash the clothes again and really that's just lots of fun :)|`|mFQydvncaa	girl if i were as far as you i would have already done it. Im so impatient and cant wait to do my little girls room!! my son is almost 7 so i am so excited to have a girl!!<br>  <br>  im sure itll all be fine!|`|oMNXWMs9aa	Its been 10yrs since I had my first baby but for this one I am going to do that about 2-3 weeks before my due date. I am going to set up the whole room but I will wash everything later.|`|vz1gmSM7aa	I did mine real early just because I was so excited and I enjoyed it too.|`|IClknOd5aa	i couldnt wait, i did everything when i was like 3months along, but then did a re-wash a couple days b4 my due date|`|ZncV5gc0aa	Wait until baby gets here is what I'm going to do. I'm not even taking a lot of stuff out the box. I have a bassinett and changing table in my room, but the bedding is not on it. The clothes I washed last week. I'm 34 wks.|`|1VOsRV8Maa	I'd be antsy too! I'd say go ahead and wash it and get it ready. If clothes are in a dresser or closet, they shouldn't get dusty. If the bedding gets dusty, then just wash it again! I think you'll have fun doing it again anyhow! :) Can't wait to find out whether it's a boy or girl for me so then I can get ready as well! Good luck! Congrats on #3!|`|dxTwHB1yaa	I didn't really wash anything new. I know it's bad but I didn't want to ruin any of the whites or have things look pilly. <br>  <br>  The other things that people gave me I washed about two weeks before. <br>  <br>  The bedding I did, and it was about a week before he came. <br>  <br>  But I wound up having to wash everything again about a month or so later, because he slept in a little bassinet by my bed.|`|MtC3CWZraa	I think I started washing clothes after 32 weeks or so, but I never seem to get done because just as soon as it's all put away, someone else gives me more. <br>  <br>  I put the crib bedding on around 36 weeks. I have cats and put it off until we established that the crib isn't for them.|`|xq8Kn7Phaa	I AM PREGNANT WITH MY 1ST NOW 26 WEEKS YAY!!!<br>  I AM WAITING TILL AFTER MY BABY SHOWER IN 4 WEEKS TO DO ALL THE WASHING MOSTLY CUZ I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF BEDDING OR CLOTHES YET FOR MY LIL GIRL!!!!<br>  <br>  ALTHOUGH I WAS GIVEN SOME HAND ME DOWN CLOTHES THAT I HAVE WASHED TWICE I THINK ALREADY AND WILL DO AGAIN WHEN ALL THE NEW STUFF COMES IN|`|W0gMQVoDaa	i washed everything when i was 37wks packed what i needed to into my hospital bag and made up the crib and put all the other stuff in the airing cupboard,good luck and congratulations xx
qKBLrwOCaa	I know EXACTLY how you feel.  We've been trying for four years.  Seen a fertility dr. for three.  Spent thousands of dollars, used clomid (three cycles), fertility shots (two cycles), done five IUIs and considering IVF.  My husband's sister has gotten pregnant twice since we've been trying, four women I work with have gotten pregnant (one twice), my cousin, and another friend have gotten pregnant.  AND my doctor says there's NOTHING WRONG WITH ME!!!!  It's driving me crazy!!!  <br>  I've given up alcohol, caffeine, diet soda, and tried acupuncture.  People have told me to 'just relax' - are you  kidding me???<br>  I stopped being happy for other people when I find out they are pregnant.  I question why they are more 'worthy' of being a mother than me?  <br>  I also work with a woman that tried for several years - everything I've tried.  She and her husband adopted a little girl and then became pregnant.<br>  I have finally come to the realization that God has a different plan for me and my husband.  We are considering becoming foster parents - there are many babies and children that need loving homes.  It's possible that once we take our minds off getting pregnant - by caring for children foster homes - it will happen.  <br>  I know this isn't encouragement for you, but I do want you to know you're not alone and I know where you are coming from.<br>  e-mail me if you want - girlmikes@ymail.com<br>  I hope things work out for you.|`|wsRCZ1Mtaa	UM.. not to point out the obvious, but if it's not you... has your dh gotten tested?<br>  <br>  I know it's hell.   Been there, done that.  It's even worse when everyone around you is pregnant, and you just aren't!<br>  <br>  Take a month or two off from ttc.  Ignore your cycle, and go back to just loving your spouse.  You both need a break, and you can go back to it later.|`|AA11756768	I was also surrounded by people getting pregnant while I was TTC, before that no one I knew had gotten pregnant, it just seemed like I was constantly hearing about someone getting pregnant, especially by accident while I was trying. I ended up getting pregnant after a year an a half. Just keep trying and if you haven't seen a dr yet then don't put it off. The first or the second thing they try might not work, but it doesn't mean the third or fourth or fifth thing they try won't. |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I know what you're going through. We went through 2 1/2 years of TTC and nothing worked. Both of my best friends had two babies during that time point and my sister in law as well. It seemed like everyone was having babies all around me and I wanted to be happy for them but it just made things worse for me and my husband. We went and did all the fertility testing and nothing was wrong with either of us. In June my doctor prescribed me Clomid and I went and bought a clear blue easy fertility monitor off ebay and found out I was three weeks pregnant July 16th. So there is hope for you out there. I HIGHLY recommend buying a fertility monitor and have your doctors prescribed you any fertility drugs. I hope that something works for you. Good luck and let me know how it goes. God Bless you!|`|lYaPh2XBaa	Me & My fiancee tried for a year. I was at the breaking point also were I wanted to just give up being I was sopposed to not be able to have kids.<br>  <br>  I started taking the one a day womens vitiams (Not trying to get pregnant I just thought it would be heathier for me.) I tell you it wasnt 4 months later, and Im pregnant now Im 14weeks along.<br>  <br>  God has plans for us all. Whenever he decided its time for you it will all fall into place & happen at the right time.<br>  <br>  I wish you & your hubby the best of luck, and I hope you get pregnant soon.<br>  <br>  =]|`|FvonW0Gmaa	Well, I don't know if this will help, but I always hear that the second you stop trying is when you get pregnant.  Maybe you are stressing so much about it that it is preventing it from happening.  I would stop trying so hard, and just let nature take it's course.  Have you been to the doctor to make sure nothing is wrong??  |`|AA12240329	i know exactly what you are going through. it took me EXACTLY 18months TTC, i gave up towards the end of May i told my BF (of five years) that i was done trying because it was really depressing me out stressing me out and it just hurt to hear that my little sisters friends (she's 18) were getting pregnant left and right.  i had decided to put it off and just go back to school wait at least for the semester to be over and go to the doctor.  my bf told me he was okay with that if it was my choice.  i had a doctors appt in july to get back on  birth control (weird i know) and all of june i started feeling crappy and my coworker pushed me to take a test and i did. i honestly didn't believe i would ever get pregnant but i did! i'm five months now.  it just took me to give up and stop stressing about it to end up pregnant... i prayed a lot as well... <br>  <br>  once i knew i was pregnant i knew i was truly blessed.  so don't give up hope. it will happen to you at the right time.  just relax and try not to stress! i know it's easier said then done, but you will be blessed with a child.  <br>  <br>  i wish you all the luck and LOTS of baby dust!!! |`|JklLo5cQaa	I know it's hard, but be happy for all the blessings that have been thrown your way. And instead of TTC, STOP!!! I know it is hard, but quit. Put it in the back of your mind and take a 2 day vacation (just for the hay of it)...and do whatever you and your other half want to do. The more you try the more frustrated you will become. Once you Quit trying..it seems to happen! I will keep you in my wishes, good luck and keep that chin up. All will happen in time!|`|b0aedc9dd7e866ac9503c3e962e4170baa	I know you mentioned that you've been to the doctor and you said there's nothing wrong with you...was your significant other checked out also?<br>  I agree with the others...I think the best thing to do is just stop trying, so to speak, just have fun, don't think about getting pregnant, just try and remove as much stress from your life as possible.<br>  Good luck and lots of baby dust your way|`|pjbgkDzyaa	I have some tips if you haven't already tried them....first of all the more you and the hubby have sex the lower the sperm count. Try having sex once a week. If hubby wears tighty whities try boxer shorts. Also stress can cause your body to react in ways you couldn't imagine. Lighten up a little and just have fun!!  Don't make sex a chore otherwise its exhausting for the two of you!  Good Luck and don't be discouraged.<br>  |`|Xct8kXLsaa	i just read in one of the womans mags. that if u havent fallen pregnant in 6 months it time to talk to ur doc about ur options.|`|Ge3Ct0H4aa	your time will come....<br>  <br>  Sending u tons of baby dust
bed3c9511d819eabe6d4a233bf96d01caa	Blood test are more reliable than the pregnancy test. There could have been a mix-up etc.... Talk to the Dr about this.|`|Po2UqfvWaa	it's best you stop telling people your 14 weeks pregnant. the test have shown you several times now that your not and probably never was or lost it between periods. if that happened you wouldn't have noticed too much. this happened to my daughter in june. you need to move on and accept the results|`|Yn2n26zXaa	What do I think? I think your a liar. Why do you trolls keep all you Q&A up for us to look at? Get off the computer and go outside and play :)<br>  <br>  Edit to add:<br>  Oh so your not a troll? Wow. Had me fooled. Um, well, your saying your 14 weeks and then you have a picture on here and your showing but your still wondering if your pregnant? Right. <br>  None of your questions/info add up. Either your lying or it's a food baby.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	That is strange. Did you talk to your doctor about it? It is possible to have false negative hpt but I'm not sure about blood tests. I'm sorry you're going through that. good luck|`|pgUzx6DLaa	Youre the same crack head that posted the question about you smoking pot and drinking. you probably killed your kid off. do the world a favor and stop reproducing|`|0iUxfCMcaa	no you dont have to eat before the test. 14wks along? are you counting from your last lmp?
J8LF9Lboaa	Oh the girl should definitely have a say. It is her body and her baby, and I actually don't know if it's legal for parents to make kids get an abortion. They could probably make you put it up for adoption if they refuse to support it, since a 14 year old girl would probably not be able to take care of a baby by herself.<br>  <br>  I would ask my daughter what she wanted to do, and if she wanted to keep the baby, I'd help her. If she wanted to get an abortion or put it up for adoption, I'd be there for her, too. It's all about backing up the people you love!|`|GVcudkVoaa	I don't think abortion is an escape for anything. If a parent encourages an abortion, what is to stop the child from going out and getting pregnant again? I would have my child carry the baby to term and then adopt it to a family who could care for it. I think this would teach a lesson not only to my child, but her siblings and friends as well. Children learn nothing unless there are consequences for each and every action. |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	As far as I know the person that is pregnant is the only one that can say if she has an abortion or not. No one should be forced into killing their baby.|`|Bh3QeLaoaa	Why would you put your baby up for adoption if you got pregnant? If you are in any way capable of keeping your baby, you should. Your parents WOULD understand if you kept it, my parents did but I was also 17. It would leave the BIGGEST hole in your heart if you got an abortion or put it up for adoption. So no, the mother of the child should get the final say. A parent is someone who supports and loves their child no matter what they do or say. The girl's parent should suggest their opinion and the pro's and con's of the outcome but the girl should have the final say and the parent should support that decision. |`|yWNNdVPbaa	This is a tough question to answer. A fourteen year old girl is not capable of caring for, or supporting a child. On the other hand, it is her child, so I think she should have at the very least, particail say in it.<br>  abortion is wrong, no matter who makes the decision.<br>  The parents should realize they were to blame for letting there FOURTEEN year old have an opportunity to have sex, and get herself pregnant. There fore, the baby would be their responsibility too.|`|TMi7dvpiaa	honey, till u r 18 ur parents gets to make the decision for u. for me if my 14 year old girl gets pregnant, i wouldn't abort it, i will make her give birth and i will take care of the baby till she is ready to do it herself<br>  but if you know a 14 year old girl who is pregnant, tell her to talk to her <br>  parent , apologise fo getting pregnant at that tender age and then beg <br>  hem to help her through. and if possible also convince them to take care of ur child till u are ready.takecare |`|BCk6Yh8Xaa	the parents should NOT have the finanl say<br>  if my teenage daugher got pregnant, i wouldnt make her get an abortion i would help her as much as i could without making it seem acceptable for her to be pregnant outside of marriage and financially stable<br>  she'll have to learn from her mistakes<br>  <br>  <br>  Ella|`|AKm2Jtj6aa	Im going to be totally honest here(no judging from anyone please) I am almost 20 years old and my son is amost 5. yea, I got pregnant when I was 14 and a month before he was born I turned 15. My father tried to make me give him up for adoption(but later on I found out that he was supposed to get a lump sum of money out of the deal). I did a little research (in the state or indiana of course, all states are different) and I found out that in that state, a pregnant girl is legally emancipated from her parents. She is known as an adult if gotten pregnant and can make a desicion for herself. Some people think that being only fifteen years old that you apparently done have a brain or a mouth, but I did the research and everything. Today, my son is safe and sound and very well spoiled and very well tought and behaived like a little gentleman that he should be. <br>  <br>  <br>  all in all, its based on what state the girl lived in and how the laws worked there. Personally, i think that if the girl has the brains and well means then she whould be able to speak her mind.<br>  <br>  all situations are different though.<br>  <br>  this is just my opinion and story here.|`|HfyPZPxGaa	The girl should have a say, yeah.<br>  The parents also have a say though because the girl would be living in their house, under their income, and on their insurance.  and the parents would take on the responsibility of the baby until the 14 year old is old enough to get a job, and even then the baby is still living with them for another two years.<br>  <br>  I'm only a teenager, but I would probably start off by yelling and telling her how immature I thought she was and how I didn't want to have to raise her baby.  Then I'd calm down and talk to her about school and how she is going to finish if she keeps the baby, and make her find a way to earn money because there is no way in hell i am raising my skanky 14 year olds baby.|`|OJFz0LBZaa	if it was my daughter i would stick by what ever she wanted to do and if it was to have the baby help every way i could to support her decision |`|Ylrc1hkXaa	the woman should always have the final say. If the parents oppose abortion and she wants one are we going to let them force her to go through with the birth?
HclKftzAaa	We were TTC for 2 yrs. I of course was happy, but my first emotions were more like disbelief, shock, confusion lol. I have PCOS, and we were under the impression that i really wouldn't ovulate on my own. I had taken provera to start my period, so i could take clomid, so it was a big surprise that my period didn't start because i was pregnant!!! Lol<br>  <br>  Also, i didn't rush out of the bathroom and tell hubby, because i wanted to check and see if provera tablets gives a false positive before i told him. Which it doesn't do that, by the way! :D<br>  <br>  Then i went and woke him up. I was so excited and nervous that i was all tingly, and i showed him the pee stick, when he could read it he was like 'seriously?' and then we hugged and cried and all that.<br>  <br>  17 weeks now :DDDDDD!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Super gratz to you!!!! It's amazing how awesome and overwhelming it is to finally get our wish after all this time. :D|`|pWDYcBA7aa	Yeah I was happy!<br>  I was trying for 1 year almost!<br>  =)<br>  Congrats!|`|da0bd1389f2c6ba2fe645d6d1c4be705aa	ya i was happy and shocked i tried for a month|`|AAbGMKo5aa	Congratzz im on my 2ww|`|TFdhL7LKaa	I was shocked as my husband and I were not trying, but I was very happy.

8VJwoGXKaa	Well...it's possible to get pregnant on the pill...not likely but just wait and see...I wouldn't panic too much.|`|AA11764194	That tiny,tiny bit blood may turn in to full fledged periods by tomorrow.. samething happened tome as I am also taking pills.. <br>  <br>  if you are doubtful then take a HPT|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	get a test and cute dog i ahve one too|`|Tc23KWgzaa	If you didn't miss any pills during your cycle, then yes, you are just getting worked up.  You'd have to miss 2 or 3 pills in 4 or 5 days, and have had sex during that time.  If you didn't miss any, you're great.<br>  <br>  TX Mom<br>  |`|9cu82009aa	Leave it a week or so and take a test, if you want to know before then see a doctor and get a blood test, my cousins fiance got pregnant whilst on the pill.|`|mTwn8p79aa	Probably.  Give it another day or two.  You can use an EPT to be sure and put your mind at rest.|`|gMk7maMnaa	You can totally get pregnant on birth control, especially if you just started your birth control within 3 months. I am a mother of 4 wonderful children, 2 of which were conceived while I was taking the pill.<br>  Anyway, I would go get a pregnancy test. You don't want to continue taking the pill while you are pregnant.<br>  <br>  PS. Don't listen to guys who tell you you can't get pregnant on the pill....exactly how would they know that for sure? LOL!<br>  <br>  2 of my children are living proof that the pill doesn't always work!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|flOOmBiGaa	ok, well you prolly know that bc is only 99.9% effective, so, you might want to get a prego test just to be on the safe side, you could be experiencing "spotting" which is where you only bleed a very small amount, but from what i hear, it doesnt usually even get to your underwear... i would take a test just to be sure! GL|`|9b2a823d56eccf54adae83e6bbdc6c7baa	It's pretty unlikely that you are pregnant.  Is the blood red?  If so that it is even MORE unlikely.  But if you need to put your mind at ease.  Take a pregnancy test.|`|e1adb1e6bf7618d36ecfea10a335a315aa	Well it could be implantation bleeding and cramping from your uterus--or maybe your period is just late this time. |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It is possible. It could be implantation bleeding. If you are concerned then go buy a HPT and test. Good luck!|`|OMnfN3tdaa	i think u need to tp go the doctor
T48smu01aa	there just growing rapidly your skin is stretching causing them to itch best thing to do is get some lotion like cocco butter and rub on there when you feel there itchy or going to itch!<br>  Goodluck!|`|AA10953561	I started having itchy nipples around 2.5 months pregnant, so it sounds normal. I got a body butter type lotion (it's creamier than normal lotion) and use it at least twice a day. The itchiness hasn't completely gone away, but it is at least managable now. Here's the exact type of lotion I'm using: bodycology vanilla buttercream. I got it at wal-mart. I've also had an itchy tummy since I started stretching out and this lotion helps with that, too. <br>  <br>  Make sure you're drinking enough water, if your body can't stay hydrated from the inside no lotion on earth will help hydrate from the outside.<br>  <br>  But yes, this is normal. I hope it helps you! Good luck!|`|iwYu32N2aa	Very normal.<br>   To stop the itch, I don't know<br>  Scratch them maybe lol<br>   Good Luck|`|01vMpHkWaa	haha im 6 months and my belly and nipples always itch!<br>  its because the skin is stretching<br>  <br>  i use olay lotion to make it stop|`|cR9LqBSNaa	well i don't know that it's normal. but everyone's pregnancy is different. i have breast swelling and tenderness, but not itching. it may just be that your skin is extra sensitive now that you are pregnant. try bras with softer, more breathable materials. |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I believe they are itchy because of them growing. You can get the Palmer's Cocoa Butter Formula For Dry, Itchy Skin. You can get it at the store Motherhood. I use it for my itchy belly and it works great. It just makes your skin really oily but totally worth it. lol. Good luck and I hope I helped. |`|AA11851101	Yes, try the cocoa butter lotion, it also helps with stretchmarks.  |`|s8f2ZPdGaa	Try to buy Lanolin cream.  It is for lactating women who are breastfeeding to help with the itch and cracked nipples.<br>  <br>  Congratulations on the pregnancy!|`|9Gc18dVAaa	Totally normal, that is how I know~mine never got sore in the very beginning but boy did/do they itch!  The itchiness goes away for me by the 2nd trimester, hope so for you too!! Congratulations!|`|yPNvecc7aa	There's not much you can do. Moisturizing makes them feel a bit better.<br>  But don't worry, it won't last long! It happened to me when my nipples grew, and it only lasted about 2 weeks.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	very normal.  Lotion might help.  :)<br>  <br>  Congratulations, by the way. |`|Fm3L8vsYaa	lotion may help & yes its normal |`|utfoP7GWaa	coco butter lotion helps.....|`|GFaPBv67aa	yep that means they are getting larger
sIQzny5Taa	Were you expecting to stay a divorced woman forever? I mean, you got divorced for a reason to start a new life. You're not abandoning your children if you have a child with another man, that may or may not have happened eventually anyway, and the same way with him. It just happened sooner. Just because you moved on faster rather than taking years doesn't really matter. You're still divorced. Unless you were planning on getting back with him...I don't think you should worry. As long as you are still there for your children and you and your ex can handle this as mature adults, there should be no problems. I don't think he'll be pleased if he had hopes for you two to get back together, but if he knew you had a boyfriend, he shouldn't be surprised. Good luck, and congrats.|`|vjsT8DMIaa	well its obviously none of his business, and who cares how he reacts....you are divorced. When you say "newly" divorced...how long has it been? I dont care though...if my husband and I were to divorce, and he were to get a gf right away, that would just show that he never cared in the first place. If you love someone, its not easy to just "get over them". So maybe he'll be pissed...maybe he'll be hurt...who knows.|`|OxFV92hJaa	He probably won't be happy! Can you blame him though. I don't know how "newly" new is to you. But I'm assuming a couple months newly divorced. If so, then thats "fast". He'll probably be pissed that the kids will be caught in the middle of all of it. G'luck. I know I wouldn't be happy. |`|AA11206135	wow ladyren.. maybe your parents should have stopped at just your brother.....|`|hNhzBrtJaa	It depends. Are you newly divorced yet separated for 2 yrs? Who was the 1 that suggested the marriage broke up? Why did it break up?<br>  <br>  Nobody on here can give you an actual answer because we do not know your situation.<br>  For example, if you left him for this other guy and filed for divorce straight away, he is likely to be upset, angry etc but if you made a mutual decision a couple of years ago and only finally divorced recently, he may not care as much.<br>  <br>  The only way you will find out is by telling him.<br>  And at the end of the day, if he does react badly, its nothing to do with him because you are not married to him anymore and if wasn't for you 2 children then you would have no ties.<br>  Just don't let things get messy for you childrens sake because he is still and always will be their Dad!! x<br>  <br>  |`|s5c01qRLaa	I'm sorry, but he is the only one who can answer that for you. Since you have two children together, I am assuming that you have regular contact with him. I would suggest telling him sooner rather than later so that he doesn't feel like you were trying to hide it from him. |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Well why does it matter how he will act since you are divorced? It's not any of his business. The only thing that is his business now is your children that you have together. |`|tOWqXCdtaa	I'm sure it would be hard to accept, but the level of difficulty would depend on your situation, if things were really going south before the breakup and how over you he is already.|`|u9dmYSKiaa	I would be pissed. I mean when people divorce usually early into the being on your own part you still think about the other person whether you still love them or not. And depends on WHY you two divorced. That's my opinion...|`|lqSjsJI9aa	why - do you care! Its your ex, enjoy it with your new boyfriend!<br>  <br>  (Maybe you still care too much about your ex?) |`|UEAzzroAaa	What does it matter, hes your ex for a reason! :) |`|vJP6yTy3aa	why don't you ask him?  he'd probably be upset that you got pregnant by some new guy.  you can't have been dating long if you're newly divorced...|`|1UpR1vSCaa	IT DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE YOU GUYS ARE DIVORCE HE CAN'T HAVE ANY CONTROL OVER WHAT HAP-PENDS IN YOUR LIFE AFTER HIM YOU SHOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT IT JUST ENJOY YOUR PREGNANCY <br>  AND CONGRATS<br>  GOD BLESS YOUR FAMILY<br>

zth3G2b6aa	Airen, Landen and Aidan are great for boys- They sound so Irish, I love them. <br>  Kilan is AWESOME for a girl and Averie is sooo cute too. <br>  <br>  Piper is sweet sounding, but if you think about it- would you want that name? |`|aknvXYijaa	I'm not sold on the girls names. I would choose Isobel Averie.<br>  If your not sure on Nathaniel, just have Nathan.<br>  Landen Airen would be my preference.|`|x6IyESABaa	I like Piper for girl and Landen for boy|`|AA12305031	i like piper|`|2MehFRTUaa	Piper Averie is really cute!<br>  And Landen Aiden is nice, but I'm not too sure about Aiden,<br>  because the first and last names both end in n, and I just don't think it sounds right.<br>  Maybe Landen Michael or something else like that?|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I like the girls names. Now I love the names Landon and Aidan but I don't think they sound good together in the same name. But definitely use one of them because those are actually two of my favorite names. |`|5f2be19e0833505fadb6abc64d662746aa	I like the boy's names but not the girl's.<br>  Averie and Isobel are cute.<br>  Landen/Landon is cool. So is Aiden. Could be Addison, too.<br>  Nathaniel is cool so stick with it.<br>  :)|`|Bemaz4BKaa	I only like the name Piper Averie. I personally don't like the boys names.

afDDiHbXaa	i went to a naming ceremony recently and if/when i have a baby thats the route i will take i am not religous and this ceremony was done in a family gathering where the parents grandparents and god parents wrote a speech or peom and read it to the chile it was very personal i have had all 3 of my children christened but please if you want to legal to have these people look after your children if anything was to happen to you you need to make a will and put this in the will|`|T8ksKCWCaa	You don't have to be Jewish to be baptized.It's the same as a Christening. And since you are not religious, you should just write your intentions out and have them witnessed(signed) by a lawyer. That way if anything happens to you, your child will be placed with the people you have chosen to be their guardian. You should not call them Godparents if they will not be teaching the child about God.|`|MDJlwQj3aa	By attending the church service and repeating the vows in the service they become officially godparents. However this is not a legal commitment. The godparent's role is purely moral and spiritual ... they are not legal guardians and have no obligation to adopt or look after the child should it lose its parents.<br>  <br>  In most cases there should be no fewer than three godparents. Two shall be of the same sex as the child. A godparent should ideally have been baptized and confirmed, but this isn't strictly enforced.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps<br>  <br>  |`|Js09FbDnaa	you have a baptisim for the baby and the godparents sign some paperwork|`|NXeLcbO0aa	when u get chritained they sign papers to make it offical, so if anything happens to ya parents they will be your carers

If I understood this right it is quite possible you are pregnant. Anytime you are off the pill it takes 10 days after you start the pill again to be protected. ...and to top it off even on the pill it's not 100% protection.|`|c2uEs18eaa	Book your gyno for 3 weeks later. If you have your period by then, relax and cancel. In the meantime, just keep protected even if you are on the pill.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Chances are it's probably just all messed up from the birth control and maybe even the yeast infection. If you really are concerned that you are pregnant then take another test in like a week or so. Good luck!|`|3fk6bTMxaa	You can look for pregnancy signs below. Best, G|`|880810d4326c921557a558c16c9d1c6daa	Alrighty, well here's the thing. Your most likely to get pregnant two weeks before your period. I'm guessing your period was the 26th of September, so by that schedule your most likely to get pregnant on the 12th/13th. Did you have unprotected sex then?  If your 8 DAYS late, there's a good chance you are pregnant. However, if this is your first period on the pill, it might just be a hormonal adjustment. Some women experience a change in their period during the first few months of using the pill. Also, it would help if you told me what kind of birth control your on. With the pill, you can actually stop your period. In your pack, the last week is sugar pills (the white pills). If you don't take the sugar pills, and start a new pack, you can stop your period. Therefore if you start a new pack every 3 weeks, you can stop your period. I would go to the walk-in clinic. They can do a blood test, which is more accurate than the over-the-counter tests, to see. Hope this helps!|`|bN0t8Ioyaa	Since you stopped the pill, you might be. <br>  But since your test came back negative i say wait like 2 days try one again, if it still comes back negative and you haven't gotten your period take another test in one week. <br>  <br>  I would still suggest you see a doctor, and get a blood test to make sure.
b36e4e97ffcfd1ea245a0588271a1f72aa	You might be, or you might just be feeling sensitive because you are worried. Go to a supermarket (tescos is good) and get a cheap, own brand test that has two tests in. Do one now and if it comes up negative, wait a week and try again. If you're not pregnant, I suggest you look for an alternative to the pill, like the contraception injection which lasts up to 3 months with no side effects. |`|vBOUND7Naa	Since you forgot to take the pill, I think you should take a different method of birth control.<br>  <br>  For example:<br>  You could try the patch. You only have to put it on once every seven days. It's more consistent.<br>  <br>  Now, to answer your question:<br>  I think you might be. Depends if he unleashed his load inside you or not.<br>  <br>  But, for your sake, try a different method of birth control.<br>  Take a look at this:<br>  <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/birth-control-4211.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-...</a><br>  |`|iqhmKBQDaa	i was on the pill, and had forgotten 2 take it a couple of times, can be easily done. <br>  Try a pregnancy test now, if not wait couple of weeks |`|hEPYMjs0aa	i fink that you shud go to the doctors and get a checkupx|`|U3UbLnl2aa	maybe wait a little longer then get a test|`|GGH0HVdvaa	Well then it sounds like it is a definite possibility that you are pregnant. Wait until your next period is to arrive and then take a home pregnancy test to see.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	If you had unprotected sex then the chances of being pregnant are high even if he did pull out. As soon as you can I would take an early detection pregnancy test. Good luck

It was also borne by six Byzantine emperors and five Armenian kings. Another famous bearer was Leo Tolstoy (1828-1910), a Russian novelist whose works include 'War and Peace' and 'Anna Karenina'. Leo is also the name of a constellation and the fifth sign of the zodiac.<br>  Morgan - From the Old Welsh masculine name Morcant, which was possibly derived from Welsh mor "sea" and cant "circle". As a (possibly unrelated) feminine name it was used by Geoffrey of Monmouth for the Arthurian sorceress Morgan le Fay.

So once you reach the end of 31 weeks you will be a whole 7 months.  8 month is 32-35 weeks. So at the end of 35 weeks you will be 8 months, and then the 9th month is 36-40. Hope I helped. |`|AA12356515	You're officially 7 months pregnant when you reach 28 weeks.|`|awRNr2VMaa	i would go by weeks its easier so when its every 4 weeks in a month then i would count it out |`|LsNELr3Qaa	You'll be 28 weeks (7 months) on December 12th 2008|`|KUQuL1jXaa	i go by weeks. its easier and its better. 
6yy0jtzDaa	I am the same way i hated sleeping on my back but i find myself doing it at times the way to got over it was putting a pillow between my legs and replacing it when i woke up in the middle of the night i just kept putting it back now after about 2-3 weeks i can't go to sleep without and the night i don't sleep without my back kills me the next day it ok to sleep on your back until you are 20 weeks so you are still ok but just start focusing on sleeping on your side from now on|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Sleeping on your back puts pressure on your spine which cuts off oxygen and blood supply to you and your baby! I wouldn't sleep on your back. You can sleep on your belly until it feel too uncomfortable to but sleeping on your back is not a good idea. I hate sleeping on my sides so what I was told to do is to place a pillow under one side and you can sleep on your back but not flat on your back so that your not cutting off the oxygen and blood supply. Hope I helped! Good luck!|`|rC6gL7KOaa	Experts say you shouldn't sleep on your back because it reduces blood flow to the fetus. It's ok if you wake up on your back, just turn on your side when you notice you're doing it. Lying on your back for a little while is perfectly fine. You lie on your back when you go to the doctor or for ultrasounds right?|`|816TYl4eaa	i would not worry to much because you would have to be on your back for along time to do any damage but that's what my doctor told me. So i would not worry to much and just make your husband sleep right beside you so you don't roll over in the night and put a pillow on your other side.|`|oMNXWMs9aa	As long as you don't sleep on you stomach you will be fine. I know that as you get closer to your due date its not comfortable to sleep on you back cause it feels like you cant breath but then again towards the end you its hard to find a comfortable spot period!|`|ZncV5gc0aa	The reason you shouldn't be on your back is that the baby will be head down and face-up rather than face-back and that can make the baby harder to push out for you in the long run. It can also make you have back labor which is painful.|`|HPRlEWu1aa	i have my husband check and make sure im not sleeping on my back, he wakes me up in the miffle of the night ... ive like learned not to sleep on my back now subconciously cuz i think about it all the time
MOF6Benoaa	You may want to think about how you phrase your question.    Everyone reading that headline thinks you are pregnant and going to give birth to your nephew.  Anyhow, you can still do all of those things, just no thrill rides at the amusement park.  If money's as issue, since you may be saving for your baby, playgrounds are free.  A movie and lunch are cheaper than a day at the amusement park.  As far as your nephew being concerned about "who's baby he is", sounds like his own mother dropped the ball.  But what's done is done now.  I imagine that she hasn't done a very good job of making him feel included with the new baby.  I have experience with this, as I had four children within seven years (all one daddy), which is a handful.  I made sure each child understood how important they were, not just to me, but to the new baby as well.  They felt so important because I explained they had a job to do as a big sister/brother.  Before each was born, I would let the older siblings help pick the new baby's outfits, blankets, bottles, etc..I let them believe they were the one shopping for the baby.  After bringing baby home, I let them help me prepare bottles, get wash-clothes and towels for bath, clean outfits ready and so on.  I let them think that I couldn't complete these tasks without them.  It helped me a little bit to have extra hands to help and they felt so needed.|`|1u4CS5J3aa	you should be able to still do those things with him and rides and such will tell you if you can go on them pregnant. Pregnancy isn't a disability, you can continue to do most things you enjoy as long as you don't push yourself.

I talk to him about it a little and he is excited. he understand he is not the baby anymore because he has a younger brother...its not healthy for a four year old to act or be treated like a baby..they are not babies!!! ... tell your nephew your baby can hear him and get him to talk to your belly. tell him he is a big boy and needs to help.|`|Uobq4M3caa	take him to the zoo, or you could go to chuckie cheese, or the aqaurium, water park? it would be good for you if your pregnant (:<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck on the baby!|`|Bbn1ZSTcaa	Your pregnant with your nephew?

7uVlYPEIaa	Not so much that it will fall out, but babies do rub the hair off the back of their heads when they start getting active. It does grow back once they are fully active. My daughters both rub their head all over their bed, will be in different positions through out the night (even when they couldn't roll over). They are almost 6 months old now almost ready to crawl and if you hold them up to something they will stand there holding it without support. I noticed the little bald spots forming on the back of their heads when they were 3 months now it is starting to cover back over. Son did the same thing.<br>  <br>  Even the simple act of washing their hair is enough to make it fall out. My daughters both lost most of the hair on the top of their head shortly after birth. One lost a bit more than the other, but that was because she loves to be in the shower with you and she will push against you to put her head under the shower.|`|TvYX1yXWaa	not always but its really common.. my sons hair started falling out in the middle of his head but the hair on the bottom of his head is really long..|`|Vebih4H7aa	it will grow and then as she gets older she may loose a patch on the back of her head this is just due to where they rub the back of the head on bed sheets and stuff my daughter now 4mths was born with a full head of thick brown hair and now its gone wild theres loads of it! with a slight bald patch at the back ....cute !|`|h85kkDsbaa	My son was born with no hair, it grew and then all fell out.

2H58TZxfaa	I understand your excitement, I don't find out for myself (due in April) until 2 weeks from now, but there are several things you can start planning for and buying.  For instance, a crib is a great place to start.  Large items for the nursery (which usually aren't gifted at showers) are a safe bet-changing table, crib, rocking chair and diapers are all things you can start buying now, without the fear of getting something for the wrong sex.  It's great to start stocking up on diapers now, too, because you can always return unused packages and exchange them for different sizes as your baby grows and its needs change.  <br>  <br>  Mommies also need items too, so look into breast pumps (if you plan to go that route), nursing cover-ups or maternity clothes-if you need those soon.  But most of all, you can financially plan and calculate what you would like, how much it will cost, and then "guesstimate" which items will be gifted so you can plan a budget.  It will make for happy shopping and a happy bank statement. :)<br>  <br>  Congrats! |`|AA10061381	What about making a Christmas stocking for your baby.  I bought one of those kits the craft stores sell.  It was not hard...you just cut out the little pieces, sew on sequins or beads on the pattern printed on the stocking, then sew the sides together.  Sometimes you have to put a little stuffing in between two parts to make little 3D stuffed decorations.  They are not to hard to do- even if you don't like crafty stuff.  They do take a while to finish though.  Then when you find out what your baby will be you can add extra bows if it is a girl or whatever else you can think of.  They usually have a place to put a name on them and you can fill that part in when you are ready.  By the time your baby is here and needs the stocking you'll have it done.  You also have a great story to tell your child about when you made it while you were pregnant waiting for her to arrive.  My kids love theirs.  Congratulations on your baby.  Here is a link that shows some of the styles available.  Not all of them are as intricate as some of these are.  <a href="http://shop.artscraftsusa.com/index.asp?PageAction=VIEWCATS&Category=2558" rel="nofollow">http://shop.artscraftsusa.com/index.asp?...</a>|`|AxstYanzaa	what i did was start buying diapers and wipes i also bought oneis and bottles that you would like to use things like that.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	My husband and I didn't find out the sex until this last monday so we went out and bought all neutral color furniture. We got the bassinet, swing, car seat/stroller, bouncer, and a bather. Plus, getting neutral stuff means that if you have more children that are a different gender then you can use the stuff again. But you may be different though because you are also having a baby shower and I'm not so you may get some of that stuff then. |`|qYt0HHcdaa	start planning the room. since you dont know what the sex will be, you could plan the room that would suit either a boy or a girl, or design 2 seperate rooms, so the usual blues for boys pink for girls. go around shops looking for what colour paint you wanna use or what wallpaper will suit best, what toys would suit the room and other things you wish to add. collect free samples of things like wallpaper to stick into a planning book. all that planning would take a while to do. this wont cost you money, except for a book to plan in, and some colouring pencils. also if you do this you could add to the book as you plan more things and you go along, add photos and other ideas, so years from now it can be a momento.
T48smu01aa	don't worry I am 12 weeks tomorrow and I worry but theres no point in worrying about it b/c it makes it worse and you just stress the more you stress it can be harmful and result in miscarriage so stop stressing you will be fine...if you have seen your doctor already and you have seen the heart beat your chances lower greatly!

AA11411016	yes|`|AA11379158	four weeks is too soon for most women. count about 2-4 months. if you're breastfeeding it's quicker and most effective.|`|AA12033834	not always it maybe take a couple months|`|AA10002569	i really didnt look pregnant untill I was 4 months|`|AA10598839	nope, you don't start to notice belly canges till maybe 8 weks you could start feeling bloated. Most 1st time moms don't get a lil belly till 4 months. 2ed or more pregnancies do show earlier. EVERY PREGNANCY is differnt and babies grow at their own rate. 4 week the baby is about the size of a pin dot smaller then a grain of rice. I;m 12 weeks almost 13 and my baby is less then 1 oz and 2.5  - 3in long.|`|AA12117337	No, not really....the baby is still very tiny at 4 weeks...you probably wont start to see a noticable belly until around 3 - 4 months! (12 to 16 weeks)|`|f064eb1e1bb95404b01aa5ea3ac40dfbaa	If you mean, at four weeks pregnant should your stomach feel tighter, the answer is not really.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind, most women don't even know they're pregnant at four weeks.  Realization sets in usually sometime a bit after the first missed period.  With that said, you might feel a little tender, and perhaps a slight tightness in the abdomen at four weeks.  The more noticeable signs however, are breast tenderness and lack of menstrual period.  At four weeks the baby hasn't grown enough to really warrant any major tightening.  If your stomach has drastically tightenened inexplicably and you know you're pregnant, it would be best if you call your doctor and see what she would like you to do.

6e72fe5eaebe0f66961aa766d452c09faa	before we found out we are having twins we were going to get a silvercross one heres the link to the one we were going to get<br>  <a href="http://www.kiddicare.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/productdisplayA_417+105_10751_-1__29825_10001_" rel="nofollow">http://www.kiddicare.com/webapp/wcs/stor...</a><br>  <br>  i think it meets most of what you want|`|5ZvALiclaa	I take it you have a little one as well as one on the way? I would recommend the Phil and Teds  with the doubles kit. <br>  They are pricey but worth every cent as you will not need to buy another pram till the new baby is totallly out of a pram/stroller altogether. <br>  They are very lightweight and super easy to steer and push. Have a basket underneath, good canopy and your newborn lies really flat and the toddler attachment seat sits on front or at the back...hard to explain so here is the website.<br>  <a href="http://www.philandteds.com/index_home_freaked.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.philandteds.com/index_home_fr...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  The best thing about this pram is that it can convert so easily to a single or double and has 3 seating arrangements making it the most versatile pram i've seen. They aren't like the other single prams with the toddler seat attachments that sit on the front and make it unsteady and hard to push.<br>  Anyway, they are well worth checking out in person, you can click on the 'stockists' part at the bottom to find where you can get one from.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|NSqvbbEMaa	Do you want a double one? or are you going to have two pushchairs?|`|1VnWhP1Saa	take a look at the 'Stokke Xplory', I have one & it's an amazing piece of kit. As you do a lot of walking the Xplory is fab as it's much higher than normal prams so baby is away from traffic fumes, can see better, babba doesn't get bashed by shopping bags, also with the high seat it's pefect to reach table so no worries about trying to find highchairs etc...<br>  <br>  plus it really turns heads, am always getting comments from others about it. The dutch do have some fab ideas!!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.stokke-stroller.com/en%2Dgb/" rel="nofollow">http://www.stokke-stroller.com/en%2Dgb/</a><br>  <br>  got mine from ebay but two left feet are very good on prices|`|qCYa391Gaa	Hi,<br>  I used the Silvercross 3D which I personally thought was fab. I didn't want a bulky pushchair but I also wanted my baby to lie flat. It can look like a pram but then you lift everything off and it's a forward facing pushchair. Also the car seat can sit on top too. I have had a Graco travel system and I guess the Silvercross is a more deluxe purchase. (I prefer the Silvercross 3D)<br>  My daughter won't sit in a pushchair anymore for no more than the school run so if we have another child I think I'll get a buggy board for her to stand on if she's tired. Your age gap seems smaller than mine so like the other answers said you may want a twin buggy.<br>  Good luck with finding what you want and congrats on being pregnant!!<br>  Katy x<br>  P.S My friend has a twin buggy side by side rather than front and back seating and she thinks it's great, she's figured out what shops she can go in etc... so which ever you choose I'm sure you'll find your comfort zone and it's only for a short time x
0zkCGlNUaa	yes it is completly normal.<br>  i too am 6 weeks(second pregnancy)<br>  with my triplets, i had terrible morning sickness & pains for several months.<br>  with this pregnancy i have only had morning sickness twice.<br>  <br>  it changes from each pregnancy.<br>  <br>  good luck & congrats|`|LYSpHyjuaa	Hello, just answering your cry for help. <br>  I've had 3 pregnancies, and they were all sort of different, but not wildly so. If you are feeling very uneasy/anxious, pester your doctor/midwife/nurse. <br>  If they are the bossy, useless kind, do your best to switch to someone more sympathetic. <br>  Are you getting enough rest?|`|kQzPuoWxaa	yes this is fine just try and relax enjoy this time x|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Yup. Just remember that not every pregnancy is going to be the same.|`|PE0xr5TVaa	all completely normal - each pregnancy can be totally different.<br>  <br>  My midwife told me that EVERYTHING is normal for someone in pregnancy!  .... or maybe that was just a cop out!!<br>  <br>  totally normal though, don't worry yourself, just relax (as much as you can with two kids!) and enjoy it!

ACTa6N5Naa	Hey I have PCOS at the moment I am taking Vitex and been on for it 2 weeks and so far had no signs of it working! However, I have read it varies for everyone that tries it and I have read mixed reviews on the the internet neither staying strongly for or against it.  I have found from reports that Metformin will be more successful.  I am waiting to go to the hospital in March so not sure what they will recommend.  I would say speak to your doctor before you stop taking it.  Good luck!!
nvyDTvQdaa	Most def call the dr.  It seems like you could be going into labor.  36 weeks isnt very bad.  If the dr feels your baby is at a risk he can give you meds to stop the labor.  You need to call your dr and make sure that everything is ok.  Its better to be a pest then to be somone who losses their baby.  |`|e6guSlXRaa	If you are measuring 2 weeks large and are 36 weeks along i would not worry about the baby being under developed. it sounds like you might be in labor. at lease call them and see what they say. |`|F70Iy11laa	You should call your doctor and let him know whats going on.  They're doctors, they're there to be annoyed by your questions.  It happens to us all the time, and it doesn't bother us. |`|2XTlj4rAaa	Call the doctor. It cant hurt to give him a jingle, and this could be serious.|`|wkd5CMNaaa	Yes you should.  Anytime you have a concern call them, better to be safe then sorry right?<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I would call your doctor to be on the safe side. |`|b6d429b7c23a1fc4d1e4fa1657d4b9cbaa	Yes, call the Doctor.  If you don't you might regret it.|`|0fb96997ec3f9b08ceb1c9d030232838aa	Soonas|`|29ZL58Xjaa	Yeah I would go to the doctor or your OB/GYN. if you were a 1/2 cm dilated 2 weeks ago, it is possible that you're more effaced and dilated this week.  If you are not able to go and get your doctor or OB/GYN to check you out today, I would go to the emergency and have one of them check it out for you as it could be preterm labor, and you should be there ahead of time anyways incase of an imminent birth.  Also watch for the breakage of your water.|`|92cb2e2807fb24feda1bfaf27eb0bcccaa	Time to go see the OB!  You should discuss ANY pain with your OB.  It is possible you have already started labor.  Being 36 weeks if you have started labor, they will most likely not stop your labor.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|g0xjN9E6aa	You should call your doctor, you're not being a pest.. they'll want to reassure you and they can give you the best answer.|`|Ouhzs81kaa	Call your doctor. It is always best to check. You are not a pest, they get paid for this, remember?
AA11625215	Well if you had unprotected sex... then I say yes take one and then if its still negative then wait a couple of days and see how you feel.. sometimes not you or the physicians can tell until you are at least 5 weeks along.  and even if you have a period you might still be pregnant.|`|HKf8Z6Wqaa	It never hurts to take a test... I would just in case especially if you are taking medication you may want to consider testing again just in case you are pregnant so it won't do any harm to the baby.|`|j1Gvxryaaa	Well if you had unprotected sex, YES there is a possibility!<br>  Yes there is a possibility everytime you have sex but it is a higher risk if it is unprotected.<br>  It sounds to me like you may have a stomache bug, or possibly your hormones are just acting up.<br>  Try not to stress it, if your really worried, go to the doctors.
5b3cd64667a391942de231867c44d64caa	You can actually get the flu and have it not effect the baby - provided you take care of yourself and stick to what the doctor tells you to do. Please go to the doc and drink plenty of water until you get to see them.|`|9op65iQVaa	yea, the doctor will give u something for it that wont hurt the fetus.|`|fPX1lD8uaa	At 13 weeks my doctor told me I could take Sudafed, nose spray and cough drops.. (every doctor is different.. so ask your doctor what he suggests).  You should definately call your doctor to let him know your sick.. he may want to see you. |`|wXtqKFf8aa	Go to your OB, they know more about your pregnancy then your regular doctor. And she/he will prescribe something that won't hurt the baby. GL and get well soon.|`|Fm3L8vsYaa	id phone the doctors office yes & see what they say. just to be safe. its always better to be safe than sorry |`|sXBQLJTiaa	your doctor can give you medicine that wont hurt your baby. get well soon! =)|`|N9i5E366aa	Yes, please go to the doctor. I was told that I need to go to my PreNatal doctor for everything during pregnancy. If he needs to refer you out to another doctor, he'll/she'll tell you. This sickness is just as hard on you as it is the baby. The sooner you fix it, the better. You don't want it to develop into something worse. I hope you get better soon! Congrats on your pregnancy!
Z1e3Cxjoaa	Well as you get further along it will get worse.  I am 28 weeks with number 2 and I notice that just getting off the couch will put a lot of pressure down there...seems as though as soon as I get up she drops right down.  The stomach pains could be a combo of the way you and baby were laying.  Whenever I move to a different position i notice she will also adjust herself...they actually have equilibrium now and like to be in certain positions.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I went through that too and still am. I think it's just normal pains. I'm not sure what the pain next to the belly button is but I'm sure it's normal.
b02e1515d704ef86ee681760e4319eb0aa	Sounds like it, Congrats!<br>  My AF is due on the 9th but I just know I am preg<br>  You can test now and get a good result, if it's neg, retest after you miss your AF|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	VERY possible. Good luck!|`|aXESNuBKaa	possibly
RjpPzbBJaa	It is your choice. You are the mother, you have the right to decide whether or not to raise the child or not to raise it. The only "decision" he has to make is if you decide to put the child up for adoption, he will need to sign over his parental rights to the child.<br>  Unfortunately, he will not likely be involved with the child if he has made his feelings known about the adoption. Still, I would be honest with him and tell him your decision. Just be prepared for him to not want to be involved. You can do this alone, millions of women do it all the time (me included)<br>  Good Luck.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	Tell him that you are sorry but you can't hand your baby over to someone else and you want to raise your own baby even if he is not going to be in the picture.  Don't do it if you aren't comfortable with it- as long as you are able to provide for the baby you will be fine even if he has no part in it.|`|ZUAFl3toaa	Just be short and honest hon, it is your decision. Just say "Look.. I've changed my mind about the baby. I want to keep it. I love it. I want you to be involved, but that is your decision."|`|oq8F1qfUaa	the important thing is what you want..if you want to keep the baby, then keep him/her.if your guy doesnt want to get involved, leave him be.tell him how you feel and what you want.|`|oojO4WAraa	Forget about him being involved.  Do what is right for you and your child.  You cannot make him want to be involved.  He probably wants to go with adoption so he doesn't have to pay child support.|`|MtC3CWZraa	"I understand how you feel, but for an adaption to happen, we both have to agree to it. I'm not willing to do that."|`|q1Swxe3qaa	It is ultimately YOUR decision. You are the one carrying the baby. You have to remember that you cannot force someone to be a father though. If he doesnt want to be involved then you can't make him. I would just tell him that you changed your mind and you want to keep the baby and raise it. Tell him that you would love for him to be involved and let your child have a father. If he doesnt want to be involved then you can do it on your own. I know that sounds hard and scary but you can make it! If you know you want to keep the baby then I think you would regret giving it up for adoption.|`|lEOsagdkaa	isn't it great how much men have the say in their life as well...<br>  <br>  women with all the power...<br>  <br>  he is at your feet pretty much...you control everything<br>  <br>  one of the reasons I got myself a vasectomy BEFORE getting a girl pregnant<br>  <br>  edit..<br>  <br>  ya well I understand the concept..as unfair as I feel it is<br>  <br>  but look at it from a different perspective...maybe the condom broke, maybe she got him drunk and purposely got pregnant...maybe she lied to him...it is not uncommon<br>  maybe she stopped using birth control and didn't let him know<br>  <br>  I fully support the idea of him being "screwed" and deserving it if there was no protection used and he willingly did the deed<br>  <br>  but hey, my guess is he THOUGHT he wanted one, and changed his mind...which is a "sucks for you" situation<br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  (I am using this as a general statement and not directed towards the woman that asked the question)|`|AA11267703	No I am not putting up my child for adoption and you are responsible for the care of this child as well. You do not have to put your baby up for adoption if you do not want to. Do u have someone in your life you can confide in like your Mom or a Aunt someone older who you admire and trust? Go to them and let them help you work through this.|`|8eBg7mdCaa	if you want your child then keep it. but it is apparent he does not, so please do not have false expectations that he will be involved. seems pretty clear that he doesn't want to be.soooo...if you are keeping the child, you must have the mindset that you are a single parent and a single parent only.<br>  <br>  <br>  @@@edit wolf39@@@--to be fair wolf, he had all the say prior to having unprotected sex with someone he didn't want to have a child with.....but. i do think that he is being honest about his intentions now and this mommy will have to deal if she decides to keep it.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	You tell him that you changed your mind and are not going to give the baby up for adoption. Explain to him that you would like him to be involved but you have to understand that he may not want to be still. I wouldn't give your baby up if you don't want to though. You will regret it!|`|x2FciK4Faa	if he doesn't accept things like you do then maybe it would be best if he didn't get  involved to much because that would keep you both happy.|`|AA12357124	Hey.<br>  Just wanted to let you know that if he's not wanting to be involved and that you cant make him.
ge3meKYEaa	Call the doctors..........<br>  <br>  Possibilities?- your sick and getting fat?  Your PMSing and your period is late!  Or your pregnant- NO one answer until they do a blood test.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Most people have no early pregnancy symptoms. A few people have one or two. You have 7?<br>  <br>  Go see your doctor. You probably have a hormonal imbalance.<br>  <br>  Sorry to be blunt...but there are SO many people on here thinking that when you get pregnant you instantly have loads of symptoms, and it just isn't true!|`|159e15bc29abe3e551d868753b39f233aa	ALOT OF WOMAN test wrong. prolly tested wrong.|`|TQ5liuLsaa	well a blood test 2 weeks before period was to soon anyway,you should have been ovulating at that time.so it's still possible to be pregneant,and you may not have enough hcg in your system for urine test yet.If you've been having these symptoms for a week or more i'd say you should be able to test positive,but if it's only been a day or two you may need to wait longer and retest.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	If you had a blood test and home pregnancy test and they were all negative then you're not pregnant.

I love Lily.<br>  <br>  Emmeline is a sophisticated twist on Emily, and when I initially hear it, I think, "Ouch." Then, when I think of Emmeline as a real, actual name for a child, I think, "This really is a beautiful choice after all." So I don't really know. I suppose Emmeline actually is a worthwhile name.<br>  <br>  Olivia is like Lily.<br>  <br>  Charlotte is sweet and beautiful.<br>  <br>  Alora strikes me as a little strange. I love Laura, but Alora sounds like an overkill to me.<br>  <br>  Payton, for a girl, kind of, er, makes me want to retch. Many apologies. It's just that it's such a bulky, masculine name.<br>  <br>  ...<br>  <br>  I love James. Solidly masculine and utterly timeless!<br>  <br>  Oliver is one of my personal very favorite favorite choices. I love that it's classical and sophisticated, but, like James, solidly masculine. It is beautiful.<br>  <br>  I think Lucas is a lovely choice.<br>  <br>  Aiden is a gentlemanly and traditional alternative to Braden/Jaden/Haden/Laden etc. (no, I don't like the final name listed here).<br>  <br>  Conner is a charming combination of strong and cute.<br>  <br>  Andrew is timeless, handsome, and one-of-a-kind.<br>  <br>  You really have got great taste (I think). What can I say about Dylan that hasn't already been said about other boys' names here? Masculine ... handsome ... timeless ... etc. I'm running out of vocabulary!<br>  <br>  I like Nick, but only as a short form of Nicholas.<br>  <br>  My opinion of Ryan has been clouded by knowing some very messed-up Ryans, so I can't comment.<br>  <br>  I think Haden is one of the better -aden choices, but it still sounds plastic to me.<br>  <br>  ...<br>  <br>  I love most of the names you've got here. Good luck!|`|e7448a6086e42b7e080a788ebfc4b2c6aa	I love Aubrey and Ayden. But then again, I'm biased.

HlYiiTPRaa	Its hard to answer this one, because you just know!! with my first, I knew before my period was due, I had a constant smile on my face and I felt complete. It wasn't anything physical, but instictivly I knew I had another little life inside me, I also knew he was a boy. It is nothing I can explain. Ifyoufeel like this, there is a good chance you are pregnant, good luck. xx|`|m95QBoOAaa	i just knew cause i didnt feel right, i felt off a little, not like a bad thing, but with my first i thought i was dying of kidney failure! lol i was underweight working a ton of hours and not eating healthy at all! and totally missed that i had missed my period! and then i got a test at er said i was pregnant, with baby number 2 on the day i expected my period, i had a little spot in my undies, and for a week or so before coffee made me deathly ill! i knew then too, this time 3rd baby, i felt tired, moody and just not right, i took a test and boom i am due in january!~|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I don't really know.

I was on the pill and had not missed a day because I was so not ready for a baby. My grandma wanted to get our tero cards read I know really know why but she thought that it would be fun and the mother card kept coming up so she told my I was pregnant and then she told my grandma that her cards said that someone close to her is having a baby... That was a Fri and I went to the DR. the following Mon. and learned I was having a baby!!! Very crazy I know but I had so symptoms so even if you are not feeling anything you may be...

Its just this instinct.  Somehow, you just know.  Do you remember when you fell in love with your husband?  Remember that moment when you just KNEW he was the one?  There wasn't any particular physical feeling, it was just a gut feeling.  You just KNEW he was going to be the one you spent the rest of your life with.  Its that same kind of feeling when you know that you're pregnant.  At least, it was for me.  I had this gut feeling (with my first) that very night.  We made love and something just told me that that was it.  We were gonna be pregnant.  Sure enough, 2 weeks later I got the positive test result.
0LCJuBA8aa	yesss! lol im 4.5 wks too and ive been having morning sickness too. its not a sign a twins, everybody gets morning sickness at a different time. you could have twins but i dont think thats a sign because i have been having morning sickness early on during pregnancy and im a twin myself, not very likely im having twins =P some people never get morning sickness someget it bad, and it sometimes comes back during the third trimester. youre fine :) <br>  congrats! :)|`|LorcDzoxaa	i did with my first. I found out I was preg when I was maybe 2 weeks along, maybe 3 at most.

My grandmother had twins and she said her signs weren't any worst than when she had a single pregnancy. So I wouldn't get to excited about twins yet.

u43wh6q5aa	hi, i had an ectopic pregnancy 4 weeks ago and had pain in my left side and felt sick and light headed but the pain came and went but after 2 days of the pain it was getting worse so  i went 2 hospital and it was confirmed it was an ectopic, but symptoms can be different for different ppl, and the pain in ur shoulder is also a sign, u should take a pregnancy test, and if its positive see a doctor asap just to be on the safe side as ectopic pregnancy can put ur life in danger. good luck hope this helps.xxx
KNxs4PrZaa	relax, i know its so stressful and easy to worry, i do the same thing but really you will be fine.   my doctor assured me that after you see a heartbeat and healthy baby on an ultrasound there is a 95% chance that the baby will be born happy and healthy.  Misscairages mostly happen because the sperm or egg was not healthy and your body passed the pregnancy because it was not a viable fetus.  If you have already seen the baby and everything looked good then relax.  of course there are rare tragedies but they are few and far between and not worth losing sleep over.  as for the cramps they are sooo normal at that point, the baby is really starting to grow and your muscles are stretching to make room, take a deep breath and try to enjoy this special time.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I understand you worrying. I would probably too! But really it is normal to have mild cramping in pregnancy. It's all your ligaments stretching for the baby. It will be like that for the rest of your pregnancy. If you are still worried just call your doctor and check with them but it's normal. Good luck and congrats!|`|cnIzqEoDaa	Your chance of miscarrying was reduced A LOT once you got out of your first trimester. Most happen before 13 weeks. You will be fine, try not to stress. Congrats on your pregnancy!|`|oWAUb6vpaa	Relax, luv. Worrying is bad stress for you and the baby. Every week your chances of miscarriage decreases so let that piece of info help you to feel better. You had good results in ultrasound and heartbeat - those are great signs of a healthy baby. If doc had any concerns, they would let you know right now and it sounds like everything is fine. <br>  <br>  The slight cramping is caused by your uterus stretching as baby grows. You're16 weeks and baby is growing at a fast rate - your uterus will ache now and again thorugh the end of the pregnancy - that's supposed to happen - completely normal - take this as a sign of baby's healthy growth. I'm on pregnancy #3 and felt that with each one. As long as the pain is not unbearable, you're fine. If it does get bad, call doc's office and they'll tell you what they would want you to do. <br>  <br>  (Oh, and 17 weeks is still a little early to properly determine the sex of the baby - many attempts are wrong at this gestational age due to the fact that the genitals haven't completely formed into male or female parts at this stage. Determination will still be 50/50 accuracy. 20 weeks gestational age is more accurate.) <br>  <br>  Congratulations, mom!|`|eytlIKITaa	Just because you had one mc doesn't mean you'll mc this one.  Don't worry about it too much!  You're 16 weeks!  Just relax...  Some cramping is totally normal-  Good luck!|`|Ed7qNFdzaa	you sound fine to me. noticable (but basically painless) cramping is normal through out pregnancy...your body has a lot of stretching and growing to do, worrying every time you feel something is uneccessary. unless its painful or your bleeding, assume you are fine and don't expect problems, you are just causing yourself undo stress otherwise.
WRysBCqCaa	If you're having sex there is always a possibility you may be pregnant. And if he won't wear a condom tell him you won't have sex. Do you know how many nasty diseases he could have? Condoms are essential, if he's not mature enough to wear a condom, he's not mature enough to have sex. <br>  Get on the pill girl. |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Yes because there is always pre-*** and that can still get you pregnant. Your best bet to not get pregnant is to wait to have sex until you are ready for the consequences. |`|AA11248635	Yes.  The pre ejaculate.  That's what comes out of him without him feeling it.|`|AA11015896	Duh YES that is how you make a baby!|`|w7FSmSTnaa	YES!!! my best friend got pregnant that way only had intercourse one time with a guy no condom and no ejaculation. Intercourse was on for a few min's and she got preg. ur only 16??? you really need to be protecting ur self from preg. and most of all s.t.d's and h.i.v|`|fb76868a0fd6a6906fe3b40bc9a4aad7aa	If you don't know the answer to this you shouldn't be having sex.<br>  <br>  Yes you can get pregnant and if you're stupid enough to have sex without a condom then use the pill. At least that way you won't get pregnant although by the sounds of the preferences of your BF he's already been around a bit and your at high risk of catching something far more nasty!

2ZoUduoPaa	Just think, in the "olden" days, there were no hospitals, no midwives.  When it became time to deliver, you delivered.  Sure there were cases where the baby and/or mother did not survive, but it's the same today in a hospital.  Sure their chances for survival are higher, but there is still a chance for any fatalities.  <br>  <br>  I have to disagree with the individual who said it was child abuse.  Everything now constitutes child abuse--don't whip you children, that's child abuse; don't have your child in the comfort of your own home, that's child abuse.  Whipping your child for any wrong doing is not child abuse.  Choosing to have your child at home is not child abuse.  <br>  While I do not agree with abortions, it amazes me that we want to allow women to make that choice for themselves, but we can't allow them to make the choice as of WHERE to deliver.  Sorry, but that one just confuses me...<br>  <br>  I'm 33weeks and 4 days pregnant with my first child.  I'm very highly "ALLERGIC" to pain, and do not want to deliver without pain medication.  I just personally couldn't do it.  <br>  The women who choose freebirthing--bless you--are braver than I am.  While it would be in the best interest of the mother and child to have a midwife, or some trained professional at the birth, it's all a matter of choice and opinion.<br>  <br>  If I were brave enough, I think it would be a wonderful experience.  But I would have someone on standby--just in case!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|AA11061445	while many women have done it and years ago it was normal with complications around today i would not risk it.<br>  my friend lost her baby 3 weeks ago she went into labour at home ,<br>  had no intentions of having a home birth and the baby was born dead,<br>  the cord had been wrapped round the neck causing death<br>  had she been able to get there in time he would of survived,<br>  |`|mBeGdFO2aa	Equivialent to Child Abuse.  Absolutely ridiculous to choose that scenario.|`|wBpennsMaa	They are doing nothing but putting themselves and their unborn baby at risk. And being ignorant-because we do have healthcare. |`|uEo0vS7aaa	Yeah, I watched it last night. I Really thought that the birth of the Co woman's child was going to end badly. I kept wanting to turn the channel to something else, but then thought if this ended in tragedy that wouldn't be showing her story. The only person Out of the 3 that I felt was in a good position for this was the woman from Australia. She was not in a lot of pain and eased into having the baby. The lady from London-I thought that she would be alright, but I was still concerned.<br>  <br>  OH HECK NO, I would not have my children through Free-birthing. I am like you. At a minimum at least have a midwife there in case something happened.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I watched it. I think that with all the dangers and stuff that can happen I could never do it. I think that woman from Colorado Springs was an idiot. She knew something could happen and still went along with it. Thankfully for her baby everything was okay but how could you put your baby at risk like that? I see how they wanted to have a wonderful experience but in my opinion my baby's health and my own is a little more important.  I would never do it and I wouldn't agree with anyone doing it but it's not my choice it's theres. What was your opinion?|`|YduxkI5waa	I think Freebirthing is ridiculous. You are putting yourself and unborn child at risk for alot of things. Most mothers are not mid-wifes or doctors and can not do anything in an emergency situation. If you feel you want to give birth at home thats fine but at least have a trained professional like a mid wife there to help you and your child. |`|50e0975b0e8c470ea8e974086f449b63aa	I think as a mother you wants what you want when that time comes. But you need to do it in a safe way. If you have a plan talk it over with your OB or midwife and ask that they respect your plan unless you or baby is in trouble. <br>  <br>  But the girl who went to the ER cus she didn't past her placenta made me down right mad...<br>  <br>  |`|q8tUfflyaa	I watched it, and I was honestly relativly angry! A home birth is one thing, and getting medical attention and if there are no problems with the pregnancy then okay yeah maybe a freebirth is okay. But that one woman who had the placenta issue after the birth...what the hell was she thinking! She could have had placenta previa and still decides to go through with the freebirth. She could have killed herself, or even worse her child! Ugh! stupid! |`|iHvOJQ4zaa	negligent.|`|3e379b57ba770c0a315cfe12dbeeea34aa	i d be scared.What if something goes wrong?|`|znkumaA1aa	It's really ironic how  a woman from the show needed to defend her decisions after safely giving birth to a perfectly healthy baby at home.The choices that women make in hospitals often leave babies in NIC units, unable to breastfeed, premature, and injured. I think that giving your baby drugs during labor and/or not giving him the opportunity to be born normally is what we should see women trying to defend. Why do you hospital mommies allow such risky things to be done to you and your babies?<br>  Homebirth, unassisted or not, is safer than hospital birth for normal healthy women. Hospital interventions are what usually make birth unsafe. I'm not sure why women haven't realized this yet...nothing goes wrong until you get to the hospital. Women who birth at home are usually very prepared and have done the necessary research and care to ensure the best possible outcome. <br>  I think admiration is more appropriate in each woman's situation. Admire them and figure out how you can give birth in two hours, without drugging you and your baby, and without violence. Homebirth mommies rock (assisted or not) :)|`|Fych4Bbfaa	I didn't have placenta previa. The placental noises were low, and that worried me. But low placental noises aren't a sign of placenta previa. The main signs of placenta previa are bleeding problems and pain, and I had no bleeding or pain throughout my pregnancy at all. If I had, I'd have had an ultrasound (which is the only way placenta previa can be diagnosed). Ultrasounds aren't even covered by a lot of insurances without a medical reason such as high-risk pregnancy or unexplained pain or bleeding.<br>  <br>  I wasn't rude to the doctor. I told the nurse that I didn't want an IV until after I was examined, and I was very polite to her. I was also polite to the doctor in telling him that I wanted to know what my options were and then decide how to proceed. I have the right to informed consent, and exercising that right isn't rude. Moreover, when you're a professional, you shouldn't be rude to a patient who has come in asking for your help. <br>  <br>  Children all over the world witness birth and have for centuries. I've never once heard of anyone being psychologically scarred by witnessing birth. Family share each other's joys and pains. If anything had gone wrong my son could have been taken to a neighbor's immediately to protect him.<br>  <br>  It's not child abuse to freebirth. People all over the world and throughout time gave birth that way. There are HUGE differences between now and 100 years ago, between America and third world countries. Here, women are educated, well-nourished, not overworked, have access to adequate shelter and clean water, and live in sanitary conditions. Emergency health care is a phone call away. It wasn't like that a hundred years ago, and it's not like that in third world countries. Why would we prosecute women for exercising their right to bodily integrity? So, women can have abortions, but they can't chose where to give birth and how? <br>  <br>  Most women chose homebirth because the interventions that occur in the hospital can be dangerous. Epidurals aren't risk-free. Epidurals can slow your labor, causing you to need pit and amniotomy, which increases the baby's risk of fetal distress, which would require a C-section, which comes with higher risks to the mother (death, bleeding) and to the baby (death, breathing problems). It's worth those risks in serious emergencies, but it's not worth those risks in normal births that become complicated due to intervention.<br>  <br>  I had an epidural with my first son, and I screamed just as loud in that hospital as I did on my own bed in my own home. At least at home no one was telling me to shut up or waiting to take my son and poke him with needles.<br>  <br>  If a woman begins bleeding she can take herbs (which are very potent and powerful and have been used for centuries) like Shepherd's Purse and Motherwort to slow the bleeding until help arrives. The cord is actually around the neck 1/3 of the time, and most of the time, it's no big deal. It doesn't cut off the baby's oxygen unless it's very tight. You unwind or cut the cord off and continue delivering. If the baby isn't breathing you stimulate the baby, then begin neonatal resuscitation, and usually, the baby perks up rather quickly. It's very rare for babies to die in childbirth these days, even at home without an attendant. Most babies aren't too large to come out, and in the case of a woman who has delivered a baby vaginally before and isn't measuring overly large, it's extremely unlikely that shoulder dystocia would occur. Less than 4% of babies are breech at birth, and you can determine the baby's position inside the womb simply by feeling the womb. It's easy to tell if a baby is head down or not just by using your hands; I learned from midwives how to do it.<br>  <br>  What's wrong with going to the Labor & Delivery ward for not passing a placenta? We'd waited six hours, and in that time, we'd tried pushing, massaging the belly and applying pressure, gently pulling the cord, nipple stimulation and breastfeeding, and nothing helped.Sometimes the placenta simply does not come out, and someone has to retrieve it manually. It's not an emergency--hence why I didn't go to the emergency room, but to a L&D ward. I did the right thing to prevent myself from having an infection. It also meant that the baby was examined immediately after the birth, which I consider to be a good thing. He was and still is very healthy.<br>  <br>  Don't believe everything you see on TV. It's easy to cut footage so that what someone says is taken out of context and its meaning twisted. It's easy to exaggerate and sensationalize people's stories on TV. Also, don't judge somethiing until you really understand it.<br>  <br>   Please remember that death occurs even in the hospital. Less than 1% of births occur at home, and less than 5% of those have serious complications. Yet our national mortality rate is still very high...I wonder why. Clearly it's not because of freebirthers and homebirthers.|`|AA11117186	I think birthing at home is dangerous, but it can work out. We have to remember that medicine, doctors, and midwives have not always been around. A lot of women delivered their own babies and they and the baby did fine. I just won't take the chance though. We are blessed to have the technology to let us know if something is wrong with the baby during labor (like slowing heartbeat, etc.) so I think we should use it. |`|8gyNAuRjaa	This question is being posed in a few different forums. Here's my post on another board:<br>  <br>  I’m glad that this documentary is airing and expanding the conversation on birth choices. Unassisted birth may not be for everyone. That does not mean that it is not safe. Most families PLAN to give birth at home unassisted, doing months of research and preparation. The woman has a "low-risk, normal" pregnancy. Many women seek competent prenatal care (whether if be from a doc or midwife that are unaware of her plans) and they make informed choices about their care. These women trust their bodies and its innate ability to give birth.<br>  <br>  What's most amazing to me is that so many women don't prepare for their births putting all of their trust in their medical providers. This happens because we aren't taught to trust our bodies. Sadly, the US has one of the highest maternal and infant mortality rates in the world despite the fact that we use more technology than any other country. The countries with the best outcomes for mother and baby use midwives that do many of their births at home.<br>  <br>  So much technology is used in birth despite the fact that ACOG's position on most of it is that it doesn't do anything to improve outcomes. Women should be outraged by the fact that so much of what is commonly practiced in hospitals has less to do with the safety of mom and baby and more to do with protecting the hospital/docs from being sued, putting them and their babies lives at risk. Look at our c-section rate. Many doctors opt for this even though it's major abdominal surgery that puts a woman's life more at risk than a vaginal delivery (even after a previous c-section). It's really sad on both sides because the docs aren't trained in what a "normal" birth looks like and they're understandably afraid of putting their livelihoods at risk which influences their standard of care. It puts them in a really bad position.<br>  <br>  I envision a society where women and their families relearn to trust their bodies, where pregnancy and birth is treated as the sacred rite of passage that it is (not an illness that needs to be managed/treated), and families are strengthened by women who are truly nurtured and supported through their pregnancies. Birth can be an empowering and healing experience. There's so much info available at our fingertips. Do a search on your engine of choice and you'll see that a safe birth can happen in nearly any setting. I chose to have my first baby at home with a midwife attending. It was a beautiful, empowering experience with no complications where my husband actually “caught” our baby. I am having an “unassisted” birth with my second. I decided to get prenatal care from my midwife who will be on “standby” a couple miles away. That’s my choice and I respect the next woman’s right to give birth in the way she chooses.|`|QhzwTj4xaa	I'm for the mother picking what is best for her, but no midwife or doctor, that can be dangerous for the mother and the unborn child.<br>  <br>  I believe in being prepared to handle the worst after my pregnancies!<br>  <br>  1st and 2nd natural, second child had shoulder displacia. <br>  3rd unplanned emergency c-section, my heart rate plummetted after my little girl moved back into the uterus from the birth canal! Waiting any amount of time could have killed us both, then my boys would have had no Mommy!|`|F6hI80hgaa	It's STUPID!  What would happen if the baby was too large to come out, or the cord was wrapped around the babies neck.  It would die.  And the MOTHER and FATHER would be at fault for killing their kid.  Theres also the issue of the Mother bleeding to death after the birth.  I cannot believe someone would want to put themseves or their child at such a risk JUST so they can have the baby without ANY medical help from people that KNOW what they are doing.|`|QKq6OBDpaa	to risky and even if there is a doubt you will have to put your baby through test to make sure nothing went wrong have a midwife at least what is the baby went into destress?????<br>  oh no i think it would be to chancy.... what if the baby was breech???<br>  <br>  i think i will stick with a midwife|`|kgSBcnRaaa	Risky for the mother and baby.

sMSXWPWgaa	There is no sure way to avoid pregnancy if you don't want to use any form of contraception without just ....not having sex!<br>  <br>  pulling out...doesn't work<br>  on your period...doesn't work<br>  upside down...doesn't work!<br>  <br>  oh  and never forget STD's... no condom, risk every time of something that could kill you, make you sterile, give you incurable warts, or just make you itch like hell... no other contraception protects against these (apart from the female condom, although this is definitely not 100%.)<br>  <br>  If you are 100% sure you wont get any, then you can try other contraception methods such as:<br>  have the coil (IUD) inserted by a medical professional - but if you don't want hormones, make it clear- some have hormones (IUS) to make them more effective and the ones that don't have these hormones can make your periods heavier, longer and sometimes more painful.<br>  If you don't mind hormones, get the IUS, its more effective and doesn't have as many side effects<br>  Or the injection (once every 8-12weeks)<br>  Or the patch (once a week)<br>  You can use a Cap or a female condom. Both no hormones, both take practice!|`|65baadde1a27b20964ccb07ad83092e0aa	DON'T HAVE SEX!!!!

vue9NOhYaa	An OBGYN is a doctor.  She's a doctor who specializes in women's reproductive health issues.<br>  <br>  Most family doctors/GPs do not handle pregnancy, labor and delivery any more. If yours does (seems likely if the doctor is still handling your prenatal care), then no, you don't need another doctor. (If  you should develop complications beyond your GPs abilities, she would let you know, and probably recommend a doctor.)  If you would prefer to see a specialist, that is your right too.  Again, you could ask your GP for a recommendation, or ask friends/family for advice.  You might opt for an OB, or a midwife.|`|LXc9tGJVaa	An obgyn deals in Obstetrics-it means Obstetrics Gynecologist (baby doctor). That is the kind of doctor you should have for your pregnancy; he or she will do internal exams/set up Ultrasound appts. and belly checks, etc. And you will have your bloodwork administered by them, or they will be the ones who refer you to the hospital for bloodwork. Also, your Obgyn will be the person delivering your baby. You can still keep a regular doctor for when you get a cold or have other health problems and whatnot, but you do need an obgyn-they specialize in pregnancy and delivering babies. Just call around to obgyns in the phone book and meet with them to pick the one you like best, or ask your doctor if he or she recommends any. Good luck and congrats on your pregnancy :)|`|Tm1Rpfq4aa	You need an OBGYN.  They specialize in pregnancy, womans health and delivering a baby.  Look in the phone book and pick one or ask a friend who they used.  Call and make an appointment, but yes, you need an OBGYN.  You have the 1st ultrasound on your 1st visit to your OBGYN.  I have never heard of a woman going to a general practioner for baby/pregnancy care.|`|MtC3CWZraa	Most women have an OBGYN oversee their entire pregnancy. The only exception I know (assuming you aren’t going the midwife route) is that in some rural areas, OBGYNs are nonexistent. Family practitioners handle everything.<br>  <br>  An OBGYN is a doctor trained specifically in women’s reproductive health. If given the choice, I’d want one over a general/family practitioner. |`|ixD2RnqTaa	Hi, an ob specializes in delievering babies, you can ask your doctor if they have anybody they recomend. you can also look online for your area. I suggest you do get an ob.|`|WAn9sBc5aa	First an OBGYN is a doctor, they are the ones that deliver babies. But you must have a OBGYN or Midwife to when you have a baby, well you don't have to but I would advise it.  If you are not seeing a OBGYN or midwife you can find one by asking the DR you are seeing now and they will recomend one or you can ask your insurance company or do it you self ;use google map and type in your city and state then OBGYN;  OBGYN specialize in womens parts and most of all babies. They have had special training in delivering, and other stuff.  You usually get a 6-8, 12 and 20 week scan. Any beyond or before that is up to the OBGYN. I have had lots with my children being high risk.  |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I think that you should see a obgyn because they specialize in pregnancy. You don't need to speak to your physician about it just find an obgyn or women's clinic in your area. I don't think you should get an ultrasound until around 20 weeks or so unless you had one at the beginning to determine your due date. I also know that if you have certain birth defects that run in your family around 15 weeks they'll do an ultrasound to scan for that. But every pregnancy is different. Good luck and congrats.|`|flz4jsPyaa	yes you need a obgyn. and a doctor the obgyn knows everything about the pregnancy and what is normal they are there to take care of you and the baby. your regular doctor knows some but not everything. if you have a problem your Doctor will send you to the obgyn. the obgyn delivers the baby not your family doctor unless they 2 are a obgyn. my last pregnancy i had a doctor who was also a obgyn i saw him through everything and delivery. my first pregnancy i had 2 doctors.  good luck and enjoy your pregnancy and don't do to much be stress free as much as possible. stress is bad for the baby. sending you huggs. please read the link and watch the new show the doctors it will be your best thing for questions for everything during your pregnancey|`|fPX1lD8uaa	Yes, you need an OB/GYN, not a family doctor to go to throughout your whole pregnancy.  They will be both doctors to you until you've delivered your baby.. if you get sick, call your ob/gyn to ask what you should take not your family doctor.  <br>  <br>  You could ask your family doctor who he/she recommends as an ob/gyn and call them or ask around to see who some of your friends like... but your going to need to do it very soon.|`|8AYVU9Fcaa	you probably do need an obgyn. just ask her if she will be delivering the baby if she says no then tell her you dont have an obgyn and ask her if she could refer you to someone. oh and btw congratulations!!!!!! I have a 16 month old and a 4 month old. You can e-mail me or message me on yahoo if you have any more questions :)|`|L1Yr96nRaa	I don't know about a obgyn? <br>  I'm in England, its midwives and doctors? Call me stupid if its the same thing.<br>  But you should have been scheduled for your first scan already, its usually be 12 weeks you have it done. Bring it up at your next appointment.<br>  Good luck =]|`|iOSEVRPPaa	Most general practitioners will not deliver a baby, so yes, you need an OBGYN or a midwife.<br>  |`|JUk8Hih0aa	You will only really need an OBGYN. I never saw my regular doctor while being pregnant. Good luck and congratulations!|`|53230fb8aba68f5dc1c2f0deae4d3e15aa	Definitely get an OBGYN and if you don't know where to look ask your health insurance provider.  Every provider has a list of doctors (of all types) that accept your insurance.  You don't want to choose a doctor and come out out pocket for most of the costs.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Some general practitioners can see you the entire pregnancy, but it is much more common to see an OBGYN. You should probably be seeing one anyway for regular yearly exams, etc. <br>  <br>  You could get referrals for one or ask friends/family who they have experience with. Then call and ask if they're seeing new patients. Typically between 18-20 weeks they'll do a routine ultrasound. 
51c630d2077575e1632a2e1e3c48af23aa	I believe the evidence shows that this is more of a cultural and health issue. There are a large number of factors affecting fertility and an a bunch of them are related to nutrition and lifestyle. Example: stress causes a major decrease in sperm production and viability. Result: lower fertility rates. Just look at the Japanese. They have a very low birth rate and are actually decreasing in population. They statistically have the least amount of sex of any industrialized nation and also have an amazingly high death rate from stress related issues. <br>  Clothing choices affect fertility (boxers versus briefs).<br>  cultural stigma: is sex an acceptable recreational activity? Are contraceptives essential every time you do it? I tend to find that the minority communities in the US do it more often with less frequent protection resulting in more kids than any white people I've ever met.|`|Ha4IxpFkaa	I think people of Asian descent are the most fertile race (example, China). Just my opinion.|`|74530f1c293522b59e9e263928bd2299aa	I think race has nothing to do with fertility.  Genetics might be though.  I am white, and very fertile... sometimes folks bring race into things that should not be.  There are just as many black and Hispanic women out there who are unable to conceive too, and wishing they could and seeing fertility doctors.  And the HIV thing is not a race thing either.  HIV is out there for all unprotected sex, no matter what race we are|`|694fb2aff6ccdf840b93a96972cbdd24aa	whites just generally have the money to afford fertility clinics!

Jj0pdpWIaa	Sounds like it to me.Maybe he or she will be musical just like Mom.That's awesome.|`|hJwheleJaa	Definitely! Most of the time when I sing to my baby he starts wiggeling! Books say it's good to read to them and sing to them because it stimulates them. |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Yeah I noticed when I listen to music and sing mine starts moving around. |`|Ol2S1ZiMaa	Yup! That's very common!|`|XEWcgYTwaa	Could be! There is one song that I listen and sing to and whenever it comes on, my little boy won't stop moving in my belly... I love it!|`|ntFwCIcKaa	yes - hearing is one of the first senses developed in the womb. Keep playing. Your baby will remember the sounds when he/she is born.|`|tSZFmmnXaa	Your bub loves your music! :D<br>  <br>  I think it's possible! |`|01vMpHkWaa	yep<br>  my baby started to respond around 17 weeks|`|RE6GBw0Baa	aww hunni how cute.<br>  <br>  im sure it could be, bless a little boogie baby xxxxxx
zcEpnjlRaa	i was 66 Kg before pregnancy and now weigh 85 KG apparently this is good LOL!!! i put on my first lot of weight at 20-24 weeks as i lost around 7 KG in the first 15 weeks and put this back on by 20-24 weeks, the main weight gain was in weeks 30-36 ,<br>  <br>  <br>  xxx|`|nv8sVAhAaa	10 - 12 kilos is average weight gain throughout the whole pregnancy.<br>  <br>  With my first son I put on 9 kgs in the 1st  20 weeks then for the whole pregnancy I only put on 11.5 kgs (that was due to strict diet and I had Gestational Diabetes and he weighed 4 lb 4 oz)<br>  <br>  With my 2nd son I put on 9 kgs in total (he weighted 8 lb 7oz - I didn't have Gestational Diabetes with him)<br>  <br>  So goes to show that every pregnancy is different and b4 ever being pregnant I was 68 kgs and after my 2nd son I am still at 74 kgs and I am only 158cm tall - so I am short as well)<br>  <br>  So don't stress too much about weight gain unless your doctor advises you to watch your weight as my doctor did with me when I was pregnant with my first son<br>  <br>  Good Luck and I hope the remainder of your pregnancy goes well |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I'm 20 weeks pregnant too and I weighed 100 pounds pre-pregnancy. I don't know how much I've gained up until now but on October 28th I had an appointment and I weighed 117. So I'm sure it's A LOT more by now. My doctors said that I haven't gained too much but that I needed to I guess because I was under weight before I got pregnant. I don't even look like I've gained that much though so that's nice. I'm sure if you had gained too much your doctor would say something to you about it. |`|OTxpcDX6aa	I was 140, 5'4" when I found out I was pregnant at 8 weeks. We guess that I gained about 5 pounds from my "prepregnancy weight" but can't be sure. At my 20 week appointment I was 155, so that's a weight gain of 15-20 pounds by week 20. My doctor said that was just fine, but not ideal, for my size (she would have liked it to be about 5 pounds less). That said, no one can tell I've even gained weight except my perfectly round bump, so I feel okay about it. Since then, now at almost 25 weeks, I've gained 5 more pounds. |`|ZOQnUQGsaa	everyone is different I am now 30 weeks and at my last check up (at 28 weeks) I was 124lbs and had gained 12lbs from my starting weight of 112.  I wouldn't worry about it it sounds like you are healthy which is a recipe for a healthy baby!<br>  <br>  This is my second pregnancy with my first I gained weight more rapidly, i'm just on my feet more this time around and probably burn more calories than I did with my first.<br>  <br>  Just make sure you stay active and a well rounded diet and you'll be fine!|`|tTwzDyIRaa	kinda depends on the person, i don't think that's too much ...and if your doctor thought so, he/she would have said something to u...im 22 weeks pregnant and haven't gained anything, iv actually lost weight...but shes growing the way she should be and everything is fine ...but im not going to complain cuz i was heavier in the first place haha..so no weight gain so far is good for me :)...good luck and congrats on the lil one :)|`|gfohoYOyaa	Everyone is different.  I am tall and gained 20 lbs by week 20!  It was really scary, but your body is going to put on what it needs to.  It sounds to me like you are doing just fine.  Good luck.|`|WsEFCpemaa	I am 21 weeks and I am down 25 pounds.|`|cPajMNbtaa	Distribution of weight gain<br>  An ideal pregnancy weight gain starts with the addition of seven to 10 pounds in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy. Subsequently, during the second half of the pregnancy, you would gain around a half pound to a pound each week.<br>  Wondering where all those extra pounds are going? Here's how the weight gain is ideally distributed:<br>  Baby:   7 pounds<br>  Placenta:   1 pound<br>  Amniotic fluid:   2 pounds<br>  Blood volume:   4 pounds<br>  Body fluids:   3 pounds<br>  Uterus:   2 pounds<br>  Breasts:   1 pound<br>  Fat & protein storage:   7 pounds<br>  What if you are gaining more or less than the recommendations?<br>  The amount of weight you gain is important. Although many women worry that they are gaining too much, your practitioner will probably be more concerned if you are not gaining enough. Poor weight gain increases the chances that the baby will not get adequate nutrition or grow properly. Excess weight gain is not usually a medical problem, although it may increase your chance of needing a cesarean. The biggest negative about gaining too much weight is that it may be depressing to contemplate trying to lose those pounds after the baby is born. Many women who gain excessive weight during pregnancy are never able to get back to their pre-pregnancy weight. Rapid weight gain, more than four pounds in a week, can be a sign of severe fluid retention from pre-eclampsia. If you notice rapid weight gain, discuss this with your practitioner.<br>  |`|SKhYePwUaa	I dont know what exactly I had gained by 20 weeks, I know that At 26 weeks I had gained a total of 14lbs.. My friend is 24 weeks and has gained about 25lbs.. each pregnancy is different if you feel you may have gained to much talk to your dr or see if your eating a lot of "bad" foods.. but seems about average to me|`|IPl3Yh1kaa	Honestly, I had gained next to nothing. Maybe 8 lbs. But it did not matter because by the end (which is coming in 9 DAYS!!!) I have gained the proper 27-30 lbs.<br>  <br>  Most women look the same by the end of pregnancy and even the ones that are fearful (like me) that they will put on too much weight end up putting on the right amount.<br>  <br>  Drink your water, walk, get as much sleep as you can, snack on the good stuff. That's all you can do<br>  <br>  Good luck :-)|`|C55pji5Qaa	I have gained 19 pounds and am almost 19 weeks with twins. I am almost small framed. I think you are fine, if you are eating healthy then I would not worry!|`|hJwheleJaa	You are doing fine. Everyone is different. Some people even lose weight at first! By 20 weeks I had gained 18 lbs! I just gained it mostly at first and then it started to level off. Now I'm almost 34 weeks and right where I should be with gaining. |`|wBpennsMaa	By 20 weeks I had only gained 1 lb. However by 22w4d that was up to 7 lbs. <br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: Pre-pregnancy I weighed 111 lb at 5 feet 4 inches.|`|en5e64Puaa	I only gained about 10 lbs by 20 weeks, but I was sick a lot...<br>  <br>  You seem to be doing great!!!

fb83cf0d9efbb8c23d7795e6536ba9e0aa	first off, they are not symptoms, but signs.  pregnancy is not a disease or illness<br>  <br>  nausea and fatiigue are signs of early pregnancy.<br>  <br>  fatigue doesn't usually come until second trimester, but it's not unheard of to be an early sign, same for hunger (not hungryness)<br>  <br>  bloating and headaches can also be signs of pregnancy, but backpain doesn't come until you start showing usually because the backpain usually occurs from putting on weight.  usually.<br>  <br>  neckpain doesn't really sound much like pregnancy<br>  <br>  but cramps does a little.<br>  <br>  but sore throat has nothing to do with pregnancy...just dry throat if you're waking up with it.<br>  <br>  but the main question is, are you sexually active and have you missed your period.<br>  <br>  it mostly sounds like stress<br>  but i would go to your doctor or local health department for a pregnancy test.|`|hswTS1jVaa	Could be, but could be other things too. You need to take a test to find out for sure.|`|yznZqcznaa	I have not heard of a sore throat being a sign of pregnancy.  It is a sign that you are sick.|`|c9dZEY8gaa	you might be but there is always the chance that your just about to start your period. Have you had unprotected sex? You should probably go and see a doctor Good Luck and May God Bless You.|`|Gqs6H0Z0aa	I have all those symptoms too, but I am not pregnant, just sick. Take a test.|`|U0iqktu8aa	try taking a test... |`|eVTsGsCWaa	You won't know if you are until you take the test.

f917ecaa58105d18c93396f2c027b772aa	In OB/GYN, it's generally said that one will deliver within 2 weeks before and 2 weeks after an Estimated Date of Delivery. So, loosely about a month. Within that time frame, you'll be considered to be on time. <br>  <br>  Sometimes a good ultrasound will change the EDD, looking at the size, length and maturity of the bones, etc, they can age the fetus. It will likely be more accurate except in the case of large fetuses (from families where people are really tall and heavy). <br>  <br>  So, though, they can get into the ball park, a direct hit shouldn't be expected. In that last month, it pays to be cautious, like driving less (especially long distances), being alone less in isolated areas, etc.|`|kcGFK36Waa	December 3rd because I'm pretty sure you've had ultrasounds, and you alone can't change your due date without doctor approval. But don't worry baby will come out when ever he/she feels like it. |`|tj0X2YaYaa	Either way it doesn't really matter.  Due dates are total estimates and the baby could come three days early, three days late, three weeks early, or two weeks late (I think that's all the longer they'll let you go.)  So go by whichever you'd rather, but remember that it's just an estimate anyway.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Probably theirs just because I'm sure that they've done ultrasound and they can go off of those as well. And since you are so close I'm sure they would've picked up on it. |`|EXlUcJf1aa	Does your chart have a clear ovulation date?  I would go from that date to determine EDD.|`|Ir3uRLjHaa	nov. 29
otISju7Faa	Nothing really helps to much, you kinda just have to deal, it sucks horrible....my 1st pregnancy it wasn't as bad cause I could at least come home and sleep but this pregnancy I have my other kid to take care of and my fiancee is working a million hours b/c we just bought a house so I am always tired!!!  If I take my prenatal vitamins like I am supposed to and drink lots of fluids and don't lay around an extreme amount I found that I had more energy.  I am 30 weeks now and I will have my bouts of tiredness, pregnancy is only 40-42 weeks long at least it doesn't last forever!  Good Luck!|`|L42LJ1P4aa	In my first trimester I was very exhausted and spent most of the time in my bed. Not only was I exhausted, I was very sick. I had all day sickness! And so I had to keep a bucket by my bed at all times because I would seriously open my eyes and feel the need to throw up. Everything got better for me at the ending of the first trimester (12 weeks). I've felt very energetic throughout this second trimester.. I'll be going on my third in 2 weeks and a few days.|`|ZErpLwQUaa	I get so tired that if my husband doesn't wake me up, I won't wake. He sometimes joke and say he checks my pulse when I sleep so much. its fine, you have to get your rest. you body needs to adjust to the new hormones it is now feeling and absorbing. I say drink lots of iced water, no caffeine and girl sleep it off...God bless<br>  <br>  |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I went through that for like the first 12 weeks I'd say. I still go through it every now and then but not as bad. I hope things get better for you. |`|MtC3CWZraa	Most every pregnant woman has that problem in the first trimester. There's no fix for it except time because the baby has to leach your energy until the placenta develops and takes over supporting him/her around the end of the 1st. <br>  <br>  It sucks, but we've all been there and you just have to push through it. |`|XHeiEgF1aa	I am 11 weeks and I sleep at least 12 hours a night and still take naps and just feel so exhausted and like I Can't do anything. I even get very carsick feeling just from walking around. It's driving me nuts! I need my energy back! 
a7viAde5aa	I had really bad headaches in the beginning of my pregnancy too. <br>  And yes you can only take tylenol. <br>  I would get in bed and make it really dark. Drink lots of water. <br>  And hope it goes away. That's all I can say. Mine were almost unbearable. Sometimes cold cloths on my head helped.  good news is they went away at some point.|`|GFaPBv67aa	a warm cloth helps a lot|`|tivpa7Vlaa	i had the same thing early on (now36wks) and i couldn't really shake it. all that worked for me was some sleep with the shades over the window and the tv off i even put my phone on vibrate just to sleep. sucks but it takes time (like weeks) to get out of this. the headaches came and went but its not as bad as b4|`|rC6gL7KOaa	I dealt with headaches up until 6 weeks. All I could do was take a nap, that's really the only time I felt relief. Tylenol doesn't work. Just make sure you stay hydrated (dehydration can cause headaches). Fortunately mine stopped last week. Now I'm at week 8 and I haven't had a headache since.  It may only be a temporary thing, just hang in there.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	My doctor told me that it may be from caffeine withdraw and to drink a little bit of caffeine. Just not a lot. And that may help. They also say to drink TONS of water. That may be what's causing it. |`|U0iqktu8aa	Try taking a bath and having a coke I know we are not supposed to drink caffeine but it really helps with a headache).  |`|A8wk9rK9aa	if they are that bad, talk to your doctor, espeically if you don't normally get them.  <br>  <br>  Tylenol does nothing for me at all.  you could try some caffeine, as that will help to open the blood vessels.  it's ok to have some caffeine when pregnant just not a lot.  if you want to kno how much, as your doctor.  i drank tea a lot, and would prek it with one reg bag and 2 decaf, so i had some caffeine and not much<br>  <br>  Try a nice warm bath or shower,  let the warm water run down your face, your neck and where the is the most tension.  taht will also help to open up your blood vessels.  <br>  <br>  i have migraines and at times took two or three showers a day, just to try and make it through my preganncy due to my migraines.  if the headaches fontinue, defintely talk to your doctor.  there are some meds that are allowed in preganancy and they can tell you if any of them will work for you|`|AVlTYPHCaa	Well, first thing – you need to make sure that this headache definitely related to your pregnancy. So, talk to your doctor and see what she/he will tell you. Caffeine is definitely not an option for you now (and most of strong headache medicines contain caffeine). <br>  The only thing you can do now is try to relax. You can also take Valerian Root. It is a natural supplement, basically a muscle relaxant. It will help you.   <br>  <br>  
6jXgOuUPaa	you sure can get pregnant before you start your period. theres really no set date as to how many weeks you can get pregnant before you start ovulating because you can get pregnant while on your period as well. the thing with this is the sperm travels and goes in the egg when so ever it pleases. you cant stop it its human nature. alot of the time with ectopic pregnancies the women gets pregnant either while on her menstrual cylce. or when its over because the egg can be fertilized in your ovaries, and is to big to make it down the f. tubes. alot of times the egg gets fertilized inside of the ovaries and does not go through the tube and is stuck inside of the ovaries. and if not treated in time it will rupture and cause serious damage, and servere internal bleeding leading to death. so if you feel pains in the begining of your pregnancy and at the very first sign of pregnancy you should see a doctor. especially if you were taking the pill.<br>  you can get pregnant while your taking birth control pills. and just because your taking them does not mean you should have unprotected sex. your doctor shouldve told you that. but it happens more so then people think. honestly alot of my friends were on the pill and they still got pregnant. one of them with triplets. and also some family. doesnt mater if you miss a day or not. so if you miss a day dont blame it on that its just nature taking its course. even though your taking the pills it doesnt eliminate the fact that you'll get pregnant. neither will it terminate a pregnancy. <br>  <br>  hope this answered it in full. :)|`|T5JYcQ3laa	Did you just start it this month? Most doctors say you should wait a month after starting oral BC to have unprotected sex... it takes a little bit for it to take effect. <br>  <br>  And yes, you can. If you miss a pill, take it as soon as you remember (if you've forgotten 2 pills or less). If you've forgotten one or two pills, take them right away. If more than that, just take one, and continue taking them one a day, as normal.<br>  <br>  If you're worried about unprotected sex and forgetting to take your pill, use condoms. Better safe than sorry!|`|SndrZbn8aa	I was under the impression that you have to take the pills for a full cycle, one month, before they become effective. That might just be for the type of pill I was on... not sure. Missing pills is going to make taking them ineffective. Try taking them at the same time every day so it becomes more of routine. If you still can't remember to take them maybe you should look into other birth control options. It might do good to contact your doctor to discuss this question with them and the proper ways in which to take this pill you are on.|`|HzV1LeIvaa	It's wonderful you have chosen an act of contraception!<br>  many teens aren't wary of the matter and leave it all up to condoms or 'withdrawal'.<br>  <br>  remember you have to take those pills everyday at the same time!<br>  so be careful you don't miss any.<br>  <br>  as to your question, you are 90% more likely to get pregnant a week before your period, as you are ovulating by this stage.<br>  <br>  keep up the good work!|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Read the instructions on your pills. I very much doubt if you are protected yet regardless of whether you remember to take the pills.<br>  <br>  And yes, you can get pregnant just before your period. If there was a guaranteed safe time of the month, don't you think it would be advertised?|`|COecrPrMaa	Actually, you ovulate before your period.  The time between ovulation and your period is called the Luteal phase, and is almost always the same length in days each month.  (Check out <a href="http://www.fertilityfriend.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.fertilityfriend.com</a> for some great info)<br>  <br>  Two days before your period isn't going to harm anything, however, you should know that birth control pills are not 100% effect so of course you can become pregnant... whether you miss a day or two or not.<br>  <br>  I would personally suggest doubling up with a condom as well.  Condoms are not 100% either but its better than only one method, and also, condoms help prevent the spread of some STDs.  Doubling up isn't a bad idea at all.

My daughter is 18m now and we are ttc again. It was great when she was learning to finger feed herself and now she is learning to spoon feed herself its awesome too. She wont sit in one place very long, but I strap her in give her food and she gets on with it. Its also a godsend when I have to do something. I put her in, put a drink and some fruit on it and she is happy|`|mygpnrK1aa	I love the bath seat by Dream Baby. When my daughter outgrew her infant tub, I would have to set towels under her in the bath to keep her from sliding all over the place. This bath seat suctions to the bottom of the tub. The front folds down to allow getting her in and out easier. And my hands are free to wash and play with her!
3eaca7edc988f18315cdeb4947052c4baa	Hi Michaela,<br>  <br>  While the withdrawal method is not 100% effective, such numbers are based on an entire population. We know for a fact that a number of of Women have become pregnant despite such action. A realistic assessment as to why you've not become pregnant would simply be by "chance". There may be other reasons in terms of biology and health, but that's impossible for us to infer; I'm not your physician. <br>  <br>  While the majority of women who utilize the method are grateful for not having become pregnant or contracted a disease (in other scenarios), it's strangely opposite in your situation. The obvious solution to producing the outcome you desire, is to discontinue what you're doing and not utilize the withdrawal method. My guess is, if your husband is not interested in penetrational ejaculation; he's not interested in being a father at the moment. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps. :-)<br>  <br>  Best wishes to you and yours!|`|4AO2myzKaa	You should sit down with your hub and decide if you want to start trying for sure.  If you decide yes, then make sure he doesn't withdraw.  If you are doing things "normally" there is only a 20% chance each month that you will get pregnant, and though the method isn't 100% I'm sure it lowers the 20% to 5% or so....meaning at that rate it could take years.  Bottom line is you need to decide what you want and change it up if you are ready for baby.|`|bIvsLrCUaa	Why don't you just let him *** inside of you? I mean you are married. Me and my boyfriend got pregnant because he really wanted to inside of me, so i let him. Then, i took the shower head and sprayed myself out. Didn't work. Lol.<br>  <br>  20 Weeks Pregnant With A Beautiful Baby Girl :)|`|X9Dpyrg9aa	Is he actually withdrawing every time? If so, I think it's a little bit more effective than the statistics say. The first 2 times I got pregnant we were using this method. It was also the only 2 times that he didn't pull out. So, the whole time we used this method and actually did it we didn't get pregnant either. Men are men and they want to please you just as much as they want to be pleased. It's easy, when you know he is about to c*m act like you are about to also. Beg him not to pull out. It will work at least once. That may be all you need. I wasn't trying to get pregnant and that is all it took for me, twice.<br>  You could also just talk to him about wanting to get pregnant. He doesn't seem too opposed to the idea so that might work too. Good Luck. |`|kcGFK36Waa	Hubby and I used the pull out method for like 2 years and nothing. The first 3 times (within a period of a week and 1/2) that we didn't use protection I got pregnant. So it doesn't mean that you can't have kids it just means your being more cautious and that's why you haven't gotten pregnant. |`|Yn6pM2Xyaa	you need to talk to your husband about the fact that you are ready to try now in the sense of not withdrawing anymore and then just sorta seeing what happens.. then if he agrees its really up to you if you just let it happen whenever or become obsessed with timing and supplements and peeing on sticks like the rest of us!!  lol  talk to him!|`|PFO1jxZGaa	We used withdrawal for two years without getting pregnant, one night he decides to, well not to withdraw before and boom I was pregnant|`|YVWlAvqEaa	Then you need to stop using the withdrawal method and let him finish inside of you. Just because the withdrawal method isn't 100% effective, doesn't mean that it's definitely going to end up with someone becoming pregnant. You can have sex normally, without withdrawal, and not necessarily be trying, you just wouldn't be preventing.|`|gfohoYOyaa	Its a possibility that you can get pregnant, but obviously the odds are not as good as if he intentionally fertilizes your egg.  I did the pull out method for 5 months after I went off the pill with the idea that if it happens, it happens...and nothing happened.  Sure enough, the first time I went for it (knowing that I was ovulating and could get pregnant) I was pregnant!  If you want it - just go for it!  |`|qqiVKUBpaa	Quit pulling out. There are only a few days a month that you can get pregnant and so even going without birth control doesn't guarantee that you'll get preg immediately. It took my sister in law a year and she was 24. It took me and my husband about 3 months. Just quit trying to prevent it in any way and see what happens.|`|xtVelindaa	i guess hes just pulling out in time. bc isnt either 100% and neither are condoms and lots of people dont get pregnant. if you want to get pregnant then tell your husband, maybe you just arent having sex during your fertile time. id talk about it with him. good luck! ?<br>  ? Elizabeth Lynn|`|HXfHkoSHaa	Sounds like you just need to commit to trying.  Even tough pulling out isn't completely effective, it does work a lot.  Stop doing that and really try.  Being a mom is wonderful.|`|fPX1lD8uaa	Talk to your husband about wanting a baby and tell him to stop pulling out. (If he doesn't care either way if you get pregnant or not, then there shouldn't be a problem)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|kXcjuEqGaa	if you want to get pregnant then don't use the withdrawal method.  maybe your husband doesn't want to have a baby yet|`|HntAuUW3aa	talk to your husband about it |`|T9SgqPyhaa	You just gotta talk to hubby about wanting a baby.  You haven't gotten pregnant because the chances of getting pregnant each month are only about 20% anyway.  Just because it's not an effective form of birth control doesn't mean that is doesn't work most of the time.  If you want to get pregnant, you stand a better chance if he ejaculates in you.  And if you want to get pregnant without trying, try telling hubby this... if you believe that what happens happens and what doesn't doesn't, why don't you just finish in me instead of pulling out.  That way you're NOT ACTUALLY TRYING, you're just upping your chances and still letting nature take its course.  You should probably only do this though if you're both in agreement that you would be happy about a baby and can handle the emotional and financial burdens that come with it.|`|GuFaWNqIaa	By chance you have not gotten pregnant. There are certain times of the month, during your cycle, that you are most likely to get pregnant. You must be missing those days. I wouldn't fear that you have a problem with conceiving until you are really trying. You should talk with him and really try. If your still having trouble I beleive there are over the counter supplements that you could try, like Vitex (chasteberry) which are supposed to help women conceive. <br>  Or you can track your ovulation with one of those kits you buy at a drugstore. <br>  Good luck! |`|fx5uBEy1aa	I have heard that you can get pregnant by using the withdrawal method but if you DO want to get pregnant then you should talk to each other and tell your hubby how you really feel. A baby is a big responsibility it requires both of you to be co-operating honey. I apologise if ive offended you in any way. I mean i dont really know your situation but Im sure if you did fall pregnant he would be over the moon!!! Good luck!! |`|Z4t2GbSzaa	I would definitely advise you to talk to your husband. If you want to get pregnant then he defiantly needs to know. Just because the withdrawal method isn't 100% effective, its still effective ! In order to have conception you need some swimmers ;) !!! Stop withdrawal and your chances of becoming pregnant go up !! |`|TnCcOaFQaa	First, talk to your hubby and let him know how you're feeling.  You should both be on the same page before conceiving.  Second, the withdrawal method isn't 100% safe, but it's also not a great way to get pregnant.  Chances are, you're just not having sex at the right time.  Talk to your hubby, if it's a go, then follow your cycle and try to have sex when you think you're ovulating!  Good luck!|`|L7S24gkEaa	When we decided to "try" all we did was stop using contraception, it happened really fast. If you want to get pregnant it is possible this way, but "trying" dosnt have to mean ovulation sticks and punctual sex. It sounds like u want to get pregnant and yor husband wants to too. why not just stop withdrawing and see how u go<br>  Talk to your husband and see how he feels about it theres no shame in a husand and wife trying for a baby :)|`|xIfrreDfaa	If you wanna get pregant- talk it over again w/ him! children are blessings. I used the same method for two years w/ my ex and there was only one scare and no pregnacies... it is alot better then they teach in school- If your trying to get pregnant-  try..|`|BQsT9ICxaa	If you are trying, then stop with the withdrawl technique.  Me and my husband took 6 months of trying and we were actually counting days and checking for ovulation and it still took that long.  Talk to your husband about actually trying.  |`|c0tmmjRZaa	How about grabbing him around the hips and holding him inside of you without letting him withdrawl. Or be on top and don't get off when he is ready to come out...<br>  <br>  <br>  Or tell him the truth and tell him that you want to try for a baby. <br>  <br>  S|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Why don't you tell your husband that you would like to officially start trying for a baby. If he ejaculates in you it will up your chances of getting pregnant. You never know your husband may want to start trying to. Just speak to him. |`|Wkf0YTKtaa	Sounds like he doesnt really want a baby if he pulls out.  If you both want one, it will happen.|`|vz1gmSM7aa	That's what method we use.  It's always worked for us about not getting pregnant.  I myself am wishing I accidentally will get pregnant but no luck so far.|`|mPyN2XX3aa	14 days before your period is due is when you ovulate.  That's your best chance...Does your husband know how bad you have baby fever?  |`|EkOwtna8aa	switch positions...be the boss. jeez.....<br>  <br>  would be alot harder for him to pull out if you're on top....<br>  <br>  then go stand on your head...|`|9z6MYV26aa	talk to your husband|`|4qTOzcoXaa	Maybe it's just luck, up to this point... but the withdrawal method certainly isn't the most effective birth control.<br>  If you really do want to have a baby, I think you should be up-front with your husband and discuss this, so you're both on the same page! It will still be exciting and a surprise when it happens!|`|RNTeNZlXaa	I am going through the same thing.<br>  <br>  My GYN said to try this for three months:<br>  <br>  he said right after my menstrual cycle ends count ten days. On the 10th day start using an Ovulation Test kit (you can buy it at any store for about $20). If you get a positive result then have intercourse that night (or your preference)...You continue to do this until your next menstrual cycle. It everything okay with you and your partner, then you should get pregnant. If not you need to be examine. It everything turns out to be fine with you, then this could mean there might be something wrong with your spouse.<br>  |`|ZRNlwu5laa	I think you need to talk to your husband. You both need to decide if you are ready to have another child or not. If you are wanting one then I would tell him that and then actually try. My husband and I did the pull out method for 4 years and I never got pregnant until we actually tried. It is hard enough to get pregnant with actually trying. |`|FCyLTG63aa	thats how i got pregnant. the withdrawal method. <br>  the way i got pregnant was me and my partner did it alot everyday. i got pregg 14 days after my period. so do the ovulation math and for those couple of days, you could do it alot and i bet your husband wouldnt mind doing it..|`|qa8lvht0aa	Don't use it one of the times you guys do it.<br>  And if he gets mad... you can say: Your the one who got me pregnant! |`|cvkKtet0aa	maybe you should let your husband know that you really want a baby and if he keeps pulling out, you will never get pregnant. and did it ever occur to you that your husband doesnt want a baby right now thats why he keeps pulling out?|`|SkxbJS58aa	Adopt, there are so many babies out there than need loving parents. The who knows... down the road you might get pregnant.|`|RyVfai2Xaa	right when hes about to come put ur legs around his body|`|KXFzjHVsaa	if ur taking sperm from a bank <br>  thats a lil wrong if ur man can't get it rite fcuk him get a new man that can.<br>  <br>  ahhh....yeeeeaaaahhhh -_-"
lOJ4VIPfaa	Sounds like you could be they only way to know for sure it to measure your self every week or two weeks.|`|ameJkDgpaa	yup your going though a growth spurt|`|1F0nKNpIaa	Yea I think so|`|rOfFOcwpaa	Yes|`|0H3WdA4Naa	Could be or you get the munchies walking around a lot. But like everybody has said, it's a growth spurt.<br>  <br>  If you find yourself vomiting every morning, then it may not be!!!|`|AA11689956	A growth spurt is when in a very short period of time you grow a few inches<br>  <br>  for example when i was around 12-13 i went from  4'11 to 5'4 and my shoe size went from 6 to 9 :(<br>  <br>  one weekend id buy a pair of shoes the following weekend i went to put them on and they hurt
AA12010051	my doctor gave me my due date from my sonogram so they will be able to give you a due date even if you didn't keep track of your cycles.|`|Zy07f0Zwaa	Your doctor will use your HCG levels to determine a very rough timeline and then follow that up with an ultrasound. The ultrasound may not occur until at least 12 weeks but usually there is a dating scan in the first 12 weeks to confirm how far along you are especially if you are unsure. <br>  <br>  Good luck xx|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	If you don't know when your last period was then they'll do an ultrasound to determine how far along you are. They can tell by measuring the baby from top to bottom. That's how they were able to determine it with mine. Good luck and congrats|`|X76BnjUlaa	  Yes the dr will be able to tell you how far along you are by you telling him when your last period was. You are going to have to mark your periods on your calender after you have this baby, but he should also be able to tell more accurately by doing an internal examination.congratulations. |`|AA10664307	Doctors have this down to a science for the most part. But it's not unusual for the baby to arrive whenever he or she chooses. My suggestion is not to worry about the date. Just stay healthy and happy. God will take care of the rest. God bless.|`|4CyhY6Q1aa	Date of your last period: 13/06/2008<br>  Your due date: 20/03/2009<br>  <br>  You are 15 weeks and 0 days pregnant<br>  <br>  www.babyworld.co.uk|`|J5KeAqQ3aa	The doctor will typically go by your very last period.  Once you get to your very first visit...your doctor will do an ultrasound to find out exactly how far along you are.  This will give them exact dates.  Pretty much it will stay the same throughout the pregnancy unless the baby is measuring bigger than expected.|`|x8Z9dEokaa	they have a dating ultra sound they can do to see how far along u are.<br>  they did one with me and found out i was further along then we all thought they went by y last period but it didn't help i was preg when had my last period  i was a week further then we thought now i am 35 weeks and 5 days<br>  good luck with it all|`|SQw16c5Daa	Ultrasound.

1baaf1590b68ac256de6d448c39d1c92aa	i just had to tough it out.  I know it's rough but it will soon pass|`|AA11756768	If you don't want to take the tylenol with codeine you might want to go buy some regular strength tylenol, if you have a fever you might be better off taking it to reduce the fever than not taking anything. Sudafed is considered ok, but I also read that taking it too long can reduce blood flow to your uterus so you shouldn't really take it for more than a day or two. The saline nasal spray will come in a bottle with the end meant to stick up your nose, you can use it upright or laying down. I'd suggest getting the cheapest you can find since it's probably a good idea to throw it out once your over your cold. Non medicated breathe right strips might also help you to sleep. I hope you feel better soon, I had a cold a few weeks ago, I'm also pregnant, and it was horrible so I know how your feeling right now. <br>  <br>  If you need a list of medications that are considered safe during pregnancy webmd.com has one, I'd trust theirs more than alot of other stuff online. |`|Tm1Rpfq4aa	I don't know why on earth they would perscribe tylenol w/ codeine for a pregnant woman!  Don't take it, it will not do anyhting for a cold/flu anyway.  i had a cyst on my labia cut and mashed on without pain meds while preggo'd because they couldn't give me anything other than tylenol (normal tylenol).<br>  Benadryl is safe, it will help you sleep and wil help dry up any crud you got right now.<br>  Saline, squirt it up your nose and wait about 30 sec. and blow.|`|AA10093462	Saline drip is excellent.  My daughter is pregnant too and the doctor told her to use it too.   Just blow your nose first.  Then hold one nostril closed, then spray 2 puffs into the other nostril while inhaling.  Then do the same on the opposite side.   The doctor told her too to spray enough that a little drips down your throat too.   The doctor also told her it was OK to use Tylenol Cold and Flu.|`|4HhzKHl0aa	Vaporizors with Vicks and a warm bath do wonders. <br>  <br>  There's also a nasal spray by Vicks that is amazing!<br>  <br>  )Ou stick the spray in one nostril and as you spray you breathe in deep through your nose. Then repeat in your other nostril. |`|KYw1TjT4aa	Look inside you and be strong.|`|5AokHZo6aa	well since your pregnant you should check with your doctor to make what you are taking wont affect the baby. as far as saline nasal drip you use it like nasal spray. put your head back, hold one nostril and spray then do the same for the other nostril. when you take the saline drip you would feel the drip in the back of your throat that is fine.and for the cold i would take tylenol cold liquid, and it would start to clear up. liquid is better than pills. |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I would try Sudafed. I know that you can take that while being pregnant. With the saline nasal spray I would lay flat on my back and sniffle in and squeeze the bottle at the same time. Do it twice in each nostril. Good luck. |`|RqZOTRuraa	I know exactly how you're feeling and it sucks! I was like this about two weeks ago and I didn't really take anything. I went to the doctor and he got me some type of medicine, but that was after it all basically cleared up! |`|vEOYvRgBaa	Try regular extra strength tylenol and a netty bottle for congestion.  Also, steam showers, rest and plenty of fluids.|`|lYaPh2XBaa	Im going threw the same sickness right now! If I was you I would use a humidifer. My OB also recommended taking Sudafed & Robitussion.
3q2okYyQaa	Sorry honey, but "pulling out" is not a method. I wouldn't doubt that you are, because your timing seems right. I would just wait it out and take a test after you miss your period. But if you're impatient like me, go get a test! Congrats.|`|jQDeTTVhaa	take a test|`|XkE7CcjVaa	Just because you have cramps doesnt mean your pregnant. Did you know that a guy still c*ms before he actually "c*ums" and you can still get pregnant even if you pull out.|`|apXxSZvhaa	you may be having period pain.. its also possible that you are pregnant.  if you dont get your period within a week from the day your due, get tested right away.<br>  the pull out method does not work, you may as well be not using the pull out method-  thats how ineffective it is.<br>  sometimes your likely to have bad abdominal pain for up to a week before you actually get your period, so i wouldnt be overly concerned yet.  give it another few days to a week then if still nothing like i said, get tested.<br>  good luck|`|VC0hx8xvaa	I'm proof that the "pull out method" is not an effective form of birth control! It sounds like you could be 50/50... could be period cramps, could be pregnancy. Take a home pregnancy test, or if that's not affordable there's the local pregnancy resource clinic (google for your location), they almost always provide testing for FREE! But to answer your question... you could definitely be pregnant! Good luck!|`|8w0786yeaa	Yes, it has, just about anyone who thinks that the pull-out method is a reliable form of birth control, which it's not in the slightest.<br>  <br>  If you miss your period, take a pregnancy test.  I don't know why people think they can't get pregnant that way.|`|kAdgwDFqaa	If you don't want to get pregnant you should use protection.  Then you wouldn't have to be worried so much.|`|Oc8e7wAXaa	Take a pregnancy test, it doesn't matter where it's from, it does matter how much it cost, it can cost $1 for all I'm concerned, They work trust me, I know, I took like 15 of them $1 ones..... If it comes out to be POSITIVE, then you are.... If it is NEGATIVE, that could mean 1 of 3 different things, 1) it could mean your not pregnant, obviously<br>  2) It could mean you took it too early<br>  Or<br>  3) It could be a FALSE NEGATIVE, They do happen...<br>  <br>  But if you really want to make sure, wait and see if you miss your period... but keep in mind that a small number of "pregnant" women can have up to 3 periods and still be pregnant, it is possible...|`|c61522d7badca9ccd7affe996b918266aa	I'd say wait and see for a few more days. These cramps could be pre-period cramps, so don't get too freaked out yet. <br>  <br>  Note on precome: Unless the guy has jacked off recently, (or came some other way) all that is in precome is the various things that are in ejaculate OTHER than sperm. Biologically, this happens to clear urine out of the uretha so the urine's unbalanced PH wouldn't kill the sperm. So, theoretically, if he just came then had his precome come out again, then there's a slight chance, but really, the precome isn't that high of a risk.<br>  <br>  BUT, and I can't stress this enough, USE CONDOMS. IF HE WON'T BUY THEM THEN YOU BUY SOME AND MAKE HIM USE THEM. IF HE SAYS HE DOESN'T LIKE HOW THEY MAKE IT FEEL then DON'T HAVE SEX WITH HIM! |`|0ycQaT1Iaa	I guess it's a bit late for a bird and bees chat BUT the "pull out method" really isn't a safe if your not trying to get preg. Have you done a preg test.It is possible you are imagining that you have the signs. Do you have any other signs?<br>  <br>  I hope the result is the one you are looking for :-)|`|WAls73rvaa	1.) yes its happened to lots of people<br>  2.) pull out method isnt a "method" it doesnt work... something called precum kinda defeats the purpose<br>  3.) just go get a test... no one on here is going to be able to tell you for sure if you are or arnt pregnant<br>  <br>  <br>  |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Well first of all the pull out method doesn't work.

31addee65693225c68c169daf536009aaa	OK - read this:<br>  <br>  Scenario 1: <br>  A 30 year old person who has been bound and gagged is shot in the head. At the hospital, their heartbeat stops and they are pronounced dead.<br>  <br>  Scenario 2: <br>  A girl discovers she is 2 months pregnant and does not want the baby. She goes in for an abortion. The doctor aborts the baby by ripping it apart with suction or stabbing it in the back of the head and the deed is done. No more baby.<br>  <br>  In the first scenario, the doctor used the absence of the heartbeat to determine death, indicating that while the heart was beating the victim was still alive. <br>  <br>  A baby's heartbeat can be detected 21 day after conception. Before that, it was rapidly developing along with the brain, spinal cord and nervous system. What is the force behind this development? Answer: Life itself. <br>  <br>  So, if the baby's heart is beating and the doctor stops the heartbeat isn't that the same thing as the murderer who pulled the trigger and killed the bound and gagged person? Both were innocent, defenseless people, one was 30 years old, the other was 60 day into development. Both hearts are beating. How do you justify abortion?<br>  <br>  Why would you feel it is your right to kill the unborn baby but it is wrong to kill an out-of-the-womb human?<br>  <br>  Think twice - a life is in your hands!<br>  |`|GxV4jGKMaa	Of course you're not ready.  But you have a choice here.  You can get yourself ready, by preparing yourself to care for and support a child, or you can give the child up for adoption or you can have an abortion.  That's what choice is.  He is being honest with you. He's not ready.  Now you have to be honest with yourself.  But I don't understand why you don't think you'll be able to have kids later.  If you can have them now, you can have them later.  Abortion is actually less traumatic to the body than childbirth.  |`|d092475deaa61dba856bb6c8d78f69d3aa	Only you can decide what is right for you and your body. If you want to keep it but abort, it will cause a major strain in your relationship. If you do keep it and he ends up being resentful, that will also cause a strain or possibly even a break up between the two of you. <br>  <br>  Having an abortion doesn't mean you can't ever have kids in the future. Having one abortion performed by a doctor with no complications leaves almost no risks for future pregnancies. <br>  <br>  I had my son when I was 15 years old and at that time I never even thought of getting an abortion. Since having him I have gone through terminating a pregnancy and I know it was the right decision for me at that time. Having been on both ends of the spectrum, I can only imagine how torn you feel. This is something you need to sit down and talk about and see how he feels on both...keeping and aborting. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|jDzYLELfaa	Okay, well from one side, he really can't tell you what to do, and he should be saying that he's there for you no matter what decision you make. After all, he's not the one with a ******* baby inside of him, so it's YOUR choice and HE should have your back no matter what that choice is.<br>  <br>  On a second thought, if he thinks you two aren't ready, what he may MEAN to say is that HE'S not ready, and since he's overwhelmed with the idea of being a dad, there is a chance that he might leave you to raise the child alone (don'tbe caught in denial with this one, even the most loving men do such things, ever heard of the fight or flight instict?) <br>  <br>  If I were you, I'd just get the abortion. 19 is very young and you still have a life ahead of you. You were a child couple of years ago, there is no way you can raise a child yourself. It might change your life, not so much for the best. I mean yeah, you'll have a child and whatnot but think of the financial situation you'll be in! And in the economy we have today? THere's no more shopping for clothes, you'll be spending money on dipers and baby food. Just something to keep in mind, you know.  A baby isn't a pet, you can't just feed it and take it out to poop. This is a human being that needs to be raised the right way and is very time consuming, obvioisly something that you'll need help with from the dad and since you two aren't marries, he's not ENTITLED to live with you and the baby, he can always run. Sure, he'll get tracked down and asked for money, but that'll be a minimal amount AND the child will be fatherless. <br>  <br>  I'm a fatherless child and let me tell you, you don't want to risk putting your child through that.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|Yn6pM2Xyaa	do what you want to do and can live with but know that it might mean him walking away from you and that you can't make him stay and want something that he doesn't want.  best of luck, you'll survive no matter which path you choose.|`|3qI1oyFaaa	Your body, your choice. <br>  If you want to keep your baby you should. Abortions can do horrible things to you emotionally, especially if you never even wanted to do it. <br>  <br>  CONGRATS to you and good luck :)<br>  |`|yPNvecc7aa	It's your decision. Do what feels right to YOU.<br>  Because regardless, it sounds like you're gonna be on your own on this one.|`|I7myOp8Qaa	This one is a tough situation. Is there anyone else besides your boyfriend who is mature and responsible that you can talk to?<br>  <br>  I do know one thing though- it helps if you both parents want the child. Your boyfriend is making it very clear that he does not want this baby. If you are prepared to go ahead and have the baby regardless only to have him walk out then go ahead. <br>  <br>  On the other hand, your boyfriend is also right- 19 is young to be having a baby. You have your life ahead of you. This does not mean that you need to abort but you might seriously consider options such as giving the baby up for adoption etc.<br>  <br>  Either way, abortions performed by authorized medical centers are often safe and the sooner you get them done (if you decide to have one) the better. Talk to your doctor and they should be able to give you good advice on where to go. Planned Parenthood can also help you out here in terms of guidance and counselling as well as abortion if you should decide to get one. Good luck.<br>  <br>  In the end, please keep in mind that should you choose to have this baby you are also going to be influencing its life. Do you have a way to support yourself financially or will you need to go on welfare? Do you have your own place or do you have a way of leaving the baby with someone while you go to school or go to work? Consider all of this before making your final decision.|`|yOy5OpqFaa	It is your body and your decision. I have had friends who have had abortions and they told me they regret it soo much and they got depressed after doing it. Oh if you wanna talk you can email me. I am 19 too I will be 20 in December and I am pregnant with my third child I will probably get thumbs down for that lol but I am married and I have been for almost three years and yes my kids all have the same father.|`|EYSl68csaa	If you do not want to do it do not do it, it is your body and no longer his choice if he didn't wanna get you pregnant he should have used conception.<br>  <br>  Trust YOUR instincts and YOUR heart and do whats right by you.  <br>  It's Truly sounds like if you do it then you will regret it and you will live with that the rest of your life.<br>  <br>  I am personally against abortion for b/c reasons but I am not gonna be like some of these other people and be rude about it.<br>  <br>  |`|oMNXWMs9aa	People my say different but I think that an abortion is wrong! Right know he might think that you all cant do this but a child is a wonderful thing. Now both of y'all knew the chance of you getting pregnant if you were not protection. Are there any other reasons why he might not want this child? It you choice but that is a life inside of you and to kill it cause someone is not ready si just wrong. Give the child up for adoption if it comes down to it but don't take its life. God Bless|`|7VHwQjMVaa	I cant believe you would even ask. If yall weren't ready than yall shouldnt have been having sex. Or could have at least used protection. What gives you the right to kill? If you don't want the baby then give it up for adoption. People like you make me sick. Thinking about murder simply because your boyfriend doesnt agree. I hope you do whats right. |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Don't get an abortion. PLEASE.... Think of your child. Also, think about how you are going to feel years from now when you think back about how you would have a child but you decided to kill it. If you both think you aren't ready then please give it up for adoption because there are so many happy couples out there that want a family more than anything and can't have one. Please think about. |`|sXCSVFBaaa	It's your decision whether you want one or not. He can't force you. If you don't feel right about getting an abortion, don't get one! He can deal.|`|bFDeOXvYaa	If you aren't ready to have a child, there is the option of giving it up for adoption. By doing that you will get to pass on your genes, but without having to raise the child.<br>  <br>  Before you choose adoption over abortion, consider the chances your child would have of being adopted. Are you (and he) healthy and drug free? Will the baby be healthy? Will it be white? I know the last part is racist, but healthy white infants are in demand. Non-white infants are more likely to be adopted from overseas.<br>  <br>  I am not pregnant, and have never had kids, but I read that fertility declines with age. Should I go and get pregnant, because what if I am able to get pregnant now, but then something happens and I can't have kids? No. If I wanted kids I should wait until I ready. I have a biological clock, but if I wait too long to have kids, then I was probably never going to be ready to have kids in the first place.<br>  <br>  Take some time to consider your options. Don't leave it too late though, the longer you wait to abort, the harder it will be.|`|lGKz4Yofaa	Do what your heart feels not what a GUY tells you to do, A lot of times guys are just scared or don't want that type of responsibility so they will tell you that. I say keep the baby or if you two aren't ready then give the baby a chance and find a great family for him or her to be adopted by! My husband and I were 19 when we had our first child and we did just fine :)<br>  You have to do with what your heart feels, Baby's are precious little gifts! Tell him you want to keep the baby and from there see what he says my friends boyfriend wanted her to have an abortion because he just did not want responsibility not all young guys but a lot of them are that way and its a selfish way for them to think.<br>  |`|n2PKmyibaa	Never let anyone tell you what to do with your body! Having said that, Talk with him and find out WHY he doesn't think you guys are ready. Let him be a part of the discussion, but in the end, it is your choice. One thing to keep in mind, though, is that there are wonderful, loving couples out there who can't have kids and have been on adoption waiting lists for years sometimes. If you agree that you're not ready to raise a baby, consider letting one of those couples have the chance with your baby.|`|cILr5o4Iaa	You definitely need to do what feels right for YOU. If you want to keep the baby, keep the baby. Just know that you might be facing being a single mom. Lots of women do it and their babies turn out just fine. I would consider adoption if you don't think raising a child by yourself is an option - there are way too many couples out there that can't have a baby of their own that would love yours as if it were their own. Please, just think about your decision, what's best for you and for the baby. Good luck.|`|dAV2CnNmaa	As much as your partner is welcome to his opinion it is your body. Unfortunately this is a hard decision to make but if you feel you are ready and want this child I don't think you'd ever get over an abortion. I'm 18 in 2months and I am 34weeks tomorrow. I did consider an abortion but knew I would never get over having one. <br>  I really do wish you the best <br>  Good luck|`|Qe4ecBi5aa	I would look into some other options first. Remember that if you don't want to keep it, there are so many people who can't have children. I'm pro-life and wouldn't look down on someone who had an abortion, but think of other people who would kill for their own child but are unable to conceive. You could turn someone's life around. |`|pAKIrJ0baa	You should talk to your boyfriend about how you feel. <br>  Don't let others choose for you.<br>  If you have an abortion, in which you dont want, you seriously will regret it. <br>  If your boyfriend still doesn't want you to have the baby, but you do, then do it. <br>  |`|WH0a9vSYaa	One abortion will not effect your fertility.<br>  <br>  You are both very young and will be missing out on a lot of life if you continue with this pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Don't be forced into anything, do what you think is right but in saying that I agree with your bf.|`|fArN0QEMaa	tell him to f*ck off!! & be prepared to own up to his mistake!<br>  Dont kill ur baby ur boyfriends not worth it and will probally leave ur azz after u have the abortion. That baby will always love u and u will always have he/she in ur life! U cant say the same about ur boyfreind though|`|q4svLNr9aa	hun u would never ever be Ready for a baby so if u want it then its ur Body and if he doesn't like it then he has to just deal with it besides who ever doesn't love a child no matter what position there in  doesn't love anyone ..|`|TPJbEhNBaa	Do what you feel is right.  Don't let him talk you into something you don't want to do.  <br>  <br>  Next time, be more careful.
dJnRFpWWaa	I don't believe that it would be lawful for the prospective employer to ask you directly or indirectly about whether you are pregnant or not. However if it's clear that you are pregnant, then you might be better off taking the bull by the horns and discussing your intentions should you be hired.<br>  <br>  In other words, you may want to level with them about whether this is a four month job hire and that they will have to fill the position again because you don't plan on returning to work after you give birth. Or, if that isn't the case, that you intend to work from home after your child's birth for 3 months or so, and then return to the company's normal business routine.<br>  <br>  Your prospective employer can't read your mind about such things. So if you look pregnant to all the world but don't broach the subject during your interview and your future plans, then you may be hurting your chances for this job. <br>  <br>  You might want to contact an employment law practitioner and ask him or her for legal/practical advice before your interview because if you are the best person for the job you should be hired regardless of such things as a pregnancy. You might also check the website for the federal agency, maybe the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, for general legal advice.<br>  <br>  Good luck with the interview. I hope you get the job.|`|f46ac79782011df203ccb9768414aec1aa	TBH if you tell them they may not take you on if your only going to be working for a few months,then time off for maternity leave<br>  <br>  Then if you lie and your going to be off anyway, so your in a no win situation really<br>  <br>  hope it works out for you whatever you decide<br>  <br>  <br>  ETA...if you tell them about the insurance etc, this may make a difference,and as your being honest they may want to keep you on after youve had the baby.best wishes|`|yPNvecc7aa	I think you should be honest from the get-go, especially since you say it's kinda hard to hide it at this point.<br>  <br>  If you don't say anything, as soon as you walk out the door they might turn and say to eachother "What does she think we didn't notice??". They may have hired you anyway, but because you chose to omit a pretty important detail about yourself they might decide not to hire you based on your dishonesty.|`|3EhoJ42zaa	It's not deceitful if they do not ask.  During an interview, they cannot ask you if you are pregnant, have kids, plan on having kids etc...  So if they do not ask, do not tell.  I would wait until you get hired to tell them.|`|rC6gL7KOaa	If they don't ask, don't tell. Like you said, lot's of companies discriminate against pregnant women. They see pregnant ladies as a liability because they figure you're going to move slower, have to leave for doctor's appointments, and stay out sick. Plus, in a few months, you'll be on maternity leave. That's all the more reason they will have not to hire you. So that's all the more reason you should have not to tell them. If you're showing, it's not like you're trying to hide the pregnancy.|`|z77TERJGaa	If they bring it up in the interview, then yes I'd tell them.  But if they don't then don't tell them, you getting a job should not be based on the fact that you're pregnant, but on your ability to do the job and do it well.  If your pregnancy is going well and there's no reason you couldn't perform the job then they have no reason not to hire you.  It's just my opinion that it's none of their business unless they ask.|`|cFqEp5x8aa	I agree with the folks on here saying that it will be more difficult to get the job if you tell them you are pregnant; however, if you lie about it your boss will obviously find out and will probably be extremely dissatisfied.  No your employer cannot fire you because you are pregnant, but they can make your life a living hell until you quit.  I would be straight forward but assure them that your work would not suffer.|`|HqVoLzjcaa	Me personally, would not tell them. In fact I would try to hide it too. Not too obvious that Im tryin to hide it though.  I don't think you'll get the job if you tell them you're pregnant. Though it's illegal to discriminate against someone that's pregnant they can doo it anyway. They'll find another reason why you didn't get the job.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	In the book What to Expect When You Are Expecting it says that you should wait until they offer you the job. You simply say"  I would love to work for your company but first I would like you to know that I am pregnant." That way you don't screw yourself over immediately and plus you're telling them prior to starting the job. |`|CWNMcnKSaa	Well if you are 5 months you should be showing some so you shouldn't have to tell them in the first place but If you aren't showing just yet then just tell them during the interview!|`|4950a07572223837b5a8e8f237408729aa	  Be honest from the very beggining...|`|AA11210211	I would be honest from the get go.|`|0e539871ad8eb4b77f7ddc8a1e19fd53aa	In this economy I would not say anything to them. If they know you are pregnant they will not hire you. (at least until after the baby is born) Your number one priority is getting a job. 
vVMm2BWIaa	It's deffinately switching pills,<br>  periods are like rain,<br>  you can never really know if it's going to rain, until it does.|`|IllWKAUGaa	well, its only a few days, which isnt a big deal, and is most likely from switching BC...nothing to worry about! changing the hormones in your body is going to affect your periods, because thats what regulates them!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	You changing birth controls probably just messed up your cycles. If you haven't had sex since September before your husband left and you had a period after then I don't think you could be pregnant. |`|pPMtG5iKaa	your not pregnant. i can tell you that much, your body is just getting use to the pills. it messes your period up a little. cause it did for me too. just be a little more patient. but if its over a month go to your woman doctor

I like them reversed. I like Karen as the first name with the names you have picked out.<br>  I have two common names and I go by my middle name, which can be spelled and said differently.<br>  I like Addison Karen but the last name could make a difference.<br>  CONGRATULATIONS!!!!|`|myw1GBiKaa	Out of those I'd go with Addison. It's the most unique. If you're going to give her a common, old-school middle name like Karen, run with a little rarer, attention-grabbing first name. |`|dwOLnFnlaa	I love Isabelle and Noelle. I think I like Isabelle Karen better though. Isabelle is very pretty, I've always loved it.<br>  <br>  Congrads!|`|DkVqOe8Iaa	I love Isabelle Karen. Very girly and feminine. I think its gorgeous.<br>  <br>  I would spell it Isobel Karen though.|`|UKPYoPKuaa	I really like Karen. To be honest the names you've chosen are abit trendy/bland...BUT out of your list I pick Addison.<br>  <br>  I would suggest Karen Elizabeth instead.|`|5sYzlAjPaa	My favorite is Addison Elise<br>  |`|HBgnkltfaa	The only combination that flows well is Isabelle Karen, and Isabelle is my favorite name on your list.  Noelle Karen would be second choice; I like that Noelle is rather uncommon as a first name, and it sounds very classy.<br>  <br>  I don't like that Addison Karen and Madison Karen have double-N sounds at the endings.  They also feel very trendy, so I'm not sure they'd make very sophisticated adult names (which seems to be what you're going for).<br>  <br>  Other ideas (I hate made up and misspelled names, too!):<br>  Rosabelle Karen (Belle or Rosie)<br>  Annabelle Karen (Annie or Belle)<br>  Anneliese Karen (Annie)<br>  Susannah Karen (Zannah or Susie)<br>  Adelaide Karen (Addie)<br>  Adella Karen (Addie)<br>  Amelie Karen (Amy)<br>  Lilia Karen (Lily)<br>  Juliet Karen (Julie)|`|e17025d63b591426b1c43c2197cd3fc8aa	I don't think Addison and Maddison are not suitable names for a grown woman. Plus, Madison is spelled wrong and you don't want strange spellings and Addison is a disease. Those two are definitely out. They also don't go well with Karen because they end in N. <br>  <br>  Isabelle is pretty but very common and overused. Isabella Karen does sounds nice though and Isabelle does lead itself to many nicknames. <br>  <br>  Noelle is pretty and underused. Noelle Karen doesn't have the best sounds but it isn't bad either. I am tired of the nickname Ellie though. I hear it way too much and it has lost its appeal. <br>  <br>  Isabelle Karen gets my vote. |`|mo32sf4raa	Noel Karen<br>  Addison karen<br>  Madison Karen<br>  Isabele Karen<br>  <br>  Isabelle sounds the best,, but the nn izzy isnt cute.<br>  Noel is cute and elli or ella are darling NNs!<br>  Madysen is cute but id go with Mady as a NN.--(Madysen)<br>  Addison-- sounds a bit masculine.

59224cc9c350f004c8d7be4e04e40501aa	the dr tests are just like the home ones. a blood test would tell you for sure. with my first pregnancy, i was still home testing with negs till i  was nearly 10 weeks pregnant, the tests just werent picking it up. sometimes bloods are the only way.. good luck.|`|sChWfSkaaa	pregnancy tests can be wrong. if you're really unsure, take another test or get a blood test done.<br>  there are things called phantom pregnancies (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-pregnancy)," rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-preg...</a> where your body thinks its pregnant or something. but the chances of that probably arent that high.<br>  good luck though, i hope you get the result you want|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Yes it can because they are pretty much the same thing. They may be a little better but I doubt it by the way they look. If you really think you are pregnant maybe you should wait a week or so and test again or you can even request a blood test. Good luck|`|wOepU836aa	Yes, the "pee on a stick" tests can be wrong. If in a week you still have the symptoms call your doctor and request a blood test. They are almost 100% accurate. Best of luck.|`|1JrL80Z2aa	yes|`|N4vVhEATaa	Typically if a pregnancy test is wrong, it tells you, you are not pregant when you are. If it says you are pregnant, there's a very good chance you are. But of course, nothing is 100%.
iYKqbUTiaa	I am also 8dpo:)  I have been trying to hold off on testing, but you are making me think I should test tomorrow morning!!  <br>  <br>  I would wait until tomorrow and take another test.  Yes, it is very possible that there is not enough in your system yet and only concentrated FMU shows a trace.  It should get darker for you over the next few days!!  Good luck and congrats!|`|633f3a8b519b67edeca7960de8dff5feaa	Positive is positive - even faint... Try not to pee for 4 hours or more or wait until the morning and take another one. Dont' drink lots of extra water, just normal. That will give you enough HCG for a reliable result.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!!|`|RvwsI1JEaa	sounds like it go to doctor though<br>  good luck :)<br>  x|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Even a faint line is positive. When I found out my test barely showed it but it did. I went to the doctor and took another test there and they said negative even though there was a line. So we called my fertility doctor and he ordered a blood test and it was positive. Good luck. If you are still unsure call your doctor and request a blood test. |`|lJKzHroJaa	pregnancy tests react to a hormone in the urine which you have when you are pregnant, since it is early there may not be enough of the hormone in your system to show up on the test properly. because there was a faint positive it sounds like you could be so give it another week before taking another one. the second neg may not hav picked up the hormone so don't get stressed! just keep relaxed and give it time! wish you all the best and hope it works out!
isokr9cfaa	well if you had unprotected sex about two weeks ago you should be able to have an accurate test at this time. Just go to your regular doctor and tell them you need to have a blood test done to see if you're pregnant. They will be professional, even if they're thinking judgmental thoughts in their head they're smart enough to keep their mouths shut. Also as I'm sure you know you're privacy is protected by laws so your doctor cannot disclose any information to your parents about your visit. If you don't feel comfortable with that their are plenty of pregnancy resource centers willing to help young mothers. I don't recommend planned parenthood. I've never had a good experiencece there. They always seem rude and unprofessional to me, but who knows that could just be where I live. Good luck. |`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	If and when you make an appointment, tell the receptionist that you'd prefer someone other than Doctor <what's his name>.  It happens at every office where there's more than one doctor.  Some people like a doctor who's very serious, some want one to joke around, some women perfer women doctors - it's nothing to feel bad about.  If we all liked the same thing, that poor girl would have 3 billion boyfriends.<br>  <br>  As far as what you do, wait until you should be getting your next period - then take an early test.  Good luck in getting whichever result you want.|`|GPrw1JZkaa	is there no one in your family you can talk to, who can maybe help you. if not them go to a family planning clinic they are more caring than doctors, and they will help you and not judge you.<br>  above all don't worry but do something  and it will put your mind at rest.|`|SIhEme03aa	If your last period was in August and you didn't have one at all in September, then the results should be accurate by now.

(Or even worse yet, you could have more than one STD and be pregnant - it most certainly is possible)<br>  <br>  You need to go to a Doctor and be checked out.

You very well could be pregnant and just not have enough of the hormone to show up on a home test.  A blood test would be much more accurate and tell you how far along you are.  You need to go to the doctor and just ask for a blood pregnancy test.  You don't have to tell them anything else.  If you are pregnant, they will give you a packet with lots of reading material on pregnancy and some prenatal vitamins.

If so, that should make things a tad easier.<br>  If you're not preggo, the good thing to take from this is for a minute there, you thought you might be. Think of all the things you have to buy, all the things in your young life you have to miss out on because you have to be responsible now. I know you don;t want to hear it, but I hope you use birth control after this if the test comes up negative. It really wouldn't be fair to the child, to have to be raised by someone so young...think of all the things the child would miss out on.<br>  Anyway I know you're scared, but you need to go to the doctor and ask for a test there. When you call, ask for a different doctor, or even call another doctors office. Don;t be scared of them, they work for you! YOu need to see someone either way to know for sure...because if you are pregnant, you have to start taking prenatal vitamins, and eat right, don't smoke or drink...there are lots of lifestyle changes that need to be made.<br>  I hope everything turns out ok for you, be strong!

From your post, you actually already know that. I promise I will only offer advice. <br>  <br>  The only good way to tell if you pregnant is to go to the doctor and get the blood test. A family planning center might be a good place to go to. The doctors there will be helpful and will also be supportive, especially if you are concerned about your age. <br>  <br>  While you are there, you might ask him to prescribe a birth control device. <br>  <br>  Even though birth control only prevents pregnancy, they are not 100% effective. However they are better than having unprotected sex which almost always gets you pregnant at some point. <br>  <br>  Do yourself a favor and prevent and protect yourself.   |`|GZ4FZC8Naa	You took the  test 13 days after having sex not dpo (days post ovulation) Since you  are irregular  you do not know when ovulation occurred or even if it has occurred.<br>  At this point I suggest you wait another week an retest then.<br>  <br>  Also since this has happened before you may  want to consider some birth control, the pill will help regulate your cycle and prevent pregnancies. <br>  If you  need to go to the clinic, just call and tell them you need to see a doctor in regards to a possible pregnancy. It's the doctors job to treat you not pass judgement on you. And though this does not mean they  won't  try to talk to you about birth control, if you do not want to discuss it then  you  can just say  so.|`|Y7xlBWdsaa	When I first read this, I thought you really needed help and/or scared. At the end, I realize that this is not the first time you've went through. A couple of months ago to be exact. Seems like you won't learn your lesson until you get pregnant. Also, you don't want to go back to the dr because you know that he or she will talk to about the wrong decisions your making. AND IT AIN'T EASY and I'm grown with full support. It's way to easy to take a test. I'm done preaching. I know you didn't want to hear it. Maybe if you read your question, it'll make you think more about what decisions you're making in your life.<br>  <br>  Yeah, it's too early to take a test but not too early to take a blood test. I doubt that you're pregnant though. I hope all is well. If you're not, do yourself a favor and get on BIRTH CONTROL and use condoms. Finish school, go to college, start a career, get married, and then have children. If your not going to go in this order, at least make sure you're financially stable.  |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Well usually before they do a blood test they will want to do a urine test. If you don't want to see the same doctor see if they have a plan parenthood in your area. They deal with a lot of the same situations I'm sure. But honestly maybe you should start thinking of using protection so every month you don't have to make an appointment with someone to get a test done. I'm not saying it because of your age because there are plenty of woman WAY older doing the same thing all the time and then get all freaked out when they turn out pregnant. Start using your heads. What are you going to do if you are pregnant. You're going to be a mother and you haven't even finished high school. I'm not trying to be mean I just think the people out there having sex all the time really need to think before they do it. They just get pregnant and then have an abortion.

It is terrible, a child is a child, the sex isn't the issue, it is about a new healthy family member. <br>  <br>  For that specific reason, we've decided we do not want to know our baby's gender, and if we do find out, then we will defiantly be keeping it secret until after birth!<br>  |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I don't think you are overreacting.

68xqRr5raa	Seriously, I wish everyone on here would stop being so frickin' high and mighty about marriage. It's not right for everyone and people should keep their opinions to themselves unless asked. You asked for information on trying to conceive not whether or not you should get married. If you guys want a baby and are committed to one another and to raising a child together then that is all that should matter. Lots of married couples have kids and abuse them or hate one another and end up divorced so obviously it isn't a perfect thing. As for your actual question, check out an online ovulation calculator or get an ovulation predictor test. And, yes, leakage is normal and my fertility dr says that you don't need to worry about it. 5 minutes max is long enough to lay down afterwards.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|GOvYXl3oaa	Strongly suggest buying the book Taking Charge of Your Fertility by Tony Weschler - it will teach you everything you need to know about the best times to get pregnant, fertility signs to look for, and how to figure out when you're ovulating. This book changed my life and helped us conceive.<br>  <br>  I'd also buy an ovulation predictor kit at the drugstore - ClearBlueEasy makes a good digital one. Follow instructions inside as to when to pee on the stick.<br>  <br>  Also - after sex - prop your butt up with a pillow or two and lie there for at least a half an hour. Some sperm will leak out - but there should hopefully be millions of them - so that means a lot stay in you.<br>  <br>  Best of luck and healthy baby dust to us both!|`|XX1ULDvtaa	The best time to have sex when trying to have a baby is when you are ovulating.  To know when you are ovulating you need to be aware of when you typically start your period (the day of actual red blood) and how long your cycle is.  Average is 28 days.  <br>  <br>  There are many websites (my favorite is parents.com) that will use this information to calculate an estimated ovulation date.  <br>  <br>  Have sex during this ovulation time and viola.  HOWEVER, if you are successful the first month of trying, consider yourself extremely lucky/ fertile.  <br>  <br>  Many women, including myself, have been trying for 6 months to a year before getting their BFP (Big Fat Positive)!  <br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|BgwPEPfYaa	it is normal and you should just prop a pillow under you when you have sex....and afterwards for a half hour to increase your chances|`|JKzQnTgSaa	Try taking an at home ovulation test. To be honest, I tried for 4 years and the second I took an emotional break from trying my husband and I found out I was pregnant!

But I had that problem too. They tell you to use your fingers to close the lips or whatever. lol. If you don't know when to have sex I recommend using a clear blue easy fertility monitor. They are a little pricey but totally worth it. I tried to concieve for 2 1/2 years and used one in June and found out July 16th I was 3 weeks pregnant. You can get them on ebay a little cheaper. Good luck and really look into getting married first. It will be a lot better for starting a family. |`|RDfm7WPeaa	Take an ovulation test or google your cycle to find out when you are ovulating.<br>  Have sex 2 days before you ovulate and 2 days after-wards.  This helps build up his sperm.<br>  Have sex in the morning because that is when his sperm count is higher. <br>  Lay down for at least 5 minutes after sex to help those little guys find where you want them to go.<br>  <br>  These are your best chances.  Make sure this is what you both want.  If you aren't married, having a baby can really put a strain on your relationship.  GOOD LUCK!!
DzOW16Ahaa	First let me commend you on your choice to have the child.  That was a very brave and mature choice for a 13 year old.  I would lose the boyfriend.  He doesn't sound like the kind of guy you want to stick with.  I dont really know your father, but you probably will need support.  I think it is best for you to tell him, or some other adult that you can trust.  I have personally met many young women close to your age that have chosen to keep the child and everything turned out fine, so try not to panic.  No matter what people tell you, adoption is perfectly normal and in most cases the child grows up having a very happy life.  If you are Christian (or even if you aren't)  a good idea might be to talk to a preacher for more advice.|`|I2LNO2F0aa	you know sex any way with protection or not you can get pregnant not you brought a child in this world your whole life is about to change! you keep it and you deal with it and now you know sex is for people that are ready and that means there ready to take responsibilities like this ..abortion is something your parents and you will have to figure out but just know if you do abort the child you took a life and it didn't ask for you to bring it in this world so just know that|`|87rJBeQ9aa	wow you are in a very serious situation to state the obvious. are you planning to keep the baby? Is your mom around? Does the baby father have a job? and is he a good stable guy? and what were you thinking seriously? Im 22 and would be freaked out if i was pregnant right now so Im sure you are highly stressed. Youre going to have to tell your dad regardless does he knw about your boyfriend? YOu can email me by the way if youd like at xtinkerbellx@ymail.com|`|v3LnJycKaa	umm if your dad was very strict you wouldnt hav ebeen able to date a 21 year old for very long before he found out an dpressed charges. <br>  <br>  <br>  so what happened to going back to jail, how did your drug test with your PO not show if you smoked the day before... hmmm pathological liar.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	You have some serious problems. I would lose the loser boyfriend first of all. WHat you should do is tell someone and get your boyfriend thrown in jail for statutory rape. Then you wont have to worry about him killing you because he'll be locked up. Either way though you are going to have to tell your dad. He's going to find out eventually anyway. Talk to someone though. If you are 4 months then you'll start showing soon probably. Good luck and maybe wait on having sex again until you're married so you wont have to worry about this again. But I do appreciate that you don't want an abortion. That is just wonderful. If you and your dad decide you're not going to raise the baby then please at least give it up for adoption.
KhxIyJOcaa	my mum had 4 m/c and she still gets upset around the date she would of been due, so i've seen the effects it has on people :(<br>  i could never even imagine what it would be like to go through that.<br>  i'm tearing up writing this :(<br>  my heart goes out to you i just hope you have some better luck in the future <br>  <3<br>  x|`|CrcNh7FKaa	It is completely normal to feel that way. <br>  I had a bad pregnancy where my first born would have been born on October 10th, and even though my true first born came on the 8th of October, it doesn't distract from the 10th of that month. Its been 7 years, but I still reflect on it. <br>  Its still a part of grieving, so allow yourself to do it. It is healthy and part of the process.<br>  I sympathize with your loss. Good luck over the holidays.|`|yQAumDA5aa	Not bad at all to feel like that. You are human with real feelings. It is difficult, but just think that there is a reason that your m/c's happened. Maybe the reason is very unclear because you do not know why, but things will get easier with time. |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I am so sorry. That is horrible. I totally understand why you would feel that way. I think anyone that has lost a baby would feel the same way. God Bless you and your family. I will keep you in my prayers. |`|Q0xm1Kodaa	I know how you feel. I just lost my first about a month ago now. Last night I was thinking how I would be three months tomorrow and how around Christmas I would be feeling my baby moving around. It is vvery hard. Sorry for your lose.|`|rC6gL7KOaa	Having a m/c is hard. I never really new much about m/c, didn't know anybody who had every had one. Then I had one in September and I was devastated. I kept feeling like something was wrong with me. I became pregnant right away after the m/c and I'm now 8 weeks. Needless to say, it's very stressful to me and I keep thinking something will go wrong. The only peace and solace I get is when I pray. I don't know if you are religious or not but prayer is the best healer I've ever known. Pray to God and ask him for peace. You will have a child when it's time. I'm sorry about your loss and I pray that you don't lose hope in having a baby one day.
YcbuG715aa	its different for different people.. no two pregnancies are alike.. Some people dont get it at all..

GOOD LUCK!!|`|3b17edd3b4e73692d332dda278331c47aa	morning sickness can start right away and last the whole pregnancy. some women are lucky and do not get it at all. <br>  <br>  you will be 20 weeks when you get your first sonogram to tell weather it is a boy or girl<br>  <br>  and you shouldnt jump on trampolines or eat a lot of fatty foods. do things just as your normally would but remember that your baby is getting everything you eat and if its not healthy for you its not healthy for your babym|`|9op65iQVaa	why in the world would she have to give it up for adoption?<br>  <br>  She can love her child and make it happen.  It's in the heart and mind, not the age.  <br>  <br>  just eat right, and stay away from drugs.  you can detect the sex of the baby at like 4 months.  Good luck.|`|ozq92BHoaa	it depends on the person not everyone experinces morning sickness ...and u have to be atleast 18 weeks to get the anatomy ...u can eat almost everything just watch salt,too much tuna,too much caffine and other stuff thats not healthy!!|`|7lpjlcqCaa	Hello!<br>  Congratulations on your baby, I hope all goes well for you.  How far along are you?  Some women experience morning sickness right away, but for the most part, they say that if you're going to get it, it happens around 8 or 9 weeks.  I am currently 22 1/2 weeks and still haven't had it.  It is supposed to diminish/go away after your first trimester is over (2nd trimester starts at 13 weeks).  <br>  <br>  I have heard that anywhere from 15 weeks (if you are having an amniocentesis done) and up is when you find out the sex of your child.  Typically it is 20 weeks.  But, some doctors will do that ultrasound at 18 weeks for you.  The waiting is so hard!!  But, it is so exciting to find out when that day finally rolls around.  <br>  <br>  And, to answer the last part of your question, I have found a website that lists the things you can't eat and the things you should avoid, but can have in limited quantities.  If it is not listed, it is safe to eat!  I don't know if it is listed, but don't drink tonic water, I have read a report on the internet that there is an ingredient in it that can cause complications.  All the best to you!!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.americanpregnancy.org/pregnancyhealth/foodstoavoid.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanpregnancy.org/pregnan...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Oh, if you want a really good book to use a resource guide, I would buy The Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy, The Pregnancy Bible or Pregnancy, Childbirth and the Newborn.  The latter two are really informative for the pregnancy, birth and care of your new baby.  (My personal favorite is The Pregnancy Bible, it's loaded with pictures and information)|`|kau3VH2Zaa	hopefully your one of the lucky ones and won't get morning sickness because it usually starts around 8-9 weeks, you can tell the sex at your 20 week scan and when it comes to food just make sure you cook everything properly and eat healthy , they will give you a massive list of foods to stay away from but the only food i have been careful not to eat is shellfish. good luck!!!!|`|rlVHIKBdaa	While there are plenty of experienced ladies here who can help with advice, you really need to make sure you are seeing a doctor or a midwife. Prenatal care is the most important thing you can do for your baby. Your doctor will give you a list of safe and unsafe practices, including medicines, activities and diet you should and should not do while pregnant.|`|k3sL7mZtaa	I was 17 when my son was born! He's almost 10 months old now!<br>  <br>  You may never get morning sickness. Some women don't. I wasn't actually throwing up but I would get really dizzy and weak.<br>  <br>  In Canada (not sure about anywheres else) you have an 18 week ultrasound. This is when you can find out the gender!<br>  <br>  Basically, you just need to eat healthy. Try to stay away from soft or runny eggs just in case the egg isn't cooked. You can look all that stuff up on the internet!<br>  <br>  Good luck with everything! All the best! You will probably see a bunch of rude comments on here but just ignore them. But not letting them get to you, you're already better than them! Enjoy your little baby!<br>  <br>  I recommended the What To Expect When You're Expecting book too...it's soooo helpful!!!! Also What To Expect The First Year is great too.<br>  Another good one is Pregnancy For Dummies (funny title, I know. It explains everything well and doesn't use these huge medical terms!) I loved this book!|`|2IxhQFzNaa	It can start any time. Usually after 7 weeks. Some times later, sometimes sooner, some never get it if they are lucky. You can find out around 20 weeks. That's when it is the most accurate. But it can be wrong at any given time. I found out I was having a girl at 15 weeks. But I had them look again at 21 weeks and it was still a girl. Watch how much fish and what types you eat. Get a pregnancy book, like what to expect when you are expecting, they will tell you so much more. They say to not eat lunch meats unless heated up to hot and steaming, I have eaten them and me and the baby are fine, but I waited till after the 1st trimester to eat it. No drugs, alcohol, jumping, roller coasters, etc. |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Everyone is different. People don't always get morning sickness and some start later than others. It seems like most people find out around 20 weeks and I know that's when I'm going to find out. Now about what to eat. I know hot dogs are VERY bad. If you really want to know I would go to the library and check out books and I would by the what to expect when expecting book. It has really helped me so far. Good luck|`|0C9LhSAGaa	not everyone gets morning sickness but mine started when i was about 6 weeks pregnant.. u can get a pretty clear picture ( if ur baby cooperates) when ur about 17- 22 weeks to determine the gender.. and heres a list of things not to eat .. btw congrats and hope u have a beautiful healthy pregnancy! it goes really fast so enjoy !<br>  <br>  <a href="http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_should_you_avoid_eating_while_pregnant" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_should_yo...</a>|`|E0gm0mRBaa	1: usually around 8 weeks and you may just get nausea if you do get it. you might be lucky<br>  <br>  2: about 18-20 weeks if bub co-operates<br>  <br>  3: avoid alcohol, large fish like salmon and tuna and shark because of the mercury content, soft cheeses and under cooked meat.|`|xb4BhxWzaa	Don't listen to the sick mind that told you to give away that child - it's yours, and I'm proud of you for keeping it. 3 thumbs up (2 babythumbs, of course =) ).<br>  <br>  Morning sickness may never come; I think you should consult the doctor on the gender determination and a proper diet =)<br>  <br>  Have a great life for you and your baby.|`|OZnsSElRaa	some women never experience morning sickness as for what foods you should and shouldnt eat i recommend that you buy "What to expect when you are expecting" at your local book store.  i believe you can find out the gender at about 4.5 months, congratulations!|`|Zc0eVc8kaa	Im in your boat except im 18 and i want to be pregnant lol.. ah yer about 18 wks.. umm and to that person who said give the baby up for adoption definately not!!

ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	There are no known risks but doctors recommend that you wait to dye your hair until you are in your 2nd trimester.|`|78FXygtoaa	the chemicals and stuff you breathe in are bad for the baby especially during the first trimester, so they advise you not to do so, but if your are further along then they say it is alright|`|bvX8ycVzaa	Yes, you just can't bleach or perm your hair. The amount of chemicals in a dye that are actually absorbed into your scalp and cross the placenta are almost non-existent.|`|IllWKAUGaa	i heard not in your 1st trimester.|`|rINTzxvYaa	I think there may be a type of hair dye that is made for pregnant moms to use but the reason they tell you not to is because of all the chemicals that can due damage to your body and effect your babys health.|`|HkVKKwxxaa	I wouldnt.<br>  youll risk exposing the chemicals to the baby if u inhale it. so just in case.<br>   I wouldnt risk it if i were you.|`|hjaxuYnLaa	there are no effects recorded, so it's what you are comfortable with. there seems to be lots of debate, but no proof that it is a problem.|`|GiWVaREvaa	ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!<br>  worry about the baby your having!!!! grow up!!!!!!<br>  <br>  your about to dedicate your life to a baby! be responsible and stop worrying about your appearence!!

So it is normal to have cramps and I would be worried not to have them. I cramp all the time, am in 9th week now. Sometimes crams are more severe then I have ever experienced in my periods and pms. I reported that to my gyn and she said that there was nothing to be worried about. It may depend on what you find extremely bad and painful. Anyway, report that to your gyn next time you visit her/him.|`|pu6YIzaaaa	Unfortunately in early pregnancy you do get some strange pains that can be a bit scary. I had stretching pains quite badly with my first baby as it was a new experience for my body. I am 38 weeks pregnant with my second and I didn't feel the stretching until much later. They should ease of in a couple of weeks. Just remember if you are worried it is fine to speak to your dr or midwife or even go to a and e you have to put you and your baby first.|`|Jo1sgXWhaa	i had the same thing, i had bad stomach pains too and a bad lower back pain. <br>  its normal, if there were anything wrong, the pain would be unbearable and there would be blood.<br>  every ones bodies are different.<br>  if you are really worried, go to your doctor and ask for a scan, that way, they can check how your uterus,baby, womb and placenta is developing.it will help to put your mind at rest.<br>  Congratulations!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	As long as the cramps aren't accompanied by bleeding then everything is fine. Throughout your entire pregnancy you are going to experience cramps and pains all over and it's completely normal. If you are really worried though call your doctor. Good luck and Congrats!|`|H3QhJYpTaa	Cramps can be normal for first pregnancy ,<br>  It is usual that things are stretching ,But 6 wks is early for this <br>   You should see your doctor in case there is a problem  as there are little things that can happen, but if your doctor knows he will check it out and it is better to sure than sorry ,|`|pCFyGavuaa	If there is no heavy bleeding, then yes you are just feeling the wonderful pains of stretching!!!

Is4WEXUJaa	I'll be 30 weeks on Friday and I occasionally sleep on my back... I know all the hoopla about not doing it.. but sometimes I need to sleep and I really hate sleeping on my sides! I'm a stomach sleeper and since I can't do that I sometimes sleep on my back because I just can't take it anymore some nights.|`|MtC3CWZraa	You’re free. The problem with back sleeping is that it can cause back pain due to the pressure your uterus puts on everything under it. I certainly have that complaint, but if it doesn’t bother you, there’s nothing wrong with it. |`|9cu82009aa	Like Karrie and Starrs have said, it can cut off the blood running through major arteries, that's also why you shouldn't sleep on your right. It's okay with me anyways, I've always been a left sleeper, in my second trimester I used to wake up on my back like once a week or so... I used to wake up because I couldn't breathe properly though.|`|c82be9f8b06a325889e72909f57bb30eaa	I'm 34 weeks pregnant and sometimes sleeping on my sides just doesnt cut it.<br>  I find it hard to get comfortable now a days.<br>  yeah, I know it's bad to sleep on your back but from time to time that's the only way I'll fall asleep. Mind you I don't stay in that position all night long.<br>  One thing I've found that helps is LOTS of pillows. My bed barely has room for my husband cause it's like I make one big nest with all my pillows so that I can get comfy :)<br>  all in all I think theres no harm done.|`|a4fb671bdeb9d97a5ca6b59c2e09d198aa	You can sleep in any position that is comfortable for you. It is a pure myth that you need to sleep in certain positions at a certain stage. Your child is well protected, so as long as you are in good shape, so is your baby. |`|EHY3FnAmaa	If I were you I would sleep how your comfy. Its hard enough to find a cozy position~ <br>  But for me if I fell asleep on my back I woke up with intense back pains from all the pressure of my stomach. ( I got HUGE )|`|W2q3x3h7aa	the reason they say not to sleep on your back is because it makes alot of pregnant women's blood pressure go up.I always fall asleep on my back but I wake up on my side.your body was prepared for this because when you are asleep on your back and your blood pressure does go up pregnant women always roll onto their sides if you do have a problem sleeping on your back then you will roll onto your side without even waking up.you are fine to sleep on you back.congrats and good luck|`|hJwheleJaa	You are lucky! I can't sleep on my back or I get REALLY sick. I've had a flawless pregnancy until it comes to laying flat on my back. I get a fever, break out in sweats, and feel like throwing up. For a lot of women, it cuts off circulation and makes them really sick. However, if you feel perfectly fine sleeping on your back, then you will be fine and so will your baby! |`|xeXcB9UQaa	yeah i did by your stage i couldnt sleep on my side either it hurt too much i have had my baby now hes nearlly 7 months the midwife told me not to and tried not to even though i did sleep on my back i made sure it wasnt for too long for about 1 hour or so but im fine and so is my babba<br>  good luk by the way with the birth|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I don't sleep on my back because it cuts off blood to you and your baby.

Here is why:<br>  <br>  What positions should I avoid?<br>  Sleeping on your back: This can cause problems with backaches, breathing, digestive system, hemorrhoids, low blood pressure and decrease in circulation to your heart and your baby. This is a result of your abdomen resting on your intestines and major blood vessels (the aorta and vena cava).<br>  <br>  As far as benefits for your baby you should try to sleep mostly on your left side.<br>  <br>  You probably won't hurt yourself or the baby sleeping on your back but it is best not to.  If you must I generally would put some pillows under the top half of me to put me at an incline.  <br>  <br>  Karrie|`|sYqoS8OOaa	I am 34 weeks pregnant and I cannot lay on my back it's more uncomfortable than laying on my sides.<br>  <br>  My doctor told me that laying on your back can cause complications she even said something about the baby can lay on the umbilical cord which is not good so I just prop a pillow between my legs and lay on my left side and eventually I will fall asleep.|`|AA11629042	Like the first answer said,ive read it was a myth aswell that it does anything.<br>  I've laid on my back since it tends to feel more comfertable than on my sides.|`|sCkxTxeEaa	I slept on my back towards the end because i was uncomfortable sleeping on my sides, i just elevated my head alittle bit and my feet

qrfJ0ffiaa	Ok, you say you have been married since the kid was two? Then you are entitled to have a say in his development, your husband should really be noticing this stuff if you have! If this is really what he's like then yes he is being neglected, something needs to be done or he will be left behind in school. I actually think this is a genuine q (naive??). You clearly have other issues with this boy (from reading your previous questions) that need resolving, so I think the first step is to talk to your husband asap. My partner has a son and its not always plain sailing, but coming on here and discussing it, isnt doing anything to help you need to talk to your husband!!!|`|AA11569882	Definately.  He really ought to be able to sit and eat properly, and get his own snacks, and everything else you've mentioned.  What on earth does his father think of this, I mean, the child is his son and it sound to me like his mother hasn't taught him anything at all.  You must talk to his father about this, do some research on child development and show him graphs of where his son is, and where he ought to be.  Most kids can wipe their bum by the time they start school!|`|mx3gFmIKaa	I have an 8 year old son with an  atypical autism diagnosis and he sounds autistic to me.<br>  <br>  How do you know he's not autistic, has he been to a neurologist?<br>  Can you tell that I am autistic from reading my answers?<br>  For that matter can you tell 1/3rd of my contacts are autistic from looking at their q and a?|`|Pi8KfmOxaa	if there is anything wrong with this boy it will be picked up at school .im sorry but you seem very harsh on the boy so im not surprised you hit a raw nerve with his father. you really need to tread carefully as really if there are problems with this boy its really down to the father and mother to sort it out ,one good thing to remember he is just a child and none of this is his fault.<br>    edit   ive just read your other questions are you sure your not just taking it out on this boy because your in a unhappy relationship|`|YBQvzEhGaa	My son could do all of thse things by age 8.  However, hygeine was not important to him until he reached 10.  So with that being said, he would lie about brushing his teeth,never brush his hair, have problems with wiping his butt, and would just stand in the shower instead of actually washing. He still needs me to cut his nails too. He probably does know that difference between hug and cuddle and has just made up his own word.  I would think that your husband should step in and report this treatment to the proper authorities.  It is really sad that he is kind of behind and his mom does not care.|`|uP08b6K4aa	There's no rule book stating how old a child should be when they are able to tie their shoelaces or make themselves a drink etc, but I would agree that at the age of 8 or 9 he should have more ability than he seems to.  There is also no guarantee that when you meet someone and fall in love with them, it doesn't mean you will automatically have loving feelings towards their children, but I don't believe in this instance that you should feel hatred towards a child who clearly isn't being supported by EITHER parent if I'm honest.<br>  <br>  It's not just his mothers' responsibility to teach him to do things for himself, it's also that of his fathers and from what you've said, he doesn't seem that bothered by his upbringing.  <br>  <br>  This really isn't your problem, and my advice is to let them deal with the little boy, he's their son and their responsibility.<br>  <br>  Good Luck x|`|PHOyKsmPaa	Wow, you sound incredibly hostile towards this child. <br>  <br>  "And if you ask him a question you have to completely dumb it down" What a cruel thing to say!<br>  <br>  By the way "under-developing " is not a correct term in any way.<br>  <br>  Be kind. Be helpful. Don't be so judgmental.|`|5ci9IZd2aa	Sounds like he's neglected a bit, and hasn't been taught how to do the basic stuff. Maybe he needs someone like you in his life to spend a little extra time teaching him how to do some things. I say people meet for a reason.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Don't you just love trolls.|`|AA11537580	maybe he just doesn't want to and his mom is not taking proper care of him<br>  how is he at school??|`|ZegObNksaa	You sound a total ***** !|`|7e700825133cf6328b412b5715dc6692aa	Sounds like lazy parenting to me on his Mums part, i would cut them for him not many children can cut their own nails, But really his father should have words if she isn't looking after his child right.<br>  <br>  So your worried about him ... doesn't sound like it, its sounds like your criticising a child ..how about taking this up with his mother and his father about the child !|`|IRFbj0G9aa	I think it is sweet that you are concerned.  I don't get the impression that you are being mean about the child.  Just descriptive to drive the point home.  Can I ask a question, okay, so his mom is obviously neglecting him.  No doubt.  What does dad do on the weekends or when ever it is that he has your stepson?  Oh, just read the " I hate him part" look I don't know if you hate him or not. I will assume that it was an outburst of emotion that time and let it slip in the anonymity of this place.  If however you do, you are a loser for picking on a 9 year old and get a life.  If on the other hand you are truly concerned about this child, give him a break.  You seem to already have started to take an interest in him, so why don't you show him how to groom himself, and explain why.  You said he is not slow, so obviously he just needs the proper attention and he'll be totally independent and happy and well adjusted.  Show the poor kid some love.  And really, I don't think you need anybody's permission to take an interest and tends to the needs of your step son, in fact I think it is your obligation as well.  And I might say more than his mother if you dare call the DF that, cause you are very aware that this child in on the wrong path, and are taking a passive role if you do nothing about it.|`|jLYTKr33aa	Those delays are not delays that are caused by lazy parenting, as they are quite severe for his age.  The father should take him to see a developmental specialist immediately.  <br>  You, however, should stay out of it.  Anyone who says they hate an innocent child absolutely does not deserve to refer to him as a son in any way, shape, or form.  He's your husband's son, not your step son.  I don't care if you're married to his father - you are unworthy of such a title.  Being angry is no excuse - grow up.|`|o2H6DEHLaa	with all due respect where is you so almighty husband ,isn't he the fathers child? maybe the mother is lazy, doesn't care or really needs help, but  he is just has responsible for this child has the mum, so stop putting the blame only on 1 side.<br>  maybe he is like that because he is just visiting, if he had any special  needs the school would have said something,<br>  At th end of the day he is your family too, so if you think it is wrong interfere!!! the child needs it
dqSA7j7gaa	Thats hard to say, many people say its too early, and that you are feeling gas. I didnt feel mine till 17 weeks. Once you feel them for sure you will know.<br>  Mine movement was confirmed at my 19 week ultrasound when I felt him move and saw him head but me on the ultrasound.|`|kyvpycAOaa	Only you will know if you can feel the baby move.  Most of the time, however, you will first feel the flutters between 14-17 weeks.  And pressing on you tummy won't hurt the baby but with it being so small, you are most likely not going to feel anything.  Once you reach about 28 weeks, you will be able to feel a defined outline of the baby in your tummy.  Good luck |`|6vprgSIRaa	Im  3mths also and I have not felt any real movement either. This is my second child so I already know what it feels like. The movements will come soon. When they do look out. LOL! Sometimes they can kick sooo...hard. Especially after you have eaten. No you shouldnt press your tummy. It'll move when it gets ready or better yet when it's time. Congrats.|`|dvApWrjHaa	20 weeks is the average stage of pregnancy that you will feel the baby move so try to be patient and i am sure that your baby will start moving soon x|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Everyone is different. I felt mine for the first time last week and I was 16 weeks.|`|h99jcmmmaa	i felt flutters at 15 weeks|`|AA12073245	i am 17 weeks and im feeling flutters. and yes if you lay on one side for a long time and the baby gets comfortable then you quickly move to the other side then press on your belly, you may feel them move! i did! so it is possible, yes.<br>  <br>  he is about 4-5 inches big thats big enough to feel it. But dont worry if you dont. some people dont feel it until 20 weeks.|`|vpL67nETaa	You will not feel him by pressing your tummy.<br>  He's not too much bigger than a shrimp.<br>  <br>  However, it's possible to feel him at 15 weeks, but it's more likely that is gas.|`|988545e5cde987b90322ced29ffdd6b0aa	It can take up to 22 weeks before some woman feel their babies.  At first it feels like gas bubbles or fluttering.  Mine felt like popcorn going off in my belly.  But give it time and you'll feel your baby.  Pressing on your tummy doesn't hurt the baby.  If you do it to much, you might bruise.  But it doesn't hurt the baby.  But it only usually works when your further along and your baby is kicking and punching, and poking your tummy gets their attention.  |`|wx32VQSWaa	it's possible to feel flutters/quickening at 15 weeks. I've felt it as early as 10 weeks. It's really not that noticeable unless you're relaxing. I know it's not gas or hunger pains. So enjoy it if you're feeling it already. <br>  <br>  I don't think you can feel the baby if you press on your tummy. The baby is about 4 inches long. |`|mBeGdFO2aa	I thought I was 17 weeks when I felt the first movement, now my date has been changed so I was actually about 15 weeks. (1st pregnancy).<br>  <br>  It's not bad to try and feel the baby, you won't though as it's too small still.  But poking your belly won't hurt anything :)|`|dDVAUA9saa	I didn't feel any movement until 5 months (20 weeks).<br>  
COecrPrMaa	There are over 400 symptoms of pregnancy, all of which can be caused by something other than pregnancy.  The most prominent of all symptoms is a missed period and you haven't even missed it yet.  <br>  <br>  Wait it out.  Don't waste pregnancy tests either - wait until you have missed your period for 7 days.  I say this because, even if you are pregnant, your hCG levels must rise enough to be detected.|`|3e35f384e6ba91685b275ec068631f7daa	go and take a test|`|2j7KUon8aa	Just a heads up...even if he pulls out before he cums..there is still pre ***, *** comes out before hes even done....Always weat protection or go to the clinic and get birth control, your parents dont even have to know if you dont want them to.<br>  You can go to a clinic and get a prego test for free, or go and pick one up at the store...and then get another one a week later to double check..<br>  if it comes up Positive both times, book a Drs appt.<br>  Good luck|`|HzV1LeIvaa	I usually take a test once a month for STI (sexually transmitted infection)<br>  unprotectant sex can be a worry, there is traces of semen in "pre-***" for guys, even if he pulls out it is not a reliable contraception.<br>  <br>  the cramps could be chlamydia if they are really bad.<br>  <br>  Go take a test, but I would say there is really nothing to worry about, its probally a bit late.<br>  <br>  The sore throat and high temperature is probally just a viral infection.<br>  <br>  Hope everything is ohk!|`|qP58qlVraa	It sounds like you are pregnant, go to the drug store and get clear blue , if it is going on 2 months it is possible. I hear ya when you talk about cramps but not your period, not the same kind of pain at all ( happened to me when i first found out i was pregnant.) <br>  Well take a test only one way to find out;) good luck.|`|Ws1hky6Zaa	take a test|`|T5JYcQ3laa	First of all, you shouldn't be having unprotected sex. The "pull out" method of birth control is not a reliable one. Use condoms, or go to your doctor to discuss birth control options.<br>  <br>  Second, see if you get your period. If you don't get it within 5 days of your expected start date, take a pregnancy test. Make sure to follow the directions exactly to get the most accurate result. If the test is negative, I'd recommend that you wait and see if you get your period within the next few days. If you still don't get it within another 5 days, take another test. If it's still negative, I'd recommend going to see your doctor. If the test is positive, see a doctor ASAP.<br>  <br>  And contrary to the other poster, having sex does not mean you're a tramp. Just please, be safe and responsible. Use protection and make sure you visit your gynecologist yearly for an exam.|`|pid8uVfoaa	yep..even if the guy pulls out...men can ^^^ while inside a bit...but not intentionally at times...and still get you pregnant...stop worrying your self out and get an EPT test...if not drink lots of grape juice...this helps antioxidants cleanse your system faster...therefore get your period faster...hope this helped and best of wishes...|`|2d6fe4a597fdb87adcfc2f79ab488125aa	I think the most logical thing to do is go and have a urine test done to positively know if you are or are not pregnant. It only takes less than a minute :)<br>   I am a nurse, so I know, i do the tests every day!|`|IinVLhoMaa	The quick draw mcgraw method does not work. You need to get your dumbass on birth control if you aren't pregnant.|`|TTvvVRcBaa	You need to get a test, the pull out method doesn't work, sperm is still in the pre-***.|`|JfdQF7Ocaa	go to the chemist and purchase a pregnancy test. if it turns out that you are pregnant you should then tell your parents
bTlhBX3daa	Yes, it's really common. I am a person who normally runs off 5 or 6 hours of sleep a night and I remember sleeping for 10 to 12 hours, and still needing long naps during my first trimester. I was DRAGGED down tired, like literally could not pull myself out of bed. <br>  <br>  For most women, this gets MUCH better in the 2nd Trimester. You will have almost as much energy as you did before you got pregnant. <br>  <br>  The 3rd Trimester can be tricky. Apparently most women get a burst of energy and start nesting (cleaning, preparing for baby, etc), but I have been fatigued all over again and I'm still waiting for that burst of energy.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I experienced extreme fatigue until around 12 or 13 weeks I think. I think it's pretty normal. I'm sure it will change soon. Good luck and congrats!|`|IuJjYz6gaa	That's pretty normal.<br>  <br>  You probably will start to feel better in 4 more weeks or so, but you could feel tired the whole pregnancy.|`|OU9xnW86aa	At about 13-14 weeks you will start to get your energy back.|`|5IrunL2Xaa	You'll feel like you've been run over by a steamroller your first trimester.  I was in a semi-sleep state during this time.  The second trimester you'll have a renewed energy and actually start to feel human again (provided all is going well).  The third trimester continues along and then baby starts growing by leaps and bounds, you'll feel uncomfortable, won't be able to sleep well (because you can't get comfortable) then about the last month or so you can't wait until delivery day.  When that happens, then all the real fun begins!!!  Best of Luck.|`|483e49b9ba8ea322e76bb65dc8f82a66aa	I hope its not the same for you, but I am 20 weeks and still dead tired, I sleep 12 hours at night and I am still a zombie all day. I have always needed a lot of sleep but it has gotten way, way worse now that I am pregnant. I don't get anything done, my place is a mess and all I can do is cry little hormonal tears because I sure don't have the energy to do anything about it!|`|HJe7ln7gaa	I'm eight weeks along as well and find it so hard to wake up every morning. Before going to bed every night, I always tell myself that I'm going to wake up early or atleast on time the next day.<br>  <br>  BUT....<br>  That rarely ever happens!! LOL Don't worry! We're all sailing on the same boat! :)|`|aGYvN9pfaa	I'm 14 weeks and the sleepys didn't start to wear off until around 12-13 weeks. Sorry momma. <br>  <br>  But hey, everyone told me, "sleep while you can" cause once the baby cause you won't be getting much rest.|`|DTg3USppaa	wow, I was severely tired until I was about 10-11 weeks along I slept all the time!!!|`|5QDouy4Uaa	I am 36 weeks tomorrow and I think the only time I wasn't tired all the time was for about 4 weeks total from about 22 weeks to 26 weeks. I hope you have better luck|`|oltCj6Kcaa	Mine lasted through the 1st trimester (13 weeks) and then started easing up. Then it kicks back in in the last trimester.|`|Q8tf4B5taa	when you go into your second trimester 13 weeks, i think the first 3 months can be more tiring than the last.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	I'll be 18 weeks tomorrow...and I'm still tired. I don't think this goes away for all women.|`|EzbJsE5eaa	I hit 11 weeks today, and I have been sleeping at least 12 hours a night, and sometimes this includes a nap. I still do the normal activities around the house, but I am extremely fatigued. It's a normal first trimester thing, and sometimes it extends further than that. I wouldn't be worried! Oh, and a lot of my family think I need "pep pills," and that drives me nuts. It's perfectly normal to be tired, and you shouldn't be worried.
AA11637393	I'm sure it will be fine.  She will tell you to stay hydrated and to get up and move around every few hours.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I'm sure it will be fine. I think it's a little farther into the pregnancy that they would say no. Good luck! Travel safely!|`|62cQv3z3aa	she will say no... it is bad for the baby health

He was eating between 3-4 ounces every 3 1/2-4 hours. At that point he started sleeping 5 or 6 hours at night, woke up to eat, and then slept for about three more hours. He's now 8 weeks old and eats 5-6 oz every 4 hours and normally sleeps for 6 hours, wakes up to be changed and eat, then sleeps for about 2 hours and wakes up again. At that point I move him into my bed to sleep for another few hours, but he sleeps most of the night in his own room.|`|xM4eG8Xwaa	At one month my daughter (now 5 months) was eating 3-4 oz every 4 hours.

7IHMjy2caa	Generally protein in the urine is a sign of high blood pressure and a more serious form known as preeclampsia<br>  <br>  When protein is found in your urine, it can indicate that there is some sort of a problem going on with the function of your kidneys. The most common of these types of problems tends to be an infection of the kidneys. Later on in pregnancy, protein in your urine can sometimes be indicative of a condition that is known as preeclampsia. <br>  <br>  Preeclampsia refers to a condition in which your blood pressure is abnormally high during pregnancy. If you have preeclampsia, protein will be found in your urine. You will also retain water. Preeclampsia is often referred to toxemia or pregnancy-induced hypertension. More sever symptoms of preeclampsia can include fatigue, abdominal pain, headaches, nausea, the inability to tolerate light that is bright, blurred vision, shortness of breath, and infrequent urination.<br>  <br>  The treatment for preeclampsia will depend on how far along in your pregnancy you are. If you are far enough along, and your baby is sufficiently developed, it is likely that your health care provider will want to deliver your baby sooner than planned. If your baby hasn't developed sufficiently, and if your preeclampsia is mild, your health care provider will probably increase your prenatal visits, and instruct you to keep rested, drink more water, and take in less salt.<br>  <br>  It is possible for preeclampsia to keep you from passing enough blood to the placenta. This will interfere with the amount of oxygen and food that your baby gets, resulting in a low birth weight. In general, however, most women that have preeclampsia can have a healthy delivery, if the preeclampsia is detected early enough and is treated properly.|`|CpiLHcTlaa	yes your baby could be born early. be prepared for that but remember to stay as calm and stress free as possible.  you need to keep your blood pressure down the more relaxed you can stay the less likely it is you'll have your baby early. they'll only have it early if it gets really bad. they'll keep a close eye on your blood pressure make sure to tell your doctor about any strange symptoms. preeclampsia is only cured by having the baby. just stay relaxed and try and act like your on bed rest. not alot of long walks or strenuous activity's|`|VFUdAtrHaa	It means you are more than like preclamptic and will have to be monitored closely and IF it gets to serve the baby will be born a lil early. Just do what your doctors says , eat healthy and AVIOD STRESS AT ALL COSTS!! and you and you baby will be just fine <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK AND GOD BLESS!|`|jkFZb2aYaa	those are the signs of preclampsia.  be very careful, you have to take at easy and the dr. may end up putting you on bed rest.  make sure you tell your doctor all your symptoms as you should be closely monitored.  good luck, i wish you a healthy pregnancy|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It means that you have a good chance of having preeclampsia and you'll probably be considered high risk for the remainder of your pregnancy!

You are trying to take care of yourself to have a healthy baby.  Enjoy the baby and get child support.|`|ec20340954300949b5d60c056689dd33aa	of course everything happens for a reason!! <br>  I was on the other end not so long ago. a 19 yr old single mom who left the father because of the same kind of thing (verbal abuse and such) <br>  <br>  If I didn't leave him..I wouldn't married my husband...and now I'm pregnant with my second....see? everything happens for a reason.<br>  Its a very hard decision to leave the father. a very responsible one too. you're doing the best you can to take care of yourself and the baby. You go girl! lol. gl and congrats ??|`|AA11131747	I don't think there is some big plan out there.  However I do believe that you can turn any situation into a positive one, and be better off for it.  It seems that's what you've done, and that's wonderful.|`|w0eQpD7laa	yes, i belive all things in life happens for a reason. god ment for this to happen you right now the situation may be frustrating, but god knows what he's doin. when life gives you lemons make lemonade.turn this sour situation sweet. you have to trust in the lords plan for you. this was ment to happen to you, just like all other things in life. god would never steer you down the wrong path. you have got to try and be posotive about this.walk by faith not by sight. all is done by gods will. have  faith.|`|H0fXySX9aa	every thing happens for a reason,<br>  that's what life has mapped out for you its fate,<br>  <br>  my husband had cancer last year and was treated with chemotherapy i found out yesterday im pregnant,im only 4 weeks along but never ever did i think we would have anothor |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I think they do. God has a plan for all of us. I mean it stinks that you don't have the father to help you raise your child but if it's what is meant to be then it's meant to be. God Bless you and good luck. |`|UBaJ0jmSaa	Well, I don't believe in god but I also don't disbelieve. I think that everything happens for a reason, even if it seems bad at the time, it's working towards something good. And yes, this pregnancy definitely happened for a reason. To make you feel better and realise you have stuff to live for, etc. Congrats on the baby :) I bet it'll be beautiful.|`|I8TD9wj3aa	Yes, I do believe that everything is for a reason! Already your life has changed for the better, imagine how much more better it will get when your baby arrives in a week or so! Good for you for getting rid of the father as well, he doesnt sound like a good influence...<br>  See this miracle as something that happened to help you be a happy, whole person, and in time, you will meet the right guy as well!|`|0LwBdwAPaa	yes everything happens for a reason, my ex was doing drugs and a drinker-i left him and never looked back - you can do bad by yourself, but now you have a baby to look after, not a MAN, you will be fine, i was a single mom of 2 boys     and my husband came into our lives, and been great, and he also adopted the boys, it will happen,stay postive-congrats btw....|`|AxqFNFCSaa	Yes, I believe that everything happens for a reason. Even if it doesn't make sense to us when we are going through the rough stuff, it will eventually make sense and the outcome will be what it is meant to be. <br>  Just have patience and faith and everything will always work out.<br>  Good luck to you and take care.<br>  <br>  Edit::<br>  Why the thumbs down for my opinion and beliefs??|`|0e42ae3330f635c54f9c483463de8478aa	I think that everything does happen for a reason!  I believe God has given you this amazing miracle that you are going to have with you for the rest of your life!  I know that there may be other problems in your life, but I think that babies can make the world, and your life seem so much simpler and beautiful!  It's also amazing that you have quit smoking and drinking!  some women can't even be strong enough for that!  I wish you all the best of luck!  Keep your head up high and stay strong!  I will pray for you!!
cfdooGylaa	I am 21 weeks 5 days pregnant, have never experienced morning sickness, and have NO bump lol. Nothing to worry about, we are just lucky. I'm sure in a few months you'll be sorry you asked this question =). Congratulations! |`|Xc02z608aa	i was like 15 or 16 weeks when i finally got my bump, just a little one to start with and I felt great through my entire pregnancy so I would just enjoy it.  |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I didn't really start getting any bump at all until about then and now it seems that it just happens all of a sudden. I'm sure in the next few weeks you will see it all of a sudden one day. |`|ZBc16tOvaa	congratulations bumps come later good luck|`|T0r5hofiaa	Bump will come believe me!|`|HZ1KoWLKaa	just lucky, people would kill for that |`|7BLf8mLMaa	I'm thirty four weeks pregnant, and I look like I'm only five months or so. I can still suck my stomach in, and it just looks like I've had too many taco's or something.<br>  <br>  Maybe you'll end up like this. The OB says the baby is measuring fine. That's all that matters. People come in all shapes and sizes. <br>  <br>  Be patient. Your bump will come.<br>  <br>  |`|5TtCByFIaa	You are clearly in shape; many women who have strong abs/core do not show very much all throughout their pregnancy (take a look at gwyneth paltrow). Feel lucky that you didnt get morning/lunch/dinner/evening sickness like me. Enjoy your time. <br>  Good luck :)|`|QV90nnQuaa	im  23 weeks and have no bump at all...but i was a "big" girl before....it just depends...everyones different. the only way i can see it is if i lay on my back...|`|ixzT5y1gaa	your baby is about an inch big...you wont get a bump till about 20 weeks

Im due a week after you!
fPX1lD8uaa	You'll be fine... they just check everything with the baby to make sure that everything is going the way it should be..., heart, fingers, arms, face and sex (if you want to know what your having).  Drink orange juice before you go to get the baby moving... they need the baby to be active.    <br>  <br>  Good luck and don't worry... everything will be fine.  :  )|`|nZEaXRJEaa	I just had my 20 week ultrasound last monday. Its nothing bad. Usually if you've been fine throughout the pregnancy so far, this is just to measure everything and see that everything looks good. Also if the baby coperates, they can tell you the gender (if you want to know).Congrats and good luck.<br>  |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I just had my 20 week ultrasound yesterday. Everything went great. First thing the u/s tech did was check out the sex of the baby for us. IT'S A GIRL!!!! Then after that she just measured everything to make sure she was growing right. She checked out the organs to make sure that they looked good. Everything is going to be okay. I'm sure your baby is fine. Good luck and Congrats!|`|WsEFCpemaa	I was so nervous leading up to my 20 week ultrasound. I had the ultrasound and everything looked fine. Just try to relax.|`|E6DbRMoSaa	My strategy was, relax, chill out, and if in the unlikely hood something should be wrong deal with it then. It will do you (and the baby) no good if you're worrying about what if's. Enjoy the experience! :-)|`|zcEpnjlRaa	Oh this scan is wonderful, me and my partner had a really good machine where we saw babies head and saw baby yawn and rubs its face!!! Truly amazing! but we argued after that as he wouldn't let me find out the sex lol!!! but all in all beautiful x|`|83TkWic3aa	I know I may get several thumbs down for this, but I want to be honest with you. I have had two successful pregnancies and both times during my 20 week ultrasound, something came back indicating something was wrong.<br>  My son had a cleft lip and palate and my daughter has CDH, a hernia in her diaphragm. <br>  It's very scary hearing that, but, and I can't stress this enough, as much as it may break your heart to hear something is wrong, I was very, very thankful to know it before my babies came into this world so I could have time to know, understand and adapt to what they were going to need and what I had to do as a mommy to care for them and that the doctors had time to plan a delivery and what was to come next. <br>  So whether or not your baby shows he or she to be normal or have an abnormality-every time you feel that baby flutter, it's letting you know that everything will be okay, mother nature will show you the way. I wish you the best of luck, being a mom is the biggest blessing we as women can receive.|`|AA11061445	i had mine last thursday and yes i was worried but everything was ok i have a healthy baby boy daniel<br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/16705548@N06/3008597376/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/16705548@N0...</a><br>  <br>  
K2jT1z5jaa	hey hun,<br>  <br>  Ill try to explain this clearly..<br>  <br>  The earlier the ultrasound the less it will be off. The later on in the pregnancy the more it will be off.<br>  <br>  So the reason docs ask for ultrasound at 6 weeks or 10 weeks or 14 weeks is to the due date is approximate. As the earlier the ultrasound the less it will be off the due date by only a few days here and there..<br>  <br>  The ultrasounds around 20-26 weeks will be off approx a week. With the dating<br>  <br>  Ultrasounds done 30 weeks + can off 2 weeks before or 2 weeks infront. the due date/ As they go by the size of the baby. not the LMP.<br>  <br>  Definitely stick to your LMP. because that will be 40 week mark . And the 19th will be 41 weeks.<br>  <br>  God Bless hope this makes sense (keep the LMP date)|`|FGjanFY1aa	definitely the u/s bc it's measuring the baby's growth.|`|5QDcpmGpaa	Hey<br>  u/s are more accurate as they go by the development of the baby and work out what stage they are to what date your due!<br>  Which ever date you prefer to go by only 2% of babies are born on time so id go for the later date then if the earlier date was the right one it will hopefully come sooner than the date youve got in your head, good luck and congrats|`|HyXGhW8iaa	what i did was split both to meet a date in between.<br>  <br>  ex: U/S stated Oct. 4th and LMP was for 9/23 so i met the date for right in the middle (9/30) and guess what?? lol...it worked...my baby was born right on that day!!! lol...i might have been a concoinsidence but fun experiment. do it and let me know your outcome! jajaja|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Ultrasounds are more accurate!|`|EgZz6EK9aa	the ultrasound|`|A4tmVI4Jaa	They say that early ultrasounds are more accurate than LMP, but if you are certain of your LMP and have regular cycles I would go with Jan 8th.
AA11710504	It's true that the danger with cat litter is only a problem with a cat infected with toxoplasmosis.  I'm not quite sure what the chances of it going airborne are, but either way, dirty litter is nasty.  <br>  <br>  I saw your smoking question also, and I have to agree that you either need to SERIOUSLY put your foot down regarding these things, or take more drastic measures to either remove yourself or them from the picture.  Don't take chances with YOUR child's health, even if your roommate doesn't care their own kid.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	It's only dangerous if you come into contact with the litter box waste.<br>  Girl, move out on your own!|`|b17cb0e70d1cd57271e4ba763c7fbc30aa	Speak with your roomates...its not only irresponsible as a cat owner not to change the litter, but also they need to consider the fact that you are pregnant. Cat poop can't actually do any harm to you unless those cats are infected with the bacteria (usually outdoor cats more likely are) and then you touch it. The bacteria that causes toxoplasmosis is not airborne.  But still its gross and having 4 cats myself, I know how it can stink really bad if it hasn't been changed in a while.|`|18fee9a65c9b24c8d1e4002446409fc9aa	Talk to your roomates. Let them know that you really need to have the catbox changed regularly for your health.  I'm not really sure what to do about the allergies, though.  The only thing I would suggest would be to stay as far away from the cats as possible.  Make sure your roomates are keeping them out of your room/bed/belongings.<br>  <br>  If you're not handling the cat litter, you should be ok.  Just stay away from the box.|`|47778874900147882bb71b79f43be905aa	Talk with them. They should understand how dangerous that can be for you and the baby. If not, you'll have to report that...|`|KDW7gvckaa	Kitty litter is only dangerous because of the possible threat of catching "toxoplasmosis" which is transfered from an infecte cat through it's poo to a human upon contact. I had 2 cats of my own and I am 40wks 3days Pregnant. I have changed their litter myself every day of my pregnancy, just taking extra procautions - cover my face with a hanky, wear gloves, and shoes. What I'd be more concerned about is your allergy to cats, being halmful to your unborn child. How bad is your allergy? Whip the butts of your roommates to clean the litter trays, if only sometimes!|`|ad85d5de5af1adec0348d2ac968ff392aa	i think you should talk go your room mates and do something about it because thats very dangerous for your BABY
9bUN1AHFaa	The early spotting is a sign that you could be pregnant, but it could just be for no reason.  Sometimes we spot mid cycle and it can be related to ovulation.<br>  <br>  If you used a condom then there still is like a 3% chance you are pregnant, so I wouldn't worry to much yet.  Take a test when your period is due.  The timing that you had sex could have been a fertile time for you.<br>  <br>  I am glad you are being responsible using a condom, perhaps talk to your doctor about getting on some birth control, that way you are even more protected.  Take a test when your period is due.<br>  <br>  Good Luck:)|`|jNgh3e3Faa	Go to the doctor or health department and get tested. (for stds, too, please!)<br>  Breasts are tender near your period. <br>  And if you are or not, make sure you get some birth control pills and condoms. Two methods are better than one. Always. One for you, one for him. Good luck.|`|6L9jJnchaa	I know you hate this answer.<br>  <br>  Take a test.<br>  <br>  EDIT-----A lot of those symptoms actually point to you having a bladder infection..I would go see a doctor.|`|OU9xnW86aa	i'm not even going to read your question<br>  <br>  the answer is TAKE A PREGNANCY TEST|`|FWdMuM2vaa	A lot of early pregnancy symptoms are similar to those that you are about start your period. If you have just recently become sexually active as I am assuming you have, you're probably just paranoid. Odds are, you have nothing to worry about at this point. Especially since you're using protection. Just be safe. |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It is possible. I would take a test to know for sure. But you may want to think of going on birth control and always make sure you use a condom if you're going to be having sex. Also, you need to be aware that if you're having sex you always have a chance of getting pregnant no matter what precautions you use. Good luck.|`|95CM5WfQaa	go down to the chemist and buy a test, if it neg and you still think you may be, do another in a week.<br>  <br>  but if he used a condom then you should be safe, he would (should) of told you if it broke or if he took it off.|`|gsJLU82waa	the first three syptoms dont usually occur that early in a pregnancy..its osunds like your just worried ...you might be test in the beginning of dec. but i think that you have nothing to worry about |`|I7myOp8Qaa	Take a pregnancy test or better yet have a doctor check you out. Good luck.|`|8ijNyte5aa	i agree..<br>  take a pregnancy test right away|`|Fmb6s67Kaa	ur 15 wtf??? SLUTTT!!!!! take a test and hope u dont reproduce!!!!! |`|RXr7OQwkaa	Yes I would agree take a pregnancy test. reason ... too many to list, these feelings your having, body changing could be for many reasons.<br>  And if the test comes back negative, you might then want to see a doctor, you could have other problems needing medical attention.<br>  <br>  By taking the test you eliminate that as the cause, now you work on finding out what else could be going on. <br>  <br>  Best of Luck to you (both)|`|3CVfUiiJaa	Why don't you just google "pregnancy symptoms" You'll find a great list of all possible and very common symptoms of being pregnant.<br>  Alot of the things you say are also symptoms of getting your period.  So yes you could be, but no one can tell you that you are but a test or your doctor.|`|iwYu32N2aa	preg test or go to a doc. Thats what everyone is going to say
yznZqcznaa	I strongly believe in breastfeeding however I have not been in the situation yet, since I don't have a child.  It does surprise me when women choose not to, when they can.  I think it is very selfish on their part, and is robbing the baby of vital nutrients only breast milk can afford, and also of the bonding experience.  I will never understand women who do this.  Please note that I am NOT referring to women who have tried and were unsuccessful.  That is a situation that can not be helped.|`|65baadde1a27b20964ccb07ad83092e0aa	I totally agree with you.  If you can do it way not.  It's the best thing for your baby, It helps bonding, it's FREE, it's always there when you need it,  It is our god given gift to feed our child, and it breast feeding can help you lose that baby weight.   <br>  <br>  I don't know why in this day and age people will not even give breast feeding a try I think it is sad.  I am going to breast feed no matter how hard or award it might feel. I want the best for my baby.      |`|EnH8jv6Taa	I want to breastfeed my baby thats due in 2 weeks but i am soooo scared that my milk wont come at all, as of now my boobs still havent changed!!!!<br>  I have 2 other children and i bottlefed them, i wish i would have breastfed now that i think back on it|`|ezpaCQuIaa	I breastfeed  my baby for a little less then a month then I dried up.    I plan on breastfeeding my 2nd child hopefully for longer then a month that's if I can.  I really liked breastfeeding it came very easy for me.|`|9f781acdd2a8d587f475cd9992a7adeaaa	I plan to breastfeed my baby. She is my 1st!|`|8Abnw9w7aa	I appreciate that some mothers are unable to breastfeed or have to stop earlier than is recommended to return to work. That is fine and I would never want to make them feel guilty about it.<br>  <br>  But as for the mothers that don't even try - they should be ashamed of themselves for cheating their baby of the best start to life! And so should mothers who were unable to breastfeed their first baby and don't even try with subsequent babies. Every child is different and deserves a chance at the breast! |`|7wj3t5uJaa	Well I intend to breastfeed, and personally don't understand why anyone would choose not to at least give it a try as even formula companies have to admit that "breast is best." But I was also raised by kind of hippie parents and was breastfed myself until I was 3, as were my 2 brothers. But not everyone comes from the same background. If someone else doesn't want to give it a go, that's their choice. Even if I don't understand it and would never choose it for my own baby, it doesn't really matter what I think :)|`|oHmVGBCEaa	im a mum of 2 and didn't breastfeed either with my 1st i planned to but when i really thought about it i wasn't sure i could since the idea of having ANY part of my boob exposed in public didn't work for me both my kids have developed into happy healthy kids breastfeeding is about personal choice i see no wrong in doing it and course its how nature intended nor do i see wrong in a mother not doing it |`|3aQZV2cRaa	I breastfed for all three of my children for a long time. I was just way too lazy to get up in the middle of the night and make up bottles. Traveling was always very easy and there were never any last minute trips to the chemists for baby milk formula. <br>  <br>  Breastfeeding is the easier option. |`|6D4wSKriaa	I think as long as there is no medical reason for not breastfeeding every mum should give it a try, if it doesn't work for you then fine, but at least give it a chance.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I plan to breastfeed my baby but I know that sometimes the baby just wont latch on and so they can't breastfeed. I know that my mom had that problem with three of us children. |`|eYpNBMyzaa	i couldn't breastfeed i tried for several days so my doctor recommended i use formula instead i wanted to but it just wasn't working |`|7W8ihXA4aa	I can never understand why, if a mother can breastfeed, she would choose not to!?!  It helps you to bond with your baby, helps to shrink your tummy back down to size and is the best thing in the world for your baby.  I breastfed my son for 3 weeks and would have loved to do it for longer but i got mastitis 3 times and the pain was so bad that after the third time i gave up and put him on formula (which i was gutted about!).  Even though i had a rough time with it i am planning on breastfeeding this one when she arrives and am hoping that this time i will be able to do it for longer.  I understand that some people really cant.  I have a friend who could not get any milk out whatsoever and after three days of trying gave up and gave him a bottle (she got literally a few drops out when she tried to express).  Another friend of mine though left her milk to dry up and was pouring for days because she had so much milk.  I think for some mothers its a vanity thing, they dont want saggy boobs (which will happen anyway) and for others they see their breasts as sexual things.  |`|JQcIwPXJaa	I breastfed my daughter for 10 months. It was extremely hard. I don't want to sound mean, but I think that a lot of moms are selfish when it comes to breastfeeding. It is very hard for the first month and a lot of moms would rather not put in the effort and just formula feed. My daughter had a crooked jaw (it healed it just happened during birth) and would actually bite down on one side in order to get any milk. It got so bad that I was bleeding and had to pump and feed her for 2 weeks until I healed. A lot of my friends kept telling me that it wasn't worth it(they gave up a lot easier), but I wanted to put my daughter's health before my own comfort. There are many diseases that are preventable just by breastfeeding such as Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis. One of my good friends since early childhood has this and is now in a wheelchair, completely blind and can barely move his fingers. Can you imagine being his mother and knowing that if you had only breastfed that your son's life would be normal? I would do anything for my children especially breastfeeding to help them be as healthy as they possibly can.
CjYEe6IRaa	only if its safe to lick yours. who  know's she could give you your christmas present early and you'll be stuck with an std for the rest of your life. Better then your best friend it'll stick with you till the end. |`|m1RTNmqsaa	I love having that done. =] As long as shes clean, doesnt stink or doesnt have any STD'S then why not? Alot of men do it.|`|fprEm2JXaa	if she has it then yes <br>  <br>  and wrong section|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Yes its true.  Sexually transmitted diseases are transmitted through bodily secretions, such as vaginal fluids.  |`|VVQv9GX1aa	You can get STD's but you can't catch AIDS. AIDS develops from HIV, which you can catch from oral.|`|4QTHSTbbaa	Only if the girl has any herpys/stds/or aids...<br>  then you could get it.<br>  <br>  other wise if she doesnt have anything then your fine!|`|8VJwoGXKaa	Very true!  Don't do it!|`|rBq189W1aa	HIV - chances are low, but it's not impossible.<br>  <br>  Other STIs such as herpes, warts - yes. Definite chance. <br>  <br>  Be careful where you put your mouth! But once you've been with a girl for a while and you've both been tested - go crazy!|`|zrHLiU0Faa	Oh yes. You can catch everything you can catch with your winkie that way.<br>  <br>  Get a "dental dam" or a "vagina dam" I dunno, one is for the dentist the other is for vaginas. You'll figure it out.|`|t16ueKIGaa	Why is this in the pregnancy section?<br>  <br>  You will only catch those things if she has them. HIV is transmitted through bodily fluids. Others you could catch but only if the girl has the disease in the first place.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Well if she has any of those STD's then yes you can get them. Maybe you should know the girl before you start licking her so that you don't have to worry about it. |`|ePTHGuMZaa	You can only catch those things if she has them!!! You don't worry about catching it when you have sex do you? It's the same difference.|`|isokr9cfaa	yes it's true, it's not safe.|`|xD1LbRi4aa	Well you make sure that she has no std's or herpes first.....|`|mFQydvncaa	yes its safe if she is safe! and this is the wrong section|`|4ead5dde649b8ca448598942dc4779b4aa	it is only safe if both you are clean and disease free. keep in mind that it is also only safe when the both of you are each others only partner. from the sound of this question and where it is posted you are kinda young. you should wait untill you are older to become sexually active! but i commend you for asking. feel free to ask any other questions that you may have. and be wise! some sexual mistakes can not be removed!  (hiv/aids, baby, herpes)|`|9Guj407Caa	well, you kinda posted in the wrong section.  But if she has herpes then you will get herpes.  but not genital herpes.  you'll get fever blisters.  and it goes both ways.  if you have a fever blister and do that then she will get genital herpes.  the only way to transmit aids that way is if you have an open sore in your mouth.|`|n4XVtn02aa	only if that girl has those diseases but if the girl is safe and has no diseases than your fine.|`|aE2PwHymaa	no its totally not safe you've never heard of pillow pants wait till she's 18 and he leaves
u7kDLuklaa	If you are bleeding abnormally heavily .. saturating more than one pad an hour you need to be seen immediately.<br>  <br>  If you are bleeding reasonably and otherwise feeling ok, then all you can do is wait it out. Keep yourself comfortable with Tylenol or Ibuprofin. Make sure you do not develop a fever.<br>  <br>  See your doctor if the cramping is severe, a fever presents, or bleeding is heavy .. they will prescribe a pain medication, check for infection and possibly do a D&C procedure to "clean you out" if the bleeding persists.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and im sorry to hear that|`|e0xpYnv1aa	What do you mean what do you do? You obviously went to the doctor because you know it was a miscarrige.

If the baby isn't they will probably do a D & C, which is scraping your uterus out!|`|9hrJfhIIaa	You need to go to your doctor - they will make sure your body expelled everything. I'm sorry.|`|QYYWBrG7aa	you need to go to the ER.asap.|`|nah8tOF6aa	go to your doctor|`|iAEPYfcPaa	ask your doctor what caused the miscarriage. if it was something wrong with your own body, there is a chance it might happen again.<br>  <br>  don't keep trying until you get straight answers from your doctor. you might be unable to bear children.<br>  <br>  in that case, you can be like my parents and adopt! =)|`|FSY30gbvaa	Please see your ob/gyn. They need to see you to make sure your body expelled all the remains. If anything is left, it could cause a VERY bad infection.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	You need to go to the emergency room.|`|qRwjtaNbaa	get to the dr and make sure you are ok
nkIH17Poaa	Who comes up with these questions?|`|kbIkVS0raa	I have never heard of that happening but I would just prepare for a baby now and I guess maybe look into adoption if you really don't want it.|`|gfohoYOyaa	The doctors would inform you of twins before the procedure occurred.  This situation sounds highly unlikely and I don't believe any clinic would say "you only paid for one".  That would be negligent and worthy of a law suit.|`|CJqK40uFaa	WOW......<br>  <br>  thats messed up! i would contact a lawyer and SUE THE HELL OUT OF THEM! but at this point, you can have the baby and give it up for adoption, if you dont want the baby. obviously it was meant to survive if they did a DNC and it lived! |`|pR4nLjyRaa	Ok well I would never EVER get an abortion but I will see things from this point of view...I would take it as a sign from God that I was MEANT to have a baby, and I would obviously keep it. Though adoptions an option....|`|HqVoLzjcaa	Is that even possible?|`|AlMpJ3xmaa	well personally, i would be devastated. i would love to have twins. but in this situation, i would just be happy that i still had one. things happen for a reason, maybe this person is just supposed to have this baby.|`|XzbRZCPUaa	i think you can say what you would do but being  in the situation is another story so i have to say i am glad i am not in that position so i don't know|`|aXESNuBKaa	you were really meant to have a baby!<br>  that would be a difficult situation.<br>  not at all sure what i would do..<br>  anyway, can that really happen?|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I don't' think that is possible. I think that if the doctor noticed that there were two babies not just one they would probably tell you. 
ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I would probably wait until this weekend. If you get a negative result then wait until next week. I think if it doesn't show up by then then you pry aren't pregnant. 
73193e3b067ba4736d1fab4da3289625aa	I surely do have a way to make him understand. Have your mother or an aunt or someone call and say they need you to come and look after them for a weekend (at least) a week would be better. Tell your husband he has got to look after the baby while you go and help your relative. When you get back he will be well aware of what challenges you have with your daughter. He may even take you out to dinner or buy you jewelry because he is so glad you are home. It is the only way anyone can understand anything in this life. Have them walk in your shoes for a while. Works wonders.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	leave her home for the weekend with him and go visit someone|`|BeNazR8Jaa	he works. he's tired. very tired. Sorry but you have to understand that outside work is just as challenging also and you as a stay-at-home mother have to work it out on your own most of the time. He can help but don't expect it.|`|2fB383F2aa	Have a weekend get away, but leave your daughter with hubby that weekend! Tell all your friends/family you know he'll run to for help what you are planning to do, so they can all let him know he has to do it all alone! I went away (not even for a whole day) and my hubby went running to his mom for help, ridiculous really!|`|Jcz29H2Oaa	best way to do it is to make him experience it! when he has a day off work, tell him, oh baby ive planned a day out with the girls. and you leave. make himmmm handel the baby all day. i bet he will appreciate you a lot more.|`|7aaceef242426e2a1e7394d78368ca77aa	My friend just went through the same thing. Her husband though that she just sat on her bum all day. Well he got laid off  from both of his jobs and was around all the time for a while and finally got to see what she has to deal with all day with two kids, and now after 3 years is just starting to help. Before he was around them, not even alone, for maybe a couple hours a week and always said they were so good. But the girls were just happy to see him.It has to be more than a few hours. Any little girl is going to act well for daddy for special alone time for a couple of hours. But they will get over that after a few hours, so it has to be all day or a weekend. Where he has to give meals (no takeout, make him defrost something from the freezer) deal with tantrums, and so on. <br>  <br>  Parents need to work together to parent (when they both are there), when only one parent is doing everything even though both are around children, even as young as 12 months, will take advantage of it.|`|FwN2Htoraa	I think you should try understand why she has tantrums? what she needs? every child are differ. you should study her first. Everything happen in your life has the reason whether the adults or children. Most important thing is how you handle the situations. Be positive.|`|TsSOFoWEaa	Guys never understand. They always think they're job is so much more work. The only way for him to see and understand, is for him to actually have her the WHOLE day and then see if she acts good with him the whole time.|`|8Rji1bvdaa	yeah, go shopping and leave the baby with him for a few hours......<br>  <br>  you get to enjoy yourself and he gets to understand...hopefully|`|kWXik6phaa	i have a solution...<br>  LEAVE HIM AT HOME WITH THE CHILD WITHOUT ANY HELP FOR 24-48 HOURS. let him do EVERYTHING..all the housework, child care,etc..<br>  hell get the point really fast unless he's a tool|`|jYLZYxDvaa	Leave him to do it for a few days.|`|Oa16XBiJaa	pee on his face|`|8bUKN0vNaa	I understand where you are coming from.  Our little lad is 18 months old and my husband just didn't understand why I was tired, or any of the other issues I would talk to him about.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately for both of us he has had to learn the hard way.  5 days ago I slipped and injured my back.  As I'm 19 weeks prego, my doctor has put his foot down and said no lifting, house duties etc, and to lay in bed and rest.  This meant hubby has to take time off work.  Now he complains about all the things I used to try and talk to him about.  He gets it now, but I wish it didn't take my back going to do it!
ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It is normal to get more discharge. You may have back pain from the pregnancy. I guess the only way to know if it was the bra is now that you got a new one that's the right size if the pain goes away then it was that, if not then it wasn't. Sorry I couldn't be more help.|`|QCUPeW8aaa	Maybe you have a yeast infection there very common in early pregnancy.....<br>  The back pain could be very well due to the wrong size bra.<br>  Your breasts have increased suddenly so it can cause you pain.<br>  Good luck and talk to your doctor!|`|X2jWWiDuaa	Finally, someone with the exact same thing going on as me.  They are pregnancy symptoms, but it could be pms as well.  I did a hpt but it came up negative, but I'll keep you posted on those!  Good luck!
dFOcEmWMaa	well you could be, or you could just be wet from the sex... its not all his juice ya know.  I would wait till your next period and if you miss it take a test|`|af2457c870be9622a6ab8dae585e8216aa	Not THIS Second but you could end up being pregnant. |`|B09QQz1Oaa	its possible, but I wouldn't stress about it until you miss your period.  The stuff dripping out could be from you, women secrete fluid like a man to help the sperm and that could be what was dripping.|`|T2iYetpkaa	not yet, but its possible to fall pregnant. <br>  you can still get the morning after pill. my sister was told you have to have it within 36 hours but i know a girl who had it 72hours later|`|BARCjDhnaa	Yes you could if this is something that you don't want I would go to your doctor and get the morning after pill straight away, other wise do a test when you miss your period|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Well it's WAY too  soon to know but it's a possibility if you had sex and the condom broke. |`|IOIoZiTDaa	Could be possible. But you will have to wait for monthly...then test if 1 week or more late.|`|ymMvAH04aa	yes
jFB8mm5faa	Around weeks 6-13 were the worst for me but I still have nausea at 32 weeks... My doc put me on Reglan and it helps. I hope yours gets better for some it eases up after the first few weeks. |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	My first trimester was actually pretty great. I only got sick like 4 times total and I would feel fine right after. I think I actually got worse in the second trimester. I don't have a week that has been the worst. Mine comes just all of a sudden and I can go weeks without throwing up once and then just one day all of a sudden I throw up and then I'm fine. My worst thing is the headaches. I can't wait for those to go away. They SUCK!|`|qhorJl9Saa	the week when i have to get up for work|`|nmu6coapaa	Sorry to say every week is pretty much as bad as the other until about 12 weeks!|`|PN7ELn3aaa	I didn't really get morning sickness until I was about 8 weeks along. I just finished my worst bout of it this last week, and I'm at 16 weeks now. It's different for everyone. You could be fine tomorrow...but in any case I'm sorry you feel ill, it is awful!
yy0LqCP4aa	I would say you are going to have your baby today or tomorrow for sure, but I think each women is different. Are you having any contractions yet?<br>  <br>  I started getting my first contractions at 11 pm(very faint ones), they kept getting a little stronger all night, I finally had my bloody show at 6 am the next day and had my baby at 2 pm.|`|nbSp469Waa	I say hours.  I woke up on a Saturday morning with my bloody show, had it everytime I went to the bathroom.  That night around 1130 I started having contractions, they were about 20 minutes apart all night long.  Then around 10 Sunday morning they got close enough to go to the hospital, I deliver my daughter at 307 Sunday afternoon.  CONGRATS AND GOOD LUCK!!!  Hope you have a smooth labor.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I don't know the answer but Congratulations!!! That is wonderful|`|et6tmKakaa	well if your not having contractions it could be a while i guess he/she will check to see if your dilated congrats im jealous|`|50e0975b0e8c470ea8e974086f449b63aa	It could be a week or two |`|uCSBFYIiaa	within a week if not this week|`|qT6WYd3Baa	Sounds like your baby might be here soon.  I had bloody show on a Friday morning, went to the hospital at 6/7 centimeters dialated the next day around 3pm and had my first baby on Saturday night at 9:40pm. Good luck
uLJE36JGaa	You have no obligation to tell him.  If you intend to raise the child on your own, or if you no longer want a relationship with him, then there really is no need to tell him.  It is your body, afterall.  I might suggest, though, that if your only reason for telling him would be in the hopes that you get back together, then you need to really think whether you want to be in a relationship with someone who's only sticking around because of a child, not because of love for you.  What's your support network looking like?  Do you have people close to you who you could call on for help with the baby when it comes?|`|1CEApjyRaa	Wow this sounds extremely familiar, except that my baby's father and I stayed together til I was about 3 mos along. I got tired of him playing games and cheating and finally made the best decision for me and our baby. He would never refer to the baby as if he was even existent. Even for a few wks after the ultrasound he was kinda weird about it. But one day when we were talking he referred to the baby as "my son." I was so happy. We had talked about getting back together but I really don't see that happening anymore. But we are friends. You have to tell him IF you are. That is his child don't deny him the chance to be a father if he wants it. There are too many guys that don't want it to not let the ones that do be present in their kids life's. I really hope things work out in a positive way for you. My Baby's dad had said he wanted a family, and then when it happened he got scared and flipped 180. But now at 8 mos preg. he wants to be there for his son. I can't take that away from him.|`|RE6GBw0Baa	take a test first off, u may be late due to all sorts.<br>  <br>  then tell him, or show him this question, tll him its his choice whether to be involved or not, but he must stick to thatand he is finacially liable for the child.<br>  <br>  dnt worry hunni i wish u all the best xxx|`|Xc02z608aa	i think he needs to know...as soon as you get confirmation, don't tell him that you have a suspicion...if you are positive then tell him.  And just cuz he got you pregnant doesn't mean that you must be together.  Sometimes it is better for the parents to work together to raise the child as a non couple...they get along better sometimes.  but if you are you are scum if you don't tell him.  it's his baby too.<br>  <br>  good luck  :)|`|In2hruCdaa	You should definitely tell him.  He deserves to know.  Ya'll don't necessarily have to be together just because of the baby.  But, the baby should have an opportunity to know his dad.  and the dad should have the opportunity to know his baby.  |`|qVmIokXPaa	I cannot help you now other than telling you to get on the dang Pill if you don't want to be writing us again...... Oh, & to tell you not to quit your jobs miss..|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	You don't even know for sure yet.<br>  <br>  Test and get a definite answer...and THEN tell him.  |`|L42LJ1P4aa	You don't have to trap him by telling him. If he doesn't want to be with you, he doesn't have to and you say you'll be fine without him. Just let him know if you're pregnant that this is not you trying to get him to be with you, tell him you're pregnant but that the two of you do not need to be together and you felt it was only fair to inform him that he's going to be a father. It's up to him if he wants to be a good father or not.|`|XeJtUGoSaa	Well first of all have you taken a pregnancy test to confirm that you are pregnant? I would make sure you are 100% before worrying over telling your ex. If you are congratulations! You made a wonderful decision to keep your baby! If it were me in this situation I would tell the father. Give him time to let it all sink in & leave the decision up to him whether he would like to be a part of the childs life. Congrats again & good luck sweetie!|`|TnCcOaFQaa	He needs to know.  You two may not be good together, but he may be a great father and has the right to know.  Just assure him that you expect nothing but he has the option of being in this child's life.  There are ways to co-parent without being together.  Just PLEASE always put the baby first and don't let your feelings for him get in the way.  Good luck!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Well you have to tell him. It would be wrong not to. I would wait until you know for sure though. And if you are pregnant that doesn't mean you guys have to be together. Staying together for a baby is not right. Just make an arrangement about where the baby will stay and visitation and what not. Good luck|`|c85b64431c97395283f0b5a7ec3562b2aa	You have to tell him, he is the father. But I do agree that you shouldnt get back together just for the baby. Take a test and see what it says and go from there. I wouldnt say anything to him until you know for sure. That way there isnt any confusion. |`|LwstxBm4aa	I think you should tell him when you know for sure. But just be honest with him. Tell him you want to keep it, but he is free to go his own way. |`|r4N3R0dtaa	You should tell him, he has the right to know as the father. |`|VlrHwb7Haa	if your are and he wants nothing to do with the baby, make sure he signs away his parental rights. you don't want a custody battle years from now when he gets  a conscious.|`|6PLSInPnaa	He needs to know!!
J3TRJPIwaa	Did you feel guilty or upset about aborting the last one. Or did you walk away from and never look back with regrets. The decision is up to you if you think you can do it again...|`|ZPmqYNuwaa	I think that if even a small part of you wants to keep the baby you will regret it if you have an abortion.  Your kids are now at really good ages for you to have a 3rd, and 3 isn't really THAT much harder then 2.  I would keep it personally, a life is too valuable to give away because it is slightly less convienent.<br>  <br>  Also, you sound really fertile, maybe consider asking your hubby to get his tubes tied if you don't want any more kids.  It's a simple procedure and then no more worrying about birth control or unexpected pregnancies|`|AA10390690	well i am saddened to see your husband can take the chance of getting you pregnant then saying "come on lets get a quick fix, abortion-to-go" as if you guys were going to mcdonalds, come on now! if you don't want this child, give the baby up for adoption. maybe you guys shouldn't have sex at ALL.|`|EyKJ737daa	Sweetie, each to their own.  Personally I would not abort but that is just me.  Maybe you should give it a couple of weeks first, see how you feel and see how hubby feels. You may change your mind.  I believe babies are created for a reason so there is a reason this baby is growing inside of you even with precautions you have taken.  Although if your husband really doesn't want any more children then he should be taking measures himself to get the snip! It is less painful and much quicker for him to do it than a woman to have her tubes tied.  A lot less expensive too mind you.  I suggest strongly though, that you both sit down and talk about it all.  Abortion is not always the best option, especially health wise for you.  Good luck sweetie and all the very, very best of wishes.<br>  <br>  Edit: Vasectomys are effective after 3 months so have protected sex till then and even then I'd give it an extra month to be sure!!|`|bnQ7im8Caa	i don't want to get all religious with you. but don't you think its a sign from God? you said you had an abortion 14 months ago, and your pregnant again, maybe you should keep it. and if you decide that you cant afford another baby by the time that you give birth, give it up for adoption theres many couples out there who wish they could give birth to their babies, but cant. why not give them the gift of a baby? think about it and talk about it over with your husband. Good Luck.|`|s1utniuvaa	You have to really sit down and talk to yor hubby about what you both want. If you really want this baby and you have an abortion you will regret it and resent him. Do you have any idea how far along you may be? That could give you some time to think it over and really make a decision. I wasn't meaning to get preggers either... I have 2 kids, a 10 y/o and 5 y/o and now i am 12 weeks with twins. It is going to be hard, but we made the decision to keep them. Have you thought of adoption? I know I am not a strong enough person to do that and I have a lot of respect for those who do, but that could be an option for you too. Just really think about things before you make your decision. Good luck.|`|Zpzp1W2kaa	Honestly your in a tough situation. I personally would never get an abortion but thats just me. I believe you should keep the baby. Kids know what they want but don't know the material things in life like we do. Your blessed to have those babies unlike people like me that miscarry and end up having fertility issues. God bless you and your new baby! Congrats and I hope you don't get an abortion. That baby deserves a chance.|`|vZwJyqc6aa	How can you have an abortion after having 2 beautiful children that you love? If you don't want to get pregnant again why don't you get your tubes tied or have your husband get a vasectomy? You already have 2 kids, they will do it.|`|iNWlJg4Oaa	Thats a tough one and men don't really understand how hard it is to go through an abortion, I think you two need to really talk about it and tell him how you feel. The bottom line is what do you feel inside go with your gut feeling. <br>  Good luck|`|x4uGfC4oaa	Don't get another abortion. Let another family adopt it if you don't feel you can keep it.<br>  <br>  You should be more responsible with protection if you know you don't want another baby.|`|EEapXFJ2aa	i think u shudnt abort anotherbaby.. ur gonna love it the moment u c its face wen its born.... but if u still cant decide ryt now u can take3months to decide coz thats the tym within which u can hav a safe abortion..|`|587533eca4604b2d23fa382dc6204d59aa	Seriously, this is why children shouldn't date.|`|DIZKlxNraa	I think abortion is wrong...|`|9a3sNrEqaa	Hey hun. I don't know if ur interested in this or not but I was watching "an adoption story" on the discovery chanel. It really opened my eyes to how many people are out there wanting to have a baby so bad and just can't. I think if you don't want to keep the baby you could give it to a couple who really wants one. There are open odoptions where you can interview the family and everything and make sure it would be a good fit. neways good luck!!!!!!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	If you don't want to abort your baby then don't. If your husband and you both decide that you can't take care of the baby then consider adoption first. You can always chose to have an open adoption so you can stay part of the child's life. But please don't get an abortion, it's not the baby's fault.|`|2ObqoJbKaa	I think that if you want to keep the baby then you should. I know he's your husband but don't let him influence or make you do anything you don't want to do. You'll regret it if you don't make the decision that you really want. good luck. Keep the baby hon, sounds like you really want it. You guys will find a way to make it work.|`|Wok0Y6ebaa	Don't get an abortion.  Its your body, don't let your husband dictate what you do.  Abortion was not meant to be used as a form of birth control.  I get that it is more responsibility for him too, but hey, you play you pay.  Has he given any thought to a vasectomy if he didn't want any more children?|`|zXVIPLIyaa	if anything keep it. that gives you 9 months to decide if you want this baby or not.  If you decide its not for you find a nice family to adopt it. make their dreams come true. but please do not abort another baby!|`|YeyPROgAaa	Condoms work. Geez.|`|5OsSGCdAaa	no no no...dont get an abortion...if u cant take care of the baby due to money problems then give the baby up[ for adoption...some ppl with pay thousands on dollars for babies...but please dont murder ur baby...give him/her a chance..|`|3VU38jizaa	Look into the eyes of your precious children and ask yourself if you can really abort this child. The sibling of your babies...a baby who you will love just as much as the children you currently have. Money is not everything in this world. If you ask children from a large family as adults what they remember the most about growing up they aren't going to tell you it was the ballet lessons they got to take or the real brand Kraft Dinner they go to eat...they'll tell you how fantastic it was to have so many siblings and talk about all the wonderful things they did together. Don't let society force you to believe that you are better off aborting babies than having them and giving them what little you can.There are many programs to help you and if you have to go to the food bank to put food on the table then so be it. God has blessed you with this child and has chosen him or her for your family. Perhaps you are meant to be the mother of many. Large families are wonderful. So what if your kids can't have designer jeans or the best of everything...they'll survive and that is the main thing....to survive. <br>  Love your children with all your heart..other than the basics of food and shelter, it is truly all they really need and all they will remember as adults.|`|Q8tf4B5taa	i know how you feel i found out i was pregnant last week i have a girl who has only just turned 3 and a boy who is 1 3/4 old. My partner was happy but my mum told me to get an abortion and my dad still hasn't spoken to me which i don't understand as im 26 years old my partner is nearly 30 and we are getting married. Im scared too wondering how it is going to change ours lives even down to stressing about how i will fit them all in the car. I based my decision to keep my baby around the fact that i don't think i could go through with an abortion without being mentally scared by the experience, like some of my friends. I think maybe sometimes these things happen for a reason and if it is meant to be its meant to be. We too are not rich but i think we will get by if we make cut backs. At the end of the day this is your decision do what is best for you and your husband, plenty of people have 3 or more kids these days we are not the only ones. Good luck!!!|`|U531TVPOaa	Well not to be rude but this is really something you guys should have figured out before hand. If you're dead-set on not having anymore kids, even just for the next several years, than why doesn't your husband get a vasectomy? I'm not rich and I have #3 on th way. You just make it work. Otherwise tie your tubes or something instead of destroying your uterus. Seriously, what's he going to do? Leave you if you don't get an abortion? You should be talking to him about all sides of this decision instead of asking random people on yahoo- We don't know you guys or how your situation is.|`|a479Y6sPaa	Sounds like you're more concerned than your husband is about the situation. He doesn't sound very responsible at all. <br>  <br>  My friend's husband once told her when she got pregnant with their second child " We can afford it, If you keep this baby, I'm leaving." <br>  She had to choose between her husband and her unborn kid. She chose the baby. I later asked her "What made you choose the baby?" and she said, "I just reasoned that somebody once chose his dumba** so who is he to deprive someone else from having a chance?" <br>  <br>  I can't encourage an abortion but I wish you well,<br>  <br>  God Bless:)<br>  <br>  The idiot with ultimatumm left. She had a girl which made two kids (boy 3 and baby girl). I asked her if she regrets telling him that because it caused him leave and have to raise her kids alone. She's so strong, She said "I'm not so mad about him for leaving the baby he didn't want, but I'm PIS*** about him leaving the one he did."|`|gJorRAkDaa	I agree with the answer above.  Abortion...just because you will be more financially stable without the baby.  The right thing to do is wait the 9 months...and give the darling to a loving family who isin't as fortunate as you are (being able to get pregnant and abort whenever).  it's sad to hear this story.  I have a friend that has been trying for 4 years and 5 miscarriages.  Give this little one a chance and give it to a well deserved family.  Then...I'd get your husbands tubes tied!!!!!!!!|`|vqp9qKuraa	when i found out that i was pregnant, my baby's daddy wanted me to get rid of it too. but i really wanted the baby so i decided to push through with the pregnancy. i now have an unbelievably great daughter. she makes me feel complete. anyway, about the abortion. i think its wrong in all aspects. physically, its bad for your body. emotionally, are u ready for another loss?, spiritually too.<br>  i think what u have inside u is a miracle. a gift. despite all the contraceptives u guys used, yet u still concieved. :) <br>  just like what the others are saying, u can put the baby up for adoption if its really necessary and let other families experience the joy of having a baby. but please no adoption.

9JdOD08gaa	You definitely sound pregnant to me.  Tell your OBGYN about all of your symptoms and the fact that it's been 2 months since your last period.  You could even take a home test and bring it in a show them that your getting a positive and request a blood test.  If you still come up with a negative at the doctors office then they should be helping you find out what else could be wrong.  If you can't get your doctors office to help you, then I would go to the Heath Department or a Women's Clinic and ask for a pregnancy test there.  Eventually the truth will come out.

The allergies wouldn't have been so bad if I would've just caught them sooner and never quit breastfeeding.  Things will go wrong.  Don't depend on your bf. for anything.

Even when your stressed and everything seems to be going wrong. when your feel the baby kick for the first time or look into it's face it all seems to be ok for that split second.  You can't make the things that stress you out go away.  You can learn to deal with them.  I am telling you now tho' don't worry about your stress hurting your baby, that's just one thing that your stressing about that you don't have to.|`|bIyBUC88aa	stress is not good for you or your baby...you need to get away for a little bit. go in your room by yourself and just relax. or go get a pregnancy massage. stress is not good for anyone, and your to young to be worrying about stress. (it ages you!!) <br>  <br>  p.s RELAX RELAX RELAX!|`|NUzypXwAaa	yes it can because the more stress you get you can affect the baby's mind too. When i baby knows the mom is stressed out than the baby will move more and have a bigger chance in water broke.|`|tJoK6NQKaa	Yes stress during pregnancy not good someone said that your baby will cry more after birth,
ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I go in for my 20 week ultrasound next monday and I'm kinda wondering the same thing because I really want to find out the sex. Good luck for yours today. If you try something and it works please let me know. |`|wx32VQSWaa	I've been informed that you're supposed to drink a quarter of 32oz bottle of water 30 minutes before ultrasound.

fPX1lD8uaa	Your doctor would have to send you in order for your insurance to pay for it.  You could pay out of pocket and get a 3D or 4D ultrasound done, and hopefully the baby will cooperate.. |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I think that if you want an ultrasound to determine gender then you would have to pay for the ultrasound yourself and your medical wouldn't cover it.|`|G6Mrn6Y3aa	NOT REALLY IF THEY ALREADY TOLD U NO, I COULDNT TELL AT MY 20 WEEKS ONE EITHER BUT MY PLACENTA WAS LOW SO I HAD MY LASY U/S DONE AT 32 WEEKS WHERE WE COULD TELL THE BABYS SEX THEN, EITHER PAY FOR AN U/S OUT OF POCLET OR WAIT TILL DELIVERY|`|zPwpHfXgaa	You Can Find A Clinic Near You That Will Do An Ultrasound But You Will Have To Pay For It.

AHyjocY2aa	Call your doctor.  With my first pregnancy I lost 10 pounds and thought it would never end.  After telling people I was pregnant and then learning more about morning sickness I realized I didn't have to suffer.  This time around when I was six weeks I threw up three times in one day I called my doctor and he put me on prescription pepcid, vitamin B6 and an anti-nausea medication to get me through.  I still threw up a lot and have lost about 9 pounds but I got through it a lot easier this time.  You don't have to suffer.  Call your doctor and see what he recommends.<br>  I just saw your additional details: sorry that's all the advice I have.  Nothing else worked for me.  I hope they get back to you soon and give you something that will help! Good luck!|`|LzyoJ36Vaa	Well, all I can say is eat when you can, I had the same issue.  I lost thirteen pounds to start out with, but I gained them back these past couple of weeks.   <br>  <br>  Try eating something like a nutrigrain bar in the morning, it helped me out alot.   It seemed like that was the only thing that helped me when I had morning sickness that kept me from eating.<br>  <br>  I found out that a pancake with syrup (not a ton or else it will be to rich) and butter helped my stomach as well.   <br>  <br>  If you feel that it is effecting your life in a drastic manner, than tell your doctor, especially if you need to work.   I don't think my doctor gave me anything for the simple reason that I don't have a job.  So yeah, I got to suffer through morning sickness alot.|`|g5UDCxS9aa	Aww, I hate morning sickness.  Mine was really bad and I couldn't do anything.  I think it happened more when I was getting stressed out.  Try to simplify your tasks as much as possible (maybe you could take a week vacation?)  I lost about that much during my first trimester.  Your ob/gyn will tell you if you're losing too much, though so don't worry.  Relax and don't force yourself to eat anything that doesn't sound appealing.  Break your meals down into much smaller meals that aren't spaced so far apart.  it's easier on your stomach.  Keep food with ginger in it because it seems to help.  If your prenatal vitamin is making you nauseous, try taking it with dinner or right before bed.  I even switched to a prenatal vitamin called Natelle (sp?)  it's a pink coated vitamin that your ob/gyn can prescribe|`|gG60OCZuaa	My best advice would be to keep a cracker or cookie like snack next to your bed and some water and before you even attempt to get up, force yourself to eat some and sit up in bed for a little bit and then get up. I know it sounds ridiculous and at times it feels impossible to eat, but I bought a giant bag of animal crackers and left them next to the bed and ate a handful before I got up every morning and it would at least post pone the nausea for an hour or two. <br>  <br>  Hope it helps!|`|JQcIwPXJaa	I used Zofran (Rx) and it helped a lot. You can also try Vitamin B6 it really helped my sister in law.Try not to let your stomach get empty eat crackers or bread and some carbonated drink. Carbonation really helps upset stomach. Also, TUMS Smoothies did wonders! I hope you start feeling better soon!|`|hswTS1jVaa	I know how you feel.  Another thing that I noticed that has helped me is to eat later at night.  If I remember to eat something late at night, I usually feel a little better in the morning. |`|LXc9tGJVaa	I know what you mean. I'm 32 weeks and still throw up sometimes. My best advice to you would be: to prevent morning sickness from even beginning, eat saltine crackers slowly with ginger ale, 7up, or sprite--NO water; it will only make it worse. then after an hour or so if you don't feel funny or sick, then I'd suggest eating something bland and not spicey. Just eat your food slowly. If it continues, ask your doctor if there is any kind of medication you can take to help with it--I know there is, but my doctor hasn't offered it to me. Good luck and I hope you feel better!|`|55IMnlcwaa	Im so sorry your going through this I know it SUCKS! Not to scare you or nothing, but I got really sick like this when I was 9 weeks up until 10 weeks and then found out through ultrasound the baby lost its heartbeat not to say thats why your sick - but they gave me medicine called Reglan to take and it worked great... try asking them for that and for the time being crackers and ginger ale helped me... and peppermints too.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	When I get sick I use this candy called preggie pops. You can get them at motherhood, I'm not sure where else you can get them. But they are just hard candy you suck on and they help with nausea. If you are really concerned though you need to contact your doctor to see if there is something they can prescribe you so you don't lose too much weight. Good luck and congrats|`|Yn2n26zXaa	Sounds like you would benefit from an anti nausea drug called Zofran. I had to take it too. I also swear by Sea Bands. I got mine at the drug store for $12 Those help so much. I would talk to your doctor about Zofran. It really helps. Good luck. It will get better. Oh and ginger tea helps too!

So I bought EPT Certainty - the one with the digital 'pregnant' or 'not pregnant' results. I got 'pregnant'. I went to the doctor and was 4 days pregnant - 4 DAYS!

They're a little more expensive, but I recommend them if you really want to know.|`|5EiShLZZaa	It could have been a faulty test...I would wait a couple more days and take another, or just schedule an appt with your doctor and get a blood sample run, then you'd know for sure.

FUkZSoVGaa	Well, I would definitely advise against it.  I had mt first when I was 16, and just had my second (and last) at 20.  Even now, being married, with my husband in a very stable job, and me being a stay at home mom...things are tough...It's hard to raise kids, especially when I missed out on a huge part of being a kid myself.  <br>  Finish school, go to college, be young...have a family when you can financially, emotionally, and physically support it.  Not yet girl...not yet.|`|DZB0WCmmaa	No, it's too early, soon you may want some nice time for your own self, to get wild somewhere or with your boyfriend.

Buy a baby doll.  The public already pays to raise way too many children.  You need to consider the life of the child that you want to bring into this world.  Get a college education, wedding license, and a good job, so that the child has positive roll models, good financial support, and a dad who won't up and leave when things get tough.  Can you and your boyfriend currently afford rent, insurance(car,home,life,health), car payment(and gas), utilities, formula and diapers, your food, clothes to put on you and the baby, and still have a little money to afford a night out so you do not go nuts.  Until you are ready to support and give up your life for a child, do not do one the injustice of bringing him or her into this world for your selfish gain.  Take some time and think it through.|`|84f4374bdc6d86131ec48ade47938d4faa	For someone so clever you are a silly, silly girl.

Its constant stress with all the worrying about every little thing they do, and wondering if you're doing something wrong that might harm them in any way. At 17 you still have a lot of life to live as a single woman, all though being a mother is wonderful you also miss out on alot if you're too young!

Right now, you have a lot of choices. <br>  But as soon as the tester goes blue, you have only 2 choices; to keep, or not to keep. <br>  And if you choose the former, then all the choices that you have right now will be gone for ever. <br>  Once you are a mum, the children must always come ahead of anything you want. If they need food and you want new shoes, the shoes have to wait. <br>  <br>  I speak from the experience of one of our girls, who thought that being a mum was a great idea.

I'm 21, married, with a stable job and a 22month old daughter and I think I was way too young to have her at 20. <br>  Think about it you're still in education, and kids are definitely not easy<br>  to care for and don't think you can pass your baby onto your parents whenever times get hard.<br>  So here are a few reasons NOT to have kids yet.<br>  1) Way too young<br>  2) Not financially stable<br>  3) You have a life to live for beforehand. e.g socialising, travelling etc<br>  4) Its alot of pressure on a relationship <br>  5) You are 17!<br>  Sorry lovey but you'll regret it if you have kids now, concentrate on your education, make that your baby and you'll go far|`|oljuyhG8aa	Does your boyfriend feel the same? If you both really want a baby and feel you can offer it what it needs do it by all means. Although consider that you are still only 17. Think about what you might miss out on if you were to have a baby now. Try and weigh up the pros and cons.|`|76hhm6Quaa	if you love yourself and love your boyfriend than you would make the mature decision to wait. Life isn't that short, at 17 you still have plenty of time ahead of you. If you think long and hard about it, what do you and your boyfriend do for fun? because when you have a baby you may not get to do all the things you enjoy doing, you have to be mature and finacially set, they say the average cost nowadays to raise a BABY is 7,000-10,000 dollars....and that is for the stuff that you NEED for the baby. My cousin and his girlfriend at 17 decided they wanted to become parents when she had her daughter at 18 they found out that the baby had a blood disease, my little cousin passed away right before her 2nd birthday, are you ready to handle something like that at such a young age? Because that wasnt even something they considered while having sex trying to conceive. Are you engaged? Planning on getting married? If you have no major plans to become married anytime soon, you should rethink it because you may seem so much in love right now but what about 2 years down the road? Alot could happen! I ready to barely be able to go out and enjoy yourself, hanging out with friends wont be so easy, if you think having a child and pawning it off on other people whenever you want to go out is how it works, you are wrong. A child is alot of responsibility. I think you love the thought of a child and how great it would be, but I do not believe you are putting the negatives of having a baby at 17 into consideration, which means you are not mature enough to have a child yet.|`|d5479b73829d5fa0818d9eec2850a058aa	How do you know it's hard raising a child, have you done it?<br>  <br>  What security can you offer this child that you want.  Do you have savings in the bank for his college, driving lessons, holidays, shoes, clothing, etc.  <br>  <br>  Do you have a home suitable to bring a baby up in.  Do you have a secure and well paid job/ do you even have a career yet?<br>  <br>  Do you have a secure and stable relationship?  Will your partner stick around after months of sleepless nights?  Are you sure he wont want to go out with the lads?<br>  <br>  I'm not getting on at you because you're young and unprepared.  I'm trying to get you to realise that once you have a child all the above things become very very important, and if you don't have those things it hurts.  It hurts when you can't afford to buy your baby new clothes.  It hurts when you can't take your child to the seaside or on holiday.  It keeps you awake at night when you know you have no future and you cant provide properly for your child.  <br>  <br>  Maybe you feel you want a baby because right now you feel insecure and need more love.  You can always help out at a local nursery, or babysit for a friend.  <br>  <br>  Think about this responsibly, a good Mum is responsible,  what kind of future could you offer your baby right now?  I'm sure you'll agree it's better to work hard for a few years getting ahead in your career and building a future.  When you're all set up in a secure home with an income and a stable relationship you'll be able to really enjoy the baby that you've worked so hard to have.<br>  <br>  Take care and be brave.|`|ITCknAHVaa	I can understand in part how you feel.  What you need to think of is the baby.  While I am sure you would be a good parent, the baby would be better off if you were in a position to care for it financially and emotionally.  I know you understand how much work is involved, I think that waiting a few year until you are 22 or so when you have a job and have had a education.  You also want to set a good example for the child.<br>  <br>  Women and girls often want to have a baby to have something to love.  Understandable, but it is not thinking of the child.  You are still young, and you sound intelligent, I think you should wait at least until you have finished school and have a job.  Waiting until 18 or 19 is only a year or two.  It would be far better for you and the child.<br>  <br>  I would talk it over with someone, many states have teenage sexual health centers or similar.  Do not forget having children has its risks, children can be born with disabilities or problems, and that is hard to deal with especially if your very young.<br>  <br>  Please do not rush it.  I understand how you feel.  I have a friend who had two kids very close at 17 and one is severely autistic.  She is now 25 and the kids are 7 and 6.<br>  <br>  It is a hard road.  There is no harm in waiting, please take your time and get as much information as possible,.|`|mkph8r0taa	You may think you are ready, but no parent is ever truly prepared for what's to come. It's good you and your boyfriend have a job and you are an A student, but if you really knew how hard it was to raise a child, I think you'd reconsider. <br>  <br>  If you are still living with mom and dad, I am sure they would appreciate you speaking with them about this because I highly doubt they want to be stuck helping you raise a baby under their roof and ultimately getting stuck paying for your babies expenses and babies are EXPENSIVE. I got married and pregnant young. We are financially stable and do not get help from parents or the government. It's not like playing house, being mommy and daddy to your little bundle of joy and all that fantasy stuff. It's 24/7, you don't get a break, you don't get to hand your screaming baby off to someone else to take care of for you when you are at your wits end. I'm slowly trying to get my college degree and I am several semesters behind from where I should be because money for school has had to be used for unexpected baby expenses. My husband and I have had to make many sacrifices for our child and responsibility is a lot more work than just talking about it. Both of us wish we would have waited just a few years so we could have finished college and pursued our career goals, but we decided to get pregnant so now our child is first priority. Being a parent is the greatest experience in life, but be fair to your child and don't bring them into the world without making sure you have the ability to provide them with everything they need.|`|YgugU6SSaa	At 17, you are a baby yourself, in my opinion.<br>  In any case, if you and your boyfriend have talked this through and are serious about it, I doubt that your parents won't understand.

Man bezeichnet diese Drüsen h?ufig auch als weibliche Prostata. Eine konkrete Geruchsspezifikation l?sst sich nicht feststellen. Der Geruch h?ngt also von der Frau, ihrer Lebensführung und der Anzahl von Ejakulationen ab. Das Ejakulat wird beim H?hepunkt durch zwei winzige Ausg?nge direkt neben der Harnr?hren?ffnung ausgesondert.

I have had 2 miscarriages that happened to me, the first one I started bleeding right after I took the test that came back positive and the second one, I went to the ER b/c I was bleeding heavily and they told me I was 2 weeks pregnant.

They all said negative, but I didn't fully trust them so I took a blood test. Once I got the blood test results back and it said negative I stopped stressing and got my period 2 days later. It definately has to do with stress. If it makes you feel better get a pregnancy test, but some women do not have that hormone to detect a pregnancy when doing the test. Best thing is to go to a clinic (Planned Parenthood) and get a $20 blood test. You call the next day and they will have the results.

82d10b303e74dbe6accab663bbcd07b2aa	It doesn't sound as though you are pregnant. We can often look for symptoms of pregnancy by worrying about it so much that we manifest the symptoms physically. Missing the last 2 pills before your period is not a big deal... you ovulated about 2 weeks before this. You did have a period even though it was a slight one, it was still a period. <br>  <br>  If you are concerned, see a doctor or go to your local pregnancy crisis center or health department for another, possibly more accurate test. <br>  <br>  You are right to think that it is too early to test at home for pregnancy as most tests cannot pick up horomones any earlier than a  few days before a missed period. <br>  <br>  Good luck ! !:)|`|11e02d8275e7dd52854d0a71d6b21aa7aa	If you're due for your period, you'd be 4 weeks pregnant (based on your last menstrual period.)  Try testing again and see what the test says.  The pill is only as accurate as the person taking it, and missing 2 pills in one cycle is a way to get pregnant, I'm sorry to say.  Go get tested and put your mind at ease.|`|afc668c10a0650c5689ef30d19d03c57aa	i would wait and see if this period is late.........wait at least until then before you take another test.....the HCG level might have been to low to be detected or its just the pills........good luck

ffyTa5t1aa	well, go to your doctor. they can run some tests, like for hormone levels. or they may need to send you to a fertility specialist. how long have you been trying?? it can take a while! i think the average is about 6 months of trying and that is if there AREN'T other underlying causes that are preventing you from concieving. just relax and good luck!|`|11e02d8275e7dd52854d0a71d6b21aa7aa	Try charting, you can find out a host of reasons just by doing that (for example, late ovulation, not ovulating at all, short luteal phase, etc.)  Check out the book "Taking Charge of Your Fertility" and get a basal thermometer (you can get digital ones at Walmart or Target for $10-$12.)  You can use fertilityfriend.com to chart, it's free.  You can use the information that you find through charting to help you figure out why you're not getting pregnant.
11e02d8275e7dd52854d0a71d6b21aa7aa	I think I would worry more if you weren't nervous, a c-section is major surgery!

KDW7gvckaa	I remember my younger sister and I ued to do this to our mum all the time. Drove her mad, in the end she'd lock herself in the bathroom and talk on the phone in there so we'd leave her be. I think it's because the children realise "hand on a moment, mum's doing something she wants to do, thats not fair" and they get jelous and want attention. I've seen on shows like "super nanny" and so on that if you tell the child before hand "i am going to be talking on the phone, do you need a drink or something to eat?" if yes, get what they require, if no then dont. then say to them "ok now when im on the phone, i will not get you anything and you will have to wait until I am off the phone for a drink or something to eat". If they approach you whilst you are on the phone/busy do not acknowledge that he/she is there, as you have set the ground rules and giving into them just re-inforces to the child/ren that they will get their way, even when you are pre-occupied. <br>  <br>  My 4 month old son waits for me to do something before he decides to yell out and whinge. I can sit on the couch and he be in his room sleeping, soon as I get up to go take out the rubbish, do some cleaning and so forth, he starts whinging. walk in to him, say to him "I am busy, you are going to have to wait" give him his dummy and walk back out. I go about what I  was doing before I went into him and once I am done I go in and acknowledge him.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps :)|`|8e2f14f2a3457e0928c5028b129a3668aa	Sounds like plain ol' jealousy.  If you are going to be on the phone... if you KNOW you are going to be on the phone, why not cut out a little special time for them first?  Do something for them so they know they are important and the apple of their mother's eye and I suspect will be less likely to pester you while you are on the phone.  Also, why not go ahead and prepare snacks and drinks before heading for the phone or shortly after a call starts.. head 'em off at the pass, so to speak.  It's attention they want.  Honor that need, but in a way that is more convenient for you.  NOT while you are on the phone.  Maybe you could take one of their favorite videos, wean them off of it, and only let them watch it when you're on the phone from now on.  If they feel like they're getting a little something out of you being distracted by the phone, I think they'll be more likely to leave you in peace for the length of the phone call.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	It's your job as a parent to teach them proper manners, so they leave you alone if you are on the phone once in a while for a short amount of time.

GVcudkVoaa	Yeah I took 12 tests at home and all were + so I went to the dr. and they tested my pee and their's was - so they did a      lab test and that was +. I'm almost 5 weeks preg now. If you got a + at home you are pregnant. Congrats!!!|`|0896af895d285a60a4bf25bd5ee2a040aa	Get a blood test done.  And you are more than likely pregnant if the first 2 tests came back positive. |`|ZUIVl95Uaa	No need to post the question twice. |`|ZbnxGIsnaa	I'd go and see a doctor and get a blood test. . . DEFINITELY.   Tell the doctors how hard it was to confirm your pregnancy the last round.  <br>  <br>  Sometimes detecting the pregnancy hormone can be such a bugger, eh?  Teehee.  Goodluck.  I'm sure you are pregnant.  Congratulations!|`|MtC3CWZraa	The clinic did urine or blood?  I can’t tell you how many times I’ve heard of a doc’s office urine test being wrong – even after home tests gave a positive. I’m starting to wonder what’s wrong with the tests docs use if they aren’t as accurate as what I can buy at Target. <br>  <br>  You may have to go back and get tested again in a week or two. Always question their results when you think they're wrong. I had this happen to me too, only to have a second nurse realize the first had misread my test results. |`|sylUy3draa	Yeah, get a blood test, and/or ultrasound. At the hospital here, all urine tests will clearly state negative or positive. Most doctor's use this test based on the information you give them. The doctor I work for always do a urine test first. Sometimes they come out positive and you don't be pregnant, it sould be something else. If he or the patient is unsure of a negative test, than he sends them for a blood test, and/or a sonagram.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Well when I tested at home I got a faint positive as well and I went to the clinic and the nurse told me I wasn't pregnant but showed me the test and it was positive. When I confronted her she said they only say it's positive if it a clear positive. Maybe you should request a blood test. That is what I had to do and I was pregnant.|`|u7kDLuklaa	Your clinic probably uses the same technology as you did at home which at different parts of the day in early pregnancy can produce a different result.<br>  <br>  If i were you i would make a second appointment and ask for a blood test.  A positive test does not just happen by accident.  <br>  <br>  Good luck .. my moneys on your Positive.  :)|`|BlL6oMEfaa	Request a blood test.  
K35x4Nlpaa	called morning sickness although morning sickness is always in the morning it can happen any time of the day|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	You can be sick and not be pregnant. Are you having any other symptoms? Have you missed a period?|`|O1qm8XBiaa	That doesn't necessarily mean your pregnant :S|`|AL8g2PJiaa	You belched. It happens to people, pregnant or not all the time. 
1557866d22112c5c71c048ca6dd77616aa	I highly doubt that your eating habits would affect your pregnancy at this point.  As long as you change and start eating right now that you know that is what is important! <br>  <br>  Congrats!  That is soo exciting :)|`|x7vTKP24aa	you will be ok. baby will be ok. just watch what you do or eat from now on. |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I think you'll be okay as long as you avoid it from now on.|`|829649629f527cf960a68e173b795eb4aa	Hi, the foods you mentioned aren't a huge problem really. I'd also steer clear of uncooked eggs and unpasteurised foods.<br>  Would be nice (even if you could have started sooner) to include daily folic acid from now on. Relax and enjoy your pregnancy|`|fvmKx667aa	Just avoid them now. Before I found out I had a good couple of weeks where I was out at the bars with my friends having a grand ol time, drinking and smoking. I even went on a few roller coasters lol. She is fine.I stopped as soon as I found out. |`|Wkf0YTKtaa	You are fine.  Those foods arent bad for you.  Shrimp, flounder and crabmeat need to be cooked well though.  You can eat anything in small amounts.|`|6mvv7r08aa	Yeah you should be fine just limit yourself. Just a tip do NOT eat deli meat has lots of bacteria and can harm the baby. I am also expecting and I found this website very helpful. You should check it out. |`|80408fa7cbfec89f00416bbc3caac14aaa	I doubt that u have anything to worry about. Take it easy and do the right thing from now on. Some people have alcoholic drinks before they find out they are pregnant and their babies turn out fine.|`|AA12254963	your fine! just lay off of all that from now on!|`|pOuG6cltaa	you should be fine just watch out nin future what your eating
vue9NOhYaa	2 months isn't long at all.  The fact that it 'worked' the first month last time just means the the dice roll came up in your favor on the first try.  <br>  <br>  Statistically, among women actively 'trying' about 25-30% will get pregnant every month.  <br>  <br>  Or ... larger picture -- about 50% will be pregnant within 4 months, 60-70% within 6 months, and 80% within a year.  (After a year you are considered to have fertility issues, and evaluation/testing would be recommended ... though another 5-10% WILL get pregnant during the second year without need for treatment. <br>  <br>  If your period is due on the 29th, you tested much too early.  Wait until the 30th. If you don't get a period, test. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|sXBQLJTiaa	dont give up hope yet! my boyfriend and I have been trying for a year and this month we may finally be pregnant (still not sure). so, it can take a year or more to concieve sometimes depending on certain factors. anything over a year and you can go and talk to your doctor about some tests if you want but anything under a year is really nothing to worry about.|`|Fm3L8vsYaa	2 months is not that long. it takes some people 12 + months. i just googled when am i ovulating and did what the calander that they gave me said and it worked like a charm. maybe try that if the ovulation stick isnt working, |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Everyone is different but my doctor told me that it takes about 6 months but if you try for more than a year that is when you should start to worry.|`|DskwNSPPaa	that's right what the other lady is saying it can take 12 to 24 months to fall pregnant, i think your just being too hasty and you need to chill out and it will happen soon |`|7VDzH4fBaa	Just keep trying. It's still fun.|`|a3dad3ac9df4359c9fc632a014f40160aa	I know it is hard to be patient and wait, but the more you stress about it the harder it is to get pregnant. (I read up on that when ttc my first) It can take months to get pregnant. You aren't supposed to worry about it until you have been trying for a year. Relax and enjoy the process!!|`|XvJGnAbfaa	it takes as long as it takes hunni , try not to get too uptight and anxious because for some bizarre reason it tends to take longer , you and your husband are young  so just enjoy having a great sex life and the baby will come when its ready  . good luck  |`|fQFW9RYlaa	Don't get discouraged it will happen....my boyfriend and I started trying in feb and I didn't get pregnant till July. I know you may be frusterated but just keep trying and eventually it will happen.Good Luck!!!!! 
BCkKdJlfaa	You can usually hear a heart beat between 6 & 8 weeks just depending on where the baby is. I heard the heartbeat at 8 weeks. There is a good chance that you might be able to hear the heartbeat but if you dont... please dont get discouraged baby's can be stubborn at times. Good Luck! |`|bsMJsIBOaa	Hi, i heard the heartbeat using the internal scan at 6wks 5days. You should get the normal scan at this stage, i had to get the internal as i didn't know they would use the other scan and i emptied my bladder before hand, lol.  Good luck and if you don't hear it at this stage don't stress as it is still early|`|2d9DFPiNaa	I never heard of them checking for the sound of the heartbeat internaly, usually they just let you see the babys heartbeat on the screen.I did have a internal ultrasound that early with all 3 pregnancys and they just showed me the heartbeat. When they listen to it they do it on the out side of you abdomin.|`|f8a7de27a28dda7f5e4a4b9f15048635aa	hiya, i heard my twins heartbeat at 6w 5 days and that was with an ultra sound not a vaginal probe.<br>  <br>  So yes 100% it is possible to hear a heart beat and its the single most amazing experience in the world!!<br>  <br>  good luck x|`|9MocUsAdaa	When I had a 6 week ultrasound they heard the heartbeat. <br>  <br>  |`|zQWNb6neaa	With my second pregnancy we saw the heartbeat via vaginal ultrasound at 6 weeks 5 days. It had not been there the week before, at 5 weeks 6 days. With this pregnancy I just opted to wait until 7 weeks before having it done. Your chances of seeing it are good, but don't be overly concerned if it isn't found yet. Good luck!|`|0iUxfCMcaa	sometimes you can and sometimes you cant|`|a485e8f533a15dc3cc9e66f068f78342aa	On a transvaginal ultrasound, yes you can hear it at 6wks. But not with a dopplar.|`|iyRWN59Xaa	My doctor never checked that early.<br>  <br>  Uhm, why do I get a thumbs down when my doctor never checked...this isn't an opinion, it's a fact.|`|oXzHvsBpaa	I had an ultrasound done at that time and they werent able to pick up a heart beat. I didn't hear my sons heart beat till he was about 12 weeks or so.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I think I had one at 7 weeks and we could hear it perfectly. I hope you do. It was amazing! Congrats
JUXAK0euaa	I don't know if you have a problem with this but you might want to look into alternatives for where your husband puts his penis.|`|i4zKc2bhaa	Could you have a yeast infection that can make you feel swollen and itchy/stingy down there, I get them every time im pregnant. Its safe to take over the counter yeast infection meds. I use the generic, it works the same and is cheapest.<br>  <br>  Sex at 32 is never easy, its like doing it with a basket ball in between you!|`|ZbFGE5YWaa	If its swollen then you might have an infection such as thrush- we are both at the same stage in pregnancy and i had this issue a couple of weeks ago. Either that or you just need to use lots of lube- but if its making sex uncomfortable too then maybe wait until you've seen the doc who can tell you whats really wrong- i'm sure hubby won't mind waiting a bit!!!! |`|Js09FbDnaa	I would check with the doctor. If it's just uncomfortable having sex, but otherwise you feel OK, waiting 3 days is fine.<br>  <br>  If you're in a lot of pain, have a fever, unusual discharge, any other signs that something is really wrong, don't hesitate to call your OB for an emergency appointmet tomorrow. |`|Zbsm2IyWaa	Mine got more and more and more swollen with each pregnancy.  It's normal  b/c of increased blood flow, hormones, etc.  The only thing that helped us was LOTS of lube, even if your not dry.
3cxwalh0aa	I'm pretty sure 100-200 is within a "normal" range. I wouldn't worry about it, especially if your doctor didn't voice any concern.|`|Iqifd3SGaa	It can be high early in pregnancy but it usually slows down. When I went in at 8 weeks it was 179 bpm then my next ultrasound was 170 then the last one I had my sons heart rate was 144bpm. |`|PiejaARKaa	Thats normal, don't worry. Could be a girl too!|`|r9XzUCFBaa	The baby's heart rate depends on a couple of things.<br>  First of all, it depends on the gestational age of the baby. The younger the baby (and therefore the smaller the baby), the faster the baby's heart rate. 180 BPM is normal up until 12 weeks.<br>  It also depends on the movement of the baby. If a baby moves, the heart rate can be very rapid. So if you carry a term baby, who is moving (or has just moved), 180 BPM isn't something to worry about.<br>  <br>  During birth, the heart rate can also be very fast, but that's a sign things aren't ok. It can happen when you have a fever. Or when the baby is compensating decelerations.<br>  <br>  Wondering how far along you are.<br>  Iris|`|FzezVLmNaa	Mine was 175 at 9weeks and is now anywhere from 150s-160s.<br>  <br>  Everyone was sure I was having a girl but its a boy!<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I think the doctor probably would have told if you had anything to worry about. |`|2KJnVBTfaa	if your doctor wasn't concerned then don't worry. your obgyn is ur doc but also takes care of the baby
ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It's totally possible that you are pregnant but its also possible that your bc has messed up your cylce. Your best bet is just to see the doctor and request a blood test. It may just be too early to detect the pregnancy if you are. But a blood test will tell you for sure. Good luck.
0do2ixtWaa	Hello I had the same thing.. I just used Dristan the nasal spray and it worked.. and the dr ok'd that for me, Try and get just regular saline spray if you are to worried about using other ones. they work too!<br>  Good Luck and Congrats!!|`|ZlNFOgO7aa	Preferably I would go and see a Doctor about it, or ask the pharmacist at the chemist, some may be fine, but because your nose have mucus membranes inside, the spray will get into your system and through to the baby. I had conjunctivitis once and I had to get special drops because of that reason.|`|f3n2zXG2aa	Call the labor and delivery department at the hospital where you will be delivering.  They may have a Dr there for that answer now, or the nurse can let you know what to do.<br>  Need to keep the O2 going to that baby and you.|`|4sFbS8Hmaa	i was diagnosed well over a week ago with this viral bronchitis and the doctors told me that a way to help with the symptoms was to use a saline nasal spray because they work and its the safest thing to use since i am 31 weeks pregnant..Good luck and hope you feel better... ( it really did work for me)|`|9cu82009aa	Ask the pharmacist, they'll be able to tell you. I had the same problem with my last pregnancy, was driving me crazy, I couldn't sleep... hubby went in and asked him if there was anything I could take (as I knew I couldn't use nasal sprays) and he handed him a certain nasal spray, I can't remember the name of it. Like I said, just ask they'll give you something that will be safe.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I heard sudafed. I know that's safe to take. |`|jDmAyPTyaa	<br>  Nasal congestion is normal in pregnancy and is due to high levels of Progesterone! (the hormone that keeps you pregnant)<br>  <br>  You need to ask your midwife or doctor what is safe to use.|`|LIT4oYn7aa	I have this problem (im 37 weeks and have had it since the beginning) anyway... try Flonase... that's what I use.. and my Dr. okay-ed it! good Luck ha ha<br>  <br>  =)
hrRh0CqNaa	I like Ian the best! The others are nice but, Ian stands out to me and the others are a lot more popular! If you have triplets, all three of the names would be excellent together! I could see three little boys named:<br>  <br>  Ian Michael, Ethan James and Evan Chandler. . .<br>  <br>  Very nice!|`|oTvXEKAHaa	Absolutely Ethan.!!!!!   It is a strong, solid  name, and you think of greatness. You can start a child's life right with a name like Ethan.  Hope this helps.|`|fh3HBtmMaa	Personally, I love the name Ian, I don't hear that name a lot and Ethan and Evan are more common names!|`|2Z8kYgzzaa	Definately Evan|`|VcIYb9uEaa	Ethan definitely|`|18cce3fc3659c2acdbfb95d14d04af1faa	ETHAN...|`|Rzwrz6vdaa	Evan|`|xVQeR0nvaa	Evan!!<br>  <3|`|lg3MQJsnaa	I like Evan, but he won't be able to pronounce "v"s until he's about 8, so he will say "Eban"|`|2xAfgcNwaa	i luvv ethan and also ian that would be soooo cutee ;) <3|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I like Ian and Ethan the best.

They are all cute though.|`|XtbjzpK7aa	evan. it's the best.
BMNlVLZHaa	I would suggest getting help through your local Child Protective Services if it's child abuse.  If it's conflict then you need to deal with it maturelyy.<br>  The streets are hard.  If you don't end up selling your body for money, someone will end up taking advantage of you or you'll give sex in exchange for a roof over your head or some food.  Usually drugs follow to numb you of how crappy you feel about yourself after you start feeling used.  <br>  What about living with another family member or family friend?|`|5RoYyprkaa	I ran away when I was 14 too, and I went to go live with my 17 year old boyfriend at the time. After about a week, I wanted to go back home. Since you haven't disclosed the details, if it's something abusive, then try contacting DHR or some other sort of shelter. If it's not, then hang on for at least three years, things may change, and if not, you can emancipate yourself, but be prepared to have to pay fro everything yourself.|`|TK0HKu0Iaa	*Sigh why is this EVEN in the TTC Section?<br>  <br>  To all mothers and fathers who answer this question it is 10pm DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOUR CHILDREN ARE?!  <br>  <br>  If you feel you "MUST" go please call a relative to pick you up.|`|xypA3yZMaa	I hope your not pregnant... but if you are please seek help. Go to an aunts house, friends mom's house, shelter, police station, fire department, unless its something real serious please do yourself a favor and don't run away... U will regret it! its stupid and childish. |`|riLZyNWbaa	i'v always thought about running away.  and i'v found that the best place to is to go live in the forest.  live there like your ancesters they could do it before they were 14.  you might want to wait until spring tho winter would suck|`|cdiyUyH7aa	even though your not gonna wanna hear this. Dont run away you'll regret it after the first couple of days. no joke|`|mTyu7CKoaa	here is a great place to run away too...... u ready? try ur room! plus y is this in the pregnancy column?|`|c9jdmxEnaa	well at 14 you must have a severe reason to want to leave your home. I would assume its actual abuse or worse.  I would call social services and see who can help you or your local police department.  If its not that serious, then re-think it.|`|c8O1vDsCaa	look online, since it seems you have access. Runawayteen.org You need to get somewhere safe. Is there a relative you can call to send you a bus or plane ticket so you can get out of your situation? Good luck to you, BE SAFE!!|`|gzB8H4ibaa	well the fact is unless ur gonna be a child hooker or homless its not such a good idea. unless ur being sexually assualted or some crazy sh*t i would suggest getting into a group home. all options suck but at your age u dont have many|`|M0BBMP95aa	Grab some money. Walk to a bus stop. Go to a mates place.

eXcXhSmIaa	i thought i was one of the lucky ones, until i hit 7wks then good god, morning noon and night sickness hit me! 11-4 was my good period i couldnt eat after 6pm. luckily it stopped when i hit 14wks<br>  you maybe lucky and have no sickness but i would hold fire for now!lol!|`|CrTZzMwDaa	No, your just lucky. Some people just don't get morning sickness. I had it really bad so feel lucky that you don't have it and enjoy it while it last. Hope that you don't have it. If you are concerned you can always call your dr.|`|qcHmUfWHaa	Hun, calm down. Everything is ok. I am only 4 weeks and 2 days and I also get freaked out. Just stay calm and try not to stress!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Not everyone gets symptoms. I didn't get very sick at 6 weeks. But now I'm 14.5 weeks and I've been sicker than I got throughout my entire pregnancy so far. It sucks. You may be lucky or they just haven't hit you yet. Good luck and Congrats
H0fXySX9aa	if you have done it once you can do it again.<br>  while it will be hard don't give up<br>  <br>  you cant give an already fertilized egg it is an embryo now|`|AA11131747	Well you can donate your egg for it to be fertilized in a petri dish and then implanted into another woman. But I don't think you can do an embryo transplant once you're already carrying the child.<br>  <br>  I applaud you for choosing not to abort, but adoption is a wonderful alternative.|`|NqQyFElCaa	If you're already pregnant, the egg has implanted in your uterus, so there's no way to remove it without the embryo/fetus dying. Your best bet if you can't take care of the baby and don't want an abortion is to put it up for adoption later.|`|mfYfeFCgaa	No. You can donate unfertilized eggs and you can donate an embryo that's been fertilized OUTSIDE the body, the way in-vitro fertilization done, but you're already pregnant, which means your egg has been fertilized within your body and has implanted in your uterine lining, so there is no way to remove it from you without destroying it. It would be very nice if that was possible as it would give women seeking abortions another possible option to consider so that the baby could still be born and live, but unfortunately, medical science hasn't made it that far yet. Hope everything works out for the best for you.|`|dXHIoLMcaa	You can donate your eggs but not if they are already fertilized so the answer is no. It will be ok though, my friends little sister had her first baby at 16 and then had her second baby exactly a year later and was only 17 and she did just fine. Its more work but sometimes you have to do what you have to do, it may be stressful now but dont worry! Good Luck!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	You can always give the child up for adoption once the baby is born. I'm so happy to hear that you don't want to have an abortion. But there are so many people out there that want to adopt a baby. |`|AA10715129	your only choice is adoption. if your pregnant that mean the fertilized egg has implanted on your uterus and the only way for it to come off is to for it to die. If you and your boyfriend are white, you will have plenty of people who want to adopt your baby. but you will have to carry the pregnancy yourself.|`|PRaS1leGaa	I have heard of it. Its just like a surrogate mother. Or you can just have the baby and give it up for adoption?? But im sure you could get your fertilized egg and implant it to another woman's uterus. |`|5iW2Wljfaa	i would love to take your eggs(i don't have any)i would to be a mom and my husband would love to be a dad i know all of you are going to say adopt,well we are trying to we have a class on 10-8-08.but we are thinking about foster mom and dad(so every child has a chance to be in a family at least for a little while) but we still want one of our own sort of speaking so i would take them in a min.please you can get me on email we would do anything for us to have a baby.and we have chosen foster instead of adoption because there are some many child's that don't know what is it like to have a family but we are talking about both BUT I WILL TAKE YOUR EGGS|`|rym9BXTyaa	I don't think you can donate an egg, which has already implanted itself in your womb but I may well be wrong. I think it's great that you are against aborting your baby!! Going down the adoption road is a very unselfish and lovely thing to do, however it would take a lot of planning and means going through another pregnancy and at the end of it you may want to keep the baby. I mean think back to the birth of your current baby, could you have  imagined giving it up for adoption? Is there no chance of going through with this pregnancy and keeping the baby as a little brother and sister for your little one? After all sometimes in life it's our unplanned "mistakes" that make us who we are and shape our lives for the better. At least you will have all the baby stuff already and lots of people have their babies this far apart! This may not be the best example I know! but Britney Spears had her two like that, it's quite a common age gap. Your little boy may very well be walking by the time of the birth and will not be wanting bottles so that frees up the carrying around and sterilizing for the second baby - unless breastfeeding of course. I mean what would have happened if your first pregnancy had been with twins? You would have had two then. I hope you make the best decision for yourself and your little family. 
LQKW39SEaa	ignore them stupid asses...<br>  <br>  you do look more prego in the 11 week one..<br>  but i think you should post them on myspace, sortof like ever couple of weeks or so post a new picture...to show how much your growing..<br>  you don't have to wait until you actually LOOK-LOOK pregant...just post one ever few weeks and stuff...|`|1K0n0Sk8aa	you are definatly starting to fill out but until about 20 weeks or so you will not have a rounded bump you still just have the podgy look at the mo, but you look fine for how far gone you are |`|EZQIOIxxaa	take ones from the side...when you look back on them you can see your progress a little better...plus that's the classic "I'm pregnant" picture.|`|jiF56lRaaa	at 5 weeks you can not tell but at 11 weeks i would post it up on myspace.|`|Wkf0YTKtaa	The second one does.  Try taking a side view, that will probably be better.  Post the second one on myspace, then a side view.  People will be able to tell.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I think you do. Plus, a lot of woman post pics even when they're not showing just to show how fast they grow and the different stages. |`|lx9fkX06aa	week 5 no but week 11 sort of you don't start to really develop a stomach until 4 months-6 months good luck|`|yl0CZsy2aa	The second picture does|`|OuGTC2yMaa	I would say you look pregnant!  I didn't even look like that until between 15 and 17 weeks.  I posted a picture on my myspace at like 12 weeks and starting at 17 weeks I started posting once a week pictures.  So I would post away if I were you!  Maybe you could put the 5 week pic as a starting point or a 'before' or something...  Good luck and Congrats :)|`|HAYdLgxHaa	your are totally pregnant.if u become fat ur whole body change not just ur belly.So u are pregnant.congrat...|`|5f695d303f71f12c9aae1be5319e860caa	Yes.|`|HKCRxreRaa	week 11 u doo,but 5 weeks u dont.|`|hameOvsyaa	On the 2nd pic u do look prego.  Congrats!|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	You definitely look pregnant.  :)<br>  <br>  It's so cool to have a big belly, but BELIEVE me.  Once you get to your last trimester it will no longer be cool.  Teehee.<br>  <br>  Congrats! xxx|`|cnMXJMFUaa	Side views would've been better to tell...<br>  <br>  But your 11 weeks looks like your "showing" a tad.<br>  <br>  Congrats!|`|tj0X2YaYaa	I posted my first pic when I didn't look pregnant and I've been posting pics every two weeks so people can see how I'm growing.  I'm 17 1/2 weeks along and I still don't look that pregnant, but people have fun seeing that I'm looking more pregnant than I did at 8 weeks.  Don't worry about having a full on pregnancy belly, just post them so that people can see how your belly is growing.  But yes, you do look more pregnant in the eleven week one than the five week one.  Good luck!|`|OxFV92hJaa	Yea, you can see a noticable difference. Those will make nice starting photos.|`|UtOVEzG3aa	yes you do! good luck-|`|jQDeTTVhaa	yes 
bD6K5uOlaa	I had the same thing happen last month 10dpo and I got a BFP on my pregnancy test this month! Good luck! |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Implantation bleeding is described as being light or dark brown so it is very possible that that's what you're experiencing. Good luck. And if you are pregnant, CONGRATS!|`|85d880b4c510002b409163300b68601eaa	I had no spotting or implantation bleeding or anything with my first baby. I did with my second pregnancy about 5 days before my period was due.|`|VMASMHX6aa	Is everything ok? You said a few days ago that you were pregnant. If you've already had a positive test and now you are bleeding you should get that checked out by a doctor.
POXNewWzaa	you definitly dont have to take it out and for most women it doesn't bother them till the 4-6th month. After that thay sell flexible belly rings made out of plastic/rubber, that bend with your body. Sometimes they are called pregnancy belly button rings. <br>  <br>  ebay is a great place to look. here is a link to an auction with the pregnancy belly rings|`|gTun7ZoHaa	im not sure why you have to take them out but when i wasnt well with my 1st i went to see the doctor and was told to take it out.<br>  Im now pregnant with #2 and took it out as soon as i found out i was expecting again.<br>  Ive know people to keep theirs in the whole way through pregnancy|`|NqQyFElCaa	I don't know if you HAVE to take them out, but I can't see how that'd be comfortable or look good at all once your belly got bigger. My belly button has gone from innie to basically lying flat on the front of my big belly, so if I had a ring in there, it would either distort the whole thing, or might've even ripped out by now - so I definitely would've taken it out!|`|3p3pBBwvaa	I think there can be damage if you aren't wearing the best ring possible, but the best option is to check with your doctor.<br>  Also, look at the following sites, they have maternity piercings.<br>  They stretch as your belly does:<br>  <a href="http://www.bodycandy.com/cgi-bin/category/pregnancyring\" rel="nofollow">http://www.bodycandy.com/cgi-bin/categor...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.sexynavelrings.com/pregnancy-belly-button-rings/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sexynavelrings.com/pregnancy-...</a><br>  The first one looked better to me personally|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I think as long as you're comfortable you can keep them in. I think they actually make bigger ones that you can wear while pregnant so that the hole doesn't close. 
NqQyFElCaa	Cramps right around when I should've got my period.|`|AA10788612	right after having unprotected sex when you shouldn't have|`|loFmrsi6aa	 Understanding the signs and symptoms of pregnancy is important because each symptom may be related to something other than pregnancy. Some women experience signs or symptoms of pregnancy within a week of conception. For other women, pregnancy symptoms may develop over a few weeks or may not be present at all. Below is a listing of some of the most common pregnancy signs symptoms. If you have been sexually active and experiencing any of the following symptoms it is important to take a pregnancy test.<br>  Delay/Difference in Menstruation:<br>  A delayed or missed menstruation is the most common pregnancy symptom leading a woman to test for pregnancy. When you become pregnant, your next period should be missed. Many women can bleed while they are pregnant, but typically the bleeding will be shorter or lighter than a normal period.<br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Excessive weight gain/loss, fatigue, hormonal problems, tension, stress, ceasing to take the birth control pill, or breast-feeding.<br>  <br>  Swollen/Tender Breasts:<br>  Swollen or tender breasts is a pregnancy symptom which may begin as early as 1-2 weeks after conception. Women may notice changes in their breasts; they may be tender to the touch, sore, or swollen. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Hormonal imbalance, birth control pills, impending menstruation (PMS) can also cause your breasts to be swollen or tender.<br>  <br>  Fatigue/Tiredness:<br>  Feeling fatigued or more tired is a pregnancy symptom which can also start as early as the first week after conception. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Stress, exhaustion, depression, common cold or flu, or other illnesses can also leave you feeling tired or fatigued.<br>  <br>  Nausea/Morning Sickness:<br>  This well-known pregnancy symptom will often show up between 2-8 weeks after conception. Some women are fortunate to not deal with morning sickness at all, while others will feel nauseous throughout most of their pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Food poisoning, stress, or other stomach disorders can also cause you to feel queasy.<br>  <br>  Backaches:<br>  Lower backaches may be a symptom that occurs early in pregnancy; however, it is common to experience a dull backache throughout an entire pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Impending menstruation, stress, other back problems, and physical or mental strains.<br>  <br>  Headaches:<br>  The sudden rise of hormones in your body can cause you to have headaches early in pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Dehydration, caffeine withdrawal, impending menstruation, eye strain, or other ailments can be the source of frequent or chronic headaches.<br>  <br>  Frequent Urination:<br>  Around 6-8 weeks after conception, you may find yourself making a few extra trips to the bathroom. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Urinary tract infection, diabetes, increasing liquid intake, or taking excessive diuretics.<br>  <br>  Darkening of Areolas:<br>  If you are pregnant, the skin around your nipples may get darker. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Hormonal imbalance unrelated to pregnancy or may be a leftover effect from a previous pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Food Cravings:<br>  While you may not have a strong desire to eat pickles and ice cream, many women will feel cravings for certain foods when they are pregnant. This can last throughout your entire pregnancy. <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|uui9qptCaa	Very very sore breasts. That's how I know i was pregnant, even though my HPT was negative! I had never felt my breasts that sore before so I knew that I was pregnant. I waited 2 more weeks and took another test and sure enough I was preggo!<br>  I was also very hungry, tired & a little bit more irritable than before a period.|`|Fp16Rjfeaa	For me, I was sick feeling.  Kinda like I was getting the flu.  I was very moody and tired.  Also, my stomache cramped like my period was gonna start, but it didnt and what that was is the uterus expanding.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I just started to get sore breasts and I was sick for a few days off and on. Shortly after though I started to feel tired all the time. |`|Jf7n2N1waa	My first sign was sore and very sensitive nipples. You also feel a lot of cramping as if you are going to get your period. i have 2 kids and those were the first signs i always noticed. Good luck to you
TK0HKu0Iaa	You are clotting and have had positives why are they making you wait until Wednesday? You can be miscarrying right now. I would take my 4 positives and head to the ER. But I guess they are making you wait to see if your body will pass it on its own.That's the only sense I can make of them 1. Making you wait until Weds 2. The negative that you got at the docs after you had faint positives. That's very poor judgement and terrible orders on their part I haven't ever heard of a hospital doing this.<br>  <br>  I think that you are having a miscarriage, and as you pass more clots /tissue / blood your tests will get fainter and fainter as your HCG levels decrease. I'm so sorry and about how they are treating your case : (|`|ZVUrLZpXaa	No hospital personnel would tell you to wait till Wednesday when you have these symptoms...|`|930a625eb301aae633a9b9d8e18e0752aa	Sounds like its too late dear. I'm sorry. Stranger things have happened though. It can take a few days/weeks for your hormones to settle back down and get all negative pregnancy tests. I'm sorry. |`|g9p2ynMBaa	I had a miscarraige @ 7wks and i had the same esp the stringy bit. There is nothing the docs can do, but i did have an emergency ultrasound which confirmed the pregnancy had gone. If anything changes like u get a fever or somethin go to the hosp n tell them otherwise just wait till wednesday. |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	They may have told you to wait but honestly that sounds serious to me. You need to get checked out NOW! Seriously this is your child.. You may be having a miscarriage though. That's what it sounds like to me.|`|lSYr0Nlgaa	hospitals do and can tell you to wait, unfortunately if you are going to m/c there is nothing they can do, even docs wouldnt be able to save your baby, they wait for all the bleeding etc to stop and you might lose the baby on your own, then they will check to see if you are still pregnant.  Im really sorry it sounds like you have m/c but you never know!|`|oiWIWCXWaa	sounds pretty much like what happened to me, i miscarried! But dont worry I got pregnant again straight away!! Dont stress its just nature.  Hope youll be ok hun!!<br>  <br>  <br>  xXx|`|4TMhz9Nhaa	Dont give up hope!<br>  When you first fall on pregnant..you experiene the implantation period (where the egg embeds itself in the lining of the womb) During this time you can experience period pains, blood..just like a normal period!<br>  I experienced really bad period pains in the week before i found out i was pregnant and now im 27 weeks gone!<br>  When i did pregnancy tests they also came back really really light, but saying positive so you could just about see it!<br>  I hope everything turns out well for you!<br>  |`|5507858478baac68ed69511bef8b1860aa	youve miscarried i affraid, the reason they have told you to wait till weds is hopefully youve finished by then then they can do bloods and check your HGC levels have started to go down and maybe scan you to check its all passed. im sorry your experiencing this, theres nothing you can do or the doctors can do, its just one of those things that unfortunatly happens. im sorry again x|`|Fvpra7Cuaa	They cant tell you to wait as if it were ectopic it could kill you.. just turn up at the hospital bleeding in early pregnancy unit and tell them. they'll give you a scan, i went and asked for one just for reassurance even though id had no abnormal symptoms i was ust worried as id had an ectopic before.. and i was 5 weeks and you could see it as they will do an internal [vaginal] scan|`|ZlOniA5Eaa	Well I kinda had the same thing happen to me the day i was suppose to get my period I had pinkish blood i went to the hospital thinkin i was having a miscarriage and was told it was IMPLANTATION bleeding, maybe that is what's goin on in ur case.  I have heard that dark red blood is left over blood so maybe that is the case with you too.  Believe me I know how frustrating it is to have to WAIT, but that's really all you can do...I also had cramping I swore I was gettin my period but it never came and here I am 11 weeks pr ego.....good luck to you and try not to stress :) 
6hb04Ow0aa	Camilla is so adorable! You could call her Millie, Cam, Cami, Camil, Mills...<br>  What about Camilla Rose?<br>  = Perfect Rose<br>  Or Camilla Isabel?<br>  = Perfect Beauty (Isabel nn is Bella, which is beautiful in Italian)<br>  Or Camilla Angel?<br>  Just some suggestions, you said meanings were important and they are to me, too :))|`|rHZivjUGaa	I do not like the name, reminds me of a cat...but I like Camille more than Camilla<br>  <br>  I do not think word "perfect" is something admirable.  People should not be ashamed to fail in life, it makes you stronger.  And it is funny how people brag about being "perfect"  if you notice, that is actually a weakness and would be something to mention in a job interview, "my weakness is perfection, I must learn to let things go and not constantly try to be perfect in order to allow the company as a whole to grow and thrive" .  You would exhaust yourself and this is also not an attainable goal because as you think you are always perfect, you alienate more people and become less perfect..<br>  <br>  So I would say, choose another name|`|jwubXU2Maa	I know a little girl named Camilla Rose, and she is absolutely darling!  I think that name is lovely - not too popular, but not totally out there.  Of course, I live in the US....I have a feeling that if you live in the UK the name might not be as well-received because of Camilla Parker-Bowles.  Just a thought.....nice name, though.|`|sYokzKJgaa	I think that the name Camilla is nice but people will constantly call her camel or camel light. Some names that sound like Camilla Are:<br>  <br>  Carri<br>  Cara<br>  Mila (mee la)<br>  <br>  I like<br>  <br>  Cara Mila Bowling<br>  Carri Marie Bowling<br>  <br>  Goodluck :D|`|94106f122aa0859301482207e00eda9caa	It is awfully similar to Camilla Parker Bowles, but I do love the name. <br>  <br>  Camilla Grace Bowling<br>  Camilla Lynn Bowling<br>  Camilla Faith Bowling|`|mpdSORysaa	I love it <br>  Here are some middle names:<br>  Camille:<br>  Grace<br>  Anne<br>  Elizabeth<br>  Joy<br>  Marie<br>  Madison<br>  Nicole<br>  Riley<br>  Shay<br>  ELiie<br>  Ray<br>  Mae<br>  Lynn<br>  Rose<br>  Sophia<br>  Reese<br>  Elise<br>  Amanda<br>  Lauren<br>  Michelle<br>  Olivia<br>  Vivenne<br>  Lorelei<br>  Lila<br>  Makenna|`|nyWpka5Xaa	I would go with Camille<br>  <br>  And after reading down the other answers I like Isabelle as a middle name...<br>  <br>  Camille Isabelle Bowling is very sweet.<br>  <br>  xxx|`|qmvJPRlVaa	Camilla|`|FrkF7PaRaa	Camilla is a pretty name, but I prefer Camille.

Camilla reminds me of that very unattractive wife of Charles.|`|wRnnxg5saa	All her Kami|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I love that name!!! I can't think of a middle name though|`|47nFIudwaa	Nice.|`|Oq9R67Qdaa	i like it|`|eKuvx6f8aa	The ONLY thing that immediatly comes to mind is Camilla Parker-Bowles ! I can't help it - I hear that name & her face pops in my mind~~|`|z6BtwSE8aa	The first thing I thought about was Camilla Parker Bowles, and then I see your last name is Bowling! I just think Camilla Bowling is too close. I wouldn't do it, but if that doesn't bother you then it's an ok name.|`|Co9I2OMSaa	I think that Camilla is a pretty name.  Camilla Louise and Camilla Terese are pretty, and Cam or Cammy is a good nickname.  I also like the name Camryn.|`|bMZ7lOfVaa	I love the name Camilla. Very pretty. How about:<br>  <br>  Camilla Justine<br>  Camilla Danielle<br>  Camilla Nicole<br>  Camilla Rae<br>  |`|sAbah6dTaa	i ACTUALLY REALLY LOVE THE NAME, YOU COULD CALL HER CAMI FOR A NICKNAME.<br>  <br>  AND THE MEANING IS JUST AS GREAT.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK AND CONGRATS!!|`|0T5dWejcaa	camille its so cute<br>  
930a625eb301aae633a9b9d8e18e0752aa	You could be. At 6 weeks with mine there was no mistaking that I was pregnant. I went into the Drs to get one and he came back in like 30 seconds with "Oh, your definatley quite pregnant". |`|4HhzKHl0aa	It depends on when you ovulated. When you go to the doctor they will take blood (if they didn't already) to measure the HCG levels in your blood. That will give you a good idea of how far you are along. Plus they'll measure the baby at your ultrasound. |`|HAIHByGOaa	I was only 4 weeks when I got my first positive, and it came up positive within seconds...i thought I was having a million babies or something lol, but I have only one on the way.  Everyones hormones are different!  Good Luck and Congrats!!!|`|7WcfzvPvaa	What ever the first day of your last period was, that is the first day of your pregnancy.  You start counting your weeks from that date.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	You could be. When they do the ultrasound they will be able to tell you exactly how far along you are. Good luck and CONGRATS!|`|AA10772561	I got a positive at 5 weeks 
a3FAGYgVaa	People's opinions do not matter, nobody here can tell you if you are pregnant or not. If you are so impatient, just get a pregnancy test at the pharmacy.|`|a6e7SRYzaa	Get a home pregnancy test|`|3fk6bTMxaa	Tricky question. A short or light period, if this is unusual for you, is a pregnancy sign. Implantation bleeding is spotting pink or brown. You decide. It is vitally important that you begin to take prenatal vitamins and minerals, both for your health and for the health of your baby. You do not need a doctor's prescription for these. Anyone can purchase prenatals. Planned Parenthood will provide free pregnancy testing and show you where to obtain free prenatal care. All pregnant women are entitled to free prenatal care. Best wishes, G|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Everyone doesn't get implantation bleeding. So you may not of gotten it. You will have to go to the doctors and they can tell you how far along you are.
Xct8kXLsaa	yes and my doc told me i can still use the acne meds. |`|bf2b826fb186efa4963970654d24ac34aa	Yep, it's normal. Find something to wash your face with that doesn't have salicylic acid until you are through the first trimester. Some say it can cause birth defects so don't test your luck.|`|b1WMcGQ0aa	Oh, that's gross! That's a part of pregnancy.... Hormones.....|`|jJfo5MSWaa	Sadly, I'm 32 weeks pregnant and I've had acne the ENTIRE time I've been pregnant. I'm like you, I used to get one every now and then, usually when on my period, but since being pregnant I've been breaking out everywhere. Mostly on my face but I've gotten quite a few on my chest, back, and butt. It's stupid, I hate it so much, and no matter how much acne creams and ointments I use, they just keep coming. Apparently it's completely normal. |`|8fr7tMfYaa	I had acne while pregnant.  I also had breakouts before hand as well.  It's hormonal.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It is completely normal. A lot of women break out when they are pregnant. |`|AA10772561	Yes i did not when i pregnant with my boys but this one i did and i never really use to get pimples but once i got into my 2nd trimester it was not so bad any more.. Good luck|`|oaF2kaXAaa	Oh it sucks. My face looked horrible last week.. Thank god its clearing up.. thats what happens when your body is stuffed with all these hormones! Ugh. Hang in there... there is pregnancy beauty ahead... I hope:)|`|hMNIOpW1aa	i am and i think i might be. im with you 6weeks!
B5MDTdtPaa	of course! by having sex/sperm on/in her vagina - how old are you? :S|`|h5xSfcT6aa	yes of course! if she has started her periods then very easily!   through normal sex.<br>  <br>  i really hope you are not 13 trying to get pregnant! bad idea...|`|53HQy6TSaa	You see, the Bush administration took sex ed. out of public schools in exchange for abstinence only education...this is what happens. <br>  <br>  Honey, there was a 6 year old girl who got pregnant. The youngest mother in the world. Sounds fictional, but she's real. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://youngest_mother.tripod.com/" rel="nofollow">http://youngest_mother.tripod.com/</a><br>  <br>  If you can have sex, you can get pregnant. Plain and simple.|`|pqTRARdsaa	it is spelled "pregnant"....and yes, unfortunately at this too young age, it is possible !|`|oXzHvsBpaa	of course they can and what do you mean how? Like everyone else they havve sex.|`|GjuRYsITaa	have you not done sex education at school|`|Vzdu8OH0aa	do you know how screwed your life will be getting pregnant at 13!<br>  <br>  i was 18 and let me tell you.. i planned to have my first child at 24. I had to postpone my education to get a job.<br>  <br>  but at 13 your only at the beginning of high school! you can postpone college or uni but do you really want to be studying with 13 year olds when your like 15.<br>  <br>  not a good idea. plus who the hell wants to have sex with a 13 year old anyway?|`|O5WberWnaa	if you dont know about the birds and the bees yet,you should talk to your parents or some1 else close to you.you have to have sexual intercousre to concive a child. dont play with fire you will get burnt.13 yr olds can get pregnant if they have started their periods.please have a chat to some1 hun x|`|0c9cpmyWaa	thirteen why are you asking such a question i think you need to have a talk with your parents about this question.and at this age i hope that you are not having sex and trying to fall pregnant.|`|CuiWaH3Yaa	Yes they can and you should ask your mum about this not strange people on the internet,or if you are to embarrassed to ask your mum if your school has a nurse or sex education officer or even a school councilor ask them.|`|Nv4euCZtaa	i hope that you aren't thirteen trying to get pregnant or trying to get a thirteen yr old pregnant or already pregant. <br>  <br>  I'm not going to tell you how, ask your mother.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	As long as they've gotten their period. And they can get pregnant just like everybody else can. |`|BEdpwFsWaa	What kind of question is that?<br>  Wow.<br>  Ask your mom? And if you're trying to get pregnant at 13 (If you are) That's a bad idea..<br>  |`|vhtvTh8taa	yes a 13 year old can get pregnant if she has had her period though|`|txDXGNINaa	Yes, if they have started getting their periods (manstruation) and take part in sexual intercourse without any protection (e.g. condoms). |`|taBIaT1Yaa	The bush administration took sex ed out of US schools, but the internet is world wide-ever thought she or he may be from any other country than america? |`|YwZNszKnaa	Of course they can if they have had a period, or even shortly before they start their periods i guess..
VQs0adT8aa	If you have a perfect 28-day cycle, generally, you'll ovulate 14 days after the START of your period.<br>  <br>  A 28-day cycle (in perfect land) would look like this:<br>  Day 1= First day of period<br>  Day 14ish= Ovulation<br>  Day 28= Day before next period, and next cycle starts<br>  <br>  Ovulation occurs roughly 2 weeks (give or take for individuals) before the end of the cycle and the start of the next cycle with a period.  In other words, it takes the body 2 weeks, generally, to figure out that the egg wasn't fertilized and begin the menstrual period.  So for a woman with a 5-week long cycle, ovulation would actually occur somewhere around Day 21, two weeks before the end of the cycle (not necessarily 2 weeks INTO it).<br>  <br>  Sperm can live for several days inside you BEFORE ovulation, and then the egg lives for a few days AFTER ovulation.  So there's a window of possibly up to a week around ovulation when pregnancy is possible.  And then there's the fun thing about how women who are usually consistent can suddenly have a strange cycle when ovulation occurs earlier or later than usual.<br>  <br>  Just go get a test.  Some claim to be able to detect pregnancy by a few days BEFORE you even miss the period.  Get a test like that and use it a few days before you are due for your period so you can know fast.|`|yPNvecc7aa	Always count from the first day of your period. But not everyone ovulates on exactly "day 14". It depends how long your cycle is.<br>  <br>  My cycles varied from 32 to 42 days. The month we conceived was the first month I used ovulation predictor sticks because my cycle was so wacky. I ovulated on day 19.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Well it varies but basically your cycle starts the day you start your period. So 14 days into your cycle is when you would ovulate if you ovulate on day 14. So 14 days after you start not end.|`|c3b47df14624635ce55365f4d86e0963aa	Normally it is counted from the start.|`|ygVTtSNVaa	Usually from the start of your period, but every woman is different so give or take a few days. Best of luck!|`|Qd0sFMdHaa	anywhere from 7 to 14 days after the start of your period. if you get your period on the 1st day of the month, then by the 7th day, you could be ovulating and you could be ovulating up until the 14th day of the month. if your periods are irregular you could have a longer window in which you ovulate. for example, if your periods average longer than 30 days in between one another, then you could ovulate anywhere from 9 to 17 days after the start of your period. but always remember from the Start, not from the end.|`|2PPQUFEwaa	From the start of your period...but everyone varies.

Because you are not in a good situation, that means that you may not be the one to raise your child- but there are people out there that would love to adopt your child.  Not only do abortion take the life of your baby, it also can cause you to have many physical and emotional risks.  Please do the responsible thing, parent or adopt.|`|cnMXJMFUaa	Need more details|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Okay first of all you were the one who decided to have sex so you have to pay for it. If you weren't ready to be a mother then you shouldn't have been having sex. You shouldn't murder your baby because of your mistake. If you absolutely aren't ready to be a mother than give it to a loving family who can't have their own children. |`|WtTUNC8Naa	First of all this is something that you need to be talking about with your parents, not asking random people on the internet. What are you doing having sex to begin with at 15? should you still be in after school programs like girl scouts?<br>  <br>  Seriously though. You need to talk to your parents about this. because on another note, you really didnt go into detail about your situation. so cant really give you good advice other than the fact you need to speak with someone|`|s8P8C92zaa	I was preg. at 16, by the time I had my baby I was 17, but I know how you feel, to some extent.

BUT if you feel like its what you want then its YOUR desision. Let this be your regardless of what anyone here says. Okay?? talk to a counsler at school. They can help you. |`|BQsT9ICxaa	First of all get off the internet and don't ask random people about a situation they know nothing about.  Being pregnant at 15 is never a good situation.  You need to find someone off the internet to talk to and discuss your options and what you can and can't do.  Talk to your parents, if you haven't yet, just do it, you will have to regardless of your decision.|`|flOOmBiGaa	talk to your parents, DONT get an abortion, you can always put your child up for adoption, i am sure somebody out there wants a baby and will take wonderful care of it. i know it is gonna be hard to do, but talk to your parents about it before you take any action, and i am not all talk, i am in a very similar situation, except i am 16, best wishes to you and your child|`|riVBWinHaa	its really not up to us...we dont know your situation, (how you live)<br>  if it were me, by the way i'm 14 idk wat i would do.<br>  if your not going to keep it i think you should have an abortion. but only hav that if its only been a couple weeks so then the baby isn't really even alive yet.<br>  but i know if you give it up for adoption...your most likely not going to want to do it wen the time comes.<br>  good luck!!!<br>  and if you want tell me wat happened!

You will not be able to go to school, work and support the baby without suffering and stressing about your own life. MY opinion would be give him/her up for adoption and look closely into their backgrounds. Give the baby a chance for a happy healthy life with lots of love & attention. Be in contact with the parents at all times to see how she/he are doing. Give your baby a chance and yourself to take care of everything that you want to get accomplished. May God touch your heart with a decision. good luck|`|NMusNsb1aa	first of all dont get an abortion k.<br>  if you dont want the baby at the end then give it up for adoption to a loveable family that really wants a kid.<br>  but if you wanna keep it then thats a good idea =]<br>  i hope your still with your babys daddy!<br>  good luck hun!<br>  keep your head up 
ygVTtSNVaa	I would make an appt to see your OB or doctor and see if they will give you a blood test. Those are 100% accurate and would def. come back positive by now.

AA11108482	Im not 100% sure on my answer, but i would think that it should be as big as a problem considering that there are women who have surgeries and are put under general anesthesia while being pregnant. Of course they normally would do this during the second trimester. I would talk to your dentist and also your OB and get their opinions. I mean if your in that much pain, something needs to be done about it, they can't expect you to suck it up. I know how painful it can be.|`|yU0dp5HDaa	Talk to your OB before you do anything. You are supposed to try and get all your dental stuff done before you are pregnant for some reason so you need to make sure this is all okay. Ask a pharmacist about the paracetamol. |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	First of all you need to let your dentist know you are pregnant. But you need to speak to your doctor. He/she is the only one who can tell you if you can do that or not.

kPfnPbx1aa	If the doctor says everything looks normal, then it is.<br>  <br>  Prenatal vitamins are good for supplementation for YOU during pregnancy.  The baby is already getting whatever he/she needs from your body (assuming you have been eating somewhat healthy), but you need to make sure that your body is replenishing these for your own sake and build stores for coming months.  For the baby in the first three months, the amount is minimal anyway.<br>  <br>  During the second/third trimester is when it becomes more important, especially iron supplements. So, start now.<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  |`|Qfq4lpe7aa	don't worry your baby is fine...to be honest I don't take mine like I am supposed to cause I forget...I don't think you have anything to worry about|`|dXHIoLMcaa	Your baby will be fine, I never took the prenatal vitamins because they made me sick and my babys are very healthy!

Sometimes they make you gain weight.  |`|COvhmZIIaa	I'm just going to say: starving yourself is a stupid thing to do, and it doesn't decrease the chance of becoming pregnant anyways if the deed's already done.|`|ZUIVl95Uaa	Then you should keep your legs closed. If you're not ready to be a parent then you shouldn't be having sex. There's always the risk of getting pregnant...no matter the birth control or barrier method. |`|AA11117186	That won't work. Lots of women spend their entire first trimester throwing up and barely keeping anything besides water down, but they have healthy babies. You're just hurting yourself like that.|`|QM6wiVtVaa	Not true. My sister-in-law is bulimic, and she still got pregnant.|`|qWbjv8QYaa	First, this is a joke, right?  <br>  <br>  But yes, you can still get pregnant.  Drug addicts and alcoholics don't eat and still manage to get pregnant.  Your baby will suffer from your selfishness and immaturity.    <br>  <br>  If you are so desperate not to get pregnant, always use birth control.  In your case, I'd use birth control plus a back-up (condoms).  And get some counseling.  It sounds like you actually are desperate for attention and will in fact become pregnant -- and then use this "I was starving myself so I couldn't be pregnant?!"  Please, go talk to a counselor at school or a friend, someone.  You sound like something is messed up at home or in in your head.  |`|pnlAJ9wLaa	This is a very weird question... even if you are starving yourself you could still end up pregnant. But I wouldn't advise that because if you lose the baby due to low weight you might regret it. Besides, you are also harming yourself by not getting your nutrients. Most bulimic/anorexic people still get pregnant but they miscarry due to lack of nutrients and low weight. I wouldn't risk it though. Its painful to lose the baby after you know you have it.|`|3d3edf885e115810e192ef50466b0d0caa	Thats not true just use birth control,starving yourself have nothing to do with the baby being conceved, and if you were pregnant and starved your self the babys not going to die. be resposable use protection ,more then one kind, get the depo shot, that works, and if you get pregnant explore your options,you can always give the baby up for adoption.|`|tutkGYN4aa	Birth control is far more reliable and less likely to kill you than starving yourself.
HMkPcNwSaa	Figure out when your next period is due to begin and count back 12 to 16 days. This will give you a range of days when you will probably be ovulating. For women with a 28-day cycle, the 14th day is often the day of ovulation. To use this method, you must know how long your cycle usually lasts. <br>  <br>  The best way to determine your most fertile time, though, is to pay attention to your body and learn to spot the signs that ovulation is imminent.<br>  <br>  (Change in cervical mucus). As your cycle progresses, your cervical mucus increases in volume and changes texture. The changes reflect your body's rising levels of estrogen. You are considered most fertile when the mucus becomes clear, slippery, and stretchy. Many women compare mucus at this stage to raw egg whites.<br>  <br>  Normally the mucous is a protective barrier, but during the most fertile time of your cycle, it allows sperm to get through the cervix, up to the uterus, and then to the fallopian tubes for a rendezvous with your egg.<br>  <br>  (A rise in body temperature). Following ovulation, your temperature can increase by 0.4 to 1.0 degrees. You won't feel the shift, but you can detect it by using a basal body temperature (BBT) thermometer. This temperature spike indicates that you've ovulated, because releasing an egg stimulates the production of the hormone progesterone, which raises body temperature.<br>  <br>  You're most fertile in the two or three days before your temperature hits its high point. A few experts think you may have an additional 12- to 24-hour window of fertility after you first notice the temperature creep up, but most say that at that point, it's too late to make a baby.<br>  <br>  "It can take one to two days after ovulation for progesterone to build up enough to raise your body temperature. But since the egg can only survive for about 24 hours, at that point, it's too late for fertilization," says Tracy Telles, an ob-gyn at the Permanente Medical Group in Walnut Creek, California. That's why experts recommend that you chart your temperature by taking it each morning for a few months to detect a pattern and pinpoint your likely ovulatory date. Then you can plan to have sex during the two to three days preceding the day your temperature normally rises.<br>  <br>  (Lower abdominal discomfort). About one-fifth of women actually feel ovulatory activity, which can range from mild achiness to twinges of pain. The condition, called mittelschmerz, may last a few minutes to a few hours.|`|98fb901c3ff53f3233ae0525324142f0aa	My husband and I tried everything!!!

I'm one of them. <br>  <br>  even though I have been in reunion for 9 years, the scars are still with me.<br>  <br>  Do research, before you decide. I hope you chose to stick it out because it is temporary, even though it is very real for you right now.<br>  <br>  |`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	Breastfeeding is not an easy choice, but it's good for the baby. You have done it for 4 months and she has a good start. Even though I think you should continue, it's up to you.<br>  Some men are jerks about helping, they don't think SAHM work, silly boys. You have to make your feelings known.<br>  Get out of the house, meet some people. Get a sitter or exchange babysitting with another couple. <br>  Make sure you aren't suffering from PPD. See a doctor, you might need medication.<br>  <br>  You have gotten a lot of good advice. If you give her up you will have to live with that decision and it will leave you wounded for the rest of your life and when she finds you and asks why did you give me away, no reason will be good enough. <br>  <br>  Babies want their mommies, you need to start leaving her for an hour with your inlaws or your fiance so she will get used to someone else. My son would not take a bottle so it was difficult for others to take care of him, that's why I say just leave her for short times. <br>  <br>  You need your space and some me time. Have a long talk with your fiance, does he know what you are thinking of doing? Get some help, giving her up is not the answer. Trust me, you will regret it.|`|00ddc7f7cc561904db032288ec417cc6aa	I am afraid this is not a decision you can make on your own. Your fiancé would have to agree to place the child for adoption as well. Why don’t you talk to your fiancé and tell him you really need him to step up to the plate.

It's about having your mom.  I know my kids would have rather their first mom be able to raise them.  Are you involved with any play groups or a church group?  Sometimes, you have to make your own family, you know?  So many of us have had to.  In the end I can't tell you what to do, I can just say how I think your daughter will feel later in life...and that is that she loves you and wanted you to always be there.|`|KUnDQfBGaa	I'll let on a few thing,your daughter is going to start wondering at least whom they're real(biological) parents are or were & eventually ask about the fate of their parents,why they gave U up for adoption & even whether you guys are still alive.

All I can say is the best of luck for you and your child & hopefully whatever decision U make,will turn for the best for you & your daughter!|`|TAufQoc7aa	Please dont listen to the people giving out to you. <br>  <br>  1. Maybe you SHOULD be a single mother. Your fiance is offering no support to you when you need it most. If you were on your own with the baby you would at least get child support money. <br>  <br>  2. Its not too late to stop brestfeeding. Although it is good for your baby, it is a big strain on your body and if its not for you, its not for you. <br>  <br>  You will probably have a lot more energy that way<br>  <br>  I hope it all works out for you and Im sorry you are feeling so low :-(|`|481fb39f3d176bea4494d67c5edc1aa5aa	That is very selfLESS of you to want what is best for your daughter.  I agree with several other comments that you should go to the doctor to make sure you are healthy.  If you are considering adoption, I would encourage you to talk to LDS Family Services.  They can offer support for whatever you decide to do.  There are numerous resources available to you and they are trained to help you do what is best for your child.  <br>  It is free and their number is:  1–800–537–2229<br>  Best of luck to you and whether you parent or place your child for adoption, they will know whatever you did, you did out of love for your child.|`|T0r5hofiaa	Hi, Im a military wife with a five month old, an find myself alone with the baby several days during the week. I too chose to quit work to become a breastfeeding stay at home mom. Breast feeding is hard, and makes the body so tired. Please call on a good friend or relative to talk to. I hope adoption would not be a good choice, maybe your just overwhelmed. It does get easier as the baby gets older. If breastfeeding is not going well you can change to formula and take some pressure off of you. Please stay calm around your baby, stress rubs off on them too ya know. The reason she cries when others hold her os because she is not used to anyone else holding her. Give it time, and pass her to the father every now and then to get her used to someone else's smell/touch. I wish you luck hang in there. God Bless, no I dont  think your a horrible mom, just going through a hard time is all. |`|WEekT4b6aa	You need to talk to a family psychologist.  This is a hard decision and one we cannot make for you. <br>  <br>  BUT let me give you some feedback:<br>  1)<br>  You have no support from your fiance because he's NOT committed to the relationship.  <br>  2)<br>  Breastfeeding is NOT the worst decision you ever made.  My wife did it and found that, when things were really tense, the feeding of the baby helped calm her.  She simply commanded her body to relax so the baby could nurse, and the nursing of the baby then calmed her more.  That works well. <br>  3) <br>  You're probably suffering from post-partum depression.  This is a time for you to get support from your OB, a psychologist, etc. and it is NOT a good time to make a decision to do something so major as giving your child up.  <br>  4)<br>  If you give your baby up under the pressure of the current trying situation, you're very likely to suffer a lot of regret for the rest of your life.<br>  5)<br>  You need support.  Find the closest La Leche League group and tell them your situation.  They will give you the support you're not getting at home.<br>  6)<br>  Your fiance works 24/7 ?  You didn't say what kind of work.  If he's a truck driver, it's understandable.  I can't imagine any other job that would take him away from you 24/7 and not be an indication of an attempt to escape from you and the baby.<br>  7)<br>  The headaches are stress triggered, as you said.  You need to discuss this with your OB and a psychologist.  The La Leche League can help you with this also.<br>  8)<br>  You need to discuss the baby's reaction to other people with your OB and the baby's doctor.  I'm not equipped to comment on that.<br>  <br>  I know you only want what's best for her, but you need counseling.  Giving her up won't solve the problems that are stressing you.  <br>  <br>  My personal opinion is that you don't have a viable relationship with your fiance.  I don't think you should marry him.  If you give your daughter away, when he's gone from your life, you will want her back.  And I really do believe that, if you don't break up with him, he will leave you one day.  His working 24/7 tells me he probably doesn't have any real interest in your "relationship".  <br>  <br>  But I don't know all the situation fully enough to guide you, and that's why I keep saying... talk to your OB, your baby's doctor, and a psychologist.  <br>  <br>  It may sound like a quick solution to your problems to you right now, but it really isn't.  Your problems will still be there and you'll also be mourning the loss of the baby you gave up.  <br>  <br>  Finally, I am an adoptee whose mother gave me up.  First she couldn't afford to support us so she turned us over.  Then she finally released us for adoption when she met a new husband who refused to take her if she wanted to keep her children.  I have never tried to find her because I believe she probably suffered from that decision, and I would not wish to add to her pain by being a reminder of what she did.  That's the basis of my suggestions.<br>  <br>  I think you should value yourself enough to let the father go, but since he is the father of the child, he should give you child support for her.  You should not have to give up your child to keep any man. <br>  cw|`|f25603a75ba97c66fad5675abbe08059aa	Being a mother is very stressful at times .  Adoption is permanent and is something you should really, really put a lot of thought into.  <br>  Seek counseling before  making this kind of decision , Not counseling from an Adoption Agency they will convince you that giving your child up is whats best,  They do not tell what you will go through after all is said and done .<br>  Hang in there find a support group with mothers going through what you are going through.  <br>  In my Opinion whats best for a child is to be with their natural mother  <br>  now if the mother is abusive,drug addict  etc. the best for the child is to be given a good home life with loving a-parents.<br>  please hang in there , it doesn't seem like it at the moment but it does get better<br>  |`|fPFXJr3eaa	No, don't give up your daughter.  It would be the worst decision you ever made.  You think things are bad now, it will only get worse if you give your daughter up.  First, you and your fiance need some support so try and network with other parents of young children.  Join a parenting group or something; get out and see you are not alone.  Being isolated makes things ten times worse.  It is also possible you, your partner or both are suffering from PND so SEEK HELP!<br>  <br>  Secondly, research what adoption will do TO you and your more, your child.  It will not give you anything or your daughter; it will only take.  Any issues you have now will get worse as they will not be resolved by severing ties with your child.  If you can't work things out with your fiance then HE needs to go, not your daughter!<br>  <br>  Being a mum is HARD work and there are days when you want to pull your hair out due to sleep deprivation.

I'm not being fresh here - just pragmatic.  It isn't that I think fathers don't matter, but right now, at your baby's age, the most important relationship for her is the one she has with you.   Things get easier when babies get a little older, but right now being tired is part of the deal.  <br>  <br>  You should think about talking to your doctor to see if you may be going through postpartum depression.  That's the first thing.  While you're talking to the doctor (or his/her nurse) mention what's giving you the most trouble.  Maybe they'll have some suggestions.<br>  <br>  Think about signing up for a "mommy site", where mothers get to talk about what they're going through and give each other suggestions.<br>  <br>  Having a baby usually means that we figure out a way to rise to the occasion, get up whatever energy we need to keep going, and become better people than we knew we could be.  If you have postpartum (or any other kind of depression) you won't feel that way.  On the other hand, if you're just feeling frazzled and stressed, there are ways to deal with sorting things out and reducing stress.  One thing is to try to think of how nice it is just to have  your baby to yourself, see this time as a special time to share with her, and just think about making her feel as secure, calm, and treasured as you can.  If you focus on her and on your wish to help her feel calm and treasured, you may start to find you feel a little less stressed out.<br>  <br>  It may be stupid of me to try to offer you "inspiration", but on this link<br>  <br>  <a href="http://lhwarren.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://lhwarren.blogspot.com/</a><br>  <br>  there are (under September, and I think on the first page) two pieces I wrote about being a mother.

I don't know - but I thought I'd try.<br>  <br>  By the way, I have one adopted son and two biological children.|`|A6cJd3Kraa	I am sorry to hear that you are finding parenthood so hard. Babies are hard work. You are exhausted and the reality of motherhood is rarely the cutesy pictures we are fed by the media. I think that first off you need support.  <br>  <br>  Do you have a maternal health nurse or a postnatal clinic you can attend? It will help to discuss your feelings and be reassured that you are not the first new mum to feel this way. They can also assess you for post natal depression and get you help if needed.<br>  <br>  Have you been put in touch with other mothers with new babies? The friendships you develop in these "mothers groups" can be lifelines. You can share the stresses of parenting with others, swap tips and even make lifelong friends.<br>  <br>  Consider that you may not be suited to being a stay at home mum. Not everyone is. Maybe you could look at working part time, just to get yourself out, rediscover yourself and gain some perspective on your situation.<br>  <br>  Your fiancee is probably doing what he feels is right, trying to get ahead to support the family. Use the support offered by your husbands parents. If not book your child into occasional care. They are set up to cater for this exact situation, to provide support when you don't have it and give you some time out.<br>  <br>  I was in a similar situation to you five years ago though by that stage I had 4 children aged 4 1/2 , 3, 18mths and newborn. I had no family nearby (mine or husbands), and my husband was away from monday morning to Friday evening, and then tired on the weekend. It is really really hard work. What got me through was the friends I made through mothers group/playgroups, and occasional care 1 - 2 times a week (for 3 hrs each time). I know this is your first but sometimes that can be harder.<br>  Having a first child throws your world upside down, and can turn competent adults into quiverring wrecks.  <br>  <br>  I wouldn't be ringing up the adoption agencies just yet! You are just over-reacting out of stress and anger at you fiance. Your daughter is far better with you. You love her and she loves you. You are a new mum who is struggling with the transition into motherhood and you need to get your support networks in place. Hang in there. I know it sounds trite, but this period will pass very fast and before you know it you will be waving her off to school. Try to enjoy it despite how hard it is. Good luck, and please try to seek out some support.|`|AA10766157	I wish I could give you words of wisdom that would open your eyes, solve all your problems, and give you piece but I can't I agree with several of the folks that have answered you already, Let this man know you need his help and his support also  make a life for your self don't wait ans let him tell you what you can an can not do with this child ( his family included) you are going to do fine you know how I know because yo are prepared to make the hardest decision of your life to make sure this child is taken care of.

Just remember you have to live with your decision for the rest of your life. I know that there are many couples out there that are more than happy to adopt your daughter because they can't have their own children. I would give it some real thought before you do though. This isn't just an easy decision you make. Will you be able to live with yourself for the rest of your life knowing you gave your child away because it got a little hard. There are several single parents out there that have a hard time but they stick through it because they love their children and they're the ones who decided to have sex and get pregnant in the first place. Good luck on whatever you decide.

Do you know when you ovulate? I ask this because it is very important to know. I tried for over a year with no results, but do not get discouraged. I was not ovulating not to mention my ex had a problem. The miracle of the matter is that I conceived without him getting fixed as well as myself! If it will make you feel better go and get checked there's no harm. Best of luck.
1nDkVocaaa	I would call and make an appointment with your doctor. To have a positive test and then a negative could single a miscarriage has occured.<br>  <br>  About 15 percent of recognized pregnancies end this way. As many as 50 percent of all pregnancies may end in miscarriage, because many losses occur before a woman realizes she is pregnant.<br>  <br>  Or it could just be the test.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|IWinNj2saa	1 positive means you are pregnant. no matter how many negatives you get. Go to your local Health Department, they usually test for free, instead of wasting money on HPT's.

A false positive is VERY rare.  Even more so with the digital tests.  I agree with the post that asked if the subsequent tests were taken later in the day.  It may also be that you experienced a very early miscarriage.  I don't want to be negative, but that's why you really should see your doctor and have blood work done.  Hopefully it's just faulty second tests.  Good luck|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It's uncommon to get a false positive but it can happen. I suggest you get a blood test done to be sure. Good luck!|`|iyRWN59Xaa	That depends when you took the tests...I would go to the doctor and have a blood test.|`|JemYTym5aa	I've found the digital tests to be a bit more particular than the regular pee sticks. I never get early positives on them, so if you took the second 2 tests with second and third morning urine, then there's a good chance that the concentration of hCG  wasn't high enough for the subsequent digital tests to pick it up.  <br>  <br>  Try holding your pee for as long as you can and testing again, or wait to test again tomorrow morning.  Each day your hCG levels should increase a bit. <br>  <br>  Good luck, and congrats!|`|Fdh7j4uraa	It depends. Did you take the first test with your first morning urine and then the subsequent tests later on? If that is what you did, then you are probably pregnant. Buy another test and take it first thing tomorrow morning.|`|c0cb979abb77dc7436cdcf4b66d1d6afaa	well if one said + and two said - then threes a good chance that the first test might of been defective, call you doctor and have the blood test to know for sure, good luck |`|wQgVN6KTaa	I have always heard that there are VERY few false positives.

yPNvecc7aa	Usually you don't ovulate for a good week or two after your period ends. It's unlikely you'd be pregnant from having sex the day after your period ended.<br>  Have you been reading up on how to track your ovulation? Because that's when you should be timing sex.<br>  <br>  And it is still possible to really feel symptoms when there is nothing going on. I never had sore boobs during PMS until I started trying to conceive. I learned that my body is cruel and will let me think I am pregnant just for kicks. My cycles even went on for up to 42 days sometimes, obviously making me think I was late and pregnant.<br>  <br>  You really need to relax and not obsess over something that you cannot control. It will happen when it happens. The more you obsess, the more you stress, the less likely you are to get pregnant. (I stopped myself from ovulating for a couple of months because I was so stressed!)<br>  <br>  And trust me, once you finally get pregnant, you will know. And it won't be because you had the typical simptoms you read about. You will have symptoms you didn't even know existed!<br>  : )<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I think that you should wait a week and test again or talk to your doctor and see if you can get a blood test.

Most women ovulate 2 weeks after the first day of their period. So if you had a period on Sept 1 you will be ovulating around the Sept 14. YOu can take a pregnancy test around Sept 26 and get a positive. However it best to test on the first day of your missed period.<br>  <br>  Though i new i was pregnant way before i could have tested. And it wasn't in my head because me and my husband were not trying. I felt yucky. i was nausous, had heartburn and my boobs got a lot bigger. That was 8 days before my period was due.

Which is the only pain in the butt symptom of pregnancy that I ever gets. So I knew right away. I kept telling my BF that I was, and he said he didn't think I was. But I was right. Not all women trying to conceive get the symptoms cause they really want them, but because they are pregnant. Good Luck to you. 
IWinNj2saa	You have a UTI. Or a yeast infection. Until you get antiobiotics, it won't go away. Dont worry, it's common in pregnant women. See if you can find a walk in clinic. Drink Plenty of water and cranberry juice, it helps. If there is no walk in clinic, go to the ER. It takes about 36-72 hours after first dose of antibiotics, for the pain to go away. They also sell something called Uristat on the shelf at walmart, by the monistat, that will take away the burning sensation, but your pregnant, you would have to ask the doctor if it's safe. |`|ifUB8Zziaa	you can get diarhea sometimes in pregnancy drink plenty of water.. it sounds like you may have a urine infection maybe if your really concerned go to the hospital.. and have your urine checked for sugar and protein.urine infections can be pretty common in oregnancy|`|5vU73VLuaa	It sounds like a UTI. Best to make an appointment before you buy any over the counter creams. You can never be sure what is okay to take while pregnant.|`|0iUxfCMcaa	sounds like a uti if you cant get ahold of your doctor then get to the ER they can give you the meds you need to clear it up.|`|hdxGiVJraa	These sound like the symptoms of a very fatal and painful disease called aginal-vay hermectulitis. It's where you pee and you feel a burning sensation in your downstairs and the baby can also feel it so it will probably be born with birth defects. The most common ones are having three toes on each foot or pink hair on their head. The best thing to do is to start drinking moutain dew, the acids and carbonation help sooth your downstairs so there may be a chance of no birth defects or your death but i can't guarantee anything|`|QzfasTCNaa	Sounds like cystitis, go to the pharmacist and see what they recommend. Tell them you're pregnant cos there are some things you can't take. Drink buckets of cranberry juice and water. Applying yogurt to the outside of the vagina can help the burning.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I have never heard of anyone experiencing that. I would speak to another doctor in your doctors office. You may have a urinary tract infection. I think that is common during pregnancy but I'm not sure.|`|IOcgqIBvaa	oh you have a bladder  infection, you must do something about it as soon as possible go to another hospital, Until you get antiobiotics, it won't go away good luck.|`|n9qY46Svaa	It sounds like a urinary tract infection to me.<br>  <br>  Very common during pregnancy, and very unpleasant too.<br>  <br>  You will need antibiotics from your doctor to prevent the infection spreading to your kidneys.  |`|HtpBUPP4aa	It could be an STD or something that is done from sex. But i think that you should go to the doctor and get that checked because it could be any kind of STD.|`|AA11451321	sounds like a urine infection, go to the chemist and ask the pharmacist or get an app asap with your gp in the morning. Drink cranberry juice, this can help aswell|`|fdWIP0Yiaa	may be a UTI, drink cranberry juice and a lot of water|`|lQORNmNiaa	It sounds like you might have a bladder infection.  You'll need to see a doctor for antibiotics.  If your doctor isn't in today, you could try going to a medcheck or the ER.  You'll want to get it cleared up as soon as you can.|`|7jqbOuaiaa	I get that burning sensation every once in a while.  I take a cranberry tablet for a couple of days and it goes away. Good Luck!!|`|miPubuDYaa	Sounds like a UTI. go to the doctor because this can be serious|`|OJFz0LBZaa	its sounds like a uti, and sorry but i don't think there is anything you can take without seeing your doctor, maybe go to the chemist and ask the pharmacy if there is anything you can take for it, but best bets to wait till tomorrow 
Jwd5uIVwaa	No, you have only two options: abortion or carrying it to term and giving it up for adoption.<br>  <br>  Unlike alot of posters here, I think that abortion (provided it's done in the first trimester) is not a big deal and you'll be fine. DO NOT let religious pressures influence you. <br>  <br>  Let your heart and brain influence you: will you be able to sign the papers willingly when the baby is born? Will you be able to afford the baby and giving up the life as you knew it if you keep the baby? If not, and you've TRULY thought about it thoroughly, consider abortion.|`|MtC3CWZraa	The baby isn’t a kidney or heart that can be moved to someone else. You’ll have to revisit the choices you’ve eliminated because they’re the only possibilities. |`|jQDeTTVhaa	yes you sure can when the baby is born|`|vek2OwQfaa	No.... lol |`|KGppArcfaa	Sorry hun, its not possible. So you have 3 options now, abortion, adoption, or being a mama. I kno you say your not ready, but you know, no one really ever is until your baby comes, than you just know. <br>  I got pregnant at 19 (im 22 now) and def. wasn't ready, but I knew the other two options werent for me. So now im a mommy, and its hard but worth it. When you give birth and you say your baby, it will be the best day of your life and you'll know you did the right thing.<br>  I know its a hard decision, and you think your not ready, but you'll do better for that baby than anyone else. <br>  If you wanna talk, you can msg me. Good luck! |`|wXtqKFf8aa	Wow, that's a really good question. It's not possible sadly. The baby has already implanted itself onto your uterus. That's actually very caring of you, why don't you just go through with the pregnancy, and give it to someone who can't have kids. There are plenty out there. I know it will be hard but think how much happiness you'll be giving the baby and the family. I wish you all the best. GL.|`|2MKvrydWaa	no i'm afraid that is not possible.i'm 26 weeks prego and by the end of the day i would love to let somebody strap my stomach on and take it for a spin.lol.but i kno i'm going to be the one carrying it until she comes out.don't worry u should be fine.pregnancy goes by pretty quick.before u kno it it will be over.good luck!!!!|`|9c8893607c79c3c2b3e1d6817da78217aa	Sorry, once the egg has implanted you're in for the long haul or none at all. If babies could be saved after the placenta is ripped from the uteran wall, there'd be a lot more mommys in this world.|`|jXG0m5zsaa	No. The baby is already growing inside your uterus. It can not be transferred to somebody else. |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	There is nothing like that sorry. If there was then tons of people would probably be doing that instead of aborting their babies. |`|LeNeinDUaa	you're right, you aren't ready for a child. I'm surprised you even knew how to have intercourse right.|`|aKiynqA6aa	i've never heard of that; you'll pretty much just have to give it up for adoption unless you decide to keep it|`|X0kV9rTbaa	No you cant.  I would suggest going to the doctor and speaking to them.  You can go ahead with the pregnancy and then the baby can be adopted.  You should speak to your gp and ask if they have any information on this or perhaps look it up on the internet. It would be a good idea if you could perhaps speak to someone who given their baby up for adoption.  Good luck and I hope you make the right decision for yourself and the baby. |`|3MeWD8E2aa	I think that you should carry it to term and then think about keeping it or giving it up for adoption..... not trying to be mean but think about all the women out there who would love to have children of their own but cant.... just carry it to term and just keep adoption in mind and when the baby gets here you might want to keep it!!|`|yODD8hoFaa	If only that were possible... that would completely eliminate abortion and make a lot of infertile women very happy.  <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, that's not medically possible.  <br>  <br>  This is a very hard decision, and I wish you the very best.|`|WsEFCpemaa	No, there is not. If you are opposed to the alternatives then you will just have to have the baby and keep it.|`|lFrMiN7eaa	wow no comment sweet heart take it easy think of it as a blessing it could change your life. god bless and that child.|`|aqELlHC9aa	i am no doctor....but ill say confidently no.....sorry about your predicament....you have to do what good for you ....then whats good for the child......good luck|`|vue9NOhYaa	No, medical science does not currently have any way of transferring a fetus from one woman to another.  (If this WAS possible, there would be many thousands of women lining up to have it done.)|`|tkSXjqhuaa	Wow.<br>  Just wow.<br>  
AA10167940	The only way to confirm a pregnancy is to take a test.  |`|sl8ffVHVaa	yes you could be pregnant. Having unprotected sex can lead to pregnancy. The only way to be sure is to take a TEST|`|t4cLXlBJaa	My ex-husband and I had sex EVERY SINGLE DAY FOR 30 DAYS. . .AND NIGHTS. . . .TRY-Y-Y-Y-YING to get pregnant.  NOTHING HAPPENED !   The FOLLOWING month, because we were tired of so much sex, we only had sex ONCE !    BAM !!!!!    I GOT PREGNANT.   The morale to the (true) story is.. . . . .pregnancy happens when you're NOT trying !   And, no!  That DOESN'T, necessarily, mean you're pregnant.  I was 3wks. LATE. . . .and though I had NO SIGNS. . . .I WAS, in fact, PREGNANT !!!|`|JZ3JYH5Baa	1st too much info 2nd do a test 3rd go to a doctor 4th derrrrr???? i just stated the obvious for u OK|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	You could be.

Please make sure this is what you want, as having a baby is not a game.  <br>  It sounds like it may be too late.  You can take an early detection pregnancy test now.

It's a possibility by the way.|`|x6IeGjshaa	get tested for free at the pregnancy research center.
miPubuDYaa	We have a similar situtation. My daughter is also six. Me and my husband are expecting our first child together. I have full cusody and my daughter lives with full time. <br>  <br>  We have a 2 bedroom 1 bath apt as well. We have the master, she has the second bedroom. Our bedroom is large enough for a crib. So we are putting the crib in our bedroom and when the baby is about 9 months old - year we are shipping it out into my daughter room.<br>  <br>  I think you could keep the baby near you in your room untill it sleeps through the night than you can have it sleep in the second bedroom with his half brother. you have to make due with what you have, And there is no need to get another bedroom.<br>  <br>  The reason why i want the crib in our room until the baby is bigger is because i'm gonna breastfeed and i don't want to be getting up and having to get the baby into our room anyway. feed it and then return it to his crib in the other room. all awhile waking up everyone in ear shot because it taking me 30 seconds to get it rather than 5 seconds|`|T8ksKCWCaa	Make the room a nursery; make the couch up with skulls when the 6 yr old comes over. |`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	Ask the 6 year old how he feels about sharing the room? Since he only visits and doesn't sleep in there odds are he won't care so long as his things stay in tact. And decorate anyway you want! Tell him he can help pick things out; just no skulls and cross bones.|`|8VJwoGXKaa	You should use that room for your baby, if your fiance's son doesn't use it then you aren't "kicking him out."  Any logical person could look at your situation and say the same thing. You're right.  Good luck!|`|AA11756768	How about getting a couch for the nursery? Then you can use the couch when your fiance's son isn't there and he will get to sleep on the couch and in his shared bedroom. You could also get some blankets and pillows and things that are easy to put away for his sons new "bed" so the room can look the way you want most of the week and get the room ready before he comes so he can feel at home. You could also get some type of divider for the room like one of those folding screens so he can have a small amount of privacy if he wants it, though it doesn't really sound like that would be an issue if he likes sleeping on the couch. |`|MtC3CWZraa	Two opinions matter here, yours & your husband’s. The child doesn’t get to choose where he sleeps or the décor of his room. Other people don’t get to dictate the décor of your home or how you set up the sleeping situation. <br>  <br>  Discuss your concerns with your husband and reach a compromise with him. <br>  <br>  I just got the best line ever for unwanted advice today courtesy of Slate.com’s “Dear Prudence” <br>  <br>  “I'm sorry, I'm not in the market for advice."<br>  <br>  Remember that for the next time someone not in your household tries to run it. <br>  |`|bMyq2nOTaa	I see no prob with him sleeping on the couch, and apparently his dad and mom don't, either. Sorry, but that really isn't your place, to enforce it.<br>  <br>  However, if he's not using the room, I also see no prob with it being mainly a nursery... Half and half? The boy will eventually want his room, but, maybe they'll have their own rooms, by then. And, the baby really doesn't care how the nursery is done up. :) Good luck, though!|`|7cbnFfIdaa	i would feel the same as you if i were in this situation. this is your first baby and you want to experience the fun of decorating the babies room. you can find a way to make the room fit for both the kids, i mean what does everyone expect you to do with all the babies stuff anyways? its your house too and you should have some say. the 6 year old is gonna have to learn to share anyways so why not now?|`|y3vozJ8Aaa	first talk to your fiance. tell him, if his son wants to start sleeping in this room (like he should be), then you may reconsider. but if he still wants to sleep on the couch, then he can cope with it.... either way, you need to teach the 6 year old to share. he isn't the only one anymore.|`|iyRWN59Xaa	Well, what does fiance say about it?  They can share the room...just because he doesn't use it, doesn't mean he won't.  Do half the room for baby and half the room for him.  Then dad needs to start enforcing the no sleeping on couch thing...and work that out with mom.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I don't see any problem with turning it into a nursery. The son isn't there that often anyway and if he doesn't use the room then there isn't a problem. Have you spoken to your fiance about it? |`|9c8893607c79c3c2b3e1d6817da78217aa	I'd move a crib into it. Lots of siblings have to share a room. Maybe wait until you are a little bit farther along though.|`|aXESNuBKaa	i would be pissed...you need to make it into a nursery.|`|43610f61e745e21fe38388296de975f9aa	No. I think its kinda rude to make his son's room into a nursery. <br>  <br>  I live in a 2bdrm house and have one child and im pregnant with my second and i would never take his room away. We're moving.<br>  <br>  Its still his room, and i think he's gonna feel pushed out of the family if u just take his room away. <br>  <br>  I went through a similar situation when i was a kid and thats how i felt. Ask him how he feels about sharing the room with the baby.<br>  <br>  Im not trying to judge u or anything but i think his son still needs his room... If u take it away for the new baby it gives the impression that the new baby is loved more...|`|3OFhIHa7aa	i agree with you i would do the same. i turned my brothers room into my baby's room bc he had the same problem with sleeping on the couch. i see no problem with you using it, i mean your leaving his stuff in there so whats the problem. its your house anyways. i know that sounds rude but its true. well good luck with everything i hope it all works out. : )|`|2lhTo6wZaa	u should be able to do what you want with it who ever told you that your pushing him out is dumb. if his son doesnt use the room then why cnt you++ really just do it  |`|dab488452d80c989cf4fa967c4f59264aa	its a tough situation.  I personally say go for it.  its a two bedroom house.  your baby will be there all the time ur fiances son is only there a few days a month.  ask the boy what he thinks about sharing the room with his baby brother/sister.  if he says he doesnt mind then whats to stop you.  tell him he will still have his toys and his bed in there, but that you also need a place for the new baby.  try to explain the best you can to him, and ifs not angry then all is well|`|jhPO37kpaa	I think it should definately be something that is agreed on and I could understand your husband being offended if you made the choice to change the room without discussing it with him. I would suggest talking to your fiance's son. It IS HIS room. let him know you are considering putting the baby in the same room. Ask if he would be willing to share. Do his part of the room his way and the baby's your way. When is your lease up? The baby will probably be in your room for the first few months anyhow. Either way- I definately do not suggest making the decision on your own. This is something that the three of you- as a family- need to come to a comprimise on.
h6AH6Biyaa	There's nothing like worrying about a possible pregnancy to make you think, "Yeow!  What am I going to do IF ... "<br>  <br>  If you miss your period, wait a few more days, then get a pregnancy test at the drug store and see what it shows.  If it comes out positive, get started with an obstetrician right away.  Pre-natal care is vital, both for your health and the health of the baby.<br>  <br>  If the test comes out negative but your symptoms persist, take another test in a week or ten days.  If it's still negative, perhaps there's something else going on that needs medical evaluation.|`|YVWlAvqEaa	Sounds more like paranoia. You don't start feeling the signs of pregnancy for about two weeks or so into your pregnancy. Many women don't even start signs until after finding out they are pregnant because the hormones that help with pregnancy get higher and higher at that point. A few days after sex even if the egg was fertilized, it would not have attached yet, and until it attaches you're not truly pregnant.|`|yW9R8mapaa	Take a test when it's time for your period. that's the only way. You probably aren't if the condom didn't break or anything, but you'll have to wait until it's time for you period! |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I don't think you experience any of that a few days after you have sex. I think your just paranoid. It may just be signs your period is coming.|`|WGXdfh22aa	if you were pregnant i dont think you would notice any signs that early so unless you've missed your period i would relax. wait for your period if it doesnt come take a test.|`|Oc8e7wAXaa	Take a pregnancy test, it doesn't matter where it's from, it does matter how much it cost, it can cost $1 for all I'm concerned, They work trust me, I know, I took like 15 of them $1 ones..... If it comes out to be POSITIVE, then you are.... If it is NEGATIVE, that could mean 1 of 3 different things, 1) it could mean your not pregnant, obviously<br>  2) It could mean you took it too early<br>  Or<br>  3) It could be a FALSE NEGATIVE, They do happen...<br>  <br>  But if you really want to make sure, wait and see if you miss your period... but keep in mind that a small number of "pregnant" women can have up to 3 periods and still be pregnant, it is possible...|`|AO70SrlGaa	Yeah ur not going to see any signs that soon. Wait until you have a missed period brfore you get freaked out. If you had any oral contact that might be why your breast feel sensetive or heavy. and also that might be your conscience playing a guilt trip on you. That's if you feel slightly guilty.|`|7c590b9146b7b250a93a8753d07308c5aa	You will not know after a "few days" no way! It's all in your head, your probably fine.

GYFhJdKFaa	i am also pregnant at the moment and had to cancel the interview to start college this year, instead i am going next year (please see my question!).  I worked part time while my 2 youngest were in nursery and school, now that they are both in school i am happy to go back to college with the new baby as i feel like colleges are more flexible with people having children now a days, rather than getting stressed about making work on time etc.  It probably will be hard doing work and having a new born but at least by the time the baby is older you will be able to get a good job and feel better not having had to work 9 -5 and miss out on baby growing up. hope this helps|`|1pXVe5SOaa	actally im 18 and i have 2 kids already and i would not reccomend it if u want to go to school because its way to hard i mean because babies are expensive u know diapers formula and food i mean right now gas prices and food prices are on the rise and so are school expenses and its getting really hard to get school loans so i would not reccomend having another baby because one toddler is a handfull u dont need another one now the best hing to do would be to wait till ur done with school concentrate on school right now that ur young then consentrate on building a family u have the rest of ur life|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	If you think you are ready to have another baby then only you can decide that. Only you know if you can finacially handle it and if it would make things hard on you. You do have to think that when you go to school are things going to be okay with two children. Good luck!
r7q8LW7Aaa	Gosh, there's been a couple of weird answers with this....<br>  I had my first without an epidural - it was agony! I am however, glad that I managed without it as I do know there are complications associated with it. At the time, I'd have given my entire bank account contents and so much more for an epi though!<br>  It depends on you - all that crap 'there is a place for pain in childbirth' amused me. Of course it comes with pain, but it doesn't make it a more beautiful experience! When they hand you your baby, it is magical - when you are pushing it out - it's bloody horrible! if you can cope without then go for it, but it doesn't make you any less of a person, or a parent, if you ask for the epidural!<br>  I'm due any day now - well actually 9 days ago.... but honestly, I'll have the epidural if they can give it to me! I'm in no hurry to repeat that kind of pain again. These days, it's far safer than it used to be.|`|x6IyESABaa	It really depends on you. Whether you feel it's worth it and weight the pro and cons. Natural is always the best. I'm going for natural without epidural|`|47eiwyMLaa	Maybe you should watch the Business of Being Born (on netflix or probably at your local video store)..then make the decision about the epidural.<br>  |`|9f781acdd2a8d587f475cd9992a7adeaaa	I want to have my baby without an epidural but if the pain gets too bad, I won't hesitate to ask for one!|`|yIdgG8b1aa	Hi. I am pregnant with my first and have been going through the same thing. After alot of research i have decided to put it in my notes and see how my contractions go and if i cant handle it then im gonna go for it. I have found so many people telling me not to go for it because it gives you problems. Problems that i have found to be true are: Birth will be longer, not sure when to push and more chance of tearing. (some may disagree with me and tell you this isn't true or there are more problems than this but this is what i was told by my midwife and using yahoo) My reasons for having are: Im gonna be in labour for a while anyway so if its longer its nt really in my control. If im going to tear i really don't want to feel it and with the pushing i don't want to feel like i am dieing when i am pushing and the doctors will be there to help. For me anyway im just not very good with pain and i'm not going to put on a brave face and pretend i can handle it when i cant!but then i really am a whip and had to be put to sleep when my wisdom teeth were being pulled out! lol. |`|ESIULrZoaa	I'm very much for it.  I didn't have one with my first child and things were very rough, wound up having an emergency C-Section because after 23 hours of hard labor (with pitocin) I couldn't dialate past 5.  The 2nd two labors I had the epidural, they were pain free and I had the babies the old fashioned way also both were faster too, my Dr. said it was because I could relax so my body was able to dialate faster.  <br>  Either way Good luck and congratulations!!|`|PZn5qci7aa	epidural will slow things down and u will be stuck on a bed for days, will have to hav a cathator put up ur urethura and it hurts believe me!<br>  also i got an infection from the cathator and u know how u sting down there for about a weeks after giving birth? well i had that for 7 weeks, as my body was week from giving birth i was put on antibiotics for weeks and they couldnt fight it so i got out on stronger ones, i will never ever get a cathator in again|`|QCVzUC1baa	I had an epidural a week a go and it was well worth it. I was in labour for 41 hours and then had to have a c-section.<br>  <br>  I would go for it.<br>  The one thing i learnt about labour is expect the unexpected but then you have done it twice already.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I know that as long as the doctors let me I'm getting an epidural. I know I won't be able to endure the pain unless I absolutely have to... Good luck! Congratulations!|`|ANJfAAWnaa	For, god i don't think i'd cope without it, and i have a high tolerance for pain |`|73hsvCU0aa	I absolutely recommend it!|`|sINAaRudaa	Get one its well worth it i have heard|`|X0kV9rTbaa	I had an epidural with my 1st baby.  And then with my 2nd I decided that I didn't want one (no rhyme or reason) then when I was in Labour after about an hour I was begging for the epidural lol.  It was so intense but my Labour only lasted 2hrs 45 mins and they had to cancel it because it was so fast.  I did have gas and air and then some diamorphine.  Don't know about anyone else but I think Diamorphine takes the edge off the pain but I just felt like I was on another planet with it lol. |`|gngWB4oIaa	No, no, no! With this baby you are likely to have a shorter labour. If you have done it twice before then you can do it again. People who have epidurals have longer labour, more intervention such as acceleration,  and are more likely to have an instrumental delivery and caesarean section. But it depends on how you view birth. Personally i believe that there is a place for pain in childbirth and it has a lot to do with bonding and attachment and transition into motherhood. I agree with the above post - watch 'the business of being born' as i think its a really good educational tool for mums. Good luck! |`|f5c840d7deb2bdbef3fa8b152ae928adaa	My sister opted for an epidural and said it was absolutely great.  She didn't feel any pain just a pressure near her bum.  It's entirely your choice whether you want one or not and there's nothing to be embarrassed about (some women think it takes away the whole experience of childbirth...!!) .  If you need one go for it, anyone saying otherwise can scoot off since they're not going through it!  Just make sure you talk to your doctor to find out what's involved, what to expect and of any risks involved.  Congratulations and hope all goes well xxx|`|EDbnHmhdaa	I was adamant i wasnt having one but i was induced with an oxytocin drip and it was really painful!  As it turns out, it was the best thing that ever happened to me :D.  it really took the edge off,.  They do turn it down near the end so that you can feel when to push and you cant feel your legs for a very short while afterwards.  They are side effects, you can develop quite a bad headache the day or so after labour but that didnt happen with me.<br>  <br>  Also the needle looks more scary than it is.  they tell you not to move while they are doing it but it is easier than it sounds.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|TcwRv6vfaa	FOR!! i had one with my first as i have a really low intolerance to pain! i wanted to enjoy the birth of my child which i couldn't do without it. you can make the desion on the day. i tried gas and air but then opted for the epidural. i would say the only downside for me was that my legs where dead till midday the next day. so i had to be sifted on to a bed pan when i needed a wee. |`|YHdjNv87aa	i have had 6 children and 4 epidurals and i would recommend them to anyone there fantastic you can enjoy your baby's birth without all the pain. im planning on having one with my new baby |`|1k6X5CAMaa	if the pain is becoming unbearable absolutely go for the epidural, they don't give you any special award for going without! |`|887473dd6877337cb899156218187fc8aa	I would advise it. It does not harm your baby and puts your body at ease in order for things to happen naturally. I would get it. gl and congrats!|`|a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	I am for epidural. I didnt have one because I wanted to go all natural (which wasnt bad at all) but if someone wants one- go for it! People have different pain tolerances. My sister has already said she would never consider going all natural but I was different and would never consider an epidural for myself. |`|SIhEme03aa	I would definitely recommend it! After I had the epidural I didn't feel a thing for the remainder of the labor. I also didn't have any symptoms afterwards, like headache or nausea. It worked great for me! Good Luck!
44ccf078ecbbb80711e26204438034abaa	I always felt the same way. I'd even cry about it. <br>  <br>  Problem is it was all hormonal. I found that when my clothes didn't fit right it was best to go buy a new outfit that did. <br>  <br>  But stop beating yourself up. If your fiance wants that baby you are the most beautiful women in the world to him right now. So try and think about that next time you're upset. |`|VzOokYEqaa	i totally feel you! i had the same problem around 8 months on. i  just wanted to be done being pregnant. there isn't anything you can really do to change how you feel because its your emotions that are out of whack. i say have a day at the spa! they do some awesome maternity massages. and take the time to get your hair and make up. every little bit helps. keep up with walking and what you can to work out. it will help you post pardum. <br>  <br>  and i told my man after im done having babies he is buying me new boobs and lasering the stretch marks lol good luck with your baby!|`|cncAzZPiaa	I feel the SAME way! Just know you're not the only one going through this. My hubby tells me that I'm beautiful too, but it doesn't cut it. I feel very depressed, and completely unattractive. Try a self-tanning lotion, that helped me a little. And maybe go get a hair cut, or dyed (my doc said any of those this are okay)<br>  Congrats on your pregnancy! The thing I have to keep reminding myself is that I'll have control of my own body again soon... Hang in there.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I don't have stretch marks or anything YET but I feel the same way. My face just looks horrible. My husband trys telling me that I look exactly the same and I'm extremely beautiful but I don't feel beautiful. I'm sorry that you feel that way and I'm sure your fiance is right. Try to chear up. Imagine in a few months you are going to be holding your beautiful baby and it will all be worth it. Congrats!|`|91sbAzoaaa	let your self be pampered if ur fiance is to busy go to a spa and relax shop for baby and for you, fix ur self up now days the clothes are much cuter and get ur hair done  ask your man to massage ur back legs  feet the stretch marks go away with time and they have procedures for them if you want them gone right away after the baby is born, most likely if you feel bad about your apperance u really don't feel like fixing ur apperance but try |`|vywtN8gPaa	you are beautiful and dont worry this is something natural and very beautiful all people are going thru in life.your baby will make you forget all bad things in life|`|VInhIOhtaa	i hope you can see my belly is full of stretch marks after 3 month i gave birth.<br>  I tried for 8 years and nothing happened there was a doctor who told me that i will never be able to get pregnant.<br>  When i got pregnant it was the most fabulous thing in my life, i couldn't believe it.<br>  i started counting the days and looking myself in the mirror 3-4 times Daily looking for changes.<br>  I almost have an accurate count of how many stretch marks in my belly, i think of them as my honor marks, cuz i though i will never have them.<br>  every change, every new clothes that didn't fit me was like my gain, like my price. <br>  you have no idea what is to have something that you were told and you were convinced you will never ever have and you wanted with all your heart.<br>  Good luck and i can only say that you look Beautiful<br>  I even got a foto session for my belly and told them not to retouch my stretch marks in some of my pics so i can have a memory of them|`|5NZ41gDfaa	This is tough. Women are so picked on with the media. We have it ingrained into our heads what we should look like to be beautiful. And big and pregnant with stretch marks is not what we usually think of! Trust me though, you are beautiful. And the stretch marks will most certainly fade when you are all done. In the mean time, here is what I do when I am feeling fat and unattractive thanks to pregnancy: Take a really long hot shower, fix my hair up extra cute, put on by best pregnancy outfit and hit the town. Go to a fancy restaurant, or just a cheap one if it's all you can afford. Makes me feel better!|`|136cc7cc8b44dd28def339d808dac69faa	As a mom of 3 kids, I hear you!  I swelled up like a tick for all 3 of my pregnancies and I felt like a big balloon every time.  It feels like its never going to be over with, but it will.  Your body is your baby's for now, so the only thing you can do is try to do things to make yourself feel pretty the best way you can.<br>  <br>  Go to a maternity store and try on all styles to find out what feels comfortable and makes you feel the best you can.  The maternity styles are so cool now, they don't even look like mom-to-be clothes!  Believe me, when you get towards the end, you won't care too much about how stylish you are - comfort will be the key!<br>  <br>  Get your nails and your toes done - even if you can't see them :)  Get a new hairstyle or have your stylish give you a trim.  If you can afford it, have a professional do your make up and show you the best way to play up your features.<br>  <br>  Buy yourself some body lotion, splash and some nice smelling bath salts.  Lay back and soak in a warm bubble bath and then get yourself all pampered and powered and smelling yummy.<br>  <br>  And keep this in mind - no matter how icky or big or whatever you feel, in the end you're going to have a baby that is going completely change your life and yes, you will be able to get your body back!  Good luck... motherhood is the toughest job you'll ever love.|`|PtqweQVcaa	I must be the only one who is too tired to worry about her appearance.  You won't stay pregnant forever.  Just enjoy it while you can and you can worry about your appearance about 2 months PP.
ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	You could be if you are having unprotected sex. And even if he is pulling out before he cums there is always precum and that can still get you pregnant. You could be pregnant and are just getting some symptoms a bit early. There is only one way to find out and that is to take a test. If it is negative you may want to wait until you miss your period and then test. |`|GUDxwCmZaa	were you ovulating? I wouldnt worry till you miss a period. If you do take a test|`|ft2EmHFoaa	You could be pregnant. Symptoms like that can show up as early as three days after conception. Even if he didn't fully *** in you, pre-*** can get you pregnant. Wait a couple of weeks and take an hpt. Good luck.
f46ac79782011df203ccb9768414aec1aa	not trying to be rude here,but your 21 but sound like a teenager,at 21 you should really know about the birds and bees<br>  <br>  first sign of pregnancy missed period.but yours isnt due yet<br>  <br>  <br>  if in doubt take a test|`|n8vBnA9Iaa	Your period hasn't even started yet. <br>  And when you start believing that you may be pregnant, then your body will start responding to those thoughts. Phantom symptoms if you may. So stop thinking that you are pregnant and start thinking that your period is coming. Or dont even think about it.<br>  I haven't always taken my pills on time, have missed a few days, stuff like that and I have never gotten pregnant.<br>  <br>  So start thinking positive and worry if your period hasn't come for a week after the 12th.|`|Oc8e7wAXaa	Take a pregnancy test, it doesn't matter where it's from, it does matter how much it cost, it can cost $1 for all I'm concerned, They work trust me, I know, I took like 15 of them $1 ones..... If it comes out to be POSITIVE, then you are.... If it is NEGATIVE, that could mean 1 of 3 different things, 1) it could mean your not pregnant, obviously<br>  2) It could mean you took it too early<br>  Or<br>  3) It could be a FALSE NEGATIVE, They do happen...<br>  <br>  But if you really want to make sure, wait and see if you miss your period... but keep in mind that a small number of "pregnant" women can have up to 3 periods and still be pregnant, it is possible...|`|3JyQwbm3aa	If you are taking birth control correctly, you won't ovulate in most cases. If you haven't missed a pill, the chances of pregnancy are slim to none, especially if you are at a healthy weight and taking your pills as you should (same time every day, etc). <br>  <br>  chances are slim. It's possible but very unlikely.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	You could be pregnant. If you are due for a period on Sunday then you could probably take an early detection pregnancy test and see. If it is negative you can wait a week or two or even go and request a blood test just to be sure. Good luck!|`|fTS15DS7aa	if you are taking the birth control correctly then i doubt you are pregnant.|`|bQ39qEkCaa	if your on a birth control pill there is 99.5 % chance that you are not pregnant as long as you have been taking your pills as recommended. The point of the pill is to keep you from getting pregnant, and is technically more effective then a condom, the down side is it does not protect against STD's...<br>  <br>  with all that being said, i highly doubt you are pregnant weather or not he came inside of you.
RmopZbXWaa	Well, if you feel that stongly about it, make sure whoever father's this baby wants to be a Dad as much as you want to be a mom. <br>  <br>  But, I have a strong feeling that you just want a baby because you think its cute. Or maybe many of your friends are pregnant. Having a baby is something that must be thought out, for the baby's sake. Don't just get pregnant on this whim...|`|d3VV4b6vaa	they don't stay babies forever, remember. you have to grow with them just as they grow|`|IllWKAUGaa	I feel the EXACT same way as you, i'm 21 and i want a baby soooo bad, it just came up one day out of no where and i dont know why, i never felt like this before. I'm in school too, and I feel the same way, like i should finish college, get my career going and be married before i have a child...but i feel like it is going to take soooo long to do all that stuff first and i just want one now. i'm so passionate and so full of love, that i just want to share that love with someone. and my boyfriend and i dont use protection, but we pull out, and the past too much i find myself hoping i get pregnant, that my period wont show, and start thinking i have symptoms, and then i get my period, and it gets me soooooo upset and so dissapointed. I get wicked anxious and i just keep hoping it'll happen, even though we're not planning or trying for a baby. And even though I know i should wait until i complete all of those things first....but i reaaallllly dont want to wait that long, cuz it'll be a couple years, and those couple years feel like FOREVER!! and i want it NOW!!! i wish i could just subside these feelings for now, because it is driving me absolutely crazy and i dont know what to make of it!! So, I feel you girl, I'm right there with you!! Good Luck and I hope everything works out for you for the best!!!|`|f46ac79782011df203ccb9768414aec1aa	I know what its like to be broody,i have 2 young adults and a grandson and im still broody, your not as young as some being mothers,but seems you have a good head on your shoulders,but enjoy your life ,plenty time to have a baby,and it will be one spoilt special little baby to have a mum like you<br>  |`|B5MDTdtPaa	do you have your own house to bring up a child?<br>  do you have your own income that would finance raising a child?<br>  could you afford a child?<br>  <br>  if your living with your parents and dont have a well paid job and cant finance a baby then obviously do not try and have one as your not ready..<br>  <br>  you need to be emotionally and physically ready when planning having a child - dont let your emotions take over and be responsible|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Only you can make that decision but whoever you are having sex with should know that you are no longer taking birth control and trying to get pregnant. How are you doing financially? Can you financially take care of a baby? Do you have the means? You have to think about the child you would be bringing into the world as well. You need to make sure that you are going to be able to take care of them and give them everything they need. Good luck on your decision!|`|rP13MznFaa	I guess I would try to put myself in the child's shoes, if you were to have one. <br>  If you and your boyfriend might not be a forever thing, then how does life look for the child? Mom and Dad separated and/or divorced? That means there is always 2 families, always having to figure out if Christmas is going to be at Mom's or Dad's this year. <br>  How would the child be taken care of financially if you two didn't stay together? Would you then have to work instead of staying home and the baby have to go to childcare? If you were to be a single-Mom, how many hours each day would you actually get to see your child, if you have to go to work?<br>  I don't think it's ever an easy decision if or not you are truly ready to have a baby, but at 18 I tend to say, give it a little more time. Aren't there some things that you always wanted to do, like travel, or go bungee-jumping or whatever it is? At 18, that would be a great thing to do because you probably won't get to do them once you have a baby. I would focus on that, I'd make a list of all the amazing things you want to do, then maybe even set yourself a time frame like a year or two to go do them. Then cross them off as you do them, until you've done as many things as you can. And then start thinking about having a family again.<br>  Whatever you do, make sure you and your boyfriend agree on things. It would not be fair of you to stop taking birth control without talking to him first. It wouldn't be fair to the child either, because you "forcing" a pregnancy on your boyfriend could cause him to not want to be involved in the child's life, and kids need fathers!<br>  And remember, even if you want one, babies are not commodities or accessories, they are little people and we should consider their rights and needs, too. I'm sorry but I've seen too many teenage mothers that simply got pregnant because they thought they would want a baby or because all the celebrities were having babies etc., and then they live to regret it, and in any case, the child is really the one in the worst situation. Just really, really think about it. Maybe you have a friend who has a baby or you could take a babysitting job just to be reminded of day-to-day life with a baby. Ask them about the financial side of things, as a young babysitter you only knew about the "taking care of" part but not about the financial part of having and raising a child!|`|vSZ3ERvfaa	I'm 18 and preg and will give birth when I'm 19 and even I still think it's too young! I don't regret it because I'm learning to deal with my responsibilities but I'm pretty sure you'll appreciate it more if you wait and your settled down.  When it's meant to happen it will..don't try for it.|`|HpjqN8gsaa	if its what you really want then go for it! the only thing i dont get is you havent mentioned if you have a boyfriend or not so if you dont have one dont go and get your self pregnant, it would just be selfish. if you have a partner and he feels the same as you then whats the problem, you shouldnt be wondering what other people might say if it really what you want
ygVTtSNVaa	no its way to early for that. I had an ultrasound at 12 weeks and saw the heartbeat.. But you usually cant see the heartbeat til at least 8 weeks with thinner women. 6 weeks if your lucky and heavier supposibly. Best of luck and congratulations!! :)|`|bvX8ycVzaa	21 weeks was the first time i saw the baby's heartbeat. I had an ultrasound at 8 weeks and the tech told me she couldn't show it yet because the baby is to small and not fully developed yet. Don't worry so much yet Hun. Worry and stress aren't good for you or the baby. Some people can't even hear the heartbeat till the baby is 18 weeks and as long as you take good care of yourself you should be fine.|`|MtC3CWZraa	God, you’re at least the third person today whose u/s tech couldn’t be bothered to explain to you that nothing can really be determined at this stage. Would it kill them not to freak you out???<br>  <br>  What she meant to say was “At this stage, I really can’t see anything. That doesn’t mean anything is wrong, just that there’s not much to see.”<br>  |`|6d6GHChPaa	They say about 8-9 weeks you can see a flicker that is a heartbeat on the ultrasound but about 10 weeks you can hear it with the doppler. Don't freak out, it is way to early to worry. Just wait a few more weeks and when it is time I am sure you will be able to hear the heartbeat.|`|7rKUmK0qaa	i heard my babys heart beat around 6 wks and saw the heart,too. It was fluttering really fast. Since your still 5 wks its still early. Wait till 7-8 wks and if theres no heartbeat then, im sorry for your loss. But again anything is possible and things happen for a reason. <br>  Goodluck to you and hope everything turns out fine.|`|e8HCEZDpaa	They didn't even do an ultrasound until 8 weeks for me. It's too early to see the heartbeat yet. I wouldn't worry. |`|f46ac79782011df203ccb9768414aec1aa	dont panic hun everything is fine,don't usually see the flutter of the heartbeat till around 6 weeks<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  this may help<br>  Week Five<br>  First heartbeats begin - If you have an early ultrasound you may not be able to recognize this tiny being as a baby, but there is no mistaking what it feels like seeing your child's heartbeat on that screen. That rhythmic beat is echoed in your own heart. <br>  Umbilical cord develops - This is your baby's lifeline in utero. It bears the responsibility of pumping in oxygen, removing waste, and supplying the necessary nutrients for the remainder of your pregnancy. <br>  Blood is now pumping - All four heart chambers are now functioning, insuring your baby's body will receive all it needs over not only the remainder of your pregnancy but throughout life. <br>  Most other organs begin to develop - Your infant's lungs start to appear, along with her brain. Already your little one is preparing for a quest for lifelong learning! <br>  Arm and leg buds appear - While they may not appear to be much at this stage it is ok to dream of the future. Just imagine your ballerina twirling and jumping around your kitchen floor. Or perhaps you will have the precocious boy that throws the perfect pitch -- right through the neighbor's window. <br>  |`|AA11061445	you are fine the gestational sac appears at 4 weeks the yolk sac at 5 weeks and the fetal pole and heart beat at 6 weeks,<br>  the nurse that saw you wants shooting scaring you like that,<br>  you have a yolk sac at the right amount of weeks wait another week and there will be bubs with a heart beat<br>  <br>  i saw my baby's heart beat at 5 weeks 6 days im now 16 weeks|`|ErCJnABBaa	It's too early to expect to see the heart beat.<br>  <br>  It's normally some time between the 5th and 6th week that the heart starts forming and beings pumping.  Give it another week before you can expect to see the first signs of a heart beat.<br>  <br>  (Note Link is what happens during the 5th week, so if you are 5 weeks now, then your 5th week is just beginning).|`|EpfVsCa2aa	your to early, quit freaking out over nothing, the baby is still forming, i didnt hear a heartbeat till i was like 13 weeks, might be sooner, but thats when i heard my sons, so stop freaking out over nothing, its all ok|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Don't freak out yet.

It will feel excruciating pain and you will regret it sooner or later in life. You may/may not become infertile after the abortion. Read the Catechism of the Catholic church and what it says about abortion. Talk to a good, Catholic priest; look up St. Gianna Molla. She died during childbirth in order to give her daughter life, even though her doctor wanted her to get an abortion (she had a life-threatening condition). There's lots more to say, but please refer to my suggestions, even if you aren't religious. If you still aren't convinced of the immorality of abortion, take a look at pictures of aborted babies.

Good luck!|`|x6IyESABaa	You could try doing a blood test for hormone HCG.|`|uMUUObViaa	faint line or dark line means your pregnant wait a few days and do another. <br>  you could be pregant i had periods for the 1st 3 mnths of pregnancy. go see your gp!!!!
geNT36PWaa	me to lol!! mine is on my left!! i think she's just lay to one side!! please don't worry we'll both be fine! those ickle people have lots of growing to do and our bellies have to accomodate them!!xx|`|rmmc4D56aa	Round ligaments feel like sharp pains that go away quickly or they can feel like a dull ache that last for a while. if you ever stand up fast and you get a sharp stabbing pain that goes away real quickly thats round ligament. it just feels like muscles stretching... cause thats what it is.<br>  <br>  If you are worried though then see your Dr<br>  <br>  Congratulations on the baby btw<br>  =]|`|7W8ihXA4aa	It sounds like ligament pain to me.  I get it really bad if my baby is lying on the right hand size of my uterus and i try everything to get her to move.  |`|ftRkpq8Maa	I had this on both my pregnancies too and was told it was growing/ligament pain.  However, telephone your midwife and get checked over just to be on the safe side and to put your mind at rest.|`|WR16SVU9aa	As the others have said it sounds like ligament pain, try not too worry! Just relax but if you think its something else go to the doctor.<br>  :)|`|PenTuGHaaa	please seek medical advice fm a gyneachologist asap...dont guess...|`|iiFHvhAmaa	hey there ive been in that situation its normal....just try to rub it and just have a rest dont do anything that might hurt u!!congrats!|`|18PnBZaEaa	don't think you have anything to worry about.. im 5 month to and also get this pain a lot its you ligaments stretching at this stage for next few weeks our baby is away to double in size.. so body making room for it.. i was told if it becomes unbearable get it checked out.. good luck and congrats|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I had this exact problem the other day and when I called the doctor they told me it's because my belly stretching and pulling a ligament in my back and that is the pain I felt. The nurse told me that if my entire belly got hard then I needed to go to the Emergency Room. Good luck!|`|7mfcFnaEaa	this type of thing is best dealt with by the doctors.....but i would say its probably just the way the baby is lying.......maybe on an organ or its foot pressed against sommit.  generally if there is something major wrong you cannot miss it, there is usually signs (discharges etc)<br>  <br>  But i must stress i am not a doctor and you should be phoning them to see what the best course of action is.......this is your baby, if you think something is wrong get your *** down to the surgery and ask :)|`|MmbEk1bTaa	probably some ligament pain, all that stretching:-) Any pain that seems too severe, a fever over 100.4, vomiting or just a "change" in how you feel should be reported to the dr. I think you should be fine but it never hurts to get checked:-) GOD BLESS!!!|`|w6KRRJOsaa	Five months, your uterus is still streching for the growing baby and that is why your feeling the pain....I wouldn't be concerned, if you are..you should make a appointment w/ the doctor to get a ultrasound..|`|G3pRM40raa	I think u should b fine u r past 12 weeks.. Just your womb strecthing chick!!
AP3XIQLYaa	Some woman eat a lot and get moody|`|x6IyESABaa	I have cravings for food, swollen breast, very forgetful and morning sickness<br>  <a href="http://americanpregnancy.org/gettingpregnant/earlypregnancysymptoms.html" rel="nofollow">http://americanpregnancy.org/gettingpreg...</a>|`|0Ae1tqZpaa	usualy sore breast"s!|`|OzkAqC3Saa	Eating more foods, lighter periods, morning sickness, mood changes, going to the bathroom more, a hard abdomen, and swollen breast are usually signs people notice when they are pregnant. Then they take a pregnancy test :)|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I think my first sign was probably my breasts being tender and being nauseous was another one. Everyone is different though.|`|XswhBhqlaa	It is different for every woman, but my face always broke out and I became way moody.  And with my first, my boobs got really swollen and hurt.|`|j5aLd4CIaa	Believe it or not but thrush is very common in early pregnancy. Women also find themselves needing to pee more than usual for the first few weeks and then it calms down until the later stage of pregnancy when you need to pee constantly because the baby is pushing down on the bladder! And the obvious sign is the morning sickness which you may or may not get but it can occur very early on.<br>  As for having to be close to the date of your normal period to take a test... I took my pregnancy test two weeks after my period and it was positive.<br>  <br>  :-)|`|KSJr0tU4aa	Well I had a very light bleed that lasted a week before my period was due so I didnt think anything of it, until it stopped and I still felt like little pully cramps all the time.. That's when it crossed my mind that I might be pregnant and was. It takes around the time your period is due to have a positive test.
kAuQugVKaa	You have big problems with your health....... go to doctor ASAP|`|SgdX2G8Qaa	Menstrual cycles are different in each and every female.  You could just have an irregular cycle.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, a home pregnancy test is usually as good as the urine strip done at a doctor's office.  Instead of doing this kind of test, ask your General Practitioner to do a blood test - which will show your hCg levels on a bracket scale.  This bracket will be a sure-fire way of knowing if you're pregnant, and if so-- just how far along you are.  Doctors are the best way to go... not EPT.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|7044ecc379ee487d11ad752578ed77f1aa	Chances are 50-50. I would definately book an appt wih your docor right away. If they do a test and it comes back negative they will probably send you for blood tests to be sure.<br>  If you truly are pregnant, reasons for a negative pregnancy test could be an ectopic pregnancy (egg attached in the fallopian tube) in which case you will have to get an abortion :( But keep in mind that is highly unlikely.<br>  You could also just be really irregular, too stressed out or other hormonal problems.<br>  Take it easy and see your doctor!|`|yQWnMSc6aa	It could but with negative pregnancy tests it is likely something else. So many things can cause a missed period - from stress to hormonal imbalances. A few months before I got pregnant I had missed my period for 3 months - turns out I had an elevated level of my hormone prolactin - when I corrected that my period came back.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It could just be your hormones all messed up. If you are so concerend go see a doctor..|`|mZjdxuweaa	It could be stress....|`|jD4Uiredaa	this happened to me.. go see the doctor.. If oyu are on the pill it could be that it is too strong and your estrogen levels are too low, which means you wont get a period but will show negative pregnancy tests. |`|6e7bd0397fbc299e19ed50ffe89b2d71aa	There could be a multitude of reasons that your period is delayed so much besides pregnancy. You need to speak with a doctor and find out whats going on.
DD3pR6oJaa	i took 7 tests with very faint positives and 3 with negatives, all in the same day. and guess what? i am 8 months pregnant now! congrats! buy a digital test to be sure! but congrats, because i think u are!|`|AA11151053	you are pregnant girl! :)  check out the directions - they say a lot of times the second line will be realllly faint - but if it's there - you are pregnant.<br>  <br>  congrats mommy! :)  good luck! :)  |`|0LwBdwAPaa	when you take those tests apt they all have a line, so i would call the doctor to confirm with blood test, or get another test to say if pregnant or not...|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Even if it is faint it's still postive so CONGRATS! Good luck|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	I had 5 pos test 4 of which were very faint!!  the last one i took was clearly pos!  And I had a blood test!  I would wait a week for a blood test though if you are getting faint ones because i had to have it done twice in a week because my first came up undecided!! But I knew i was wait to take a blood test but you could try another test with first morning urine but it never mattered with my test what time of the day i tested i always got the same answer...|`|Axcy1DYlaa	Mine was also faint and I'm 16wks pregnant! Another clue for me was.. i did not have to wait the 2 minutes for the test results to appear. mine appeared almost instantly. I'd say that you are, but you could always check with your doctor! <br>  <br>  Good luck and hopefully congrats!  :)|`|YVWlAvqEaa	Honestly, if there's a very faint line that keeps you guessing, I would go out and get a digital test. This way there's not a doubt in your mind when the results com up. I would just wait to take it until tomorrow morning with your first pee.|`|Xc02z608aa	I've always been told that false positives are very rare.  I've been told that any sign of a positive, no matter how faint means that you are pregnant.  I've never used Accu Clear, I used clear blue though.|`|qygYwdRpaa	Hi even the faintest line is positive so congratulations!! i also had faint lines so faint you had to stare at it early pregnancy is the reason say around 3-4 weeks<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	the general rule with test is any line no matter how faint is a positive so maybe go buy a dif brand just to put ur mind at rest<br>  1 maybe wrong but i doubt 3 would be<br>  <br>  if it were me id say defo pregnant x
sC0NvRzEaa	Congratulations!!! I am too! and i found out friday, I took my husband out for dinner and put the pregnancy test in on of those long gift boxes and put it in a little gift bag, and said, "I have a present for you!!" He tried to guess, but didnt even get close to what it was LOL. <br>  We are both sooo happy!|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	just wanted to say congratulations im sure however you tell hubby hes gonna be over the moon<br>  ithought of all nice ways to tell mine when he walked in i just cried so much he couldnt understand what i was saying!<br>  tears of joy :-D|`|VnLaUS3Jaa	if they will allow you, ask permission at his place of work to decorate his break area with pink and blue balloons with a banner saying "congrats daddy (his name)!" and put one of the balloons under your shirt when you greet him |`|b6NhNXWMaa	Congratulations... When I found out I was pregnant we weren't really trying or really expecting it to happen, long story why... But when he got home I took him into the bathroom with me and just told him I have a feeling about this. He kinda looked at me like I was nuts, I took the test, not my first one, but he didn't know that at the time. I covered the test up with a paper towel and then we waited as the minutes passed. When it was time he took the paper towel off and there it said we were pregnant. I loved the look on his face, he was so happy and just pure joy and excitement... Have fun and good luck. =) |`|AA10754660	put a bun in the oven with a yellow or green bow around it and when he gets home ask him to look in the oven...(bun in the oven)<br>  <br>  buy a pair of booties and put them beside the front door beside his shoes and your shoes :)<br>  <br>  go to A&W and buy him a papa burger ...i love that one!<br>  <br>  bake a cake and write in icing something cute that your baby would say to him<br>  |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	oh that is so awesome. CONGRATS!! I can't really help with how to tell your husband because mine was there with me when I tested. Sorry|`|Eb1gt231aa	CONGRATULATIONS! If you are planning this for a while just hold him tight, give him a kiss and look into his eyes.he will understand.If not call him daddy! 
nzGdMWbZaa	For more accurate results wait a week after your missed period.  I am sending baby dust your way:)|`|jQDeTTVhaa	at least 2wks|`|Io28z8l2aa	a few days before your period is due, or when you miss your period. use your morning urine, better chance of accurate results that way. <br>  <br>  you can get early testing kits so try using one of them.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I would wait until you miss your period or a week before you're suppose to get your period. Good luck and I hope that you are. |`|bUQvPtaTaa	i think you need to wait until at least ur period was due. good luck|`|ojpPFovZaa	from the day your period is due
lQORNmNiaa	I would just tell her that you've missed a period.  If she asks if you could be pregnant, tell her that you've taken tests, but they are negative.  Offer a little information and if she asks questions, answer them honestly.  Good luck.|`|cN4553a1aa	Just call and say you need an appointment to see the doctor.  I don't recall a doctors office asking me why or for what reason I needed to come in. If they do just say that its a personal matter or if pressed state that its regarding your menstrual cycle.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Just tell them that your period is very late and you don't know what is causing it and wonder if there is anyway they can check you out. If you have had unprotected sex then let them know that there is a chance that you may be pregnant. Good luck|`|aEpN5FuJaa	tell them you're late on your period but all your test were negative and ask if you can get a better test. they'll most likely do a blood test then if all the sticks have said negative. but you should call your doctor asap cuz something could be wrong. good luck!|`|T8BrBFgKaa	Tell her you  need to see your doctor asap--if she asks why keep it short and sweet and say something like i just need a pregnancy test..then when you go to the doctor explain the rest to the dr..|`|LeNeinDUaa	call the docs and ask to make an appt with your doctor. If she asks what it is for say you are 3 weeks late for your period but all tests are neg. <br>  That's all. If she wants more info she will ask.|`|X83LVP6Iaa	Tell the receptionist you need to make an appointment with your doctor for possible pregnancy. Plain and simple. |`|arJqnL4saa	Tell her you need to get some blood tests done.|`|oojO4WAraa	Say "This is (your name) and I am a patient of Dr. (name).  I need to make an appointment to come in and see the doctor."  The receptionist will handle it from there.  She might ask what you want to see the doctor about, in that case, tell her.<br>  <br>  If you are not a patient already then you say "I am a new patient and would like to make an appoint with Dr. (name)".  <br>  <br>  You can chat with the receptionist and tell her what is going on, but you don't have to unless she asks. Some times they ask "What are you needing to see the doctor about?" |`|ByUS0k8waa	Just ask to make a appointment and when she ask why then just tell her you have missed your period and yeah its possible that you are pregnant. She will more than likely ask you if you have taken a home test just tell her yes but that it was negative. Good luck! |`|Mya70dtIaa	You can tell her whatever you want to... you haven't had your period, you need a pregnancy test, or just that you're having a very irregular period.<br>  <br>  Just remember part of the reason they ask is because they need to know so that they can get you an early appointment (if its urgent), or relay some information to the doctor/nurse to decide if you even need an appointment.|`|9bUN1AHFaa	You shouldn't have to tell her anything.  If she asks just tell her you are having menstrual problems or something.  I don't think they really need to know anyway.  I never get asked when I make a appointment.  |`|Drr89BVmaa	You do not tell anything to the receptionist. Just make the appointment and then tell all your concerns to the doctor. Good luck|`|SfymamWtaa	tell them you would like to have a preganacy test and the date of your lmp
yQWnMSc6aa	My insurance company did. I switched when I was about 25 weeks. I have Blue Cross Blue Shield. Some insurance companies will cover it, some will not. It also depends on the specific plan. You should call some insurance companies and ask their stance.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Get medicaid. It covers everything and if you're pregnant chances are you are covered. Just contact your local assistance office and actually you can probably go online and fill out the application. It's better than any other insurance
KozVaTvVaa	Yes, you can test now, try first response early detection, however, it took my pregnancies weeks to show up in a HPT. Remember that the best time to get pregnant is 14 days after the 1st day of your last period. Getting a ovulation predicter test helps greatly, then you will know exactly when you are ovulating. Blood tests are the best, but, have heard that 1st response is very good, too. Good Luck, and best wishes..........Isabella|`|89b9b79c918cf6555bea31d3d7be7d94aa	as long as the Hcg (pregnancy hormone) in your urine is strong enough then any early pregnancy test should work. i tested 6 days early with my daughter and used a cheap test, however some recommend tests are first response, and ept |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	If you want to test before your missed period then I would try First Response. It says right on the box that you can use it 5 days before your missed period. If it is negative though I would wait 2-3 weeks and test again. Good luck|`|B8v9hAfvaa	there are plenty of tests on shelves that can give you a response in advance. One of them is First Response.<br>  these never worked for me. Tests were always negative until i was 3 weeks pregnant.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|sC0NvRzEaa	Try clear blu, its easy because it says pregnant or not pregnant.<br>  Good Luck!|`|kizwXlURaa	clear blue deffo.<br>  it can detect pregnancy from 4 days b4 ur missed period. <br>  good luck :) xx|`|EZ0ksSdYaa	An HPT is only 90% effective the day of a missed period.  If you can wait at least a week, if you are pregnant, the HCG levels in your urine will be much higher then so you will get a much more accurate result.  Yes, the 5 days early one claim they can detect small amounts of the hormone, but usually they cannot.  If you can stand the wait, you are better off.  Good Luck!|`|4F6b5OGOaa	It's best to try a couple tests, even some that aren't the same test.  But remember that they're not 100% right, and they can give you a false negative OR false positive so keep watching, and you may want to think about using ovulation tests to be most effective so you know what's going on inside your body|`|FTPk2Cdpaa	I'm due the same day as you to start.  I'm going today to the dollar tree to get some tests and start testing every other day starting tomorrow.  With my last pregnancy, I got a positive the day before my missed period with one of those dollar tree tests.  Good luck!  |`|KlJHZRSiaa	Actually, the tests they sell at Dollar Tree are really reliable and you can get them for $1 each which means it won't cost a fortune to test every day if you like :) They are sensitive to 25mIU/hCG which is exactly the same as First Response!|`|WgA2auAQaa	Sure you can. I'd buy a two pack though because it also might be too early to tell. It helps to know when you ovulated, because you should wait until 14 dpo (days past ovulation) to test.|`|aQ4SNA0faa	No there is no point now... you ahve to wait at least 10 days... take the online ovulation test ....... it is not the most accurate but it will give you an idea!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.babyhopes.com/pages.php?pageid=23" rel="nofollow">http://www.babyhopes.com/pages.php?pagei...</a><br>  <br>  |`|ZOIcy74waa	Wait for at least a day after your missed period for an accurate result. you can ask for the test in a pharmacy and they would give you one.  |`|s5bx5O26aa	it is better on your period becayse then you will be defident because your eggs are all ready
ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Oh my gosh. That is just amazing. I'm glad they are able to do stuff like that. 
gxRaYtv8aa	Sounds like you pregnant!  Congrats!|`|vpL67nETaa	There are 2 known things that could cause fale positives (besides an early miscarriage)<br>  <br>  <br>  - being very exposed to rat droppings (there was a thing about this on Discovery Health)<br>  <br>  -certain methodone replacement drugs, like Suboxone, used to wean addicts off of heroin (found this out when I friend of mine got a positive result, we did a lot of research, and went to the Dr.)<br>  <br>  <br>  However, I doubt thats your case.

Sometimes one pregnancy test will not tell you about this.|`|yIdgG8b1aa	Take another test with your first wee of the morning (when the pregnancy hormone is at its strongest) in 7 days. |`|sINAaRudaa	Take another in about a week
LMkj8D8eaa	Hi There!<br>  <br>  The first visit usually consists of talking to the doctor/nurse about pregnancy, and they answer questions you may have. They normally give you a "what to expect when you're expecting", type of book. It's just a book that'll answer a lot of your questions you may have about pregnancy...a great book to refer to.<br>  <br>  Another thing is from this point forward, they will keep track of your weight/belly measurements etc.<br>  <br>  and since this is your first visit, usually they do an internal ultrasound, because the baby's so small, it's hard to detect the heartbeat from an external ultrasound... But that maybe different for you, since you're past your first trimester. Normally people make their first prenatal appointment around 6-8 weeks when they find out they're pregnant.<br>  <br>  Either way, you'll be getting an ultrasound, and/or a doppler check of our baby's heart beat.<br>  <br>  It's also easier to find the exact/closest to due date earlier as possible in pregnancy, i'm not really sure on why, thats just what i remember my doctor telling me when i was pregnant.<br>  <br>  usually the 18th-20th week is when they have you schedule an appointment to find out the gender. ---but depending on how big your measuring, you may be farther ahead than you think.<br>  <br>  now, is this regular or gestational weeks were talking about?, because depending on how your caluculating, you may be actuaclly 16 weeks along, or 12 weeks along...<br>  <br>  also, i'd like to recommend a site for pregnant mommies, www.i-am-pregnant.com, its a site that you can talk to other preggo mommies on, that are in your same week as you, in pregnancy, who help share there advice and tell things that there feeling, etc etc.<br>  <br>  <br>  This is the definition of Gestational Age, if I have you confused.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational...</a><br>  <br>  this is a gestational calculator, which can help u pinpoint your due date easier<br>  <br>  <a href="http://members.cox.net/david.kutzler/CalculateEGA.htm" rel="nofollow">http://members.cox.net/david.kutzler/Cal...</a><br>  <br>  SOME OF THE THINGS TO EXPECT WHEN YOU ARE PREGNANT<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mjbovo.com/pregexpect.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mjbovo.com/pregexpect.htm</a><br>  <br>  Newly Pregnant<br>  <br>  <a href="http://pregnancy.about.com/od/newlypregnant/Newly_Pregnant.htm" rel="nofollow">http://pregnancy.about.com/od/newlypregn...</a><br>  <br>  good luck and congrats!|`|tZU9k9zNaa	<br>  No it's too early to know the sex and if they try to guess, it will not be very accurate.I dont even think they're allowed to guess.You must wait for the 20 week ultrasound if you get one.<br>  <br>  First visit expect:<br>  -Blood test for HIV (with your permission) and other diseases.<br>  -PPD test for Tuberculosis<br>  -Pap Smear(Not painful but not pleasant neither!)<br>  -Weight Checked<br>  -Given Expected Due date<br>  -See a social worker and Nutritionist( if you go to a hospital..dont know the procedure for clinics)<br>  -Urine test<br>  -Speak to you about pregnancy<br>  -Might get a Ultrasound if the Dr. has one in his/her office but if not,you will definately be scheduled for one.<br>  <br>  Good luck! This is the longest and worst appointment.After its going to be a breeze!|`|5OQLmECTaa	very doubtful they would be able to find out the sex of the baby that early, they usually start around 20 weeks to see that.  if they were gonna do an ultra sound you would already know about it, b/c they usually tell you in advance b/c people like to bring loved ones and family members to watch.  they should however try to find the heart beat if they cannot find one they may do an ultra sound to make sure everything is alright.  Good Luck and Congrats!|`|XHeiEgF1aa	Yes, my sister found out at 14 weeks and 6 days she was having a boy. Though they will confirm it later. Because I also knew someone who found out at 15 weeks 2 days, that it was a 'girl' but at the 20 week it turned out to be a 'boy'. <br>  <br>  If they say boy, it's probably a boy, but if they said girl... I would wait to confirm before buying and telling people.|`|T9SgqPyhaa	With my first I had my first doctors appointment at 16 weeks.  So this first visit they will take your medical history and get info about the baby's father just in case there are conditions that need to be looked for.  The doctor will come in and see you, they will do a pap smear and swab to check for infections.  And you will get to hear baby's heartbeat!  Depending on your doctor she may do an ultrasound, but most likely you will be scheduled to come back for it cuz you need a full bladder.  And they will draw blood to check blood type, infections, anemia, they might do a AFP (blood test) etc.  You can ask your doc what all they will be checking for.  You will get a script for prenatal vitamins, possibly iron and calcium depending on your docs preference.  And you will be told to make an appointment to come back in 4 weeks.  ALSO, most likely not, 15 weeks is a little early to tell gender, BUT most doctors do an anatomy scan at 20 weeks which is the perfect time to do a gender check!  Good luck to you and enjoy the pregnancy! |`|PNPg9Ytkaa	at the first visit they will take blood, urine samples, and do a pap smear.. I had to make an appointment for a later day for my first ultrasound but I think every OB office might be different... at 15 weeks you would JUST be able to tell the sex of the baby but Its normally more accurate if you would wait until 18-20 weeks Congrats |`|cqbLD5Graa	At 14 weeks you should of already of seen a doctor and had a 13 wk scan. Your doctor should refer to get a scan asap.The doctor will not beable to determine the sex until your next scan at 20 wks. good luck!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	They usually don't do one on the first visit unless you don't know how far along you are. I don't think they try to do an ultrasound until around 20 weeks. |`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	I've been to two different practices with my pregnancies and both are very similar - fetal doppler can detect the heartbeat at 12 weeks (which you're past) and a routine U/S at 20 weeks. Some docs do ultrasounds early and throughout the pregnancy, which I don't understand - unless there are complications. <br>  <br>  You would be able to see a heartbeat at this point on the u/s, no problem. I had one at 12 weeks for bleeding and they could definitely see it then. Also, depending on the quality of the machine, you *could* theoretically be able to detect sex at around 16 weeks - with my first we could easily see it at this point but I was at the hospital - their machines might be 'better' or more sensitive than the doctor's office. |`|x6IyESABaa	Doctor can estimate your due date from your ultrasound. On the first visit, doctor will ask about you and your husband medical history. The doctor might do some blood test for you.<br>  <br>  You can view my baby's ultrasound and video at<br>  <a href="http://joanna-shawn.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://joanna-shawn.blogspot.com/</a><br>  
3hp95dCbaa	The timing of intercourse is the most important part, not really position.  You typically ovulate around 14 days after you period started so you want to have sex during fertile days. (the days before you ov).|`|3fk6bTMxaa	Any position is fine. Orgasm if you like or just use your kegel muscles to further draw sperm up. Make use of the pre-ejaculate during sexual intimacy. Get up to urinate after sexual intimacy so that you don't get a uti which can interfere with pregnancy. Best, G<br>  <br>  If your cycle is exactly 28 days you will most likely begin to ovulate 14 days after the first day of your last period. So the 5 days before you ovulate and the three days of ovulation are your 8 fertile days. Circle the 14th day after your period on the calendar, and also mark in the 5 days before and the 2 days after to locate your personal ovulation pattern. Check for clear discharge during these days...more on the site below.|`|b6461d8a8d3d34ce5dac5c4052085372aa	Position has little to do with it! Timing is everything!|`|4xSZZQgnaa	I always heard missionary was the best to get a girl pregnant.. <br>  <br>  <br>  Best Time To Get Pregnant - Selecting The Best Time To Get Pregnant<br>  <a href="http://www.pregnancy-period.com/best_time_to_get_pregnant.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pregnancy-period.com/best_tim...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Just don't trap some poor guy into having a baby he may not want, far as that goes don't have a baby with a guy who is not going to help take care of the child...|`|Lifu8nCRaa	I dont know about the ovulation, but I am 38 weeks pregnant now. Me and my husband were in missionary position when i got pregnant. Just make sure you both are...you know...the better your O, the better your chances I think.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Most of the time they will tell you to have sex in the missionary position so that it's easier for the sperm to reach your egg. 
DzHOggxsaa	Read my answers lookup.. I have something wrote about teen moms. =]|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	I don't guess I would say it was wrong...You are a teen still silly until you turn 20 lol!   Tell your mom!!  You are going to need to get on some vitamins if you have a supportive BF and family I don't see a reason you couldn't have this baby you can still get your education with a child but it will be harder to get up in the mornings and go to school with the morning sickness wish you the best of luck and the happiest life anyone can have congrats on your little one!|`|aLAmvX5Naa	You are an adult. You will have a hs diploma. You have the freedom to control your life.<br>  <br>  If you don't feel ready for a baby you have time to think about it. Get on some prenatals and sit down and talk with your boyfriend and your family. Do you want to raise this child? Can they help you? You can always give your child up for adoption if you decide you can't handle a baby right now.<br>  <br>  You can do this. :)|`|T48smu01aa	If you know you can be a great mother, then things will fall into place as they need to. If you are mature enough then you can be ready! Back in the old days girls were getting pregnant at 14 and 16 and they managed, just be healthy! If you really don't think you can do it put the baby up for adoption. But I believe your mom should be supportive and knows what its like and she probably knows she has a responsible daughter who can raise a kid and she will help you.....My mom had her first baby at 15 and she did a wonderful job! It honestly depends on you....Just finish school :) I am terrified to be a mommy and I am 21, your not alone most woman do get terrified. Its up to you hun you are the only one that can make a decision like that. I believe you can be a good mom if you believe in yourself.....GOOD LUCK AND BEST OF WISHES TO YOU!  and see a doctor and take some prenatal vitamins. <br>  :)  |`|WB4NpcX3aa	I don't think that its really wrong but your body hasn't gone through full development so it's probably not very good and then you have to miss so many things then because your pregnant at such a young age and like it's not healthy and it's not a good age to start committing to such responsibilities |`|pqqKLCmwaa	  It is not wrong per se, maybe irresponsible. It would be wrong to have a baby , and not take  care of it adequately. Most mistakes , we can change in life. The only ones we can't are creating a new life, or destroying one . Neither can be undone.|`|iwYu32N2aa	I know how you feel. Im also 18 and just out of high school and 9 wks prego. As far as knowing if your ready to have a baby, I dont think anyone really knows if there ready..<br>   best of luck to you |`|KdqaGnlwaa	Right or Wrong they are both opinions. We can not tell you you did wrong or you did right, because it was your decision.  Unfortunately sometimes we don't think of the consequences. As long as you and your boyfriend accepted it and have taken responsibility, thats all that matters.  The fact that your boyfriend is happy about it is a good sign, at least he didn't take off running.  Now about telling your mom, the sooner the better.  Regardless of she may think or may say, you still have to tell her because she is going to obviously find out.  Just remember, you have someone else other than yourself to worry about and take care of.  It will be hard, but that's life.  Good luck to you.  |`|xuGwAlksaa	no no no....it's not really wrong....but i don't blame you for bein a lil nervous.... i got a pregnancy scare a coupl of months ago(i wish my boyfriend was as open to idea as yours..your lucky...mine freaked!!) and i too am about to be 18 and i'll be graduatin in May :-) C/O 09 :-) yeah baby!!!......ok sorrry...off topic....anyways.....it seems lik you and yo guy love each other and are happy so havin a life that yall share seems not to sound too bad......but if set your mind to what you wanna do and you do your best your gonnna be a great mom!!! don't let what others say get you down or discourage you.....jus laugh at em and prove to them your gonna make it....it will be tough...but what don't kill us makes us stronger....good luck darlin!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ****i'm proud of you for not "eliminatin the problem"......if were grown enough to do the deed we have to be mature and grown enough to take responsibility and consequences for our actions............. but i do believe yall's baby is a blessin and this will make yalls life even sweeter<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  much love,<br>  RoBo |`|aKiynqA6aa	i know how you feel i was 17 when i got pregnant with my first.  it is scary, but it will be fine.  i turned 18 in may and graduated high school in may, i had the baby in september.  the next september i started college.  i went for 5 years,  in august of my last year i had anohter baby.  now i'm having baby #3!|`|QpVldQc5aa	I turned 18 last month. I found out yesterday that im pregnant thing #2. Crazy i know. You have every right to be scared. But just look at it the way i do. whether  you are 18 or 80 until you are a mum you don't know how to do it. It all come natural. You sound like you will have good support. Just tell your mum in anyways you feel you can. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps and Congratulations!|`|QlN0XWxiaa	hey i think its best you tell your mum as soon as possible she can help you through it and help you decide whats best for you and the unborn baby. But also include ur boyfriend in this all if he is left out in the dark then it isnt fair on him good luck |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	If you are not ready to be a mother than you should really think about placing it up for adoption. There are tons of couples that can't have children of their own and would love to adopt. Don't have an abortion though. |`|ts0g33Apaa	You can always place it up for adoption. You can do an open one so you can visit your baby get pictures and letters. Talk to your mom she might be disappointed but she will help and support you. good luck.|`|UxrSFPoPaa	congradulations<br>  theres nothing wrong wit it ur an adult|`|EpF6BT1Raa	the biggest thing is look at everything and costs and what you want for your future. Babies are expensive and a lot of work and bad things happen when people aren't ready... so think of all of that first and if you feel good about it then you know you can do it... <br>  <br>  but if you feel maybe you cant there is always adoption and just because you get information on it doesn't mean your committing to it so if you have doubts there is nothing wrong with being well informed.<br>  <br>  I hope everything works out for the best, I wish you the best of luck.|`|37dab5663389d7a1f34cbddd0a2bdab0aa	I don't think you can call bringing another life into this world 'wrong'.<br>  <br>  Do I think it's the optimal situation to be in when you're still in high school? No, but I don't think being pregnant with a baby is wrong.<br>  <br>  I'm sure your mom will be upset, because she probably had wanted things to turn out differently for you, but I'm sure she'll understand after some time. <br>  <br>  Since you're 18, you're old enough to take full responsibility. What really bothers me the most is when I see 12, 13, and 14 year olds getting pregnant - I really wonder where their parents were!?! <br>  <br>  Good luck and congrats!|`|NtcezzKEaa	Being young makes it hard but if your mom understands (like i hope she will) then you just need support to make it through the rough times.. My friend had 2 children before her 18th birthday the first was only 11 mths when the 2nd was born.. unfortunately her adoptive parents kicked her out and she lived with the baby's father.. he wasnt a very good guy at all.. but she finally found her real mom and moved in with her.. she is now 20 and has made her way thru getting her GED and College.. works at a law firm and has a cosmetology degree.. so i think you can make it as long as you have support.. you are very lucky that your baby's father has stepped up to the plate.. good luck in everything you do!|`|upINlSfnaa	I had my son at 18, I had to drop out of school, as I was 17 when I got pregnant.... all I had was my mom, she helped me so much.<br>  <br>  I am now 20, fixing to get my GED, and am a stay at home mom, by choice. I have a great hubby, not the biological father of my son, but in everyother way he is my son's father and wants to take full parental rights for him as the sperm donor is not in the picture nor will he be, he was abusive (I thought I had found love).<br>  <br>  You can do this if you want to, I was a single parent for the most part of my son's life..... it was difficult but if I can do it alone, you and your boyfriend can definitely do it.<br>  <br>  Good Luck and best wishes for a safe and happy pregnancy, and life. |`|9eb01a7c8f7e7912615a1f971f574fefaa	It's wrong because you're not ready to start you own family. You risk not only your future but the child's as well. However, it's also wrong to abort the baby. Abortion is murder. Tell your parents about your situation. I'm sure they'll understand and help you get through the situation you're in. And please, take care of yourself and the baby.|`|DfqKi1M4aa	 Everyone makes mistakes. Although it probably isnt in your best interest to be pregnant at this time u are. 18 is still young and it will probably affect your schooling and relationship with your boyfriend. I hope you arent considering abortion. The child is alive and growing and it would be wrong to kill someone just to make up for a simple mistake. Tell your parents and see if they can help you and talk to your boyfriend about it.

(we've been together 2 1/2 years) my mom's already told me more than once that if i end up pregnant she'll kick me out of the house and my b/f's parents are not in a good financial situation at all so i have no clue how we're gonna make it. i work as a hostess at a restaurant and he doesn't even have a job b/c no on is hiring. i have no clue whatsoever what's going to happen. i'm so incredibly nervous about telling them. i think his parents will be much more accepting/understanding than mine will be...his mom had him at 18 and his dad was 21. my mom had a miscarriage at 16 but she's so judgmental and doesn't listen to anything i say. she acts like she's so much better than i am. i don't know. he's thinking about joining the marines because he thinks it's the only way we can make it b/c there's free housing and medical for us. i don't want him to go into that crap though b/c then i'll have to raise the baby all by myself (while he's gone for months at a time). and i'll be lonely...i'm sorry i guess i'm not really helping you by rambling on and on am i? anyway...we're definitely keeping the baby. it's going to be hard. it's going to suck having to work all the time and not being able to hang out w/ our friends. but we're going to have a little baby and we're going to love him/her more than anything in the world. good luck. i hope everything works out for you. :) |`|RzkbwWYoaa	ugh hello you're 8teen any age that ends in teen means you're still a teenager<br>  <br>  and as far as teenage pregnancy, i think these girls should wait until marriage, have a good stable job, a home and a loving husband<br>  <br>  b/c believe me, getting pregnant now isn't worth it, you're still young and have a lot to live for<br>  <br>  don't you like having fun and hanging out with your friends and getting away from the stress of life? well if you have a kid, you'll be stuck in that house 24/7 with no time to hang with friends but you'll spend your time rocking that baby to sleep, changing diapers, feeding it, and dealing with a baby who won't stop crying!<br>  <br>  and now these days, men, well boys i should say, are too chicken to step up to the plate and accept fatherhood and help take care of the baby...... once they even hear that you're expecting they'll get up and leave!<br>  <br>  so your bf might seem happy now.... ha, just wait until it becomes reality!!!<br>  <br>  not to be mean or offend you, but just wait until you're old enough, mature enough, and have everything that i mentioned earlier before<br>  <br>  <br>  *EDIT* excuse me, i obviously didn't read the part that you said you are pregnant!!! well, good luck to you and your bf, but honestly (on my part) i don't think you should have a baby now, but i hope it works out for you and your bf, and if you do not want the baby, then give it to a loving family that will<br>  <br>  take care sweetie!|`|YiiUBVSmaa	thats what i thought so too<br>  together with crazy stuff like abortion and adoption<br>  but the very moment i had my baby,i felt an instant connection<br>  that made me regret ever thinking of those horrible things<br>  and hold on to him,no matter what<br>  <br>  when my parents found out,they had been nothing but supportive and<br>  never made me feel guilty,which made me feel unworthy of that treatment coz i know i've wronged them, that i've shattered their dreams and plans for me but amidst all that,they were by my side making sure i ate right and had sufficient rest amidst the stress i had to deal with...they pushed me to keep the kid,even if we werent sure if we would be able to support him financially coz we werent "well-off". plus,his father is a jackass who ran away after learning bout my pregnancy so i consider u lucky to have a bf who stood by ur side<br>  <br>  if u think u couldnt muster the courage to open up to ur parents about this,ask ur bf if he could do it with you<br>  <br>  i think u shouldnt worry if u are/arent ready to be a mom coz <br>  everything happens for a reason and everything happens at the right time<br>  <br>  i hope u could get through this and dont worry bout college,u could continue the year after or be homeschooled or whatever ur mom advices u to do,just be strong,have faith and u'll be alright|`|lquuBDOCaa	It is not wrong, it is early but you can do it and you can even go on to have a completely happy and successful life if you work hard and do what you need to do in order to take care of your baby and yourself!<br>  <br>  I was pregnant with my first or four children when I was 18,  I worked part time after my daughter was born and I also attended college...  I worked part time during the day and the other part of the day I attened classes, and there are daycare programs through Department of Economic Security that will help to pay the daycare so that you can work and attend school.  They help pay your registration fees, and they work on a sliding scale based onhow much money you make.  <br>  <br>  After my first two years in college I started to work as a banquet server, they usually make great money and most of the hours were at night and on the weekends so my mom watched my daughter while I worked and I was taking online classes at this time, so I could continue to attend college and spendtime with my daughgter during the day!  It was hard I won't lie to you and I didn't get a whole lot of sleep but when I just kept reminding myself that I only had to do this for acouple of years and then I would be done with school and things would be eaiser.  If you put that in perspective a few years is not relly that big of a deal.  I graduated college with 2 degrees and I had 2 other children before I finally finished so it is very possible!  <br>  <br>  The good thing is that your boyfriend is happy about it and I would assume willing to help, that is half the battle!  You two can schedule your work so that you both get to have time with the baby and so that you can save money on daycare. Sign up for some type of college you will need to have some education to help you get a decent job so that you two are not always stressed for cash. <br>  <br>  Don't let me make this sound like it is going to be easy either it won't be!  It will be very hard and there will be times when  you cry and think I can't do this it is too hard, you will have to make several sacrifices.  You will not be going out with your friends all the time, you will not be able o go to the bars and drink when you turn 21 the way most people do when they are that agge, you will have to stay home and take care of your family.  <br>  <br>  You need to be sure that this is what you want and you need to be honest with yourself and think that you can and want to do this.  If you are not ready you will grow to resent your child and feel that they ruined your life and stole your youth from you!  So be sure to think it through and be sure that you want this, if you ahve your parents support you will have it even better and that too will help to eliviate some of the burden.  <br>  <br>  I am sure that you and your boyfriend love each other but you are both still very young and this is going to put a lot of stress on your relationship, and you have to be prepared to have to raise this child all alone without his help as things may change as you two grow older and he wants to go out with his friends and you have to stay home with your baby.  So keep in mind that you could end up rasising that baby alone, and you need to be prepared for that scenario as well.  If you and your boyfriend can talk opeinly to each other about the reality of what you will be givin up to raise the chld and you are both willing to give those things up then you can do it.  You will both need to be willing to help each other and take turns with the baby and it is important that both of you get a chance to get out and enjoy life too don't resent the other if you don't get to it will be your turn next time.  A lot of comprimise will be needed to make it work.  If you can't honestly think to yourself that you are willing to give up your own life for your child and that you are ready to put the needs of your chld before your own and be prepared to raise that baby alone just in case the father changes his mind when the going gets tough then you should consider some other options (adoption there are plenty of moms out there that are ready to offer your baby the life you can't at this time and then you can have children later in life when you are ready.)  You and your baby will not live a happy life if you resent him/her for taking away your life, so just be sure it is what you really want.  Talk to your parents most of the time you will be surprised at how willing to help they are especially if you are willing to continue to work and attend school to show that you are serious and that you are doing your part to make a life for your baby and yourself! I bet your parents will be worried but they will understand and helpyou if they can!  :) <br>  <br>  I am now in my first year of law school and I was in your shoes and I made it so can you!  Good luck to you in whatever you decide and I wish you the best of luck!  :)

Mira es logico que no le guste dormir sola pero tienes que tener la regla firme ... no esperes a que ella entienda nada (no lo digo por crueldad sino que en este caso ella no va a entender ninguna razon que le digas).  Dichas todas las razones pues le toca dormir sola.<br>  <br>  Otra cosa ... no le muestres desesperacion a tu hija por que ella se debe estar dando cuenta y esta usando eso para poder hacer lo que ella desea (no estoy diciendo que por eso un ni?o sea malo o mal educado).  <br>  <br>  No te duermas con ella en su cama por que no estas resolviendo nada sino cambiando de cama.  Sino haces el cambio ahora, a ella no le importara dornir contigo hasta que cumpla los 18.|`|91d5c22e6f8912ce779abc527502ec12aa	creo que lo mejor es hacer una rutina, se que llegas cansada (soy madre trabajadora tambien) pero saca un poquito de fuerzas juega con ella un rato luego prepara para dormir, no se si la ba?as, pero seria bueno para que se relaje un poco, luego vayan al cuarto de la nena elijan un cuento, hablen un poco del como estuvo el dia cuentale un cuento o cantale alguna cancion y dile que es hora de dormir, oren, arropala y busca alguna lamparita que no haga mucha luz y dejala encendida.<br>  <br>  la rutina es buena en los ninos, les crea seguridad, de vez en cuando espera hasta que se duerma, sino, puedes acostarla y decirle que vas a cenar y luego vendras a verla, lo haces y si esta despierta le das un beso y le dices que te vas preparar para dormir pues estas cansada tambien, que vendras antes de acostarte a darle otro beso.<br>  <br>  hazle la rutina, involucra a tu esposo tambien, y veras como poco a poco se acostumbra|`|Wk6kqAfmaa	puede ser que alguna noche hayas cedido y dormiste con ella para que no llorara y ahora ella sabe que si llora vas a ir.<br>  no se si te ayudara pero no vayas a la minima que llora vete espaciando un poco, dejala que llore un poco y vas a ver que le pasa, pero poco a poco .<br>  yo creo que tenias que haberla llevado antes de los tres a?os a dormir sola.<br>  ten paciencia porque si ellla te ve nerviosa tambien se lo transmites.<br>  espero que te vaya bien.suerte|`|Cb0bdPdxaa	Quizas tenga pesadillas. Duerme con ella. Y asegurlae que ella esta protegida.|`|m1h0Xk6Daa	tal ves mi respuesta no es lo que esperas pero tal ves ella no te esta manipulando solo que tiene miedo dormir solita, no se yo no soy de la idea de que a tal edad a fuerza tienen que dormir solos, sinceramente no creo que por ejemplo a los 5 anos quiera dormir con ustedes o te pida tanto que estes con ella, atiendela ahora que ella te necesita ya llegara el dia que ella volara y este problema sera un recuerdo<br>  <br>  Besos
XGd21yjSaa	There are two types of anesthesia that can be used during an abortion, a local anesthesia (cervix is numbed, just a pain reliever) or general anesthesia (being put to sleep). <br>  <br>  She may not care during the procedure, but how will she feel after wards? The effects of anesthesia only last as long as the procedure, but the emotional consequences of an abortion can last a lifetime.|`|2Hot9EJiaa	It puts you to sleep , and yes, it can make you groggy for awhile, but I can tell you this, even if she were to not know what is going on during the surgery, she will never be able to forget that she had an abortion.  It can cause her physical problems and emotional problems.  The emotional and spiritual issues can last years. |`|v3LnJycKaa	a second trimester abortion is nothing short of gruesome... and illegal in most states... |`|tOWqXCdtaa	If she doesn't want her kid, tell her to give it up for adoption. They won't give her a medically unnecessary abortion after the first trimester and if she tries something herself, she could end up hurting herself and/or deforming the baby but not killing it. Why would she wait this long anyway? She didn't realize she didn't want a baby before this? Even if the drugs make her "loopy", the effects are only temporary. If she says that she won't care just because of the drugs, she's wrong. She will care and it's going to haunt her. At this point she must be able to feel the baby kick, and will likely feel some loss.|`|Yn6pM2Xyaa	the drug they use for an abortion is its anything like what i had will make you feel disconnected from the world and everything will be slow motion but it only lasts for like maybe 20 minutes and then the drug is out. But they will NOT give you an abortion if you are past the first trimester unless medically required.|`|yznZqcznaa	It is anesthesia, and no it does not drug you up unless you have a reaction to it.  It puts you to sleep so that you dont feel what is going on.|`|e4SflIigaa	5 MONTHS pregnant? Your friend shouldn't be having sex if she's not ready to take care of the responsibilitites that come with having sex. people use a condom or get a dildo|`|L42LJ1P4aa	Umm, 5 months is kind of late to get an abortion. Does your silly friend realize that most clinics will not abort a baby that is over 12 weeks unless there's a specific reason like deformity or disease? And anesthetics do not drug you up, they make you fall asleep. When you wake up, the pain is real.|`|xTlfOPu5aa	anaesthetic makes you unconscious so you dont feel pain, after waking from it people are a little groggy but not for long, as it wears off within hours (although it stays in your system for up to 12months) and no it doesnt alter your perception of reality or anything like that - it is purely to make you sleep and give pain relief x|`|r4N3R0dtaa	It's anesthetic not anastasia  and it depending on what kind, yes it can make you sleep or numb you completely.    |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It knocks you out as far as I know. Whenever you have surgery and they give you anesthesia it puts you completely out. |`|7SROKWiZaa	it is just a pain reliever
NNY6xVj8aa	I would buy a few more tests and see the results of those... if they all turn out negative then your probably not pregnant... just to be sure though you could go to a doctor/gyno and then can give you a test there or planned parenthood.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	How long did it show positive until it started to turn negative? When I was 3 weeks pregnant my test was EXTREMELY faint positive and after a while it did start to show negative so that could be what happened for you. If I were you I would contact your doctor and get a blood test or you could wait a week or so and take another test and see what the results show. Chances are though that you are pregnant. Sorry.
bha4ROR1aa	A positive is a positive.  You're pregnant.  It just means that you took it early and you aren't producing enough HCG to make it dark yet.  When you retest in a few days it'll be darker.|`|hVUseUFkaa	When I was pregnant in May I pee'd for the dr and he said no i don't think you're pregnant its only really faint here (meaning pregnant derr) and he sent me for blood tests and never got back to me and I ended up miscarrying that baby 4 days later. and then this pregnancy  mine started off with the more faint line, I could barely see it. Exciting.. YOU'RE PREGNANT.. CONGRATS..... Tell him you want a blood test to confirm it properly tho. |`|jGOPgcw5aa	Yes, with my first two pregnancies the line was barely visible at first.  I retook the test 12 hours later and it was darker!  Your HcG level goes up each day that you are pregnant, so the result gets darker.|`|MtC3CWZraa	Yep. It just means you went in really early. <br>  <br>  I would hope your doc isn’t charging you for these tests. Mine certainly didn’t. <br>  |`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	sorry they want youR$$$ you are preggo|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	When I found out I took a test at home and it was very faint so I went to the nearest obgyn and they got a very light positive as well and told me negative. So then I called my fertility doctor and they sent for me to get a blood test and I was 3 weeks pregnant. If I were you I would see if you could get a blood test because I know how much it would suck to have to wait a few days to find out if you are pregnant. Chances are though is that you are pregnant. You got a positive. CongratS!!!|`|9bUN1AHFaa	I have only ever heard of faint positives being positives.  I would say you are pregnant.  I am surprised your doctor didn't have you do a blood test.  <br>  <br>  You never know though, things happen and it could have been wrong.  But I highly doubt it was wrong.'<br>  <br>  Good Luck, and congrats!!|`|da0bd1389f2c6ba2fe645d6d1c4be705aa	congrats|`|KdqaGnlwaa	its says so on the HPT, "One line can be faint" and it lists it under pregnant. Congratulations! I say you are preggers!
65baadde1a27b20964ccb07ad83092e0aa	Yes you feel like you are having growing pains in your uterus.  It's like a weird mild cramp feeling. You don't feel them as much in your 3rd trimester. first and second are the worst times for them.  But they really are not bad and they don't last long.  Well mine were like that. |`|zwctZ812aa	yes, you can feel it sometimes.  I wouldn't describe it as really hurting, but it is a little uncomfortable sometimes.  It can feel like a kind of shooting pain, or just a stretching pain.  Both are from the uterus and ligaments stretching, but I didn't find it overly painful. |`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	yes and does hurt and it is freaky|`|dSrDRhsXaa	Yes.  I had lots of round ligament pains early on.  Around my navel and waist hurt aswell.  What your going through is very very normal.|`|sjUNb9zXaa	Yes its kind of like very mild menstural cramps.  Their off & on,& can be kind of irretating.   |`|da0bd1389f2c6ba2fe645d6d1c4be705aa	yes i can feel it and yes it hurts|`|Q6YboW9Daa	My stomach hasn't started growing because I'm not far enough along in my pregnancy.  However, I do get pretty bad cramps here and there because of my uterus stretching and it is not comfortable at all.|`|lARcutEqaa	For me it's kind of an uncomfortable feeling, not necessarily painful. I could definitely feel when it was stretching. I wouldn't feel it everyday  just every now and then. |`|0ae94159aebb0543d95ea52595c8db2caa	yes, it makes you very uncomfortable.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Yeah you feel pain all over in your belly and then your back as well. It sucks.
gyJ6DVRkaa	How far along are you?<br>  What color is the blood?<br>  <br>  If you are the early stages of pregnancy, it may be implantation bleeding. The color should be light pink to brownish color.  Cramping is normal for the beginning stages of pregnancy, b/c you ligaments are stretching.<br>  <br>   If you are further along in pregnancy and bleeding a rich red, you need to get to an ER.|`|I2jHMLjKaa	Depending on how early you are in your pregnancy it could be implantation bleeding.. im almost 10 weeks and still have some spotting from time to time.. just as long as you dont fill up a pad it is normal.. i would call your doctor anyways though.. i did when i had my first bleed (around 6 weeks) and they did an ultrasound to show my baby was perfectly fine!<br>  <br>  So dont worry and congratulations|`|NmoTFTSEaa	It may not be anything serious, but you should see a doctor.|`|UXRwYHrMaa	None of us are there the way you are, so only you really know whether you are talking about a little brown blood or a whole lot of bright red blood, and that difference may matter. <br>  <br>  Don't freak out, don't worry. Just call your doctor or OB if you have one already and describe what is going on in great detail and let them advise you.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I would probably go to the Emergency Room because you are bleeding not spotting. It is normal to have light pink spotting but I don't think its really normal to have super heavy bleeding. Just to be on the safe side I would go to the ER and make sure you're not having a miscarriage. good luck|`|iAQKD2YBaa	You definitely should. It is only unsafe in your first trimester. <br>  Ooops - I must be tired - I didn't mean to answer this question with this answer, this was in regards to having a flu shot !!!!!!!!! No wonder I got the thumbs down hehehehe!!!|`|fPX1lD8uaa	You need to call your doctor and explain your situation.<br>  Good luck!|`|cZYBtCwbaa	It's spot-bleeding. Pregnant women have spot-bleeding which can sometimes resemble a period. <br>  If you took three pregnancy tests and they were all positive, then I really think you're pregnant. <br>  I suggest that you go see your doctor as soon as you can. I'm not saying that anything is wrong, but your doctor can explain it all in more detail, and help you through your pregnancy as well. <br>  <br>  Congrats, by the way.|`|OnkStkY1aa	you need to go to the doctor it could be a miscarriage or simple just your body.... but i would def go to the doc. cuz its an emergency situation.|`|et6tmKakaa	My grandmother says she bled w/ 2 of her pregnancies she gave birth to healthy babies,id talk to my dr.|`|OMTSqrSFaa	id see a doctor  good luck x
RE6GBw0Baa	just find out 4 def 1st hunni, no need to worry all for nothing, and just tell them out right, your are their daughter and they  love u and will support you no matter what, they may be shocked / upset/ happy / any other emotion, but either way they will support u and be glad u came to them.<br>  <br>  i was pregnant in 07 for 13 weeks and i never told my mom untill last november and i wish i had done because i needed her more than i thought xxxx|`|m0DgqEcjaa	find out if your pregnant first|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	The first thing you need to do is find out for sure if you are pregnant. You may not be and you may just be freaking out for no reason. If you are pregnant then you just need to sit them down and explain to them that you made a mistake but now you are pregnant and they're getting another grandbaby. Good luck and I hope everything works out for you.|`|aJjV5b95aa	Make sure that you are pregnant first and if you just tell them be honest (I know it sounds a lot easier than it really is). Just remember that they love you and if they are not happy at first they should come around and everything happens for a reason. Good Luck!|`|HqVoLzjcaa	First you should find out before you break the news to anyone.|`|2B2fgmw9aa	First and foremost, find out if you are pregnant first!|`|OuuYoSBeaa	maybe confirm your pregnancy before you jump the gun on anything... If you are late for your period, then take a test and see what it says...<br>  If it turns out your are not pregnant, then count your lucky stars this time, and maybe just ask your mom about birthcontrol, or go get some yourself.<br>  If you are pregnant, then you have some decisions to make. Do you know this guy, so you can contact him..|`|c95743ee47171e3f56ebec2ea3549986aa	First off, be 100% sure. Go to Planned Parenthood or take a few of the EPT test. Once you are sure, write a letter, and sit with them as they read it. Dont let them say anything until they complete the letter. that way you get out EVERYTHING you want to say before they respond with possible negativity, or hopefully support. |`|OMTSqrSFaa	find out your pregnant first ..the tell your parents they may not go as mad as u thought they was guna ya no ..i thought i wo guna get killed off my dad but he was fine x there nothing they can do if u are and you want to keep it ..good luck|`|C5S7dvkFaa	Go get a test to make sure before you tell them anything.If you are they will understand might be a little upset but will back you up they are your parents.|`|fSCLhZghaa	just  go  right out and tell them but If   I where you just   wait until you know that  you are pregnant  so  you don't scare them about it|`|et6tmKakaa	well sweetie find out for sure first then just tell them at first they may seem upset itwill pass|`|6wIhccQ2aa	first find out if u really are, then just tell them cause really no matter what u do ur going to have to tell them
fG7LmB7Kaa	Sounds like she is having ovulation cramps. Are they on just one side of her abdomen? If so it's definitely ovulation cramps. If not go to a Dollar Store and pick up a pregnancy test or got o planned parenthood!|`|sbfm5rCAaa	I highly doubt she is pregnant. If she has had a period and you never ejaculated inside of her then prenancy is not likely.<br>  <br>  Her cramps are probably a stomach flu or eating something bad.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	If she had her period then I doubt it. If you really think she may be then get her to take a pregnancy test. Her body is probably just going through changes though. Good luck|`|rjNDg9tIaa	I have cramps a lot after sex... sometimes for weeks after.  I don't think she is pregnant.|`|FQz99rveaa	Well the main question i have is did you ejaculate in her?|`|OMTSqrSFaa	small chance but can get preg off pre *** ??|`|d1LTld6gaa	Well any time you have unprotected sex there is a chance of becoming pregnant, but just because she is having cramps doesn't mean she is.  I have had 4 kids and I never had cramps as a symptom.  I have heard that sometimes when you do get pregnant some ladies will have a cleansing period right after, but I think that is rare. The symptom she will have if she is pregnant are, feeling really tired, sick to stomach, not wanting to eat or having cravings,  sore breasts, and missing your period.  <br>  <br>  You won't know if she is for a few weeks anyways so you might as well not worry about it right now, and next time if you don't want to get a girl pregnant use a condom or don't have sex.  
zhk8o514aa	Stay away from the bathroom unless you have very good ventilation.<br>  <br>  Try to use natural cleaners.|`|hswTS1jVaa	No, you can still clean.  Just don't inhale bottles of cleaner or anything, but normal cleaning is fine |`|QkLrhgA4aa	Chemically, it depends on what you are cleaning with. Try to avoid strong smelling chemicals. You can use dish soap, baking soda or oxi clean for a lot in place of harsh chemicals.<br>  <br>  If you are talking physically then you are good to go.The important thing to remember is- do what you normally would, unless told other wise by OBGYN. By being as active as before and doing your normal activities it makes the entire pregnancy, including labor and delivery easier. <br>  <br>  If you are at risk your OBGYN will tell you. If you think you are at risk, ask and they will go over your concerns with you. Best of luck and congrats! God has given you an amazing blessing that is worth every laugh, smile and tear!|`|t5xnbgKkaa	There are some tested and non-toxic cleaning products on the market; check out your local supermarkets and drug stores for them, but most cleaning products are harmful to everyone if the truth be told..which is why you get instructions such as use only in a well ventilated space..on oven cleaners!|`|Po2UqfvWaa	pregnant or not yes they are. same thing when the kid is born. inhaling that crap. get natural products and don't use bleach EVER.|`|zhcw5xwUaa	No danger..as long you dont breath in acid ...<br>  <br>  <br>  perfectly fine : D   *Thumbs*|`|cY8DgJv5aa	The chemicals in some products are harmful to all people.  Like bleach and such.  As long as you are in a well ventilated area and you are using a cleaning product that's not too strong, then you'll be fine.  If you are concerned, try mixing your own cleaners.  Vinegar and water is just as good as any multi-purpose cleaner.|`|XHeiEgF1aa	Use the Clorox Greenworks line of products. It's made out of only lemon juice and vinegar. It all works VERY well and has no harmful fumes. They come in sprays, floor cleaners, wipes and everything.|`|L8peUnIPaa	Most cleaning products are fine, but don't be mixing any & stay away from the harsher ones like bleach & ammonia (danger: if these 2 are mixed, even when not pregnant). Keep your house well ventilated while cleaning.<br>  OB/GYN RN & mom|`|aGxbD6snaa	congrats! yes they can be harmful but if you are careful and make sure you clean your hands straight after use, its unlikely anything bad will happen. if you are concerned about certain products have a chat with your doctor/midwife to put your mind at rest.|`|wbDAXqctaa	Congrats!!<br>  <br>  The chemicals in some products CAN be harmful...I wouldn't take the chance. However a little soap and water, dusting and the vacuum wouldn't hurt!!|`|O5WberWnaa	im 15wks+ and ive been having a good clean out to day,using bleach.<br>  aslong as your not eating it or shoving it up your nose lol i wouldnt worry!<br>  good luck in your pregnancy x|`|MQ83HGD5aa	It depends on what you are using. Just to be safe us a mask or make sure you are in a well ventulated area.|`|nhLwgCTpaa	just don't sniff it in. yo|`|jTFdG8xqaa	No your probably going to be fine, though cleaning chemicals are harmful to everyone (to an extent) the benifits of a clean household outweigh the downside. If your really really worried, give your doctor a call, he can tell you the damage (if any) and precautions you can take. I hate talking to my doctor as much as the next guy but i missed admit that she normally lessens my worry rather than leaving myself without a rocksolid answer. Hope this helps|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I believe in the What to Expect When You are Expecting book it will tell you what to do while cleaning. I've been told that if you are going to clean open a window and make sure that you have good ventilation in the room you are cleaning. Just try to avoid inhaling the chemicals. Good luck and congrats!|`|XlJLbjE6aa	Use natural cleaning products, go non-toxic and you'll be fine. It's definitely not a good excuse to get out of cleaning, if that's what your looking for. Use fatigue instead. |`|YtIFh97kaa	Harmful to anyone but with a developing fetus, I wouldn't chance it. Try some natural cleaning solutions, vinegar and water work for anything!|`|yx38nBb0aa	Yeah, the chemicals in cleaning products are harmful for people who aren't pregnant, so I would suppose so.|`|gJqCWt7waa	normal cleaning is fine - dusting, mopping.... but nothing like oven cleaning where you will be breathing the fumes continuously|`|LJDzC3iYaa	nope. Take off your shoes and scrub those floors clean. Then get on the dishes, laundry, and toilet scrubbing too.
YJNql5Mgaa	Get on birth control, though it'll take some time to get regulated into your system.  Until then, you still need to have some kind of protect, so condom would most likely be the way to go.<br>  <br>  If he doesn't want to use condoms, tell him, "No condoms equal a baby". so he's just going to have to wait.|`|AykczQleaa	Make him.  If you don't want kids either, birth control isn't 100%.  <br>  <br>  No condom = no sex!|`|ec20340954300949b5d60c056689dd33aa	when a guy tells you it doesn't fell good with a condom..he's lying. <br>  They are designed to be super thin and have the most natural feel possible. or else nobody would use them. |`|Yn6pM2Xyaa	your bf is an idiot for not wanting to use a condom if that is his standpoint.. he's also selfish.. a person who takes no responsibility for  birth control deserves what they get.  get on birth control asap to make sure you don't have a baby with someone like this!!!  Also might wanna consider forcing him to use a condom to protect yourself from STD's!!!|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	even if you start birth control pills there is still a "wait" period<br>  <br>  and birth control is not 100% effective<br>  <br>  if he hates using condoms, then tell him NO sex<br>  <br>  if he doesnt like that, then he's not the one for you - he doesnt respect your wishes and isnt a responsible person|`|w4zjmhxoaa	I would refuse to have sex with him (until your birth control kicks in) unless he uses a condom.  You've got to be smart about this, he can't have his cake and eat it too.  |`|kd9kWB8Kaa	tell him to use or bye bye.  and pray that it's not to late.  get tested now.|`|2ZoUduoPaa	I'm not trying to be mean, but your BF sounds a little immature if he doesn't want to wrap his willy, but doesn't want kids.  It also sounds that you are not on birth control yet.  If you aren't, anytime that you have unprotected sex could lead to pregnancy.  <br>  Your boyfriend is aware that condoms not only cut down on the risk of pregnancy, but cuts down on the risk of STDs as well, right?  Honestly, that would worry me a bit.  I understand you've been "talking" for three years, but that doesn't mean he wasn't "seeing" other people during that time.  If he doesn't want to wear a condom NOW, did he use them in the past?  Do you know how many women he has been with?  Are you positive he does not have an STD.  Some STDs never show symptoms in males, and some can even be transferred without having outbreaks or symptoms.  Although pregnancy is a big issue, I would be asking him some of these questions.  He's a big boy, if he doesn't want to use a condom, he'll have to face the consequences.  Even oral contraceptives are not always 100% effective, and the do not prevent STDs.<br>  I have a friend who got pregnant while taking them faithfully.  So it can happen.  Just make sure you and your BF are willing to face all risks, pregnancy, STDs, or anything else that comes from having having unprotected sex.|`|sbfm5rCAaa	I must say that your boyfriend is really selfish to say he does not want kids but he does not want ot take the precautions himself against him (sorry...not meaning to be insulting to you but it just bugs me that men always expect the woman to sort out everything so they can have their way).<br>  <br>  You could look at going on the pill or use a diaphragm which are both quite good methods of birth control. Go to your gynea and ask them for advice but the pill is the easiest form of birth control.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|lCwE9QP5aa	This really is something you should have figured out before you started having sex, but yes definitely get on birth control. There really is no other option & until then- don't have unprotected sex if you don't want  a baby. He just may have to wear a condom until it is safe to go with just the pill, too bad for him!|`|7HzfgRmwaa	it sounds like thats what he wants you to do - You be responsible for it all, get on birth control, make sure you don't get pregnant and he will just enjoy the sex. <br>  <br>  How disgusting. id stop sleeping with him and find someone who is more of a partner instead of making you solely responsible for everything.<br>  <br>  ....He probably hasnt used condoms very many times with any of his partners! Yuck! You need to go with him and both be tested for stds!! Are you not worried what he could be passing on to you? Even nice guys that you "know" and that are "clean" Can spread stds.....|`|8w0786yeaa	Then you stop dating him.  If he can't respect your body and take the precautions necessary to prevent a pregnancy, then he's a selfish man who doesn't deserve to have sex.  With that said, you should also be on birth control.|`|e4SflIigaa	Tell your boyfriend to put a condom on or put a ring on your finger and then you can get on the pills and he won't have to wear a condom..|`|OxFV92hJaa	I'd find a different b/f honestly. He doesn't have your best interest at heart, nor his own for that matter. I wouldn't waste time with someone that didn't care about something like that.|`|KYvlD9o9aa	u say no|`|aJjV5b95aa	If you believe you may already be pregnant you need to take a test and find out. You also need to get on birth control ASAP. Are you comfortable having unprotected sex? If you are not you need to let him now and do something about it if he does not understand than that is tough luck for him. If you are you can also buy products like spermicide at the drug store (they make it in different form check it out and find out what would be best for you) that would lower you chances of getting pregnant if you are having un protected sex. Also remember that condoms not only protect you from STD's and HIV. |`|FGbwdKdhaa	It seems as though he's not considering you! Please do not have sex without protection as well as an unwanted pregnancy you could contact an unwanted infection.<br>  <br>  Birth control pills do a fantastic job but they are a chemical / drug and need to be given a lot of thought before taking them. If you're happy to take it then see your doctor and ask for your boyfriend to take a sexual health test - just to be sure as it only takes one time to contract something. <br>  <br>  If you have already had sex there are options such as the morning after pill hat can be taken within a few days of sex but again, this is a chemical and shouldn't be used as a form of contraception.<br>  <br>  Hope you manage to work something out soon.|`|4alpEAzaaa	Unprotected sex goes further than getting pregnant, STD's are aserious issue as well.  Not saying that he is going to have sex with anyone else but never put it past anyone.  First, think about what you want and does he care about what you want.  You shouldn't have to sacrafice your needs or wants for him because clearly he wants to do what he wants to do.  Second, if you become "OK" with unprotected sex, then you already know the measures you need to take to prevent pregnancy.  Third, if it is too late and he has already expressed that he doesn't want children, that situation just might be a little SNAFU [situation normal, all *ucked up] then you have to think about will he be around for the baby.  Quiet a few choices to make, wish I would have thought about consequences before the descisions that currently have me in my situation.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you sweetheart.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Well you need to explain to him that having unprotected sex leads to pregnancy and then eventually a baby. I mean how stupid is he? If he doesn't want a kid then he needs to protect himself and you as well. If he chooses not to then he needs to be aware that a kid is a consequence. He sounds like a loser to me though.|`|kAuQugVKaa	If you boy-friend is serious about you he MUST use condoms.....  He should be adult but but a child and he should think about what he does and what consequences his actions can have.... And remember it's YOUR BODY and if you'll do abortion and it'll have very very bad consequences JUST for YOUR health.... So, talk serious about it with your bf and if he can't be charged with his acts he can't refuse to use condoms!!! |`|PwmBdiEfaa	Honestly I would tell him to go kick rocks.<br>  <br>  A real man stands up and takes responsibility. If he won't wear a condom now but says he doesn't want kids.....what kind of a father do you think he would be???? Cuz if you don't use protection, you WILL end up pregnant and you don't want a bum like that as your baby daddy.<br>  <br>  Trust me.|`|c73QkZ2haa	Its your body tell him if he wants to have sex he has to wear one. Be strong its you who will end up preg and even if your on the pill it doesnt prevent STD's so you should be using condoms anyways.<br>  Stand your ground and dont back down.|`|yy0LqCP4aa	How old is your boyfriend? He sounds like an immature little teenager. Obviously if he doesn't want to have a kid he needs to use a damn condom. Tell him to put on the glove or he won't get any love.|`|zDYKHnpJaa	He sounds like a loser. He doesn't want a kid but he doesn't want to use condoms? I would ditch him if I were you.<br>  <br>  But if you really like him and all that jazz I would just get on BC.|`|DTWEJKBEaa	Get on birth control and if its too late then its just too late. If youre already pregnant theres nothing you can do about it now.|`|ixzT5y1gaa	you can get pregnant EVERY time you have sex. of course it could be too late. how foolish.<br>  <br>   wait till your period comes(IF it does) then go on birthcontrol...dont have sex untill then|`|50e0975b0e8c470ea8e974086f449b63aa	Then if he doesn't want kids he need not to have un protected sex that's not hard. You should seek some kind of bc before engaging in sex with him again. |`|OMTSqrSFaa	go on the pill or something theres lots of other methods other than useing a condom|`|HqVoLzjcaa	You should go to the doctor and get on bc. They won't give you bc without a test. |`|SaTDQGPJaa	find a new boyfriend.|`|mG50yaHUaa	First of all, if he really cared about you at all, he would use a condom, NO EXCUSES!!  You have to protect yourself, not only from unwanted pregnancies, but from STDs.  Go have a pregnancy test ran, get on birth control and sit down and talk to the boyfriend.  If he is any kind of man, he will listen and respect your wishes,  if he doesn't he may not be the kind of guy you need to be having sex with.|`|WQS0lvuAaa	well there is always the morning after pill but you cant do that every time.  i mean if he doesn't want kids it makes no sense not to use a condom.  sorry but you boyfriend is a dummy. because even the pill isn't 100% take it from me i was on the pill and got pregnant with my son.  it's really up to you if he doesn't want to wear a condom then he gets no sex|`|VQFuTudkaa	Wow. You really have to get assertive with him, kinda like " If you dont want a kid then i dont want sex without a condom"! If you think he might leave you for that, then trust me he's not worth stressing over. Just think for a sec...suppose you do get pregnant, what if he doesnt support you after that? You did already mention he doesnt want any. So just let him know and hopefully he'll be a man about. Good Luck ^_^
9EkFrApiaa	Too early to tell more likely...you are just freaking yourself out.  Heart burn isn't a common early symptom but you never know.  Wait a few weeks and take a test but I think you were a little too close to the end of your cycle for ovulating but you may have been.  Do you check on a ovulation calandar?|`|mc6YtaRbaa	It's too early to tell. Stop freaking yourself out! Wait until you are a few days late and then get a HPT.|`|aqvzWF17aa	You and your bf definitely had unprotected sex during the usual ovulation times.  You have some common signs of pregnancy and also signs of just normal hormonal surges.  Drug store pregnancy tests are a very good indicator if taken when your next period should have started...depends on the length of your particular cycle.  Good luck.|`|xzh8r0jIaa	its alittle to early to be getting those signs of pregnancy. you should be able to tell ny taking a pregnancy test by now. i hope your ready.|`|KYvlD9o9aa	its signs but then again a lot of signs we think are pregnancy could be related to other things. don't stress on it yet just wait until you miss your period then test|`|IzHkb1neaa	these are the signs of pregnancy. Just get a test and you will know for sure. |`|DIZKlxNraa	Relax! I found out that I am pregnant when I was 8 weeks pregnant! My symthoms were totally different than yours so you probably are NOT Pregnant! Getting up in the middle of the night to pe occurs a bit later when your uterus becomes smaller as the fetus grows so it is not the sympthom of pregnancy right now for sure. Heartburn you get in advanced pregnancy not at the very begining also. I think you are experiencing those things from the anxiety you have. My sympthoms were: constatnt tiredness, nausea, breasts sensitive. Everyone is different but I am 90% sure you are not pregnant!|`|EzuYExM4aa	I am 10 weeks pregnant and I still don't have the urge to pee.  I don't think that starts until the baby weighs enough to put pressure on your bladder.  Heartburn and acne are symptoms but they can happen to anyone.  The best way to find out is to just take a test.  I knew something was different because I was having severe back pains and  I was a couple days late for my period (which is NOT normal for me) and so I went and bought a test.  If you have noticed any spotting, that is another sign.  <br>  <br>  I was totally shocked, but excited, when it came out positive.  Good luck!|`|o4zAdwQkaa	Definitely signs of being pregnant... buy a pregnancy test!|`|GjuRYsITaa	getting spots is how i always know im pregnant before ive even done the test|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	You could be pregnant. Take a test.|`|wYNzqiEbaa	take an at home  test or see your DR|`|5YTWIfFdaa	the sure way to know - get a pregnancy test|`|xxMKaJCBaa	yes its a sign go and do a test its the only way your gona find out x|`|fuiUY7UMaa	Have you thought about taking a pregnancy test?  You did appear to have sex right around the time of your ovulation it seems.  But, you are a little early along to be experiencing pregnancy symptoms.  Your best best is to either wait until you miss your period or take the test.  <br>  Good Luck.    |`|fvrctPZzaa	it's called a pregnancy test idiot.
lQORNmNiaa	I really liked "Your Pregnancy, Week by Week".  I loved seeing pictures and hearing details about my baby every week.  They also have a feature like this on WebMd. (See link)<br>  <br>  Whatever you do, don't read the Chicken Soup for the Expectant Mother's soul.  It's a bunch of stories about how tired and stressed new mom's are.  It made me anxious!<br>  <br>  Congrats!|`|MtC3CWZraa	What to Expect When You’re Expecting is called the “pregnancy Bible” for a reason!|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	I read a lot of books but really like Pregnancy Week By Week. |`|qicxk5GMaa	omg.. I was the same way.  I'm 11 wks now but when I found out I was only 5 wks and went to the library that day!  I've been back like 2 other times as well since then and each time I check out like 8-10 books.  I think the best have been the what to expect when you're expecting... pregnancy for dummies and belly laughs (by Jenny McCarthy).

da0bd1389f2c6ba2fe645d6d1c4be705aa	um ur pregnant|`|f3SyOyMEaa	Usually the answer of positive is correct 99.9% of the time.<br>  There is a hormone that is in your body when you are pregnant that is not normally there, and that is what shows up on the pregnancy test.<br>  False negatives are possible, false positives are very, very rare.<br>  Oops!<br>  <br>  Best Wishes|`|XhmwNtb2aa	Sounds to me like your pregnant... its rare to get a false positive, especially twice.. for that second line to show there has to be the pregnancy hormone in your body. <br>  Just go to the doctor to confirm but i think you can safely bet on being pregnant.<br>  Congratuations.|`|kbIkVS0raa	a positive is a positive you're pregnant. It is very unlikely to get two false positives.|`|6d6GHChPaa	False positives are pretty rare. If you got 2 positives go ahead and make an appointment with your doctor. They can tell you for sure.|`|ixD2RnqTaa	I think your pregnant|`|xGmkwI8kaa	There is no such thing as a false positive on a pregnancy test, it's only possible to get false negatives.  <br>  <br>  You're pregnant if it came up positive.  You need to go to your doctor for bloodwork to check and see if the pragnancy is viable (the hcg levels need to go up a certain amount every day, otherwise that might indicate the pragnancy is merely a blighted ovum and will not develop into a fetus, but the odds of this are very low).|`|PtqweQVcaa	It IS absolutely possible to get a false positive on pregnancy tests.<br>  <br>  I got a false positive pregnancy test AT THE DOCTOR!<br>  <br>  I went in for severe pain in my female region and had a positive pregnancy urine test at the doc.

ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It would probably be best to see your doctor about it. I don't believe that the chlamydia has anything to do with it. If you see a doctor that specializes in infertility then they can perform tests on you that can check to see if there is anything wrong with you. I tried for 2 1/2 years and I had tons of test done and nothing was wrong with me. In June my doctor put me on clomid and we also bought a clear-blue fertility monitor and July 16th we found out I was 3 weeks pregnant. I would see your doctor and look into the fertility monitor. Good luck and I hope that it happens for you.|`|vMhsy241aa	i got pregnant right away at 16 by my (now husband) and had a miscarriage in may 07 we have been trying ever since, so 17 mths... and nothing yet...<br>  <br>  i don't know about the chlamydia.. i never heard anything about being infertile. |`|EatvN0RUaa	I am 22 and got pregnant with my son when i was 21. I got married when i was 20 and we started trying right away. WE did not get pregnant right away either so we went to the doctors and they did a lot of tests. After the tests they said everything seemed ok so they started me on Clomid. I got pregnant the second round. I can't believe you are that patient to have waited 2 years and 2 months!|`|BcEuNor6aa	I think that is difficult for anyone to say on here.  I would definitely make an appointment with your doctor and talk it over.<br>  <br>  Karrie
4d3387b9fd9ba04e1c03924485576158aa	The changes in my breasts were the first sign that I was pregnant - they just weren't "normal" so I knew something was up. LOL. As I was still menstruating....<br>  Just grab a test (or a couple as it may be too soon) as was the case with me.......took a test - showed neg - took another one about 2 weeks later (when my breast started getting itchy/achey/full) and well the rest is history!|`|O7U1tUaJaa	that happened to me this pregnancy but I already knew that I was pregnant.  i found out at 6 dpo!!!.  I assume your ttc since you know when yoou ovulated.  your probably going to buy a test anyway.  why not buy a 2 or 3 pack if they have them and take a test tomorrow morning.  I was stocked up on tests so I started testing the day after ovulation to see how long it would take to get a positive.  it took 6 days.  I asked my doctor how that was possible and she said that implantatin usually occurs 2-3 days after conception and then it takes a minimum of 3 days for your hcg level to get to 25 which is what most tests show positive at.  give it a try it won't hurt and then if it's negative you miss your period you'll still have another test.  if you get your period then you won't have to buy a test next month.  My first test at 6 dpo was very faint so I took a digital test the next day both were positive maybe try a digital so there is no confusion.|`|0bbb6736218115409a4c5e262c9f4901aa	my breast hurt everytime before my period and when i became pregnant they hurt just the same as when i was fixing to start my period. pregnancy symptoms are a lot like pms symptoms but remember everyone is different. my sister never had sore boobs when she was pregant and mine lasted until i was 20 weeks.|`|XYcelxEXaa	With my first child, my breasts were the first indicator of pregnancy.  I remember my husband and I walking downtown, and he looked over and commented on how much they "stuck out."  I laughed and agreed with him; and we never imagined it would be a pregnancy thing.  BUT IT WAS!!!<br>  <br>  But the "symptoms" are the same for pregnancy as they are for an upcoming period....just wait for a couple days and see.....<br>  <br>  Also, I am serious about this: when my boobs hurt from pregnancy....it hurts to have the wind blowing across them and moving my clothing....never mind PRESSING DOWN on them (OUCH!!!) |`|s6cP15tFaa	When I had my daugther my boobs were very sore in the beginning, mostly my nipples.

So, maybe the same will happen to you?|`|eDjhI8hkaa	My breasts were more sensitive when I was pregnant, that was actually one of the things that tipped me off and I took a pregnancy test and it was positive.

Some woman can have messed up cycles and end up ovulating sooner or later than others. If you think it's possible that you do then get an ovulation test and see. Good luck|`|BcEuNor6aa	Yes unlikely but it happens.  It happened to me I have a 12 year old little boy because I thought it was "safe" to have unprotected sex at the end of my bleeding..

87IQzOEbaa	Some tips on conceiving are to have sex missionary because if a man ejaculates in you while you are on top there is a chance that the semen can flow back out.<br>  <br>  Also after you have sex to elevate your bottom by propping it up on a pillow or 2 for at least 30 minutes after sex.<br>  <br>  Take prenatal vitiamins before, during and after your pregnancy. So it would be a good idea to start taking those while you are trying to conceive.<br>  <br>  Have sex 3 to 5 days before you ovulate, because sperm can live in you for up to 5 days. <br>  <br>  You can also try having sex in the mornign after you first wake up because it is told that a mans sperm is more potent in the morning.<br>  <br>  Try and be relaxed during sex and try not to think about conceiving when you are having sex. light some candles and play a little music and just relax.

Pick a great man to be the sire of your children, and know him well.  Be sure your relationship is solid, because a pregnancy and a child are not bonding in a marriage, they are divisive.  Make promises to each other that during your pregnancy, you will each strive to keep the hormones and rage out of your conversations.  Don't be a whiner  even when you feel terrible.<br>  <br>  2.  Be on vitamins a year prior to a pregnancy, and under the care of a great obgyn so that you reduce the chances of neuro-tube deficiencies in your baby.  See that doc tomorrow.<br>  <br>  3.  Understand that a child will set you back $250,000 to age 18, that averages about $13,000 per year, less in the beginning years, and more later. and includes nothing but cheap food a tv, computer, and some dope in hs.

Saying you was raped when you wasn't is wrong. It may make you feel better and look better in the churches eyes. But how do you think you will like in GOD's eyes. His eyes are all that matters. And what about the guy. What do you think will happen to him. Just because he is homeless you think you are able to treat him like he is worthless.

If this is true, you cannot falsely accuse the man of rape. Not only is that lying, but it's a serious crime to file a false report and you could face serious penalties if caught. You already weren't honest with your husband and you now see two paths. One involves continually adding more and more lies in order to get away with something. The other is to face the truth.<br>  <br>  Abortion is never the answer to anything. We shouldn't kill children for convenience or to cover up the actions of its parents.<br>  <br>  The tough part is telling your husband the truth. I urge you to do it. Tell him with the admission of wrong-doing. He needs to know you are sorry and regret not only your own actions, but the effect you know you'll have on your husband. It's also important to make it known that the situation helped you learn the consequences of such actions, and that you don't ever want to do it again. Of course you have to mean it, but I think you do. No one wants to hurt the people they love. But lies hurt more than anything, and it's best to clear out the lies as early as possible.<br>  <br>  I learned to tell the truth when I was young. Problems usually just get bigger when people hide them with lies or when they don't let people know about them. Think of it this way, would you rather have a kid that was playing with fire and started the house on fire tell you they started a fire so you know you have to get out, or try to withhold that fact, risking everything?|`|uzHqkXm5aa	This is all asuming that it wasent rape if it was im sorry and good luck<br>  <br>  Sigh...... <br>  <br>  Well you shouldn't lie <br>  <br>  You screwed up big time<br>  <br>  Your a cheater<br>  <br>  Why the hell did you have sex with a homeless guy<br>  <br>  You should admit what you did<br>  <br>   get an abortion (who gives) <br>  <br>  Lieing about being raped is an aw-full crime its just a horrible / unforgivable thing to do.<br>  <br>  If willingly did this tell your husband the truth that you cheated on him and if he is cool about it just let it pass if not move on you screwed up you shouldn't lie about it g you think about things weird.<br>  <br>  In summery it was your disition  (it seems) tell your husband that if he still loves you good luck with that if not well you prob deserve it for cheatunholyu prob want to get an abortion ( No were in the bible it says that its unholly to get one ). DO NOT LIE ABOUT GETTING RAPED AND DO NOT TAKE IT TO CORT. Think how hard it must be  being homeless and you just take him to cort for something you willingley did .<br>  I have much more to add but i dont feel like makeing you feel any worse for doing this just admit you screwed up apollige to your hubby/ beg him for forgiveness  get an abortion and try to move on and forget about it. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  
3QJZqEy7aa	Once you have started feeling movement then the medical profession like to know you have continued to.<br>  <br>  Try drinking a really cold, ice cold drink,  or a cup of coffee (that works with my little one) then lay down flat.  If nothing then I personally would ring my midwife or labour ward.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I believe that it is normal. I think they say that once you are farther along and you can feel the baby VERY well and all the time and it stops then you should be worried. I'm 19 weeks and I only feel the flutters every now and again. I don't think you have to worry. If you are though you can call your doctors to just have the relief of hearing it from a professional. |`|MKg9tsWraa	hi, because the baby is still quite small at 17 weeks u may not feel the flutters every single day, if u are really worried can u ask ur doc to use a doppler and check the heartbeat to reassure u? im sure the little one is fine and just not got big enough feet yet for u to feel those kicks every time. hope this helps :)|`|IVNM1O5naa	It is normal. Dont worry. You are still very early into your pregnancy and the fetus is very small and still has plenty of room to move around in there. You will only feel the flutter/movements every once in a while until you get further along. You may only feel it every couple of days and that is completely normal. It is only in late pregnancy that you want to worry about the movement.|`|LMkj8D8eaa	because your only 15 weeks along, you'll only feel fluttery feelings once in a while, depending on where the baby is...once the weeks go by and baby gets bigger, you'll be able to feel them more often.<br>  <br>  i suggest laying down so ur bellys flat, and than see if u feel anything, (having ur stomach stretch out helps, no idea why)...if that don't work, drink a can or mtn dew--get that little rascal moving!......<br>  <br>  but babies usually sleep most of the day, and are active at night....because through the day, you're most likely active, (which is like a constant swing of motion for them, it lulls them to sleep), and at night, you're most liklely less active, which means time for them to wake up and get the party started! so try feeling tonight also, i bet you'll feel he/she<br>  <br>  also, i'd like to recommend a site for pregnant mommies, www.i-am-pregnant.com, its a site that you can talk to other preggo mommies on, that are in your same week as you, in pregnancy, who help share there advice and tell things that there feeling, etc etc.
MKg9tsWraa	the kits can predict pregnancy but im not sure they would that soon after sex, that would be sooner than a home pregnancy test. however, the positive result u are referring to - is the ovulation line the equivalent to or darker than the control line? as if it is not, two lines can appear at any time in the cycle without actually meaning u are ovulating. it has to be a dark line to be ovulating. hope this helps|`|LGidAYDwaa	No.  Only a home pregnancy test (HPT) or doctor can give you that information, since an entirely different hormone that's tested for with a HPT.<br>  <br>  Good luck, though.

Ma9izYS3aa	It is neither.  And I would be less worried about him being teased when he's young than being not taken seriously as an adult.  That is where the true danger lies.  How about the full name Jerome with Jerzy as the nickname?  That would give you the name you love as a nickname but will be an asset to him in the adult world.  Good luck!|`|F8KmTbqjaa	YES I think that he will be teased.  You can name your child whatever you want though.  I just doubt very many people will like that name!  I sure don't.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	Its neither.  |`|G5B2Dx2Zaa	It's not a name for a person.  It's the nickname for the state of New Jersey or a clothing line, or even a type of clothing.  It's not a name.|`|Tc23KWgzaa	A jersey is a sport uniform.  Another jersey is a type of milk cow.

Also, fair or not, name discrimination is pretty common - most recruiters would toss a resume from "Jerzy."  <br>  <br>  Sorry :(|`|40jlWKL9aa	Umm, I would say boy, but I don't think I would use it. It sounds like a cow (Jersey, Holstein,etc.) Ultimately, it's your decision though, and it's better than Holstein, I guess!!|`|GgPUVe7qaa	If you use it, use it as a boy name and keep in mind that: A. it is a type of cattle and B. it is part of a sport uniform. |`|RtIGiGrkaa	I think its more of a boy name and this is your baby so u name him what u want, but some ppl may tease him. Kids are cruel. And maybe you could use jerzy as his middle name and call him jerzy at home?|`|e2cf497fb8528f8c556d43e9580066c5aa	that sounds ghetto. <br>  it might be like wtvr while he's in school, but it'll look weird on job applications and in the real world. |`|G4qP2gATaa	name your baby whatever you want to!|`|8uvb3Nroaa	Awful for either gender. Why not just use it as a nickname and give your child a proper name? |`|iTWcRnhJaa	It is a boy's name, and it is Polish. The people saying it needs to be spelled 'jersey' are wrong. Jerzy is an actual name and that is its correct spelling. Spelling it differently cheapens the beauty of the european name.<br>  It is lovely. Don't take anyone else's opinions to heart; it is YOUR child. Tell your family that it is not up for vote, and to accept it.|`|VF7IgCQcaa	My SIL likes that name for if she has a girl. I think it's horrible. It sounds like a stripper name at best. Besides, a jersey is something you wear, a wanna be NY state, and a breed of cow. Sorry, just my opinion.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It is your choise. I kind of like it. I don't think it will be teased. I think it sounds more like a girl then a boy.|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	If you spell it Jersey, it could be cute. I don't see it as either specifically a boy's name or girl's name. Do you know what you're having?|`|jaUBFRn1aa	I've never heard of someone with this name and the spelling Jerzy is kinda trailer trash no offence being honest|`|GeGZ9Dy0aa	I think Jerzy is very original..maybe too original tho<br>  ...boy name|`|CTmWS6dMaa	It's a type of cow (Jersey), so I personally wouldn't use it for any gender. |`|vc63QRjgaa	It's a Cute boys Name but take into Consideration that he may be teased...kids are mean these days...|`|PHoK7foOaa	it's not a name. it's an article of clothing.|`|Ir3uRLjHaa	boys name
rQjxxECMaa	It may or may not pick it up.  Depends on when you implanted.  Sometimes it takes until 12 days for implantation after ovulation, but a blood test should be able to pick it up immediately after implantation - is my understanding.  However, many doctor's offices will not run the blood test until you've missed your period or have a positive home pregnancy test.  If they wont make a doctor's appointment for you (some wont have the time to get you in for a few weeks), you should ask them if you can come in to see a nurse just for the blood test so you can confirm the pregnancy....they may still want you to do a home test first, which you may have to wait longer.|`|Rc08VYFtaa	I am not sure a blood test would pick it up now, it seems very early, I would wait until your period is late. (Its hard waiting I know :))) good luck |`|MtC3CWZraa	Why not wait six days and take a home test before spending the extra money for lab work? |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I'm sure you could have a blood test now and it would pick it up. Good luck!
z8Ap4d2jaa	i was raped at age 12 gave birth at 13 i decided i was too young to raise him myself but i still wanted to see him grow, my mom has 3 girls and always wanted a boy so i decided to ask her if she wanted to adopt him, she did and now he is my bro but he doesnt know he is now almost 7 and i think i did the right thing i mean if i would have kept him, he wouldnt have half the life he has now. i love him and plan to tell him when he understands why but i agree adoption is the way to go!!!!!!!! it will make one family really happy!!! and if your friend wants to remain in the childs life you can go open adoption|`|JwD8kxpaaa	Abortion is murder.<br>  <br>  She should have the baby, and put it up for adoption.|`|ixD2RnqTaa	ADOPTION!!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Well I don't agree with abortion no matter what.

XO6NQROmaa	My suggestion is to get to a doctor asap so they can confirm. I am 29 and just found out I was pregnant this past September, first baby, i was soo scared! I still don't know how we're gonna do it, I feel very humbled by this but also I feel blessed, it took time for the initial negative feelings to dissipate, but I would NEVER terminate a pregnancy that's not up to me to do so. When God gives us children, He also will provide for them too! Money is a scary thought, but we simply just gotta trust God. If you are pregnant these thoughts you're having will change in a little while, I believe you will be fine. I thank God every night for providing everything for us and for our child and He is! Just today we found a wonderful place to live big enough for the three of us, after it looked like there were none left in the city! lol. You're gonna be just fine! If you are looking for other ways of making money, my hubby and I have a business that is expanding all over the world, if you want more info here's the website...<br>  <br>  www.bquadrantsolutions.com     <br>  <br>  Take care!<br>  |`|DDQ7USGYaa	No pregnancy experience here but I've always heard the age old saying: "A negative can be a positive but a positive can't be a negative."

Is your period late?  I'm sorry you don't feel ready for another baby now.  Test again or go to a doctor for a blood test, but prepare yourself either way.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|gFiRi5xnaa	Sometimes pregnancies can go all 9 months without a single symptom except for a growing baby. Good luck.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	When I found out I was pregnant I had no symptoms for about two weeks. I just had a feeling that I should take a test and it was positive. So I think it can happen. |`|i6mydMOyaa	Then you should have been more careful.<br>  <br>  Things will work out, they always do.|`|F7zWuy2waa	I didn't have any symptoms til about 12 weeks, its not that unusual.  I felt the same when I fell pregnant with my 2nd.  Turned out to be the best thing that could happen though, my kids are very close. Your son having a sibling to play with might free up a bit more of your time.  And about the money, you will probably find that because you've been through all this recently it costs you a lot less than the first child did.  |`|w0eRRsoVaa	Not everyone has pregnancy symptoms other than a missed period.  Make an appointment with your doctor and go from there.  The good thing about it is you have round about 8 months to prep for the arrival of a child so taking on a job or finding a better paying one is an option.<br>  <br>  I know it would be a shock if you are but you'll have to wrap your head around it somehow if it's positive.  Overwhelming yes, scary yes, unplanned yes, but your 20 month old will at least be a shy over 2 before this ones born should you choose to keep it.  Sometimes having a part time job will give you some adult sanity back in your life as well as some extra cash and no, it won't be taking anything away from your children.<br>  <br>  If by some chance you have a chemical pregnancy (HCG but no real baby) then I'd recommend switching your birth control.|`|Coc593Ikaa	Many women don't have any symptoms when they test positive...I didn't. Not a single one.|`|AA11756768	The 99.9% accuracy they advertise on the box is for a positive result so there is only a very very tiny chance it could be wrong. Just because you haven't had any symptoms yet doesn't mean you won't. So now is probably the time to go to the dr to verify you are pregnant and start deciding on what you want to do. |`|ErCJnABBaa	Given that an pregnancy test SHOULD only react to the presence of HCG in your urine, and the only way for HCG to get into your urine is if you are pregnant, the only chance that the BFP is wrong would be because of a manufacturing defect.|`|24e08edff6a7f457ff2fc915564d7ef8aa	If you have a positive result then you are pregnant. Just because you don't have symptoms doesn't mean that you aren't pregnant. |`|FaB2v37Aaa	False positives are highly unlikely.  
nkIH17Poaa	It is not normal to pass clots in pregnancy.  I am very sorry.  You really need to have another sonogram.  It sounds like you probably passed everything, but a sonogram in needed to confirm that.<br>  <br>  There is always a chance that it was not a miscarriage, but unfortunately, what you are describing sounds ominous.  Please call your doc and insist on being seen right away.<br>  |`|ioZeveazaa	I hate to say this but it sounds very possible that you miscarried. You need to go to the ER ASAP! I cannot emphasize that enough. If you are cramping and bleeding that much blood, something is up. I wish you all the best. Good luck!|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	call  the hospital sweetie i lost a baby at 10wks 5 days and sadly started a lot like what u are going through :-( <br>  you need to know NOW or u are gonna drive urself crazy<br>  good luck u will be in my thoughts x|`|jQDeTTVhaa	it sounds like a miscarriage to me I have never experienced that and I dont think its normal.I mean some light bleeding yes but not heavy.|`|5X6C4s7zaa	I am so sorry that you are going through this, I just went through a  similar situation.  Started spotting at 13 weeks and 2 days, 2 days later turned to actual bleeding, was going back and forth to the doctor and ER all blood work and ultrasounds were normal, we kept hoping that the bleeding would stop on its own.  At 14 weeks I started having sharp pains in my abdomen that would come and go, by the next day I was in such excruciating pain that I went to the ER, did two more ultrasounds and the baby still looked fine but at 14 weeks 2days the ultrasound showed that my cervix was completely dilated and blood work showed that I had an infection so they had to terminate for medical reasons.  Anytime you have pain and clotting it is not a good sign, go to the ER immediately and make sure that everything is okay, I know how stressful this is but I wish you the best of luck and will be praying that you have a better outcome than I did.<br>  |`|FSPAKELyaa	i bled with this baby from week 4 to week 17 sometimes heavy and sometimes red, they told me not to be too concerend unless i had pain or clots.<br>  a golf ball size clot is quite big. id go in and demand a scan if i were you. good luck with baby i really hope its okay|`|ubkt5RQiaa	You could still be ok.  I had a subchorionic hemorrhage and bled and cramped a lot but everything turned out ok, and it healed on it's own.  However, with passing a clot that large, I would go in if I were you.  I can't believe your dr is making you wait that long - I would be switching drs!  Good luck.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Honestly you should have taken a picture of the clot so that you could show the doctor. I would go to the ER immediately! I think it sounds like a miscarriage and you need to find out. I am so sorry that you are going through this. |`|eo6Sb2rEaa	Well it's easy for the doc to tell you to just wait,,but I'm sure for your own peace of mind you need to know..I would go to the ER.  It could be nothing and a rough pregnancy,,or it maybe not.. you should find out.  |`|Rc08VYFtaa	Please go to the hospital for your own peace of mind, you shouldn't wait two more weeks to find out if everything is ok, I am thinking of you and sending prayers and best wishes:)|`|lQORNmNiaa	Go to the ER.  It sounds very much like you've miscarried.  Your "doctor" should be punished for not taking your symptoms seriously.  Take care of yourself first, then report that horrible quack!<br>  <br>  My sympathies and best wishes...|`|4ztXoIDKaa	If I were you I would go to the ER and get another ultrasound or have them listen with the doppler.  I have never heard of anyone bleeding|`|ixD2RnqTaa	Awww. im so sorry..it sounds like you have miscarried. Please dont wait to go to the er. go now!|`|rDPADat1aa	I'd call the doctor back and tell him it got worse!  Blood clots aren't a good thing.  If he still tells you to "wait," then go to the ER.  You need to know if something is wrong or if everything is okay.  After that, please lay down and get off your feet.  It may help you slow the bleeding.<br>  <br>  Good luck and let us know how it goes!|`|8tJSvEoSaa	Go to the ER. There is a possibility you have miscarried, and certainly the stress of not knowing is not going to help the situation. Best of luck.|`|2HxkkLK5aa	Wow huh. . . i am 8 weeks pregnant now i've been bleeding for over a week now i know how you feel it is very scary. I started with brown blood and recently turned red with blood clots however, i am not bleeding quit as much as you are but it seems to me about the same thing. when i went to the ER it showed the same thing as you good heart beat a baby and yoke sac everything appeared to be normal. I am freaked out myself i actually just possed a question about this myself. The doctor told me to stay off my feet and get alot of rest and drink fluids. if you feel the need i would go to the ER i am seriously considering this myself. I hope everthing goes well im sorry to hear this i know how you feel. GOOD LUCK!! please keep me posted.|`|Wacdp4Msaa	SCREW YOUR DOCTOR HE"S AN IDIOT!!!! Go to the ER NOW! If you haven't miscarried threes a good chance that you might! I also wouldn't worry about bright red blood.. have you have sex any time before that? That happened to me to and the doctor said i broke a blood vessel. But the large blood clot is not normal. I know this sounds gross but if you still can go and get it out of the toilet and bring it with you. If its just a blood clot, they can treat you. Otherwise they c can run tests and may be able to telll you from the fetus why you miscarried.<br>  <br>  Also if you did don't fell bad hunny. It is your bodies natural way of telling you that something wasn't going rigth with  the fetus. Im sure it is very very hard, but when your ready and you have grieved maybe you can try again The odds of 2 in a row are pretty rare.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK! And by the way i would change your doctor too....|`|rl1IITqRaa	i am in almost the same exact situation (read my past questions!) i am so so so sorry i know how hard it is. i am practically in tears reading this! i still have not received any answers in regards to my problem, i go for my 2nd hcg blood test tomorrow. i will find out if i am still pregnant tomorrow.<br>  <br>  go to the er immediately. they will give you an ultrasound and give you the answers you need. <br>  <br>  if you need to talk you can feel free to email me!!
qYvDpa6daa	studies are now showing that drinkin a small amount ( im not quite sure how much) during pregnancy is actually good studies have shown that it decreases the chances of your baby being hyporactive when there older its not bad to have one glas of wine monthly as long as ur not drinking everyday or a hole bottle of wine in one night it should be fine good luck |`|0LCJuBA8aa	im a month pregnant and i just stopped, but i didnt know i was pregnant. my baby is supposedly healthy so i guess its fine. im trying to limit myself to once a week. lol im sure once a month wont do any harm to your child. if you are truly worried then dont, but its perfectly safe as long as you dont get completely wasted. congrats! :)|`|mJm6VuwGaa	I don't think it's cruel or dangerous.  I was told I can have a glass of wine once in a while.  I would limit it to maybe a half a glass and only once in a while.  |`|w0eRRsoVaa	No.  The French have done a study on it actually proving quite the contrary so long as it's just a glass of wine and never more than once a week.|`|yIdgG8b1aa	There is a big thing about this on T.V here in the U.K at the moment about how 1 or 2 glasses o wine is ok infact good for the baby. They are saying if you have a girl they will be less emotional and with a boy less aggressive.Personallyy i don't believe it can be "good" for the baby but if its in moderation i dont think it is bad either. I know i will get a thumbs down for this but i have ONE glass at the weekend and if i am out for a meal then maybe 2 but i never go over what my midwife has told me isn't allowed. I dont think you should drink in your first trimester and i am not going to say  you should drink at all because we all know it isn't healthy even when you are not pregnant and its always best to be safe than sorry with FAS but i don't look down on it like so many do. How ever getting drunk is out of the question and i would never do that. But 9 months is a long timeespeciallyy for a women like me who does enjoy her wine lol|`|jBnQiZVFaa	It is not cruel and not dangerous.  They actually came out with studies that show absolutely no difference between the children of those who drank one drink per week and those who did not drink anything. It is a personal choice and you should do what you feel is right for you.|`|Z6lhZiXsaa	Ask your doctor. Some will say a glass of wine occasionally is fine, or even beneficial to the baby. It can help you reduce your stress which is good for the baby. I'm not a doctor though, and I wouldn't risk it myself. Find another way to relax. Maybe take a bubble bath?|`|dgPJWwtOaa	that depends what society u r in.  in europe for instance the midwife and dr, encouraged me to drink an occasional glass of wine to help me relax.  that doesn't mean tip the bottle every day.....LOL<br>  if u drink one a month it shouldn't be a prob.....<br>  |`|ubkt5RQiaa	It could cause damage.  Nobody truly knows the amount that is safe or unsafe, but why risk it for one glass of wine a month?  Who knows - you could drink it at the time where something is developing and it could cause a problem.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I think both. Doctors tell you not even to drink cold syrup when you are pregnant because of the alcohol. Think about your baby. Don't drink during pregnancy!|`|IGZHdvyqaa	Probably not going to cause damage but is it worth the risk? |`|F98c1ZMgaa	both|`|EWDpwe9waa	well a glass a month I dont think so because it takes a lil more then that to intoxicate the body! actually its embarassing to say but my wife didnt know she was pregnant and she was like 4 months and me and her use to go out and drink and have a good time untill we found out and my baby girl is 2 now and shes perfectly fine....I think the additives in food and stuff like that or the air we breathe in is more harmfull then a glass of wine every month!|`|yusoItg9aa	The only real answer is that nobody knows for sure.  However, common sense and anecdotal evidence suggests that an occasional drink is probably fine.  It's a risk, but we don't know how much of a risk.  In North America the dirty looks you get from people often prevent it anyway.  My doctor told me that there have been cases where women had FAS kids and swore they only had one drink, but then he said that could be "an error in reporting" (meaning, they're lying and probably didn't mention the coke they snorted at the same time).  Stick to red or white wine, maybe a spritzer, and all should be fine.  Just don't over do it.|`|gSRV2mFAaa	I think it has to do with your body and the baby.  Is your baby genetically predisposed to be affected by FAS?  For me it really isn't worth it to drink and run that chance.  I would rather drink grape juice and take a bath.  =)|`|sRjURY43aa	i think it is. If you have wine only a little bit during your pregnancy i think it will be fine. But monthly?! That will probably hurt the baby in the end.|`|pXGl0Uh8aa	I would not drink if you know your pregnant just incase it could hurt the baby |`|N3QGyep6aa	 a glass of wine monthy is most likely not going to hurt.. just as long as your not getting wasted or even tipsy.|`|IRB9OVvuaa	Towards the end I don't think so, I asked my doctor and he sad it was ok and it wouldn't be any harm!|`|a11810dedcef49b4ee5c4f8c624bb39eaa	I can only speak from my own experience. I had a glass or 2 of red once a month or so when I was pregnant. My daughter was born a very healthy 8lb1oz and 17 months on she is above average in everything. She walked from 10 months and is so vocal and verbal she is at least 4-5 months ahead. Now, Im not saying you should go drink, thats a decision only u can make, but I really don't think the very odd glass wil hurt at all |`|jQDeTTVhaa	yes I think so
AA12033653	It took me 2 years, I had a lot going against me.  I am overweight and my Hubby is 45.  |`|gx4s68s8aa	With my first- two months of really trying (charting my cycle etc)  before that we were just "letting things happen"  and we did that for a year or so.<br>  <br>  Now I am pregnant with baby #2 and we weren't trying at all.|`|tivpa7Vlaa	been on birth controls for 8yrs and it took me 3mths to get pregnant. took 2mths for the birth controls to wear off and by the 3rd mth i ovulated and got pregnant on the first egg released i didnt even have a chance to have a period. i was on seasonel(4 periods a yr) by the way. now 9mths preg with a boy my 1st baby. good luck to u..|`|o2YHnKXiaa	It took me about 2 months to get pregnant I tried so hard and they told me my boyfriends sperm wasn't able to get me pregnant I was so bummed up come to find out we had sex alot and than one day I was pregnant and the doctor told him they got the wrong test results Oh boy I was thrilled. Now I have a cute 3 month old little boy and I couldn't ask for me.|`|2ZoUduoPaa	It took my husband and I two very long years.  I can't help but laugh now when women talk about 6 mos being torture... 2 years almost killed me...LOL.  I know when you are trying to get pregnant every month that goes by is torture.  I am happy, elated actually, to say that I am now 36 weeks pregnant with our first child!!!  I just hope next time it doesn't take as long to get pregnant as it did the first time.  Because if it does, we might as well start trying after this one gets here...LOL...<br>  <br>  Good luck to you whether you're TTC or already pregnant!!!!|`|EmYNUZcXaa	3 months but everyone is different. g'luck!!|`|FgAPXhVRaa	We were not even trying and got pregnant... we are blessed!  :)|`|pw8T1ISnaa	With my first marriage we had a miscarriage in the first year of marriage and then two years later I was on the patch and got pregnant with are first daughter I was17 and he 19.

I never planned it but it just happened. I have also been told I could not get pregnant to much scaring, and I had cervical cancer.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Its somewhere between 20% - 30%.  I can't recall the exact number, but I think its closer to 30%.<br>  <br>  I got pregnant, all three times, practically immediately.  I had sex near or during ovulation and *boom*, I was pregnant.  I'm a fertile myrtle and my husband has "super sperm"!  lol|`|AA11820380	We tried in August and nothing then we only had sex 2 days in September, the day of ovulation and the day after and I got pregnant.|`|EpfVsCa2aa	It took me almost a year with my 2nd baby, some get pregnant right away and some it takes a while.|`|DYJOpfvraa	First baby- 1st try<br>  Second baby (and current pregnancy)- 2nd try|`|rah0z4Rpaa	14 months of trying|`|pp9RzHvDaa	I got pregnant the first month of trying!

No luck yet.  I have a friend who gets pregnant so fast that all she has to do is think about it and it happens almost.  Life can seen so unfair at times.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It took me and my husband 2 1/2 years. I got pregnant using clomid and the clear blue easy fertility monitor after one cycle.|`|OuGTC2yMaa	I've always read that there's about a 20 percent chance each month.  We got pregnant after about 4 months, and it was when we least expected it to happen.  Good luck and baby dust!|`|hByHJI2Caa	Yes, 20% chance.  My first baby took 9 months of trying before I got pregnant.  And the 2nd time, it only took 4 months.  |`|dy34Qyugaa	I didn't get pregnant the first month of trying, but the second month worked.|`|O5WberWnaa	i had a m/c in april this year and i found out i was pregnant early august.<br>  im nearly 17wks with no5|`|gVn4oA9iaa	It only took 2 times for me.|`|RmopZbXWaa	It took us about four/five years. My husband and I were just determined to conceive without the use of any fertility treatments. That's why it took so long. But it paid off!!
C45XkYMIaa	I suggest you speak with your parents. It might be really hard to bring it up, but they are the people that are responsible for unconditionally loving you and supporting you through this difficult decision.|`|7AYnWg3paa	i am 19 and a freshman in college as well...(pregnant)but i decided to keep my baby...if u are having second thoughts now it could mean that if u go through with the abortion u might feel regret afterwards...this baby could be the best thing that ever happened to u....thats how i see it...and im just glad im not in high school anymore...and im excited about it.....but u have to decide what u want and dont let ure boyfriend or family, friends decide for u....if they are that is...oh and i am still attending college and plan on getting a degree ....dont listen to people who say a baby can stop u from getting an education like BRI......that baby can make u work harder to succeed if anything..babies dont always RUIN lives is what im trying to say..they should not be considered a burden|`|9dqZqyPbaa	hmmm|`|ajHa9Dseaa	Get the abortion while you still can... its best for all parties concidered. You're too young to have a child and having one now is going to make it harder for the child too, you want to bring a child into a world where you can provide for it and not one where you will be at work and school most of the day. <br>  <br>  Abortions can be dangerous so find a good clinic with experienced and well trained doctors to do the procedure and don't listen to what some stupid menopausal religious fanatic has to say about the fetus having feelings and what not.<br>  <br>  You will be much happier when you do have a child at the right time in your life.|`|QPKgc1xJaa	I'm glad your having second thoughts because your first thought is the wrong one. Any man that would help talk you into this decision isn't a man at all. Trust in the Lord and lean not on your own understanding.|`|Sucivxykaa	Well it's all up to you.  I'm pro-choice, and if you feel that your not ready to have a baby yet, its okay.  A baby would mess up your college experience.|`|2052689f97fd82ff22110a85457f0dedaa	Congratulations. Now grow up!|`|c8tyG5z3aa	I'm against abortion (under certain situations) so I'm proud of you for thinking otherwise. If you really don't want to go through with it, don't let him talk you into it. Even though it's both of yours baby, it's your body.<br>  <br>  You really only have 3 options. <br>  1) abortion like you said :( <br>  2) adoption<br>  3) keep it and take care of it.<br>  <br>  It's not up to us, it's up to you. It's your baby, do what YOU think is right.|`|PRpesJOhaa	I am pro-choice, so I am not going to get ugly with you like others have. BUT...you need to find other girls who have gone through abortions to see what they say about the procedure, about the guilt, about the process. It is NOT a simple procedure. It is NOT something that you go through without some kind of lingering affect. It will probably haunt you forever.<br>  <br>  Adoption is a beautiful thing and YOU get to choose your baby's partents. Most adoptions are open these days, so you will (if you choose to) always be in your child's life in one way or another. <br>  <br>  Or, you can tough it out and be the best mom your baby could ever have. Love him or her, sacrifice for him or her, nurture for him or her, and simply be a terrific mom. <br>  <br>  Bless you, sweetie. I hope you do the right thing. Good luck.<br>  <br>  Auntie Anna|`|th9iHEL7aa	In America, in some states, parents can get their child back after a child has been adopted.  SO put the baby up for adoption knowing you can get it back from its nice family and then find out it was never adopted because you could do that.  Now the child has no family and is just an orphan.  Be responsible for you own actions.  Selfish|`|9dO5jV8yaa	thats a hard one... think hard about it.... do what is best for you, I went thru the same thing when I was a freshman and we decided it was best for us to not have the baby... but really its your call... and don't let ******* calling you names have any baring on YOUR CHOICE|`|pRDuEqEpaa	I would have an abortion. If you have the kid now, you will loose everything you have worked for right now. You won't be able to get a college degree. Sorry, but that is the only choice if you want your degree.|`|WwafMKN4aa	don't have an abortion. if you wanna keep your baby then keep it. if you cant then give it up for adoption..but don't have an abortion! don't murder an innocent baby!|`|DsojxUJtaa	Tell your bf and maybe he will marry you. If not use abortion as a last resort.  I was in the same situation and kept my little girl. i love her and i just graduated college just fine. |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I definitely don't think you should murder your baby. |`|HT40wfP3aa	Abortion, or you will not finish college and you will screw up the rest of your life.<br>  <br>  That said, I had a girlfriend who aborted a pregnancy and she was loopy about it for years - I don't know if she would do that if she had the chance to do it all over again. That said, she didn't have the baby and is now a full fledged doctor, something that would have NOT happened if she had the baby ...<br>  <br>  Tough choice, I do not envy you.|`|vXFuaVLJaa	Tell him you don't want an abortion. Taking care of a baby is a lot of hard work, but it's not something that you ever regret. I'm only 17, pregnant, and that alone is pretty hard, but I feel like I actually have something to live for now! I still have plans to go to college and get a good career, a very good one actually. This baby isn't going to slow me down, I have more motivation to actually get it done, for him and for me. If your bf doesn't like it, that's his problem, but you do have a choice. Whether or not he stays with you, I would keep the baby.|`|13Zoslh4aa	Please consider this very carefully.  I too was pregnant in college.  It was very challenging but so worth while.  One day when you're older and more settled, you'll either look at your child and be so thankful you made the right decision or you'll be filled with a regret so piercing it's intolerable.  My baby just turned 11 and i now have a 10 month old who absolutely adores his big brother and whose life wouldn't be complete without him.  I did graduate but it took a lot of determination.  You can do it.  |`|zGomzpHfaa	You can ask this question online and recieve many opinions (including hate messages, "i told you so" and etc) but ultimately the decision is yours. <br>  <br>  I suggest that you go to a teen pregnancy counseling center since they offer information on what you can do with your pregnancy, the risks, the outcome and the hardships you may face with whatever decision you make. <br>  <br>  It maybe embarrasing to go, but hey its two lives we are talking about, you and your baby. So definitely find PROFESSIONAL counseling, not here. They know what they are talking about. Also whatever decision you make, just know you made the right one and be sure to have your boyfriend comes with you. He needs to know whats going on since he got you pregnant and that you both won't regret your decision making. |`|wNpJgXauaa	I was in the same situation as you.  I found out my freshman year of college that I was pregnant, and I decided to have the baby.  She is now seven years old, and I thank God everyday that I had her.<br>  <br>  For the person that said this child will, "...screw up your life..." and you "...won't be able to finish college..."  Let me just say that's complete bull.  Although it took me a little while longer to finish, I have a bachelor of science in Nursing, and I have a masters degree in social work.  <br>  <br>  Keep your head up, follow your heart.  Either way, you'll get through it.  Good luck!|`|wRSQ8LDqaa	It is your choice, but you have to think about what's going to happen later in life if you choose to abort.  Are you going to have questions like, what would my baby look like?  What would my baby be doing now at this time.  There are plenty of women who complete college while pregnant and even after having a child.  There are more options.  Abortion should not be one of them.  Just because you and your boyfriend made a mistake, don't make your child pay for it.|`|5BgLAxfyaa	how many weeks are you? you know you can't do it after 6 wks.<br>  it is your decision. many ppl become afraid that they won't be able to take care of their baby, so that is why they get rid of him/her...<br>  you can do it. your family will help...the guy may stick around...the govt will help if you need it. you can still b young and go to college. your life won't be over. you are pregnant for a reason. your life will never be the same...no matter the outcome. this is the beginning of a new chapter of your life. what will you do. i know you are here for answers...but what will you do. you need to talk to your family.|`|eOoAmsGNaa	I think that you should keep your baby.  I am 26 years old and I wasn't ready.  You will never be ready, whether your 26 or 18.  You can always finish school.  A baby doesn't STOP your life, its just a minor set back, but you will see that it will all work out in the end.  If you boyfriend is pressuring you to have an abortion, remember this is your body and this is a life.  |`|6vprgSIRaa	I got pregnant just like you did. My daughter's father was/is still around and he supported me completely. We have been together for 6 yrs. I still finished school and have a happy home. If you have someone to support you, good, but don't get rid or your baby even if you dont. Having kids is a blessing. I am on child #2. (15wks) You never know who that baby will grow up to be. Is your family supportive?? |`|2VONF105aa	Hi, First things, I think you should sit down discuss this with your boyfriend and/or your Doctor and weigh up your options, then see how you feel then. <br>  Its hard decision to make and it will be hard after no matter what the conclusion is.<br>  <br>  Be Safe|`|io24WNeHaa	do not let these fools put u down and call you name. the choice is yours and bf.

I know that nipple pain was probably my first symptom I experienced.

FLOjzbKEaa	Oh yes.  I think it is.  Good luck and hope you are.  Test when you will miss periods.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It is totally possible that you experienced implantation bleeding. That is usually what it looks like. Good luck. Let me know if you are. |`|so187y7aaa	What does implantation bleeding or spotting look like?<br>  Implantation bleeding, also called implantation spotting, does not look like a regular menstrual period. Implantation bleeding is scanty and usually pink or brownish discharge. <br>  <br>  Implantation bleeding or menstrual period?<br>  Implantation bleeding normally occurs a week to a few days before your period would normally start. Spotting that occurs around a week after ovulation is likely implantation bleeding; whereas, spotting that occurs very close to the time that your period would normally start may not be. A normal menstrual cycle generally starts off light and then gets heavier. Spotting can sometimes be the sign of an early period. If this is the case, the spotting will pick up to heavier bleeding. If you have spotting right around the time your period would normally start, it can be more confusing. You will need to take the wait and see approach or take a pregnancy test to determine pregnancy.<br>  <br>  What if I feel like my period is about to start?<br>  If you have had spotting and think it might be implantation bleeding you may be paying very close attention to your body. If you are trying to get pregnant, the good news is that early pregnancy symptoms feel very similar to the start of your period. If you are pregnant you may begin to notice symptoms of early pregnancy right around the time your period would normally start and sometimes sooner than that. If you suspect pregnancy you can test for pregnancy as early as ten days after ovulation.<br>  <br>  How common is implantation bleeding? <br>  Implantation bleeding is fairly common with pregnancy. Twenty to thirty percent of women will have spotting during early pregnancy. If you have some light spotting before your period would normally start this is not something to worry about and may be a sign of pregnancy.<br>  
Cckl6aNxaa	It all depends how far along you are. In the first months of my pregnancy i always had an upset stomach and was extremely nauseous... and about 4-6 months it got better and i ate anything i could get my hands on. By eight months i started getting sick to my stomach again. I hear it happens because as the baby grows it pushes your digestive organs all over the place in order to find room, but if you really are worried it is always best to check with your OBGYN. <br>  <br>  Good luck with your pregnancy!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I've experienced all those as well. Back pains I was told are caused from your belly stretching and pulling on ligaments. And it is very common to feel sick and then to feel fine the next second. 
slzx5202aa	I took a pregnancy test a week after my missed period and it was a false negative so i took another one a week later and it was positive : )|`|uO47mDSSaa	2 weeks late my friend suggested i get a test so she was there when i did the first thank god i almost passed out when both lines were bright purple (Dollar test) Did 2 more Friday  (Dollar tests) Saturday another 2 Then sunday i did 2 digital tests for my boyfriend. It was nice to see the word pregnant. |`|K1zKw8QVaa	With my first pregnancy I got a positive the day I missed my period.

ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	That is a good sign. That could be implantation bleeding, which is usually brown and light. I would take a test. Good luck and Congrats if you are. You'll have to let me know.

Good luck with everything!|`|Ol2S1ZiMaa	Your spotting could be implantation  bleeding! You need to take a home pregnancy test! Good Luck!
hJwheleJaa	Yes, you still could be. A lot of times, it's just too early for the test to pick up the hormone. I got a false negative once, so I waited a few more days and sure enough I was preggo! However, you might not be. It could be something else. I'd wait a few more days, test again, and then call a doc if you still havent gotten your period. Thye might know what is going on.|`|H74F8jxuaa	Could be that you don't have enough of the pregnancy hormone in your urine.  I would suggest getting a blood test done to confirm.  Best of luck.|`|3CG3rby0aa	It took me until i was six weeks along to get a positive answer from the hpt.  just wait and re-test in a week.  yes you can be pregnant and it come out negative cause you hcg hormone ain't high enough in your body yet.  good luck!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It is possible to get false negatives. I would wait another week and take another test. If by then you still haven't started I would schedule an appointment with your doctor and see if maybe they'll give you a blood test or atleast see what could be causing you to be so late. Good luck|`|flOOmBiGaa	hmm... go to the doctor and get blood test, that should tell you for sure, my personal opinion is that they are girly problems, but you want to be certain... the best of luck!|`|HntAuUW3aa	take a test and see if you are pregnant|`|Nmh0BZ2Eaa	If you were taking birth control it will take a while for your body to get back to normal. Just take another test and see if you could be pregnant.When you are trying to conceive the best thing to do is to start taking parental vitamins to get your body ready for baby so that your body can be healthy when its born. good luck.|`|NF2nBRF8aa	ahh the same thing happened to me last month girl! EXACT SAME THING! well guess what?<br>  <br>  My period was 22 days late!!!<br>  <br>  negative results- dont worry your answer is clear:<br>  <br>  time to go buy some tampons!!!! :)
Jj0pdpWIaa	I answered some else that had the brownish blood.And it was not pregnancy. You don't state how far along you think you could be.I would take the test and then again in a couple of weeks.And also I would see a doctor.It could be stress or something else.Have you had tender breast.Or being peeing a lot and extreme tiredness.All these are signs of pregnancy.See a doc and good luck to you.|`|HkeqaxAzaa	Yes it should be a good time to take a pregnancy test. If you still have no period within 2 weeks, take another, and yes if you are not pregnanct ask your doctor, it can be an infection, but it also could be your pills. Hope this helps!|`|ac7bbc87e9de98523996acb0daf60f91aa	You wouldnt be pregnant already if you had sex last night. |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I would call your doctor. Can you have that so soon after?|`|p0mczaAsaa	If you haven't missed any pills then there is only a really slight chance you're pregnant. Spotting between periods is possible. Yes definitely see your gynecologist in case your birth control pills aren't compatible with your body and to ask about the spotting.|`|0c3BCEzHaa	I think you're just about to have your period! But if your a bit wary then consulting your OB-Gyne is a very good idea. |`|ZAGezocxaa	idk, i would wait like 2 weeks for a pregnancy test.|`|XthaBC8jaa	Go see the doctor asap!|`|315d98c9016e801b44bab5bf502467eaaa	see a doctor|`|KjY2pANcaa	Well if you dont want to be pregnant I hope youre not<br>  but Yeah the Pill is NOT 100 percent effective only abstenince is<br>  I hope this scares you not to have sex until your married<br>  |`|Jl8hQr6Aaa	doctorrrr
mZzQQUABaa	did it!!!!! hahahahahahaha!!<br>  <br>  Take it in 4-5 days!|`|gP2lgeFHaa	You can take a test now - the at-home and dr's office tests are both very sensitive. <br>  <br>  If your periods have been irregular, I would also recommend taking another test in 1 week if this one comes up negative - just to be sure. <br>  <br>  I put in a link to reviews of different tests - if you have any questions.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Zy07f0Zwaa	Yes take a test now =] I am assuming you are late already!!<br>  <br>  Good luck xx |`|TFdhL7LKaa	Take a pregnancy test now...... I don't understand why everyone is telling you to wait. You will get a reliable result. By the looks of the dates you have a very high chance of being pregnant. Good Luck =)|`|8JOX76EDaa	take another one now. it cant hurt. and if you are pregnant you should be just far enough along for it to show up.<br>  <br>  God bless and i hope you get the results your hoping for|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I would wait another week just to be sure. |`|Me5P0R1uaa	Just to let you know, stress can only delay ovulation not your period. Your luteal phase (time after O to your next period) is always the same amount of days. You could ovulate late due to stress and if your luteal phase is 14 days (it will be 14 days every month differing only maybe by a day) then from the time you ovulated to your period will be 14 days. Do you know when you ovulated because it would help a lot. Good luck|`|KqZBHrLQaa	yes you can take it now it only takes eight days to get pregnant so you could have known back in october when you didnt get it|`|JQiGdbpzaa	take a test good luck|`|BvFnuDUWaa	wait 6 more days :)|`|vAzl2wg5aa	u can take one 2 weeks after u conceived
F9AiIcVfaa	im 17 weeks and i have been having crazy dreams the last few nights. this is my second tho and i dont remember any dreams with my first. i dont think they go away but i think they will die down the farther we get in our pregnancies. |`|eSS8pgDiaa	This will stopping bad dream<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPnGPIMUnus" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPnGPIMUn...</a>|`|cf60728a145c5cebd75177083d6b6f8eaa	I am on my 4th child and I had the craziest dreams when I was pregnant, with my 1st I was sooooo worried about the epidural that I dreamed about a stuffed stork with one of those buttons you push for it to make sounds had the needle attached and the tag read "push for epidural" crazy right? Look on the bright side at least they aren't nightmares. Good luck.....try to get some rest :)|`|Iqifd3SGaa	I get a lot of weird and crazy dreams also. For a period of time I was getting really bad nightmares too and I haven't had a nightmare in a long time. When you are pregnant your dreams are more livid so it is perfectly normal. It will probably last till you have the baby. |`|5OuDKVKJaa	Yeah they r normal,i would even wake myself up crying some nights. I even asked my dr about them because i thought it may b the prenatal vitamins....but it wasn't he said its just hormones. good luck hope they pass for u soon.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Yeah it is completely normal. Tons of women experience that during pregnancy. Congrats!|`|p0jBpQBZaa	Its normal but there's no guarantee about how long it'll last. I'm 14 wks too and I've been having crazy and very vivid dreams since about 8 weeks. |`|6us9XCKsaa	this very normal during pregnancy they can last the whole time just try to get some rest and best wishes to you and baby
ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	By being healthy. Do everything the doctors tell you and always take your prenatal vitamins. |`|0iUxfCMcaa	? with what? is there something wrong with it? what are you asking?|`|GjuRYsITaa	elaborate|`|kQf2XAKiaa	Show love and comfort to the belly!
3QJZqEy7aa	It isn't 100% every time,  you only need look at the amount of time it takes, on average for a couple to conceive.  Every month you have unprotected sex throughout the cycle there is a 20-30% chance of becoming pregnant,  but that is very average and depends on the health of you both,  your ages, your general fertility etc etc.  When me and my partner first tried to get pregnant,  we only had sex once and I fell pregnant (sadly I miscarried) but the same thing happened on our second attempt, this time round it took years (probably because we are that much older.  <br>  <br>  You are not asking too much for it too be special,  but can't you use some other form of contraception ie the pill?  the cap?  surely if you don't want to start a family straight after getting married and you aren't keen on condoms you need to look at some other form of contraception and personally I didn't particularly enjoy it first time around anyway and a condom would not have made any difference to that.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Will she be using some other method of contracpetion?  If she'll be on a reliable female method (pills, ring, patch, implant, natural family planning,  etc.) then you don't really need to use a condom.  The risk of pregnancy would be very low. <br>  <br>  If she will not be on birth control, then yes, unless you are willing to risk pregnancy, you need to wear a condom.  Of course pregnancy doesn't happen every time (if it did, there would be no 'trying to conceive' board here), but it's always possible. <br>  <br>  As for your last question -- if you love her, sex will be 'special' regardless of whether or not  you're wearing a condom. (But if she's terrified of getting pregnant, it WON'T be special ... so oblige her.)|`|H74F8jxuaa	She should get on birth control, that way you don't have to worry as much about getting pregnant.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It's not 100% every time. In order for her to get pregnant she would have to be a few days from ovulating or she would have to be ovulating on the day you have sex. I know you want to be special for her on your wedding not but you also have to be aware that it can happen if you have unprotected sex and you have to be ready to face the consequences if she does happen to get pregnant. Good luck and Congrats on the wedding!|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	It doesn't happen EVERY time...but yes, anytime you have unprotected sex, a pregnancy is a possibility.<br>  <br>  You know, there are other ways to prevent pregnancy besides a male condom.  It might be wise to check out your other options.|`|aKiynqA6aa	she should get on birth control if she's worried about it.  it's not guaranteed pregnancy, but if she's not ready then why risk it.|`|48BM0yKGaa	That's awesome that you want her first time to be special. But it can b special with a condom as well. I know " you probably hate condoms" But if she's worried about getting pregnant her first time maybe she should go to the doctor to be put on some from of birth control. Pills aren't her only option either. There's he depo-shot, they have IUD's that last for 5 years. It's not a 100% that she will get pregnant every time you have unprotected sex but the chances are high sometimes. Especially if you have unprotected sex before or after her period when she ovulating. I hope this helps... Congrats on the Wedding!|`|KKoZ1LBMaa	Well, I think she should get started on birth control because it takes a month or two for the body to get acclimated. <br>  <br>  No, you won't get pregnant every time you don't wear a condom but any time you "go" in her, there is a chance. I suggest, at the very least, pulling out well before you know you're going to go. This is not the safest bet but it's better than going inside of her.<br>  <br>  But some sort birth control is the best bet, I'de say. Give it a try! :)|`|X3BWtVrkaa	Well its simple really , if you want sex without a condom , tell her to go to the doctors and go on birth control pills :) . 
cf60728a145c5cebd75177083d6b6f8eaa	I love it!!!.....We are on our 4th AND LAST child and that's the one thing me and my husband are going to miss...lol...he likes it better to. I think everything is much more sensitive and hot down there, it's much easier for me to ummm well you know...hahaha<br>  <br>  About your 2nd question....with the first 2 I bought the 2 in 1 pack fact plus and both worked fine the 3rd I bought the Walmart equate kind and it worked fine......with this one I bought 3 dollar store brands and 1 was right but questionable and 2 didn't even work......I would get a double pack of the equate.|`|kowiBQCEaa	I am with you, I was insatiable with my first pregnancy. My husband was so happy about it that I expect that if I was not on industrial birth control we would be pregnant again! <br>  <br>  I am not sure that the love of sex is a true test of pregnancy, just get a test. Any test is just as accurate as the others. I think it is a bunch of hype about how early they can test. Look at the actual make up of the test, they are all the same. |`|p0jBpQBZaa	I think it feels better now that I'm preggo. My husband says it feels a little different 2. I used 1st response and it was more sensitive then the drs urine test. I got a positive on the first response and the drs wasn't even able to detect it!|`|kQf2XAKiaa	Well actually i banned sex all throughout my pregnancy... dont feel much for it... i guess its different for all of us. And the best is called " First Response Pregnancy Test".|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It feels the same except for the fact that I feel like I have to pee the entire time even though I go right before. It sucks and I hate it.|`|slzx5202aa	I lost all desire to have sex at about 6 weeks so i can't really remember what it felt like, all i know is that it is the last thing i feel like doing.
X83LVP6Iaa	The average pregnancy last a full 40 weeks. Some women have their babies sooner than that and some have them later than 40 weeks. 40 weeks comes out to 10 months. When you have your baby is something that cannot be answered. Labor happens when it happens.<br>  <br>  A great book for you to buy and read is "What To Expect When You're Expecting."|`|c0tmmjRZaa	It sounds to me like you will probably deliver sometime in August, but it depends on how accurate your calculation of how far along you are and how quickly the baby develops, a lot of first babies are delivered earlier than their expected date.<br>  <br>  Congrats!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	A full term is 40 weeks but everyone is different. You can have your baby early and some women go over their due date. I've actually heard that if it's your first then chances are you'll go over your due date. |`|M6T53AMuaa	you have a long long long way to go pregnancy normaly lasts 40 weeks but you can have your baby from 37 weeks to 40 weeks your doctor shouldve told you this read what expect when expecting |`|kITeUsc7aa	you should definatly go to the doctor to make sure everything is normal and to figure out when the baby is due for sure. :) good luck|`|lx9fkX06aa	women are usually pregnant for nine months. to figure out your due date you should ask your dr.  |`|5tXZLEzkaa	you will stay pregnant for about 30 more weeks<br>  a total of 40 weeks|`|sGJhKesdaa	www.babycenter.com  click on due date calendar|`|IvcziQY1aa	You should be due in May.

I thought my friend was young when she got pregnant in 9th grade. Anyway I think you need a psychologist and I'm pretty sure you'll have a social worker so you could ask all these things to. Because obviously you weren't ready for a child. OR why don't you ask your mom?|`|y63JTIhuaa	um, maybe it's just me, but i was thinking maybe you should've already seen an obstetrician...they can answer your questions.|`|LiKMlFfzaa	your in 7th grade and pregnant wow are you stupid   by the way if you  are pregnant and your folks know shame on them|`|YPuVx2Niaa	You're 12?

tOWqXCdtaa	If he used a condom AND didn't ejaculate inside you then you're not pregnant.|`|8ENRWmoMaa	try closing your legs that usually works.  And your most likely just paraniod.  get a preggo test.|`|7EOLTC20aa	Well, you could be.  If neither of you are using protection, there is a chance for pregnancy.  Since you aren't due for a period for another week and a half, you have to wait to do a test for the most accurate results.  Some home tests are able to detect pregnancy as soon as 5 days before your missed period.  If this turns out that you aren't pregnant, you need to get yourself on some form of BC.  If you aren't into the pill everyday, then talk to your doctor about Depo shot (once every 3 months, Very effective) or Nuva ring (inserted by your dr.).  At 16, you should be worrying about getting your drivers license, or prom, or even high school graduation....not having a baby!!!  Please take responsibility if you chose to be active, getting pregnant is a life changing event that will be with you forever, no matter what you decide to do with the pregnancy!|`|MLbnIktaaa	Im in the same position as you :( <br>  yes could be pregnant but i think you should do a preg test and get down to your doctors.<br>  however, it could just be signs of your period coming <br>  All the best :)|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	You could be and that's what happens when you have unprotected sex. What you have to do is first of all find out if you are and if so then you need to take responsibility for your actions. |`|lx9fkX06aa	its possible take a test and if your not pregnant wear protection|`|5tXZLEzkaa	You are experiencing symptoms of both pregnancy and a menstrual cycle. The best thing to do is wait it out. Also go buy a pregnancy test. Some dollar stores sell them for one dollar. Also I would recomend you not having sex until marriage. But i'm not you or your mother. So since you may not take that advice I'd say to get on birth control. You have to take it like the directions say or it may not work. If you are pregnant you need to talk to your mother or a councelor. There are places and clinics out there for single and teen mothers. Abortion is not the answer. But you could keep the baby or put it up for adoption. I'm hoping your not for motherhood is a long road, but a joyous road at the same time.|`|keoXR41xaa	You could be pregnant, those where my first symptoms when i found out. Did he ejaculate in you? If so, then you should probably take a pregnancy test... The cramps and sore breasts could just be from your period...

74YdJWJIaa	First of all, you're a brave girl and you can definitely make it through this.  I'm proud of you for wanting to give yourself completely to this baby because at your age, it can be a tough thing to do.  You have the right frame of mind and that is good.<br>  <br>  I know that you're scared and worried but the best way to tell your mum is to sit down with her and say "Mum, I'm pregnant."  She will be shocked and may be angry, but that doesn't mean she doesn't love you or that she won't help you.  Tell her why you made the decision to have the baby and tell her that it's extremely important that you have her support because you need her more than ever right now.  <br>  <br>  Hang in there and take it one day at a time.  You can do this.|`|01vMpHkWaa	i told my mom over the phone<br>  and then fought for months with both of my parents about not getting an abortion...they are now accepting it<br>  <br>  so just spit it out to her....as soon as possible because the baby needs prenatal care!<br>  <br>  and just stick up for yourself....dont let her talk you into anything you do not want. she might try to say she can force you into an abortion...but she cant. and the police can not take away your baby. (my parents got a cop to tell me that....then he said he was lying.)<br>  <br>  its your baby and the way your acting makes you a great mother so no court can rule you an "unfit mother"<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  oh and do not listen to those people who tell you that you made a mistake. a baby is never a mistake.|`|rPywKtJRaa	I know exactly what you are going through, I was slightly older but non the less...not married.<br>  Well there is no easy way whether you say it around the dinner table...."pass the pea's please, im pregnant."  or wait till after church and say "mom, dad don't kill me, im pregnant, what would jesus do." They will be disappointed.  One of them will surprise you but either way waiting until your belly is big and round will not help the situation.  Tell them what's going on and your plan of action.  Tell them you need their love and support.  They will realize the courage it took you to tell them.  Just open up and be honest.  By the time the baby is born everyone will be happy.  Good luck!|`|RluCMVUSaa	Walk into the room and say "mom and dad I have decided that I am a lesbian, I would like to have my college fund reallocated for a sex change" or "mom and dad I tested positive for HIV"  then when they react you say "just kidding, I am only pregnant!"<br>  <br>  Okay not really the best approach, but definitely an ice breaker ; )<br>  <br>  Rehearse the conversation, be prepared for anger, tears, yelling... basically any range of emotion.  You being level headed and having a thoroughly thought out plan and telling them that you need their help and support will be very helpful! It will also be helpful when you react by saying that you understand that they are angry, mad, disappointed etc. it shows them that you are understanding of the situation. <br>  <br>  You should be scared, I am 27 and have no kids and honestly I want them badly, but they still scare me, that is a whole life you are responsible for.  I think you are making a good choice and please don't rush into marriage or anything with the dad, you made a mistake getting pregnant and making another one settling for the wrong person does nothing but add to the stress and hardship of the first.<br>  <br>  You sound like a great person who made a mistake, get yourself together, take some time, remember you have some time before you have to tell and prepare yourself.  I wish you all the best.  Just FYI, I have a very close friend who had her first at 16 she got pregnant at 15 and she is a wonderful mother, you can do it, it is just not going to be easy.  Best wishes to you!|`|mTyu7CKoaa	i was in ur spot.... just make up in ur mind that ur going to tell them the next time u see them... then say mom, dad i have something to tell u, ur not going to like it but it is what it is.... I'm pregnant and u have every right to be angry, but u know and i know that u will love the end result a beautiful baby and i just thought i would tell u so u can be there and support me emotionally during this periods of our lifes... I love u and Im scared ....... they will be mad but they will get over the shock in a few days and everything will be alright!!! good luck!|`|IVNM1O5naa	There really is no easy way to tell your parents that you are pregnant. You just need to be straightforward about it. Let your mom know what is going on and what you plan to do. She will be uspet at first, but I am sure she will help you and be there for you.|`|88f430b4f419cb62981931e8380f7878aa	Ask a friend to be there, for support. Have your mother sit in a comfortable chair. and then tell her, and ask for her support!<br>  <br>  <br>  Best of luck to all of you!|`|7EOLTC20aa	At least at 16 you have the courage to stand up to the world and not terminate this child's life!  Good for you!  As for telling your mom, honesty is the best thing you can do with her.  Just sit her down and explain the situation, acknowledging the fact that you had unprotected sex and you know that was a mistake can also help to show her that you fully understand this situation.  She may react differently than you think.  <br>  <br>  In any case, there are agencies and state programs designed to help people in your situation.  Contact your county assistance office for medical insurance (if you don't have it already) and other programs like WIC (women,infants,children).  Being a single mom can have it's advantages also!  It will give you a more personal, close relationship with your baby and he/she will come to depend on you and be closer to you than anyone.  Good luck honey!  You can do it!|`|kFf6ma1Raa	You need to tell them that you need their love and support at this tough time.  But, you say you want to keep the baby, but I wish you would seriously consider adoption for your child.  You have barely started your life and you are brining in another life.  You may not, at your very young age, be able to provide this child with the best possible life.  Please look into and consider adoption as a choice.  Good Luck!!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Well first of all I want to thank you for not saying you were having an abortion. That would be the wrong thing to do. I would just sit your mom down and tell her that you made a mistake and had sex and now you are pregnant. No matter how you tell her I'm sure she's not going to take it very well. I'm sure as you get further along the more she will come around but there isn't going to an easy way to tell her. She is going to be disappointed in you. Just make sure you do it because she will find out eventually anyway. Good luck and God bless you.|`|kgCHQQshaa	Don't be shy about it. <br>  <br>  You had sex and now you're pregnant. Tell them now, before it's too late and they figure it out themselves. <br>  <br>  I'd argue it's better coming straight from you while they can get you through it instead of finding out any other way. <br>  <br>  Good luck. (: |`|AA11661950	  Just tell your mother, the sooner the better.<br>    Maybe you can get Bethany and others who are against abortion to help with the support. The new baby will need many things that only money can buy, and you won't be able to work.|`|nT4qEeYKaa	You could do what Jamie Lynn Spears did... write a note to to your mom that says "Mom.. I'm pregnant and I'm keeping the baby. Everything is going to be okay."|`|LiKMlFfzaa	just be open and honest and i think they will understand|`|bl8vA1mpaa	DON'T BEAT AROUND THE BUSH! JUST TELL THEM<br>  THEY WONT UNDERSTAND BUT THEY WILL HAVE TO!|`|WsYRcgU4aa	I'm 21 and trying to figure out the same thing, but I'm guessing you're still in high school which would mean that when having the baby, you're going to need your family's support a lot more than I. My point is regardless of age it's still a hard thing, especially when things aren't planned & you may not be as stable as you would have hoped when having kids. <br>  Let her know that this is a mistake that you know you've made, but that you're now wanting to take responsibility for your actions. Make her understand that you completely are aware that she may be very disappointed, but that you really need her support.....<br>  <br>  Hope this helps! I'm going to practice what I preach, most likely tonight! Thanks & Good Luck! <br>  |`|3rRXrnobaa	Cogz, you said "mum"?  I take it you're from England somewhere?  Yeah, you've got a predicament.  I think your mom and dad will still love you, but there'll be a little lag time there, on that love stuff?  You asked for some cheap "ideas" on breaking the news, right?  <br>  <br>  Write your mom a note explaining everything. Put it in an envelope.  When your mom is just watching tv or whatever, tell your mom you have something very important to say in the envelope. Leave it on the table by the door, and tell everyone you'll be back in a half hour or so.  Stay gone for about an hour.  When you get back, some of the steam might have blown off??  Like someone said, you're going to have to, eventually??  |`|keoXR41xaa	I went through the same thing when i was your age! I went to the doctor, knowing I was pregnant, but my parents didn't. Well i had a UTI, that was why I was going... and they pee tested me and told me and my mom in the room that I was pregnant. I already knew, but it kinda helped, because my mom couldn't scream at me. But ohhh man when I got home and she told my dad... lets just say me and him didn't talk for about a week, and the only thing I heard from family was how I was ruining my life... Actually, im pregnant again, and I don't know how to tell them. They are going to be pissed, but i got to do it someday... and im thinking ill write a letter. lol|`|sCkxTxeEaa	well there isn't going to be an easy way. just tell them call them to the living room and tell them or you could write them a letter and tell put your feelings into it. I know its different but when my 16 year old sister lost her virginity she wrote a letter to our mom and told her and asked her not to be upset. |`|XxLnAlZLaa	i told my mom by takeing her to my first sonogram she couldnt kill me infront of the doctors and by time she saw my babys little heart beat she wasnt mad anymore we went out to McDonalds and she bought him a crib that day... i was 18 at the time, but hopefully your mom will react similar|`|ZDuD2BI8aa	There's probably no easy way to tell your parents your pregnant so my suggestion would be to just be straight forward, no stammering, just spill it.  I find the direct approach usually works best.|`|2E2Ejfgjaa	Just be honest now and tell them. They will upset at first but all parents end up having to deal with it.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|IvcziQY1aa	Just be straightforward. The best method is to get it over with. 
M9M6nTZeaa	I don't really understand what the question is here.... <br>  <br>  are you looking for tips?<br>  <br>  How long have you been trying?<br>  <br>  Anyways, my best advice would be... <br>  <br>  1. Buy an ovulation kit.<br>  2. Put a pillow under your bum<br>  3. After he ejaculates inside you, elevate your bum and your legs for 10 minuets. <br>  4. Relax and don't put too much emphasis on trying, the more relaxed you are, the more likely it is to happen!<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck sweetheart!|`|vue9NOhYaa	What are you asking exactly?<br>  <br>  How long have you been trying?  Do you understand what your fertile times are?  Do you have any medical issues that might suggest a fertility problem? (Very erratic periods? History of STDs and/or multiple partners?) <br>  <br>  Without more detail, it's impossible to offer suggestions. But know that it can take a healthy, fertile couple a full year to get pregnant.  It doesn't always happen immediately.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I know what you are going through. My husband and I tried to conceive for 2 1/2 years with no luck. I had tons of tests done and so did my husband there was nothing wrong with either of us. In June of this year we bought the clear blue easy fertility monitor and on July 16th we found out that I was 3 weeks pregnant. I really recommend getting one because they tell you exactly when you are fertile and the day you ovulate so you're not always wondering. Good luck!|`|f1f028e1b87f4263abe46dd6cf2aa259aa	Maybe you should concentrate on turning your 'partner' into a husband, before you worry about turning him into a father. If he doesn't want to marry you, then you have a much bigger problem to resolve first.|`|SGU94p8eaa	You should probably get a fertility test done. As weird as it might sound, try some different positions. Never hurts to try, anyways it adds excitement.  :) |`|rBAac9ksaa	is he putting it in the right hole?
ZhQh57dZaa	are you late?  when was your last period?  I am sooo sick right now.  I haven't really ate since sunday.  I am 9 weeks pregnant today.  Good Luck to you.|`|C0GeEv7kaa	Take a test! The only way to know would be to take a test. Women don't all have the same symptoms, plus being an RN and your husband a pediatric doctor, you would know better than us, lol. |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It is possible but it's hard to tell if it is too early since you didn't tell us when you last experienced a period or when your next period would be due. Go see a doctor.|`|aXESNuBKaa	you could be...how far along would you be?
2674548b6a4c9cdbb098044c58c7af7aaa	What does the fact that you're 14 have to do with having abortions?  Have you had one?  If not, then it's none of your concern.  If you have then that makes you a hypocrite.|`|ioZeveazaa	I hate abortion but in some instances like rape or incest it is not the girl's fault and unfortunately shouldn't have to be pregnant if she didn't have a choice. Otherwise if you have consentual sex and become pregnant, step up to the plate and don't be a whoos.|`|ZncV5gc0aa	If only the babies were able to speak! If there's a medical need I understand. I even understand a young girl's mistake or if a druggy would rather not give birth to a crackbaby... but I don't understand why healthy able women dont have their babies!|`|IllWKAUGaa	a person's right and own choice.<br>  <br>  ***About the link from Charlotte W.: one thing you have to understand about that video is that those are all abortions from fetuses that are well past the 1st trimester. The majority of abortions done then are by women who are at risk or injury to either themselves or their baby. It is rare that a woman has an abortion this far into their pregnancy, when the baby is so well formed.....this video is very biased for this reason. because in some situations abortions need to take place, and like i said, it is rare that these abortions take place and that they are by women that get them just to have them, as opposed to needing it for their own safety. If you dont believe me then look it up....ive researched this topic intensely.<br>  <br>  The majority of abortions done are before the baby's nerve net is formed (along with many other important organs and body parts), so the baby does not feel pain and doesn't look like the babies in the video (like a fully formed human baby)...they are quite underdeveloped at this point<br>  <br>  I think it is really important that people educate themselves on this issue before creating opinions about it and telling other people information on it, when in fact it may not be correct, or just biased.|`|AA10719402	It shows you are only 14 with a world of things to encounter.<br>  <br>  Life isn't as easy as black and white.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	Murder of the most innocent and heplless|`|sLERr3aAaa	Well where does things like rape incest come to play? or when the mother's health is at risk? them are the reason I think that are a reason for abortions. Yes they should be ashamed if they knew the consequences and did nothing to protect them selves then go get a abortion but no one can tell a woman what to do with there bodies if they dicide that is what they want then they will go threw with it|`|LMc23g9Maa	You're 14.  Once you get out of the family cocoon and get to experience life, you may change from your "black and white" views and become more understanding of other people's predicaments.

For example, high school girls, rape or incest victims, women who simply can't afford a baby, or women who are not ready for children. Now, I don't really see abortion as a form of birth control, but sometimes women make mistakes and they shouldn't be punished with a child for having unprotected sex one time.<br>  <br>  Other women could never even consider having an abortion, and would rather have the baby and raise it or put it up for adoption. <br>  <br>  Personally, I am Pro-Choice. I believe that it's a woman right to choose if she wants to have an abortion or not. My mom is Anti-Abortion but Pro-Choice. You can be both. It comes down to this. If you don't like abortion, fine, don't have one, but don't you dare try to tell another woman what she can and can't do with her body. That is not your right and none of your business. |`|OXKF0jbtaa	I think life is beautiful and an incredible process found in nature.<br>  However.<br>  A woman's body is her choice.<br>  You are only 14 and don't realize all the complications that can occur.<br>  <br>  It's absurd when women get multiple abortions, but bad things happen, so I think it's 100% legit to make abortion an option.|`|cHJ1Xf2saa	well you're young and don't understand. Even though I don't believe in abortion myself, I understand when other women choose to do it. Sometimes a woman can be raped. Should she have to endure the pain and length of a pregnancy, and be thinking about the pain she went through, then deciding whether or not to keep a baby afterwards?<br>  <br>  Or what if a baby was determined to have a severe complication, should that baby have a life of suffering and medical interventions?|`|bEXP9Htiaa	well i believve an abortion is almost as bad as ru486 but it is an option that many women must face daily yes many may believe that it is the death of a child but thats almost as bad as saying a male masturbating kills kids who could be the cure for cancer. even though i dont believe in it,try being a pregnant 13 year old and having to raise a kid you need to read into it more.|`|59M4xUwXaa	I have not been in a situation where an abortion would be the best option for me. But, I have not walked in others shoes. There is always going to be a gray area when it comes to abortion because there could be so many circumstances where it could be warranted in that woman's opinion. That is why women are given a choice. So, don't condemn what you don't know. I do not agree with abortion being used as a habitual form of birth control. But, whom are we to judge...God will judge those who choose to the route of abortion. <br>  And as for you being only 14 years old and having such strong convictions to condemn those you know nothing about, I hope your practicing abstinence so you won't ever have to recant those words. |`|kKRklkToaa	Personally it's each to their own & can't let society dictate how we live our own lives. I don't think it's either right or wrong due to individual circumstances. Rape, incest, mental & physical ability, the quality of life you can give to your child. And if you look from the governments point of view it's cheaper to give someone an abortion (even though it's wrong) than what it is to pay benefits for 18years! Think about it, or why would abortion be so easy??|`|0vcOjNwiaa	Abortion is something you can't understand until you have been there. <br>  <br>  Personally, I would never have one and I do believe that in theory it is wrong... but it is hard to judge people who feel so desperate, afraid, and alone that they make that decision.|`|aSruANWDaa	if u really believe in abortions after watchin this unless like someone else has already said health risk problems to either child or mother then you r sick its MURDER<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVbkgO-GUhY&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVbkgO-GU...</a>|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Abortions are murder.|`|EzuYExM4aa	I would never have one but I believe they should still be legal because EVERY woman has a right to their own body.
ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It is very rare to get a false positive but it is very common to get a false negative. If you really are worried I would test again tomorrow morning and see but honestly I think you are pregnant. Congrats!|`|PwhrTNZraa	I used opk's for 5 months.  In this time I discovered that I had to test twice a day because my LH surge was so short.  I always tested around 11am and then again around 4pm.  Quite often, I would get my + on the 11am test and then by 4pm it was already gone.  So yes, it's normal to get only one + opk.  After 5 months of testing I pretty much had it down to the HOUR when I would get a + opk, so I don't use them anymore.  Also, you normally can expect to ovulate anywhere from 12-36 hours after getting your +.  So, I'm hoping you BD last night and then again today and maybe one last time tomorrow just to make sure you've got your days covered.  NOW.... keep this one thing in mind though....  I have never been on clomid, so my experiences with opk may produce different results than yours, but they are none the less my experience!  I wish you MUCH luck and TONS of baby dust!!!|`|EdV1mbP1aa	Did you take opk's for 7 days straight or just those two days- I am on my first round of clomid cd6-10.  You will get a false positive on opk's if you don't wait until 3 days after your last pill.  So in my case I can't start opk's untill cd13.  Hope this helps good luck!

When you ovulate depends on how long your cycle is, so the earlier in your cycle you start, the less likely you are to miss your fertile time.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	When you are ovulating. If you don't know when you ovulate I recommend buying ovulation tests. I used the clear blue easy fertility monitor and got pregnant after one cycle. Good luck.|`|NJaBS4smaa	The best time to conceive usually is when you're making love, that's how it works.

e90a8e2ee095e648a3f92f15f7959eb6aa	Yep, you are normal.  I was worried I wasn't feeling much movement either (I'm 19 weeks), but today I just had a doctor's appointment and he was moving all over the place when she was listening to his heartbeat (she had to keep following him with the monitor) and I couldn't feel a thing...so I know he's moving, it's just that I can't feel it.  I bet your little one is the same way.|`|b0c36350d835d81614a99e05c0418bf5aa	yup! That's normal it starts to get more steady around 7 months or so. |`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	im 19 wks and have a very active baby so it freaks me out when he has quiet days! which happens a lot more than id like!!<br>  <br>  its not till much later on that u need to be concerned x x|`|433165e2c7b432dcd07898d64f6f19c8aa	It's perfectly normal sweetie so dont worry. Babies have their quiet days just like we do. When baby gets a little bigger and movements more easily felt, you'll beg for a quiet day.. I'm feeling movements daily, but then there's two little bubba's in there, so i'd be bound to. When one is quiet, the other one moves, but i rarely feel both at the same time.|`|faa49a1082ae030ed5d0898cedf76862aa	yes and some feel the baby even less it is sometimes how the baby is laying! My last baby was breach and he always played on the bladder although the movement was rare so I always paniced although the doctor told me some it is the way the baby lays! He is now healthy and 6 months! Congrats!|`|y6g0RnuAaa	That happened to me and I would freak out...lol. It's okay though. Baby may be more active at night when you are sleeping. Now if it goes on for several days or a week, I would have the doctor check the heartbeat. |`|3ao6N2Szaa	Normal, relax every thing is OK.|`|tAqDeqBVaa	dont panic - there is absolutely NOTHING wrong in not feeling regular consistent movements at your stage in the pregnancy. i have six children (3 boys and 3 girls for who's interested) and can remember well that it is not uncommon to not feel anything for a few days.... i think it is because you only feel the movements when they are in a certain position in the womb. the baby will still be very small now so you will only feel a certain type of movement - for example when his/her spine is adjacent to yours and he/she kicks out with his legs. As the baby gets bigger and fills more of your tummy you will notice much more movement as there gets less and less space for him/her to move around in. good luck and enjoy your pregnancy. xx|`|1zQB6546aa	Yep normal.<br>  Even now my baby can have a quite day and I am 38 weeks! Remember they have to have rest time too.<br>  If you dont feel yours move for a good few days then you can always just mention it to your midwife just in case - but trust me, its normal to have these "off" days.<br>  <br>  And the cramps I'm afraid are normal too and only get worse as you get bigger and bigger.......and bigger!!|`|4S7lR5Qwaa	its very normal dont worry - sit still for a couple of hours have a cold drink and wait.<br>  I have cramps all the time too and somedays baby is quiet and we naturally worry but if theres no bleeding then dont worry.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I just now started feeling it move everyday and it isn't a whole lot and I'm almost 20 weeks. Some people are different and don't feel it until later.|`|5OQLmECTaa	yes, it is normal.   babies have their on and off days just like we do, that is what my doctor told me when i went through the same thing.|`|61ba79ff5c1542528d2b969d552d2fbeaa	It's totally normal.  Every day regular movements usually aren't' felt until 26-28 weeks or so.|`|UKjPitHVaa	Yes. You may not feel the baby move every day. |`|J1Oedie3aa	Congratulations on your pregnancy! This is really pretty normal. When I was pregnant, one thing that I would do if I wanted to reassure myself was to drink either something cold or sugary and lie down on my left side. That usually did the trick to give me a kick or wiggle - the drink gave her a jolt of energy and the being quiet helped me to concentrate and notice. Since you may have just recently started to feel your baby, you may not realize what all are really baby movements yet. Don't worry if you keep getting strong heartbeat with your monitor. Relax, that is the best thing for you and your baby.|`|cHJ1Xf2saa	yes very common symptoms, happened to me. I was freaking out when I didn't feel her one day. But the baby is moving, and most of the time you just don't feel it cause the baby isn't big enough or strong enough to for you to feel it. <br>  <br>  At around 20-22 weeks, the intensity  and frequency will be constant|`|GzBsnELPaa	It is very normal..i thought the same way you are when i was pregnant because i didn't know what to feel..some days the baby would go nuts the next i didn't feel anything..its normal..some days they sleep more then others..and at night is when they do alot of there movement while you sleep..my remedy was i drank root beer and then she would kick alot because of all the sugar...ive heard people say chocolate...but just try that and tell me what you think..|`|5507858478baac68ed69511bef8b1860aa	they tell you to monitor the movements from 28w onwards so 18w is way gto early to be getting worried a bout movement, its natural not to feel anything now and again at this early stage, sounds like you need to relax a bit you sounds like your stressing about nothing here.<br>  <br>  |`|HR5sLG3Paa	YES, I didn't really start feeling strong movements every day til about 23 weeks. They're still pretty little in there so it's hard for you to notice, as long as the heartbeat is good at your appointments then you have nothing to worry about. <br>  <br>  Congratulations|`|T2iYetpkaa	its hard to say. my best friend is pregnant and she says she worries that the baby isnt moving enough because one day he is so active and the next he isnt. every baby is different. if you are that worried though maybe its best to see your dr. |`|h90Uobyyaa	I didnt feel my little one move every day until 20+ weeks. I felt movements off and on since week sixteen too. When it got to 30+ weeks then i felt him all the time! This got to be a little frustrating lol. |`|bggj4EJDaa	it really depends on what you eat. When i was pregnant with my daughter and i ate or drank anythng wtih alot of sugar i would feel her move alot more!
7A8xCwS0aa	You can absolutely have sex unless otherwise told by your doctor. However, it also depends on how thin your cervix is - how close you are to having your baby. Again, your going to the Dr. every week by now - just ask.|`|7uCFWCdoaa	Yea, it is still safe to have sex, all the way up to your waters breaking, I was even told to have lots of sex when I went overdue with my daughter as semen can help soften the plug. The only risk factors are if you have a history of miscarriages or have had very high blood pressure etc, but ten your doctor would have advised you when or whether it was safe too. Good luck with this and go and enjoy your pregnancy. :)|`|QDInNnF2aa	Of course it is unless your doctor tells you not to!<br>  Mine first told me not to, but Im due on the 14th and have been dilated at a 2 for 3 weeks now...so now he is telling me to have sex! It depends on what is comfortable for you and the father, and of course the doctor would have said something by now if it wasn't ok!<br>  <br>  Have Fun!|`|EeRODkg0aa	Absolutely.  Your doctor would have specifically told you if it wasn't.<br>  <br>  So enjoy!  It will be awhile before you feel like doing it again! :D|`|TXggMlCraa	If you are still up for it I'm sure its fine, as long as your water hasn't broke is what I have always heard!<br>  |`|HR5sLG3Paa	Of course, all the way up until your water breaks!!|`|wkfOHiyBaa	yup, until you dilate or water breaks or have your bloody show.|`|FLOjzbKEaa	Why do you think you are willing to have sex at 9 month pregnant? If yes then I think shouldn't be a problem.,|`|0iUxfCMcaa	yes it is safe as long as the doctor has not told you to stop having sex. Plus if your leaking fluid or your water breaks then its not safe then either.|`|EpfVsCa2aa	yes u can have sex till the day u have it, sex helps some women go in labor, and it cant harm the baby, so your good to go |`|KwcD582Oaa	Sure, Your baby is safe. You can have sex, but maybe better if you do it positions in which your partner does not press on stomach.|`|faa49a1082ae030ed5d0898cedf76862aa	it is safe although you could go into labor allot faster! Congrats!|`|sLERr3aAaa	it's safe until you have lost your mucus plug or your water breaks|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I'm sure that if it wasn't the doctor would have said something to you. If you are still worried then I would contact your doctor and see what they say there. Good luck. And Congrats!|`|B09QQz1Oaa	Yes it is still safe.  Until your water actually breaks you can have sex.  Some Dr's say that having sex can help induse your labour.  Keep enjoying your dh cause once baby comes things aren't the same.|`|5OQLmECTaa	you should have asked your doctor while you were there, but if he didn't add anything about not having sex, then it should be fine.|`|61ba79ff5c1542528d2b969d552d2fbeaa	As long as you have no high risk factors that your doctor mentioned then it should be totally fine.  And no, it's not incest.........sheeeesh!! some people!|`|4ztXoIDKaa	Yes, as long as it doesn't casue you pain, go ahead and do it!  |`|788a038f5541dbc6f3da4714cefecd6caa	As long as your OB told you otherwise, it is perfectly safe. :)|`|gsJLU82waa	yes its safe as long as he doesnt blow air into your  vagina|`|3rG4BFN8aa	yeah.. it safe.. i did the day my baby came
EmYNUZcXaa	no caffeine or sugar foods at least 6 hours before bedtime. sleep in a cool dark environment. read or take a warm bath or shower before bedtime. warm milk (if you like it) before bed. i'm not sure how far along you are but it'll get MUCH harder to sleep as you get farther along in your pregnancy. i'm 34 weeks and lucky to get 3 hours of sleep ALL TOGETHER a night. just wait till you have to pee 5-7 times a night :)|`|x6IyESABaa	For me, i make sure i'm really tired before i try sleeping. I will watch really boring shows or surf the web. Try taking warm milk or warm water. Also, get a really comfortable soft pillow to hug.<br>  <br>  I'm 13 weeks pregnant now. You can view my baby's blog at<br>  <a href="http://joanna-shawn.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://joanna-shawn.blogspot.com/</a>|`|DneneGsxaa	i don't know if i am pregnant yet,and i feel the same way, i can't sleep to save my life.. i stay up late because i know if i try going to sleep its not going to happen, i have actually been staying up watching tv... and then end up falling asleep on the couch, that way if i am tired, i don't have far to move to disturb me sleeping lol. :) good luck to ya.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I know what you're going through. I sleep with a pillow between my legs and that helps a little bit. Honestly I don't think there is much you can do. I have a hard time. I had to move to another bed from my husband because I keep him up all night. Good luck and I hope things get better. |`|2cstdEkIaa	fill up your tummy, take a warm bath, then go to bed with a body pillow while listening to some soothing music|`|qicxk5GMaa	a warm shower or bath... some de-caf hot tea... if all else fails, my doc told me I can use Unisom... its over the counter.|`|mjF3cvMAaa	For comfort: sleep on your side, with a firm pillow between your legs. That'll keep the circulation going (I used to be a back sleeper until I was 6 months along and woke up with no feeling in my legs), and relieve stress on you hips.<br>  <br>  For any insomnia: I highly recommend Dr. Jeffery Thomspon's sleep CDs. He has a bunch of them. I've found all to be soothing and the almost subliminal tones activate the sections of the brain needed for sleep.|`|2wiDGMPsaa	lol good luck. i couldn't wait to have my baby so i could finally sleep again. he is four months old and i am still waiting. i dont think i will ever sleep good again. <br>  <br>  one thing that can help though is a body pillow or pregnancy pillow in betwen your legs while you sleep on your left side. congrats|`|Z2T11p0Jaa	my doctor told me to look into an over the counter sleep aid called Unisom. He said for me to take half a tab to help me sleep, and it works wonderfully. Another trick i've found is sleeping with a pillow tucked under my stomach. |`|JXKjqQ5baa	ho about a glass of warm milk it actually works.
UudGWhnJaa	just wait a lil bit longer and test again <br>  ive heard that sometimes it takes for you to be 6 weeks preg<br>  for a test to come positive. <br>  but im not sure.<br>  if you want just wait till your next period is due<br>  to see f it comes.|`|EpfVsCa2aa	take a test, thats the only way to know |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I would just wait another week and test again.|`|jszubNNQaa	calm down.

6DNHxcSsaa	Unfortunately the catheter in your bladder is pretty standard procedure with an epidural, especially when you get one early. You will need to ask your doctor and hospital what their policies are concerning a catheter. The same holds true for the epidural. If you miss the "window" for the epidural you might be able to get a spinal. <br>  Birth blessings to you.|`|EHY3FnAmaa	My hospital lets you get the epidural anytime up until you start pushing. Every hospital is different I'm sure. I don't know about the catheter, I had one but I couldn't feel a thing so it didn't bother me.|`|EpfVsCa2aa	u will have to get a catherter, and the latest top get a epidural is 5cm, after that u cant get it,.|`|I3V7hE32aa	I think the cms may very as far as when the epidural is administered based on the situation.  I remember having to wait until I was at least 3cm before getting one.  However, my friend was progressing so rapidly that she never had the time to get one.  I think she went from 3 - 8 within a hr and missed out.<br>  <br>  I never had a catheter.  I remember the nurses telling me that I had to urinate and have a BM after the delivery (they gave me a time limit) or they would have to use a catheter and enema.  Luckily, I was determined to do things myself.  However, this wasn't until after the delivery and when I was settled into our room, so the epidural was long gone.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I have been told that you can't get one until about 4 cm and once they see the head it is too late. I don't know though.|`|61fDnK1Oaa	You can get it at ANY point at the beginning, they like to have you wait until you're at 4cm but you can get it as soon as you walk in the door at 1cm if you want to. I know that you have to get the catheter b/c you can't control your bladder when you have the epidural done, you don't know if you're peeing or what is going on. I had the catheter a few times during my labor with my daughter and I never felt ANYTHING when they did it...all 3 times. So, I think it just depends on how well your epidural is. |`|fvmKx667aa	I think the soonest is 3cm, sometimes 4cm (at least at my hospital). They dont like to do it after 6-7 cm. I find it hard to believe to not get a catheter due to the fact you cant get up on your own and walk to the bathroom. Now check with your hospital and see if they offer walking epidurals. They arent as strong but you dont need a catheter cause you can walk to the bathroom. It helps with the pain of contractions but you feel the pain of the actual delivery. I would do a hospital tour and ask there, they should be able to answer all these questions for you. I found out about mine at my childbirth class offered through my hospital and at the tour. Good luck|`|UZpz9r4Taa	Most doctors will say 4cm minimum for the epidural, but it varies from case to case.  I got mine when I was less than 3 because I had been induced and was exhausted from 10 hours or so of active labor.  <br>  <br>  At my hospital, they say they can give you the epidural almost right up until its time to push.  <br>  <br>  As far as the catheter, I really don't know.  If I had one, I was unaware of it (they had given me morphine prior to the epidural so I was a little out of it!).|`|Qw3lnnrvaa	With my experience they gave it to me and they didn't know how far dialted I was. After getting it they checked me and said I was 2cm dialated. It sped up my labor incredibly fast and I will get another this time around. I had no choice with the cathreter. I felt it as they put it in and that was it, they told me I shouldn't be able to but I felt a pinch.<br>     As far as when is it too late I think it depends on your doctor and how fast your labor is progressing. My labor again went so fast after the epidural so had I waited I don't know. I will ask for one right away when I go in this time. I'd say  7cm is probably the latest most doctors would do one at but that's just my opinion!<br>   God Bless!|`|UudGWhnJaa	yea i heard that you have to wait til yor 4cm  and i think you cant have one after 9 not sure tho. and im not sure about the catheter...i hate that thing too. its so painful.|`|hrnDGIKxaa	the earliest you can have a epidural is 5cm and latest about 8 cm....if u dont want a catheter then they can't force you...u should make out a birthing plan and discuss it with your doctor|`|gVoIdTqUaa	If you are in full term labor you can get it at anytime. You have to have a cath sorry dear. |`|SNFwe0R5aa	I had mine at 9cm ,but they  did try to tell me I was out of time. I also did not have a catheter.
RgePPcoDaa	well i have a similar situation. my boyfriend is 28 and never had kids. we started dating when he was almost 25. he said he tried to have kids but it just didnt happen. well we been waiting over 3 yrs now and i finally got pregnant. im due in January. we still got his sperm tested and it was fine and we tried for year to get preg... so maybe it just takes time for some people. if you really dont think he can have kids though he should get his sperm count tested. its always a good thing to know i guess.... good luck in the future : )|`|EpfVsCa2aa	he might need to go to a Dr and get checked to see if he can have kids, cause there is a chance he might not be able to|`|5OQLmECTaa	he needs togoto the doctor and find out why he can't have kids, it is obvious something is wrong inside, low sperm count or what have you, he might be able to take a simple medication to help, but it is best to find out why first...unless he had a vasectomy and never told anyone.|`|MmRCqjHraa	Has he *** inside you, you said you're not actually trying. If he hasn't then that's probably why. It's possible to not get pregnant with unprotected sex also, if he pulls out. If he is doing it inside you then he probably needs to see a doctor.  I have had unprotected sex with my hubby for a long time, but he always pulled out. I never got pregnant until he actually **** inside me.|`|GWcV6mapaa	It's hard to tell exactly why...but you could ask him to see  a doctor to explain what the physical causes might be.  I say, never say never, unless you have medical proof.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Just because he never got his ex pregnant or you doesn't mean he can't have kids. That's just stupid. |`|isokr9cfaa	Even though you've already had a baby doesn't make you completely safe from being infertile yourself! Many women have their first child with little effort but have trouble conceiving after. So don't put all the blame on your boyfriend. When you're ready to start trying go to a fertility doctor and you both should get checked. But there are many reasons you guys haven't conceived yet. Low sperm count, one of you is infertile, problems with ovaries, stress, too much alcohol, the list goes on forever. |`|peMrRVwxaa	You should have him go see a doctor, especially if you want kids.  If he hasn't gotten no one pregnant for over 4 years of unprotected sex, then he may have a problem, or low sperm count.  If it is just low sperm count, there are ways to make it higher, but you would have to consult your doctor first.  On the other hand, maybe it is just not meant to be for him to have kids yet in his life.|`|PfNTPviyaa	Maybe its just timing :)  <br>  <br>  My hubby and I have been married for 7 years, together for 10 and I just got pregnant this year (I'm due this week) ... we were never really trying, but we weren't exactly not trying either, ya know? <br>  <br>  Does he wear tightie whities? Drink a lot of caffeine?  Smoke? I've heard that these things can affect his swimmers ...<br>  <br>  Other than that, I wouldn't stress.  If you guys do decide that you do want to try, start timing your ovulation, and go see a doctor just to check things out :) |`|Qw3lnnrvaa	I know of people who tried for 15 years and then one day it happened My husband is the result of them not giving up =) !!! If your not trying don't consider it a problem it happens when it is suppose to. If you want to have children there are things you can do that increase his sperm count such as wearing boxers instead of breifs. Some people have to have a certain position and as someone else said just because you've had one child doesn't mean you don't have infertile times during your life. Because each women is suppose to have certain times during her life that she is infertile.  He can get tested but if your not actively trying you could just not be having intercourse at the right time. Some people try many years without sucess and without answers before it just happens. But if your worried I would talk to him and both of you go to a doctor. Tell him you are willing to get tested as well so your not letting him down. Hope this helps!<br>  God bless!
AA11061445	all photos are different it looks fine to me i have posted mine from thursday im now 20 weeks<br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/16705548@N06/3008597376/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/16705548@N0...</a>|`|geMRkVJbaa	The way I explain it to patients is that ultrasound shows us a 'slice' picture. Imagine that baby is a loaf of sliced bread. For each picture we take, it's like pulling out one slice of bread and looking at it front on, so we can see what is inside the 'loaf'. We can not only pull out the square pieces of bread, but re-cut the loaf lengthways or at an angle  to pull out different slices. In the first pic, the slice pulled out is not at the front of the face, but the back portion of the head, thus the face is not included in the view.|`|iyRWN59Xaa	First of all, the links don't work.  Second, they should have been forwarded to your doctor, who would then discuss them with you.  If your doctor does not have them, then have him conduct another ultrasound because he needs to know just as much as you do.  If he has them yet doesn't discuss them with you, I suggest you find a new doctor.|`|d6GvS2Dpaa	It looks like he just may be at a funny angle.  Don't let ultrasound pics freak you out too much.  They make all babies look like little aliens.  The ultrasound pictures I have of my boy look like he has a claw as a face in one and is missing his lip in another.  They are just snapshots of the whole ultrasound and my boy was moving so much, they couldn't get a good shot.|`|bf6xIfEvaa	It looks fine the first one it looks like he is laying on her side....|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It is just saying that the pics have been deleted.

wZAeBisbaa	Of course you can.  That's how women have been doing it for centuries.  Your body is built to do this job - if you relax, aren't afraid, and trust it, you can almost always get through the birth without medical interventions.   There are exceptions, such as breech birth, fetal distress, mother's physical condition, etc., but under normal circumstances the vast majority of healthy women are capable of giving birth naturally. <br>  <br>  I would encourage you to go for it.  Prepare in advance by learning some relaxation and visualization techniques - they really work!  Develop a positive attitude toward the birth - it's not something to fear - it's an event you should eagerly anticipate as one of the most powerful and transforming experiences of your life.  It will be hard work, but you will be able to handle it.  You will be amazed at your own strength. <br>  <br>  Let your doctor know that you don't want medical interventions except in an emergency; tell the providers the same thing when you go in for your delivery, and don't accept continuous electronic fetal monitoring. It's limiting, uncomfortable, and no more effective in preventing negative outcomes than regular checks by a nurse.  <br>  <br>  Good luck - you can do this, and you will be glad you did.|`|EpfVsCa2aa	The Dr decides that, they have to make sure u and the baby are ok, and if u can handle having it natural, they will let u know when u get closer to due date, |`|LkOcJRRWaa	Yes, if your child is not in immediate danger.|`|wBpennsMaa	Yes.|`|NSk42L8baa	Child birth has been happening for thousands of years. It is only in more recent times that parents have come  to ask permisssion for how we deal with it, and rely on the medial profession for the simplest of details about child birth. <br>  <br>  In reality women are in control of their choices about child birth and know a lot more than they think they do. Medical intervention is only needed in the same circumstances as other times that help is necesssary: when the parent or the baby are sick and when things go wrong, or when we choose it because we feel better that way.|`|3AywreElaa	Are you talking natural as in not a CSection or natural as in no Epidural? You can have a natural if you Dr. says so, and if you can have a natural (non c-section) You can have no epidural...if you can handle it! My last baby was in water and i'm sorry it was hell even though I took breathing classes birth classes read online nothing I learned helped me. But that was just me, I know lots of women who said it has worked for them. Then again my labor was 11 hours|`|OPPsfGW8aa	in most cases yes, but when any sort of danger to the mother or child occurs a different action may have to be taken so that everyone turns out okay.|`|YwOLE88Gaa	yes.... its all your choice every drug goin or none watever you want hunny, unless you have complications but id talk to the midwife as they can better prepare you for any outcome<br>  good luck|`|qlECsz0Iaa	Usually yes as long as you/baby are not in immeadiate danger.  you can make up a birth plan to share with your doctor:<a href="http://www.birthplan.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.birthplan.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.birthplan.com/birthplanner.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.birthplan.com/birthplanner.ph...</a>|`|7dLDF5hQaa	Absolutely, unless your own health or your child's health are at risk.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	You decide!|`|Befe5bUdaa	Yes, but I would not recommend it|`|FvJvVpuHaa	YES! <br>  I did it! I had my daughter 3 months ago, and opted for a natural birth. The doctors listened to my wishes, (make sure you tell your OB your wishes BEFORE going into labour.) Have a birth plan with your partner and the doctor and nurses should respect it as long as they get it in advance of delivery. I told her I wanted to try naturally, but if things got too intense I wanted the epidural, but my partner had to verify that the drugs were REALLY what I wanted....that was my request.<br>  I had my son 22 months ago, but gave up on natural birth an hour before he delivered and asked for the epidural, but with my daughter I stuck with it and succeeded.<br>  Make sure you have a VERY supportive partner, and patience. I am not going to lie to you it hurts a lot. The worst part I found was the contractions, delivery of the head burns Imuch like twisting the skin on your arms opposite directions)but from there its easy sailing!<br>  <br>  Good luck, and happy birthing!|`|EaezAUrUaa	Oh yes! Here is a link to an awesome documentary that helped me decide to try for a natural water birth at my local birthing center!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.thebusinessofbeingborn.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thebusinessofbeingborn.com/</a>|`|RO6pSm2Haa	If conditions for a natural birth are present it is not a matter of choice.|`|Px2QaPH3aa	yup..well depends on the condition|`|ZncV5gc0aa	Yes for the most part. The only exception is when they have to induce you for things like hbp and pre-eclampsia or if they need to do an emergency c-section. |`|jQDeTTVhaa	yes unless medical reasons stop you
ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I would go to the ER and just have them check you out to make sure that everything is okay because they tell you it's okay to have sex just don't be rough. Good luck!|`|ZbMLigR3aa	Go to the ER or urgent care now instead of asking questions online.  If you think that you've injured yourself or your baby you need to get that checked out immediately.  Good luck!|`|91hxNCfWaa	Why would you have 'rough sex' when you're 5 weeks pregnant? I'm not an expert on this, but I don't think that was a very smart thing to do.|`|tMBcQsG0aa	I would see your gp but take a lesson from this, rough sex is not really a good path to travel down in pregnancy, im not saying go extra gentle but lay off the rough stuff. <br>  go to the hospital get checked out though at 5weeks it may be impossible to say if it is alive or not as at this point it is nothimg more than a yolk sac and cells pretty much,it is toward the end of 5weeks-6 weeks the heart begins to beat but rest up!|`|laatfYhcaa	ya the baby is proble fine but just to make sure u should go to the er to have it cheacked.....<br>  <br>  <br>  hope i helped<br>  <br>  cristal|`|EpfVsCa2aa	yes the baby is ok, u cant harm the baby having sex, it will be ok, 
pNK9WrxBaa	That's pregnancy bleeding..|`|91b27b540655ebe4e66c72274b49dd33aa	could be nothing if miscarry you would bleed very very heavy go to the doc now to be safe |`|0LCJuBA8aa	if youre having a miscarriage it would be extremely heavy, it can just be implantation bleeding which can happen during the first few weeks. some women do get their period while being pregnant but its a lot lighter. if it was a miscarriage you would have unbarable cramping as well. just wait for the appt on monday and youll get definate answers. im sure youre fine. good luck! :)|`|OvHLFAYuaa	it is possible to be having a miscarriage, but i also know a lot of people who the same thing happend to and they were fine. |`|F9AiIcVfaa	you should advice someone right away, wen bleeding when pregnant. it could be your period for sure. but it could be something worse. just advise your doctor and he will check your hcg levels. |`|c271e0d140cbe1902cabe87b6f0e3485aa	Possible, or threatened miscarriage.|`|EpfVsCa2aa	its normal, some people still have a light period and be pregnant, good luck|`|31e2812ba8d774ab20eb2a5c9bfb9ff8aa	It's probably spotting, implantation of the embryo onto the uterus lining, if you actually are pregnant.|`|I1oAAKwMaa	sometimes people just spot a little. its perfectly normal however you should go to a doctor to check it out. |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It could be but it is common to have light bleeding at the beginning of your pregnancy. Hope everything is okay!|`|qXRaLsvBaa	I hope not, was u 100% sure u was pregnant|`|BJ1TjXhAaa	Yes it could be.  Sorry.|`|ZtnWKjUXaa	ask ur doc, there might be some problems with ur foetus. do take care!|`|OeItQKqhaa	call a doctor not ask on yahoo answers!!!|`|PlWzQPWCaa	The possibilities are far and wide.<br>  <br>  It could be a miscarriage, however, some women do have their full on periods during their entire pregnancy. I wouldn't be worried about it. I would just suggest going to your doctor, getting your labs drawn and confirming the pregnancy. Tell your doctor what is going on. It may just be the lining of your uterus shedding one last time, as you're not that far into your pregnancy.|`|Y6z8Idu0aa	I would get to your DR or urgent care right away. I've had 3 m/c at 6 weeks and my OBGYN figured out that my uterus was not strong enough to hold baby in place due to my body not making enough of progesterone on its own, so he put me on progesterone vaginal suppositories as soon as I found out i was pregnant the 4th time and that held baby in place for the first trimester. I had a healthy baby boy because of it. Ask your doc about progesterone.<br>  It may not be too late if that's whats going on. Just take it easy but get to a doc.|`|JhNw8Nxqaa	no its normal. if it keeps happening then its something to worry about many women all over have their period while pregnant believe it or not<br>  <br>  edit: yes you should still ask a doctor call the hospital for advice and search google, its normal trust me dont let the guys freak you out. you'll know when you're having a miscarriage|`|b8f0c4dd52ac9e594137b2a887faecffaa	No it is normal to have a light period during your first few months. My mother had hers with my brother and i for the first 3 months of her pregnancy's. as long as it is not heavy and extream cramping you are fine. but if you are really worried about it call your doctor and ask to talk to a nurse about it if you can not get into the doctors office right away|`|LAv8SDkyaa	Was it a light flow, or was it spotting? <br>  <br>  I spotted early on with this pregnancy and with my last. Everything was fine with my last pregnancy (my daughter is now 2 1/2 years old). I'm still progressing along quite nicely with this pregnancy.<br>  <br>  I would still check with the doctor to ease your mind and be sure that everything is okay, but it's likely that everything is okay.|`|jW6nOgaLaa	Some women still get their periods when they are pregnant. It's very rare, but does happen. I think it would be lighter because not all of the lining would need to be flushed away. It could be a miscaraige, but if it was it would be heavier than your normal period not lighter.|`|a0f596459c104e0bb843db1b87e26385aa	It is not uncommon to have spotting after becoming pregnant.  You are going to the Lab on Monday and mention it to them.<br>  In the meantime..don't worry and take it easy this weekend. <br>  |`|MJpSctFiaa	i have heard that some women spot when they first get pregnant. sounds like what's happening to you. but you should keep your appointment to be sure.|`|3DZr70ijaa	Check w/ ur doctor!!!|`|1zwTc573aa	thats weird i never heard of that<br>  
Ah9LsB7zaa	yes like she said u need to take the test but yes it is possible my cousin had her daughter when she was 14 good luck on taking care of him/her if you really are pregnant  :)|`|JusiwmMSaa	not 2 scar u or anthing but im 15 and 9 mths preg and i had my my period and discharge for about 3 mths and i dint know it but i was 6 mhs preg so get a test|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It could be either but the only way that you'll know for sure is if you take a pregnancy test. |`|LAv8SDkyaa	You should be able to take a test just about now. I would test soon, if not today. If you are pregnant, follow up with your doctor in order to get the best care possible for you and your baby. Good luck!|`|0zZZHXvVaa	their is always a possibility of pregnancy when no contraceptive was used and you do say you have a 32-40 day cycle wait another few days then test|`|02KmVVvZaa	the only way you will be able to tell is to take a test either HPT or a blood/urine test at your doctors. |`|T4NFXsT2aa	It could be one of the two, hold on a few more days to see if you get your period, if not take a test.|`|NBFHLxyaaa	take a test sweetie<br>   <br>  and u might wanna tell someone u trust that u think u may be pregnant <br>  <br>  |`|tDTWFGU9aa	You need to take a test hun!

ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	That is really hard to say. If I were you I would probably buy an ovulation test and that should tell you. I will let you know though that I bought the clear blue easy fertility monitor after 2 1/2 years of trying and it told me exactly when I was fertile and then the day I ovulated. I would highly recommend buying one of those. It worked for me. Good luck and I hope you figure out what is going on. God Bless you!|`|QFNvYVtyaa	Ovulation is the release of a single, mature egg from a follicle that developed in the ovary. It usually occurs regularly, around day 14 of a 28-day menstrual cycle. Once released, the egg is capable of being fertilized for 12 to 48 hours before it begins to disintegrate. Although there are several days of the month in which a woman is fertile, she is most fertile during the days around ovulation. Having sex at least every other day during that week is a good strategy, if you want to get pregnant.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  If you are attempting conception, predicting your ovulation period can enhance your chances of getting pregnant. The easiest and least technical method of predicting ovulation involves simply counting days. Our ovulation calendar provides an easy and free way to learn about your most fertile times.<br>  <br>  When counting days in an attempt to pin point ovulation, the first day of your period, when you start bleeding, is commonly 14 days after your ovulation.<br>  <br>  If you have a regular cycle, then this method can work for you. For example, if you have a perfect 30-day cycle, you will ovulate around day 16 (30-14=16). Day 1 is the first day of your next period. Women who frequently miss periods or have widely varying cycles will gain little information from this method. It is best to combine this method with others in order to get a more accurate determination of when you are ovulating.<br>  <br>  A better natural method involves noticing physical symptoms, which deal with ovulation such as basal body temperature, cervical mucus changes and others like lower abdominal pains, which are symptoms of ovulation. The body temperature chart is a daily recording of body temperature, which is an indicator of ovulation (body temperature will rise after ovulation). Cervical mucus monitoring involves examining the mucus that is secreted from the cervix, which enables you to predict the time of ovulation.<br>  <br>  Basal Body Temperature<br>  Another way for you to know if you are ovulating is to keep a record of where you are in your menstrual cycle. The Basal Body Temperature chart records the change in temperature that occurs after ovulation. It cannot predict when ovulation will occur in a given cycle, but by looking at records from a few cycles you can notice a pattern from which ovulation can be estimated.<br>  <br>  The best way to record and monitor body temperature is with a BBT chart. You can download a free blank Basal Body Temperature chart in two different formats: PDF or Excel Spreadsheet. This chart also includes an area to record your Cervical Mucus assessments.<br>  <br>  A BBT chart provides a good visual basis for determining ovulation:<br>  <br>  * Make sure that day one on the chart is the first day of menstruation.<br>  <br>  * Every morning, before getting out of bed or going to the bathroom, take your temperature. The use of special basal body thermometers is highly recommended for accurate results. Also, the same thermometer should be used every time.<br>  <br>  * Make note of any lack of sleep, drinking alcohol, fever, illness, or emotional stress. It is also helpful to describe the condition of any mucus or discharge.<br>  <br>  Just after ovulation, there should be a rise of approximately 0.4-0.6 degrees Fahrenheit (about 0.2 degrees Celsius). The day of ovulation there will be a slight temperature shift. The following two days will climb progressively higher. The rise on the day of ovulation is not distinguishable from the normal ups and downs in the entire pre-ovulatory phase. It is only recognized in retrospect when it forms an upward line with the two days afterward. The post-ovulatory temperatures remain at this new, higher level, until menses when they drop and start the cycle over again. If you are pregnant, your basal body temperature will stay at an elevated level. Due to the fact that the temperature shift happens during ovulation, if you are trying to get pregnant, charting your bbt for at least two months will be necessary so you can determine the point BEFORE ovulation when you are most fertile.<br>  <br>  Cervical Mucus Monitoring<br>  The presence and tactile consistency of your cervical mucus undergoes a number of changes during your menstrual cycle. By observing changes in cervical fluid, you can predict ovulation - your most fertile time for conceiving a baby.<br>  <br>  One of the purposes of cervical mucus during ovulation is to sustain the sperm in a healthy medium and to allow it to move freely through the cervix. Logically, there will be an increase in cervical mucus at ovulation, as well as a change in texture - the mucus becomes more clear, “stretchable”, and slippery.<br>  <br>  Using clean fingers, or if you prefer, toilet paper, you can examine your cervical fluid. Prior to ovulation, during non-fertile periods, you will experience a dryness (or lack of cervical mucus). Gradually, as you approach ovulation, the cervical mucus will increase, though the consistency will be “sticky” and the color will be white, yellow, or cloudy in nature.<br>  <br>  Directly prior to ovulati
hpAu41ibaa	first off you should go by how you feel, what would be best for you and the baby.<br>  Yes!! it is going to hurt but the pain goes and you are left with a beautiful baby.<br>  I did not have a epi as i couldnt imagine a drip./ needle think in my back, i opted for gas and air (quick but short pain relief)<br>  but my mother whos not good with pain had epidural.<br>  <br>  People are different so you will get answers now saying you will die from the pain and others who managed it. <br>  Its a natural thing for our bodies to go through, but on this one decide what is best for you. If you are not good with pain though opt for epi.<br>  good luck and congratz.<br>  xoxox|`|bYhqPOtwaa	Natural, but not by choice. My labor was really fast, by the time I asked for an epi it was too late. I got 1 shot of nubain(<spelling?) and I definately do not suggest that. All it did was make me sleepy, didn't even touch the pain. <br>  <br>  I'm a big wimp too. Seriously, I have NO pain tolerance. But my birth plan was to TRY to do it naturally, and if I couldn't stand it then I'd get the epidural. But obviously, it didn't work out that way. And I made it through and I'm actually kind of glad that I had the natural birth experience. I won't lie, it REALLY hurt - nobody will tell you that it doesn't. So if you want to try for a natural birth - go for it, but if the pain gets too intense it's fine to ask for the epidural. There's no need to make your mind up now. Just wait and see how it goes, and do what feels right when you're in labor.<br>  <br>  Good luck and congrats!|`|vue9NOhYaa	I had planned/hoped for a natural labor, but ended up having an epidural.<br>  <br>  I did not 'wish to die" ... I was just very, very tired. (Long labor following long prodromal.) |`|n2O0NwR6aa	I was determined not to have an epidural.  Not because I thought it would be dangerous or anything, but because I'd heard that you have to have a catheter with an epidural, and that just really creeped me out!  Haha!  Plus, I really didn't think I'd need one.  I was an athlete, in super great shape and used to all sorts of pain.  Whenever I heard those horrible labor stories from other women, I just thought, "Wimp."  Contractions are always described as a tightening of muscles... how bad can that be??<br>  <br>  Well, lemme tell you, once it started, I was begging for that epidural!  I was having back labor, and it hurt like cr@p!  But I wasn't dialated enough so they made me wait for about 6 hours before they'd call the anesthegiologist.  By the time he got there I was ready to yank that needle out of his hand and stick it in my back myself!  Omg that was the worst thing I've ever gone through!  <br>  <br>  But that was me.  My sister had natural childbirth (in one of those pool thingys), and my friend did it three times - and it was a breeze for them.  Hopefully it will be easy for you, too, no matter what you decide.  But try to remember - once it's all over and you have that beautiful baby in your arms, you really do forget about everything else!|`|cnMXJMFUaa	I've done both routes, and let me tell you I would NEVER again labor without the aid of an epidural!<br>  <br>  The pain is subjective, and you won't know until the time comes whether or not you will be able to handle it, I encourage my patients that are on the fence to TRY the natural route first, but the epidural is always available if it gets to be too much.|`|ec20340954300949b5d60c056689dd33aa	I was 17 when I had my daughter. Even then I knew I wanted a natural birth. I pushed for HOURS (6+) without any pain meds.<br>  <br>  I ended up having a c-section and they HAD to give me an epidural! <br>  This time around I plan to try natural again.(wish me luck) lol<br>  <br>  Yes, it hurts....I wont lie lol. But I think its worth it. The baby's first moments in the world are clear and not drugged. Ya know?? <br>  <br>  And this doesn't mean that i think everyone who has an epidural is awful or wrong. It's a personal choice for every woman is labor...<br>  I wish you luck!?|`|1h7Eza5qaa	I got an epidural twice, and it was fantastic.<br>  <br>  I dont believe in suffering pain when you dont have too.<br>  <br>  Even with a fear of needles, I didnt even notice when they were applying it to my back, both times it was no bother.<br>  <br>  Go for it!!|`|90zcKChJaa	I took childbirth classes and had the intention of having a natural childbirth, but once those contractions hit, I wanted anything to help with the pain of them. I received an epidural and I am soooooo happy that I did. I'm planning on getting another for the next birth!  <br>  <br>  The contractions are pain full, but if you get your mind somewhere else, then you may be able to manage the pain. Don't think about how painful it's going to be going in...then you'll look for the worst. Just think that you are going through the pain for your child. ;)<br>  <br>  Only listen to yourself. Don't let other women tell you what you should do as far as pain management. It's you that is going through this! ;) Good luck with your decision.|`|WF3FTVJoaa	i went natural with both mine but that was because i am scared of needles... it is painfull but as soon as it is over it is forgoten as you have a wonderful baby... try to relax and dont get your self worked up it is really up to you if you want an epidural and that will lessen the pain but if you geto to the hosiptal late sometimes it is not possible to have it. ask your midwife for alternative pain reliefs and get a visit around the delivery suite this will make you less anxious.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|wIz6Fv6Kaa	I've experienced both.To be honest, you would be better off waiting to decide at the very moment you go into hospital and go by the advice of the midwife.Even the best set plans don't always go the way we want, so see how things go at the time.<br>  You'll be fine, and your not the first, nor will you be the last new mum that's nervous.<br>  |`|AA11616200	  After six hours of contractions I got the epidural...I was in labor for 18 hours so this made it actually quite pleasant and having my first baby a very positive experience...even with the epidural I still had back pain but it was not unbearable.  My second baby I never had any real contractions and ended up with a c-section...also very positive.  I have great kids.|`|QCVzUC1baa	You should go in there with an open mind about pain relief, you do not know how you will be able to cope with the pain. <br>  <br>  I personally didnt want an epidural but then after 28 hours I asked for one and it was great! So after 41 hours of labour I then had to have an emergency c section. <br>  It will hurt but believe me all the pain is worth it!!!<br>  Good luck it will be fine try to stay calm and relaxed :-)|`|b3701715d7f2027b9badd9cfdd2154fcaa	I had to have an epidural throughout my entire labour because of a preexisting back condition and will do the same this time around too.  If you want pain free an epidural is the way to go, although they do let it wear off for active labour I believe, and from the small amount of pain I had when the epidural slipped out I can tell you it really seriously hurts, and I have a really high pain threshold!|`|eXsR8Gx5aa	Gas and air and birthing pool - total 36 or so hours<br>  then epidural as I needed to be monitored and wasn't allowed to move (also had the cynto drip which makes contractions go crazy) then emergency c-section<br>  <br>  I'd never have another epidural - horrible, I hated it. |`|QR9Zbs2Eaa	I had both of my kids natural...no epidural...it was not that bad..I am a sissy and i did it! TWICE. You will be fine, do what you think is best for you.|`|h9dENmckaa	I've had 3 babies, and on all 3 occasions I only had gas and air, with pethidine injection.  My labours were quite short though, suppose I've been very lucky!<br>  <br>  The pethidine injection makes you feel woozy, like when you're hungover I suppose, and you feel sleepy, but only lasts for a couple of hours.<br>  <br>  The gas and air just takes the edge off the contractions.  To be honest with you I've heard that having the epidural administered is more painful in itself.|`|YwOLE88Gaa	i had pethedine when i was admitted cus id been in labour for at least 24 hours and needed something to take the edge of, it wasnt great it made me feel a bit loopy i cud still feel the contractions but they werent as bad, wen i wanted more pain relife i was fully dialated so i went to the delivery suite and had gas and air, it didnt take the pain away but you can cope with it. i liked it cus wen i stopped takin it it wore of so i cud concentrate on pushing. i did ask for the epidural but my midwife laughed at me! she said your doing fine, and i was! <br>  everyone is different so if you want the epi have it but i wud say try the gas first you have plenty of time to think and research all the options good luck x|`|BP5ykmAmaa	lol i wanted to go all natural and have a water birth but events conspired and i had a land birth, i was advised to have an epidural as i was in labour for so long and it was going really slowly. im glad i had the epidural in a way as they have to put you on the monitors if you have one, and it was when they did that they realised the baby was in distress and had the cord wound his neck, so they did an assissted delivery and he was born as a vontuse delivery.<br>  we are trying for another baby but this time i dont want anything other than gas and air. but go in open minded and liksten to the advice you are given. if you can manage without then fair play, but you dont get medals for going without pain relief, if you need it ask for it! there is no shame in it, everyone is different nad every birth is different..<br>  <br>  good luck hun you'll do fine x|`|RBZnNmTkaa	well with my 1st i had pethidine gas and air with my 2nd i just had gas and air and with my 3rd i had gas and air. ifelt it did not hurt that much but then i have been diagniosed with having too much colagen so i am very strechy i think that is why i was not in much pain when it came to the pushing. it was a lot easier than what you hear. i was very scared with my first i went into the delivery and they was a women next door screaming and i just started crying i thought i was gonna die. but it was ok when it came to it all it just felt natural. don't be to scared it's ok. and you do forget about the pain once you have your bundle of joy in your arms. good luckxx|`|9EMlY4lZaa	I had three natural childbirths. I never regretted it. It was an awesome experience. Sure it can get pretty dang painful, but there are many wonderful ways to work through the pain, and even to be pain free. I did it, and I am not a special type of human. I feel pain, just like everybody else. But, I used my knowledge of birth and how our bodies are able to labor without fear. I was not a screaming lunitic. I was in control and I worked through each contration with confidence and peace. That the key. Don't be afraid. Learn all you can about your body and how it is meant to birth a baby without drugs. Comparring a natural childbirth and a medicated childbirth are like comparring apples and oranges. |`|EaezAUrUaa	Yes it's really THAT bad! That being said, it is a pain you can work through if you can just remember it won't last forever. You get moments in between contractions to step back and tell yourself that was one less contraction I have to go through before I see my baby. I made it through 18 hours of labor doing this, but ended up needing an emergency c-section. I am planning a water birth VBAC at my local community birthing center for my baby due in 5 weeks! I am excited to give it another shot at experiencing what our bodies were meant to do ~ give birth! I feel like I will have a sense of extreme empowerment that will change my life!|`|AA11270571	Trust me, I was scared as hell too. My water broke and I didn't feel anything!! They said I was having contractions, but I couldn't feel it. So I though that I could go natural. Almost 20hrs into labor I couldn't handle it anymore. I had to get the epidural!! But I did get 2 shots of nubain in my iv, so that helped a whole lot!! It just depends on your pain tolerance. Usually mine is high, but that was a pain unlike no other!! lol Good luck!!|`|sINAaRudaa	Both my kiddies i had only gas n air plus a injection i can't remember the name but both natural hope so with this one my first was 9 hrs and 45 mins and my second was 9 hrs and 35 mins hope all goes well<br>  <br>  Pethadine that the one|`|60a20811e5cbf8f085c0afb72b184e44aa	I did epidural and will do it again. There should be no shame in it and if people are pressuring you but you aren't comfortable with that then you need to listen to yourself and go with your heart.<br>  |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I am also in my first pregnancy. I am 20 weeks now and I've already decided that I am going with the epidural. The only way I will go natural is if the doctors tell me I have to. |`|Ni3hjtlsaa	The pain is unbelievable. Most women that say they want to go natural change their minds once they get a dose of what it feels like. You'll be so upset with the pain that you won't even get to enjoy the experience.|`|CExEqa4Raa	I got the epidural after being in active labor for 5 hours and it worked instantly! I will definitely be getting it again when I have another baby. I had back labor and it was VERY uncomfortable!|`|7wZoPVChaa	i went with the epidural after a few intense contractions... i have a pretty high pain tolerance and it was still too much for me to bear, i felt like i was dying.lol... good luck!!|`|MO0Tha5taa	Gas and air natural birth.
FT5GUAXyaa	Well sometimes home pregnancy test are wrong - You could look online for free pregnancy test at a clinic near you. While head aches are a sign of pregnancy you shouldn't rely on pregancy as an answer to why your feeling different. it could be something worse so my advice is get yourself checked out, hon. =] hope i was some kind of help...|`|90zcKChJaa	It doesn't sound like it from the symptoms that you named. But remember that anytime you have unprotected sex you can get pregnant.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	You could be. There are women who've been pregnant and a hpt didn't pick up the hormone for some reason. All the symptoms you have I've also experienced and I know I'm pregnant. I would make an appointment with your doctor to find out if you are or whatever else is causing you to be so late and all the symptoms. Good luck!
PIfaJRuoaa	They ask you a lot of questions, fill out tons of paperwork.  They also do a pap smear and pelvic exam.  I also had my blood drawn for some tests.  They will try to hear the heartbeat.  They will give you an estimated due date and usually schedule an ultrasound for a more accurate due date.|`|kNPHNBZUaa	blood work to check for stds, blood type, and blood count, prob. a pap and ultrasound to confirm the pregnancy it only takes about 30 mins unless they make you wait for results|`|HuXv5Owvaa	my 1st visit they did a pap took a urine sample and took out sooo much blood i though i was going to pass out. my 1st prenatal was fast.. i guess it depends. |`|rFx5J1b7aa	They give you pils and everynone talks to you checks your pelvis blah blah blah. Might take blood. |`|4AO2myzKaa	Mine had an ultrasound and pap smear, also blood work.  They also gave me a packet of info about prenatal appts (a schedule of when to schedule them as well as what to expect each week) and healthy eating/lifestyle choices.  They also let me voice any concerns I had.  It was about 1.5 hrs total.|`|tkSXjqhuaa	For me they did a pelvic exam && asked questions... found out medical history, etc. <br>  <br>  Congrats && Goodluck.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	They mainly just go over all of your family history. That takes the longest. They check your blood pressure and they do a pap smear. At mine they didn't listen for a heartbeat but the next day I did have an ultrasound to determine my due date and I got to hear it then. Good luck tomorrow and Congrats!|`|cHJ1Xf2saa	My appointment lasted maybe 30mins,<br>  Doctor did a vaginal ultrasound (100% painless)<br>  Not much to see at this point, they will check for the yolk sac, amniotic fluid and try to hear a heartbeat. They may do a pap smear and a regular gynecological checkup.|`|la1KlgJ3aa	My appt was 1/2 hour. They did a pap.. asked family history questions - calculated my due date and gave me an appt for blood work and an ultrasound.. then blood work was for a bunch of things including checking for Hep, Aids.. etc... good luck!!!|`|97Fr4s6Waa	My first was a bunch of questions.<br>  Second was a pelvie and making an appointment for ultrasound for 8 week.<br>  Didn't take no 2 hours though. Maybe half an hour
ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I think everyone is different because I have a few friends that are about as far along as me and they feel better then I do. I know that I feel blah most of the time. I can do other things but I feel tired all the time and I get headaches a lot which really kick my butt. Good luck and I hope things get better for you. |`|4AO2myzKaa	It does go away...I got most of my strength back around week 16 when I stopped throwing up all the time.  I'm still tired a lot when I get home, but it's not as bad...though I still feel lethargic and would rather watch TV etc. then go for a walk....and I was NEVER a couch potato before this!|`|VfmwKkGwaa	I am 8 weeks, and I feel the same way.  My pregnant friends keep telling me it goes away at about 13 weeks, so keep your chin up, you're getting there.|`|rC6gL7KOaa	Every pregnancy is different. My first pregnancy I had constant sickness but don't remember being tired at all. This pregnancy I'm nauseous on and off, and I'm tired ALL THE TIME. It seems like every time I sit down, all I want to do is take a nap. I go home on my lunch breaks and take a nap. Really don't know what we can do about it though. I just enjoy the naps.|`|AA11222790	I felt like that the first few months. IT is slowly starting to go away.  As each day passes I have more and more energy.
zhHoHRRmaa	I think it might be to early to tell, but don't stress about it cause it can cause u to be late. I would wait a few more weeks!!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I think it is a bit to early to tell. I would wait a few weeks and if you still feel that way and you don't get your period then take a test. Good luck.|`|kNPHNBZUaa	pregnant women back aches because of the shift in pelvic alignment which happens about 20 weeks, and they don't get morning sickness till 6-8 weeks, but 14 days after you period you are the most fertile and sperm can survive up to 72 hrs. most test can be preformed 5 days before you start but i got a neg pregnancy test after 1 week late it didn't come up positive till i was already 8 weeks|`|rFx5J1b7aa	That has happened to me and I wasnt pregnant.  
ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Well if you had unprotected sex and came inside her then there is always a high risk that she will get pregnant. All you can do is wait and see if she misses her period and if so then she needs to take a test. Think about wearing protection if you aren't ready to be a daddy.|`|1QCjdSuvaa	No one can give you a definite answer on this. If she was ovulating or about to ovulate then it is likely although not 100% guaranteed. <br>  <br>  You'll have to wait it out and see. |`|nKiiFtjDaa	sex=baby. be responsible.|`|KhXX0vWNaa	it really depends on her cycle,but i bet she is prego. Congrats. how old r u? i bet u feel the slightest bit dumb now dont u?|`|D3Il4sZ0aa	like they done said u wont know untill later so u 2 need to talk things over n start to think next time be for u do it again!!!  because it can and will happen with no warning|`|3hYfl0EEaa	she could be it depends on if she was ovulating hope yo wanted this if she was good luck|`|0VEvT0BAaa	it depends on the girls cycle. maybe|`|f3fNb9Icaa	**** man, u better hope ur infertile|`|IvSfx25paa	could be... if this isnt what you 2 want & I am guessing it isnt then run to CVS & grab Plan B....given it hasnt been longer than 3 days.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.go2planb.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.go2planb.com</a><br>  |`|vQpkkHQZaa	Pretty dang likely! Congrats papa!
fc3045470b792b9f04d696b7f2f9cd91aa	It's not likely you would be pregnant.|`|horefBCyaa	it's not likely. but not altogether impossible.|`|90zcKChJaa	no. use a condom if you are not ready for a baby.|`|FXaHv4lgaa	Unlikely.  But why have sex when you still haven't learned all the knowledge that goes with it.  Is this a wise way to live?|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	If you got your period then I would think that the chances are slim. |`|4dd9374df6045331049807f2de428a9aaa	Probably not. Wrap it up next time!|`|P5BZWCy8aa	If it was your regular period, at the expected time .. the answer is probably not. In order to become pregnant, a woman needs to have a few days before, or the day of ovulation. Ovulation generally happens mid cycle,, meaning aprox two weeks AFTER your period (assuming you have a text book 28 day cycle) That said, some women do ovulate a bit earlier or later in their cycle. <br>  <br>  good luck to you in the future.
RQPqbpxVaa	Defiantly wrong place to post.. but try talking to your school nurse about it.  They could call her in to the nurses office and tell her what's up.  This would probably cut out the awkwardness of having a classmate break the news to her.  Also it would help save embarrassment of someone else hearing and teasing.  Granted it may be gross, but there may be something going on that you don't know about that is probably already embarrassing for her.  Try to keep it on the down low.  <br>  <br>  And calling her an it is not a very kind thing to do to someone.  Even if she never hears it, it's extremely rude.  I'd guess to say she doesn't want to be the outcast and probably doesn't know what to do to change it.  |`|ovgxECKsaa	Bring this to your teacher's attention.  He/She is better equipped to handle such situations.  The teacher can contact the girl's parents about the issue.  This girl may have a bad home situation that needs attention.|`|90zcKChJaa	why is this in the pregnancy section? |`|oIxZbPSRaa	Tell a teacher and they will talk to them or have a school nurse talk to them that way they are taught how to not be stinky...my mom is a school teacher and whenever they have a "stinky" kid they send them to the nurse and have it all set up so that the nurse will talk to them about hygiene.|`|fb8cf1b6c2124ec3abca58d3c8ea4a2baa	I'm going with the first answer - why in the pergnancy section?|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Either ignore it or say something. Why did you post this in the pregnancy section?|`|Icg2Oj0oaa	first off how dont u no if itsa  girl or guy and second this is the pregnancy section ... and thirdly if this is true i would tell him or her please keep ur hygiene cus u stink 
s7jfeFELaa	buy on black friday that's what i'm doing you will save a lot. good luck and congrats!!!!!!!!|`|yPNvecc7aa	I think you're good to go now hun! lol<br>  <br>  I'm 14 weeks and I already have some stuff.|`|fPX1lD8uaa	I'd say around 7 - 8 months... unless your having a baby shower and then I would wait until after before buying anything.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I'm 20 weeks pregnant and my husband and I have already bought the furniture for our baby. I think as soon as you want to you can. |`|eI02IpWdaa	i would say if your having a baby shower to wait...but if not as soon as you want..specially before it gets harder for you to do anything.|`|zKsNQKvqaa	Buy it now while you have the $$<br>  Get furniture everything<br>  if it is on sale too|`|Fm3L8vsYaa	in my opinion around 7 months|`|AA12226266	that's when i started i think its a good time to do so . if you wait till the end you will be so tired that going to the store will not be in your plans . good luck and congrats|`|DaR2zyJcaa	Probably soon. You never know when your baby might decide to come. Good Luck
lc00ihEiaa	Is the pain constant or does it come and go. If it is constant you probably pulled something and should say off your feet. If it is comming and going you should go to the maternity ward to make sure your not in early labor. If for any reason you are in early they can postpone it for now.|`|0Sv8PiH9aa	The pain you felt was probably just ligiment pain. I got worried once too because me and my bf got into an argument and I was worried the stress hurt the baby. They checked the heartrate and he was fine. You should call your doctor and get his opinion so you can feel better, but I'm sure you and your baby are fine. :)|`|l1SEeBuFaa	go see your doctor just to be on the safe side, but your probably fine if your not bleeding or anything, i get pains like that from just going grocery shopping! Good luck!|`|UKaMlqJUaa	Are you having any bleeding? If your bleeding then I would go. When is your next appointment? If you can wait till then I think you will be fine unless your bleeding. But if you feel the pain is too bad that you cant walk or even sit then I wuold go see the doctor asap. Try taking a nice warm bath. Or shower if you perfer. Hope everything turns out fine.|`|vK2Fl3yZaa	Its always best to be safe than sorry... go see a doctor or er, either or.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I would call your doctor and see what he says first. 
r4N3R0dtaa	Take a pregnancy test, if you only had your period for a day and it's usually longer, there's a chance it could have been implantation bleeding.|`|y4HntWjOaa	No it must be ur period problem<br>  <br>  i didnt hav my period for like 2 weeks and i thought i was pregnant but its just ur period actin up.|`|h5aAbmGUaa	its possible|`|dDVAUA9saa	Take a pregnancy test.<br>  <br>  Do you still.....what????|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It is very possible. Take a test and find out. Good luck!
GUUgeptjaa	Around 22-24 weeks.  What is really cool is to see them moving, but that did not happen until I was around 32-34 weeks|`|u9sGH0AXaa	I could feel her kick around 25 weeks, and I could feel her with my hands around 28.  Whenever I told my husband to feel her kick, she stopped moving!  She was playing hide and seek from daddy.  Now that I'm 37 weeks and my whole belly shifts when she moves around int there, he can definitely feel it.  It just depends on when your baby decides to show daddy how hard they can kick. Hang in there.  Good luck and congrats!<br>  <br>  |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	My husband and I didn't get to feel her kick until last Saturday and I would've been 20 weeks on Sunday. I could feel her moving around inside but I couldn't feel her with my hands until then. |`|4CqPo6Ohaa	My partner felt our little guy kick at about 22 weeks but not very strongly. Now at 32 1/2 weeks it's amazing how much he moves around in there. You can see my stomach moving around under my clothes. <br>  Since you are a little bigger it will probably take a little longer. You should start feeling her soon. Good luck. |`|ugTZWQCsaa	My hubby was able to feel the baby at 19 weeks, but I was 5'7" 147 lbs pre-pregnancy. And weight definetly has something to do with it. But I would think he should be able to start feeling the baby within the next few weeks.
HF4c1y6laa	look between the legs (not yours, the babies)|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	the clinic we use asks you to drink/eat somethng high sugar or caffine to make baby active<br>  ive drank coffee and ate sweets b4 mine and baby didnt stand a chance of hiding his bits poor thing couldnt keep still long enough!<br>  ice cold coke worked with my last baby x|`|jQDeTTVhaa	I drank water but have way through she let me go empty my bladder thank god lol but I found out before I did so.Good luck most people say dring orange juice it works|`|afW58le8aa	I would drink some juice before hand and make sure that you have a full bladder.  The ultrasound tech has an easier time getting good pictures of the baby if you have a full bladder.  It will be uncomfortable with all the pushing on your stomach and having to go to the bathroom.  Be prepared to hold it in.|`|AA12089586	I didn't drink anything but water.  and they could tell what our little bub was.<br>  I have heard tho that if you drink too much stuff to make your baby move alot, they might NOT be able to tell you because they are so active.  That's just what i have heard.<br>  Maybe try orange juice instead, pop isn't good for you anyway!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I heard to drink tons of water with a little bit of juice. I didn't drink much juice but she allowed us to see between her legs anyway. I think it depends on how active your baby usually is. Good luck. No matter what it will be perfect.|`|UWy4jnV8aa	Try to drink some OJ or just something with sugar or caffeine. I drank a little bit of pop but it had no caffeine. But my little one decided to wiggle the top half of its body so much but never did it let its legs uncross! I have a stubborn or shy baby.Haha. Good luck! 
mFQydvncaa	i normally would say yes its to soon! but women are differnt you can get pregnant right before or even while on your period, it just depends on your ovulation time. the blood afterthe period could be 2 things, one old blood which happens sometimes or implantation. i still dont think you would feel symptoms yet, i felt the tiredness right awayeven before i knew! so take a test in a few days and see what it says! dont stress, it can make you notice things that always happen and youll turn it all into symptoms, i have been there!! so goodluck and ae sure if you areto start prenatal care right away and if you arnt, and if you dont want a baby please continue birthcontrol! |`|68e6778f68d4febab53279e39853dda0aa	I don't think you are, but it may be just that. Taking a test would ease you concerns.<br>  <br>  Also tell that BF of yours to stop it.|`|dc49c98de42051d1d8cf7f78ea317140aa	I'm in a situation that is similar to yours right now.  It's usually difficult to get pregnant during your period, but you did say that your boyfriend came inside you two days before your period.  That period of time is usually your ovulation time, which means an egg has been released.  <br>  <br>  My husband and I had unprotected intercourse when I was ovulating, and like you, I spotted pink that night.  Then, I had some scant brown spotting the day after.  Not to mention the pain in my abdomen.  Before I knew it, I was nauseated, fatigued, ad was making frequent trips to the loo.  My period is ten days late today, and I am finally going to test.<br>  <br>  So, in answer to your question, it's not too early to experience pregnancy symptoms.  However, your mind can sometimes play tricks on you into thinking you are pregnant.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|50d9895ddc13ab2083d9e8772bb91066aa	very definetly too soon, most likely you wont get pregnant at all. ovulation doesnt happen for atleast a week or so after your period, and the sperm wouldnt live that long. cravings can also be a normal part of your period. |`|g71y13voaa	thats wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy to early... if u think its that bad go to a gyno or go to a midwife|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	WAY TOO EARLY!
AA10015577	To me it sounds like you are pregnant.  I was supposed to have my period on the 8th of this month as well and I took a test on the 10th, which came out positive.  I really think that you should test, why would you be scared?  Have you been late on a period before and you tested which came out negative?  <br>  <br>  Frequent urination may be one of the earliest symptoms of pregnancy because the growing uterus stretches to the base of the bladder.   <br>  <br>  Good luck and baby baby baby dust!!!!<br>  |`|GjuRYsITaa	sounds like you will get a positive|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Well with all of those symptoms and being late I would say the chances are pretty good. Now go take a test. It's the only way to know for sure. Good luck!|`|mFQydvncaa	sounds like me!!!!babydust and id say you are!!! timeto take a test!! goodluck!!! go buy a bunch othe dollarstore kind they ready the highest sensitivety level at 25. mine popped up right away!!!!!|`|15pg3g8aaa	I think you should def take a test. They have a fabulous website called mymonthlycycles.com where you can chart all this for free and it will calculate all this stuff out for you|`|zqfs7A6Caa	Buy a couple tests from one of those "Everything is $1.00 Stores. Then you will have a good idea of whether or not you are preggy. If you are, you can go to a community clinic for advice, prenatal checkup, and vitamins (you need lots of folic acid). Good luck :)|`|fx5uBEy1aa	You defiantly need to take a test honey!! i had very similar symptoms and took a test on the day my period was due and it was pos.  take a test!!! Good luck sweety.|`|CJ7ww2Guaa	Charting things out like the will drive you CRAZY.  You can also cause yourself to have symptoms just because you want to be pregnant so badly.  <br>  <br>  My husband and I were trying to have a baby last month and I took a very early pregnancy test that was positive (I took it like 2 days after I ovulated and I wasn't due to have my period for almost 2 weeks) I was so excited and the very next morning I started feeling the symptoms of pregnancy, nausea, fatigue and even the odd "tingling" cramping sensation I felt with my son. <br>  <br>  Just to be sure (because the line was very faint on the first test) I took the other test in the pack 2 days later, well it was negative.  I was so disappointed, but I told myself well it's probably a false negative because I didn't use my first morning urine.  <br>  <br>  So my husband went to the store and got the early result tests, and the next morning I took another test with first morning urine and it was also negative.  But I just couldn't accept that with all my symptoms and the first positive test that I wasn't pregnant.<br>  <br>  Long story short... A roller coaster ride of emotions and about 30 dollars later I got my period.<br>  <br>  I later found out that my egg most likely had been fertilized but did not implant.  Causing the surge of pregnancy hormones that the positive test picked up on, and because of the hormones my period also came late.|`|mplwX2Yvaa	omg the same thing is happening to me <br>  but with the difference that i havent get my period yet, im supposed to get it like around the 20...<br>  yesterday i was about to buy the pregnacy test but then i dicided not to buy and wait for my period...<br>  if i was you i would do a pregnacy test to know if im pregnant...<br>  good luck
50d9895ddc13ab2083d9e8772bb91066aa	well from my own experience (3 pregnancies) my "baby bump" would be very tender from fairly early on, I couldn't lay on my stomach or wear pants that were snug without being uncomfortable. Your probably just fine, but it would be a good idea to see your doctor and check, and of course if it hurts, don't push on it. |`|4TMhz9Nhaa	Erm, i wouldn't say its normal..not that early anyway as the baby is right down in your pelvic area.<br>  But, then again everyone is different.<br>  It may just be bloating which is causing you to feel tender in that area.<br>  If your worried call your doctor, you should go to the docs as soon as possible anyway to register your pregnancy and to get your first scan, so mention it when you go just to be safe!<br>  good luck =]|`|syE6f9B1aa	go see the doctor thats whats you ae paying them for.|`|ldEbjiLNaa	Is what normal?<br>  <br>  Pressing your own stomach regularly?  No.<br>  <br>  Having a tender stomach if you keep pressing it?  Probably.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I would call your doctor.
91x3trOnaa	Not hard yet.  The baby isn't even big enough to be above your pelvic bone until 13 weeks.|`|01vMpHkWaa	hard|`|kG6VWsGvaa	If anything, it'd be hard. But not everybody shows as early as 8 weeks or even 16 weeks.|`|bIyBUC88aa	it depends, its different for every woman. at 2 months you wouldnt be hard but i would say you would be getting hard close to 4 months.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I don't think my stomach got harder until about month 5. It's not hard hard but it's not all gushy anymore.

RIGHT?? BUT IF I FOUND OUT..HIS *** WOULD BE ON THE STREET|`|AA11938787	Yes. And why is this in the pregnancy section?|`|3X7rwFPhaa	of course i would want to know...so i can kick his and her a**. that should make me feel better!..lol<br>  <br>  
AA10315542	Yes, you SHOULD be able to tell.  They say 16 weeks, but you are so close.|`|bIvsLrCUaa	They may be able too, If your baby cooperates. Its possible. Good Luck :)<br>  <br>  & Congrats :)|`|PFO1jxZGaa	most likely not and at this point it would really only be a guess anyway, the baby is still too tiny to see anything for sure|`|mc6YtaRbaa	It is possible if the baby cooperates and they have a clear view. Sometimes they can't this early. Most of the time, they say you have to wait until 20 weeks, but some lucky people have found out earlier than that.|`|yznZqcznaa	Maybe!  You can usually tell at 16 weeks but a lot of Drs wont tell you till closer to 20.  However if the baby is in the right position they may just be able to tell you.|`|AA11787590	They might be able to tell this early if baby will cooperate. The scan for gender is usually done around 20 weeks though. Good luck.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	They usually try to tell the gender at 20 weeks so that they can give you a more accurate answer but my best friend found out the sex of her baby at 12 weeks and they were right. I'm sure that the u/s tech can look at tell you what she thinks but just remember that it may not be as accurate as it would be in a few more weeks.|`|I7myOp8Qaa	15 weeks might be a bit too early. Usual by 20 weeks the baby is big enough to see details like sex. If you are lucky the genital organs may be big enough when you go in. However the baby may not cooperate so be prepared. Good luck!|`|xtVelindaa	sometimes yes! i found out at 15 wks too! lol sometimes things get in the way but normally you can tell from 16-18 wks. since you are having a detailed scan you might. hopefully they will be able to. congrats! ?<br>  ? Elizabeth Lynn|`|qygYwdRpaa	Hi yes they can i found out i was having a girl at 14 weeks of pregnancy and they were right she is 5 months old today!<br>  <br>  Good luck and congratulations! |`|gFiRi5xnaa	You'll probably have to wait until 20 weeks since things are still unproportional right now. |`|BbW5unM8aa	They might say that it looks like a boy or girl but it is to early to tell for sure, Usually they wait until at least 18 weeks to check gender. GL|`|AA11284789	they may be able to, usually around 20 weeks....goodluck|`|HntAuUW3aa	they may be able to |`|BQsT9ICxaa	Technically they can after 14 weeks, but they may not be able to get a clear shot.  If it is a boy and they can see the parts then they will tell you, if it is a girl or the boy just is shy and not showing his parts, it may come back inconclusive.  But they will try to look today.  Good Luck|`|hcbbWwLpaa	if there doing it today then yes. it all depends on baby's position. if its a girl she already has her   ovaries at 12wks and if its a boy he might let you see but i found out with my first son at 14wks so you should be fine every kid develops differently|`|sWaOWFBKaa	I believe they can. I think an early ultrasound (to know the sex of the baby) is 16 weeks, so just ask. Good luck|`|56aaecf1bac1ef2038906a4f9e3f98edaa	maybe but its to soon.
AA12033653	I would think that they would only do a drug test if they suspected that you were using.  Typically if the doctors/nurses think that you are an unfit parent they will have a social worker come in a talk to you before you are discharged from the hospital.  <br>  <br>  My aunt was in the hospital after delivering her 5th child, and the hospital staff was concerned that she was not bonding with her baby while she was in the hospital, because she would go outside to smoke.  When the Social worker came in, they saw her with her other 4 children (ages from 2-18) and they decided that the staff was incorrect in their assumptions.  <br>  <br>  I am sure if the social worker decided that you had a problem, then no they would not take the baby from you but they could start legal proceedings.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|bIvsLrCUaa	You shouldn't be smoking pot when your pregnant. They should take the baby if your positive for it because obviously your an irresponsible addict. Its sorry if you can't even quit when carrying such precious cargo. I don't know if they will, but they should.|`|PFO1jxZGaa	If u are so concerend about it just quit smoking. It is harming your baby inside you anyway. Pot cant be more important than having a healthy baby|`|A2XYCdOYaa	No I doubt very much they will test for it (there would be no reason!) and even if they did they wouldn't take the baby off you!!<br>  <br>  EDIT - I'm taking it most the people answering are not from England?  Because over here things work a little differentley, they even let Heroin addicts keep their babies so long they can prove they are trying to be clean!  So I don't think a bit of weed is going to hurt, but then I don't know other contry's laws.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	yes they do (at least in Louisiana they do) and if you test positive they say they can. That's what all the previous pregnant girls told me anyway (not sure if they really take it). I don't do them i wouldn't risk my baby for some weed, i know a girl who smoked through out her pregnancy and stopped short of her 8th month. The baby had a lot wrong with it so i wouldn't recommend it to anyone.|`|yznZqcznaa	DEFACS needs to take the child away from you because you are an unfit parent if you are smoking pot while pregnant.  Your baby is probably going to be mentally handicapped.  Hope you know how to deal with that.|`|3dxwK9v3aa	I seriously hope you are not asking this question becaue you have or are thinking about doing drugs while pregnant. I hope you are asking out of curiosity!<br>  <br>  I not sure if they screen your urine/blood for substances of this nature or not. It is possible, I guess. I work in a clinic and have seen many pregnant women be screened for drugs while pregnant becasue they had a history of drug abuse. If they tested positive for any substance while pregnant they were taken to jail and placed under supervisory watch as they were considered to be a threat to their baby's life. I would assume there would be similar consequences in the situation you asked about, though I am not 100% sure.|`|AA11635143	A woman in my city has had her baby taken by DCS and she was sent to prison for child abuse and child endangerment.  Her baby was born deformed as a result of her using drugs.<br>  <br>  Another woman had DCS breathing down her neck  before she gave birth.  The doctor reported her when she first came to him and her pregnancy was confirmed.  DCS went to her house and warned her that she had no choice, it was stop then or they would take the baby.  He reported every urine and blood test to DCS.  The baby died right after birth because of the drug addiction and she was charged with murder. <br>  <br>  If you are using marijuana you are not fit to be a mother.  Already you don't care if the baby is born deformed, brain damaged, or dead.  If you did you would never have had to post this question. Don't try and tell any of us that you love your baby, that just isn't true.|`|xtVelindaa	it may show up in a blood test... why would you be smoking pot while pregnant?!?! i used to smoke it all the time, the second i found out i quit, had my daughter 2 weeks ago and i still havent. if thats your main concern then i feel bad for your daughter. if they see it then they may... but pot doesnt last too long in your system unless you take an excessive amount. if it is in your system they wont take your baby most likely, please be more careful.<br>  ? Elizabeth Lynn|`|Swtvqg8jaa	They don't do those kind of tests after you have a baby but they do ask you if you smoke, etc.<br>  A friend of mine smoked pot once and a while through out her pregnancy, I did not agree with it, but her little girl came out healthy and happy. Though smoking pot is just as dangerous as smoking cigarettes while pregnant.<br>  Good Luck|`|tQPvv0Glaa	No, they don't test you but if the baby shows signs they will test the baby.  Unfortunately, nothing really happens even if the baby does test positive.  I know a girl who's baby was born addicted to coke - CPS was called but nothing happened.|`|fPX1lD8uaa	I'm sure they test the baby after you deliver for drugs and alcohol.. and if they find any traces in the baby, I'm sure DYFS gets involved and they will try to take the baby from you.|`|gFiRi5xnaa	They take a urine sample at every doctor appointment.  but especially at delivery time, you must not want your baby if you're still doing pot. It comes out of your system after 30 days or so, at least that's what I heard on science shows.|`|mVD3TQkFaa	What happens is your an Fing loser who doesn't deserve a child! Don't smoke weed while your pregnant then you won't have to worry about it. |`|c0tmmjRZaa	They don't normally test for that unless if you have something in your medical record that makes them concerned about, or if you or the baby shows signs of drug use. If you test positive for pot they are legally bond to call in a social worker and file a police report. Usually a baby stays in the hospital for two to three days, more if the mother needs to stay longer. That is plenty of time to run tests on the baby to make sure everything is okay... If you were doing pot during your pregnancy and are still doing it, you are very likely to lose your child.<br>  <br>  Just stop, baby's are expensive, why waste your money on pot.<br>  <br>  S|`|BbW5unM8aa	Most hospitals do test. It just depends on your state I believe. They could test the baby... Anyway they will not take your baby away for testing positive for marijuana. It happened to a friend of mine and they sent social services over a couple times to make sure everything looked safe in the home and then dropped it.<br>  <br>  My OB takes a urine sample when I go, but she doesn't test for drugs... I know that for sure. I had to go to the hospital once to make sure everything was fine because he wasn't active and they took a urine sample... but also did not test for drugs.|`|po3UgWauaa	yes they do test. My Aunt was tested for everything and it came back negative, the woman in the next bed wasn't so lucky, she had the baby taken away and after 1 year she was allowed supervised visits to the foster home. The social workers kept doing regular checks on the mother. Not too sure what happened or if she ever got her baby back. Mmmm scary and something to consider|`|YAuig5spaa	If you've had a history of drugs, or except that you have done drugs then they will probably test the baby, I know a girl that done drugs while she was pregnant and they blood tested the baby for it and she has to deal with social workers, so they won't test you but they might the baby.|`|VU7FsBR3aa	The hospital does do a drug test in the ones that I have been to and if the baby is positive for drugs they get the child pertective services involved and more then likely you may not be taking the baby home or you will have a case opened up on you and will be monitored|`|ZRNlwu5laa	No they do not test. However, if you are asking for yourself then you do not deserve to have a child if you are smoking pot when pregnant. That is horrible and I feel terrible for the little on inside you. If you want to fry your own brain then go ahead but don't hurt an unborn child. |`|AA11284789	they will  know!!!!!   because they do all bloodwork.... you shouldnt be smoking that crap especially when you are pregnant. Im not sure they will call family services or not..... That is really sad.... they should call family services....its sad when a mom to be is smoking anything especially one that has been proven to not be addictive!!!|`|U67DfN5naa	Yes, they always test the baby for drugs and if its positive they will call cps and your child will most likely be taken away.|`|BQsT9ICxaa	If you have smoked pot when you are pregnant then they should take your child away from you.  |`|gseSpMCGaa	I have no idea if they do or not. But your question makes me think maybe they should. >.>|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Why would you even need to worry about that? That's just horrible.

I am almost 18 weeks and have been feeling "flutters" for about a week now, and although I'm still not positive they are the baby, I'm pretty sure that's what I'm feeling. Still no real "kick" yet though.|`|WBV16h9jaa	I felt mine at 20 weeks.

AA10196172	If you haven't had a period since August, then you could be having hormonal issues. (Also, if you are too thin, not enough body fat, periods can stop too.)  Best to see a doctor.<br>  <br>  Just because you aren't having periods does not mean you cannot get pregnant. it just means the ovulation timing is as unreliable as the periods - it could happen any time. That's all the more reason to take precautions if you don't want to get pregnant.<br>  <br>  Could you be? Unlikely, but not impossible. It's been about 2 weeks, most tests should be pretty reliable now; but of course if you do have hormone problems, you may need to take a doctor's test for accurate results. <br>  If you were 4 months along, I think you'd notice something by now.|`|EmYNUZcXaa	TAKE A FRIGGIN' TEST!! DUH SMART ONE!|`|wUX12PU0aa	to me it sounds like your pregnant! those tests can be wrong, you need to be tested my a doctor.  the bleeding can just be some spotting, but you really need to see a doctor.|`|P9T2eMFhaa	Okay, whether you are pregnant or not please do the entire world a favor and NEVER HAVE SEX AGAIN.<br>  <br>  Please, never reproduce. Ever.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	That's really hard to answer because you hadn't had your period since August. I would speak to your doctor. There could be something wrong.|`|xyI7PRuhaa	could be implantation bleeding.  |`|mEgAbQVwaa	take another test 
CP1zxDLiaa	It is very possible but you wont know until you take a home pregnancy test. Even then you have a chance of it being negative. Mine was negative until AFTER i missed my period. Then every test after that was positive. I too had headaches, but my main give away was cramping 2 weeks before my period and then missing my period. <br>  <br>  good luck!!|`|QBb3Axmpaa	Try taking a home pregnancy test, they are extremely accurate.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	You could be but the big question is-Have you missed your period or anything?|`|r4E2zXL8aa	sounds possible. go buy a test. i'd say you just might be pregnant... the throwing up was a dead give away.|`|afW58le8aa	Of course, those are all very classic symptoms.

4d8yOK3iaa	here are the most common early pregnancy symtpoms.<br>  <br>  Sore Tender breast/ nipples or the feeling of them being full or heavy. And possible veins appearing and darkening of the areolas.<br>  <br>  Fatigue: Even with a full nights rest you will find yourself crashing and having to take a nap in the middle of the day.<br>  <br>  Nausea or vomitting<br>  <br>  Food cravings or adversions<br>  <br>  increase in smell<br>  <br>  mood swings<br>  <br>  Headaches/ dizziness<br>  <br>  Slight cramping/ backaches<br>  <br>  Increase in cm discharge<br>  <br>  Implantation bleeding: only about 25% of people experience this one.<br>  <br>  And late ore missed period.<br>  <br>  ive heard that if you have 3 or more of these symptoms, then pregnancy is high, but if you have 1-2 symptoms then its pms probably. Not all women will experience symtpoms but a missed period. Some symptoms you may never have. And others wont occur till later on. Just wait till your period is due or late and then take a preg test, thats the best way of knowing. Good luck and hope that you get the answer you want. |`|S7XTl9NCaa	Early pregnancy symptoms can include, but aren't limited to... bloating, gassy, booby pain or tingles, headches, lower back pain, peeing more, extra good sense of smell.... <br>  <br>  And no, not every woman is the same. Some don't have symptoms until later, some have them very early.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	You may just be pmsing. When I found out I was pregnant I didn't have any symptoms until about 4 weeks or so except for my nipples hurting really bad. After that I was just really sleepy for a few weeks. My symptoms really didn't start until the second trimester. |`|a4a2BKHAaa	common pregnancy symptoms are listed at <a href="http://www.easyninemonths.com/pregnancy_symptoms.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.easyninemonths.com/pregnancy_...</a>|`|eD7qRBKHaa	Depends on the person - I had no symptoms until 6 weeks when I started throwing up.  That was all I had for a few weeks, then I got terrible heartburn.
ZTi5eol8aa	Well, I think it's just about 99%positive you are pregnant. The other 1% would be that there is something seriously wrong that is making you miss all of your periods and have a growing belly. If you go to an OB/GYN by law, if you tell them not to release any of your info to your parent or anyone, they can't. My advice, this baby isn't going away and if your belly keeps growing, which it will, your mom will find out anyway. Go back to the OB/GYN, get checked out and then have a long talk with your mom. Believe me, she may be pretty mad at first, but then it will set in that there is no changing this and then she will more than likely be excited that she is having a grandchild. |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	That you probably need to get a blood test or at least go to the doctor because if you are that far along then you need to have everything checked out to make sure the baby is okay. No matter what your mom will find out your pregnant if you are.|`|UznAxq87aa	You better just tell your mom. She is going to find out anyways when you get really big. And you need to go to the dr and make sure thing are going well with your pregnancy. You need to start taking responsibility for your actions, you are about to become a mom!|`|PhGV5d2jaa	The nurse legally can't tell your mom unless your life is in danger. It's called patient confidentiality. So, if she does she's breaking the law.|`|AA10241709	I know you don't want to hear this, but you're most likely pregnant.  You need to start caring for you body and/or your baby's body now and go to the doctor and do the right thing.  Try going to the doc without your mom so you can be honest.<br>  <br>  In the long run, things will probably turn out great, you're just gonna have to get through this hard time right now.  <br>  I wish you well!|`|5t4PCSNuaa	I think it is time that you faced up to your responsibilities and sought the medical help available for both you and the baby.<br>  There are bllod tests that you should have had by now and scans etc<br>  Do the right thing and go to your GP and be HONEST!<br>  Good Luck
ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	If your period is due in a few days then you can go ahead and take an early detection pregnancy test. First Response is a good one. I will tell you though that it is possible to get tender breasts or nipples before you miss your period because I got that before I was due for my period. In fact it was a week before my period was suppose to come. Good luck and God Bless!|`|r8btmasFaa	I knew I was pregnant because my breast got  very full & i kept having stomach cramping after i ovulated so I had A feeling. GOOD LUCK!!!|`|6d75ad8cf0574b4b06e7c2f514178171aa	Tender breast is also a sign of AF. but to answer your question you could test now with an early detection test. Best don with AM urine. But be aware that it can still come back negative so its ideal to wait till the morning of your missed period. Good luck and lots of baby dust.|`|mhj4bEV0aa	i wasnt testing positive untill over a week after i was due, so if u do a test sooner bare that in mind u still could be if its negative! i felt very irritated in the week before i would have been due, and light headed! hope u get the result u want.
vue9NOhYaa	Statistically, pulling out is better than doing nothing at all, but it has a VERY high failure rate. So, if you don't care if you get pregnant, you could use it ... and risk about a one in four chance of being pregnant by the end of the year. (By contrast, if you do nothing at all, you have about an 80% chance of getting pregnant in one year.)<br>  <br>  But if you don't want to get pregnant, you need to use a birth control method with a lower than 25% failure rate.|`|cnMXJMFUaa	I welcomed home twins from that "method"|`|kogsyGAPaa	I've been using it for afew months and haven't gotten pregnant,<br>  and I think people are overrating this subject....as long as it's used correctly, it greatly reduces your chances...

450bf2070e40b0a5d51f854df94dc092aa	you still should have a good chance as sperm can live up to 5 days before it dies and a released egg can live up ti 36 hours so if you had sex today, this would also increase your chances. <br>  Good Luck|`|AA10792613	Be very very careful I have been through a similar thing with my wife and the constant pressure of having to have sex on cue ended up costing us our marriage, we where together 18 years,please relax enjoy each other and I am sure it will happen for both of you, good luck.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Well it is still possible if you had sex within 72 hours of you ovulating because the sperm can live inside you for about 72 hours. The chances aren't as high as if you have sex on the day you ovulate but it's still possible. Good luck!|`|3VzzXYrSaa	Very nice i hope you had lots of fun|`|efx53u13aa	my penis fell of yestaday|`|JusiwmMSaa	U CAN STILL GET PREGGO IF U DO IT TONIGHT AND EGG LAST 24 HOURS OR U COULD ALLREDY BE BREGGO IF U HAD SEX<br>  THE DAY BEFOR BECAUSE SPERM STAYS IN <br>  UR BODY FOR 2 DAYS<br>  GOOD LUCK|`|ezMoS0mqaa	you are still fertile 24 hours after ovulation.. still a chance. plus you may well have conceived anyway|`|b0ff0526fe90638f8e2ac0fea7c1171caa	Hey I ovulated yesterday too and I wasnt abe to BD yesterday either! Glad to know im not alone BUT we had sex the 5th and the 7th. I'm hoping the little swimmers were able to survive in there a couple days and something stuck! Just remember you dont have to be overly concered with doing it that exact days just make sure you do it ever other day leading up to the ovulation and that might work! <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck! |`|kogsyGAPaa	The minute you see him next, just on him!<br>  There may still be an open window and just don't know it<br>  I say if it's close to ovulation, still try, your chances are still greater at catching it<br>  :)|`|Z5GxEDi6aa	You still might be fine!<br>  <br>  Try not to get to worked up about it, or stressed as that won't help<br>  xxx|`|PnHcsa47aa	Just try again next month.
ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Sounds like you could be to me. Take a test and see. Good luck!|`|QFNvYVtyaa	After ovulation the egg travels into the uterus and burrows into the lining of the uterus. For some women implantation will cause slight bleeding or spotting. This is called implantation bleeding. This is sometimes confused for an early period. <br>  <br>  <br>  What does implantation bleeding or spotting look like?<br>  Implantation bleeding, also called implantation spotting, does not look like a regular menstrual period. Implantation bleeding is scanty and usually pink or brownish discharge. <br>  <br>  Implantation bleeding or menstrual period?<br>  Implantation bleeding normally occurs a week to a few days before your period would normally start. Spotting that occurs around a week after ovulation is likely implantation bleeding; whereas, spotting that occurs very close to the time that your period would normally start may not be. A normal menstrual cycle generally starts off light and then gets heavier. Spotting can sometimes be the sign of an early period. If this is the case, the spotting will pick up to heavier bleeding. If you have spotting right around the time your period would normally start, it can be more confusing. You will need to take the wait and see approach or take a pregnancy test to determine pregnancy.<br>  <br>  What if I feel like my period is about to start?<br>  If you have had spotting and think it might be implantation bleeding you may be paying very close attention to your body. If you are trying to get pregnant, the good news is that early pregnancy symptoms feel very similar to the start of your period. If you are pregnant you may begin to notice symptoms of early pregnancy right around the time your period would normally start and sometimes sooner than that. If you suspect pregnancy you can test for pregnancy as early as ten days after ovulation.<br>  <br>  How common is implantation bleeding? <br>  Implantation bleeding is fairly common with pregnancy. Twenty to thirty percent of women will have spotting during early pregnancy. If you have some light spotting before your period would normally start this is not something to worry about and may be a sign of pregnancy.|`|OCk7I8JVaa	a pregnancy test would probably still show positive but early pregnancy bleeding is usually not a good sign.
x0j1XUIEaa	I'm a in my 13th week and still tired and nauseous... I have headaches ALL the time and it seems to get worse in the evening.  I had my first u/s yesterday and I'm happy that the baby is jumping all around and punching and kicking in there.  I have a 21 month old daughter and I was fine with her, a little tired in the beginning but nothing too bad.  This pregnancy, however, has kicked my butt!!!  I hope it gets better.  I have not started to show at all yet, but my u/s showed the baby was the right size and a good heartbeat.  Pregnancy is a blessing, but can be difficult at times.  Just stay positive and think you're almost half way there!!!  It gets difficult sometimes, but in the end you will have a beautiful little baby!!!  It's worth the headaches, aches, pains and everything else we go through!!! Good luck and hope both of us start feeling better!!|`|0fe4f3702c5dd1a403524194d3e9fabdaa	I am 18 weeks & feeling great!

It's not as bad as it was in the first trimester yet but I know that once I get into my third trimester it is suppose to get worse again. :( I get horrible headaches but they have started getting better. Other than the headaches and occasional back or leg pain I'm feeling fine. My baby is kicking like crazy and moving around so that makes me feel great and makes all the bad stuff worth it. I just can't wait to meet her. I'm so freaking excited. YAY!

fEtgLkBxaa	it depenede to anything!<br>  share this with your doctor!|`|vue9NOhYaa	Yes, it is normal for it to take a while.  On average, about 50% of couples who are actively trying will be pregnant within 3-4 months.  So you're completely normal.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Three months may seem like a long time to you,but,I have heard of woman trying for three or more years before conceiving. You're just putting way to much pressure on both of yourselves to get pregnant right away.  And that stress will hinder conception. Just relax. You will get pregnant!|`|dd1c8373d258bab9181f891f88ea8dafaa	Even young healthy fertile couples on average take 8-10 months to get pregnant.<br>  <br>  you're only fertile for 24-36 hours out of each cycle. thats it. there has to be healthy viable sperm in your system at that time or it just wont happen. That sounds easy enough, but even if all that is there at the right time theres only about an 80% chance that the dna ni both egg and sperm are viable and if so that the egg will implant and a pregnancy will take hold. Thats NORMAL in EVERY couple. Those are the normal every day variables of copulation.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you want to get pregnant, stop trying. just have sex and focus on love and life. you'll be there before you know it.|`|9bUN1AHFaa	It can take the average couple up to 1 year to conceive, and each month you only have a 20-26% chance of conceiving.  Your only on your 3rd month, hang in there.  I know how stressful and disappointing it can be, my son was conceived in 2 months and we are ttc#2 and its been 2 years.  So you never know what you will get handed.  Track your ovulation and be sure you are doing it from 5 days before and up to one day after O.  Remember you are still young so you have lots of time!  Good Luck,|`|Ed7qNFdzaa	your not supposed to worry for 6 - 12 months. the timing may not be right for you. your dh may have the problem, not you.<br>  <br>  its pretty soon to assume *your* infertile.<br>  <br>  i would stop worrying about and just be 18....<br>  <br>  omg! 18 and wanting a baby! ok, to each their own. good luck!|`|K5uoaetaaa	Yes.  Three months is no time at all.  Try to stop trying, and you may find it just happens!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I went through the same thing when I was 18 and I didn't get pregnant until right before I turned 21. Nothing was wrong with me or my husband I guess God just didn't feel like it was the right time for us. I'm sure you are both fine. They say to not start worrying until after a year of trying. You've only been trying for 3 months and that isn't bad. If you really want to up your chances I would recommend a clear blue easy fertility monitor because after trying for 2 1/2 years to conceive we bought one of them and got pregnant on the first try. Good luck to you and baby dust!|`|ID2AH1EBaa	Yes you could be, he could also be impotent, or you could just plain not be doing things right. <br>  <br>  In my opinion though you are way too young to be 1. married and 2. trying to conceive. I'm not your parent, friend, or old enough to try to lecture you, but you know i am right deep down.|`|0376be3c8ed37461747c054a3f56a9f6aa	Sometimes it takes a while.  Timing is key.  You need to try when you are ovulating.  Feritility, however, often has nothing to do with age, so if you continue to have problems, you and our husband should see your doctors.|`|h4sYqZgPaa	People can be born infertile. It seems when people aren't looking for kids they get prego easily but when you actually TRY it never happens! Just be patient and enjoy trying lol if you still not prego in 6 month maybe you should consult a doctor.|`|KCvrB08Caa	me and my fience have been ttc for 2 years, so if it happens soon for u, u are lucky! the doctor said everything is fine, we are just not hitting it on the right time don't worry!|`|VFUdAtrHaa	It usually takes a year or more to concieve maybe you should stop trying cuz it seems like it happens more when it unplanned|`|D9SwIYrRaa	If you aren't fertile try IVF (InvetroFertilization treatments)|`|2PmoDOwoaa	No, its normal check for an ovulation calender online and see when ur most fertile.|`|HArDflVEaa	depennns
ebM6CxRQaa	Yes it is normal. First the back aches can come and go. (They do tend to be worse at the end of the pregnancy because of all the added weight) <br>  <br>  Cramping is normal as long as it is not extreme pain followed by blood/blood clots. The cramping is just your uterus growing, and your body getting ready and going through changes. Migraines.... they are the worst... take Tylenol... that is all you can take. For me it helped sometimes and other times the headaches would not go away! Just the added hormones (again!) Discharge... well get used to that because the further along you get the more there will be. Towards the middle/end you may even want to wear a light pad (the discharge can get to be so much you feel like you tinkle your self)<br>  <br>  GL and congrats on the baby. I am so happy you chose life :)|`|vGHaYp6Naa	well to make you feel TONS better..lol..the backaches dont get better....and ive been havin some horrible migraines for the last week....so im not sure bout that one. just go to a doctor|`|tivpa7Vlaa	and your name is steve??? if u r serious then everything sounds normal to me. just get some rest, take your prenatals and eat properly. when it comes to being pregnant i dont know what normal is because everyone body reacts different. any thing u really not sure just take it up on your doctor visits|`|WbJPQM1naa	You might improve your diet and eat more healthy foods.  Drink more water too.  You may be having headaches because your blood sugar is not properly fed, with good protein rich food!  Water and lots of water. Everytime you have anything with caffeine, like soda, coffee or tea, drink a big glass of water as a chaser!  This will help you feel better and more energtic.<br>  <br>  Now, about the crampy pains... and those cramps in your side.. I know you're probably getting them.  I used to HATE those things!  I would roll over in bed and have one, where my side got the sharp, stabbing pain!  OH man, time to practice labor breathing and relaxation there!  Anyway, the reason that these happen is this:<br>  <br>  My doctor explained it like this:  The unpregnant uterus is usually about the size of a pear fruit.  It is supported by two ligaments that suspend it in your abdomen.  Picture a grapefruit being strung up with two strings of yarn.  These ligaments have contractions too as the uterus is growing bigger and stretching for your baby.  That is the pain you feel, which is like a really bad period cramp.  <br>  <br>  It is common to have a bit more discharge during pregnancy too.  But, if you have anything that looks like cottage cheese and any pain when you go pee or itching, you need to get checked, because this are symptoms of vaginal infection and or urinary tract infection, and these can be more common in pregnancy.  Just shower daily and don't use douches or any other feminine cleaning products.  Sometimes these products have chemical cleaners which actually strip away natural ways your body protects you from infection.  If the discharge is uncomfortable for you, you can always wear those small, light days pads. <br>  <br>  Remember to take your prenatals, get plenty of rest and good, regular meals, and drink 8-10 full glasses of water daily! You will survive and your baby will be awesome!  You can do this!<br>  <br>  Much love,<br>  R|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Completely normal. Congratulations!|`|7QjlDvs6aa	very normal congrates|`|tIPs2eI2aa	the cramping isn't really normal but it maybe that your body is trying to reject the baby or just that your body is getting ready for the baby.. But the migrains and the discharge is normal.. I would only worry if you start bleeding or have pain where you can't stand it or it's as bad as mestrual cramps.. But other than that it sounds like your fine. With you being pregnant, always call a doc or a hotline just to make sure.. But good luck and congrats|`|vzYZWiPyaa	hey im a soon to be teen mommy too =)<br>  congrats on your little one<br>  <br>  & from the looks of things, everything sounds pretty<br>  normal to me. i use to have the same problems..<br>  now all i suffer with is mood swings and fatigue.<br>  lol, but i think you're good to go. just be sure<br>  to take your prenatal vitamins and keep up with<br>  all your appointments. ask your ob if you have any further<br>  questions about things. good luck with your pregnancy.|`|8jnATlpaaa	im 8 weeks and a teen too lol im not that experienced but it sounds pretty normal to me loll cuz i have the same things and even worse loll so yea best thing, dont worry and smile alot and if you are worried go on the internet and research the best is always your doc but i did so much research (for hours and hours lol)  to ease my mind and it worked :)|`|GlKq5stKaa	Its normal. the back aches will go away soon and so will the cramps. congratulations :)|`|mFQydvncaa	all normal, make sure you get on vitamins and go to your ob doctor!|`|7TYuCafDaa	Your name is steve? Go pull your pud and stop putting dumb questions up
oaF2kaXAaa	That sucks. I was able to get off meds before pregnancy. My body made its own drugs!! But then right afterward the PPD kicked in and I had to go back on for a few months... I cant answer your question. Personally, if I were in your situation, I would try to detox myself and go without... I do understand the whole chemical imbalance thing, but after being on the meds for so long?? I would try to find a substitute natural med... like chocolate.. lol. Ok. bad answer. Best of luck to you!|`|aLAmvX5Naa	Do not change your dose or do anything without speaking to your doctor.|`|ehBPus3Zaa	I was on Trazadone when I found out I was 3 weeks pregnant! The doctor made me quit cold turkey! They said it could hurt the baby if I had stayed on it. And the only other thing I had to take was my thyroid medicine. But ask your doctor, he is the only one that can tell you what you should take or not take.|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	You should be consulting with both your OB/GYN and a psychiatrist to determine what medication and at what dose is safe. What works for other people might not work for you, so don't go by what other people say - go with the professionals' opinions.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	This is something you will have to ask your doctor.

I would suggest none unless your doctor tells you too. When we studied pregnancy we learned that theres really not much medication you can take while pregnant and thats one that was on the No list. Although since not being on it has a side effect i would suggest talking to your doctor about it and see what they say. Good Luck with Everything.<br>  --Also my sister in law was on atidepressants before she got preg. and the doctor told her absoultely not.|`|9JUdyGdaaa	ask the dr only!!! Not people on the net. This is your babys life we are talking about here!
bAp35x7uaa	Your uterus is stretching to make way for the little one.  You'll get all sorts of weird stretching, cramping and shooting pains - some  either side, some on the inside but so long as they're not accompanied by blood, it's all perfectly normal.<br>  <br>  I've had exactly the same thing since 6 weeks and apparently it doesn't stop!  <br>  <br>  xxx|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	No cramping and slight pain is completely normal in pregnancy. It's when it's accompanied by blood that you need to worry. Good luck and Congrats!
miPubuDYaa	Yes, You can get bleeding that looks like a period while pregnant. You should go out and take a pregnancy test. If it comes out positive youre pregnant. If it comes out negative and you still feel pregnant wait another 2 weeks test again. Or schedule an appointment with your docotr<br>  <br>  I had one normal period when i was 4 weeks pregnant and spotting when i was 7.5 weeks pregnant. My doctor said it could have been "old" blood left over from my last period.|`|Jn7bt3JTaa	I knew a woman who didn't know she was pregnant until she was 6 mos in becase she kept getting her period and carried the baby in a way that just made her believe she had gained a few pounds.

4D1VEKW5aa	I am alot hornier now, but i dont think that sex feels any better than it did before. Its different for everybody.|`|1WRB7RPNaa	im six weeks and feel so car sickish that i dont want to have sex and i feel real bad b/c when ttc, i wanted it all the time|`|mc6YtaRbaa	For some people it is true, but that's not the case with everyone.|`|bKG3M1Adaa	It is for me :)  I could see it being an issue though if you're pregnant with multiples, because it would be kinda hard if you were REALLY big. Anyways, being pregnant has definitely increased my libido, and my husband is definitely not complaining haha.|`|3paE1E9Xaa	I guess everyone is different but during my pregnancy my hubby and I enjoyed sex a lot more especially him!! We had sex thru out my whole pregnacy|`|Fy9S6hjIaa	NO NO NO NO NO.  Absolutly and completely a myth (at least for me).  The first part of pregnancy I was too sick for sex, the rest I was to big for sex.|`|FIvA9OVxaa	my girlfriend siad it was and she never has multi orgasms and she alwas did|`|wQucJZRCaa	I wish! ~~ Its different for every woman. ~~<br>  <br>  A large portion of woman loose their sex drive when they are pregnant while other woman have raging hormones. It all depends on the person. Many ladies say they are too sick, too tired, feel too fat, feel unsexy and just don't have any sex drive whatsoever. That's me, all of the above! I feel bad for my hubby!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I think it depends on the person. I know that for me it isn't. My main thing is that you constantly feel like you have to pee even if I don't. If it weren't for that it would be fine but I wouldn't say it is better.|`|6Nu7VfCuaa	It depends on how your feeling but all of my friends that have been pregnant and had sex during that said that it was A LOT better|`|jsdDgIuRaa	No|`|y3vozJ8Aaa	mine is!! haha.. im 37 weeks and i just texted my hubby about when are we gonna have sex again. he is in class. haha
diT2WFfCaa	It is very young, but many people have had children at that age.<br>  <br>  Talk to your mother.  Don't panic if she is upset at first, it's understandable that she would be angry/upset/worried.  If you are pregnant, you are going to want the support of your family, and chances are, once they get over the initial reaction, they will want to help you any way they can.  It's much better for them to know now than to be told only because you can't hide it any more.<br>  <br>  It's a little too late for this now, but if you aren't ready for a baby, sex should be out of the question.  Even though they are highly effective, birth control and contraception have been known to fail.<br>  <br>  Best of luck, sweetie, I hope things work out for you and your baby.|`|e1f14553031ea73247b5b1290c459513aa	It is scary telling your parent. I remember telling mine but I was older (22). Regardless, you shouldn't try to go through this alone. Don't hide it either for the sake of your health and the baby's health. You should be followed by a doctor whether you decide to keep the baby or not. <br>  <br>  It's a very emotional time, not to mention dealing with the changes in pregnancy. There are resources in your community that can also be of help to you. If you don't know where to begin, call 211 which is a community information resource number that should be able to give a good start in looking for programs to help you. 211 is sponsored by the United Way.<br>  <br>  Your parents may flip initially but hold on. Give them time to adjust. Go ahead and make the call to 211. You might also want to ask about agencies that counsel young ladies who are pregnant.<br>  <br>  You can do it! Hang in there! :)|`|afeNK6oSaa	You can get pregnant...so that means it's not too young to have a baby, even if it's not the ideal time.<br>  <br>   I would seek advice support and help from experienced moms, though- and TAKE their advises for heavens sake!!  <br>  <br>  It's a little rough the first child anyways- what ever age you are, to get the hang of it... But you will be fine.  I pray allot.  try that :)|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Well if you're already pregnant then it doesn't matter how old you are. It's always better to wait until you are married and can financially take care of your child but there have been 15 yr olds that have done it. If you're pregnant and are scared to tell your parents then write it in a letter. No matter what you do they're eventually going to find out anyway and it's always better to do it sooner then later. Plus, they can get you to a doctor to make sure that the baby is alright. Good luck!|`|vygYFdsSaa	15 is very young to have a baby. I wouldn't recommend it but it happens. If you're pregnant and planning to keep the baby you must tell your family NOW so you can start getting proper care. Even if you don't want to keep it, you need to see a doctor to discuss your other options and make sure you are healthy.|`|POGZZmoUaa	Yes, 15 is too young to care for a baby but not too young to carry a child full term to birth.  You need to tell someone you trust because you and the baby will need care.  You need vitamins and a good diet and some encouragement to understand how to start the process toward adoption, as well as what to expect during the nine months until the birth.  Good Luck!|`|fUK9y3Qkaa	Yes it is too young! I know girl have gotten pregnant younger but it's still not ok! You should be more focused on school and being a child/teenager! If you are indeed pregnant please dont hesitate to tell your parents so they can get you to a doctor ASAP! Wait til it's nice and calm in the house and their in a good mood then tell them. But dont wait to long it's only going to make them madder.

mc6YtaRbaa	Yes, a positive pregnancy tests means you are pregnant. Your LMP was 1/3 and if you were on a 28 day cycle, then you conceived around 1/17 and are due around 10/10. You are 7 weeks and 5 days pregnant.|`|96HWpdkFaa	Your pregnant.<br>  Probably 8 weeks.<br>  <br>  =) Go to the doctor!!!|`|AA10628838	After three positive pregnancy tests, you still have to ask? Yes you are 8 weeks pregnant.|`|cf5961a316debfb7203fffd630bd740caa	you're pregnant dear. if you plan on keeping this pregnancy, you need to seek prenatal care. if you don't plan on keeping this pregnancy, you need to go to your local clinic and be quick about it. good luck with whatever choice you make regarding this pregnancy.|`|hDnX6Vx6aa	Pregnant FOR SURE. A positive is a positive. You are almost 8 weeks. Go see your doctor for a blood test to confirm. Goo luck to you.|`|yFDHSzXCaa	you are prob. around 1-2 months pregnant. last time u had sex before ur period never came is the time ui got preg.|`|mgiJVjaKaa	Yes, if the pregnancy test was positive - you are pregnant.<br>  <br>  You are likely about 7 weeks along. <br>  <br>  Make an appointment with your doctor so you can make sure you're healthy and taking care of yourself (and take vitamins!)<br>  <br>  Also start reaching out to your support network if you're only 17. You'd be surprised how many families are supportive, even if they're initially shocked, angry, etc.|`|n8Db77zbaa	It doesn't matter how daint or dark the lines are, if they are there, you are. Since you've confirmed it with home test a few times already its time you go to your OB-GYN. My calculations say that you're probably about 3-5 weeks.|`|4aYNKp2Xaa	If you are pregnant, and it sounds as if you are after two positive pregnancy tests, then you will be 8 weeks pregnant this weekend.  <br>  <br>  Best of luck to you, sweetie.|`|GBSO1Efraa	go to the damn doctor instead of asking yahoo answers for medical help.  That is the safe way because you need a doctor present to know if you are and plus people on here could say there a nurse or doctor and really they are not.|`|eytlIKITaa	Yes, you're pregnant- go to the doctors.|`|AA10196172	If the test says positive, you are positively pregnant.<br>  <br>  The doctors count from the beginning of your last beriod (Jan 3) so you are 7 weeks 5 days along. They count 4 weeks as a month, so that would be 1 month, 3 weeks 5 days. <br>  <br>  Doctors like this method because you don't have to figure in which months have 31, 30, or 28 days. It's precise enough to say "at this point this should happen". A pregnancy is 280 days or 40 weeks.<br>  <br>  For the rest of us, we count months on our fingers from the approximate date of conception. It's about 9 calendar months from the approximate date of conception to birth.<br>  <br>  Conception likely happens about the 14th or 15th day after your period.|`|AA11659150	There is no such thing as a false positive.  No matter how faint that line is, if you see it, it's positive.  You are pregnant and you need to call your doctor ASAP for an appt.  She can tell you for sure how far along you are (using a blood test and an ultrasound scan - really cool to see btw), but just as a guess, I'd bet you are around 8 wks at this point.  You may already be noticing early pregnancy symptoms as well such as increased trips to tee tee, bloating and crampiness, exhaustion, nausea and possibly vomiting, and breast soreness.  GL and I hope you aren't disappointed.  I gather it wasn't planned, but wish you all the best.<br>  <br>  BTW - that means you probably concieved sometime between the 15th and the 19th.|`|buoqtZeFaa	Yes with three positive test I would say that you are pregnant.  Since you had a period in Jan I would say you are around 6-7 weeks. I would suggest you make a DR. appointment<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|tcHkn0VIaa	you are 7 weeks and 5 days pregnant it is based off of the first day of your last period and you probably conceived the baby the weekend of the 17th. you need to go to the dr and have them verify the results and start prenatal care and vitamins daily- they are very important to the little one inside of you that already has a heartbeat thought you may not be able to hear it with a Doppler at the dr for another few weeks. You may start experiencing some morning sickness around this stage.|`|3w7VztEWaa	sounds like me. my last period started on october 5 and ended on the12 which was a very abnoramlly long period for me and me and my boyfriend only had sex on weekends..so Im guessing i got pregnant on that weekend...i waited over a month and took two test both said positive.<br>  <br>  so ya know im 20 weeks haha<br>  <br>  your probably around 8 weeks.|`|ESAM0U7xaa	<a href="http://www.justmommies.com/get-duedate.php?month=1&day=3&year=2009&cycle=28&luteal=14&due=calculate+from+last+menstrual+period" rel="nofollow">http://www.justmommies.com/get-duedate.p...</a><br>  <br>  if you are pregnant, it would likely be from mid Jan. that would put you about 8 weeks. please go see a doctor. u need to make sure you are healthy and everything is ok. i'm sure you weren't trying since you're only 17, but it'll be ok! take care of yourself and possibly the baby growing in you <3<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|sOO93u5Oaa	Yes, I'd say you're pregnant. If you go to a doctor, they can tell you how far along you are. They will probably count from 8-10 days after conception as the first week.<br>  <br>  <br>  Example:<br>  If you had sex on April 1st and became pregnant, they would count week 1 as anywhere between April 9-11th.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	You would be due on October 10th and you're  7 weeks and 4 days pregnant. If you had that many positive tests then you are PREGNANT! Now make an appointment with your doctor so that you can make sure everything is fine and your baby is healthy. Good luck!|`|Oq2B7I4faa	You are pregnant  As you said all of your three test came out positive.

Good Luck!!|`|7KkTel7Oaa	if ANY lines came back on the preg test, that's a yes. End of story. No false positives with pee lines.

Dont lift heavy things, if you exercise you can continue to exercise if your doctor says its okay. Dont eat tuna, only once a week. No raw meet or raw eggs. Only eat cold cut meats once in a while. Andd... thats all I can think of right now. =D|`|hAXJ47iAaa	Your pregnant.<br>  Get to a doctor for prenatal care.  They count the beginning of your pregnancy from your LMP (last menstrual period)...<br>  Your about 6-7 weeks or so
Ccq8zEcnaa	It is good to take a break and get out and move around. When you travel, you are usually awake and it's much more exhausting, mentally and physically.|`|S4DNQkFraa	You may want to walk in around a little bit to keep your ankles from swelling. Or, just keep an eye on your ankles and if they do begin to swell, then get out and walk around. G/L!!|`|sRy2SKpXaa	I'm going to tell you right now, that's b.s. You don't have to stop every hour. I took a car trip from Pennsylvania to Texas (El Paso, all the way on the west side of Texas) and did not stop every hour, if I did that, I never would have made it home!! It was a 32 hour car ride, and we stopped to get gas, food, and go to the bathroom, and stretch a few times. And I was 21-22 weeks when I took this trip. It's not necessary to stop that often, but do make sure you stop once in a while to stretch your legs and walk around. And make sure you stay hydrated. Good luck.|`|e90a8e2ee095e648a3f92f15f7959eb6aa	I say stop about once in the middle.  Go into a convenience store, use the restroom, or something and you'll be good.  Really, as long as you move around every couple of hours you'll be fine.<br>  <br>  I think it's different from sleeping because then your feet/legs are equal level to your head so your circulation will be better.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I was told that you should stop like every hour or two to get out and walk around. When I was like two months pregnant I drove on a 3 day trip and the doctor told me that you need to get out and walk a lot.|`|h93SVSxLaa	my drs rule of thumb was always  this... if you get uncomfortable during the ride stop and get out for a little.keep hydrated and use the restroom when you do stop. if you don't feel like stopping every hour... than don't|`|a008b4fbab08844b65bd4e0cea6d00fdaa	What I would do in your situation is to attempt the trip and see how I feel.  However I learned the hard way that pregnancy is time when your entire system is a bit more sensitive.  So give yourself time to rest and walk around in case you need it.  Be extra cautious, when you are going on your road trip, and if you feel like you need to take a break take it.  It is also good to mention that sometimes it takes time for our mind to be aware on how you body is feeling.|`|tYhu6yD4aa	i didn't listen to my dr when he told me to get out and walk around for a 2 and half hour ride and when we got to where we were going i thought i was have a miscarriage cause my body had craps like i was went to the hospital they told me a UTI cause i rode to long n the car with moving my body didn't feel that i need to go pee after that i would stop and go pee evry hour i was on a car ride i would just get out a moved if a dr told you to do so it good for you to do it|`|0f9203abf664214ebc6d4a6e58a82307aa	It's only 3 hours. And you're in the early stages of pregnancy. I personally don't think it's necessary to get out and all that.|`|QxJ4tuUCaa	I would just to be safe.
3K7ffKn2aa	i went a size up but my doc later said i should have gotten the same size as before pregnancy. The ones my size seemed to be to tight so i went up and this size is to lose. she told me that they are supposed to fit tight for some reason and she made the first mistake with her first baby also. But i personally would rather have a bigger size than something i have to squeeze into. just go and try stuff on and see what you like the best.|`|m0DgqEcjaa	all of my maternity clothes have been the same size as before i was pregnant except with elasticated waist or  room for my bump.<br>  <br>  however, clothes that i have brought that are not specifically maternity clothes are 2 sizes bigger (i can't buy trousers unless they are maternity trousers) but bigger tops fit.|`|79eRDIbXaa	If they are Maternity clothes then you are to pick the same size as you were before. However if you see something you like in normal size, go for next size up or even the one after that depending on how far along you are. Good Luck XXx<br>  EG IM Size 10 so all my Maternity clothes are size 10 also.|`|vGHaYp6Naa	well for my bottom half, i had to get a size bigger in the beginning, now  ive lost weight so im back to my regular hip size.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	I just tried stuff on and got what was comfortable...I usually only got clothes twice during pregnancy....beginning of 2nd trimester and beginning of 3rd if I needed a new pair of pants.|`|iHC5mSLEaa	well if you got the same size they would be close fitting like your normal size is (except bigger obviously bcos its maternity) so if you want best comfort i'd go for a size bigger.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	I always got the same size of maternity clothes that I was in pre-pregnancy.<br>  <br>  It depends on how big your belly gets and how much weight you gain if they will fit all through pregnancy.|`|AA10478146	Go try some clothes and buy what fits.  Usually you'll buy the same size your bought pre-pregnancy.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I would just go to the store and try them on and see before you purchase them.|`|98WKYtfwaa	Try them on, it's the only way to find out if there comfortable on you, or not.|`|ioZeveazaa	Buy a size larger because you will grow into them quickly!! I wore a size 7 jean prepregnancy and started in a size small mat pants. Well two weeks later I couldn't fit them anymore and had to buy a size medium and within about a month or two of that, I was in a large. You will be surprised how fast your belly will grow. Good luck!|`|QMxEjCpiaa	I actually went and tried on the pants before purchasing them. I like the Duo jeans from JCPenny because they look similar to what I normally would wear. Try on the clothes before purchasing them.

PHOyKsmPaa	Take your son around and Introduce yourself to your neighbors, especially ones with children your son's age. Then organize a small get together at your house with kids included.  Could be a Get to know the neighbors luncheon.  Set up the video games, basket ball, or yard games for the kids.  Once he starts to get to know them he will be less hesitant. <br>  <br>  Does he go to the neighborhood school?  Walking him to his bus stop and talking to other parents and kids is a great way to make friends.  Sometimes kids need help starting conversations, so You could say, "hey , Billy, I  see you are wearing a baseball shirt, My son loves baseball too, right?

Most of them are treatable, unless there is a basic problem you haven't mentioned (Spina Bifida, brain injury, etc.).<br>  <br>  A child who is incontinent past the age of seven, with or without physiological condition, should be having therapy or at least counseling.<br>  <br>  I think there is much you are not saying.|`|CxCigxZIaa	I must ask if this is a MEDICAL condition first of all. IF so then by all means he can NOT help it. However..if this isn't a MEDICAL condition then YOU (yes you Mom) need to wake him every 2 hours and have him go potty. You might have to prop him up to go but do it. It will get him into a routine of going to the potty. Also NO liquids 2 hours before bedtime. <br>  Final note: that is how you can help him. IF it's medical, then by all means contact his Dr. to see what can be done to fix this. <br>  I realize that he's embarrassed and who wouldn't be? <br>  Suggestion: have you tried using PULL UPS? (like real undies instead of diapers) this is only used in case of medical issues however. <br>  I sincerely wish you both the best with this issue.

A lot of girls are placed on birth control pills to regulate their cycle and they are still intact.|`|tQPvv0Glaa	It depends on what type of birth control you are taking about.  Some methods, like an IUD, can only be used by women who have already had a baby.  If you mean, the pill - then no, you don't have to have sex before you can get on the pill.  Talk to your doctor or go to a clinic like Planned Parenthood.|`|nISYAHkfaa	No, some people go on birth control to help with the effects of endometriosis, some to control acne, some just to have a regular period or no period . . . you don't have to be sexually active to go on birth control.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	depends on what type you want. most of them no, not with the shot, pill, or ring. with things like uid's they suggest waiting until you have a child but thats all i've heard of.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	No, you can be put on birth control and never sleep with anyone.|`|Y4s4Om38aa	Nope....many people go on birth control years before they have sex just for the fact that it helps with things caused by the hormone fluxuations of the menstural cycle.....acne, heavy periods, irregular periods, severe cramps, moodyness|`|b4275d058c5758208dc84bc8c33b4509aa	it is as true as jumping up and down after sex or you won't get pregnant the first time you have sex,NO,get the pill before getting active ,you will save the need for an unwanted pregnancy or an abortion.|`|dVAiuqZCaa	No,someone must have told you that trying to get in your pants.You just go to the doctor and have a paps test done and they'll talk to you about the dangers of sex and give you a prescription.|`|c5AJGcYcaa	no, you don't have to be sexually active in order to be on birth control. Many girls who has no intention of having sex are put on it to help with PMS symptoms.|`|AXEqOEloaa	Where in the world did you get this idea?  The point of BC is to use it BEFORE you have sex.|`|XzbRZCPUaa	no
hl5WdXnbaa	It is kinda funny, I speak my mind all the time and can be harsh but I do not many   any  negative comments UNTIL I make remarks against "JOn and Kate plus 8"  then my in box lights up like a Christmas tree. One woman actually wished me to get "butt cancer"  and another wished my kids dead because I made a comment comparing Kate to Octomom. And * I* am the weird one? I guess wishing children harm is a lot nicer then making a comment about a family on tv that they do not know personally.|`|ANHsv4ENaa	Rotflmao!!! Desmeran, I am a bleeding heart liberal, I always put you closer to the conservative side. Maybe that's just because you are balanced and reasonable. Most people people who fall into the liberal category are not. Neither are the conservatives for that matter. Lol. I know why my answers rub people wrong. I'm convinced I'm right. Yep, I said it. I have no problem telling you what I think is best for YOU not just for me. I find it morally wrong to let a baby cio or to circumcise. I think vaccines are dangerous for everyone not just my baby. I think breast feeding should only be given up after a TON of effort. I make no apologies, I think I am right after all. I won't harass people who do those things but if I answer a question regarding them I sure will give my reasons in no uncertain terms. I think we all need to rub each other wrong from time to time. It keeps us aware that other people have other views and sometimes we even learn something.|`|hKJIDdVqaa	just about everything. from religion, to my blessed children who get everything they want under the sun, to my kids getting excellent grades which they do not have to try for, because I am blunt and loud.  I am lax on corporal type punishment and prefer "talks" and the "eye".  I get up and wait on my kids when they want a sandwich etc, because I enjoy it.  Because my kids are extremely well behaved and polite smart and athletic and they were just born that way.  Because I teach my children that laborious job are for the less intelligent.|`|j2mRop0laa	I get thumbs down and told off and emailed for giving my kids cell phones and such and not expecting them to pay for it. It's just a phone to me.<br>  <br>  I wasn't comfortable breast feeding by breast and pumped the milk and alternated with formula. Someone let me know I was a freak for that. How nice.<br>  <br>  I baby my girls and over comfort them. Still carry my 6 year old on my hip and someone said that was "overboard." <br>  <br>  I let them keep their binky's till they were 4 and they fell asleep with bottle with water till they were 4. People think I'm just awful for that. Whatever.<br>  <br>  I would love to sit my kids by theirs and then we could really have a competition.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	i'm okay w/most.  i just dont apperciate being insulted.  i don't insult.  i would like the same courtesy  i also dont apperciate when i'm asking a question people telling my there is something seriously wrong w/my child.  i didn't ask for critiques on my children i asked what would you do.  those things rub me the wrong way.<br>  well my daughter is too sensitive and she needs help for it, i am going to have hellions because of how i raise them., they are going to be fat cows cuz we eat mcdonalds when the mood strikes me.  viola there you go.|`|G9ywiLqvaa	hmm...i'm usually dubbed a 'bad parent' because i'm a working mom aaaand because i don't always believe my sons have ADHD.<br>  <br>  oh and i've been called a 'liar' for my what-if question (duh!).  lol!<br>  <br>  EDIT:  and i've been totally barked at for using autism and adhd in one sentence.  it's not like i'm comparing them or anything.  but this mom just got insane and called me 'stupid' for that.  it hurts, dude.  haha!|`|397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	well according to some answerers, my daughter will be breastfeeding and co-sleeping until she gets married. she will also be obese because i let her have pizza and fries sometimes. she will also be an unruly brat because I don't hit her|`|Kl1h5dCaaa	I see my name, you have my attention. How will you be trolling me today?><br>  <br>  Why don't people like me....WELL<br>  - I am rude<br>  - I don't care what they think<br>  - I am loyal<br>  - I am rarely serious<br>  - I troll<br>  - Pregnant people usually hate me, because I HAVE HUMOUR (love my 2 TC Pregnancy haters)<br>  - I speak the truth.<br>  <br>  Ok about the whole truth thing. I answered a question, and I was serious, and I was right. It was in a field I happen to know a little about, since I dedicated most of my life to doing. I received something like 14 thumbs down. Why, because it was the truth and people are too damn blind to see it.<br>  BLAH I don't care. I have contacts and friends here, who I know love me just the way I am|`|AA11920812	What do I do the wrong way?<br>  <br>  I don`t listen to the way everyone tells me to do things.<br>  <br>  This pi$$es people off to no end. I do what is right by my kids. Not some quack here. I didn`t breastfeed for years on end. Even whilst breast feeding I gave formula so I could have a break. Yes, I am selfish.<br>  <br>  I sometimes spank. I don`t pamper my children. They cry. Sometimes a lot.<br>  <br>  My three year old sleeps with me and my hubby. And, no it didn`t interfer with our intimacy, notice I am pregnant again. And, will co sleep with this one if he or she desires but definately while breastfeeding its easier that way at night. My youngest loves his own bed. Never liked sleeping with us. So be it.<br>  <br>  Both kids still have binkies.<br>  <br>  We go to McDonalds.<br>  <br>  I hate cooking. But I do it.<br>  <br>  Anything else? I`m sure someone will think of more!|`|ZadTQtJaaa	Well, I can't breast feed my son anymore and he has to have special formula so I was asking questions last night about formula, since then the breast feeding nazi's have been sending me lovely messages... guess that rubbed them the wrong way.  Hey at least I'm feeding my child and not letting him starve....|`|sBHhnDwaaa	*QUACK QUACK* Let it roll off like a duck and water on its back lol.<br>  <br>  I just ignore the rude and go on to the positive. I have enough negativity in my "real" life, thank you very much!!<br>  <br>  I don't care if I rub people the wrong way... I give my answer/opinion and well, that's how I feel, so get over it!!|`|rpsXPdFmaa	Not breastfeeding my son.  Not doing the Easter Bunny or Santa things.  I encouraged my daughter to get in bed with us whenever scared, cold, or she just wanted us.  <br>  <br>  I'm curious though.  Seriously, smelly feet?|`|fdnbXfvfaa	I actually don't know. I am not sure if I do. I won't say I don't cause I honestly don't know. It would be interesting to know what people thought<br>  hmm|`|prqrQcd1aa	I"m not too shure honestly! I've had plenty of violations in the past week, over nothing honestly! But no one will come out and say why they don't like me! Must not matter too much then, i would suppose!|`|um29wkUPaa	Now this will come as a huge surprise, but... well... I have been known to be somewhat outspoken.|`|AA12145826	Oh that's easy, its because I'm a dirt-worshiping, tree-hugging, bra-burning, formula feeding, addiction-enabling (because I let my daughter watch the Wiggles when she was little while I was getting ready for work, no joke!), co-sleeping, sex-having (though, not while co-sleeping with my daughter....obviously!), working mom, humor-loving, sarcastic, Yankee (courtesy of my redneck BIL), liberal B*tch. And I'm okay with that.|`|3WWHWsHOaa	Where do I begin?<br>  <br>  People hate me because i don't have to work.<br>  Because I am all for charity and welfare for those who need it.<br>  Because I don't fight politics and I don't fight religious battles.<br>  Because I refuse to take sides on breast vs bottle, spanking versus non, single mom vs married, working mom vs sah.<br>  Because I am able to donate money and time to issues I care about<br>  Because I am arrogant<br>  Because I don't care if someone thinks I am a *****<br>  Because i don't like whiners<br>  Because I have a snarky attitude and sense of humor<br>  because I wont bow down and agree with everyone<br>  <br>  Thats about all i can see from my numerous hate mails.<br>  <br>  Oh yeah and because I know how to spell.|`|0d8fd99482e78511337c03d547560306aa	Hummm. I guess I am either not famous like the rest of you or just plain not crappy enough to people. <br>  <br>  Actually, I think I just plain don't give a damn if I rub someone the wrong way. You know what they say, "The truth hurts!"
918ce41ddba5381a5420fe48e6b54c67aa	I think there are potential problems with these names.  My first thought on pronounciation of Kacio was like Casio, the calculator company.  Being called Casio might get old after a while.  Also, Kacio is the name of an orangutan (see link, below).  And Kali is the hindu goddess of death and destruction.  Not the optimal implication in this multi-cultural world we live in.|`|XimQM11taa	i think they are both great name very pretty i must say|`|CMuL7XpKaa	Taliah<br>  Kaliah<br>  Maliah<br>  Aliah<br>  Leah|`|hMMU02iuaa	Very unusual, almost like something from Greek mythology, but they do sound pretty :)|`|2bc760aca1235845cc56ee2f6d0c17d5aa	You just had to tell us how to pronounce these names.  Now imagine your kid having to tell people how to pronounce it's name for the next 80-90 yrs.  It is not fun!|`|Zdvx8uBcaa	I myself like them. I could understand though why some might not. Some may not only because it's not their, or they just plain out don't like it.|`|iAfmejYTaa	i like kalia not so much kacio. giv ur kid a normal name!!!1|`|iyEYXiq8aa	I like Kalia but Kacio is hard to pronounce

AA11148769	I'm a stay at home mom of two girls ages 3 1/2 years and 1 year.  I'm 24 years old - and I am the most domestically challenged person you have ever met! lol!  <br>  <br>  I completely understand where you're coming from on the whole knitting thing - how someone can take two sticks and a ball of string and make a blanket out of it is COMPLETELY beyond me.  lol!<br>  <br>  I havn't ironed in years.  I hate it, and I've found that if the clothes hang in the closet long enough, they'll eventually unwrinkle themselves.  All of my ironing experiences in the past have been really bad - my husband is in the Navy and I once learned (on the back shoulder of one of his dress white uniforms) that if you leave an iron face down on a piece of clothing while you pick something up off of the floor - it will leave an iron burn mark on the polyester dress whites!  I've also melted part of one of my shirts before with an iron (who knew that certain fabrics melt?).<br>  <br>  I hate laundry.  Once I thought that I'd just warm wash everything together - my husband had pink undershirts and socks after that.  So now, I just cold wash everything together and don't have any problems at all!<br>  <br>  I can't cook.  Anything beyond toast turns out disastrous.  I've tried for years.  Followed recipes, had people attempt to teach me, about the only other thing I can make is chilli, and I've burned that a couple times too.<br>  <br>  I had never even held a tiny baby prior to having my own.  lol.  That was interesting - never mind that I hadn't ever even changed a diaper before. lol.<br>  <br>  I've tried for three years now to grow a garden - the weeds do great - the vegis, not so much!<br>  <br>  I'm not a "craft oriented" person at all.  All of the other SAHMs that I know have their kids do all of these cute crafts and things - haha - I have no ambition for that at all.  I just can't seem to get up enough ambition for it or get into that field at all.  <br>  <br>  I hear ya on the playdough thing too - I attempted to make some of that a few weeks ago actually to make a footprint picture of my youngest's foot - the dough was "interesting" to say the least (it was the kind where you have to use like 63 1/2 cups  of salt - only a slight exaggeration!) and when I baked it, it just turned out to be one big blobby bubble - couldn't even see the footprint in it.  Needless to say, the area wildlife accquired a new salt lick.  <br>  <br>  Sewing pattenrs baffle me too.  That's why they invented Walmart in my humble opinion (costs less to buy the clothes or quilts pre-made at Walmart than to buy the material to make it yourself).  lol.  <br>  <br>  Needless to say, I am far from being that "ideal" Proverbs 31 wife that we all hear so much about!  lol!<br>  <br>  Good luck and hey - don't worry, you are in good company!!!!!|`|678421ef7889d44a940948af69477778aa	:I don't know all the great "super saver" techniques like you think I should<br>  :I only iron when completely necessary<br>  :My husband doesn't make all the financial decisions b/c he makes the money<br>  :I'm not crafty, but I'm suppose to be?<br>  :No, I don't feel guilty for not bring in an income. We discussed this and we're happy and tha'ts all the hell you need to know<br>  :I don't drive a van or carpool, is that okay with you?|`|ygbhsZ2Zaa	I don't even own an iron. I consider myself a highly domesticated and good wife only because I manage to send it out *and* pick it up once a week.<br>  Cooking is not 'an interest' for me- it is a horrible neccesity. Yes I do like to bake- because the end result makes people happy, but as for cooking dinner, I only do it because I have to.|`|5ci9IZd2aa	I'm a SAHM too. The stereotypes I have come across are these: That I do absolutley nothing, that I can sew (I can't), That since I'm doing absolutley nothing that I should babysit their kids for free. That I'm a taxi service, since I do absolutley nothing, and did I mention I do absolutley nothing.|`|AA10236694	i am not the best house cleaner But i can cook My @ss off. I cant Bake though.I really am horrible with helping with the math Home work Like because we stay home all of a sudden we are geniuses!I can Multi task but i cant balance the check book again do i have a degree in accounting Lol.I use downy wrinkle spray the iron is just for decorations. and the vacuum is for chasing the cats Haahaa.I can dust though But i really dont do windows thats what the rain is for .oh and lastly He can Buy lunch at school he is old enough Now ...|`|ajbMVt8maa	i have to agree with your ironing fact... although i work now, i stayed home until my son was in preschool and i don't think i ironed more than 2 times... both for easter.<br>  i just don't like doing it.<br>  my mom, who literally irons her jeans  (lol)  cannot figure me out :)|`|oUcLSDZ6aa	I can sew, and iron, but don't do either. Actually I am pretty crafty.<br>  My iron is still in it's box, brand new, as of 3 years ago.|`|0d8fd99482e78511337c03d547560306aa	My house is hardly ever spotless.<br>  My choclate chip cookies look more like flying saucers.<br>  I can't knit or crochet.<br>  Don't expect me to iron.|`|JZnHYhCwaa	Yes i,m domestic b/c i,m not savage|`|0v55bQT1aa	I like your thinking since I think the same way ! LOL !|`|130816e5bf662924b68497e6577df429aa	Oh, to be like Tartism Sucks.... (note sarcasm)|`|8XcRFF6Taa	I'm semi domesticated, I guess.  I don't knit, crochet, wish I knew how to sew and if something needs to be ironed my husband does it.  I do keep a very clean house(the kids and I stay out of the house as much as possible, so it actually stays clean!), dinner is always homemade and ready no later than 6, I always have fresh fruit and veggies cut up for easy access and my kids and I are always out at either the park, beach, library, river, zoo, or nature centers:)  I love being a SAHM:)|`|bMyq2nOTaa	*laughing*<br>  <br>  THIS is my favorite:<br>  <br>  'people have asked me or expect me to knit (WTH), or crochet, sorry I just can't, not even in me<br>  --I can't sew a button worth two cents, can't sew at all'<br>  <br>  Same here! Some people have said, "Don't you know how to sew a button on?!" Noooo... ;)<br>  <br>  I hate that---because I'm home---people think I can just watch *their* kids, at a moment's notice... I can't. I have 4 of my own, and, quite frankly, I just don't want to! Every time their kid comes over, they have a runny nose and cough, that I conveniently wasn't told about, and MY kids get sick! I'm done with that. :) I guess they assume I have nothing better to do, and I'm already watching kids, so, the more the merrier. <br>   <br>  I don't like the 'It's what you signed on for' speech, at all... Technically, it's what hubby signed on for, too, but I don't hear people telling him he should spend more time with his kids, when he's home. Instead, I'm expected to be super mom, with no complaints, no struggles, and no breaks, ever! My husband doesn't say this, but I've noticed many people I know, tell me all about their horrible, stressful day, and when I say something was difficult for me, it's like, "Oh." And, they seem to thinking, "Yeah, right! What could have caused YOU stress? You stay home!" I'd invite them to find out! :)|`|AA11210211	Unfortunately I am a domesticated SAHM!! lol I don't like to admit it though and refuse to do certain things like ironing but I can do them.|`|Z8Ui1ugLaa	I don't iron, that's what dry cleaners are for, or sometimes I give them to my sister to do, she loves to iron.  It's taken me a full day to sew boy scout badges on my son's shirt once, not kidding like 8 hours.  My house is "lived in" - there is always something somewhere.|`|vGxipYJnaa	People are surprised to learn that I actually can knit, sew, and bake an excellent batch of cookies because I seem like the least domestic woman ever. <br>  <br>  I absolutely cannot iron a blouse or button-down either - so I send them out for wash 'n' press service. My friends make fun of me but I'd rather that then have me burn and wrinkle all of our clothes!|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	i dont iron thats why i have a dryer<br>  i have a sewing machine.  i have used it once<br>  i can't make a pie crust from scratch (although i am trying, i actually like baking and cooking)<br>  my house will never pass the white glove test<br>  <br>  chicken - lol thats why i like the kind that you unroll in the refrigerator section!|`|AkFag8tNaa	I'm not subserviant for one. I like to make my husband happy but I expect him to do the same for me. I'm not on the pto (not that there's anything wrong w/it). I like to howl at the moon a couple times a year (nothing stupid, just drinks w/good friends) and I know what jb weld is and have used it.<br>  <br>  Stay at home: pie crusts are like my cryptonite.......I try and try and end up making cobbler|`|FvhCUHjxaa	My mother is more domesticated and she's worked my entire life and she likes being domesticated. Too bad I didn't inherit any of those traits, I can't sew worth crap. But I know how to iron and I'm sure I could make playdoh.|`|prqrQcd1aa	I taught myself to crochet when i was younger.. so i can "kind of" do it. I do own a sewing machine.. I've tinkered with it, then the needle broke (haven't used it since, and my grandmother gave it to me), Never even tried to make homemade play dough! Iron... what's that, i don't even own one to collect dust LOL. <br>  I can cook and bake pretty good, I also know how to run a motel, and several other things. <br>  I don't call myself "domesticated" I call myself "knowledgeable" I just know a lot of stuff!|`|ddP3klT3aa	I don't sew or iron. If some thing is wrinkled, throw it back in the dryer. I don't stay at home all the time though. I do work weekends. They are just giving you **** because they have to work. Some people really can not stand to stay at home. But I love being with my son. Daycare is so expensive. Why work when your pay check is going to go to day care? I assume stay at home. My husband watches him on the weekend.|`|32747dcd374c857319720ae0aa088b0faa	I work full time outside of the home. But the very idea that I would knit or crochet or quilt or any of that stuff if I was a SAHM is quite laughable!<br>  <br>  And have mercy on anyone who "expects" me to do something like that, they are in for a big surprise.<br>  <br>  I'm a good cook though, and I do know how to iron. I just refuse to buy clothes for anyone in the house that require being ironed.|`|wIZNsqG1aa	You can do anything you put your mind to, just don't give up so easily. I could do all those things and I'm a guy with a full time business to run, so if I can do it you can to. My mother God rest her soul was insistent that her sons would be able to fin for themselves so she taught us all about running the household from the ground up. BTW I'm not gay, not that there's anything wrong with that.|`|abT0o6hHaa	People also assume when you stay at home that everything in your house has to be clean 24-7. My mother yelled at me when she came over the other day because the microwave wasn't clean. I told her there were 2 adults in this house (my husband) and he could do it too. I really do hate staying home. I long to have a career. I cant wait till my kids are older so I can so back to work!!|`|XO4talxxaa	I am not a sahm, we are TTC! :) but, i get a lot of crap because i am not your typical hunter, i am a female who loves makeup and pink and to dress and to do my hair lol but i also love to hunt! I shotgun hunt and bow hunt! I got a deer about 4 years ago with my bow and i plan on getting a turkey with my shotgun this spring. Everyone is like "YOU hunt HAHAHA! Kiss My *** Yes i do and i look doing it too!|`|QveBSjFSaa	A friend of mine has a curious saying, that wives/mothers either are great in the kitchen, or have a really clean home, but never both.<br>  Let's just say I keep a really mean house!<br>  And I'm with stay@home~ the dryer has replaced my iron for the last 18 or so years.|`|T864ejaiaa	i really don't care. i work out side the home and love it. i work nights my husband is home with them. i could care less what any one thinks of me for working. and id i stayed home i still wouldn't care what anyone thought of me. two each's own. people do what they feel is right for them. not what society thinks. i'm new to this area on yahoo. and for two days now i have been reading smack about stay at home moms and moms that work. who cares?  damn yahoo trying to tell me i spelled each wrong. the whole yahoo crap is crazy.

(Atleast the social reasons i'm thinking of)  I say that because when my daughter was first getting ready to go into kindergarten is when she was diagnosed with her mental illness. I faught myself back and forth about homeschooling her the first year or sending her to school. I talked to everyone that I could about what I should do. I had someone tell me, "Look Amber, she may not seem socially ready for it now, but keeping her from it will just prolong the wait time until she has to become more social with her peers."<br>  <br>  So, I sent her. She did good pretty much all through Kindergarten, then we had to switch her meds.. that's when the behavioral problems started again in school, and we have been having problems on and off with them, but working with the school and the teachers has been a great help in getting her behavior under control at the school.|`|e0xpYnv1aa	My husband wants to get our daughter in school asap, so she'll be 18 by the end of her junior year of high school.

She would have been able to start Kindergarten a year before she would have been eligible, and I think she would have done fine.<br>  <br>  My now 8 year old son, "tehcnically" in the 3rd grade, I would not have enrolled the year he would have qualified, I would have held him back a year had he been going to public school.  He would not have been ready.<br>  <br>  Where we live, the cutoff date is in September and my daughter has a January birthday, my son a June birthday.<br>  <br>  My youngest has a September birthday, and would just miss the cutoff.  <br>  <br>  Luckily, we homeschool so in the case of all three we can start when we choose without the restrictions of the school's policies.|`|XPnCeJ29aa	I wouldnt.<br>  The school wanted to keep me back because my bday is in november and then the cut off wasnt august or what it is now..<br>  But my dad refused, and I was a little behind in reading in 1st grade, I remeber having to go to a reading teacher in the afternoon of 1st grade, but it must have helped because I was always the student with the highest reading level, and the fastes aloud reader in all my classes.<br>  I was always and A, B student except for math, which dropped to a C when I hit algebra.<br>  <br>  But it would depend on the child, if you know them and know they are not in need of waiting then I would put them in. If it is something small, they can catchup, like it was with my reading.<br>  I was 5 when I was in first grade, and 17 when I graduated.|`|nfzQkvqraa	I will have that option with my son.

She's the youngest in her class and does above and beyond in school thus far.  <br>  <br>  My son's birthday is the beginning of August.  I may wait until he has just turned 6 to send him.

At the last minute, she signed me up. I'm fine now, but I'm truly socially inept to this day.

Both social and academics are equally important. I have seen over and over again how it is to the students advantage. If you do this at the start of their education (kindergarten or 1st grade) it is no big deal.|`|8tGAE1Nmaa	do it but make sure .. unless they arent mature for that age... my son started school right as he turned 3 yrs old and he wasnt as mature as we thought and ended up repeating the first grade... but if he is near his birthday and u feel he is mature enough send him... talk to the school about their criteria and see what they say... u may have to wait till his next birhtday to enroll him ...|`|Kl1h5dCaaa	No I don't think I would.<br>  <br>  <br>  It doesn't really worry me either way.

As they get older, an assumption would be made that because they are a grade "behind" it must be because they failed a grade which could be bad for their self esteem.  My January son didn't do as well as my September daughter in school - kids are all so different!  after the first few grades you won't be able to tell any difference in where they are at compared to "older" kids.<br>  <br>  I do know one mom who tried to hold back her son because she felt he wasn't ready (November baby) and the school wouldn't even let her do it - it was against their policy & they assured her that he would "catch up" both academically and socially.|`|iLLoc003aa	I guess it would depend on how the child was performing..My son will be 5 on July 9th and the cut off is August 1st. I personally think my son is able to go to school. He knows his numbers, shapes, colors, he knows his address and his full name, he can write his name if I write it out for him first, he can spell his name out loud, he knows the city he lives in and the state, he knows who the president and vice president is...he goes potty by himself and wipes,..i'm working on the phone number, and tying his shoes..|`|SIK58haraa	I have 2 necies and there birthdays are really close together and they are the same age.

uFrqC4Y2aa	Yes, request they check your cervix. They should have already done this. I had some bleedng and they did all those checks to rule it out.|`|Eqln1jmNaa	if you want them to check your cervix you dont want them to do an internal ultrasound... a belly one will be fine... but if you are feeling kinda un-easy about whats going on down there, just simply ask your doctor to take a look just to make you feel better
DzPZ8EEkaa	I don't believe anyone can "hold you there."  You can leave AMA (against medical advice), but do you really want to do that?  God forbiddddddddd something goes wrong that could have been helped or prevented had you stayed and all for a couple bucks.  I totally agree with you and understand your dilemma with insurance (or con artists/crooks as I like to call them) and money issues.  Maybe if everything goes smoothly with your delivery and your baby is healthy with no problems whatsoever you could leave a day earlier.  It's all up to you obviously.  In my personal opinion, I think it would be safer for everyone involved to as least stay a day or 2.  Women give birth at home though under the care of midwives and doulas, so who is to say??  Good luck with whatever you decide.<br>  <br>  Oh, oh, oh.....I would check with your insurance crooks though....if you leave AMA and something happens to where you have to be readmitted to the hospital, will they even cover you then since you left?????  I would definitely check.  You might end up shooting yourself in the foot.|`|QKn1oUnEaa	The first twenty four hours after your baby's birth is crucial.  If something were to go wrong with your baby's or your health, it will usually happen within that time frame.  That is why is is mandatory that you stay in the hospital for that time period.  I am a nurse and have never seen someone released before that time period is over.  I realize that having a baby is expensive (I have three myself so I am talking from personal experience) but for the good of yours and your baby's health, it's worth the money.  My advice would be to save up your tax returns before you have another baby.  It's always good to have even a small nest egg anyway just in case something goes wrong.  Congrats on the baby you already had.  Children, as trying as they may be at times, are always a blessing to any home. :)<br>  <br>  However there is a thing called patient's rights which entitles the patient to pretty much anything they want as long as they sign an acknowledgment claim that it was against doctor's orders. The only issue with this is it can be used against you as a parent if the hospital were to decide that you were making an unwise decision for your baby's health.|`|bXRuC1ASaa	Sounds like your insurance is as good as ours. We would have had to pay $3000 out of pocket. Luckily I was able to get Medicaid as a secondary insurance to cover those costs.  Anyways, I told the doctors I wanted to leave as soon as possible. They told me baby had to be 24 hours. So once we hit that time, we were out!<br>  <br>  Edit-As for what MRS HARPER said, with my second two children I did not have to have a bowel movement before I left. With my first I did though. This may be due to the fact that I had stitches with my first, and none for my second and third.|`|iFDye9RMaa	Hire a midwife and have your baby at home!!! Sounds fun! Although I am a wimp and must have the pain killers!! but maybe your a stonger woman, it would be an amazing story to tell your child later...<br>  "I had you under the kitchen table" type of story... LOL<br>  <br>  I know you said you can't change insurance, but what about getting a secondary insurance like individual blue (bcbs) just for yourself? I am not sure if it will save you money in the long run, but it might.|`|1SGl03Zlaa	I think the rules depend on the hospital.  At the hospital near me (I live in Canada) they usually want you to stay for 24 hours because the baby gets a blood test 24 hours after birth, but my friend was able to leave after a few hours and bring her baby back for the 24 hour blood test (it was her second child).  I would suggest calling the hospital to find out what there policy is.  I don't think they can make you stay if you don't want to though.|`|mOFShz3Eaa	im not sure what its like in the states but here in canada if you have a midwife take care of you durring your pregnancy and also have her deliver your baby you can be let out of the hospital within one hour of having your baby. but if you have a regular doc do the delivery than you have to stay in the hospital for at least 24 hours, unless there is complications than it could be a bit longer.|`|OBU1eDUHaa	With my second baby, they gave me the option of leaving with baby after 24 hours.  I didn't take it though.  I couldn't even imagine taking care of our newborn plus our almost 2 year old at the same time.  I needed one more day to recover, you might feel that way too.  You can always start saving now.  Just put the $ under the mattress or in an account.  $5 here, $10 here, you will have $2k in no time.  Good luck!|`|WxQFe0GYaa	You should talk to your doctor and the hospital you'll be delivering in and see what the policy is.  I'm sure it's different everywhere.  <br>  <br>  Universal health care is not as good as it sounds.  Because of how our system is set up, we have access to the best doctors and hospitals in the world.  Yes, there are things that need to be changed, but universal health care is not the answer.|`|12ALGqtdaa	Yes, you can go home when you want, I'm just not sure if it's against medical advice if it would mess with your insurance. You might also see if you can get a midwife to do a home birth on your insurance, then you wouldn't even have to go into the hospital.|`|bc29eaf19302ac3e6d0492b8facf1027aa	You don't have to stay for any length of time.  They can't hold you.  Although I'm sure that they would prefer to discharge you according to their terms.<br>  <br>  I went to a birthing center and stayed three hours afterwards.  Just enough to rest up and nurse.|`|qxMpbNRBaa	Very doubtful even in best case scenarios they need to make sure the newborns vital functioning are sustained over a period of time Mom can likely go home next day. Good Luck and Congrats|`|2G1vkdTzaa	most hospitals keep mom and baby about 2 days. You think $2000 is bad? Be glad you didn't have a NICU baby. Dr bill alone with insurance was $52000. the hispital bill was another story|`|yp7JRGIMaa	Would you rather pay 2k to have your baby or 70% of your paycheck to cover taxes for universal health care?|`|0OFDLHJaaa	yes, u can leave after a few hours but i think its more likley ull stay at the hospital. it all depends on how the birth goes|`|tQPvv0Glaa	I think you have to stay at least 24 hours.  It's really not safe for mom or baby to go home before then.|`|JjBtgSixaa	If the doctor says so "Yes" and if no complications.|`|xV0APOtaaa	Baby has to stay in the hospital for 24 hours (little longer if you have a boy circumsized) then as long as there are no complications everybody can go home. My daughter was born at 11:49 pm on a Wednesday night, by noon on Friday the pediatrician signed our release. My niece was born at 7:08 am on Tuesday morning, they went home Wednesday afternoon.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK|`|WWmOycmIaa	You have to at least stay for 24 hours. You have to stay because they have to check on the baby and you most of the time to see if your healthy enough to go home, and see if baby is ready to go home. Im not judging but why dont you plan to have another baby when you have enough money!!! =] good luck!!!|`|ANHsv4ENaa	They can't make you stay. You are paying to stay there so think of it more as a really controlling hotel. Check out is when you say it is. Just put your foot down. They will use all scare tactics they can but if you are fine and baby is fine just leave. You won't die, your baby won't die. You will both be better off getting out of the hospital and away from the germs there. You could also look into a midwife and/or a home birth. Some insurance covers it and some doesn't. But 2,500 would be about all the cost of prenatal care, delivery and visits after baby is born. My midwife told me that she looked it up at one point and her costs are the equivalent of what hospital birth was in the 1960s!!  Not to mention getting to stay at home and not even having to deal with the hospital and the inherent dangers there.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	If it's a healthy vaginal delivery (both mom and baby are healthy), they can release you after 24 hours.|`|Z8Ui1ugLaa	Once you are in the hospital and are admitted, it's up to the hospitals regulations along w/ your doctor and the pediatrician for the baby to release you.  Speak to your doctor before hand.  You could look into birthing centers which have different rules, but you also have to check with your insurance company to see if they are covered.  Good Luck|`|aJLx0nhNaa	You can always leave a hospital yourself, "Against Medical Advice."  I am not sure if you could always take your baby with you.  I had hoped to get out of the hospital as soon as possible, because I hate them.  However, when I ended up with a c-section, I was really grateful for the extra few days.  I was not ready.|`|2arZOZWgaa	I am from Indiana and with the birth of my second, two weeks ago, I was offered the option of leaving after six hours. I had a normal vaginal delivery with epidural.<br>  <br>  I told them No Way!, but I can understand why some people would opt for this.|`|68c6B8dRaa	Of course you don't have to stay. You don't even have to go there in the first place; see about finding a home birth midwife if that option appeals to you.<br>  <br>  <br>  edit: I love Yahoo! Answers. Can't go home until you take a dump! 70% of your paycheque! Retards... _Hilarious_!<br>  <br>  My other advice would be to make your departure time clear in a birth plan; we had a doctor who was fine with us taking off a few hours after birth, and then ran into a pile of nurses who were not, and who were very confused about who was in charge.|`|2F5HNPqPaa	Different country, but I know here in the UK you HAVE to stay in for 6 hours after the birth... then you can leave if there are no complications, though they usually try and  "encourage" people to stay (I had to do a lot of arguing and nagging to get out of hospital!)  I'd double check what the rules are there so if they try and discourage you from leaving you know your rights!  Good luck and hope birth goes to plan.|`|thoMmZAvaa	They'll want you to stay at least 24 hours for observation, techinically they can't make you stay (though it may effect your insurance coverage). You can look into maybe having a home birth, I'm not sure what the costs of that would include, but I'm sure it's much less expensive than a hospital birth.|`|dXVA1wHDaa	No one can MAKE you stay in hospital against your will.  In the UK if it's your second child you can opt to go home 6 hours after the birth, if everything is ok with you and baby, and obviously depending on the time you give birth, they won't throw you out in the middle of the night!|`|LhvKTYftaa	OMG......"70% of my income"??????? <br>  Dude where did yiu get that from?  You obviously made that up!!  Good God!!!<br>  <br>  I had an emergency c-section and even *I* didn't need to have a BM before leaving!  That is not policy!<br>  <br>  I'm in Canada, so truthfully I am only responding to adree with DYOT!  The stats that dummy gave about 70% of the income is crap.  We pay NOTHING anymore.  Benefits are $40 every 2 weeks, and I make a heck of a lot more than that!!|`|HXfHkoSHaa	I don't think a hospital can make you do anything.  It's strongly suggested to stay for general tests and monitoring.  But if y'all are adamant, I think you can leave with baby.|`|dDVAUA9saa	No, you don't have to stay in the hospital if you have a normal, vaginal delivery.  However, if you have an epidural, you have to stay for 24hours.|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	Yes, if both you and baby are healthy you can leave 4-5 hours after birth if you want, they can't hold you against your will.  I would also look into home-birthing if you are interested...|`|3K7ffKn2aa	i think you have to stay over night so they can watch you both.  why not just switch to better insurance?
M6c0hUefaa	LOL, No.<br>  <br>  And that's exactly the reason I started a "new" journal during my pregnancy. It has some more intimate things in it, but it's, IMO, much more appropriate for her to read than my old journal and I intended on letting her read it when I started it.|`|AA11085356	I think I would hang on to it if I were you. It might come in handy when your kids reach that age and think you don't understand what they are going through. But even then, I don't think I would hand it over, but maybe sit with them and let them read a few entries that relate to how they are feeling. Then maybe suggest to them to keep a diary or journal for themselves.|`|UKPYoPKuaa	I've been keeping daries since 18 so I have about 15 already I keep in a sealed box..I think I might give them on my deathbed for them to read only AFTER I'm dead & buried, they'd probably be very shocked at some of the stuff thats gone through my mind, but what the heck?|`|j2mRop0laa	No way. I was a not a goody goody teenager (even though I'm more of a goody goody now- maybe not always on ya but in real life, I am). <br>  My kids have not seen a wild side of me but if they read my diary, I don't think they would even believe it was me.<br>  <br>  Good thing it's been burned years ago!|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	i don't know.  i guess it would depend on the content, the age and maturity of the child. it could be a useful bonding tool if we were having a hard time relating to each other.  it could go either way.|`|AA10937078	I think you should review the content, edit out the stuff you don't want your kids to read and share the rest of it.<br>  <br>  "But you just don't understand!"  <br>   To which you would respond, "Oh, yes I do. I went through the same thing when I was your age."  And give her/him the section of your teenage diary where you went through "it" as well.<br>  <br>  There in your own adolescent handwriting would be proof positive you were once a teenager too.<br>  <br>  So if your diary includes passages or pages of teen angst, then I think you should let your kids read it.  Teen angst wasn't invented by this current crop of teens!|`|Kl1h5dCaaa	Uh no.<br>  <br>  I wasn't interested in boys in high school (I am very special I know). But it holds my deepest darkest thoughts in the world.<br>  <br>  I do still own it. I was in an accident where I lost apart of who I was. Reading it is reminding me, of who I was.|`|cYRZpGkqaa	That's a pretty good question. It shows them that you were once in their shoes. But mine would have been anything but mild. My daughter would probably lose all respect for my authority if she read it.|`|nfzQkvqraa	not a chance.  Maybe my daughter once she's an adult and has made her own mistakes.  I can barely sit through it.  Excruciating is the word that comes to mind.|`|3WWHWsHOaa	I never kept evidence of my misdeeds. If I had a diary of my teen years it would have been burned well before my kids were old enough to read.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Nope. No way. No. Not a chance in hell.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	Some of it.|`|VuUz8NgKaa	There is no way, those are my thoughts and mine alone.|`|8jlOGOAeaa	Probably not. I was in a very verbally/emotionally abusive relationship during my senior year (and unfortunately my freshman year of college) and my diary really reflected that. A lot of one day writing "Why do I let him treat me like that? I know I don't love him anymore, so why am I here" and then the NEXT day be like "I love him so much. I know we fight, I know he says mean things, but doesn't everyone?"<br>  <br>  I actually felt ashamed of myself after re-reading it a few months ago. Of course, I will share my experience with my daughter, let her know what I learned from it. But, there would be nothing learned from her reading it.....gah.|`|7sNWRxYNaa	I wont let any one read my diary. Some one read ym diary when I lived in a grouop home and I went to a provincial park and set fire to it in a fire pit. A diary is a personal book full of personal thoughts that no one has to the right to read. When some one reads it they no longer become personal thoughts.|`|oMGasIcjaa	Absolutely not.  That is your past, and they do not need to know nitty gritty details.  You can share basic stuff with them if you want to relate to them.  I would never share a diary with them though. You are a parent, not a friend.|`|0v55bQT1aa	Yes, I would so she would finally realize, how good she has it. I became the devil in College but before that, I had a lot of childhood issues to deal with at home.|`|SIK58haraa	I would let a teenager read mine. Maybe they would relize how silly they are. Mine is, I love someone every other page. I love this boy now I love this boy...How silly things are..|`|mbgBFjKOaa	As long as there's no sexual content/language.|`|zjuMrDmGaa	No way....besides, mine was entirely in coded writing and I burned it after moving out of the house....it was NOT tame.|`|WGCa811vaa	Maybe when they are adults, if they are interested.  NO WAY would I let my girls see it before then.|`|cteyFJxhaa	Not a chance in hell.|`|5ci9IZd2aa	It depends on how old they are, but I would.|`|IDZbmKLyaa	Maybe. Just to help them understand that I went through some of the things they'll probably go through.|`|zpLaunPMaa	nooo. its your past. <br>  you should burn it.|`|2RvEa28uaa	helllll no|`|AA11476782	NO WAY...and I wasn't a "bad" kid!|`|ajbMVt8maa	no way.<br>  i wouldn't want him using it against me!|`|pqzKlNudaa	No what for?|`|UcMK6SYkaa	nooo!!!<br>  they'd use it against you, one fine day.<br>  <br>  okay example.<br>  <br>  your daughter brings home a druggie who drinks and drives and abuses her. (HAHA SCENARIO, IM JUST SAYING!) anyway, so you obviously dont approve.<br>  <br>  and when you rationally try to tell her why, she'd snap and say "YAH right mom youre just like nana trying to control my life cause you never got a chance to live yours!"<br>  <br>  see, not a good idea.|`|8IJek7kZaa	No i would not let them read it may be if they where older kids like 20years I would consider sharing it would them and that would still depend on the kids. weather they could  appreciated something like that or not.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	Only when they were old enough to have children of their own.  It would be a good scare for them, lol.
UcgWrGaAaa	My second daughter was also the same weight.  The babies suck for comfort, AND the breast milk digests quickly.  It's a full time job isn't it!!!  I usually just planted my butt in front of the TV in a comfortable chair.  <br>  <br>  Also, nursing frequently is the right thing to do in order not to get engorged.  It was bad with my first but by the time I had my second I wised up and it was a lot less.  You do want to notice any hard spots on your breasts and you can massage and even give them some firm rhythmic squeezes while nursing to loosen up the hard spots.<br>  <br>  Are you able to nurse lying down?  This was my salvation, when they're little they'll keep you up half the night and then when they get big, everyone needs a nap just because things are so busy. ;~)<br>  <br>  Happy nursing!!!|`|Ot8lxaMEaa	Both! You said your milk wasn't in yet, so his natural instinct is to suck away to try and help your milk come in, Once your milk comes in he will probably go longer but b/f babies do nurse quite frequently. Don't let it get to you and as long as he is gaining weight once your milk comes in he is doing great. When he nurses, enjoy a glass of water or milk and a book or TV show. Allow yourself to enjoy this time of nursing. Whenever my ten month old nurses, I have to work to keep him entertained! I miss the days of getting him latched and being able to relax! It goes by so fast...|`|WtTUNC8Naa	My son was only 7lbs 3ounces when he was born... and he ate 8 ounches every 2-4 hours. He was one hungry boy. He continued to eat like that until i started him on baby food at four months old (i skipped rice cereal cause he refused to eat it). at 15 months old, he's still a lil piggy. I mean he's not fat. he's about 30lbs and 33 inches talk.|`|sBHhnDwaaa	Jamie was glued to my boob in the hospital. Thank goodness my milk came in at 2-3 days. He's new, and constantly sucking helps milk come in. Do NOT give him formula... <br>  <br>  Congrats Momma!! Message me all the details!!|`|OT7t6pyyaa	All newborns eat frequently. Their little tummies are so small that they need to eat less more often. It will eventually slow a bit but not for awhile. Also, I had a 10lb, 12oz baby so I know what it is like to have a big baby! He ate quite frequently but i don't really think it was much different than any other newborn. Good luck!|`|hbjbm3SRaa	Congratulations! My son was born March 1, 2008. It's an awesome thing being a mom. My son was 7 3 when he was born so i'm not sure if bigger babies eat more but he wasn't very big and he ate all the time. Just because he's bigger doesn't mean he needs to be eating more. Make sure you don't overfeed him because that won't be good for him as he grows up. Good luck!|`|860158682c2b7621907ad595c456bf5faa	hey! i know exactly how u feel, my daughter was the EXACT same weight! how cool! anyways, she was eating constantly!! it was like every other hour, eating an ounce or an ounce and a half. by the time she was almost a month old, she was eating 4 oz. and still wanting more! i almost feel now as though i overfed her at times. she is now 6 mo. and was eating 8 oz., but is back down to 6 oz. b/c she is eating baby food, too.<br>  Hope i helped!!<br>  And congrats too!!!!|`|pXSKSS3daa	Aw, that's not big really. <br>  <br>  He's only three days old, of course he's going to eat often. His stomach is about the size of his fist so he may eat every half hour-every 2 hours at this stage. Completely normal!|`|CVdcrY3kaa	My daugher nursed constantly, she's seven months old and she still nurses more than the average baby her age. She was 8lbs 10oz, size may have something to do with it...but in general I think some babies just eat more.

I wish I knew.<br>  <br>  Doesn't it take two to report? It's probably someone with a few accounts who's doing it. I got reported once and it was frustrating, so I can only imagine how yucky this is.<br>  <br>  We like your answers! So I hope this stops.|`|UghJ0XROaa	I believe there was a nice issue revolving somehow last night around you and Veronica(Hunter's mommy). So it stemmed from around that|`|RT3Og4Oiaa	Same thing was happening to Rebecca last night as well...I suggested to go through check for fans that you don't remember having that popped up out of nowhere, Delete and block new contacts until you find out if they are legit or not. Make all your Q&A's & contacts closed as well. Make sure your IM, E-mail & 360 links are set to private as well.

Apparently, a lot of people are getting reported.|`|q4rG5Dwtaa	can you maybe block that person as a user?<br>  <br>  edit: I wish I could help you, sooner are later she will get bored with harrassing you and jump on to someone else.|`|pXSKSS3daa	I would make your Q and As private.

x10qO89saa	im a stay at home mom who definitely knows what it is like to go crazy watching kids shows all day and having no adult contact for hours at a time. however harassing your friend like that is not how to solve that problem. i would just not answer the phone. she'll get the hint when you haven't talked to her after a long time. does she live near you or do you see her regularly in person? or is it just over the phone most of the time? cause if that's the case just don't answer the phone. your probably going to hurt her feelings but at this point there seems no easy way to do it without her getting hurt.|`|OtbbKdITaa	Maybe you should try being honest with her. There's always the chance she isn't aware that she is annoying you. You may try something like, "I don't answer my phone when you call because you rarely have anything to discuss. I am busy, and I do not have time to play games on the phone. However, if you have something you'd like to talk about, you can call me."|`|l79QIWszaa	She's feeling lonely, but that's not your problem.  Give her boundaries, say "I can only talk on the phone at this and this time on such a day because I have work or I my husband and I are doing this and that".<br>  <br>  I have an opposite situation where a friend calls me all the time but she is the single one and I'm the one that is married and has a child.  Sometimes she calls me at 1030pm and the next day wonders why I didn't answer and then says, "I didn't even call late."  Pish Posh.<br>  <br>  It's hard to stand up to your friends, but you need to live your life, too!|`|uGqYoZNEaa	I don't know why she would want to be friend with you.  Apparently you think you're better than her bcos you've been married for 2 years and just bought a house.  Completely irrelevant facts, but good for you!  She is a young mom, with a young baby. Should've listened to your husband bcos more than likely she probably does need adult interaction which can be hard to get right now.  Just tell her you are too good for her calls and are happier in your house with your husband.  She willl understand.....after a long, awkward pause.<br>  <br>  I dare say it, bcos not once in your post did you say you are extra busy, that's different than pointing out you're married and have a house.  Tons of people are married and have a house and kids and still know how to be friends to someone who apparently is looking for adult interaction.  Nor did I say you were young and immature.  Your words, not mine, enough said.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	"I know you need a lot of support right now, but I'm not the best person to give it to you.  I'm sorry, but I would like you to stop calling me all the time."<br>  <br>  Her feelings will be hurt, and that sucks, but if you don't want to be friends with her anymore, that's inevitable.|`|q4rG5Dwtaa	I had a friend like that, its like we drifted apart, she would call me and talk to me about her child and I didn't have any so we had nothing in common, there would be long pauses all the time and sometimes I would ignore her phone calls. We haven't spoken in years, and now I have kids and I sort of miss talking to her. If I could change things I probably would not have been so ugly to her, because today I would still have a good friend.
7kzahNJ7aa	I baby-sit a nine year old boy who still watches yo gabba gabba. I'm fifteen and I think that it's a really awesome show!! When I was a kid I watched shows like Arthur and Max and Ruby and Dragon Tales until I was about ten. So yeah, I think that it's normal for kids to be amuzed by shows that aren't in there age range.|`|3Psi4kBxaa	Yes its very normal and nothing wrong what so ever with that. <br>  ( Connie Mom of 4 and 5th. Grade Teacher )|`|Z8Ui1ugLaa	My 8 year old still sits down and watches these shows with his sister.|`|pDvM3213aa	I agree, I think kids these days are watching too many "mature" shows too soon! I think it's great that he's still watching them! My son is 3 1/2 and wants to watch more adult shows and then learns words like stupid :( I know it's not a bad word, but they don't say that on the younger kid shows!! I think it's great!|`|AA10405438	This is great and definitely should be encouraged.  Too many kids want to grow up too soon.  I think it's wonderful your son is still the little boy he should be.  Great parenting!!!|`|CxCigxZIaa	Yes!<br>  Nothing wrong with it.|`|aKBqMLuhaa	I know teenagers that still enjoy sesame street.....|`|SlkLCLoDaa	My son totally digs Yo Gabba Gabba, which is fine by me. When he still watches Nick Jr it makes me feel like he isn't growing up so fast:) I have 2 older kids that want nothing to do with it anymore, when just 2 years ago Dora was the cool thing. But now they have outgrown it.<br>  <br>  I don't see the harm in him still watching it, at least it is better than some of the stuff out there!|`|rSIF5jtSaa	Yes it's perfectly fine. It's just something that is entertaining to them. As long as they're still mentally progressing and doing well in school, then no worries. I have kids in my day care that are still those ages and they still enjoy watching those shows every once in a while. They 'll grow out of it soon.|`|BRT2teSqaa	Yes that's fine!  My 9 year old still LOVES Curious George and Arthur, along with the Hannah Montana crap.  I wish it were all Curious George.<br>  <br>  I also knew an 8 year old girl who loved Barney (about 7 years ago or so).  She even had Barney at her 8th birthday party.  She liked it, so who cares?  Kids will stop watching it when they're good and ready.  You should be glad!|`|3dT7f39maa	All my five year old wants to watch is Cbeebies, so I cut the other channels off, that and Finding nemo (I know every word - I'm not joking), and Shark tale.|`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	yea funny thing is i still watch dora, franklin and i used to watch blues clues until they got rid of steve god i hate this new guy joe.|`|55c6bcdec944656754c033c36667ba6baa	Yes that is perfectly normal. I know alot of kids that age that watch anything from dora to I carly|`|Rx8U8eVnaa	Yeah it's fine.  They don't grow out of them until about 7.  All the 5 year olds I know still watch those.|`|VPL6eZpPaa	My 7 year old still loves to watch old Blue's clue's reruns!!!
CeS9Pin7aa	My oldest didn't get her first tooth until she was 10 months old, and she lost her first tooth the week before grade 2 started...she would have been just turning 7.<br>  <br>  She was the only kid in her grade 1 class who had not lost a tooth so she was ecstatic to finally lose a tooth before grade 2 started!<br>  <br>  My second got and lost teeth earlier.  My 4th just got his first tooth at 10.5 months so I expect he'll lose them late too!|`|X8uwhApDaa	He must take really good care of his teeth.  My daughter didn't lose her first tooth until she was 7 1/2.  After that all the front teeth went like dominoes.  She started teething at about 5 months, usual age.  I have a 5 year old boy who still hasn't had a loose tooth either.  <br>  Part of it is diet also.  My kids have always eaten well.  They only get soda once or twice a month and they drink lots of water.|`|1VdgsZPoaa	My daughter began cutting her first tooth at 6 months old and she got her first loose tooth at 5 1/2 years old and lost it about a week after she turned 6.  It was in there a long time, lol.|`|AA12273294	my son got his first tooth when he was about 6mos and lost his first tooth when he was about 5 or 6yrs old but it doesn't mean anything bad if your friends child hasn't lost any yet my niece was almost 8 before she lost hers.
Hf5doDxsaa	I have my daughter on a really think formula because she was spitting up so much.  I use the Playtex Drop-Ins and I just bought a pack of medium flow nipples the other day, and I'm going to actually buy another pack today.  I got them at Meijer (Michigan), I don't know if you have one of those in your area.  I saw them at Walmart too. I looked online at both of their websites and couldn't find anything.  I did find a website that might work for you.  <a href="http://www.playtexstore.com/cgi-bin/item/PLA05785" rel="nofollow">http://www.playtexstore.com/cgi-bin/item...</a><br>  <br>  My drop-ins came with slow flow, not medium.|`|b34544fc1adbb12a05af0930e6aca42caa	some grocery stores babies r us and walmart. they here all have them.

Go slow so you don't make it too fast. Save your money!!!|`|cab8f3eed982d7c810bf2e8fc14f2cecaa	At our walmart and kmart I've seen medium flow nipples. See my son and I had the same problem when he was about 4 months( at first I wasnt producing enough and then it all dried up and Luckily didnt have to go to hospital). He started on Similac Alimentum. The bottles he uses only comes with stage 1 and stage 2 nipples. But the stage 1's adjust to being slow or medium flow for baby. Most bottles I see come with slow flow nipples or less its higher ounced bottle then it comes with fast. I actually saw med. flow nipples for playtex drop ins and playtex advanced. Hope this helps!
zqfs7A6Caa	The "eat whatever you want as long as you're eating" method always backfires. Our son was a picky eater, and this was the advice many internet sites and some of our friends gave us. We gave liquid multivitamins in our son's juice, and let him eat (or not eat) whatever semi-healthy food he wanted. I say "semi-healthy, because nothing is healthy if it is not balanced.<br>  <br>  Don't prepare him  separate meals unless you are eating something especially spicy.Give him one thing that you want him to eat and require him to take a bite before he can have any side-dishes that he may like. Require him to eat a good portion of his food before he will be allowed snacks later in the day.<br>  <br>  If he hasn't eaten a fair portion of his food by the end of dinner, take it away and reoffer it later. Limit his intake of fluids other than water throughout the day. No child will starve himself if good food is available.<br>  <br>  One other thing is to not make TOO huge of a deal when he eats. Don't let him think eating is an accomplishment that deserves a reward of some type. Thank him for trying the food you lovingly prepared, but leave it at that. <br>  <br>  Multivitamins and V8 Fuse are good, but you need to get this under control as soon as possible, in order to develop healthy habits that will last his lifetime. The longer it takes to form good habits, the harder it will be to break the bad ones.|`|263434b6fe9b827cbad3893e796d8d18aa	Hide the meat and veggies in foods.<br>  finely diced or grated carrots in meatloaf, makes it super moist.<br>  meatloaf or chicken and beans with cheese in guesodillas<br>  finely chopped broccoli in grilled cheese sandwiches<br>  And I definitely agree with above. You eat what I fix or you don't eat. I'm not a short order cook.|`|ea1be7f3312ea146ce80bef5c8f176deaa	aw hun! at least its not just one thing he eating, then you could stress all you like!<br>  your wee one is discovering his own power in the world, and becoming his own little person. expressing his opinion on food means you pay attention to it, and him, maybe you need to try not to look like you're really bothered, kids pick up on things and wind it up more!<br>  also his tastebuds are changing and maybe he has discovered different aspects to the flavours he encounters, these can be strange and a little overwhelming for a wee one.<br>  around 2 and a half? local playgroup snack time, leave him to it n watch. surrounded by other kids who just eat stuff he may follow their example<br>  thats all off the top of my head, hope it helps a bit,<br>  my wee boy was like that at 2, he's 8 now n eats for scotland.|`|koVk3P9Gaa	He ate like a trooper until 18 months?  Now all of a sudden he's become a "Picky" eater?  Do not cater to this.  I can't stand these parents that have to make all these differant meals because they have a picky eater, tough luck.  Either eat what's in front of you or don't eat.  Period!!!  You are not a restaurant.  They don't become picky overnight, he's just being difficult.|`|z7ZlO9rpaa	I have a similar problem with my 2 year old except about the only thing he will eat IS meat! I talked to my doctor about it and he said that he is growing fine and he wouldn't worry about it unless he just isn't growing or thin. He gave me one option to try though...just offer him one thing that you want him to eat like meat or whatever and that's it until he eats it. If not at that meal save it for the next one or a snack. I personally chose to just let him eat what he wants within reason. (Not candy all the time and such) <br>  <br>  Now I have noticed him eating a slight more variety of foods when he is offered them. I think that a lot of parents go through this. So hang in there!|`|zJamClb2aa	Will he eat bread? if so you can pack a lot of veggies in muffins and bread. We mix up eggs like we are going to scramble them, we put in some peppers, some lunch meat and some cheese, pout them in a mini muffin pan put in oven for about 8 mins on 400. they are good and soft (And the only thing my son would eat when he was 2) Also try smoothies, I hear you can get veggies in there too. As for meat, have you tried making steak that is medium rare (not super bloody just before it gets cooked all the way thru) Good luck, we have spent many a days trying to feed a texture obsessed kido !|`|oojO4WAraa	Relax.  His eating habits will change.  It does sound like he is getting proper nutrition, and that is what eating is about.  Good job you are not giving him junk.  He will get more adventurous in his eating as he gets older.  Don't make this a big issue, but do offer him lots of different things.  He is still pretty young.|`|acj9mB9Paa	Sounds a lot like my son!!  LOL  <br>  <br>  My son will eat a raw carrot once in a while though.  I have been giving mine Voots.  I is a full day's servings of fruit and veg.  I really want my son to eat eggs for some easy protein, but I can't get him to eat them in anything!  And like your son, he used to eat GREAT!!!  *sigh*  Hopefully it is just a phase.  All I can think of to do is keep offering everything???

And between ages of sixteen and eighteen the parents should still have monitoring access to their child's account. <br>  <br>  Your sister is totally clueless about what goes on in those sites and they are not intended for people under age sixteen.<br>  <br>  But if she insists on doing such a stupid thing, make sure SHE has total access to the site including setting and locking passwords and reviewing all "friends" and e-mail, etc.  Ten year olds do not have the common sense and judgement skills.|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	computer related things with kids are up to the parents. IF you think they can handle it. Then you have to be the one smarter than them and be checking on them at all times. You have to be more computer savvy than they are before you let them do what they want. ITs hard now a days if you don't keep up on software and ways to hide things. If you are unable to do that then I say don't let them. IF you are, then its not a bad idea. Pictures are pictures... if a sick pedophile wants to get pictures hes going to get them anywhere. I dont get worried about putting my kids pics up... I never do inappropriate ones and I share with only my friends but if someone wants to get at them they will... Parents are the way to keep there kids safe. Check often who there friends are. Check there walls, dialogs, messages, and chats. Be sure there isnt anyone hinky on there and ASK ASK ASK bug bug bug... dont just write off things as "they are growing up"<br>  <br>  With the world the way it is, we can do only our very best to keep our kids as safe as possible. Though computers are the way of the future. Why stop your child from what is going to be the next step in communications. Your kid can bump into predators right on the street. IF you are only worried about computer predators its not likely they are ever going to get far with the kids. Its the friendly neighbor, or the priest, or the babysitter that always turns out to be the culprit. Its your job to be on your kids and watching them and asking and being a concerned and protective parent, but DONT smother them.<br>  <br>  Why stop at worrying about Facebook pages, just the other day i was at my SIL house we went online to look at Ebay items, she was typing in something on the browser list, and the last looked up things came up...we noticed things that relate to the male and female private parts, menstrual cycles, and other things that led to PORNO sites. When we looked at the history we saw that many of the sites were looked at. We went after my brother for it, he was so insistent, so we questioned his 2 ten year old daughters. SURE enough they heard something at school so they looked it up... yep and it went to Double Penetration pics in a gallery. So how do you stop that??? They had locks on and parental controls but they still got there. My SIL and Bro didnt even know how to check there browser histories!!!|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	Would you let a 10 year old child walk free in a strange city?<br>  Say New York?<br>  <br>  If not, no...absolutely not.<br>  Parents should never treat online like it was "safe".<br>  Pedophiles track down children using their blogs.<br>  Cute pic in a school uniform? <br>  Bingo---they now know what the child looks like, and more importantly WHERE a child will be. <br>  They also tend to list personal info, without thinking.<br>  <br>  Absolutely not.|`|Kl1h5dCaaa	My Children won't be.<br>  <br>  I don't care how others raise their Children|`|8SjoUQmEaa	Well, it's not a horrible idea as long as she closely monitors her child and has access to the account, and has it set to private, so no one who's not on her friends list can even view the profile, social networking sites are okay for kids as long as they're very closely monitored by parents, which means that the mother would have full access to the account and would have to check messages and his/her friends list occasionally, and make sure the child knows to NEVER talk to anyone they don't know in real life.|`|ibeYAlwpaa	defly not. make up a scarey story for her. Like that child molesters target keds that age. They find them on facebook, represent themselves as a person similar in age and befriend them. Once the  child gets used to the person and trusts them they will ask them personal question that will not set off red flags for 10 y.o because they are typical questions, I.e. what school do you go to…. What teacher do have… & they use simple information like (in addition to their name or the pic that the 10 y.o. puts up) to snatch them up from school. Or sporting event…<br>  <br>  && that’s not unrealistic. That does happen. Also, would facebook even allow someone that age on there? I know myspace has an age limit (or they used to).<br>  <br>  && if they are allowed it needs to be CLOSELY monitered. Dont use Names, Schools Attend, area live in, and a parent needs to be able to access at any time... and no pictures|`|KVEGzknvaa	The bottom line is that at ten years of age, a child does not understand how to deal with predators and harassment online.  If one cannot handle these problems, they should not be on the internet.  Psychological damage is possible due to harassment, and real danger in the form of kidnapping, etc. is possible as a result of real-world ignorance.  Unless a child will be taught how to avoid these bad situations and how to deal with them, I hope they are not allowed to access the internet on their own.|`|7sNWRxYNaa	Your not aloud to have facebook under the age of 16 most use  a fake age.

Our daughter had a talking doll from Germany (we're a bilingual family and we like to include German toys) which had a pacifier in its mouth. It speaks when you take the pacifier out. Our daughter managed to lose the pacifier and the doll would not shut up! I tried shoving other things into its mouth but that didn't work. I couldn't get the back of the doll open because it required the tiniest screwdriver ever. This doll repeated about three really nasally, annoying phrases translating into things like "feeeed mee mommmmy!!" I thought I was going to go crazy. I ended up putting the doll in the trunk of the car until her batteries ran out. <br>  <br>  The pacifier for the doll has actually never turned up!|`|op55FtqYaa	About 13 years ago when my sister was little she had a Winnie the Pooh doll that wouldn't shut up. Being a kiddie myself I decided to fling it across the room and stomp on it until I heard it utter the words:<br>  <br>  "Why are you hurting me??" <br>  <br>  I ran out of that bedroom as quick as lightening and refused to go back until the doll was thrown out in the rubbish!! <br>  <br>  I swear to God, thats what it said.|`|C4miEeuYaa	HAHAHA LOL, that's hilarious! Yea- my daughter has this polar bear and Penguin, thing where the ball rolls down a slide thru the polar bears mouth and ends in a plastic swimming pool. Well the other day-I went to step over it, but stepped on one of the balls, then tripped, and fell on one of the penguin things on it on my butt.

My daughter has the Elmo live doll and the tickle me elmo. They drive me F***ing crazy! She also has this big dinosaur with a motion detector and it roars or whines when you walk by it.

I was in the bed all cuddly and warm.. mmm... all the sudden i hear RRRRRRAAAAAAAHHHH!!! i jumped out of bed and kicked the mess out of that stupid thing!|`|cteyFJxhaa	I've actually locked toys in the glove box of my car.......|`|8e24d1c388df94db1d64ee0290523581aa	Yes I have one somewhat similar. This one was sing and snore Ernie, he would out of the clear blue start talking to us when we were watching TV or when someone walked by. My daughter and I used to just sit there and laugh about it," I am so sleepy",secretly thinking I was too Ernie. I think it has something to do with the batteries wearing out and needing changed but I am not sure. It was especially startling when we watched a horror flick which feeds into the whole possession thing. Good luck with Sesame Street characters, they will let you know there are not  so many sunny days but sometimes awesome good times !|`|AA12127693	Ok, it wasn't one of my children's toys - I was scolding my dog last night when I got home (he has a fetish for eating potholders) - I was standing there with the 1/2 eaten potholder in one hand shaking my finger at him with the other hand asking him questions and expecting answers!  My son then looked at me and said "mommy, you do know that Harley can't answer you back?"  We both laughed at it!<br>  <br>  I can understand about the demon doll thing - and it was a great laugh...thanks|`|bMyq2nOTaa	OMG, hahahaha!! When my oldest two were toddlers, they had an Elmo toy that talked; I think it said some numbers and the alphabet. Anyway, that dang thing would go off, ONLY at night, and the batteries needed to be replaced, so it sounded demonic... Scared the heck out of me, the first time I heard it. I was like, "What the *beep* was that?!" Even my husband wondered what the blast it was, so we hunted for the offending toy *insert Mission Impossible music, here*, and eventually found some Elmo book, I think it was... Sometimes when it kept doing it, I would smack it against the floor, trying to get it to stop. I'm sure, to the casual observer, I would have looked like a nut!<br>  <br>  Blame Elmo. :)|`|e0xpYnv1aa	Hahaha that's the funniest thing I've ever heard.<br>  <br>  I'm too lazy to get up at night and turn off a toy or put it away...so I'm sure if one was going off in the middle of the night I'd swear at it too.|`|AkFag8tNaa	Legos under bare feet

Even as I watch him struggle,  I try to teach my child the benefits of difference - how being different can make you a stronger, better person. It's not just that it's okay to be different, but you can actually derive strength from it. And seeing how my son grows and becomes stronger in the face of adversity, so do we, as a family. I wish people understood that color, or disorders, does not define a person; it is a part - but not all - of a person.|`|hl5WdXnbaa	Yes I have had too.<br>  <br>  I am Native Indian and well you do not see too many of us around anymore and sadly there are still many negative stereotypes.

My 13 year old is very dark skinned. So far I do not worry about her, she sticks up for herself very well when people make comments about how dark she is. I guess teaching your children self confidence is also key. <br>  <br>  anyways, now that I have rambled LOL   I would not like a comment or that word at all.

And when she got older she was much happier to play on the mat with toys.<br>  I think for a newborn a bouncy seat is much better, and for an older baby an exersaucer or even a jumperoo are more useful.|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	We got one, and loved it-both myself and my daughter.  <br>  <br>  We now use it for my young niece, who visits us often.  My daughter (now 17 months) will get jealous and as soon as we take my niece out, she will squish herself in it.  <br>  <br>  I do recommend it.  It helps them practice using the muscles necessary for sitting, and atleast in my experience it would make my daughter happy to have a different view of the world for a short period of time.|`|J2glFOkhaa	I love them! They are awesome, but they can be pricey|`|M5jF5w5Taa	I agree with other parents here who said that these are useful for a relatively short time. I thought mine was only okay. I would look on Craigslist for a used one, because they are pretty easy to clean, as long as the shiny surface isn't damaged. $30 for a new one is about as high as I've seen them in stores. Before paying that price, I'd  try one out and make sure that you really like it.<br>  <br>  Oops, I was wrong about the price. Mine was $40 brand new, but it was a gift. Also, I got it when they first came out a couple years ago. Now they are easier to find second hand.|`|4hSUePTqaa	We loved our bumbo it actually really helped with my little guy and his big melon lol. He had troubles at first being able to hold it up but then after just a short week he was doing great. Worked really well for us until he was able to move doing the army crawl i mean. After that which was about 6 months he started to climb out. I would buy it again for the short time we did use it. I go on craigslist.com alot and have found people selling there used but like new conditioned ones for 10-20 dollers|`|B1JFBV3jaa	My 6 month old loves hers.  She got it when she was 3 months old.  It has really helped with her posture.  She sits straight up when she is sitting unassisted.  Also, when I am trying to cook/clean, I will move the bumbo around with me, from room to room, and she can sit in it and 'help' Mommy.  :-)|`|UXhFcHCHaa	i got an alternative to the bumbo. i got him the summertime seat with a tray that includes toys. its the exact same price for a bumbo and it turns into a booster seat also|`|q4rG5Dwtaa	it was good until about 5 months old and he started getting stronger he would almost flip the seat over so we had to watch him very closely.|`|dDVAUA9saa	We loved out Bumbo seat and used it alot once she had sufficient neck control (around 3 months I think).  We paid around $60 for it from Toys R Us.|`|EeGgovyCaa	Waste of money|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	My baby loves hers, and it's great if I need to get ready, or do something while she's awake.  I just put her in there next to me while I do what ever, and she seems happier watching me, then if I put her in her swing.  But it's like anything you buy for a baby, so worth it, IF the baby likes it, a waste of money of the don't.  My little girl is also a peanut, so she'll be able to use it longer then some other bigger baby.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	I think that's the average price. My daughter had one, we used it for around two months, maybe less, until she could sit up fairly well by herself. She seemed to like it.
CYcqQb6Caa	i have a 20 month old wil be 21 months on the 8 and i let him eat whatever he wants (well not chocolate all day but you know what i mean) try giving him fruit from a can i know fresh fruit is better but kids like it from the little cups or the can. have him help you make dinner that way he will want to try what he helped make. i hope this helps.|`|jsoSKMEmaa	My little girl is 14 months now and when she was a baby she used to eat anything - when she hit 1 year old all that changed!! She is very tall for her age but a tiny build so I worry about her now that she's picky with her food. I'm lucky with fruit as she'll always eat it but if she thinks she's having veg she won't eat it! Try disguising foods. I tend to do her some veg like broccoli, cauli & suede and melt grated cheese into it then she eats it! Or jacket potatoe is good disguised with beans & cheese or tuna, it'll do him some good! Make some sweet potatoe fries (cut them up like chips and out in oven with a tiny drop of olive oil on them for 20 mins, add herbs if you like). My little girl adores these and are good to fill her up and put weight on her. Does your boy eat cereal? Try cheerios, with or without milk. They are generally a great hit and very good for them. Hope i've helped a bit.
FgAPXhVRaa	I seriously doubt it. The only thing that makes the pregnancy line show up is the pregnancy hormone and since water does not have that in it... then I would think whether water got on it or not you are pregnant!!! Congrats if you are!! If you are anything like me, you will take a few more tests lol. I was completely in shock. :)|`|e5a8ca9a40c842fd6f909812078000a7aa	I would wait until tomorrow and go buy a clear-blue test, that way they are more accurate, i wouldn't think the water would of damaged the test as you are less likely to test positive falsely than you are than you are to test negatively falsely.... Just wait until the morning hun, i'm sure you are pregnant!!! :)<br>  <br>  Good luck and keep us informed!!<br>  <br>  If you ever need a chat, just email me xxxx|`|saWJM651aa	Good Luck.  When you get paid get the same test you did the first time and take it.  If it is postive, call the doc.  If it is negative, then wait to the following month and if you still don't start then make an appt.|`|sqaey2Siaa	It is extremely rare to get a false positive b/c pregnancy tests actually only detect hcg..which defiantly wouldn't be in water.|`|s4OtfZ7Gaa	i'm not sure if water can mess up the test, but it's possible. at the same time, only the HCG hormone can turn the second line so, water wouldnt cause it to turn. if the second one was a very cheap one, and you are very early it could be that it was negative because your HCG levels arent high enough for it to read. take another test tomorrow, and try to keep water away from it, hehe! : )|`|XGp3oF5baa	A False Positive means exactly what is says. it was false. Water could have affected it cause it almost always has some kind of chemicals in it. But remember it does say to get the best results use your first pee of the day. Try again and if the next one is negative than most likely aren't but if it is positive I would go see a doctor.|`|LY2LSzPJaa	On payday go buy another one, I doubt water would make a positive result seeig how that hormone is not found in water. but double check get the same one you did before ( one you spilled water one ) and get your answer. If it is negative and you beleive you are pregnant then go to the docs for an exam,<br>  <br>  Good Luck and if you are Congrats|`|Rhr1umV1aa	It's possible. Depends on how long the pee had been on there. I thought that I had a defective one after I had peed on it and it did nothing. So then I ran water on it and it was negative. So then I got another and it was positive and I made sure I peed on it really good. And the cheap ones work just as good as the others if not better. I got "good" pregnancy tests with both of mine and they said negative I got the cheap ones and they were positive and I was pregnant both times|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	I think you should test again just to be sure, you never know with those tests... They are so sensitive! Try to buy a first response test or clearblue... they are a little bit more sensitive at picking up the hormones than the cheaper ones.|`|Ueix2Q7Taa	normally the cheap tests are less accurate and can't pick up on lower hcg levels. Did the test you originally bought not have two in the box? Normally there are two of them. What brand was the first one?|`|LDPabWk0aa	i think you did.|`|JWp9PMyRaa	YEAH.JUST TAKE ANOTHER TEST..|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	might have|`|uuHPneEcaa	very rare u get a false positive. i think u should go see a doctor and let them do blood work so u can know for sure.. or u can wait another week and take another one. it could have been the water that messed it, but I think ur pregnant.<br>  <br>  how did u get a lil bit of water on it.. lol..

NbJbZXtGaa	She is small for her age. My son (granted, not a girl) was 33 inches and 26 lbs at his 2yo check up, and that was only the 10th percentile for height and the 25th percentile for weight.

rkSBHqtQaa	It can be done. My hubby and I  have 3 boys, (8,2 and 8 mths).we make it work on his income alone. He makes 60,000 a year. Plus he also has an art side job which pays him pretty good. I'm a full time stay at home mom. We also live in a 2bd apt for now, plus we also have the car note along with other household bills.  We are looking to buy our first home pretty soon.  Its just going to take some budgeting and what not but it can be done. Its just a matter of being able to give up certain things and such. But if you think you can't afford it at the time, I say just wait and enjoy your little one for now.|`|379adf8ec6ff418678fc28b78cee178baa	You don't have to live a rich life to stay home, you just have to be willing to make sacrifices. My husband was making $2,000 a month when our daughter was born 4 yrs ago and we had to live with his parents for the first year. We had quite a bit of cc debt, no family who could babysit and we both had jobs with crazy hours that daycare couldn't accomodate. I decided to stay home and we just made it work. My husband had to change jobs a few times, we saved as much money as we could, we got rid of things we didnt need, etc...It CAN be done.  Also, you should really look into buying a house. This is the best time to buy with prices low, intrest rates low, and an $8000 tax credit for buying this year. Of course it depends on where you live and how stable your job is, but its worth looking into if you havent already. <br>  <br>  I just had our 2nd baby in Jan. I quit my $20,000/yr job to stay home with my son and my daughter is 4 and in preschool. We knew that it was going to be tough, but we have done it before and it was worth it being able to be home with my daughter for 3 years. We have been struggling but believing that we could do it, believing that God would take care of us. This week my husband was offered a new job which will make up the $20,000 that we will be out this year since i am not working. My point is you have got to BELIEVE that you can do it. You have got to be willing to sacrifice and do the right thing for your children and by God. We struggled with the decision much like you are and decided that we needed to trust in God to take care of us and i am so happy to say that he has! Pray about it...dont ask us, ask God. i know it may sound silly, but after all we have been through, I am a believer! Good luck!|`|acj9mB9Paa	Not trying to be ugly.....but why have another child for the day cares to raise????  If you are not going to be home to raise it, what is the point?|`|AA10424047	My kids are 20 months apart, and we do it on $41 000 a year. The only difference is that our house is bought and paid for, there is no mortgage, no rent, just property tax and bills to pay. My husband works and I stay home with my kids. I agree with milk making mama..I can't stand the thought of letting a day care raise my kids, so we're choosing to have me stay home until they're both in school full-time.  Day care here is also $1200 a month per full-time child. It's ridiculous. My kids are 2 and 3 months.<br>  <br>  <br>  You could do it, but it would take a lot of readjusting finances. A 3rd, however, would be out of the picture.<br>  <br>  Also depending on what your rent is, you probably could afford a house and mortgage. Talk to the bank about it. I know my bank told me I could afford a mortgage if my rent cost $600 a month..don't know how though..I never asked and never had a need for a mortgage.
8x7rFddHaa	I think no one is really ever absolutely certain of the timing of children, there are so many things one can be concerned about. My husband and I became pregnant with our second when we felt we could really only afford 1 and we have FAR less annual earnings than you. The reality is that we made it work and it's a wonderful thing for our family, especially our first child. They are 3 weeks shy of 3 years apart and the timing for them is perfect.<br>  <br>  If you really feel that a second child is right for your family then you may need to re-prioritize to make it work. Make a list of what you NEED and what you WANT. If you are really honest about those categories I'm guessing there is room for elimination on the WANT list that will put you in a more comfortable situation to make your dream a reality. Also remember that children don't NEED the bells and whistles we provide for them in babyhoood, those are generally items that make us feel better or impress other adults; our children can be happy with a few clean outfits, healthy food, loving care and a handful of simple toys (which can be pots and pans and a wooden spoon!) <br>  <br>  My advice is to follow your gut and your heart and make the decision you feel is right. Either way there will be sacrifices so do what will make your family the happiest. Good luck!|`|x3fQP9viaa	I would personally take the 6k, wait until my lease is up, go month to month and use that money as a down payment on an inexpensive house.  You may miss your 2 1/2 years apart timeline, but having a house is with storage is important when having 4 people in your family.  <br>  Yes, you can afford it, but it's not your only option.|`|W5oUJgcuaa	It is normal. What people fail to realize though is that nobody is Truly prepared to give anyone a perfect life. Weigh out the pros and cons and keep in mind that there is never a "perfect" time. First, school, then college, then career, then buying a home, getting married, when is the perfect time? Don't stress. It is normal, but know that a baby always will find its way if its meant to be  :-)|`|vGxipYJnaa	People afford children on a lot less -  but I can see your concerns. The good thing about a second child is that you already have most of the stuff you'll need (clothes, crib, changing mat, carseat etc). <br>  <br>  It's really up to you. Having your children 3 1/2 years apart isn't all that different from 2 1/2 years if you decide to wait. It's also a lot easier to deal with a newborn and an older child than a younger one. <br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|WPI0Z47saa	I would probably get a house first (or 3 bedroom apartment). Besides if you have the opposite gender you have to check with your apartment complex because most will not let opposite sex children share a room. My SIL's kids were taken away from her temporiarly until she found a 3 bedroom residence. Even in a house they can't share a room past age 6 but apartments are different. Just something to think about. This is the 3rd situation I have heard of where kids were reomved from the home for this. Check their rules first.
Ke9gAvJTaa	Yes, That should be fine. I give my kids juice, all though like you said, its not great for them. Do half V8 and half water, mix it,. and give your son the juice.<br>  It will taste great, and he'll love it<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: To the lady above who said you cant, You said that you know its not great. She's saying no because its full of sugar. Its not gonna hurt him, But It is sugary. :)|`|ddP3klT3aa	No. Too much sugar and it would be hard on his stomach. Don't give your baby any thing without asking his dr.|`|WxQFe0GYaa	I don't see any reason to give it to him.  I'm sure you could, but why?  I'd say don't bother.|`|7kosr9mcaa	Yes. My son will only drink the new V* fusion juice. He LOVES IT. He hates all of those baby juices.|`|mOFShz3Eaa	i wouldnt only because there is so many ingredients in it. if by any chance he has an illergic reaction to anything you wont  know what it is. check the label and if he has had everything on the list before than you should be good to go!|`|DZzBfzVeaa	I dont think I would give that to a 7 month old. The juice is healthy but I dont think their stomach will be able to handle it. You could always ask your doctor.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I'd read the label.  That sounds like a juice that has a lot of junk in it.  It's probably just fancy fruit punch.<br>  <br>  If you are determined to give your baby juice then give him 100% juice with no added stuff, made from an easy fruit like apple.  Dilute it a lot with water.
hORVMOHKaa	i didnt start getting breasts changes until the end of my first trimester everyones different you would probably be around 3 weeks if you are pregnant (counting from your last period) but probably only 1 weeks counting from conception. probably to early for signs i would wait and see if your period comes|`|eydwkJ2Naa	I am 9 week pregnant, and mine started being sore even before I was late, but the other girl is right, everyone is different. I don't mean this to scare you, just to inform you, but I took 2 home tests and both said negative. As I said before, I'm pregnant now, so they were wrong. I was able to get a blood test done and find out that day. I am one of those people who just can't wait to know something like this. I would suggest, as the other did, to see your doctor, but I'd wait until you are a few days late. Tenderness can also be due to your hormones changing because your are about to get your period.|`|9qkCf6Mlaa	Actually I was about 2 days late and my bf and I were having sex and I noticed that my breasts hurt a lot.  And instantly I knew I was pregnant.  The next day I took a test and sure enough I was.|`|E7smxUOZaa	Go see a dr to be on the safe answer
98WKYtfwaa	You will definitely produce enough milk and colostrum for both babies. <br>  <br>  If you want to try breastfeeding/nursing you'll need a lactation specialist or a nurse in the hospital to show you how to latch the baby on first, because it's not as easy as it looks, you can end up with really sore nipples and breasts if you do it wrongly, so i hear. I'm a very shy person too when it comes to these things, but i always think to myself, these nurses have seen a million breasts before and i'll never see her again.<br>  <br>  I heard that pumping is actually alot of work compared to breastfeeding/nursing alone. <br>  <br>  I was told that if you express your milk, you need to continue to do so every few hours so that your boobs don't become engorged or sore and if you've got bottles made up for night feeds, you'll still need to feed the babies and pump because your boobs will be full of milk again.<br>  <br>  It's the same with breastfeeding of course, but it's not as time consuming as pumping.<br>  <br>  I really want to express too, but i'm having second thoughts about it after asking a similar question and being told how time consuming and hard it is to do. I think i'm going to breastfeed and if i can't do it or it's too hard then it'll be formula feeding for me. <br>  <br>  If you decide to breastfeed then after around 2weeks you can introduce a bottle teat, they don't recommend doing it right away because the baby can get confused then stop taking the breast or bottle, that's not always the case. <br>  <br>  You don't produce alot of colostrum, but the babies aren't that hungry in the first few days anyway and trust me the amount of colostrum you produce is enough for them.<br>  <br>  EDIT - You can pump colostrum btw.|`|JjBtgSixaa	Your body will produce enough milk for both babies.  Breastfeeding is wonderful.  It is a way to be close to your baby.  They are healthier when you nurse them.  When I nursed my 4 children, they would not take a bottle only me but that suited me just fine.  I didn't go back to work until they were almost 1 so it made it easier.|`|yCR6qg0baa	Call the hospital & enroll in a parenting/birthing class. They'll teach you how to breast-feed and tell you the pros & cons. Also, after you give birth a lactation consultant will come help you out until you understand. Your body produces milk on a supply & demand basis. There will be enough for 2 babies. <br>  <br>  There is nothing better for your baby than breastmilk. No formula can compete. And I say, if you're going to go through the hassle of pumping, you might as well just skip that step & breast feed. It will make them both closer to you. Also, go to www.youtube.com and they have a TON of breastfeeding tutorials.|`|zwJbUbWMaa	I never breastfed, only pumped and it worked just fine.  I didn't do either at the hospital, just waited until I was released and started pumping at home.  In the hospital I was in the nurses were really pushy about it and made me feel uncomfortable or I might have started pumping at the hospital.  I doubt they are that way at every hospital though.  Like you, I wanted my child to have breastmilk but I have just never felt comfortable with the actual act of breastfeeding. Plus, like you, I wanted my husband to be able to feed our son too. Just make sure you pump as often as possible so you don't dry up.  I don't know if it was my fault or not but my milk dried up after 6 weeks on its own after an infection and fever.   I plan to pump with my second one too in May and now that I am more experienced I might just tell the nurses what I think if they try to get pushy again this time.  Good luck!|`|5RvTXdmUaa	You'll be able to produce enough milk for both, most likely. I think it's recommended that you wait 6 weeks before introducing bottles. If you feel uncomfortable doing it in front of people, there's nothing wrong with asking them to step outside. I was the same way. I hope you do try breastfeeding. It is an amazing experience and you wont regret it.|`|0CA5eNOCaa	As long as the babies eat breastmilk, it's fine. With twins, your time is pressed even more than with just  one child. & breastfeeding just one child is more draining and time-demanding that people expect. But like the other answer says, just wait a couple of weeks (it can be fewer than 6 but at least 2 or 3 weeks) before introducing a bottle to avoid "nipple confusion". & about the "over supply" issues....the more the better in your case!! Just pump the excess & freeze it. Some women don't produce enough for 1 baby, but if u produce TOO MUCH for 2 babies that's great.|`|OBU1eDUHaa	As far as being modest and shy, you will lose that in the delivery room.  Sorry.  There isn't a chance for you to be modest after going through a vaginal delivery.  You will be able to produce enough colostrum for 2 babies.  I would rather breastfeed at the hospital and pump later.  I have heard a lot of babies get the bottle right away and get used to not having to suck very hard with it, then they don't want the nipple because they have to work so hard to get milk from it.  Good luck!|`|deIzFnV8aa	I understand that colostrum is hard to pump, since it is thick and there isn't much of it. I've seen some websites that suggest you hand express instead.  If you are willing to suckle at first, I think you might find it easier for the first few days.<br>  <br>  It will establish also your supply much better if you let the babies suckle at first instead of pumping.  Babies are much more efficient than a pump is as far as getting milk goes.  If you are going to pump it is suggested that you start w/in 6 hours of birth and do so up to 10 times a day for the first week in order to establish a long term supply. Of course, baby will need to eat that much too, but it is much less fuss to put a baby to your breast (usually!) than to mess aroudn with pumps and getting letdown and such.<br>  <br>  I was a very shy person too, and I was surprised how easily I adjusted to the idea of a boob hanging out in public. I never even liked to get changed for gym in the public locker room! I was also pleasantly surprised how very little was visible when the baby was actually on your breast. This helped me feel more comfrotable as well. Anyway, you might find that you don't feel so intimidated when the time comes.   It is ok to ask visitors and even nurses to wait outside while you feed, too, if you prefer.<br>  <br>  I agree 100% that eventually pumping and having daddy help with bottles is a wonderful idea.  Especially when they are eating a lot at night :P especially with twins!  Our dr recommended waiting 3 weeks to introduce a bottle because of nipple confusion, but really it is just when nursing is "firmly established", which can be much easier. I think people worry a lot more about nipple confusion than they need to, in the end. But I did wait the 3 weeks, so I don't know that from personal experience.<br>  <br>  Supply is controlled by a variety of factors, including nutrition, now much your baby nurses, and others. I haven't read anywhere that one of those factors is genetics, but I haven't read otherwise either....|`|iFDye9RMaa	dont worry about the hospital they only asked me if I needed help or if my daughter was latching on well. when I said yes, They said ok and left me alone. They wont attack you about it. Just answer their questions and tell them that your fine and you will let them know if you need help. <br>  I am not sure about making enough milk for twins, I couldnt make enough for one baby... I hope you can! I hear it is very rewarding! <br>  congrats on the babies!!|`|vCq3dR40aa	I respect you so much for choosing to breastfeed twins.  <br>  As you are worried about modesty, get a cover you are comfortable with.  There are many styles to choose from.  I made one like the link below. About $16 That way I didn't have to practice with it.<br>  <a href="http://www.honolulubabies.com/hidenpeek_nursing_apron.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.honolulubabies.com/hidenpeek_...</a><br>  <br>  Please start nursing in the hospital.  You need maximum stimulation and of course the best chance possible to make it work. And yes, you will have enough colostrum for both babies. It may take some trial and error.  Please work with a lactation consultant if you run into any problems or it hurts a lot.  (And have lanolin at the hospital with you)  <br>  <br>  I asked for help just about every time I went to nurse while I was in the hospital, but it saved me from cracked or bleeding nipples and other problems.<br>  <br>  Most breastfeeding books recommend you don't start pumping until about 4 weeks and breastfeeding is well established.  I had to work long hours for a couple of weeks twice during the first 4 months.  Both times I had to use a bottle to get baby started at the beginning of a feeding because she preferred the instant response and easier sucking of the bottle.<br>  <br>  Oversupply issues:  My favorite nursing book covered that well as well as an appendix on drugs and medicines during breastfeeding.<br>  The Nursing Mother's Companion by Kathleen Huggins.|`|xV0APOtaaa	Breastfeeding at the hospital isn't that intrusive. The nurses will help you the FIRST time to make sure the baby latches on right and that you are comfortable. After that it's your schedule and most hospitals have private recovery rooms. <br>  <br>  My only caution is watching the transition. I solely breastfed my daughter for 2 months, then I bought some bottles when we flew down to Arizona to meet daddy for the first time (he was down there for a military assignment and could not come home for delivery) so he could feed her too. After that she had a hard time going back to the breast. After another month of trying I had to give up and she was feed on just the bottle.<br>  <br>  When my mom had my brothers (twins) the hospital taught her to hold one baby under each arm (feet facing your back) when breastfeeding. She was able to do this until they were about 3 months old.<br>  <br>  And just a heads up if you don't have your pump yet. Most insurance companies will cover one or I got mine through WIC. (only condition is you only get ONE....so if you ever decide to have more hold on to it) But the one I have is a dual manual and automatic pump, you can pump both sides at once. It comes it a descreet black bag that just looks like a lunch bag so if you have to take it to work noone has to know what it is, and it also comes with 4 removable ice packs that fit into the bag to help keep your storage.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!!|`|z6IekuwSaa	I just want to let you know that pumping IS breastfeeding. Breastfeeding is either nursing or pumping. And I would suggest nursing waaaayyy before pumping if you are able. Since you have twins you may have to switch boobs each session if one eats more than the other to even them out. It's really easy to nurse or pump in the hospital and nurses have no prob kickin people out for you. <br>  <br>  I just want to let you know as an exclusively pumping mom, it sucks! I only had one and to keep my supply up with her I started off pumping 8-12 times a day every day for the first 2 months. It tallied to 10 hours a day spent pumping. Around 2 months I dropped to 8-10 times a day for a total of 8 hours a day and still kept my milk supply. I am now at the 4 month mark and am trying to drop to 20 minute sessions 4-5 times a day without losing my milk supply. I think it would prolly be even harder with twins. If I were you I would think of pumping as a backup. Like if one of them is tounge tied or something like that and can't nurse, that was my case. It is waaayyy easy to nurse no matter what people tell you.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	I just want to add that pumping is a pain in the butt.  Here and there it's fine but doing so every 3 hours every single day..... NOT fun.  You have to BF early on to establish a good supply (4-6 weeks).  <br>  My youngest went through nipple confusion at 8 weeks of age and I pumped exclusively until he was 7 months old.  It was the biggest pain ever and would have been soooo much easier to just BF him (I wish I could have!).|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	pumping doesn't get nearly the amount of milka s baby so it doesn't help your supply much and your milk supply will probably take longer to come in and you will most likely not be able to pump enough. also,  a bottle is much easier to suck out of and babies tend to preffer it if that's what they have had first- so it's best to do the breast first and after a couple of weeks then introdice a bottle- if you really want to give them breast milk your best bet ould be to strickly nurse them from your breats at first. also, there is no need to me modest when they have seen much more than your breast. pumping is so much harder. it will be harder nursing twins but after a while it will be mucheasier than to bottlefeed them- you can get two fed at once and not haev to wash all the bottle and what not
60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	Cute question!! : )<br>  <br>  I know exactly when both of mine were conceived.<br>  <br>  With my 1st, my husband was in the Army and gone for training for a few weeks.  It was local, he was at the base he was stationed at (Ft. Hood- 30 minutes away from our house).  They released him for 6 hours one Sunday... that's when our oldest was conceived.  Not planned btw, I was on the pill.  <br>  <br>  With my 2nd, we were at a hotel room in Kansas, on our way back home to Texas (from Wisconsin).  We had been trying for 6 months and gave up when it finally happened.<br>  <br>  ETA:  Thank you for sharing the pics!  You are adorable pregnant!!

I know, only because things were a little rocky in my relationship, so there wasn't too much going on in the bedroom,  it really being the only option.  An ultrasound can be off by a week in either direction, especially one that far along.  Those measurements are by how much the baby has grown, in comparison with other baby's.  Some weeks the baby can do a lot of growing, and others can be less.|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	My second son was conceived on Sunday, December 23, 2007.  A couple of days later I was thinking to myself, "I think I may have been ovulating that day, that's not a good day to have had an oops!"  The result is below:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://i649.photobucket.com/albums/uu211/rosie1200/mason4-1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i649.photobucket.com/albums/uu211...</a>|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	Yes, I know the exact day and time.

I'm one of those lucky ducks that can feel the pain with ovulation.  Like monthly knives in my gut.  It's wonderful.  But with that comes the luxury being able to plan a family.  <br>  <br>  I happened to be on the phone with my husband at the moment "that" happened.  He was like "Whaaa the heck???" So I told him what just happened.  Long silence, then he said "You still get long lunches on Fridays?"  <br>  <br>  So Evan was a nooner!|`|4hSUePTqaa	Hi there like u my son was concieved in sep of 07. The 12th to be exact.

I was freshly divorced and dating a guy that I knew and we did the deed only once on July 4, cause well yah know it was the mood. The rest of the time we used protection 100%. Welllllll July came and I missed my period. August came I missed and then I took the test and bam I was pregnant so I KNOW when it happened. We are married now and happy, with out second child on the way, I dont know exactly when she was conceived but know what week... those ultra sounds are taking measurements and comparing them to a national average. I would not rely on them as gods honest truth. If you know what day it was then you know!<br>  <br>  Yeah I have heard that the doggy position is good for conceiving.. I didnt hear about male sperms dying earlier but when TTC with my first husband the doctor always suggest doggy style, or missionary with a pillow under the butt and sitting for 20 minutes with your butt inclined to help let gravity carry them down. With doggy your pelvis is naturally tipped downward helping the swimmers get to the eggs better.

I got my digital BFP today morning and i am so excited. cos i was using this internet cheapie. even when i saw the faintest, fainter, faint line i couldnt believe my eyes. so i took a digital test yayyy im pregnant...<br>  <br>  OK here goes my story.....<br>  <br>  i was diagnosed with pcos 7 months back, i consulted doc. she said to discontinue the pills after jan AF comes. i thot that she wll give me clomid to make me ovulate. but no she didnt give me that. instead she said we will chk out if i am ovulating on my own. i was scared cos i was so sure that i wont ovulate and i wont conceive in feb. so i planned to visit doc in march and ask her to prescribe me clomid. <br>  <br>  but still i did what i am supposed to do. i started charting BBT. and BAMMMMMM!!!! 17th i had +ve OPK. 17 evening i had severe cramps, and 18th my temperature dropped from 98 to 96.8 again raised drastically the next day still it is raised. we BDed only on 17th and 19th cos... my husband was feeling sick on that day. so i just lost my hope...<br>  <br>  symptoms-like:   the very next day of my ovulation... i had sore nipples, i would never forget that cos, i hurt that lot, i couldnt wear bras or tight shirts. wheww... it last for 5 days not more than that , then they were gone<br>  <br>  then mild cramps here and there... then creamy CM...past week i had severe headache and hot flashes... now head ache has gone.. <br>  <br>  on 11 dpo i tested with internet strips, very faint line.. thot it was evaporation line, the next day i screwed up the test the next there was a line. it got darker day by day... today... i toook clearblue digital and it said..

To tell you the truth, I had decided to go visit my mom who lives in another country and started making plans for that ... I had decided to give up the "routine" of TTC and take a break. I conceived the 2nd month of "giving up actively TTC"<br>  I had heard a lot of advice from a lot of people about how to stop worrying about it and how to get a hobby or do something else... but i couldnt get myself to do that, until I got tired of it all and simply decided that if I was not meant to have a baby at that particular time, I was may be meant to do something else for the time being. And then, the day that I got my visa and was about to book my flight, I missed my period and voila! I was pregnant!!!<br>  :)<br>  Hope your efforts pay off and you get pregnant very very soon!<br>  Best of luck!!!|`|8x7rFddHaa	I TTC for 6 months with my first, 4 months with my second.

tLGbtmGsaa	I had my twins at 35 weeks.  But my pregnancy was very complicated.  My twins were suffering from a number of problems.  Twin to twin transfusion, growth restriction and one has a heart condition.  I was not sure if I was going to go home with one baby let alone two.   When my babies were born they were taken straight to the NICU.  Both spent quite a few weeks in hospital.  A lot of ups and downs but now they are  15 months old and they are both happy and healthy girls.   I think you should stop worrying and take each day at a time.  You and your baby will be fine.  As the weeks go on the baby's chances of survival increase greatly.  Even if your baby was born now he/she will have a very good chance of survival.   Take care :)|`|uCnmYEPBaa	My husband who is now 34 was 6 weeks early, he weighed in at just over 6lbs and was 19 inches long.<br>  He had to spend about 8 days in the hospital because he had jaundice.  But other then that he was perfectly fine, and that was 34 years ago, the rate for survival now a days is much better.<br>  I think your baby would be just fine. But if you stress over it, it's going to make you sick so relax and enjoy.|`|NPmRmnG6aa	I think at 29 weeks babies have a 9 out of 10 survival rate. Here is some info I got from 3dpregnancy.com about your baby at 31 weeks.<br>  Your Baby<br>  From this week on, your baby will continue to gain around ? pound a week until shortly before birth (even though it may feel like a whole lot more with every step you take). Other highlights this week:<br>  <br>  Due to increasing space constraints, your baby's arms and legs stay drawn up close to the body now, known as the fetal position (oh, so that's where that name came from!). Plus, your baby can now process information from all five senses—so she'll be all set to smell the pureed peas, taste them, feel them as she mashes them into her hair, hear you crack up and then see the flash as you grab the camera to snap picture after picture.<br>  <br>  By now, your baby's lungs are the only system not fully mature. And by mature, we're not saying that the rest of your baby's systems are mature enough to be out past 10 PM with the neighborhood hooligan, just that her lungs need a little bit more time to bake before they can kick it in the outside world. <br>  <br>  Your baby weighs about 3? pounds and measures a little over 16 inches, about the same length as that miniskirt you used to wear (and will again someday!).|`|T48smu01aa	Baby has a very good chance of survival, if anything would happen your baby would probably be fine but have to stay in NICU for awhile b/c his or her lungs wont be fully developed....<br>  I think you will be fine  though if doctors already know your risk then they will make sure that baby stays in there as long as possible.<br>  Good luck and congrats!!|`|hameOvsyaa	A lot of people have all their kids preterm. The baby will survive so dont worry about that because all babies have a good chance surviving after the 5 months of pregnancy. I'm guessing the baby will weigh about 6 pounds or something like that.
DwM1Y1nZaa	i've bought a few things from ebay. sometimes it's what it says it is and other times it's not..you can always complain but ebay is very hard to communicate problems with..they don't seem to have a telephone number and everything is done through e-mails. Look at the sellers feedback that may help.|`|bMyq2nOTaa	I've purchased clothes for myself, my 11-year-old son, almost 10-year-old daughter, almost 2-year-old daughter, and 4 month old daughter. :)<br>  <br>  They've all been great... However, I did buy a chili pepper costume for my baby, which *said* it was newborn size, new, with tags, but when I got it, it was 6 months!! She couldn't wear it... Not only that, but it didn't look new, and even though the tags were on, it looked like they'd been put back on!! <br>  <br>  So, sometimes, you'll get jipped. Most of the time, you'll probably get good results... Good luck!|`|PoAiGIUDaa	I've bought a lot of things off ebay for my 3 year old son. Sometimes you get the stuff described, sometimes you get exactly what you got. I've had both good and bad experiences. I dont shop too often now, because I've spent quite a bit of money and got some things that werent as described. NWT does mean new with tags. Some people are very honest on there, some arent. Hope this helps!|`|a1uoxczTaa	i probably wouldn't buy a lot of so many clothes. if they are good ebayers and you complain to them before leaving feedback, they may offer you some money back or something. NWT means new with tags so if they weren't then you could definitely complain to ebay.|`|5ci9IZd2aa	You can get brand new clothes, at Kohls, Target etc on Clearance racks especially at Kohls. I always stock up on Clearance items. For Instance, February is the best time to stock up on next years winter clothes I just go up a size. I bought 10 shirts and a couple pairs of pants  for 30 bucks and a new winter coat for $30, it was originally $110.00. I do the same thing when August and September come around I buy all the summer clothes for the following year. It does take time to shop clearance racks but I save a lot of money on my kids clothes, your really getting a deal when your only paying $1 to $6  on a shirt or pants.|`|WGCa811vaa	I have bought on ebay for my two girls.  Mostly I buy pj's for them as my oldest is very picky about what she will wear to bed.  I feel like ebay is a crapshoot & while I've been lucky I know some that have not been happy with their purchases.  I don't like to pay the crazy shipping charges so rather than shop online I go to consignment stores, especially for clothes that I know they will be wearing outside & will get dirty anyways.|`|ajbMVt8maa	i haven't tried ebay for that very reason.<br>  i like amazon.com... they have good deals and are trustworthy :)|`|C4miEeuYaa	I LOVE eBay..And so far-I have been VERY pleased with the results of baby stuff I've bought. But yea~ you need to be cautious. You need to make sure you are checking their feedback scores before bidding. I did, one time, bid on a lot of like 4 purses before checking the sellers feedback. Well, they were all supposed to be designer and in good condition. Well, 1 was "Bedazzled" and didn't even have a tag on it. And the Gucci one, well it was DEFINITELY a fake. But for the clothes...Always happy, thus far. Also, check the sellers refund policy. Most will give refunds, and some will pay the shipping for it.|`|AA11887900	Like any internet shopping, it's hard to know if they fit right without being able to try them on. <br>  <br>  I've purchased some new-with-tags name-brand clothes (mostly out-of-season or last season) on eBay that really were NWT, that fit very nicely, and others that didn't work out at all. But with the price I paid, it was worth it. I donated the stuff that didn't fit and wrote them off on my taxes.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you got a bad seller. Most are better than that. You can report them for misrepresenting their items.

I feel as if they are for the most part, not all of them, "Stepford wives" and it's no wonder that movie came out with Kate Winslet and Leo di Caprio, playing a young couple raising their family outside the city and being so miserable. I thought at first it's probably me, (and I didn't even see the movie yet read the book) but it's not.|`|5ci9IZd2aa	I agree too many stuffy people.

I remember one time I was in the store with my son (before my daughter was born) and he was just under 2 years old.  He was whining and he was tired.  I knew this, so I decided to use some humor to distract him say "Boy, do you need me to call daddy and have him carry you out by your toes?"  (to which my son laughed at because HE knows I'm being silly).  But some woman stopped and gave me a long dirty look.  SHEESH people!  Get a sense of humor!  <br>  <br>  Or my husband is one that jokes a lot.  People comment on how beautiful our daughter is and his answer is always "Yup, I'm accepting donations for my gun fund.

LDYAGJCxaa	You can't always trust the doctors.  That said, a lot really depends on how long you've bee trying.  If it's only been a few months, then I wouldn't be concerned.  But if you've been trying these last two years, then you may need to see someone.  <br>  <br>  My sister was trying for a year when she talked to her doctor and was told to wait 6 months also.  She did, and still nothing.  The doctor really didn't look into it much, so my sister went to a fertility specialist and was diagnosed with PCOS.  It's now been three years and they're still trying.<br>  <br>  A doctor can't tell just by looking at you if you have fertility problems, especially if they don't specialize in fertility.  My suggestion is this, if you've only been trying a few months, then I would wait the 6 months before getting any testing done.  Pregnancy doesn't always happen right away.  But if it has been more than a year, I would get a referral to see a specialist.  They'll do some blood works, and an ultrasound and this will give you a better idea of what you're facing...if it's anything at all.  Good luck hun!  :)|`|scdOdaTKaa	If you have a period then yes you ovulate, you can chart your bbt and use the OPK's to pinpoint when you ovulate.

077a430c1a605554bc4be87a313735a9aa	Yes its called PUPPS and is only cured by giving birth....<br>  <br>  You can try some lotions or your doctor can write you a prescription.|`|e0xpYnv1aa	Yes...theres about 4 or 5 "pregnancy rashes".<br>  <br>  If it bothers you ask your doctor for special lotion or cream, or buy anti-itch lotion|`|FgAPXhVRaa	Very normal. I developed eczema, actually and my already sensitive skin became even more sensitive! I normally use free and clear laundry detergent, but since I have been pregnant I have not been able to use fabric softener too. I also have been unable to use any kind of fragrant body wash either. So I would try doing those things, as well as putting on lotion, fragrance free and all that! Good luck and I hope that I helped!|`|LY2LSzPJaa	yes it is called pups , its like eczema , most pregnant woman get this , try to apply lotion like coca butter or somthing , try not to scratch|`|acj9mB9Paa	I had pups with my first and it itched HORRIBLY!!

There more restless, for some reason.  The only time I wake my daughter is if she falls asleep at like 5:30 or 6.  I will let her sleep for like a half hour, but then I wake her, but most of the time if she does fall asleep this late she wakes after a half hour on her own.  It's like a power nap for her.  Her bedtime is between 7, and 7:30.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	How is he sleeping at night?  I usually do not wake my son from long naps.

SaX09eNtaa	Hi, not sure what is totally involved with a breast lift?? Do they put in implants?  I had breast enhancement surgery about 5 years ago.  I was a 34A.  This was after I had my son, who is now 10.  I now have a 11 month old baby and had no problems whatsoever breastfeeding her. (I breastfed both my kids).  If you are getting implants, I don't think you will need to worry about sagging if you do it now, then have another baby later.  Obviously only being a 34A, I never had sagging, lol, but I am now a 34C, and they are just as perky as before.  So all in all, I would go ahead and do it.  I was very concerned when I got it done, that I wouldn't be able to breastfeed, that was very important to me, but my Dr said I should be able to, and he was right.|`|ZadTQtJaaa	Wait until you're finished having children.|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	wait till you are SURE you are done with any kids. Since these surgeries come with the risk of nipple sensation loss, some mammary gland loss, and scaring that can hurt you if you try to nurse the next baby you have. If you dont breast feed then you run the risk of them increasing again when having the baby and ruining the surgery. Though time and gravity will do that for you and you will just have to get another surgery. I am going in for a breast reduction when I am completely done with kids, though I should be well into my late 30's early 40's by there. I have always have large heavy natural breasts (40 DDD and nothing to be proud of) since my teenage years. They have ruined my posture and they look horrible. I want to some day have nice neat breasts that fit normally in a bra and not look like Ma Kettle any more.<br>  <br>  BREAST REDUCTIONS ARE NOT UNHEALTHY... My doctor even recommends it. Since I have cystic and fiberous breasts I am more prone to having breast cancer, and problems later with my breast health. I am OPTING to have it done and prolong my breast health. ENHANCEMENT is different. REDUCTION is only taking things out  and moving it all up, NOT putting things in.|`|Wehjuvpmaa	If you have the surgery done before having another child you will have waisted your money - same thing will happen all over again...wait till you have your last child ...THEN go get the surgery|`|8WOzftFuaa	I agree with Kim wait until after other wise you will have wasted your money|`|gkJzftcZaa	id wait till youve had your next baby, as otherwise you might feel the need to ahve another breast lift which would be a waste of money if youve already had one...<br>  because having a baby will again make your breasts "balloon" then deflate, causing sag even if they have been previously lifted.<br>  also, if you do get a breast lift now., the results will only last untill you have another baby, and then you will be left with similar breasts to the ones you have now afterwards unless you have more surgery...|`|vkW6UeRqaa	>> Sweetie u should do neither, because it is very unhealthy and unnatural either way.

Honestly, I come on here to relax sometimes, but end up coming off so vexed up I can't speak!

I wouldn't take my baby to get her ears pierced that young personally.I think when they have long hair etc, that is when it looks cute. <br>  <br>  I mean she is going to probably have her ears pierced one day so yer, why not get it done when she is too young to remember anyway.<br>  <br>  Don't be offended by the answers you have received on here, they mean nothing, you and your baby is all that matters!<br>  <br>  XXX|`|iMaTMWMxaa	I got my ears pierced 6 weeks ago, and I'm 28!!<br>  <br>  Claire's accessories is expensive by the way, if you're in the UK.

I've had no problems with them at all.<br>  <br>  It's funny, in a way I wish I'd had them done earlier, as I'm not 100% sure about them now.

Do you want your wee one to look so cheap and common, you know what people think "look there goes the chavy kid with it's ears pierced and it's a baby,what a tacky thing to do".

What is next what should my baby wear on the Jeremy Kyle show?|`|B1JFBV3jaa	My daughter was 8 weeks old.  She didn't even cry.  I was able to clean them for her and she was so young that she didn't even know that she had years yet so she never pulled on them.  They healed perfectly and she looks adorable with them. <br>  <br>  And about it being their decision, they could always take them out if they don't want them when they get older.  How many females do you know of that doesn't have or want their ears pierced?  Not many.  It's not like you are wanting to tattoo your child.  Give me a break...<br>  <br>  And like Janet W. said about herself, most people that are against it are OLD and/or old fashioned.<br>  <br>  Wow...the ear piercing nazis are running rampant today!|`|sgMno1PRaa	I would never get my babies ears pierced, I will wait intill they ask me and when I think that they are responsible enought to look after them and not get them infected - its a learning curve for children taking responsiblilty of something I was 10 I think and I loved proving to my mum that I could do it!|`|q4rG5Dwtaa	ok ignore all those judging people, I had my little girls ears pierced at 8 weeks old after her first set of shots.

I would wait until she is old enough to be responsible.|`|ccd9bacbf1ad616406e98ebf61adc6dcaa	I going to say, with all due respect, that I think it is best to wait until your daughter is old enough to make that decision herself. Personally, I was allergic to pretty much every kind of earring I put in my ears, and I ended up in the hospital because of an infection. I'm now 32 years old, and nobody ever notices that I don't wear earrings. My oldest daughter is 6 years old, and she has never once asked me to get her ears pierced. Once she's old enough to understand the risks and pain involved, and I can trust her to take care of them, then I'll let her do it. I also think that babies look cute regardless.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	I'll allow my daughter to pierce her ears when she's old enough to ask for it. We'll have a girls day and go out for ice cream after wards. She'll begin to take responsibility for them, and understand what it means to take care of something important. I don't think babies should have their ears pierced, there's just no way I could do it without my daughter being old enough to tell me she wants it and is ready for it.|`|dXVA1wHDaa	I have a boy, but if I had a girl I'd wait til she was old enough to ask.

I remember being in a store with my daughter when she was about 4 months. Another couple was having their baby daughter's ears pierced. That sweet little girl just screamed.<br>  <br>  While it's your decision, I don't know that the cuteness is worth that pain for a little baby. Perhaps you'll consider waiting until your daughter is older and letting her decide when she'd like it done.<br>  <br>  That's the approach we took with our daughter, and at 4 she still doesn't want to - yet, anyhow!<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|pDGVTLoFaa	Hi I had my first daughters ears pierced when she was nine weeks old and my other baby daughter when she was three weeks old in fact the younger the better because they do not fiddle with their ears at that age, mind you they are 28 and 25 now so I do not know if there have been any changes as to age requirements regarding babies and pierced ears.|`|RT3Og4Oiaa	Im sorry hun, this is why I e-mailed you my answer...because this is a Hot Debate topic. Why something so little stirs everyone up, I have no clue. Just don't let it get to you, everyone has their own feelings and options and sometimes what they say is hurtful and rude. In the end , its your baby!!! No One Else's!!! <br>  <br>  <br>  --This is why I don't ask about breast feeding, formula feeding, starting solids, circumcising, cio..or anything else like that anymore..I have learned that you will get some real nasty and uncalled for remarks...and its best just to ignore the bad and/or research it some other way.|`|J9pIrpkBaa	Are you joking??????<br>  <br>  Your little girl is a human being not a doll! Wait until she's old enough to decide if she wants to have them done!|`|eXsR8Gx5aa	around 12 (*years*)|`|6710b87650d29aedb9ee3b4272d6af96aa	When they are old enough to ask and no it doesn't look cute it looks cheap.|`|GVPhFa3Raa	I Wouldnt Get Them Peirced..

I have been having a few abdominal twinges and my nipples have been very sore, also I have had a weird period type pain in my lower back, not sure if all these symptoms are because I was increased to 100mg on my clomid this month or maybe its my month!! I have done a cheapy HPT and its negative.  <br>  <br>  Trouble is I also had a loop diathermy to my cervix last tuesday so the pains could be that :-(  and therefore cannot read anything into my CM.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck, hope you have a quick "2WW"!|`|Wd7ujHNhaa	Just started my 2ww today!!!

vVZLFPtRaa	Got Milk ....?|`|ccd9bacbf1ad616406e98ebf61adc6dcaa	I just wore a sports bra to sleep. It was more comfy, I could still wear it with nursing pads, and it was easy to lift when I needed to feed the baby. I also found that the wife-beater tank tops worked just as good, as long as they were tight enough to keep the nursing pads in place.|`|01vMpHkWaa	right now im not because my milk hasnt come in so im not leaking but once my milk is in i will wear one because i dont want to leak all over the bed so ill wear a bra and pads|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Your lamaze teacher should learn what she is and isn't qualified to discuss.<br>  <br>  Most actual experts recommend NOT wearing a bra in bed because it can increase the risks of plugged ducts.  Many studies actually show that wearing a bra during the day makes breasts saggier, which is why some people seem to think you "have to" wear one while nursing.<br>  <br>  With my first I did wear a bra as I was used to sleeping in a bra, with my second I no longer even wear a bra most of the day.<br>  <br>  Do whatever you find comfortable.|`|AA11476782	I don't think you *have* to, but if you tend to leak, that pressure can help suppress leakage.  Often when you nurse on one side, the other side also lets down, so having on a nursing bra could help prevent that causing a leak.  Nursing bras, to me, are way more comfortable than regular bras because they don't have underwire.|`|KmC0K59taa	I did.  I never wore one at night before.  I found that my breasts leaked milk at night so I wore a bra and nursing pads at all times.  If your baby goes without nursing for a few hours before you wake up, your breasts will be full and leaking in the morning!  I went through TONS of nursing pads.  When the baby is nursing on one side, the other will leak.|`|Ot8lxaMEaa	I didnt. I found that the last thing i wanted to do at 2AM was fumble with the straps. I usually slept topless with a towel undermyself for leaking. my son was eating so frequently the first few weeks that there just wasn't any point in wearing a shirt. But you might find that its mroe comfortable for you. Just go with what works best!|`|uxjmNfOcaa	Ugh! I know what you mean, but yes you definetly have to wear a nursing bra at night, too. Well, unless you want to wake up in the middle of the night soaked.lol. It is very uncomfortable, but you do get used to it after awhile. Just like breastfeeding itself, it is uncomfortable at first but after awhile you never even notice it anymore. Although, they really do have to do something for mothers who are breastfeeding after getting out of the shower. You get nice and clean, then turn the water off, next thing you know you have milk running down your body.lol. I kept a towel ready to guard me. Good Luck with your new baby and congratulations.|`|nnyowt2oaa	I don't because I don't have enough nursing bras, I need to save them for the days! It doesn't bother me to not wear one at night. If I leak in my pjs I just throw them in the laundry and wear a new pair that night. I love putting on fresh pjs anyway!|`|CeS9Pin7aa	I found it more comfortable to wear it all the time, including while sleeping.  Now that I have settled down in size and no longer leak overnight I often go without because it is comfortable with or without.|`|7a28d05280f8c452210cdbe730862692aa	i had to wear mine all the time because i was very leaky and kept soaking the bed! you can get some very comfy ones and the breast pads are very comfy too so it wasnt a problem to get to sleep.<br>  <br>  good luck x
C4miEeuYaa	My daughter was 2 or 3 weeks old when I took her to the pediatrician. At the time, she was strictly breastfed. As you might know, breastfed babies poop is VERY runny and bright yellow. Well I was changing her diaper on the exam chair. I lifted her legs up to get the diaper out from under her. (Her butt was facing me) Well all of a sudden, she let out this EXPLOSIVE poop that landed on the belly part of my shirt and was splattered down the front of my pants (all the way down to my ankles)...I was at the pediatricians office so I had to walk out in the lobby with bright yellow poop juice stains on myself...I WAS MORTIFIED! And to make matters worse-the nurse that was in there just looked at me, looked down at the floor, and said I'll let you be for a few minutes. Well then other nurses poked there head-which means she must have told them. I can laugh about it now, but jeez..<br>  <br>  And 1 more for ya~ my daughter is about to be eight months. She was in her walker yesterday and in the hallway, I caught her messing with the socket safety plug. I said,"Alyssa, no ma'am" And she looked at me, smiled, looked down, and rolled away from it. I thought it was cute. :) Your Cheetos, cat butt story is HILARIOUS by the way! Ha ha|`|nmu6coapaa	When I got showered in pee while changing my sons nappy and I laughed!|`|DDFSITiYaa	I am always reminded when I wipe my toddlers nose with my hand and then wipe it on my own pants, if I don't have a tissue.  <br>  <br>  My husband had a 'I'm a dad"moment.  A few weeks ago, the kids were acting up at dinner time, not minding manners and laughing way too much.  After several attempts to remind them of how to act, he finally exploded with a declaration of "HEY!  Dinnertime is NOT fun time!".    Even he and I broke up on that one.|`|5ci9IZd2aa	When my daughter was 2 I took her to my friends kids Birthday party, and there were dads there drinking beer, not a big deal. The next day I took my daughter with me to get some grocery's, as I was looking at the chips she was looking at the product behind me, and she yells out. "Mommy, it's the Beer!!!". I wanted to crawl in a hole. LOL|`|jLYTKr33aa	For starters, my son was sleeping through the night at two weeks old.  His pediatrician told me to let him sleep, as healthy babies will wake up on their own if they need something.  I, however, will admit that I didn't sleep through the night until he was about 18 months old.  I got so accustomed to getting up to check on him for fear of SIDS that it took me a long time to break the habit.  He's 4, and I still get up most nights to check on him.  <br>  I also don't even blink an eye when I get smeared with my son's bodily wastes now.  If the dog throws up on the floor, I'm completely grossed out.  When my son puked chocolate milk, chicken, broccoli, and yogurt all over my bed and accidentally blew the biggest snot rocket that I've ever seen into my hand (sorry for being graphic!) when he had the flu a few weeks ago, I didn't even flinch.  A strong constitution for the most disgusting matter known to man - a sign of a true mother!|`|nfzQkvqraa	I've had too many to count.  Your example reminded me of my most recent.  <br>  <br>  I was at Burger KIng with my 3 year old trying to eat peacefully.  He dropped a french fry on the ground.  He bent down to pick it up and I said "Don't eat it, it's yucky now."  I grabbed the fry from him and turned around to throw it away.  He still had a piece of it though and he shoved it in his mouth and said "Ha.  I'm eating it."  To which I replied "Well you're just going to get the germs from the floor."  His eyes got big and before I could do anything he spit the chewed up fry all over the floor.  "There."  he said, "I didn't eat it.  I spit it out like a good boy!"  Yeah all over the floor.  :)      Maybe you had to be there.|`|ajbMVt8maa	"do NOT stick that fork in your eye!!"<br>  wow... i never though i would have to say that<br>  lol :)

NbJbZXtGaa	Too early to trust a BFN IMO. Wait until day one of your missed period and test again. I know...it is SOOO hard to wait, but that's really all you can do.|`|xoQxDGAlaa	The symptoms could be both. I know it is so hard to wait and determine if it's all in your head or if this is how it had been every other month when you weren't TTC. Do your best to wait so you are not discouraged with all the BFNs. My BFP was at 11 DPO and the only reason I tested was because I had a temp dip on my chart at 10DPO and it went back up 11DPO. Lots of baby dust and luck to you.
QP46eVi4aa	well make sure they know what he is paying <br>  <br>  it will work and you will get insurance paying that much out <br>  <br>  also ask about famis it is for higher income people <br>  <br>  my sister is in the same boat and about the same situation and they got famis|`|ad0F70IMaa	I'm in Tx and if you don't qualify for medicaid then theres one step lower called the CHIP program. They ask for a co-pay, but something like $10.00 a doctors visit. Ask them if theres something like that available in your state.|`|JQcIwPXJaa	You should still be able to get medicaid because of the alimony your income is drastically decreased. I know it's a pain, but I would apply anyway. Also, check with your local hospitals. I know that some near me in FL have plans for women who need assistance. One by me will do your prenatal care and delivery for $1200! Just call around. Also, Birthing Centers always have "no woman turned away" policies that can help, but you won't get any drugs =) My birthing center has that plan and a lot of women take advantage of it. Best wishes!|`|3K7ffKn2aa	did you file for regular medicaid or pregnancy medicaid? you need to make sure to sign up for the right one, and i don't think you did. It doesn't ask you about everyone else in the house just yourself. Go back and before you get your paperwork tell the people at the window your pregnant. You should get approved in a few days. I know my family doesn't qualify for most state help but when i got pregnant i found out my insurance didn't cover it. so i signed up and got approved for LAmom (louisiana pregnancy medicaid covers me and the baby during pregnancy and then for 2 years after then drops). Just try again and make sure you get the right paper work. good luck|`|ddS7unC2aa	There are clinics where you can pay on a sliding scale. I went to one where I paid about 10% of every visit. It was usually between $30 and $88 each visit.  You can also check with your county hospital and see if they have any programs for uninsured patients. Usually it's there own type of insurance that you pay like $25 and $50 co-pays. I hope this helps.|`|35dae24ed321c4c235f68fe8d0aeca71aa	Are you sure you can't apply if that amount of money is going elsewhere? I would speak to a medicaid counselor to find out for sure if you haven't. I am so sorry if you can't get it. i don't know of any other medicaid or insurance.|`|ddP3klT3aa	You should be able to get medicaid when pregnant when you don't have ANY health insurance. From what I understand, they actually can't deny you if you don't have insurance.|`|7ZsvzIP7aa	Did you apply for regular medicaid or pregnancy medicaid? I'd contest the rejection and speak to a social worker at your local office. They should take into consideration what your husband's income is after the child support, etc. and take into consideration that you don't have insurance. If you appeal and speak to a social worker, I don't see any reason why you'd be denied temporary medicaid for pregnancy even if you aren't eligible for regular medicaid.|`|PvEEOdKBaa	Nope, your best bet is to move out and stay with parents to qualify.  You can also file with the courts that he is paying more than his share etc.  I do believe dhs deducts that out ahead of time though usually, I do not think it is counted in gross as long as he never holds it in his hand.  Try again and explain you have no way of paying for insurance
kDNoQaA2aa	I think it's "Federal Poverty Level" or something to that extent. And yes, that would be correct. You can check to see if you are eligible on your state's Department of Human Services website. It does depend on family size, but it can be a lifesaver if you have an incredibly high deductible or no insurance at all. A pregnant woman counts as two people, so if you are married with one child and you're also pregnant, your family size is 4.<br>  <br>  WIC is another good program that goes along with it, and every little bit helps, especially in this economy. Good luck!
Ke9gAvJTaa	I found yahoo answers a few months before my 4 year old son, Aaiden was born.<br>  I wish I had found it sooner too. I think everyone does.<br>  <br>  <br>  :)|`|T0gv52CDaa	I discovered YA well after my 2 1/2 year old was born, and well before getting pregnant with my 4 month old.  I had a random question about medication, and when I googled the question, the first link was to a similar question on YA.  After that, I spent so much time on the Religion & Spirituality and the Etiquette pages that I had been a top anwerer on those pages.  When I got pregnant again, I started going to the pregnancy page, and now I'm here on the newborn page.  I work at a school, so I'm also frequently on the Education pages also.|`|CIZjK2rAaa	I started spotting at 6 weeks pregnant and I googled it to see if my baby would be okay.

85d880b4c510002b409163300b68601eaa	My best advice is to ask him. We are rearranging our house by necessity to make room for baby. My three almost four year old daughter is not happy that her playroom is being moved to another room on the main. If it wasn't something that I had to do I wouldn't.|`|2xS1Jro7aa	Talk to you son about it ask him if he wants to help paint and decorate his new big boy room! Make its lots of fun and make it a room that he will love and will love it for the next few years. You can put trucks and cars and so on, on the walls. Or what ever he is really into right now. They also have new paint that you can color on with chalk that is pretty cool. I think it would be a great idea to give the new room to your 2 year old just include him in it and he will be fine with it and make its tons and tons of fun and a big deal you could even have a big boy party with just you and your hubby with your son in his room. Order a pizza and get some of his fav foods after the room is done throw down a blanket and have a party in his big boy room. Get some fun night lights and stuff for him to so he wont be afraid. Good luck!!|`|r63DBSATaa	Make him excited for the new baby. "Honey! Your little brother/sister is in here. When he/she comes out shes going to sleep in your room so you can have the bigger room!"|`|SWbiblvPaa	Don't worry just move it and make it a game let him help you set up his new room and then help him fix up the baby's room|`|9BsyKN9haa	When I was expecting I was worried about my son. Here are some things I did. <br>  <br>  When picking out things for the baby I would ask his help. I also took him to walmart to pick out a present for his new sister. he got to give it to her when he first saw her. I aslo bought a little basket and put some diapers and wipes in it, after the baby came home I would call my helper and his basket when I need to change her, he loved it!( eventually he stopped loving it and i just let it go)  We made a big deal about him being a big brother. After the baby was born my family came to visit and they all brought him a little candy and congratulated him on being a big Brother. (HE LOVED THAT)<br>  <br>  After she was born every other week my son and I would go out just us two, Nobody else, we would go to a movie or the park and I would give him all of my attention, he also had the same thing with his dad.|`|rkSBHqtQaa	How old is your first born? If he's old enough to somewhat understand the concept of another baby, then I think he will be just fine if he moves into the spare bedroom. What I would do is take something from his old room that he loves and add it to his new room. That way it'll make the transition a bit easier. If you already have the nursery set up there's really no point in taking everything apart and moving it. I would say just concentrate on fixing the spare bedroom for your oldest and kind of let him choose things he wants to make it his own space. Hope it works and good luck with the transition and congrats on baby number 2.
DzPZ8EEkaa	Awwww....I just want to start by saying that your excitement for your baby just pours out in your words.  How precious is that!!!  It's nice to hear.<br>  <br>  I was a bit surprised yes, but just because they come out so well...smushed! hahahaha!  You don't realize just how much until you compare their newborn hospital pics to pictures taken just a week or so later.  The change is kind of amazing.<br>  <br>  Who says your "fretting about it."  Sounds to me like your blissfully daydreaming about your baby!  Good for you!|`|rC6gL7KOaa	Well I haven't had mine yet (I'm 24 weeks) but every time I picture my baby , I picture her as a toddler and not as an infant. When I think about the infant, she really doesn't have a "look" if you know what I mean. But the picture in my mind of her as a toddler is a cute dark skinned little girl with curly hair and dimples. Her father and I both have dark skin, curly hair, and dimples. I see her with her father's eyebrows and my smile. It will be very exciting to see how she's going to look.|`|z6IekuwSaa	I imagined her with dimples and a button nose, which she has both! I also could not picture My hubs and I havin a baby without a full head of dark hair, which she had a lot of when she was born. It was crazy though, while I pictured certain things she looked more beautiful than I could have ever imagined. Good Luck welcoming your little bundle soon!|`|113FoyMFaa	I imagined my second baby to look like my first.  they're both boys.  My first has brown hair, brown eyes, he's a tiny guy, and he's right handed.<br>  <br>  Man, was I wrong.  My second boy has blond hair, blue eyes, he's a big boy and he's left handed. lol.  and yes, same dad.<br>  <br>  it's amazing how it works.  my oldest got all dominant genes, and my youngest got all recessive.|`|UkQuMykiaa	I always wondered what my babies would like. I was actually surprised that they were so perfect and beautiful - that I could make something that was so amazing! I know that sounds weird that I was surprised, but it is just one of the many things you worry about as a parent to be :o)|`|x3fQP9viaa	All of the 3d ultrasounds are so real, I already knew what they baby looked like, but gender was a surprise.|`|LUjCnYmoaa	my wife and i were completely surprised with our little guy, we pictured him having blonde hair and blue eyes, since i have blue eyes and we both had blonde hair as babies. turns out he had brown hair and very very dark brown eyes like his moms, but his facial features are much like both of us, he has his moms noes and eye shape, but i have a weak jaw and an overbite, he has the same over bite, we both have big ears and hes got the same ears.<br>  Also he was a porker at birth and at one point during the pregnancy she measured under. he was 10lbs 11oz at birth. HUGE<br>  Even though shocked when born i is still the cutest baby ever we think.|`|aKiynqA6aa	my first one i never really thought about it too much that i remember, but he came out looking just like my side of the family, then my second one came out five years later and i swear they could have been identical twins lol.  now that they are 4 and 9, my oldest still takes after my side of the family, but the 4 y/o looks just like daddy; it's kind of strange how he's changed.  now we have a 3rd on the way and we don't know what it is either, but i picture it to look just like the other two did :-)<br>  ....hoping for a girl!!!|`|kQYqDbc5aa	My husband and I are both blonde haired [naturally] and blue eyed.  I have three daughters and they all have dark eyes and dark hair.  I have one boy on the way and I assume he will look more like the girls.  <br>  <br>  Congrats on the baby!  Good luck!|`|l79QIWszaa	My baby was just how I imagined...dark hair and eyes, dimples.  Just perfect!  If he'd looked different, that would have been how I imagined him, too!  Don't fret about what your baby might look like, he or she will be absolutely beautiful.|`|uxjmNfOcaa	Well, I couldn't really picture how my daughters face would look, but I did think that she would have my husbands blue eyes, my skin color, and would be bald. And after I had her she did have my husbands eyes and my skin color, but she was definetly not bald.lol. She had a dark mess of hair. Everyone was surprised at how much she had. They say that if you have a lot of heartburn during pregnancy then you will have a baby with hair, I don't know if that's true or not but I did have terrible heartburn. It is a very exciting feeling though wondering what your baby will look like. I even had the 4d ultrasound so I could see her; but, to my dismay, it really didn't help me see what she would look like. lol. Thank you and congratulations on your beautiful baby. Good luck with everything.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I had a 3D ultrasound (they just did it, I didn't ask for it) so I was surprised when my son didn't look like he was made out of clay.<br>  <br>  Joking aside, I thought he'd look a lot like his first cousin, and he does, though not that much as a newborn.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	I was surprised at how much she looked like her daddy from the start. As hard as I tried, I just couldn't imagine what she'd look like, when I finally saw her I was blown away at the resemblance between the two of them.|`|C4miEeuYaa	I compared her 3D ultrasounds with mine and my fiance's newborn pics. I thought she was going to look more like me..Well-I was wrong..LOL She looked JUST LIKE her daddy and older sisters newborn pics. She stayed looking more like him up until about 4 months..Then she started looking like me. Now she's the spitting image of my baby pictures! But it's funny, sometimes she looks like her maternal grandpa, then sometimes she'll look like her paternal nanna. Isn't that wierd??|`|dXVA1wHDaa	I was completely surprised.  Both me and my son's father have dark brown hair, my ex has brown eyes, I have blue eyes and was born with loads of jet black hair.  I expected a baby with lots of dark hair and dark eyes.<br>  <br>  Instead my son is a little blondie with my blue eyes.  He looks just like me except for the hair, and I love it! He's also a lot balder than I thought he'd be!<br>  <br>  It was a nice surprise :)|`|gJrHBtp1aa	I thought he was going to look just like his sister, who looks identical to me. nope, He doesn't look like either me or his dad. He looks like my MIL. Its scary how much he resembles her.|`|0viZhxi6aa	Well, he's a red head! Threw us for a loop!
4DdSB11qaa	Okay...Never jump to conclusions. Always ask what the problem is, if she is a good friend. When people are going through things, certain things may tick them off and you would never know it until they start acting funny..it may could have been something you said, commented on, or did...that she didn't like. So just ask her...make sure the time is right.. and not in front of a group of people.. One on One.|`|pXSKSS3daa	That's weird.<br>  <br>  It's up to you, though, do you want to continue to be friends with her? If so maybe you should try sitting down and talking this out with her. Maybe she doesn't realize how mean she's being towards you or maybe she has a reason(whatever it is).<br>  <br>  If you don't care about salvaging your friendship then I'd say forget about it. If she only wants to be a friend when it's convenient for her then she is no friend at all.|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	sounds like her idea of friendship is how much that you are useful to her. IF she is not bothered much by your cold shoulder then she is no friend at all and concerned only for herself and her family. Time to make a new friend and find a new carpool buddy that is a little more reliable. Though you can not expect that a carpool buddy be there every single day they dont need to be like that lady wow.... I think strangers would have been more concerned for you than your friend was. Thats sad its hard to lose people you liked but sometimes in life you have to just move on.<br>  <br>  I think just keep ignoring her and blowing off anything that has to do with her... no need to get nasty or burn your bridge at both ends with her since she may not realize shes a ******. She may change later and become a good friend again.|`|h0cIJ1hBaa	You don't have to tell her that you aren't going to talk to her anymore. Just don't call her anymore and treat her with the same lack of respect she has been treating you with. She will catch on.|`|3a1GMOmLaa	i say get new friends. she keeps treating you like crap because you keep putting up with it.|`|LY2LSzPJaa	sounds like a POS friend to me ,cut the ties trade her in !|`|f6R8VRTkaa	If you really like this friend, i would say try and speak to her again8maybe go for a Coffee) and talk.But if deep down you don't give a F**K about her any more.<br>  Just go your owe way and make new friends.<br>  Life is too short for so much bitching
xjRCdRnxaa	To be honest i would ignore her and actually tell her to grow up and stop being so selfish!!<br>  Thats pathetic! I get in some strange way her wanting the fuss - but how about sharing the experience with someone too instead, why cant she look at it like that!<br>  You go for it and best of luck! And enjoy your own moment and ignore her if she really has to behave so selfishly!<br>  Good luck!|`|eTTkAv9Yaa	Do what is right for you, if you were planning to before then why stop now?  If you are trying to steal her thunder and haven't stopped to look at what you are doing then postpone for a year.|`|0VHolTVEaa	Sorry but your sister in law sounds like a jealous cow. If you and your husband are ready go for it, she cant stop you. She has no right to stop you so do whats best for u. Good luck|`|V8JoRHnnaa	yes do what u want to and stop thinking|`|eTx3Nfd7aa	yes of course don't let her ruin your special time your husband had already informed her that you were going to try so it should not come as a great shock and if she don't like it tough you have as much right to have a child when you choose as she does.don't ever worry about what people think you do what makes you happy.go for it and good luck.|`|5KcUyLFRaa	Whats the other option? Terminating a baby you want and already love because your sister in law is a total *@!(%￡ ? No way, if you and your partner want this child, have it for yourself. If she gets stroppy about it shes the one who comes out of it looking bad, not you.|`|vKlMdtpaaa	if you want a baby hun and the time feels right then the hell with everyone else. its about you and your partner.<br>  <br>  you have the right to bring a child into the world the same as everyone else. dont listen to what she says, she might be just saying that, you dont know!<br>  <br>  just go for it...in fact close your pc, grab your partner and start the process off now!...well what you waiting for???|`|ezT7xruoaa	Yeah, who cares what she thinks! Don't even mention the fact that its at the same time again, and let her mention it first. When she does, just act surprised and go, oh really? I hadn't noticed! like she is the petty one for even noticing, and also for making a big deal out of it.|`|zATQaiwIaa	my god - are you serious?  Your SIL needs to get over herself, if you and your husband are ready do what you want - plus it will be great for the kids to be so close in age.|`|GxJL9UjVaa	Yes... if shes going to throw school yard tantrums then that's up to her but don't let it dictate your life. <br>  <br>  If you want another baby, don't let anyone put you off, its complete selfishness on her behalf|`|373b04f6dbf649a6ef357e85b32df3e4aa	Ignore her! She is being childish! It's your life and I wish you luck in getting pregnant xxx|`|b0ff0526fe90638f8e2ac0fea7c1171caa	Yes its your life. I would start trying now.|`|Zdvx8uBcaa	Don't let anyone else determine what you want to do with your life, if you want another bundle of joy, go for it!|`|z6IekuwSaa	Hey, you gave her fair warning. Go for it! Plus it's good for the LOs to have someone their age when they get older|`|xcxMB4Rlaa	Go right ahead! Who does she think she is getting upset at you for expanding your family at the same time as she is?  She should be glad your kids will be around the same age and get to grow up together.  So enjoy your baby dancing and when you get pregnant be happy and proud.  Don't worry about what she thinks.|`|1GxMGmkqaa	dont ignore her. just dont buy itno her insecurities and get on with your life plans. <br>  no one can dictate to you whn you should or shouldnt plan your family. it is your personal choice and she doesnt live your life. her 'thunder' is her own storm taht she will hav to deal with herself. you jsut get on with your life and keep loving. let her know taht whatever happens for her you are happy for her. and that maybe you both ougth to feel blessed that your babies wil grow up together as cousins and will probably be close friends. that really is a blesisng for both of you. <br>  its called 'double the joy'!
c73QkZ2haa	If you use it regularly the cheaper ones dont last that long and they tend to be for shorter people for some odd reason i was always hunched over. I went through about 5 of them with my oldest daughter. Spending a little extra on a lightweight stroller is worth it rather than buying numerous ones. Its the old adage. "You get what you pay for." My sister got one like this <a href="http://wize.com/strollers/p162065-chicco-c6-key-lime#t=14830" rel="nofollow">http://wize.com/strollers/p162065-chicco...</a>   isnt the same one she got but it went thru 2 kids and it was still in great condition.<br>  <br>  ETA: im 5'4. They are like kid short the cheap ones. And my husb is 6'5 he couldnt even use it...lol well he could was just comical. Most of them are good for up to 40lbs.|`|ZSSUfSXwaa	I have an umbrella stroller for my little girl and it's quite light and they're pretty much the same. Mind you they are for older babies who are able to sit up so 6+ -dont know how old your baby is- In any case they're great for travelling, airports and stuff is great. You fold it in one min and you're done! Plus it fits into all the stores at the mall LOL<br>  They're usually OK.. as for the price Im sure you can get it there or at Walmart for that price.|`|RT3Og4Oiaa	I have that one in pink...I also got it with a 15% off coupon that they give out. Its a nice lil stroller , moves around nicely. Not heavy at all. My LO seems to enjoy it. <br>  They also have some at walmart, not as cute, regular patterns ...for 13-15 bucks. But I like the Babies R Us ones better..more stylish lol.<br>  <br>  --Yea I am 5'10 and I did complain a bit that the handles need to be adjustable.lol. <br>  --Also my LO is 20 lbs , so I dont think it will last long, but it was a easy solution untill I can afford the double stroller in May. (baby #2)
Y6FVYy6Waa	First of all, if the sample was not enough, the nurse would have told you and asked you to provide another...so no worries about that.<br>  Secondly, don't just assume that you are the reason why you and your wife can't conceive... and six months is not enough time to be trying to start worrying about it. The more you worry, the more difficult it gets to conceive.<br>  Even if it turns out that your analysis turns out to be deficient, there is nothing "emasculating" about it... would you believe that your wife is not "female enough" if something (God forbid) turns out to be wrong with her?<br>  Don't put yourself down like this and lets hope all turns out to be ok... if not, then you and your wife will deal with it and things will turn out to be for the better in the long run.<br>  Good luck to you.|`|V8JoRHnnaa	it is treatable. talk tour doctor, they'll prescribe some med, eg zinc, vitamins etc etc|`|60a3bbdca78e74fb19db426e27b9a087aa	First of all I think you should not be so hard on yourself. You and your wife are trying for a baby and that is a wonderful, albeit difficult, thing.<br>  <br>  I don't know how to say this without sounding rude, but why is it "better" if she is the one with the "problem"? Trying to conceive takes 2 and you are both involved. There are ways to assist if you do have low sperm count.<br>  <br>  My friend and her husband, both 40 years old, both had problems. He had low sperm count. She had 1 ovary, blocked fallopian tubes, and some kind of reaction to his sperm that caused the little he did have to die. They tried for 2 years. They went through 3 rounds of invitro.<br>  <br>  She finally conceived and at 30 weeks she went into pre-term labor because her uterus was too small to allow more growth. She was kept in the hospital on steroids and magnesium to keep the baby from being born for 4 weeks. At 34 weeks the baby was born via cesarean at 4.5 pounds. They sent the 3 of them home the next day!!!!<br>  <br>  The baby is now a healthy 3 month old and both parents are beyond thrilled!!<br>  <br>  So!! It might be an uphill battle. It might be nightmarish at times. But if you have an issue that is adding to the difficulties, take it stride and look for solutions. Getting down on yourself this early is not going to have any positive effect, only negative.<br>  <br>  And try to remember that she would feel just as bad if all the "fault" rested on her. You are partners. Be a team and be loving to each other and yourself.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|q2P7OMZCaa	a man does not ejaculate huge amounts. it should be about a teaspoon. do not compare yourself to adult movies. Its not real.
Rhr1umV1aa	Prenatal vitamins cause constipation. My doctor recommends taking colace which is a stool softener. If that does not work than you can try magnesium citrate. They dont "make" you go, they just make it softer. As far as for the hemorrhoids, if they are bothering you or itch or burn you can get some witch hazel pads, or tucks pads. After everytime you go to the bathroom use them or whenever you itch or burn. They are also great for stitches after the delivery of your new baby. Hope this helps.|`|4jW9rERFaa	I hate hemorrhoids. If the bleeding is coming from your rear thats exactly what it is. There is not much you can do to prevent it. It started for me at like 3 months along. So annoying and sometimes it hurts sooo bad! I got a list when I first found out I was pregnant which shows are the safer medications you can take while pregnant. For constipation it says, increase the amount of fiber you take in and increase fluids. Medicines you can take are Metamucil, Citrucel, Perdiem, Milk of Magnesia, Senokot, Fibercon, and Colace.|`|AA10953561	It sounds like you do have hemorrhoids. My best advice is fruit, fruit, fuit! Drink fruit juices (apple juice, prune juice, and cranberry cocktail juices have worked best for me). Eat a lot of fruit (fresh is better than canned, but if you do get canned, try to get it without too much sugar).<br>  <br>  Lots of water should help, too. If you live in a pretty dry climate they suggest between 10-12 8oz glasses of water a day. I don't come anywhere close to that, but I still drink a lot of water. I've only been really constipated a few times this pregnancy. I'll have a day or two where I don't have any sort of bowel movement, but I still consider that pretty regular. It's when you have three or more days without one that you should try taking action.<br>  <br>  As for the hemorrhoids and bleeding there isn't much you can do about it. If you have a lot of itching you might try one of those hemorrhoid creams. Try not to force the bowel movement, that'll make the bleeding worse. I know that's hard to do when you feel so backed up, but try.<br>  <br>  Good luck, hon!|`|eU5Eth2aaa	The bleeding is probably caused from anal fissures.  These are small tears that occur when trying to pass hardened stool. (normally caused by constipation)<br>  <br>  The best thing to do would be to increase your fluid intake and really beef up the fiber in your diet.  You can try adding Metimucil to your water or fruit juices or you could even try to sprinkle some Flax seed on your food.  Also try to avoid white wheat products.<br>  <br>  Until you get your diet regulated, you can try Colace as a stool softener.  My doctor said it was totally fine, but you may want to double check with your doc just to be safe!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|7SKVCPcSaa	call your doctor and ask if there is any laxative or stool softener you can take. usually they will suggest something.<br>  <br>  and also talk to them about the blood. sometimes thats normal after being constipated for so long, but just make sure. but it could most definitely be due to hemorrhoids.|`|ZadTQtJaaa	Yeah it's hemorrhoids.  You can increase your fiber in your diet and drinks lots of water.  None of those worked for me when I was pregnant. I had to take a stool softener.  Things do eventually get back to normal after you have the baby.|`|vZwJyqc6aa	Not sure about the blood but I have started having issues with that as well. I started drinking Sunsweet Plumsmart juice. One 8oz. glass a day and it does the trick for me. Good luck!|`|lRq81lu7aa	Yes, you could be right that it is hemorrhoids, but check with your doctor just to be on the safe side.<br>  <br>  What you can eat is anything with whole grains(bread, English muffins)<br>  whole grain foods that have lots of fiber.  Also try Benefiber, it is a powder that dissolves really well in any beverage you drink.  Its odorless and tasteless.  This gives you the extra fiber if you don't like whole grain foods or don't think you are getting enough.  This will help with constipation.  I use it all the time and things are running smooth now ;)<br>  <br>  Check with your doctor about the constipation and the Benefiber just to make sure it is what they would recommend to do.<br>  <br>  Constipation is a bummer, it takes the glow out of pregnancy sometimes, but its worth it in the end.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|dAgtW3G0aa	Yup you probably have the dreaded hemorrhoids but you should still have it checked by a doctor, he'll probably be able to tell just from your description of when and how the bleeding happens if its piles/hemorrhoids or something that needs a physical exam (not nice but anal bleeding needs to be investigated seriously!). Anyhoo, you need to increase your fibre intake, cereals like weetabix are a good start and nice jacket potatoes with baked beans, the most common cause of constipation in pregnancy though is dehydration, you need extra fluid intake for your body to cope so make sure you're drinking at least 2 litres of good fluids - water and juices , not bad fluids like Coffee, Tea, Colas and other carbonated drinks which act as diorettics that make  you pee more therefore make your body loose even more fluids.|`|AA10972821	I never had issues with constipation during pregnancy- I think this is because I am lactose intolerant and actually ate a lot of ice cream throughout pregnancy (which kind of balanced everything out to "normal").  Anything that would normally make you go, eat it and it should help!! For hemorrhoids, try the Tucks medicated pads (SO great, even after you deliver!!).|`|EmhBDHMtaa	I know exactly what you mean...i had really bloody poo i started eating LOTS of fruits and apple sauce...im now 23weeks...im still constipated but i don't know what to take for it so i just eat the fruits. i have little bowel movements but not like I'd like it to be...that sounds gross..but it seems to help out more than not eating them.|`|85d880b4c510002b409163300b68601eaa	I would guess hemorrhoids. You can use a stool softener such as colace. At your six week postpartum appointment ask you doctor about having any remaining hemorrhoids removed.<br>  <br>  Also you might want to avoid anything with really rough fiber like grape nuts and kashi.|`|NroZQN5vaa	You can drink a little prune juice. Just drink like half a cup everyday and it should help. If you drink too much of it, you can get intestinal cramps which are awful and I would not wish on anybody.|`|MYU46ap5aa	You need to drink a lot of water and eat a lot of fresh fruit and green leafy vegetables.  That should correct your problem.|`|kBwdaGY5aa	hemmroids and constipation are very common while pregnant, i'd just ask the doc at ur next appt. and see what he says|`|67bcfb21ec3e167fb35fde2a4e4e02d8aa	I am 31 weeks and have been having the same issue for a couple of weeks and actually had a hemorrhoid rupture.  When I went to my doctor I was advised that I should start taking a stool softener daily.  I would suggest speaking with your doctor to ensure that he is comfortable with you taking one as well.
SEzIkGNiaa	I got my braces about a year ago, in January.  It doesn't hurt putting them on, but alot of pressure is put on to your teeth, and it feels like they are going to break off!  lol, but they don't =]  It also hurts when they tighten the braces, which they do every month.  It hurts more on the second day and you will have to eat soft foods.<br>  <br>  The rubber bands that go on each track?  The orthodontist does that.  If you mean the elastics to pull your upper jaw back, its not hard at all.  It take practise, and eventually you can do it without a mirror.  <br>  <br>  My favourite Colors are purple, pink and blue!

My sister was sooo scared before she got them because of all the stories you hear about how bad they hurt. She said it's all a lie it doesn't hurt at all it's nothing painful you just feel a little different but there is no pain in getting braces put on<br>  <br>  my brother said it hurts when they tighten them that's about it and that no it's not hard to put on rubber bands<br>  <br>  god luck sweetie hope that helps! calm down a little it's not as bad as you imagine it|`|9zwSclnLaa	You probably won't have to wear rubberbands the first time you get them, and if you mean the little ones around the brackets then the orthodontist puts those on for you.  Just look at the selection they have [they will let you check it out before they ask] and choose the 1 or 2 or 3 [if they let you] colors that look the prettiest.<br>  <br>  Take some ibuprofen right now, so it can kick in once you get there.  That will cut down on the pain after they are done.  It isn't an intense pain though, so don't worry.  It might ache up to a week after they are on but that is just your teeth getting used to them.<br>  <br>  Honestly, I could go on and on but your orthodontist should resolve all your fears before or after she puts them on.  Mine held a tiny meeting with my mom and I, telling me how to care for them, gave me a packet on what to do in emergencies, etc.|`|KSfK4qR1aa	my braces are coming off in 4 weeks and im 17, if u think youv got it bad try goin into bars and talking to girls with a metal mouth XD<br>  <br>  dont get clear, makes it look like your teeth are brace shaped.<br>  <br>  yellow looks like plaque<br>  <br>  red looks like blood<br>  <br>  green looks like mould<br>  <br>  black looks like rot<br>  <br>  blue and pink are good colours because people know there only braces, if you get white they get stained by food.<br>  <br>  the rubber bands are very easy to take on and off and 3 week sdown the line you wont even feel strange with them.<br>  <br>  good luck =D|`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	i got blue the first time, when i got them put on. the bands aren't that hard to put on, but word of advice don't get red or white because those are the colors that most blend with food|`|WVGO903Yaa	Everyone is telling you that it doesn't hurt.

dAgtW3G0aa	I'm due on saturday and baby is still not engaged and this is my 7th so I know from experience that babies dont always engage and sometimes they dont even drop till you're in labour.  But when it happens you will notice a drop in your bump and pressure in the pelvis and more frequent trips to the loo and baby will be less able to move but you should still get your 10 movements in 12 hours...and on a good note you no longer have that bump sitting right under your ribs and squishing your stomach which can cause sickness and breathlessness in the later weeks.  Good luck x<br>  <br>  Yes the doctor will definitely be able to tell from external palpation! they measure it in 5ths, like they may say to you he/she is 2/5ths engaged. fully engaged would be 5/5ths obviously!|`|eNNPe3ycaa	Lots of lower back, pelvic, crotch pressure.  More frequent trips to the bathroom, my stomach even appeared to be sitting lower, etc.|`|AA11129622	i have period like pains for a few days.  i was told to call the doc - and just did, they said these pains are baby engaging :) <br>  im 36 weeks x|`|FgAPXhVRaa	I was going to ask the same question!! My little girl sits so low anyway, I don't know if I am physically going to be able to tell a difference. I already have back and pelvic pain. I mean my little one sits so low that when I went to find out whether she was a boy or girl the first time, she was so low that they could not tell. Although he says she is not engaged, she just sits low. I will be interested to see if I will be able to actually feel the difference!|`|EcQeNu3raa	Pelvic pressure, some back pain, and more trips to the bathroom.<br>  <br>  Edit: Yes, your doc can tell by an external exam.
pXSKSS3daa	I wouldn't worry about it until after 8 months. Solids at this age(6 months) are still just for practice.<br>  <br>  My son is 11 months and usually doesn't have three meals/day. He has breakfast and dinner but will only occasionally have lunch.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Only recently - he's 8.5 months old.  And with all the self-feeding we're doing, meals take a really, really long time these days, so it's not every day that he gets three.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Normally I start 3 meals a day around 18 months as that is about when my son was interested.  My second is 16 months and still only has 1-2 meals per day. <br>  <br>  Just follow their lead, they know what they need.  Most toddlers aren't that hungry after about 3-4 pm though<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/solids/solids-how.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/solids...</a><br>  7 - 9 months   Watch baby's cues - this is particularly easy if baby nurses beforehand and most/all of the solids are offered to baby to self-feed. Increase solids gradually if baby is interested, with a maximum of 2 meals per day.<br>  <br>  9 - 12 months  Watch baby's cues - this is particularly easy if baby nurses beforehand and most/all of the solids are offered to baby to self-feed. Increase solids gradually if baby is interested. Aim for baby getting no more than 25% of her calories from solids by the age of 12 months (some babies eat less than this at 12 months and that's also normal).|`|vue9NOhYaa	I started when she was eating table foods, and ate meals at the table with the rest of the family.  Around 9 months, IIRC.<br>  <br>  There is no rush. Her formula intake is fairly low, so you don't want to decrease it further by filling her up with solids.   She should be fine with 1-2 small meals of solids for another 2-3 months, maybe longer.|`|NroZQN5vaa	We started our daughter on three meals a day at about 6 months. We started cereal at 4 so by 6 she was ready to eat three meals. It also cut down on the formula that she was drinking which was nice because buying the fruits and vegetables is a lot cheaper than buying formula.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	My daughter is seven months and I'll only occasionally offer her three meals a day, but we allow her to feed herself so she only eats what she wants. Most of the time, she's only interested in food once or twice.|`|hbjbm3SRaa	My son is a year old and I still do breakfast, morning bottle, lunch, dinner, and then another nightime bottle. I still haven't gotten him off that bottle but now that he can start having whole milk I think he'll start getting used to the meals 3 times a day.
A1S5KNUkaa	Whether you show or not is anyones guess I'm afraid as all women are different.  I'm pregnant with number 3 and I started showing VERY early on...I'm now 23 weeks pregnant and it looks like I have a basketball stuck under my top lol.  Bearing in mind I was a size 6-8 to begin with so I don't know if this makes a difference.<br>  <br>  Would you be able to have your dress altered nearer the time if you are pregnant to allow some extra room?<br>  <br>  Hope you get the result you want x|`|4jW9rERFaa	At 23 weeks you could be showing. At 40 weeks with both of my children I looked 4 months along at the most, it was almost exactly the same with the both of them. I am 22 weeks right now and everyone asks me if I am sure I am pregnant because I dont look like it at all. But everyone is different. If you didn't show much with the first two, the 3rd may show a little less than the first two. But your wedding dress should definitely fit if there is a little room in there now. I would ask a doc before wearing spanx however just in case because you don't want to compress the baby who by twenty three weeks in definitely kicking away in there.|`|v3LnJycKaa	I am sure if you bought it from a good place they will let it out a little depending onyour size at the wedding, i believe the last fitting is generally the week before you wedding. I am on my third and started to show aroun 23 weeks which was a shock for me because i didnt show with either of my other 2 until i was 26+ weeks, but it is still just a lil itty bitty pouch i have now...|`|sgMno1PRaa	Thats my due date :)<br>  Well im thinking that your dress most prob wont fit, because they say that you show more and more with each child, do you remember what you were like at almost 6 months in your last pregnancies?<br>  If its got a lace up at the back couldnt you just not tie it up as tight? It depends on how much your bump has come out. <br>  Good Luck ! x|`|vZwJyqc6aa	I doubt you would be able to fit in it. Can you move the wedding up?|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	u might be able too goo dluck|`|adQQylCgaa	It depends on how soon you show, I guess.  With #1 I didn't need maternity clothes until 26 weeks and you could barely tell I was pregnant even then.  I am 20 weeks with #2 and I am VERY pregnant looking.  If you are going to be 23 weeks with a 3rd child I would say that you might be too big, but you could always try!  Good luck..I hope it fits!|`|4p9sBdyTaa	Probably not, you will most likely show really quickly now that you are on your third.|`|GxJL9UjVaa	I doubt you would get into it at that stage. The dressmaker should be able to alter it for you|`|CeS9Pin7aa	I would be prepared to have it altered.  I got pregnant when I was going to be matron of honour at my girlfriends wedding, and since we already had the bridesmaid dresses I had to have it basically taken apart and put back together with a new panel that would accomodate my belly - I was further along so you hopefully wouldn't have to go to that extent.  <br>  <br>  My girlfriend was 3 months pregnant at her wedding and her dress fit but she noticed it being tighter....so you would likely fall somewhere between those two situations!  <br>  <br>  Good luck, and congratulations if you are expecting!|`|sL04zmMkaa	i am in my 10th week of pregnancy. I will be getting married one month from today and while a size 12 was fine, i opted to go with a size 14 with a laced back to give me a little more room, also, ballet slippers felt right too.<br>  i have been advised to eat healthy, try not to give in too much to the cravings that can add on the extra weight. a girlde or the spanks as you say, may help on that day but only wear them then.
wy9rgMGsaa	Personal preference...I would want to be able to give that time to my 5 month old and spread them out some...but a lot of people want their kids close in age, so they wil be close growing up...its really what you think you all can handle...are you struggling with the 5 month old?? could you handle double that work right now?? Different with everyone|`|sDA98hocaa	There are a variety of factors that will go into the decision to try to conceive again after your baby’s birth.  These factors fall into three categories.  First, you need to be aware of when your body is able to conceive again.  Second, you need to think about when you will be able to have sex again to try to conceive.  Finally, you need to consider the implications of how much space will be between each of your children.<br>  <br>  How soon you are physically able to conceive can vary from one woman to the next.  If you are not breastfeeding, it is technically possible to be fertile within just a couple of weeks after giving birth.  Generally speaking, however, it takes several months to become fertile again.  Even if you are not breastfeeding, the timing of the return to being fertile will vary greatly from one woman to the next, and it will also depend greatly on the nursing pattern of your infant.  In addition, your body’s sensitivity to the hormones that respond to lactation will determine whether you are going to become fertile sooner.<br>  <br>  For most women, the menstrual period will take around 14 months to return to normal.  When a woman’s cycle returns before this, she will often still not be ovulating yet;  mom’s whose cycle returns after this have probably already started ovulating even without the return of their period.  Whether or not you are breastfeeding, it is important to be aware that you may become pregnant soon after giving birth.  If you don’t want to become pregnant again right away, it is recommended that you practice some form of birth control pretty much right away after giving birth.<br>  <br>  Next, you need to make sure you’re waiting long enough after birth to have sex.  While advice will vary from one health care provider to the next, most health care providers recommend that you abstain from sex until after your six-week postnatal checkup.  There are a variety of reasons for the wait.<br>  <br>  During delivery, your uterus and your cervix go through tremendous changes.  Accordingly, they need time to heal. Specifically, the lining of the uterus may be particularly prone to infection during this time.  Not just sex but douching, the use of tampons, or the placement of anything in the vagina can introduce bacteria and cause a uterine infection.  Lochia, the material that flows from your uterus after delivery, is a sign that your uterus is healing.  When the flow of Lochia is not red in color any longer, it indicates that the uterus is nearly healed.  This can take anywhere from three to eight weeks for most women.<br>  <br>  A variety of things can happen during delivery that can also affect the safety of having sex after delivery.  If you have an episiotomy, for example, it may require stitches.  Having sex could reopen the tear and pull out the stitches.  The same danger can occur if you have a vaginal or rectal tear or laceration, as well.  In addition, many women find that they have a reduced sex drive after delivery.  Some women complain of pain during intercourse, even long after delivery.  More common is the fear of pain that a woman may have after delivery.  The use of lubricants and the woman-on-top positioning may make a woman more comfortable, and allow her to take more care with areas that may still be sensitive.<br>  <br>  Finally, you need to consider the spacing of your children.  If you conceive within the first few months after giving birth, it is likely that you will have more than one child in diapers, more than one child who needs daycare, and a variety of other issues.  You may even think far ahead, such as how you will be able to save for college for your children if they are spaced very close together.  Talking with other parents and parenting experts can help you to think through these implications, as well.|`|ae12c1d8c1c47a1b878b6100f2dccc4eaa	Honestly, it's really your personal opinion.  But, as far as health concerns go and letting your body rehabilitate after being pregnant so recently - I would wait until your 5 month old is atleast a year.  Your body just went through a very traumatic experience and needs to adjust to not being pregnant again.  Getting pregnant now can cause non stop "leaks" when you pee because you'll have no bladder control.  After having a baby you have to retrain your entire body to remember the purpose it serves.  Make sure you're doing keggles everyday to strengthen your bladder control.  Don't forget that if you get pregnant now, are you really going to want to carry an infant when you start showing?  Your body is going to be spent and you aren't going to have much energy.  These are just my "facts of life."  You both need to make the right decision and nobody else can tell you otherwise.|`|NE96fU9vaa	usually, if you want lots of kids, you space them 1-2 years apart, 1 year is harder to have several very small children all at once, 2 years is easier. also, if you want them 2 years apart, start trying about the last childs 1st biirthday, 1 year apart, try as soon as your doc says you can have sex after baby is born, but i wouldnt recomend it., mine were 2 and 3 years apart, i have 3 sons, my husbands siblings were less than a year apart.|`|1VdgsZPoaa	You are supposed to wait up to 3 years for your body to FULLY heal before each pregnancy but there are woman who get pregnant within 4 weeks of having a baby and their body does fine.  If you doctor says go ahead and you have the money, love, and time to raise this child then I see nothing against it.<br>  <br>  Besides, it might take you (I am hoping not) but 6 months to a year or longer to get pregnant and if you start now then you can keep them closer in age.|`|wTYh7DiSaa	This pregnancy is actually 5 months after my last born lol. My son is 14 months old and I'm about to have my daughter in 10 days. We feel that we can handle it. Besides, my husband will be here and not deployed, so we thought this will be only time he will ever be around for a full pregnancy and maybe a year into our child's life without having to leave for Iraq. With my last pregnancy, he was gone for 15 months. We got pregnant during his R & R 3 months after he was deployed. So he never saw my pregnancy or our child until he was 3 months old.|`|pZ4VxGrtaa	I say go for it if you feel you're ready for two! My daughter is 10 months old & we have been trying for baby #2 since January. I think its great to have kids close in age, it makes them close in life in my opinion. :) Good luck!|`|AA11129622	im still making baby number 1 :)<br>  but i already know i will wait until baby reaches 18months before we try for our next one.<br>  thats because i had horrible morning sickness, and terrible back pain.  i doubt i would be able to cope with a young toddler and be pregnant too :)|`|PvEEOdKBaa	I got pregnant with a 3 month old and they are within a couple days of a year apart.  They are like twins and the younger one has sped up in development to be like his older brother to some degree.  I am happy with my choice.|`|WwUimUUvaa	What I think is to probably as a professional, your GP could be a place to start. <br>  <br>  I think it's possible, but you have to look at many factors (emotional, financial, physical.)|`|fsY8PL66aa	I think is too soon, you should at least wait a whole year and enjoy your first baby.|`|zYBLzO9Naa	I say give it another year or two, give your body time to go back to normal. But hey, if you really are shooting for another baby. Go ahead! I support you. Good luck! :)|`|KGJHXvflaa	i think you should let your heal after you gave birth 5 months ago!!|`|wUrTB7DAaa	if you're not pregnant at the moment, you can become pregnant at any time. it doesn't matter when the last baby you had was.|`|MW1yrHbOaa	i would say yes, being pregnant and having to take care of a baby that little could be very stressful. Do you want 2 babies under 2, the oldest possibly not potty trained?  If it was me I  would wait at least a year.|`|OLW0Irbhaa	While lots of people do it, I personally think it's a good idea to give your body time to heal and replenish.|`|8j7FCEOraa	YES!<br>  My sister in law ended up having her kids too close together. They are a year apart, both born in may.<br>  <br>  It was hell.<br>  <br>  1. They are at different stags. Although they will BOTH need your undivided attention, they will need different size diapers, different food, they will have different sleeping schedules, different toys, there clothes will be different sizes, you'll need 2 different car seats.<br>  <br>  2. The older one will always try to get your attention. Even with my niece and nephew the younger one (not on purpose) would get ignored.<br>  <br>  3. The older child will baby the younger child. My niece is even having speech problems because everything is given and done for her by her older siblings. She hasnt hhasn't work for anything! Working for it = learning.<br>  <br>  4. Ages 1-3 is a tremendous growing time for these kids, one where you want to try and introduce them to as many things and concepts as possible. Even if they dont completely understand. You wont have any alone time with each of them. <br>  <br>  You can do it, but I wouldnt recommend it.|`|uuHPneEcaa	i think its too soon.. ur baby is only 5 months old u should get to know that one before trying to have another one.. Wait a year and then try for another one.. <br>  <br>  now its ur decision its totally up to u and ur husband.|`|6L4fCcyGaa	if you got the money, love and time.. id say go for it|`|acj9mB9Paa	I personally wouldn't.  Your body needs 18 months to go back to normal after giving birth.  I waited the 18 months and THEN got pregnant!  It also will be easier on you and the kids!|`|35dae24ed321c4c235f68fe8d0aeca71aa	I felt the same way when our son was about 5-6 months. You get the baby fever and are ready for more. Somehow we waited and now my son is 21 months. I would have to say it is much safer to wait. The only reason I say that is because my body and my hormones did not even seem to even out until after a year- at about a year and a half. I don't think my body could have taken the strain, but I did have a c-section so, that could be a difference. I'd try to wait at least a few months, but it may take you that long to get pregnant, anyways. We tried for almost a year before getting pregnant again.|`|AA11220327	my daughter was 5 months old when i got pregnant with my son. it has pros and cons. I had a very painful pregnancy with him, so taking care of her was difficult and i needed a lot of help. Now that they  are almost 4 and almost 5,  i get asked a lot if they are twins, and they are into the same kinds of things, and were both potty trained within 6 months, now it is much easier.|`|q1Swxe3qaa	If you guys are ready for double the baby, double the diapers, double the feedings, double the late night wakeups, then definately!!! If I could of gotten pregnant when my daughter was that young I would of honestly!! I would love for my children to be close in age.  Shes currently 19 months and we're trying for number two!|`|AA11661793	I personally wouldn't just so I have time alone with the first, but on the other hand by the time you had the baby if you get pregnant straight away you first child would be over 1. So ultimately if you feel you are ready go for it.|`|WqkOI7RDaa	Possible side effects include frustration, lack of funds, depression, aggravation, insanity, and a premature head of gray hair.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	yeah i would give it maybe about 5 more months. pregnancy is hard on the body give yourself a time to rest. If you wait a year then it also decreases the chances of miscarriage. Good luck|`|xpstigPTaa	I would give your body a little time to heal and then start trying again. I would say at least wait until the baby is 1 yr old. But it is totally up to you! Best of luck!!|`|yZkf3zFeaa	It's possible too, but not really wise. Your body needs to recover a little more, plus your 5 month old needs a lot of attention from the both of you right now. I would wait a bit.
kynzqmWgaa	Go on Maury.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	I'd be pretty upset too if the father of my baby was telling other people that the baby wasn't his.   I think you should get a paternity test done as soon as the baby is born just to prove it to him.  He's just causing you undue stress.  He is going to miss out on a big part of your baby's life with an attitude like that.  Tell him to man up, he's going to be a father soon.  Maybe he is getting scared.  Confront him and tell him that this behavior bothers you and you will get a paternity test to prove it to him so that he doesn't have any doubts.|`|7c0ff0cdc42bafa66ae7ea8350f673d9aa	theres no need for you to get upset.. all you have to do is to go to the hospital.. get all the 3 of you to be tested so that the baby genetically done by both of you...then you can get upset if it turns out he's not the father of the baby..|`|xp8pmKOuaa	You should talk to him.  If you haven't taken a test to find out if he really is the father, you should attempt to do this.  If you can't, you at least need to confront him.  I would suggest not being too upfront or yelling at him, but making sure that you two can sit down and talk it out.  Tell him how you feel, if you feel like you need something from him, that you are worried that he isn't going to take any responsibility for your child...whatever you are feeling.  And allow him to get out his feelings, but make sure that it is done in a mature and confidential manner.  You two must have had some closeness and felt strongly for each other at one point and you need to remember that when you are talking to each other.  Again, making sure that you both have the facts is always a good thing (aka a DNA test), but getting out your sentiments and feelings is one of the first steps to a solution here.  He should be talking to you, not your friends, and vice versa.|`|XGp3oF5baa	I would tell him if he wants a DNA test then you will be more than happy to do that. If he says no than he just doesn't want to take the responsibility of raising a child, and there isn't much you can do about that but talk and if that doesn't work take him to court and make him pay child support.|`|BtxQogSzaa	If my babies father said he didn't know if he was the father or not, i wouldn't give him the privaledge of letting him be the father. If he wants a DNA test say yeah sure, go ahead but dont expect there to be a relationship between us. As long as he is a REAL father to your child this is all that matters.|`|1YcBkx9Taa	JEREMY KYLE and if your in america SOME RANDOM DAY TIME TV SHOW?!!?!?1/1/1?!?!!
aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	When I think of children and bedtime, I think of:<br>  <br>  teddy bears, doll babies, blankets, lullabies, bedtime stories, prayers, goodnight hugs/kisses, sweet dreams and of course owls, which you mentioned (love them, hence my name and decision to work with them).<br>  <br>  If I go beyond the fairy tale thoughts, I think of the baby sleeping and me being afraid the older children are going to wake her up, the older chldren complaining it is too early to go to bed, making sure everyone has their bath and has brushed their teeth, etc.<br>  <br>  And, I associate my children sleeping with MY down time.|`|hbjbm3SRaa	Not completely sure what you're asking I guess you're trying to help your child learn the difference between nightime and daytime. What I do is make sure every evening I give my son a bath and while he's sleeping at night I make sure the room is completely dark that helps him understand the difference between night and day. If you're just asking what kids might think about at nightime I really am not sure because my son's only a year old so he hasn't associated anything with nightime yet except for the darkness.|`|M5jF5w5Taa	Sheep, for counting. <br>  <br>  'Goodnight Moon' by Margaret Wise Brown<br>  <br>  Footie pajamas<br>  <br>  The little raccoon from 'The Kissing Hand' (he's nocturnal)

zwJbUbWMaa	Parent's Choice worked great on my son but I have heard that it is very different for boys and girls, and also different for each child just based on their shape and build.  I had waaay less leaks from Parent's Choice than I did from Huggies.  He was leaking out of the Huggies all the time.  The Pampers were great but pricey.|`|xcxMB4Rlaa	I used Huggies when my son was a few weeks old.  They leaked every time he pooped.  I also used Pampers Swaddlers.  They barely ever leaked.  Then we used Pampers Cruisers.  They'd leak occasionally, like when he had an explosive poop or after long hours in the diaper like overnight.  I felt like we were wasting money since Parents Choice is so much less expensive.  I figured they'd be okay because my 3 nieces used them with no problem.  So I tried them out.  They barely ever leak.  I love them.  The only time they leak is when we have an explosive poop or he's in it for a long time, just like with the Cruisers.  I haven't found them to be too rough on my son at all.  But they are slightly bulkier than the Cruisers.  I recommend them.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	i didn't like them. we had leaks and blow outs galore with them. same with white cloud. after he stared moving more white cloud was a no go. <br>  <br>  we love luvs and huggies. pampers worked well too. (got them as a shower gift..so we used those first.)|`|mc6YtaRbaa	Since I obviously can't speak from experience I can tell you what I've heard. I heard that you can use "cheaper" diapers during the day when the baby's awake, but if you put him/her down for a nap or to bed at night that you should use Huggies or Pampers for that time. My husband says we have to get all the same brand diapers. I told him I'll buy whatever I have a coupon for but he thinks you can only get one kind!|`|Ezkn5azdaa	I wouldn't use them. But it really up to you. Yeah they do leak and they don't hold whole lot of pee has well. My second son had major rash that I had to rush him to the ER the night before Thanksgiving. They told me he having a allergic reaction to it. My baby girl start to have a rash with that so I don't use them on it. White Cloud works really good and I had no problem with them and they are cheaper then Huggies and pampers.|`|da0bd1389f2c6ba2fe645d6d1c4be705aa	there not "cheap" my sister and brother wore them and there great!|`|OBU1eDUHaa	If you are referring to the Walmart name brand, they have NOT worked for either of my children, boy and girl.  Both have leaked out pee and poop on almost a daily basis.  I had the same argument with my husband.  I finally convinced him that we were spending more money doing more laundry washing since I had to wash 2-3 outfits per kid per day.  He finally understood when he had to do the wash one weekend when I was sick.  Just cut corners some where else.|`|0viZhxi6aa	In my experience they are not as good as pampers, which I love, but don't buy. I actually use luvs which are a lot less money and yet don't leak. Huggies never worked for my son. Even the preemie size was horrible! We used pampers swaddlers while he was in preemie and newborn sizes, then switched to luvs when he hit size one. Now he's in size two and they still work great.|`|dgRTkccBaa	I've used them from time to time when money was a little low and they're ok.  They don't have the stretchy sides, but other than that they're fine.   They never leaked worse than any other diapers on my kids.<br>  EDIT: The best generic diapers I have used (and believe me, I've tried them all) were the Mom to Mom Diapers they sell at Safeway.  They gave my friend's son a rash, but for my kids these are great.|`|be8b9be707d55fa32115a4088d3ac4c3aa	I have used these and huggies. I like the huggies better because my son has sensitive skin too. These diapers irritated his bottom. I personally like the huggies. With my first son I used huggies and then white cloud. The white cloud worked great for him. When my new baby who is 7weeks now gets a little bigger then I will try the cheaper ones again but for now he is still to sensitive. Good luck to you.|`|saWJM651aa	Yes; my hubby and I love them.  We buy 2 boxes per month for our 1 year old son.  We have used them all the time with the other children also.  They are the best diaper in my opion.  Yes we did try the name brands but the parents choice work much better.  Don't be scared take a wing at it-you will love them.  All parents must try new things-from birth till well parenting never ends.|`|a202fe482f7f6091372f0257344c78c1aa	they work just as well|`|cab8f3eed982d7c810bf2e8fc14f2cecaa	Well if your child is anything like mine. You would be wasting more money doing the extra washing bc The parents choice diapers leaked in every way possible for my son. There has been plenty times Ive had to wake up to a bed,sheets, kid and blankets all soaked bc they wouldnt hold. He always got a fresh diaper right before being put to bed. Oh and when my son had teething diarrhea I created 3 to 4 days of laundry in one day bc those stupid diapers wouldnt hold. I think like someone else said maybe "cut out" or "cut corners" somewhere else so you can keep getting the huggies|`|ddP3klT3aa	For my son they work better than huggies. But I have heard of some people experiencing diaper rash with these diapers. I have never had a problem with them. Huggies are not absorbent enough in my opinion. Every baby is different. Try them out. A lot of people use cheap diapers at night because they do hold more. I don't care for white cloud because he always smelled like urine when I used them.<br>  When I say they and people I mean babies..I do not personally use diapers.|`|l79QIWszaa	I really like parent's choice and Target brand diapers.  They are a great deal and are unscented so they are easy on baby's skin.  As my baby has got older, I've started using Huggies at night because he sleeps for a long time and otherwise leaks which causes him to wake up...I think it's totally worth saving the extra money!  I do the same with formula.|`|YEqQZgs5aa	I have a 4 month old, someone had gotten me these for my shower - I tried them and have been using them ever since...   <br>  <br>  No leaks, no blowouts...  <br>  Before that I was using Huggies, which I did love BUT 18 dollars vs 5 for same amt of diapers? <br>  <br>  I did notice I had to move up to a bigger size earlier.. as in he only weighs around 14 pds right now, and size 2 said it fits through 16 pds, but size 3 is what he is wearing as of last week<br>  <br>  Try em out!!|`|Ueix2Q7Taa	I only use pampers because my son has very sensitive skin so I haven't used that brand but I've been told they don't work as well as pampers and huggies.
ybexjS2Paa	Well I always ask my paediatrician that question and he always says that if there's no fever and the child feels well there's no problem of him going to school. But of course it's up to you, if you worry leave him at home with you until he gets better.|`|qJBMdL7gaa	I say if he is feeling ok, then send him. If he does have a cold or flu bug, he has already been contagious for days...so..there is no need to keep him away from the other kids...|`|CYcqQb6Caa	i would say no becuz if there are children that have low immune systems they could get sick and if another kid is sick at the school then they could give it to your|`|ogX7TdKPaa	As long as he doesnt have a fever your fine.  Send him to school.|`|KmC0K59taa	I send my 2 yr old to daycare with a cough.  As long as there is no fever or lots of mucus in the lungs he should be okay.|`|fff3c3d8688e389a4670babefc9db6ebaa	If there is no fever, he's probably not contagious. My mother said you are only contagious when you have fever. It could be the weather or allergies or something. I'm sure a lot of irresponsible parents send their kids to school with far worse symptoms. I hate that. :P
35dae24ed321c4c235f68fe8d0aeca71aa	I hear ya, girl. I am with you. I cannot get comfy at night- I am too hot, then I wake up and am freezing cold! Half the day I walk around freezing for some reason and then around 7pm at night the entire house feels like an inferno to me. Gotta love the hormones. :)|`|zYBLzO9Naa	Ha. That's weird. I am completely opposite. I wake up freezing my booty off. But then I cover myself up with a million and one blankets. But all women are different. I agree it's not that comfy. But hopefully it'll pass soon enough. Congrats! Good luck, I hope for the best! :)|`|AA11567932	Hormones dear-they are funny things. If you were in your 40's I would have said a misdiagnosed pregnancy and more a case of the early menopause|`|ad0F70IMaa	i wanna say it has something to do with your hormones. and since your body is pumping more blood, this could cause the sweats.
H0fXySX9aa	The abbreviations '5/5' or '3/5' (plus '4/5', '2/5', and '1/5') refers to how low down your baby's head is in relation to the bones of your pelvis.

8XcRFF6Taa	If she is interested I would definitely get her a potty chair, as long as you don't push, it doesn't hurt:).  Girls are a lot faster when it comes to potty training than boys.  My son was 3 when he was finally potty trained.  My daughter is 17 months started using the potty at 11 months.  She was always dry when she got up in the morning and from naps so I would put her on the toilet and she went... every time:)  She is now in big girl underpants when we are at home, if we are out and about I do still put her in a diaper.|`|91bb4f1cbc053d5b71eb34012a44b2deaa	Go for it!  It can't hurt to try.  I started putting my daughter on the potty when she turned 1 year.  Just to get used to the whole bathroom thing.  At 20 months I decided she was ready.  She could say potty, so we did it.  3 days!  She was potty-trained in 3 days!  I am so happy I went for it.|`|2xS1Jro7aa	I think its the perfect time! Some kids hate being wet and will potty train really early! I would get her a little potty and go to the library and get her some books about going potty and poop on the big girl potty. And read the books and tell her that if she wants she can go potty on the big girl potty and then her diaper wont be yucky. Maybe also get some pull ups so its easier for her to get her pants up and down. If you feel comfortable letting her run around with out a diaper for a day she might go on the potty. My nephew potty trained at 15months old he watched his older brother and sister go on the potty and hated being wet so once before his bath he took off his diaper sat on the toilet backwards and went then smiled and got in the bath. If she ends up not wanting to go on the potty you don't have to push it yet but at least it will be there for her when she needs it. There are also some good dvds out there for kids to watch about going on the potty. From what you are saying I think she might be ready! Good luck!|`|acj9mB9Paa	I started with my son at 12 months, because he was letting us know he needed to be changed.  When I started researching I discovered something called "elimination communication".  You can actually start doing this at a much younger age, and it is not really "potty training" in the strictest sense, but it has helped us!!  The first thing we did was get him a potty chair (we got a "Once Upon a Potty" boy potty, but I have heard great things about Baby Bjorn little potties too).  We started putting him on it as SOON as he woke from night time or nap time and while he was sitting we cued him with the "ssss" noise and the ASL potty sign.  They always have to go then and it makes the link of, "This is what I do on the potty" easier.  It worked like a dream for my son!!  We also started putting him on the potty when he was making poo faces (most kids have a sign that they are trying to poo).  When he got the idea down, we started leaving him diaper free during the day with his potty where h could see it and get to it.  I know this sounds CRAZY, but we had only a few accidents!!  When they do have accidents, do not make a big thing of it, just look at them and say "Poo/pee goes in the potty" and go on.  My son is now 21 months and he can potty by himself if he is diaper/pants free, but still has a hard time getting his pants down fast enough.  He will get there though, it just takes patients!|`|263434b6fe9b827cbad3893e796d8d18aa	Nothing wrong with that, just set the potty chair out and let her know it available if she wants to use it. I've had my daughter's out since she started showing interest @ 16 months. She still hasn't used it, just turned 2. But she'll sit on it from time to time. She knows what it is and tells me she needs to go potty, but doesn't produce when she does. She is still having full diapers at night, so I have no reason to start encouraging her more.<br>  They wanted to force her at daycare and I put my foot down and said no. She only shows more interest @ daycare because she's the youngest in her class and all the other children are doing it. But at home she only shows interest when I need for her to do something she doesn't want to do. I don't believe in forcing children to potty train. I do however think its a great idea to expose them to it early, so they can get comfortable with it.
AVL2IS7Laa	i have just seen it on youtube
kTu7UtS1aa	I don't want to get your hopes up either, but before I got a BFP I had most of your symptoms:  Cramps, sensitive nipples, swollen breasts and milky discharge.  So, I knew that something was up since I don't get these symptoms with my period.  I attributed the cramps to implantation (the embryo attaching to the uterus).  I also had a dull backache (but I didn't think much of this because I get those pains with my period).  So, let's say that your cramps were due to implantation.  If that's the case, then you would probably get a positive test a week or so after they started.  I would take a test now.  If it's negative, then I would wait a bit longer (it takes some people 2 weeks after they are late to test positive!).  If you don't want to wait that long, I'd suggest seeing your doctor.  Good luck to you!!!|`|8x7rFddHaa	I don't want to give you false hope but I really think you should test. Other symptoms you can look for are visible veins in your chest, more accute sense of smell, aversions to scents, *parts* purple or darker, greater joint flexibility. I'd say got get a test at a dr.s office because if you aren't you'll want to be checked to know what is going on. A good source of early symptoms is www.babysnark.com, look for the symptom tab.<br>  Baby dust!|`|AA11540246	Take a HPT and see your doctor.
uuHPneEcaa	i think everyone has trouble sleeping. I know i did and i still do.. What helps me out a lot is I sleep on my left side with a pillow between my legs and i have a body pillow behing my back.. That helps me alot. I am sure things will get better for u. ur not lazy u have to get all the rest u can get before that baby comes. so don't think ur lazy.. I would nap I only work 3 days a week but on my two days off I don't have time to sleep because I am always running around to doctors appointment and to other appointments I have. so do not think ur lazy not one bit.. Good luck to u and I hope things get better for u.<br>  <br>  This is my 1st. and I am like about to pass out right now. I hate the part running to the bath room all hours of the night. it drives me crazy. my sister just laughs at me.|`|nISYAHkfaa	I haven't gotten as far along as you so I don't know about the issues of having a tummy too big, but I find that I ALWAYS have nightmares while I'm pregnant.

By 35 weeks I was sleeping 4 hours, moving to the couch only to watch tv for 4 hours before falling asleep again for another 3 hours or so. It is very exhausting, I know. I ended up buy about 5 pillows and putting them all around me. My poor husband barely had any room. :)|`|e5a8ca9a40c842fd6f909812078000a7aa	Im 22w+6d pregnant and i am suffering with exactly the same!!! <br>  <br>  I think it must be the time of pregnancy as it seems everyone i have spoken to about this says they experienced it at around the same time!!<br>  <br>  I hope things get a little easier for us :)<br>  <br>  CONGRATULATIONS!! Enjoy your next 18 weeks :) xxx|`|AA11916244	I am the same exact way. As a matter of fact i was complaining about it this morning. Like you i have no trouble taking my naps. But at night i go to sleep late, toss and turn because the sciatica is causing me pain, then wake up before 7. I only get 5-6hrs of sleep at night. it stinks cuz when your belly gets big, you actually have to wake up to turn over. Everyone keeps telling me that its the bodys way of preparing you for loosing sleep with a newborn. I guess it is kinda true but i wish we didnt have to go through it. Good luck hope u get some sleep soon.<br>  Oh lets not forget having to get up to pee twice a night and the baby kicking you so hard it wakes you up.|`|rlMbcfpXaa	It sounds like you may have a little Restless Leg Syndrome going on, which is common during pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Yes, I had a ton of trouble sleeping at night at 22 weeks. It was probably due to hormone fluctuations and generally being uncomfortable.  A body pillow helped me sleep better.  <br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong with taking naps. And lazy is the least thing that you are when you nap.  When you are sleeping, your body can focus on the baby and make sure that your body is healing as well.  <br>  <br>  The sleeping got better around 24 weeks. I still wake up at night several times (usually to pee) and the dreams have kicked in full force, but I seem to be sleeping better still and I am 34W, 5D.   <br>  <br>  Any sleep you can get, day or night, is beneficial, so just nap when you can!|`|ad0F70IMaa	Tell your ob. i think theres something out there you can take to help you sleep at night.
1thzSbS8aa	There's really no way to tell after only 10 days. Too early for a urine test to  be definitive.<br>  <br>  Anyway, pregnancy tests are not performed routinely on urine samples. The doctor took the sample for your UTI, so he will order screening for bacteria, not for pregnancy hormones. He wouldn't order a pregnancy test unless you gave him reason to believe it was necessary. It also wouldn't require waiting until Monday for the results, because a pregnancy test doesn't require culturing---he'd tell you then and there if you were pregnant.<br>  <br>  You are probably not pregnant, but only because it's always more likely not to be pregnant than to be pregnant. Chances are never greater than one in four, even when you're trying. Your chances with the "pull out" method, which is a very ineffective method, are about one in 5-6.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	You could be pregnant.|`|af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	no you are not a sl**, i completely understand you hun,  but as long as you are having sex yes there are chances of getting pregnant and yes even if he pulled out there is still a chances and yes pre*** can get you pregnant I have several frends who have had that happen to them. go to www.babycenter.com check under "TRYING TO CONCEIVE" put in your last period and it should give you your fertile days if you had sex in those days yes there is a big chance you can be pregnant. good luck and hope all turns well|`|JKtjBAe6aa	okayy.<br>  so i am not going to be a big ***** or anything sweetie.<br>  but thats ******* retarded to have unprotected sex ! <br>  okayy. <br>  if you dnt wanna get pregnant start using a condom or birth control or stop asking if yur pregnant.<br>  <br>  but there is a good chance you are pregnant.<br>  and yahh they can tell through a yuren test.|`|0arS35xcaa	well i just had a pregnancy scare a week ago and i know how you feel.<br>  first of all stop worrying so much it really wont help it will just make you ill and then you will probably think that your illness is a sing of pregnancy wait till about a week after your missed period(if you miss it) and take a test if it comes out positive don't stress stressing can cause harm n the baby and that is the last and worst thing that could happen try to tell somebody that you know would love and support you in all your decisions precisely your parents. think of all your options. abortion,adoption, or keep the baby im not going to try to tell you what the best thing to do if you are cause it is your choose and for all the people who down you for the choices you make well maybe you don't need them in your life anyway. but yea try not to worry so much and just Relax im sure your not prego but if you are i have faith that you will be a great mommy:D<br>  <br>  <br>  hope i helped|`|YokvyU6Xaa	It is still VERY possible to get pregnant even if your partner "PULLS OUT" Pre- ejaculation also carries sperm. You need to confide in someone you can trust. Teen pregnancy is a scary thing. I've been there. I got pregnant with my first child when I was 17. and pregnant with my 2nd child at 18. There are a bunch of services that can help you through this. Like planned parent hood. They can refer you to programs that will help you be better prepared for the baby. Couseling, parentiung and birthing classes. You should take a pregnancy test. They also provide those at little to no cost or you can just purchase one. Urine can be used to test for pregnancy. It measures the amount of hormones and your body

And she was on Nutramigen Hypo Allergenic, so I couldn't get the stuff with rice starch already in it.<br>  <br>  EDIT: And her pediatrician advised me to do this because the reflux medicine wasn't working.

It is unnecessary bulk with little nutritional value which they don't need. They will get full up, but they might not have got all of the nutrients they should have because they will have had less milk. <br>  <br>  I know in the past it was common to do this, but our understanding of baby nutrition has changed in recent years.<br>  <br>  When the child is between 4-6 months (I think current advice is to leave it until 6 months in most cases), you could start to mix a little rice cereal with milk and feed them it from a spoon as a first stage of weaning.<br>  <br>  Of course, there are some limited cases where a doctor will recommend it, in which case it's OK as long as you follow the doctor's directions exactly and are careful not to leave the child alone with their bottle. But unless you have been advised by your doctor, it's really not a good idea.|`|G1ZgTqNcaa	You should not put rice cereal in a baby's bottle unless you have been directed to do so by a doctor, since a baby's digestive system may not be ready for it.  Generally a doctor will tell you to put cereal in a bottle if the baby has acid reflux or is spitting up a lot to make the milk thicker.  My baby was about 3 months when I put rice cereal in her bottle due to her reflux, which was directed by her doctor.|`|CeS9Pin7aa	I never did that, it can clog the nipple of the bottle and make it harder for baby to eat which is not a good thing!<br>  <br>  At around 6 months you should start giving baby rice cereal mixed with breast milk or formula (or water if that's what the directions indicate) on a spoon - before that their digestive system isn't ready for cereal.  It used to be 4 months was the recommended age to start solids (when I had my first 2 kids) and my kids did fine at that age, but I guess they have since learned more about baby tummys :)|`|be8b9be707d55fa32115a4088d3ac4c3aa	I know people say no to do it cause it is a choking hazard but it can't be that bad because my sons doctor told me to put it in his bottles at 4 weeks. He has acid reflux and he gets cereal in every bottle to keep him from spitting it all back up. You have to use a bigger nipple for the cereal to come through, maybe this is why people say something about choking. I have not had a problem with this. But if you are one of those people who props your babies bottle up then i would say definitely don't do. As long as you are feeding your baby normally and watching them eat then I say that a little won't hurt them. My doctor told me to put 1tbs per oz of milk. It is to thick to come through a slow nipple but comes through a fast flow just fine. My son is 7weeks now and doing great. Good luck to you.|`|iFDye9RMaa	4 weeks. She was starving, and eating 3 oz every other hour. She then went to eating 3oz every 3-4 hours... which is a huge relief, and she slept a lot better. I know people think its a choking hazard, but I think they are envisioning the cereal as a really thick mixture....but  I only added 1tsp to the 3oz, she never had even one incident with choking. You could barely even tell it had been added it was so thin, but that is all she needed. So I think its just how you do it. You will need to get some cereal nipples or we used variable flow nipples, they seemed to work better. I would not cut the nipples you have though because its so hard to get the size just right.|`|Ke9gAvJTaa	I never put it in a bottle. I never used a bottle with my children.<br>  It's best to mix it in a bowl, And spoon feed it. <br>  It's getting your baby used to eating with a spoon, AND puts it at a less risk for a choking hazard.<br>  Good luck!|`|l79QIWszaa	Never.  At 6 months, put some rice cereal in a bowl if your baby is ready.  Do not mix it in a bottle, especially if you are breastfeeding!|`|mOFShz3Eaa	never ever ever put anything but milk in the bottle! if they are old enough for rice cereal than it should be fed from a spoon!|`|6z9JT4puaa	you can give rice cereal to a baby as young as 4 weeks but only rice cereal until 4-6 months..and you can mix it wit formula in a bottle there is no problem wit that because if your baby want more to eat at 2 months he/she can not eat from a spoon so bottle is the only thing....am i wrong???
dde8ee0158b3da0fb4d185658f2c094faa	My daughter used to get them at least 3 times a day. A nurse told me to make sure she had a hat, socks and mittens on. Somehow it helps (can't remember the reason) but it cut them down in half. My daughter had a habit of wiggling off her hat! lol<br>  Other than that, you just have to ride them out. It doesn't hurt her so don't worry too much about it.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	My son did this.  Just hold her.  There's really nothing you can do to make them stop, in my experience.  It never appeared to bother my son that much.|`|7kosr9mcaa	you can try gripe water, or give her a few sucks of a bottle or soother. It always worked for my son.|`|Ke9gAvJTaa	Aww. It's so sad when your baby gets the hiccups, and you can't do anything to help her. <br>  Happened to me many times.<br>  I'm not sure if it helped, But I always rubbed there tummys. Babies love that.<br>  I'm not sure If you can really do anything about that. <br>  I'm sorry!<br>  Good luck, and congratulations|`|ddP3klT3aa	That is very common. They will get them all the time. I always gave mine a little water. I always bought the nursery water from wal mart for that and for mixing formula.|`|k2heQRKFaa	I think just like adults there is no cure for hiccups u just kinda have to go through them..they like to be held or bounced....it probably just annoys them..hiccups dont hurt but they  do suck....|`|860158682c2b7621907ad595c456bf5faa	i went through the exact same thing with my daughter!!! she had hiccups all the time, even in the womb. she doesn't get them as frequently now, but i always give her a couple ounces of formula and she's set. if that doesn't work, try a pacifier. they say they get rid of them through that constant sucking. it almost always worked for me, so i hope it works for u!!
mx3gFmIKaa	He's tall.  The average 2 year old is 34.5" and 26-28lbs so he looks two.  Between 1 and 2 years old they only gain 3-5 inches in height, and 3-5 lbs.  So at 2 he will be approximately 36" and 28-29 lbs.  This puts him over 6 ft as an adult.<br>  <br>  Ethan's mommy-Ethan is pushing numbers that will put him at 6'6"+|`|1s3nddaYaa	same here.  my son is 16 months as well and 26 pounds and i think it was 34in, she double checked cause she didnt think it was right.but it was. i get the same remarks.|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	I understand the feeling. I have a son turning 4 in May, and he's 43.5 inches. People assume because he's so much teller than others his age he's around 6. Same with my son who's almost 5. People think he's closer to 6 or 7.|`|NbJbZXtGaa	Honestly, I think that is pretty close to normal. My son just turned two and is 33 inches and 26 lbs, BUT he is small for his age...only in the 10th percentile for height! So, 33 inches at 16 months is probably closer to the normal/tall range.|`|jrVlzffeaa	My son's also 16months, he weighs 27lbs and is 37inches tall!! People always think he's older than he is and talk to him like an adult and he can't talk properly either!! lol Xx|`|aJu53IX4aa	Athletic scholarship!|`|rkSBHqtQaa	Wow that kinda tall for a 16mth old. At least I think so. My little man is 2 and he's only 34 inches tall and weighs 26 lbs. Then again he was a preemie. He was born at 35wks weighing only 5 lbs 2 oz and was only 17 in long. Now my 8 month old that's a long little monster. He's 28 in long and weighs 16 lbs. But he was a full term baby. If that makes any difference.|`|qJBMdL7gaa	I have 2 little boys...My oldest was always small for his age, but my youngest has always been big for his age. I don't have a 16 month weight/height for him, but I have a 15 month.<br>  At 15 months he was 33 1/2 inches and weighed 29 lbs 12 oz.<br>  So, your baby isn't too big at all.<br>  Mine is now almost 3 and weighs 43 lbs...and his 6 year old brother is 44 lbs.<br>  Its weird how different kids can be!|`|91bb4f1cbc053d5b71eb34012a44b2deaa	He is the same size as my daughter who is 2.  I have a nephew that is 3 and a full head taller than my son who will be 5 in June.  His parents always get people thinking he is in kindergarten.  Like I said he is only 3.|`|P8JWNjyHaa	boys are slower in learning than girls, but when they decide to do anything, its done just like that.   he'll catch up soon.|`|KLoI7bdXaa	hahahahah omg that is reallyy funnny|`|rZQVZpoUaa	he's fine! don't worry better than being short or sick!|`|htfyL6I2aa	my lil fella at 16 months was 26 pounds and 33 inches.  He seems normal to me.
0acF0y1Jaa	it's completely normal, so don't worry! it'll probably get a little bit heavier, not by much, so don't freak ;)  it might even take on a slight odor, nothing funky though. i asked my dr about it & that's what he told me!|`|hameOvsyaa	Its normal as long as it doesnt itch or anything like that.|`|1Hrlhx7qaa	Yes it is completely normal|`|LDPabWk0aa	yeah is normal!|`|3X0t8JrXaa	Its perfectly normal...I'm not sure exactly why but its normal I know that much.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	as long as there is no smell and it isn't too yellow then you should be fine. but if there starts to be an odor or anything else abnormal, you'll need to be checked out.|`|kBwdaGY5aa	as embarrasing as it is, it is perfectly normal, it sucks huh? i'm about 6 months and i have had it the entire time|`|373b04f6dbf649a6ef357e85b32df3e4aa	It's VERY normal huni. :)<br>  <br>  That's when I know I'm pregnant, before testing lol!<br>  <br>  Congratulations xxxx|`|FgAPXhVRaa	Very normal. Pantyliners have become my best friend!!! Good luck and congrats on your baby!|`|iP863XM6aa	Normal.. i get that too|`|ntWi1fo0aa	It is very normal... I would suggest the book What to expect when expecting. That is the pregnancy bible and it will tell you with each month what and how your body<br>  will change. Excellent book... even with those who hate to read. Congrats and good luck|`|AA12192310	it is normal towards the very end of your pregnancy it may have a bit of a bloody tinge to it possibly the mucous plug|`|b8f0CfSsaa	Very normal! Unless the discharge smells, itches or burns then you have nothing to worry about.|`|f5c840d7deb2bdbef3fa8b152ae928adaa	Increased discharge is entirely normal.  You might find it helpful to wear panty liners.|`|dAgtW3G0aa	Very normal, if not smelly or itchy then you're fine! oh and by the way it will probably get worse as you get closer to your due date...icky!!|`|uTEr67Bhaa	It is completely normal.|`|VKMBaz8daa	I would say that it is normal. I have noticed the same for myself and in the end I have used pantie liners|`|GxJL9UjVaa	yep 100% normal. you may get used to it!!:) lol
uFrqC4Y2aa	You took a Clearblue Easy test? Those are pretty accurate to take before your missed period. I took it before my MP and got a positive result. <br>  <br>  Everyone is different for moprning sickness, but it's not very common to get it so soon.|`|HW89eJEZaa	there is no set time limit for morning sickness, it all depends on the person, you can get it anytime!|`|PvEEOdKBaa	you can get m/s as early as 9 days after ovulation.  So if you ovulate early like say 7 days and implantation has happened it could happen really doggone early like maybe 2.2 weeks after period begins.  But m/s is caused by hormonal changes and those same hormonal changes tell the pregnancy test you are prego.  Buy another test from another brand and test again hon, don't urinate for at least 4-6 hours beforehand either. Then you will know if you are just sick or m/s is here.|`|a5f1b4c7bbfaf30ae1bb896d87cdb66caa	Most otc pregnancy tests wont be accurate until 1 day after your missed period.  It has to do with the human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) hormone that builds up in a pregnant woman.<br>  <br>  First morning pee is best for using home tests, but if it cant be first morning, make sure you wait 4 to 6 hours between peeing to test to give the hCG time to build up in your urine.<br>  <br>  Everything I've read says you'll be about 4 weeks long before morning sickness kicks in.  The few moms I've asked says it can start earlier.
HW89eJEZaa	YES! you don't have to be dilated to go into labor.|`|D0oqTblpaa	It's a possibility but dilation is a sign that your body it getting ready for labor.  That said I sat at 3 cm with both my sons for weeks before I ended up having to be induced.  <br>  <br>  The truth is you never know.  If you went into labor now it just means that your body will have to work harder starting from 0 than say 3.|`|46cd2ca02c07674e58e26d9c11367762aa	Yes. You can go from not even slightly dilated to full on labour within a couple of hours. You do not need to be dilated to go into labour. Good luck, I hope your baby arrives soon!|`|Bg6txvxqaa	Yes, it can happen at any time and labour can start before you are even dilated at all!|`|Ql09WZa8aa	Everything is possible, it happens in a moment.. yes you can|`|2HHkMkuiaa	I would think so. It really depends on your body. Some labors prgress faster than others. Good Luck!!|`|abT0o6hHaa	are we a little anxious?|`|uuHPneEcaa	yeah u can go into labor at anytime.
7ZsvzIP7aa	You really need to watch that. I'm 37 weeks, 3 days and I'm in the hospital now for mild preeclampsia (pregnancy induced hypertension). Your doctor should be monitoring your blood pressure and checking your urine for protein just to be on the safe side. Usually the flashes are caused by high blood pressure, but if the ER said it was fine maybe it's something different. I would certainly keep talking to your doctor about it though, as it doesn't sound normal and if it is preeclampsia it can be dangerous for you or baby if it's not closely monitored or treated.|`|4KRSUhXLaa	I was thinking - have you ever had migraines, or do they run in your family? Sometimes they can come on with weird mixtures of symptoms - visual disturbances and stuff like that, but no pain. I have them occasionally, and although most of the time they are pretty standard, sometimes I'll get one where it just feels like half my face is numb and I'm sensitve to light - no headache at all.|`|VLRZT9Foaa	I'd keep an eye on your blood pressure.<br>  <br>  I'd also go have my eyes checked.  It may be unrelated to pregnancy.  If your retina is detaching it can cause severe floaters or flashes of light.  The problem can be fixed if caught before a detachment occurs.  Once it detaches, it causes blindness and can not be repaired.<br>  <br>  Not trying to scare you at all, but I'd make an appointment and also get a BP cuff to use at home.|`|nBGjPwViaa	Yes, I had flashes, and tunnel vision...and I was driving!!<br>  It was my blood pressure.<br>  Maybe your blood pressure is just spiking, and by the<br>  time you get checked it's back down.<br>  Definitely watch this -- could be bad for you and baby<br>  if you let it go...<br>  Mine settled down,  but they watched it the rest of<br>  the pregnancy...|`|V8JoRHnnaa	get urine checked for proteins.
oMGasIcjaa	That should have worn off within hours.  Call your doctor!|`|IPl3Yh1kaa	Oh dear, I don't think so. I got a spinal for a c and could feel everything a few hours after surgery was over. Call ur doc. Hope everythings ok|`|1GxMGmkqaa	see your doctor immediately. <br>  this is not how your body should respond. by this time you ought to be getting around ok and the stitches out if its C section. if this is the case, there is also the possibility that the operation was a little rough on your body. really are best to consult your gp asap|`|6766a597cb37bb1f650eea152025356daa	No. But Mine took 3 days to ware off they literally thought i was paralyzed. I could not move my legs but it was due to swelling where i was stuck. Please contact a neurologist. Your obgyn wont know what to do to help you. sounds like you have swelling or he hit a nerve, if there is damage i would contact a good lawyer.|`|e5a8ca9a40c842fd6f909812078000a7aa	No hun, that doesn't sound normal at all!!<br>  <br>  I think you should call your doctor straight away or at least call the hospital or midwife!!<br>  <br>  Good luck and congratulations on your little one xxx|`|CIZjK2rAaa	That is not normal.  You need to call your doctor.|`|0iUxfCMcaa	no call your doctor and tell them|`|AA11540246	call your doc asap
iFDye9RMaa	4.5 months. She tries rather.. she knows I pick her up under her arms, so when I asked her to come to momma or if she want momma to pick her up she throws her arms out to the side and giggles.

That way, if one kid finishes first he/she can just watch the movie until the next activity.  It keeps the kids from getting bored, unfocused, and then disruptive.|`|sIRnRy17aa	You could all get together at the end where the children take it in turns to pick a nursery ryhme or song and sing it together...or where you read a story to them...thats what the mother and baby group where i go to do and the kids love it!|`|fKuvMPCiaa	You could paint pictures, crayola makes this new paint/paper that only lets you paint on the special paper so there won't be a mess|`|r63DBSATaa	You should draw little pictures and dance to music.|`|16m5xm2Faa	TOYS
AA11916244	With my last one i had it and i was able to keep it under control by staying away from sugar. Im 30 weeks and last week i found out i failed my 1hr and the dr said just go pick up your meter. With this baby its VERY different. Not only do i have to stay away from sugar but i have to keep my carbs in check to. And i have to eat every 2 hours. Its so bad with this one i am scared to put anything in my mouth. You just will have to basicly eat healthy with a low carb high protein diet. Good luck. Oh also sometimes the one hour is wrong and thats why they make you do the 3 hour. So maybe you have nothing to worry about|`|NE96fU9vaa	you have to go on a low carb diet, as soon as you deliver, its gone.sugar is sugar, however natural it is, and sugar is made when carbs are broken down by the body, its hidden in many foods, so, see a nutritionist and stick to what they tell you to do.The baby will be ok, as long as you do youre part.|`|HW89eJEZaa	yes, i had it with 3 of my preg. i just watched my diet, kept an eye on my sugar readings, and ate the right foods at the right time of day! mine went away after i gave birth. but if you are eating fruit, you need to watch what time of day you eat it, fruit has natural sugars in it, so they can sometimes cause your readings to be higher!|`|O3EtP4vOaa	My sister was just diagnosed with GD, she just had to meet with a specialist to help her regulate her diet.  She is very thin, not over weight at all, and eats healthy.  Keep in mind you need to eat every 2.5 to 3 hours, you need to limit the amount of carbs and sugar, fruit is sugar just like a candy bar is sugar.  Our bodies do not have the ability to differentiate between the two, I have insulin resistance so I eat the same as if I was diabetic.  Since she has been diagnosed and changed the way she eats, how often and content, her sugar has been fine.
D2Xam3POaa	My OB told me that Metformin also increases a woman's fertility.
xoQxDGAlaa	I think I remember that you look at your ovulation day, count 5-6 days/temps back and the highest of those 6 temps is where your cover line should be or .1 degree higher is where it should be. Sorry, I don't use the cover line any more or else I could be more help.
Ezkn5azdaa	Yes and that my now 3 month old baby girl. She been admitted two times in the hospital because of it. And second time we just came home last friday. Been breastfeeding her since she was born. But had to supplement her with formula. She wouldn't take the bottle. The first admitted in the hospital. In there four days and she started taking the bottle. After a week of that she started refusing the bottles but wanted the breast only. The last hospital stay was in there for 10 days and they ended up putting a feeding tube because of it. She finally taking the bottle again and I am no longer breastfeeding her. She on high calorie formula right now.|`|qFmOuXMXaa	My first daughter was born at 7lbs 9 1/2ozs which was a good size at birth but she was just over 17 lbs on her first Birthday.She was always in the 5% but now almost 11years later she is 75 lbs and healthy and happy.|`|hbjbm3SRaa	My son has gained weight pretty slow. He was 7lbs 3 oz when he was born and now that he's a year old he weights 19.6lbs which the doctor seemed to thing was on the smaller side (he's only in the 3rd - 5th percentile for weight) but the doctor said there's nothing to worry about. He eats constantly so I have no idea where all of it's going :)|`|TZfDvyshaa	i was a slow weight-gain baby that didn't like feeding, i just wanted to sleep all the time! i was 5lb 9oz as a premature baby and was fed on cow's milk! but i turned out fine.....and that was 16 years ago :)|`|wP0AjcQ1aa	Yes, my son was so slow gaining weight in the beginning!

Just don't take it too far and try to raise them or counsel their Mother and cause bad blood.  They are not yours.|`|Lons8Pzyaa	dont stay awy from them because it will cause them to turn aganst you if they are really close to you. you should be there for them. y stop now since u already care.|`|UxG6CkU2aa	Are you close with their family?

B5MDTdtPaa	could be colic, reflux or lactose intollerance or other things..go see a dcotor to check if theres an underlying cause for the spitting up alot, i mean if hes also not sleeping well it could mean somethings bothering him aswell, uid def get chekd to make sure hes jsut a fussy baby or its a medical situation. best of luck :)|`|nBGjPwViaa	My daughter was diagnosed at 3 weeks w/colic, so it could take awhile to<br>  develop...<br>  There ARE things your doc can give you to use -- drops for gas and drops for the cramps/pain...<br>  And there will be special formula to use...<br>  So I would definitely go to the doc!<br>  Mine stopped colic at 5 mos.<br>  <br>  Lots of patience/love/walking/bouncing...<br>  There's lots of info out there on what to do to keep your sanity--I suggest<br>  you get all the help and info possible!!<br>  <br>  BTW: They say colicy babies are extremely bright!!!<br>  <br>  Lots of Luck!|`|Ot8lxaMEaa	Yeah their digestive systems arent mature yet and formula is hard for them to digest. Have you tried switching brands of formula, or maybe to a soy or hypoallergenic version? The best thing you can do is talk to his doctor.<br>  <br>  To help soothe him, and give your arms a break, buy a sling or carrier and walk around with him. The cuddling and walking action will be soothing and help him go to sleep. Try wearing him for several hours a day and you will notice a difference. Good luck and hang in there. Their stomachs start maturing after 3 months and it gets easier!|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Yes, it could be colic.  I put earplugs in my ears and put the baby in a tummy pack, and walked, and walked, and walked . . . .  By the time she was 4 1/2 months old, I was down 20 pounds below my pre-pregnancy weight!|`|yUyx2nhmaa	yes it usually goes after about 3 months. u just have to pat them on the back for hours!!!!|`|zHy0z7sAaa	My daughter became colicky when she was around a 3 or 4 weeks old.We tried everything and this poor child was screaming her head off morning, noon and night.We changed her formula several times and Enfamil makes a formula called Nutramigen for babies who have colic due to a cows milk allergy.We were told by her doctor that for the babies it actually helps, it usually starts to work within just a few days.It is expensive and it did not help our baby but it is worth checking out after you have had a screaming infant in your ear for hours on end.You could try it for a week and if there is no improvement, you don't have to buy anymore.I use Dr.Brown's bottles.They are more advanced than anything Playtex put out.The excessive spit up sounds like acid reflux to me, in which case you may want to make a call to his doctor.As far as gas goes,lay him across your lap to burp him and lie him on his back and move his legs back and forth gently, like he is riding a bike.It does sound like colic to me and aside from the formulas designed for colic due to a cows milk allergy, I am unaware of anything that helps other than time.Our daughter had the worst case of colic that 4 different doctors had ever seen, so I know how hard it is to deal withIf it is colic,it does get better and you will come out of it with the patience of a saint.Get help from people.If it gets to be too much, put him down somewhere safe and go outside.I've done that so many times I can't even count but after a few minutes of quiet thinking I was better able to deal.Good luck.<br>  P.S-I have been told by 3 different medical professionals that babies with colic tend to be smarter.Doesn't help much when you haven't slept in days but it gives you something to be positive about. :)|`|tmIEl0upaa	Sounds like your son probably has gastric reflux. This is wut makes him throw up a lot and because of that he never gets full in therefore is not colicy, just hungry. I cant say for sure, I'm not a dr but my son had it & I never slept it was awful! Your dr will have to do a test called a barium swallow and if it comes back positive will prescribe a medication that wil stop the throwing up. So I say talk to your dr about soon so u can start getting some sleep.|`|DrrL4sjBaa	My daughter had horrible colic. It didn't start until she was about a month old. She didn't just spit up, she projectile-spit-up through her mouth and nose. The crying and crying nearly drove me insane and I never got any sleep. It got to the point that I knew what channel was good to watch on television 24 hours a day. I tried everything to get her to sleep peacefully. Turns out she had colic AND she was lactose intolerant. At the suggestion of a well-meaning friend, I added a tiny bit of cereal to her bottle to fill her up and help her sleep. Big Mistake. The rice only bound her up more. <br>  <br>  I switched to a soy based formula, which helped, but only marginally. I ended up having to put her on Nutramigen formula, at the doctors request, which helped significantly. I would suggest you look into this formula and ask your doctor about it. It cost nearly twice what normal formula costs, but I would pay it again and again and again after all those sleepless night. <br>  <br>  Good Luck to you.<br>  <br>  I found these links that may helpful to you.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://hcd2.bupa.co.uk/fact_sheets/Mosby_factsheets/infant_colic.html" rel="nofollow">http://hcd2.bupa.co.uk/fact_sheets/Mosby...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.enfamil.com/app/iwp/enfamil/certificate.do?dm=enf&id=/Consumer_Home2/Enf_Tools_Resources/Enf_Programs_Offers/Nutramigensample&iwpst=B2C&ls=0&csred=1&r=3413719628" rel="nofollow">http://www.enfamil.com/app/iwp/enfamil/c...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070515141444AAONHBx">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|nnyowt2oaa	My dd started that at about 1 month old. She would be peaceful as can be then all of a sudden screaming in pain! I would check everything, (diaper, hungry, burp, etc.) and it woudl drive me crazy. The only thing that helped her was to be swaddled very tightly, then I would sit down and lay her on her side on the crack between my legs and rock my legs back and forth as I patted her back really hard. Then I would give her her pacifier. This was/is the ONLY way she will calm down when she has an episode. I've found myself a few times finding a seat in a store and doing it to her because she started crying. I explained it to my doctor, and along with the other symptoms she had, (coughing, spitting up, choking, crying during breastfeeding...) she diagnosed her with reflux and we're trying Zantac. I'm nervous to give her medicine, but we'll see if it helps her be in less pain. I've also heard about Colic Calm www.coliccalm.com|`|uxjmNfOcaa	It sounds like colic. What are you feeding him, because if you are feeding him formula, there are a lot of types that are harder on the stomach then others. My daughter had the same problem, and after I found her the right formula, she did great. She couldn't drink any enfamil formulas or the Nestle Good Start. I can't say which kind would be best for you to try, but she did amazing on the similac. Talk to your doctor and ask him/her to give you some different formula samples to try out for a colicy baby. For now, you can gently rub his belly when he's in pain, and keep up the gas drops they help a little not perfectly, but they will ease his pain. Good Luck and I wish the best for you and your baby. Also, I know it seems awful right now, but it will work out, and he will get better. I promise!
tQPvv0Glaa	No, every pregnancy is different and your hormone levels will be different with each pregnancy.  Besides, you said the first time you got a faint line - any line, no matter how faint, is a positive.|`|eNhVVmG7aa	It may well happen that way again.  Every biochemical pregnancy test method or kit has a "limit of detection".  When bHCG hormone (the pregnancy hormone) is present in levels "just below, at or above" that stated "limit of detection", you sometimes will see a faint line.  It just depends.<br>  <br>  Now, blanket statements aren't a good idea and I should probably know better than to say this publicly on a "trying to conceive" board.  But...<br>  <br>  Generally, with a home pregnancy test kit, when you start getting a line - even if it is very very faint - on the patient area, then it's probably positive.  My advice in these situations is to wait maybe 4-5 more days, and to repeat the test, being sure to use your very first morning urine - one that is most concentrated.  That will insure that if you are producing bHCG in your urine, you have the best chance of finding it.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  John Jones, M.D.|`|fp0N5e13aa	it cloud be possible but it depens on your hormones leves!  :)|`|AE8tlGedaa	Quite possibly
O3EtP4vOaa	testing this early you will want hold it in and not pee for at least 4 hours if you are not going to use FMU.  Also do not over saturate yourself w/ alot of liquids.  The earlier pregnant you are the lower levels of Hcg you will have in your urine, so to detect it you will want the most concentrated sample you can have.  I would give til monday and then test if you can wait, if you do not mind spending money on tons of hpt's then go ahead and test today.  Personally I should own stock in First Response I buy so many tests!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|tdNfQWaAaa	You could probably test again today. I would say to wait until in the morning and use first morning urine, but thats completely up to you. But don't be upset if it is a negative. Some women dont get a positive until a week after they miss a period! Good luck and lots of baby dust!!!!! xxxx
72b1b98cae822f6e9e185fe824d0b9cdaa	2nd trimester doesn't end until after your 27 week and i count by 4 since you can be pregnant for a total of  40 weeks but right now i would say that you are at least 6 months, in two weeks you'll be 7.|`|v3LnJycKaa	there are technically 9 full months to pregnancy (some argue 10 this is because you have to complete the month to be considered that month, i.e. when you have started your 6th month you are technically 5 months and 1 week... like you dont say you are 30 when you are 291/2) <br>  <br>  Anyway.. so 24 weeks means you have completed your 5th month, so technically right now you are 5 1/2 months pregnant... (meaning halfway through your 6th month) second trimester I believe starts at week 28, so end of next week you should be starting your third trimester. <br>  <br>  hope that made sense, it all makes my head spin.|`|1GxMGmkqaa	just about now. 26 weeks and this is when should the baby decide to come at this early stage, it should be able to survive with assisance. up to this point it would be too risky. <br>  count 40 weeks. dont worry about the month thing. its almost like they forget the first month! <br>  divide 40 by 3 and there are your trimesters. from here on the baby will just keeping growing and in the last 4-6 weeks will double its size! <br>  enjoy and dont be thinking about trimesters - be thinking:<br>   "while baby moves, baby grows!"|`|bTlhBX3daa	Oooh, you are almost there. Congrats!!!<br>  <br>  I am at 32 weeks tomorrow and I have been VERY sore for the past week cause my baby went head down, and I have lots of stretching going on. <br>  <br>  Trust me, don't rush it. LOL.|`|B6Mfx5fUaa	You should check with your doctor to see his answer because you are going to get many different ones here.  I was actually just goggling that yesterday!  Most say it starts at 28 weeks, however.  Best of luck to you!|`|6766a597cb37bb1f650eea152025356daa	pregnancy is 40 weeks you divide by 3 that is aprox 13.3 weeks each one so 26 weeks 6 days is the last day of the second.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	some say at 29 weeks some at 27 <br>  i say 27 is the end|`|Jk4wnsZwaa	Second trimester ends at 27 weeks and third starts at 28.
8XcRFF6Taa	I always buy organic whole milk and meats, the fruit and veggies I don't worry about too much.  I don't know if its necessarily better but to me adding hormones to my sons milk and meat just doesn't sound good:)  Vitamins are very good for your kids, they are growing an need all the nutrients they can get, from foods and vitamins.  Also I always add flaxseed oil to my kids food(once a day)  it is very healthy, high in omega 3 fatty acids, great for their growing brain and provides many other health benefits:)<br>  <br>   <a href="http://www.flaxseed-oil.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flaxseed-oil.net/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.umm.edu/altmed/articles/flaxseed-oil-000304.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.umm.edu/altmed/articles/flaxs...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|2F5HNPqPaa	Organic foods have more nutrients that non-organic food (apparently).  <br>  <br>  The one problem with non-organic food is traces of chemicals that can be more harmful to small children and babies than adults.  <br>  <br>  As for vitamins... I'd say as they're a fairly new thing and as the human race has survived for thousands of years without them, they're not hugely important.. as long as the kids have a balanced diet (lots of fruit and veggies as you said).  Too many vitamins can be just as harmful as not enough.  Maybe every now and then would be good, but I wouldn't give them vitamins religiously!|`|SIK58haraa	I have read that only certain foods are best organic. It's foods that are grown in the ground and milk that is best organic. That way they aren't grown in dirt with pesticides which the food can absorb..But food that isn't grown in the ground is fine..So says the news..|`|xNkmK0SHaa	I would trust ONLY my pediatrician to answer those questions.|`|0v55bQT1aa	I don't think so. I believe, if it's "home cooked" and has nothing to do with "tv dinners or frozen", it's healthy.|`|FvhCUHjxaa	If you can afford it, I say go for it. For me, I'm allergic to preservatives so I have no choice but to eat all organic/ natural. Since going organic I've felt more clean, healthy, energized, and the food tastes a lot better. I shop at Whole Foods and since it's expensive, I only buy their generic brand, and I try to buy things when they are on sale, it won't be as cheap as Costco but it's just as expensive as some other stores in my area. Vitamins never hurt; just a daily multi for children that your doctor recommends should be good. Good luck hope I helped!|`|AkFag8tNaa	If you can purchase all organic that's great but it is more expensive. There are lists that show the produce that contains the most pesticide and the ones that can be peeled thus removing most if not all of it. Apples are one of the highest btw. Kids should get the majority of their vitamins from food but it doesn't hurt to have that added insurance (especially if you have a picky eater).
FgAPXhVRaa	So so normal. I was the same way and when I noticed myself being that way I go to my favorite room in my house and get away from everything. I just needed to be alone to settle down and relax!! Good luck and it does get better!|`|uuHPneEcaa	YES MOOD SWINGS ARE LIKE NUMBER ONE! its just ur hormones.. Mine where so bad that the baby's father doesn't want anything to do with me now.. He wants to be involved with his son just not me.. which i understand 100% he said he loves me and wants to be with but he said he doesn't know if he can.. <br>  <br>  but back to ur question mood swings are normal. its ur hormones. they will change im sure..<br>  <br>  mine get really bad when i am at work because i work with  the most nasty people in the world!! they leave food out all the time they still have bean dip in the frig from our new years party!! i just wanna rip my hair out and go off on everyone.<br>  <br>  Ah yeah waiting up to 12 weeks.I didn't tell anyone but my sister the baby's father and his parents that i was pregnant. everyone else i made it wait.. I was a real bit*h to everyone and no one could understand why. so when I did tell they where like ah thats why ur acting like u do.. got it.. its normal. hun..I lost my partner because I was a real bit*ch to him because he doesn't live where i do so it makes it really hard on me and I have to understand that he has two children already from a previous marriage. and we argue constantly.. over what we are going to name our son.. that is where most of the anger comes from..|`|Ki6jlwnbaa	yes! mine are so bad. i freak out over everything. And my road rage is horrible, I'm gonna purposely rear end someone some day! I am 11 weeks.|`|IaK4SRHpaa	Poor you and yes some women go through this during prenancy and its hard because you can't really take any kind of medication while you are pregnant.  Try listening to your favorite music and make sure you get good balanced meals.  If you can maybe go walking for short distances to get outside and in the sun.  Talk with your doctor to see what he suggests you can do about the mood swings.<br>  <br>  Try not to stress about it because this could add to your mood strings too.  And just know that you are not going crazy but that this happens to some people and that you are not alone.  If you have someone you can talk to about it, try talking to them about what you are going through this would help.<br>  <br>  One last thing is that when I get like that, I just like to let myself go and cry.  The crying lets me release the tension I'm feeling and it really does make me feel better.  I do this when I get really down and feeling very icky.  I'm not sure why that is either but it really helps.  Best of luck to you and your baby to be.  Feel better.|`|90eDaQpBaa	i sure hope so, cause im the same way and me and my man are on the brink of breaking up cause of it, if you want to talk email me...wizerthanthem@yahoo.com|`|67EaIAvbaa	just like my sons mom...it sucked...good luck.|`|bTlhBX3daa	Yeah, they are totally normal due to the hormones. When you hit the 2nd Trimester (12/13 weeks) the hormone's will level off a bit and that will help. But unfortunately, you can expect to deal with some mood swings throughout the pregnancy due to both hormones, and the fact that so much is changing (physically with your body, mentally, and in your environment). <br>  <br>  Just try to remember that it's part of pregnancy. I remember just bursting into tears during my first trimester and not even being able to tell my fiance why I was crying. I also started quite a lot of fights for stupid reasons. <br>  <br>  Congratulations by the way!!!|`|oCTG5IVvaa	I know it's hard, luckily my boyfriend and i kind of found a way of making a joke of it. I get a bit snappy and he will just go "its ok, you hate me!" or i'd just say "oh im being an evil cow ignore me".<br>  I would also cry floods of tears over smallest thing, i think he found that more annoying.<br>  i was bad around 9 weeks and it wore off a bit at 11 weeks.<br>  <br>  I thought i'd got better..but i just had an absolute anger fit about 5 mins ago.<br>  i went to make mash potato (my current craving) and was just about to mash it - and realised my brother (who i'm sharing house with at the mo before my boyfriend and i move into our new house) had just finished the butter off that morning (evidently he uses half a tub of butter on one piece of toast)...<br>  i totally lost it and slammed round the house like a mad lady swearing and shouting to myself about how selfish and useless he is.<br>  It's a good job he wasn't here when i found out.<br>  <br>  Lol.<br>  <br>  So....yeah....your not alone...<br>  <br>  People might not know you're pregnant but as soon as they find out they will understand straight away.<br>  I think its best to have a good chat with your partner to explain whats happening with you and find a way to deal with it.|`|wObmwK1uaa	i am exactly like this, i mainly cry though as my baby doesn't let me go to sleep it wakes me up in the middle of the night. on your question it says yo haven't told any one i think yo should tell your partner and then he might understand, if yo haven't already done so.<br>  <br>  Congratulations on the pregnancy x|`|EcQeNu3raa	There isn't really much you can do about it. Its a part of pregnancy. Just explain that you mean no harm and its the hormones. People will understand. I understand b/c I have screamed at my fiance for the smallest thing.|`|DgFhlJvYaa	Hahaha that's how my sister was during the whole thing. Her doctor said it was normal but just in case you should go to the doctor. In some rare cases that's not a good thing. It happend to a friend of mine.|`|xarKlp0Oaa	I went through horrible mood swings just like you. It does go away your body just has to get used of the extra hormones and then it should go away.|`|hameOvsyaa	Its normal to have mood swings especially if your prego. Dont worry about it since it'll go away.|`|01kEoI0Oaa	your pregent|`|67bcfb21ec3e167fb35fde2a4e4e02d8aa	Yes, the mood swings are normal.  I am now 31 weeks pregnant with my 2nd child.  I will say it does get better over the next couple of months but then when you get close to deliver it comes back again.  Just be patient and explain to your family and friends that if you happen to say or do anything during the next couple of months that you are sorry up front and working to control your emotions but that it will take time for your hormones to regulate.|`|yrJQHOOeaa	Sweetheart it is not only completely NORMAL but expected as well. My wife is 8 months pregnant and it has been HELL. But I love her unconditionally and figure her mood swings are MY karma (my way of having to suffer through the pregnancy with her.) At the end of it all, I will be holding my newborn Daughter Nina, breathe a sigh of relief, and know without a doubt that I would do it all over again in a second! It will taper off some in the second trimester but worsen in the third. You will be fine so don't be so hard on yourself. You can email my wife at:<br>  flora00@clearwire.net if you want more reassurance. BTW... congratulations!!!|`|AA12227599	It's VERY normal. You need to control it as best you can though, because all that screaming and crying is not good for the baby. Ask your doctor if there are things you can do to alleviate some of the irratic behavior. Maybe try Yoga, or something like that. Or you could start practicing your breathing really early. Controlled breathing will help you to relax. Just try to do it before you start freaking out.|`|kToZcmOgaa	its pretty normal For a pregnant woman's hormones to crazy during the first few weeks, but just hope that your hormones aren't going to be like that during the whole time. somethings to do is go to a mommy and me yoga class or just do something that makes you feel better and calms you down. good luck
c73QkZ2haa	Stop waking him up to eat when hes hungry he will wake up . If hes not hungry right when he wakes up dont feed him wait for him to build an appetite. Play with him change him.<br>  If he is crying like that every night at the same time he may have colic. Make sure he has no gas, rub his back or his tummy and rock him to help him calm down. You can also try some gas drops.<br>  Just let him eat and sleep when he wants to hes still a little too young to be put on a schedule and it seems like hes settling into one himself so just follow his cues and let him eat and sleep when you think he needs it.|`|EOyujCyBaa	he could have colic, babies with colic usually cry all evening after 5pm.. call your doc or go into see her, she will be able to tell u more on the subject.. p.s dont wake baby to feed he will let you kinow when he is hungry :)
Ueix2Q7Taa	my cycle always varied from 28 to 40 days. We just really didn't worry about it and had sex every other day. Since you're fertile for about 4 days we figured we'd eventually have sex on the most fertile day if we just continued to have sex every other day. We got pregnant in four months.|`|IAzCsvaNaa	sorry im in the same situation as u but if you get any adivce can u please email it to me. lots of baby dust to u from me
34VXCyvVaa	I'm surprised, too, by the trend away from unisex names, but after 30 years of unisex names, maybe young parents are again looking for something different.  The current trend toward old-fashioned girls' names such as Sophia, Ava, Emma, Madeline and Isabella gives parents some "new" names that are graceful and feminine for their daughters.  Women have more equal opportunities now than they did 30 years ago when parents might have felt that a "stronger" unisex or more masculine name might give them an advantage in the business/professional world.|`|CMuL7XpKaa	weird what about Blake
9zwSclnLaa	Why would the father be asking?  Sounds suspicious to me, I wouldn't do it though, either way.  Just to be safe.  I am sure the father doesn't sit up all night making sure your nephew stays on the couch.  Anything can happen.  I am 14 and wouldn't be allowed to spend the night at my boyfriends house, even if I slept on the couch.|`|H0sPCJQPaa	I say no.<br>  Boys and Girl mixed sleepovers should be over by 4.<br>  I do not think thats right.<br>  <br>  sorry.<br>  <br>  <br>  I just re-read it. sorry. Sounds like the dad likes ur nephew. <br>  sick. just keep the boy away from the dad/. i wouldnt trust it.|`|GGH0HVdvaa	Well at least they are keeping the youngsters apart instead of letting them sleep together. Doesn't sound so bad to me.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	I agree with your sister.|`|af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	Yeah that is a little weird, I have to admit. Has your nephew ever said these two men make him uncomfortable? I would try and do a little investigating maybe your sister should go to their house and have a little talk with them give your nephew a cell phone and see how it all goes. I'm sure she doesnt have to worry about them having sex or anything because what kind of father would let his daughter have sex in  his home?|`|ocD3kv5oaa	I think your sister ought to keep her son from staying the night with his girlfriend! They are much to young to sleeping over at the opposite sex's house. She could wind up pregnant or he could come up with an std. I also think it is a little wierd that a teenage girls father would think that this is ok.|`|Vgk8VnXwaa	Sounds like the father wants your nephew.  Call the cops.|`|0arS35xcaa	GFDGDFGDGDFSG|`|lTsPX04jaa	would you like to be a grandma?|`|Drnpe4T5aa	Adults that are "helping" teens have sleep overs are not behaving responsibly.  The dad is trying to get "points" from his daughter by being the "cool" parent, wanting to be her friend, instead of her dad.  He has some issues that he needs to work through (top of the list being *how to be an effective parent*).  <br>  Your nephew is not going to gain anything by having sleepovers at 15 and your sister has every right to say No to them.  The best way to do that is to provide an environment at her own home for the teens to be.  No!  I am not suggesting sleep overs!  But clearly the dad in question is not going to watch the kids properly.  So if movies are going to be watched, homework to be done together, etc, she should try to encourage it to be done at her own home so the teens can be chaperoned the way parents are supposed to.<br>  EDIT - Oh, for Pete's sake!  This is a *parenting* issue between a girl's divorced parents, not a gay issue.  If the dad had a girlfriend and was encouraging sleep overs, he would still be trying to be the "cool" parent (both to gain points with his daughter and to p*** off his ex wife), he would still be neglecting his responsibliity as a parent and it would still be completely up to the parents of the son to decide if it is something they deem appropriate!  Just because the dad happens to be gay, he is not exempt from proper parenting!|`|O3EtP4vOaa	I am wondering if you are thinking this is bad because the two men involved are gay or because he will be spending the night with his 14 yr old girlfriend.  I ask because you sound more concerned about the first (non) issue.  Just because the two men are gay does not mean that they are going to make a move on your nephew, and it is insulting to any person that reads this.<br>  <br>  Now...if you have the issue with the sleep over in general then I understand that.  But I will say if these two kids are going to have sex then they are going to do it wether its after school at your sister's 's house, behind the bleechers, in a car, or at her fathers home.  Chances are they will not do it at the home of the father while they are home, and they are sleeping in separate rooms.  At least you will know where they are and that they are safe.|`|SWOeg0jFaa	I completely agree with Blondie.<br>  <br>  It sounds like the biggest reason you/your sister are uncomfortable with this is because these men are gay? Now it's understandable that you don't really want your nephew sleeping over with his girlfriend but I think, depending on how much your sister trusts her son, that it would be ok in this situation. After all, the man has called you up to let you know that they will be supervised and not sleeping in the same room, plus he's done it before and everyone was responsible about it. It all comes down to you/your sister's judgment and decision in the end though. I just think you are being a tad bit biast because they are gay.....<br>  <br>  * some of these answers are ridiculous and insulting|`|T0NvgQTUaa	My boyfriends parents never had a problem with us spending the night together, even in the same bed. My parents had big issues with it. The only time we were allowed to spend the night was if it was safer than going home. Like if the weather was too bad to drive or if we were too tired to drive. <br>  Occasionally i went on vacation with his family and no one had a problem with it. My parents always thought i had my own bed though.|`|rn5VVojAaa	Be safe, keep them apart!|`|aOCfLAJJaa	The only reason teens have sex is because of films like Juno and Superbad. If we didn't surroned them with it, they wouldn't do it. <br>  <br>  I've slept in the same room with a girl and we have NEVER had sexual intercouse.|`|H2IqzG12aa	It's probably OK since they're chaperoned. But my gut says it's too much togetherness for 14-15 year olds.
ROJans2Taa	I honestly dont believe the fetus could grow without a heartbeat, I did a little searching, because I was curious and found numerous posts on other sites with women having the same problem and by 12 weeks a heart beat is found, the fact that your baby is growing is a real positive sign, if it was just the sac, id say im sorry but it;'s over, because I was diagnosed with a blighted ovum where my sac kept growing but no baby, I had my last scan at 8 weeks before I accepted it, and by that point my sac was showing signs of deteriorating, best luck|`|def5d056753c507adaad1d31c72512beaa	theres no way a dead baby could continue to grow, some keep hope your baby is ok, i have a tilted uterus to, and at 6 weeks we seen the heartbeat, its raelly big on the baby. at 9 weeks we listened to hearbeat via doppler, your baby might not be turned right, or im really not sure, i pray for the best for you, keep hope if the baby is still growing, at 10 weeks go to dr and have them check w/ a doppler for the heartbeat.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|AA11220327	it all depends on the position of the uterus and the position and size of the baby. with this pregnancy they were unable to get the clear heartbeat untill 13 weeks. You are still very, very early, so there is nothing to worry about at this point if baby is growing.|`|NE96fU9vaa	it may be too soon, youre baby is very young, also, since youre uterous is tipped, it may be harder for the instruments to read a heartbeat, especially this soon.<br>  Wow, one of my pregnancies, i didnt know i was pregnant till the 4th month|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	If your baby is measuring on track each time I wouldn't worry, you'll find the heartbeat. I've never heard of that before. But the grownth is more important.
215dfe0c283eb141a2ed0b4dcb32274caa	With my first child I worked part-time and was put on "home-rest" at 35 weeks. I was induced at 38 weeks due to PIH. I went back to work when she was 10 weeks old. A total of 13 weeks off with short-term disability pay which was 80% of my salary and for the other 20% of my salary I used my vacation pay.<br>  <br>  With my second child I stopped working at 39 weeks, they were pushing me too hard and I was exhausted. She was born at 40 weeks, 3 days. She had to have surgery at 10 days old due to a blocked ureter. I returned to work when she was 14 weeks old. So a total of about 16 weeks. Again 80% of my salary from STD up to 18 weeks of leave.<br>  <br>  I am a SAHM now so no maternity leave from work!|`|cY8DgJv5aa	I only got payed maternity leave with one of my jobs.  The first place I worked while pregnant didn't offer it, but the place I worked at with my second pregnancy offered it by way of 'short term disability'.  There were conditions you had to meet and it was something that I payed for in addition to my regular insurance.  With my first pregnancy, I worked until my due date.  I delivered 2 weeks later and took 6 weeks off after that (you can't return to work until after 6 weeks).  With my second, I took my maternity leave 2 weeks before my due date.  That was not covered of course.  It wasn't until I actually had my child that the maternity leave officially started.  Again, I got 6 weeks leave.... payed this time though.  I don't like discussing my finances (that's my personal business), but I will tell you that I got payed a percentage of what I would have made if I had been working that whole time.  If I remember correctly, I got payed 75% of what my paycheck would have been if I had worked a typical 40 hour work week.|`|jk6ayFUmaa	i get paid 6 weeks unless my doc makes me stay outta work longer i get up to  12 weeks if on docs orders. i am thinking of trying to take about a week off before my due date just to relax   well try to. but i am using vacation pay for that week|`|AA12227599	I worked with all 4 until my due date. The money depends on where you work, and what their policies on maternity leave are. If you live overseas you could take as much time as you need , but not here.|`|6j9y0q5Zaa	Well im due on monday and my last day of work is today. I get paid for 4 weeks. Guess better than nothing. Legally they dont have to pay you maternity leave.|`|A1S5KNUkaa	I'm hoping to work until 12 days before my due date just so I can be at home getting everything ready for when my little man arrives but this is dependant on my SPD and whether I'll still be comfortable working until then.  I don't plan on leaving any earlier than 36 weeks.<br>  <br>  I'll have 39 weeks of maternity leave paid at 90% of my basic wage.|`|4jW9rERFaa	First child, I worked until I was 8 months pregnant. I was working on my feet with no breaks! So at 8 months I had enough and let the bosses know it was time for me to stop working completely. I had the weeks until I had my daughter off. Then an additional 6 weeks after she was born. Had I not worked on my feet I could have stayed a lot longer. With the second I had stopped a lot earlier. I was working on my feet again and then also was required to work on my hands and knees. So I think I quit at like 7.5 months along.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	I don't get anything. I am a contractor meaning they give me a contract to work for a few months and hopefully it gets extended. If it gets extended then I keep working for them if it doesn't then I'm out of a job so I don't get any benefits. No medical, vacation, sick days, any time I take off is unpaid and I don't get maternity leave or anything. The only good thing is I work from home so while I'll have to work soon after having the baby I'll still get to be home with him or her.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	i went to work the day before i had my son. started my maternity leave the day i had him.  and i took almost 2 months, by choice.<br>  <br>  <br>  but thats because i had a super easy job and being at work didn't cause me any stress and i sat down the whole time i was there and could get up and go to the bathroom when ever i needed and do what i wanted.<br>  <br>  so it just depends on your pregnancy and your job. discuss it with your doctor when the best time would be for you.|`|uuHPneEcaa	u can work up to ur due date if u like.. it really depends on u. U know ur body.. If u feel u can go on any more then u might have to take it sooner. <br>  <br>  I am 33 weeks and a few days..

mf3OOagMaa	The best things you can do for her is:<br>  <br>  1. Listen to her when she needs to talk<br>  2. Don't let her pressure you into following her footsteps - you have to be you, which means you have to do the things that are right for you. Lead, don't follow<br>  3. Talk to a trusted - nuetral - adult. Perhaps a school guidance counsellor for advice and help in keeping your friend safe. They can be the middle-man when it comes to intervening with her parents - so that she doesn't think you sold her out.<br>  <br>  Finally, and you will find this throughout life - sometimes we outgrow our friends - it may be time to start developing other friendships. You do not have to totally abandon this one - but you may need the relief of being around people that you have more in common with.  Good luck - it isn't easy being your age!|`|hkZlmIjGaa	Ok first u have 2 talk 2 her and make her go get a pregnancy test 2 be sure.

The best way to be her friend is to lead by example.  That means that you need to stay away from trouble and let her choose if she wants to continue in her ways or stay friends with you and calm down.  Don't let her pull you down.  Once you lose your virginity, you can't get it back.|`|AA11176438	well if u think she is gettin wild maybe u should jus talk to her bout this... its the best thing for u to do as her friend... and as for her bein pregnant thats somethin she will have to live with|`|BtxQogSzaa	Just talk..tell her if shes pregnant you'll stick by her and always be her friend...thats best kind of friend you can be|`|kynzqmWgaa	Help how?

I surely would not buy him a ring, unless he asked for one?  Normally guys don't wear that or engagement rings.  Maybe take him out to eat at a nice restaurant or buy him a watch.<br>  <br>  I wore mine on my ring finger on my left hand.<br>  <br>  (Since when did a promise ring mean abstinence?--the poster said something about that a few below me.  I thought a promise ring meant that you promised to marry that person later on in life.  That's what mine meant to us.  A few days after I got it, my husband now, said "It is a promise ring, because if you break up with me, you promise to give it back."  Of course, it was a joke. <br>   I have heard of getting a promise ring from your parents meaning you were not going to have sex before you were married, though.)|`|hvghGmzAaa	get him a mans ring like this:<br>  <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=10746009" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...</a><br>  <br>  they have many other styles two, it's cute with an engraved message|`|n6IBfiDPaa	I wore my promise ring on my ring finger.<br>  I think thats where you are supposed to wear it.<br>  And I know a lot of guys that have promise rings I think its a cute idea<br>  You could get a band and have it engraved on the inside|`|Rhr1umV1aa	Guys don't generally wear them. Some men do, especially if the woman is very jealous and has to show that he is taken. I am not really sure what you would get him if you didn't get him a ring. But it's like, when you get married what is he going to do with that ring? He has to wear his wedding ring. Also if he is in construction then he can't wear it anyways. Certain jobs are dangerous for him to wear anything like that and that is expensive. As far as what you wear it on, you do wear it on your ring finger, just be sure to tell them it is a promise ring.|`|Vrzn4r8Qaa	My boyfriend gave me one too. I wear it on my ring finger. But you can wear it on any finger you want, I guess. But I was thinking the same thing, if I should buy him a ring or not.

When its cold its too big for my ring finger so I wear it on my right hand. :P
EcQeNu3raa	If its preeclampsia depending on how severe it is they will want to deliver quickly. As far as the BH contractions, they do tend to get more uncomfortable, but they shouldn't hurt. Those sharp pains are just the stretching of the uterus. I have them all the time. Just lay down and rest and drink a glass of water and you should be fine. However, preeclampsia is nothing to mess around with so yes, please keep your appointment and voice your concerns to your doc. Good luck.|`|AA11011411	Get to the doctor and get your blood pressure checked, and do it now.  It's not worth taking any risk over. Good luck!|`|Oq2B7I4faa	I had preeclampcia with this pregnancy too.  They too found out on my 35 weeks appointment.  They found a protein in my urine and I had high BP also I had gain 3lb in 6 days.  Normally I only gain 1/2 lb per week.  Anyway she gave me 24 hour urine test and told me to bed rest till I reach 37 week and sleep on my either left or right sides.  She also told me that if I get headache or blurry vision either call her or go to ER.  I was not allow to walk or do any house work.  Anyway with bed rest everything is back on track.  My BP is low and my protein level in my urine is very low too.  Right now I am 38 week tomorrow and she said after this week I can move around so I will go on labor naturally.  <br>  So my suggestion to you is that bed rest bed rest and bed rest.  It really will help you.|`|7bdhpvc9aa	Sounds like preeclampsia to me but not sure. Good Luck & God Bless
af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	Well if he didn't ejaculate in you chances are rare, but you are having sex so as long as you are having sex there is always that chance of being pregnant. If you are that concerned about being late I suggest taking a pregnancy test you are already 8 days late don't hesitate any longer hun. Pregnancy symptoms and period symptoms are alike for the most part but yes it's normal to have a delayed period it can happen to anyone. You're better off testing already though good luck sweetie|`|B6Mfx5fUaa	If your late, take a test.  That's the only way to find out...|`|tIFDvOVBaa	WAIT A WEEK N TAKE A PREGNANCY TEST OR GO DOCS N GET A BLOOD TEST|`|Xut99HtWaa	i think that you should wait a couple more weeks. sometimes i am late. then if you still havent got it, i would day go to the doctor, being that home pregnancy tests dont always work|`|AA11964833	Why dont you just go nd take a preggo test its not that hard then tell us all duh!!!!|`|um8IIEn8aa	BITCHES NEED TO STOP ASKING US IF THEY ARE PREGO AND JUST GO TAKE A GODDAMN TEST!|`|B3uY3lRlaa	I dont know... but do we look like pregnancy tests? :P lol

xRZ1PRZwaa	Hi Mummy! It sounds like spit-up, not throw-up. Spitting up IS normal for most babies at some time or another. Some babies spit up all the time. That's why we have burp pads, receiving blankets and dirty mommy shoulders!<br>  <br>  Your little guy likes to eat and eats a bit too much sometimes. That's all. It's not a big deal or anything to worry about. Just keep some extra receiving blankets handy to wipe his little mouth, and your shirt, pants, arms and neck!<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!|`|4SKIE1C8aa	As long as his doctors say he's fine and he continues to gain weight then there's no worries! You could talk to the doctor if you're concerned about milk allergies and consider trying him out on soy formula but don't switch, especially if you're breastfeeding, unless your doc says it's a good idea.|`|EOyujCyBaa	in my opinion your little one has reflux, my 11 wk old has it too.. it happens when the milk hits the stomach and like projectile vomit just comes straight back up, my health visitor advised me too sit him upright in his bouncer after a feed and this did help somewhat, also i used to change his nappy after every feed but now i do it before as when u lie them down on their backs after a feed it seems to come up more.. theres noting much else you can do about it but iv been told that when they go on solids it will stop as the solids are heavier and harder to come up.. my doc also told me that if the problem was not getting better and became severe that they would prescibe baby gaviscon to add to his bottle and that would keep it down, maybe you could ask your doc about this?|`|OBU1eDUHaa	My son did the same thing.  He would spit up so much that I had to change his bib 3-5 times a day, clothes 2 times a day, my clothes at least once a day.  We went through sooooo many burb rags too.  I kept telling my MD also but he said as long as he was happy he was fine, all babies spit up.  Finally after about 5 months at a check up I started crying when he spit up all over my work clothes.  The MD asked me what we had been giving him for his acid reflux.  I was stunned, not one person had ever mentioned reflux!  Check out the website I added to see if this fits your baby.  He may just be a spitter, but it never hurts to mention it to the MD, especially if you come prepared (knowing your signs/symptoms of reflux).  Are you breast feeding?  If not, there are tons of formula that can help with reflux. Good luck!|`|jSqUmFJJaa	My daughter was the exact same way... and my wife and I were worried just like you are.  A couple of things we did that helped:<br>  <br>  If you aren't breastfeeding, try switching to soy formula.  It smells disgusting, and her burps were absolutely rancid, but she stopped spitting up so much.<br>  <br>  Don't lay him flat on his back when feeding.  Keep him slightly upright... not sitting straight up, but just a little upright.  That seemed to help a lot.<br>  <br>  Get some gas drops for him.  Give him a small dose right after feeding.  That way whatever gas he doesn't let go will be handled by the drops.<br>  <br>  My daughter is now 14 mos. and weighs 23.5 lbs.  She stopped spitting up so much when we started doing these things.  It still happened, but not after EVERY feeding.<br>  <br>  Best of luck, hope this helps.  Keep your chin up, and enjoy your son.
vffZ3is4aa	he either has a problem (you didn't indicate if he has had a problem in the past). or he has a fetish. Do you really want to know if your son has a diaper or baby fetish?<br>  I am sure that if he has a problem with wetting the bed, when he gets older, he will seek medical attention on his own.|`|oVxr5B3Eaa	If he's old enough to go out and buy adult diapers and take care of the problem without your help, he's old enough to go see a doctor when he's ready. Asking him about it is only going to humiliate him, and he's clearly trying to keep it a secret. <br>  He could lose his respect for you hint that you might be snooping (even if your not). <br>  <br>  I think you should just let it go. Maybe he's seeing a doctor or a school nurse or someone without you knowing if he's mature enough to go and get adult diapers. <br>  <br>  OR maybe he was just having wet dreams if he is a teen :P|`|B6Mfx5fUaa	I would definitely confront him in the most compassionate way there is.   You need to take him to a doctor, something is not right.|`|ddP3klT3aa	I think he should see a dr.|`|zBKUS5hxaa	I would do nothing for the moment.  Give him some privacy unless this becomes a problem beyond finding diapers.  As a teenager he may just be experimenting/playing/fooling around.  If there is a larger issue, you'll know about it soon enough.|`|qElPexStaa	that's hard, I would say confront him even though he might feel some what humiliated because if you can treat it for him, it's worth it because he's going to be leaving in a few years and that's not a problem you want going into adult hood|`|AA11510145	I would say that you make an appointment with the doctor for a "annual physical" tell your son you just want to get him a physical. <br>  <br>  Do not tell the doctor about this! Tell your son ahead of time that because he is growing up you are going tolet him go into the exam room by himself so he should think of any questions he has for the doctor. tell him that if he has any questions or concerns he should not be embarrassed to talk with the doctor or nurse because these people have heard and seen everything (make a little joke about it). <br>  <br>  Then send him in alone and do not push him for details when he gets out.|`|K1oOQqqVaa	Confront - no.  Compassionately, discretely and sensitively discuss in order to help find a solution - yes.|`|sHBPfItfaa	ahhhhhhhhhhhahahahahhaha.<br>  well thats embarrasing, i think you should talk to him about it and not confront the world :P<br>  plus, who knows hes a teenager could be something for a prank, or to give a friend for his bday as a joke.

Nothing with nuts, including peanutbutter, egg whites or honey until a year as well. Be careful with egg yolk though, Even with hard boiling it and removing a yolk, the small amount of egg white on it still makes my baby sick!|`|zQAWuMN4aa	They say that no spinach until after 8 months. My daughter's ped said no strawberries til after a year because of allergies but I know they make strawberry baby foods. I used to work at a daycare and a child there was allergic to strawberries (nasty rash). No egg whites; yolks are fine.<br>  <br>  wholesomebabyfood.com or even do a google search on them.<br>  <br>  EDIT2: Corn is fine. I never heard of allergy info abt that. At least my daughter never had any problems. And when she was old enough I started giving her yogurt & she had no milk issues with that. No honey though because of possible botulism.

Prunes don't either contrary to what some may believe. My daughter loves them. Instead of buying the jar prunes I buy Organic dried prunes, soak a few in boiling water that I just boiled in the microwave, for say, abt 10 min. take them out & puree them in Magic Bullet or whatever you have. You will need to add some of the water where they came out of.<br>  <br>  EDIT again:  Peaches aren't really in season yet. I've been using fresh peaches even though they're not in season. You just have to watch. Sometimes there might not be any good ones. I have used blueberries as well & they were fine. I froze the rest which works out well for me. You can use frozen fruit or veggies, nothing wrong w/that. I've used canned, fresh & frozen items before. Just have to watch you don't overcook anything so the nutrients don't drain out.

467be00aa9eff8cd86b019690cc79aa4aa	It sounds like you are pregnant. You can get many false positives, but you almost never get a false positive. Good Luck!|`|0iUxfCMcaa	any line even faint ones means you are pregnant. you had 4 positives so congratz. morning urine is always the best, plus the faint line just means your hormones are not very high yet. wait a few days and take a test first thing in the morning and the line should be darker.|`|nISYAHkfaa	I think you are pregnant also. Another thought, if you have been testing a lot today, you may have diluted your urine by drinking a lot of water, and that can cause there to not be enough pregnancy hormones for the test to read positive. I'd wait until tomorrow first thing in the morning to take another, or go to a planned parenthood center and get a urine test done there.<br>  <br>  Congrats. =)|`|AA11916244	Yea your pregnant. Your urine was probably diluted so the hormones werent showing up. It is almost impossible to get a false positive. When your that early the hormones havent had time to build up so your urine dilutes more easily. I mean look how many pregnancy tests you took yesterday. Congrats|`|tQPvv0Glaa	I would say you are pregnant - Congrats!!  4 positives vs. 1 negative is pretty telling.  Besides, it is extremely rare to get a false positive but very common to get a false negative.

IybV1Enwaa	What I was told by doctors that kids fall sick more often from 9 months to 2 years. Your younger one is in that age range. 7 year old has now crossed that age. <br>  <br>  My elder one is about 7 now. She used to fall sick very often at around 1-2. Many ear infections, cold , cough etc etc. But she was a premature baby and I breastfed her only up to six-seven months. Part of the reason was Daycare as well. <br>  <br>  <br>  Younger one in now 26 months. She is better in health. Full term. Breastfed till 1 year. No daycare so far.<br>  <br>  <br>  So there are multiple factors. When your younger one gets little older you might want to put him into physical exercise routine and it really helps a lot. Try to give him opportunity for some physical activities even now. As the other person has said here.. Washing hands multiple times a day also helps. Teach him how to wash hands, pulling the sleeves up, washing hands and drying.  I know it is difficult , but fresh fruit juice (homemade) helps develop immunity. Try to do that.|`|ddP3klT3aa	Because your oldest has developed immunity to these illnesses but he is bringing them home from school to your youngest. Make sure they both wash their hands often and they are clean. Sheets need to be changed weekly also.|`|DXzUCgj8aa	maybe you youngest has a weak immunsystem while your oldest has a good one
46cd2ca02c07674e58e26d9c11367762aa	With both of my daughters,  I felt a bit sick, I had very very sore boobs, I had headaches, and I peed frequently. When I got pregnant with my son and felt NOTHING, I thought something was wrong. It just turns out that with my son I didnt have very many symptoms. Same as this pregnancy. Im 19 weeks, and I feel nothing. I know baby is fine because I can feel him or her kick. <br>  Thats the weird thing about pregnancy, while one pregnancy can make you sick as a dog, the next one youll feel great. Good luck with testing, I hope you get the answer you want!|`|uuHPneEcaa	I was fine in the beginning.. but then like around when my period was about to start. I began feeling like I was hungry all the time. I have very sore boobs, very tired, i went to the rest room all the time, and i was kind of cranky..  SO when my period never showed up, i waited a few days it never came. so I took the test and it was positive (i was 5 days late)<br>  <br>  But all women are different. If ur period doesn't show in the next few days then I would take a pregnancy test. good luck to u and lots and lots of baby dust!|`|467be00aa9eff8cd86b019690cc79aa4aa	Yes, with my second pregnancy the only way I knew was I skipped my menstrual cycle. With my first I had extreme morning sickness so I knew. Good Luck!|`|mc6YtaRbaa	That early I was just tired. I thought I was trying to fight off a cold or something because I was sleepy. That was my only sign for the first couple weeks. My boobs never got sore, the only time they didn't feel right was for a couple weeks (I think around weeks 8-10) when I took my bra off to go to bed they hurt a little so I bought a bra with no under wires and wore that to bed for those weeks and it went away.|`|nISYAHkfaa	Only pregnancy symptom I had last time (when pregnant with twins) was increased appetite, I even had my period regularly for a while! lol<br>  <br>  So yeah, it's possible, take a test. =)|`|ddP3klT3aa	I never had pregnancy symptoms.

C4miEeuYaa	He'll grow, I promise! Some babies grow wide before they grow long. All babies are different. Don't worry! :)|`|9qqzRTpDaa	My answer is that Babies have little muscle control and I suppose if you gently stretched his little leg you would see that he is longer than you think...right now they just kind of curl up and hold things close in to them...until they learn to control their movements better then you will see his length and height more...not to worry...he is just the way he is suppose to be...|`|dgRTkccBaa	Most babies (especially babies as young as yours) are roly-poly looking, that's just how babies are.  they don't start to thin out and look more like a kid until they get to be about 2 or 3 years old.<br>  If you look at clothes made for babies under a year old they all look sort of shrt and wide because they're cut for a baby's build.  If you compare them to toddler clothes (like a size 2T or 3T) those are cut much taller and thineer because that's about the age that their bodies start to change and get less 'baby-like'.|`|CJvHQl5vaa	Because he is a baby.  He isn't going to have a body type like yours for many, many years.  As a matter of fact, the doctor would be concerned if he was getting long and skinny.<br>  <br>  Expect to go through cycles where he gets plump, then he goes through a time where he starts behaving differently and suddenly gets bigger.  The "behaving differently" part is where he will get cranky or moody because he is growing and that makes you ache, which is why they call them "growing pains."  As he grows he may seem to thin out a little.  Then he will start getting plumper again, and then he will get bigger again.  These things are called growth spurts.  They are pretty cool, actually.  Our friend has a 6 month old and we see them nearly every weekend for breakfast.  Some weeks, having only seen the baby 7 days earlier, there is a HUGE change in her body composition.<br>  <br>  When your kiddo turns from a pre-schooler to a little boy, you will start noticing a bunch of traits that belong to you and your boyfriend that you hadn't seen before.<br>  <br>  Beware, though, that the growth spurt cycle continues on up through and including puberty.  One minute you think your kid is getting a little heavy, and the next morning he will have outgrown his jeans and sneakers.  This is one good reason to never make fun of a child's weight.  Gaining a few pounds is a good thing if it is part of a growth spurt!|`|NroZQN5vaa	Once he starts moving, he'll thin out. My daughter was the same way and as soon as she started crawling, she kept getting taller but she stopped gaining weight. She's only gained 9 ounces in the past 4 or 5 months. And when she starts walking, she might lose a little too. The doctor said it's normal, though.|`|LUjCnYmoaa	don't worry, he will grow, he has been crammed in a tummy for 9 months so his legs are still a little bowed. our 9 month old is still short and my wife and i have some size to us. <br>  He will grow soon enough don't worry|`|54OjRZm8aa	My baby girl is almost a year now she has 17 more days to go.<br>  She is only 16 pounds and 27 inches.<br>  She was 6 pounds 11 ounces and 18 inches at birth.<br>  At 5 months she was still pretty tiny.<br>  Some babies take longer to grow. I noticed my baby will go through like 2 weeks of sleeping a lot throughout the day, and then all of a sudden she will hit a growth spurt. Im 5'9, 128 pounds. My fiance is 5'11 145 pounds. But his sister and mom is really short. So there's no telling when or if ever she will be as tall as us. All people are different. If your really worried take her in for a check up and tell the doctor your concerns. I figured out at 2 months old my girl has PDA a heart defect and it stunts her growth. If your baby has it he is probably still young enough to take the medicine for it. I don't mean to worry you on that part but it could be it. I hope I helped you in some way :)|`|l79QIWszaa	The CDC has growth charts on their website; the same ones used at the doctor's office.  Measure him and put him on the chart under his age.  You'll get to see where he's at.  "Short looking" means nothing.  My husband and I are short and our son is 8 months and in the 75 percentile for length.  Talk to you physician if you're worried.|`|cadaf08b5e2b5ca7fea1ef6cb7035c53aa	Congratulations!  He's totally normal.   Babies grow at different rates and ways.   He's adding pounds, which is what matters.  He'll stretch that weight into height when his pituitary gland says to.<br>  <br>  BTW, try not to compare him too much to you both.  He's his own person and when you mix DNA you don't always come up with equal representation in apparent DNA traits.   Sometimes the grand parents or even cousins DNA can provide dominant traits.<br>  <br>  Like my eyes are green, even though my Mom's are navy and my Dad's were brown.   I have eyes identical to my great aunt.|`|xV0APOtaaa	Don't worry about it yet. Many baby's get "chunky" they will grow into it. I had a cousin that at 1 yr he weighed about 30 pounds or so. If you look at him now he is 27, 6'1" and very thin and fit.<br>  <br>  My daughter was 22 lbs at her 12 month check-up and only 29% on the growth chart. She is 2 now and is only up to 30 lbs and is 69% on the growth chart (34 inches tall). If you and your boyfriend are both tall and thin, your son probably will be too just give him a little time.|`|vCq3dR40aa	Babies normally grow in two separate and distinct stages.  The stages can come in either order and normally it is the same order each growth spurt.<br>  1.  Fatten up<br>  2.  Sprout.<br>  <br>  Perhaps your baby is a fatter than a sprouter.  Mine is.<br>  <br>  If he is not putting on weight, see a doc.|`|mX3J70YJaa	Everything is fine! Most babies get cubby when they grow. you will relize that soon that he well start to streach out and get thinner. So there is nothing to worrie about! Just wait and you will see.|`|g9TxgMlwaa	because he's still growing. Give it time. He's still a baby. Sheesh.

I bet the real story is not that some doctors will do it for free, but that some insurance companies will cover the cost after that many C-sections.

4t5eGShiaa	First off.. Congrats on your little one! Now here are my answers...<br>  <br>  1) Is this harmful to my little man? <br>  <br>  It can be if you do not actively control it. <br>  <br>  2) Will I have to have him early if he gets too big? <br>  <br>  You have a higher chance in having to deliver via C-section if your baby gets too big. My doctors had scheduled me to be induced 2 weeks before my due date because they thought my little guy would get too big. <br>  <br>  3) What causes it? <br>  <br>  Lots of things. Just because you are "diabetic" does not mean you eat sugar and sweets all day long. You body is just not producing enough insulin to break down the sugars you intake. The extra sugar mainly comes from Carbs and Sugars.<br>  <br>  4) I know it can be controlled by diet but what diet??? I already dont have much sugar in my diet. <br>  <br>  Cut back on your carbs. Eat more fiber. Have smaller meals more frequently. WALKING after each meal helps your body breakdown any extra sugar that your insulin can not handle.<br>  <br>  5) Why cant pregnancies be straight forward.<br>  <br>  Life wouldn't be as exciting! LOL<br>  <br>  6) Should I be feeling upset? Just feel like its all going wrong.<br>  <br>  I know how you feel.. when I found out I had GD I though everything was going to go wrong. I was soo afraid for my little baby. But listen... it's okay to feel upset, but don't let it consume you. Be strong for your little guy. Stress is no good for you or your little one.<br>  <br>  Good luck! Everything will be fine!|`|rHufcHwHaa	sugar comes from carbs as well--so any breads or grains  you eat will contribute to diabetic problems.<br>  <br>  if he gets too big you may deliver early--it depends on how developed his lungs, etc. are.  What may be a problem is delivering naturally..you may need to opt for a C-section.  <br>  <br>  I'd wait to talk to the dietitian.  She may give you insulin to take, or she may talk to you about modifying your carb intake.  <br>  <br>  As for what causes it, your body will stop regulating your sugar intake when you're pregnant, and all of the calories from the sugar/carbs will go directly to the baby, making him gain weight faster. <br>  <br>  Good luck with everything!|`|AA10469473	Hang in there.  It's very normal to worry when you're pregnant, and having something like this turn up just adds to that.  Plus IVF moms have gone through a lot to get pregnant in the first place, so that just adds to it.  But it really isn't "all going wrong", and this isn't nearly as big an issue as you feel like it is right now, it's pretty common - if the person you saw had had more time and/or more empathy, he might have given you a better feel for what's happening.  Hopefully the people you see on Monday will have more info for you, and allay your fears a bit.<br>  <br>  Fortunately you are pretty far along,so even if they want you to deliver early, things will likely be OK.  Try not to worry (I know, easy to say, harder to do).  One thing I saw mentioned in a couple articles is the possibility of jaundice for the baby, but they treat that easily - my grandson, also an IVF baby, ended up back in the hospital with jaundice for a couple days shortly after he came home, but has no lasting effects even though his parents were panicked for awhile.<br>  <br>  Pregnancies just aren't straightforward. But then again, neither is raising kids, so get used to it.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|NE96fU9vaa	i had and you just have to eat right, if you dont you could stay sick youre whole pregnancy, and youre baby will be too large to deliver, naturally. So, stay with the diet, eat what youre supposed to, you probable wont have to take insulin, unless you cant control youre sugar with diet.|`|HW89eJEZaa	i had it with 3 of my preg., it is not harmful if you keep it under control. if you stick to your diet and keep an eye out on your sugar readings, you should be fine. it is not just sugar you have to watch, you have to watch your carb intake too. sugars, carbs, starches, are just a few of the things that can cause your sugar to go up. it is just a matter of knowing what to eat and the right time of day to eat it, if you need more info, or just need someone to explain things, you can contact me!|`|dXMdt3gVaa	I also had gestational diabetes and was SO ANGRY when I found out I had it because I had thought I was being very careful and safe monitoring my weight. I dont take over the counter medications or anything when I am pregnant. I keep my body full of only wholesome and mostly natural foods. So how could I get it? Well the main problem (when I saw the dietician and analysed my diet) was that I had not been eating enough protein, so as a result I had been overdoing it on the carbohydrates. All carbohydrates break down into sugars. So although I was eating a lot of fruit and thinking this was healthy, my body wasnt metabolising the fruit like it should have been. So I had to change what carbohydrates I eat, and add in a lot of protein. I did get a glucose meter and diligently pricked my finger and kept a food diary. My glucose levels were constant and safe by changing my diet so I did not require insulin and the baby was healthy and had a normal weight. <br>  <br>  If youre 32 weeks you only have 8 more weeks where you have to keep to a very strict diet to keep the baby healthy, so its really beneficial that you do that. <br>  <br>  The sugar fluctuations are harmful to your little guy because his body will start producing more insulin. Insulin is a growth hormone so like you said, he can get too big. Bigger babies have trouble breathing. If he gets too large you may have to have a c-section. When hes born he will have to have blood sugars done on him too! <br>  <br>  It is caused by the stress of pregnancy on your body, especially on your pancreas. Youre more likely to get GD if youre overweight, over the age of 25, and if this is your second pregnancy. It can happen in your first pregnancy as well. <br>  <br>  It can be controlled by diet and exercise. Exercise helps your body metabolise the sugars as well as regulates your insulin levels. <br>  <br>  If you just follow what they say, you and your little guy should be fine. Just be very very strict.<br>  <br>  Also bare in mind this predisposes you to later complications with type 2 diabetes. So a lot of people say oh dont worry, once you have the baby you will be fine, it goes away. But long term you could have trouble. So especially for me this was a positive thing because it really forced me to look at what I eat and to become more healthy. I am a bit overweight but not much. So I kept looking at fatter people and thinking I was not so bad. But having this happen I have learnt more about how your body uses food and how you need to eat balanced meals.|`|bibQ4uOEaa	My daughter had it with her last child. She had to give herself insulin shots every day but as soon as the baby was born it was gone. That was 16 years ago and both of them are fine. She also had a normal birth.|`|DZ9sDyDhaa	I feel your pain I took my test a month ago and they called back and said I was fine then monday they called me and said I had gd. I was so upset because I could have been getting help. I went to see the doctor at a high risk clinic yesterday and she said that I did not have it. I was so scared but she answered my questions better than my original doctor. She said that had I had it as long as I would have stick to the diet and got regular checkups I would be fine. Sorry could not answer your questions but I would not worry you don't need anymore stress I know I don't. good luck

379adf8ec6ff418678fc28b78cee178baa	Amanda has the right idea! That is pretty much exactly what i did with my daughter. I refused to have a 3 year old with a binky! I actually just gathered them all up and threw them away and told her that the fairy came and took them all and instead left her a big girl toy, which was a princess scooter. She was so excited! She cried a little the first night but she got over it. We prepped my daughter well in advance and told her for a few weeks that the binky fairy was going to come soon. She didn't like the idea but when she saw that scooter she forgot all about the binky! Its something that you just have to do. Good luck!|`|NbJbZXtGaa	Cold Turkey. Gather them all up, wrap them like a gift (in a box) and leave them out at night for the Binky Fairy. Then, the Binky Fairy takes them while your daughter is asleep and leaves a small "big girl" gift in their place. If your daughter begs, whines, or cries, you just remind her that the Binky Fairy took them.<br>  <br>  Make sure you actually throw them all in the garbage so you are not tempted top backslide at all. Once they are gone, it HAS to be for good, or it will just get harder.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|Ki5xSgmGaa	My twins were the just like your daughter.  They could not go to sleep without it and one would wake up and cry at night if it fell out.  I was reluctant to take it away because they were so dependent on it but I finally  did it at 3 1/2.  I pretended that I couldn't find any binkys in the house, we lost it, etc.  They cried hard going to sleep for one night then the next few nights just wimpered a little.  It was much easier than I thought it would be.  My advice, just take it away and see what happens.|`|h93SVSxLaa	have her throw it out or "donate" it. at the age she is she can understand giving it to someone else that needs it more than her... (obviously youre not really going to but you get the point) have her gather them all up and put them in a bag and take them some where... call before hand and let them in on whats going on so they can keep it going with you. I've been with friends who's kids were attatched the same way..Mine lost theirs at 6 months...anyway you will have a rough night or two after wards but she'll get over it! tell her shes a big girl and helpingother people and it'll pass. GL!|`|387493774383e79967205158ff9bb074aa	Since she is 3 you could try "losing it" and explain the her that its gone and lost.

jSqUmFJJaa	I don't see a problem with it at all.  I would do the same thing.<br>  <br>  The thing is... everyone thinks they are right as a parent... and they may be, for their children.  You did nothing wrong, you are raising your kids the way you want to raise them.  They were in no apparent danger.  Next time something like this happens just smile and nod and know that you are doing what you think is right.|`|811921e95b3795dad10075b3f9e12029aa	You are right to let them walk by themselves.

I wanted them to learn to stay with me and close to me without having the restriction of me holding their hands or them holding onto the cart/stroller.

I could see why people would express their concerns (although im sure it felt like you being attacked)  if you were in a parking lot. Now granted your children might be behaved but even the most well behaved children have their moments and the people Probably thought it wasnt the safest time to allow your kids to walk side by side instead of holding on to your buggy.

I would have turned around and asked: "Did I ask your opinion"? Wtf? You are right and they are wrong ! Period.|`|EEP5Z4muaa	You've got a lot of responses here because you've hit a nerve!<br>  <br>  I have a 5 year old and a very nearly 3 year old who now mostly walks along beside me.  If I am out most of the day I take the pushchair along in case he gets tired, but he is so very independent and very stubborn at times that if  we are going to have an "issue" with him either holding the pushchair side or my hand I allow him to walk sensibly alongside me, or just in front, if he then starts being silly like running ahead then he gets one warning and if it continues he then has to go in the pushchair, or walk holding hands.  <br>  <br>  My eldest is very good and I can trust him to always listen to me and would never dream of crossing the road without me etc.  If you know your children as you do then you know what you can trust them with, I always have to have hawk eyes on my youngest because he is a little monkey - but he knows there are consequences and I believe this is teaching him to behave responsibly, or  he doesn't get the freedom he desires! <br>  <br>  I would have liked to have seen you try to have had the two toddlers walking holding onto the double pushchair, especially if it is a "side buy side" style!  You would never have managed to negotiate the paths, those same people who felt the need to comment on your choice would have also been the people who would have tutted had you had them either side of the pushchair and taking up the whole path I bet, you can't win!<br>  <br>  No matter how you plan your outings I always find that you get "looks" from people as they judge your decisions.  I had an old lady once lie to me that my youngest was getting upset in the car as I was getting a parking ticket from a machine, just two cars away.  I had made the decision that he was safer in the car (strapped in his seat) than out in a busy car park when I wouldn't be able to have absolute concentration on him whilst I worked the machine.  So of course I rush back and low and behold he is quite happy playing with one of his toys not in the least concerned.  It's just ridiculous.  I know how you feel, as I am sure many of us harassed mothers do!! Chin up, you did nothing wrong, the children are safe and as one person has said are learning self control very well!

Children should be allowed to nick name themselves, or parents call a child an odd nicknmae but not name it anything that could cause a potential employer to set aside the resume for Bill Smith, Sarah Thomas, Kailey Aranson. There was a study done, and the job agencies were handed potential candidates all with the same qualifications, the differences were the name 93 per cent of the time the odd names were passed by for those that were more norm of societies names (US study only) and another group were given candidates with better experiece and skills listed than the ones with normal sounding spelled and easier to pronounce names and again, the odd ones were passed by again, and sited was, the person who would make the call, didnt want to start the call off trying to pronounce someones name correctly, they wanted to just make the call and start the invitation to come in and apply. It does matter, you may want your children to feel special, they already will they are yours, just like mine are mine, they get individuality through natural personality and looks already, they dont need dif then the rest names. Im ok with voicing my opionion on this totally, I am the grandmother a tiny new baby boy, whose name is worse than all of yours put together, its sad, besides the dad noone even refers to the baby by name, baby is Jr to all of us, and its making really hard feelings in the family. Since the naming, none of us have sent gifts, dont refer to baby in email, its heart breaking totally and we all feel aweful about it. I feel we all have a rigth to be mad, Im the only one who summed up the families feelings and laid it on the line recently, daughter doesnt even call her son by his ^&*(*&(*&^ name he was given, its heartbreaking.

Kaytlan might be Kate-lan instead of Kate-lynn.<br>  <br>  edit: I've seen your other questions...I don't think you are being honest since your wanted to name your kids some really vulgar names in other questions.|`|XimQM11taa	all of the names you have written are lovely but the spelling just turn a lovely name it to something a little bit strange. i dnt mean to offend you after all it is your baby cal and spell the name however you want. but dont be surprised when they cant spell it at school|`|Zzi5xJSraa	I like unusual spellings as well, although yours are VERY unusual and somewhat hard to read properly. <br>  <br>  I like some of your names, but am going to mix it up a bit:<br>  <br>  Girls: <br>  Haddeigh Izabel<br>  Haddeigh Shayne<br>  Alexaz Cai<br>  <br>  <br>  Coletyn Pryce<br>  Coletyn Chantz|`|2bc760aca1235845cc56ee2f6d0c17d5aa	I have an unusual mane and it is a pain in the @$$ to have to tell people how to pronounce and spell it all the time!    I feel sorry for your children.<br>  <br>  <br>  PS. All my kids have normal boring names.|`|zeeNZ42laa	I like Kaytlan Payge and Coletyn Chayce.<br>  <br>  I like the unique spellings, and I liked my favorites because they still look similar to the origional. What are your other kid's names?|`|PeOCqztoaa	Love Ryleah Kynnadie, Cayden Pryce, and Dayne Andru. Very creative spelling. Definately different from the normal boring spellings. You really picked some great names!|`|VkXQq2y2aa	The spellings look japenese or something.<br>  <br>  <br>  How about Camrynn Lucille. Or Karsyn Lucille. for a girl.|`|Hcdozl0iaa	Cayedin Pryce sounds cute, and I like the spelling of Ryleah although I'm not sure about Kynnadie with it.|`|gn0LrrSRaa	The spellings are a little TOO out there. I love unqiue names too. But don't go to far. You don't want the child to hate you.|`|tSEA42Uraa	I seriously hope you are kidding.|`|2hIQb8f1aa	i like Cayedin Pryce for boy and Kaytlan Payge for girl :)|`|NuCeBq4Jaa	Wow that looks horrible and trashy poor kids!! lol
WX5mDXgvaa	I have been through this.<br>  <br>  You are still pregant.<br>  <br>  But whether the pregnancy is still continuing is still unknown which is why they are measuring your HCG levels and the sac growth... if there has been no gowth in either in a week then it is likely that you have miscarried.<br>  <br>  I am really hoping that things work out well for you.. fingers crossed x|`|A90lbgZ7aa	Try not to worry as the stress wont help you if you still are pregnant (i hope you are) it is possible to bleed during pregnancy and still be ok but you must contact your midwife / maternity unit if this happens to make sure everything is ok. Good luck and all the best i hope this all works out well for you!!|`|LL2dgYMUaa	at six weeks the heart is only just starting to beat and maybe was not visable on the scan. it sounds as if the doctors are not sure which is why they are doing all these tests. Is it possible the midwife ws wrong on your dates in the first place.|`|lv6gkEVaaa	Im sorry your head must be away all i can say is wait 2 days then go and see you doctor,Ill say a prayer everything is ok,God bless you.|`|shEG56h2aa	I agree, go to see a doctor, because I doubt if there are any doctors online. However, it doesn't sound good. I wish you the best, and stay healthy!|`|4jW9rERFaa	I had a miscarriage at 14 weeks, the baby only grew to 8 weeks and had been dead until the 14th week when I went in for radomly bleeding a dark red color for the last week. One doc said nothing to worry about. The other said I need to go to the Emergency room immediately. I was told that day that I was having a miscarriage. I would assume since there is nothing in the sack you must have had miscarriage, either that or they don't know what is going on. You should go in or call the hospital and find out whats going on. Its important. You could still be pregnant, I dunno. Most the time when ppl miscarry, they are imformed immediately.|`|1GxMGmkqaa	for starters what did they tell you? the bloods should have been able to determine if you are still pregnant. <br>  i would not wait even 2 days to find out. get a second opinion as this is serious. generally that amount of bleeding indicates a miscarriage. how do you feel intuitively? majority of women 'know' what is going on.<br>  to leave this, if baby hasnt survived can make you dangerously ill! please go back now for answers. dont leave til you get them.|`|tLGbtmGsaa	I think it could be a blighted ovum.  I went through that.  It means that there is a sac and placenta but no baby.  I miscarried at 10 weeks.  I was in severe pain and had lots of bleeding and clots.  They did a scan and it only showed a sac with no baby.  I ended up having a D&C.  I am so sorry if it is.  Take care.|`|b0ff0526fe90638f8e2ac0fea7c1171caa	I was 4 wks pregnant when I miscarried. I started spotting and then it turned into bright red like a period. I went back to have my levels checked and it was confirmed last month it was a miscarriage. Were you having cramps with the blood? I know I have the WORST cramps and then the blood. it was terrible i knew right away something was wrong. I wish u the best of luck.|`|IPoaeWXPaa	I'm sorry hun but it doesn't sound very good to me.<br>  <br>  I think its ridiculous though that the doctors are making you go through this hell of not being able to tell you right away. I'm sure they could find out whether you were still pregnant.<br>  <br>  Try doing a home pregnancy test...<br>  <br>  xx|`|z93tSvKxaa	Go see a doctor.  Yahoo answers is not qualified to be your OBGYN or physician.
XhIYAH6Laa	Yes you should continue using another birth control method while on antibiotics. I was told by my doctor that you should continue doing this until you finish the pack you are currently on without antibiotics. So if you stop the antibiotics in week 2 of the pack use protection for the final 2 weeks after that.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	With YAZ it takes a week to become effective when you start so I think it would be safe to stop the back up method 2 weeks after your antibiotics (one week for the medicines to get out of your system and one week for the YAZ to take effect).
xRZ1PRZwaa	Yes - with weight loss that big, you should bring your baby to see the doctor. The doctor may help you get a formula that has more fat to help your baby's weight keep going up.<br>  <br>  He will gain his weight back, but talk to the doctor about getting him on a formula that will help more.<br>  <br>  Because he's so little, he should be getting all his nutrients and such from his formula, not from food. Spoon feeding is to train him and help fill him up. So, get him going with his weight gain with formula. Because of his weight loss and because he isn't enjoying spoon feeding right now, use the spoon feeding for him to practice eating, but not for his main food.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps hon - I wish you the very best of luck, and hope you enjoy your new home!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Maybe he wants to feed himself.  Dump some food on his tray and see what he does.  Be prepared for a mess, but also some ridiculously hilarious antics.<br>  <br>  Edited: Why do you keep asking the identical question again and again?  Just wait for people to answer.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Its never ok to put food in a baby's bottle.  Bottles are for breastmilk or formula only.  Rarely it can be medically necessary to give a formula fed baby a small amount of oral rehydration solution and if they won't take that from a cup or spoon then you can put it in their bottle.<br>  <br>  Putting cereal and baby food in a bottle is not only a choking hazard and can cause the baby to end up with food in their lungs it stops them being able to control how many calories they are getting.<br>  <br>  When you put low calorie baby food in a bottle you often end up with weight loss, so I'm not surprised your son has lost weight.<br>  <br>  STOP giving him anything other than breastmilk or formula, some babies aren't developmentally ready for solids until 9 months and solids aren't needed until 12-18 months of age.<br>  <br>  Start letting him sit with you at meals, when he is ready for solids he will pick them up and eat them.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/babyconcerns/growth/weight-gain_increase.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/babyconcerns/gro...</a><br>  There are several simple things that have been proven to help with weight gain:<br>  <br>      * Stop or decrease solid foods, particularly if baby is younger than 6 months. Most solids foods have fewer calories and nutrients than breastmilk, plus they tend to replace (rather than add to) the higher-calorie, more nutritious breastmilk.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/faq/bf4.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.askdrsears.com/faq/bf4.asp</a><br>  I also have found that some infants are not developmentally ready for solids until 8 or 9 months. You can click here to read about what signs to watch for to determine when your infant is ready for foods. Breast milk is nutritionally complete for at least the first year of life. This means that infants can go for at least a year on breast milk alone, without eating any foods, and be nutritionally complete. Offering foods between 6 and 12 months of age is simply for social development and to get infants used to eating. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/solids/solids-when.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/solids...</a><br>  After this point, different babies are ready for solids at different times -- developmental readiness for solids cannot be determined using a calendar. Most babies are developmentally ready for solids somewhere between 6 and 8 months.<br>  Signs that indicate baby is developmentally ready for solids include:<br>  <br>      * Baby can sit up well without support.<br>      * Baby has lost the tongue-thrust reflex and does not automatically push solids out of his mouth with his tongue.<br>      * Baby is ready and willing to chew.<br>      * Baby is developing a “pincer” grasp, where he picks up food or other objects between thumb and forefinger. Using the fingers and scraping the food into the palm of the hand (palmar grasp) does not substitute for pincer grasp development.<br>      * Baby is eager to participate in mealtime and may try to grab food and put it in his mouth.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.llli.org/FAQ/solids.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.llli.org/FAQ/solids.html</a><br>  You will know that he is really ready to start solids when:<br>  <br>      * he is about six months old<br>      * he can sit up without any support<br>      * he continues to be hungry despite more frequent nursing which is unrelated to illness or teething<br>      * he has lost the tongue-thrusting reflex and does not push solids out of his mouth<br>      * he can pick up things with his finger and thumb (pincer grasp)<br>  <br>  Babies who are ready for solids can usually feed themselves. Mothers often report that they knew their babies were ready when they picked up food from a plate, chewed it, swallowed it, and wanted more<br>  <br>  <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6762795.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/676279...</a><br>  After six months, Mrs Rapley said babies were capable of taking food into their mouths and chewing it.<br>  <br>  Therefore, feeding them pureed food at this time could delay the development of chewing skills.<br>  <br>  Instead, she said, they should be given milk and solid pieces of food which they could chew.<br>  <br>  Mrs Rapley argued that babies fed pureed food had little control over how much food they ate, thus rendering them vulnerable to constipation, and running a risk that they would react by becoming fussy eaters later in life.<br>  <br>  She blamed the food industry for convincing parents that they should give children pureed food.<br>  <br>  She said: "Sound scientific research and government advice now agree that there is no longer any window of a baby's development in which they need something more than milk and less than solids." <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drgreene.com/21_857.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.drgreene.com/21_857.html</a><br>  Thirst is an extremely strong drive. As long as a baby’s own regulating mechanism isn’t tricked by getting too much juice or water, healthy babies will take enough formula or breast milk to meet their nutritional needs. This is one good reason not to put juice in the bottle. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drgreene.com/21_861.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.drgreene.com/21_861.html</a><br>  Throughout most of human history children were exclusively breast fed for the early months. During the previous generation or two, when bottle-feeding became very popular, rice cereal was often put into the bottle at a very early age. What were the results?<br>  <br>  Most children seemed to thrive. A small number of children, though, did not tolerate the addition, because their sucking and swallowing actions were not yet fully coordinated. They inhaled small amounts of the rice cereal into their lungs, which led to pulmonary problems.<br>  <br>  I’m much more concerned about a subtler issue. Babies are born with a wonderful mechanism for knowing how much food they need. During the early months, they take their cues from the volume of what they drink. Adding cereal derails this mechanism. It forces them to take in deceptively large amounts of calories. It teaches them to overeat.<br>  <br>  By starting with a spoon, resting between bites, and stopping when your child lets you know he’s full, you will be laying an excellent foundation for good eating habits throughout his life.<br>  <br>  A major study looking for the causes of obesity found that short-circuiting young children’s self-regulation of how much they eat is a major cause of later obesity.1 Cereal in the bottle does just that.<br>  <br>  Babies that are fed this way may appear to be unaffected – but those few weeks of added convenience may result in a lifetime of struggles with weight. This common practice may have contributed to our being the most obese generation in history.
c73QkZ2haa	They usally dont allow children in the delivery room. Simply tell her that. Get someone to be waiting in the hosp with her so she can be there and see the baby right away. The hosp i was at didnt even allow children to visit if they werent a brother or sister.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	Well,  I would tell her about an alternative that would have her just as excited to go do something else.  <br>  Such as talk to her grandparents or a family member, and perhaps ask them to take her for the day, and take her out to shop for a sister piece of jewelery,  a gift for the baby, and a "special lunch out" to celebrate the birth of the baby.  <br>  <br>  Then after you have the baby, she can come visit, bring her sister the gift she picked out, and she probably won't think she missed a thing. <br>  <br>  Just present the idea in a manner that appeals to 7 year olds.  Tell her,  since you are so special and are a becoming a big sister, on the day of the birth you get to go with grandma and grandpa and have a special celebration day.  Then explain to her, her role she has in becoming a new sister and how great her special day out with be with her grandparents.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Is there someone that can stay in the waiting area with her? Or "keep" her until you've had your baby and then bring her up to the hospital?<br>  <br>  She should understand she's too young to be in with you, just tell her that. If someone is going to watch her for you have her go to the store in the meantime and pick out something special for the new baby. I'd try to still keep her involved but not actually IN the room with you.|`|AA10953561	Most hospitals do not want a child that young in the delivery room. My hospital won't let anyone under 13 in the delivery room. If I were you I'd explain that the hospital has rules and you can't break them, plus it's not very much fun. My step-daughter is six and wants to be there too. I don't want her there simply because it's very personal, private event and it's also very intense and gross and I don't want to traumatize her! Ask your husband to back you up on this. It's very important that the two of you present a united front.<br>  <br>  Good luck and congratulations!|`|ebuxHnScaa	I don't think you need to really discuss this specifically. Just never hint that she would be allowed in there. You don't need to tell her that your husband is going to be there.<br>  <br>  Answer her questions honestly, but don't volunteer information that might create a problem. Tell her that you will be taken into a special room with doctors and nurses and that as soon as the baby is ready, she will get to see the baby and you. Tell her that it's a very special time and you're glad she's going to be a part of it.<br>  <br>  Don't lie to her, answer her questions honestly. But don't ever suggest that there was any possibility should would be in the delivery room. (I doubt any hospital would let her in there anyway.)|`|Ki6jlwnbaa	Explain to her that it is very hectic in the delivery room and a little girl might get lost in all the commotion and that it is very important that the mommy and daddy are there together. BUT, assure her as soon as the baby is ready, she'll be the first one allowed to see it.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I sincerely doubt she would be allowed in a hospital delivery room anyway, for basically all the reasons you don't want her there.  So just tell her she's not allowed.|`|zATQaiwIaa	you just tell her that this is an environment for ADULTS only, which i completely agree with, and that as soon as the baby is born and cleaned up she will be let in to the delivery room.  When you go to the hospital send her to grandmas house or with someone that will bring her to the hospital when the time is right. For all you know you could be at the hospital for a while - and no one, not even adults, really want to sit in a waiting room for hours on end.|`|mX9z4jHIaa	Alone, explain that this is a personel experiance, and that you care about her to not have her in there. Because this is a time for mommy and daddy. I promise I'll let you come in after the baby is born. Try to not say it in a way that would make her feel like you don't like her. Try to make it up to her by helping her hold the baby, or have a outing that is just her and you. Good Luck with your baby!|`|2jrffIoWaa	Yeah, I agree...just tell her that it's a room that only adults are allowed in, but that she will be able to see and hold the baby shortly after.  You can even blame the hospital if you don't want to be the bad guy.  I don't think they would even consider allowing her to be in there.|`|AA10972821	Tell her that she is in charge of friends and family in the waiting room.  Your husband can give her updates and she can then announce them to everyone else who is there or can call others to tell them. Something like that would make her feel really important because she'll be the first to know besides of course you and your husband!!|`|heDtLdz5aa	well she is 7..there isn't going to be a way where you aren't going to hurt her feelings...is there an alternative...i know when i had my baby..my step-son was only 12 and anyone under the age of 14 had to be with another adult..other than my husband..so my mother-in-law was in the room also..she didn't bring my step-son in until i  started pushing...could this be a possibility for you?
mHSwQa7Naa	You should call your doctor and let him know your concerned. When babies are teething, they will not want to eat. Try giving him jello or cold foods that might help him. Try teething rings, and orajel. When they are teething it is very painful. I know your tired, but if the only way he will eat is from the bottle then give him that for now. When his teeth come in gradually try and re-introduce the spoon

YjWw5oDDaa	I understand what your going through I was 13 when I got pregnant with my oldest son, and believe me it was very scary. He was my first love and I was very naive. I thought my sister and brother-in-law whom I lived with at the time was gonna kill me. But as you can tell they didn't. Often times what seems like the end isn't. You have to realize this has happened for a reason, (and not just because you had sex) you may be surprised just how much your mom will understand. Now of course she's gonna get upset but that's  because she understands the hardship a child brings to anyone that isn't ready. She wants better for you than she had, all parents do. The thing is now you really need to tell her soon because it isn't gonna go away and all waiting will do is cause more stress for you and the baby. By the way at 13 I didn't think I'd make it, I lost my youth, I had to move out of my sister and brother-in-laws and I had to quit school. Now I'm 33 and I have 4 wonderful kids I'm in school to be a MA and I wouldn't change any of my life, yes it hasn't been easy and sometimes I was my only support. The thing is as a mom now you will always have someone there that loves you for you. My oldest son the one I had at 13 is my best friend and I know I wouldn't be as strong as I am now without him. I wish you luck and I hope that you find the light at the end of this seemingly endless tunnel. <br>  <br>  And as for the way your mom has acted in the past well it's becasue she knew this would happen and so she reacted the best way she knew how, it wasn't the right way but she probably felt desperate. Often times we act before we think.|`|DvzNqLPOaa	Don't be afraid, she will understand. She might be upset at first, but in her mind, you are still her little girl! Just be honest with her and ask her what she thinks. Being so young, you will need help raising that little baby, hopefully she will offer to do that. I don't know you or her, but being a mom myself, I know that I would do anything for my kids. <br>  You should go to the dr and have a check up. They will do another test and schedule you for an ultrasound. It is important that you stop smoking/drinking/or whatever else. The dr will get you on vitamins and give you further information and pregnancy and raising a child or adoption if you choose that route. Relax, take a deep breath, and trust that your mom will understand. Good Luck & God Bless|`|CeS9Pin7aa	false positives are rare - 3 of them would be beyond unlikely.  All you can do is pick your time and place well to talk to your Mom.  Sit down with her and be honest and up front.   It may also help to have given some thought to your plans so that she knows you are taking your responsibilities seriously.|`|aKiynqA6aa	she probably will be a little disappointed, but she will get over it and probably understand seeing as how she did the same thing.  you just have to tell her; i'm sure she'll be supportive and right now you need all of the support you can get.|`|3Gd7OBezaa	it's up 2 u not ur mother obviously she didn't want live life without u so tell her ur'e scared & u don't need a lecture by showing her this question.<br>  xxxxxxxxxxxxxoooooooooooooo|`|t0sjtkjAaa	go to the doctor.|`|KLoI7bdXaa	sucks for u <br>  maybe you control your hormones..|`|FeMJDEcIaa	Hey, dont be scared.. It will be ok, I promise.  <br>  There's many options on your plate. Though I am not against abortion I dont really advise it.  <br>  My mother had me at a young age too, but when I found out I was pregnant it still took guts and balls to tell her.  Please go ahead and recognise that yes you are pregnant, I didn't want to believe it until I was months along and could no longer hide it. <br>  If you choose to keep the baby, there are alot of programs out there that will help you.<br>  However if you believe that someone else could provide much more that life has to offer for the baby, PLEASE CONSIDER ADOPTION.<br>  They can help you through so much and are great support for when your feeling down.  Especially if the father of the child does not want you to have it or to have any part of it, please consider adoption.<br>  <br>  I do wish you the best of luck with whatever you decide, and if you have any questions about my pregnancy I'll be more than happy to answer them.<br>  <br>  <br>  Tell your mom that your scared, that you think you might be pregnant and have her make you a doctor's appointment to have a better test done.  Your not going to disappoint her.  She may not take the news well at first, but she'll see that you are just as scared as she was and open up more, especially if you have researched your options.|`|AA12247914	Well, if they were all different brands, it's probably true. I'm 24 and still did the same thing. I finally went to the dr's and had them check and sure enough, that was what finally got it through my head. As for your mother, is she a reasonable woman?? If so, sit her down, and tell her you have something important to tell her and that she has to hear you out before she says anything. Let her know that you're sorry and that you know that she's disappointed but both of you together can make it though this. Now if she goes a little nuts sometimes, you may want to talk to your school counselor and have them or someone that you both trust with you when you tell her. Maybe Grandma or someone just as close??|`|quPVWzGBaa	Good Luck with the baby!  Just tell your mom when but be really calm when you do.  I am sure she will understand since she was in the same situation.  Don't be afraid that you disappointed her your life is not over there are plenty of things you can still do to make your mom proud like being responsible and doing the right thing for your baby.  Things might seem bad now but they will get better.  Good Luck with everything.|`|txv7TIgiaa	just tell your mom she might be upset but if she has been in your situation before she will understand and you should make a doctors apointment and get a blood test to be sure... don't worry you will be fine i got pregnant at 17 and i am now 19 my daughter is 14 months old now she is a blessing and i love her very much and i would do anything for her.. i know it is going to take some getting used to but as long as you try to finish as much school as possible and get ready for the baby you should be fine...it will be hard but if you have your mothers support it will be a big help, my mom didn't help me much wheni found out i was pregnant and things worked out fine for me and i still visit my mom and talk to her on the phone and she loves her grandaughter... good luck and congrat's, this is a good thing it is  ablessing every baby is!|`|ZSSUfSXwaa	Well if 3 pregnancy tests were positive you are indeed Pregnant. <br>  Well you are pregnant, and you need to tell your mom about it, the sooner the better because you need prenatal care.<br>  Only 16 you say, yet you had unprotected sex at only 16...well now it's time to be responsible.

You ARE in fact, pregnant.<br>  If you really feel the need to check again, a blood test will be able to confirm your pregnancy or non-pregnancy.<br>  In the mean time, I think you should try to come to terms with the fact that you have a child growing inside of you. Give yourself a couple more days to let it sink in so you can think about it sanely. You're scared, nervous, emotional, etc, so try to relax. Worrying about the baby won't make it go away, so don't waste your time or energy on worrying. <br>  My personal belief is against abortion, so I'd say to keep the baby. I realize that not everyone might share this point of view, and that's okay, but I say that since you're pregnant, you might as well make the best of it. You're bringing a new life into the world - be happy!<br>  <br>  As for your mother, I understand that there'll be some degree of disappointment on her part. She went through the very same thing, so she can't really be furious or say that you're a bad person. <br>  <br>  Some disappointment is invitable, I figure, regardless of age. That's how it s for my parents. I'm going to be 21 in May, my mom had me when she was 33. I'm certainly not waiting that long. No matter what I will have accomplished in life when I get pregnant, in her eyes she will believe that there's always something better, and that I should've waited longer. <br>  I'll disappoint her regardless, and I'll need to come to terms with that myself.<br>  <br>  Your mom will be able to connect with you because she went through the same thing. Just sit her down, you and her alone, and talk to her. Just be open. <br>  <br>  I wish you (and your baby) the very best. ^_^
H0fXySX9aa	the gestational sac appears at week 4 <br>  a yolk sac week 5<br>  a fetal pole and heart beat 6 weeks onwards<br>  your pregnant just very early|`|yrDqtazLaa	You're pregnant, hun. The baby is too small to be seen inside the sac yet, and too small to get a heartbeat yet. No worries, as the baby grows, you'll be able to see it and hear/see the heartbeat with future ultrasounds. If you miscarried, the sac would have gone with everything else. Congratulations!|`|yKS2UI87aa	Very doubtful for them to see a hearbeat yet. Ultrasound tech would not have said you were if she knew you weren't. The bleeding was probably implantation spotting. Congrats|`|s4OtfZ7Gaa	if you had miscarried you would know, the baby grows in the sac, so no the sac wouldnt be the only thing there. i have good and bad to say about this.<br>  with my first two pregnancies when i went for the ultrasound there was a gestational sac but no baby. i was too far on in the pregnancy (13 weeks in 1st and 8 weeks in second) for it to be 'too early to tell'. i had to have a D&C with both.<br>  in this pregnancy i had some bleeding so i went to the emergency room. i thought i was 6.5 weeks pregnant at the time. they found a sac but no fetal pole. they scheduled another ultrasound for 2 weeks later and i was insanely worried. i had tears running down my face when she started the ultrasound because i just knew i was only going to see another empty sac. i even said to the lady doing it 'one day i'm actually going to have a baby'. she got up, got me some tissues came back and turned on the sound, and there was a heartbeat!!!!! it was the most amazing and emotional experience of my life. to have gone through two heartbreaking miscarriages and then to just know this was going to be the same thing, that heart beat is burned into my head for the rest of my life. turned out i was only 4 weeks at the first ultrasound and it was just too early to see anything. i am now 10 weeks 5 days and the baby is doing great! i pray this is the same experience you have!
zzfCPTiQaa	Chloe Rachel<br>  Emma Grace<br>  Maybe instead of Isabella, it can be Isabelle.  For that, it'd be Isabelle Luciana.

gGchCKC4aa	Congrats!  I would speak with your obgyn and make sure they know that you had the surgery as past abdominal surgery can affect whether or not you need a C section.  This probably won't be the case for you, but I have read that past surgeries weaken the walls.  However, you didn't have surgery involving your uterus, so you should be fine.  Just to be on the safe side, make sure you discuss it with your doctor.  Also, do what you can to follow a healthy diet.|`|v3LnJycKaa	WOW congrats on the amazing weight loss, and on the pregnancy, I would def discuss these concerns with your dr, as far as nutrition, glucose testing etc... I amsure as this procedure is still quite new that there isnt too much prenatal testing that has occured with it int he past 10 years or so...|`|aKiynqA6aa	you'll just need to ask your doctor these questions, but i have a friend that had gastric bypass and while doing the surgery they realized she was pregnant. the very early stages.  the test they ran before doing the surgery had come back negative.  anyway, she has a healthy baby boy now.  i think he's about 4 years old.|`|yKS2UI87aa	Well, I would definitely go to be on the safe side. Having that done you may not be able to get enough nutrition for 2. If you don't go to your surgeon absolutely tell your obgyn so she can monitor you more closely. Congrat's|`|1e6LvbXJaa	NO AS LONG AS UR HEALTHY
KDb96QS7aa	Sounds like my son. He had a lactose intolerance. Talk to the ped if you are on formula to see about switching formulas or if they're breastfeeding call a lactation consultant (there is a hotline you can call to talk to them free if the doctor's office doesn't have them on staff - 18009949662)|`|7bdhpvc9aa	She definitely needs to be seen by the pediatrician. Crying while pooping is a sign of constipation. They need to make sure there isn't any blood in her stools. Please tell them to call the doc. It is ALWAYS better to be safe than sorry especially when it comes to a baby.|`|c3e47027bea44693f335220367a34ee2aa	I would definitely call the doctor's office and at least talk to one of the nurses about it.  They may want the child brought in.  There could be a bowl restriction that is painful.  It could be something else.  They might want to have an x-ray taken.<br>  <br>  I asked my mom about it, there has been four of us and we never had a problem like this.|`|2a6cb7ea07ea5187f422cf0c3777e421aa	she needs to be seen by her pediatrician at once!!!!!!
3X0t8JrXaa	It would seem like you're having some type of "sympathy pains" for her.  You have taken 2 different precautions when it comes to protecting yourself during sex and the symptoms you said you're having are normal things for you with the exception of the upset stomach which could be something you ate.  If your period seems to be missing then I'd take a test but it doesn't sound like you're pregnant.|`|imXuAM53aa	Your not pregnant if you've been having your period, your just being paranoid, you said it yourself that it is normal for you to feel fatigue and have headaches.|`|gb3uividaa	Chances are if you have had two normal periods that you are not pregnant. It could just be "sympathy" for your friend who is pregnant. My best friend ended up gaining and experiencing symptoms right along with me through my whole pregnancy! It was weird! As your period draws near it can also make you experience some pregnancy like symptoms. Might just be PMS. As always though if you miss your period you would want to take a test to make sure!|`|eQfg7xRIaa	Yes, your good, your just paranoid because of your friend
AA11510511	Yes.|`|4jW9rERFaa	Heck yeah. Some people have went in to the emergency room at 9 months in pain not knowing they were pregnant the entire time and the pains are labor.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	i didn't realize until almost my 3rd month that i was pregnant with my first. so yes, you can.<br>  <br>  and with my current pregnancy had i not missed my period, i wouldn't have known until roughly 5 months because of my placenta.. its in the front so i could feel baby move at all until 22 weeks.|`|vKlMdtpaaa	yes you can. a few years ago my cousin was the same. she was still having her monthly cycle etc then one night she had very bad stomach cramps. her partner took her to a&e just to make sure..... an hour later out popped little stephanie! it was one mad rush then to get her clothes etc cus no one knew..not even her! s yes its very possible to be pregnant and not know about it!|`|xarKlp0Oaa	Yes. My grandma had a baby fall out of her into the toilet and she didn't know she was pregnant at all. (when she was 37)  It is possible. No lie|`|ALTbWp6maa	yes - but more info needed really.|`|iObsX33qaa	yes you can be the best way to find out is by doin a test

UeWHGsqzaa	Being a mom is definitely no easy task, especially if you happen to have overly active children. During the last few years many doctors including my own have pointed out how unhealthy it is to constantly drink coffee through the course of the day. First of all it does not help your health any and it really does not give you the proper energy that your body needs to function. Of course after you drink a cup you will definitely feel a burst of energy, but after a while the caffeine will begin to wear off and you will begin to feel sluggish all over again. There are however several other things that you can do in order to keep your energy level up, while caring for the kids, and other household duties. <br>  <br>  First thing you need to do is start off with a healthy fiber enriched breakfast. I will usually try to have a bowl of oatmeal, or a healthy bowl of cereal. You will be surprised at how much extra energy you have when you take the time to have a healthy breakfast. Now for some including myself, it may be necessary for you to get up a little early so that you have time to enjoy your breakfast before the kids get up. A little bit of quiet time in the morning to yourself can really help to get you energized for the rest of the day. Another suggestion is to try and eat foods that give you energy. Instead of snacking on something that has a lot of caffeine why not snack on some fruits and vegetables. There quick and easy, and will help to keep your energy. <br>  <br>  If and when your kids actually decide to take a nap this would definitely be a good opportunity for you to just sit and relax. I realize that this is very difficult for any mom to do especially when there are lots to be done, but everyone needs at least a five to ten minute break during the course of the day. One final suggestion is to take some time and exercise before you go to bed in the evening, or visit a local gym once a week while someone else watches the kids. Staying in shape is another great way for you to keep your energy level up during the course of the day. So the bottom line is to forget about the coffee and focus more on staying fit and staying healthy.|`|SidiCJtUaa	i try and get out at least once a day and it seems to hep, my daugher is 11weeks now and it is cold outside, ijust wrap her up and me and even if its for 20mins i have been out in the fresh air and it makes me feel better. i have started salsa once a week too and thats great, try and find soeting that gets you away for anhour or so, good for some 'me'time too and dad feels useful. hope that helps.|`|Rhr1umV1aa	If you wanted to go and walk you could always go to a mall or something with the stroller. Its warm and you can walk for hours if you want without "having" to buy anything. As far as staying awake. You may need more iron. If you are low in iron than you may become tired and such. Try a multi vitamin in the morning when you wake up or right before you go to bed. Sometimes all the caffeine that you drink can actually make you tired. Maybe try to get a baby sitter for a few hours to relax at a spa or just have you time. It really does help. Or eat a cold orange. Drink orange juice when you get up, the vitamin C will help you.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	I struggle in the mornings. My daughter is still an awful sleeper, and it's starting to really exhaust me (7mos). I force myself to work out every day, it's not easy at all...but I always feel better. Being physically out of shape can really interfere with every aspect of your life/energy. I'd start small, but try to get back into exercising.|`|ccd9bacbf1ad616406e98ebf61adc6dcaa	I force myself to get fully dressed first thing. Hair done, full makeup, and a good pair of lace-up sneakers. Something about it makes me feel ready to accomplish all the other things I need to do (such as that sink full of dishes, lol). If I stayed in my bathrobe all day, it would only keep me in that lazy state of mind. I also get the baby dressed nicely, and I try to go for a short walk with her each day (I'm in Florida, and the weather's been very nice lately). If the weather isn't good, you could try taking her to an indoor mall to walk around. My daughter even loves going to the grocery store. Anything to get yourself going.|`|90eDaQpBaa	stop drinking coffee, switch to pomagranate juice, when you feel low put some music on that is high energy, like dance, do some yoga and have a nap when your baby naps..at least try this!|`|t9S0dqfLaa	I would guess it is lack of exercise because I'm feeling a lot of what you are but if you're really concerned that something may be wrong with you go see the doctor.|`|Ot8lxaMEaa	Being out of shape and not getting exercise can be a real downer on energy. Here in Maine its freezing. Have you tried a work out video or just some light exercises inside? If its above 30 degrees, its ok to bundle baby up in a stroller or carrier and go for a 10-15 min walk which can make a big difference. Its supposed to get up to 40 degrees this weekend!!! Or what about going to a store or shopping mall and doing that for a little while.<br>  <br>  What are your eating habits like? Try eating small healthy meals throughout the day and drinking lots of water. I find I do better on 9 hours of sleep and just tend to turn in early. My son is 9 months and gets up twice a night usually, so I need more than the 8 hours. Good luck|`|fHjSonssaa	I sort of feel the exact same way you do- I am not over-weight, but I feel really out of shape.<br>  You only have a couple more months before she starts moving- and you'll be forced to move a lot with her- which in turn will make you feel better.<br>  <br>  I live in MN -so it's cold here too (but it starting to warm up)- and on the days it was REALLY cold and we didn't get out much- I felt shitty- just crappy all around.<br>  <br>  But then I would notice when I would muster up the energy to pack up head to mall (lucky us, we have Mall of America just a few minutes away)- I'd feel much better being out and walking and people watching with  my son ( he loves it).<br>  <br>  It really does feel better- I feel more energized as a whole when I do this, and in the evening I have a little more energy to get done what I need to get done.<br>  <br>  It's lack of excerise, at least I think- and it's not always easy to get out of the rut- <br>  <br>  but once you do, and you feel the results, you'll realize it's worth it!!
9a3sNrEqaa	hey hun. Well your first provera pill was feb 28th....and you take it for 5 days...so lets see you should expect a period period within 14 days of your last pill. But most women get it before that. I am concerned b/c generally upon ovulation you will get your period around give or take a few days within 2 weeks. Here is why I am concerned. Its possible for the OPK to detect a surge but its possible that the egg was not released. If this is the case thats why you didn't get your period yet bc ovulation didn't occur. OR your pregnant. Those are my only 2 thoughts on that. I think that you should talk to your dr and see if you can't up your mgs of clomid. I believe your on 50 mg now. Talk about going up to 100 mg. It is possible that your egg wasn't released. Also they have an HCG trigger shot that helps the egg break out. I would really see your Dr bc you should have gotten your period by now. I really think its possible ur pregnant tho! Or your egg wasn't released. In any event im keepin my fingers crossed for you!!! GOOD LUCK HUN!!!!!!!! TONS OF BABY DUST FOR YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|qfnWZ3twaa	its okayy just to spot some times maybe thats how your body wants to work right now.. call your doctor for a quick convo and ask her if its normal.. youll be fine|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	Still sounds like you are pregnant to me, Beth!  =)
b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	I know I'm going to get a barrage of thumbs down, but who the heck cares. LOL<br>  <br>  I am environmentally 'conscious' to the point where I think that it's irresponsible to be wasteful. I don't leave lights burning all night long, we turn things off when we're done with them, and try not to be excessively wasteful around the house. I teach my kids to do the same. <br>  <br>  Ironically, I'm not into recycling or saving the polar ice caps, but we have a 'green team' here on campus - and yet I routinely see offices around campus (I can see them from my house) with lights left all *all night long* more than once a month, etc. Now *that* is irresponsible and wasteful, in my opinion. But I don't want the school's Green Team subjecting me to ridicule or criticism because my heat is always up in the winter and my electric meter is running - because I live in an incredibly inefficient 100+  house that I cannot do anything about (can't make renovations, since we don't own). <br>  <br>  That said, we don't recycle. I have a couple issues with it - one, if I'm buying the product, using it and then going to the trouble of cleaning it out (i.e. peanut butter jars, gack!), why would I want to either pay the city/township to haul it away, then keep the money from it? Recycling is expensive, and I don't want to feel like I must do it in order to have any of my trash hauled away. Some communities do practice this, which I find ridiculous. If I'm going to go to all that trouble, I'm sorry - but I want the money that comes out of it. :) There are places that do that, especially with metals (and there are those recycling places at the grocery store, which are messy and a PITA, especially with three kids in tow), but I don't know of any around where I live that let you start an account in exchange for bringing in your metal goods. <br>  <br>  I also don't have the room to store everything as space is very limited in my kitchen area. We tried this for a while with my husband's students in the dorm, and it was a huge mess. And after they lost interest in it, I got stuck with the smell, the mess, the gnats, and taking it all in for what ... a $5 coupon? <br>  <br>  One thing that does bug me - and I don't meant to offend those nice people I've sort of made friends with on here and like - but to some people, I think it has almost taken on a religious fervor. That part really bugs me. I get criticized widely and in general by people for having a relationship with God, and for worshipping him, yet I see countless people that choose to worship the Earth instead, basically. I'm talking those whose mantra it is that 'more than two kids are irresponsible and bad for our planet' crowd, etc. I do think a lot of what we're hearing these days is hype and scare tactics, and from my religious view, I feel that only One Person created the Earth, and only He can destroy it - not us. We can sure darned well try, and I'll agree that dumping your oil in the ground or the Cuyahoga River setting on fire due to pollution is totally irresponsible behavior - but total destruction of the Earth is not something that I feel man can successfully accomplish. <br>  <br>  While it's good to take certain measures, it's easy to go overboard. It is, after all, an 'industry,' one that is designed to appeal to the consumer to get you to spend more money on their product than the next guy's. We've heard countless stories of how green products are anything but, and how there's a lot of gimmickery involved. I just can't let myself buy into it like I know some people do.|`|AA12145826	I'm sure we could do much more (trust me the dirt-worshiping, tree-hugging side of me really wants to do more) but we recycle, we installed a "gray water" system last year to help conserve water, we have veggie gardens (though I don't garden, my MIL does) & a few fruit trees, we collect & use rain water, we've changed all our bulbs to the energy efficient kind once the old ones died, etc. I think we're more about reusing & conservation than anything else.|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	I do not lose sleep over it, but I do make practical choices.  Sometimes those choices are easy (switching off things that do not need to be on) and sometimes those choices are something that I have go to out of my way, either literally or financially, for (such as switching all of our light bulbs, recycling, consolidating trips into town, etc.).<br>  <br>  My interest in and love for the country of China led to my learning more about bamboo.  It is a resource that is easily replenished, and I have started to purchase bamboo products as much as possible-and they have everything from knitting hooks to florring, blinds, etc.   We live in the country, and I am considering becoming a bamboo supplier if I can find someone.  We have three acres we could plant.<br>  <br>  It is kind of like the commercial I see on television.  We not all need be nutcases to make a difference.|`|QnJvJ67uaa	Quite a lot I think.<br>  we recycle after re-using.<br>  I get stuff from freecycle and the free ads papers.<br>  We are remodelling our kitchen and have made a system for under the sink so we can re-cycle the washing up water on the apple trees and veggie garden.<br>  I grow @ 80 % of our fruit and veg between April and November.<br>  I dont own a car.<br>  I dont fly.<br>  I don't smoke.<br>  I don't eat meat or dairy.<br>  <br>  The kids also do a lot of environmental studies at school so they are keen to help with re-cycling etc.<br>  I see it as an equal partner with the waste not want not  attitude of our grandparents...I can't stand the faux greenies who buy all their stupidly expensive ethically sourced stuff so they can crow about it...I'd rather dive a dumpster :D|`|hl5WdXnbaa	I believe were I am from the far north of Canada and have witnessed the extreme change almost first hand, I do think about it alot. It does not keep me up at night but I will put the extra effort into recycling, using reusable bags, energy efficient appliances, bulbs.. And when we got our floor redone we used bamboo. It is a beautiful floor too and did not cost as much as  normal hard wood.<br>  <br>  Not only is it saving our world, but money too, so to me it is a win-win situation.|`|3WWHWsHOaa	Not a whole lot. I recycle and try to buy green but other than that I dont pay much attention.|`|4WyUrWaIaa	We recycle, and turn off the lights after we leave a room, plug out the electrics when going to bed  ... that's about it !|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	Very (for about 2 years now... not at all prior to that)<br>  <br>  I don't lie in bed thinking about it (once I hit the bed I'm out, lol) but I do think about it a lot and am always trying to find new and better ways to do my part.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	since the person i'm married to researches alternative energies, it's pretty prominent on my radar.<br>  <br>  i will go somewhat out of my way to find ways to conserve resources.  i'll use my cloth bags at the grocery store and switch my lightbulbs and carpool and recycle and stuff like that.  i will spend (and recently spent) a fair amount of money to upgrade my house (windows, boiler, insulation) to be more energy efficient.  but if you're asking me to give up my berries in the winter to "eat local", there i draw a line in the sand.  nobody takes my berries.
I7Sd9qd6aa	my baby was a 31 weeker she is also 9.5 mo and 15lbs 3 oz,  she is on high cal formula Neosure, but has decided she ONLY wants big girl food no formula, my ped said if she wont take her bottleor to just give extra calories give her full fat yogurt or cottage cheese. hope this helps.|`|Ot8lxaMEaa	My son has always been on the small side too. He's your sons age and in the 5-10 percentile for weight born at 36 weeks. Give him as much formula/breastmilk as possible since this has the most calories and fats (give before solids). As for solid foods, try for calorie rich foods like full fat dairy products (cheese and yogurt). Avacado is high in healthy fats and calories too. Good luck!|`|fslABgDnaa	Please don't worry about it if the doctor isn't worried. My brother was a preemie and weighed only 4 pounds at birth. He was a bit behind for the first year because of being premature - but he is not 6 feet tall and has not issues in the weight department. He will be fine and catch up eventually :-)|`|Rhr1umV1aa	That is the problem The fact that he learned to crawl. When babies crawl or start to walk, basically becoming very active it is hard to get them to gain weight. My son did this for a while too and we tried to get him to gain weight. Then once he was accustomed to walking he started to gain weight and is now 30 lbs and 20 months old. But he is in the 75th percentile. Just keep feeding him normally and when he wants it. He will eventually start to pack the weight on.|`|SVZiztqEaa	I have 2 children who are both in the 10th perc. in weight. So what!! they'll be nice and trim when they're older.

Plus the dr said that it depends on the parents too. we're both slim, so i can't expect anything more from my children. it could be your case too.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	If the doctor is concerned about your son's weight, she should prescribe a healthy nutrition program for him.|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	He sounds right on track - is he breastfed?  The doctors use charts based on formula fed babies, there a different charts for breastfed babies.  My daughter at 9.5 months was also right around 15 lbs.  She was 6 lb 15 oz at birth and on time.<br>  <br>  If you are breastfeeding try to get in some extra nursing sessions (same goes for if he is bottle fed).  Breast milk or formula will offer more calories than solids.  Any solids offered make sure they are full of healthy fats - avocado is a great one...
QnJvJ67uaa	it is possible especially if the mother is helping.<br>  To tempt her to talk on the phone try sending a gift...this gives them something to talk about, also how about calling the mother the day before and making some notes on relevant news the child has (friends parties, school projects, pets etc ) This means the father can prompt the child into talking about her day. It may take a while but so long as mother is encouraging and helps the process it should happen.<br>  Good luck x|`|AA11206135	People please stop responding to this unbalanced troll.. Check out all of the Questions he posts 50 times a day.....Start reporting him, NOT answering him!|`|kpJws6kEaa	Yeah it depends on the child though. I think you should ask your child and then if she says yes then you let her dad talk to her by the phone but if she says no then i wouldnt force her to do it.
CRvdmFwCaa	Well.... <br>  <br>  My husband got caught with pot when he was 17.  (that was like 20 years ago)  His parents ignored the situation pretty much.  He said he got grounded for awhile, and they took away the car... but he said he'd come home and his mom would just be sitting in a dark room, bawling.  His parents are great... but my husband say's he never felt like his parents loved him growing up, he could never turn to them or talk to them... so he turned to his friend for acceptance and followed the path of his older brother that did the same stuff... TO this day though... my husband will tell his parents "I love you"... they say "okay... or Thanks".   <br>  <br>  I think the most important thing not figuring a punishment... but figuring out WHY he is doing it to begin with.  You can punish him ALL you want... but if don't fix the source of the problems (is there trouble at home between you and your spouse, Does he feel pressure from school friends,  Does he have a little to much freedom for a 15 year old, does he feel pressure from an Older brother or sister?, Does he not feel good about himself,  Does he realize the effects this can have on him later in life? and what can happen if he gets caught again....)<br>  <br>  You can punish him alllll you want ( I would recommend a BIG punishment... community service, volunteering at a local human society, soup kitchens... he obviously has a little to much free times on his hand...)  But I'd make the reprocussions be more about educating him  what can happen if he continues on that path and getting to the underlying source.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!  And may the parenting gods be with you!|`|GGH0HVdvaa	Ground him on top of those other things he has to do. Until the 4 weeks of classes are up.|`|AA11285538	You're lucky he's 15 because because you still have the authority to discipline him.  My daughter got involved with drugs at 17 so I didn't have much time.  Since she could not seem to use good judgment I lovingly relieved her of that burden by making all her choices for her. First of all she needed to be separated from the crowd she was running with. For the first two weeks I escorted her to all her classes because she was skipping.  I gave her 24 hour supervision to the point of having in a trusted adult while I was at my job. She was told when to get up, when to eat, bathe, study, do chores etc.  She was resentful, rebellious, and had to earn every scrap of trust.  I gave her love, encouragement and support while at the same time stuck to my guns.  I even suffered criticism from other parents for being too hard on her.  It was the toughest challenge I've ever faced.  My baby was in danger and I was willing to do whatever it took to save her, no matter what.  Now, 14 years later she is a successful businesswoman who recently celebrated her 11th anniversary with a prince of a husband and two beautiful children.  To look at her now you would never guess that she had had one foot in her grave strung out on meth.  And that cool crowd?  One dead and one in prison and the rest I don't know.<br>  So having shared my experience I can answer your question like this:<br>  The most important step you can take is to get him away from the bad associations and keep him close to home until he shows he can be trusted.  Get over your anger and show a supportive and forgiving environment.  It will be YOUR influence that will guide him instead of his peers. And don't back down!  Not one inch!<br>  God bless|`|ev8ZZYx2aa	Well for starters take everything away from him - phone, tv, ipod, mp3 player, computers - and ground him to his room for that week. Have him do research on drugs and write a paper. Have him watch the TV show interventions every night and write a paper on that as well.|`|JWp9PMyRaa	BOOT CAMP..BOOT CAMP...BOOT CAMP..<br>  <br>  ALL SUMMER|`|hvghGmzAaa	send him to reform school.<br>  dont bother taking his stuff away.<br>  he's a crack head|`|CdJtH0xdaa	The best punishment is grounding him, or taking away something he really likes, such as the television, or his iPod or computer. If he wants his stuff back, he has to learn to take responsibility and learn he has to accept punishment and work to getting what he wants back. When he does straighten up his life by not taking drugs, you can let him have his stuff back. Good luck to you and your son.|`|n5URUEqXaa	I would take everything away from him.<br>  No phone.<br>  No friends.<br>  No computer.<br>  No TV<br>  No iPod/Zune.<br>  If he has to go out (library, ect.) have him chaperoned.<br>  Take anything he likes at all, out of his room.<br>  <br>  For the whole 4 weeks.<br>  That kid deserves to learn a lesson, the hard way.<br>  <br>  And talk to him, ask him why he wanted drugs. Try to connect with him, try to help him, because if you don't he'll go strait back after those 4 weeks are up.<br>  <br>  If I were you I would use a drug story that you had (if you didn't, make it up) and use that:<br>  <br>  "Sweetie, when I was 16 I tried acid with friends because I felt it would be fun, and an easy way to escape teenage life. I did acid for a few months and then your grandmother found out (get the grandparents involved so if he calls they dont go, WHAT) I had everything taken away, I couldnt be anywhere alone so that I could take acid, at first I felt it was totally unfair, but after awhile I learned that life wasnt so bad without it."<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|ld14iRCeaa	drug classes may be helpful. you could try making him do community service. if he is caught out in the real world with drug issues he will be lucky to only get that. if you  want to get to him quickly, take him to a rehab, have him talk to people in sever cases. then maybe a jail, they may let you talk to someone in jail for drugs. there are inmates and people in rehab who would be willing to help. and let him know, the only reason he isn't in more trouble is because he was safe inside school walls. what teens don't know is they have no clue what its like out there. My mother works for a high school and she said her school is now calling the police for every fight, or drug issue. they are not just slapping these kids on the wrists anymore with something as lame as suspension. they are getting into real legal trouble. I wish you luck and i hope you can get through to him before there are issues he may not come back from.|`|af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	The same thing just happened to my brother except they didn't catch anything on him, they read texts between him and several others and searched his locker and found cigarettes so he was suspended for a week, and what did my mom do!? NOTHING she just lectured him and told him he wasn't allowed to go to the skate park (claims guys there buy him the cigarettes). It's been 2 weeks since that and he still goes there it's like if nothing happened and it angers me because my mom has had several things brought to her attention to keep an eye on him and it's like it goes in one ear and out the other like she doesn't think he would actually do the things we tell her.<br>  <br>  but anyway If i was my mom or you, I would FOR REAL not let them go out ground them for a month or so, take their phone away, pick them up from school and take them to schoool. I would tell him that I have lost all trust in him and that I will search his room and things at random times every month and limit his money give him just enough for lunch at school if he's hungry or wants clothing or whatever YOU take him to the store for it. (lunch at schools rarely exceeds over $5) I hate when I see my mom give him more than 5 because I know what he will use it for. sometimes he tells her "i'm going to go buy pop at 7-11" b.s i wish my mom would just say ok i'll take you!. you need to be on his a** about this stuff. Idc if people think what I am saying is too tough because no one likes seeing their loved ones in these situations i wish i could do all this to my brother there's times when i know he's high as heck and he's talking to my mom and she doesn't even see it! it angers me how she can be so dumb sometimes we barely finish eating and he'll say mom can i have $10 to go eat and she gives it to him it's like "Are you serious" and i tell her "we just ate you know he's not going to buy food" and she doesn't say a single thing to him she gets mad and tells me "how do you know that if you know something tel me" but i'm so tired of telling her because she doesn't do anything about it! I am 20yrs old and have a 2 and a half yr old yes I know I'm young whatever though I have never touched any drug in my life and i made a promise to my grandpa who has passed away to never do it everyone around me does it though. This is why i am expressing myself so strongly about this I see how stupid people act on drugs and how parents let it slide like NOTHING. good luck though hun and I seriously hope you do take action against this<br>  <br>  threaten him also that you'll send him to boot camp or a private school or something tell him you are going to drug test him at the end of every month and that if it comes up that he has been using drugs he's going to have to pay the consequences.|`|S9sZawG2aa	im a 15 year old girl. i admit ive tried weed before but it was a while ago and luckily it didnt affect me... im a good kid for the most part (straight a's, goes to church). anyway, if i was a parent and my kid got suspended for that, this is what id do:<br>  <br>  take them out of regular school and enroll him in homeschooling. hire a nanny to watch him while you're at work. sign him up for lots of sports and classes outside of school... like tennis and photography|`|ameJkDgpaa	take him to a rehab center so he can see what happens to people who take drugs. Also take away everything and make him right a 5 page essay on why drugs are bad.If that doesn't work make sure doesn't go out and make him read books LOTS AND LOTS of books on what drugs do to you. it might seem harsh but it will all be worth it in the end..trust me|`|AA11510145	they have home drug test kits, buy some and have him tested every day until you are comfortable that he is not using. It's a just a urine test and you can buy them at almost any department store.

V3b5UaXsaa	buy the smallest bottle you can find, hold it right next to your nipple, be diligent and eventually once you fool her into believing it's the real thing she will slowly veer towards the bottle.|`|t9S0dqfLaa	I think it would help give you a break so your husband can feed her but she is at the age where seperation anxiety kicks in and it's normal for her to be clingy right now|`|8WOzftFuaa	she's probably clingy b/c you went back to work, but weaning might help, but it might just take time for her to get use to you being at work.<br>  but to wean her either continue pumping and only offering her bottles and in a few months you can start giving her whole milk... if ok with her dr|`|zVNQq33oaa	ITA with csj_mac !<br>  <br>  Your baby can't bite if she is correctly latched.<br>  <br>  She misses you. Weaning might actually make things worse. Nursing is her way of reconnecting with you.<br>  <br>  if you are determined to wean I would suggest taking it slowly. cut one nursing session out at a time every 4-5 days.|`|txv7TIgiaa	good luck i have beentrying to wean my daughter since 9 months and she is 14 months and still nurses at night|`|1795e9adbd644bbbce946795cd052957aa	Honestly, I don't think it will help.  You work 40h a week and she misses you.  My son weaned at 14mo and he became MORE clingy.  If we're nursing, weaning becomes the easy solution, but the truth is, being clingy, more attached to one parent over the other is normal.  It's also temporary.<br>  <br>  As for the biting, they do learn not to. Actually, they can't bite if they are nursing correctly.  Watch that during the feed, she doesn't get lazy with her latch and stop suckling.  If she does, use your pinky to break the suction and take her off - BEFORE she bites.  If she wants more, when you re-latch, she'll nurse correctly again.  If you do get bitten, resist the urge to pull her off.  That's what hurts the most.  Draw her IN as though you were protecting her, and then break the suction with your pinky and unlatch her.  They'll learn after being interrupted a few times.  And you'll learn how to stop it before it happens.<br>  <br>  If you still want to wean, the best way is gradual, starting with the least stressful nursing session for your daughter, which actually might be YOUR busiest and most stress ful time ie mornings.  If that goes wwll, and your body has adjusted to your decreased demand, try another feeding.  But, it's likely that the biting issue will resolve by then.

It was always done at home with a midwife for thousands of years.  Then at the beginning of the 1920's a doctor named Dr. DeLee decided it would be profitable to bring it into the hospital so he published a medical paper stating that midwives were dangerous and irresponsible and that a woman can not birth from her own body and that women are incompetent with birth.  Midwives were soon outlawed for many decades and birth was brought into the hospital and infant and maternal mortality skyrocketed.  It has gone down since, but is still much higher than within midwife communities, and the C- Section rate in the USA is 35% whereas with a midwife it is still 4%.|`|vZwJyqc6aa	I have heard people talk about being pregnant and say "9 months of hell" or something like that.

WxQFe0GYaa	I got the same email.  Please don't take your nutrition advice from a formula company!  Think about what their motivation is.  <br>  <br>  Talk to your baby's doctor.

AHRLXm1maa	This is a great question. Where do I even start? My mother has pretty much been to hell and back over the past 20 years. She was cheated on my father, and he left when I was 5, my one brother was 4, and my littlest brother was a newborn. She did anything and everything she could for me and my two brothers. We may not have had everything every single day but somehow she made it so that holidays were always special for us. She always found fun things for us to do that didn't cost too much money. She finally found love again and was cheated on by her second husband. She had gained so much weight over the years and lost all of it within the past couple of years. Shes just amazing in every way. Thats just the tip of the iceberg. I could literally write a book.|`|8n3NvYQwaa	My mom was always there....  My dad was a Navy man during the war and then in the Merchant Marines...

I actually dream of what I want to come true.|`|jJJ6KmVuaa	They are the best in the world, only because they carried you in their belly 9 months, they nursed you, they raised you, and they loved you!!!
q4JMjvGLaa	I understand how you are feeling. I had a miscarriage on October 15, 2008 and I still feel really sad at times about it. It just really bothers me and sometimes I can't help but think that I did something wrong. But we all know that that is the wrong thing to think. My best friend just recently had a baby and it was hard for me to go to the hospital after she had the baby because I was still grieving myself. But I had to put all of that aside and be there for her. I suggest that you get some counseling regarding this. I am sure that you will feel a whole lot better if you just talk to a professional or just someone that doesn't know you or anything about you so that you can get an pretty good perspective. I know that it is hard but try to pray and seek God and ask him to help you in these difficult times and ask him to help you with the grieving process. And he will! Maybe if you are around the baby more you may began to feel a little bit better. Everything will be fine and things will get better! Be Encouraged!|`|UGBL3wREaa	I am 100% with you! I was due in 13days. My heart is torn. I just want to sleep because I keep having very vivid dreams where my baby is fine and safe in my arms. It hurts to wake up because I know its not true. I'd suggest grief counseling or at least a support group. Crisis Pregnancy center has a list of local groups.|`|eKls7ooUaa	First off-I am so sorry to hear about your loss-miscarriages can be very tough.  If i were you-i would go talk to someone-just talking to someone other than family helps out a bunch.  Your sister should understand your feelings-afterall you are sisters and can tell what is wrong with each other.  I hope this helps, and maybe try for another-it might be too soon for you-but knowing that you will have a baby will help ease the pain of losing the first angel.  My prayers are with you and your little angel.|`|ed25e3241d18e15b57724f2aebccd9b3aa	if you are still having problems dealing with the loss of you baby, it may be time for you to go and talk to your doctor about maybe getting you on some low dose antidepressents. just be cause you didnt give birth doesnt mean that you dont have some post partum depression. and its ok to be jealous of your sister. you lost a baby and that hurts really bad. also it wouldnt be a bad idea to be honest with your sister and let her know that you are having a hard time and that she shouldnt take offense to you not being around. usually if you are honest, people are more understanding. its ok what you are going through and some times your body needs a little help to adjust and to get through the hard times. and just know in your heart that you lost the baby for a reason. and when the time is right you WILL have a healthy hapy perfect baby. good luck honey and i know exactly what you are going through,|`|iFSw87M0aa	Hi, sorry for your loss, first thing first, please be sad, mourn, be angry, get all of what you feel out, do not keep your emotions bottled up. Next, Explain to your sister that you are still grieving and that you are happy for her but seeing her with baby makes you feel sad. Still come around sis and family, you actually need them and your neice/nephew as a part of  the recovery process. By pushing them all away this may create resentment, If this does not help or you are in a darker state of depression seek some professional help please, Good Luck to you!|`|AVL2IS7Laa	i had a miscarriage in june 2008 and feel the same way you do also i blame myself. i hate that every one was so quick to forget my loss, if you would like to email me so we can talk about it then you can, if only people really knew what you are going through.|`|CeylRxK4aa	try therapy. if you haven't dealt with it well on your own this far, you may not be able to....try a therapist, maybe your obgyn can recommend someone specialized for you.  <br>  I am sorry for your loss, please take care of yourself.|`|NOnBAKKhaa	It's not something that goes away I had mine 12 years ago and still get that way.My advice to you is talk to someone or it will get worse believe me I know.|`|AA12259102	Grief counseling.Tell your sister the truth I'm sure she'd understand.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Well, start by allowing yourself to feel sad!   You have a right to morn the loss of a pregnancy that was never going to be.   After that I suggest that a mood stabilizer such as Prozac is okay to take, in all honesty!  <br>  <br>  Also reframe it, I really believe 1st trimester miscarriages are a blessing since they are usually grossly deformed and not going to be a baby anyway, so our bodies do us the favor of stopping a pregnancy that isn't.  I am glad that my pregnancy that wasn't going to be a baby ended at 12 weeks, it was a good thing not the end of the world.|`|JWp9PMyRaa	Talk to your sister...tell her how you feel..Im sure she will understand<br>  <br>  best of luck to you

Congratulations mama!|`|7ktbbv2Maa	yes you are preggo|`|gzFNg0NOaa	first off CONGRATS!!!!!! <br>  second, if you are close with your mother or father I would let them know first. If there is a close relationship between you and your mother, maybe she would like to go with you to your first dr. visit? If you are fairly independent and live on your own then I would let them know once I have confirmed with the dr. Goodluck!!! and best wishes :)|`|qfnWZ3twaa	mommy|`|ycqXAzdWaa	congrats!!!!!! wish me luck tooo!
opQbQVreaa	Go and get the book "Taking Control of your Fertility" It will help you tremendously! The OPK tests are not always reliable and can give false positives. They only predict when you will ovulate by testing for the LH surge in your urine. They are suposed to be able to tell you within 24-36 hrs of ovulation time. There are alot of factors that can cause false positives.<br>  <br>  The best signal to look for when trying to find out when you ovulate is a signal that your own body gives you. You cervical mucus will become clear and streatchy like egg whites when you are about to ovulate. You can also chart your body basal temp to find out the date of ovulation to see if you planned intercourse around the right time.<br>  <br>  Also please keep in mind that a perfectly healthy couple can have sex 2 times a week, every week, for an entire year and still miss the fertility window. Even if you do time intercourse at the time of ovulation there is only about a 30% chance that you will concieve.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!
iqz2tYEBaa	If you are not feeling sick, you should be taking it with a meal.  It doesn't really matter which meal though.  I usually take mine with dinner because that is my most consistent daily meal.  Breakfast and lunch times vary so that works best for me.|`|JIhpmOlRaa	I take mine immediately before bed.  Any other time of the day is to risky due to my constant quesiness!!|`|hameOvsyaa	I take it around 11 or 12 but it doesnt really matter just as long as you take it.|`|NPmRmnG6aa	It does not matter what time of day you take them. I take mine at night right before bed since in my first trimester they made me sick. Now they don't but I am in a routine and if I change it I feel like I will forget to take them. I am only taking my pre Natal's|`|uuHPneEcaa	doesn't matter as long as ur taking them I take mine at night with a full glass of water and with a slice of bread. (i have to take iron medication in the morning and doctor doesn't want me taking them too close together)<br>  <br>  I take prima care one (they are purple) they include:<br>  Omega-3 Fatty Acids 300 mg <br>  Linoleic Acid 30 mg <br>  Linolenic Acid 30 mg <br>  Vitamins: <br>  Vitamin C (as Ester-C )* 25 mg <br>  Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) 170 IU <br>  Vitamin E (dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate) 30 IU <br>  Folic Acid, USP 1 mg <br>  Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine hydrochloride) 25 mg <br>  Minerals: <br>  Calcium 150 mg <br>  Iron (carbonyl iron) 27 mg<br>  <br>  the 1st ones i took made me very sick.. i took them with dinner i kept throwing them up.. so my doctor gave a bunch to try and those are the only ones that didn't make me sick|`|s1utniuvaa	I take mine after dinner when I have a full tummy, it makes me feel less nauseous. When I took them in the morning or mid-day I would feel really sick. The only down side to that is if I eat dinner late I have to get up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom because my vitamins have stool softeners in them that work pretty fast.|`|T48smu01aa	I just take prenatal vitimans and I take them right before I go to bed...I notice when I took them in the morning I got sick...but thats all you need to take unless a doctor says other wise :)<br>  Good luck and congrats!|`|gCBqdHf2aa	It doesn't matter, my doctor just recommened right before bed in case they make you sick you'll sleep through it. I take Neevo. I was taking Precare but I saw a recall on them.|`|QYYWBrG7aa	it doesnt matter when u take them but i take mine before i go to bed at night.|`|teptsmeKaa	I personally take my pre-natal vitamin every morning with breakfast, because I once read that your body takes nutrients from your body best in the morning as opposed to later in the day. Plus it's easier for me to remember to take it at the same time time everyday.<br>  So I figured taking it then would be best (although I doubt it matters).<br>  I don't take any other supplements, if you eat a a healthy diet majority of the time (we all slip up sometimes, that's what the prenatal is for!) You should be just fine. <br>  I wouldn't advise taking anything else supplemental (besides a prenatal) without first consulting your midwife/doctor.|`|ksoMldqYaa	I take mine at night along with a Vit C tablet.  At breakfast I take a Calcium+D tablet.  It doesn't matter what time of day you take your pre-natal, I asked my OB-GYN.

My OB doctor though said you can take it anytime just try to stay on schedule.|`|uTEr67Bhaa	I take mine first thing in the morning.  It really doesn't matter what time of day you take them.

tQPvv0Glaa	Yes, it's okay, but it's actually better to just drink regular water.  Vitamin water has a lot of calories, so unless you need the extra calories, I'd just stick with regular water.|`|vZwJyqc6aa	Yes but I personally wouldn't drink anything with artificial sweeteners in it (Splenda, sucralose, etc.) It's not healthy any time, especially when you are pregnant.|`|AA11729974	It's probably OK to drink vitamin water, but since i became pregnant i switched to plain water mixed with a splash of unsweetened pomegranate, cherry, or cranberry juice--more nutritious, less sugar, and no question about safety.  Try it also in plain seltzer.|`|y5sWmbtnaa	I haven't drank them all, as some contain Taurine and other ingredients like that and I am unaware of the safety of those products during pregnancy,  however I have drank ones that only lightly contained vitamins.|`|2MvI9cpTaa	Please ask your doctor when it comes to the heath of your baby.|`|4sr1Mn7yaa	vitamin water is nothing but pure sugar

It still sounds a little old fashioned. Joy is cute.<br>  Isabelle: 8/10. A hot name right now, so a lot of little girls will be given this name. At least it's a gorgeous one, right?<br>  Kenadie: 7/10. I like it, but I personally think this spelling is unnecessary. Kennedy just looks so much better.<br>  Courtland: 8/10. It's unusual, but I did know a girl named Courtland once! <br>  Jona: 4/10. Not a fan.<br>  Adelyn: 6/10. Ehhh. I'm not sure on this one. <br>  Analyn: 6/10. Same as above. I like Anna Lynn as separate names though.|`|AA10717711	I don't like the spellings of Kenadie or Jordin.  <br>  <br>  Courtland and Jona seem like boy names, and the rest seem like girl names.  <br>  <br>  I don't like Ronna.

C4miEeuYaa	I'm sorry if I offend anyone with this response, but I don't like the name Danielle. For some reason, any Danielle I've EVER met has always been mean to me. In elementary school, this girl Danielle came up to me and straight forwardly said,"Me and my friends don't like you. Leave us alone." Then in middle school a girl named Danielle who lived in my neighborhood talked about me and made fun of me. Then in high school, a girl named Danielle and me both dated the same guy. Enough said there. And then when I was 21, I worked with a girel named Danielle and she was incredibly 2 faced. And we got into a few heated arguments because of this. Isn't that wierd?

be5b6f02c20b23ba0ebd00d8685794a0aa	Unfortunately men claiming they had a vasectomy are pretty common (so i am told).  The alternative is his vasectomy failed.  My ex-girlfriend worked in a clinic and she said that almost half of the men that get vasectomies never return to get a semen analysis.<br>  <br>  Most doctors recommend getting a semen analysis done twice, then every so many years after a vasectomy.  Most men are not very well sex educated (but think they are), and therefore have no idea what a semen analysis is unless they have had one done.  I suggest she ask him when he had his last semen analysis.  If he does not know what that is, then it is a good bet that he lied about having a vasectomy.  <br>  <br>  Why lie about something like that when it is very likely to get him into big trouble?  Well, he is not the one that has to carry the baby for nine months.  Selfish huh?|`|iqz2tYEBaa	10 days past ovulation is pretty early to be having pregnancy symptoms, but anything is possible I suppose.

SaX09eNtaa	My daughter is 11 months old and I think she should be feeding herself more than she does (with her fingers).  She eats cereal puffs and things like that fine, but when I give her a piece of green bean, or cooked carrot, she just squishes it with her fingers.  When she is finally ready to try and put it in her mouth, she can't, because it's mushed to much to get there.  She has actually started to try and grap the little fork I use, so I've let her take it, and I help guide it to her mouth.  But she definitely has a way to go to actually do it herself.  Be patient, use big handled toddler spoons and forks and he'll want to do it himself just like she did eventually!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I have close friends who's daughter was completely uninterested in feeding herself until about 16 months.

They don't always hit there mouths and when they throw a fit your walls and carpets suffer. So feeding him at this age is perfectly acceptable. He will learn eventually. I have the exact opposite problem. My 1rst daughter was so independent she wanted to feed herself at 9 months and had total FITS if I didn't let her. Resteraunts were nightmares and I ended up cleaning more than feeding. Its no fun.|`|gm5IE97uaa	my son is 11 months and can feed himself cheerios and things like that, but I havent tried him out with a spoon because I know it would be disastrous.  I figured that a year was a little young to feed oneself with a spoon, but I could be wrong.  I'm not baby expert, after all.  <br>  <br>  For me, I will start Kingston on a spoon when he is a little older than one.  Probably about 14 months or so because right now, he doesnt have the patience to do it himself.|`|0iIDAHldaa	I have an 18-month old son & he didn't start feeding himself until about 2 months ago...and now he's a pro. I just worked with him, holding the spoon in his hand & guiding it to his mouth. Another idea that really made a difference was letting him pretend. I would give him an empty small bowl and a spoon & he would walk around "eating" pretend food & feeding it to me like I would do to him. Honestly, that probably made the biggest difference out of everything.|`|e69eadb67f7b4293d10244929db51c6aaa	Give him a spoon of his own to hold while you feed him. I learnt this will give him the push to try feeding himself with the spoon. You may help by puuting some food on the spoon too.<br>  He is still quite young and may only be able to feed himself when he is 3 or 4. Well for most kids around here thats the practice otherwise they just nibble at the food and are off chasing after something they find interesting. My son is 15 months but I m not worried about me feeding him. Just be patient it'll take a while.|`|Rhr1umV1aa	Try getting spoons that are big handled for babies. You can get them at kmart, walmart, target virtually anywhere that sells baby stuff. Dollar stores even carry them. It might make him more interested.
b8e17f565936253241a343443917ca6baa	Talk to your Cubmaster or Pack Committee (if you have one) and just tell them that you're burnt out on fundraisers and that you'd prefer to just pay extra for the activities that your kids choose to participate in.  They ought to be willing to work with you. - - Talk to a couple other parents too, cause they may feel the same way.  Perhaps you or some like-minded parents could get involved in the planning for the Pack and come up with some ways to trim costs or restructure the way things are funded (i.e. if most parents would rather just pay for things out of pocket than have to do fundraisers).<br>  <br>  For what it's worth, we do the standard Cub Scout popcorn sale every fall and we make enough money on that to fund everything we do for the entire year (other than $5 a person here and there that we ask for various optional activities like camping overnighters).  Our Pack is very active and is very healthy financially and all we do is popcorn.|`|459948c9c4124486ce62f73d24b95fe3aa	Unfortunately you nailed it on the head, these things happen.  Have you discussed it with any other parent first to see if they are willing to do the same thing?  Unless you have some backing it's not very likely they are going to change it.  Do many of the other parents do the buy out or do they actually take the fundraising and do it themselves?  If they don't do buying out then they probably aren't going to back your idea either.  Your personal opinion on things isn't giong to change how it works unless there are others that feel the same way.  Talk to a few parents first and see how they feel about it, if there is a good number that agree with you, as a group you can all talk to the leader and see how it goes.|`|BRT2teSqaa	Why are you buying it?  Why arent your sons selling it?  Have them go to door ( with you in the sidewalk of course) to ask for sales.  Have them stand outside of a busy store/market to ask customers (with your supervision).  It's their pack, they should be the ones selling it.  Atleast over half of it.<br>  <br>  Our kids stand outside of Jewel/Osco on Saturday mornings to sell candy with us in the car parking lot very close by.  They sell out very fast.  They usually go for just an hour at a time.  It's their sport/activity.  They learned if they want to play the games and have fun, they have to work and earn for their team.|`|RKTNDLDKaa	All clubs do this.   <br>  <br>  You could suggest that, as a group, the kids take turns running a booth outside the local Wal-Mart on Saturdays for a couple of Saturdays and make the sales during those times.   <br>  <br>  You could suggest that, to raise money, that you hold a garage sale and all the proceeds go towards the club.   Or maybe hold a car wash.  <br>  <br>  In our area, there's an Incredible Pizza (pizza/arcade) that will let groups buy a $10 game cards (work as tokens) for $4 and the group can sell them for a profit, like $7 or $8.    I think most people prefer to spend their money on items that they feel is a good deal, rather than a $3 candy bar.    <br>  <br>  Out of fairness for the rest of the pack, I'd say you'll go ahead and have to just buy the candy yourself.     You don't want for the leader and the other kids to resent your son for not participating in the selling of the candy.       You could always donate the candy to a shelter for domestic violence women and children.     You could probably even get a write off for tax purposes.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	Let the cubmaster know your situation, privately.  S/he will figure out a way for the other parents & families to pick up your slack.<br>  <br>  Scouts are volunteer run organizations.  If you want your son to be involved and you don't like the way this pack is being managed, you have a couple of options.  You could take him out of this pack & get him involved in another.  Or, you could volunteer to be part of the financial managing & planning next year.|`|AA10043485	As an ex-Cub leader, you have a lot of options. The one I would recommend is joining the committee- the group of adults setting the policies- as a voice for reason.<br>  <br>  Cub packs vary widely in how much money they need and how they get it. Our pack had a moderately complicated system, but we were also in a lowish income area.<br>  <br>  We determined the basic needs- as a pack, as dens, for each Cub, etc. Did the pack want to pay for leader training? What patches and pins did we pay for? etc.<br>  <br>  We had pack and den dues to cover the rock-bottom needs and very little else.<br>  <br>  We used a couple of small fundraisers for pack needs (supplies, training, small budget cushion, etc.) All Cubs were expected to help with these, and they generally involved a couple hours of mild work (cleaning lots, working fairs, etc.).<br>  <br>  Then, we had fundraisers that the Cubs could use to raise their own money for camping or other Scout-related purposes. Did not want to take part in one of these? No big deal- it was your money kept in an account for you.<br>  <br>  Anything your Den Leader wanted to do that dues or other funds did not cover had to figure out how to pay for it, usually things like zoo trips, etc. that each family usually had to cover.<br>  <br>  By being a part of the planning team, you can help with that sort of thing.
XjJmIQJhaa	my chemistry teachers mother couldn't get pregnant so she took her temperature every day to see whether she was ovulating or not.  Once there was a slight temperature rise she knew that she was ovulating and she called her husband home from work and they hanky pankied and that's how my chemistry teacher was created!!!<br>  <br>  check your temperature daily as soon as you wake up they sell thermometers specifically for that purpose at your local pharmacy, and good luck<br>  <br>  10 pts if you like this answer!|`|NaJPIOheaa	its true your cycles can be everywhere after getting off birth control, your hormones are all out of whack. have you ever though about a herbal remedies? i was never on BC but i had very irregular cycles and started taking agnus castus(vitex), which there are many many success story's here on Y!A, just look them up! anyways it helped regulate periods and ovulation, and i actually get a period every month! i think i answered a question about fertilitea for you also, and i also drink 1 cup of this a night, and it also has vitex in it. otherwise if your not into that i'd recommend getting OPK's, but those can be hard to know when to test when your cycles are so long, or you can look for the main ovulation signs such as egg white cervical mucous, BBT temp rise, and your cervix will me high and soft. I'd recommend reading the book "taking charge of your fertility", its helped me tons!! good luck dear xo|`|kTu7UtS1aa	Invest in a fertility monitor.  It will tell you when you are fertile, so you will know when it's the best time to have sex.  It worked for me.  Good luck to you.|`|fPHjh4Jsaa	you have more sex? or sex every day|`|285e8b302bc60e4817f5d45c744bdcfeaa	You first need to see your gyno to get your cycles regulated. Once they are regulated, than you will be able to pinpoint ovulation(by either charting, or using ovulation predictors). From there you can have sex 4 days before, the day of, and 3 days after ovulation. Best of wishes, and tons of baby dust!!|`|273vsUezaa	do the nasty with your homeboy every day other than BJ week when Aunt Flo comes to visit. <br>  <br>  You can't just increase your chances of getting pregnant, you can, however, decrease in things that make you NOT get pregnant. The number one thing that gets people pregnant- Sex.|`|eLaXNLz2aa	Basically the best way is chart your ovulation. Normally having sex every other day around that time is what is recommended. Make sure your body is healthy ( ie sleep no smoking eat healthy) and you are taking your pre natal vitamins. and Relax! Remember the old saying "a watched pot won't boil" same principle. :) Good Luck!|`|WIQhh62Zaa	Do you use the ovulation strips?  If not, try those.  I've attached a link for the site I was recommended by my massage therapist.  She said they have great prices compared to many stores and they have a variety of different types of tests you can purchase.|`|scdOdaTKaa	Well take your prenatal vitamins, eat healthy, and I would just have sex at least every 3 days until your period comes. You can always chart your bbt and cm and that should give you an indication if you are ovulating or not.  Your temp well remain low and then after you ovulate will jump up and remain up that tells you taht you did in fact ovulate. Since you don't have regular cycles you can't count days and take and OPK, so I would just do the bbt and take your vitamins.  Have fun trying make it fun not a chore.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|1GxMGmkqaa	to regulate your period, go on the pill for a couple months. then go off it and dont worry - just start planning. the more you worry, the less chance of conception. jsut keep enjoying your life with your hunnie and know taht you will become a 3some in no time!
Fh4B88ZGaa	It's much too early for you to be experiecing pregnancy symptoms. You have to wait until you miss a period, and then take a test. A doctor wouldn't even want to see you at this point.|`|SCY0bOr5aa	You asked the question twice.....|`|eKls7ooUaa	either take a home pregnancy test-you were ovulating around the times you had sex-then you should call your dr immediately! Tired, and sore boobs and spotting could be a sign of pregnancy-the spotting is when it implants to your wall.

Not only are you risking a pregnancy - but STDS and HPV (a contributing factor of a form of cervical cancer). If you can't afford contraception on your own - talk to Planned Parenthood, they can help you!<br>  Back on to your spotting....you could be having a miscarriage, you could have fibroids, it could just be how your period is choosing to present itself this month, it could be an STD, or it could be a pregnancy. It could be many things - but it certainly sounds like something. This could be a smart time to talk to a doctor, if for nothing else but peace of mind....as you said, you are 20 years old - not a little kid - so lets start making some adult decisions....and when you get through this, get yourself protected! Unprotected sex is like playing Russian Roulet - are you aware that there has been a huge increase of STDS in people your age? Gonnorhea is everywhere that you want to be!|`|q4JMjvGLaa	I understand that your boyfriend wants you to go to the doctor but at the same time if you are concerned that you are pregnant you have to wait until your next period is due. I do not know if your cycles are regular but if they are please wait until the day that your period is due or a couple days before and take a pregnancy test at home. Then you will know what you will need to do at that point (after you get the result). It is possible to experience symptoms that quick as I experienced the same thing but I had no idea I could be pregnant. When I found out I was pregnant I thought hmmm that explains certain things that were going on within my body. The brownish/pinkish discharge you are having coul possibly be implantation bleeding and the cramps could be implantation cramps. I hope this helps!

aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	At that age, I do think that a Sit and Stand stroller would be a aste of money.  <br>  <br>  However, you can purchase any stroller (or use your current one) for the new baby, and purchase what is called a "buggy board" that will attach to it.  It would not have a seat, but it could fold down to give him a platform to ride on if he gets too tired to walk.  It is not very expensive, either.|`|8qw0Cdqiaa	I'm looking into getting one of these strollers as well.  I will have an infant in May and my almost 4 year old will ride on the back.  For me this kind of stroller is a necessary evil since my son does not keep up whenever we walk anywhere.  He insists on walking several feet behind and it doesn't matter how slow we're going.  It's just piece of mind for me knowing that if I need it, an extra seat is available for him.  Even at 4 their little feet can get quite tired from walking so it's handy.

WxQFe0GYaa	Sounds like he just has a cold.  Don't use the nasal sucker so much that he gets nosebleeds!!!<br>  <br>  99.5 is not really a fever.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Sounds like a cold.  The nasal aspirator is pretty useless if they are constantly producing snot.  It really only works well if they are clogged up with harder snot.  If their nose is running like a faucet, it's better to squirt some saline up their nose to clean it out, in my experience and it's not as damaging to their nasal passages.|`|DzPZ8EEkaa	You should use a cool mist vaporizer/humidifier in his room at night as well, for the bloody nose issue to keep his mucus membranes moist and help prevent the bleeding.  You can also use saline nose drops.  <br>  <br>  It sounds like a cold to me.  I would consult your pediatrician though.  No one can take the place of their educated opinion.  If he/she is concerned they will have you bring him in.  <br>  <br>  You could try offering him a cold moistened wash cloth to gum just to see if that helps at all.  If so, maybe he is teething.....on top of his sniffles.|`|S8AHaPv6aa	Hello!  I have a ten month old who sounds exactly the same and he has a viral infection with an added cold!  Try not to use the nose plunger, let him sneeze it out, it will stop him getting a bad head as much.  My son hasn't been right since before Christmas and the doctor blames it on the weather.  yeah right!  If his temperature goes high, use nurofen.  Some babies cut their teeth with colds and infections, it's just hard when they can't tell you themselves!  Good luck xx|`|t9S0dqfLaa	I agree with momsey, you're not supposed to use the plunger too much. I would get his nose checked out to see why it's bleeding.  Actually I would never hesitate to take my baby to the doctor for anything.  My doc probably thinks I'm annoying but I could care less.|`|d747480bf8433fcbdc75cec48052dc38aa	instead of using the "nose plunger" try wiping his nose with a tissue or a wash cloth.  you're really not supposed to be using it that often anyway.  if his nose is only bleeding when you use it, that's probably the source.  if it bleeds at other times then you should probably get that checked out with your doctor.  from all the books i read while i was pregnant, 99.5 doesn't really seem to be a fever.  if you don't already have one, you should probably consider going out to get a humidifier or a vaporizer and try running that, it's supposed to help a lot if you're baby gets a little cold.<br>  <br>  at 9 months, if you think you're baby has a fever you could always call your doctor and ask them if/how much tylenol drops you can give to your baby, they do great wonders for mild fevers.<br>  <br>  when your baby is coughing because of the nasal drip just make sure you have him sitting up while he's coughing.
T0gv52CDaa	Don't let her sleep 5-7 hours during the day.  Wake her up, feed her, then keep her awake by playing with her, singing to her, reading to her, etc.  When she wakes up in the evenings, hold and feed her, but let that be it.  Do not let night time be fun or entertaining.  Conversely, make don't let day time be boring.  Eventually she will learn that night time is for sleeping since there is nothing else to do, and that day time is much more fun for being awake.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	What's the problem?  She's 11 weeks old.  They sleep and eat on crazy schedules.  Over the next month or so a more recognizable pattern will probably emerge.  But that constantly changes as well.|`|ggETPqedaa	It sounds like she has her nights and days mixed up to me. Try to wake her up after three hours of sleeping in the day time. I had to do that to my son, he would sleep 5-6 hours during the day at nap time if I had allowed him. He's now sleeping from 9 pm untill about 5-7 am.|`|AA10064551	I think she is fine, just make sure that in the morning when she wakes up at 6 or 7 and plays for 2 hours then goes back to sleep. Don't let her sleep for as long as you have been letting her 5-7 hours is way too much in a daytime and is what she should be doing at night. She's a little backwards with nigh and day but like I said don't let her sleep that long, the longest she should sleep during the day is 3-4 hours but if you can try not to even go that long. when my son was that age we never let him go more than 2 hours when sleeping during the day.<br>  <br>  You could also try doing her bath and night routine later at night around 9:30 so then you feed her around 10:15-10:30 then I bet you anything she will fall asleep no later then 11pm and will sleep at least a min of 5. My son started sleeping through the night at 9 weeks once we started doing this. He is 24 weeks and has a great sleep pattern, day and night.|`|vbPOQ2KEaa	You're going to think that I am evil, but this really worked for my son.<br>  <br>  First, is her room dark?  It made a HUGE difference for my daughter.  She was up and down all night until we realized that she needed room darkening shades.  As soon as we did that, she slept through the night.<br>  <br>  My son was born 10lbs. 8 oz.  While in the hospital (we had to stay a few days because he was jaundiced), the constant lighting threw him off and he didn't have a normal sleeping pattern.  He came home and slept all day except for feedings, and then was up all night.  After 2 days of this, I called my doctor.  He said that at 10 lbs, he should be able to take in enough nourishment to last the night, and that I needed to keep him up during the day so he would be sleepy at night. <br>  <br>  My sister and I spent the next day rousting him every time he fell asleep.  We'd wash his face with cool wash cloths, and play with him and bounce him around.  By evening, he was exhausted.  He breastfed at probably 10:30 ish, and fell asleep and slept through the night (he was 8 days old. I was careful not to let him nap too long during the next few days and he continued to sleep through the night from then on.<br>  <br>  Now this had a lot to do with size, and ability to get enough food intake to make it through the night, so I would never try this on a smaller baby, but it worked for him and he's 27 now, and not showing any signs of trauma from his one week old experience.  LOL!!!|`|w3ob12X6aa	my daughter is 12 weeks old and she use to have a crazy schedule then i just started to get her in one and now she is doing great she might sleep better at night if you dont have her sleep 5,6, or 7 hours during the day, maybe try to keep her up a little because my daughter had her days and nights mixed up she would be up all night and sleep all day but now she sleeps from 9or10-usually 7am then i feed her she goes back to sleep til 9am and then is awake for awhile usually gets a little fussy around 1pm then sleeps till 3pm and is awake most of the time till bed time again but how i did it was always put her down to sleep at the same time and it just became a habit but i never let her sleep long periods of time throughout the day or she wouldnt sleep at night, but good luck|`|zVNQq33oaa	Hang in there! What she is doing is normal for some babies. Like the other poster said, it will work itself out eventually.
H0fXySX9aa	your fine hun so don't worry|`|wl7tlYOYaa	This is not a sick question is understandable that your worried. No it wont hurt the baby but you have to make sure your careful so bacteria from the back door doesnt get into your vagina because then you can get an infection and that would be bad. I think its okay but I wouldnt do it just because if when your not preg its uncomfortable I dont know how it would feel while your preg and everything already aches lol. Good luck. you can ask your doctor is your still wondering.|`|uuHPneEcaa	u can have sex, but if u feel that unconfortable about having anal then don't do it.. let him know that u don't its safe for the baby. But I am sure u can contact ur doctor and ask him that is ur best bet. I ask my doctor everything even if its a stupid question (Not that this is stupid of anything).. But I don't think it will hurt the baby if u have anal. good luck.<br>  <br>  I was 5 months when I had sex again with my boyfriend I didn't wanna do it then because I was scared I was going to hurt my baby. but its perfectly normal to have sex while pregnant. they say thats the best sex in the world is pregnant sex. and when I did get confortable with having sex IT WAS GREAT!! I haven't had sex since then because me and my baby's father have gone our seprate ways but hey it was good while it lasted.<br>  <br>  hope ur not constipated.. cause then.. that will be a hell of a mess.. SORRY.. nasty i know but still..|`|5RvTXdmUaa	Yes, lol, but once the baby gets bigger and everything is all cramped up in there, you probably wont want that in "there".|`|3X0t8JrXaa	It won't hurt the baby but it can become uncomfortable to you.|`|T48smu01aa	no its fine :)...just make sure that if anythng feels different wrong,painful or anything don't do it...but its fine to do it!|`|vZwJyqc6aa	I don't think there is any reason it would hurt but why not have regular sex? I don't understand men that like that.|`|AA12192310	anything that isn't too uncomfortable for you will not hurt the baby.if it hurts or stresses you then the baby is in stress. use lots of lube and go slow in the beginning and all should be ok|`|lv6gkEVaaa	You dont sound very nice
st2zmU88aa	its actually easier, right before a women goes through menopause she has an increased risk of pregnancy.|`|wLwNIxPpaa	yeah and your babies have a higher chance of getting everything (sids,mental stuff,downs and aborts)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.epigee.org/menopause/pregnancy.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.epigee.org/menopause/pregnanc...</a>|`|v0596BTeaa	Yes.  As you enter the peri-menopause your periods become less regular - I had four last year - and your cervix and womb are less receptive to sperm.  Your eggs are not the quality that they were when you were younger.  It becomes more difficult to conceive and you are at a higher risk of having a disabled baby.|`|652f1ace7d0e4554d654822f229e8c9daa	yes very much so!! the closer you are to menopause its a small percentage to get pregnant, but it could happen. Never say never|`|iP863XM6aa	Doesnt really make a difference, but it is more dangerous though (could have more complications during labour)|`|JWp9PMyRaa	not sure...but it can cause complications...<br>  and or the baby can come with many birth defects|`|YyiESOpFaa	i believe it is.because when you get to that point in your life, I don't believe you can really have kids anymore.
deIzFnV8aa	First on how much sleep she should be getting - when they say "10-12 hours" of night sleep, they mean total. At this age (and until 9 months or so!) babies need to eat at least once during the night, maybe twice. If they don't wake for it, that is fine, but if they do, they should eat.  The 4-5 hours of nap time are supposed to be "3 naps of 1 1/2 hours each", which is this phantom standard we all reach for in vain; most babies are catnappers by nature, and it takes some work and luck to change that.<br>  <br>  So 3 months is when babies start to control their sleep by more than just their biological need for it.  Yes, they fight sleep, because the great wide world is just that interesting!  Because they can learn better now, now is a great time to start a bedtime routine and consistent bedtime. You may have already doen that, but if not, it really helps baby to feel tired at the appropriate time, and hence fall asleep faster.  A bedtime routine should be about a half hour of soothing activities, always done in the same order, plus a feed before and after.  If she is falling asleep during the feed, I suggest taking off some of her clothes to help her stay awake long enough to finish her bottle (like unbottoning part of her onesie).  Or a diaper change. Ideally she will be drowsy but slightly awake when she finaally goes to bed, so she can start learnign to put herself to sleep. Yes, that means you will be running in every few minutes for maybe 15 mintues total, as she tries and fails. But it is worth it in the long run. You really don't want her learning to nurse to sleep, from the stories of people whose babies got in this habit.  Even if you can just get her semi-awake for like 5 minutes after eating, enough to sing a song or something, I think it will help that association. Also, pick an earlish bedtime so she isn't overtired to start wiht, which just makes it harder.  Try to be fairly consistent so she learns to be tired around that time. At her age she should get the hang of it w/in a week.<br>  <br>  Naptimes: You are probably already watching for her sleepy signs and getting her right off for a nap, which makes it soooo much easier. I found a very short naptime routine also helped. When DD yawns I put on her sleep sack, give her a pacifier, go into her room and sing "it is nap time, it is nap time" to the tune of Frere Jacques, with the rest of the words improvised :P  Then I put her down and turn on white noise.<br>  <br>  So from the preceding paragraph you can see several of the things that helped us extend naps.  Putting on her fleecy sleep sack even for naps was a big one. its cold even during the day in the winter and I think that helped a lot.  A pacifier is a mixed blessing agnd should be used with caution - she will go back to sleep much more easily during a nap time if I stick it back in, but she has also started waking some at night and wanting it.  White noise is a real winner, though. I use nature sound MP3, like ocean waves, that I found free online and burned to a CD. There are also tons of CDs available, or a cute stuffed toy called a Sleepy Sheep.  I play it while she is falling asleep, and I also make sure it is playing during the "danger time" of when she usually wakes up prematurely (that was 20-25 minutes for us).  Lurking at the door during the danger time also can help - at the first noise go right in at shhhhh them.  They can learn to fall asleep by themselves at the beginning of naptime :P If I let DD wake up completey during a nap it is all over; if I am quick sometimes she would go right back to sleep. After a couple days of rushing to the rescue you may find she isn't waking up at the "danger time" anymore.  Do these things we are pretty consistently up to 45-60 minute naps, sometimes longer.  DD still often needs a "bonus" 4th nap in the evening to tide her over to bedtime, but we are doing a lot better than we were!<br>  <br>  Hope a few of these ideas might work to help you!|`|0iIDAHldaa	Is she getting enough to eat? You may need to up her formula/breastmilk because although you may not realize it, she may be ready for more. You can also try putting rice cereal into her bottle to help satisfy her more & help her sleep..do this before bedtime. Also, she could be cutting teeth...check & if she is, follow up with infant motrin or infant tylenol to help ease the pain & help her sleep. Riding around in the car is also a good idea to help her get to sleep if you are having problems with that.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	My daughter went through this, too. She's still not a great sleeper, I think it's normal for some babies. My daughter is seven months old and still wakes every three hours to eat at night. She doesn't like to take naps, if I'm lucky she'll take two a day, usually only one.|`|vZwJyqc6aa	buy or rent the video "happiest baby on the block" It will help. It has some strategies in there to calm your baby down and help them sleep.
iFSw87M0aa	FRUGALITY is key- I am a mom of four children they are all under the age of three, it is hard, my husband and I are a long way from millionaires, but we cut corners and try to save as much as possible, We limit eating out, we save change, The kids get clothes for the year on Christmas and Birthdays, whenever the clothes may be on sell, They also wear hand me downs, they are pretty much the same size and are 11 months apart. I thought of the daycare, but there are so many factors to it, What do you do when you have appointments? You have to hire someone to be your assistant? Are you able to handle the amount of children? Another suggestion is working a Part-Time Job, or Full-Time second or third shift job. I work Part Time as an Activity Assistant at a Drop in Care Child Center, I am even able to take my three oldest children to work with me for free. Good Luck to you! Remember, some people are luckier than others, I am blessed that I am able to spend time with my children, and also get a mixture of "adult time" and "adult conversation", I love my children but having 4 at a very young age can cells out me being able to open a home daycare, I am a home daycare, LOL.|`|2N6oTOLQaa	The best way to identify ways to save money is to live on a written budget and track your spending. Most people don't realize how much money they blow each month by eating out, buying coffee etc.<br>  <br>  My wife and I create a written budget before each month begins and we stick to it. We identify every dollar that's coming in and where its all going. We don't use credit cards at all. We pay cash for everything we can, and we use checks or a debit card for things where cash isn't practical like mailing the mortgage payment or utility bills. Its hard to get started on this kind of system but trust me its worth it when you have the peace of mind of knowing where your money is going. Plus, you never feel guilty about a purchase if you stay within the amount you budgeted for that purpose. <br>  <br>  Once you start living on a written budget, then you can look for ways to trim the budget, and you can allocate the money you save toward other areas like savings or paying off debts. Here's a few ideas:<br>  <br>  Shop rates on all your insurance products. Make sure you still have the right amount of coverage for your cars but that your rate is competitive. <br>  <br>  Do the same for homeowners insurance.<br>  <br>  If you have life insurance, make sure you have term life insurance. If you have whole life you are paying too much. You'd be better off to get cheaper term insurance and invest or save the difference in the monthly premiums. <br>  <br>  Reevaluate all your optional utility bills to make sure you are getting the best deal and not paying for things you don't use. Just last night I called my phone company. I saved $20 per month on my bill by removing features I wasn't using and downgrading to basic DSL internet insead of the higher speed.<br>  <br>  Consider cancelling or downgrading your cable/TV service.<br>  <br>  Drive used cars that are paid for instead of making car payments or lease payments. If you look at the amount of interest and depreciation you pay for a new car, you can save thousands per year by purchasing reasonable used cars and simply paying for the maintenance. The average new car looses 70% of its value in the first 4 years, which is roughly $100 per week. You can pay for a ton of repairs on a used car before you break even with those kinds of numbers.|`|AHRLXm1maa	I just wanted to say that I am in your exact same boat. I have a fabulous job and I make great money--more money than my fiance. He still makes a decent living, but I don't know if we'll really be able to do it.

Just wanted to say that I feel your pain.|`|UGBL3wREaa	Take in one or two children to babysit during the day. Cloth diapers. Coupons. Smaller cable package. Prepaid cellphones. Keep as many electric things off as possible. Conserve water.

uTdEdpAeaa	are you ready to have a child??? sounds like your not because you seem a bit worried here... well my advice to you is not to be dumb next time and have protected sex or be on some kind of birth control. i don't know if your aware of this but having a man *** inside you will cause pregnancy sometimes so good luck and hope that  your smarter then that next time around...|`|AA12192310	YES   DAAA|`|fslABgDnaa	How old are you? And why are you having unprotected sex?
AA10986942	A good thing to do for a light sleeper is to run a small fan in their room when they are sleeping.. it is a constant sound and will drown out any sudden noises like a phone ringing that will wake them up.. Also it was discovered not long ago that a fan in a babies room could cut down on crib death because it kept the air circulating...<br>  As for the rocking her to sleep...<br>  You all need to sit down in the evening in a nice quiet room and take 1 hour to read your babies a book, sing to them and rock them to sleep... what is wrong with that?  What could be more relaxing for you as the mother?  I could not imagine just dropping my baby into the crib at bed time and walking away.  Trust me these  few years you have to do this are going to go by fast and this will create so many fond memories for you.   I rocked my sons every night until they were 4.  first it was bath time, then they curled up in my lap for 2 books then they had to lay their head down and close their eyes to be rocked.... I enjoyed every minute.  It was a time for me to just sit and relax with my babies....  so dont make them grow up so fast... rock them and enjoy it.<br>  Sorry you are not getting much sleep but this will pass, hang in there.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	Can she come to your bed at 3 am then? That is a quick way to get everyone back to sleep. Sounds like she just wants to be near you when she wakes up.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Teething?|`|4hSUePTqaa	Well i feel your pain. I am having the same problem with my 9 month old son. He was doing so well sleeping on his own and then came the teething. Once he started teething he would wake up so many times in the night. So i started putting him in bed with me just so me and his daddy could get some much needed rest. Well by doing that i have created a baby that hates being away from me. Not to mention mommy and daddy no longer have any time for the 2 of us if u know what i mean. I honestly dont know what to do myself he will sleep in his crib until about 12am of so and that is it. Sorry i couldnt be of help just wanted u 2 know that u are so not alone.|`|X6as2nOAaa	I was having a similar issue my baby used to sleep good then all the sudden she woke through the night and didn't want in her crib and it was a nightmare. I found what worked for her which I don't know if it will work for you, anyways, I put a little 13 inch tv and a vcr/dvd combo and went and bought some cartoon movies and I play them at night. I also put her to bed at night after she has her bottle and then about 10 when I go to bed I fill her bottle up again and set in next to her that way if she does wake up she will just grab her bottle herself and not wake me and she really likes the movie playing at night. I hope this helps you, btw in case you are wondering how old my baby is, she is 7 months old.|`|hVVALFAPaa	Is she learning to walk/stand/crawl?<br>  <br>  Many times when a baby is about to learn a new skill (like walking/standing/crawling) they want to practice the new skill all the time. Even in their sleep or in the middle of the night. It is very stressful to learn a new skill and when they are stressed, they don't sleep well -- just like adults. When you are stressed, you probably don't sleep well either. She may even try to practice the new skill in her sleep.<br>  <br>  Give her a few days to master the new thing. In the meantime, don't start up a new sleeping habit that you may not be able to break later. She can cry for a bit, but don't let her go so long that she gets hysterical. Go in and try to calm her, then leave and go back, etc.<br>  <br>  Be patient and hopefully, this won't last more than a few more days!|`|EaDkj1JJaa	I would say you definitely need to break the rocking her to sleep habit. I had the same problem with my son. I would try the crying approach again...make she's tired but not asleep when you put her to bed. I suggest playing with her for a little while and keeping her active right up until bedtime and then try something like reading a story before putting her down for the night. Let her cry a little and then go into her and let her know you are right there-don't wait until she is hysterical to go into her. I would talk to her in a soothing voice but don't rock her to sleep, just let her lay in the crib and see that you are right there and then leave her again. She's used to the constant rocking motion which is why she can't fall asleep and then stay asleep without being rocked. But I would definitely recommend that you try the crying approach with her again. It'll be rough the first couple of nights...maybe even the first week. I had to go into my son every 5 minutes for over an hour at first but it slowly got better and before I knew it he was falling asleep without crying.<br>  I also don't know how you feel about pacifiers but they seem to help. <br>  I wish you the very best...this is a rough stage but it will be over before  you know it. It won't be like this for long...
YZ7HOZ3raa	Well, being pregnant is a possibility, but I would not jump to that conclusion just yet. When woman first begin taking the pill, their periods can be abnormal, also, stress can delay your period or make you not have one at all. So i would not panic, just take another pregnancy test (following the directions very carefully); if it is positive, talk with your parents and make an appointment with your gynecologist.|`|G4wDlSh7aa	see a doctor.<br>  :)|`|AA12041870	I think you should go see a doctor.|`|yTYLayLtaa	i just want to start off by saying that im in medical school<br>  you may be pregnant pregnancy effects different people different ways also just being on the birth control pill can make you be late or miss your period all together. the only way to truly tell is to see a doctor|`|Drze0cUXaa	I would say try to test again in about 2-3 days. If it is positive then go to the doctor asap. I was pregnant at 17 & really it isn't what people make it out to be,I am a great mother regardless my age or not. I LOVE being a mommy.|`|115BfzMFaa	i doubt it. it takes 2 weeks for the pill to work, and i usually get my period the 4th day of my week of on the pill. just wait a few more week and then take a test|`|a7682b3b2075d3bb118519018f038c70aa	It's definitely possible - missing your period by 2 days isn't necessarily a guaranteed sign, though. Miss it by 2 weeks, and you've probably got your answer.|`|af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	You might want to wait till around monday or saturday which ever and if no period test again. Or go to the doc and ask whats going on if you are using one of those birth control pills that give u shorter lighter and LESS periods than that could be it also but you really should ask a doctor if this is normal . good luck hun and best of luck|`|bQ0PpuSyaa	probably not it only take a month for the birth control to kick in if you use it right.  your period might be different though because of the pills.|`|zzfCPTiQaa	I think try the pregnancy test again in about a week.<br>  It takes like 3-4 weeks to get accurate results.|`|K8NWUKiFaa	Pregnacy test!|`|um8IIEn8aa	YES! YOUR GUNNA BE SHOVING A LITTLE SCREAMING ***** OUT YOUR VAGINA IN NINE MONTHS! I HOPE YOU ENJOY!|`|rOfFOcwpaa	I think you need to take another pregnancy test if you want to be sure.|`|IetukCEiaa	eat the baby and drink its juices|`|2ElUElbjaa	I'd take another test, so you're not freaking out for nothing... But this might be a wake up call... If you're not ready to have a child, you shouldn't be having sex. I got pregnant unexpectedly when I was 19, I never thought it would happen, but you never do until it happens to you... (my son is 16 months old, I'm now very happily married and expecting baby #2, but this doesnt happen for everyone)... Take care of yourself until you know for sure, no smoking, drugs or alcohol. Good Luck!!|`|XcSS6BrZaa	i know what you are going thru girl, i went thru that exact thing, what i would do is get a home pregnancy test and then i would set up a doc appointment and get a doc opinion and the side affects could be increase in appetite boobs are sore morning or night sickness cramping tired easy not very much energy.|`|zb2xY6mxaa	There is a very big Sign of possibility that you are pregnant. You have a god boyfriend by your side. The only thing you will half to worry are about your parents. But befor you tel them you should go to the hospital to be sure :)))|`|b7PRtoyxaa	just stay calm and wait a few more days :)|`|48yMQt8Oaa	Well first you didn't say what type of birth control you are on. Second the pregnancy tests they have now are early-detection tests capable of determining pregnancy as early as 8-10 days dpo. Why not just take another test?<br>  <br>  For future reference if you have unprotected sex you can get the morning after pill at many pharmacies now. It is not an abortion it just makes you have your period to make sure an egg doesn't implant in your uterus. <br>  <br>  The morning-after pill stops you from becoming pregnant if contraception failed or wasn't used.<br>  <br>  Although lots of people talk about the 'morning-after pill', this term is actually misleading. In reality, the pill works for up to 72 hours (three days) after sex.<br>  <br>  The 'morning-after pill' is now widely used by women who have had unprotected sex. In particular, it has proved of value to:<br>  <br>      * rape victims, who should insist they are given it <br>  <br>      * couples who have a condom break during sex<br>  <br>      * women who have been lured into having sex while under the influence of drink or drugs. <br>  <br>  Its great that your boyfriend is supporting you but 17 is really young to carry a child. You are still growing into an adult so it will be hard on your body. A developing baby will take calcium and other nutrients from your body that you still need. I hope you can wait a few years but if not a lot of women have had a baby too young and did just fine. I hope your parents are supportive as well and I wish you all the best. :-)
tQPvv0Glaa	You'll have to wait for the shot to wear off (and obviously not get anymore).

a1a2b1500577effd8b2c0b6e4aa1dcddaa	Your local hospital  may have an exercise class available. Those are fun or your local rec center. You can still do most things till your last trimester.  The pool is your best option.  Swimming laps and  water aerobic take stain off you body.   Your Dr. Doesn't want you to be bouncing all around.  DO stationary exercises.  But keep in mind that early delivery is always a possibility so stay honest with your doctor and keep regular appts.|`|2NdSyZMBaa	when my friend got pregnant her doctor said the same thing. walking helps with the pregnancy later on. when you go into labor the doctor may ask you to walk. they do this to help move the baby in the right position.<br>  <br>  but if you want to work out and not be limited to walking you can try yoga. it will give you a work out without over doing it.<br>  <br>  ask your OB if they own of any pregnancy yoga classes to go to.|`|wWkfASTNaa	Listen to your OB, they know what they are talking about.

rj5evFTZaa	Hi.  I had a very similar problem to yours and I decided to change her eating times and it has worked!<br>  <br>  I decided I was fed up with listening to other people going on about how amazing their child was sleeping through and that they left the poor thing to cry itself to sleep.  I didn't want that for my little one.  If she is tired, she is tired and she can train herself to go to sleep over a period of time by getting used to a routine.  You can't make a baby sleep regardless of what anyone says and lets face it, they are all so different!  I decided to make all my own baby food as didn't want her having additives from the baby jars...have you tried that?  It might help to make your own and freeze it for each day....I start by a bottle of follow on milk at 0600, breakfast of weetabix or porridge with home made fruit preserve at 9am,maybe with a finger of toast and marmalade/marmite and something to drink, lunch (home made shepards pie or chicken casserole with loads of different veges) at 1300 then dinner at 1730.  I don't give her a pudding at diner as I found this kept her up and by the time 1830 - 1900 came she was rubbing her eyes and getting ratty and wanting to sleep.  I read her a few books to calm her and get her ready for bed time mode..(I dont bath her as this revs her up and may give her indigestion after food and make it uncomfortable to sleep).  I take her drink up with me for after I've read her books and wind her well and a bottle of milk ready for her 0600 wake up when I go to bed.  She now sleeps through and its only been since I made the above changes 2 weeks ago and my black eyes are slowly diminishing!!  Sorry if this sounds regimented to you but it worked for me and I so feel for you and your little one. I play with Ruby so much during the day to tire her out.  She just started crawling so I let her explore and interact with as much as she can to tire her little brain out.  When she is poorly she sleeps with me which I don't mind..we all need our mums when we are poorly.  I decided not to hook into what other babies were doing and relax.  I know you feel tired..so did I, but be guided by your baby also.  She might give you signals she is tired such as rubbing her eyes, ear or hair.. Give it a go and let me know how you get on.  Hope it helps. Anna.x ps just read this back and I sound like a patronising sod...sorry!!  not meant to...just wish I'd have had someone quite honest and open to advise me when I was struggling with the sleep thing....x|`|0iIDAHldaa	Have you tried putting a little bit of rice cereal in her milk? That can help fill her up & might help her stay satisfied. You may need to up her formula/breast milk...she may be ready for more. Also...is she cutting teeth? You might want to check because you may not realize it...if she is, give her some infant motrin or infant tylenol. Your doctor may have to tell you how much to give her...but it will ease her pain & help her sleep.|`|gm5IE97uaa	well besides the bottle, what do you give her to eat?  For instance, I give my son (who is 11 months but he has been in this routine since he was 9 months) a breakfast of oatmeal with pears mixed (it's jar food by gerber) and then about twenty minutes later he has a bottle (6 oz).  He goes down for a nap around 10.  Then around eleven, he will have another 6 oz. bottle.  Around eleven thirty or 12 he will have lunch which is jar baby food of whatever it is (vegetables and beef, chicken with rice, whatever).  Then he goes down for a nap around 1.  Then when he wakes up, I let him play for a bit and around 3 he gets apple sauce as a snack or maybe 4 oz of juice.  Then around 6 he gets a 6 oz bottle and his dinner which is baby food just like lunch.  play play play until time for bath around 8.  After the bath he gets a 6 oz bottle with a little oatmeal mixed in.  By 9, he's down for the count and so full that he doesn't wake up unless it's for me to put his loocher in his mouth.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Wow, that sounds rough.  I think you need to get her on a schedule of more frequent day time naps and an earlier bedtime.  It she's over-tired when she goes to sleep, she is going to be too amped up to sleep well for long.<br>  <br>  Try reading "Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child".|`|90eDaQpBaa	try cough syrup...it wont kill her...i did this with my first kid once just for abreak...it worked and he got a good sleep, doc said it was fine btw.
