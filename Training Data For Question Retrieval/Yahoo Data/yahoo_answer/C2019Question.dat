20090128122039AAx4X3O	Consumer Electronics;Camcorders	How to get rid of the fuzz?	Hi,  I have an AIPTEK ISDV2.4 camcorder, and I have a question about recording things from a television. When I record it, there is black fuzz stuff in the middle of the screen, and occasionally black bars that go up the screen. Is there any way, or program, or anything to get rid of the fuzz? I know about the Dazzle DVD Recorder, but I do not have enough money for that yet. Any help would be great.  Thanks!

20090225125516AA1yAqp	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;PlayStation	PS3 Wont load ANY discs!?	I bought my PS3 about a year and two months (which is no longer under the limited warranty), I had just downloaded PS Home and finished playing Rainbow Six. I turn off my console. The next day I play Rainbow Six, then the console freezes as it was loading. No buttons worked so I had to turn off the console the old fashioned way. Needless to say, since then the console does not load any discs, games or movies, nothing. It starts normal.       My question is this, has anybody had this problem? How do I fix it. Does anyone know of any forums that would help ME fix it? Even if I have to open up the console (wouldn't matter since it is not under warranty).
20090128141530AA1gwtJ	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Buying an iPhone from AT&T?	I was wondering if it where possible for someone else to buy the iPhone, and give it to me to activate as my own. My sister was going to buy the iPhone and give it to me to use. I would purchase the data plan of course to place on it, but was wondering if she would be able to remove her own data plan after purchasing it so she could use her blackberry data plan? Basically, would she be able to replace the iPhone data plan with a Blackberry data plan after giving it to me? She would still be under contract though. We share a plan. We both have Blackberry's, but I want an iphone now. The thing is, I'm not eligible for an upgrade yet and she is. She would only be I guess transferring it to me? I would still pay for the data plan and such, but It would be for my number, not hers.

20090128130353AA2zoJ0	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;PlayStation	How old were you when you started playing video games?	...and how long was it before you really were at a 'good' playing level?      My son is 4.5 (almost 5) and I started him on video games about 6 months ago on a SNES.  Now he already has a Playstation 2 and about 10 games and is crazy talented...I am good at the games and playing with him is challenging...not like it would be with a 4.5 year old (at least I think).  He memorizes the buttons and tells me things when we're not even playing...like, "mom you have to push triangle three times then square and up then left...", etc....things like that.  It's kinda hard to explain but seems abnormal the way he is able to memorize the game play and the controller moves at such a young age.      So anyhow, just curious if this is pretty normal or if he has some kind of weird talent. LOL.  Thanks!

I probably will just keep my phone for the full 24 months, but just incase I did want to change is why I am asking. Thank you very much.

20090128142452AACZKnQ	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Nintendo Wii	Wii turns off, unless playing with a gamecube game?	My Wii will shut off after a while unless I'm playing a gamecube game. It feels very warm, but that doesn't do anything to the gamecube game. So when I play a wii game of wiiware or any of the channels, it will turn itself off. The LED light also goes out. I recently, got a new AC adapter to try and fix this, and that's when the gamecube games started working fine. This also happened to start right after I first played Harvest Moon: Tree of Tranquility, which I know has a couple of bugs in it. Could that have caused it? Help is appreciated. :]

Also what kind of memory stick do I need for my PSP?  does it have to say pro stick duo on the package?  or can any memory stick that works on any digital camera work on my PSP?    ow god please help me    My worthless 3rd world country named Trinidad in the Caribbean run by black people doesn't sell PSP usb cable. Mainly because because majority of the population is African people who by the way has no use for a PSP they rather take that money and buy guns and bling and rap crap.    And they Africans off course hate us Hindu Indians because we admire the white man and and America and stuff and mainly cause Indians have straight hair etc.    please help!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I transferred my songs with an external HD. My goal was to be able to keep the actual Itunes program and my library on my external HD. I was never able to do this, and what I ended up with was me only able to play certain songs, while others were "not found" In an attempt to get a clean slate, I deleted my itunes program and the files stored on my computer. Now I have an external HD with all of my files, and an ipod with all of my files, but I am unable to sync it up without deleting what is in my ipod. Could someone please give some detailed (as simple as possible) instructions for getting what is on my external HD back into Itunes, and also, how to then save both my files and the itunes program onto my external HD.

20090225074328AA6nCCp	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Blocked a number from calling, through verizon wireless?	What kind of message or response, if any, does someone receive who's had their cellphone number blocked from contacting another customer?      I'd like to know what kind of notification she's getting. I hope it's not "this number is disconnected" but something that says "this person does not want you calling them" or something along those lines.      I've tried to tell her not to call so many times, but a week later she calls and acts like nothing happened.       Long, terribly painful relationship she won't let go. I'm just trying to move on but she makes it way too hard by calling and trying to pull it back together. I've given her way too many second chances, she just keeps making the same mistakes.

Do any MP3 players record like a Digital Voice Recorder? I don't want to pay $40-50 for a Voice Recorder if I could have an MP3 Player that would do the same thing.
20090225075451AA6HI8t	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Xbox	Help! Xbox 360 Controllers Keep Disconnecting.?	Ok. I had an xbox 360, elite and it got the 3 rings over 2 months ago. I sent it in to microsoft and it took them over 2 months to replace it. After i finally got back yesterday i recieved a brand new system however now this new one seems to not connect to my controllers like my old one. With the old one i could literally walk out of the room from where the xbox is and it would still be connected. Now with this one, when i slightly turn the wireless controllers away from the xbox it disconnects or if its not directly pointing at the system in any way. Can anyone help me with this. And don't say batteries cuz i changed the batteries and i have 2 wireless controllers and they both have the same problem!

Ok , so when i put a disc., (NHL 09) or any game (there not dirty), all it does is show that its a dvd and then bring me to a page with "To play this disc, put it in an Xbox 360 console."  Is it bc my lense is dirty. WTF HELLLLLLP
