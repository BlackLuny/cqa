20071230220812AA4XGeQ	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Chicas, ayudenme a entender?	sencillamente le regale un ramo de rosas a una chica (cabe mencionar) tremendamente hermosa y deseada. Pero algo desconfiada de los chicos y demas etceteras.   El tema es que ella, a pesar de no conocerme con anterioridad se mostro muy impresionada por mi gesto y me lo agradecio personalmente.   Yo pude notar como estaba muy alegre por eso,    (tambien le hize llegar un retrato de ella hecho por mi)   creo que todo en conjunto la mató (no literalmente jeje, ustedes me entienden)   el tema es que luego de aquella noche ella no parecia mostrarse muy interesada ya en mi, lo cual es comprensible; una persona no se enamora por el simple hecho de recibir rosas y un retrato.   Poco a poco empeze a pensar que si ella no me buscaba despues de aquello fue porque no le gusté como futuro candidato, pero aun asi le sigo mandando mensajes de texto (esporadicamente) a los cuales ella siempre me contesta... ustedes que piensan? lo hace por no herirme o porque puede haber una minima chance?      gracias, feliz a?o

El tiempo, entre los dos, cruzaba en vano,   pintábamos el mundo de colores,   pasó la primavera, y el verano,   y seguíamos hablándonos de amores.   Luego llegó el oto?o con sus brumas,   y una nube empa?ó nuestros destinos,   y sin saberlo, un día te alejaste,   y te perdiste por otros caminos.   Pero donde hubo fuego, siempre hay brasas,    y como la esperanza siempre espera,   sigo esperando, cada a?o que pasa,   que vuelvas a mi lado en primavera.

20080828023933AAuwomE	Arts & Humanities;History	?Dudas sobre que Israel pertenece al lugar en donde està legalmente asentado?	No sé si está al tanto que se ha descubierto recientemente en Egipto la cripta que preparó en vida el profeta (la tumba tebana 353) y que nunca llegó a ocupar pues debió exiliarse alrededor de sus 40 a?os.  Esa cripta secreta, sin terminar y sin uso, la ocultó con tanta habilidad que recién en 1927 el arqueólogo Herbert Winlock la excavó intacta luego de 3400 a?os.  El sorprendente descubrimiento ha puesto punto final a siglos de especulaciones históricas.  La egiptología oficial, acorralada ante las evidencias, se niega, como es su costumbre, a debatir abiertamente cualquier hallazgo arqueológico que confirme la historia bíblica. La cantidad de pruebas arqueológicas es tan abundante y certera que el consejo supremo de antigüedades de la República árabe de Egipto se aboca actualmente a una obsesiva campa?a de recuperación de los textos y estatuas que están en museos occidentales (hay veinticuatro estatuas del profeta y   numerosos autorretratos en los Museos Metropolitano de Nueva York, de Fort Worth, el Louvre, de Berlin, de Brooklyn, de Munich, Museo Británico, etc.) porque no les conviene que se sepa la verdad histórica.        ?Cuál es la verdad histórica entonces?  Israel y su descendencia vivieron en Egipto, en su seno nació el futuro libertador hacia el a?o 1520 a.e.c., que la Torá, Pentateuco o Libro de Moisés se escribió en esa antigua época, y que existió un éxodo documentado por muchas fuentes arqueológicas egipcias (tumba de Amenofis II, templo funerario de Hatshepsut, dos criptas privadas, el papiro Ipuwer, la correspondencia de Tell el Amarna, los abundantes textos de Senmut, de Manethon, etc.).  Lo que sobra son las pruebas.     El grave revés, el gran fiasco para los mencionados historiadores y egiptólogos minimalistas y negadores bíblicos es que el "mito" de la Biblia no es un mito ni una leyenda, que el relato central es verdadero, que la arqueología dispone actualmente para probarlo de antiguos y superabundantes textos y monumentos que respaldan sobradamente los derechos milenarios del pueblo de Israel y de su descendencia a la tierra prometida, derechos otorgados expresamente a través del reclamo por escrito -el Pentateuco- sobre la tierra de Canaán extendido por un alto dignatario político de Egipto, la potencia dominante, luego de recibir del faraón la orden de abandonar el país y conseguir que delegara en sus manos los destinos del pueblo hebreo, su carta política de independencia del imperio.           Porque ahora la arqueología y la historia pueden probar fehacientemente que el primer elegido, el originario, es el pueblo de Israel, que la tierra de Canaán –que incluía Israel, Gaza, parte del Líbano, de Siria y de Jordania- fue reclamada mediante documento escrito -el libro de Moisés o Pentateuco- para Israel mas de veinte siglos antes de producirse la conquista árabe islámica.  Que con respecto a su profeta y caudillo político, criado y educado en Egipto durante cuarenta a?os no debe extra?ar que su cultura y creencias fueran egipcias, pero luego a lo largo de sus restantes cuarenta a?os en íntimo contacto con los pueblos abramitas, cananeos y semitas seminómadas diera la espalda a sus primeros credos y elaborara una síntesis superadora, el inspirado monoteísmo moral destinado a ser copiado y trasmitido de generación en generación y cuyo texto dio posterior origen y basamento al judaísmo, cristianismo e islamismo.    Se adjuntan algunos de los documentos arqueológicos descubiertos que deberían difundirse traducidos al inglés y hebreo para ir desenmascarando las teorías falsas y mentirosas de Finkelstein y asociados

If you know what the song is or who it was by that would be helpful also.  I can't remember any of the lyrics, but i think it had something to do with a man and woman in a car driving.

20090226120256AAWjArl	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Artistic and depressed?	Why is it that the best fuel for writing is being depressed? At least it is for me... It's like being that way causes me to become more in touch with my emotions and the instant I begin writing I write with feeling and the words flow so much easier than when I'm happy. And I'm not writing  suicide poems lol, I mean when you're trying to write anything. It just makes me lyrical, I could never write songs or poem-like peices until I just didn't hold back and let whatever I was thinking live on the paper (I usually write stories) So I was just wondering... does this happen to you too? And what about when you're writing and then you start to feel better or less depressed does your writing reflect that? In the begining it's good and then it just levels off sort of. WHAT UP?!

20090226111023AA0CO5W	Arts & Humanities;Performing Arts	How do you find a benefactor?	Ok.  I don't know if I'm posting this in the right category, or not.  And many of you will probably think I'm crazy.  But here's my situation....      I have an 8th grade daughter who is absolutely amazing at the french horn.  I really don't think I'm just a biased mom on this.  I'm a professional accompanist.  Therefore, I play piano for LOTS of kids going to solo contests, etc.  I play for both middle school and high school.  I've played for Juniors and Seniors who, although they earn division 1 ratings and are praised for being very good, are not as good and do not learn as fast as she does as an 8th grader.        As a pianist and piano teacher, I think music lessons are very important for my children.  I will give up a plate of food if I have to in order to pay for her horn lessons, at this point.  However..... my husband and I are both self-employed and the economy is not treating us very nicely.  We're running out of "plates of food" to give up.  We can no longer afford things like youth orchestra and band camp.  Even the private lessons (which have to be bumped up to a "professional" level this summer) have become a huge strain on us.      I know from my music history studies that many of the famous composers had benefactors who paid their way through their musical training, and even supported them as they worked as professional musicians.  And I know there are people out there who donate huge sums of money to support music programs/schools.        Does anyone know how you would go about finding someone who would be able/willing to financially support a gifted student through their musical training?

20090226115507AAtkCxK	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I've written a story opening, I need to know how to develop it?	As I shut my eyes, the world began to spin. Faster and faster, out of control. Too fast. The carpet was warm, but it felt brittle under my dancing fingers.     “Ellie? Ellie!”   Disorientated, I began to wrench my eyelids apart.    “****….should we pick her up? God sake….”   There we go. They were open. Finally. As a face came swimming into focus, I began to wish I’d kept my eyes shut. Jack did not look thrilled. Neither did Anna. In fact, they both looked pretty pissed off.    “Oh great, so she’s alive? I suppose we’ll have to look after her and make sure she’s still that way in the morning. I wish she would give the drinking up, y’know?”   With Anna nodding sagely by his side, I dimly recalled the conversation I’d had with the pair of them that morning.    “I promise I’ll be careful. I don’t want to ruin your night again. You deserve to have fun too. I promise.”   Guilt began to set in as my heart sunk. One motion. Ankles of passing people avoided my prostrate body like I had the plague.     “Better get up, darling. I mean…. Oh.”   Bless Anna. She tried. Every time. But she was completely hopeless. With a sigh, Jack bent down towards me and the world went black.      A loud creak woke me up, followed by a shout from a strange voice. A tap on the door, and Jack was in the room.    “Ellie? You awake?”   I didn’t trust my voice to speak. A grunt was all I felt I could handle.    “Ellie. You can’t do this. We won’t do this, me and Anna. Not anymore.”   He looked so upset with me I wanted to cry. As he turned on his heel and left the room, I let one long breath out of my mouth. A timid tap on the door followed, announcing Anna’s arrival.     “Ellie darling…..” She trailed off.   If Jack’s face had upset me, Anna’s ripped me to pieces. Her large eyes were warped in a combination of pity and disappointment. Her mouth moved, mute. She seemed to have run out of words. With a gentle sniff and a pat on the shoulder, she left. The hole she left in my chest burned. This was the end.        “Can I burn some things on your fire?”   He looked momentarily shocked. Then he stuck his arm out over the fence.    “Sure thing. I’m Will.”    “Thanks. Ellie.”    “Bring it round, the gate’s open.”   The fire was burning bright next door. He seemed to be burning garden waste. Leaves and twigs, as far as I could see.     “So what’s this stuff you need to burn then?”   I handed him the box. Gingerly he opened it, as though it was alive. His eyebrows shot through his fringe at the contents.     “Ok. Number one.”    The drugs went on first. My hidden stash. Month’s worth of leftovers from ruined nights and broken parties. The plastic bag melted, and colours began to dance in the flames before my eyes.    “Next.”   My party dress. Will stretched it out, took note of its length. Raising his eyebrows at me yet again, he chucked it on the fire. Gone.    “Last of all…” I announced.   Will turned, and saw the bottle of vodka. Before I had a chance to throw it, he yanked it from my hands.     “Are you mad? You can’t put that on there! You’ll blow us up!”   I settled for smashing the bottle on the floor and watching the liquid seep into the yellow grass.    “So… Do I get an explanation?”   Will turned to look at me, wide-eyed and puzzled.

I always asked the question: "Why bother to get married?" if you love someone buy them a ring, declare your love for them and just live on with them. Why waste so much money on marriages when you can save it for helping your relationship or future children.       I understand that religion comes into things, but why when I mention my own belief of marriage to my peers at school am I met with narrowed eyes and discontent glaces? I'm in year 11 you know, so that's that is the reason I would ask this question, heck people get married at 16, God knows why! I would rather enjoy my life!      Anyway, I'll stop boring you now, is it a bad thing about my view of marriage? After all, I always argue and say, "If you don't get married you can't get divorced and get your money taken." Imagine the waste of money spent on the marriage :O.       Also, will my view of marriage affect my relationships with women? I'm not a person that believe love don't exist, just that you can love without marriage, its just a signed piece of paper after all!!      Thanks I want to clear this up!

20090225105919AAJ3CAd	Arts & Humanities;Dancing	Please help! I've been thinking about quitting jazz and today is my last day to decide!?	I'm 15 years old and this is my 4th year of jazz. I've enjoyed it, however, not as much as other years, and I've found myself skipping so much that I've been going about every other week or less, and this has been going on for probably 2 months. I never look forward to it and usually when I'm there, I don't like it so much. But if I quit, I don't want my teacher to feel bad, and I also have a friend in that class and I don't know what she would think. I've been thinking about trying ballroom and I've wanted to since 7th or 8th grade (I'm in 10th now). My mom started looking for places and she's considered it. She found a place that doesn't have junior classes yet, but they might this summer, But if they don't, then I probably won't go there cuz private lessons are  $40 an hour.       My jazz class is every Thursday from 8-9 pm, so I have it tomorrow. I'm pretty sure I've only been there once this month. If I did quit, what would I tell them?? I don't want to seem like a quitter or someone who just gives up. What should I do?

Some say she thinks   too much, but I    think she thinks just enough   about everything.   No leaping, careful   planned jumping - parachuted.      But when she dreams -   she dreams too much   takes her to places    off the cusp of reality   places she'll never    see, know, recognize   in the starkness of daylight.

20090225110957AAYkhLm	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What book character do you remind yourself of?	I remind myself of Melinda Sordino (Speak). We think alike. We're also smart (by smart, I mean smart a$$). She's also a loner....like me. She barely talks....like me. She cuts class....like me. And, she doesn't exactly know who she is....like me (and when I say she doesn't know who she is, I mean she can't find her identity).      I guess the one thing we don't have in common would be that she has been raped. I, on the other hand, have not been raped.       I would like to say I'm like Bella Swan (now Bella Cullen) but, I'm just not. It would be cool if I were her, though. She's special, and I'm, well....not.       Anyway, what character do you remind yourself of?

20090225111748AAeAslx	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!…	I know it's a wall of text but I worked really hard on it.   I sound pitiful.   Will you read this and tell me what you think?         "I"m not going!" I shouted at my mother. Our conversation started somewhere at "Joe, I'd like you to see this," and ended in between; "I'll never go," and a series of slammed doors.   My mother wanted me to do the unthinkable! It was shocking, slightly crazy. She wanted me to lie, falsely pose as a poor man. But the real thriller was the fact that she wanted me to go on an extended journey to explore the west!   This is where I started to doubt her intellect. She actually expected me, of all people, to leave my warm bed to travel on a stinky, smelly journey with crazy animals I've never seen or heard of before! And, for no purpose. She wanted me to "learn a lesson" A lesson in WHAT?! How miserable my life would be? I already knew that! But, because she was my mother, I wanted to please her. I scuffed up my boots, ran my clothes through the mud, tore them a little, tasseled my hair, and stepped forth into what I knew would be the worst time of my life.   Only four months in to this wasteful journey, Sargeant Floyd passed away. I didn't know what everyone was fussing about. He was just some poor man that I could use as a step ladder at best! Well, I pretended to feel a little bit of sadness, because everyone was all bent out of shape about it.   Three months passed, they were just as miserable as the first. No warm bed, or fresh food. We met our interpreters, there were many, but one stood out to me: Sacagawea. She looked young, yet she had a child forming inside of her. It started to make me wonder...   We reached the end of our journey. What we thought was the end though, was really a new beginning. We were about to leave Fort Mandan for St. Louis. I hate to admit it, but I was actually starting to like the place, and all the individuals there. A small, very small, part of me would miss this.   "Isn't she beautiful?" John Sheilds asked me.   "Beautiful?! That's an extreme understatement." Nothing in this undeveloped world could describe the waterfall in front of me. It poured out waves of mercy and grace. I knew this was the reason mother wanted me to come. Maybe she didn't know exactly what I'd find. But she knew the lesson I'd learn. The lesson of finding myself. Right here, I found myself at Great Falls. The rush of joyful tears sliding down my face matched the waterfall in front of me. The purpose of my entire journey lay here.   With a new sense of self, we continued on our way back to St. Louis. The pregnant woman had given birth a while earlier and when she met up with her brother, whom she'd been separated from, I was overjoyed. It had been almost two years in to our journey and it was Lewis' birthday. We decided to throw him a party. A small one, though. Sacagawea and her brother, Shoshone, taught us a native dance that was a thrill to learn.   It was September 23 when we finally arrived at St. Louis, the Corp of Discovery had been on this journey for almost three years! I was excited to get back home, but I would miss everyone. I just had one problem. They saw me as a poor man, but in reality, I was a high class man. I needed to tell them. But, they would never respect me again if they discovered I lied. I had some thinking to do...   "John, I need to say something. Please, let me finish before you make any judgments. I haven't been completely honest with everyone," I started to say to my dear friend. He would be the only one I told.   "I'm listening" the look in his eyes worried me.   "I'm not the poor man you think I am. I don't know how I thought I could keep it a secret from you, or anyone for that matter. And I-" He cut me off.   "Joseph, I know."   "But, how?"   "You were so cold to everyone. No man came on this journey unwillingly, except you. I've been determined to show you that there is more to life than what you thought since the beginning. I'm surprised you survived this trip at all. I honor you for being truthful. Please leave now."   I was shocked. How did he know? Three years and he had said nothing. I walked to my house, I had so much to think about. I reached my door, my mother was there to greet me.   "Hi darling, how was your trip? I'll bet you're hungry! I made your favorite. Come, sit, tell me about your journey." she flooded me with questions.   "Well ma', I'm actually really tired. Do you think we could talk about this tomorrow?"   "I suppose," she started with her pitiful voice.   I trudged to my sleeping area and lay down on my fluffed bed. Everything was as I left it. I closed my eyes and smiled to myself. I made it, and that was all that mattered.

The Good Bits:   the sexual tension at the beginning    though I hated it...Meyer had incomprehensible way of making you feel Bella's pain.   the 'almost' Jacob romance..   Edward confessing at the end..

The Volterra bit....talk about anti-climactic!...the climax was what?...a friendly conversation...   Edward's return...I was expecting a more breathtaking return than Bella just finding him in an alleyway..   Not enough romance at the end I guess...didn't make up for him leaving..

20090226124110AAGdnEg	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What do you think of my story?	I've been writing a story about the "real" version of Sleeping Beauty. Any constructive critism is awesome :) This is just the first page (P.S. I'm only 13)            For many years, a king and queen of a kingdom far, far away hoped for a baby, and one day their wish came true. They gave birth to a baby girl and named her Adriana.   When the queen looked at her daughter for the first time, she squealed.   “What is this?!” she cried. “This is not my daughter. Someone has made a mistake.” The queen passed the baby to the king who sat next to her.    “Dear, what is the matter?” he asked.   The queen was in tears.    “Look at it!”   The king gently pushed aside the blankets that were covering the baby girl's face, and as soon as he did he cried out in anguish, also.   “You heard my queen!” he yelled at everyone in the room. “This is not our baby! Take it away and return with Princess Adriana!”   A nurse stepped toward the king, slowly and cautiously,   “Your majesty,” she said, quietly. “There is no mistake.”   The king handed the baby back to his wife, unable to look at it any longer. She looked at the baby, now sleeping. The queen cringed. How could have she gave birth to this... deformity?   The baby's face was very chubby and she had a large, pig-like nose. Her lips were puckered as if she had just tasted a lemon.   Tears rolled down the queen's face. She turned to the nurse.    “Get the fairies.” As an afterthought she added, “All but Frostbite.”

My sister is in love with that damned fictional character from Twilight. She reckons she is related to the real Carlisle because are last name is Cullen. I think she really needs help, she thinks it's real. She has seen the film about 40 times and reads only those damn books! Her grades are dropping and she is just unresponsive to her friends now! She won't leave the house during the weekend, she sits and reads, she does no work, she barely eats. And we were always really close and recently she has stopped talking, looking or even recognizing me!          My parents think it is just a phase. But this cannot be normal! Please, I would like some opinions, how can I help convince people she needs HELP!?! I am really, really worried.

I'm just about finished with what I hope is the first in a three book fantasy series, and want to get it published. - Now I am aware of how dificult it is to get a novel published, and figure my best bet would be to use one of the self publishing web sites if I can't find an agent or publishing house to work with me. - My question is, what kind of numbers would it take selling from Amazon to attract the attention of one or more of the bigger houses? Legally, could one of them pick it up and "republish" it on a larger scale? - A little friendly help please for someone starting out.

Hi I'm 13 years old and i've been dancing since i was 2 years old i started with modern dancing and when i was about 6 i started hip hop. both at the same dance school then when i was 7 i tried ballet(at a very different dance school) but hated it and i wasn't very good so i quit. now i'm seriously thinking of dancing as my future career like a backing dancer in music videos or in a dance film.and i know that it's almost impossible to get into the competitive world of dance without being amazing at ballet which i am course not.But i don't understand why you should have to have ballet when it has no similarities at all with the style of dance that you do..So is their anyway i can have a career as a dancer without having ballet or any schools that would accept me with no experience in ballet...

20090226122309AAcmSrX	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Is my idea right or wrong?	If one has to be talented to be a pro athlete then how come Glenn Cunnigham was one of the greatest track runners of all time? He was severley injured as a child and he could barely walk. He was athletically handicapped but through great determination he became a famous track runner. Michael Jordan was cut from varsity when he was a sohpomore in high school. If he wasa talented player, he most likely wouldnt have been cut. His great determination made him great. Reggie Meller had leg deformities and he became a pro basketball player but there were tons of people without leg deformities that strived for the nba and didnt make it. Reggie's determination had to be what got him to the nba.         Doesnt that defeat the concept that a person needs to be talented to be a pro athlete?

The smell of coffee wafted around the café, knocking me sick. I exhaled deeply, ramming my eyelids shut. I leaned back on the chair, but it felt unsteady, so I forced myself to lean on the table. I stirred my tea absentmindedly, trying to blank out the background noises that made my head pound. The rain made tapping sounds on the windows, and from what i heard the room was packed.  I rubbed my temples with the tips of my fingers, and then rubbed my eyes. I didn't even know why I came into this café in the first place. The smell of coffee... I couldn't stand it.    The waitress manoeuvred herself around me, as I was sat directly in the centre of the room.  Food was being whizzed around on trays held high above her head. Her hair was piled up on the top of her head, and she wore some kind of checkered red and cream cap that covered up most of it. Her apron was messy, and she looked tired. Glum, miserable, as well. I sighed. I heard the sound of a bell ring, the door, and it sent my head into a frenzy. It was throbbing, and I clamped my eyes shut, wishing i'd stayed at home.          its only like the first paragraph but i'm kinda improvising :D

20090226123257AA6ZhSo	Arts & Humanities;Visual Arts;Drawing & Illustration	How do I resolve a serious problem with my Art Teacher?	Before I begin my little rant about what has happened, I'll start off by giving a few details: I am a high school senior who is currently taking an Advanced Placement Art class for college credit. The instructor teaching the class happens to be my next-door neighbor of eleven years, which I find quite bothersome.       My issue with this teacher is that when I come into her classroom all I want to do is work on my art. I would think that an art teacher would be thrilled with a student who only wanted to work, but alas this is not the case. She constantly interrupts the work of the students with speeches about how important it is to take time outside of class to do work, showing us videos of another artists' work, and the proceeding to tell us that while such an amazing artist spent an entire year working on one simple piece, she wants us to come up with something of the exact same quality in two weeks, sometimes even less than that.       I had an altercation with this teacher this past Monday morning: I became so frustrated and flustered that she wouldn't listen to what I had to say about my artwork (She keeps interrupting me mid-sentence and insisting that I do photography even though I can't afford the film and I'm very much enjoying the inking technique I've recently figured out) that I screamed in her face and swore at her. I realize now that it probably wasn't the best decision to make, but the fact is I have severe anxiety and every time she wants to have a little chit-chat to tell me that my work isn't good enough (though she won't tell me why), my fight-or-flight mechanism kicks in like wildfire.       Since then at first she had refused to let me back into the class until I apologized. Two days later she told my counselor (who told me) that she didn't want a formal apology and that she didn't want me kicked out of the class. Today I walked into class and she called the head principal to escort me to the counseling department.       On top of this my mother hates this teacher, and I get the feeling that she hates my mother in return. Her husband is a local pastor, and I get the feeling that she's a bit angry still that when my father passed away suddenly last year we chose another pastor to perform the sermon at his funeral rather than her husband. Plus I find it interesting that they've recently put up a fence on our side of their property line (her husband claimed it was to keep their dog in so that it could run around freely, yet I find it interesting that they put the fence up on our side and not on any other as of late.)      I don't feel like I should have to apologize because I feel like I was baited to scream at her and that she's been looking for a reason to kick me out of her class all year. At the same time, I can't help but feel anxiety and frustration at the fact that no one but my friends show me any form of support and my mother refuses to air her grievances against my art teacher, which I feel may help immensely.       If anyone can give me sound advice on how to get through this difficult time, I would be most grateful.
