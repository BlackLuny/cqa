A law of 14 August 1935 made its issue department (El Departmento de Emisión) autonomous, and provided for a revaluation of the Bank's metallic reserves by confirming (16 August) the official exchange rate at 12.06 French francs to the peso. The old theoretical peso oro of 1.697 g, .917 fine, was abandoned, and bank notes were denominated in national currency (moneda nacional). The Bank's gold stocks were revalued by a factor of 2.2 (i.e., at 709.53 mg fine gold to the peso). The actual market rate in New York ranged US$0.46-0.57 per peso during 1936.<br>  <br>  By 1941 the peso's official rate was 1.90 to the US dollar. A complicated system of multiple exchange rates was adopted in 1946 and adjusted frequently. The year-end rate in pesos per US dollar on the free market was: 1953, 3.04; 1957, 4.66; 1958, 10.20; 1959, 11.18. Parity was registered with the International Monetary Fund on 7 October 1960 at 7.40 per US$1, but the effective market rate remained around 11 per until 1963, when it began a precipitous decline. Year-end free market rates per US$1 were: 1963, 17.35; 1964, 24.35; 1965; 69.20; 1966, 76.50; 1967, 199.00. This depreciation reflected the declining world market for Uruguay's chief exports: wool, meat and meat products, and hides.<br>  <br>  Banco de la República was replaced by a true central bank, Banco Central del Uruguay, which assumed responsibility for the note issue and began operations on 01 March 1967. Exchange held at 250–260 pesos per US$1 in 1969-1971, A currency reform was planned, but postponed as the peso began another rapid decline. By April 1973 the US dollar fetched 1,300 pesos on the open market.<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Paper<br>  <br>  [edit] 1937-1950 Banco de la República<br>  Notes issued in conformity with the law of 1935 were printed in England by de la Rue and put into circulation in 1937: 50 centésimos and 1, 5, 100, 500, and 1000 pesos. A 10-peso note was added in 1943. The notes of this series are undated. The earliest emissions had two engraved signature-titles. From 1945 there were three engraved signature-titles.

6fkD037Maa	Hi Moon! :)<br>  <br>  I'm not in Peru but I too love quinoa.<br>  <br>  I didn't make it myself for a long time though (instead buying it premade) because I was held up on the exact methods... specifically whether to toast or not and if so then when (before or after rinsing?). Some companies do rinse their quinoa before packaging but others don't and they don't seem to say so on the packages so it does seem (to me anyway) a bit confusing.<br>  <br>  But here's a great basic method from a commenter on a blog who made it seem so clear so I'm just going to repeat her words (wish I could link directly to her comment):<br>  <a href="http://www.101cookbooks.com/archives/warm-and-nutty-cinnamon-quinoa-recipe.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.101cookbooks.com/archives/war...</a><br>  ====<br>  Michelle said:<br>  For all of those Quinoa Skeptics who posted, yes, you should rinse the quinoa to remove the saponin, the natural, bitter component of the seed, and toasting it before cooking makes a huge difference in the final taste and texture (as it does for all grains and seeds!) This is the method I use:<br>  <br>  INGREDIENTS<br>  1 cup dry quinoa yields approximately 3 cups cooked<br>  1 ? c water or stock<br>  sea salt<br>  <br>  DIRECTIONS<br>  1. Rinse the quinoa: pour the grains into a fine-meshed strainer set over a large clear or white bowl and run water over it.<br>  <br>  2. Swish the grains around with your hand. Raise the strainer. If the water is clear and there are no bubbles, no more rinsing is needed. If the water is cloudy or sudsy, first check the grains closely and remove any twigs or other foreign matter.<br>  <br>  3. Return the strainer to the bowl and fill it with clean water.<br>  <br>  4. Rub the grains gently against the strainer.<br>  <br>  5. Lift the strainer and empty the bowl.<br>  <br>  6. Fill with fresh water and repeat until the water remains clear and there are no bubbles on the surface. (Red and black quinoa may bleed color, not to be mistaken with dirt or other impurities.) Allow quinoa to dry in strainer.<br>  <br>  7. Toast rinsed and dried quinoa in a small saucepan (whatever you would use to cook rice) on medium-low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon until a nutty aroma leaves the pan. Have the pot of simmering water or stock (1 ? c) on another burner.<br>  <br>  8. Once the grain smells toasty (about 2 min or so), carefully pour the hot water slowly into the pan with the quinoa (do this slowly or it will boil over). Add a good pinch of salt. Reduce to a simmer over low heat, and cook for approximately 15-17 minutes, until water is absorbed. Fluff with a fork and salt/season as desired.<br>  ====<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I would just use 2 cups liquid (475ml) just so I don't have to keep fractions in my head (meaning 1 part quinoa to 2 parts liquid, for example to increase amount made then 1.5 cups quinoa would need 3 cups water or other liquid and 2 cups quinoa would need 4 cups water; these should convert to metrics somehow with the 1:2 ratio but in the US they don't measure by dry weight so it gets confusing converting). And not all recipes need or benefit from toasted quinoa.<br>  <br>  From there you are only limited in how to fix it up by what you like as many people add things I would have never considered. I like it as a tabouleh sort of dish with finely chopped onions, tomatoes, cucumbers, parsley, flax oil, a touch of mint, etc mixed in. But, at the recipe where the above instructions came from is a sweet, morning cereal sort of dish with cinnamon and berries (I think this would be lip-smacking made with coconut milk and maybe mango). Another one I've seen that people really like is done with nori seaweed, Japanese Ponzu, sesame oil, chili sauce, and avocado.<br>  <a href="http://teaandcookies.blogspot.com/2008/06/life-death-and-quinoa.html" rel="nofollow">http://teaandcookies.blogspot.com/2008/0...</a><br>  <br>  Ponzu isn't vegetarian with the bonito flakes though if that's important (and Tamari is the best of the soy sauces, deeper & richer: in part because it's usually wheat-free):<br>  <a href="http://bitten.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/19/recipe-of-the-day-ponzu-sauce/" rel="nofollow">http://bitten.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/...</a><br>  <br>  Here's a Moroccan Inspired veggie and quinoa tagine dish which sounds luscious to me:<br>  <a href="http://thevagrantvegan.blogspot.com/2008/06/roasted-vegetable-tagine-with-spiced.html" rel="nofollow">http://thevagrantvegan.blogspot.com/2008...</a><br>  <br>  But, you can also just eat it plain with a bit of salt and oil of choice or use just as you would rice (or couscous) such as with beans.<br>  <br>  <br>  Right now my grain obsessions are steel cut oatmeal (with cinnamon, maple syrup, salt, and Earth Balance/butter sub) and Israeli couscous (with butternut squash and sage which all seem specifically made for each other).<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope you've been having a lovely weekend. :)|`|AA11565538	Oi!!

VCIexeqyaa	Hi, Im from Puerto Rico. I have stayed in that hotel a couple of times and all I had were great and fun experiences. The hotel is beautiful inside, and it looks even more when its dark and from the pool view. BTW, the pool its amazing too, so is the beach. Ive been sitting in the night in front of the beach in one of those hotel chairs in the sand and its so peaceful and just wonderful (romantic :D). <br>  The hotel restaurant its kinda expensive, but so are on other hotels like that. The rooms are nice, but I prefer the ones that have a view to the pool and beach. The ones that have the view to the parkings are kinda boring to me. In the hotel theres stores and a casino. The last time I stayed there was last october and I would love to go back soon. <br>  What I love the most about it its the pool and the beach. <br>  Thats my experience, hope that if you go youll have fun and find it a very nice place to be. ;)|`|51c3950a6091f00c09f0bddf8a2fab69aa	for me is the most wonderful hotel in Puerto Rico. had been there 3 times. and from there to San Juan is about 30 minute trip or less.|`|9DBNUqJ8aa	I haven't stayed there yet, but have a reservation in August.

41ERg1Gvaa	Sunnyside as a whole is a nice comfortable neighborhood.  However, the part south of Queens Boulevard is more of a working-class community, while the northern part, aka Sunnyside Gardens, is significantly fancier.|`|AA11565799	If you are near the boulevard in the 40s, you will have an easy walk to shopping and the train to Manhattan.  If you are more than an avenue block away, that walk at night could get lonely and cold, especially in winter.  There are nice restaurants and shops between 45th and 50th along the boulevard.  It's a real short train ride to midtown.|`|fFe75M3Baa	nice area. pretty quiet. safe area.|`|2EJoU2S4aa	The Sunnyside community is located in the Borough of Queens, just a few minutes from the Queensoro Bridge and the Queens Midtown Tunnel. We are one of the most trafficked areas in the city. More cars pass through our commercial district  of Queens Boulevard (Sunnyside’s restaurant row) each day than most neighborhoods see in a normal week. Located between the long-established communities of the Blissville area of Long Island City and Woodside, our unique location makes us easily accessible to Manhattan and only 15 minutes by train to Times Square or the Empire State Building.<br>        People in our area can often reach the theatre district faster then those living in some parts of Manhattan. Sunnyside is convenient, centrally located, and a great place to live, as long-time residents are quick to tell you.<br>       It’s believed Sunnyside got its name back in 1850 when the railroad built a station across from the Sunnyside Roadhouse Hotel.<br>  <br>  <br>  Rural Sunnyside farmland <br>  (circa 1900)<br>  Photo from the Van Riper Collection<br>  <br>               "Sunnyside is a neighborhood in northwestern Queens, lying within Long Island City and bounded to the north by the Sunnyside Yards, to the east by Calvary Cemetery and 51st Street , to the south by the Long Island Expressway, and to the west by Van Dam Street . The area is named for a roadhouse built on Jackson Avenue to accommodate visitors to the Fashion Race Course in Corona during the 1850s and 1860s. A small hamlet was built between Northern and Queens boulevards and became known as Sunnyside.<br>  <br>  Most of the land was low-lying and therefore cheap; from 1902 to 1905 the Pennsylvania Railroad gradually bought up all the land south of Northern Boulevard between 21st and 43rd Streets. The entire area was leveled and the swamps filled in by 1908 and the yards opened in 1910. The Queensboro Bridge opened in 1909 and from it was built Queens Boulevard , which ran to the center of the borough through Sunnyside, where streets were built along the boulevard. Sunnyside Gardens (1924-29), a complex of attached houses of two and a half stories, with front and rear gardens and a landscaped central court, was on e of the nation's first planned communities, hailed for its innovative design by such scholars of urban life as Lewis Mumford (a onetime resident). During the following years the neighborhood became middle class, and largely Irish. During the 1940s and 1950s its large apartments enticed many artists and writers and their families to leave their cramped quarters in lower Manhattan , and the area became known as the "maternity ward of Greenwich Village ." Sunnyside during the 1980s attracted immigrants from Korea , Colombia , Romania , and China , though on the whole fewer immigrants than some of the surrounding neighborhoods in northeastern Queens .<br>  <br>  The Sunnyside Railyards are used by the Long Island Rail Road , Conrail, and Amtrak. The Knickerbocker Laundry nearby is a striking example of art moderne architecture."<br>  <br>  Vincent Seyfried, Encyclopedia of New York City , Edited by Kenneth T. Jackson. New Haven , Yale University Press. 1995<br>  <br>        The German, Irish, Czech, Dutch and other Europeans were among <br>  the first groups to establish themselves in our area. However, as their children grew up, they moved to Long Island and upstate New York looking for more rural areas that were more like the early beginnings of<br>  the neighborhood they grew up in. Meanwhile, Sunnyside continues to <br>  grow and thrive and change. Today, we are a melting pot of people contentedly living together.<br>  <br>        Eastern Europeans, South Americans, Koreans, Middle Eastern, and the young Irish are once again relocating here. This influx of new immigrants accounts for the abundance of fine restaurants and unique choices in our food, coffee and spice stores, not often found in other areas. We take pride that you will find almost every ethnic restaurant right here in Sunnyside. Many people come to our area to dine and enjoy some of the finest eateries that can be found no where else in the city. Although part of the big City of New York, Sunnyside has retained its individual personality. Sunnyside is a small town in a big city. If  Manhattan is the Big Apple, then Sunnyside is its core that holds it together. Yes, this is a community where neighbors still do know each other.|`|2bca07912249cffd6d15a663fd5ae28caa	Sunnyside is a nice, safe, middle class area. not fancy, but not a slum, either. you'll do just fine there.|`|Vf6ebJiAaa	nice ! Queens is basically nice all over.
Ee8w6NY4aa	The printout is only for your own reassurance. When you check-in, you will actually only need a government-issued form of ID. The airline personnel will pull up your flight info from that alone. However, it cannot hurt to write down the confirmation code, but you do not need to bring the printout itself, so don't worry about that.
A9Mt3u4Qaa	First things first: congratulations on your very brave friend and to you for supporting him!  Now - it is a very easy drive from Atlanta straight down I-85 probably about 45 min, an hour at the most.  You can take one of the smaller planes into the Columbus airport but it will probably be quite expensive.  Sometimes there is a 'hospitality hotel' on bases that traveling soldiers and guests can stay in. When my daughter got married on Hunter Army Air Base in Savannah, she was able to reserve rooms for family members. <br>  Check out www.benningmwr.com/lodging31905.htm<br>  I can't remember any hotels right at the reservation, but there are quite a few of the usual Popular Hotels in Columbus<br>  <br>      * Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott<br>      * Hampton Inn<br>      * Marriott Columbus<br>      * Residence Inn by Marriott<br>      * Hilton Garden Inn<br>      * Wingate by Wyndham<br>      * The Rothschild Pound House<br>      * Wyndham Garden Hotel<br>      * Sleep Inn<br>      * Country Inn & Suites By Carlson, Columbus, GA<br>  <br>    Good luck in your travels and give my very best to your friend.|`|392fb9fe3924e0ea502b517efe20098daa	Atlanta to Columbus is an easy drive.

Use Travelocity, Hotels.com or the like to find a hotel.  Should be easy.
1d718ff96585004e8d1e8bc312c3655daa	I would never move to Nevada or Arizona - it's stifling hot in the summer time, and there's no natural water sources close by to cool off (clorinated pools get old fast, as I'm sure you know being from NC).<br>  <br>  I would go to San Diego - they LOVE their sports there (the Chargers and Padres, I guess, make my family members who live there go crazy - literally, if they lose a game I can't call for a week, especially if it's to the Giants as I'm a proud New Yorker).  Additionally, its GORGEOUS - not smoggy and polluted like L.A., not as many run-down areas as L.A., and I really feel like people are genuinely happier in San Diego.  There are so many things to see and do - with all their parks, museums, culture centers, and, of course, their beautiful beaches (I went to La Jolla for the first time this summer and couldn't believe how gorgeous it was).  The traffic can be a little annoying, but it's nothing near as bad as L.A., and I think the job situation, though not fantastic, is still at least existent.<br>  <br>  So, clearly, my suggestion is San Diego - I mean, you already have family, they can at least help get you set up, right?  Good luck!|`|cs0kjZFZaa	Cali is beautiful and wonderful, golden hills, farm land that feeds the world,redwoods, kelp forest, outstanding ocean..Az is too hot, a foreclosure hotbed, and all brown..I say Cali|`|Q0J5rjU6aa	I have lived in Phoenix and visited L.A., San Diego, and Las Vegas.  For a young, single dude like yourself, I would recommend San Diego. <br>  <br>  Phoenix is too hot and dry, and there is not much going on there.  There is great nightlife in Scottsdale and Tempe, but eventually it gets boring.  Phoenix is over-crowded (because everyone has been moving there), has lots of traffic, and lots of crime.  It is getting smoggy too.  Not as smoggy as L.A., but pretty smoggy.  <br>  <br>  San Diego is an amazing city, on the ocean, plenty of nightlife, and a lot more fun than Phoenix.  The only problem with San Diego is that it is so expensive.|`|lZrcHzSNaa	Hey man, I'm a young black guy who recently moved to Phoenix from Louisiana. I love it out here. There is always something to do. <br>  <br>  The night life is great. You can research clubs in Scottsdale and Tempe if you don't believe me. Plus, Arizona State University (one of the biggest party schools in the US) is here, so you know there are always places to party if you're into the college crowd. <br>  <br>  I don't know if you like the outdoors, but there are many outdoor things you can to do in Arizona.  Of course the summers can be be brutal. Being in Phoenix in the summer is like being in an oven, but Arizona is not just all desert as many people think. There are ski towns as little as 2 hours from Phoenix. Being from Louisiana, I had never really seen too much snow, so that was fun for me. <br>  <br>  Plus, most of the people I encounter here are not racist like in the south. People are really down to earth and judge for who you are and not your skin color. <br>  <br>  As far as the other cities you listed, I can only comment on San Diego b/c that's the only one of them I've been to. I vacationed there last year and loved it. It is a beautiful place with a lot to do. There are the beaches, the Gas Lamp District, Sea World, beautiful weather, and much more. As far as bad things, I did hear there are a lot of gangs in San Diego, but that's pretty much everywhere on the west coast. I also hear that the cost of living in San Diego (or anywhere in Cali) is a lot higher than other places.

reHRXlZCaa	Read the terms and conditions carefully.  <br>  <br>  The flights are sometimes cheap because they're at ridiculous hours of the morning, if you use public transport you need to make sure that the train/tube can get you to the airport for the flight.  If you're not taking public transport and there's no convenient coach and you don't live in the area, you might wind up paying a fair whack for a taxi.  Be aware if you need to cancel you won't get a refund - you can sell the flight on & change the name on the tickets, they will charge for the name change, about ￡30.  <br>  <br>  If you need to make any alterations to your flight they will charge you, in fact, the only thing Ryanair don't charge for, yet, is the air you breathe.  <br>  <br>  There is no allocated seating like other airlines, if you want a good seat, either go for priority boarding for which you will be charged extra or go stand at the top of the ordinary queue - there are two queues, one for priority boarding & the other for the rest of the plebs who were too cheap to pay extra for the privilege of being among the first on the aircraft : ) <br>  <br>  If you're putting a bag in the hold (you will be charged for this) make sure it is the exact weight allocated to you or under, you will be charged for the extra.  <br>  <br>  If you have opted not to take a bag and change your mind at the last minute, you will be charged to put the bag in the hold.  <br>  <br>  If you have opted for the online check in facility, make sure you do it within the time frame - if you need to check in when you get to the airport & you opted to check in online but didn't you will be charged, you also won't be able to check in online for the second leg of the journey & will have to check in again at the desk.<br>  <br>  Ryanair have always charged for food & drink on their flights<br>  <br>  If you choose to check in online, they will email you in advance to warn you you need to do it.  They will email to let you know that are restrictions on the weight & number of bags (1 bag only) you can take on board - they are planning to enforce the one bag per person in the cabin rule, I usually go through Stansted & they haven't started there yet, I don't know about Luton but you have been warned.  <br>  <br>  I've tried to give you as much information I have based on personal experience but with Ryanair, more then any other airline you need to pay attention to the terms & conditions.  <br>  <br>  Read any updates you receive from Ryanair, they tend to move the goalposts when you least expect it.<br>  <br>  PS they are quite good at taking off & getting to where you need to go on time but if anything goes wrong or there are delays don't expect an explanation<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: I agree with the other posters, they do tend to pick obscure airports but it tends to be more of a problem when you fly to Europe (East & West) then flying between the UK & Ireland.  A colleague once flew to Norway with them after getting a flight for next to nothing, only to discover he was 2 or 3 hours by public transport from where he needed to be.<br>  <br>  Regardless of who you fly with to Dublin Airport you will have the same journey to the city centre - there is public transport which has regular buses going into the city centre, you could also opt for a taxi but that can be expensive.|`|AA10985791	They are not, once you add in the tax, baggage fee and booking fees, etc etc etc you will find they are the same price as everyone else, except other airlines give you the courtesy of a seat number.<br>  <br>  Try Aerlingus website before booking with Ryanair to get the cheapest flight, they actually land in the city they say they will, not some place 29km away, where you are charged an extra €20 just to get to the nearest town.|`|zaLVhtwvaa	My German pal lives near Baden Baden / Karlsruhe<br>  <br>  He tells me that very often Ryan air fly to airports (or rather old disused air bases) which are usually a long way from the name of the airport.  Like for example Ryan airs "Frankfurt"  is a VERY long way from Frankfurt.<br>  <br>  The local government, the business associations etc etc make money from the plane loads of people coming through their obscure district, who otherwise would not be there spending money on taxes, duty, hotels, taxis trains and coaches, bars etc etc<br>  <br>  I understand some sort of deal is going on.<br>  <br>  But then again - all of the above could simply be a crock of sh*t.  Just can't trust these Germans (only joking)...<br>  <br>  p.s.<br>  <br>  check how far you will travel to Dublin center|`|f2959c3466eb9458fc5521de90e563d3aa	You get what you pay for, It's very bare bones and everything costs extra.

AA11759382	I've been going to Harrah's properties in Vegas for 3 years and been using comp rooms since the 2nd trip.  There have been times where I gambled little IMO (like $600 over 3 nights) where as I usually gamble around $1500 over 2 nights.  That's my gambling budget so the actual amount that I ran thru the machines and tables is much higher, which is what the casino tracks.  I've never had any problems when checking out.  Sometimes I can't get comped for Friday and Saturday but that hasn't happened in more than a year.  So, basically, as long as you gamble something, you should be okay.  I like to think that if you know the normal room rate, that would be the minimum you should gamble each day.  Obviously the more you gamble, the better the room offers and types ill be.|`|hCfjvfswaa	You need to use your casino players card. You place it at the side of your chips but must bet a minimum to get comps. For MGM/Mirage casino's, they have a minimum bet of $25/hand consistently throughout the day for comps. It ends up cheaper if you just purchase the rooms.|`|AA10240904	The comp is conditional on gambling, period.  They will track your gambling with the Players Card, etc.  Since you obviously gambled before, gamble about the same as you did that got you the invite in the first place.
zFwjZy53aa	First you need to do TONS of research, it helps alot in the long run. I would estimate $500 for the hotel, $300 for the rental car, add like $200-300 for shopping and normal living like eating and everything, plus the cost of tickets. It might seem like alot of money but beleive me on a road trip it goes quick!|`|8cf66894663c74e69b5ed17db7228d97aa	When i do a road trip vacation I make a book out of a 5x7 notebook and paste in all I find out-it becomes our "bible" to sit between the seats as we drive. Google maps and find the way you want to drive-figure how long each day plus a couple hours to gas up,eat etc. Pack food as it will save you lots on the road. I put each section/day with ideas on where to stay and things to see. My hubby says I'm the ultimate tourist! OddAmerica.com has great suggestions and also use Yahoo travel once you get ideas on where to stop each night-it has the local hotels, reviews, prices etc-copy off the decent ones and glue them in! Take the time to cut over to Zion National Park and stay at the Pioneer Hotel in Springdale,Utah at the entrance-small, clean and beautiful. About 120.00 a night for 2 dbls. The y have a site. Take the tram thru the canyon and be amazed at a hidden gem! The city is small and you can walk it and has fun coffee housesand art galleries etc. Its 2 hours to Vegas then-so you could drive to there the next night and stay in any of the big hotels. Vegas.com has many deals or you can go to the hotel sites. MGM is nice, Excalibur, Ceasars-they are all walkable to each other on the strip and you can sightsee the next day and into the night. They have a monorail now too up and down the strip. Then hit the road and come out the 15 freeway to Temecula,CA-it takes 4-5 hours of driving. Stay there in the hotels near there Old Town. Its the original Cowboy Pioneer town that is now filled with great food, antiques,wine tasting bars, music places and gift shops. Look up the city site and and click on Old Town there. On the way out the 15-stop at the Giant Thermomator and restaurants and get gas-its outside Vegas by about 1.5 hours going west and a good place to stretch your legs and hit the bathroom. Also Barstow-at the Factory Outlets on the west end of town-you can see them from freeway-huge. San Diego is about 1-1.5 hours from Temecula-see the Wild Animal Park, Seaworld, the Zoo-most hotels have special ticketing packages too see them. While you are at Balboa Park to see the Zoo-take some time at the Museums-top notch. Notice the architecture-most buildings were done as display buildings for a World's Fair years ago and are amazing.As to gas-ask the retal people how the mileage is-then figure monies out by how far you are driving-plus add a bit. Buy at grocery stores, picnic and hamburger ,meal it a lot and you can do ok. We did from Temecula thru Utah to Denver and back around with four for about 3,500.00. We didn't rent a "slug bug" though. I don't even understand that-do you mean a Beetle? With five-I'd rent a van! Good luck-use the internet and you will be amazed at how well you do in planning!|`|3q7x0Zfwaa	I once drove from Denver, CO to San Diego. It took us about 16 hrs, with about 3 stops to fill up on gas, eat, stretch, etc. Our gas was about $200 (gas was higher then). Don't know what it costs to rent a slug bug, the Zoo will run about $60 each, same with Sea World (look for coupons). You can find a Holiday Inn or something similar for about $100/night (maybe less, dependent upon the season). Add some spending money for food and shopping. Have fun!|`|rTaaIXSuaa	Whatever you do, DON'T end up staying in California.<br>  As a San Diego native myself, It is not a city it once was. I hate California now. <br>  I'm getting off topic, sorry.<br>  Even if you are going for only a week, be prepared to have some serious cash on you. I am assuming you did your research and know that California is very expensive.<br>  You honestly are cramping all these activities in one week and I guarantee you that you are going to not have enough time to REALLY see what you want to see. <br>  It cost me a little over 350 to drive from California to Cleveland so with gas prices down as they are and since you are closer to California than Ohio, you will pay less especially with a bug. I had one of those and I could go from California to Maine on a full tank of gas! lol<br>  My advice to you, keep things simple. Like you said, holiday inn, travel lodges, best western, those are all designed for people on a budget. Your best bet would be to reserve your week with one of them through hotwire or some other online source. From my experience it is usually cheaper that way. <br>  You will LOVE the taco shops! They are all over San Diego. <br>  As far as dinner wise for the family of 5, again keep it simple. Unless of course you have the extra to splurge.<br>  Sea World tickets are $65.00 per person. San Diego Zoo is $35 Wild Animal Park is also $35 which I like better.<br>  How much shopping do you plan on doing? I would advise you to make a stop in Tijuana, Mexico and shop there. Very cheap. Cheap to shop and cheap to eat.<br>  So in my estimation, have at LEAST a couple grand.
9g8spRvPaa	If gas costs $8.00 per gallon, and you are going around 800miles, seems like you will need about 27 gallons of gas to take the trip.<br>  Don't forget there are mountains etc. so your mileage will go down.I think you can do it for around $200. worth of gas.
1d718ff96585004e8d1e8bc312c3655daa	I drove through Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany and Austria last year with my boyfriend - we actually stopped at this huge rest stop (or raasthaus, whatever it's called, lol) in Innsbruck on our way to Italy.  It was a lot of fun.  We stopped in Munich, which was really interesting and a lot of fun to drink and socialize - the ride is sort of short from Prague to Innsbruck, though, and I don't see that you would actually pass through Munich unless you were to specifically take a longer route there.  Salzburg is nice - they're the home of a million different sausages or something like that, so you might have at least a good bite of real Austrian food.<br>  <br>  My suggestion is to visit your local AAA location and get a bunch of maps of Europe - they have them on hand, usually, or you call in first and make sure.  If you're a member, they're free - if not, I'm not quite sure how much they'll be ... Anyways, that's how we made our way through Europe, not by mapquest, but the old fashioned way (also, Mapquest doesn't have much in Central and Eastern Europe in terms of driving directions).<br>  <br>  Hope you have fun!

7jhR6r5waa	I would prefer Aruba to St Thomas. The beaches on St John and St Thomas are beautiful, but I think there is more to do on Aruba and the people are friendlier. Lots of water sports, lots of really good restaurants. Lots of lying on the beach. Bring lots of sun screen. My preference on hotels, because I like the high rises, would be the Hyatt, the Radisson, or the Westin, although if you go to tripadvisor.com  and check out the Aruba site, there are also some low rises that people really like. We like the high rises because we like to walk to the various restaurants and casinos at the hotels.|`|EJpiaCMQaa	I would choose Aruba over St. Thomas.  Aruba has better attractions and beaches.

It includes, for example, socialist Zionists such as Ber Borochov, religious Zionists such as rabbis Kook and Reines, nationalists such as Zeev Jabotinsky and cultural Zionists exemplified by Asher Ginsberg (Ahad Ha'am). Zionist ideas evolved over time and were influenced by circumstances as well as by social and cultural movements popular in Europe at different times, including socialism, nationalism and colonialism, and assumed different "flavors" depending on the country of origin of the thinkers and prevalent contemporary intellectual currents. Accordingly, no single person, publication, quote or pronouncement should be taken as embodying "official" Zionist ideology.<br>  <br>  Zionism is the ideological success story of the twentieth century.

The crime rate is low.<br>  <br>  Read a little about the island.<br>  <br>  Information on Barbados<br>  <br>  Barbados is a coral island, pushed out of sea by volcanic activity in a far away time. On the West Coast of Barbados, coral shore beaches of fine white sand stretch along a blue-green sea. Coral reefs fringe the Barbados shoreline to provide excellent snorkeling and Scuba Diving. Along the East Coast a lively surf is blown briskly by the strong and constant trade winds and the waves pound against a rocky shore. The constant breeze of the trade winds gives Barbados a mild and pleasant tropical climate.<br>  <br>  When you visit Barbados, you will see it is mostly a flat coral island with excellent beaches, but there are rolling hills and many deep ridges and gullies, with an interesting distribution of flora and fauna. Within the Barbados coral core there is a vast array of caves and underground lakes which provide an excellent supply of drinking water that is amongst the purest in the world. Geologically Barbados is unique, being actually two land masses that merged together over the years. This and other anomalies make this Caribbean Island quite phenomenal, and there are geological structures that you will find only in Barbados.<br>  <br>  Barbados Expectation<br>  Barbados is a very beautiful island, with lots of art, activities, night life, music, history and some of the best restaurants to be found anywhere. But what makes Barbados even more special, and the reason why so many visitors keep returning to the island year after year, is the people. Barbadians, called Bajans, are warm and friendly souls, always ready to greet you with a sincere smile. Barbadians make you feel welcome and special, in this lovely Caribbean Island.

AA11528510	Truth is that in Germany as in other Europeans countries, marriage age is very flexible and you can met many people who are not getting married whole life but living in informal relationships. Life in Europe looks different than in Asia or America. Most of us is studying till 26 (in Germany you can met some long life students) so we feel young longer:D Being student and having family same time is almost impossible but people who are not going to the university are usually getting married earlier.|`|1d718ff96585004e8d1e8bc312c3655daa	I love Europe because there is no rush to get married - 29 is still young, particularly for a man.  I would start to worry by the time you get to your late 30s .... many Europeans go to school, travel, or work and have other priorities before marriage.  Additionally, as you well know, space and housing is limited in Europe and it's not so easy to settle down and marry, just to move in with your parents because rental prices are too high and houses are unavailable.
fKpBXXJbaa	England comes from "Angle-land" after the Angles who moved there in the 5th century, with the Saxons. Similarly, Scotland is named after the land of the Scots, who moved there from Ireland about the same time.<br>  Wales, though, comes from the Anglo-Saxon word "wealisc" which means "foreign" or "not like us", since the people who lived there used to live in the whole island before the Anglo-Saxons arrived. Germanic peoples used similar names when they came across basically-settled Celtic peoples after the Roman empire collapsed - Wallonia in Belgium, Wallis/Valais in southern Switzerland, and Wallachia in Romania all have the same origin as Wales.<br>  Calling people who come from a particular place "...ers" reflects what happens in the German language, though in English I think it's more common to use a variant of the town name + ians e.g. Lancastrians, Cestrians, Bristolians. I don't even know what you call people from Leeds!|`|baaf30673b204103b269ddf718be2c5caa	England derives from the  Angles - Angle-land changed to England.|`|c9469a0c25b4c415d92edc506376c2afaa	Londoners - would sound stupid calling them Lonpudlians (Liverpudlians) or Luncunian (Mancunian). <br>  <br>  England - is the name given the country.

f017f8823df1bdf2af599a926019d98baa	It is certainly doable.  We went for five days last summer on a limited budget and I was worried because everyone kept warning me how much more expenive things were in NYC.  The shows and shopping were our big expenses.  Transit passes ($25 will cover your whole stay)and comfy shoes will cover most of your travel.  We did spring for taxis when our feet got really sore.  Form our hotel near Grand Central all of our taxi rides, including tip, were under $15 each.  Most were under $10.<br>  <br>  Food places are everywhere and you can eat well and cheaply if you are flexible.  At least one place in every block will offer bagels and coffee for a breakfast of under $5.  If you get tired of bagels, muffins and juice, pastries and water will all keep you under $5.  If you want to eat someplace "nice" go for lunch instead of dinner, the prices will be lower.  Some of our best meals came from the little stores in every block that had everything from sandwiches to sushi.  A meal including drink and dessert could be had for under $10.  Stay away from the "chains"...why anyone would go to NYC and overpay for a burger at TGIFridays (or any similar place) when they could get authentic ethnic food for about the price of a meal at McDonald's is beyond me.  Fill a water bottle every night before you go to bed and start your day out with that cold bottle.  You will be surprised at how much water you buy during your stay.  But most places sell a bottle for around $1.<br>  <br>  Your budget will be more than adequate for food and transportation.  Since you are not shopping, your biggest expenditure will probably be entertainment.  And that you can pretty much figure out ahead of time.  Research any shows or attractions you want to see before you go, and then you will have a much better idea of what your expenses will be.<br>  <br>  A couple of tips...If you want to see a show but do not have your heart set on exactly which one, try the day of sales at the ticket booths.  The ones in Times Square don't sell tickets until the afternoon of the show, but if you go to the booth at the South Seaport Museum area they start sales in the morning, and the lines are not as long.<br>  <br>  If you want to do a tour of Central Park, consider the pedi-cabs over the carriage ride.  I think the price was almost identical, but the pedi-cabs went further and the guides were entertainment in and of themselves.  (This may have been the favorite part of the trip for my kids who were preteen and teenage).<br>  <br>  You can get a great view on the tram to Roosevelt Island.  This is the tram that was in the movie Spiderman.  A tram ride is $2, but I think your metro pass may cover it.  You can also ride the bus along Roosevelt Island for 25 cents.  Not much to see on the Island itself, but it is relaxing and quiet if the weather is nice.|`|bQraDPLUaa	It is possible so long as that does not include lodging. <br>  <br>  There is plenty of cheap and good food (hope you like pizza!).|`|NelWFq5Paa	maybe that is possible if you stay at a relatives home|`|URO3gDXcaa	if that does not include lodging, it is enough.|`|I4SwADdUaa	can i go ??? plz|`|f8aa8e21997cfa7908574dfa12f124cdaa	Should be about enough, since lodging and shopping is not included.

Olsen Cruise Line, Oceania, P&O Cruises, Peter Deilmann, Regent (Radisson) Seven Seas Cruises, SeaDream, Star Clippers, and Uniworld. <br>  <br>  The following cruise lines require that either <br>  1) All passengers in a cabin must be 18 or older, or <br>  2) If anyone in the cabin is younger than 18 years old, someone in the cabin must be 21 or older: Disney Cruise Line, GAP Adventures, Silversea and Viking River Cruises. <br>  <br>  The following cruise lines require that at least one person in each cabin is 21 or older: Azamara, Celebrity, Costa (25 for March and April sailings), Crystal Cruises, Voyages of Discovery, Hurtigruten, MSC Cruises, Norwegian Cruise Line, Princess Cruises, Royal Caribbean and Seabourn Cruise Line. <br>  <br>  The following cruise lines require that either <br>  1) All passengers in a cabin must be 21 or older, or <br>  2) If anyone in the cabin is younger than 21 years old, someone in the cabin must be 25 or older: Carnival, Holland America and Windstar Cruises. <br>  <br>  One exception to these age requirements is often made for underage married couples, who as long as they are both 18 are allowed to board unaccompanied. These couples may be asked to show proof of their marriage. This exception is based on individual cruise line policy. <br>  <br>  Your age on the date of sailing is generally considered your age for the length of the cruise.|`|JrVcss4zaa	I just wanted to add, there are few exceptions to their policy. I am not sure any of these fit your circumstances but I thought it may be helpful for someone...<br>  <br>  Guests are required to be 21 years old (on embarkation day) to travel. Guests under the age of 21 must be accompanied in the same stateroom by a parent or guardian 25 or older. The exceptions Carnival will make to this policy are: <br>  <br>  --Married minor couple - The booking must be documented that the couple is married. The couple must have proof of marriage at embarkation or they will be denied boarding without the benefit of a refund. <br>  <br>  -- Domestic Partners/Same-Sex Union minor couple - The booking must be documented that the couple are legal Domestic Partners/Same-Sex Union.  The couple must have legal proof of partnership/union at embarkation or they will be denied boarding without the benefit of a refund. <br>  <br>  --Miltary personnel age 18/19/20 will be an exception to Carnival Age Policy. The age exception will apply to the cabin the personnel occupies as well as the guest in his/her cabin. <br>  <br>  --Guest ages will be verified at embarkation. Guests not conforming to this policy will be denied boarding and assessed a 100% cancellation penalty. NO exceptions will be made at embarkation.|`|oig2YZB7aa	The only time that they will wave the age restrictions is if one of you is active duty military. But otherwise Royal maybe your best option.<br>  Double check with the crusie line and see what they say.<br>  Just remember you will not be able to drink on the ship if you are not 21. <br>  Hope this helps.

2yHKfZVxaa	Depends on what part of Inglewood you mean - it's not a small city.  Boyz In Da Hood took place just outside of Inglewood, and it was a typical Hollywood exaggeration.  There are parts of Inglewood that are dangerous, but to be honest, the scariest parts are near Los Angeles International Airport, so if you plan on taking a trip anywhere near L.A., you'd have to deal with the scary **** in Inglewood no matter what.<br>  <br>  There is public transportation but it's far from the residential areas, so be prepared to rent a car, take a cab, bum a ride from your aunt or walk, unless she lives very close to the major streets.  <br>  <br>  Venice Beach is about 25 away by car (1 - 2 hours by bus), Studio City is about 45 minutes away by car (1 - 3 hours by bus).  The landmarks most people think of when they think Los Angeles are north of Inglewood, through a mess of traffic.  <br>  <br>  To be honest, though, if you've ever been to a big city, you already know how it is.

h1IYS0dbaa	Hello<br>  <br>  Your problem has nothing to do with the cantonal legislation of Canton de Vaud. The problem is in the federal law.<br>  <br>  The Road Traffic Act of Switzerland (RTA) has been modified a short while ago.<br>  <br>  Here you have the new art. 15a of the RTA in French:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.admin.ch/ch/f/rs/741_01/a15a.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.admin.ch/ch/f/rs/741_01/a15a....</a><br>  <br>  A cut-off date has been defined by the legislator in order to fix for which driving licenses the new law should be applicable. In other words: What's the starting point for the new licenses given to the applicants, because from that moment on, the licenses shall only be given 'on probation'.<br>  <br>  The cut-off date is December 1, 2005. If your driving license was given to you after that date, your license must be considered as given 'on probation'.<br>  <br>  The duration of this probation period is three years according to the law. The driving license becomes definite, when the probation period is over. During this period, there shouldn't be serious violations of the law (I'm not talking about parking tickets). Besides that, you have to go to a special course about 'avoiding dangers of the circulation better' and 'managing the environment'.<br>  <br>  The big question is, when these 3 years do start.<br>  <br>  After the issue of your British license or after the issue of your new Swiss license?<br>  <br>  In my opinion, it would be discriminatory if your probation period would start after the issue of the Swiss license because, if your British license was issued in January 2006 and you'd get the three years from now on, you'd be a driver with 6 years of experience and still with a license on probation. This can't possibly be what the legislation is intending to do.<br>  <br>  If this is what the police wants from you, you should see a lawyer and ask him about it.<br>  <br>  Please let me know about this detail. I'm curious!|`|sjERiFeNaa	i was here about a yr or so when i got my swiss license. i didnt have to sit a test. maybe it depends on which type of permit you have to be here. i have a B.. my original drivers license is australian.. <br>  if ur not sure, you should really inquire further. good luck :)
LRSTXXaUaa	yes - they usually are very strict. the more overweight the plane is - the more gas it will use and the worse "gas milage" it will get. On my most recent trip to Asia, we actually had to stop in Taiwan to refuel....we were going to HK.

ckxpknr0aa	Mmmmm.... tricky one. <br>  <br>  Though it's not my favourite I would suggest maybe staying on Phuket. From there you can get over to Phi Phi (where The Beach was filmed) and also Phananga Bay where there are amazing karst formations. Phuket is more geared up to day trips tha anywhere else. <br>  <br>  Fo nearness to Bangkok I can recommend my favourites - Ko Chang and Ko Samet though these are very much "lie on the beach" places, stunning but not much else to do!<br>  <br>  I haven't been to Ko Samui but you could stay there and hop over to Ko Phangan for a full moon party, or Ko Tao for diving. <br>  <br>  Ko Lanta is another from which you could get to Phi Phi, Krabi and Ao Nang. I loved this area.<br>  <br>  All in all if you have to pick one base I'd go to Phuket, not least as there are loads of honeymoon 5* hotels there which are lacking in some of the other places I mentioned. The other places are limited in where you can get to in a day!!|`|JvM44Bx5aa	I would recommend Phuket.

It's in Krabi province you can fly from Bangkok to Krabi and take a transfer to pier and get to Lanta by ferry. From there, you can have a trip to nearby island like 4 islands day trip , to Koh Rok to Trang or to Phi Phi Island. It's more quiet than Phuket.|`|VGMFkcziaa	Pattaya Beach|`|lSoNAOoOaa	on the bed

q22ngVmkaa	I would move immediately to San Antonio - there's tons to do compared with Houston.|`|nF9DZ0sOaa	I hear you.  I was a "weekend wife" for over a year while my husband worked in San Antonio and I was living in Corpus Christi, trying to get our house sold and various other things wrapped up.<br>  <br>  In the end, the decision has to be yours.  You need to decide what is the most important to you.  You and the boyfriend need to have a serious discussion about the future.  Does he want to move to Houston when he finishes school?  It sounds like you're really attached to your family, so if you can't contemplate leaving Houston because of them, and if your boyfriend doesn't plan on living and working in Houston when he graduates, I'd say you have a problem.<br>  <br>  My husband and I traded weekends.  On Friday evenings, either he would come to Corpus, or I would go to our place near San Antonio.  We'd stay until either Sunday evening or EARLY Monday morning, then head back to work.  It was all right, but ultimately I decided I'd rather be a full-time wife, so I moved to be with my husband, and have never regretted that!  Of course, the situation is a little different...we were and are married, where you are still just in the "talking about it" stage.<br>  <br>  Still, I'll say again, ultimately the decision is yours.  But in this economy, I wouldn't leave one job until I had another one firmly nailed down!<br>  <br>  Good luck with your decision.|`|7o3DMzXQaa	why can't yall still date and live in different cities?

2q1XI0j9aa	Royal Caribbean is better by far and the bigger ships are exquisite (voyager and freedom series) I have been on both carnival and Royal Caribbean, and the carnival ship was old and stinky, the customer service sucked big time and they didn't have anything for teens to do ( I was 16 when I went on the Carnival) Royal Caribbean was amazing and so much fun and they had so much more to do than the carnival. Granted Carnival is cheaper but you get what you pay for.|`|38IZfJqiaa	I have been on a Royal Caribbean Cruise to the Bahamas and it was great! <br>  <br>  Highly recommend them.|`|4Nos4X8jaa	ROYAL CARIBBEAN DEFINITELY!<br>  <br>  I went on one (Explorer of the Seas) and it was AMAZING! Omg you shud soooooooo go on RC !!<br>  <br>  We went back again after 2 years coz it was so much fun!!!! There are soo many things to do on the ships never mind the ports of call! There is ice-skating (real ice), a promenade, discos, nightclubs, casinos, like 4 different pools, jacuzzis, day clubs, a spa, like 5000 sunbathing spots, pubs (yes, pubs on a cruise!) , a theatre for shows, comedy shows, dance shows, ice shows, rock climbing, golf, basketball, football, a gym, bars, resteraunts, midnight feasts, OMG the list is endless !!!!!!<br>  <br>  And on Royal Caribbean Cruises you can get these cool cards for 18 and unders i think  - you pay a fixed price at the beginning (cant remeber how much) then you get unlimited soft drinks which you really need coz its sooo hot ! lol :D  <br>  <br>  Also you can just go to the cafe and get a hot chocolate and a cookie or pizza or something and you dont have to pay extra coz its part of the price !!!!! I NO !!!!! Its amazing !<br>  <br>  Lol i know ive gone on a bit but I had an amazing time and I really really really recommend Royal Caribbean !<br>  <br>  Another thing is that I have also been on a Carnival cruise an yes, it was good but things weren't as big and exciting and there isnt really a cruise atmosphere ! It was fun though, dont get me wrong but I think for a spring break you would be better with Royal Caribbean!<br>  <br>  I know ive gone on for a bit but I hope this helps !!! x x x x x <br>  <br>  PS - the cleaning guy at Royal Caribbean comes into your room to clean and then makes animals out of towels and stuff - IT IS SOO COOL !!! Lmao he used ma goggles as eyes !! The people are just so friendly !!  Lol x x x|`|oiDwss3kaa	Right away I forsee a problem...since you guys are only 16, I hope you are looking into bringing a parent with you. The cruise guidelines say that if you are under 18 you need to have a legal parent/guardian stay in the same stateroom with you. If thats already taken care of, then dont worry about what I just said.<br>  <br>  Anyway, there arent too many differences between the two cruise lines. Both treat you like royalty, have great entertainment and 24 hour room service (free!). The only thing I saw that was slightly different was the staterooms in Carnival were a little bigger than Royal Caribbean. But this of course depends on which ships you cruise on...obviously the newer boats are ginormous compared to the ones built 15 years ago. I wish I had cons for them, but I have been on 5 cruises and have not had a single complaint on any of them. <br>  <br>  One point of advice: if you get motion sickness, take meds with you because you WILL feel the rocking of the boat, no matter how big it is.|`|bNrrTyrQaa	Royal Caribbean is 2000 times better. All carnival is, is trashy and a dump. On Royal Caribbean you can have fun while the ship is'nt even a dump. they keep their ship very clean!|`|rizkN0ooaa	i would recommend Royal Caribbean,

Hotel accommodation is also expensive, if you're planning to stay near Central London.
RMS7eFfpaa	Honestly, your chances of getting a job in France in your field without speaking french is very very very low. In general, getting jobs in france is much harder than in the US, b/c their laws of different, and companies don't have employment at will as we do here, so they take a long time to make sure they are hiring someone for good. And with their high rate of unemployment, even the French have a hard time finding jobs. The only job you might be able to get without speaking French is teaching English. Look into that option, try institutions such as the wall street institute, etc|`|aKEK24o4aa	well honestly you may have a hard time adjusting at first, Paris and life in France is completely different than the US.  Not necessarily in a bad way btw.<br>  <br>  As far as jobs, there are options for you even if you don't speak French, since there are American Companies in Paris.  You can also try the French American school in Paris.<br>  <br>  I was thinking of moving back myself (I'm originally from France but have been working and living in the US for several years) and found this cool website with job postings for english speaking jobs.<br>  <a href="http://www.jobsinparis.fr/" rel="nofollow">http://www.jobsinparis.fr/</a><br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  for what it's worth, most people that move to France, never come back to the US :-)  so I hope you like it there, the lifestyle is great once you get used to it, and let's face it - you can't beat the food!!|`|iJvRB9fvaa	Good news: you don't have to know French to get a job.  Just look for an international company (American).  It might however be difficult to get a job with your job experience as payrool and HR is connected to the country (very different from US).|`|82c38c7e1b4b77ced82d456cc67d5fd6aa	Read the book "Savoir Flaire"  by Polly Platt<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Savoir-Flair-Enjoying-France-French/dp/0964668432/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1235889185&sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Savoir-Flair-Enjoy...</a><br>  <br>  She also wrote a book "French or Foe" <br>  <br>  These are written by an american about living and working in France.<br>  <br>  There are other books too written for/by expats living in France.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

94b8KImYaa	If I understand you right, then your F-1 visa is expired, but you are legally in the US with your EAD, correct ? <br>  <br>  In order to work as a non-US citizen onboard a cruise ship you will need a C1/D visa (if you start or end your contract in an US port and if the cruise line is sailing in US waters during your contract) <br>  Once you would have a job with a cruise line and a contract, they will issue and employment/application letter for you, with which you would need to go to the US embassy in your home country and apply for a C1/D visa (which is a visa for seamen) <br>  <br>  So first you need to get the job with a cruise line and then you would need to check if they would change your current status in the US, or if you would need to return to your home country to get the visa. <br>  <br>  Even if you would have your F-1 visa renewed in the States, it will not be good enough for working onboard a cruise ship. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|0xWAHvKYaa	I am not sure if you need to renew your visa or not but since you will be in other countries you probably are going to have to since you are going to be in those countries longer than a passport's time.  I am sure if you go on one of the cruise lines websites it will give you all the info you need to know.|`|hCfjvfswaa	Yang, yes you need to renew your visa as it will be asked for when you apply for the job and sign the contracts. You need an updated passport as well.
EJpiaCMQaa	I personally liked the rooftop tour better because you get an awesome view of the countryside and see some rooms that most people never get to see.  Although, if there's any way you can do both tours, that would really be great.  Make sure to purchase your tickets early.  Visit the gardens, because they are lovely.  The Bake Shop has some delicious pastries and coffee.  A great way to start out the day.

Open your eyes and see -- the promised land awaits you.<br>  <br>  Q: My friends are coming to visit and want to see real Vegas on the cheap. Where can I take them? <br>  <br>  A: Let's be honest here ... your friends are asking you to be their own free personal tour guide. Right? And because they're your friends, that's cool. Right? So, here's what you do -- get it all done in one shot. Start your day off with a cheap but tasty breakfast. Then head over to the Fiesta for blackjack. With its betting limits as low as $3 and single- and double-deck tables, it's a great deal. Take it from us, avoid the 5-cent slots. They may look like a bargain, but they're not. Outside of Megabucks, nickel slots keep the highest percentage for the house of any slots. Translation, more money for the casino and less for you. When lunchtime rolls around, feed your friends a 75-cent hot dog from the Gold Coast. For an after-lunch show, head across the street to the Rio for its free Masquerade Show In The Sky. When your friends are ready for dinner, take 'em over to Mr. Lucky's 24/7 and order the steak-and-shrimp special. It's an off-the-menu item -- ask for it specifically. And for the finale, take 'em for a walk on the Strip. Be sure to catch a free showing of the Sirens of TI along the way; from what we hear, they are a dangerously beautiful bunch of women. <br>  <br>  Q: I'm looking to do Vegas on a very limited budget. <br>  <br>  A: You're in luck, kid. We've got something just for you. Book your stay through LasVegas.com and get a great deal on your room. When you arrive, make sure to pick up a copy of Las Vegas Magazine. Scan the ads and you'll find a number of coupons to ease the cost of your Vegas vacation. For dining, check out LasVegas.com's dining bargains list. If you don't mind being on the hotel's mailing list, sign up for any of the slot clubs. The hotel usually provides you with a free tchotchke just for signing up, and if you use your card while playing, you earn points toward other freebies. For your nighttime adventures, check out some of the great free lounge shows in Vegas. <br>  <br>  Q: Are there any inexpensive (or free) shows in Vegas? <br>  <br>  A: Vegas is all about giving things away. Here's what we're thinking: When you're in Vegas, check out some of the great free lounge shows, then head over to the Carnaval Court at Harrah's for live music all day long or check out one of these many free shows and attractions. Also, make a visit to the Grand Canal Shoppes at the Venetian and watch the Living Statues do their thing. If you want a photo with the statues, politely tug on of their clothing, tell 'em you're a friend of ours and then snap your photo. Oh, and don't forget to do the customary Vegas thing, tip those statues a dollar -- it's how they make a living. <br>  <br>  Q: What are the best buffet deals in town? <br>  <br>  A: If you're looking for cheap, check out the Circus Buffet at Circus Circus. If you want something more middle of the road, hit the buffets at any of the Station Casinos. We also hear Garden Court Buffet at Main Street Station has good food for very little cash. <br>  <br>  Q: What free (or almost free) things can I do with the kids? <br>  <br>  A: So, the kids wanna have fun, too? Don't fret. There's a reason they say Vegas has something for everyone. Here are a few free options: the Midway Circus Act at Circus Circus, the Masquerade in the Sky, the Lion Habitat at MGM Grand and the fountain shows and aquarium at the Forum Shops at Caesars. If you're still itchin' for more options, check out our list of free attractions.<br>  <br>  Q: Can you share any additional ways to save a buck or two while in Vegas? <br>  <br>  A: So you haven't hit the jackpot yet and you're looking to save a few bucks on expenses to cover your next bet at the tables. Worry not, LasVegas.com is here to help. <br>  <br>  Don't valet your car. While valet parking is free at hotels, it is expected that you tip the valet attendant. Save a few bucks and walk off that buffet dinner, park your own car in the free garage or lot. <br>  Don't order room service. We know, it sounds tempting, but room service includes all kinds of additional charges and fees, and you need to tip the room service attendant. Our suggestion: get out of bed and find an affordable 24-hour coffee shop. <br>  Skip the soft drinks and the bottled water at restaurants. With soda costing as much as $3 a glass, and bottled water (think Evian or Voss) even more, your drinks can cost as much as half your meal. Even if the waiter is trying to talk you into bottled water, just order ice water. <br>  Don't get gas on the Strip. While those conveniently located gas stations are great, take a few extra minutes to drive east or west to get cheaper gas. With today's gas prices, you will be happy you did. <br>  Order wine by the bottle. If two or more people are drinking wine and can settle on the type of grape that you like, you can save some money by ordering a bottle. <br>  Don't buy sundries in the hotel
rGXrh38aaa	The weather might be quite cold. It depends where abouts in the country you go. For instance, in England, usually, London is a few degrees hotter than the northern areas. It could be very cold but it might be mild-ish. It really depends. Make sure you bring a nice, big coat and you should be fine.

Vancouver and Montreal are two and I presume Toronto and possibly Winnipeg. All mail that has to clear customs must go thru one of these cities. <br>  In your case, it's possible that lazy.. er overworked Customs staff in Toronto sent a truckload of parcels to Montreal because thestaff in Montreal wasn't as busy. Or they could have asked USPS to send a truckload directly to Montreal for the same reason. Or maybe USPS threw it in the wrong truck. <br>  (Btw, all postal packages for the 3 western provinces are all sent to Vancouver for customs clearance.

fmHyfVmVaa	There was a time that everything was my fault. I was trained to think that way, or rather it was beaten into me. Today, I have been trained to see the situation clearly & see if I made an error. The point is however, even if I am in error, guilt, regret, depression, all these ways of reacting will only serve to make sure I get nothing done today so tomorrow I can feel bad about myself again & repeat the whole process. Today if I am in error I try to see it clearly, learn from it so I don't repeat it, & make what ever amends I can. But then I just have to let it go & move on.

4866706db971340b74753220df8876f7aa	The first thing to get is a travel guide like Frommers. They class restaurants by their cost. The other thing to do is stay out of the high rent districts like Ginza, Shibuya, and Shinjuku unless you have a specific restaurant in mind. Concentrate on eating Japanese food. Its your best value. Decent food can be found in or near train stations and major department stores in the basement or top floor. The less expensive restaurants do not have English menus. One of the things we looked for were restaurants that displayed plastic food in their window. I explained to the waitress that I did not speak Japanese and I showed the waitress what I wanted by pointing to it in the display. Also, you can get off the beaten path, a little, look down side streets and look for signs that look like restaurants.   Do not be afraid to wander around in Tokyo. It is one of the safest cities in the world.|`|fo5VHocxaa	Theres LOTS of small, comfy restuarants in Tokyo , i live there! Many places offer good food , healthy options and often pride themselves on their service! Yes , it is rude to eat on the street, not only in Japan , but everywhere. And Generally japanese eat with chopsticks , so it would be quite difficult to eat with chopsticks , while holding the food , and walking on the street.|`|5ZtSR0IQaa	I can't help you if your definition of expensive has a very low threshold. A 1,000 yen meal should not be expensive. Even 1,500 yen shouldn't be.<br>  <br>  If you're really stuck with a meal budget under 1,000 yen, you're better off going to the basement level of department stores, where they have fancy bento boxes for a decent price. And if you really insist on sitting down, you can always go to Yoshinoya for a beef bowl under 500 yen, unless you're vegetarian.<br>  <br>  If you're just looking to find good place to eat in Japan/Tokyo, your resources would be wide if you read Japanese and could pick up a copy of Tokyo Walker or Pia. Even Yahoo Japan has a decent restaurant guide where you can search by price range.<br>  <br>  Or if you need an English language resource, bento.com or metropolis.co.jp?|`|qpX0KAAsaa	I don't know which parts of Tokyo you were in, but in most places it's not that hard to find inexpensive sit-down restaurants serving ramen, sushi, tonkatsu, curry, Chinese food, and what have you. On the other hand, they often seem to be nowhere in sight when you're hungry and in an unfamiliar area. Lots of people also buy food in convenience stores and supermarkets, and usually take it back to their office or home to eat. If you're a tourist, that might not be possible.|`|AA10662056	I don't know what you mean by "tons of places to buy food".<br>  <br>  If you order food at a restaurant, you can eat there.<br>  <br>  If you buy food at a store, you just bring it to home and eat.<br>  <br>  That's it.

But people involved with the drug trade do live in the state of Nuevo Leon and something COULD happen in Monterrey--that's all the state department is saying.|`|jhjn1QVQaa	My husband's family is from Monterrey, Mexico, so we travel there about 4-5 times a year.  The only unsafe thing about it is the traffic.  They don't necessarily obey the traffic signs as strictly as people do in the United States. Other than that, I wouldn't have anything to worry about.|`|HCcCj3x6aa	You will have fun back in Monterrey believe me, is a big city with a lot of places to go and plenty to do..Just be sure to hang around safe areas and use common sense. you will like the place.
AA12354535	Madrid and Barcelona are the most expensive cities in Spain. You should definitely do it but I would recommend going to a smaller city like Valencia, Alicante or Murcia. You could end up paying half the rent that you would in the bigger cities and you will be able to learn Spanish just the same.<br>  Rents depend on the location and size you are looking for but in these cities, you are looking at between 450-650€ a month for a 2-3 bedroom place but you might find it more fun to share with Spanish people.<br>  If you search on the internet, you can look for "habitacion en alquiler" or "apartamento en alquiler" for rooms or flats respectively.<br>  It is as easy to find a job as the flexibility you have / effort you put in so don't let anyone put you off.<br>  You don't exactly need to be the queen of the Spanish debating society to work in a bar or restaurant and if you are looking to improve your Spanish, it sounds like you already know some. <br>  I would definitely recommend renting your place and getting your course when you are here though as there are services on the internet that charge absolute fortunes more than you would be charged if you were in situ.<br>  Spain is definitely the place to be to improve your Spanish so you won't regret it!<br>  <br>  Have fun and good luck.|`|ZSOxZFLbaa	Are you English or American?  IT IS REALLY DIFFICULT TO FIND WORK!!!!!  Americans, in addition, need to get work permits/visas, and THAT, too, is a huge difficulty.

You are NOT going to have an easy time of it!|`|vtAywfhSaa	You should! I lived there for 5 months and loved it. I went through a study abroad program for school which can be pretty expensive. You should research places to live and then teach English. A few of my friends stayed behind and taught English so they could stay there. They got paid $800 and provided room and board.|`|NItoL2Liaa	spain is the best country for live ;)|`|6ua7zLKraa	I lived in Spain for 5 months while I was in college. Depending on the size of the city you want to live in, you may have trouble getting all of this figured out based on only an elementary level of Spanish. I speak a pretty advanced level of Spanish and even after learning a lot about the EU way of life, I still would feel uncomfortable moving to Spain on my own.<br>  <br>  I think your best bet would be to look for programs that allow you to work and live with a host family. These programs will usually take care of all of the administrative issues for you and help you get settled with a home and job. Maybe an Au pair (live-in nanny) situation would work well for you and help you make money while you are there. A friend of mine is doing this in Italy and it living in a nice house, learning Italian with a host family and getting paid a salary!<br>  <br>  It may be difficult to find a job without speaking much Spanish without some type of a program's aid. If you start with something like this, you will have a better knowledge of the country and improved Spanish speaking skills so that you can make an educated decision about what you would like to do thereafter, on your own.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!

Because they are nomadic, its hard to find assistance and aid from their country of citizenship.  You combine this with insurgency in their traditional regions, drug trafficking, and crime, making governments uneasy to assist those who actually need assistance.

You still have to get a ticket with the pass, so if you go to the JR counter, present your pass, and ask for a ticket to Kyoto (for example) you should get your ticket and they should be able to tell you where your platform is.

You cannot generalize like that...and intelligence is not based on nationality.  I'm sure there are very smart and very dumb people just as in anywhere else in the world.  I lived there for 8 years and I can say it's a beautiful country...there's still a lot to be done but I have the best memories from my time there.  Peruvian cuisine is wonderful and so is Cuzco (probably my favorite place in Peru)...I hear sometimes how Peru is underrated when compared to some other countries and I still don't understand why, I mean as I said there's still a lot that can be improved but Peru has also come a long way over the years.<br>  So to answer your question: peruvians are people just like you and me, they can be smart or not so smart, depends on each person not where they were born...What do I have to say about them? They are very kind to foreigners, they like it when people visit their country so they are very welcoming...and where in the world am I? In Europe.|`|RlXnu2Xyaa	I know someone from Peru... ME.

We went to Quebec City, and I will say it was a lot of fun.<br>  <br>  I believe it was the first relatively distant, multi-day trip I took without a parent or guardian the entire time (I.E. not during travel, nor at my destination).  The fact that we were a group of rowdy teenagers only helped make it more fun for us (and probably a nightmare for everyone around us).<br>  <br>  I'm pretty tame, but some of my classmates were a bit out of control.  (Was the drinking age 16 in Quebec, back then?  It's 18 now, regardless.)  We had no problems buying alcohol, that's for sure.<br>  <br>  I think you should do it, if you can afford it.  When we went, it was winter (it was a ski trip), and a huge snowstorm blew into town as we were about to leave, and had to spend another night in the hotel...more meals...etc.  So make sure you have some emergency money, beyond what you think you'll need.

fbKVq6Znaa	awesome im a NYer too but ive lived in la most of my teen years. august is def. the best time to visit la because the weather is perfect and the atmosphere is so serene (from a NY perspective of course). last year my friends and i went to the Love Festival for the first time and it was insanely fun. this year its august 15th so you should buy tickets if you are going to be here<br>  <br>  i love melrose and abbot kinney. they are full of character and art and it just has such a complet la-vibe without all the tourist BS. other great places to shop are the grove, 3rd street, the americana, the fashion district in downtown, beverly hills/ west la area, and old town pasadena if you and your friend are interested in art you should go to the Getty, MOMA, and you cant leave without checking out the Zorthian ranch. i dont know if they still let the public visit but its an amazing art ranch located up in altadena/ pasadena away from like hollywood and all the other places people are expected to go when they come here. i seriously think its one of our best kept secrets. last summer i got to meet Ashton Kutcher because he was up there for a photo shoot with model Daria Werbowy for a Pepe Jeans ad. Panic! at the disco, Twiggy, and Hugh Hefner have also been up there.<br>  <br>  if you do visit the zorthian ranch you should also go to the Huntington gardens in San Marino and have tea. Its such a lovely place and the food is sooooo good. Old town pasadena is also in that area and its great for shopping and there are a couple movie theatres there.<br>  <br>  as for night clubs you can never go wrong. i turned 18 a few months ago and have been hitting a few up. most of the popular ones are in hollywood. some of my favorites are Ketchup, The velvet margarita, L'scorpion, the stinking rose, and Les Deux. I dont think this is a club but Equator in pasadena serves really good hookah, amazing food, and the decor is so perfect. i went there a few weeks ago with friends and it was so nice. my friends and i also live for sushi and idk if thats your thing and i know they have a katsuya and tokyo wako in NY but you should still go if you havent already and occasionally you bump into a celeb at katsuya because it is one of the best sushi restaurants around. there are also raves pretty much every weekend but the really fun ones are mainly underground and youve got to get all the details from a local who is heading to one on the night you want to go. but you can always just google and find out other ones which arent more than like 15 bucks at the door.<br>  <br>  good luck! hope you have fun here. if you have any more questions feel free to email|`|ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	Believe it or not, we share space with tourists. The ObviousFamily goes to Disneyland, since we live close by. We hang out at Downtown Disney. Our kids go to the Block at Orange. Sometimes we go to City Walk. We know friends who have passes to Knott's. In summer, we go to the beach if we don't want to go to Disneyland. Our surfing friends have their favorite spots like Beacons, Trestles, or Rincon. <br>  <br>  I'm not so much into the local nightclub scene, but check out metromix.com for that.<br>  <br>  There are literally hundreds of things to do here in LA. Here is my list of “must sees”. Visit as many as you have time for.:<br>  <br>  Disneyland: The Happiest Place on Earth. Half a billion visitors can’t be wrong. #1 Destination in SoCal.<br>  Universal Studios: A theme park that grew out of a studio tour. #2 Destination<br>  Even if you don’t visit Disneyland or Universal Studios Tour, Downtown Disney District and Universal City Walk are very fun places to visit for shopping and eating. And they’re free to visit. <br>  <br>  Hollywood: Enjoy the Walk of Fame, Entertainment Museum, Chinese Theater and more. You can see a lot for free. The Hollywood & Highland complex is AMAZING. It has lots of shops and restaurants, and the Kodak Theater (home of the Academy Awards). I also like the El Capitan theater, right across the street. And the Hollywood Bowl is a GREAT place to listen to concerts outdoors. <br>  <br>  Rodeo Drive, 90210: Packed with exclusive shops, full of gawkers. They all came to enjoy the excess. Free, unless you intend to buy something.<br>  <br>  Venice Beach: Los Angeles kitsch and over-the-top culture at its best. Here you'll find Muscle Beach, street performers and tacky shops galore. Fun, VERY interesting, but I avoid it after dark, when it gets a little TOO interesting for my taste. <br>  <br>  Santa Monica Beach and Pier: Great beach scene and a classic seaside amusement park, complete with antique carousel that has been in a lot of TV and movies. <br>  <br>  Santa Monica Third Street Promenade - Downtown Santa Monica's shopping promenade is often the scene of movie star-sightings. <br>  <br>  Sunset Boulevard: Perhaps one of the world's most famous streets, it began as a route between the stars' posh neighborhoods and the Hollywood studios. It runs from downtown to the ocean, passing through the "Sunset Strip" on its way. It makes for a fun drive. When you get to the ocean, stop at Gladstone's for Fish.<br>  <br>  Queen Mary: Once the largest ship afloat, she's been docked in Long Beach for longer than she sailed, and her elegance never fails to impress. Free to visit. You can actually stay on board, for a price.<br>  <br>  Farmers Market and The Grove - A new shopping complex right next to a Los Angeles landmark, The Grove and Farmers Market coexist. Enjoy a movie or shopping, and then take the trolley to the Farmers Market for lunch or dinner. It is right next to CBS, so walk across the lot to see if they are taping "The Price is Right". You might even get in.<br>  <br>  TAAB: The Americana at Brand- The newly opened TAAB, developed by the same group that gave us The Grove, breathes new life into Glendale, and gives all those hip people in Eagle Rock and the eastern half of LA a great place to go. <br>  <br>  Griffith Park - Home of the Los Angeles Zoo, Griffith Park Observatory, Travel Town, the Greek Theatre, and Gene Autry Museum of Western Heritage.<br>  <br>  Getty Museum - The Getty's architecture is so beautiful that it keeps me fascinated. No matter whether you like their art or architecture better (or maybe you'll just enjoy the view), the Getty is sure to please. Free.<br>  <br>  Attend a TV taping - You can get free tickets at audiencesunlimited.com, tvtix.com, or see the booth at Universal City walk. It's very interesting to see a show being taped. The most popular, by far, is the Tonight show with Jay Leno. Check the NBC web site for all the details there.<br>  <br>  Places to eat:<br>  In-N-Out Burger: Multiple locations, best burger in LA, ask anyone.<br>  Pink’s Hot Dogs: 709 N. La Brea, just north of Melrose. You might even see a celebrity. Maybe.<br>  Tommy’s Chili Burgers: Look for the shack, an LA tradition. The original location is at Beverly & Rampart, a couple miles west of downtown.<br>  Canter’s Deli: 419 N. Fairfax, between Beverly & Melrose. Near CBS, you might spot a celebrity.<br>  Phillippe’s: 1001 N. Alameda. Great roast beef sandwiches. Near Union Station and Olvera Street. Watch the mustard, it’s hot.<br>  The Pantry: Corner of Figueroa and 9th, downtown. Huge portions, they never close, GREAT steak and eggs.<br>  <br>  Places to Stay:<br>  Since LA is so spread out, there is no single place that is close to EVERYTHING. Most people who come here tend to stay in Hollywood, Santa Monica, or Anaheim.<br>  In Hollywood, I recommend the Renaissance Hotel at Hollywood and Highland, the Best Western Sunset Plaza, or the Holiday Inn Walk of Fame. <br>  In Santa Monica, the Holiday Inn Santa Monica is close to the pier and reasonably priced.<br>  In Anaheim, I recommend the Howard Johnson (HoJo) Anaheim, and the Candy Cane Inn.<br>  <br>  Places to Shop:<br>  Third Street Promenade, Santa Monica<br>  The Grove, Los Angeles<br>  Americana @ Brand, Glendale<br>  Beverly Center, Los Angeles<br>  Citadel Outlets, Commerce<br>  Brea Mall, Brea<br>  The Block at Orange, Orange<br>  South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa<br>  Fashion Island, Newport Beach<br>  Santee Alley, Los Angeles|`|P5rfNdFEaa	Citywalk in hollywood and the block at orange is where the locals hangout.

jek0fdTfaa	Toronto has a semi-continental climate, with a warm, humid summer and a cold winter. <br>  <br>  Toronto's climate is modified by its location on the shores of Lake Ontario. The water in the lake ensures Toronto is warmer in winter and cooler in summer than it would otherwise be. The Great Lakes location is also the source of Toronto's summer humidity, which many people find uncomfortable. <br>  <br>  Although Toronto is one of Canada's warmer cities in winter, winters are still severe, with snow on the ground most days between mid-December and mid-March.<br>  <br>  Please see link for monthly averages.|`|8a2ebc183110448f4c3847d3aa539174aa	It will still be quite cold in mid-March.

dai4nP0yaa	Public transport is probably easiest because finding space to park in A'dam can be a nightmare. <br>  <br>  The easiest was is probably to take a train from Utrecht Centraal (If you don't know how to get there take bus 11) to Amsterdam Central. <br>  <br>  From Amsterdam Centraal, take tram 5 or take bus 172 or 170 to Hobbemastraat. From there it's a 3 minute walk. Just follow the map: <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=hobbemastraat&daddr=stadhouderskade+25&hl=en&geocode=&mra=ls&dirflg=w&sll=52.362688,4.881588&sspn=0.003859,0.00692&ie=UTF8&ll=52.360814,4.882811&spn=0.003859,0.00692&z=17&iwloc=lyrftr:w2.92,0x47c609eee2bd710d:0x7ad86dc49ba6f594,52.359897,4.883358" rel="nofollow">http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s...</a>|`|WawPounraa	go to utrecht central train station, buy a ticket to amsterdam centraal station..take tram to your hotel|`|zBWefnYHaa	You already have a good answer for public transport.<br>  No, I do not recommend to rent a car.<br>  Firstly, neither Utrecht nor Amsterdam are car friendly cities, parking in Amsterdam is always expensive and mostly a nightmare to find a parking place.<br>  <br>  In Utrecht it is about 15 minutes by bus, the bus runs regularly, about each 15 minutes.<br>  The trains to Amsterdam also run each 15 minutes, and take about 30 minutes.<br>  In Amsterdam you have several options, you can either leave the train at Amsterdam Amstel station and take tram 12, taking between 1:10 and 1:20 hours.<br>  Or you can travel on to Amsterdam Centraal station, and take tram 16.<br>  Travel this way takes 1:20 hour, and costs less than €10 if you buy a strippenkaart before traveling. (Using the other station may save you €0.20, not worth it, I think.)<br>  <br>  If you are not familiar with public transport, you can travel by taxi to the station, but that will add about €30 to your costs. But most likely still much cheaper than traveling by rental car.

F6lZHRkVaa	Prague has become a tourist hot spot, it's very busy these days. I've been there twice in 2003 and again in 2007. The first time it was more low key, the second time it was busy. If you're going in the summer, it will be even more busy.<br>  <br>  All of the main sites are in the historic city center, you can pick up a walking tour and cover everything in one day. And then spend the rest of your days going back to places you really want to see more in depth.<br>  <br>  Your best bet to get away from the crowds would be to go to the Zizkov, Dejvice and Vinohrady neighborhoods. They're off the beaten track so most tourists don't go there.<br>  <br>  Prague is very safe, just be aware of people who linger too close to you.

2EVoNHHbaa	At the end of World War II, when the United Nations was formed, it wasn't clear where it should be housed.  The League of Nations, which had largely failed and had been disbanded, had been in Switzerland.  The US, which emerged from World War II as a major international player, was an obvious choice.  New York City offered up a tract of land on the East River, and the decision was made to build the UN Headquarters there.  Be aware, though, that the UN has many secondary buildings, including in Geneva and other cities, where much of its work is carried out.<br>  <br>  This wikipedia article will tell you more:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_headquarters" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nati...</a>|`|1be40c12a77f6c00d5dfd80e2c986569aa	because of the laws in the USA, the people from the different consulates can illegally park, and not pay property taxes and NYC can't do anything to collect the 100's of millions that they are owed.|`|lqXmvJdRaa	East River at the end of 42nd Street

tV7ZYIeEaa	On the DC website if you book early and depending on seasons they do have discounts you just have to keep checking for them.|`|lMJBaacxaa	There are a bunch of places that give you deals on tickets. Sometimes you can find these places in or near gas stations or in little buildings that advertise this. I remember seeing a whole bunch of them in July there in Orlando. In fact, we got all of our tickets from there and saved like $200. And the tickets were not fake or anything, because we were able to get in with them. Also, they were able to give us a 14 day pass to Wet'n Wild, which we spent almost our whole vacation. It was awesome and they had pretty cool rides. Check it out one day when possible. Well, I wish you the best and God bless.

s2IOyj8iaa	New Zealand has 4 seasons and all are very noticeable. The rain fall is high . November through to april is my choice for going . November is very nice as The snow capped mountains still look beautiful the lambs are frollicking and the weather is warming up for the summer . English is spoken through out,  the main language, but they also have a  lot of maori spoken. You will find the people friendly and helpful. Many nationalities live there. It is a low crime country but still one needs to be sensible as everywhere in the world one doesn't put temptation in the way of criminals. The scenery is beautiful many national parks lakes rivers mountains thermal areas and some beautiful Coast. You can roll around in the long grass and have no fear of snakes one of the few  countries without snakes.Wonderful fresh food the fish is super try the fish and chips Mmmm and the pinky bars [a choc caramel marshmallow bar] The air is fresh and good .

His classic work "The Zionist Connection"  was published  in 1978; all his books appeared from mainstream presses despite heated protests from jewish groups.

Rosenfeld in his much discussed essay, Progressive Jewish Thought and the New Anti-Semitism, claims that a "number of Jews, through their speaking and writing, are feeding a rise in virulent antisemitism by questioning whether Israel should even exist." So, there are Jews who oppose Zionism and they are loud enough for people like Alvin H. Rosenfeld to be alarmed.<br>  <br>  Brian Klug <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Klug" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Klug</a> has argued that anti-Zionism and antisemitism are distinct concepts:<br>  <br>  "Since anti-Zionism is the opposite of Zionism, and since Zionism is a form of opposition to anti-Semitism, it seems to follow that an anti-Zionist must be an anti-Semite. Nonetheless, the inference is invalid. To argue that hostility to Israel and hostility to Jews are one and the same thing is to conflate the Jewish state with the Jewish people. In fact, Israel is one thing, Jewry another. Accordingly, anti-Zionism is one thing, anti-Semitism another. They are separate. To say they are separate is not to say that they are never connected. But they are independent variables that can be connected in different ways."<br>  <br>  <br>  Professor Robert S. Wistrich (head of the Vidal Sassoon International Center for the Study of Antisemitism) at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem believes that Anti-Zionism is not inherently anti-Semitic and that anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism are two distinct ideologies that over time (especially since 1948) have tended to converge, generally without undergoing a full merger. <br>  <br>  European Jews for a Just Peace, an association of Western European Jewish peace organisations, are more forthright in rejecting the association of anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism: Legitimate criticism of Israel, based on its policies against the Palestinian population in the Occupied Palestinian Territories as well as inside Israel cannot be called anti-Semitic. Such an accusation deliberately mis-uses the term, aimed at awakening fear of anti-Semitism, rather than diminishing it. It would represent the silencing of freedom of speech.<br>  <br>  <br>  In the early history of Zionism many traditional religious Jews opposed ideas of nationalism. Key traditionalist opponents of Zionism included Isaac Breuer, Hillel Zeitlin, Aaron Shmuel Tamares, Hayyim, Elazar Shapiro (Muncatz), and Joel Teitelbaum, all waged ideological religious, as well as political, battles with Zionism each in their own way. Most Orthodox religious groups have come to accept the State of Israel, even if they have not adopted "Zionist" ideology. The main exception are the Satmar Hasidim, which has fewer than 130,000 adherents world wide. Even more strongly opposed to Zionism is the small Haredi Jewish organization known as Neturei Karta, which has less than 5,000 members, almost all of whom live in Israel and Palestine. Noam Chomsky, reports a change in the boundaries of what are considered Zionist and anti-Zionist views. In 1947, in his youth, Chomsky's support for a socialist binational state, in conjunction with his opposition to any semblance of a theocratic system of governance in Israel, was at the time considered well within the mainstream of secular Zionism; today, it lands him solidly in the anti-Zionist camp. Anti Zionist Jewish organizations in the west include, A Different Jewish Voice (Een Ander Joods Geluid - EAJG) (The Netherlands), Union des Progressistes Juifs de Belgique – UPJB (Belgium), Jewish Socialists' Group (United Kingdom), Jews for Justice for Palestinians - JFJFP (United Kingdom), Jüdische Stimme fur einen gerechten Frieden zwischen Isra?l und Palastina (Switzerland), Jews for Israeli-Palestinian Peace (Sweden), Union Juive Francaise pour la paix - UJFP (France), Network of Jews Against Occupation (Rete 'Ebrei contro l'occupazione, Rete ECO) (Italy), Jewish Voice for a Just Peace in the Near East (Jüdische Stimme für einen gerechten Frieden in Nahost) (Austria), Jewish Voice for a Just Peace in Middle East (Jüdische Stimme für gerechten Frieden in Nahost) (Germany), EJJP Denmark, Not in my name (USA).|`|b8ae5eef3b2d61ecb71b1965967306bcaa	You can find individual Jews who worship Jesus or worship Mohammed or do not believe in G-D, so to hear that a Jew is against Israel does not shock me. It reminds me of a visit we paid to a mental hospital when I was in college studying psychology. There was a patient there who thought that he was Napoleon. That does not mean he was Napoleon. He just believed that he was. If a Jew is anti-G-D or anti-Zionist (same thing, really), that makes his beliefs outside Judaism, but does not turn him into a non-Jew.|`|DEglvDGDaa	I think against the state of Israel is a very sweeping statement.<br>  <br>  Of course it is possible to be something but oppose the policies of the current govt right or wrongly but that is where te state of Israel comes to its own in the middle east.<br>  <br>  I can think of no other country in that area where people are free to state their opinions, where people can believe what they choose, where a woman is not held back by gender or religion.<br>  <br>  Israel should be looked at as an oasis of the middle east, <br>  <br>  My eyes are not clouded I am British and not Jewish and in fact my grandfather served in the Argylls and lost friends in Israel in the late forties.<br>  <br>  All Israel wants to do is exist in peace, and of course Israel is string militarily it has to be for it's survival and the survival of its people.<br>  <br>  But the difference is Israel does not buy arms instead of food or medicine, <br>  <br>  People really need to study Israel, Its people and its situation instead of making assumptions and judgements<br>  <br>  And although the majority of the population is Israel is Jewish there are a significant numbers of christians etc, and they live as they should as free equal citizens of Israel, How many other countries in the middle east afford they same rights to all regardless of religion or gender, the answer is 0|`|Fb519XJgaa	Yes most intellectual Jews are against the state of Israel collective punishments of the people of Palestine.
AA10640608	If you don't want to look like a tourist do not wear jeans. You don't have to dress to the nines and should be comfortable but most New Yorkers dress nicely for a play. Nice pants & top with flats are fine.|`|dgRTkccBaa	It doesn't really matter, if you're out sight seeing all day before you can just wear whatever you have on.  The theater is dark and people will be looking a the show.  If you're going out to eat or for drinks before/after just dress for that.  You'll see people dressed in all styles.|`|KR9j86Hcaa	Sadly, the theater is no longer a 'dressy' affair for most people. You will see most everything worn at the theater these days. For matinees, ceratinly more casual attire is acceptable. For Friday and Saturday, evenings expect to see more folks dressing up. Since NYC is such a walking city, flats are also acceptable.<br>  The bottom line is - wear what you want. Dress to impress if you desire - it's a great opportunity! Most of all - enjoy the show!|`|1FPpglMpaa	you can wear anything you want.  there is no dress code.  unless you are going to eat somewhere nice before or after, you can wear jeans.|`|b70db8774399b2892a627c38594d1c94aa	jewerly|`|UM9LlPWDaa	Casual dress with heals.

siHN027laa	My niece lives in Tijuana and their car was stolen right off the main street in downtown area.<br>  First of all, I wouldn't even think of going to TJ today.<br>  If they're in Vegas, why go to TJ in the first place?<br>  If they want sex, they can get it in NV.<br>  If they are of legal drinking age (and they are) it's a lot safer drinking in a NV casino than in TJ. <br>  If they MUST go, leave the car(s) on the U.S. side. That's safer and you don't need to get MX Car Insurance or fight the crazy TJ traffic.<br>  I was almost hit broadside down there by a bus that ran a red light!!! Very close call....<br>  If they MUST go to MX, try Tecate (a little east). It's quieter, more tranquil and is a bit more safer.<br>  For even more fun and games, try Mexicali. (That's the capitol for Baja North and just across the border from Calexico, CA).<br>  There's only a few reasons why  two young men want to go to TJ. None of them is to be benefit their health or safety. They jeopardize both when they cross the border.  Especially if they don't even have a rudimentary knowledge of the languarge.<br>  So, the first question they need to answer honestly...WHY do they want to go?<br>  It would be much better to save some money and spend a mini-vacation flying to Cabo, Mazatlan or Puerto Vallarta.<br>  Much safer, more things to do.<br>  But get another opinion.<br>  You might ask your question on a website dedicated to Baja.<br>  Go to<br>  www.bajanomad.com<br>  and ask your question there. Replies give current driving conditions, affairs, safety hints, highway conditions, threats, etc and are posted by travelers to and from Baja or by those that actually live there.|`|sEihaeLNaa	well i am mexican and i wont even go over there. Its dangerouse out there especially because they like kidnapping people. Just tell them to be safe and dont flash any money or jewlry. and dont get too drunk and watch eachothers backs. Oh yeah and there is a lot of pretty prostitutes over there so if i were you I would go with him.|`|IHtQxfGEaa	I've been to Tijuana twice. It was 3 of us women. We felt safer staying on the main strip of Tijuana. There are lots & lots of little side streets. We don't drink so we had no desire to find the bars. I'd say, yes, definitely worry about where you park, where you walk to & be aware of your surroundings. I'd suggest if they are going to be drinking stay in an area that is well lighted & surrounded by other people...don't go wandering around looking for other places to drink.<br>  I haven't been to other places in Mexico so I can't suggest anything about that.<br>  I hope your boyfriend & his friend stay safe & have a good time.|`|DC4Civrvaa	My brother drives down to Rosarito all the time.  They have a Papas & Beer there I think.  A lot of people from California go there. Especially on the weekends.  TJ too.  They should be ok.  Just tell them to be very careful driving because the drivers over there are NUTS!  I was very lucky for a long time but eventually my luck ran out and some idiot hit my van trying to pass me on the left when I was making a left hand turn! OMG some people...lol|`|yz0cx103aa	its only unsafe if you are in the drug bussiness. I know because living near border just carry a cell phone and be careful|`|OURb1rnTaa	Not safe! Enough said!|`|AHpzpRieaa	Advise them to stay only in the touristy areas, not bring too much money and not get too drunk, excercise caution, etc. Usually tourist areas should be safe because people involved in the tourist industry will try to keep them that way so they have customers.<br>  <br>  If they can go somewhere else, I'd say come to Ensenada (1 and a half hour drive from the border), there is drinking and partying here but it is MUCH SAFER than Tijuana.|`|zeKfIISoaa	it is best to park in a secured parking area once they cross the boarder.  You don't need to really know Spanish to communicate in Tijuana...a lot of service guys go over there.  I have not gone there since the mid-80, but I drank and danced several nights away in TJ during my younger years.  They really need to be safe and parked in secured place (and yes, I am repeating myself here)...getting stone drunk there is never a great idea, but if they are aware of their surroundings and stay to main strip...they should be fine.

I was attracted to his many differences.We have now been together for more then 35 years.<br>  We bought a flat in Budapest and are looking forward to retiring there very soon.<br>  I feel so alive in Europe, a feeling I have only had in the states while living in NY.<br>  I can't wait to go outside everyday and be out and about with the masses.<br>  The language issue is sort of difficult but if you are young, most people under age 30 speak English. I am older so I have a harder time making friends.<br>  They love Irish dancing in Hungary believe it or not. There are also many ex-pat Irish in Hungary.<br>  Jobs are a major down side in Hungary.

UzPFTdUFaa	Of course its possible and contrary to the comments above we have beautiful areas of unspoilt countryside even in south east England - the Surrey Hills,Chiltern Hills,Sussex Weald,South Downs etc. Britain is a hikers paradise with more public footpaths (hiking trails) than any other country in the world plus large numbersf of National Parks. Ordnance Survey Landranger maps show the country in great detail www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk. I do think your trip needs good planning to make it successful however. The book the 'Rough Guide to Britain' might be a good starting point.|`|AA11349530	I guess theoretically it's possible ... but in some parts of the country it's going to be difficult because of the urban sprawl, for instance in the south east and in the midlands, where one town/city merges into another leaving very little room in between ... also how are you going to be travelling? ... if you're hiking you'll be OK but if you plan on using public transport it more often than not means you've got to transit via a city to get to another form of transport (bus, train or whatever)<br>  <br>  there are some beautiful parts of the country for camping in ... the southwest Cornwall and Devon ... the Lake District ... Yorks moors ... the borders between England and Scotland ... Wales ... and so many more<br>  <br>  and contrary to the other answerer the whole of the UK is not populated by solely by chavs ... there's some really nice friendly kind people|`|8bb7564e6b51f403a948dbb1465c7692aa	And campsites in the UK are so much more expensive than in the rest of Europe. The UK is not the best place to be backpacking around. The population density is quite high so you find traffic jams are often happening in the middle of the countryside, i knwo that sounds amazing but it is true.<br>  One of the reasons for that is that public transports are so expensive that it is much cheaper to travel by car.<br>  It is shitty country honestly, the poor are chavs and tarts and the middle class pretend to be like the aristocracy andare obsessed by material things and by speculating on houses (less and less though) and they are ridiculous. + people never tell you what they think. If they don't like you they will moan and plot behind your back.|`|b8tgCAQJaa	It's certainly possible, and if you stay well away from the large urban areas (especially the densely populated South East of England) you may find it very pleasant indeed.|`|xVMQx7dtaa	It is possible but you wouldn't have a great time lol (The weather is sh*t)

0aXRDfOLaa	Well I'm French and I don't really know what to answer...<br>  French people find beautiful the same things than other people from similar cultures like Western-European and American cultures. <br>  <br>  I think our only difference with the anglo-saxon people is culinary, but it's the case with all Europe. French people (like for example Spanish people and Italian people) prefers a better food with better products and more diversity than English-American food which is appreciated but not everyday and mostly when we are in a hurry. (About the clichés, I've NEVER seen frogs in a restaurant but I saw some people eat snails, but it's really rare and is a European thing, not a French thing. By the way, the English eat eels at breakfast and are know in Europe to have the worst food of all Europeans countries (sorry guys, it's the truth xD) and Americans like peanut-butter (wonder why the only europeans that like peanut-butter are english ?)!!! lol !)<br>  <br>  About art, style and fashion, France is one of the leading countries and has a great influcence on the rest of the world, so we like the same things than other countries.<br>  <br>  In music, we like very much English and American music (who doesn't ?). French music follow the same rules than the others but doesn't export because only Anglo-saxon music spread over the world, but is quite active.<br>  <br>  In cinema, the French will like all types of films but French films are generally intellectual (and boring xD).<br>  <br>  We prefer "small" cars than big HUMMERs but we just love German cars like BMW, Mercedes and Audi (again, who doesn't ?).<br>  <br>  My answer is that you can't see 60 millions of French as a single person, because everyone is different, and because French people has a culture very close the Western-European/American culture.|`|0hSs6CtHaa	The French find destroying their culture and their way of life by means of over-immigration and multicultural-fanaticism to be very beautiful!|`|4nEErhXmaa	Start with food as beauty. <br>  Look up Angelina's Chocolates (by the Louvre) if you want to see amazing beauty.<br>  Look for a picture of "Le Tren Bleu" (Mr. Bean ate the lobster there) it is a truly beautiful place to dine.<br>  Then just look at any perfume photo/advertisement it will be French. Also, any Champagne will by definition be French, and most likely beautiful. <br>  <br>  Finally; French find Fashion amazing, fleeting, and beautiful.
2Ta73Ejtaa	I am stunned. I can't believe the fine and demerit points would be so high. I was fined some years ago (NZ not Australia) for not stopping long enough. I admit I just slowed down to a quick pause and took off because there was nothing coming.

0fW76gB8aa	Most Palestinians have no reasonable excuse for entering Israel. For a Palestinian to be allowed to enter Israel, he or she needs permission from the Government, just like you need permission from the government of any country to enter the country.<br>  <br>  The Israeli Government allows Palestinians to come to Israel if they have legitimate reasons, such as obtaining medical treatment. <br>  <br>  In the past, many Palestinians came to Israel every day to work, however, today, very few do this, because too many people were entering Israel claiming they were doing so to work, then carrying out terrorist attacks.<br>  <br>  The security barrier and checkpoints have been set up as a response to the thousands of deadly terrorist attacks carried out by Arab terrorist organizations such as Hamas, Fatah, Islamic Jihad, Hezbollah and the PFLP.<br>  <br>  The security barrier was set up to prevent suicide bombers from crossing directly into Israel. Now to get into Israel you need to clear a checkpoint. This system has led to a massive reduction in suicide bombings in Israel.|`|74RNHyxHaa	The state of Israel is actually the Land of Palestine, so I would think that the Palestinians should have the right to enter their own land.

From their booming sex slave market, to THEIR terrorism in the middle east, to their manipulation of our politicians through groups like AIPAC (check it out).

The Palestinians are a source of cheap labor.|`|IDIM1Qoeaa	As the periodic bloodshed continues in the Middle East, the search for an equitable solution must come to grips with the root cause of the conflict. The conventional wisdom is that, even if both sides are at fault, the Palestinians are irrational “terrorists” who have no point of view worth listening to. Our position, however, is that the Palestinians have a real grievance: their homeland for over a thousand years was taken, without their consent and mostly by force, during the creation of the state of Israel. And all subsequent crimes — on both sides — inevitably follow from this original injustice.The standard Zionist position is that they showed up in Palestine in the late 19th century to reclaim their ancestral homeland. Jews bought land and started building up the Jewish community there. They were met with increasingly violent opposition from the Palestinian Arabs, presumably stemming from the Arabs’ inherent anti-Semitism. The Zionists were then forced to defend themselves and, in one form or another, this same situation continues up to today.<br>  The problem with this explanation is that it is simply not true, as the documentary evidence in this booklet will show. What really happened was that the Zionist movement, from the beginning, looked forward to a practically complete dispossession of the indigenous Arab population so that Israel could be a wholly Jewish state, or as much as was possible. Land bought by the Jewish National Fund was held in the name of the Jewish people and could never be sold or even leased back to Arabs (a situation which continues to the present).<br>  The Arab community, as it became increasingly aware of the Zionists’ intentions, strenuously opposed further Jewish immigration and land buying because it posed a real and imminent danger to the very existence of Arab society in Palestine. Because of this opposition, the entire Zionist project never could have been realized without the military backing of the British. The vast majority of the population of Palestine, by the way, had been Arabic since the seventh century A.D. (Over 1200 years)<br>  In short, Zionism was based on a faulty, colonialist world view that the rights of the indigenous inhabitants didn’t matter. The Arabs’ opposition to Zionism wasn’t based on anti-Semitism but rather on a totally reasonable fear of the dispossession of their people.|`|456d68efa2a1d62c7af67d47f76d8bf0aa	Because certain places in Israel are holy and considered sacred to muslims - Jerusalem in particular.<br>  <br>  From Wikipedia: "The city has a history that goes back to the 4th millennium BCE, making it one of the oldest cities in the world.[5] Jerusalem has been the holiest city in Judaism and the spiritual center of the Jewish people since the 10th century BCE,[6] contains a number of significant ancient Christian sites, and is considered the third-holiest city in Islam.[7] Despite having an area of only 0.9 square kilometer (0.35 square mile),[8] the Old City is home to sites of key religious importance, among them the Temple Mount, the Western Wall, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa Mosque. The old walled city, a World Heritage site, has been traditionally divided into four quarters, although the names used today — the Armenian, Christian, Jewish, and Muslim Quarters — were introduced in the early 19th century.[9] "|`|FcH2ZEkqaa	Why is it necessary for Canadians to enter America and Americans to enter Canada?

lcj1AKt1aa	Yes the Turks and Caicos consist of 40 different islands and cays, only 8 of which are inhabited. The islands of the Turks and Caicos are almost as diverse as its people. From the main tourist center of Providenciales to the quiet and tranquil islands of North and Middle Caicos to the historic Capital Island of Grand Turk; each one offers a different experience and a unique character but all offer year round great climate, beaches and underwater activities.<br>  <br>  The only true way to experience the Turks and Caicos Islands is to experience each island in the entire chain. This is probably why most of the visitors come back to the Turks and Caicos on a regular basis. You can read about each of the islands here and maybe pick a few to see on your vacation either for daytrips, or longer stays.<br>  <br>  Most of the islands are only about 10 to 25 minutes by air from Provo and most can be reached by boat, too. There are also regular ferries from North to Middle Caicos.<br>  <br>  Providenciales is the most well known of the Turks and Caicos Islands and is the center of the tourism industry with a wide range of hotels, restaurants, attractions and facilities.<br>  <br>  Grand Turk and Salt Cay offer a glimpse into Caribbean history with great Bermudian architecture and a rustic charm as well as some of the best diving and probably the most "relaxing" time you will ever have. Grand Turk is also home to a brand new cruise ship center.<br>  <br>  Middle Caicos and North Caicos represent the best of the environment, with lush green woodlands, the biggest cave network in the Caribbean on Middle Caicos, cottage pond and flamingo pond in North Caicos and a vast range of plant life and birdlife. North Caicos is also an up and coming resort destination with several new projects under development.|`|CpJnhy1saa	The country is called Turks and Caicos. One of the islands is Grand Turk.

Featuring fifteen slides, a surfing-themed AquaPlay area called Calypso Beach, several swimming pools and a wave pool. It also has floor to ceiling windows offering views of the Falls. You can also enter to win a family waterpark getaway, buy tickets or find more info by clicking here.  <br>    <br>  The Bird Aviary on the Canadian side of the river is beautiful. An interesting mix of exotic birds in a rainforest setting is a pleasure for all age groups.<br>   <br>   This years entertainment schedule brings a host of top talent from around the country. The Seneca Casino in Niagara Falls New York will be offering great performances from top names like Steve Winwood, The Doobie Brothers and Julio Iglesias. The Fallsview Casino in Niagara Falls Canada has booked Three Dog Night, Johnny Mathis and Chicago. You can reserve tickets and find more entertainment listings through our Casino links.     <br>    <br>  If we could recommend any one attraction that is a "must try" during the tourist season we would have to recommend the Whirlpool Jetboat Tours. It's truly a one of kind adventure for everyone. If you don't mind getting soaking wet, it's better than any e-ticket ride at Disney. And if you don't want to get wet, they now offer the "Jet Dome" for those looking for a more relaxed site seeing tour on the Niagara River. <br>    <br>  info@niagarafallslive.com|`|Waj5VTtVaa	You should go onto the Clifton Hill website!

You might be able to figure that out through the site, you might have to go into the programs directly to figure that out.<br>  <br>  Yes, there are programs that go for anything from a couple of weeks to the full year.  I, personally knew a bunch of people who did the summer program when I was a student, and I know there are a number of programs that bring kids here, and I have worked with, for summer exchanges.  <br>  <br>  I, personally, have good experience with CIEE (Not sure if they do high school) and YFU, and Sister Cities...if your town has a Sister City that you would like to go to.

NK3VJgiRaa	Hello. I would actually suggest Puerto Rico for you. Old San Juan is a beautiful historic city. There is so much to see & do, plus beaches! And it is actually pretty safe, especially compared to some other islands. It's one of the better off islands because its a US territory, so there arent tons of people begging you to buy something & the water & food are safe to consume. And you can see a 500+ year old fortress called El Morro. There are tons of historic govt buildings & cathedrals. There are even indian parks where the tainos resided thousands of years ago.<br>  <br>  Out of Cuba or Dominican Republic, I would probably choose Cuba. I am american so I never been there, but Havana seems to be a beautiful city. I have been to DR. It is very nice, but if you want nice beaches you will need to stay somewhere like Punta Cana (which is similar to Cancun- beach & tourists, but thats it). But for the history you will need to go to Santo Domingo, which is pretty far away. Also it's not the safest city for a female travelling alone. <br>  <br>   Check out the links below.

In many cases according to the nature of the person, policy of his country with Egyptians and nature of the visit, they may let him pass with no problem.

6cd9378345537eb8284901f4450b9b0faa	Let them know it may be your last time talking to them.  As time past, storms continue to get worst.  Katrina affected New Orleans because of the levy breach.  Rita came in and tore up many areas.  Rita's storm surge had water higher than street signs, drowning cows, horses, and many other agriculture.  Ike was a water storm that just sat over Galveston and was over 600 miles wide.  It didn't miss anything.  It was so much inland my friend in Houston nearly lost her house while she was in it.  Storms are getting much worse.  Tell them save themselves and don't follow them but pray hard they change their minds.  Just listen to the local weather channel and LISTEN.  Leave when they say leave.|`|L6ILAJ3Baa	Really, I do not blame them for not leaving.  I have been living down here all my life, and most of the times these hurricanes do not do too much damage to actually leave. So, yeah I don't blame them.|`|BblFLX44aa	This is the last time I may talk to you, and if you get stuck on the roof of your house while flood waters rise, you have no right to blame anyone but yourself|`|O1PpybX0aa	alert the whole sociesty or community .<br>  call the police|`|ef4b0b9eb5f80f99b4a112e5e254c3d2aa	its there life there house wat the f u gotta do|`|VxfyQZ2jaa	There is a lot of misinformation about New Orleans during Katrina and probably the worst bit is the idea that no one left because we were all too stupid, lazy, or welfare-dependent to evacuate.<br>  <br>  Reality was that about 95% of the metro area's population (1,400,000 in 2005) was able to leave before Katrina hit.<br>  <br>  The people who didn't leave almost always stayed because they didn't have the money to evacuate.  You have to pay for transportation, stay in hotels and eat in restaurants when you evacuate, which is very expensive (no, the government didn't pay for anything before the storm wrecked the city). <br>  <br>  About half of the 5% who didn't leave went to the Superdome (the designated shelter).<br>  However, the Dome is a building without windows and was not designed to be occupied when the utilities are off.  It had been used as a shelter before and it was well known that conditions inside become very unpleasant once the electricity fails. It wasn't as bad as being trapped by flood water but that is using 20/20 hindshight.<br>  <br>  Everything was better for Hurricane Gustav in 2008 and there were places for poor people to go.  They did take advantage of the evacuation assistance and almost no one failed to leave for Gustav.

If the person  who previously answered (and you know yourself) never left her hotel grounds then how would you know just how safe Jamaica is? And just to remind you the question was not only asking of safety. For the person who lived there for 2 1/2 years if it was so terrible why did you live there for that long? I live in Canada and my 13 yr old cousin was shot in her face on the public transit, and though that was a horrible experience I would not say that Canada is a terrible place to visit.<br>  <br>  Jamaica is wonderful overall but the place I would best recommend is Negril or Ocho Rios. There is alot of entertainment on and off the Hotel grounds and the food and night life is simply amazing. My personal fave is Negril.|`|UBxKqdPwaa	There is no place in Jamaica that is safe.

R76ema39aa	If this was wall was necessary the UN wouldn't have called it illegal and called for it to be removed. They would not have condemned it if it was needed, or if they had a legit reason for building it. If you ask me everything that Israel have done for "security" reasons just makes palestinians more angry and frustrated which is not really going to help either side.|`|0StmErZBaa	Yes, the "fence" has definitely inhibited the perpetration of suicide bombings in Israel proper.  I feel sorry for those Palestinians who are inconvenienced, but the ends do justify the means in this instance.  The fence will eventually come down if you have hope for peace.  It is up to the Palestinians to prevent these "angry prisoners" from venting their frustration at Israel once the fence comes down through forgiveness and understanding, something lacking currently by both sides of the conflict.|`|4aveC2aaaa	they pray to a wall! <br>  <br>  palestinians will not be stopped by a simple "wall" <br>  <br>  it will take more than a wall to stop us from getting our land back|`|l9RDuthbaa	By your logic, every country is a prison.<br>  The wall has been doing a great job stopping terrorists from the west bank.|`|uyfFGeMsaa	I agree with you wholeheartedly.  The wall is counterproductive.  They should take down the wall and welcome Palestinians with open arms.  That will make them so happy that they will lose the desire to commit terrorism.  In fact, why don't the Israelis distribute free suicide vests to anyone who requests one, as a confidence building measure?  Who would use it, if there's complete freedom of movement?  Why would they be angry?<br>  <br>  Setting limits is always counterproductive.  The only way to achieve peace, harmony, and brotherhood is to step up to the path of wisdom, and surrender.|`|b8ae5eef3b2d61ecb71b1965967306bcaa	The Wall Against Terrorism absolutely has saved lives. Based on the behavior of the terrorists, I would estimate between two and three thousand lives have been saved.|`|jJxUCkkFaa	for sure!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|UIJorsD7aa	Since September 2000, Israel has suffered 29,000 terrorist attacks, with 2,800 Israeli citizens killed and thousands more wounded. Terrorist groups responsible for these attacks include the Fatah organization and its Al-Aksa Martyrs Brigade, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), Palestine Islamic Jihad (PIJ), and Hamas. Throughout the West Bank and Gaza, as well as Israel proper, these organizations have sent suicide bombers to murder Israeli civilians in buses, cafes, and places of worship; they have used snipers to shoot at Israeli civilians in their homes and vehicles and even in baby carriages; and they have invaded homes and seminaries in order to carry out shooting sprees. These attacks have been fomented through propaganda disseminated in the Palestinian media, including in speeches by religious leaders broadcast on official Palestinian television. <br>  <br>  Israel has taken various measures to deter and prevent such attacks, including full-scale re-deployment into areas previously evacuated as part of peace negotiations. For example, following a wave of Palestinian terror attacks that killed 120 people in March 2002, Israel initiated Operation Defensive Shield, which resulted in counter-terror operations in Nablus, Jenin, Ramallah, Tulkarm, Bethlehem, and Kalkilya. Construction of a security fence began shortly thereafter. The fence currently covers most of the northern and one-third of the western West Bank. <br>  <br>  According to figures supplied by the Israeli government, the fence has undoubtedly saved lives. For example, between August 2001 and August 2002, 58 people were killed or wounded in the Israeli towns of Afula and Hadera, near the West Bank Arab towns of Jenin and Tulkarm. Since the fence went up in that area, only three Israelis have been killed. Similarly, there was a drop from 17 successful terror attacks launched from the northern West Bank into Israel from April to December 2002 down to only five attacks from the area during all of 2003, following construction of the fence. Furthermore, a fence has proved its utility in Gaza, where one has existed since 1996, resulting in few Gaza residents participating in terrorist attacks within Israel. The security fence, therefore, plays a crucial role in Israel's fight against the genocidal terror campaign against its citizens.|`|0fW76gB8aa	This giant prison that you speak of does not exist. The Palestinians are not 'imprisoned.'<br>  <br>  Israel is a sovereign state, and as such has the right to control access into the country but non-citizens, which includes the Palestinians. Palestinian Arabs are able to enter Israel provided they have permission from the Israeli Government. To get permission they need a valid and reasonable excuse. They also have to satisfy the requirement that they pose no threat to the security of the state.<br>  <br>  The Government of Israel will not allow people to enter if they are considered a security risk by the Shabak, Police, IDF etc. The same happens in pretty much every other country.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, the Arabs in Judea and Samaria are able to go to Jordan, with the permission of the Government of Jordan.|`|ymXlF9Rnaa	The security fence has drastically decreased suicide bomb attempts, West Bank has two sides, only one side has a wall, the other side faces Jordan, it is not a prison.<br>  <br>  Terrorists have found other ways to murder Jews, firing rockets, driving bulldozers and cars into civilians on the Israeli streets.<br>  <br>  Had these "innocent" people you talk about protested against suicide bombings before the development of the security fence, it wouldn't of had to go up, you say it will create "new terrorists, by your logic, a living Jew creates terrorists.

And ive tried every product on the market, to laundry aides, to industrial hard core stuff.. OH well!|`|5hNAgTpaaa	---- First, you need to sink them in warm water for an hour or so; I usually leave them in tap water in a washing machine overnight, and then add some soap powder with very little amount of bleach, you leave the machine on medium speed for a full circle. Take them to dray for only 50% in a dryer machine. It is very advisable to leave them completely dray spread-out and under direct sun light; it is for me kind of healthy cleaning style and will help you on iron. Finally, iron them on the room floor not on the small iron table. Hang them with wooden hangers but with a small gap in-between each. While ironing them give more tension to the neck and sleeves of thobes.<br>  Put please do not ask me how to iron them,,,,,, because I hated that. ----|`|54pPOC5Caa	The first answer is actually correct.

RMS7eFfpaa	You CANNOT get cash back in France.|`|sPVOCozuaa	Cashback is not possible in France :(<br>  <br>  I have a standard account with Nationwide (a FlexAccount).  it's really good because it allows you to pay for stuff on the card abroad, but also to withdraw money from cash machines abroad - but there are NO charges for doing this!  I think most other banks charge a commission - on every purchase.  So if you end up paying for a lot of things, you pay a lot of commission - but not with nationwide.  i'd really recommend looking into it, if you go abroad a lot.

Holmes Chapel is another place which is around midway, that is 53 miles from Blackburn.  In all honesty, it depends on what you like doing as I doubt that there is much going on at either of those places.

It is however common in reference to an infant.|`|uAyYRXnvaa	No.  It's more common for a guy to call his girlfriend babe.... never heard anyone ue bubba though.|`|e9555bec7535b22de2db20580ac7d03baa	Bub is Australian slang for baby, but only used for actual babies, never heard it used to an adult though.|`|RbmfJX5gaa	My hubby calls me bub sometimes.<br>  <br>  I haven't really heard it anywhere else.|`|H7jy99NOaa	No, I think it's unique to your boyfriend. I have heard men here call their GFs "babe", that's the closest I can think of.|`|fe1f10099c8b001c60cc7493a5e641cbaa	Never heard bub.  Babe or Baby is the most common used I reckon.|`|L1Tu56TFaa	No it sounds unique to that person by the sounds of it. I have nbever used bub (except to a baby) or bubba and have never had it used back to me.  We do have a lot of nicknames, or other names tha we use on and to each other, so maybe this is your friends words.  It maybe that your friends heard it on TV or somewhere and liked it.  We often hear names or slang terms on TV, and begin people begin using them.  But no it is not very common to use or hear bub or bubba used in Australia.|`|s2IOyj8iaa	No I never now hear this but have heard it in the past. My grandmother called my Mum Bub all her life. You do hear all sorts of names such as baby, darling, sweet heart, gorgeous etc I actually get called beautiful but my mans getting on a bit and I don't think his eye sight is as good.|`|RrNEudTTaa	Nope, never heard it in my life.<br>  BY THE WAY, we don't actually call each other 'mates' anyway.

OxwWclcmaa	Hhmmm Cork is a good idea. Lots to do and the countryside and coast is beautiful.<br>  Connemara in the west of Ireland would be my favourite.<br>  It's on the coast and very wild and sparsely populated- lots of castles nd romantic scenery. It's also near the city of Galway which is great for culture, history, restaurants etc.<br>  <br>  Cork though is also good for similar reasons and is close to other popular tourist attractions in counties like Kerry.<br>  Clare and the Burren in the west and Co Donegal in the North would also be good options.<br>  <br>  This website is good for places to stay and eat from castles and 5 star hotels to cheaper options. <br>  www.ireland-guide.com/<br>  <br>  There's also lots of deals around at the moment including honeymoon options so watch out for those. Congrats!xx|`|afeoTehEaa	Dundalk|`|fb91d7787ff11d494c4d4fc23a885c5aaa	Galway! MUCH nicer city than Cork, very much the quintessential Irish town. There are great hotels and adorable bed and breakfasts in Salthill, which is the area right on the beach a few miles from the city. Great pubs, great restaurants, and great quick day trips to places like Connemara and Clare.<br>  Enjoy your trip!|`|qKUMaJcXaa	Yes cork
WUnEENDQaa	i vote for the magic kingdom.  fun for all ages.  for the little one's they will enjoy mickey's toon town fair, and all of the rides in fantasy land including: dumbo, it's a small world, winnie the pooh ride etc.<br>  <br>  and for the teen (i have a 14 yr old, this is her avatar btw) so the teen would love the race car speed way, space mountain, buzz light year ride, the stitch ride.  and over in adventure land, frontier land: splash mountain, thunder mountain, tom sawyer's island, and pirates of the carribean.  if your 13yr old is a girl, she might like fantasy land also.|`|f3f09dd5dab69f7e644b37c4cf98a3abaa	They all have a lot to offer - for the littler one - they are going to like the Micky stuff in the little kid section of Magic Kingdom.  The older ones will like it too they just won't admit it. <br>  <br>  re: Hollywood (formerly MGM) there are some nice shows there that kids would like and the Stunt spectacular is great - there is also the Muppet show.  I'm not into the big terror rides so I relax near the parade route and let the older ones to tower of terror and Rock n' roller coaster.<br>  <br>  Epcot has some new Nemo stuff that all will like <br>  <br>  All the parks have something for everyone - if you have 2 adults - I would split up for part of the time so that the older kid and the adults get to do some things too.|`|tnznR01paa	Well, everyone can have fun at each park.<br>  But I guess for a 13 year old either Hollywood Studios or Epcot and the 6,4 and 2 year old Magic Kingdom, but If you're going all together then Magic Kingdom would be good! It's fun for all ages.<br>  <br>  Have fun:).|`|vgqMJU3zaa	All of them.  Since you don't state in your question I will answer with what information I got yesterday from the travel channel.  If you are mother and father of the kids mom can take the smaller ones to certain areas of the parks that will entertain them more.  For little girls anything with princesses will be a hit. The magic kingdom has rides for little ones like Dumbo's Flying Circus, Aladin, and to much to enter here   Also they have a special ticket for the rides so that dad can take the 13yr old on a bigger ride and then mom can go on with him right after with no extra waiting.  They also have it set up for fast pass.  Where you go to a ride get a special ticket that will tell you what time to come back to get right on the ride.  I think you can get those only if you are staying at one of the resorts.  Have a great time.|`|72hMibsVaa	I recommend Magic Kingdom.   Mostly rides, and the kids love it. <br>  <br>  Second if they like animals, Animal Kingdom.<br>  <br>  third, Hollywood studios in my opinion is more for adults.  not too many rides, mainly shows. a few kids attractions like Little mermaid, <br>  <br>  Epcot, Future world, but they won't appriceate the countries yet.|`|vJ0j5rRLaa	If you are taking them all on the same day, I would suggest the Magic Kingdom<br>  <br>  That way ALL the kids can enjoy the rides.  There is something for everyone.<br>  <br>  Good Luck :)|`|TQEfdmhnaa	separately or together?  The little ones would appreciate the Magic Kingdom more than your teen.  If you are all going together...maybe Animal Kingdom.  MGM can get boring and the only rides are not for the little ones.  Epcot also... boring! for the little ones. In my opinion, best bet for all of them..  Animal Kingdom<br>  <br>  Have fun|`|aVGj9yVfaa	Hollywood studios they have all the roller coasters
vgNELAQIaa	Drug and Sex Offenders get their names placed on a data base. Part of the entry requirements on the entry card you fill in prior to landing requires honesty. Being dishonest is enough reason to be refused entry.<br>  Drug and sex offenders have extreme difficulty in obtaining a visa to enter Australia. Obviously, being sent home upon arrival is going to cost you dearly, should that occur through your drug offence or through any dishonesty on the entry card.<br>  <br>  My suggestion is this.... When applying for your visa before departure, be specific and honest in the application. If they refuse you a visa, then you will know what could have happened if you with held that information at the time of entry.<br>  <br>  If allowed entry, do expect delays through immigration. It is highly likely that you will receive closer attention. Your bags will be searched and you may be even subject to a pat down and drug detecting swabs or a visit with a sniffer dog.<br>  <br>  That being said, it is likely that you will not be permitted entry. Australia has some very strict entry requirements, even though once you enter the country you will enjoy the great freedom this country enjoys.<br>  <br>  I know of a fellow from New Zealand that was refused entry when he failed to declare a drug conviction. In addition to which, he has since been refused a visa on two formal applications since, due to a combination of that conviction, and his dishonesty.|`|6xiwiiIzaa	The Customs in Australia's airports are only interested in what you are Bringing in to there Country, that's all, no worries ok .|`|AA12074269	You have to fill out a form on arrival which asked "have you been convicted on any offence" so if the court date is prior to the trip - you will have to answer yes. You will then be asked to explain so I would take all the documents with you. They could turn you around and send you back. The question that will be asked is "how likely is it that you will re-offend here (i.e. take cocaine)" so if you have proof of attending a drug rehab program or similar you should be okay|`|claUGpVRaa	With Australia, honesty is definitely the best policy. Sorry. Otherwise you will arrive and be turned away at customs. They are very strict there.<br>  Check with the embassy|`|fox5a3ePaa	Ill tell you this, once you are convicted of it you will have no chance of getting into Australia|`|35ccc8ce58bda98ad049f1093b5a126aaa	They will be more interested in the mud on your boots.|`|a9btWYKRaa	I am moving to Aus in about 7 weeks, I had top fill out the whole visa thing too!!!! and when it comes to the Australian High Commission honesty is the best policy, If they see you lied about they will think your very likely of doing it again, whereas if you are honest (and admit it was a mistake) they will be alot more lenient. I had a criminal record, not drugs tho from when I was 15 (now 21) and they just asked me to write a letter explaining what happened, if under the influence that sort of stuff. I was finally granted my visa last friday... woo hoo!!!<br>  <br>  I think if it is your first drug offence they may look past it as it wasn't a huge amount.<br>  <br>  The best thing you could do is be honest.<br>  <br>  Good Luck x|`|LQJJIANiaa	Be honest, lying will seriously only worsen the situation. Sorry..

What skills do you have to look for a job? <br>  <br>  You will not see the same weather that is for sure, regardless of where you go. <br>  <br>  Before you go you MUST consult this website to make sure you understand what is necessary and what paperwork you need:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.canadainternational.gc.ca/washington/imm/index.aspx?lang=eng&menu_id=78&menu=L" rel="nofollow">http://www.canadainternational.gc.ca/was...</a>|`|3QsPl1uLaa	Yes I live in Canada.<br>  Whether you move here on not depends on your values and what you want. If you hate snow then coastal BC is the only part of Canada for you.|`|2WxxStXIaa	<a href="http://www.notcanada.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.notcanada.com/</a><br>  <br>  The Now very popular real Canada.<br>  <br>  <br>  8. Discriminatory and Dishonest Immigration System.<br>  Immigration to Canada is based on a point system, obtained with your education, qualifications and job experience. Points are good enough for immigration, but in Canada, they are not good enough to get a job in your field. Amazing, how the credentials that qualify you to come to Canada are the same credentials that don't qualify you for your profession in Canada. The reason is, Canada only wants immigrants to do the labor jobs - pizza delivery, driving taxis, factory work etc.<br>  <br>  <br>  7. Out Of Control Cost Of Living.<br>  From rent, to utility bills, to shopping, to phone, internet and cable bills, to gas, to car insurance, to eating out, to basically anything you have to pay for or buy, the cost of living in Canada has become astronomical. Recent immigrants are astonished as to how expensive everything is. It is estimated that compared to most countries around the world, the cost of living in Canada is on average five times greater.<br>  <br>  <br>  6. Health Care Crisis.<br>  Practicing physicians in Canada are in a shortage, 1 in 4 Canadians cannot get a family doctor. Canadian doctors are leaving to move permanently to the United States. Statistics Canada and the Canadian Medical Association both have identified that for every 1 American doctor that moves to Canada, 19 (nineteen) Canadian doctors move to the United States! Doctors in Canada are overworked and underpaid, and there is a cap on their salaries.<br>  <br>  <br>  5. Very High Taxes.<br>  Yes, you have the GST, the PST, totaling 15%, on practically everything you purchase and many other taxes taken out of our weekly paycheck. You have to pay a whopping amount to the government, out of your hard earned salary, so that the government can turn around and give it to beer drinking, hockey watching welfare bums. Fair? It does not matter, it's Canada.<br>  <br>  <br>  4. Money Hungry Government.<br>  Canadian Embassies around the world lie to foreigners, painting this picture that Canada is Utopia, because they want them to come to Canada. Why? Because foreigners bring money! So after being deceived, these foreigners come. They must bring with them at least $10,000. Canada has an immigration quota of 250,000 per year. So please do the math, 250,000 multiplied by $10,000 each equals a whopping 2.5 Billion dollars that Canada gains from immigrants every year.<br>  <br>  <br>  3. No Culture.<br>  Unlike almost every other country in the world, Canada has no culture. Actually American culture is what dominates Canada. When was the last time you had some 'Canadian' food? There are no Canadian traditions and there is no national identity. What does it even mean to call yourself a 'Canadian'. . .nothing really. People living in Canada, still identify themselves with the country they 'originally' came from.<br>  <br>  <br>  2. Worst Weather.<br>  Yes, Canada has the worst weather conditions of any country in the world. Freezing cold temperatures, snow, ice, hail, winds, storms etc. From the Prairie provinces to the Maritimes, from the Territories to southern Ontario, the weather is so horrific and disgusting that many Canadians leave Canada simply because of this reason alone.<br>  <br>  <br>  1. No Jobs.<br>  Yes, coast to coast, there are no jobs. Immigrants are highly qualified (MD's, PhD's, Lawyers, Engineers etc.) but they are driving taxi cabs, delivering pizza's or working in factories. Even people with bachelors degrees from Canadian Universities cannot find jobs after graduation. This is the tragedy associated with immigration to Canada. I feel sorry for those immigrants who are stuck in Canada for the rest of their lives. It is indeed a very sad and hopeless future.|`|8OREBeRdaa	I live in Canada and I like it.  I admit that I've thought about moving to another country. <br>  <br>  There are definitely worse countries to live in.  I think you need to ask yourself why you want to move.  What kind of activities and environment do you want to be around?  I'd do a bit of research before you up and move. <br>  <br>  I keep hearing that our country is really hard to get into immigration-wise.  I don't know why but please ensure you find all the info.|`|crZg76Hpaa	I live up in Canada! And it's bombbbbbbbbb|`|oSLiS5jDaa	I moved to Toronto, Canada three years ago... <br>  <br>  From my own experiences, it's not a bad idea to move to Canada if you do like the cold weather in winter. As I know, Arizona's winter is much warmer than here. However, you may like skiing and there are many great place to ski in Canada. Especially the 2010 Olympic will be held in Vancouver.<br>  <br>  Also, Canadian are really friendly and polite. They use "Thank you" and "Sorry" a lot. <br>  <br>  Overall, Canada is really a good place to live. Moving to Canada is not a bad idea.|`|AA11478483	Yes, and yes.
KXpxXPPFaa	Thailand's baght is worth 36 to our dollar.  Most things, including drinking and meals can be reasonable.  There are usually menus outside the larger hotel dining areas.  I wouldn't be afraid to eat off the carts, or in a local restaurant,  I have been there 5 times and never been sick eating off carts and at the local markets all the time.  Eating like that is cheap.  Again Cheap.  Markets, including clothing, purses, etc. expect you to barter for any item you are interested in.  You can get some incredible deals if you are patient and wait for the price you want to pay.  I would say that if you take $500. to $1,000 dollars to spend you should have plenty of money to do whatever you want.

p8UAIAisaa	The Western Meadowlark (Sturnella neglecta) is a medium-sized blackbird, very similar in appearance to the Eastern Meadowlark.<br>  <br>  Adults have yellow underparts, with a black "V" on the breast, and white flanks which are streaked with black. Their upper parts are mostly brown, but also have black streaks. These birds have long pointed bills and their heads are striped with light brown and black.<br>  <br>  Their breeding habitats are grasslands, prairies, pastures, and abandoned fields, all of which may be found from across western and central North America to northern Mexico. Where their range overlaps with the eastern species, these birds prefer thinner, drier vegetation; the two types of birds generally do not interbreed but do defend territory against one another. Their nests are situated on the ground, and are covered with a roof woven from grass. There may be more than one nesting female in a male's territory. Their nests are sometimes destroyed by mowing operations with eggs and young in them.<br>  <br>  Western Meadowlarks will interbreed with Eastern Meadowlarks where their ranges overlap; however, resulting young appear to have low fertility.[1]<br>  <br>  Western Meadowlarks are permanent residents throughout much of their range. Northern birds may migrate to the southern parts of their range; some birds also move east in the southern United States.<br>  <br>  These birds forage on the ground or in low to semi-low vegetation. They sometimes search for food by probing with their bills. They mainly eat insects, although they will devour seeds and berries. In winter, these birds often feed in flocks.<br>  <br>  These birds have a flute-like warbled song. These calls contrast with the simple, whistled call of the Eastern Meadowlark.<br>  <br>  These two species were considered to be the same species for some time; the western species, having been overlooked for some time, was given the species name neglecta.<br>  <br>  This is the state bird of Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oregon and Wyoming.

AA12212523	Everyone pays taxes and a part of those taxes pay for everyone's healthcare. <br>  <br>  In some provinces, people pay a small premium for healthcare instead, at the same time as taxes. That means that there is only one insurance pool in each province, which in turn means a lot less admin cost.<br>  <br>  Everyone resident in that province has a medical card that they present when they need treatment. You can use the cards for emergencies in other provinces as well.<br>  <br>  We do this already with shared things like roads, schools, and parks which come out of taxes.Taxes pay for other social services like pensions, education and welfare. <br>  <br>  Everyone is insured, people are more secure and more healthy. Works for Canadians, who spend less on health care than people in the USA and live longer.|`|E5gaKzCsaa	I can answer most of that pretty well. Exactly which taxes cover health care is best left for someone who understands government spending. I sure don't.<br>  <br>  Health care plans are administered by each province so there are some differences in how an individual pays, if they pay at all. There are also going to be a few differences in exactly what the plans cover but they are all pretty similar. I'm in BC so I know that one best. Everyone is covered, whether you work or not, as long as you're a legal resident in that province. If you have a job, it might be part of your benefits that your employer pays for it. As a single person, I pay $54 a month, less or nothing if my income is low. Couples pay double that, three or more in a family pay $108/month. If you have low income, you tell them that and they exempt you from paying. If you have decent income, you'll get treated even if you haven't paid but they'll come after you to pay the monthly fee. You're covered for just about anything medical--GP visits, specialists, surgery, hospital stays, etc. You have to pay for a few things that often go along with medical care like prescriptions and crutches, but no dental care of any kind is covered, ordinary vision care isn't usually covered, and some newer and more expensive treatments aren't covered. But if you break your leg or have cancer or have a baby, you won't pay much if anything for whatever treatment you get. Children are covered under their parents' plan.|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	In Manitoba there is no monthly cost. The one downside to our system is abuse. Since it is free it is used much more than if there was cost involved, plus with rates the Doctors get paid fixed by the Government there is much more money to be made south of the boarder causing many of our graduating nursing and medical students to take their skills to American Hospitals. The biggest advantage is if you have a family member with a serious condition you wont be burdened with the cost of their treatment. You may lose a leg to cancer but not your house.

D9zgZvpoaa	It's not a true canadian accent. There are some differences. I thinks its because they interact with a lot more Canadians than the southern states. Also there is more than one Canadian accent. There is the Newfound land accent which is very different. There is the easterner accent.

If anything you should be proud if you have a Canadian accent.|`|2WxxStXIaa	According to a Recent popular US article on the L.A. Times.<br>  <br>  A little question of history. Mordecai Richler (a Canadian satirical novelist and satirical children's novelist) once suggested that what defines Canadians is the fact that we're all, quite literally, LOSERS!--and we've never gotten over the fact. Nobody actually actively chose to live here because they really liked the idea. The natives, who were always here, didn't choose to have the European-dominated country of Canada imposed on top of them--but they lost battles, and so became Canadians. Losers. The French in Quebec are Canadians because the British defeated them back in the eighteenth century (and they sure don't like that fact these days). Losers, right? The British-based population of Canada consists of two major groups: United Empire Loyalists, the people in the American colonies who sided with Britain in the war of independence and lost, and so had to flee to Ontario and the Maritimes; and immigrants from England, most obviously people who were doing poorly there, losers at the game of life who decided to set out and try again somewhere else. Losers all again. Throughout this century, people who have immigrated to Canada have tended to be people who have lost elsewhere--lost wars, lost land, etc. Losers yet again. My own ancestors came here because of pogroms in Eastern Europe that destroyed their homes--and would have preferred to go to the US but they couldn't get in, so they settled for Canada, poor losers. We Canadians aren't patriotic because we really only settle for being here, all of us, rather than being delighted by it--and we love to whine about it. Losers for sure, eh?

AA11496012	Unfortunately we have had a number of plane crashes this year and in such a short time-span.  But even so, the chances of surviving a plane crash are a lot better than in the past.  Aircraft are build better and the flight crew is trained more.  Also they say that there is one crash for every 1.2 million flights so air travel is still the safest form of transportation.  <br>  <br>  For the US Airways crash in New York, Canadian geese were sucked into both engines.  That is an extremely rare occurrence. <br>  <br>  The Continental Airlines crash near Buffalo appears to be attributed mostly to pilot error but until the National Transportation Safety Board comes out with their full report, we can only speculate at this time.<br>  <br>  For the Turkish Airlines crash, they are still investigating the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorders.  That will take some time before investigators can determine what happened.  Some have wondered if the aircraft ran out of fuel because there was no explosion or fire but airlines are required to carry extra fuel.|`|KkRb3paPaa	i'm scared of planes too. i've been scared of taking a plane since 9/11 happened. til this day, i have never rode one. I think they need to check the planes carefully before they even lift off. I'm not sure why it keeps happening but I hope it stops soon.|`|cTYhnumDaa	All the planes that have crashed were due to different things so there is no particular reason for it. I think it's jus a coincidence<br>  <br>  think about it like this<br>  <br>  ok so about 3-4 planes have crashed recently but thousands come and go every day.<br>  <br>  loads of cars crash everyday, you just dont hear about it because its so common.<br>  <br>  Because plane crashes are less common (because its the safest way to travel) any major incident becomes a big thing for the media to cover and hype up<br>  <br>  Planes are still safe to travel and i read that you have a 1/100 chance of crashing in a car and a 1/20000 of crashing in a plane|`|ClZWgDoxaa	It's really not any more than any other year..

I'm sure plane crashes don't have reunions so I would say it has just been an unlucky year.|`|2pgJgRd4aa	I am not afraid but it is problably from the wind force. Both winds blowing from diffrent sides and they push down to the surface and it makes the plane harder to steer so it crashes.
lzEuuseJaa	You don't know any other actors you can move out with? If you're planning to stay for awhile, and believe me, if you want any chance, you've got to, why not come with someone else, or the intent on finding a roommate/room? Having a roommate isn't the greatest idea, especially another actor, lol, but it's better than a hostel and do the math, the cost would likely be less. In addition to LA, you might look at North Hollywood, Glendale, and Burbank, the typical places for young struggling actors to live.<br>  <br>  If you're planning to come out for just a couple of weeks, you likely won't find many auditions. You gotta commit!<br>  <br>  Call the various hostels and ask. <br>  <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=hostels%2C+los+angeles" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?q=hostels%2...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.hostels.com/us.ca.la.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hostels.com/us.ca.la.html</a><br>  <a href="http://www.usahostels.com/hollywood/index.html?lang=10" rel="nofollow">http://www.usahostels.com/hollywood/inde...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.orangedrivehostel.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.orangedrivehostel.com/</a><br>  =======<br>  Do you have any training?

This ain't American Idol, where you can just show up and hope for a shot.<br>  <br>  I hope you have plenty of money...<br>  ----------------<br>  If you're not qualified enough to even get an agent, then maybe you shouldn't be wasting your time coming out here. The compeition is steep, and we have enough waiters. <br>  <br>  Nothing's more embarassing than those people on American Idol who think they can sing but really can't carry a tune. Same with wannabe actors. If we didn't see 10 or 20 of these questions per day, we would be more tolerant.|`|tQM0ufHoaa	Dont take this wrong, but it sounds like youre not quite ready for LA yet.

Check out the concerts going on during your visit at the following venues, see what floats your boat:<br>  <br>  9:30 Club: <a href="http://www.930.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.930.com/</a><br>  <br>  Black Cat: <a href="http://www.blackcatdc.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.blackcatdc.com/</a><br>  <br>  Both of those venues are in the U Street neighborhood, which is artsy and eclectic and "urban." Get dinner at Marvin or Busboys & Poets or Local 16. Then, after the concert, grab a chili dog (but call it a "half smoke") at Ben's Chili Bowl in the same neighborhood - it's a local legend.<br>  <br>  There are several different Smithsonian museums - ones for art, for science, for history, etc. Most of them are located around the National Mall, and they are all free - if you're not sure about one, you can just pop in, take a look around, and go on to the next place. Visit the Smithsonian website to figure out what you'd like to see: <a href="http://www.si.edu/" rel="nofollow">http://www.si.edu/</a><br>  <br>  And if you like art, the National Gallery is also free, and is located on the Mall, but isn't a part of the Smithsonian.<br>  <br>  If you want to go to the White House, you need to call your Congressperson NOW for tickets. They are free, but you have to sign up a long time in advance. You can also ask for tickets to tour the Capitol, which I actually think is cooler, and you don't have to wait so long for those.<br>  <br>  If you like shopping, check out the area around Georgetown University (M Street and Wisconsin Street is a good place to start - you can walk there from Foggy Bottom Metro). There's a good mix of boutique stores, normal stores, and great restaurants. Grab lunch at Pizzeria Paradiso or News Cafe - both on M Street.|`|jLppTLOmaa	Go to the Madame Tissued Wax Museum!!!!

WUuO6wbAaa	I have your answer right here. You probably never thought of it, because it's small. Park your car on Staten Island, on a residential block on the north shore. They have Express Buses. You can take the bus in for $5. The parking is free. There's this service lane, at the last exit right before the Verrazano bridge, right next to where an Express Bus comes ever 20 minutes. It'll bring you back to the same location, except on the other side of the highway, but there's a street you can walk up and around the block to get back to your car.<br>  <br>  Staten Island practically is New Jersey. If you looked at it on a map, you'd think it is, because of it's proximity to Hudson, Union and Middlsex counties. If you want a safe place to park in New Jersey, one of the train stations, like Elizabeth, which is indoor, is safe, but it'll cost you money. You may be able to find a spot on the street in Bayonne, near a train station, but that could be a pain. They also have a city bus that runs from Staten Island into Bayonne, New Jersey now, that'll bring you right to the NJ Transit station that leaves you off at 31st Street in Manhattan, near MSG and close to Mid-Town.|`|f8aa8e21997cfa7908574dfa12f124cdaa	My friend, there are plenty of garages near PATH train station in both Hoboken and Jersey City, NJ.
