20070614082714AAdHkPK	Dining Out;Mexico;Other - Mexico	Porque algunos restaurantes que tienen éxito aquí en México, rápidamente bajan su calidad?	Hace poco, se abrio un nuevo Vip's  restaurante aqui en mi ciudad, la primera vez que fui todo estuvo Excelente: Comida, servicio, atencion. Pero, después la comida estuvo pésima, el servicio de las meseras bueno aunque la muchacha se vei muy cansada, la atencion del encargado y chef estuvo pésima.   Pues resulta que pedi una pechuga de pollo a la parrilla, ya lo habia comido en Monterrey muy buena. Pues esta no mostraba las clasicas rayas de la parrilla, y con exceso de mantequilla, luego resulto que la parte del pollo era la cola. (forma en V), las verduras parecian de lata que al recalentarse se pulverizaron. Me queje y nada. Al pagar llene el libro de quejas  y chef me aseguro que si tienen pechuga que si me daba la vuelta me preparaba una. "En tus sue?os vuelvo"   Ahora se puede ver el estacionamiento vacio, parece que esto sigue igual.

20090222112848AAZlEpa	Dining Out;Other - Dining Out	Just came back from Florida.  While there we ate at the Hard Rock Cafe in Universal.  The food was okay, but..?	I really didn't like the service. I'm not saying that it was bad, but more wierd.  I noticed that none of the servers ever carried trays and they brought things out little by little.  Drinks and food.  I thought that was totally rude.  My sisters recieved their food first and then my mom and then my dad and I.  Because of that, my father and I were the last ones eating and my sisters were the first ones finished.  Wouldn't it be more simple and polite for everything to come out at once?? My question is: Was it only that one that was like that?  Or are all the Hard Rock Cafes like that?

I am helping a good friend decide on which register to choose for his new business adventure.     I am looking at Sharp and Casio for the most part.        I have seen registers with 8 pre programmed department and some with up to 99 departments.  They range from 80 - 2000 price look ups (plu).  How would I determine how many departments I need and PLUs?  I am trying to keep the cost anywhere between 79.00 and 199.00.  Is there a notable difference and preference between thermal printing and drum printing?        Does anyone have any advice on what functions are most valuable?   thanks!

My boyfriend has never had the experience of going to a really good Teppanyaki place where the chef's actually put on a show.

The chefs seemed pretty young and in-experienced.  I just recently moved down here so I don't know what's good and what's not.  If anyone knows of a Teppanyaki place that puts on a great show in/or nearby Fresno (regardless of price), please let me know!  Thank you!
