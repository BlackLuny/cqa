ac53eed0ec00a2d980be53069b559e62aa	AGAIN...<br>  <br>  I take it I'm going to be answering this question forever.<br>  <br>  you CANNOT have babies in any version of the Sims 2 for PS2. no cheats, no hacks, no adoptions, no alien abductions. you CANNOT have them. PERIOD!!!<br>  <br>  "To help make the experience more console-friendly, aging, death and child rearing have been taken out of the mix."<br>  <a href="http://ps2.ign.com/articles/662/662057p1.html" rel="nofollow">http://ps2.ign.com/articles/662/662057p1...</a>|`|piDDZ6Ywaa	No, you can't. Only adults. Sorry.|`|qzwWVgWMaa	No, you can't in The Sims2 on PS2. If you have a PC you should get the PC version. It's so much better, really.<br>  <br>  I don't see the point of the PS2 version of The Sims 2, I rally don't. Like your houses can only have one one story, your sims don't age, there is no DNA to make sims look alike, you can't leave the house, you can't have kids, you can't create your own clothes, you can't create your own wallpapers and you can't build your own community lots.<br>  <br>  I just don't like it to be honest lol. It just can't compare to the PC version with all the Expansion & Stuff Packs* installed.|`|912889ffe6d1f7e7c946f67482ee58dcaa	No.  There are no children on the ps2 version<br>  <br>  On a side note... the sims sucks.... on consoles.  Go for the PC versions!|`|YI8V5e36aa	I had that game very briefly a long time ago.... but i dont think you can make children... only teen and up
uu8qQwWpaa	You can buy a 'Digitone' Privacy blocker that goes along with your home landline phone. You buy it, no monthly charge. You can block any numbers you want!!! Or entire area codes!! I have one, and I would not be without it. Check it out at <a href="http://www.digitone.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.digitone.com</a>|`|YkseyT7zaa	Yes, if your referring to a land line phone.

r7rfflpyaa	Why are u posting a meaningless question like this twice?
prnrVJaFaa	try to search with different type.. it works sometimes..
j5Apt8hWaa	Probably not.  <br>  <br>  Perhaps if you had your camera around or near heavy magnetic fields like those found on MRI's and cyclotrons, you could experience some issues when the image data coming from the analog to digital converter is being written to your memory card, but I doubt that any unusual, but natural magnetic field could do that kind of interference when using a digital camera.<br>  <br>  If you will link us to a few samples of the resulting images, perhaps one of us here can point you in the right direction to find a permanent solution.<br>  <br>  Have you had someone else use their camera at the same time, in the same place while you are shooting, coming up with the same or similar results?<br>  <br>  I would first look to the camera for the source of the problem.  Try contacting Fujifilm and sending them a copy of a few image files suspected of being disrupted by this phenomenon<br>  <br>  Walking around attempting to shoot sports photographs with a Faraday cage wrapped around you, may be too expensive and clumsy to be worthwhile.  I would switch to using film to cover your events until you can resolve this issue.  You can then scan the film into your computer or have the lab make high resolution CD's of your images during the processing phase of the films development and printing.

24d30303d7dfdc03b1d6d393f19ad4bcaa	Actually, at present there are no HD channels in India. But, this year there will be release of HD channels in India. See this link <a href="http://www.indiantelevision.com/headlines/y2k8/sep/sep108.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.indiantelevision.com/headline...</a> <br>  On a HDTV, you can have the utmost pleasure of experiencing the picture, color, contrast. Standard definition DVDs look better, if you've a up-scaling DVD player (a player which upscale standard definition dvds look as HD picture). But, the main drawback for HDTVs is standard definition programmes won't look better when compared with SDTV as this one stretches the picture to fit it to the screen. Moreover, the price of HDTVs is still high and it could get down once HD channels and Blu-ray players as well as Blu-ray Discs are released in India. Then it would be better to buy a HDTV. The distance you've mentioned is optimum for 46" TV and make sure that when you buy a HDTV, buy a TV which has Full HD capability. Your screen size is optimum and look good when you play Blu-ray movies and watch HD channels on a full HD screen.|`|a5d3a73a2b18184ae9f44125b6ed78e0aa	Be prepared for standard def. programming to look worse than it did on your other TV because it will be stretched more. <br>  <br>  DVD movies won't look that much better unless you have an upgrade player or an xbox. I wouldn't spend that much money if you can't get the programming, I was shocked at how poor standard programming looked at first. The bigger the TV the worse it looks.|`|AA12155794	No problem,I am having one.|`|6wdhUjGtaa	Its a good idea i mean it would be better. So what if there aren't HD channels. If you re getting it in good price then its worth it!|`|i5jNl2Cuaa	If you have an xbox it is :D|`|XrD8sz4Daa	Def. better we have a 47 in Samsung and the movies we play are awesome.

WNPGVpQWaa	I am with sprint, and I can read all my text messages and picture mail online, I can also view my call history. So it is possible, but I don't know if verizon offers that?!|`|eSqsYYoDaa	No, you cannot read the sent or received text messages online.<br>  If her parents really want to see the text/picture messages, they have to go into the store and request to have the sent and received picture messages for the specific date(s)|`|0f7a58d034c64ae7c06d7548b006ca36aa	Verizon doesn't do that. The most info you can get online is the date/time the message was sent and the number it was sent from/to.
0f7a58d034c64ae7c06d7548b006ca36aa	Prices fluctuate all the time - there's really no way to tell when it will be on sale again. Sales usually seem to revolve around holidays, so maybe it will come down again for Mother's Day or something. You could also try going into a Verizon store and telling them that another store was selling it for $80 (lie) and see if they'll match it.
meydzNWWaa	It has nothing to do with your tv's specs... All the warranty will do is give you a credit of your purchase price toward a new tv... So if your checkout price was 1600 then you'll get 1600 credit. Being that its 2 years later and 1080p tv's are getting cheaper you shouldn't have any problem finding one. I bought a 42", 1080p, 30,000 to 1 contrast ratio, 120hz refresh rate and with a 2ms response time for 1499 a month or so ago.... Those are some pretty good specs if you're not too TV savvy. So you'll be getting a upgrade and also the warranty will not continue to your new tv, This will use up the warranty but seeing as this warranty is buying you a new tv i'd defiantly get another on on the new tv.|`|8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	The Samsung LN46A650 hits the sweet spot for many people.<br>  <br>  1.)

b2af104a189227ec51e22f6b307ab4eeaa	yes, the expansion was also released as an expansion for the XBOX version, in disc form.  You will have to find it on the internet or used at a gamestop somewhere.    Buy.com has it for under $15
AA11525080	Almost , you are allowed to choose 10 songs to keep.
j7rBM2yTaa	It all depends on what you use it for.    My top 3 (so far and excluding games) are:    Things - A to-do list.  iTap - a way to remote control a Mac/PC   Ocarina - (iphone only) turns the phone into a musical instrument.
VpfSbqhVaa	First step is to go to Verizon and complain. If they don't help you can find a new phone on Ebay. They come in a broad range of prices, from $25 to $600 dollars. You must make sure the phone is unlocked for the Verizon network, that will be in the item description. I would personally recommend a phone unlocked to all carriers, in case you decide to change. When you get the new phone just switch the SIM card located underneath the battery.|`|GhsqaXsdaa	Since the razr isn't a very new phone it probably wont cost much. I suggest you bring it to the verizon store and ask why your phones keep breaking. If they can't give you a discount, i don't think you should get another razr, if 2 of yours already broke/ or are breaking. Get a phone that isn't flimsy. The enV2 is a great phone.
73f4817c9af75121ee93853e03437fc1aa	There's a short somewhere.  Follow your speaker wires and be sure one's not crossed  (should all be + to +, - to -)  If you've got one flipped, there's your problem.
J3kfQtViaa	Your saves yes, but your trophies are saved on your account.  So as long as you log back into the same account and dont change your ps3 network handle you should be ok.|`|HekFanRvaa	that means you truned it off without quitting or exiting the game properly or you turned it off using the power button in the back while the ligth in fron is still green. Always shut down your PS3 using the shutdown command on the XMB. Then when the light is red, that's the time your turn the switch off in the back. You have a corrupted hard drive. You need to click ok and restore it.    edit.. does it matter to you if your trophies are gone? it's better than having your PS3 gone.|`|vGu6bcR9aa	You have to press ok.|`|0e1e3b65b3c1de6ffdd4ebc197d8f144aa	After the restoration is compleated log back to ur psn account and click on ur profile, all the trophies u collected will sync back to ur hard drive.|`|oTWnXvFxaa	The first reveiwer is wrong because I turned mine off with the back switch when the light is green all the time and nothing happens.  And I think you have to pick OK if you want to play your PS3 again.    Edit: What the guy above me said is right, you can get your trophies back through your online account.|`|H162bS7kaa	Just roll with it.  All your saves if played online are stored online as well as your trophies.|`|vs3vz6lIaa	well by you restoring it it means it will be updating but you will loose your memory and everything but I'm not 100% sure if you update it i am  not sure if it will delete your history but if it doesn't then you can just re install everything after its updated and you will be fine and back on track
Xxviy63Paa	I'm not sure. I do know that if you don't get the exact same model, it won't work. If it's the same model of 60 then it might, because it has the same firmware sub-version. (Different models have slightly different OS's.)    It would depend on whether the firmware is keyed to the hardware, and refuses to run on a different ps3.     But in the long run, the worst that can happen is losing your game saves. The stuff you bought you can just download again for free. You get up to 5 downloads of everything.     If you know someone else with a 60, try it and see. Even if most of the contents are locked on another ps3, you might be able to retrieve the saves, cause there's no reason to lock those. Likewise things like video and music. The things most likely to be non-portable are the games themselves, which you don't need to back up.      One other thing you could try doing is putting it into a laptop computer and trying to hack into it, again this would only work for the non-proprietary stuff like the video, music and saves. I know it is possible, you'll just have to search online to find out how.|`|vGu6bcR9aa	Yes. You can just swap out the drives.|`|HekFanRvaa	You are wrong. Sony will still fix it even without warranty. You just have to pay $150.    The cost of a hard drive will be somewhere around $100. And I would give away another $50 to avoid the trouble and time consuming process of fixing your PS3 without a guarantee that it will be running again after you're done "fixing" it.    you will not lose your games that you paid and downloaded, you can download it again without paying again. it is in your download history which is saved on your PSN online account.    Ring Sony and they will fix it for you... 1-800-345-7669.|`|xnSbRNYkaa	You can change the hard drive Im not sure if there will be problems putting a 60g HD in an 80g system(they don't make 60gigs anymore)  If you haven't already, i would call Sony up and ask them about it, they're usually very good on sending you a new one if it is unfixable, even if your warranty is out.|`|AA10518060	yes you should be able to do that just make sure you have a flash drive with the latest update (other wise you would have to re-format)|`|vs3vz6lIaa	well you might but most likely not because this is a hole new and improved system so you will loose everything but then just maybe you could reach you old stuff on your old account and re download it all on but most likely not but i am sure there soon will be a way that someone has hacked and figured it out

ishRTmt0aa	i just got my sway yesterday and so far i love it!!!!!!!!!!! i like the sleek look of it and its very easy to slide up. the battery is great and the screen is just the right size. i like it because it is cool and fun to use without having all this fancy touch screen crap!! it seems very durable and is just the right size for a phone. the only thing i dont like about it is the text response is slow. you can be txting or something and it will take a while for the words to catch up with you and stuff. overall, great phone and you should totally get it. you wont be disappointed!!|`|sasQNdn3aa	I have the phone<br>  The battery lasts two days, and that's if your lucky<br>  Texting response is really bad<br>  The screen does this weird thing where only bars show up sometimes.<br>  Its a cool looking phone, but if I had to go back again I think i'd go with something different.
GI27dKIkaa	Initially it will only work with the Orange network.<br>  <br>  All you have to do - is state in your advert that the phone will need unlocking to work on an alternative network.|`|1eCY0lQ3aa	Just put something like:<br>  SAMSUNG SOUL U900<br>  GOOD CONDITION<br>  ON ORANGE<br>  blah blah etc etc|`|FOl8QEfEaa	Go To environphone.co.uk they give a exact price for your mobile, they send you a envelope package so you can send it off for free. Before you send it you can see the price, they give you a check or argos vouchers. Good luck . Also if it has a orange logo on the back of it, that meens it can only work with orange sim cards unless you can take it somewhere like a phone shop and get it unlocked. Hope this helped.
vYKrRWOwaa	eBay will be your best bet.  Just make sure you buy from a seller with a really high feedback rating (99% or higher).  Also, I would be careful when buying a used one since you may not get warranty coverage.  The cost will depend on which Sidekick you're interested in.  I would recommend the Sidekick 2008.  It's the most current and you can customize your own housing plates for it so you can make your SK totally you!    The great thing about buying one outright off eBay is that you also don't have to sign or renew a contract.|`|49RABlM4aa	eBay. You can get em brand new for like, $115. Go for it.|`|bYjercAqaa	Tonto is looking for work, you could probably get him for about $50|`|j4erzRM2aa	ebay would be a good bet.     or try stealing one...

You connect it to your GBA and the other end plugs in where GameCube controllers normally go on the Wii.|`|tzFkYLGqaa	Yes with the cable from gamecube you connect it to the top|`|9M8lEQDqaa	No, you cannot hook up a Gameboy Advance to a Wii. Theres a way to connect the Wii to the DS and the Gameboy to the Gamecube, but not the GBA to the Wii.|`|CcJdEaRpaa	nope just through the ds   why didn't you just add this to your other question?|`|5HfuI3MEaa	yes, there is this link cable, a gba and gamecube link cable you can use. i have one. so you can pop in a gamecube game that can hook up to gba, like pokemon xd gale of darkness, and connect aaway to trade pokemon and stuff like that.|`|JSnxNv8waa	Yes but you need some kind of cable.|`|MGyzOIKqaa	no|`|c84e3d7c6c8ecfe924819637cbf13e07aa	I belive you could do it the same way you would with Gamecube. If you have the link GBA to GC Link Cable, and a GC game that supports it, you should be able to plug the cable into the ports on the top of the Wii.
1ayX5jmsaa	you need a sd adapter, Then cut all info you want to transfer and paste it on the computer, Then when its done downloading, remove the old sd card and put the new one in, Cut the information you transfered and paste it on the new card.    Youre basically cut and pasting from sd card to your pc then to the new sd card. i know it sounds like a hassle but that would be the only way.

HBNx77BBaa	When you say 'Polaroid' do you mean instant picture system or digital. Polaroid no longer make instant picture cameras or film.  The Polaroid camera range is now just digital compacts.    You can still get compatible film for some of the old Polaroid cameras. You'll have to look at the enthusiasts websites. Fujifilm make instant picture films some of which do fit in certain Polaroids. Fujifilm also produce instant picture cameras.|`|6xEpscamaa	Dude, that is SOOOOO eighties!|`|F4T9tOjXaa	Well actually polaroid sloped making film recently, possibly will.  If you do want to get this "instant" type camera, your are limited   to probably Ebay or some site like that.|`|X2b7kMtHaa	You can still get what we all know as a Polaroid camera - stick the film in, point and shoot, and out comes a print. (Don't shake it though).     A current model is the Polaroid 600 - it rates pretty well on Amazon with 4 stars.

BknIV5z9aa	Best Buy only sells certain companies, so that's not going to do the trick.  Depending where you live, T-Mobile has very good rates, but if you aren't in a densely populated area the service isn't the best.    verizon has great coverage, but a little pricey.  same thing with at&t...great service, but its expensive.  it also depends on what phone you want, because some phones are only offered at certain companies.    i know this doesn't give you an exact answer, but you need to really look around in your area for who has good service and good prices.|`|j4erzRM2aa	step 1. go to best buy  step 2. lay down your problem too a representative    that way, you will get relevant answers from people who know what they are talking about, instead of any run off the mill answers from yahoo. plus, you dont have to waste 5 points that way lol.
QE71sNC3aa	If your computer has a TV out jack on the video card, you could play your videos full-screen at 600x800 and record them with a VCR / DVD recorder. There might be a little more loss of quality this way than if you converted the videos to the DVD format on the computer and burned a disc with a DVD writer. If you have a desktop, DVD writers are very inexpensive now and very easy to install. The easiest, most foolproof way would be to remove your old drive, set the jumper on the new drive the same way and use the same cables to hook it up.    http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...    You could go with a USB drive... http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...
j4erzRM2aa	okay, i know exactly what you mean.    you can buy a phone from other carriers, and then get the phone UNLOCKED, which means that the phone will now accept any SIM. carriers usually lock their phones so that they can only accept SIMs from them, but unlocking allows the phone to accept any SIM. you can get this done at a cell phone/electronics store, or online. otherwise, you can buy a phone DIRECTLY from the manufacturer. this is often better as you dont have to look for a place to unlock your phone, and usually comes with a warranty as well.    hope i helped. if you need any clarification dont hesitate to email me. (you can email me from my profile page)|`|vGCetYmAaa	i love sims but i don't think that's what your talking about is it!|`|VpfSbqhVaa	Yes you can switch the sim card, the are usually underneath the battery.You just slide them out and replace them. But unless you have an unlocked cell phone (most are not,you'd know if you had one) you can't switch carriers.|`|8XS7xeiXaa	the only way you would be able to use a t-mobile phone with verizon wireless is if the phone was "unlocked" which means it can be used for almost any type of cell phone coverage.|`|IueVJbtraa	verizon doesnt have simcards only thing yiou can transfer is your number
Xxviy63Paa	First you must understand that video capture is processing-intensive. It's not a simple thing like taking a screenshot.    The least processor-intensive would be to encode it to MJPEG at a low framerate. With most other codecs you have to have a framerate of at least 24 fps.    If you use Fraps, which is a free program, you might get a bit better result from less intensive processing, but it's also a fairly limited program that doesn't do a lot.     The basic problem isn't software though. It's that you need a really powerful pc, not just gpu but cpu, to be able to capture game video on the fly at the same time as your pc is creating the video. Modern games like Counter Strike are designed to get the most out of your video card, when you record it also, you are turning around and asking your video card for 120% of what it's capable of, rather than the 95% that counterstrike demands of it.     The best and quickest way to improve capture is to reduce the resolution. If you're trying to record smooth gameplay at HD resolutions, forget it, you probably don't have the necessary pc hardware to do it. Reduce res to 640x480. That's only 1/4 as many pixels as in 720p resolution.     Another thing you could do is record the audio separately, on a handheld voice recorder, digital camera, vcr... then after the video is captured, run the audio back into your pc and capture it, then mix the tracks. Capture is processing-intensive, editing is not.    Finally, you're probably gonna have to deal with having some lag, no matter what.    Unless you get some other hardware, such as a 2nd pc, or a dvd recorder, or a better video card with dedicated hardware encoding.|`|LB9TPDWGaa	use fraps. its the best game recorder. BUT the file size does get pretty big (need a fair bit of space for long records). All you need to do though is convert it with a converter and it becomes a reasonable size.

It shouldn't need to be 3 years though, as long as you have some utility bills at that address, and some sort of photo-id, you should be fine.    EDIT: If they have gone as far as the credit check then it's not the phone companies themselves refusing you, it's the credit comanies they use. Not a lot you can do about that, other than get someone else to get the phone for you, on the understanding you will pay the bill.|`|e9f5dcec520cd586cd97f18b437a1c4baa	why not look at something like the Flext t-mobile (sim-only tariffs).

I recently read an article that stated that a poll taken of consumers for Wii fit, most had used it for about two weeks before putting it away for good.  Anything that gets you up and moving is great, but most people don't want to work, and so buying yet another device isn't the solution.

676XZjUYaa	If your Wii is in the same room as your router, then the signal shouldn't be too weak. Wireless router signals usually travel about 50 metres (just over 50 yards).<br>  <br>  If your Wii is in a different room to your router, then you might have other electrical interference going on.<br>  <br>  You have three options for connecting your Wii to the internet:<br>  <br>  1. Try to connect wirelessly to your router again following Nintendo's online step-by-step guide (<a href="http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/wii/en_na/connectingOnline.jsp?entryId=wRouter)." rel="nofollow">http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems...</a> Alternatively use Nintendo's Wireless Router Troubleshooting Guide to help adjust your router settings as this sometimes solves the problem (<a href="http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/wii/en_na/online.jsp)." rel="nofollow">http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems...</a><br>  <br>  If your router has been supplied by your internet company (this is quite common in the UK), then your internet company's customer support line might be able to help you. In my experience, they're pretty good at getting consoles to connect to the routers in the UK.<br>  <br>  2. If your Wii and router are in the same room, you could connect to your router using a LAN cable. You'll need to buy a specific Wii LAN Adapter to do this, but the connections are more reliable and faster than wi-fi (<a href="http://www.nintendo-wii-explained.com/wii-lan-adapter.html)." rel="nofollow">http://www.nintendo-wii-explained.com/wi...</a><br>  <br>  3. If your Wii and router are in different rooms, or you don't want to connect using a cable, you can use a wi-fi adapter. This plugs into your computer via USB and effectively shares your computer's internet signal with the Wii. This is designed to be used for modem internet connections, because the Wii cannot connect to the internet via a modem, but is should work if you're using a router (<a href="http://www.nintendo-wii-explained.com/wii-lan-adapter.html)." rel="nofollow">http://www.nintendo-wii-explained.com/wi...</a><br>  <br>  If you choose the Wii LAN Adapter and cable, there are some very good 3rd party adapters that come with a LAN cable included (the official Wii adapter doesn't come with a LAN cable so you may have to buy this too if you don't have one at home).<br>  <br>  If you go for a wi-fi adapter to share your computer's internet connection, then Nintendo's official wi-fi adapter has the best reviews.|`|oDvIxpbaaa	What kind of router do you have? It's not wireless, but you still want to connect to the Internet; you can purchase a adapter that connects the Wii to the Internet through a wired connection. Also, you can purchase a Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector, which turns your computer into a wireless hotspot.|`|VOSyb1fcaa	There are three ways to get Wi-Fi on your Wii. You can do it through a router (recommended), you can get a Wi-Fi USB<br>  (it's been discontinued, but can still be found) and put it in your computer's router, or you can use a LAN adapter. <br>  <br>  Look here for more information:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/wii/en_na/onlineRequirements.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems...</a><br>  <br>  Next, watch this video or simply follow my instructions below:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://us.wii.com/connect/" rel="nofollow">http://us.wii.com/connect/</a><br>  <br>  1. Click the Wii options button in the bottom left corner on your starting screen<br>  <br>  2. Choose wii settings<br>  <br>  3. Scroll to page 2 using the arrow on the right<br>  <br>  4.Click internet<br>  <br>  5.Choose connection settings<br>  <br>  6. Click on connection 1, 2 or 3<br>  <br>  7. Choose wireless connection (Or wired if you're using a LAN adapter)<br>  <br>  8. Click "search for an access points"<br>  <br>  9. Click OK<br>  <br>  10. Choose the from the connections your Wii has found (Look for your connection. You might have to provide some sort of password)<br>  <br>  If all goes well, you'll have to click OK a couple more times, wait for it to test the connection, then the Wii will reset itself and then you'll have internet!<br>  <br>  Good luck!

12zwullSaa	Hmm... odd, I've never had this problem before. Here are my initial guesses.<br>  <br>  <br>  1. Your system is old. You should consider getting a PS3.<br>  2. The laser reader inside the system might not be working correctly, if that's the case, then you can either send it in for repair, or buy a new one.<br>  3. The game. Pipe down PIPE DOWN. Ok, although the game is new, it could be a malfuntion in the game code. To test that is is the game, get a different "brand new" game, and put it in the system, and try playing it, if nothing happens, it was obviously the game, if the same thing happens, it was the system<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|dthpLcVbaa	How about a new one?

sMNEooBVaa	Why don't you try ebay, more people use it. Other than that, I don't know?|`|3BGJETHYaa	Because 500$ is a lot of money, and your junk isn't new anymore.  You could probably sell the wii sports type bundle for 200$ tops, and the rest for maybe 100$|`|jKc7aDCwaa	If you have Craigslist in your area, try there. I'm not sure if Kijiji is more popular than CL in Canada, but there's always tons of Wii buyers and sellers on CL and not nearly as many on Kijiji here in the states yet. You might also consider selling the Wii and rest of the games separate, as some people can't afford a package deal but are willing to at least go for the basic Sports package for CAD 285-315, even used. If you can wait 3 days, I'd put it up as a package on eBay for 1 or 3 days as opposed to 7 if you don't mind the hassles of writing up an auction and shipping and eBay taking their cut.<br>  <br>  What are all the extras besides what you've listed? Extra remotes and nunchucks are pricey and do matter. <br>  On what you've listed, If you sell it on CL, I'd ask for U$500 or best offer and be willing to take U$400-450 on it.

g8HVHqPuaa	If you pay the early termination fee AT&T will not report it to the credit bureau. If you decide to just not pay the bill then, yes, it will hurt your credit because after 60 days of non payment, you account will go to collections. I work for Sprint and I know AT&T works the same way. Also, if you do not cancel and don't make your payments it will be hard for you to get a cell phone through another provider without paying a high deposit. I would reccomend paying the early termination fee (probably around $200) and move on. Keep in mind that if you are going to switch providers, do not cancel with AT&T if you want to keep your number. Have the new provider port your current number over and that will automatically terminate your contract with AT&T and they will bill you for the termination fee.|`|AA10110131	THE CREDIT BUREAUS WILL NEVER EVEN KNOW ABOUT IT, UNLESS YOU DON'T PAY THE TERMINATION FEE.

c1sRWiX3aa	Yes, you just put it on the top. All 360s, including the Arcade, have the port to accept the hard drive already built in.<br>  <br>  In fact the only differences between the Arcade and the Pro are:<br>  <br>  1) The Pro comes with a hard drive and the Arcade doesn't<br>  2) The Arcade has a 'white' tray and the Pro has a 'chrome' or silver one<br>  3) The Arcade comes with a memory card or, if you get a newer one, with built in memory.<br>  <br>  To be honest if you're looking to get a 360 right now I'd lean towards an Arcade. If you get a 'newer' Arcade you have a much better chance of getting the 'Jasper' chip versus the Falcon. Not that the Falcon chip is bad, but the Jasper is smaller and is designed for even fewer failures. You can get an Arcade and a HD for about the same price (if not a little cheaper) than the Pro and have a more reliable machine.|`|5LmPjHPxaa	Yes u can but one separate but it will be more expensive then just buyin the regular 60GB xbox 360. so u should of just bought that|`|vemSTfwAaa	i think u just buy the xbox hd from a store and just snap it on the top. i think the arcade has some kind of covering where the hard drive should go so you might have to remove that before you can add the hard drive. check the manual

They'll have to make the Wii 2 sometime soon, probably 2010-2012 as well.<br>  Playstation 3- was made in the same year as the Wii, 2006. Sony designed it though to last for 10 years! Meaning it will still be around and popular in 2016.<br>  <br>  The PS3 amazing. It has better reliability, can be turned into a PC and download Windows XP or Vista, or for free download Linux. For everything that it has, it is much cheaper then the Xbox 360, consider the following.<br>  With the PS3, you get:<br>  -A Blue-Ray player, and one of the best ones out so far. It is also considered new technology. If you don't have Blue-Ray players to start out with when buying the PS3, it also has a DVD upconverter, meaning that you can play normal DVD's with better quality picture.<br>  -The PS3 also features PSN( the (P)lay(S)tation (N)etwork). It's free to use, and download demo's such as Warhawk, and Home. Unlike Xbox Live, it doesn't cost $80 for the first year bundle, and $50 for each following year.<br>  -The PS3 has exlusives like no other console, like Resistance 2, LittleBig Planet, Motorstorm: Pacific Rift, Metal Gear Solid 4 and in the future: inFamous, Killzone 2, God of War 3, Uncharted 2, L.A. Noire, Heavy Rain and Massive Action Game (M.A.G.—in which over 256 players will be able to play on the same map at the same time)<br>  -For the money, you get 80GB of space, and only 60GB on the Xbox 360, USB mini drives can also be used from the 2.0 USB ports in the front of the PS3. It also has an easily removable HDD.<br>  -Built in, superior Wi-Fi<br>  -Web browser, just like a PC's<br>  <br>  On the Xbox 360's you get a 1 in 3 failure rate. Even though Microsoft knows of this problem, they don't even think about the red rings of death while shipping it out to unsuspecting customers<br>  <br>  So here’s a quick run-down of what you must buy with the PS3 and 360:<br>  <br>  PS3:<br>  Console(there will be a $100 decrease in April 2009) $300<br>  Game $60<br>  Controller $55<br>  Total: $415<br>  <br>  Really, if you bought all the things the PS3 offers SEPERATELY, you would be able to buy roughly 3 PS3's with that money (gaming console+computer+SUPERB Blu Ray player)<br>  <br>  Xbox 360:<br>  Console $300<br>  Game $60<br>  Controller $60<br>  Xbox Live $80<br>  Wi-Fi $100<br>  Total: $660<br>  <br>  As you can see, the PS3 is cheaper by far and plus, The multi-platform games are using about 25% of the PS3's graphical potential. So that means much better graphics in the future when they can get a grip on the PS3's power.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, most multiplatform games are using about 98% of the 360’s potential. And they look about the same. At this rate in 1 year, the PS3 will have outshone the 360 graphic wise. It’s just that the 8-core Cell Broadband Processor is very complex, and takes developers time to get used to. And they are getting the hang of things. The PS3 has a very good reliability rate: only 0.2% failure rate (note the decimal), while Xbox 360's have a 30% failure rate. So, for every 1000 of both consoles produced, 2 PS3's are defective, whilst about 330 Xbox 360's are defective. The numbers speak for themselves. Many game developers have OPENLY stated that in the near future, and right now, they will use the PS3 as a lead-developing platform, and then they will port the games to the 360.<br>  <br>  So pretty much, the PS3 wins hands down. It's the best system people have seen yet! The PS3 will also progress in the future, like it's downgraded because it was so good that other people couldn't afford it. So anyways hope I helped!|`|VcNHahtgaa	PROS:<br>  PS3 -<br>  1. Free Online, keeps getting better. Soon to match Xbox Live.<br>  2. Full 1080p resolution<br>  3. Built In Blu Ray<br>  4. Cheaper HardDrives to Add [320GB for $80]<br>  5. Comes with a USB device to charge your Controller.<br>  6. Internet Browser<br>  7. Home and Life have a lot of potential to get better, FREE also.<br>  8. Browse Youtube with "TV" option. [Only Wii + PS3 have this]<br>  9. Might make a deal with Blockbuster to make something similar to Netflix with 360.<br>  10. 0.2% chance of failing. Most consumer products have a 2% fail rate.<br>  <br>  Xbox360-<br>  1. Netflix.<br>  2. 3 year warranty<br>  <br>  CONS:<br>  PS3 -<br>  1. New PS3's can't play PS2 games<br>  2. 1 year warranty<br>  3. Cost $150 to fix it if passed your 1 year warranty.<br>  <br>  <br>  Xbox360 -<br>  1. 33% fail rate meaning you can't play it and if you want to fix it you have to send it to microsoft for them to fix it and you will get it back approx. 3 WEEKS and has 33% of it failing again [PS3 has 0.2%]<br>  2. Pay for online gaming $50 a year<br>  3. Have to buy many add ons<br>  4. Buy a recharger for controllers.<br>  5. Cost more for HardDrive [60GB $100]<br>  6. Buy Wifi [$100]<br>  <br>  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>  <br>  If you buy the $199 Xbox 360, you will HAVE to buy the Hard drive which costs $100 which will be equal to the $299 one. If you want to play online also, you have to buy a Wifi Adapter for $100. After that, you have to buy a recharger for your controller which costs about $30-40 for only 1 controller.<br>  <br>  Xbox 360 also had this thing called "RROD" which will break your Xbox 360 and you have to send it to Microsoft for them to fix it. It takes about 3-4 weeks for them to fix it. The RROD happens in about 33% of all 360's and it happens from overheating, which means playing it too long. The PS3 only had 0.2% chance of breaking.<br>  <br>  <br>  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>  <br>  Exclusives that Xbox 360 lost to PS3:<br>  <br>  1) Lost Planet<br>  2) Bioshock<br>  3) Saint's Row 2<br>  4) Condemned 2<br>  5) Vampire Rain<br>  6) Haze<br>  7) FEAR<br>  8) Oblivion<br>  9) Two Worlds<br>  10) Sacred 2<br>  11) Overlord<br>  12) ArmA 2<br>  13) Blazing Angels: Squadrons of WWII<br>  14) Enchanted ARMS<br>  15) Eternal Sonata<br>  16) Enemy Territory: Quake War<br>  17) TimeShift<br>  18) Kingdom Under Fire 2<br>  19) Doom 4<br>  20) Omikron 2<br>  21) Postal 3<br>  22) Unreal Tournament<br>  23) Ninja Gaiden<br>  24) Dead Rising<br>  25) Left 4 Dead<br>  26) Mass Effect 1 & 2|`|YI8V5e36aa	Ps3.... and people should know by now the ps3 is better... its better built... only a 1-2% fail rate... as compared to the 360 which is 30-33% fail rate.. <br>  <br>  Plus ps3 has  blu ray which is goning to be the standard eventually.<br>  <br>  Ps3 free online, wifi built in, also has a web browser... xbox360 has none of that<br>  <br>  Ps3 has the best controller of any system ever! <br>  <br>  And we have KILLZONE 2|`|HekFanRvaa	The asker just said CHOOSE.. not to tell why.. you xbox fanboys are so hot about this question...so just say PS3 or XBOX..

I believe the PS3 has a higher overall potential that it has not even come close to YET.  The 360 has a much better online gaming experience right now, but I can imagine the PS3 network will improve in the future.  If you are looking for a well developed system now get the 360, if you want a system that has massive future potential but is average now get the PS3.  Seems to me the PS3 has more room and capabilities for upgrading where the 360 does not.|`|bU5QgsrKaa	FIRST OFF XBOX WILL REALSE THERE NEXT SYSTEM IN 2011-2012 AND XBOX 360 IS TRULY AMZAING THE FALIURE RATES ARE BETWEEN 5%-7% BUT THE REPAIR IT FOR FREE SHIP FOR FREE AND HAVE XBXO LIVE.<br>  <br>  <br>  P.S.

It's an excellent phone! The touchscreen rocks, and the QWERTY keyboard is excellent! Especially if you are a big fan of texting, this will help a lot!

Blackberry Storm is very cool too!|`|xs9otFWEaa	LG Dare: My friend has it, and she loves it. If you like to text a lot, I wouldn't recommend it. <br>  <br>  Touch Screen Blackberry: Its a great phone, and the touch screen works very well, but all blackberries are mostly for business, so if you'ree into that type of thing, get it! If your not, don't.<br>  <br>  Glyde: Just DON'T get it!! I've had three friends that got it, every single one brought it back!

It might be a little expensive, but its totally worth it !<br>  <br>  Good luck,<br>  <br>  Rebecca (:|`|RuHnw3MSaa	Voyager! my friend has the dare and the touch screen on it sucks. the blackberry storm is pretty confusing and same with the dare, the touch screen ain't so good.

Then my cousin has the glide and the touch screen on that goes so quick.  After like a month you will have to click each button like 3 times to get it to work.  get the voyager!|`|4cMuedpWaa	Blackberry Storm, definitely a Top Notch phone.
FxnBTOSlaa	Make sure you didn't accidentally turn off the "SteadyShot" mode.  <br>  <br>  When you are shooting pictures, look at the display.  In the upper middle portion of the display, there should be an icon of a hand with vibrations to the left and right of it.  It should say "ON" over the hand, if the "SteadyShot" mode is on.<br>  <br>  Changing the "SteadyShot mode is accessible through the MENU button.<br>  <br>  The manual for the DSC-T20 is on the link below.
yFDUecOPaa	I'm guessing what you're looking for is less "lag" when you're taking a picture, the time between when you press the button and when the picture takes. Older point and shoot digital cameras have the annoying tendency to miss the action because there is too much shutter lag.<br>  <br>  Many small point and shoot cameras now have a "kids and pets" mode that speeds up the camera response time. Look for this feature in your next camera.<br>  <br>  Some more detail:<br>  Shutter lag is the time between when you press the button and when the picture is taken. Shutter speed is the amount of time the the lens is "open", letting light onto the sensor. A slow shutter speed will create a blurry image (like this picture of my dog: <a href="http://www.little.org/blog/2009/02/08/ThisIsGoingToTakeSomePractice.aspx)" rel="nofollow">http://www.little.org/blog/2009/02/08/Th...</a> while a fast shutter speed will freeze the action but requires a brighter subject.<br>  <br>  Why is there shutter lag?<br>  Before you take a picture the camera must do several things: focus, set the aperture, set the shutter speed, set the white balance and, most importantly, charge the camera sensor. With a point and shoot camera this all takes place when you push the button down. You can reduce the number of missed shots but getting ready to take the picture early, holding the button partway down so it focuses (usually the camera will give a little beep when ready). Say your daughter is about to jump in the pool, before the jump even starts, aim the camera, push the button slightly, then say "go". Keep the button partway down until the jump then push the rest of the way.<br>  <br>  If you are taking a lot of action shots, you really need to step up to a digital SLR. SLR digital cameras are constantly monitoring everything while they are turned on and have much higher quality sensors, making the shutter response time nearly instantaneous.<br>  <br>  Cameras.co.uk has an excellent table comparing the shutter lag on a bunch of cameras. The model names listed are European model names, but a web search for a given brand and model will tell you the name for your country: <a href="http://www.cameras.co.uk/html/shutter-lag-comparisons.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cameras.co.uk/html/shutter-la...</a>

RZ4F43GZaa	ur ipods broken- mine did the same thing so got it changed|`|8PmgWto5aa	I hate when that happens. The best thing to do to prevent it though when you get a new set is to not turn the volume up so loud. Usually that's what causes it to stop working.|`|ZN5bBNevaa	change it for another one|`|sDHyQhktaa	Double check to make sure the headphone jack is free of any junk/dust. <br>  Otherwise, if you've tried it with many different headphones and it still had a problem then call Apple or bring it to the Genius Bar in their retail stores.<br>  <br>  I hope it's under warranty.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|LSXdwRDUaa	plug the headphone all the way in. or maybe your headphone is broken.|`|dWFyBJSKaa	broken ???? duh|`|Q7AAi2hNaa	Check your settings there might be something in there to do with sound. <br>  If not i would send it back ..

vEDWpmz7aa	yes you can put it in pocket. but you should be careful about it falling out..I've had mine almost fall in the toilet a few times because of that haha. I often put mine in my front pockets, alto it fits a little awkward it can be done. The screen locks itself or you can hit the button to lock it so it won't be doing anything in your pocket. There are a lot of things that come on the phone like an application about the weather, google maps with GPS, calculator, iTunes, web browser..There are a ton of cool apps you can download from the app store that are FREE and some paid too of course..I have myspace, AIM, some fun games, an app that finds movie theatres and listings...etc etc|`|cZmZDDbiaa	yes, you can lock it<br>  it is slim, do u can put it in ur pocket<br>  only a finger can select stuff, so it wont call people<br>  you can get maps, diarys, games calenders and loads morer on the iphone

c1c3f15d1b507986be998c3d578230b9aa	Make sure that the camera mega pixel setting is at least 3 MP.  Low light conditions can also cause grainy pictures.<br>  <br>  What gives a camera its picture quality?  <br>  It is mostly the skill of the photographer that produces high quality pictures. The lens and camera are very important, but the ability to set the scene, adjust the cameras settings, and hold the camera very still or use a tripod with auto or remote shutter actuation when required is what gets the great pictures.  Megapixel resolution is about potential photo size, not picture quality.<br>   <br>  Lots of great camera tips in these two links. <a href="http://www.danscamera.com/Learning/going_digital/#resolution" rel="nofollow">http://www.danscamera.com/Learning/going...</a> ...<br>  <a href="http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.jhtml?pq-path=38/10468/6368/333&pq-locale=en_US" rel="nofollow">http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.j...</a> ...<br>  <br>  The camera firmware may have been corrupted.  Digital cameras reset to original settings if batteries are removed for one minute.  Time varies with function and camera.  Also, look for firmware updates on the Sanyo website.<br>  <br>  CAUTION   To prevent memory card corruption, keep batteries charged and don't delete. Wait for lights to stop flashing then turn camera off before removing memory.  For card readers, double click Safely Remove Hardware.  Select, then click Stop and OK.<br>   <br>  Focus with shutter button halfway down before taking pictures.  In low light, focus on a lighted object at same distance as subject.  To prevent low-light, motion-blurred pictures; use flash "on" (not auto) up to 12 feet or place camera on a tripod or table and use self timer.  Check camera shooting modes for special situations.  Best light for photos is outside at early morning or evening.<br>   <br>  CAUTION   Do not overcharge!  Batteries can be damaged.  Use an automatic two or more hour Energizer Compact smart charger with temperature monitor, trickle charge technology, and safety timer ($9.76) at Walmart.  Use pre-charged 2000mAh Duracell ($12.97) or RayOVac ($5.97) batteries (both hold charge one year) and a full cycle charge. To preserve battery charge, use the viewfinder.<br>   <br>  In new cameras, look for a viewfinder (LCD invisible in bright sun), optical image stabilizer, and check battery prices.  High mega pixel settings take longer to process and may not be needed unless required for very large pictures.  Maximum print size for a 3 mega pixel setting is 8 x 10 inches.

However a few other possibilities exist.  If you are setting the resolution very low and viewing or printing at a relatively high magnification, you will start to pixelate, which appears like grain.  Also, take some pictures in good daylight with it set to auto iso or iso 100.  If your pix still look bad, you may have a defective camera.|`|AA11464317	Grainy pictures can be caused from insufficient light entering the lens to make the photo. That can be from the flash being off when it should be on, or by the ISO number being set too high. Read the manual and set everything to the default factory settings if you can. Put all the settings to automatic to start with and see if pictures improve.
eEyL9b4faa	I think its probably broken, if its a really old Ipod. If the people at the apple store can't help, you should just get a new Ipod. Like the Ipod Touch. ;)
5AnA0MLTaa	Some stuff stays on your gamercard/GT such as gamerpics but the rest will have to be transferred to the newer hard drive using a transfer. These transfers are sold by Xbox and usually come with the newer hard drives. If not, you could call Xbox and make them send you one for free. BUT, you could also get a memory card and transfer everything 1 by 1.|`|RpCwfcRzaa	When you buy the 120 GB drive it comes with a data transfer cable that will move your content over. The 60 doesn't come with one and even though Microsoft says the cable will work on it, most people have a 50/50 chance of it working. Some get it to transfer without any issues while others can never get it to work for some reason. I suggest that if you get a 60 GB hard drive get a memory card and use that to transfer your data. All you need to move is your saves and profile. Any extra game content like maps packs and expansions that you bought from the Live Marketplace can be re-downloaded from there free of charge.|`|CUUjvakpaa	no u could just chance everything to the new hard drive even your gamertag
nQ7G1nBVaa	You need to ask the remote manufacturer, do a code search, or get a different remote that can learn.
3CJAUyqPaa	Most regular DVD players cannot handle .avi or .wmv or .mov or many other file types that are computer-readable-only files. This includes your xbox. Just because you got a file on a blank DVD does not make it useable by a DVD player.<br>  <br>  Most regular DVD players need a specific file type - VOB - in order to read the file. Generally, file converters and other video editing applications don't format straight to DVD-readable format. Some do - but you have provided us with no details.<br>  <br>  The easiest way to get *there* from where you are is to use a DVD authoring application. There are bunches out there. One example is WinDVD.<br>  <br>  The DVD authoring tool lets you set up menu buttons so you can jump to a certain part of the disc (scene selection), add a background image or video to the menu button area and add a sound track - then, when you click burn, the menu, buttons, meny background and video will be rendered frame by frame, along with the audio, in the appropriate format for the DVD player to read. In your case, this will allow you to select a specific episode.<br>  <br>  The resulting VOB video file format with be a standard definition video file format the DVD player can deal with. Single layer blank DVDs can hold up to 4.7 gig of information which represents 120 minutes of standard definition video. Double layer blank DVDs can hold up to 8.5 gig of information which represents 240 minutes of standard definition video. I usually reduce the time allowed to 110 minutes for single layer and 230 minutes for double layer to leave room for menuing, background image and sound track and scene selection space. I know a whole season won't fit on a single layer disc - I don't think an entire season will fit on a single double layer disc, (in this VOB format) either...<br>  <br>  Standard definition video is standard definition video - it does not matter if it is animated or a movie. Hopefully, that AVI you are working with has not had its video compressed a lot. If so, decompressing and putting in VOB format and playing on a large screen through your DVD player will result in poor video quality. When the video compression was applied, video information was discarded - and the result is reduced video quality. If the AVI file contains lightly compressed video, then you should be OK when this renders to the VOB format.|`|0nAhDKRYaa	DVD format is VOB, you have to convert your video to DVD compatible video at first, otherwise standard DVD player can not read and play it. If you don't know how to do that, I'd recommend this all-in-one DVD Creator to you, I always use it to convert and burn movie to DVD to play on my home TV, it's easy to use and works pretty well, if you are interested in it, here is a step by step guide about how to use it.<br>  <a href="http://www.reviewstown.com/how-to-burn-avi-divx-movie-to-playable-dvd.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.reviewstown.com/how-to-burn-a...</a><br>  Hope it helps, email me if you need further help or use <a href="http://www.ask.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.ask.com</a> to search for more answers.

Nr8ap8khaa	in there contract it states programming prices and channels are subject to change. <br>  <br>  If it was 2 years ago you probably are not in a commitment but Dish Network is the best about the price changes and DirecTV does the same only there price increase happens after Dish's and Cables prices are always going up. <br>  <br>  there are lower packages you can get and ways to save money by signing up for autopay and stuff like that.|`|NGSax7ejaa	Dish again, sticking it to the customer.<br>  As the other answer stated, down grade your package, but your are already at the lowest without sacrificing a lot of channels.<br>  Check into what would be your cost to cancela nd return their eauipment. They may even send you a box and pay for their equipment to be returned. <br>  Trust me, pay them off and switch now. Do not do like I did and tuff it out for over 2 years hoping for a change for the better. It will not happen with Dish Network.
vBVyn2Iaaa	i am an experienced camera (video and still picture) user. i have an slr (canon rebel) and a sony vx1000 for skate videos. 2.8 fps is ok, but it depends on what you are doing. if you want to capture a flip trick down stairs, its a hit or miss type of thing. if you want a grind, its usually able to capture a decent picture. anything else is a 50-50 chance(no pun intended :)) i say, go for it. you can always move up, but that probably wont be a while for most. if you think you'll need a good camera in a short period of time, save your money for a basic slr.. you can get them at Sears right now for less than $500, and they come with a nice lens. good luck, and happy skating!!!

4a4795e43d693be3aa7146aa0989ea2daa	The seller must have a good reputation or have his own store so you can return it if it malfunctions.<br>  <br>  There should logically be nothing wrong with a refurb phone. What happens is that batches of brandnew phones may fail the final quality control phase of production for a minor glitch or something, then it goes back to be fixed. That batch becomes tagged as 'refurbished" but it can be as good as brand new.<br>  <br>  Other reasons why a brand new phone is sold as second hand phone or as refurb<br>  1. The phones that are given as "free" in promotional gimmicks by cellphone providers are considered inferior by the end users so they trade these phones for the better quality/more features phone.<br>  2. The owners were given these phones as gifts and they hate the color, shape, brand etc and trade it/exchange it for a nicer looking phone.<br>  3. most common reason- the owners are Asian. Asians like the newest phones out of every cellphone user I know. So they are inclined to trade a perfectly good phone for the newest cell toy in the market. SIgh...<br>  <br>  Just be sure you have a <br>  1. guarrantee<br>  2. return policy<br>  3. a solid businessperson and store front<br>  4. a techie there that you like and trust|`|8ARUamgCaa	Usually a refurbished phone will be better because they do extensive testing of the phone before sending it back out.  It is basically an old phone that gets a new body and all of the things are tested to see if they need to be replaced.

05uraLcQaa	The Mogul, even though it is discontinued and cannot be bought in stores, would probably still be in stock with Asurion (the wireless insurance carrier)as a refurbished model. you could try calling Asurion (1800 584 3666) and just ask if you lost or broke your mogul, what phone you would get as a replacement. i have done this a few times and they have told me, just try not to give them any information and when they ask you for your phone number, just say you have a quick question.<br>  <br>  Once the mogul is out of stock with Asurion, the most comparable model would probably be the HTC Touch Pro (slide out keyboard and Windows software just like the mogul) but right now its still brand new and i doubt they would give you one right now. <br>  <br>  i do know that by the middle of april (you should have gotten a letter through the mail) they are upping the deductible for smart phones from $50 to $100, so if you can wait, dont wait till past that time or it will cost you twice as much!<br>  <br>  i hope this helps|`|fdlhUxzRaa	it depends on what is comparable and on the market at the time the device gets broken. Are you planning on breaking it any time soon?|`|g8HVHqPuaa	Yes, the mogul has been discontinued, but more than likely they still have refurbished ones they use for replacement purposes. Even when you pay the $50 deductible (if the phone is damaged beyond repair) you will probably be sent a refurb phone. Now if the warehouse is out of refurbished moguls, they will give you the next model up at no extra charge.

It's alright, but it's lacking in some major areas. You can't take video, it doesn't have turn-by-turn GPS, and the keyboard is AWFUL! Other than that, it's not too bad. The web browser is great and the App Store is awesome, especially because some of the Apps are only available for the iPhone. My girlfriend has this bad habit of pressing mute with her face when she's on the phone though...that is super annoying!<br>  <br>  I'd say try it for a few weeks, especially if you're already an AT&T customer. Then, if you don't like it, return it and get something else. You really have to try the phone in real life situations to see if it will work for you.|`|LSXdwRDUaa	I had used the iphone 3g unlocked though for t-mobile i sued for about 1 month and stopped using it.<br>  Even though it popular, it has some bad side to it . Like keyboard, battery camera isn't good. No video too.<br>  E-mail is ok and The internet is Excellent<br>  But I would recommend the Blackberry Bold if you want e-mail and internet. <br>  It may not be Touch screen, but the keyboard is just excellent and the e-mail is just perfect.<br>  The  Internet is the same but   it is going to be on a smaller screen. <br>  The Iphone is more of a fun type. due to  the app store and other stuff<br>  But i would recommend the Blackberry 8900(Tmobile) or the blackberry Bold(sprint)|`|PNxk3aR6aa	What? The iPhone 3g has the best web browser than any other phone out there. It's fast, and I always have 3G service anywhere I go in my area (CA, OC) . <br>  <br>  Don't forget to jailbreak it (youtube it for more info one what more it can do).|`|cEIpOQAKaa	My friend has that phone, and its pretty nice..but she said she doesnt like to text a lot now because its hard to w/ the touch buttons.|`|2uZivThaaa	Okay honestly I worked for ATT, and sold the iphone. A lot of people had problems with the device. And many people were upset that it didn't have a video camera or picture messaging. Plus there is a way to put that stuff on your iphone but it requires messing with the programs which i wouldn't suggest. What i would go with would be the samsung eternity which is a million times better than the iphone! plus with the iphone 3g it requires a 2 yr $30 data package that you cannot take off until you get rid of the phone, when the eternity only requires a $15 data package for internet surfing ALSO you can insure the eternity and the iphone you cannot. plus the iphone has a 14 day return policy with a restocking fee and the eternity has 30 return policy with no restocking fee. <br>  <br>  plus check out www.phonescoop.com and www.wireless.att.com for more reviews on the phone <br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|CsIvy5MAaa	The Iphone is pretty good, but there are generally better phones out there that cost less. If you like the Iphone, go with what you like.<br>  <br>  Why not go to an AT&T store and ask to test out a live model? You can goto tmobile, verizon, etc and ask to do the same with their high end smart phones. Just see what works for you.|`|K0iFV73Gaa	I had an iphone, the charge I thought was normal.

Do you want a device that is intended to be used with some kind of console (8 in and 8 out)?  Would this be part of your price?  Digital or analog?  Do you want to be able to edit and mix the audio with the aid of a computer?  What other things are you going to add to these 8 tracks (MIDI, samples, software synthesizers)?  Is 8 tracks all you need TOTAL, or all you need to record at once?  <br>  <br>  There are way too many things you'd have to specify for me to give a decent answer, but that's OK.  These are the questions you need to think about for now, and then just start being an educated consumer.  Find the systems that have most of the features you want, then rate them by price, features, expandability, etc.  Try out as many as you can get your hands on.  Good luck.

Xxviy63Paa	If you're using a router, go into router settings (usually this means start a web browser and type 192.168.0.1, it might end in 1.1 instead) and go to LAN setup, or wherever it lists attached devices. With your ps3 online you should see it's MAC address, that's in the form xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx where each x is a hexadecimal digit. You can find your ps3's MAC address in the internet settings on the XMB. So you can see exactly what LAN address your router is giving your ps3. It will probably be something like 192.168.0.3, or .0.4, depending on how many other devices are online. Copy your ps3's MAC address then look for an option to reserve LAN address for specific devices. Netgear routers can do this, at least. type in the MAC address of the ps3 and the Lan address you want it to have, and apply the settings, and it should be done. If you picked a different address than the one it's online under right then, take it offline and back online, and it should have the address you reserved for it.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that this reserved LAN address is not the ps3's IP address. That is requested from your ISP's domain server by your router, which it then links to the LAN address. Every time you log on to a DHCP domain server, you will get one of several different IP addresses, it can be different each time. If your laptop, pc and ps3 are all online at once, the router gets them all different IP addresses. You don't have to make them different because they're never the same.<br>  <br>  If you're not using a router, you should. A hub or switch won't allow you to reliably have both your ps3 and pc's getting IP addresses from your ISP at once. You may have to logon with your pc, then switch the cable to your ps3. The best way without a router is to use a crossover cable to attach your ps3 to your PC, then set up a shared connection, which makes your pc act essentially as a router.|`|22qQjYcxaa	I hate Internet stuff.....:L

If you want to play a lot of games and get the Red Ring of Death, then go with the Xbox 360, and buy lots of add ons.

d8eb2747aa6627fe7a5b835a16139fa6aa	There is no way to convert a normal TV to HDTV.  TV screens, whether HD or regular, are physically constructed to show a specific number of lines of resolution.  There's no way to change that without swapping in a new screen.

dqzoEw67aa	As stated above, your tv is taking any signal it receives and upconverting it to 1080p, so you are seeing the 480 upconverted as all your tv can display is 1080p.<br>  <br>  SD just looks bad on HD tvs, but you should be able to get it to a 4:3 size with black bars on each side, and it will be clearer, by setting the tv size to 4:3 rather than 16:9, should be in the pic set up area of the main menu.<br>  <br>  And also, if you get an antenna, even rabbit ears, and you live close enuf to some broadcast towers, you can do a channel scan (instructions are in your owner's manual) and pick up local tv with many of the programs in HD for no cash out of your pocket, except for the antenna.|`|d8eb2747aa6627fe7a5b835a16139fa6aa	I have not heard of any such external device, except maybe a cable box you get from the cable company.  It's possible it may handle the conversion better then your TV.<br>  <br>  I had a Samsung 52" LCD for a couple of weeks last year until I traded it in for a plasma.  I think it's just a function of stretching a standard resolution TV signal that big.<br>  <br>  I know you are cheap, but if you want good quality TV watching on a big screen TV, suck it up and order the cable box and HD channels.  Trust me, it's worth it!|`|AA10594501	Your TV is doing the upconversion itself, as all HDTVs do. Some will do a better job of the upconversion than others. Samsung is generally one of the better ones.<br>  <br>  You're basically expecting too much. There's just not enough resolution in an analog SD signal for it to look good on a 52 inch TV. The best you can do is to keep the SD image in its normal 4:3 aspect ratio and don't zoom or stretch it to fill the screen. If your analog cable feed isn't too noisy, you may be able to improve the picture by increasing the sharpness setting on your HDTV.<br>  <br>  > i dont need a box for the channels i watch nor do i wish for HD channels<br>  <br>  Then why in the world did you buy a huge HDTV ???? You should have stuck with your analog TV.
jKc7aDCwaa	The Homebrew Channel looks for files named "boot.dol" or "boot.elf" in their respective application directories. All application directories should be under \apps on the root of the SD card. For example, if you had an application called "Widget", on the SD Card, it'd be at "(SD):\apps\Widget\boot.dol". If a boot.dol doesn't exist, you have to rename the extracted dol or elf file to "boot.dol" or "boot.elf".

qGfAlDd2aa	I had to look up Truckee on a map, it must be beautiful up there.<br>  <br>  The reason you are being offered Sacramento stations is that you live in the Sacramento-Stockton-Modesto DMA (Designated Market Area), which ends right at the CA / NV border (<a href="http://research.backchannelmedia.com/dma/show/Sacramnto-Stkton-Modesto?filter[dma_id]=862&filter[dma_rank]=&filter[region]=&filter[state]=&filter[timezone]=&filter[zipcode]=&page=1)" rel="nofollow">http://research.backchannelmedia.com/dma...</a> .<br>  <br>  By law, a cable or satellite company must offer you the local stations in your DMA and not import stations from other DMAs.  You would be offered the same choices from the cable company.  The only way to get around this is to have the local Sacramento stations sign a waiver releasing the Cable or Satellite company to give you something else.  Sorry, that's the FCC regulation.<br>  <br>  You could try to put up an outdoor antenna.  It looks like you should be able to get Reno stations over the air.  They will look better than cable / satellite anyway.  <a href="http://www.tvfool.com/?option=com_wrapper&Itemid=29&q=id%3ddef9b66236" rel="nofollow">http://www.tvfool.com/?option=com_wrappe...</a>|`|CvRscCrjaa	better sign up for cable instead. i would say rabbit ears but i know they wont work up there.

0bc482bea83a5e4c3c6925d5580560e3aa	You can connect any analog source to your sound card's Line Input connection but you will need a music or audio recording program to actually make the recording.<br>  <br>  If it's just speech, you can get a free program called CD-ex from download.com, which is both a CD Ripper and an Audio Recorder and use that.<br>  <br>  If it's music, I recommend a program I use called Magix Audio Cleaning Lab, available at Best Buy for about $40.  It not only lets you record analog sources into the computer, but after you're done you can use the program to clean up any audio deficiencies - tape hiss, record clicks, pops and crackling, and turntable rumble.  Then, you can use the mastering section to enhance the sound through compression/leveling, equalizing, and more, then either burn the finished project directly to a CD or export it as a new WAV, WMA, MP3 or OGG audio file.  I've used this program quite a bit over the last year to breathe new life into vinyl records that I've had for quite some time.|`|d0d33523d2f9652d0c41be54c44963acaa	yes there's a connection you can plug into a cassette player's headphone jack and a USB port.

It's hard to answer because the 2 consoles are not on an even playing field.  There's not enough PS3 available for purchase, so technically, the 360 has sold more because it was released over a year ago, so it has a 1 year lead on the PS3.  In Japan, the PS3 has already outsold the 360.  The only way to answer this question is 2 or 3 years down the road.  By then, there should be a leader because both consoles will be readily available for purchase.

It's a touchtone phone with smartphone/PDA capabilities, Wi-Fi, 2MP camera, and of course iPod features. Apple has been making revolutionary gadgets for quite some time now but I am unsure as if the iPhone will be a breakthrough as the popular and in demand, iPod. The 4GB will be priced at $499 and the 8GB at $599 "with" a 2-year contract. Bummer?! I say aye! Maybe an upgrade on the camera would boost sales for that price. It is also surprisingly thin like the iPods. With that many features and a slick slim design, it's sure to catch a lot of attention. The touchtone feature isn't appealing to me. The iPhone looks fragile but the widescreen LCD is tempting to the eye. If you plan on getting one, I'd suggest getting some kind of protection for it. I am not sure if it is compatible with iPod accessories though, don't expect.

I'm a light user so T-Mobile works great for me.  $100 refill gets you 1000 minutes which don't expire for a year.  That's $0.10/min.  The first $100 also gets you Gold Rewards status, at which point subsequent refills (regardless of the dollar amount) extend your expiration by one year.<br>  <br>  If you want free mobile-to-mobile, Cingular prepaid offers that option along with $0.10/min, but you pay $1/day on any day that you make or receive a call.  Their other prepaid plan (no $1 daily surcharge) runs $0.25/min, a bit pricy.<br>  <br>  Both of these providers offer rollover minutes.

You probably want a case, but that's probably it, unless you have a good amount of money. If you buy a case, you want one that protects the screen and the wheel. If you want more for your iPod, then you could buy a dock, so you could listen to the iPod without the headphones, you know, like speakers! I would recommend the iPod video 30GB. You can look at this website about the iPod video: <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/specs.html." rel="nofollow">http://www.apple.com/ipod/specs.html.</a> <br>  To download music, you can simply download iTunes for free on apple.com/itunes. iTunes is very easy to use too!

I had one of the iPod photo...<br>  2) You can buy refurbished iPods from the apple store or other online apple stores. I'm pretty sure that's where mine came from. It's better than getting it from eBay, because you can get warranties and such.<br>  3) Oink? (Pink? not important.)<br>  Yes, I would suggest you buy the newer nanos. The reason being that refurbished ones are old models, with the traditional flaws that are solved in newer models. My refurbished iPod was pretty crappy, it crashed after a year, it only worked on one computer, and I had alot of trouble with it when I first got it, which I managed to work out. The company sent me the wrong type of electrical adapter, etc, etc. It was a pain in the butt. Maybe this doesn't happen all the time, but I know I went through alot of trouble.<br>  <br>  Minis came in multiple colors. I've seen electric blue ones, green ones, and pink ones.

AA11619477	I think depending on your use of the ipod determines how long the battery lasts at anyone time. If you turn the brightness down to the minimal level and don't manually change tracks and if you put the hold switch on, it might actually last for 8-10 hours, but I noticed that if you flip back between the menus and what not or watch videos and stuff on it, it sucks the battery dry. Annoying, if you ask me. Mine might go for 2 or 3 hours at most while i fiddle with it and pick different songs to listen to.|`|61bd30cbec4af7d5d3726414c905d75caa	Yea they do suck but the new one are better|`|703ab6fa0143c3448bb965366dcc5d03aa	no only some

3bf33bb111e363abd63bec369ce557a3aa	Sure. Just don't throw it into ponds (although mine managed fine)<br>  A few drops haven't hurt my mp3 player (and I live in wet, wet, wet city). I usually carry it in my bag or in a pocket, and it seems to manage the occasional drop of rain all right, like when I'm looking for the right album. I have also used a lot it when I've been working outside (as a landscaper, gets dirty), and usually wrap it up in a clear ziplock bag before putting it in my pocket.|`|4935d160fa70f3acd078f52f659ce699aa	Yez is safe . . . . . no u wont get eletricuted or n e thing . . its kewl u should keep the mp3 player covered  cuz u dont want ur screen 2 mess up unless u have a cover 4 it then ur all gud|`|1dc20d941b875d7785ef3b97440561a8aa	Yes I do it all of the time!!<br>  <br>  Just put it in you pocket or just keep it covered to be safe.|`|61bd30cbec4af7d5d3726414c905d75caa	Yea it should be okay though its best to put in your pocket

eb8c02e625463b14e29d9c8eba9556eeaa	"Body only" means exactly that.  You will need add at least one lens and a memory card.  I DOUBT that it would exclude the battery, but you may even end up needing a battery.  That generally comes as part of the body.<br>  <br>  A good lens for your camera is the Nikon Zoom Super Wide Angle AF 18-70mm f/3.5-4.5G ED-IF AF-S DX Zoom-Nikkor Autofocus Lens, which they have for $310.  My wife has exactly this set-up - a D50 and this lens.  I liked the lens so much for the money that I bought one for my "backup" camera, a D70s.<br>  <br>  A 1 GB memory card is plenty, but get a 2GB for luxorious living, if you are so inclined.  It might make a difference to you if you are going on a trip and don't want to worry about taking too many pictures.<br>  <br>  1 GB Sandisk SD Ultra II - $40<br>  2 GB Sandisk SD Ultra II - $65<br>  <br>  I'm sorry that I can not include links to a retailer, as I have learned that this is in violation of the "No Advertising" rule on Yahoo! Answers, but you can easily find these things from several sources.|`|c5cf033b92622e4c4a96d7676d5bfd15aa	Another lens source is the used market.  www.keh.com is a reputabile company to deal with in buying used equipment.  I have the 18-55mm & 55-200mm DX lenses that came with the camera.  I like the 18-55 but would like it more if it were 18-70mm.  Those kit lenses are fairly inexpensive.|`|da6c9efbd4e8009c0e5c49eb5607fe6faa	Your right. Body only means only the camera itself.<br>  <br>  You can get the Nikkor 55-200mm for around 300AUS$ not sure where or how much in america. The Nikkor above has been designed for the D50 and comes in Silver or black to match the body of the D50. This seems to be the best multifunction lens I have come across for my uses- as I like to shoot outside (just be aware it is known to vingette a little bit at full zoom). <br>  <br>  If you are into indoor stills and things look for a 28mm or smaller.<br>  Bottom line is that the lenses you need to look at should be Nikkor (not many Tamron choices to suit the new DSLR's) newer lenses to suit the 9pin ring, and be digital compatible.<br>  <br>  There are lots of online shops- You can go to the Nikon website for stockists... or just look in your phone book for camera stores. They should all stock at least a few nikkor lenses.|`|f4360b1fc20ecc092a48c40fef6ce981aa	I live in NY, so, to avoid the taxes I usually order lenses from Onecall.com.  Their rates are competitive to BH Photo and they sell USA Warrantied equipment. You have to be careful with where you get your stuff.  If you buy something listed as 'gray-market' or something without USA, you cannot get it serviced here in the U.S.  Trust me, you don't want that headache.  If you aren't used to SLR camera's maybe you should try a Nikon Coolpix or something similar. Depends on how much you want to learn about SLR Photography. D50 isn't a difficult camera to use, but, it's not exactly a point and shoot either.
00b62a13b49d451df48cdfeebee51f61aa	I think yes, you can! Usually there is some kind of shipping services called outside of U.S which you may have to pick in case they don't ship to UK on normal shipping (U.S ground), but in this case you may need to pay more $ for this international shipping service (Outside U.S) if found...Otherwise and in all cases, if you have sombody in the U.S who can ship it to you wherever you are either by US regular mail or Fedex/DHL services then yes ship it within the states then he/she will forward it to you. P.S if this Itunes deal can be transfered online then sure you can but you should have some kind of accepted and guaranteed financial card.<br>  Hope This will help!|`|8d5f3a13b038dc415eab5c7dc469868faa	I almost bought tunes from France...if I can "almost" buy something on accident then you can definitely buy iTunes USA on purpose.|`|61bd30cbec4af7d5d3726414c905d75caa	Yes I don't see why not|`|2528ea6189535b3eb494bf608f987beaaa	I dont see why not

It can be 5 minutes long, 30 minutes long or even longer in some cases. You can download them from various websites but i tend to use itunes. You can get video podcasts which are just like audio podcasts but obviously with a video. My favourite is Best of Moyles because i think its hilarious. Its half an hour of the best bits from his radio show all week. Every week or day, it varies with each podcast, they will be downloaded (automatically if you use itunes) and straight to your ipod or mp3 player.

Usually file sharing follows the peer-to-peer (P2P) model, where the files are stored on and served by personal computers of the users. Most people who engage in file sharing are also downloading files that other users share. Sometimes these two activities are linked together. P2P file sharing is distinct from file trading in that downloading files from a P2P network does not require uploading, although some networks either provide incentives for uploading such as credits or force the sharing of files being currently downloaded.<br>  <br>  COPYRIGHT ISSUES<br>  File sharing (such as with the Gnutella and Napster networks) grew in popularity with the proliferation of high speed Internet connections, relatively small file size and high-quality MP3 audio format. Although file sharing is a legal technology with legal uses, many users use it to download copyrighted materials without explicit permission: copyright infringement or "piracy". This has led to attacks against file sharing in general from some copyright owners.<br>  <br>  There has been great discussion over perceived and actual legal issues surrounding file sharing. In circumstances where trading partners are in different countries with different legal codes, there are significant problems to contend with. What if a person in Canada wishes to share a piece of source code which, if compiled, has encryption capabilities? In some countries, a citizen may not request or receive such information without special permission.<br>  <br>  Throughout the early 2000s, the entire file-sharing community has been in a state of flux. In the year 2000, there was speculation over how seriously record companies and the Recording Industry Association of America would strike the file-sharing community because of its limits compared to more traditional forms of media [3]. However, the communities suffered strain as record companies and the RIAA tried to shut down as much of it as possible. Even though they have forced Napster and Grokster into cooperating against copyright violations, they are fighting an uphill battle since the community has flourished and produced many different clients based on several different underlying protocols. The third generation of P2P protocols, such as Freenet, are not as dependent as Napster is on a central server; and as they encrypt the shared data, it is much harder to shut down these systems through court actions. Another attempt (used by the maintainers of KaZaA) is to change the company's organization or country of origin so that it is impossible or useless to attack it legally. To date, file sharing in Canada is somewhat legal, though not completely so[4]. The uphill battle also extends to the legal actions taken by the RIAA and motion picture counterpart MPAA against individuals using file-sharing programs to distribute material protected by copyright. Ambiguity in the interpretation of copyright law has been a major factor contributing the lack of successful enforcement by the Intellectual Property owners. In Electra v. Perez for example, the Court ruled that the act of making such files available for distribution equated to infringement of the works involved. In the more recent UMG v. Lindor, Judge David G. Trager ruled that the RIAA would be required to prove that actual distribution (sharing) occurred. Should this case go to trial in 2007, it will likely set a precedent for further RIAA and MPAA actions.<br>  <br>  The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is a donor-supported group which seeks to protect and expand digital rights. Its activities include litigation, political lobbying, and public awareness campaigns. The EFF has vocally opposed the RIAA in its pursuit of lawsuits against users of file sharing applications and supported defendants in these cases. The foundation promotes the legalization of peer-to-peer sharing of copyrighted materials and alternative methods to provide compensation to copyright holders<br>  <br>

ZYudjSOOaa	I've had broadband over the last 7 years in this order: Cox Roadrunner, Verizon DSL, Adelphia, Verizon DSL, Adelphia/Comcast, & now Verizon FioS. Verizon's connectivity has always been reliable, but I've left them either because of a move or I've been lured away by faster speeds. I have no real use for download speeds over 8Mbps, but it is worth paying extra money to get higher upload speeds. In VA, Verizon charges $5 more a month to upgrade from 15/2Mbps to 30/5Mbps - it's worth it!<br>  <br>  FioS Pros - consistent speeds (www.speedtest.net gives more consistent results now than Adelphia/Comcast ever did) , better uptime than cable (only lost connectivity once - due to construction), and higher max speed (depending on area - I have 30Mbps down/5Mbps up for $55 per month).<br>  <br>  FioS Cons - HUGE wireless router/modem combo (twice the length of regular router), wireless router distance is poor (either that, or it doesn't handle interference from other wireless networks as well as my Linksys 802.11a/b/g does), battery backup must be installed on the line (mine barely fits inside my panel box), when connectivity is lost it most likely means you lose phone service also, Verizon charges a setup fee, setup time was 3 hours and mine was easy.<br>  <br>  I'm an extremely satisfied FioS customer, but EVERY service has its cons.|`|HOfrvC91aa	u get on demand so u can watch wat ever u want wen ever... its fiber optic|`|yzbG8823aa	nothing. fios is like 15mb but it is around 30 dollars a month which isn't bad.

You just dial the number, hit the call button (usually green) and it calls the number. Unlike regular telephones, there is no dial tone. So with a cell phone it could be said that you are "pre-dialing" the number before the actual connection, and then you tell it to connect. Which is good, especially if you accidentally hit the wrong number; you just delete it and get the number corrected before hitting the 'call' button. Whereas with a regular telephone...you are doing more of a real-time dialing and the dial tone can 'time out' on you if you take too long; because the connection is instant from the time you pick it up.|`|AA10172206	Cell phones are not supposed to have dial tones.|`|d3c07e6a3ca7a93f8106d7a54406bbd2aa	Are you blonde? Cell phones don't have a dial tone. But, if you mean you can't make a call, try going into settings and make sure line 1 is your default line. Sometimes it can get switched to line 2 by accident.|`|odjJCsLHaa	My cell phone doesn't have a dial tone you just dial the number and hit talk and it calls.. I have never had a cell phone that had a dial tone.  <br>  <br>  Do you mean cell phone or home phone?|`|tRBFEjVQaa	Call phones do not have dial tones, dear. If you mean when you call out you don't hear ringing, your service may be interrupted, or the person you're calling may be out of the area.

f4L6T2Lraa	You are not alone, my friend! I was lucky to snag the first shipment of Wiis in my county. I have lots of buddies who want one REALLY bad. Call your local game retailer (it can even be a Wal-Mart or a Target) and ask them when the next shipment is coming. If they say that they don't know, keep asking! They know, trust me. If you're lucky, you can pre-order one! Good luck!
