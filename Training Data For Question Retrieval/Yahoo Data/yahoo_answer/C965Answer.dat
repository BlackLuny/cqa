bcf61355e73f6ee7431554cec47483e6aa	Verlander because he is in a pitchers ball park and should win more games cause of a better offense this year.  Also he has gained the experience of a full major league season.|`|AA11605092	Definately keep Harden and Liriano (keep an eye on Lirianos return, I don't know an update, if he is ready for some time early in the season he is worth the risk.)    Stay away from Weaver/Verlander I think. They had a great year but hitters and scouts have an entire off season to study them, and believe me they will.    Garza, just no. No.    Sowers, too young and just a decent 2006, and a bad K/IP    McCarthy may be your best bet. The Sox were real high on him, however; they did give up on him for some reason. But he will have plenty of offense in Tex, and Harden, Burnett are injury pronee and Liriano had problems last year. McCarthy has potential and should pitch the whole year. Besides if you really like Sowers or Garza they should be available after a few rounds anyway I don't think they will be taken right away even in your keeper league.|`|83657de676e1f6d8d606554bef6db0e9aa	Personally, I would say throw out Garza, Sowers, and McMathry right away.    Liriano is a big question mark because of his injury. He may turn out to be a Mark Prior, which is not good.    Verlander was healthy all season and he is very young with star potential. He would be one of my keepers.    Harden, if healthy, is a very strong pitcher but the key words there are, *if healthy*    A.J. has had his ups and downs but he is the only pitcher on the list that has proven his worth year in and year out. He kind of reminds me of a Zito. He would be your safest keeper.    Jered Weaver is a stud. He has the stuff to really do something special. Whether teams have a year or 2 weeks to study him, I don't think there going to get very far with this kid.    So my three keepers: Verlander, A.J. Burnett, and Jered Weaver|`|9a448c82f7d9fb8a27fd3ed44a8e46c3aa	Keep Verlander for sure he is gonna have another great season!    Liriano might not be worth the keep because he is having Tommy Johns surgery. And some say he might pitch till mid season of 2007.    Garza, Sowers and McCarthy........... just NO!    Weaver is way too inconsistent so don't keep him.    Burnett is a good keep if he can stay healthy.    Harden is gonna be the Ace in Oakland now that Zito is gone so keep Harden.|`|AA11140798	In part depends on salary these guys would earn.  I'm not sure I'd keep most of these guys though even in a cbs league, unless it's at a VERY low salary.  Verlander and Weaver are the best bets of the group, but neither is a dominant pitcher.  Harden has the ability to be kept, but has a very strong injury risk.  Burnett is a bit less of an injury risk, but also not as high quality a pitcher.  The rest I wouldn't  consider.  Liriano will miss most if not all of the season.  No use for him counting against your salary cap or your roster.  of the others Garza has the most strikeout potential, Sowers is ok nothing special.  I like McCarthy, but he pitches in a park greatly favoring the hitter.  Any of those three could be redrafted.  I think I'd protect just one or two of those guys, and keep a closer and a bat instead.

AA11516886	throw like a girl.|`|AA12074189	There really is no correct way to hold the football. As long as it feels comfortable go with it. The QB at Ball State doesnt even throw with the laces.

Hold the laces correctly (I'm guessing you know how to do that).  2. Get a good wind-up, take a few steps back, really get your shoulder ready  3. Put you front arm out in front of you  4.

Best AL Hate to say it but Jeter  Worst NL Williamson or Wood  Best NL Pujols|`|54fedb472afdc6591dba12bdb652c9daaa	In the NL, as far as talent I'd have to go Hollandsworth as he is the least talented on the list.  But as far as production, then it goes to Scott Williamson who really didn't do anything after his rookie season, mostly do to injuries.      In the AL, I want to go two years earlier and pick Bob Hamelin-KC (absolute garbage).  But for players on the list, I'd have to pick Hinske as he is the least talented and had the least amount of production than any player on that list.|`|c4710b32c1b6c3341a412651b1812242aa	In the AL it goes to Kazuhiro Sasaki who was good for a total of two seasons, but blew the biggest save of his life to the Yankees, who went on to lose to the Diamondbacks back in 2001.  Second on that list is Ben Grieve, what's he doing nowadays?    Everyone else is pretty good players, to great players.    In the NL, I'd go with Williamson... I can't even tell you without looking it up what he's doing now.  But there are some awesome names on that list, he doesn't seem to fit.|`|gBkiFblqaa	Ben Grieve :  Below average fielder  and known for hitting into double plays.  runner up: Eric Henske    will he even get off the bench in Boston???????? not if former Oakland A's minor leaguer and current Sock Kevin Youkiles has anything 2 do with it!

2e6c8f664207d104bb43aebe68defb24aa	to me it sounds like your jumping away from your board or your kicking it away from you with your front foot...The key thing to doing kickflips is to kick your board down and out and that will make the board flip under you instead of away from you and your foot placement might be in the wrong place try changing up the way you plant your feet before trying the kickflip as that might help..I always have my front foot right under the bolt to my front truck and hanging half way off my board and the back is set up like i would be doing a normal ollie...|`|AA11125483	the one suggestion i can give you is to just try and stay over your board. it might take a while to figure out, but the trick is to lean forward if your having difficulties with the board flying out (it usually means your leaning back). once you have that down, try to suck in your feet so that the board can make the full rotation, and with alot of practice you'll land it, and if your lucky you might even be able to caught the board before it hits the ground (looks really cool when you land it). hope this helps.
GHl8Q0Iqaa	My guess is that if he doesn't start in the opener, he will at least get a pinch at bat. My guess is that he will be starting at DH by the end of April, if not earlier.|`|AA11225694	The Dallas Morning News reports manager Ron Washington still hasn't announced whether Sosa will be in the Rangers' opening day lineup. Other DH choices include Brad Wilkerson and Frank Catalanotto. When Sosa is in the lineup, he will bat fifth.      Sosa proved his doubters wrong this spring and opened some mixed-league eyes. Just don't get your expectations too high.|`|M1fKcrLKaa	i dont think he will start first game but if you have him on your team i suggest you get rid of him, he's not going to do well this year|`|p5Mac5t6aa	I think he will be their DH because of the possible power he would give them and he won't be a liability in the outfield...they signed him for his bat, not his glove.  My reasoning is, prior to signing Sosa to a minor league contract they signed Frank Catalantto from the Blue Jays for the DH, he is more of a contact hitter not a power guy and can't deliver a HR when it's needed like Sosa can.    Hope this helps!|`|lZbOBB8eaa	no
AA11225694	Reports from Reds camp indicate that the team appears to be leaning toward Hermanson as their closer as long as his back holds up. So far, so good. Remember that Hermanson did save 34 games for the White Sox in 2005 before Bobby Jenks replaced him late in the year. He has the temperament and the experience to handle the role.    The Dallas Morning News reports manager Ron Washington still hasn't announced whether Sosa will be in the Rangers' opening day lineup. Other DH choices include Brad Wilkerson and Frank Catalanotto. When Sosa is in the lineup, he will bat fifth.  Sosa proved his doubters wrong this spring and opened some mixed-league eyes. Just don't get your expectations too high.|`|8Q4Y4pKiaa	Hermanson might be a bulk of the save opportunities in Cincy.  I'm sure that's the only reason you can come up with if you just think about it.  Sammy Sosa is worth it, but I'd keep him on a leash.|`|Y9T76yF9aa	Hermanson is expected to be the closer for the Reds. He was great a couple of years ago, but is coming back from a serious injury. He's worth taking a chance on if you need saves. As far as Sosa goes, if you have a deep league, give him a shot. Don't expect too much, but you never can tell.|`|AA12200210	Actually, I'm pretty sure David Weathers is the closer for the Reds, not Dustin Hermanson.  So no to Hermanson.    Also, Sosa is not even good enough to make a 3rd OF for the Rangers.  there are 32 teams in MLB, 10-12 in your fantasy league.  Sosa should not come close to touching your fantasy team.  Though I think he will have a good year all things considered.  I could see him hitting 260-270 with around 15 hr.  He will play in 40-80 games depending on how he fares during the year.  Not a fantasy player though.|`|p5Mac5t6aa	Cincinnati doesn't have a true closer in Mike Staton or David Weathers and Hermanson has closed for both the Giants and White Sox and he was signed to a minor league contract by the Reds to see if he could be their closer.  From all reports this spring he still has it.  And good closers are a hot commidity.    I'm not sure about the why's with Sosa, I would take a wait and see what he does attitude...he has always been a slow starter.

AA11156479	Strong and big hands if you do not have big hands you can strengthen them. Steve Carlton would force his hand down through a barrel of rice to strengthen his hands and forearms. To throw certain pitches one would almost have to show you in person and you will not be able to do it without a lot practice. To throw a curve you grip on the two narrow  seams and slightly to one side and rotate your arm as you throw you do not snap your wrists you just rotate your arm again it would help to have someone show you if you do not have someone to show you there are a lot of books for little league  on up to show you so get to the library read one of those or check it out and go to the ball field and just throw throw a lot strengthen your arm and practice and slowly you will be able to throw a couple decent pitches to show off to friends, when I was in my early twenties I taught myself how to snap off a decent curve nothing special by Blyleven, or Koufax standards but a couple times we were playing some pickup hardball with friends and family and it was kind of fun showing off.|`|8b5d9e31e15c19286c5a183c806b738aaa	Well you have to be 14 1/2 to learn a curve and 15 for sinkers are you?|`|VgSca8ycaa	the sales pitch is the best pitch to learn

Elijah Burke is crap, Snitsky couldn't cut it on the major brands. CM Punk, and The Alpha Male are the only good performers left. They need to fold ECW and make the other 2 brands stronger-in my opinion.   OH yeah Lashley wrestles more on Raw than ECW anyways.|`|AA11921177	Yeah It's not extreme at all, and there is no point in it if it keeps going this way, half the wrestlers on it are getting released or have already been, and even lashley wrestlers more on RAW these days than on ECW! Raw has been sucking lately too, but ECW has been for a while since Vince bought it and it NEEDS to get more extreme! And add better matches, we need variety not boring regular old matches.

That is why you can't find NFL footage on youtube.    However  NFL films does sell videos from it's "Greatest Games" series.  Here's the link:    http://www.nflfilms.com/specialorders/  It's the 1986 AFC Championship game    Unfortunately I think they charge $50 a copy.    If you have the NFL network or ESPN classic, check the listings regularly for NFLs Greatest Games.  They show that game alot.  Then you could just tape it.|`|75BGaSegaa	search either youtube or google video it'll be there somewhere|`|GOyc7ZXWaa	Just Go To Google Write Doenload ares In The Search Bar And Download It I Think U Must Press The Second Result And U Can Find Anything U Want In It Such As songs pics videos and...|`|MT9vBy3Baa	if you have the NFL Network, they occasionally will show classic games such as that or contact NFL Films to see what you could do.

AA10299307	Let's rate teams one by one with A, B, or C:    Bulls..//; They are getting a great PG but losing Hinrich, too. And I think Mohammed and Murphy can fill in Hughes' empty place. And they're receiving 2 cash and giving 2 cash. At last I think they benefit a little, so they get "B+".    Pacers..//; Tinsley is a great PG, but their incoming players, I mean Hughes and Haslem are decent, too. Although they are losing an expert assistant as PG, Haslem can a good replacement for O'neal, if he leaves (I don't know whether or not he's leaved but I assume he's went). So they get "A".  (If O'neal didn't leave the Pacers, I would give them "B-".)    Heat..//; They already have Williams as a good PG, So they don't need to have another star like Tinsley. Of course if Tinsley carries on his injuries, like last season that he was injured most of the time, he won't work for them. So they get "B-".    Bobcats..//; Trading Felton for Hinrich isn't even necessary for them. It changes nothing. Furthermore in my opinion, Felton had a good season in 07-08. Of course cash compensation received by them may help them trading in or signing some players. So they get "B".    Your trade average score is "B+". It's a good rating for a 4-team trade. So you can decide on it based on the average score and (dis)advantages I mentioned.    As a consequence I, somehow, go with this trade.|`|Zh3Qe8Weaa	Bulls:C+ giving up Hinrick for players they don't really need.    Heat:B they already have Chalmers and can resign J-Will so don't need another PG but it would help.    Pacers:B+ getting a scorer in Larry Hughs and a good defender in Haslem    Bobcats:A getting a good PG and money for some players that they don't need.    Hoped I helped Peace|`|9GTbG4sSaa	That trade suck.

AA11225694	After earning a Pro Bowl bid and finishing second to Peyton Manning in fantasy points, Brees should be near the top of most draft lists. The Saints had the NFL's top-ranked offense last year, and although receiver Joe Horn is gone, this offense still has plenty of weapons in Reggie Bush, Marques Colston and Devery Henderson.   Don't wait too long on Brees.

xFget4Doaa	estas personas si saben de lo que hablan    http://www.bushidoblog.com.ar/index.php/...    saco un par de dichos para el que no tenga ganas de informarce mejor    Eran comunes los rumores que circulaban acerca de la capacidad del shinobi (otro nombre para el ninja) de transformarse en animales, desaparecer, caminar a travez de paredes, tener la fuerza de diez hombres, escupir fuego por la boca, etc. Lo que no se saba era que ellos mismos divulgaban estos rumores para generar temor sobre sus adversarios. Mismo se vestan en ocasiones de rojo para camuflar su propia sangre al ser heridos por la espada del samurai. De esta forma, lograba una ventaja psicolgica. Pero sus trucos no acababan ah.    el Ninja, si bien a veces era tomado como asesino, tambien era por decirlo asi un Ex-samurai y al Convertirse en ninja perdia identidad, nacionalidad hasta incluso su familia, pero esto solo sucedia si era vencido o derrotado o si era mandato de Su Amo, ademas el Samurai tenia los conocimientos de un ninja pero no los usaba ya que eran de deshonor para el, ya que al convertirse en ninja perdian tambien su honor, porque no se les era permitido a Un samurai atacar por la espalda y a un Ninja si, ademas al ser ninjas no se les permitia ver a su familia y amigos y se les daba un apodo en lugar de un nombre ya que no Tenian identidad ya que eran tomados como Guerreros de las Sombras, no mostraban su rostro y ademas solo se conocian entre ellos    creo que si confrontamos a estos 2 guerreros es importante determinar en que ecenario combatirian, ya que si esto es en un bosque, o en la oscuridad o cualquier centro que se preste para que el ninja le prepare una emboscada al samurai seguramente la victoria seria del ninja, pero no cabe duda de que si la confrontacion fuese en una arena despejada , con ambos contendores armados de igual manera y frente a frente , sin sorpresas, el resultado fuese totalmente distinto. El ninja se armo con shuriken y vestimentas de camuflaje para utilizar el elemento sorpresa y esto fue porque los ninjas estaban al tanto de la superioridad del samurai.    se dice que lo ninjas eran samurais desempleados(ronin) que abandonaban sus familias para vivir en el campo y corresponder sus sabidurias al que mejor les pague ya que para ellos no existia el honor     a aproposito de lo que dijiste los samurais no trabajan en grupo prefieren hacer el trabajo ellos solos debido a que las cabezas de sus contrincantes eran de trofeos para ellos y mejoraban sus status dependiendo de quienes sean     saludos , un poco extenso pero interesante  --------------------------------------...  para matias mi hermano es 4dan de ninjutsu en este momento esta entrenando en USA debido a que en mi pais no existe alguien superior en esta arte     minimo algo eh de saber     acaso yo en algun momento dije que alguno era superior al otro? dije que depende de varios factores como de la persona y sus principios y aun se desconoce los verdaderos paraderos de los verdaderos ninjas antes de ser ninjas asi que tu tmp puedes afirmar nada y yo dije lo que se dice no afirme nada      ademas una persona que abandono el foro decendia de una clase de samurai y por suerte tube el agrado de aprender demasiado de el aunque muchos quieran creer lo que solo conocen|`|5267de4f03f73e98559a09f8a8b82263aa	Hola!  Lamento vero tantos enes q se creyeron eso de las peliculas.  Antes de opinar de quien le gana a quien como si fuera un videojuego, invesiguen muchachos! Y no opinen tonterias!  No ven q no sabben nada? Invisibilidad? Ninja? SAmurai? Apuesto a q ninguno de ustedes tiene idea de q es el Budo Taijutsu o el Bushido!  Tarea para el hogar: Investigar sobre Budo Taijutsu y Bushido, y cerrar un poquito mas el pico q esta debajo de sus cabecitas loquitas y fantasiosas!  ADIOS!    Post Scriptum: Para Fanatico:  Primemro q nada, no te sientas aludido por lo q dije, no te ataque, simplemente expuse diplomaticamente mi postura, q supongo, entenderas los motivos. Cuantos de aca, en ete foro saben algo acerca de todo esto de los ninjas y los samurais...? Muy pero muy pocos... Tocan de oido el tema! Si lo unico q sabben es lo q les ense?o Hollywood! No se puede tratar algo q abarca idiosincracia de un pueblo ORIENTAL (remarco ORIENTAL, porq iplica cultura diferente, diversa ideologia, credo y religion), en un TIEMPO diferente (hay q tener en cuenta el contexto social, historico, es decir, ubicacion espacio-temopral para tratar temas asi).  Los ninjas y samuasi no se peleaban porq les parecia divertido, porq querian o porq era su deporte favorito. Hoy van a practicar "artes mmarciales" y de ahi salen y se van a su casita a mirar la tele. En aquellas epocas el gobierno se reggiga por teoracias, es decir, habia designios de las deidades para el gobierno. Este gobierno estaba secundado por un orden familiar, no como nocsotros conocemos al orden familiar, sino q esto implica como si cada familia fuera una parte de el orgganismo gubernamental. Si alguien era hallado en actitud dehonrosa, era deshonrada toda su familia junto con el. Entonces, ahi entran en juego mas factores. Opresion, como siempre a traves de la historia, l a avaricia y la codicia existieron y existiran. En esa epoca el gobierno tenia sus propias tropas, q parte de ella estaba compuestos por los famosisisisimos samurais. Estos eran entrenados en artes de guerra, asi como en medicina, estudio de territorios, estrategia, climatologia, y varias artes esoterias (eso dejo por su cuenta q investiguen).  Parte de estos guerreros daban un juramento de lealtad hacia su superir. Cuando comienzan las tomas de territorio en el oriente, con la conquista de Japon a las cosatas aleda?as,  se ve en aprietos el plan. Por q? Xq se les ofrecia resistencia. Los mismo s "campesinos" q pensaban indefensos ofrecian resistencia... Ahi e donde muchos de los instrumemntos del gobierno deciden separarse, por no poder tolerar la falta a los codigos de etica q regian y juraban guardar (Bushido es este codigo).  Entonces, no solo se separaban de las fuerzas, sino q al pasar a la clandestinidad formaron clanes en contra de su antigua escuderia.  Aca es donde a estos campesinos promitivos en sus metodos de defensa (priimitivos comparados con el notable avance tecnologioco y estrategico de el gobierno y sus fuerzas), se les suman grandes cantidades de militares oramados y preparados. Estos ex-militares se valen de lo q tienen a su alcanse para luchar (hoz para segar en el campo, palos de pastoreo, arcos y flechas, ca?as de bambu, peque?os cuchillos usados en la pesca., machetes de cosecha, etc.).  Aca es donde se ven las distintas armas q se usan actualmente en TRES de las escuelas q componen al Budo TAijutsu, escuelas a las cuales se denominan Ninjutsu.  Entendes a lo q me referia? Esto, a pesar de ser extenso es solo una infima parte de un posible estudio y desarrollo, asi q por favor, no sean tan cuadrados en su vision del mundo marcial, y sean un poco mas reflexivos antes de opinar.  Reitero, no es nada en tu contra FANATICO, no quiero q te lo tomes a mal, es solo la humilde opinion de un servidor.  Y realmente me complace saber q tienes un hermano aprendiendo Ninjutsu... Yo soy 3 Dan, y rendi esta graduacion frente a Dr. Hatsumi... Asi q tambien hablo con un... digamos... cierto conocimiento de causa  nuevamente... ADIOS!|`|4b473a2a370a543eebfcac97ca926d3daa	Hay Raul M, mira quien dice que no se crean las peliculas, ?los ninjas no tienen etica y son mercenarios? ?eso es todo? jajajaja... no aconsejes a las personas si no sabes porque se van con la idea de que eso es correcto.|`|YDr9Z4UIaa	si es uno a uno yo creo que ganaria el ninja, justamente por lo que dijistes:el ninja tiene la ventaja de la sorpresa e invisibilidad, en  cambio el trabajo en grupo no sirve cuando no hay grupo xD  espero que te haya servido saludos  LALO|`|S0SNi8Iraa	n|`|mMXXIvVBaa	El que sepa pelear mejor.

El ninja podria tirar sus cuchillitos, pero que le podran hacer a la imbatible armadura del samurai.

He is a physical runner who attacks the hole, and his improvement as a receiver has been key to the 49ers' offense. As QB Alex Smith and tight end Vernon Davis become bigger threats, the 49ers' offense will become more balanced, and that will open up more holes for Gore. Plus, Darrell Jackson now is in the mix. Don't worry about a change in offensive coordinators, because Gore will continue to be the offense's focal point. The 49ers said as much when they rewarded Gore with a four-year contract extension.  A Gore who scores well in both Red and Blue states -- he is a top five fantasy back.

His wrestling skills were not the best, but he could put on an entertaining show. I wouldn't call him the best of all time, but he is in contention for the most entertaining of all time.     As an actor...I can do without him. I will never run to go see his movies. there is nothing unique about him as an actor. Also, I am not a fan of how he abandoned the wrestling business that made him famous.     As a bodybuilder he has no status. His physique was never amazing in wrestling and it still isnt.|`|4onT0qUxaa	I liked him as a wrestler, but its still a little wierd to see him as an actor. Personally I like him as eye candy ;)|`|fvxFuEi9aa	As a wrestler, He was The most entertaining of all time, and even though he was no Angle or Benoit, his in ring work was smooth, crisp, and mad you wanna watch it. And he was extremely athletic for a near 300 pound man.    As an actor, He has been more successful in Hollywood than any other wrestler before him, even Hogan and Austin. And he deserves props for that. I think he's a  very good actor that has been in some crappy movies. He just needs to pick his movie roles more carefully.      As a body builder, he's no body builder and never wanted to be, I remember him saying in one of his interviews, that he never wanted to be the toughest, fastest, or strongest wrestler. But he did want to be the most entertaining and i think he achieved that. But he is in great shape.      All in all when you combine the charisma of The Rock, the main stream success of Dwayne Johnson, and the looks of both you get the biggest star to ever come from the wrestling industry.|`|AA12095894	As a wrestler, he was one of the greatest to enter the ring. He had decent in-ring ability, and unsurpassed mic skills. In my opinion, The Rock was the most charismatic wrestler ever. His wrestle-mania match vs Hulk Hogan was my favorite match ever.     As an actor, he's not bad. But, not great either. The only one of his movies that I really enjoyed was "The Game Plan".    As a body builder, like the first answerer stated, he has no status. Dwayne has some muscle,but not enough to be a professional body builder.

Ez4svBtXaa	yeah they should have won when larry fitzgerald he ran 58 yards and that even scored a touchdown.|`|JTSNljLhaa	dont tell me you're a steelers fan.....now?|`|oWLe7TNIaa	Fans?  They have fans?  Oh, you mean the people who are arguing that the Holmes catch wasn't a catch because the ball was out of bounds but his feet were in?  The fans that don't understand the requirements for an in-bounds 100% legal catch?|`|d5368f798fac0323fe025ec0d32f5be6aa	Cards were just glad to be there. thats why they lost.|`|VDErUqZKaa	I'm proud of Fitzgerald. He made all the good plays in the game. But anyways I wanted them to win but i knew the steelers would win.|`|ULw1777caa	Have you read the crybaby posts here?  They sure are.|`|Fer4ZrnXaa	I've seen a lot of Cardinal Fan Crybaby posts..What does that tell you?  They keep saying Steelers cheated and crap.  I personally am a Steelers Fan

Yes  I wanted to scream all through the night cuz i was so happy  no|`|dXpeu3rvaa	hellz yeah im happy!!! STEELERS WON!!!!!    (what can i say? im from pa :D )|`|ogDi5xXxaa	NOPE. I do not side with the Steelers, instead with the Browns. Yet I will admit they played an awsome comback last night!|`|qOUNCq8qaa	I don't like football except for Tom Brady|`|L96q34jnaa	I'am disappointed in the Lions because well Iam from detroit. I stopped watching them half way through, but I had a blast watching the steelers win last night. I also had a bit of disappointment when they didnt review warners last second thing, but oh well.     Holmes amazes me ...    I cant wait to see next years superbowl!|`|6vyni95Laa	Other thoughts:    It's a damn shame that poor Drew Brees, the best rated QB in the NFL with a stellar stat season, is saddled with the hapless Saints.    With any other team he probably would have won a Superbowl by now....    :-(       Signed,    A pathetic, life-long Saints fan  (pity me)|`|41b3a130d0d833a126e19dc8aed37861aa	I thought the season is whole was pretty good.  The season ender with teams fighting to make the playoffs was pretty exciting.  There were a few teams the shocked me, and a few teams that were disappointing.    Both the Falcons and Titans made it.  I am very happy with how both teams played the season.  Titans went 10-0 before losing to the Jets, they did end the season with the overall best recorded 13-3.  The Falcons shocked even me and finished 11-5 almost winning the division.  I didn't except the Falcons to get far in the playoffs.  However, I do except them to make and get at least to the NFL Championship game in 2009.  Falcons need another receivers to line up with White, and they need to fix some holes in their D.  The Titans, I felt should had went on to the Superbowl.  They run over the Ravens in that game.  The Titans cost themselves a shot at the Bowl.    I felt that the Bowl didn't come down to the two best teams this year.  Not taking nothing away from either the Cardinals or the Steelers.  Steelers winning it all, congrats to them.|`|SNllynBiaa	This season was almost a dream season for my team, Tennessee Titans. However I was very disappointed that the Titans beat theirselves in the playoff game against the Ravens.     I did not want the Steelers to win just for the reason that the Cards have never won the Super Bowl.     I do not think the best AFC team was in the Super Bowl although I do have to say they did play pretty good in the Super Bowl. I am looking foward to next year and I hope we don't lose Albert Haynesworth in the offseason. He is a free agent this year.|`|UQYurvnYaa	it was good|`|9gsm05lnaa	I didnt even watch a single game!!!!|`|ciqAXgCgaa	this superbowl blu my mind!  im a die hard steelers fan so im very happy, and the cardinals did so well this superbowl, really enjoyed it.|`|IGbEZZlraa	I am STOKED! Steelers had an amazing season! They deserved this win! They worked hard and played a good game of football! Cardinals did an amazing job also! It was a close intense game!    But in the end, I am still proud to say that I am and always will be a die hard steelers fan!    GO STEELERS! 6 TIME WORLD CHAMPS!|`|1uSoU8Lpaa	My team, the Packers, did not get in. Their record 6-10. It was a whole season of checking out Aaron Rodgers and how he will progress and disappointment with the defense.    Steelers did the job. It was a close game, the kind I like being a neutral fan of either team. But great job, they should be very proud.    Just one, it really stunk seeing Brett Favre go to the Jets and then go down like he did in the clutch. He should have stayed retired.
ZAh8CEoGaa	Well their roster is almost the same as last season and Gasol is playing his first full season. I think they can still win it wothout Bynum but it will be a hard playoffs road.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Very frustrated, especially considering the fact he was starting to play so well. With any luck he will heal fast and be back from 4-6 weeks. This latest injury does make me start to question if he has what it takes to be remain in the league a long time. I don't see them doing anything trade wise. They were fine last year without him and they have Ariza back healthy. Yes they can win the finals, but they need Bynum in my opinion.|`|AAWmhiuoaa	It is up to the cavs and magic to stop the celtics and stop this virus from spreading the virus known as celtics banwagoners,|`|NzS7yD32aa	they can get to the finals but win it without him doubtful    and bynum is just to fragile for me|`|xgGTyqHRaa	Sorry dude, but all i know is that once Bynum comes back he is going to give that extra push to the team that they have been waiting, for. And it is really exciting to watch Bynum play again, it's going to be awesome, well anyway nice question, I look foward to answering another one of your questions. Well anyway, GOOD LUCK!|`|gqoIfbH0aa	I think that San Antonio might give them a challenge without Bynum, last year they were limping into that series and Ginobli was just plain exhausted, this year they have a better, younger bench surprisingly with the emergence of Roger Mason Jr.    But I still think the Lakers come of the West and the Magic out of the East even though I like the Cavs, I just think the Magic have too much variety for the Cavs to match up with, Dwight Howard will have a field day against Ben Wallace and Big Z, Hedo and Rashard can pull up for the jumper pretty much anywhere on the court, and the new all-star, Jameer Nelson will match up with the final piece of Cleveland's puzzle Mo Williams, I just don't think Mo can guard him... But we'll see...      If Bynum is in fact out for that amount of time then the Lakers will probably face little to no opposition in the playoffs but if they are wrong again then the Lakers lose in the Finals. again.|`|8zq5vuiKaa	last year they said he will come back in 2 months but never so maybe this will happen again, he will never come back until next season sucks|`|A5zTi1tWaa	Well, they went all the way last year. The west has not improved much compare to last year so they'll be alright and yes, they can still win the nba championship this year. Andrew will be back in time before the playoffs(hopefully).    They don't need a trade to bring in a big now, especially someone who doesn't know the triangle coming in at mid-season. They still have Odom, Powell and Mihm as their bigs anyways.    For me though, if Andrew is not back in time,this is now an opportunity for the Cavs(to entice LBJ to stay) and Magic to win it this year,that is if they surpass Paulie.
Pfq2zRejaa	Rafa's a great manager ! ov course we deserved it we were the better team wat can you say about torres pure class|`|tbgaqgQyaa	we were better before lampard was sent off so yes we did deserve it :)|`|mKazB56xaa	.......|`|uXXbegw5aa	Im not taking nothing back.  He buys a 20m striker, subs him for most matches, says " robbie is still a red" and then he sells him    Stupid idiot|`|huto12P3aa	Rafa's still going mad, i mean its not exactly hard to beat chelsea these days, because they're crap under Scholari.|`|zJCWIWE0aa	Rafa wants a cake|`|cd8fb1a8552a48786a6354cd99f5f249aa	although i do like Liverpool but that victory had nothing to do with the brilliance of Benitez, Chelsea were 1 man down and it took until the last minute to win, usually a time when 1 side loosens up, Chelsea did give up thinking this is going for a tie, Liverpool took the chance.    OFQ: i cannot say they didn't deserve it, if Lampard deserves being sent off then there's no excuse for Chelsea loss.|`|4VgPiwRqaa	Yes you did deserve it and I am a Chelsea fan BUT Xabi Alonso is a provocative hacker.  Lampard did not deserve that red card and it would have been 0-0 if the ref wasnt so controversial
dfo8gSaraa	I agree.  I think he would've won it had the score remained 17-7 or 20-7, even with the personal foul.  Harrison caused a fumble as well in the game.    But, since the Steelers blew their lead and had to rally from behind to win, Holmes was the key in that drive. One could argue that Roethlisberger deserved it too.|`|UxooffHZaa	If Harrison had a sack too, he'd of won. But, one play does not make MVP. Holmes had a good game.|`|VuaOKpYXaa	I completely agree with you.  Imagine how different the game would have been without that play.  The Cardinals would have had 3 shots at the end zone from 2 yards away and if successful they would have taken a lead into the half and gotten the ball back.  I think it was probably a 14 point play and clearly MVP worthy|`|d5368f798fac0323fe025ec0d32f5be6aa	harrison is just full of awesomeness. should of punched that dude some more if he was getting a flag for it.|`|7X1H2AfWaa	the reason why he didnt get it because of his idiotic foul on a player in the 4th (he might have been kicked out) but had his reception. santonio holmes did the better job though (catching the game winning catch).|`|a6EndAPiaa	1) Harrison's play happened in the first half so it was not as crucial as the last minute catch.  2) Harrison's stupid unsportsmanlike penalty would have cost him the MVP no matter when his great played occurred.  The voters are just not going to reward that kind of behavior.|`|AA12103453	I'd say it was because his horrible behavior late in the game. I understand tempers flare but hitting the guy on the ground then pushing the dude down when he tried to get up. You can't award him the MVP when the cameras were showing that.|`|wxXguyK3aa	Did you see him punching that Arizona player when he was on the ground?!  After seeing him do that I'm glad he didn't get it.  That 100 yard int return was awesome, though.

51bd60494429f94771a79adedd996e77aa	It was sick... The holding penalty agianst the steelers was less of a hold than some of the takedowns the Cards had last night.  woodley and Harrison were getting molested all night long.        Poor stupid Flanders,     -There is such a personal foul call for hitting the holders,  - I saw no block in the back on the Int. return.  -There were multiple illegal blocks on the Breaston punt return.  -There is no hallo rule in the NFL anymore. There for There was no kick catch interference. Maybe the Cards need to work on fair catching.    Learn the rules of the game and don't ***** because your team lost.|`|e53807be9e34b50fae02ba7c73274c6baa	- I was surprised the officials actually got the call right when they called a Personal Foul on Taylor vs. Boldin on the AZ sideline.     - I was surprised Harrison wasn't ejected for punching Francisco.     - I was surprised Wilson got a personal foul for 'roughing' the holder when he was trying to hold-up.     - I was surprised Dansby got a roughing the QB called against him.     - I was surprised Gay didn't get a 'catch interference' penalty for not giving Breaston even 1/2 a yard to field a punt.     - I was surprised they didn't call a 'block in the back' penalty when Harrison ran back the INT return.     - I was surprised this officiating crew was considered the best in the NFL.|`|xGofrX5Iaa	They called holding on every third down man. The didn't review the Kurt Warner fumble, and it was at least worthy of a review. They let Homes use the ball as a prop without penalty, and the let Harrison punch and kick players without ejection. Steeler fans are replacing Cowgirl fans as the worst in the NFL. Doesn't it hurt that the steelers can't win a superbowl without the help of steroids or the refs?|`|61itEiq4aa	The best team did not win that game. The refs handed it to the Steelers. Pretty sick|`|No7cWEKIaa	To those of you who think the Steelers got the bad end of the officiating, pull you heads out.     I'm not going to say the refs completely favored the Steelers, but to say they favored the Cards is just plain stupid. There is no doubt the Cards got jobbed more than once, but they still should have won the game.|`|q8mbICQ8aa	Doesn't matter, Cardinals are better team than Steelers all day. Everyone has an off day.|`|UQYurvnYaa	haha yeah weeeiiiirrrrd|`|xvuAQ0DAaa	The Pittsburgh O line are among the most notorious holders in the league.

There were missed calls against pittsburgh and there were missed calls against arizona also. Anyone see the holding against harrison where they held him by the facemask twice and it was called holding intead of personal fouls. The last play was clearly a fumble by warner when its clear why do we need to review it. The holding call against pittsburgh to give arizona a safetly was pretty clearly not holding. So lets suck it up people someones gotta lose and it wasnt the refs that caused it. Pittsburgh made the plays when it counted arizona couldnt.

Yeah his stats arent pretty, but in over  a third of the Game he played this year, he lead the steelers on last minute game winning drives.  Thats really all you can ask for in a qb.

Go ahead and fumble through your pages of stats, I will actually watch the game and see a leader leading his team. Sorry you missed a great performance last night.

Football is the absolute team sport , I don't care how good a QB is he can't win it alone.|`|QEYFU5Lvaa	He has won 2 SB's    He knows how to lead his team to a game winning TD in a big game (unlike some QB on my team named McNabb)    He is an accurate thrower|`|k6u1Kka0aa	He doesn't put up numbers like Brady or Manning, he just wins. Big Ben has averaged 10 wins per year since being drafted. Isn't winning what it's all about?
AA10876816	Gotta start Peterson and Jone-Drew! Then I would play Lewis because the Broncos' rushing defense is not the best in the world. Turner has been really inconsistent, especially of late, plus if New Orleans goes up on them big.........there goes the run! Good luck!|`|NYhmRBzsaa	i would put in Michael Turner because he is really consistent, Jones Drew because Detroit sucks at defense real bad allows the second most rushing yard in league and most points scored, and Jamal Lewis because to me he has improved a lot since he first came to Cleveland. Also go to http://www.rootzoo.com/ for more fantasy football information and results are quick |`|1857be617d60deda585d08bb7fffa45eaa	start all but turner.  The others have been consistantly good and their matchups are great.  Turner is good against bad defenses but HORRIBLE against good defenses.  The saints have an inconsistant Defense so it depends if they play well or not.  Overall, i would sit the incredibly overated turner|`|L5RfC9e2aa	Sit Jones-Drew.  Hes an on-off player. Had a TD in week9 so hes due to disappoint this week.  Plus he has taylor and Garrard to steal rushing yds.  Lewis has a prime matchup this week,  DEN is HORRIBLE against the run, and Quinn will be eased into the offense.  AP is a must start every week, but especially against the pack, and Turner is as solid as it gets for ATL, and NO is terrible at stoppin the run.  You have excellent matchups!|`|AA11154535	adrian paterson :)
Kecfbgm5aa	ummm kupar p. i also write for Bleacher Report and i cannot disagree w/ you more. first of all stone cold and hbk will not be in the main even. stone cold is DONE!! i love him to but he will not wrestle. anyways i agree somewhat with this card    wwe title match looks good. world heavyweight will be cena/orton. mitb looks good but i would add evan bourne. ecw title match will be swagger vs dreamer. undertaker will fight either kozlov or hbk. hbk might fight jbl with simular stipulations of NWO match.|`|vaVkveEkaa	I write for Bleacher Report, where the plans are 100% legit. Hell, we knew about Flair a week before it happened. I think you should have a Fatal Four Way Elimination Match for the WHC with Stone Cold, HBK, Orton, and of course, Cena. The reason? Well, it is WrestleMania 25, and Stone Cold should always be in the Main Event, nuff said. It would also add a certain aura to the event, with half the fans actually thinking that Stone Cold could win the title...|`|TWQNYhVVaa	I think that half of it won't happen,  most likley HBK will face taker  cena vs RKO or Y2J vs RKO  swagger vs bourne is possible but not likley  Ric Flair is retired,plus he's way too old...  And stone cold..I REALLY doubt it..
6GdeuiCgaa	He should've been ejected.    And the Steelers should've been hit with a 15-yarder on the kickoff for using the ball as a celebration prop after scoring. They've been calling it all year, but not that time? Hmmm....    That said, it was a great 4th quarter. Both teams played well.|`|gYRfWcleaa	I'm not a Steelers or Cards fan but I think his actions deserved much more than a penalty. I think he should have been pulled from the game. What he did was so out of line and should not have been tolerated.|`|AA11749193	No....Tested for Steroids- YES.    He wasn't thrown out of the game, so can't go back in time. Just move forward!    Have a gr8 week!|`|WkLJI40baa	He should have been ejected. A big fine is a no brainer the only question is if he will be suspended for a game or two next season.|`|pBTm6K20aa	Yes, his actions went beyond the normal "mistakes" that require a penalty. He should have been ejected. His opponent was down and not "fighting" back. The play was basically over, yet Harrison showed millions of kids that a multi-millionaire athlete can do things during the most watched sporting event that would get the average guy thrown in jail.|`|LZCDJWFHaa	No.  I watched it again.   47, in an effort to block Harrison, threw himself on all fours in front of Harrison to attempt to trip him.  Now that the ball was kicked, Harrison was to block   47.  It looks like he was attempting to keep  47 on the ground as  47 was now a potential tackler.  Whenever  47 tried to stand up, Harrison knocked him down.  Try to remember that this is the Harrison who is usually held whenever he pass rushes one-on-one.  You will notice there is usually an arm around his neck when he is getting around the defender.|`|xvuAQ0DAaa	fined, suspended and tested for Steroids, looked like a classic case of 'roid rage to me. Even after the refs flagged him he kept on punching. He should have been off the field.|`|UxooffHZaa	Not Suspended, but fined. I'm sure he'll get fined. None the less, it was probably worth it, because that energy he plays with was why the Steelers won. Every coin has 2 sides.|`|bjR2uWAWaa	waaaaaaaaaaaa. get over it already. Steelers won!|`|AA11828439	Nope, that guy went at his knees.|`|dfo8gSaraa	Fined? Yes.  He probably will be.  Definitely not a smart play. But neither was the Safety (Wilson?) for running into the holder.|`|kQStNgzUaa	He should have been ejected and fined. But, the refs were biased. The Steelers are not good sportsmen, Roethlisberger and a few others being exceptions to what seems to be the rule for the team.|`|lPDHMOVZaa	Fined and suspended for at least the first 2 regular season games next season. This kind of behavior should not be tolerated.
syzMIfLLaa	Plyometric exercises also known as jump training.  Jump squats, lunges, there are tons more.  They are easy to find in a search engine.  sprinting up and down hill will help (up builds strength down lengthens stride.  Also eat as healthy as you can, the harder you work the more food you need.  Don't buy into the low carb crap either, if your an athlete you need energy and carbs are the quickest way to get energy from diet.  You could also look into getting a program like p90x, it is a great program and a fantastic way to train for performance rather than size.  most of all, work hard!
E1sqGzmtaa	Yes they sure have been whining alot on here today. Oh Well!!  Steelers proved they are the best team.|`|xGofrX5Iaa	How would it have been if the Steelers had all the calls go against them?

wxXguyK3aa	I'm a Giants fan, but I think this year's was better.  It's very close, though.  For me, last year's meant so much more, but this year's was more exciting.  Both had amazing plays and they both came down to the final seconds.  I give this year's a 10 and last year's a 9.9.|`|AA11108627	Like you said, the answer in large part depends on who you were rooting for.  I doubt any Giant or Steeler fan would be objective in their answers.    But I predict more people would vote for the 2009 Super Bowl.  The reason is our memories of the 2008 game are one year old, and most of the drama & excitement of the full 60 minutes have faded into memory.  But that of yesterday's game are still fresh.    However, I would not agree this year's ending was "better".  The endings were actually almost identical.  Remember, In BOTH games:    *The losing team scored a go-ahead touchdown with just over 2 minutes left.    *The winning team had to score a touchdown to win and needed a drive of 80+ yards.    *The drive included at least one narrow escape from a QB sack and at least one outstanding catch by a WR.    *The winning score was a TD pass with only around 30 secs left in the game.    *Both losing teams made one final desperation attempt to win in the final seconds, but came up short.    In fact, since last year's game was also an upset victory that thwarted a perfect season, you could make a case last year's ending was even better.    Overall, I'll just say both games delivered, and I appreciated both Super Bowls.  I won't enter any debate about which game was "better".|`|vMk597ZAaa	Both were about as good as you can get!|`|DymLS3Nyaa	Giants - Pats|`|yFYFZRlFaa	Giants-Pats was the best.      Giants-Pats had a better ending as well.      I can't stand how dirty the steelers play.  And then you get 106-56 in penalties?  What a joke.|`|HJIyxjUuaa	better ending: cardinals-steelers  better game: pats-giants, untill the 2 half of the cards- steelers  it was one of the best sb ive seen|`|yuGgPmq7aa	Both were great, but I think this was the most exciting game I have ever seen. Just an amazing representation of both teams talent. But I'll admit watching the cheating Patriots lose was almost as exciting as watching the Steelers win!|`|vwTu8fY7aa	Are you kidding the giants and the pats.  Mainly because the giants did what no other team could have done that season and end a big winning streak    Better ending Cards Steelers. Because it was anybodies game even with 30 secs left in the game    Besides Steelers only made it to the super bowl because tom brady wasnt playing that season|`|vQeKxmZyaa	This year's game was better than last year's.  Not the best ever though.|`|UQYurvnYaa	roethlisberger was like peyton maning. alot|`|xvuAQ0DAaa	Redskins v Dolphins XVII 1983|`|hfEGHKePaa	The Giants-Patriots game will forever be the best, but the Steeler-Cardinal game was right up there among the greatest too.
Pc0QjrQ4aa	The game was already bordering on the ridiculous as it relates to time (four hours).      Take a minute, review it, get the call right.  To have the proverbial billion dollars of technology and a small army of officials and review personnel and not review the call (and the league has said they did not review it) just seems bizarre.|`|UxooffHZaa	It wouldn't have changed anything... but yes, they should have reviewed it.|`|8oAlBL91aa	They did review it as far as I know. But I won't say anything bad because you said you thought the better team won in which they did. :-)|`|dfo8gSaraa	Because it was obvious that he fumbled.    It was just as obvious as Holmes' feet being inbounds, yet they reviewed it anyway.|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/blog/shutdow...      8000 people so far know it was ridiculous officiating.  Ive watched the NFL for 25 years, Ive NEVER seen a player get a personal foul for running over the holder ha.  That phantom roughing the passer was laughable also.|`|S6AjZ2uMaa	Arizona had one challenge left, and had it not been in the last two minutes, they'd have used it, but the officials deemed it beneath them. The ball was obviously hit, but Warner managed to shot-put it forward; how is it not still a forward pass?|`|yeu09pfOaa	Yes ... i do wish that the play would have been reviewed....|`|6Ojpl6viaa	They did review it, there was no need to slow down the game.  With the call going with the cards, the penalty would not have  counted.  But the call wouldnt have gone that way, as it was a fumble.|`|aWVZb2Pgaa	I think they should have reviews it. His arm was clearly going forward for the pass. If it wasn't for the 2 minute mark the Cards could have easily challenged the play.|`|oYsSL991aa	It was a clear fumble.  Warner's hand was empty when it moved forward.  But a critical play at the end of a game at that magnitude should be looked at|`|ZkFfzDXlaa	Well it's pretty clear that it was fumble since Warner was behind the line of scrimmage.|`|iL6UVfl4aa	they did review the play and they said rule on field stands.  It was close so hard to over turn.  FYI, not a fan of either team|`|091ca1bd7e49158f5110601cac84ad3baa	No it would have just been a waste of time. It was a fumble, the ref upstairs does in fact review it and determine if they need to take a closer look or not|`|vQeKxmZyaa	Yes they should have.  Would it have made a difference?  No.  Congratulations Pittsburgh fans.|`|51bd60494429f94771a79adedd996e77aa	Without a doubt.  In the spirit of the fairness of the game it should have been reviewed.  and Holmes should have been flagged, but he did fumble that ball, and celebration calls are judgment calls.      Hockeynut, the ball was out of his hand when his arm came forward. Watch the Play.|`|srVQ1tTLaa	That was clearly an attempted pass in my mind.     It should have been reviewed, but for reasons unknown it went without a second look.    Another example of poor officiating throughout the entire game....    I am not a fan of either team, myself, so no bias here. Too bad the officials had to play a part in the outcome of the biggest game of the year!|`|lTlaNwtgaa	no get over it . you must be a cards fan|`|UQYurvnYaa	they should have, but didn't|`|a6EndAPiaa	I am sure the replay booth official looked at the play.  In the NFL if you see an empty hand moving forward the play is going to be ruled a fumble 100% of the time.  I imagine the replay booth official saw that and quickly decided there was no need to review the play.  The rule is very straight forward.  I can not tell you how many times I have heard an official say "Empty hand moving forward it was a fumble" (or words to that effect).    The on field official could have spent 2 years under the hood and the play still would have been ruled a fumble.    Finaly for everyone who thinks that the play was reviewed it was not!    Al Michaels said the play was reviewed but he miss-spoke.  The official never said words to the effect of "The play is under review" nor did he after going "under the hood" say "the play stands as ruled on the field".    There is a difference between an official review when the on field official goes under the hood and the replay booth official looks at a play in the replay booth to determine *if* there should be an official review.  For there to be an official review the ref makes the announcement and goes under the hood . . . that did not happen.  Even if the ref forgot to make both announcements only 51 seconds elapsed (yes I actually timed it) from the time he announced the penalty for helmet removal and the final play being run and that is just not enough time to go under the hood.    --- Edit  Chad I have been watching football for 33 years and I have never seen a player run over the holder either.  However, that does not mean it was *NOT* a penalty.  It only means that in general players are not stupid enough to do it.  It is a penalty, it has always been a penalty, it always will be a penalty.|`|qUhntdzvaa	should have been reviewed.  looks to me like his arm was going forward.|`|hfEGHKePaa	I think the call was questionable. It seemed at first it was a forward pass, but after the review I thought it was closer to a fumble. I'm still not 100% sure though.

Yslq4OYhaa	Okay, Judomofo, you gave good advice in your previous answer.     I'm glad the boy wasn't hurt.     For those that said run. You are sadly mistaken. When you run from a dog you have given up your dominant position. In addition to that it is instinctive for a dog to chase its prey. You can't outrun most dogs. If that dog has a temperament that it is an alpha dog you will be in a lot of trouble.    The article doesn't state the temperament of the dog. I doubt if it has been tested. He was lucky he didn't get hurt. It worked because he was able to gain control of the dogs neck and that is one thing that kept him from being bit.    In our martial arts training we have taught methods of surviving a dog attack. Our training was meant to work on people.     But because I have worked with a lot of dogs I have come to understand things concerning dogs. What will allow you t survive an attack would be know what a dog does instinctively. Much of what you stated in your previous answer cover this. I have owned and bred dogs. My most recent breeds are Rotts, American Bulldogs. My next breed I hope will be the Presa. All of these dog are normally great dogs for Shutzhund, iron dog, protection and working dog type of work. They all have the temperament to be the alpha dog. Kicking, hitting and even mace will often cause the dog to more driven in their attack. You have got to get control of the dog and maintain it. I usually don' share this but since you already did. The first thing you want to do is offer the dog something to bite. You said your arm. I prefer my coat or something else for them to bite. The arm I will give as a last option. The dog's natural instinct was cause them to bite what is immediately in front of their mouth.    Edit:    Notice the dog did not get choked out. But the boy did maintain control of he dogs head. I don't think he would have been able to do this with a larger breed or a trained dog. This dog was a mutt. It was grabbed from behind. It didn't have a chance to defend itself. It may not have even bee in the dog to put up much of a fight. I've seen dogs that will not put up a fight.|`|b8e1755da720b51020434b3175ed1c82aa	I have a 110lbs Akita and a Dogue De Bodeaux x Rottie.  Believe me they would destroy most human beings.  Some say you only have to stay away from the Teeth/bite.  That is crazy as fighting dogs attack on many angles.  I think even the most able fighter would struggle againt an Akita in attack mode.|`|xHs1V2Vtaa	you always ask thought provoking questions.    coming from a judo/jujitsu practioner and having aided in many dog training sessions, it is very apparent who knows what they are talking about and who is full of "dog poop".  the principals are always the same only the anatomy changes. position over submission. work your strikes and pressure points in unison with your control techniques. know your opponents weaknesses and above all: train, train, train.    neat question, some good answers and some laughable ones too.    now, my question is; when are me and your dog going to get to go at it? i wonder if he can take my title. LOL just kidding.... hope you both love what you do and do what you love.|`|w9kSGLBxaa	I would do the same thing I have done before. I turn around real quick and attempt to punt the dogs head off and pull out a pocket knife keeping my left hand out in front and my knife hand back so he grabs the left had first.     I have not actually been attacked but I have had dogs run at me and I think if I had run I would have been attacked. I just stand there and stare at them until they either get called off or give up on the whole alpha male thing.     I love midnight walks so this thing has happened a few times. Thankfully I have never once actually had a dog stick with the idea of attacking me because I do not actually know what would happen.|`|8s1sdRh1aa	Sorry, didn't read your answer yet, judo.    Running away is the wrong thing to do. NEVER run away.    I have actually used that choke against an attacking dog as well.     Also, a good toe kick to the throat has worked well for me.     Once, I was bitten in the hand where my entire hand was in the dog's mouth. I rapidly jammed my hand down it's throat and grabbed the lower jaw pinching the tongue through the mouth and the bottom outside with my free hand.    I have also used a good Shote strike to the snout and that's a great one.    I have been attacked several times. By a pack of dogs in the woods, by a Doberman, a Husky, a few muts, and two black labs.|`|nRBC4E5saa	In one of Loren Christiansen's books, he devotes an entire chapter to countering dog attacks.  Grabbing the scruff of the neck is an option, as is striking the nose or stomping the paws.  Most animals will bite the first thing presented to them, so I'd probably wrap my forearm in something and use it as a sort of shield.  Conceivably it shouldn't be hard to wrestle a dog to the ground.  Considering their social order, I'd think that their attitude might chance once you had put them on their back and established a good top position.|`|Y26eOD9Caa	I suggest running for your life, climbing the nearest tree, or if the dog catches you, jam your forearm into the dog's mouth to the hinge of his jaw, and scream for help at the top of your lungs.|`|Qpx6gCwFaa	Lol. I don't even have a clue.    I'm guessing I would just scream at it, though I never learnt that in Taijiquan.    [edit]     About the article though, I would like to point out that the Dog didn't see the BJJ kid coming, but I give thumbs up to that kid. He's got courage.    [edit again]    Out of curiosity. If a dog lunged at you, would sprawling be a good option?|`|N5SVU6Xwaa	well, i don't know maybe a gun or mace might work|`|1e576939d9233965a515d8aaa9992a28aa	Whatever works!      As the article ends by saying, the dog wasn't deemed dangerous.  It was a dog on dog thing that bystanders got involved with.|`|73wpIlgnaa	I suggest to keep moving and to repeatedly strike down on his muzzle and his eyes.  Kicking could be one of your safest weapons here.      I don't agree with some of the notions of getting to the dog's level. Not only does that show the dog that you are willing to submit to him, you are also giving it more of a chance to win.  The dog has more a chance of pining you (since you will most likely be attacked by a large dog since you are worried about your life) and snaping at your neck.      Dogs are not stupid.  Humans ARE smarter, but dogs always perform their best under the stress of a fight or they don't fight at all--humans don't.  A dog isn't going to attack you without trying it best to hurt you for one reason or another.  Animals don't do half-hearted things when attempting something as extreme as attacking a random human for no reason.|`|325dc58fe0dad7a757aae14664382449aa	For a good martial artist, a single dog shouldn't be too much of a problem.  A big dog is a very strong animal, but they only have one weapon (the bite) and of course they aren't very smart compared to a person.    You'd want some wrestling or judo or jujitsu to deal with a dog.  Get down to it's level, avoid the bite, and pin the sucker.  Then do as you will.  Pummel it until it wants to run away, or just pick it up and throw it at something if you're strong enough.  And yeah, you could probably choke one out if you get the position.  I think Rickson Gracie did that once.      Mas Oyama used karate to break dogs necks with a single blow.  Then again, he also killed bulls with a single blow.  Not a whole lot of Mas Oyamas out there, now or ever.|`|LUnscegvaa	I habitually carry a mini hair spray aerosol ,just for such occasions.

You see, Miley is a black belt in BJJ herself and she is a master of the rubber guard.  I have gotten her in full mount many times, but she can always squirm out and get back to rubber guard, then push off and escape.  All of my previous pets have been strikers, but Miley is a born grappler.  She is somewhat vulnerable to an Aikido take down I know where I grab both of her front paws, then use leverage to flip her on to her side, but she recovers quickly.

In general most dogs will only attack if you are doing something they dont like (territory, etc.)    If for some reason u get a nasty bugger then u should get away. If you end up fighting back you might encounter legality issues if its near property since 9/10 times its someone's dog.     If for some reason you are backed in a corner, same rules apply for humans. Strike the eyes, nose, you know what.    Avoiding confrontation is almost always the best choice.

BglekVnQaa	I'm excited about him fighting on RAW, but I'd hate to see him stay there. Taker's Smackdown's leader and I'd really hate to see him in the dark while Cena and Orton are overshadowing him.|`|6f41c712d34a30397cc9d83fa0a8d496aa	i Agree Undertake is like Da best but there mostly better sometimess n that would be one of the best fights in Raw We would see becouse randy orton and undertaker had a storylin before so i cant wait ^^|`|KIOR56r6aa	I do!!!|`|3cQx8ZFSaa	I do because i love the Undertaker ( not literally of course) but Undertaker would make better storylines for Raw and increase ratings slightly.|`|RhgB9qnEaa	he wont stay on raw he is smack Downs top superstar smack down needs him besides he's on the ec for the wwe title on smack down|`|4zQEvzCsaa	They need something on Raw at the moment, I keep phasing out when I watch it. I'd like to see Undertaker on Raw (mostly because I'm going to a Raw event in Australia in July this year and I'd like to see Undertaker!)|`|7f2GSDmqaa	It's been a long time since Taker has been on Raw. It'll be good to see him back in action on that brand.|`|GgWrhISBaa	I do he is AWSOME!!!|`|smH3BfLBaa	I don't think he should stay on raw. but considering him and Shawn Michaels are the only 2 people in the WWE to still be in the WWE since the very 1st episode of Raw, I don't know what they will do with him. I mean they have a "talent exchange", and unless his contract expires from Smackdown and gets a new contract for Raw he is staying on Smackdown.|`|NWmWtGilaa	yo either expect tha legacy to interfere or expect edge to ruin tha match just think about it edge would wanna weaken his opponents in the elimination chamber and why woulden,t edge want taker in tha ec  hes probably gonna show up and make taker lose the match|`|yw8IeiPNaa	OMG taker's going to pull a Hogan and pass the torch too Orton.I'd never believe it but I think it's going to happen.|`|823483cd7c6ae5cf96d5e52dde65697aaa	As much as I like the Undertaker, Raw is already the more dominant show, because it gets so many more viewers mainly because of the start wrestlers there.  If someone as big as the Undertaker came to Raw, that would increase the ratings on Raw, but further decrease the other WWE shows.

But maybe the Yahoo staff will add the section you want... it can't hurt to ask!
a0751e51e77a757d57715f6706a37923aa	Good list overall, I agree with most of it. It's a matter of opinion really, but since you asked, here are the ones I'd disagree with:    NFC North - I think I'd go with Calvin Johnson over Driver    NFC South - I still think the Bucs defense is better, though they didn't play well down the stretch    NFC East - I think the Cowboys have the best offense and the Giants have the best defense. Also, I'd take McNabb over Romo, but it's close.    AFC North - This is where I'd really disagree with you. I'd take Willie Parker as RB, and I don't think it's particularly close. Also, while none of the offenses in that division are very good, I'd definitely take the Steelers over the Ravens. I might take the Ravens defense over the Steelers though.    AFC South - Still gotta go with Indy's offense here    AFC East - If Tom Brady is healthy, I'd definitely choose him over Cassel. Otherwise, I agree with Cassel. I'd take Lee Evans over Wes Welker though.|`|yg3Pveakaa	AFC East  QB - Matt Cassel  RB - Thomas Jones  WR - Wes Welker, Randy Moss  Offense - Patriots  Defense - Jets (This is wrong) the Dolphins are the best in this division..|`|8fe3c5c628ca1e4652c6de261ec861bfaa	AFC East  QB Tom Brady  RB Thomas Jones  WR Randy Moss  Offense Patriots  Defense Dolphins    AFC North  QB Ben Roethlisberger  RB Willie Parker  WR Hines Ward  Offense Pittsburgh  Defense Baltimore    AFC South  QB Peyton Manning  RB Chris Johnson  WR Andre Johnson  Offense Indianapolis  Defense Tennessee    AFC West  QB Philip Rivers  RB LaDainian Tomlinson  WR Brandon Marshall  Offense Denver  Defense San Diego (all of them are awful)    NFC East  QB Eli Manning  RB Brian Westbrook  WR Terrell Owens  Offense Giants  Defense Eagles    NFC North  QB Aaron Rodgers  RB Adrian Peterson  WR Calvin Johnson  Offense Packers  Defense Vikings    NFC South  QB Drew Brees  RB DeAngelo Williams  WR Steve Smith  Offense New Orleans  Defense Tampa Bay    NFC West  QB Kurt Warner  RB Frank Gore  WR Larry Fitzgerald  Offense Arizona  Defense San Francisco|`|xFfskbjYaa	My Disagreements-    NFC North WR- "Megatron" CJ over Driver    NFC South WR- Colston over Roddy White    NFC East RB- I think Westbrook and Portis and maybe even Barber better than Jacobs.    NFC East Offense- Cowboys    AFC North Offense- Steelers    AFC South Offense- Colts    AFC East Defense- Fins    AFC West Receiver- Dwayne Bowe over Royal    These changes approved?|`|KTp27Fokaa	NFC South offense- Saints. 1st in total yards in the NFL    NFC West RB- Steven Jackson is the best when healthy.    AFC North RB- "Fast" Willie Parker    AFC East defense- Dolphins...    AFC West QB- Jay Cutler    otherwise good
8Im1iGFTaa	ya that ended sucked that was a gay reversal and he tapped so fast and he was right by the ropes|`|k85qpRgUaa	yeah completely agree the man of a 1004 holds submits to cena really really sad i can see a pin since cena has to win always but to disgrace one of the top wrestlers today/ever by making him tap is just plain sad.     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faaDz7p5X...|`|4Tt86CNsaa	like it or not wwe is pushing Cena now. Jericho is a guy they can stick anywhere in order to push a prospect or push an established star to a new level( that's how good he is). "it's fake"!!! jobbing is part of the business, Jericho jobbs for a few months, then is thrown another title because Vince can count on him to do what's best for the company. looking weak and whining has been Jericho's schtick since his wcw days lol. the only one to come close and be successfull doing the same type of angle is Edge lol.|`|F3VjJAdiaa	it was totally lame. jericho had cena in the walls of jericho long enough to make him tap out, then cena reverses it and in 2 seconds flat jericho taps...|`|dcNT65mTaa	Well i dont know about beating the chains off cena but jericho wins more than he loses and doesnt have to cheat or get interference to do it so I never have thought of him as weak. Whiny is one thing but weak he is not. He's a big match performer, we know this, but he doesn't have to whine when he fights a jobber.    EDIT:    That reversal and submission loss sucked major a$$.|`|yetGbkdBaa	well cena is their top superstar and the fans love him. so that's why wwe makes him so overrated and so overly pushed so they can get more money off of him.

MBknatYtaa	I am a bartender  1A No, not directly, but reading the newspaper before hand often gives me topics to talk to people about    1B I think most newspapers are written on a 7th grade level nowadays.    2. mostly just to convey information to the manager or opening bartender.    3. Very, people like getting the correct change, the bosses like getting the correct amount of money, and some times people on a credit card slip will just write a total and I have to figure out what the tip should be.    4. Yes, good listening skill are imperative.  5. Yes, good speaking skills are imperative.  6. I work with another bartender and have to handle servers drink orders  7. Yes, the register is a computer.  8a. Mostly have to deal with personalities and how they are affected by alcohol.  8b. Experience and common sense.  9.

But, Ben just made all of them Superbowl Ring wearers. I think it's pretty logical to say Kimoiatu and Harding had horrible games yesterday. Hopefully the Steelers draft an O-Lineman with the first round pick this year. They need to upgrade a little. Ben does what he has to to win. (and survive) He plays better with some weight on him.|`|616b18f35255971ece90dca0da3b2da8aa	That was one a the keys to the Steelers' success. Also AZ doesn't really have a great Defensive end.|`|hfEGHKePaa	Don't hate, appreciate!    Ben Roethlisberger is a hell of a QB. Give him props for his 4th quarter comeback. He's obviously the most underrated QB in the NFL.|`|51bd60494429f94771a79adedd996e77aa	He never got hit by the linemen.  I didn't see him breaking huge tackles, I saw a few arms thrown at him, but he never got hit by a linemen, except for that one sack in the 4th quarter.  The real question should be is he the most elusive qb while staying in the pocket?|`|lPDHMOVZaa	Big ole "whale" would probably be more appropriate... though I can see the resemblance to a horse when he takes off his helmet.
TOls0c2haa	dont be foolin nobody|`|Y5jv0ybFaa	100%|`|1FGWFcljaa	i have broken bones many many times, and gotten a few concussions on top of that, but i am doing some crazy stupid things. you aren't going to get that hurt as a beginner as long as you learn to fall right.     but on icy days, the mtn med clinics do see a lot of beginners break their wrists on the bunny slope, because they never learned to fall right.     you really aren't going to get much more hurt then a broken wrist as a beginner unless you are really unlucky. you just aren't going that fast yet.|`|zj8HLXI3aa	There's a reason why the term, "noob" was developed, and used currently for slander.   Tell him to get over it and give him a bit of a push.|`|jTaW3goeaa	Snowboarding is extremely risky.  I've broken my collarbone before.  I've also come close to breaking my tailbone, concussions, and many other small injuries have compiled over the years.      I would tell him you can't have any fun in life if you dont take risks, and there is a high chance of getting hurt while snowboarding but the risk is definitely worth the reward.|`|ucot94w3aa	You could get hurt walking down the street.    Now, let me start my saying there is a difference between between hurt and injured. My high school football coach always used to ask guys if they were hurt or injured when they said they were hurt.  If you get hurt, you shake it off and get back in there.  Everyone is going to get a little "hurt" starting out.  Falling hurts.  Especially when you aren't used to it.  You need to reassure him that you won't do anything too risky.  It's pretty unlikely that he'll be INJURED.  Tell him there are millions of people that snowboard, even little kids.  If everyone got hurt all the time, or injured, there wouldn't be nearly as many people that love the sport so much.|`|rBYqlytYaa	i would say..60%    dont snowboard where there are trees, rocks,  or lots of bumps..then i think you should be safe|`|wvJmLgKxaa	This is my eight season snowboarding, I have never broken a bone but have been really beaten up. I do know someone who broke both of their wrists at the same time and my friend got a nasty concussion on a rainbow rail. These were all from doing tricks. I think the probability of getting injured just riding down the mountain are very slim. All you would have to worry about is breaking your wrists, that's why i would recommend wrist guards. Theres really no way you can break you tailbone, ankle, get a concussion just riding down the mountian. However you can't ignore other people's actions, if someone comes and slams into you a whole range of injuries can occur.
lPDHMOVZaa	How about the Packers with their "super cool" "G" incased by a green oval... or perhaps the Bears? Sure a "bear" would be a powerful mascot, but as far as logo's are concerned... how cool is the letter "C"? Quite frankly I'd rather have a snarling Cardinal on my helmet.|`|whE5OQ26aa	The Dolphins have that light-hearted Miami theme. I like it. Making the Dolphin more aggressive looking was a bad move.    I like the Cardinals helmet, it works for some reason.    The Lions logo is classic, but the team is horrible.    The Broncos have an awesome helmet, so what are you talking about?|`|oDbSNr4aaa	There is such a thing as a Seahawk, Ill have you know. It's a Native American legend from Washington where the Seahawks are from. KUH DUH. WOW you just got burned by a 12 year old|`|ZCMIslvtaa	I think undoubtably the Saints are the weakest mascot (maybe that's why they've never won an NFC championship). I mean who would be afraid to play a group of Saints in a game of tackle football. A raven could probably whip up on a cardinal but that's still a pretty weak team name too.|`|6440aca54e76133287a99d198c3d1a37aa	The 49ers and Colts have pretty lame helmets.  Actually, it seems that most teams have words or letters on their helmets rather than animals/logos.  I like the Bills helmets, kind of old school retro look.|`|bgIbbp5Yaa	Worse logos - Detroit, Buffalo, Denver, & Carolina    Best logos - San Diego, Tennessee, Atlanta, & Dallas|`|iIWWeD7Taa	The Bengals REALLY need to update.   At this point, they look like a Pimp straight outta 1979.  All they need is Foxy Brown for a Cheerleader.|`|BHYqBizzaa	The Eagles have a funny looking helmet... they have wings on both sides of their helmet!!!|`|LlCnUAnFaa	Green Bay.  How unimaginative is a G?  The colors are even ugly. Go cheesehead.|`|f551e387a3e6f01af266f4af899c09e9aa	Dude...hello?  The Browns.  It is just a brown helmet, what could be weaker than that?|`|ULw1777caa	Jets, I mean it just says Jets.  WTF?|`|AA12103453	The Seahawks logo is stupid, but probably hard to make it look good when it isn't a real animal. The Titans is kinda weak, why not put a Titan on the helmet(also why the sword on the shoulder, is it the blade that was used to kill the TItans or what). To be honest what team has a decent helmet may be the better question.|`|7Q7dFghmaa	Seahawks are pretty weak. I mean, there is no such thing as a seahawk.    Eat Funyuns.|`|cVqCryr6aa	Denver's has always been a bad joke. All 3 of them.|`|MBknatYtaa	The Patriots, their current logo replaced one just as lame. And don't forget the original logo on the Buccaneers helmet when they had the tangerine colored uniforms. The guy on the helmet looked like he enjoyed the tight ends a little too much.|`|KhBmlaefaa	Raiders. The guy looks fruity on there..    And seahawk is a "nickname" for Osprey, which is a bird that does exist.|`|UGAr0M3laa	bears
EVwllMNqaa	fighting and arguing|`|UQLNP6iyaa	There is a bidding process which goes on at the owners combine each March. The NFL selects host cities well in advance, usually 3 to 5 years. There are various criteria considered including the city in questions physical ability and infrastructure to host a Superbowl (transportation, accommodation, subsidiary event venues). As regards the Stadium, it must meet several important criteria including: either in a warm weather environment or completely roofed, in excellent condition and in a city with an existing NFL franchise (although not necessarily at their Stadium).    Roger Goodell said in 2007 though that he would consider letting the Superbowl go to an international location and suggested Wembley Stadium in London as a possible location.    Currently announced future host cities are:  Tampa, FL - Raymond James Stadium - tonight  Miami, FL - Dolphin Stadium - 2010  Arlington, TX - Dallas Cowboys New Stadium - 2011  Indianapolis, IN - Lucas Oil Stadium - 2012

In March 2008, Harrison was arrested and charged with simple assault and criminal mischief stemming from a domestic altercation with his girlfriend.[3] A few weeks later, the charges were dropped after Harrison had completed anger management counseling and psychological counseling.    I THINK HE NEEDS COUNSELING AGAIN|`|UxooffHZaa	When he goes to play for the Dolphins.   The Steelers develop great linebacks... but they don't spend their money on keeping them after they get great. Look at Porter, who's still a great LB. Timmons and Woodley will step up. (Last year's 1st and 2nd pick) Perhaps they'll trade for another Farrior type player, or draft another LB in the 2nd. (They need to pick up an O-Line guy in the 1st)|`|d5368f798fac0323fe025ec0d32f5be6aa	Steeler football is called punishing the other team until they dont want to play anymore. thats exactly what harrison was trying to do. He was blocking the dude, but i think he grabbed him as well so that might have been the personal foul. haha i loved those few seconds there. Cards were playing scared for 3 quarters.

Harry will motivate the players and the team should start climbing up the league.|`|PD3qATQtaa	I think many people class this as a "continental structure" to running a football club.     Basically from what seems to have happened is there was a director of football in charge of transfers and Ramos was expected to coach the team but have no say over what players he had at his disposal.     And I think in many cases its not entirely the systems fault but a number of factors. Both of these systems were poorly run and administered. You had a situation at both Spurs and Newcastle were there was Absolutely no communication between the guy signing the players and the guy coaching them.     To put it into perspective Arsenal have a very similar structure but the reason it works is because the two operating there understand each other. David Dein and Arsene Wenger were a very good partnership. Arsene Wenger understood the need to find young talent at a low cost and David Dein understood what type of player Arsene wenger was after and needed, they communicated.     The reason both Newcastle and Tottenham are both proping up the table is not down to the system but down to poor decision making and appointment of personnel.     |`|9f0N9bUmaa	i think this is not the case, cuz i saw a headline today in which Redknapp was saying that he was incharge of transfers...|`|PrsbAjZAaa	I think the manager of Tottenham..or atleast since Ramos was ALWAYS in charge of club transfers    i meen ramos spent about 65-75 million (i think) on the players that he wanted and Levy was just handing the money over to Ramos to buy who he saw fit to do the job at Tottenham...and now with Harry there it'l be interesting to see if the players who came in the Summer will still be there in the Winter

pbabXHd2aa	Practice several skills, not necessarily in this order:  1) Shooting  2) Dribbling  3) Passing -chest passing, overhead passing  4) Moving without the ball  5) Lateral movement for defense  6) Rebounding (jumping up and boxing out)  7) Learn how to use your left hand as well as your right  8) Talk to parents and your coach about weight lifting  Good luck|`|AA11225694	1    Play a pickup game. Face it, basketball requires you to run a lot while also jostling with other players in order to get shots and rebounds. The perfect way to prepare for this is a full court pickup game. Consider sprinting back and forth as long as possible in your first few games. Know that you will wear down, but prepare yourself by managing your strength and learning how long you can last. Your stamina will improve and you will learn exactly what you can take, how your shot will look when you are tired and more basics about the game than even a coach can teach you. Pickup games are how you become a good player. They need not be outdoors as there are plenty of indoor gyms with open courts across the country.   Step2    Running the suicide. This is an unfortunate word for sprinting, but it has its reasons. A suicide will play havoc on your thinking. Running is paramount in practicing for basketball, made up of short sprints all along the court. This is why a suicide is perfect for building the bursts of speed. A coach or player puts a series of 4 to 6 lines of tape on a court--one at the free throw line, one at the three point line, the half court line is the third and then continuing to the other end of the court. You sprint to each line, go back to the original line, and continue this for however many you want to get a complete workout. Prepare yourself for a basketball regimen by running 3 to 5 complete suicides twice a week. This may not turn you into Michael Jordan, but you will likely improve more than speed as your jumping ability will rise.   Step3   Use shooting drills. The next step is the all important shooting drill. This is not the three-point shootout from the All Star Games. Instead, you are taking all the basic shots. Often, these exercises will be done alone. You may be in the middle of football season or you are about to try out for the high school team. Put one or two large trash bins around the shooting areas you are practicing in. Many top shooters will use this drill to simulate someone guarding them, running from spot to spot, taking quick shots in front of the bins. Because in a game, someone will always be on you, it's good to learn how to take a shot while being guarded. A trash can or similar item will work perfectly.   Step4Practice rebounding. Building strength is crucial for rebounding, that part of the game coaches stress more and more. Think about it like this: On average, half or more shots are missed, so someone needs to go pick up the garbage. To improve rebounding alone, its best to start following all your shots, immediately grabbing the rebound. Or if you have a few friends, get in a line, throw the basketball off the backboard, and jump and put it back up. Basically, you are grabbing the ball in the air and throwing it back against the backboard, then allowing the player behind you to do the same.   Step5Develop dribbling skills. Dribbling is about developing good hand-eye coordination. If you have a talent for crossovers, breaking through tough presses and have some speed, you will be a good player. Many top players arent the best shooters, and even Michael Jordan had his moments, but they handle the ball well. To practice dribbling, pickup games can come into play. If you are alone, consider doing whats called a spider. In a spider, you keep the ball beneath you, moving your hands behind, in front, and to the sides of your body. In short, you are keeping the ball right underneath you while moving your hands quickly around your body. This drill is used by many players, coaches, and at training camps.

B3LUO8Eiaa	hell yea the refs cheated...they called roughing the qb one time during the game which was a weak call then they called another weak call when they said the player ran into the holder when pitt attempted the field goal which gave them 1st and goal forcing az to hold them once again at the goal line...not to mention the last az poss. when they ruled the pass a fumble..clearly his arm was going forward...oh i 4got about when they ruled Ben's run a touchdown forcing az to challenge the play at the beginning drive...and last but certainly not least after Santonio Holmes caught the game winning TD he used the ball as a prop for his celebration which is a 15 yard penalty...what a huge no call for the simple fact that if the refs get this right the steelers kick from their 15 instead of their 30 which gives the cards relatively excellent field position with a decent return...I know I know the cards did themselves a disservice at the end of the first half throwing that pick which was huge...not taking anything away from the steelers but the refs certainly didnt help the situation at all...|`|1ed4ac958de690dccea642576d62e334aa	Harrison should have been ejected from the game.  Warner got hit hard after several passes, yet the only penalty was called on the push of Rothlisberger.  The Cardinal DB got called for a facemask while his facemask was being touched by the WR stiffarm.  The last play should have been reviewed.  I heard that there was an obvious block in the back on Harrison's interception TD that was not called, but didn't see this myself.    Still, Cardinals played GREAT. Someone SHOULD have tackled Harrison. Some of the penalties were just stupid.     And, finally, I wonder why:    1. The Cardinals didn't run a few screens when the Steelers kept blitzing; and    2. Why the Cardinals didn't blitz more on the Steeler's last drive.    But, ain't hindsight great?|`|6LG4LsuOaa	Its a pity when you have to look for every excuse imaginable as to why your team lost a football game.  Get over it and quit crying like a big baby.  Seems to me the Steeler's had quite a few calls go against them too.  For instance the touchdown they took away from them in the first quarter.  And if you think Santonio Holmes should have been penalized after his touchdown then Terrell Owens and Chad Johnson should be penalized everytime they score  a touchdown for the stuff that they do.  Every team has bad calls go for and against them throughout the season.   If some of you supposebly see so much that the officials dont then why dont you apply for a job as an NFL Official?  If the Steeler's would have won 35 to 3 some of you would still be on here complaining that the officials cost the Cardinals the game.  Quit being jealous that your team didnt win or even make it to the Super Bowl.  The Steeler's are the Champions.  End of story.|`|ULw1777caa	Cheated them?  They were undisciplined and took bad penalties.  Boo-hoo.|`|bc92692e5171a576e30283eb2faec88eaa	Wow, you're an idiot.    The Cardinals shot themselves in the foot this game... They were penalized for 106 yards, and I think only one of those were really questionable (The personal foul on Dansby).      Also, Holmes did make that catch.  He had possession of the ball, and kept both feet in bounds.  That's a catch buddy.|`|gU4VdD6Oaa	Yes, the refs caught the winning TD pass for the Steelers. The refs made a 100 yd interception return for a TD for the Steelers. The refs committed all those holding and facemask penalties that the Cards got called for.    Dude, look, the Steelers had a TD taken away from them on review in the first quarter and had a holding penalty for a safety called against them which wiped out what could have been a game-sealing 20 yd completion in the 4th quarter. Tough calls went both ways. The Cards played great but the Steelers played a little bit better.    Game over. Don't be like the stupid Seahawks fans who have been whining for 4 years.|`|98bupiDFaa	Any reasonable person understands that the game was not fixed.  If the refs were on Arizona's side...why would they overturn a Steelers' TD on a challenge in the first half, call 6 penalties on Pittsburgh in the 4th quarter, and take away a first down in the 4th quarter for Pittsburgh that would have sealed the game and instead gave the Cardinals a safety?  The game was overofficiated...I wish the refs would let them play more and not call so many ticky-tacky penalties...but they did not call the game for the Steelers.  Anybody on here who thinks otherwise has an agenda against Arizona and can't think objectively.|`|UQLNP6iyaa	Great teams win despite poor officiating. Only bad teams and bad fans whine about refereeing changing the outcome of games (unless you are the Raiders after the "tuck rule" game, that was appalling). If you didn't hear Ken Wisenhut or Kurt Warner whining about it last night (and you didn't, they were the epitome of class) then you shouldn't hear Cardinals fans or anyone else whining about it.    It was a great game, decided by the thinnest of margins. Wisenhut said it was a touchdown, so it was. That's all. Your hatred of anyone changes nothing.|`|AA11209233	The calls were definitely in favor of the Steelers.  They missed the block in the back on the interception return before the half.  No ejection for throwing three punches.  The Cards got the safety on second down, but still had to play third down.  The ticky-tack drive reviving roughing the passer penalty.  Two for two on coaches challenges.  The game ending fumble that wasn't reviewed (which was iffy--it looked like the hit came, Warner got by it and then threw the ball, not that the ball came out on the hit.)       I did think Holmes had that touchdown though.  And bad calls are a part of sports.  I don't think there was anything crooked going on.|`|AA10776364	As a Cards fan let me say one thing.....Dude shut up!|`|HtYGxZcCaa	Im always a believer in you never blame the refs for a loss, but in this game the referees blew a ton of calls.The Cardinals made a ton of stupid penalties as well as though. The refs blew alot of calls such as the roughing the passer penalty which in my opinion was the worst call of the game because the DEs momentum carried him into Big Ben and if anything it shouldve been intentionally grounding and a punt for Pittsburgh. The end of the game I dont know how they didnt even look at the play, that was not a fumble as his arm was moving foward. The refs ruined a potential mircale finish by giving the Steelers the ball and not even looking at the play, not to mention the Cards wouldve won on a mircale but after that 15 yard intential play the Cards wouldve had a chance to win from around the 35 yard line. Santonio Holmes also shoulve got an intentional foul for excessive celebration AFTER the TD because its clearly in the rule book that that was excessive.    The refs didnt a terrible job in this game and ruined a chance at a miracle finish or exciting last 5 seconds, but Congrats to the Steelers on winning the Super Bowl because you cant say they didnt deserve it,and congrats to the Cardinals on a good season and hard fought game|`|JTSNljLhaa	let it go its over theres no way to change it|`|uwx7etCXaa	The refs didnt cheat, and the Cards didnt lose the game.  The Steelers won it fair and square.  Its hard to do, but teams have to play hard and make plays that are not reviewable, that way refs arent forced to make the calls.  I was rooting for the Cards and they played awesome, but like their coach said, the Cards score too fast and left too much time on the clock for Steelers to make a comeback.  I dont think refs had too much say it in.  If the Cards would have won, dont you think Steelers fan would argue against the holding penalty which gave the Cards a "Safety"?|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	Well, if you're a Steeler fan, wtf are you complaining about?...

But to me they cheated them a different way.    At the end of the game where Warner supposedly "fumbled" the ball when he really threw a pass. And those cheating reff's didn't even review it.

Even if fans who hate the Steelers will admit the catch was legal, well most of them would I would hope.|`|oWLe7TNIaa	Cheated??  The Cardinals got two points given to them on a "holding" call which I saw as the center getting bowled over into his own end zone.   I also saw them run right into the Steelers kicker.  Kurt Warner should've been flagged for throwing a hissy fit after the Steelers scored.    How can you argue with the way the Steelers did that last drive.  There is absolutely no evidence that would support that Holmes didn't get that TD.  Please provide a link.  They deserved that win, as they dominated for 3.5 quarters, Arizona was lucky to be that close in the end.|`|QEYFU5Lvaa	Holmes feet both touched the ground in bounds, Warner clearly fumbled the ball at the end.  Both of these calls were correct and not even close to being disputable.    I'll concede that a number of penalties that were called were bad calls, namely most of the holding calls, but the ones people keep complaining about were good calls.|`|PJzd8iJaaa	its over, get over it the better team won|`|ErTVzpUUaa	I think you ought to wring your crying towel out, and get on with your life!

It looked to me that Holmess right foot caught one of the cleets near the toe area of his left foot and never touched the ground. If you look at this from a physics perspective, Holmess trailing right foot would have had to be lower than his left foot or at least in front of the left foot for it to touch the ground. And you can clearly see in the replay that Holmess right sock stays above his left sock through the whole play. ALA, His right foot never touched.
a6EndAPiaa	fumble.    Empty hand moving forward = fumble 100% of the time.    The Holmes catch was clearly a catch there is no way to bend you toes like that unless you are pushing off of something hard (like the ground).|`|ULw1777caa	It was a fumble cause the ball came out before his arm went forward, look closer.    Holmes catch was legal cause his feet were in, thats the rules.|`|UxooffHZaa	Fumble. His arm was going forward, but the ball was out of his hand on the way back, and the defensiveman's shoulder pad knocked the ball forward. (unlike the past time when Warner was actually pushing the ball forward) It should have been reviewed to make sure, but it was a fumble.|`|Roes9U61aa	It was a fumble. as his arm came forward his hand was not placed securely around the ball.|`|gU4VdD6Oaa	It was a fumble.     The ball got stripped at the back of his motion and his arm came forward without the ball.     Holmes was a TD. His toes never left the ground, he leaned out and caught the ball with both feet in the end zone.    Neither was a bad call. Both were great calls by the officials.|`|AA12103453	It was a FUMBLE. The BALL WAS LOOSE when the arm came forward. It doesn't matter if the arm came forward, you have to have control when the arm starts to come forward. If you watch it you can see where the ball is loose as the arm is back.   Holmes is ALLOWED to go out of Bounds. His FEET were BOTH DOWN IN BOUNDS. That is how it ALWAYS works, in the endzone or out. He had control and both feet came down IN BOUNDS, try listening to the refs RIGHT AFTER THE REVIEW and they explained that.    I just want people TO KNOW THE RULES.|`|WaaFCtuOaa	Warner pass was a fumble, his arm wasn't going forward & Holmes feet were in bounds & the Steelers won their 6th SB ring|`|qq1fSV2daa	it was a fumble but still i think it was disrespectful to the cardinals to not get a booth review .. because now people are going to keep asking the dreaded question "what if ?"|`|oWLe7TNIaa	The first was a fumble, that was called an incomplete pass (the defender hit him, throwing his arm forward), and the second was a fumble.   Get over it.|`|175f31c99576af42d5ff8e3e686de0eaaa	The first one was a forward pass and was called correctly.     The second was a fumble and called correctly.     LaMarr Woodley and James Harrison made the difference in the game. That Steeler secondary looked mighty pedestrian last night, but the pressure from  92 and  56 made the difference.|`|oIY7UlmZaa	Barrack is calling it a fumble...|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	Uh...Everyone wants the calls to be correct...It gives the NFL a bad name if they don't...Personally, I don't know if the Cardinals could have come back still, but the refs definitely blew a couple calls that would have given the Cardinals a couple extra plays...|`|TuOp3hNPaa	it was an incomplete pass.  the rule is if the arm is coming forward it is a pass.  wether its a millimeter forward or a couple inches. an his was moving a lil bit forward before the ball came out.|`|UADHt07Zaa	It wasn't a pass.  The ball was getting forced out and he lost control of the ball.  It just so happened that his hand was going forward.    The Holmes play was good.  The rule for catching the ball in the NFL says that the receiver needs to be in control of the ball while having two feet in bounds.  He caught the ball with both feet touching the end zone (tip-toes count as feet) and controlled the ball as he hit the ground.  Therefore, it's a good catch.    If you want to talk about bad calls, I personally think that holding penalty in the end zone was ridiculous.|`|EIIQuuomaa	It was an obvious fumble because the ball was hit loose before his arm went forward. The QBs are trained to go through the throwing motion anyway but it doesn't change anything. And Holmes catch was in bounds because he managed to get both of his feet on the ground before he fell out which makes it a legal catch.|`|cfg5AFT6aa	ths ? shows how little u know.|`|eFhk1HB8aa	looked like a fumble,but how the hell was Harrison not thrown out of the game,is that what steroids do to you,|`|JkTGq2BJaa	Bottom line here is the game is over and there would be no way to change it anyway, so this is a waste of time. The cards lost the game on the play just before the half on the interception that was returned for a touchdown that was a 10-14 point swing. I still won $1000.00 bucks because Pittsburgh didn't cover.|`|OALAu7Staa	For what it's worth: I continued to watch the celebration and they showed a replay from a new angle in slow motion that we slowed down and watched in slow motion, so we were watching in double slow motion. What I saw was that the ball was jarred in his hand by the initial contact, but he maintained control (although in a compromised position in his hand), and attempted to throw the ball from this compromised grip.    At the least, the play should have been reviewed. With the ensuing penalty, the Cardinals would have had at least one shot at the end zone from somewhere around the thirty yard line.    The Holmes play was a touchdown.|`|AA11843057	incomplete pass-bad call steelers played a great game, but ref's were 12th man on field all night. that mugging that took place got a 15 yd penalty-should have recieved an ejection. If comish don't fine him at least $50,000 he was in the bag as well as some of the officials.  my eyes were open-arm going forward-BAD CALL! Holmes catch was good!!|`|yE7Q8LCkaa	LOOK AT THE NOSE OF THE BALL WHEN THE BALL WAS ENGAGED!  Was the elbow started forward? Yes  The wrist had not yet snapped nor was the hand/wrist moving forward to begin a pass motion (it was still moving backwards in fact) so the ARM was not moving forward when it was dislodged, just the elbow  Also, the 'front' nose of the ball was facing the ground as it does when a QB holds the ball looking for a receiver when the loss of control began = fumble. Had it been facing fwd as it does once the wrist snaps to begin a pass, then it would be ruled an incomplete pass. The review team had 60 seconds to determine if they should review the call: change of possession time and penalty discussion and penalty enforcement. They saw clearly by rule this was clearly a fumble. The replay booth is quick on stopping the game. As was seen by their review of Holmes catch, which clearly had 2 feet inbounds, when control was made.  Now why Pittsburgh didn't challenge Fitzgeralds first TD? I do not know. My TiVO replay clearly shows the ball being dislodged when Larry hit the ground. Watch it yourself and answer the question; why did the ball end up in Fitzgeralds thighs when he landed with the ball near his helmet. Get a good resolution replay and you'll notice the ball is knocked free when he lands (and did not have or maintain control of the ball). Fitzgerald then grabs the ball which ended up at his thighs as he jumps up to 'celebrate' what should have been an incomplete pass!! (but I won $ on my will Larry score 2 TDs bet so Im sorta happy it wasnt challenged)  One last note. Why was Fitzgerald not penalized as he ran for 45 yards out of bounds to catch Harrison on that 100yd INT return? This non-penalty call was fine by me as he ran into his own teammate (not part of this particular play) while out of bounds. This teammate illegally entered the out of bounds white zone that slowed Larry down. Thats 2 missed penalties called on the Cards which negated each other because they were detrimental to their team for that play (and nobody ever really gets a penalty called for stepping into the white zone unless they interfere with a ref)
8oAlBL91aa	There aren't very many Cardinal fans which makes me wonder how I have seen so many bashing about Steelers and Cardinals fans who need rehab lol. I think they just grabed a bunch of fan jump on the bad wagon when they some how made it to the super bowl.     My team won, I am from Pittsburgh and a die hard Steeler fan. I am extremely happy.|`|UxooffHZaa	Arizona really doesn't have many football fans. They measure the length of time they've been fans in weeks... Steelers have fans for life, and often multiple generations... even after Pittsburghers move to Florida or Arizona for employment.|`|Sw0yxyueaa	I'm from CA, so I kinda wanted the SouthWest team to win. But oh well, not gonna kill myself or anything...|`|zFpHpqiLaa	im a die hard steelers fan and we deserved 2 win i was extremely edgy let's put it dat way then roethlisbergr and holmes did what was needed so yh im real ****!n happy|`|MpDAGs5Taa	I'm not thrilled with the game. And before I continue let me just say I am not a fan of either a team. So I didnt really care who won. having said that it seemed the the refs went overboard. Ive never seen a football game with that many flags. The game itself was exciting though I just wish the refs had handled it differently.|`|q8mbICQ8aa	yeh football rocks, and im from Maine, but AZCardinals fan at heart, wished they woulda went into OT and then i wouldn't have cared so much who won or not, because then the refs wouldn't be as much as a factor with such little time. they would play their game, not the refs.|`|5wlLABo2aa	Im happy with th result|`|8aOh2Efraa	I wasn't pleased with the Steelers sportsmanship. They were a little out of hand. But they did play a better game so they deserved to win.     Not a fan of either team so I'm not happy or sad but disappointed. Wasn't the most exciting super bowl games.|`|f0f800aa59dba3492b0be00718d42ec8aa	I'm kind of sad that the cardinals lost because I always go for the underdogs. It would've been nice to see a ring on Kurt Warner's finger before he retires. Nevertheless, Larry Fitzgerald is an awesome player and we'll see him at the pro bowl.

gOJfsCy2aa	Yes i have tried it does work. Not instantly it takes a while but it does work and is alot better than air alert 3 beacuse air alert wears out your knee believe me I know lol and the reason i like VJB is because it doesn't just show you workouts it tells you the mechanics to jumping higher, how weights and strength shoes affect you, and the most effective workouts to get effective results. hope i helped :)
8oAlBL91aa	Many, that could have cost the game for the Steelers. I don't understand why they needed to be so hostile.|`|dfo8gSaraa	If you wish to be technical about it, I'd say 2.    1) Anquan Boldin for punching Ike Taylor in the face. Taylor pushed back and got flagged.    2) Harrison, like everyone else is crying about.|`|ZkFfzDXlaa	I think there were only one that swung a punch and actually made it... and the rest of them like 2 more, they r alright  nothing should happen to them.|`|kQStNgzUaa	Quite a few. I would like to see all of the Steelers who threw punches in last night's game go one on one against a good heavyweight boxer for a couple of rounds. I would pay to watch.   I think the Steelers need to stick to playing football.|`|J3kfQtViaa	I like how all the steeler fans are defending it.  When d'angelo hall lost it in that game against the panthers and tried to fight steve smith you didnt hear us falcons fans defending it.  This kind of stuff has no place in football especially in the biggest game of the year.  You can come to expect this kind of stuff from pittsburgh and their fans, they are too close to Philadelphia.
812c201aa2d8bada53eda66d1dab2600aa	They had a contract for the 2008 and 2009 Super Bowls, Reading from the BBC's site, there are games this year already sold out at Wembley(?)  so sounds if the NFL will be playing in UK next year and until 2010.|`|k2EHdpSRaa	I don't imagine they have the rights.

e53807be9e34b50fae02ba7c73274c6baa	I noticed the block in the back on the Harrison interception in real-time.   Not sure how the refs didn't see it since it happened right next to Harrison.     How did Harrison not get ejected for what he did to Francisco?  Isn't throwing a punch an automatic ejection?   He would have been arrested for battery on the streets.     Your key points are all valid, but AZ got a couple of calls as well.   Polamalu was held on the long Fitzgerald TD was one of them that went the other way.     Even though the better team probably won, I don't like the fact that the refs played such a big part in the overall result.     The officiating was a downright disgrace.  I don't know what these guys were looking at and it left a bad taste in my mouth.|`|UQYurvnYaa	to close to call|`|OFi3jBSHaa	THE BOOTH UPSTAIRS DOES NOT REVIEW PLAYS.    After the two minute warning, reviews can only take place if the replay assistant, who sits in the press box and monitors the network broadcast of the game, determines that a play needs review. The replay assistant does not do the review. The field officials do.    In any football game there's 10-20 penalties that get missed. Holding could be called on 50% of the plays.     Fitzgerald ran out of bounds to get past someone. He was done for that play. He made the tackle. *check it on youtube*    It would have been "utterly ridiculous" to review the play since a review was not necessary.|`|Oes7TRNVaa	STOP CRYING!!!    DAMN SORE LOOSERS    Go write a letter to Goodell!!    What do u want them to play the game over??    The Cardnals blew the game with supid penalties and the Int before the half killed them. Even with that they still had a chance.    Stop talking about the last play he held the ball too long and it got knocked out|`|S6AjZ2uMaa	Hey buddy... Look at the last twenty questions so that were asked right before yours... About eighty percent of them are inquiring about the same damn thing you are... Why not just look at their answers???|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	its always "sore losers, "quit crying", "get over it" AND "let it go" with Pittsburgh.  I guess these 8000 people an counting are sore losers too?  Harrison could bring a loaded rifle onto the field an if anyone complained it would be "wow get over it", "quit crying" "sore losers" and "let it go"    http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/blog/shutdow...    This is EXACTLY why they arent the best fans in the NFL.  First in the 70s, it was steroids    Steroids links  http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/story/83228...  http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/blog/shutdow...    then they get handed the Seattle championship    Seattle link  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_to...      People are starting to know an realize that this is how that team wins its championships. I  mean its all over the internet an thats 2 in a row now.  Ive been watching the NFL for 25 years, I have NEVER seen a call where a player runs over the HOLDER an gets 15 yards.|`|MxhZgjXWaa	The league wanted the steelers to win.  The fix was in!|`|yFYFZRlFaa	They didn't review it because it may have given AZ another chance.      The steelers always get the calls.  Dirty team.  Can't stand them.|`|6Ojpl6viaa	For somebody that has done a ton of web searching, how did you miss this one?  They did do it.  They could tell right away that it was a fumble and no need to slow the game down.  The right call was made.  Madden even said so!!  LOL|`|DA5ZbYjlaa	There were some tricky calls in the game, as there are in every game, but I don't see how it was "one-sided"...the Steelers got a holding penalty in the end zone after converting a 3rd and 10 from their own one-yard line, giving Arizona two points and the ball back (which the Cardinals promptly cashed in for the go-ahead touchdown). And the Steelers got a holding penalty on the first play of what ended up being their game-winning drive. As for the last play, it was a pretty obvious fumble. I can understand why some people may have wanted to look at it again, but it wouldn't have been overturned.|`|lTlaNwtgaa	b/c they didnt have to|`|d5368f798fac0323fe025ec0d32f5be6aa	If you take all of those away, i bet the Cards still would of lost. More disciplined team one. Gotta protect the Quarter backs, and he didnt slow up after he saw Ben throw the ball. Warner would of had 1 more chance to throw the ball into the Endzone, still wouldnt of made it. James harrison is a beast. And the refs cant catch every person during a play.|`|PA0gmwd5aa	It was my friend.Al Michaels said so.|`|h1rm40XFaa	If you look at Devin Hester's kick returns over the past few years, you can find at least 1 block in the back on every one of them. On an Arizona punt return Breaston returned for 34 yds there were 2 blocks in the back. On the holding penalty that resulted in a safety, Arizona's d-lineman bowled over the center, there was no holding, should have been a Pitt 1st down on that play. The fumble at the end of the game was a fumble, it was obvious that Warner did not have control of the ball when his arm was going forward,so no need to review it. Officials make bad calls or miss calls in every game on every play, officials can make bad calls all the time and not suffer any consequences from the league and if the coaches or players criticize them THEY get fined. The NFL needs to hire full time officials that can be held accountable.|`|tRonQPTxaa	What I think a lot of people forget is that there was a personal foul called on Pittsburgh after the supposed Cardinals fumble.  If it would have gotten reviewed and overturned, which in my opinion it would have, then the ball would have been 15 more yards closer to the endzone, making it a much less difficult throw, still probably about a 1 in 100 shot to catch it, but you have to give them the chance they deserve.  They should have AT LEAST looked at it one more time, and if they didn't overturn the call then congratulations to the Steelers.  I've seen plays get reviewed for 10 minutes in the last seconds of games during the regular season between a 4-10 team and a 6-8 team...so why not at least pretend to take another look in the biggest game of the year?
AA11993919	Probably talent.|`|8aa98ddf90b585cbbccc7bd34c260043aa	Steelers definatley have talent, but the Cardinals really buckled at the end.  Even Big Ben thought that TD pass to Holmes was going to be picked.  He pretty much just tossed it up where there were 3 Cards and 1 Steeler, and hoped Holmes came down.   There was really no excuse for that pass to be caught, and for that I blame the Cardinals players directly.    However, for 3 quarters, Pittsburgh controlled the Cards and the game.   They might have caught some breaks in the 4th, but they came up huge when they needed to.|`|UQYurvnYaa	talent|`|BovpXrk1aa	pitt talent|`|KhBmlaefaa	They had a lot of penalties. They should have played a cleaner game.|`|xvuAQ0DAaa	The refs decided the game. On that last drive the Cards knew that no matter what they did the fix was in...|`|gU4VdD6Oaa	The won with grit and talent.    The Steelers didn't have the best talent in the league for sore. Ben has his faults. Their O-Line was terrible all year (not surprising since they weren't great last year and then their center retired, Faneca left and two veteran starters were lost to injury for the year). They never could get a good goal line offense all year. Their punting was inconsistent (although Berger came through yesterday). Hines Ward was badly hurt.    But, they had an incredible defense (that TD by Fitzgerald was only the 3rd play over 40 yds they gave up all year!!!) and their offense played with lots of grit when it counted. 6 come from behind victories this season!      All-time great final drive by Roethlisberger. Incredible catch by Holmes.    the only thing to say is "SIXPACK"!|`|yFYFZRlFaa	106-56 penalty count makes it tough on any team.|`|6Ojpl6viaa	It was talent.

Do you think the Cards didn't commit those penalties? You saw the game, we all saw the game. Suck it up man. I know you hate the Steelers, I've seen your posts, but get over it. There are always going to be questionable calls, especially when they are against your team. The Cardinals played an amazing game, and they had the lead, they just blew it in the end. It happens.
JQ7Akj7Gaa	I would rather have the denver-charger game refs.  They made one really bad call.  The superbowl refs acted as if it was their first full game as a ref.  It was the worst display of officiating I have seen in awhile especially during a superbowl.      How do you not do a booth reveiw on the last play.  That was horrible.  The cards would of had another chance to bomb it becuase all thou the ball was knocked loose, he still had part of his hand on it and pushed it foward.  Then the could of throw a hail mary and with Fitz out there who knows what could of happened.    Great game by both teams, was one of the best superbowls I have seen in awhile.|`|xvuAQ0DAaa	Is there a difference, they were both incompetent...|`|51bd60494429f94771a79adedd996e77aa	THe denver game.  THat was a bad whistle, I thought they over officiated a lot of stuff last night.  On both sides.|`|AA10287427	Though I am not much of a pro football fan so had no bias as to who should have won, (though it sure was a great game) I do believe that football is not soccer and some of those players, one in particular, should have been removed from the game. The brute force of that particular contact sport still does not allow cheating by grabbing face masks or throwing choke holds around an opponents neck, much less trying to punch him out well after the play is over. I'm sure there were even some calls that never got made.
oYsSL991aa	The refs made bad calls against both teams    Roethlisberger scored a TD run in the 1st quarter but it was incorrectly overturned in replay.  The ball clearly broke the plane    The last play was a clear fumble but I do think a play at the end of a game of that magnitude should have been looked at|`|8Y583Fluaa	no it wasnt..i was rooting for the cards buit im fair...feet was in and he had control..watch the slow motion a couple of times..it was good//fair and square..what was not fair was the penalty on ruffing the passer...He was not in position to stop|`|8aa98ddf90b585cbbccc7bd34c260043aa	I was for the Cardinals and I thought the pass to Holmes was complete.  However, what I disagree with is the fact the obviously forward pass from Warner was not reviewed.    Now, I wont call it a "robbery", the Cardinals would have been, I think, 3rd down, and something like 50 yards with 15 seconds left and no time outs to score a touchdown.   So, if anything, the Cards were "robbed" of a CHANCE to win, but not of the superbowl.   After all, the Cardinals are the team that let the Steelers march down the field and allowed Holmes to make them his personal ***** on the drive that put them ahead.      Edit- Terrance, two words for you TUCK RULE.   That was a carbon copy of Tom Bradys pass if Ive ever seen one.   The ball did not come out until his arm was in a forward motion.   His arm was restrained and shoved under by the Pittsburgh defender, but that doesnt matter.   The rule is if his arm is going in a forward motion to pass, and his intention is a forward pass.   Warner clearly fit both of these, and the play should have been ruled an incomplete pass.  Period.       Im not claiming it would have mattered, but it was a BS call.  No question about it.|`|YAiKlPkMaa	The touchdown was incomplete, how do you figure that? He had total possession of the ball and BOTH feet in bounds. They practiced this play together all season long. You can see Holmes had total body control and was totally conscience of where his feet were planted.|`|xvuAQ0DAaa	The Santonio Holmes TD call was correct.  What wasn't correct was the roughing the passer call on Arizona, the "missed" illegal block in the back at the 30 during Harrison's run back, the fact Harrison was allowed to stay on the field after punching a downed player and then continuing to hit / push him even after he was flagged and lastly not reviewing the"fumble".  The refs decided the outcome of the game.|`|bed9746a7bf18f598324f858a93ae28eaa	yep and now espn is reporting it saying how bad it looked|`|812c201aa2d8bada53eda66d1dab2600aa	You're a noodle head CC|`|yFYFZRlFaa	You should know that going into the game.

They SUCKED! They called BS Calls all through the entire game. Holmes' Touchdown WAS good, and I was rooting for the CARDS, and YES, they DO rock! However, they did lose by 4 points- many of the calls were very questionable, but, I don't think at all that the Steelers TD was incomplete. Kurt Warner also through a fumble, and it was called an interception by the Refs, the MORON REFS! They ruined the Super Bowl for a LOT of folks.

Arizona did not belong in that game.  They got hot at the right time. It is hard to win a championship, no matter what the sport is, without a defense.          MO, and the rest of the Cardianl possey, IT WAS A FUMBLE.  HIS HAND WAS EMPTY WHEN IT CAME FORWARD.  STOP COMPLAINING, YOU got farther than you were supposed to.|`|n8UBfhgpaa	It was a joke. The biggest joke of the game was at the end. Even if it was a fumble, which I dont think it was, why did the refs not review it? They review everything, and such a critical play with only seconds left should have been reviewed. I am a Detroit Lions fan, and am not biast but give me a break. The biggest game of the year and thats how the refs handle it? The refs should have been the MVP for pittsburgh!! Oh and to the idiot that said Arizona shouldnt have been there? Give me a break, Pittsburgh shouldnt have been there either. The only reason they were there is because Brady got injured, otherwise it would have been a New England Championship again. New England struggled without the greatest player in the game today!! Ben roethlisberger is the most over rated QB in football, Santonio Holmes hasnt done crap all year and then suddenly he actually performs and gets MVP? Pfft. This game was a joke.|`|OQGJBZmxaa	the final pass was clearly a TD...both feet in and control of the ball all the way down. that was a great catch.    as for the officiating...this is what i say "The Steelers are the Lakers of the NFL."     if you watch as much football as i do you'll see the calls going their way in almost every game. same thing goes for the Cowboys and Patriots. folks need to realize it's all about money in the NFL. don't think so? when's the last time a small market team won the Super Bowl? doesn't happens and don't claim the Packers as they have a huge national following.     check out the penalty yards against the Cardinals. amazing.    don't even get me started on the Seahawks game.    seriously, i could write a dissertation on this subject.|`|DBuIaHMIaa	With all the grammatical and spelling errors in your "question", I am glad you are not a Steeler fan.  The TD was reviewed ad nauseum and deemed complete.  The Cards had 11 penalties and the Steelers 9, not that overwhelming.  Kurt Warner didn't get flagged for taking his helmet off and arguing with the ref on the field.  Fitzgerald chased James Harrison down the field out-of-bounds, nothing said about it.  The Pittsburgh Steelers just win... keep hating, we LOVE it.  Steelers 6, Arizona 0.
yeu09pfOaa	I agree on the Warner pass/fumble should have been reviewed ....

I know they did for a short time.|`|kQStNgzUaa	I also am not a fan of either Arizona or Pittsburgh, and I agree with you that Arizona got screwed by the "refs", who should indeed have gotten the Super Bowl MVP Award. What a travesty.|`|vMk597ZAaa	The last play should have been reviewed, but overall it was officiated pretty well.|`|bjR2uWAWaa	my opinion is that the Steelers won and that you are a cry baby!!|`|61itEiq4aa	I am with ya, I wasn't really rooting for either team and it seemed like the Steelers got away with a lot of holding that the Cardinals didn't get away with. That's always true to a certain extent in any game but I did feel the refs were favoring Pittsburgh a little. And why didn't they review the last play? The best team did not win.|`|VBHOiIBlaa	Well as you can SEE in the picture I am linking to you... THE BALL was coming out while his arm was still going backwards    http://news.yahoo.com/nphotos/slideshow/...    He did NOT have control of the ball while it was going FORWARD and he PUSHED it forwards, instead of throwing it. Making it a FUMBLE as oppsed to a PASS.|`|t81MEJ82aa	I agree. This is the 2nd Superbowl (1st vs  Seattle) where questionable calls went in the Steelers favor. I am not a Steelers hater either nor am I a fan of the teams that they have played.     I noticed that in the 4th quarter when the clock should've stopped a couple extra seconds would wind off the clock but when the Steelers went on the game winning drive a second was added back after one of the downs.    EDIT:  ratedpicks, you are correct that was a fumble. However the point was that the play was close enough that it should've been reviewed.|`|YwzkDWYLaa	Ok people lets grow up and get some lives it was a great game. There were missed calls against pittsburgh and there were missed calls against arizona also. Anyone see the holding against harrison where they held him by the facemask twice and it was called holding intead of personal fouls. The last play was clearly a fumble by warner when its clear why do we need to review it. The holding call against pittsburgh to give arizona a safetly was pretty clearly not holding. So lets suck it up people someones gotta lose and it wasnt the refs that caused it. Pittsburgh made the plays when it counted arizona couldnt. It was a great game so lets grow up and get over a few bad calls that went both ways. And questioning pittsburghs touchdown are u kidding me even arizonas coach said it was a touchdown and a great play.|`|vwTu8fY7aa	It was a forward pass and I believe it should have been ruled incomplete.   But the play that frustrated me the most was when Harrison took it back for a touchdown he was obviously down by contact before reaching the end zone.    That play decided the game.  Besides whoever said d-fences win championships was obviously wrong because Cardinals d-fence only allowed 20 points not counting the seven by Harrison.  Well six and 1 point conversion|`|dcWMqzyGaa	I agree with your assessment of both plays.  Here in yet another Stealers - - uh um Steelers Super Bowl game, the officiating seemed to sway in their favor.  It was a great game nonetheless.  They kept talking about changes to the OT rules; how about taking another look at regulation and officiating since it keeps coming up pre and post season.|`|YuuH1pyhaa	DEAD ON.  I completely agree.  All of the calls were one sided favoring the steelers(hence the name hahaha!).  Out of the many calls against arizona, two that they challenged were overturned in their favor.  Officiating was horrible next to the SEATTLE vs. STEELERS superbowl.  Talk about rigged.  Anyways beside the horrible refs the cardinals had a chance to win the game.  Their defense played great the whole game but on the last drive when it really mattered they couldn't step up.  This was a great superbowl with exciting twist and turns. I thought that last years superbowl could not be topped but both teams really stepped it up .  The refs just didn't.|`|81f4f4713b8cd1cf5f6b06c943840780aa	the ref's should not have made it so obvious who they wanted to win.  It was the most awful officiating I have seen in a long while.  They should not be allowed to officiate again.  I agree that Arizona got screwed big time!|`|CqR6daqnaa	I'm not a fan of either team and I have to agree, it was very obvious which team the refs wanted to win, especially when that last play wasn't even reviewed. Cards did get screwed. It wasn't a very valiant win for the Steelers.|`|4ITrUCc4aa	Every person in here is a moron. Watch more football and read the rulebook. You're right, only the steelers used steriods in the 70's, and the refs wanted the steelers to win in the 2000's. How come not one person has mentioned the td in the beginning that was called no touchdown when Ben cleary was not down. How about the safety on the holding call, did anyone see a hold? If the fix was in, how come the Steelers didn't even cover the spread!!! MORONS!!!
yeu09pfOaa	Heads ... Cards won|`|F5Jms9OBaa	Steelers chose tails and it was heads the Cards got the toss and they chose to kick it and recieve the ball at beginning of half time.|`|UQYurvnYaa	Heads|`|trrHx86Waa	It was heads.|`|7B9KEqCnaa	Heads. Tails always fails.|`|OFi3jBSHaa	Heads Steelers win, tails Cardinals lose.
AA12103453	Warner didn't have control of the ball as his hand moved forward. In general I agree with having questionable plays reviewed. Has an unbiased crew watching at all angles and do kind of like the NCAA. To be honest the NCAA review seems to be done better then the NFL.|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	No    Part of any game is human error    Bad calls are a part of the game    That is true in Mighty mite Football, high school football and  College football    Officials does their best.  Do they sometime make a bad call, yes  Most of the time are they right, yes    Do players or coach make bad plays, yes    When I was watching the last 30 seconds of the game last night  I watch two Cardinals watch the football rolled pass them.  A Steelers player jumped on the football.  The last play of the game should of been the cardinals, because one or both of those players should of jumped on the ball.  No Steelers were by them.  If they did, the Cardinals would of had one more play    Cardinals Fate was determined by those to players, not the officials|`|a6EndAPiaa	There is a mandate of reviewing all questionable plays in the final two minutes of a game and the final two minutes of a half.    Guess what?  The play was NOT questionable.  Empty hand moving forward = fumble 100% of the time.  That fact is said at least 20 times a year during a game in the NFL when some coach throws the red flag for a similar play.  There is no way that call would have been overturned.    The Cardinals lost because they lost it was not due to officiating.  None of the cardinals players or coaches are saying there was bad officiating why are there so many people on Y!A saying that?|`|YAiKlPkMaa	That's why their coaches are handed opportunities to challenge the call of the refs.|`|k6ChY3iSaa	hhhmmmm - I thought they were just following the game trend of reviewing EVERY play the Steelers made ...|`|VBHOiIBlaa	http://news.yahoo.com/nphotos/slideshow/...    He didnt have control of the ball while his hand was still going back. I even posted a picture.    A hand can PUSH the ball forward.    Also, why did Warner walk off the field as soon as the Steelers defender jumped on the ball? Did Warner argue the play? NO because he even knew he didnt have control of the ball.
QcmNHRzyaa	SP Vibe|`|xbuZFjveaa	Basically anything that doesnt have an electric circuit board. Youre probably going tohave the most luck with tactical style guns like BT or Tippman. Try a Tippman A-5. It comes with a cyclone feed hopper but its pnuematic, not electric so it still shoots faster than a typical gravity fed gun will with less chopped balls, but the hopper is powered by your co2 instead of electronics. The only downside is that you will go through more co2

PPwfY6Cxaa	i think vermeil is retired. i think herm edwards might be next dallas cowboys head coach|`|XLXncQu9aa	Dick Vermeil doesn't want to coach again.  He said that when he retired.  It was time for him to leave and that is what he did.  Besides, he already has a championship with the Rams and took the Eagles to the super bowl.  Why return now?  He left a legacy with the Eagles, Rams, and Chiefs.  That is one thing some athletes and coaches get wrong.  They return to the game with their legacy in tact, and the leave with a spot on their record.  I think its best that he leave with a clean slate like he did.  And if you are talking about Vermeil returning to the Chiefs, absolutely not.  Its better to get some fresh blood in there to turn that franchise around.|`|yuGhmhGuaa	Oh boo hoo hoo, dont make anyone cry here|`|z0Va3qTDaa	Nah, he would probably ruin Herm's rebuilding plan by trading Jamaal Charles, Dorsey, Bowe, and Albert for Jake Delhomme and Muhsin Muhammad(no offense to his legacy, just noting on how he didn't go young and look at us now)
gWLhIoIiaa	i agree. it's nothing more than ridicule disguised as a "question". all the critics want a say in the matter and feel the need to ask their very own question for trolling purposes    what i dont understand is the people who answer the same damn question all the time|`|RC4K4TQ4aa	well Federer shouldn't cry like a 5 year old... especially given the fact he still takes home a million dollars..    greedy crybaby|`|rKbJ51XIaa	Well,we cannot say anything to his emotions.He can cry,but the questions are killing me.
2VGbJtnCaa	It's the Rickster the bitter cards fan!|`|51e7baee76cfe5758f817c35c038f4c7aa	The World Wildlife Fund is pretty real.    There are two kinds of people in the world.  Those who scream "Why aren't the refs calling those fouls," and those who scream, "Let them play."    In my experience, the former is the team who believes they are being held and the later is the team who is doing the holding.    As for bias, those guys in stripped shirts don't give a darn who wins the game.  Every foul that was called was there and had an impact.  The Steelers ended up losing more points directly to fouls than they gained anyway.|`|ptDHZK7Jaa	come on now i know a ton of football players in college and them dont play they hit hard so i believe it is real well football n is wwf wresling i think so i guess its half fake|`|8LzF0ye8aa	They probably should have let some of those calls go (the face-mask and the roughing the passer), but the holding calls were legit.|`|gIRusZKpaa	nfl|`|ULw1777caa	Are you kidding?  There was no bias, both teams had calls on them all night, look at the box score.|`|sPiwb8Hraa	Officiating is somewhat purposely relaxed during the Superbowl due to the hype, pressure, and competitiveness. WWF is a comedy.    NFL is more real.|`|bwYVs2k9aa	i agree|`|yg3Pveakaa	The ref calls can impact the game but it is not like the commisioner is giving the Head Coaches the cue.    Here is a sample:  Roger G: Hey, Mike you will be winning today I have the refs to help you out.  Mike T: Ok  you should not have done that. We will beat our own way.  Roger G: Hell No. I placed my bet on your team, you should not lose. I did the same thing last year betting for the Patriots but Eli got the lucky throw so I lost a lot.  Mike T: Have you told this to Kurt and Ken? I have told James that he will be intercepting his pass before the halftime just to make this entertaining.  Roger G: I have, but he said he will have a couple of long passes before that will happen. He also said just for good measure I will drop the ball for a fumble is that OK.    Haha..This will not happen teams have their goals and none of them are scripted like this. That is too low, this is not like the Longest Yard but as saw on the movie, Adam Sandler did not let his team down.

q2TOb6unaa	The best gloves for all around snowboarding are these http://www.dakine.com/snowboard/gloves/g...     They are quite costly but they keep your hands warm and dry and protected. They're Dakine's top glove for low profile and high performance.    If you do the backcountry a lot I would look into the Apollo glove http://www.dakine.com/snowboard/gloves/g... This glove is the ultimate bad weather glove from dakine so if you are one to venture when it's -30C out and blowing snow, this glove is a good choice.    The frontier glove is the lowest model in Dakine's summit series. I wouldn't buy a low model glove considering they aren't usually that well made. At least aim for something in the mid to high model range if you don't want your fingers to be cold and wet by the end of the day.    Hope this helps dude, good luck.|`|904AtSbhaa	those gloves are fine they are good for all around and i hear they keep your hands really warm

7rpILeYtaa	Kozlov wins a battle royal on smackdown this week, so he is in  Jeff Hardy will use his rematch clause.    so SD EC will be:  1. Edge  2. Triple H  3. Undertaker  4. Big Show  5. Kozlov  6. Jeff Hardy    as for Raw, i want Kane to have another chance to get in  for then it will be  1. Cena  2. Jericho  3. Kingston  4. Mysterio  5. Knox  6. Kane        2) i am predicting that Cena will retain, even though i would like Kane to have a title reign|`|uiRkBwa9aa	1)im guessing for smackdown that Jeff Hardy and umaga are going to be in the chamber    2)personaly i think Big Show will walk out as WWE champion because the look on vickies face after he picked her up meant that she likes him so...... big show winning big for sure!!!  3)as for raws match i see either kane or rey mysterio walking out as champion.    4) the reason why i think rey will win because batista will earn a shot at the title at WM25 cause orton is facing austin and it would be good to see the 2 friends face off    5)if kane wins i can see him facing off against the likes of cena or possibly batista in 1on1 or a thriple threat match!!!|`|4c479c9c27bebd404d7ba657763fe54faa	Vladimir Koslov and Jeff Hardy|`|GRoOEkNeaa	Kozlov, and Jeff Hardy.

cOPCNP7Laa	I doubt so.    Shevchenko spent two years playing more golf games than football and of course his instincts, reflexes and playing skills dwindled down to nothing, nevermind his morale and general fitness.    He has struggled back in Milan but I admit he has also hardly played. I don't know he wouldn't be better if he actually got playing time, but it seems he will need a bit of this to settle and each game is so important he is not getting it.    I think Defoe and Keane will do well.|`|is0myvrHaa	nahhh shevchenko, started playing badly wen he was at chelsea so wen he went to milan he was bad there..but defoe was good for portsmouth and will probably be good for spurs, and keane was only gone a little while, so it wont be that bad, and they might not have to compete for a place cant they play up front together?

I'd take that kind of slap any day.|`|GwawzO5Faa	No. They had offered him a 3 year deal and he didn't want that either.   They are obviously getting annoyed with him and the situation.|`|AYiVipawaa	Ya. He may be getting older, but he's as good as he was a few years ago, especially in the NL. The Yanks won't get him. They've already signed contracts, that add up to 441 mill.
dc9b3e7055e1c27e159a52736ac8a9aeaa	That movie's one of the reasons I originally got into skating, and I need to pick up a copy of it. I've been skating for two years now and I still love that movie.

zoDEqv6Zaa	Nobody, it's the same time of the year but this time the Lakers will not make any trade. There's nobody available at a high level Caliber type of player, there isn't. I think the Lakers are just fine, it's time for the younger players to step it up and i really like Trevor Ariza, he's playing with a lot of confident right now and he was all over the place during the Knicks game.|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	Their backup point guard obviously.|`|KdhNCnEjaa	There are no big men available who would help the Lakers, unless they take a risk on Jermaine O'Neal for Odom and Farmar.     Ray Allen will replace Nelson.    And MC, clearly you have never played basketball in your life. Pierce said he had a charliehorse, and everybody who plays any sport knows they are agony for the 5 minutes they last.|`|3teWTOPqaa	Mihm for Rudy Gay, lol.    I think Ray Allen/Mo Williams will replace Nelson.    To be honest the Lakers doesn't need a trade or something extra that's going to cram up the salary space and preventing us from resigning or getting a player in the off-season. I have faith in Andrew returning this season, and we did pretty well last year without him, so it's not over, not by a long shot. Oh and Kobe scoring 61pts definitely helps.    EDIT: Also Ariza is starting to develop that jump shot, once he does that and we have a staple SF, then Pierce better be faking injuries to stay out for good this time.

Your team should be treated like the Yankees for their greatness and hated on by all the haters...and also remember to let the haters hate cause thats their ****** job.

Qd6mOb1saa	I don't understand either.  The maximum number of sets for a woman to win a grand slam is 21.  The maximum number of sets for a man to win a grand slam is 35.

It just underscores how much better she is than her opposition.  She's the Shaq of women's tennis, when she's got her weight under control and healthy, she's just dominant. Venus is more like Tim Duncan- better fundamental skills and plays smarter, but doesn't have the huge physical advantage.    Head-to-head? No different than any men's  1 vs womens  1 - those matches wouldn't be very competitive in any era- Sampras vs Hingis, McEnroe vs Seles, Connors vs Evert. Same degree of destruction.    As the women's side has grown in popularity (for about 6-7 years it was the only tennis people cared about) , the prize money has finally caught up to the men.  Why shouldn't that be the case? It's the product that pulls in more viewers!  Be happy the Federer-Nadal rivalry has continued for a couple of years now, cause men's tennis seriously needed the boost!|`|mWp1JpkEaa	wen i 1st herd about dis i thought it was some ones idea of a sick twisted joke. It dosent make any sence. dose *** wits up the top need a kick in the head. i fink dose UK clowns came up wif the idea|`|hesHGsW8aa	Physically men and women are not equal. However, if Serena were to have been extended to a third set, this is the equivalent of energy spent in a four or five set match for the men. Hence the equal pay.|`|vejHKjEDaa	Because for many years no tournaments gave women equal prize money and, in today's world of tennis, it's assumed the women's game is as much of a draw as the men's since tickets to the women's matches sell out as quickly as the men's.  Why shouldn't Serena win equal prize money for being at the top of the women's game?  See first link and note the applicable date is 8 years ago.    Billie Jean King won 265 career titles, including 12 Grand Slam singles finals, and earned a bit less than $2 million during her years on the circuit (1959-1980) - this is not a fortune in today's market considering her 21 years on the courts.  At Wimbledon she won 6 singles titles plus another 14 in mixed and women's doubles.  She was 37 when she won her last title in women's doubles at the US Open with Martina Navratilova as her partner.     More recently, Steffi Graf earned $22 million during her career and is the only player to have won four Grand Slams four times plus, in 1988, winning the Olympic Gold. She won 22 Grand Slam singles titles (7 Wimbledon, 6 French, 5 US Open and 4 Australian Open).  Pete Sampras has won 14 Grand Slam singles titles and his earnings were $ 43 million - he and Steffi were on the circuit during the same years and he never won the French.    The WTA has never stated that the women wouldn't play five sets - they've never been asked to, perhaps, because it's a scientific fact that men are physically stronger than women.  Here's a copy-paste from Wikipedia:  Longest men's match by time played: Fabrice Santoro versus Arnaud Clment at the 2004 French Open, it lasted 6 hours and 33 minutes. The match began on May 24, 2004 but was suspended for bad light. Santoro won the match 6-4, 6-3, 6-7 (5), 3-6, 16-14.[1]  Longest women's match by time played occurred between Vicki Nelson-Dunbar and Jean Hepner in 1984 lasting 6 hours and 31 minutes with Nelson-Dunbar winning 6-4, 7-6 (11). One point lasted 643 strokes and 29 minutes.[5]     The adjective you've used to describe Serena Williams is rude and inexcusable as is your 'abbreviation' of a swear word.  Black women are larger in the buttocks than those of other races and black men find this attractive. You might wish to consider improving your vocabulary to include words which are not offensive to others and might, also, profit from reading a book on manners/socially acceptable behaviour.     Prime Minister Putin would, In my opinion, be insulted to learn you're using his name as he's a university graduate who speaks three languages..|`|pqExee6Oaa	Yeah it's stupid, the women should get payed half.|`|xqOWI8VUaa	To make the women feel like they r equal to men.|`|6QhACK70aa	cause jesse jackson and obama would be in streets protesting for racism now lol|`|HNnVrvCfaa	I have no problem with women players receiving equal prize money - as soon as they start playing 5 sets.|`|2d1281aa57d4a1706e1d2a23da968188aa	Of course the stadium was full during the Federer/Nadal final, it's a great rivalry in the mold of Borg/McEnroe.       Wasn't that long ago that men's tennis was a ratings wasteland... Like most of the 1990's and early 2000's.  Ever since America ran out of top men's contenders in the late 80's.    Who bothered to watch Federer beat guys like Nalbandian and Phillippoussis?  Roddick never developed into a serious threat.  Sampras had the same problem, no real rival for most of his run. Agassi's rejuvenation towards the end of his career was a freaking godsend.  For awhile the ladies were going strong and hardly anyone cared about men's tennis, until Nadal came along.      I agree that best-of-5 set matches should pay better than best-of-3.  But it all comes down to where sponsors put their money.|`|Sca69Krvaa	It's amazing how one person can ask such a lot of retarded questions in such a small amount of time.    Why don't you piss off and bother some other sporting questions as it is obvious you are not a fan of tennis.    It's great Serena get's paid the same amount.  Makes up for all the women out there who do the same if not more work than the stupid men they work along side and get paid less.    Maybe she broke the glass ceiling with her 'fat ***'. Good on her I bet she could beat your sorry **** in a tennis match anyday.
JEMtVVkBaa	HE DIDNT FRIGGEN LIE ABOUT IT!!    he probably had thought that the ball had hit the stumps!! Everything happens so much faster than in real time. If there was no such thing as a slow motion replay, no one would have noticed anything. Brad Haddin probably thought that the ball had hit the stumps.    What is he meant to say now anyway?? You can say that you would have done this this and that if you were in his position, but he thought that the ball had hit the stumps!!!    its obvious that it didnt. but at that current time, he thought that he did - there was only one angle on that slow-mo shot I saw...mabe there was a second. But just because it looks like one thing happned on one angle, doesnt mean it happened.    I would be interested to see how it looked on the opposite angle!!|`|fsLMFIpgaa	I was wondering the same thing about India when the match fixing happened, when Bhaji racially abused Symonds then he & Sachin lied about it? Thankfully none of our players have done anything like that.Any mistake of the umpires is not the players fault.I suggest you go & question your own players before worrying about us.|`|5GUjFJjkaa	Just ask all the Indian players caught match fixing or maybe Dhoni and Ganguly who both have a habit of claiming bump ball catches.

Read the meaning of a troll     An Internet troll, or simply troll in Internet slang, is someone who posts controversial, inflammatory, irrelevant or off-topic messages in an online community, such as an online discussion forum or chat room, with the intention of provoking other users into an emotional response[1] or to generally disrupt normal on-topic discussion.[2]    Now just go away and play with Gangulys,GOOGLYS|`|tSnf4eDqaa	Well goodness me silvergirl that was a bit of a naive question if you truly are studying as you say you are.  Given the current issues within cricket you will find people being very defensive.  Every nationality has their cheats in one or more sports - but often the 'cheating' is a perception by the other team.  Ask any All Black fan about 'that' forward pass in the last rugby world cup, or the infamous 'hand of God' with footballer Maradona.  Do you really think that Haddin (since that's who, I'm assuming, you're talking about with your opening remarks) was blatantly cheating ands then lying about it?|`|BmzucgU8aa	No one will EVER convince me that Haddin didn't know the ball missed the stump. It is obvious for everyone to see - and you can see on the side on angle that after Haddin claps, he stops, he knows something wasn't quite right. I'm not sure that all Australians are cheats - I lived there for a couple of years, and in many ways they are a lot like Kiwi's (maybe not as shy!). But in that particular instance Haddin knew something wasn't right it was all over his face. The stupid thing is if he had come out and said "I THOUGHT the ball had hit the stumps, sorry etc" instead of still trying to insist that it didn't it would have all passed.

Thats why we're sitting 5th 5 points behind Villa(who have the thing called "luck")    Wenger has raised the standerds of football at Arsenal football club, no more of the "boring boring Arsenal", true we havent won anything in like 5 years but he is the MAN, I hope you're not an Arsenal fan, calling for Wenger's head when we're drawing/losing, then saying you want him at the club forever(thats what I want no matter what happens).    BS.|`|mRF1xv7iaa	NO!    there is nothing wrong with arsenal or arsene wenger!    we are in 5th place of the best english league and are unbeaten in 10, are in the last 16 of the champions league, still in the F.A. cup,   so why is that bad?  would you sack someone for that?    we are unlucky to be in 5th place because of all the injuries especially in midfield(three of our best midfielders are injured, fabregas, rosicky and walcott)    so please everyone stop slagging arsenal of!    :)|`|N7fNwIQSaa	One problem if you sack Wenger many of our players will leave we are talking Fabregas, Adebayor, van Persie and many more who are more loyal to Wenger than to the club which is a sad fact|`|WK8887Tsaa	No. Hang your head in shame. He has made Arsenal one of the "big four" and they will still finish in the top four me feels. I think Villa will stay there though, so just got to work out who'll drop out.    Anyway, Wenger will never ever be sacked. He would be "moved upstairs" if the board wanted to get rid of him

And also fans, there probably some elderly in the fans and it is most dangerous to old people. Also, to see the strobe light it would have to be dark and that would mean they have to play in the dark and it would be really hard to find the puck. If i had to play with a strobe light on i would get really pissed.|`|8crDZMU4aa	They are not playing for fun.This is a job and they don't need the distraction of strobe lights.  Also,some fans attending may have a seizure disorder and this is a known trigger.  If you saw the Montreal/Bruins game on Sunday,Feb.1,you would know that certain things are not only distracting but the cameras have difficulty focusing,  Montreal wore retro sweaters with red,white and blue horizontal stripes.When a linesman was near the picture was somewhat out of focus.This might happen with strobes too.|`|4go3lFooaa	Because this would happen:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJ2Vhvf-P...     or     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Mes053P3...

98f9000f3689e28983bfec6d7a62524baa	We are talking about 2 completely different players here.  In two different eras!  Jonah was huge and used his size to bump and hand off  players but lacked skill and talent that Shane has!  Shane  can run around and dodge players, Jonah just barged through them and lacked agility that Shane has.  Shane defends, he tackles players, Jonah hardly did this despite his size!    Shane can read the game well in a split second another thing that Jonah lacked!  I would go as far as saying, Shane is a better tactical player than Jonah ever was!      I mean how many RWC winners did he get through to score that try in the Autumn Internationals........was it 5, 6???????     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzjyO7DJ1...|`|f9hiPMDxaa	Williams is good but he is no Lomu. Currently I would rate Williams behind Rokocoko, Ndgane, Tuquiri. As wingers go he is not up with the top rank from previous years. You couldn't put him in the same league as a Lomu or Campese or those fleet footed Welsh wingers from their golden period.|`|ETarSy9Maa	No other wing is anywhere near as good as Lomu, in fact only a small group of players from all positions can be compared to him.|`|urL4MGSvaa	Thats funny! Jonah and Shane hmmm sounds rediculously rediculous..    I would compare shane to Mils Muliaina but I reckon Mils is slightly better than Shane - I suppose the papers have to do something to boost the northern hemisphere teams|`|3a06298a67f5b113473132c0d29eac28aa	He is IRB World Player of the Year mind you.    In respect, rugby is a different game now to the days of Jonah.  Jonah hit the scene right at the end of amateurism, and was streets ahead of everyone else.  He didn't really have the grace and sidestep of Shane, his main asset was his sheer size and brute strength, the likes of which had not been seen on the wing before.  Now, players are stronger, train more, put on more weight and can stand up better to the "all power" winger.  Take the failure of Vainacolo on the world stage as an example.    It will be interesting to see how Shane performs this summer, in what will almost certainly be his last Lions tour, a stage at which he has yet to perform to the levels that he has found for Wales.|`|rSbC6jAkaa	totally agree!!!!    lomu changed rugby!!! wat has williams done???    plus habana, rokocoko and rubeni are better!!! think the guy who wrote the article was on drugs or something!!! they always tend to build up the NH players as gods! they 4get that the big power houses are in the SH!|`|lvkSU8Apaa	if Jonah Lomu were the same size as Shane Williams who do you think would come out in top in a match?    and Rockoko, Siviavatu etc. they haven't got the vision and ability of Williams, they just have a better team around them giving them better opportunities|`|HWmjIOaBaa	Lol!  The reporters' been spending too much time reading grafetti at the  bus stops!|`|AA11678048	Shane Williams is just another bloke. Good no doubt, but at the end of the day he's just another rugby player. Jonah Lomu was the face of rugby. I went to Malaysia and I was in the cab with a guy who couldn't even speak english. I tried to explain to him I was stopping over on my way to NZ. He couldn't really understand. So thinking I might as well give it a shot, I said RUGBY! And straight away his eyes lit up and he went AH RUGBY! JONAH LOMU! JONAH LOMU!   I doubt there will ever come a time when a cabbie who speaks not a word of english will bellow Shane Williams' name at the top of his lungs.

Being dragged down by the dishonor of others. Participation in a shameful or regrettable act. Inescapable guilt, mistrust, and doubt. May indicate a death or other catastrophic loss.    The card to the left represents how others perceive your attitude. Three of Cups (Abundance): A time of merriment and reflection spent in the company of friends and loved ones. The conclusion of a matter in plenty and perfection. The strength of a diverse community being brought together. May suggest a celebration, festival, anniversary, wedding, baby shower, or other joyous gathering.    The card at the bottom represents what you cannot confront or are hiding from yourself. Nine of Cups (Happiness): Contentment and satisfaction in romance, friendship, or other relationships. Achieving your deepest desires and savoring beauty and sensual pleasures. A state of joy and abundance radiating fulfillment and bliss.|`|0a115b3a813d3ea64d4f07d95c126639aa	LOL, I have comcast and live in Tucson AZ and we were watching it at a friends house so I missed it.

AA12362958	Hate to agreed to the explanation but think it's really more logical if that was true-that Keane's what the board wants and not who Rafael want! That's why Rafael don't play him that much and even use him to save certain matches where we lost/drew!    Nevertheless, Keane is a good player but he really should have settle in faster and snatch the chances when Torres was injured!    Wish him all the Best back in Spurs! But this Spurs is not the same Spurs he left behind last season! Good Luck!|`|KsFV7CJWaa	I think you are right to a certain extent. Keane wasn't given time to settle but another thing is that Liverpool were looking like genuine title contenders for a long long time.They could not waste their precious points by giving him opportunities. Another factor is that both Kuyt and Torres are better players than him, and their performances have been outstanding and he didn't impress much, so Rafa didn't let him play. Btw Rafa often acts weird which causes him trouble.

AA10087082	FC Barcelona    -- They hit the woodwork four times in losing the 1961 European Cup final 3-2 to Benfica.  -- 1967 La Liga against Real Madrid the referee added 10 minutes of injury time during which Real scored to win 1-0. The referee claimed afterwards that his watch had stopped and he was unaware of how much time had remained.  -- Barcelona finish the 1971 season level on points with Valencia and have the better goal difference, but title is lost due to La Liga statutes of tiebreaking based on the two meetings between the clubs.  -- 1979 Cup Winners Cup. Defeat tournament specialists Anderlecht via penalties.  -- As they challenged for the title in 1981, star player Enrique Quini was kidnapped and held for ransom for 25 days in April. Barcelona gained only one point in their next four matches during the time Quini was out, thus they faded from title contention.  -- 1986 European Cup: defeated Gothenburg in the semifinals on penalties; lost the final to Steaua on penalties.  -- Win their first European Cup in 1992, the goal scored off a free kick that many felt should not have been awarded.  -- Won 1992 La Liga on the last day of the season after leaders Real Madrid lost away to Tenerife.  -- Won 1993 La Liga on the last day of the season after leaders Real Madrid lost away to Tenerife. (this is not a double post - it actually happened two years in a row)  -- Won 1994 La Liga on the last day of the season after leaders Deportivo failed to convert a 90th minute penalty in the 0-0 against Valencia.  -- 2001 qualify for Champions League ahead of Valencia after Rivaldo scores 89th minute winner in showdown between the two clubs on the last day of the season.  -- 2005. Knocked out of Champions League on controversial John Terry goal that sees Carvalho blocking Valdes from getting to the ball.  -- Knocked out of Copa del Rey after Ronaldinho sent off against Zaragoza for a supposed tackle from behind. Pundits agreed that replays showed he came in from the side and that the tackle was barely worthy of a booking.  -- Win 2006 CL final in a match rife with controversy: Advantage not played that would have seen Barcelona score and Lehmann stay on the pitch; Arsenal scoring off a free kick awarded for a dive by Eboue; Eto'o equalizing from an offside position.  -- Barcelona finish the 2007 season level on points with Real Madrid and have the better goal difference, but title is lost due to La Liga statutes of tiebreaking based on the two meetings between the clubs.

Pero investigaciones posteriores sugieren que el dolo de masas, pudo haber muerto de una complicacin derivada de un ataque de epilepsia, efecto que slo despus de 20 a?os de su muerte la medicina parece haber descubierto.    Filkins se?ala que la explicacin oficial en torno a la causa de la muerte es errnea, puesto que en las reacciones alrgicas a los frmacos se suelen presentar indicios como hinchazn irregular en el cuello o insuficiencia respiratoria. En vez de eso, Filkins piensa que Lee muri a causa de un sndrome de muerte sbita inesperada, derivada de la epilepsia Sudep, sndrome que no se identific hasta 1995.    El sndrome se manifiesta mediante un violento ataque que paraliza los pulmones y el corazn del paciente. ste cobra la vida de alrededor de 500 personas al a?o en UK, y es ms frecuente entre varones de 20 a 40 a?os; suele venir provocado por situaciones de enorme stress o por falta prolongada de sue?o.

Esta enfermedad no presenta previos sintomas,es aguda y mortal. Es debido a problemas congenitos o adquiridos y no es mas que el adelgazamiento de las venas o arterias cerebrales las cuales en 1 momento de estres o ejercicio pueden rebentarse y provocar 1 HEMORRAGIA SUBARACNOIDEA en el cerebro provocando el dolor y la muerte.

Estando en el apartamento de su amiga Betti Ting Pei, alrededor de las 14 horas de ese da, Lee sinti un profundo dolor de cabeza y Betti, segn su versin, le proporcion un analgsico y se fue a descansar. Lee se sumi en la inconsciencia de la cual ya no volvera. Fue llevado a un hospital, en el que ingres ya fallecido. Nada se pudo hacer, aparte de la autopsia, que revel una inflamacin desmesurada del cerebro que literalmente se comprimi en su crneo. Se sospech que la muerte de Lee estaba asociada al consumo de hachs y que el medicamento proporcionado por Ting Pei le provoc un estado de shock alrgico. Hoy en da an persisten dudas sobre la causa de su deceso.    Lee tena casi 33 a?os y los mdicos aseguraron que su cuerpo -admirablemente formado- no representaba ms de 18 a?os biolgicos. Se ha sabido que antes de su muerte Lee haba sufrido unos extra?os desmayos de los que se haba recuperado. La causa ms probable de su muerte pudo deberse a hipersensibilidad al frmaco Equagesic. El funeral que sigui fue apostesico en Hong Kong; la multitud de admiradores fue tan impresionante que el ambiente donde estaba el atad de Lee era sofocante. Fue enterrado en Seattle, EE.UU. Tuvo con su esposa Lynda Emery (ahora conocida como Linda Lee Cadwell), dos hijos: Shannon Lee y Brandon Lee.

Agora te pergunto.. esse francs est errado? Eu acho que n?o...    Agora, a partir desse comentrio, responderei sua pergunta.  O Brasil conquistou todos estes ttulo de uma forma justa e merecida, claro!!! Isso n?o podemos nagar, mas a partir do momento que as pessoas come?am a transformar um esporte como o centro nico e exclusivo de interatividade do pas, a  nessecidade de ganhar vai falar mais alto que tudo.  Pense comigo: Todos os jornais, telejornais, programas de tv etc...etc..etc... s falavam nesse campeonato. Todo mundo (inclusive eu) ramos dispensados mais cedo do trabalho para ver o jogo da  sele??o, o Brasil interio parava..  natural que o sentimento patriota nas?a em nossos cora??es, agora o q n?o devemos  misturar nossos sentimentos com obriga??o!  A copa  para mostrar quem  o melhor do mundo no futebol, mas... e da!!!! O que o povo vai ganhar de bom com tudo isso.... NADA! Acho q devemos priorizar as coisas que tragam algo de bom para ns.    O Brasileiro vive para o futebol e esquece que, em muitos casos, n?o  o futebol que vai encher a barriga dele.    Como achei que ficou confuso tudo isso, vou resumir numa frase tudo o que disse:  "N?o devemos nos preocupar com o futebol, copa, ttulos etc e achar que somos os donos das bolas e dos gramados, devemos simplesmente aceitar que esses campeonatos (fteis na minha opini?o) existem e q todos tem o deireito de ganhar, pois quem ganhar a ta?a com certeza ter feito o melhor e ter merecido, seja o Brasil ou n?o seja."|`|f34de3ea75e7523db570e8260ec0028aaa	N?o temos que ganhar todas as copas, mas n?o podemos deixa-la de ganhar por falta de  "interesse" de jogar .|`|06f97b846836c2e9eca40a3263f75ea2aa	 nossa cultura ..rsrsrsr    Um abra?o!!|`|833582bb8044c27a84f93879b1b43d2aaa	Olha...

764221463ecc60c819e7e41f6a44d8ddaa	Eu particularmente  sou um f? de Rubens Barrichello. Indubitavelmente ele  um grande piloto e uma grande pessoa. Ele venceu em todas as categorias pelas quais passou, antes da F1. Na temporada de 1993 estreou muito bem na categoria mxima do automobilismo sendo eleito o piloto revela??o do ano, pilotando um carro da Equipe irlandesa Jordan. O carro era muito ruim mas quem, que goste de automobilismo, n?o se lembra do GP da europa, em Donington Park, naquele mesmo ano. Barrichello deu Show na chuva ultrapassou a Benetton do Shumacher, as Ferraris de Alesi e Berger a Mclaren de Andreti e as Williams ( os carros de outro planeta) de Hill e Prost. Ele s n?o conseguiu ultrapassar um piloto...Um tal de "Ayrton Senna" que com certeza  o maior gnio que a F1 j viu. Estava na 2a posi??o quando a equipe o deixou sem combustvel e ele teve que abandonar a corrida com uma Pane Seca. Aps a morte de Senna, Rubinho se sentiu na obriga??o de substitui-lo no cora??o de todos os brasileiros. Este, talvez, tenha sido o maior erro da carreira dele. Veio a poca da Stewart, pricipalmente em 99, ano em que Barrichello, em algumas corridas do ano, dava espetculo contra s Mclarens de Hakkinen e Coulthard e Ferraris de M.Shumacher e Ivine. Este ano foi t?o positivo que o brasileiro foi disputado pelas mesmas equipes e acabou assinando com a Ferrari para a Temporada 2000 da F1. Fez vrias corridas brilhantes pela Ferrari, conseguiu grandes vitrias e tb foi impedido de vencer algumas vezes. Quando teve carro para ser campe?o (2002/2003/2004 principalmente) tinha o melhor piloto do mundo na atualidade como companheiro de equipe. Agora na Honda ele est fazendo um excelente trabalho e eu ainda acredito que ele, com toso suporte dos japoneses, ainda ser campe?o na F1|`|a659e5d4ff0d76ec347447a97bf1d63aaa	Barrichello  um bom corredor na Frmula 1, senao nao estaria nas escuderias top 10 .

In today's world the most underater QB of all time is EASILY Otto Graham.  Based on championships won (which people seem to put SO much weight on) he is EASILY the greatest QB of all time and almost no one knows who he is.    He led the Browns to TEN straight championships and won SEVEN of them.    OVERATED?  I'm going with Fran Tarkenton.  Other than being able to run for his life, he proved he was veryt average otherwise.  He was never able to win a championship despite being on perinial playoff teams with him at the helm. Always a bridesmade. Came to let down an extrodinary defense with his ineptitude.|`|78ce195faf349d536a605e34a34cd17aaa	over:  McNabb, Cunningham    under:  John Unitas was better than was usually acknowledged.  So was Terry Bradshaw.|`|AA12349996	I think Alex Smith is under-rated because he's a lot better than the average person thinks he is.    And I think Ben Rothlisberger is a tad bit over-rated.  He does just enough not to loose the game for the Steelers, and his supporting cast carries a ton of the load.  I doubt he could go to a team with less talent and succeed like Carson Palmer does in Cincinnati or Chris Simms does in Tampa Bay.|`|053df6475513e750d719a50f60f4ce35aa	Honestly the most underrated quaterback is Trent Green of the Chiefs. I hate the Chiefs but look at his numbers there Pro Bowl numbers and he doesnt even have great recievers except there TE. Over rated quaterback now that would be Drew Bledsoe of the Cowboys. He can put up numbers but would you want him to lead you 21 down in the 4th quater. He stays in the pocket way tooo long. The most overrated quaterback of all time is Joe Namath all he ever did was guarantee a Super Bowl. If he was that good where was the repeat they didnt lose any stars that offseason. The most underrated quaterback ever would be Bart Starr. He is in the Hall of Fame but most people wouldnt put him as there QB or even a back up. He was the first QB to win back to back superbowls and superbowl one mvp. Come on|`|9d05d6c773a0d7697d322cb007262001aa	drew bledsoe is over rated    The jets berringer is underrated|`|b15b17a57ee60f2d63b4932bffdc440caa	Underrated would have to be David Carr of the Texans, if he can get an O-Line to give him time he could amazing.  Overrated would be Peyton (can't play under pressure) or Vick (great athlete, bad QB)|`|AA11416253	under rated-  Donavan McNabb; because he has proved himself several times without a real team(ie; they want to the NFC big game 4 times with only him leading the team), and when he finally gets a receiver he goes to the big game.  I think they dont give him enough credit.  if any of the QB's on other teams would have had the same squad; they may have not produced the same numbers.  Over rated- Michael Vick; everyone hypes him up, and he cant throw a ball to save his life.  His younger brother will surpass him.  He should be a wide out, cause he runs faster than any other on the team.  He is a overpaid QB in my eyes, and John MADDEN always says great things about him.  well what do you think|`|cf4f742bedd1173153bd9437905a828baa	Alex Smith is the most underrated.  Over Rated is Eli Manning.|`|bc3740b818721af3d29ce184e9ee05feaa	Judging from the answers so far, Ben Roethlisberger would be a good pick for underrated. Rather than simply not losing the games, he plays a big part in winning them. Perceptions might be biased because he has struggled in half of his playoff games, but last year showed that the Steelers are much better when he is healthy and in the game. He has achieved quite a bit in only two seasons. Jake Plummer would also be a good choice. He had a phenomenal season last year, yet because he and the entire Broncos team lost one playoff game to a team no one else beat in the playoffs either, the Broncos panicked into trading up to draft a QB and the national media are expecting a Plummer meltdown. On the contrary, both Plummer and Roethlisberger should perform well this year, and it would be neither a surprise nor a fluke if they were to meet again in this season's AFC Championship Game.    As for overrated, Tom Brady certainly is; he is very good, but he is far from the sole reason that the Patriots won championships. And the most overrated now and of all time is almost certainly Kurt Warner. Some rather mediocre QBs have succeeded in the Rams' offense; indeed, the Rams became contenders not when they signed Warner but when they drafted Orlando Pace. A good line, good receivers, and Marshall Faulk made the QB's job far easier.|`|AA11674745	Honestly, I think it is Michael Vick. I feel it is because the Falcons want him to emphasize his flashiness and running ability so that fans will be willing to come to the games. If he was in a system where he was taught to be a real QB and rely on his overall talent, he would be a great one. I know he is promoted a lot, but like I said, he's just not being utilized correctly. It reminds me of Randall Cunningham when he was here in Philly. I could not stand him or Buddy Ryan.    As for overrated, it has to be Peyton (not Eli) Manning. This will be the test year for him without the option of Edgerrin James to keep the defenses guessing. Marvin Harrison will still be his dependable self but Manning has had a better system built around him than Michael Vick.    This is not sour grapes, but Tom Brady is another example of a good, all-around QB in a dedicated system that enables him to shine like a superstar. Nothing against him, it just proves my point that when it all comes together, a QB can look great. Joe Montana is another one.|`|AA12235811	Right now, I'd have to say Jake Delhomme is underrated. Overrated, I'd say Culpepper or McNabb. Ever, I don't know, I'd have to think about it a bit.|`|AA11103130	Underrated - Jake Plummer    Overrated - Ben Roethlisberger

Saludos|`|67028f7e2e48f64b6cc935938ae9f627aa	?Hola! Yo creo que el mejor deporte en cuanto a complejidad se refiere es el basketball debido a que al practicarlo, utilizas las cuatro extremidades y adems siempre ests en constante cambio de estrategias ofensivamente y defensivamente, adems de que al ser un deporte de contacto, se requiere de mucha fuerza fsica no dejando de lado el aspecto tcnico o de estrategia que necesitas para derrotar a tu rival; todo esto aunado a que siempre la chispa de la improvisacin y de la genialidad estarn siempre presentes. Otro deporte que es muy completo es la natacin pero a diferencia del basketball, no existe contacto fsico y todo depende de t, ganes o pierdas el crdito siempre ser slamente tuyo. Si te refieres al mejor o ms practicado, sin duda es el futbol o soccer, ya que en cualquier parte del mundo se juega, teniendo o no las instalaciones adecuadas, lo puedes jugar en el parque o en la escuela o en la calle (no recomedable) e incluso en tu propia casa, no s qu tan completo sea pero s creo que la natacin y el basketball son ms completos. Ahora que si de eliminar caloras se trata, hacer el amor o practicar sexo como le quieras llamar, es la actividad que involucra ms msculos al realizarla adems que el hacerlo, quemas una gran cantidad de caloras, aunado a esto es tambin un excelente desestresante y te ayuda a curarte de una gripa o de una migra?a.|`|b120cbe44d9be2634ebbcb2e4baae17eaa	EL FUTBOL..........

Keep the pads in the pants when you wash.    They should dry thoroughly overnight, especially if a small fan is aimed in their direction to increase the evaporation rate.  If time does not allow for air drying, do not use any heat setting higher than "low" or the hip pads may melt and fold over, a condition that cannot be corrected.    Shoulder pads can be washed in your machine too. Don't use bleach, just soap. Dry in dryer if you can stand the noise. An alternative is to use a product such as Febreeze to keep the pads clean smelling. Encourage your player to shower after games and practice as well.    Hope this helps you.........

Recebeu o ttulo de Atleta do Sculo de todos os esportes em 15 de maio de 1981, eleito pelo jornal francs L'Equipe. No final de 1999, o COI, atravs de uma vota??o internacional entre todos os Comits Olmpicos Nacionais associados, tambm elegeu Pel o Atleta do Sculo.

O nome "Edson" foi escolhido pelo pai para fazer uma homenagem ao o inventor Thomas Edison.    Ainda crian?a manifestou a vontade de ser jogador de futebol. Ironicamente a alcunha "Pel" que serviu para identificar o jogador considerado o maior goleador de todos os tempos teve origem num goleiro. Em 1943 o pai de Pel jogava no time mineiro do S?o Louren?o. Pel, que ent?o tinha trs anos, ficava bastante impressionado com as defesas do goleiro da equipe do pai e gritava: "Defende Bil". As pessoas prximas come?aram a cham-lo de "Bil". Muitas crian?as colegas do garoto Edson tinham dificuldade em pronunciar "Bil" e com o tempo o apelido virou "Pel".       O presidente brasileiro Lula, sua mulher Marisa e Pel.Com dez anos j jogava em um time infanto-juvenil, o Canto do Rio, cuja idade mnima para participar era de 13 anos. O pai ent?o o estimulou a montar o seu prprio time: chamou-o Sete de Setembro. Para adquirir material, como bolas e uniformes, os garotos do time chegaram a pegar, sem autoriza??o, produtos nos vag?es estacionados da Estrada de Ferro Sorocabana para vender em entrada de cinema e pra?as.    Quem poderia imaginar, ent?o, que o sonho do Bar?o Pierre de Coubertin ao fazer renascer os Jogos Olmpicos no Sculo XX realizar-se-ia em Pel? Era costume na Grcia Antiga a decreta??o de um armistcio quando da realiza??o dos jogos. Tal fato s teve lugar novamente na Idade Contemporanea, em 1969. No transcorrer da guerra civil na frica, para que Pel e o time do Santos FC transitassem em seguran?a entre Kinshasa e Brazzaville, as for?as rivais declararam a interrup??o das agressividades, chegando a ocorrer, numa regi?o de fronteira, a transferncia da delega??o sob tutela de um exrcito para o outro.    Pel come?ou sua carreira no Santos FC, em 1956 e disputou sua primeira partida internacional com a sele??o brasileira dez meses depois.    Professor de Educa??o Fsica, formado em 1974, pela Faculdade de Educa??o Fsica de Santos (Universidade Metropolitana de Santos)    Na dcada de 1980, namorou a ent?o aspirante a modelo Xuxa, sendo considerado o principal responsvel pela proje??o inicial da mesma na midia. Periodo o mesmo em que foram lan?adas filmagens de Xuxa em um filme pornogrfico, posteriormente os mesmos foram retirados do mercado pelo prprio Pel. Onde afiram ter encontrado tais filmagens at em Nova York.    Foi ministro dos Esportes do Brasil de 1995 a 1998.    Em 2000, na conturbada elei?ao de Melhor Jogador do Sculo da FIFA, Pel foi aclamado como o melhor de todos os tempos, a frente do craque argentino Diego Maradona.    Em 3 de mar?o de 2004, revelou uma lista contendo os 100 melhores jogadores de futebol vivos. Lista esta que gerou polmica, e crticas de vrios seguimentos da mdia, de jogadores, e intelectuais do futebol mundial.    Em maio de 2005, Pel ganhou espa?o no noticirio por conta da pris?o de seu filho Edson Cholbi Nascimento, o Edinho, autuado sob suspeita de envolvimento com o trfico de drogas.

Durante o regime militar, deu declara??o polmica dizendo que "o povo brasileiro n?o sabe votar", o que provocou a rea??o de polticos na poca.   Em 2005 falou que Romrio deveria se aposentar, ao que o mesmo replicou que Pel "com a boca fechada  um poeta", completando que ele deveria "colocar um sapato na boca para deixar de falar besteiras".

Lamento comunicarles, que para ejemplo estn los padres, no los deportistas, no los artistas, no los famosos, si no la FAMILIA.

Despus de saber lo que Diego A. Maradona hizo como futbolista, recin ah podemos opinar.    Para m Diego fue un Gran Futbolista, un hombre que dej todo en la cancha, que en cada jugada puso sentimiento y pasin, una persona que evidentemente naci con un don y ms all de cuadros de fbtol, camisetas y nacionalidades, supo hacer feliz a muchas personas con sus goles, con sus jugadas maestras, con su paso por el ftbol.    Diego es sinnimo de ftbol, sentimiento, pasin... y como toda persona con talento y con cierto grado de fama, despierta odios y amores. Pero repito no se lo debe juzgar por su vida "PRIVADA" si no por su talento como futbolista.    **El OrGuLLo De SeR ArGeNtInA Y XeNeIzE No EnTrA En El PeChO**|`|51dc01da739d98cbe57d2b465092bc27aa	poque la gente se vuelven loca por marradona|`|a9b19ead90f73c4763d6b8d284120aa9aa	Es evidente quevos tenes un coeficiente intelectual de "0", de lo contrario no se puede creer todo lo que decis.-   Antes que nada voy a decir que soy uruguayo y que me imagino que vos sos mexicano,en ese caso nosotros indirectamente estamos relacionados en un hecho historico que perjudico a Maradona, el arbitro de la final del mundial del 90 era uruguayo, nacionalizado mexicano, te acordas no!!! A lo mejor vos desearias que se idolatre a ese individuo.   Discrepo con los que dicen que Maradona es simplemente un idolo deportivo, yo creo que es mucho mas que eso, es una persona que dice lo que piensa aunque eso le traiga problemas.   Sobre la idolatra que existe en la Argentina respecto a Maradona, su ex-compa?ero Jorge Valdano declar en junio de 2006 al diario alemn Sddeutsche Zeitung que "en el momento que Maradona se retir del ftbol activo, dej traumatizada a Argentina. Maradona fue ms que un futbolista genial. Fue un factor extraordinario de compensacin para un pas que en pocos a?os vivi varias dictaduras militares y frustraciones sociales de todo tipo". Valdano a?adi que Maradona ofreci a los argentinos "una salida a su frustracin colectiva y por eso la gente lo adora all como una figura divina". El socilogo Eliseo Vern coincide al expresar que Maradona refleja "las creencias y las necesidades colectivas, de los despojados, de los pobres, de los que necesitan creer que Dios est cerca y por eso se identifican con Diego, En noviembre de 2005 Maradona fue una de las figuras principales de la Cumbre de los Pueblos, tambin llamada contracumbre, en oposicin a la IV Cumbre de las Amricas. Su participacin comenz el 3 de ese mes, cuando abord el Expreso del Alba, un tren que parta desde Buenos Aires y transportaba 160 pasajeros que participaran de la contracumbre, entre los que se encontraban el entonces candidato a la presidencia de Bolivia Evo Morales. La Cumbre de los Pueblos, en donde se manifest la oposicin al ALCA y el repudio a George W. Bush, cont con la presencia del propio Maradona, el presidente venezolano Hugo Chvez, Silvio Rodrguez, Adolfo Prez Esquivel y las Madres de Plaza de Mayo. Su participacin gener el enojo de varios dirigentes polticos, entre los que se encontraba el presidente mexicano Vicente Fox.   Al iniciar su primer tratamiento de rehabilitacin en Cuba, entabl una amistad con el lder cubano Fidel Castro, a quien ha apoyado pblicamente. Tambin ha expresado admiracin por el argentino Ernesto Guevara, de quien dijo en su biografa, refirindose tambin a Jorge Rafael Videla: "Tipos como Videla hacen que el nombre de la Argentina est sucio afuera; en cambio, el del Che nos tendra que hacer sentir orgullosos".   Este es el Maradona que la gente admira, aparte del futbolista.-   Es publico y  notorio que sos un pobre resentido, un don nadie que pasa por la vida porque respirar es gratis.-   Por ultimo y ya me olvidaba, solo una vez la FIFA hizo una encuesta en su pagina web fue en el a?o 2000, y todo estaba preparado para el homenaje a Pele, ya que sedescontaba iba a ser el mas votado, sin embargo no fue asi, elmas votado a nivel mundial como el mejopr jugador de todos los tiempos fue Maradona con el 53% de los votos, y en segundo lugar fue elegido Pele con el 18% de los votos.-|`|f8c7dcd195c7748e1062333d8a2ca464aa	100% de acuerdo|`|6aece17f59b252f4479e1e9ac3f41b46aa	Que Maradona es contradictorio, por no decir veleta, verdad. Que es un adicto en recuperacion, tambien. crees que por estos rasgos se lo admira? yo no lo creo.  seguramente no sabe que, por ejemplo Freud escribio una apologia de la cocaina, y consumia y recomendaba, luego al conocer sus efectos nocivos, se retracto. Desde tu intolerancia hacia los errores (te deberas considerar un ser humano perfecto) entonces desacreditemos toda su genial obra.   Sabes por que maradona es tan reconocido en el mundo? simplemente porque fue uno de los artistas mas importantes del siglo XX.  Y en la argentina es idolatrado, creo porque representa, para bien y para mal, al pueblo. Hay algo profundamente representativo del argentino en el. Eso no habla muy bien de nosotros los argentinos, pero miremonos cada uno nuestras miserias y no cruxifiquemos a el chivo expiatorio, que carga con nuestras falencias. eso seria cobarde. es lo que haces vos. saludos.|`|c40f0f83394972d1728fe4eb26d94092aa	Eso mismo digo yo !!!!    Porque si es tan comunista, porq no se va a vivir a cuba???, lo que creo es q igual q chavez es un resentido y un antisocial !!!|`|0413f594b395cf131c160df4f0e53120aa	opino lo mismo que tu.....  en fin...  BESITOS!!!|`|669726068237c48f1015effd60f45378aa	mira, soy argentina pero opino igual que vos. no puedo creer como lo idolatran, lo toman como ejemplo a seguir... sobre todo para los chicos, me parece un pesimo ejemplo, cuyo unico merito fue patear una pelota. ?????ese es motivo suficiente para una ovasion de semejantes dimensiones...!!??|`|ba158a735c2df8a00ed4bd89e49348d7aa	si, lo tomamos como ejemplo d futbol a nivel mundial, no solo los argentinos, TODO EL MUNDO LO TIENEN COMO EMBLEMAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    y q onda si suspendes con el tekila?????|`|10562c3dfed481fb3afc1ffb5af5f7d7aa	bueno respeto tu opinion pero no sabes el alacran que te acabas de echar al calzon!! jeje te van a llover insultos de argentina..bueno espero no sea asi, aunque sabes una cosa.. YO ESTOY DE ACUERDO.. en fin sorry no es nada contra los Argentinos!  salu2|`|91a3c1f3702cff016b275c9b21bb9315aa	Soy argentina y no me gusta Maradona. Piesno lo mismo que vos|`|2d46d0349aa53d2956802131297aa04baa	Y ah vamos otra vez...............|`|4e941fcad87d9008452a8d78309b67f7aa	Y yo te pregunto: de que pas sos vos??? envidioso!    A maradona se lo admira futbolsticamente, nadie lo felicito por drogarse, ni mucho menos es un ejemplo de vida a seguir, asi que callate!|`|30e19a5be88f94bb88fb314680dd264aaa	Creo personalmente que no es tu problema que los Argentinos admiremos a MARADONA, el opina de lo que quiere y cuando quiere, porque los periodistas lo idealizan o lo fusilan a gusto y gana. Entonces vende. Pero te voy a decir que el de su vida privada puede hacer lo que quiera pero con su gambeta nos hace delirar, asi que Gracias Dios por ser Argentino, igual que diego y yo

I thought this season was extremely boring compared to the last two seasons , but I don't have NFL network so I was stuck with the games I was stuck with and that was a huge factor in my bordom.  The MNF 49ers vs. Cards game was entertaining and I loved the Giants stomping the Cowboys first week in November
fEWhwumZaa	http://i115.photobucket.com/albums/n320/...    Bad quality but here you go anyway :)|`|pXeQFtgIaa	Chelsea should have won they are the best. And lampards sending off is ridiculous. Bosingua did a worse foul and got nothing|`|duJgBxUoaa	I'll get back to you on this one :)

gU4VdD6Oaa	Starks played well once he got in there. I'd lock him up.    I'd see how Marvel is in training camp. I wouldn't mind seeing Willie Colon go bye-bye. I don't think he screwed up yesterday but, damn, I got sick of his holding, false starts and neutral zone penalties all year.|`|UxooffHZaa	I don't think the coaching staff likes Starks... But he is a decent player. He proves over and over he's not the weak spot in that line. (Hardings/Kimoiatu are) Either way, they need to draft an O-Lineman in the 1st.
2fGHF3RQaa	Cm'on now Scooter we know you didn't watch the game because you were taking a long power nap.    Anyway the commercials are so important because they pay millions of dollars having them air during the game.  This is a good indication to invest in their company.  Like I really like Doritos's stock right now.|`|dqxW1W0eaa	Well , since bout 30 years ago in my opinion........|`|21RH8bo8aa	Since it became the most watched televised event in america.|`|1b037047daa5a242ff98379ffe8e03e1aa	This may be difficult for you to hear, I hope you're sitting down:    Football is not important to some people.|`|fefYXm71aa	that candyazz show Mike & Mike spent 2hrs arguing and debating what commercial was best|`|fHxpycJSaa	About 30 years ago. I have watched every Super Bowl, and I hate what it's become. Concerts before the game and at halftime. ESPN starting their pregame garbage at 6:00 AM. It's a joke.|`|AA10554783	When it cost 30 million for 30 seconds.|`|6msce8FZaa	Someone has to pay the bills for the sports diva's.|`|gU4VdD6Oaa	It started in 1984, when Apple ran it's "Big Brother" ad for the first Macintosh. The ad caused a lot more excitement than the game and Mac sales skyrocketed.     Super Bowl ads have never been the same, since.|`|MwiBGBK1aa	LOL I'm pretty sure the commercials have been important for years :P    i.e: for those who aren't interested in the game :)|`|exB1zxgVaa	Ever since the advertising agencies became clever enough to amuse people during a football game... I really dont know an exact date|`|6tGYe5roaa	Yea the people that only care about the commercials annoy me. The people who are reading a magazine during the game and then suddenly put it down when the commercials come on. That irritates me. However, the commercials have become a part of the tradition of the Super Bowl. I always like to check out the commercials during the game because you expect them to be extra funny or original. (Note to advertisers: You usually fail miserably and you definitely did this year.)|`|gYRfWcleaa	I always watch super bowl because I love to watch football.   I do also enjoy the commercials because they are usually more creative than most you see any other time. This year the commercials were not that good.|`|7B9KEqCnaa	what does it really matter.  its not like the commercials take anything away from the game.  You watch for the game, other watch it for the commercial. Other watch its for the media extravaganza it is.  Others watch for the halftime show, others like to just go to superbowl parties and just eat and eat and eat.  whatever the reason just enjoy it for what ever you enjoy it for and Have fun.|`|1ViGcF3xaa	I don't even watch the commercials during the game.  When the commercials come on I usually read.|`|1uSoU8Lpaa	For myself I can say the game was much more fun, entertaining and exciting than a commercial pushing their products on me. I usually get up and quickly get something done during the commercials, which is what I did last night. Plus, whatever commercials were aired last night will be on TV for a year now. Not to worry to commercial lovers everywhere.
q8mbICQ8aa	They are all Cocky. They think that they are the best just because they won a superbowl, and are now in "the books". Yeh, 6 superbowl wins, most franchise team to have that many, so what? Why brag about it and call us [Cardinal Fans] whiners. I do believe you are all being sore- winners.|`|CqR6daqnaa	I'm not a Cardinal fan either, and I'm not so sure they would have won anyway, but I do think it's obvious who the refs were favoring.|`|E1sqGzmtaa	We are not sore winners. We are proud of our team. We made history last night and everyone else is just jealous.|`|mFYCmSlkaa	ITS AS SIMPLE AS THIS: YOUR ALL JEALOUS.|`|xvuAQ0DAaa	Bad losers and classless winners, it's the American way...|`|YAiKlPkMaa	I think it is basic human nature. Reverse the end of the story and I bet you would be seeing the same behavior from the Cardinal fans. I hate seeing anyone lose, the sadness and disappointment, but both teams can't win.|`|AA12103453	Why do you mention questionable calls and not say which ones? I can admit to some being questionable and I'm a Steelers fan. I call Cardinals BACKERS(not fans just some people who were "cheering" for them) whiners because they claim everything that went against them was questionable. They claim the game was fixed, which is whining to me. I admit the roughing the passer on Ben was a questionable call. Yeah on replay I thought what was that idiot thinking, then they showed game speed and saw he hit Ben like just after the ball came out and could see where he messed up. I admit there were some bad calls, but they were reviewed and overturned. Refs just saw it wrong.Yet because the field view got it wrong oh the refs were paid. I don't call all the people who wanted the Cards to win whiners, some are admitting it was a good game. I call the ones who insist the refs were paid off a bunch of whiners. I think the Cards played a great game and people that insist the refs were paid are dragging down the real fan's name. To be fair some Steelers backers(maybe fans) are dragging down our fan's names as well.    How should that have not been a TD before the half? His knee never touched the turf and his shoulder came down IN THE ENDZONE, so the things that qualify as being down didn't put him down before the endzone and the ball broke the line.|`|UxooffHZaa	Wwaaaah waaah... The winners beat us, and we didn't win, because we're losers. It doesn't matter who you're a fan of. You're a loser, and upset by the winners. But, Winners win. The Universe doesn't change.|`|jwm0kQvNaa	It comes with thinking they deserve everything that comes their way.  Look at Hines Ward- he talks big when he's the one hitting.  He does a good job acting like a professional in front of the camera, but when he gets popped or drops a pass he starts waving his hands and pouting like a p*ssy, looking for a flag.  Some WR you expect this from, but Ward is only a professional when it favors him.  Being a team leader, everyone follows his lead.  Pretty sad, really.|`|MaizmvvMaa	Because a lot of the so called steelers fans are front runners, at this point i mean. Front runners are the most trash talking, stupidest group out there. That's why they are frontrunners so they can say their team is the best and brag about it. I think most of the calls were good maybe other than the personal foul roughing the passer. But the final play was a fumble, last night at about 3 in the morning the replay official said yes it was a fumble and yes it was reviewed so cards fans get over it. Im not a fan of either team but the better team won.|`|sMssDP1Xaa	I'm not a sore winner, just happy that my team made history.|`|vwTu8fY7aa	There were may questionable calls like a fumble. A touchdown which should not have been a touchdown at the end of second half.    Winners I dont think so. More like payers people that pay the Refs.|`|ajnGHNr8aa	Um, this may be why most people don't like Steeler fans. Anyone watch the World Series? People from PA. don't know how to behave when they win or lose. For some reason they think their team is the best because they won the Super Bowl. They are not the best team in the league but they won the game that matters the most. They were lucky a more balanced team was not on the field (Eagles, Panthers) or they would have lost. I didn't care who won the game but I do hate when the "fans" of the winning team rub in the face of the others teams fans and call them whiners when they ask questions about calls and such. The game should not be decided by the officials but most of them are because of a bad call or a missed call. The Steelers one, give them their do, but the best team they are not.|`|frDcAqyWaa	I'm not a Cardinal fan, but I hate Steelers fans becuase they are way too hype about their team, its just a football team and its just a football game, its not like they play baseball.|`|Zwpagpubaa	That isn't true.  We just love our Steelers.  They make us proud to be part of the "Steelers Nation".|`|70aa0db8082ddead46f656ecb978193aaa	Let me preface this by saying I'm neither a Steelers nor a Cardinals fan.     Why wasn't the last Cardinal's offensive play reviewed?  It looked to me that even though Warner's arm was hit while it was poised back, he still maintained control of the ball and continued forward motion while maintaining control leading to, what I felt should have been, an incomplete pass with 5 seconds left on the clock.  Even if it wasn't, I thought it was close enough to warrant a review.    Any one else feel that way?|`|6Ojpl6viaa	Your right, change a few calls.  Like the 3 personal fouls, what happen with that one??  We kicked a field goal.  Cards ran into the holder, we get 4 more tries, what happens we still kick a field goal.  The end of the game was a fumble.  If you think different, read the rules, then watch it again.  He didn't have total control of the ball before his arm started to move forward.  The Steelers had TWO HUGE calls go against them.  Bad calls were made, but they could have called a ton more on the Cards.  Favoring refs dont call holding in the end zone...
jesj5fHxaa	First off, I don't care for any of the teams, but I totally agree with you. The cards would have won if not for the refs. Too many bad calls: roughing the passer, running into the holder, pass interference, that final play, the list goes on....    I can honestly say that was the worst officiating job (from either teams standpoint) that I have ever seen in the NFL.    But the Steelers D is still the Steelers D, very good. Yet the Cards offense put up a very good fight.|`|lHDff8Braa	There was really only 1 bugus call; the "roughing the passer" on Dansby.  Other than that, the Cards killed themselves.  They are a 9-7 team for a reason; they're just not that good.    But you are right...the Steelers defense is over-rated.  They are rated OVER every other team in the NFL.   1 Defense, all year long!|`|WtcTBlccaa	fosho holmes did a lebron with the ball no flag what|`|b64219f408e63daa3f8c2cba4d84a232aa	I have to agree with tony up above me.  Im disagreeing with you.    The Cardnals did so many penalties and the reffs just let it go.  They never even noticed but a lot of fans did.  Im sorry but im glad the Steelers won.  They played fair|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	I watch the ending of the game  As I was watching the ball roll pass to cardinals, and they stood and watch the ball roll pass them.  Then a steeler player came from behind and jump on the ball    I do not know mush about football, but I do know, if you team have a ball, and it rolls pass you, you jump on it    They could of kept the ball for another play  They could of got lucky    You can say that the steelers defense is over rated  Any boy who plays mighty football knows that you jump on a loose ball    Why did not the two cardinals player know that?|`|8aa98ddf90b585cbbccc7bd34c260043aa	Steelers defense is far from over rated.  Did you forget the Cardinals were shut down until Pittsburgh started playing off the ball, and Fitzgerald was able to get lose?    Questionable calls aside, the Steelers dominated that game for 3 quarters.|`|bCmqScVlaa	Steeler won. You didn't.  The so called over rated defense beat your team.  No bogus penalties, just sore losers.|`|VBHOiIBlaa	Which calls were questionable that gave the Steelers points?|`|l3y23yVcaa	I'm sorry, but I have to disagree...     The Cardinals were cheated, sure to this point I will agree with you...    But it was the Cardinals Defense with 2:37 to go that cheated the Cardinals... certainly not the Refs. I would have liked to see them win as well, but when they needed a stop they couldn't get one.|`|No7cWEKIaa	For sure the last play should have at least been reviewed, looked like Warner's arm was going forward for sure. The foul on the holder during the kick was a complete joke. If that call wouldn't have been made the game would have been a lot different.     WHat do you expect though, the refs have been horrible all year, why stop at the super bowl.    The Steelers did deserve the win though, thats just the way the cookie crumbles. In my opinion it can never be the refs fault, but they sure helped in this one.|`|cTo3kSIwaa	Maybe the Cardinals just commit more penalties you idiots. They put the whistle in the refs mouth. And you cannot run into the holder, its a penalty every time. Though it probably should have been reviewed, the last play would have never been overturned. the ball was hit before the arm moves forward, its a fumble everytime
YAiKlPkMaa	Me. There were only a couple that really stood out to me. Most were pretty lackluster and some were downright stupid.|`|6msce8FZaa	I didn't really care. Are we that concerned about commercials and what companies expect us to buy?|`|69bp1IMfaa	Funny, they had more commercials than usual this year, probably because of the economy.|`|AElFESKVaa	I think its pretty cool that we can get a free Denny's breakfast.  Looking forward to that!|`|wvPDo4gXaa	yeah i thought the same thing... i figured because of the economy Business didn't want to spurge on out of the ordinary commercials|`|Lngb8ryFaa	the only one i liked was the "Career builder"... it went something like "you hate your job, no one respects you, you sit next to this guy" and repeated over and over....all the rest seemed like ordinary everyday tv commercials..      ...oh yea, i defintely will hit up the free breakfast at dennys on tuesday, if i could wake up that early!!!|`|w5sK75MPaa	The Doritos was hilarious!|`|RiPXOiFAaa	yeah...while i did laugh at the dog adoption, and the play on "grease monkeys"  was clever...yeah i wasn't too impressed with them...but a better question is : they paid HOW much to run mediocre commercials?|`|gYRfWcleaa	I thought last years commercials were better. The Budweiser ones are usually good but this year they were not!     I|`|6fGv1TS0aa	I was very disappointed. There were better Superbowl Commercials 10 years ago. A few years ago, there was the Budweiser Clydesdale commercial where they did the theme from "Rocky" and the Clydesdale went thru training with the help of a Dalmation Dog.  It was cute.  I also like the Old Verizon Commercial, there the IT People were dancing off of one of Salt and Pepper's Songs.
vXFpzKRaaa	Carolina is a solid team no doubt but with some players, they may just need a change of scenery which could help them get their passion back.  Look at Randy Moss, it took several team changes before he found a role on a team that he's not complaining about.  But you're right too...  sometimes, your wallet will speak to you the most.  But then again, no amount of money can by you a Super Bowl ring not to mention the right to tell your grandkids you played in one of the greatest games ever...  the Super Bowl.|`|VNpZPjZ3aa	let him go to the bears you'll get even there cuz the Bears are losers!|`|39ixfEIraa	Well im a rams fan, so i would like to see him there, he would be oppisite chris long, in with releif by leonard little. The rams also have great pass rushing defensive tackles, if this d-line cant get the potential out of him, than no team can. Not to mention we blits 90% of the time|`|7B9KEqCnaa	He wants to go to a 3-4 defense.  So he can play as a Outside rushing linebacker, which may be his more natural position. It will also probably pump up his stats.
CkRaNP30aa	I thought it was a forward pass during the live play.

Warner lost control of the ball while his arm was still going BACKWARDS as I linked in the picture. Hence it is a fumble as he did not have control of the ball, and was ruled a fumble when he pushed it forward.|`|t81MEJ82aa	No the incomplete pass wouldn't have been the end of the game. If he was obviously throwing to the lineman it would've been but he was getting hit as he threw the ball.

AA11108627	Below is an answer I gave to someone else who had exactly the same question.  It helped her; I hope it helps you too:    ***  Best Answer - Chosen by Asker  First, being a girl has nothing to do with your understanding of football. Any woman can understand the game as much as a man. Don't sell yourself short.    Now, about football...    It is played on a field of 120 yards. The playing field is 100 yards, and there are two 10-yard areas on the left & right ends of the field. These areas are called the end zones. The goal of each team is to move the football into your end zone, and prevent the opposing team from moving the football into their end zone.    Behind each end zone is a metal bar called a goal post. It forms two columns that rise high into the air, called goal posts. They are connected at the bottom by a level bar called the crossbar. The goal post is located such that the crossbar is lined up evenly with the back of the end zone.    Like most sports, the object is to score more points than the other team. Here is how you can score:    *TOUCHDOWN - if you successfully move the ball into your end zone, this is something to celebrate! Your team scores 6 points for doing this.    After a team scores a touchdown, there are two ways they can add some bonus points to their score:  1). An "extra-point". As the name implies, this is worth one point. A player called the kicker attempts to kick the ball in between the uprights from a short distance away. This is usually what teams do, and it is almost always successful.  2). A "two-point conversion" is attempted in some instances. The ball is placed about 2 yards away from the end zone, and the team has one chance to score another "touchdown". However, if successful, they only score 2 points instead of 6. Since this is more difficult, teams usually don't try this unless they have a compelling reason to do so.    *FIELD GOAL - Sometimes a team trying for a touchdown comes close, but doesn't quite reach the end zone. In these instances, teams attempt to score by having their kicker kick the football through the goal posts. It's like an extra point, only from further away. If successful, your team scores 3 points!    *SAFETY - on rare occasions, a team goes backwards so far that they end up being tackled in the OTHER team's end zone! This is called a safety and scores 2 points for the other team. This hardly ever happens, but it is another possible way to score.    Now, what happens when you are trying to score a touchdown? When your team has the ball, you are given 4 chances to make a total of 10 yards. If you don't, the other team automatically gets the ball (and you usually want to avoid that at all costs).     To keep track of which number chance (or play) you are currently on, a DOWN is assigned to each play. For example, your first try is called "first down", the second try is "second down", the third is "third down", and so on. If you successfully gain 10 yards or more, you are given a new "set of downs", and you return once again to "first down".    Let's suppose it's the first play, and you need to move 10 yards. You only gain 2. The announcer will then announce "2nd and 8", an abbreviated way of saying this is your team's 2nd chance, and 8 additional yards are needed to make a "first down". If the next play gains 5 yards, the announcer will say "3rd and 3". Make sense? Then, if the team gains 7 yards, it returns to "1st and 10".    Let's suppose it is 4th down. Almost always, a team will not gamble to make the necessary yardage if it is 4th down, and instead choose to voluntarily give the ball to the other team. However, the advantage is, under these circumstances, is that your team can now kick the ball as far as he can downfield first. This makes it more challenging for the other team to score a touchdown, because they now have much further to go.    (I saved this early b/c I didn't want to lose it)!  There are 2 types of plays your team uses to move the ball. The first is a run, where a player simply runs as far as he can either before he is: (a) tackled by an opponent, or (b) runs off the side of the field.    The second is a pass. A player on your team (usually the quarterback) throws the ball to a teammate, who must catch it before it hits the ground. Some passes are short, others are long, but if the ball hits the ground, the play immediately stops, and you gain zero yards for your effort.    Both plays have risks. If a player runs with the ball, and drops it, it is called a FUMBLE. If the other team picks up the ball after your player fumbles, they automatically take posession of the ball. If you throw the ball, and someone on the opposing team catches it instead of your guy, it is an INTERCEPTION, and again, the other team takes the ball.    What separates football from other sports is that your team is a group of smaller teams, and players are specialists, trained to do only certain skills well. Each team consists of: (a) an offensive team|`|wxXguyK3aa	You can the some rules at nfl.com  There's a lot and I don't want to type them all.|`|GrQPKutOaa	you get 6 points for every touchdown and an extra point if u make the field goal  touchdown is when you get the ball all the way down to the endzone aka the big color rectangle with the teams name on it and a big yellow pole in the shape of a y behind it  fieldgoal is when you kick the ball into the big yellow y  you get 3 tries to move the ball 10 yards on your turn  if you make it its called a first down  get enough of those and you get close enough to the endzone and youll end up getting a touchdown  now to move the ball theres basically 2 ways of doing it - passing and running  passing is when the quarterback(kinda like the leader of the team) throws the ball to someone down the field  running is when someone takes the ball and well runs it down as far as they can before they get tackeled   tackeled is when someone from the other team brings you to the ground  now if you have the ball and you drop it its called a fummble and whatever team picks it up gets it  the ground cannot cause the fummble as in if you fall on the ground and the ball gets lose it doesnt count  now if you throw the ball and someone from the othr team catches it tis called an interception  oh and if you just made a touchdown you can kick a fieldgoal or go for a twopoint conversion where you have to run the ball into the endzone again and you get two points instead of one  and you can also get two points if you back the other team into their endzone adn sack the quarterback  you sack the quarterback when you tackle him before he throws the ball    the superbowl was lastnight, feb. 1st  its where the two well i wouldnt say best teams of the season play to see who kinda gets champion  this year it was the pittsburg steelers vs the arizona cardinals and the steelers won    thats your basic football  really its more complicated than that but thats kinda a short overview  i have two brothers and a dad and we play madden(football videogame) all the time so yea thats where i learned it from!!!  hope this helps|`|AA11979883	six point for a touch down 3 points for a field goal 1 point for Extra point  2 point for a safety just remember if some touch safety etc that the points way of scoring in football college or pro|`|YkseyT7zaa	Football is over now.
