20090131202335AAXlxMr	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	My 2nd book is in the works but I need feedback!?	I am Richard Paul Denney,  I need help on the title of my 2nd book. here is a piece of it it has not been edited it is in rough draft state still. no harsh comments I'm simply asking for some help on a title NOT your opinion on the story. no one will change my work or ideas.      ** there are many misspellings and grammer mess ups   so no need to be like "hey you suck!" :).      _______________________      The young girl ran as fast as her feet could take her, until she came to a hault in front of a dark house, she tried to catch her breath but she knew the creature would catch her if she was in plain sight so she slowly went up the porch steps. The door was cracked open, enough to view the inside but it was too dark to make out what lied beyond the front door, It was a two story house that looked older than the trees that surrounded it, footsteps broke the girls consentration as she peeled open the door and crept inside, the footsteps were coming up the porch steps cracking the wood from under she tried holding her breath as the door slowly swung open, she was plastered against the wall behind it She never felt more scared for her life.   She held it tight in her hands against her chest as the creature crept further inside the house making it's way up the staircase that was a few feet away from the front door, she decided to make a run for it, the creature was halfway up the stairs when she slid out the front door and crept as slow and softly as she could down the steps of the porch, as she was about to take her foot off the second to the last step, she heard a snap of wood and began running, she was closer to her house this time as the back patio light came into view she thought of nothing as she ran into her house which was empty, no one must have been home. She ran to the end of the hall and slammed the door to her bedroom but before she could turn around she felt an ice cold sensation fill her lungs as she collapsed to the floor and the object she held so tightly rolled out of her hand and into the furnace.         -   -   -      The house stood in the middle of two very large houses on this street called Caribou.   The Anker family was all too excited to think of how errie and old this home was, It belonged to Mrs. Anker's Grandmother Anita and was given to them by will. The only son Nemo was 11 and was fond of old houses and spooky looking places, the library was his best friend, Nemo had short blond hair and green eyes. The house was accross the street from a Cemetary and Nemo was told about seven times, never to cross that street but that just made him want to step down from the curb as much as ever. "So this is our new home, isn't it lovely?" asked Mrs. Anker rolling a scrunchie off her wrist and tying her brown hair in a pony tail, "Yes it is, but it still needs plenty of work old houses like this are good at falling apart when you least expect it." said Mr. Anker, Nemo stood wondering why the house wasn't a two story like the other two, but he didn't care he just wanted to have a ball rumaging through old things but when his Father elbowed the front door open, the house was as empty as the street. "is this it?" asked Nemo staring at his Mother as she set her purse on an old chair and proceeded through the archway into the kitchen "Yup isn't pleasant, Grandmother has everythng else auctioned off three years ago before she passed, theres nothing left but a few chairs, a kitchen table, a shed and a bucket of sea shells?" Mrs. Anker was stardled at her finding, a tin bucket with white sea shells piled to the tip top. "I wonder where this came from?" asked Mrs, Anker, "Maybe your Grandmother liked the sea a little too much" giggled Mr. Anker picking up the bucket from the kitchen floor and sitting it on the table, Mrs. Anker leaned and kissed Mr. Anker's bald head as they head out to the truck to start unpacking, Nemo looked up at the shandler, It was silver with octopuses and sea horses entwining around the glass cups which held the light bulbs. "Nemo honey, please take that bucket out to the backyard and watch out for the pool, it's empy you'll get hurt!" shouted Mrs. Anker from out side. Nemo grabbed the bucket, it was a little heavy but he could handle it. Nemo opened the back door to a dark and grassy backyard, but saw no pool, he flipped the switch near the door and the backyard lit up like spotlights were placed on every branch of the big oak tree that was plastered on the left side of the yard, there was a white rusted shed, an old patio and a fountain in the middle of the yard but no pool. "whats holding you up sport?" aked Mr. Anker almost scarying Nemo to death, he nearly dropped the bucket of shells. "Mom said there was a pool, I don't see one Dad." said Nemo placing the bucket on the patio floor, his fingers were purple "well she did say so, hmm but it needs to cleaned up like nobodys buisness" said Mr. Anker as he walked off the patio and into the yard passing the fountain "see all this grass over h

Like for example, the song The River Flows In You by Yiruma sounds like a good song to be Bella's Lullaby, I actually like it more than the one from the movie, and of course so does the one in the movie.      I only want songs that are played on the piano and slow and make you think of Bella and Edward...Please provide the song name and the writer/performer.      Thanxx...      P.S- Listen To The River Flows In You by Yiruma...its really beautiful...I love it <3 I think it's a better lullaby for Bella than the one in the movie.

20090131113706AAXkL6n	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Read my short story? Is it to dramatic or stupid?	Opinions welcomed      The wheels of the bus came to a squelching stop. I hopped off the bus as a bitter, howling wind bit at my skin. Nestling my chin into my coat, I sprinted up to my new high school. Instant warmth spread through my body as I entered the doors of Johnson High. It was apparent that I would not be adjusting to the harsh conditions of winter in New England so soon.            I made my way through the bustling hallways until I managed my way to my home room. It was a considerable feat, as the map of the school the secretary gave me seemed to be in a foreign language. My advisor was Ms. Finch, the civics teacher. Her name was apt based on appearance. The fiery red color of her hair reminded me of the pictures of foliage my parents showed me, trying to coax me into moving north. Her nose was prominent like a beak, and she had a slim but short stature. The class was chattering while Ms. Finch was typing away on her laptop. I had hardly had time to put my trumpet case down before the bell rang, when a hoard of the students trampled my path to get to their correct rooms before the announcements. I observed that the boys sat separate from the girls, like oil and water. Not wanting to disrupt the status quo so early, I settled into an empty chair among male teens. I pulled out a tattered book from my knapsack, trying to catch up with the Honors English class reading. While trying to focus on To Kill a Mocking Bird, the intercom switched on for announcements.                Static played through the room temporarily, until a bubbly and feminine voice spoke:     “Hello, and happy Monday, Newport High School. Please rise for the Pledge of Allegiance!”       At this moment, like always at my old school, I remind seated and continued reading my book. Everyone else rose and mumbled The Pledge grudgingly. Ms. Finch eyed me suspiciously, but said nothing until the end of announcements. Morning announcements were over when the speaker reminded us all to “learn seven new things today”. Ms. Finch approached me.   “Miles,” she seethed, “why did you not say The Pledge?”         “Well, I-” I tried to say, however embarrassing it was to display my belief in front of the whole class. I could hear some girls snickering.                 “Enough. You have a detention. Meet me after your classes.” She squawked. I did not have enough time to replay in protest, as the bell rang.                  It can not be a good omen if you get in trouble before first period at    your new school.          It’s a peculiar thing, how students react to a new kid. Through out my assiduous day, swooning girls wanted to know what the weather was like in Florida, and the guys inquired how hot the girls were. But as the clock continued to tick, it was finally the end of the day, at least for everyone but me. I shuffled my way back to Ms. Finch’s room. Ms. Finch did not even look up at mean. Taking out my book once more, I read. One minute down, 29 more to go.            While I read, it accord to me that this was a violation of my rights. The first amendment stated Freedom of Speech, so doesn’t that also mean Freedom from Speech? My blood boiled as I released how unjust this was and before I could stop myself I jumped out of my seat.                  “This is unfair!” I said, only after I said it did I realize how immature I sounded.      “Sit back down, Miles” Ms. Finch snapped. “If you refuse to vow your loyalty to your country, you must sit down”.         “No, ma’am. It’s against my right to be punished for my beliefs. You didn’t let me say earlier, but the reason I do not say the Pledge is because I believe it is a religious oath more than a vow to my country. And I do not believe in any higher being. After my little sister was attacked and killed by someone as old as my father, I have denounced any belief in a God. No moral lord would do that to my sister.” The words rushed out of me, and my body was shaking. I never before had challenged some one of authority. I ironically sat back down. I could feel my cheeks flush.               Ms. Finch adverted her eyes. She finally spoke, still not looking at me.           “Mr. Beret, I understand were you are coming from. My daughter and husband died in a drunk driver accident, and the incident brought me closer to God. It is the same thing for you, except it drew you away. I can reason why you do not want to say the pledge, buy at least show respect to your country by standing. I hope we can come to an agreement.” When she looked up at me, she was smiling. A genuine one, at that.                I weighed the opinions. I never disliked my country, and I never realized how my stance against The Pledge could be perceived as lack of patriotism, just as Ms. Finch never realized my silence was me upholding to my own religious beliefs. A consensus is each party giving a little to get a lot.                    “I would like that, Ma’am”. And I gave her a jubilant grin.

You'll realize what's changed is you. "    There is some book that has a quote similar to this one, and I can't think of it. It talks about coming home and everything is the same, and you're the only thing that's different.    I thought maybe it was The Catcher in the Rye, but I looked and couldn't find that either.

20090131121753AAJ0f71	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I started this short story what do you think?	honestly i have no idea where its going....do you think i should start over?       His blue eyes matched the sky, and his hair was messy but flawless in every way. And most importantly, he stared at me like I wasn't the girl I thought I was. He stared at me in a way that made me feel beautiful. I was such a 'little person'. I really didn't think anyone noticed me, expecially not him. But still, there he was asking me to hang out later tonight. His expression changed qucikly from adoring to worried, probably because it had been five minutes and I still didn't answer his question.    "Um, of course?" I said timidly turning my statement into a question.  It seemed that my lack of confindence worried him even more. But it wasn't my fault, Sophmore jocks didn't usualy talk to freshman bookworms, and unfortunatley i fit into that category. He smiled, breaking the puzzled look on his face and handed me a piece of paper that seemed to already been prepared earlier today. I shoved pieces my blonde bangs behind my ear to see what was written on the torn piece of paper more effectivly. His number was scribbled on the paper in violent scratch marks of pen. I looked up to smile at him.    "Where are we going?" I asked, regaining my confindence.    "It's a surprise." He stated in a semi-sweet voice. I looked up at the conopy of leaves above us to daydream about where he would take me for a moment. Then it hit me, he was a sophmore, and I was just a freshman. This could easily just be a rude joke on the newcomer. It was only first semester, the leaves were still a thriving green on the trees and I had yet to breath in that brisk autumn air. I was all of a sudden very nevous. I set my head right again to look at him.    "See you tonight then?" I asked. I needed time to think about this without him sitting right next to me.     "Yea, tonight" he said smiling big again. "Bye Analeigh" He said my name so perfectly, not like everyone else who always mispronounced it. Of course I could say it very easily just 'Ana' then 'Lee' but he could still say it even more perfectly then I could.    "Bye Noah." I smiled just enough for him to see my teeth. He stood up effortlessly, without hitting his head on one of the branches above like I usually would, and then gracefully walked away without looking back. I sighed heavily, I forgot I was still in the schoolyard. Everyone was already gone, on their buses, headed home for the long weekend. Originaly i had no plans, finish a book mabey, have pointless conversations online with my handful of friends. In a matter of seconds I was busy, and i didn't know exactly what I was going to be doing with this gorgeous sophmore named Noah Michaels. I still thought it was all a trick, for him to sweettalk me and then as we lean in for a kiss he would back away and start laughing directly in my face. But I promise myself I will not let that happen. I will not let anything happen, in the end i would just get crushed.     After my long walk home I walked in the door to find the scent of freshbaked cookies coming from down the hall. I inhaled the sweet scent as I absentmindedly walked toward

Like Homeless People upon the street .... they know not where they've been ....      There are many shapes & sizes .... different colors don't you know ....   The winds blow hard down from the North .... the chill it settles in ....   The Homeless People have lost all hope .... their faces never grin ....      They try to make another day by shuffling around .... they really are no more to you .... then leaves upon the ground ....      Different colors, different sizes, is that all you really see ....      Do you honestly not see that woman standing there before your very eyes .... with a little boy and a little girl just standing by her side ....      Their hearts are broken, their eyes so sad, their belly's never full ....      You can't imagine the awful pain of having no damn place to go ....      Yes Autumn leaves are beautiful .... of this there is no doubt ....      But what about the Homeless there who want to scream and shout ....      You tire of the leaves too quick, while raking them around .... But what about the Homeless there who sleep upon the ground ....      You've piled up the leaves so high .... the fires very bright ....      Despair it falls upon the Homeless now .... it's getting colder every night ....      For we are nothing but Autumn Leaves to you .... you simply do not care .... about the women & the children there  .... or that tired @ss old man ....

Everyone surrounded the broken body and murmered their guesses as to what may have made him jump. Women screamed and men shouted. Many of the people there stood in awe at the sight of the man on the sidewalk. Among all the rabble and chattering, the trees around the city sat with their leaves in silence. The wind had stopped blowing its mighty torrent and the buildings seemed to have gone dark. The sun sank beyond the horizon, drawing the drapes of night over the city. Within minutes, everything went dark...      Jasper sat up out of bed. He felt his heart thudding inside him. He felt cold sweat roll down his face. He looked around the dimly lit appartment. He was alone in bed. He wasn't lying dead on the concrete anymore...      "What...?" he began. Suddenly he recalled the events of that day. The old man Jasper met on the roof told him that his life would be restored at sunset of every day that he killed himself and he would be forced to live a life worse than the one he had. He looked around the room. Everything was normal. Nothing was worse than he thought. Had it been a dream? It seemed so real.      Jasper got out of bed and went to take a shower. After the shower he shaved. As he shaved, the razor cut open his chin. Blood came out of the wound, red smeared the white cream. Jasper looked at himself in the mirror.      You will live a life worse than the one you had before.      Jasper couldn't help but laugh. He gave a light chuckle and began rinsing his face. In a way, the dream was right. He cut himself, something he seldom ever did. He moved out of the bathroom and dressed himself. He went into the bathroom to hang his towel but this time he refused to look in the mirror. Jasper hated the way he looked. He had green-gray eyes and eyebrows that refused to ever be kempt. He had a round nose that, to him, seemed like a bubble waiting to pop. He had some minor acne around his chin and nose and he was develping wrinkles under his eyes.      Jasper left his house in a solemn mood. He left the apartment complex and suddenly saw that clouds had shrouded the sky. A storm? He sighed. He hated the rain. He didn't go back to get an umbrella. He didn't see the point in getting one. He pants always got wet anyway.      Jasper walked down the sidewalk with his hands in his pockets. He felt so alone in the mass of people that walked in the same direction as he did. He looked around at all the people in their fluffy rain coats and fancy pants and skirts. Everyone was smiling and chattering with each other. He was truly alone...      Jasper felt the wave of depression roll across his life again. He couldn't take it anymore. He was going to act out his dream. He would leap from the tallest skyscraper he could get into. He found on of decent size across the street. The light signalled for him to cross. Jasper trudged towards the building. Just then, a small Beamer shot around the corner and slid on the wet ground. Jasper had little time to react. He jumped to the side but the car clipped his thigh.      Jasper spiralled into the air, his left leg twisted into a position it should not have been. He landed squarly and crumple down in a heap. He leg burned with pain. He let out a scream of agony.      You will live a life worse than the one you had before.      Jaspers eyes shot open wide. Was it true? Was it a dream? Did it really happen? People on the sidewalks stopped to look but none came to his aid. No one came to his side. Jasper knew it was this way and felt depression wrap around him again. He began crying on the spot. Someone came up to him and asked if he was alright.      "GO AWAY!" Jasper barked, baring his teeth. He knew that the person only came because of pity, not because he cared about him... Jasper saw a cars zipping by the scene. Jasper stood on his good leg and timed the movements of the cars. Here came a semi-truck. Jasper leapt forth. He saw the car slam into him and then everything became silent, still... dark once more.      With a jolt, Jasper sat up in his bed. He was beaded with cold sweat. His heart was pounding in his chest. He looked around the room. He felt himself... This was impossible... Then he remembered.      You will life a life worse than the one you had before.

20090226083946AA0V4pl	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Is the Proposition, "All Perch are Fish" Analytic (Self-Evident)?	According to Leibnitz's criteria?      Background:      I have been arguing heatedly with a man who claims that all perch are NOT fish and that "All perch are fish" is not an analytic or self-evident statement regardless of the definitions of the words or the grammatical structure of the proposition. He wants to make the point that there can be multiple definitions of "perch," some including what birds land on.      What do you think? Is that possibly a form of equivocation and a violation of the grammatical structure?

I'm rewiring a Strat and I'm trying to figure out if I should wire it like the American Standard Strat or the Eric Johnson Strat.I'm leaning more toward the Johnson,because the bridge pickup gets the tone control,but on Fender's website(If you look on Fender's site and go to support,they have wiring diagrams for all their guitars)the American Standard Strat wiring diagram and the switching /control diagram have the bridge pickup connect to a tone control.So basically it claims all the pickups are connected to a tone control.Anyone with either of these guitars who wants to weigh in please do so.I've heard both guitars on YouTube and it seems like the Eric Johnson Strat sounds better,but then again the guitars have pretty different pickups and electronics in them.The Johnson Strat just seems to sound more responsive and crisp.

Hi everyone, i just finished reading Wuthering Heights and i noticed something: Heathcliff hates Catherine, partially because she reminds him of HIS Cathy, although she has nothing in common with his mother but the eyes. Isn't this a lot like when Snape looks at Harry and is mad at him cause he reminds him of Lilly, although he has nothing in common with his mother but the eyes? Another point: both these men live really close with these children, which are both orphan.   I'm not saying Rowling took the idea from Emily or anything, i just like the fact that reading a book it reminds me of another one, and i'd like to know if you notice this thing too? By the way, i loved both Wuthering Heights and the Harry Potter saga.

She answered and a manly voice said, ‘‘May I speak to Miss Stevenson?’’ ‘‘It’s me,’’she replied. ‘‘Miss Stevenson, my name is David Rogers,’’ the man explained, as Eli, the phone placed on her shoulder, poured the steamy tea in a mug. ‘‘I don’t know how to… Well… You see… Your mother. Your mother died, Miss Stevenson.’’ Although Eli and her mother were not on speaking terms, Eli felt as though someone had punched her in the stomach. She dropped her cup on the floor. ‘‘Is everything all right?’’ David said. ‘‘Yes, I just dropped a mug. It’s okay. Now, tell me… What happened?’’ ‘‘A stroke,’’ the man said, ‘‘Also, Miss Stevenson, your mother left you everything she owns.’’ ‘‘What?’’ Eli screamed. ‘‘Everything,’’ the man whispered.   -   She was at her mother’s house and had three days to pack everything. She was going to sell most almost everything. The rest would be donated to charities. Eli had no intention of keeping anything that had belonged to her mother. Everything had to go. Everything. As she was packing some of her mother’s old records, someone knocked on the door. Eli answered it and an elderly lady walked in, smiling. ‘‘You must be Elisabeth,’’ she said. ‘‘I am… was… your mother’s friend. Teresa. Teresa Sanders. I live next door. I was wondering, do you need some help?’’ ‘‘I don’t need help,’’ Eli replied, ‘‘but I sure wouldn’t mind a little company.’’    -   Eli was going through some of her mother’s old pictures. Teresa was sitting on the floor next to her, smiling and admiring the old photographs. For some reason, the old lady kept telling Eli all those stories about her mother, and about how great a person she was. What Teresa did not understand was that Eli hated her mother. Each time she thought about her mother, or heard her name for that matter, all Eli could think of was that Night. It was as though all the good memories of her childhood had disappeared after It happened. She closed her eyes and her mind was back in 2001. She was coming home from her friend’s house, where she had spent most of the evening. Rain was pouring. She took her key out of the pocket of her pink sweater and opened the door. She slipped inside the house. ‘‘Mom?’’ Her voice echoed in the house. She went upstairs, opened her mother’s door, and… There she was. On the bed. With… ‘‘Is everything all right, Elisabeth?’’ Teresa’s voice brought Eli back to reality. ‘‘Oh, yes, I was just… Never mind. So, where were we?’’   -   Eli and Teresa were sitting at the kitchen table, enjoying fluffy pancakes. Teresa took a bite and a drop of syrup leaked on her chin. Eli blushed and thought there was something rather erotic about that. She smiled. ‘‘You have syrup on your chin. Let me help you.’’ She gently approched her hands towards Teresa’s face; the sixty-year-old woman blushed. Eli quietly rubbed the syrup and, instead of wiping it on a napkin, licked her long fingers. She winked. ‘‘Haha, are you teasing me?’’ the old lady said. ‘‘Perhaps,’’ Eli answered. Eli then started rubbing her foot against Teresa’s vagina. It was so inappropriate, so bad, but it felt so good, and so right. Before they knew it, the two women were in bed, making love.   -   They were lying in each other’s arms. ‘‘I was coming to clean out my mother’s old house and found true love,’’ Eli said, smiling. Her teeth were as white as virgin snow. ‘‘You have beautiful teeth, Elisabeth,’’ Teresa said. Eli laughed. ‘‘I remember,’’ the old lady continued, ‘‘When you were a child you used to brush them four times a day.’’ Eli gasped. ‘‘Oh, my God!’’ she screamed, ‘‘How do you know that? Are you my? You sick *****! You are my mother!’’ ‘‘Listen, Eli,’’ the old lady cried, ‘‘I did not mean for this to happen. I faked my death and asked Nephew Philip to say he was a man named David. I wanted you to come here so that I could pretend to be a neighbor. To get close to you.’’ ‘‘Close to me? We are lying naked in a bed together! We couldn’t be closer!’’ ‘‘Listen, about that Night…’’ Eli closed her eyes and remembered that night. She went upstairs, opened her mother’s door, and… There she was. On the bed. With… With Greta, the next door neighbor. ‘‘You broke father’s heart when you felt him for that woman!’’ ‘‘I am so sorry, Eli! Forgive me.’’ Eli looked into her mother’s deep blue eyes and thought about how her boyfriend Melvin was waiting for her home, whilst she was in bed with another woman. In a way, she was just like her mother. How could she not forgive her? ‘‘Let’s make love again,’’ whispered Eli, ‘‘Let’s be shameful tonight, and regret it tomorrow.’’

20090131173005AAfqjVP	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	A question for poets?	Do you ever feel like you are just so full of emotions - be it anger, sadness, despair, ennui even - that you just can't write. I am full of fodder for beautifully disastrous poetry, but I just can't get it out. Maybe I'm too full up. Maybe I need a few days to let all of this week's events set in and I'll be able to write again ... I just can't go through another 3 year writers block.   Don't rush it right?   Writing a good poem is like starting a relationship ... it starts out getting to know the subject and the audience, then you write a few drafts, each one getting better, then one day you finally read it and think ... why did I waste 5 years on this stupid poem?? Just had to throw a little humor in there.   I want to dance with everyone else. :-(

And tell my love I've gone to walk where sons of Adam lie.   I gather dust.  I sit and wait.  "Bring forth my lust from out this gate!"   Tell me why I have to wait....   Where sons of Adam lie.
20090131184938AAb6UhA	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What do you think of my first chapter ?	Chapter 1   Strange        Jason got up it was a bright Monday morning in Cornwall. He was off to school just like any other fourteen-year-old schoolboy. Jason was in year nine. He was about five foot ten, had brown eyes, and was rather good looking. He could grow up to be an actor or model or like so many, both. He lived with his parents whom he loved. His father was very tough on him and rather cold but Jason would never admit that. His father had short brown hair and glasses. As he reached his middle-aged years he recently has gotten slightly plump. His mother was loving and caring and very protective of him. She had long blond hair and blue eyes. Jason didn’t look anything like his parents, which he always found weird. “Fifteen minuets Jason.” His mother yelled from downstairs. Jason was smart, had a few mates and was on the schools football team. But for some reason he was always bullied at school. He hated school, how he was ridiculed for his intelligence angered him greatly. “Jason downstairs now!” Bellowed his mother. “I’m coming.” Jason said irritably. Jason went down dressed in jeans and a plain white t-shirt. “Go out to the bus boy.” Jason’s father said. Jason hated how he never addressed him by his name or son. Just boy ever since he could remember. Jason went out to the bus stop and saw his best mate Max. “Hey Max.” Jason said as he walked up to him best friend. “Hey, did you finish all that homework last night? Mrs. Anthony really poured it huh.” Max said     “Yea it wasn’t to hard.” Jason said trying not to hurt his friend’s feelings. Max was always jealous of Jason’s academic achievements. Max wasn’t dumb but competitive like most boys his age. He always strived to be at Jason’s level. Sadly he could never reach it. It seemed like everything Jason did he was better. Max was short, about five feet. He was horrible at sports and terrible with girls. “So are you ready to get the **** beaten out of us today?” Max asked attempting to put humor in an unfunny situation.     That is one thing Max did do well. He was very funny. “I’m getting so sick of it I think I may fight back today see what happens you know maybe I’ll kick the **** out of him.” Jason said hopefully “Are you crazy? Billy will beat you more and he’ll probably get some of his rugby pals to help. You won’t stand a chance, just take it and hope it’s not to bad. Like me,” said Max. The bus pulled up and Jason was off to school. The bus ride was full of Max’s hilarious stories. The first class was double chemistry, which was excruciatingly boring. Then was math and after that was the most dreaded part of the day, lunch. Jason was eating outside with Max when what he feared most was coming over Billy Butcher. Billy was a heavy boy. He was sixteen but still in Jason’s grade. He had short brown hair, and was about six feet tall. “Hey fags how’s it going?” Billy said with his entourage snickering in the background. “Just leave us alone.” Jason said in an unconvincing weak voice. “Come on lets have a little fun come over hear pal.” As Billy said that one of his friends pulled Jason over with his massive arms. There was now a crowd around them hoping for a fight. The teacher on lunch duty today was Mrs. Dawson; a delirious old woman had no control of what happened at lunch. So that did not help Jason. Now there was a circle surrounding Jason and Billy therefore he could not run away. He now will have to do what he said he was going to do this morning. Face Billy Butcher. “Come here little boy.” Billy said in mocking tone, as if Jason were an infant. Then Billy sprang after Jason. Throwing a punch right at Jason’s face. Jason dodged it. He didn’t know how, but it felt good. Billy looked like a fool missing his punch. He recovered and got back up into his fighting stance. “Come on pussy face me like a man.” There was obvious frustration in Billy’s voice. He usually knocks out his targets in one punch. Now with this huge crowd watching he didn’t want to damage his reputation by losing in a fight to someone who is half his size, he was starting to feel pressure. With every ounce of strength Billy had he threw a punch at Jason. Jason grabbed Billy’s hand not really knowing what he was doing he then preformed a roundhouse kick on his longtime foe. Billy was knocked out cold, blood dripping from his nose. Jason then pushed through the crowd and ran. He didn’t know where to go, the only logical place was home. His father was at work, but now he hoped his mother was not home. Maybe she went shopping, that is what he hoped. But all of that left his mind when reflected on what just happened. He had just knocked out the biggest, and toughest kid in school. Then he asked himself, how.

I stood in front of Tyler who had that killer look on his face. My magic was no match for his, he has had years and years of practice. I knew I was going to die here and I was fine with it. As long as Kyle didn't get hurt, nothing was wrong. My shirt was stained with blood from my cuts that had now stopped bleeding. "Poor little Nikki. All alone in pain and no one to help you. I bet you wish Kyle was here to protect you don't you? Well I would kill you now but I think I will wait till he arrives. Him seeing me kill you would hurt him...but then again hurting him physically and mentally would please me greatly." He ran his fingers through his greasy brown hair. "No" I tried to make out. "Leave Kyle out of this. Don't even get near him! Don't touch him or do anything!" I managed to scream out. "Aww protecting your boyfriend are we? Well even if he is my cousin, I would like to kill him...but lets start on hurting you first."

Up there came a flower,   The people said, a weed.      To and fro they went   Thro' my garden bower,   And muttering discontent   Cursed me and my flower.      Then it grew so tall   It wore a crown of light,   But thieves from o'er the wall   Stole the seed by night.      Sow'd it far and wide   By every town and tower,   Till all the people cried,   "Splendid is the flower!"      Read my little fable:   He that runs may read.   Most can raise the flowers now,   For all have got the seed.      And some are pretty enough,   And some are poor indeed;   And now again the people   Call it but a weed.

Insidious and creeping, he now slides into your head    Whispering his sullied words into your ear    “Oh, how they mock your agony! There’s no remorse, no not a shred”   A red mist falls, it’s potent anger you so fear       Your actions aren’t your own he’s taken all your might and will    Their panicked faces feed the vile brute within    Is this the only path to take? For you to maim, for you to kill?   Will you walk away or will you let him have this sin?      Then something snaps and you are gliding    Slowly forward, now you’re smiling    This beasts scheme sounds so beguiling    You will kill them all for lying    Watch and laugh while they are dying    Fight the thoughts?

20090131180544AAQplXq	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I Am Desperate- Please Tell Me If This Is A Novel That Is Good Enough To Get Published!?	I am a pre-teen, and I am deeply serious about writing- it is my life.   I have been wanting to get my novel published for so long, and I want to know your opinion. Please tell me if you liked the story, and if it might be good enough to get published. Please be honest. Thanks! My story is right here:     The Reckers            Chapter One     Coop. Not much of a name for me, but I liked it. It was my name, my thing. Id always wanted a more better name that I could dig, but I could live with it.      And I wasnt about to change it to something that didnt suit me. Cooper, for long, but my members called me Coop. Just plain ole Coop- nothing special about it.      See, all of us members had a name- for the gang. As for the others names, there was my close friend, who always went by the name Mac. Id always digged that name. Just something about it made me happy.     Mac was just the person of good looks. Dark brown hair, long, tall, and slim, and cold, hard eyes that could get you just right into a good, mysterious stare. This always gave me the sudden shock of guilt sometimes.      Mac was the type of rebel who didnt give a care about anything. The cops. They were the ones that got him into a real fight. And sissies, too.        Me and the other member always seemed to go with his plans. I never had any idea why. Maybe because we thought that we were rebels, too.      Me, just a kid with no sense of emotion, tried to play it cool all the time.  None of the others seemed to give a care, either.      Me, really, I was just a kid who had natural looks. Nothing like Mac. I had brown hair, dark brown eyes, and I was skinny as well.      None of us really ate that much. There was Pin, too. He was the kid who caused all sorts of confusion between the gang.      Never did anything fun. He was just the follower. Like the groups sissy. did get into fights, but never did cause any serious harm. He was the one who made the gangs book.      Rule book. It was stupid, really. We didnt need rules. We just broke them. We were The Reckers, not some wimpy group. Anyways, Pin was a sort of wimpy guy who had black hair- almost the color of Macs.      Wore glasses, too. As I leaned on the hood of the Mustang, I watched all the guys go into the gas station.       All of them seemed like sissies- like they couldnt get into a fight with even a little kid.  But we could sort them out if we needed to. Mac was getting some more gas for the car- since all we did on weekends was run flat tires and burn rubber.     I glanced up at the sky, as I kicked my leg back into the car, trying to get it back into shape a bit. Pin and me had rammed the Mustang into a tree when Mac was away.  Man, and he sure didnt know about it, either. On weekends, thats all we did. Live and have fun.      I sighed as I bent down, examining the huge dents on the front of the car. Man, Im sure notta a car fixer I mumbled to myself quickly, peering over my shoulder at Mac, who was in the station- ruffin it up a bit with another guy.      No Come on I said, as I rushed in the door. Mac was up at the counter, with another guy, yelling. Pin was over at the other side, gittin some ciggarettes and stuff.      We always did that when we got the chance to go to the gas station- but, we could only really get what we wanted when Mac was distracted by yelling at other guys.     Pin looked up at me, as he nodded. Hey, Coop, git over here. He said in a slight mumble, as I walked over to him. I looked over my shoulder, then stood next to Pin.      I stared at the food with hunger. None of us had eaten in a while, and boy, were we all hungry. I bent down, my hands on my knees, and my body leaning on a rack.     What? I asked him in wonder, as he took out his wallet, fingering it carefully. I sighed, looking at it. It was empty. Pin was a moneyless kid, who never did steal. Mac and me thought it was weird, cause he didnt even try to, either.      I gave him a confused look.  Whyd ya do that for? Im not gonna give you any more money- I need to save some to get me a Mustang someday. I replied, as Pin smiled with amusement, putting his wallet back in his pocket. Pin walked over to the corner of the store, as I followed.     I just need a buck. And, ya know youre never gonna git one. Were lucky now that Macs letting us use his when he takes us places. He answered back, sticking a piece of gum in his mouth, then offering me a piece. I nodded, then took the piece from his hand.      I looked over my shoulder at Mac, who began to yell at the guy. I sighed in agreement. I knew Id never get a car, anyway.      My grades in school werent good at all to even get one, but I didnt give a care. School just wasnt one a my things. Neither Macs or Pins.     I reached for my wallet, as I grabbed out a a crumbled up buck. Man, Pin always had a spell on me or something. Mac always gave out on him, though. He never fell for any of our ways.      I han

Please tell me if you liked the story, and if it might be good enough to get published. Please be honest. Thanks! My story is right here:       The Reckers              Chapter One       Coop. Not much of a name for me, but I liked it. It was my name, my thing. I’d always wanted a more better name that I could dig, but I could live with it.        And I wasn’t about to change it to something that didn’t suit me. Cooper, for long, but my members called me Coop. Just plain ole’ Coop- nothing special about it.        See, all of us members had a name- for the gang. As for the other’s names, there was my close friend, who always went by the name Mac. I’d always digged that name. Just something about it made me happy.       Mac was just the person of good looks. Dark brown hair, long, tall, and slim, and cold, hard eyes that could get you just right into a good, mysterious stare. This always gave me the sudden shock of guilt sometimes.        Mac was the type of rebel who didn’t give a care about anything. The cops. They were the ones that got him into a real fight. And sissies, too.          Me and the other member always seemed to go with his plans. I never had any idea why. Maybe because we thought that we were rebels, too.        Me, just a kid with no sense of emotion, tried to play it cool all the time.  None of the others seemed to give a care, either.        Me, really, I was just a kid who had natural looks. Nothing like Mac. I had brown hair, dark brown eyes, and I was skinny as well.        None of us really ate that much. There was Pin, too. He was the kid who caused all sorts of confusion between the gang.        Never did anything fun. He was just the follower. Like the groups’ sissy. did get into fights, but never did cause any serious harm. He was the one who made the gangs’ book.        Rule book. It was stupid, really. We didn’t need rules. We just broke them. We were The Reckers, not some wimpy group. Anyways, Pin was a sort of wimpy guy who had black hair- almost the color of Mac’s.        Wore glasses, too. As I leaned on the hood of the Mustang, I watched all the guys go into the gas station.         All of them seemed like sissies- like they couldn’t get into a fight with even a little kid.  But we could sort them out if we needed to. Mac was getting some more gas for the car- since all we did on weekends was run flat tires and burn rubber.       I glanced up at the sky, as I kicked my leg back into the car, trying to get it back into shape a bit. Pin and me had rammed the Mustang into a tree when Mac was away.  Man, and he sure didn’t know about it, either. On weekends, that’s all we did. Live and have fun.        I sighed as I bent down, examining the huge dents on the front of the car. “Man, I’m sure notta a car fixer…’’ I mumbled to myself quickly, peering over my shoulder at Mac, who was in the station- ruffin’ it up a bit with another guy.        ‘’No… Come on…’’ I said, as I rushed in the door. Mac was up at the counter, with another guy, yelling. Pin was over at the other side, gittin’ some ciggarettes and stuff.        We always did that when we got the chance to go to the gas station- but, we could only really get what we wanted when Mac was distracted by yelling at other guys.       Pin looked up at me, as he nodded. “Hey, Coop, git over here.’’ He said in a slight mumble, as I walked over to him. I looked over my shoulder, then stood next to Pin.        I stared at the food with hunger. None of us had eaten in a while, and boy, were we all hungry. I bent down, my hands on my knees, and my body leaning on a rack.       “What?’’ I asked him in wonder, as he took out his wallet, fingering it carefully. I sighed, looking at it. It was empty. Pin was a moneyless kid, who never did steal. Mac and me thought it was weird, ‘cause he didn’t even try to, either.        I gave him a confused look.  “Why’d ya do that for? I’m not gonna give you any more money- I need to save some to get me a Mustang someday.’’ I replied, as Pin smiled with amusement, putting his wallet back in his pocket. Pin walked over to the corner of the store, as I followed.       “I just need a buck. And, ya know you’re never gonna git one. We’re lucky now that Mac’s letting us use his when he takes us places.’’ He answered back, sticking a piece of gum in his mouth, then offering me a piece. I nodded, then took the piece from his hand.        I looked over my shoulder at Mac, who began to yell at the guy. I sighed in agreement. I knew I’d never get a car, anyway.        My grades in school weren’t good at all to even get one, but I didn’t give a care. School just wasn’t one ‘a my things. Neither Mac’s or Pin’s.       I reached for my wallet, as I grabbed out a a crumbled up buck. Man, Pin always had a spell on me or something. Mac always gave out on him, though. He never fell for any of our ways.        I han

The novel is set in Melbourne (Australia) but I'm not sure whether to use the names of Melbourne's actual shopping centres, hospitals, etc. or make up my own? I haven't written anything that could be seen as offensive if I did use the actual names, but I still like the idea of creating my own places so I don't have to worry about accuracy. What are your thoughts on this? Would you be turned off if you read a novel with fake names to places?

20090131181016AAK6oz7	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Do you see the story my 12 yr old wrote getting published.?	Perfect.P-E-R-F-E-C-T.That's how I would describe my life over 2 years ago,I had the best life.My dad was a teacher at the local university,and my mom was pregnant with my baby brother.I,Mary-ann was taking honors classes.You could feel the envy other people had for us.But on January,January 4th  to be exact the strongest bond would  break into little pieces and scatter everywhere.I was in the middle of it,me the girl from the 'perfect' family.      It all started out as one of those days,those 'everything is going to be the same and nothing new is going to happen' days.But I hardly have those days,my days are always packed with new surprises and I can't doubt it.Like always I woke up to the strong morning sunlight,and the chirping of the birds.I never wake up to a alarm clock I was always a early bird every since I was a baby.I quickly went into the bathroom and showered.In the next 15 minutes I was wearing my school uniform,a light blue shirt and navy blue pants and black shoes.I was ready to go downstairs and smiled to myself as I thought of the smell of warm blueberry pancakes that usually filled the kitchen in the mornings.The thoughts alone were enough to make my mouth water.A couple of seconds later I was out of my room and running down the stairs like a speeding bullet.I stopped,something was wrong.Terribly wrong.The kitchen that normally smelled like rich food smelled dull.Flat,dull,blah."Mom!,mom where are you?''I screamed I was getting worried."Your father and I are in the living room!'' she said. I sighed in relief, calmness quickly washed me over.I took my time and walked over to the living room.I sat down I saw my mom she was 7 months pregnant,her eyes were red and puffy like if she had been crying.I looked at my dad's face I carefully examined it, his face had a mixture of sadness and guilt written all over it.  ''Mary-ann your father and I have something to tell you''she said.I also noticed how she said the word 'father' with hate."What is it mom,is something wrong?'' I said panic hitting me like a strong big wave."Joanna,please let me tell her this is all my fault." my father had said to my sad looking mother."Mary-ann,please sit down and listen." he had said.I slowly nodded and made my way to the soft-looking couch.            “Mary-ann,your mother and I are getting a divorce” my father  said as I starred in awe.”W-What!'' I screamed out louly    This could not be happening I thought. Last night we were watching movies, eating pizza,and playing twister.We laughed 'till our stomach hurt. That doesn't sound like a family that was about to get divorced .I was suddenly startled out of my thoughts when I heard my mother sobbing.”Wait a minute,what about the new baby YOU CAN”T GET DIVORCED YOUR HAVING A BABY IN 2 MONTHS!” I screamed,I swear people down the street heard me.”Mary-ann please calm down,I know this is hard for you to process but you never scream at your parents like that young lady!'' my mother said,with the maddest face I've ever seen.   ''Am sorry,but that's crazy you have a kid on the way you can't Split up,for god's sake!'' I said,as tears on my eyes started to fall.''Why are you getting a divorce?'' I said,I wanted to slap myself for not asking the most important question when your parents were getting a divorce. “Mary-ann,I have been having a affair with Amber Zinger” he said with bare guilt dropping from his words.   “NO,NO,NO THIS IS YOUR FAULT WE COULD HAVE BEEN A HAPPY FAMILY BUT YOU HAD TO BE CHEATING ON MOM WITH WHOEVER THAT WOMAN IS” I said I was FURIOUS.''Am sorry Mary-ann,please forgive me'' my father said before my father had something to say I ran out the door and ran as fast as my long legs could carry me,I just wanted to escape all the drama,anger,betrayal and make pretend it was a dream that I would soon wake up from.I quickly realize I was in a dark alley with a dead end.I quickly turned around I must have accidentally ventured in here when I was too mad to comprehend what I was doing.I sighed in relief  as I found a sidewalk that lead to my middle school.I put my knuckles in a fist as I remembered what my father did.How could he do that? Wasn't he happy enough with us as family why did he cheat, why? All these questions  ran wild through my head.The sight of a black SUV with tinted windows disrupted me from my thoughts.It went the same pace I going 'its following me I thought' I ran a bit faster when a feeling in my head told me to do so.As soon as my speed increased so did the car's. I really couldn't see who was driving the car 'oh no' I thought 'this is the bus spot  I have to wait here, what if somebody comes out of that car and kidnaps me?' I was getting very worried since this was a deserted street and if I did get kidnapped nobody could hear my screams and call the police.Large footsteps disrupted me from my thoughts,I quickly turned my head and saw a guy  with a bad haircut, a white shirt, jeans, and black shoes.He was walking towards me I froze on the spot I cou

20090131180131AAoQR8W	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	I call this poem "True Friends"?	They will have your back and be at your side.   They will give you their shoulder when someone has died.   They will give out their hand if you ever fall.   Brush you off clean and stand next to you tall.      They're honest but lie when you need them to.   Ask them a favor and that's what they'll do.      True friends are the ones you would die for.   Hero or not—just to let them live longer.   So, try to be true to everyone you meet.   You'll never know when your life needs rescuing.
20090131182059AAJlaMW	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What do you think about this poem?	The Light of Tomorrow    Id love to think the sorrows of tomorrow were melting in the glitter of shadowy lands.....  To know that no such thing as tears existed.....  To only feel the love and joy of those around you....  To not be hurt by the world of unrecognized love...  To have no people see what you cannot do, but instead what you can do...  To fight, without fear, for what you really want...  To have the cluttered noise that surrounds your ears to vanish into a land of years begone....  To feel and see, not just believe, that tomorrow will be OK,  So nobody will have to cry in anguish of future judgments...  And live a life, always facing tomorrows light.    I wrote this poem and I was wondering if it was any good...thanx!!!

20090131164721AA08Z1A	Arts & Humanities;Other - Arts & Humanities	I saw end of world in 2060. Why once the world ended I would return as the Messiah in China?	This is evidence, If you can speak Chinese，you will not doubt my identity.    http://groups.google.com/group/the-divin...       Because of me, the Chinese government has completely controlled by the United States and the European Union. China will soon implement the two-party system.   3.4   When they will be close the lunar ones will fail,    From one another not greatly distant,    Cold, dryness, danger towards the frontiers,    Even where the oracle has had its beginning.      Because of the Third World War, end of the world in 2017. Why I return as the Messiah in China? The fuse of the third world war is the war in the Taiwan Strait in 2008. I just want to tell you, there is a great plague coming, more than two thirds of humanity will be died. The upcoming terrorist deal with a major disaster. So I spam again and again.   2.46   After great trouble for humanity, a greater one is prepared,   The Great Mover renews the ages.   Rain, blood, milk, famine, steel and plague,   Is the heavens fire seen, a long spark running.   5.32   Where all is good, the Sun all beneficial and the Moon    Is abundant, its ruin approaches:    From the sky it advances to change your fortune.    In the same state as the seventh rock.   10.42   The humane realm of Angelican offspring,   It will cause its realm to hold to peace and union.   War half-captive in its enclosure,   For long will it cause them to maintain peace.   3.92   The world near the last period，   Saturn will come back again late.    Empire transferred towards the Dusky nation，   The eye plucked out by the Goshawk at Narbonne.      The last time spam. I am Isaac Newton. I will appear in Jerusalem. According to "the Hebrew Bible", my date of birth can be calculated. I am a hero. I will tell you what is "Armageddon". I think that Chinese people like dogs. I will take the yellow people and the black people into concentration camps. When you see me, I will make you feel speechless. I will take Barack Obama and Condoleezza Rice into concentration camps, I think that the black people and Latinos like dogs.   1.50   From the three water signs will be born a man，   who will celebrate Thursday as his holiday.

20090131173906AAc2jsK	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Can someone critique my writing skill?	This is about my mother and her influence in my life.I already posted the bottom on yahoo and got some good feedback so I decided to add more lines to it. I am hoping that at the end, I will write enough paragraph for a college essay.What do you think? Once again, feel free to share your own philosophy of life or correct any mistake in mine            “She built a kingdom of knowledge with a third grade education. She has more wisdom than the intellectuals who claimed to be philosophers. Her voice could turn the stubborn to the right direction, her hands could feed the world. When injustice and impunity filled my heart with anger, disgust and resentment, it was in her arms that I discovered the power of forgiveness. She is not a divine creature, thus there is no way that she could suddenly change the negative feelings that I carried in my heart. However, I was to liberate myself till I let my heart ill from within. I realized and understood that A young heart must liberate itself from the dark relic of its past in order for it to reach the dream that it has always fought for. Regrets can only hold it in a backward abysmal and make it bitter. Sadly, a heart that is rotten by bitterness can become a dark nest where hate likes to grow. I should not hate my imperfections because hate makes one blind and obstructs their judgment. It is hard to forget past mistakes and to forgive those who has hurt me but instead of moaning on what has been done I ask God for the courage to accept the things that I cannot change and the wisdom to accept what I cannot change.      If you don't believe in GOD, I respect your choice but I am asking you to critique the writing, the wording but not to judge my belief. I will never dare to judge you, so I hope that we won't turn this into a religious or spiritual battle.      Peace and Love

I ran her home and we sat in her living room.       “How did you like it?”       “You house was beautiful.”       “You weren’t scared at all?”       “Not one bit” was she crazy? A normal person would be.       “Vampires don’t scare you?”       “Not if it means staying alive forever.”       “Why would you want to stay alive forever?”       “To stay with you”       “You would trade a great human life, for an eternity of being a vampire? Just to stay with me?”       “Yes”                                                  I laughed and kissed her, and she kissed me back. Would she really trade a great life for an eternity with me? I never want to leave her; I never want to be without her. Maybe she felt the same about me? I decided to pretend to give in.  I leaned down and kissed her neck.       “Are you ready?”       She nodded, I laughed inside my head.       “You ready, ready for it to be the end? The twilight of you life?” She nodded again.       I laughed out loud. I sat up and she looked confused.       “Do you really think I would give you what you want this easily?”       “A girl can dream”       “Is that what you dream about, being a monster?”       “Mostly I just dream about being with you, the monster part is just extra”       “You’re extraordinary”        I leaned down and kissed her again, my life finally had a meaning to it. And that meaning was Bella.       I looked outside as the day ended, but as my life has just begun. When I looked out, I saw the beautiful gleaming, sunset.

20090131205232AAT8rYv	Arts & Humanities;Dancing	Does this sound like a good idea for an after-school center and school?	This is a little long, so you only have to read part of it. Okay, so I want it to be an acrobatics, dance, and academic center. I'm only in 10th grade so it's just a dream of mine. Here are the acrobatics levels:      Tumbling Tots Level 1 (ages 1 and a half to 3)   Tumbling Tots Level 2 (ages 2 to 4)    Tumbling Tots Level 3 (ages 3 to 5)   AcroFlexi Level 1 (kindergarten to 2nd grade)   AcroFlexi Level 2 (1st grade to 3rd grade)   AcroFlexi Level 3 (2nd grade to 4th grade)   Junior Acrobatics Team (3rd grade to 5th grade)   Senior Acrobatics Team (5th grade to 7th grade)   Elite Acrobatics Team (7th grade and up)      Dance Levels (mixed and Showgirl have ballet, jazz, and contemporary, but you can add on modern or tap to any level and Pointe to Elite Showgirls)   Creative Movement level 1(ages 1 and a half to 3)   Creative Movement level 2 (ages 2 to 4)   Creative Movement level 3 (ages 3 to 5)   Mixed Dance level 1 (kindergarten to 2nd grade)    Mixed Dance level 2 (1st grade to 3rd grade)   Mixed Dance level 3 (2nd grade to 4th grade)   Junior Showgirls (3rd grade to 5th grade)   Senior Showgirls (5th grade to 7th grade)   Elite Showgirls (7th grade and up)         Academics:      There will be a day school and a boarding school for students that wish to study intensively. The day school is basically like most privte schools, for 1st grade through 5th grade it starts at 8:00 and ends at 2:30. They will start a small group lesson until the real lesson with other children outside of school starts at 3:30. Then they will return home. From 6th grade to 12th grade, school starts at 7:30 and goes until 2:00. After all lessons are done, they will return home. Boarding school is basically the same, except for students are allowed to spend 30 minutes of extra time with instructors.

20090131190603AA4Wevp	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Plz read and tell me wat u think of it:)?	This is a chapter in a book that I am working on, please read it and tell me what you think of it. Any feed back is good =)              I left Alicia's house party quickly. It seemed like Alicia had her hands full and was really too busy to talk at the time. My house was only about five blocks away from her house anyways, so I figured it would not be too much trouble to walk home. Besides it would give me time to think. Time to think about my strange re-accuring dream that I been having for the past week.    Every night, I dreamt I was in a dark, dreary forest. I had no idea how I got there, nor how I would get out. I would run through the forest, desperatly trying to find my way out, venturing deeper and deeper into the forest, until all was black. The only think that would be visible, would be a pair of bright, red eyes.    I shivered at the memory of my nightmare, and picked up the pace. By now the music from Alicia's house was next to gone. I walked down the dark street to my house, listning to the last bits of audible music, until all was silent.    I quickened my pace even faster. The darkness was not helping me feel better about my nightmare at all. Plus it felt like I was being watched. I was finally half way home and looking forward to having a nice cup of hot chocolate while snuggled in a chair reading my newest book, The Clique.    "Kiana..."    I stoped in my tracks. For a second my heart stopped beating. I slowly turned around to see a teenage girl, standing in the middle of the street, staring at me.    I did not recognize the girl at all. I looked at her and racked my brain. How did she know my name? Did I see her at the party? Is she from my school?    I stared at the girl. She must have been the most beautiful girl I have ever seen. She had long blonde hair that reached all the way down to her waist, big round sea blue eyes, full lips and a figure that any girl would kill for. She had pale, flawless skin that reminded Kiana of a proclain doll.     But yet, Kiana could not help but feel unsafe and scared.    The beautiful girl walked over to Kiana. She was just as graceful as she was beautiful. Kiana watched the girl as she walked closer and closer. She watched as the flawless girltook stride after stride. With every step, a smile would form across her face. Baring pearly white teeth, and two sharp teeth that reminded Kiana of fangs.    Slowly yet steadily, the girls eyes turned from their beautiful Sea Blue, to a deadly, gleaming bright red.    It was the girl from Kiana's nightmare.

Has esteemed place in its chalice,   Called on in times of malice,   To cancel the night,   To free my sight.   Called by a single strike   Called to banish  my dreamlike pike,   Which makes me sleep.      A whispering lady,   Sorrounded by shady, sombre, night   Gives me a dimmer picture,   A diluted mixture,   For me too make my way,   At least,   Till morning comes at long last,   Until nights shade is re-cast.

I'm not sure what scared me the most. The crackling sound of the flames or how it lit up so brightly. I pulled the covers up to my chin and stared wide-eyed at the flames that tossed themselves throughout my bedroom. The flames made my blue wallpaper curl up. I tried to shriek but my voice caught in my throat.    I woke up screaming. I looked around my perfect bedroom, wallpaper still on the walls, and my dresser no longer ashes. My throat felt as dry as cotton.    I glanced over at my digital clock. "6:38 in the morning!? But I felt like I was sleeping for hours...Days, even!" I cried out loud to myself.

20090131143559AAvbKTv	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Suggest a fun light fantasy book?	Hi, i always liked fantasy a lot and ive read some random books that crossed my hands (silmarillion, LOTR,etc, now im reading Robin Hobbs' Royal Assassin)   But what i've really enjoyed is Dragonlance, though it felt a bit too much gamelike.   So i am looking for a book with same great storytelling Robin Hobb has, but a bit more of a "fantasy" (i mean Hobb really lacks elves, fairies etc.), and id also like it to be somewhat lghter than Tolkien, without long descriptions of battles etc. Something simple, fantasy and fun like dragonlance but with better storyline.   Preferably the main character has to be somewhat witty and sarcastic:)   Please advice.   Thanks in advance.

I am having trouble analyzing this poem by emily dickinson:      The Mushroom is the elf of plants   At evening it is not   At morning in a truffled hut   It stops upon a spot.      As if it tarried always;   And yet its whole career   Is shorter than a snake’s delay   And fleeter than a tare.      ‘Tis vegetation’s juggler,   The germ of alibi   Doth like a bubble antedate,   And like a bubble hie.      I feel as if the grass were pleased    To have it intermit;   The surreptitious scion   Of summer’s circumspect.      Had nature any supple face,   Or could she one contemn,   Had nature an apostate   That mushroom, - it is him.      I understand the first two stanzas, however, the last ones confuse me...do you know what they mean?   Thanks for any help!
