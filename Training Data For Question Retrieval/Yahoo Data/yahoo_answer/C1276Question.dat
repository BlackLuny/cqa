A second disk of mass M2 = 264 g and radius R2 = 6 cm, initially not rotating, is dropped on top of the first. Frictional forces act to bring the two disks to a common rotational speed ffinal.       What is ffinal? Please give your answer in units of rpm, but do not enter the units      I think I have the problem sort of set up correctly, but I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong.  Here's what I've started with:      I1w1 = (I1 +I2)w2     w2 is what I'm solving for:      So, (350)(10^2)(157/10) = ((350)(10^2) + (264)(6^2))w2   The answer would come out as rad/sec I think, so I tried to convert by dividing by 2pi and then multiply by 60.  I got about 118 rpms.  But this isn't the correct answer.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!

20090308043302AArLUwN	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Please solve and explain any & as many of the following 3 questions as you can. Quite challenging. Please Help?	1. An equilateral triangle has sides of length 1 cm. Five points lie in this triangle (on the sides or in the interior).   (a) Show that two of the points lie no farther than .5 cm apart.   (b) Show that .5 (in part (a)) cannot be replaced by a smaller number even if there are 6 points.   (c) If there are eight points, can .5 be replaced by a smaller number? Prove your answer.         2. Let a, b, and c denote 3 different colors, and if x and y are among a, b, and c let xy denote the result of “mixing” the colors x and y; in each case xy is among the colors a, b, and c. This is a hypothetical   situation that is not meant to pertain to actually mixing light, or paint, or any other physical entity. Suppose that mixing these colors satisfies the following rules.      (i) xx = x, for each color x. (Mixing a color with itself results in that color.)   (ii) xy = yx, for all colors x and y. (Mixing x with y is the same as mixing y with x.)   (iii) x(yz) = (xy)z, for all colors x, y, and z. (The order in which you mix the colors doesn’t matter.)   (iv) ax = x, for each color x. (Color a is “clear”; that is, a mixed with another color is that color.)      Show that there is a color x among a, b, and c that absorbs all colors in the sense that x mixed with anything is x (ax = x, bx = x, and cx = x.) Note that you are not being asked to show which of the   colors absorbs all colors, but only that one of the colors has this property.         3. Suppose for a positive integer n both 2n+1 and 3n+1 are perfect squares. Show that n is divisible by 40.

Hi, from my childhood, whenever I had to calculate anything (add/subtract/multiply/divide), I was writing on the paper and used to calculate. Later, i started using calculators. Now, whenever I had to calculate when these are not available, I find it difficult to calculate in mind even the simple calculations (like 25 x 7, I take quite some time). I am a postgraduate, so people around me keep asking me to help calculate things for them, and I feel embarrassed when I cannot answer them immediately. So can anyone help me find out methods to learn to calculate in mind.  Thanks in advance.

20090227135918AAqnhh5	Science & Mathematics;Other - Science	Amino acids -> First protein -> First life -> Consciousness -> ?	This is a doozie, and I can't take credit for it.  I was reading Black order by James Rollins and he posed the question of what comes after consciousness.      Here's the argument:   Suppose quantum measurements ultimately collapsed potential into reality.  Amino acids formed the first replicating protein because life was the better quantum-measuring device.  And if you extrapolated that further, consciousness, which was an even greater quantum-measuring device than life alone, evolved for the same reason.      So what is a better quantum-measuring device than consciousness?      (This stuff is taken right out of the book, so please give credit to the author, not me.)      I've been speculating about this, but haven't reached any conclusions yet.  Please refrain from illogical religious responses like, "That's not what God said."

The other day in my Chemistry class my teacher set up and eve straw up by a clamp, and placed a candle under it. After that he got a scoop of this powdery substance and dumped it into the eve straw and when it hit the candle it made an awesome flame explosion, like pyro. When I asked him were I could find something like that he laughed at me and said ooh.. somewhere, lol. when he left the room I went and read the bottle and it said "Lycopodium". I don't know if this is what its called but i would like to find out how, and if I could possibly get my hands on some of this, and were i could find it. And if anyone knows what I'm talking about and knows the correct term for it that would be helpful as well. My main purpose for wanting something like this is  for some kind of pyro effect for my band when we play live, Ive been thinking up a contraption that I could make so that I wouldn't have to do the flame by hand. thanks to anyone with a good answer

20090227141354AANn0Nt	Science & Mathematics;Geography	How to name a creek, officially?	We would like to name a currently unnamed creek.  If you look on a detailed map, you will notice that almost every little creek has an official name, even ones that are dry half of the year.  We have such a creek that flows through the edge of our property.  You may have noticed that almost every creek that crosses beneath a road has it’s own sign which displays the name of the creek.      We would like to name the creek after my wife’s deceased father, who willed the property to her before he died of cancer.  He was the first of the current local land owners to own property in the immediate area of the valley.      Current Attempts...      We first contacted the Ozark National Forest Headquarters in our county seat.  They were baffled as to how to name a creek.  They directed us to an individual who should know...      The individual was baffled as to how to name a creek.  He said that the USGS usually did that, and that he would try to find out who specifically to contact.  I am patiently awaiting his e-mail.      I decided to take a “multi-pronged” approach and contact the USGS myself.  After a few transfers and holds on a long distance phone call, I was finally transferred to an expert on the subject.  He said that he was baffled as to how to name a creek.  At his request, I left him my phone number for him to let me know who I need to contact.  I am patiently awaiting his call.      Legitimacy...      It is a seasonal creek with multiple springs throughout it’s length, one of which flows year-round (no matter how dry the Summer).  Some of the springs literally bubble up from the ground when the ground is saturated.  It is about 2,500 feet long, longer than other named creeks.  Our property is where the creek is most managed.  The property is also the most effected by the creek.  No-one is, or would, contest any naming rights of the creek.  We are on good terms with our neighbors, including the two other owners of the creek.      When the creek is at it’s highest depth, it floods a fair portion of the property and has even damaged multiple fences.  It has it’s own concrete culvert, with an opening of approximately six feet squared.  The creek can flood so high that the culvert can not drain all of the water, and it nearly floods across the road (rarely).      Next Attempts...      I will contact the county courthouse to see if they can help me.   I will contact the highway department to see what they know.      So why do I need to ask the question on Yahoo Answers... Because I am trying everything I can, hoping that I stumble across the answer.

20090308015514AAeY3de	Science & Mathematics;Chemistry	Question/Problem Concerning [O+], [OH-], pH, and pOH?	Hi guys and gals! I have a chemistry homework problem that is hard to understand at this point, as the class has just moved on to this topic of acidity. The problem I have with it is near the beginning, in that I do not understand the what the initial concentration given refers to exactly. I will substitute different values in, in order to keep this as "legit" as possible (i.e. I'm not a cheater). Here goes:      Calculate the [H+], pH, pOH, and [OH-] of a 0.2345M (molar) sample of acetic acid (CH3COOH, or, C2H402) that has a Ka of 1.80 x 10^(-6).   Also, what is the % dissociation? And does it meet the "5% dissociation rule"?      If you understand any of this then I would greatly appreciate a response (and if you're into "points" on Yahoo! Answers, I can get you ten of them :) ).      Thanks a lot for your response(s)!

20090227141801AAqJlhS	Science & Mathematics;Astronomy & Space	How does a space shuttle maneuver in the vacume of space?	Newon's third law of motion states,       "for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction"      Consider the flying motion of birds. A bird flies by use of its wings. The wings of a bird push air downwards. Since forces result from mutual interactions, the air must also be pushing the bird upwards. The size of the force on the air equals the size of the force on the bird; the direction of the force on the air (downwards) is opposite the direction of the force on the bird (upwards). For every action, there is an equal (in size) and opposite (in direction) reaction. Action-reaction force pairs make it possible for birds to fly.      So, how can a space shuttle maneuver in a vacume such as space if there is no air?

20090308060910AApdWwc	Science & Mathematics;Engineering	Does backfeeding of the excitation current going to the field coils of an electric generator ever occur?	Modern electric generation power plants do not use permanent magnets but rather use current driven field coils.  It is my understanding that the field coil current is generated by a separate smaller generator to excite the field coils of the larger.  But it seems to me that the magnetic force caused by the current in the coils that are generating electricity (the armature) would be far greater than the magnetic field caused by the current in the field coils coming from the small generator.  I am assuming here that the armature windings are going directly into the grid and so they have lots of current going to them.  So what prevents the current from going the opposite direction in a modern electric generator, i.e. to cause a backfeeding of electric current into the field coils?  This is confusing because the armature windings that generate the electric current can be either in the stator or the rotor, so that isn't part of the reason why.

The only chips I've seen are the square chips, and I wouldn't know how to breadboard that for testing.        If theres another series chip that has 50+ i/o pins that would be fine, it just needs to be a pic.  I've seen atmel chips that have about 80 pins and they are rectangular so they are easy to breadboard, but I'm having a hard time finding them from microchip.
20090308064643AAwPn3j	Science & Mathematics;Astronomy & Space	Why is Milky Way's supermassive black hole not so massive for a galaxy of our size and mass?	If the Milky Way has grown to its current size by cannibalizing on many smaller galaxies, why is it that our supermassive black hole is very small (compared to some of our neighbors)? M31 has a supermassive black hole of around 100 million solar masses while ours is only around 4 million. Do you think the Milky Way may have been already considerably large (and massive) after it formed around its supermassive black hole or that most galaxies it acquired are mostly rich only in dark matter?      Article comparing size and mass between M31 and Milky Way to be nearly equal:    http://www.universetoday.com/2009/01/05/...       For M31's supermassive black hole mass:    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_G...       Anyway, I wouldn't want it to be larger since there's a greater risk for it frequently going into AGN phase. That would make it rain more radiation around the galaxy. Also, is the relatively small number of our globular clusters an indicator of our supermassive black hole's (Sagittarius A*) mass or the number of galaxies we acquired, or both? Thanks in advance for your comments!

20090308072019AAaFO8I	Science & Mathematics;Biology	Question about cloning, nuclear transplantation etc....?	We've been studying such processes as these in biology at university, and I'm a little curious.      What with so many species nearing the brink of extinction (white rhinos for example, and "Lonely George") is there any way we can boost their numbers again through these methods?  I understand that other members of the species may be required - Dolly the sheep involved several, I've heard - but is there any way of reproducing one of these species with minimal participants?      I also understand that the process would be expensive, if possible, but if we were to produce only one or two, so that natural reproduction may be possible - would it not be worth a try anyway?      I'm not sure if there's already information on this, or whether it's a waste of time/impossible so any answers would be welcome.  Even if you could suggest a link that I can look up for more information on the matter.      Thanks in advance.
