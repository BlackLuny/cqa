20090131110210AAzB65m	Home & Garden;Decorating & Remodeling	Painting question??????????	When we moved into our home 3 years ago, aaaaaaaaaaallll of the woodwork (all original woodwork, it was built in 1924) was painted.  Wacky colors too - magenta, navy blue, bright red, purple, green, blue, tan, brown, burgundy, etc.  We didn't have time to strip it as we would have had to pull it off plaster and (that doesn't always go the way you want it to because the plaster cracks sometimes)... ANYWAYS, so we painted it all white and now it's beginning to chip and peel off in some places.  It's really bugging me and I want to repaint it (once again, can't do the stripping it because we have 2 young children and it would take too long and fumes and all that jazz), but I don't want the paint to peel and chip off again after a year or two.  What do I do???

I am getting ready to remodel my kitchen and bathroom, but the floor slopes in the kitchen quite a bit and a little in the bathroom. I would jack up the house and even it out but its connected to my garage. I am not sure if it will mess anything up by doing so. I really don't care if my garage gets messed up cosmetically, because that is an easy fix, but I don't want to damage the structural integrity of my garage. Is there a carpenter here that could walk me through this process? I used to rough in new homes, but this is something I never encountered and I don't want to take this project lightly.

20090131113910AAWJ7dJ	Home & Garden;Decorating & Remodeling	Mating a new floor with the bottom of a door frame?	I'm nailing down 1/2" thick engineered wood flooring.  The flooring manufacture recommends a 1/2" gap for expansion at all vertical surfaces.  The bottom of the back door frame is 1/4" thicker than the flooring and there's a 2" wide threshold on top of that set about 2.5" from the inside edge of the bottom of the frame.  The door swings outward.  Door, frame and trim work are all red oak and the floor is a light tobacco colored Brazilian Teak.  The flooring is running perpendicular to the door.  If I use another threshold or T-molding to cover that 1/2" expansion gap I think it'll look a little odd with two thresholds with a 1.5" gap between them.  I'm looking for any other suggestions on how to cover this gap.  I was considering trying to rout out the underside of the door frame so as to slide my flooring underneath.  I know I'd have to hand cut the ends where the router stops and I have a Japanese style saw for that.  But I'm new to routering and haven't been to the store yet to see if there are any bits available to do this.  I'm also not sure yet how that will affect my ability to seal there either as it is an entry door.  That entry is covered by a large porch but I'm sure there will still be some water tracked in at some point.      I want to do this right and have it look good.  Any suggestions at all will help.      Thanks

This is a question that has been driving me crazy for years.

It comes on with the thermostat, but no air blows out  of the vents in the house.  By "comes on," I mean the big fan comes on (actually kinda sounds like a Cessna) and when I look in the fan cavity, the pipes are iced, so I know SOMETHING is cooling.  I've shut it off completely in the hopes that the problem is that the unit is iced solid inside (I'm not opening anything to check, since I have no clue what I'm looking at.)  It can't be the filter, because I hosed it off a week ago, and when I checked it just now, it's still clear and wide open.  Its only 23 months old.  What do I look for here?

20090131105154AAyO9Ez	Home & Garden;Decorating & Remodeling	Refinishing hardwood floors?	When we moved into our house 3 years ago, we pulled up the old carpet and refinished the original hardwood floors (which were laid in 1924).  We stripped the old varnish and finish off and sanded down to the wood.  We stained it, then put 3 or 4 coats of polyurethane on it, allowing 24 hours in between coats for the coats to completely dry and scuffing the previous coat so that the next coat would adhere.  We then waited a couple of days before we walked on it and about a week before we moved furniture in.  After about a month or so, the polyurethane began to flake up and now (3 years later), it is flaking up   BADLY all over the house and the floors look terrible.    What did we do wrong?  What should we do in the future to avoid this happening again?  What kind of clearcoat should we use?  What kind (if any) sealant should we use?  How do we do it?  Thanks for any help!  God bless!
