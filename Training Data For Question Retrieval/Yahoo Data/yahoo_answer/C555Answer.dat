eiBTfB21aa	I'm not sure it's really true about Kerala penises, but I'm sure that wet underwear is not the cause.  There's a tribe of natives in Africa who all have penises hanging almost to their knees - and they don't wear any clothes at all.  I believe penis size is a result of genetics.|`|f5191aba5751468b68546dd1761f9a23aa	Not true.  I had a friend in college from Kerala, and she asked to see mine to "compare".  She said that I am bigger, and that many girls there have alway heard the myth that men from there are HUGE.  <br>  <br>  Maybe some are, but most are not.

y8xKsk4Baa	Realize that most guys stick to the code of eyes up and front.  The occasional perv looks, but it's not very often.  Pick a urinal on the far end where you only have to worry about one guy using the one next to you.  (Also, most guys stick to the every other urinal if there are enough available.)  Try and go when you have a full bladder and really need to go.  Urgency sometimes prompts release.|`|eiBTfB21aa	Try to use the restroom when no one else is using it.  You could always use the stall to pee in if using the urinals with other guys nearby bothers you.  Mostly, just relax, because lots of guys have the same problem.|`|2605473a77834e14ba7a471ac17a1453aa	This is a simple one.  When you're at the urinal do simple multiplication problems in your head and relax your PC muscle.

Then if you have to go at school just try to go at a time when you know the hallways aren't bustling with people. <br>  <br>  If you have to go to the restroom when people are taking a leak just try to go to the last urinal. Or go to the last stall. If you start to feel more comfortable but you still want to use the stall you can always leave the stall door open. <br>  Best Regards,<br>  Gordon

CB4ag09Paa	I kind of understand where you are coming from. I lost my mom 10 years ago to pancreatic cancer. My grandmother 3 years before that (her mom) and now I am the primary care giver of my dad who is slowly declining with COPD. <br>  <br>  It is *very* distressing and has nothing to do with "pulling up your boot straps" or "just get over it", "snap out of it"....etc. Please ignore any and all arrogant people who might tell you it's no big deal or make any statement that even hints to that....because it is a big deal. <br>  <br>  I take nerve pills (klonopin) myself as I already suffer from several of the anxiety disorders. I was diagnosed before everyone became so strict with anti-anxiety meds. <br>  <br>  Try taking a Tylenol PM before bed or another OTC sleep aid like Sominex. They will relax you and help you to sleep. If that doesn't help talk to your doctor about the nerve pills and see what he says. He will most likely put you on a sedating anti-depressant like Remeron. You might get lucky and get a small script for a real anti-anxiety med like Xanax. <br>  <br>  Research what medications you feel most comfortable with and then talk to your doctor about them weighing the pros and cons. <br>  <br>  Take good care.|`|NYBQ8i7iaa	I am very sorry about your dad,but ever thing you have described is normal when you lose Someone very close to you.Keep yourself surrounded by your family i don't know about pills maybe you should have a chat with you doctor he might prescribe you something just to help you get through the first few weeks.|`|VSFvJ3praa	When you're in pain from loss or undergoing the grieving process, things that don't ordinarily have any effect on you might, I would wait awhile before taking anything, unless it's really obstructing your life.<br>  I'm sorry for your loss.|`|ZU9eS6N7aa	grief is normal.

They hand them out like candy. However, they take 6-8 weeks to kick in and I think you'd be feeling better by then anyway. <br>  <br>  I think you would probably benefit more from counselling then pills. <br>  <br>  I'm sorry for your loss.
1a3821666b5e9eb7adce75f4b1cea9b4aa	Hola!<br>  como estas?<br>  Basicamente se recomendaba a partir de los cincuenta a?os,  pero debido al incremento de los pacientes y las consecuencias de este padecimiento se recomienda que se comience a revisar a partir de los 45..... con examen de sangre para checar el antigeno y la visita al medico para examen rectal. Pero si en la familia en linea directa existen o existieron antecedentes de cancer de colon, diabetes, problemas con la vesicula, o alguien a presentado problemas de hprostata entonces hay que poner cuiadado a partir de los 40 a?os, mas o menos.<br>  Qué es la Hiperplasia Benigna de Próstata? <br>   Es el aumento del tama?o de la glándula prostática producido por un aumento relativo de los estrógenos (hormonas femeninas) sobre la testosterona (hormona masculina) que aparece con la edad en los hombres. Es muy común que con la edad, la próstata vaya aumentando de tama?o. Es esta situación la que se conoce como Hiperplasia Benigna de Próstata, un crecimiento considerado no maligno (no cancerígeno) de la próstata. <br>  Las células de la próstata poseen receptores sensibles a la testosterona y a los estrógenos, cuando el equilibrio entre ambas varía por la edad se estimula la reproducción de diversos factores de crecimiento celular originando el progresivo aumento de tama?o de la próstata glándula que puede ser variable dependiendo de diversos factores. Estos otros hechos que predisponen al aumento del tama?o de la próstata son la existencia de obesidad, hipertensión, intolerancia a los hidratos de carbono por resistencia a la insulina y alteraciones en las grasas de la sangre. <br>   ?Cómo puede detectarse el crecimiento de la próstata? <br>  El médico, normalmente lo detectará mediante un examen rectal. También es posible examinar la uretra, la próstata, y la vejiga usando un citoscopio, instrumento que se inserta a través del pene, para ver en qué estado se encuentra la próstata, pero no es habitual realizar esta prueba para valorar el crecimiento de la próstata.<br>  Normalmente, los síntomas del paciente son los que orientan al especialista hacia el diagnóstico apropiado. Por medio de una exploración rectal el médico puede palpar el tama?o de la próstata y saber si ha aumentado de tama?o o no y su consistencia. De este modo se puede descartar la aparición de un tumor.<br>  Además, un análisis de orina permite conocer si hay o no una infección urinaria coexistente.<br>  Asimismo, se puede realizar un análisis para valorar la cantidad en sangre del antígeno prostático específico (Prostate specific antigen, PSA), sustancia producida por la próstata y que debe encontrarse dentro de unos límites. Si esta sustancia no se encuentra dentro los límites normales se realizarán otras exploraciones para comprobar si existe o no una patología más grave.<br>  A veces se utilizan métodos para medir el flujo de la orina (flujometría), y puede ser útil la ecografía abdominal para medir el tama?o de la próstata y descartar otras enfermedades en la vejiga o la presencia de cálculos en su interior.  <br>   ?Cuándo puede comenzar la Hiperplasia Benigna de Próstata? <br>  Es muy raro que se manifieste antes de los 40 a?os, pero más de la mitad de hombres con 60 a?os, y más del 90 % entre 70 y 80 a?os presentan algunos de sus síntomas.<br>  Generalmente, comienza pasados los primeros 30 a?os, para evolucionar lentamente, causando molestias a partir de los 50. Por supuesto, sólo se da en los hombres, puesto que las mujeres carecen de próstata.  <br>   ?Qué sucede en la Hiperplasia Benigna de Próstata? <br>    La próstata, al crecer, puede ir comprimiendo progresivamente la uretra provocando, por tanto, dificultad al orinar. Esto sucede porque esta compresión impide el flujo de la orina desde la vejiga hacia la uretra hasta el exterior. Las posibles consecuencias son retenciones de orina en la vejiga o reflujo de la orina hacia los ri?ones y una necesidad de orinar frecuentemente. Si la inflamación fuera muy grave, puede bloquearse por completo el sistema urinario. <br>   ?Qué síntomas se dan en la Hiperplasia Benigna de Próstata? <br>   Al ser el crecimiento prostático un proceso lento los síntomas aparecen progresivamente, se llama prostatismo y aparecen de forma secuencial. Los principales son:<br>  dificultad para orinar <br>  chorro débil de orina <br>  necesidad de orinar frecuentemente <br>  necesidad de orinar por la noche <br>  necesidad de apretar para conseguir vaciar la vejiga <br>  el acto de orinar se realiza en dos tiempos con chorro entrecortado <br>  sensación de que la vejiga no se vacía completamente <br>  dificultad para iniciar la micción <br>  goteo de orina al acabar <br>  sensación imperiosa de orinar .<br>  <br>  Lo mejor sera que consultes al medico especialista y le hagas todas las preguntas que sean necesarias para que aclares tus dudas.<br>  Te felicito por estar interesado en el tema , y sobre todo por la actitud para prevenir.<br>  Que tengas una vida muy sana, suerte<br>  y que goces de un buen dia!!|`|1phHooqGaa	a partir de los 50 a?os. a menos que sientas que algo no anda bien con tu prostata (por mala suerte) se hinche, aumente de tama?o, y tengas dolor cuando vas al ba?o, al tener relaciones etc, claro verificando que no sea alguna enfermedad infectocontagiosa relacionada con el sexo. (consulte al medico).<br>  <br>  quien sabe? debe de ser parecido al cancer de mama en la mujer, cada vez aparece en personas mas jovenes.|`|413a56caac02651b2f20b234df3a5fd9aa	Mira le verdad no se, me parece que cerca de los 40 mas o menos, solo te doy un consejo,a cuerdate que eyacular mas de 5 veces por semana baja el nivel qde que a futuro tengas problemas en la prostata. <br>  <br>  Asique hay que darle al sexo o a la paja.<br>  <br>  Suerteeee|`|nYbRb4YXaa	el cancer de prostata puede aparecer a diferentes edades aunque esta mas relacionado a los hombres mayores de 40 a?os aunque deberiamos empezar a aprender las maneras de prevenirlo desde antes pero debido a el tabu que existe sobre este tema pocos lo hacen pero en realidad todos deberiamos tomar conciencia y hecernos el examen anualmente al llegar a esta edad|`|AA11088842	despues de los cuarenta a?os  debe acudir a un urologo para hacer el examen es muy breve y no causa dolor|`|q4mschzIaa	despues de los cuarenta a?os debe acudir a un urologo si te duele al orinar, si hay sangrado,no es normal si tienes estos sintomas es mejor una revicion medica temprana, no te afanes pero mas vale prevenir que curar, cuidate chao|`|58c923d3d758863fcc445e2b25e5c136aa	Si hay antecedentes de cancer de protáta en tú flia, es conveniente que comiences a partir de los 40 a?os, de no ser así, y no observas problemas al orinar, comienza a partir de los 45 a?os, hoy día el avance de las investigaciones nos permiten contar con medicación efectiva para muchos casos que antes solo se solucionaban con cirugia, por lo que no hay nada mejor que prevenir, te haran tacto rectal e indicarán el analisis de antígeno prostático específico, es importante que los hombres tomemos conciencia de la importancia de realizar el exámen aunque no nos resulte muy agradable la idea.

yWkU8ps2aa	I wonder that same thing.  My feet went from a 7.5 when I was in junior high to a 6 senior year in 2006 to now .  I never gained or lost any weight.

Now when I try her shoes on, they're too big.|`|Lii7TioDaa	maybe the shoe brands make irregular sizes. did your feet shrink sizes with the same brand?<br>  <br>  this is very interesting. i've never heard of feet getting smaller, but i do know they get larger with age, because the weight of our bodies flattens them out in time.|`|W2zS2lnNaa	apparently it is possible, how strange.

I was on fertility treatment to try and get pregnant, and it wasn't until I started checking my bbt and cervical mucous that I finally fell pregnant.  From memory, your body temp is supposed to drop by a degree about 24 hours before you ovulate, so if you avoid having sex for a few days when that happens then you should be able to avoid getting pregnant.  I think the unfertilised egg only lasts for about 24 hours, but sperm can last several days, so if you think you're due to ovulate, then be wary of those little spermies leading up to that time!  Good luck!|`|tH8GAQB6aa	Yes, I was doing it for about 4 months and stopped because it wasn't working with having Polycystic Overy Syndrome and not having reg cycles...I have just started doing again because I started met. and have just had a reg. period after taking a hormone drug.<br>  <br>  Good luck, a bunch of my friends have found it ( bbt) helpful!
AA11686559	Stop using the products you're using. It sounds like you are having an allergic reaction. You could stick to the sensitive skin line from Aveeno.  You may have a bit of rosacea too, which could cause that type of reaction. Either way, that product is not good for you.  Perhaps its the salicylic acid in the Clean and Clear that keeps you from breaking out. That can cause irritation in some people.|`|5YHkwpZwaa	your reaction can be because you may be allergic to the chemical composition to the product or maybe when you washed your face you scrubbed too hard and your skin was sensitive. If it keeps happening i think you def. need to stop using the moisturizer, you don't want to have a bad allergic reaction. Um i use clinique moisturizer. Its a bit more pricey then clean & clear, but doesn't burn and controls oil. Hope this helps|`|0f07198a7aefed8d4442413f775584f6aa	if you are sun burnt it will burn That has happened to me if it burns try to wash it off it might still burn for a while but it will go away|`|55847fd1310248228ee7e1a0d3944b69aa	Besides being allergic to something specific to only that type of clean and clear, your skin might be like mine REALLY sensitive i only use aveeno now! um....... I actually used to use that stuff! If it has the beads in it then thats whats rubbing up against your face and making it hurt...its like rubbing little rocks constantly on your legs, its just going to irritate it and hurt!!! i have also heard that the beads can cause broken cappilaries, making your face look RED!!
cIfBHk1Kaa	Heat 2 glasses of cola (try to find a healthy kind) with 10 thick slices of fresh ginger. Add 2 tablespoons honey and the juice of a lemon and drink the mixture. (This recipe is very popular in Hong Kong.)<br>  There are a ton of great all natural home remedies like this one at the website below.<br>  good luck with your homework.<br>  peace<br>  GG|`|VSFvJ3praa	Try loud-ish (not loud enough to give you a headache, but loud enough to keep you awake) music and plow through it. Try cool water or tea to help with the temperature, and maybe a fever reducer if you have a really high body temperature (I think more than 100 is the standard guideline.)<br>  If you start falling asleep on your work, try to set an alarm to go off every once in awhile, since you really need to finish.<br>  Other than that, just power through it, I guess.

Deberías hacer primero alongamientos en forma general. (Consulta a un fisioterapeuta para que te indique los alongamientos que no te hagan mal)  -  Media hora de bicicleta por día ( no te va a perjudicar la rodilla por que en la bicicleta no haces impacto)  y "nadar" es la mejor forma de desarrolllar los músculos en forma pareja.  No levantes pesas, es muy malo para la salud. Con los a?os vas a tener consecuencias.  <br>  Como dieta, te recomiendo que comas verduras y pescado. Elimina el pan por el momento y las carnes rojas.  Fideos y carne de pollo sin piel. No tomes bebidas con gas.  Tomá 10 comprimidos de levadura de cerveza, tres vecez al día. Esa es la dósis para atletas.

zCmY8jLDaa	To show off your abs, you need to burn off the layer of fat that is covering them. To do this you need to go on a calorie restricted diet and do a lot of exercise including cardio and sit ups. The layer of fat will not go away by simply doing sit ups and crunches. If you already have a low body fat percentage than doing situps and crunches will help you. Don't go crazy with them. A lot of people go to the gym and fo hundreds of situps and crunches every day. They treat their abs differently from every other muscle in the body.

Además de los problemas locales, su principal riesgo es la embolia pulmonar, la que puede ser fatal.<br>  <br>  La trombosis venosa profunda deja secuelas locales que en el largo plazo pueden ser causa de várices secundarias, alteraciones tróficas cutáneas y úlceras venosas. Estos trastornos son motivo de ausentismo laboral e incluso de invalidez. <br>  <br>  El conocimiento de los factores predisponentes nos permite evitar el desarrollo de la trombosis venosa y sus complicaciones.

a4b20b8ed961cfe0fc29cf3d3c1d0038aa	if you have been taking your BC religiously (every day, no skipping pills) then your chances of being pregnant are very slim. Depending on the pill brand, you only have about a 1 to 2 out of 100 chance of getting pregnant.  Check the insert that came with your pill pack for details. Usually when the Pill fails as a BC method, it is because the person skipped pills or didn't take a pill after a missed dose.  It is normal to miss periods or have periods so light that you don't even notice them (according to my doc, any blood can be considered a period) when you are on the pill.  The general rule of thumb is not to worry until you miss 2 periods (no bleeding whatsoever). If you are really worried, you can take a home pregnancy test. BC pills don't interfere with the results of a pregnancy test. Good luck!|`|AA12131791	The pill if taking properly is only 98% effective.  Using a condom makes it 99.9%<br>  <br>  Now nothing is 100% effective except not having sex so there is a slim chance of getting pregnant (ask my sister in law about that slim chance).<br>  <br>  If you are worried about pregnancy take a HPT|`|k6iCTHvzaa	Well when you say you are taking BC religiously, that scares me. If you were to take more than the one pill a day, PLEASE go see your Doc. It doesnt double up protection and it could seriously damage your body.<br>  <br>  There is no reason a coulpe shouldnt use condoms. It isnt wierd to bring up anymore so why dont you just tell him to put one on. Even say it suductivly and it will make him melt as he puts it on.<br>  <br>  Look at it this way, BC will give you only half the protection you are looking for. Condoms add an extra coverage of a quatrer. So never forget you can ALWAYS become prego. Always. My sister was on BC and used a condom and I now have a 4 year old niece.<br>  <br>  I suggest looking into the IUD. Thats 5 years of prego protection and you can go with out condoms if you are truly agenst them. Only if you are with one partner that is. The IUD doesnt protect agenst STD's though.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!

djrcJ0QIaa	First of all my experience with this situation is both personal and professiona b/c I work for an OBGYN.  <br>  I have personally had simular occurance.  My obgyn had me repeat my pap every 6 months after the 1st abnormal.  I then had a colposcopy, which to be honest is more nerve racking to sit in the room and wait then it is for the procedure itself.  That came back with abnormal cells. Had to have cervical biopsy with the same results.  Unfortunately I had to have a LEEP procedure in the hospital to cut out the abnormal cells b/c mine was cancerous.  That was 2 years ago and I have been cancer free ever since, no chemo and no abnormal paps since.<br>  You may want to ask your GYN what exactly was abnormal with your pap, did it have abnormal cells, maybe a reoccurrant yeast infection creating the problem, cervical lesions, etc.  Do not drive yourself nuts over any outcomes.  Just keep up on your health as you seem to do and everything will be fine.  If you do have a colposcopy, make sure you take some advil or alleve before the procedure, it will reduce any cramping you have afterwards.  Good Luck.|`|hMavMBo4aa	I had 3 abnormal paps in a row, and my last one was a re-pap after 6 months and it was normal- yay!  She had me take folic acid every day, and that was it.  What kind of abnormal was it?  Mine were like abnormal squamous cells, and that's not a big deal, so they say.|`|b8a8f89e712b53fc056e4479cc732bd4aa	A colposcopy is when the doctor inserts a lighted microscope in thevagina to examine the cervix and inside of the vagina. It's not painful. Alot of things can cause you to have a abnoraml pap smear. He might want to do a cervical biopsy. That can be painful but he should numb the cervix first and minimize the pain. If he does this you'll have some cramping after for about a day or teo and possibly some spotting but it's the best why to determine if there's an infection or something else. I wish you the best luck, and pray it is not cancer.|`|6748007ac489c14a5dc03512115d7983aa	My gf had the same last fall. She was worried too, but I did some research and what used to pass for normal results may now be abnormal because of all the attention given to HPV recently. She had the colposcopy and everything was fine. She said it hurt a little bit but nothing major and was a little sore or tender down there for about 2 or 3 days. <br>  Good luck.

Still has some oxygen left in it.  When  it's had to time to diminish it's oxygen and be contaminated and dry, then of course it starts turning very dark red to almost a black color.  It's called "old blood" when it's dark.  It's called "fresh blood" when it's bright red.  If blood coming right out of your body is dark, then it's a sign of old blood and that's not really good.

AA11536343	This type of coldness is ususually associated with being underweight , which can cause some circulation problems. Unless you are very short 97 lbs is tiny . I would check with your doc before starting niacin and think about putting on a few lbs , but in the meantime sock and layers will help , also hot showers warm me up but only for a short amount of time.|`|SSGFqXwNaa	why take drugs for that? <br>  put on some layers, and maybe get some arm warmers or something, who knows what the side effects are, but before making any decision see a doctor!!!|`|AA11850523	Niacin flush only lasts less than 10 minutes<br>  IT sounds like you have circulatory or thyroid problems
q1GnMRxxaa	If you are on a medication you can call the company that makes it and they often will give you a discount on the price and sometimes supply it to you for free. Also if you can change insurance to something that covers mental health, I would. It sure doesn't make sense that they don't cover mental health like they do all other health issues. mental health is a physical problem of the brain, so it really makes me mad that they don't consider this.|`|1XcO0fwiaa	community health centers or look around for a different insurance coverage that includes mental health. there has to be one that doesnt cost too much.

This is a place that charges you by a sliding scale and depending on how much you make per year ,could be a cheaper option for you. Even though you make too much for county assistance these places usually top there charges out at a lower rate then an individual psychologists, so even if you are paying the highest rate , it will more then likely be lower then a private doctor.|`|L1u5GtA5aa	Some hospitals offer their 'own' insurance plans as long as you go to their hospital and use their doctors (providers).  If your doctor has diabnosed you with a bi-polar disorder, I know that has some negative implications when applying for insurance.  My psychiatrist has never used a bi-polar diagnosis for me for that reason.  I have dealt with insurance companies in the past through my job working at a hospital, and I do not ever remember running into an insurance company that does not cover mental illness.  If I were you, I would shop around.  You do not mention your age, so don't know what insurance companies for you to look into.  If you have a mental disorder, have you ever looked into applying for disabiity.  Again, I do not know your age, how long you have worked etc.  Good luck.|`|qx3MCh2Naa	you can see if there is a community center in your area. also try to get samples of your meds.

8TqsmDxnaa	Ultimately it is a choice you have to make.  Anything else is only masking or hiding the problem and will come back.  You must make the decision to control your own life.  Once that decision is made, you'll have success.  That doesn't mean it will be easy.<br>  <br>  Eat only when hungry, eat only to get satisfied, and NEVER eat to get full.  Repeat that phrase daily.<br>  <br>  Once you remove the bad foods especially processed foods, sodas, sweeteners of all kinds, and refined foods, you'll find it much easier.  Most people who have this problem are eating the wrong type of foods for their body.  Those wrong foods act like a drug and keep you coming back for more.  Eat only natural fresh foods, snack on celery.  Once you clean out the bad your body will stop craving and you can control things better.  Remember to drink good water daily to help flush out the toxins.<br>  <br>  It may also help to enlist your mom and friends to help you control you.  Don't forget to exercise, it does a body good and helps you take control of your body.<br>  <br>  Make the decision and then make it happen.|`|eu4KOXPJaa	if u think you are hungry drink a huge glass of water and i mean chug it down if u are still hungry after that then u really are hungry eat something drink as much water as possible and it will help|`|mS5MLbhSaa	Do sports get involved in some activities dont b in ur house as much but try to eat healthy couple of junk food wouldnt urt but dont eat to much of it :P|`|AA11457728	If you like to nibble on things, nibble on things that last long, you can actually by special weightwatchers gummys just for nibbling on.<br>  Or chew gum.<br>  <br>  But drinking water is the best alternative.<br>  <br>  And make sure to eat a good breakfast, if you dont youll be more likely to snack throughout the day to compensate.|`|KLb2xJ2qaa	Drink water and fiber products<br>  <br>  You'll fell full and you won't feel the need to constantly eat.|`|kiDRiJmVaa	i have the same problem, , i try a lot of things, like getting busy, watch tv, drink lots of water, but what helped me the most is working out, and i make myself healthy snacks that i can eat constantly but it wont affect me, like jello, smoothies with fresh fruits and honey instead of sugar, or just a little bit of sugar, almonds, peanuts, baby carrots, fruit salads, cucumber with salt and lemon, etc. you could find a lot of healthy choices online, i eat a little bit of everything but importantly drink a lot of water if you exercise, lets face it is very hard to stop eating if your eating cravings are caused by anxiety or emotional problems, but you can do it without harming yourself,  or gaining weight if that's what worries you the most, good luck.|`|54wWs8pGaa	fill your stomach with water<br>  also, brush your teeth or chew gum if you start craving|`|IxImDpv1aa	yeah drinking water helps but like for only half an hour<br>  what i do i take vitamins their cheap , u can find them any were , and they stop u from eating allot <br>  and if u still fell hungry eat a fruit or a vegi....<br>  or eat 5 times x day (low amounts of food)|`|PMMMRs0Eaa	Drink lots of fluids.

That's what my endo suggested for me because I have the same problem sometimes..ugh! lol.|`|Jgg7zYLQaa	Well if they are under 70 then eat something high in sugar like juice.

Don't worry it happened to me to I'm type 1 are you because this might not apply to people with type 2 I'm not sure.

Es bien sabido por las y los pacientes que el VPH no se erradica con electro-cauterización o crioterapia con nitrógeno líquido, no importa cuantas veces les hayan practicado estas técnicas, siempre reinciden las lesiones. Pregunta a tus conocidos y ellos te informarán.<br>  <br>  Las VACUNAS TERAPéUTICAS contra los virus han demostrado su eficacia en enfermedades como la rabia, el virus de hepatitis B o C, citomegalovirus, herpes simple y zoster, virus de papiloma humano, entre otros (dicho sea de paso, estas enfermedades virales suelen presentarse como infecciones oportunistas en el paciente infectado por VIH-1, lo cual por sí solo justificaría su utilidad). <br>  <br>  Los estudios preclínicos y los ensayos con animales han mostrado que el método de la inmunoterapia con vacunas terapéuticas puede ser inocuo – en el sentido de “generalmente bien tolerado”  – y eficaz, mejorando las respuestas inmunitarias sin incrementar la carga viral.<br>  <br>  ?Qué son las vacunas terapéuticas?<br>  <br>  VACUNAS TERAPéUTICAS<br>  Una vacuna terapéutica es un método inmunológico relativamente nuevo que se diferencia de las vacunas profilácticas en que no se emplea para prevenir las enfermedades, sino que se administra a personas que están infectadas. Uno de los objetivos de las vacunas terapéuticas es reforzar el sistema inmunitario de las personas infectadas, para favorecer su capacidad de combatir la infección. <br>  <br>  Hasta el momento es el único procedimiento terapéutico que ha evitado recaídas o reincidencias de las lesiones.

El HPV tiene ADN, esto quiere decir que posee información genética que los diferencia en virus HPV tumorales relacionados con distintos tipos de cáncer y no tumorales relacionados solo con verrugas y lesiones no cancerosas .<br>  <br>  Existen casos en que los virus no tumorales por la cantidad de lesiones llevan a la destrucción local de tejidos, produciendo un cuadro llamado displasia verruciforme que se asemeja clínicamente al cáncer.<br>  <br>  El estado inmunológico del paciente juega un papel muy importante, ya que con las defensas bajas las infecciones por HPV tumorales suelen ser más agresivas y las infecciones por HPV no tumorales pueden causar lesiones muy importantes por la cantidad de virus y su persistencia en el organismo.<br>  <br>  Virus HPV tumorales.<br>  <br>  El HPV 16 es uno de los virus más estudiados. Se encontró relación entre el HPV 16 y el Cáncer de Cuello de útero, con enfermedades precancerosas y cancerosas en el pene (Papulosis Bowenoide, enfermedad de Bowen, Eritroplasia de Queyrat, todas estas enfermedades precancerosas del pene relacionadas con el HPV 16) , como también en cualquier parte del cuerpo que estuviera infectando. Otros virus HPV relacionados con el Cáncer de Cuello Uterino son el 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 68, y subtipos menos frecuentes.<br>  <br>  La relación entre el cáncer y el HPV se debe fundamentalmente a que la persistencia del mismo en el cuerpo (dentro de las células) produce alteraciones y cambios en las células que está infectando induciendo a su transformación maligna.<br>  <br>  Para los virus HPV tumorales el motivo del tratamiento es fundamentalmente prevenir el cáncer, el contagio a otras personas, estético y también psicológico ya que las personas con este tipo de infección muchas veces presentan trastornos anímicos al no poder llevar una vida plena.<br>  <br>  Parto vaginal.<br>  <br>  Uno de los principales motivos por el cual se debe tratar a las mujeres con HPV es para evitar el contagio al hijo durante el parto.<br>  <br>  Virus HPV no tumorales.<br>  <br>  Los virus HPV no tumorales no están relacionados con el cáncer, entre ellos los más estudiados en el aparato genital son el 6, 11, 42, 43, y 44.<br>  <br>  Los virus HPV no tumorales producen verrugas o lesiones planas y de otras formas que deben ser tratadas ya que son muy contagiosas y antiestéticas.<br>  <br>  En pacientes con defensas bajas, como ser en pacientes HIV positivos, en pacientes que reciben tratamiento oncológico, en pacientes con enfermedades autoinmunes, los virus HPV no tumorales se comportan como tumorales produciendo gran destrucción del tejido infectado tanto en hombres como en mujeres.<br>  <br>  El motivo del tratamiento para los virus HPV no tumorales es para evitar el contagio, para mejorar la estética y la calidad de vida en general.<br>  <br>  Parto vaginal.<br>  <br>  Los virus no tumorales en la mujer también deben ser tratados para evitar el contagio al hijo durante el parto.<br>  <br>  Tratamiento médico del HPV.<br>  <br>  Existen varias sustancias utilizadas para erradicar las lesiones por el virus HPV que se aplican sobre las lesiones causadas por el virus HPV, a lo que se denomina Topicaciones.<br>  <br>  Es una técnica que se practica en consultorio y es muy efectiva para eliminar las verrugas.<br>  <br>  Algunas de estas sustancias utilizadas para las Topicaciones pueden usarse durante el embarazo, y otras no, por eso es importante que el tratamiento se realice por expertos.<br>  Tratamiento quirúrgico del HPV.<br>  Leep para el tratamiento del Virus HPV.<br>  <br>  Consiste en un método que permite extirpar las lesiones producidas por el virus HPV en los genitales femeninos y masculinos por medio de peque?os instrumentos de corte.<br>  <br>  Esta técnica tiene la ventaja de poder realizar cortes muy finos que no dejan lesiones y al mismo tiempo poder controlar cualquier tipo de sangrado.<br>  <br>  Se puede realizar en consultorio o en quirófano con anestesia mínima, pero siempre por cirujanos entrenados.<br>  Láser de CO2 para el tratamiento del virus HPV.<br>  <br>  Consiste en la resección y vaporización de las lesiones causadas por virus HPV utilizando un equipo de láser.<br>  <br>  Posee la ventaja de ser un método muy preciso, pero al vaporizar las lesiones es difícil obtener muestras para patología, recaudo que se debe tomar.<br>  Escisión quirúrgica a bisturí para el tratamiento del virus HPV.<br>  <br>  Consiste en la eliminación de las lesiones causadas por el virus HPV con un peque?o bisturí en quirófano bajo anestesia mínima.<br>  <br>  Es un método tradicional que debe complementarse con un electrocoagulador y a veces puntos de sutura. Se reserva este método para localizaciones específicas.<br>  <br>  Conización para el tratamiento del virus HPV.<br>  <br>  Consiste en la extirpación del interior del cuello uterino en casos de lesiones pre-cancerosas causadas por el virus HPV, eliminando la Zona de Transformación de Epitelios donde se ubica el virus HPV.<br>  <br>  Se realiza en quirófano con la técnica de Leep o con bisturí y anestesia mínima en forma ambulatoria pero siempre por cirujanos entrenados.<br>  Conización preventiva.<br>  <br>  Se indica en mujeres con infecciones persistentes por virus tumorales imposibles de curar con otros métodos, en lesiones pre-cancerosas, en mujeres con HPV tumorales que no tienen posibilidades de controlarse rutinariamente.<br>  <br>  La Conización preventiva generalmente se realiza en mujeres que ya tienen hijos y no desean tener más. <br>  <br>  Otros métodos para el tratamiento del virus HPV (Criocirugía, Endocoagulación).<br>  <br>  Consisten en aplicar frío en el caso de la Criocirugía y calor en el caso de la Endocoagulación sobre el cuello uterino en lesiones causadas por virus HPV, produciendo la destrucción de las mismas.<br>  <br>  Tratamientos combinados para el virus HPV (médicos y quirúrgicos).<br>  <br>  Existen casos en que las lesiones son muy abarcativas y resulta muy agresivo realizar solamente tratamientos médicos que se pueden hacer muy prolongados en el tiempo o tratamientos quirúrgicos que deben realizarse en varias operaciones, lo que también resulta muy agresivo para el paciente.<br>  En estos casos conviene hacer una combinación de tratamientos médicos y quirúrgicos que resultan mas beneficiosos.<br>  <br>  Test de ADN para detección del Virus HPV (PCR y Captura Híbrida).

857c4f3c02a3e9dad636d528ea900863aa	many other cancers have a specific month for awareness. For example September is Childhood Cancer Month and April is National Cancer Control Month. October besides being Breast Cancer Awareness month also has National Mammography Day (Oct. 17) <br>  International Brain Tumor Awareness Week (Oct. 26 - Nov. 1) and you might be more interested in knowing that November is Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Month and Lung Cancer Awareness Month.<br>  For more information about the different months check out the ACS Cancer Awareness Calendar<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cancer.org/docroot/MED/content/MED_1_Cancer_Calendar.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.cancer.org/docroot/MED/conten...</a><br>  |`|HHuwnG7Oaa	That is a very valid point.  I've wondered that myself.  Not that breast cancer isn't bad, but I'd much rather lose a breast than a lung, pancreas, or any other vital organ.  Or better yet, I'd rather lose a breast than straight up die.  |`|rnMRYBEuaa	I agree with you.<br>  My mom is a breast cancer survivor (after a left breast masectomy anyway).<br>  Cancer is all the same though, whether it be breast, lung, brain, etc..<br>  It's name is just given to the location of origin.<br>  |`|FicyC2TXaa	Someone asked a similar question earlier on today; I hope you don't mind if I just copy the answer I gave then, as it answers your question too:<br>  <br>  I can understand why this issue is frustrating for people with other types of cancer and their families, and of course breast cancer support is particularly high profile at the moment because it's October - Breast Cancer Awareness Month.<br>  <br>  I agree that awareness needs to be raised about other cancers too.and while I hate 'competitive illness' I can see why there is resentment about an imbalance in awareness raising and fund raising.<br>  <br>  But bear in mind that breast cancer awareness campaigns and BC Awareness Month started as a campaign by ordinary women, many of them with cancer, to raise awareness so that people knew the symptoms, examined themselves regularly, attended their routine mammograms etc. Enthusiastic participation and hard work by women made it grow into something nationally, then internationally, recognised (and then big business cashed in). Any group of people can start such an awareness campaign for any illness.<br>  <br>  There are other cancer awareness months, ribbons etc; but no cancer campaign has had the sheer hard work put into it that breast cancer awareness has.<br>  <br>  Now I have had breast cancer and I agree that there are extremely irritating things about Breast Cancer Awareness campaigning, especially Pink October as the more cynical of us call it. Support for those with a deadly disease that kills on average 33 women a day in the UK and 112 a day in the US (the only stats I have, I'm not being ethnocentric) has been turned into a marketing opportunity by big business, with around 1% of the cost of specially made pink stuff going to breast cancer charities, the rest into the retailers’ pockets.<br>  <br>  The pink fluffy stuff infuriates me, and I'm not at all 'tickled pink' by Asda's (Walmart's) trivialisation of an illness that may yet kill me. October magazines carry stories from cheerful survivors who claim to have the all-clear (there is no all-clear with breast cancer), and often say bc has changed their lives for the better - very different from anybody I know who's had breast cancer. A Sunday newspaper colour supplement in the UK carried a story yesterday about a woman who said of her breast cancer 'In a weird way, I feel lucky to have had it.'!!!<br>  <br>  And it has negative consequences for breast cancer patients too - I believe that the whole thing is counter-productive, that the marketing and fund-raising hype surrounding breast cancer, by trivialising a deadly disease, is leading people to believe that breast cancer is<br>  <br>  a) not very serious, certainly not as serious as many other cancers (many women with breast cancer have been told - by people who don't have it - that it's a 'good' cancer to get)<br>  <br>  and<br>  <br>  b) curable. (my neighbour said to me 'they've just about got breast cancer licked, haven't they?' Really? Why are they still cutting women's breasts off then?)<br>  <br>  I've even heard it said that it's a ‘fashionable’ or 'sexy' cancer - my sexy prosthesis and sexy scarred, one-breasted body are evidence that it's no such thing.<br>  <br>  Yes, Pink October is awful in some respects and yes other cancers need awareness campaigns (many have them as I’ve said, but they don't receive so much support – or, crucially, have as much work put into them).<br>  <br>  But don't lose sight of the fact that breast cancer is a killer disease with disfiguring surgery, gruelling treatments and so far no cure. Just because aspects of BC awareness trivialise it, doesn't mean it's trivial.|`|SX2Yvyokaa	   No one is stopping activists from other types of cancers in declaring a certain month as pertaining to that cancer.  It's estimated 1 in 9 women (in Canada) will develop breast cancer sometime in their lifetime - that's a lot of people.  And breast cancer can often be caught in the early stages through self-exams - that's why awareness and education are especially important.  It's easier to notice a lump on your boob than a tumor inside your body.  Oh and November is pancreatic cancer month.  <br>     I'm really sorry about your mom - my grandma and aunt both had bowel cancer, and my neighbour had breast cancer.  There are lots of awareness campaigns for other cancers as well as breast cancer, but a lot of people know someone with breast cancer ( as I said, it is very common).  |`|u3ivwarYaa	yes how about colon cancer awareness or esophagus cancer awareness or lung cancer awareness all of which have very poor prognosis'|`|aCDWwsisaa	The only other "pandemic" cancers are lung cancer and colon cancer, and the vast majority of thinking people understand that the risk of these can be virtually eliminated by not smoking (in the case of lung cancer), and not eating a crappy diet (in the case of colon cancer).  <br>  <br>  There is no "obviously irresponsible" activity that the victims of breast cancer engaged in, consequently it has 'bubbled to the top' in terms of public support, and I for one have no problem with that whatsoever...<br>  <br>  My sympathies for your loss.  Was your Mom a smoker or a drinker?  These are both known as causitive contributing factors to pancreatic cancer.|`|224d1d60d1b56362532d0d7f33ab994daa	You're using some funny math there. You use US breast cancer stats and worldwide cancer stats. 7.6 million worldwide cancer deaths, 548000 breast cancer deaths. 12,000,000 worldwide cancer diagnoses, 1.3 million are breast cancer diagnoses.  Worldwide breast cancer is the second most common form of cancer after lung cancer.<br>  <br>  That's why. And because people who cared did the work forming groups and raising awareness and funds. <br>  <br>  Breast cancer awareness is about saving lives. Early diagnosis leads to the best chance of remission.<br>  <br>  Early detection of other cancers such as lung and pancreatic is not generally possible at this point. There are no early low-cost screening tests for early detection.

You might want to get that checked out...|`|HtaNAKZPaa	There are some questions that i have about your particular issue that would need resolving before i can give a definitive answer. <br>  <br>  The questions are how do you treat your diabetes? Are you type 1 or type 2 diabetic? In either case do you use insulin to treat your condition?<br>  <br>  I understand your A1C has been running in the 6's, but how have your day to day or even hourly blood sugar's been running?<br>  <br>  The reason i ask all these questions is if you'll notice when your sugar is really high and you take insulin to correct for this after you take your insulin you will usually have some side effects. Sometime rather unpleasant ones. These can be but are not limited to: Diarrhea/Sudden urge to have a bowel movement. At the time your sugar is high you may be constipated. You may suffer from sever acid reflex, a stiffness in your muscles/joints. You may find yourself unusually moody, etc. etc. etc.<br>  <br>  This can all be cause by your sugar jerking up and down unnaturally. <br>  <br>  What i would suggest is closely monitor your blood sugars. Test every hour on the hour if you have to and write them down. Notate carefully when you happen to be having symptoms and what they are specifically next to your blood sugars, to see if they are related or not.<br>  <br>  Take all your findings into your doctor and have him look at the results. You may be able to adjust your dosages/times to help alleviate any of your symptoms. Also if your doctor isn't one i would strongly recommend seeing an endocrinologist (diabetes specialist) regularly as they have special training and are more likely to be read up on the latest treatment techniques. <br>  <br>  E-mail me if you have any specific questions you need answered or any concerns.
8b605189bffd91d0497498eabf8d3d17aa	I'm sorry to say the answer is no.....<br>  <br>  Unlike type 1 diabetics who produce little or no insulin, type 2 diabetics who make up 90-95%  of the diabetic population for the most part produce an adequate supply of insulin, many times with the help of oral medications to help stimulate the pancreas into producing and releasing more insulin. Type 2's can also use a longer acting insulin to help in controlling their blood sugars.<br>  <br>  The main issue with Type 2's is that they are  to some degree insulin resistant, which means that the insulin their body produces is not making it's way into the cells of the body to release the excess glucose, thus a buildup of glucose occurs and remains in the blood causing blood sugars to elevate to higher than normal levels which over time causes damage to body systems and organs. Which is why many type 2's need to take oral medications to help the cells to become less insulin resistant.<br>  <br>  Since it deals with the cells of the body, surgery would not be an option.|`|ZNbauLJzaa	animal transplants?  where did you hear this?  I've been to many many diabetes education classes and this has never been discussed.  as far as I know animal to human transplants don't happen (with the exception of pig heart valves).<br>  some type 2 people who have bariatric surgery do not suffer from diabetes afterwards.|`|pRF5LLloaa	The only "surgery" available is  a pancreatic transplant.<br>  <br>  Some explanation between Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes might help:<br>  BOTH disease are characterized by an insufficient amount of insulin available in the body to allow sugar to be metabolized. The pancreas is the internal organ that does this.<br>  <br>  In the Type 1 Diabetic, the pancreas fails outright.  Without additional insulin shots, the patient will die.  Since sugar cannot get from the blood to the cells where it is needed, the patient literally starves to death.  Since this most often happens in children, this is often called Juvenile Diabetes.<br>  <br>  In Type 2 Diabetes, the pancreas wears out slowly over time.  BUT, the pancreas often remains working to some extent.  When caught early, the patient can often treat the disease through dietary and lifestyle changes.  This reduces the load on the pancreas, and allow it to function sufficiently.<br>  <br>  Since this most often happens on older adults who have experiencedthe mid-l;ife weight gain, this is called Adult Onset Diabetes.<br>  <br>  But if the disease is allowed to  run for several years before the patient asks for treatment, the pancreas is often damaged. There are some oral drugs that will cause the pancreas to produce more insulin, and others that cause the body to bettter use the insulin.  These patients can often control the disease with a combination of lifestyle changes and oral medication.<br>  <br>  But eventually, most Type 2 Diabetics find that their pancreas eventually fails completely, and the sad fact is that most Type 2 diabetics eventully  progress into complete pancreatic failure -- Type 1 Diabetes, which requires a daily regimen of shots.<br>  <br>  Once the pancreas fails, the ONLY surgery available is to replace the pancreas through an organ transplant.  This often works in children, becaue they have not yet damaged their other internal organs.<br>  <br>  But many Type 2 Diabetics have let the disease progress too far, through poor lifestyle management, and their other internal organs are also damaged.  In this case many doctors consider thiese patients to be poor risks for a pancreatic transplant<br>  <br>  The animal cell transplant is a technique that has not proven efficient, and is not commonly practiced any more.<br>  <br>  T-Cell transplant has so far shown some success in mice, but it is many years of reasearch and approval testing before such a procedure is avaialbl to humans.<br>  |`|LOB7aWv7aa	I have type two diabetes and is controlled by diet,for two years I have given up all sweets, cakes, curries, chinese, etc,etc, tho from time to time I am allowed a treat,it has been hard for me to do this as I am not a spring chicken any more,yet I still go hill walking and other outdoor activities,exercise and losing weight is the secret to keeping blood sugar levels ok, tho as I get older I will probably need medication,so far I have not heard of any type of surgery for type 2 diabetes so I will keep going the way I am.<br>               C.K.|`|24414fcc91f5304cd67eb4e1e5e9e3d2aa	I don't think so, but I know one thing: I would take injections over surgery any day!|`|BJjxr71zaa	I do not think so

La psoriasi compare in situazioni di stress, più frequentemente in soggetti predisposti, in base anche ad un carattere ereditario della patologia. La psoriasi si manifesta a causa di un'eccessiva quantità di tossine nel nostro organismo, tossine che possono derivare da cattiva alimentazione, dall' aria che respiriamo, dall' assunzione di alcolici o dai pensieri e dallo stress che oramai caratterizzano la nostra vita quotidiana.<br>  <br>  In presenza di presunta psoriasi alla pelle è sempre consigliabile consultare il medico che prescriverà dei farmaci.

XCD6f5hqaa	Sure thing.  You don't have to be obese to have diabetes, though at least 80% of Type-II Diabetes Mellitus is in obese patients.  Type-I diabetes begins in childhood, so you prolly don't have that.<br>  <br>  There's simple blood tests to find out (glucometer or Chem-7), so go to the doctor if you're concerned.<br>  <br>  Your likelihood of diabetes is higher if your parents or siblings have it.|`|24414fcc91f5304cd67eb4e1e5e9e3d2aa	Yes, you can. You do not have to be overweight to get diabetes!<br>  <br>  See, there are two types of diabetes, Type 1 and Type 2. Although they are both forms of diabetes, they are totally different diseases. Only 5-10% of all diabetics have Type 1.<br>  <br>  Type 1 is an auto-immune disease that usually occurs in childhood or under the age of 20, but not always, which is why it's sometimes also called Juvenile Diabetes. It is not caused by eating too much junk food, sugar, or living a poor lifestyle. There is nothing you can do to prevent type 1 diabetes and there is currently no cure, although scientists say they are close.<br>  <br>  Type 2 usually developes in adulthood and can develope slowly over a period of time. Obesity, poor diet and lifestyle can contribute to this type of diabetes, but this is not always the case. Type 2 diabetes can be prevented, or that's what some people say. Other people disagree with that statement. <br>  <br>  Here are some of the symptoms of Type 1 Diabetes. Some of them might apply to Type 2, but I'm not sure:<br>  <br>  *Increased thirst<br>  *Frequent Urination<br>  *Increased appetite<br>  *Drowsiness, Lethargy<br>  *Sudden Weight loss<br>  *Sugar in urine<br>  *Sudden vision changes<br>  *Heavy, labored breathing<br>  *Stupor, Unconsciousness<br>  *Fruity, sweet, or wine - like odor on breath<br>  *And sometimes upset stomach and vomiting<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  |`|2TvwXPPBaa	Type 2 diabetes, the "adult" kind, which you are probably talking about, is getting more and more common in young people and semi-overweight people who are not even close to obese.  When I worked in a diabetes clinic, I was amazed that there were 15 year olds who were only 20 pounds overweight that had type 2 diabetes.|`|a2b6bbf20ed15aee9b6c632d270d5174aa	Yes, especially if you have a family history of diabetes. Frequent urination, excessive thirst, dry mouth, blurred vision are signs of diabetes.

Hair grows out of that hair folicle.

24414fcc91f5304cd67eb4e1e5e9e3d2aa	I almost always bolus before I eat, with a few exceptions... <br>  <br>  Say you're eating a food that you really like, but there is a lot of it on your plate, you can do what is called Bite-Bolusing; This is where you can bolus for half of the meal and then eat that half, and if you're still hungry then you can bolus for and eat the other half.<br>  <br>  And then, if I'm eating something that's really high in fat (like pizza or something) I usually bolus AFTER I eat. This reason for this is when you eat food with a high fat content, it take longer for ther carbs to absorb in your blood stream; so if you bolus before you eat it, you'll most probably have high BG because after you've already used up your bolus insulin, your body is still absorbing the carbs... I'm not sure how well (or horrible) I explained that... lol sorry.|`|Dx6dsQx1aa	The new aspart insulins are faster acting than the old Regular insulin, so you can give it immediately following a meal and you'll be fine.  However, be careful when you're having a social meal where you get talking and it takes longer to eat.  By the time you've finished your meal, it can be 45 minutes or more later!  So in that situation, try to bolus as soon as your food arrives and you have a chance to evaluate the carb in it.|`|AA10390481	You should try to do it before, because the food will hit your blood stream faster than the insulin the majority of the time.  Matter of fact, my endo asked me to do insulin about 10 mins before I eat.|`|EQfhJaKFaa	My 6 year old son has Type 1 diabetes (since he was 3).  3 year olds can be picky eaters so when he was smaller I couldn't really dose him until he finished eating.

pPtGegnEaa	I had a birthmark removed with laser, but it left a permanent pink discoloration and I always have to be careful that the area isn't exposed to sun because you end up more likely to get skin cancer.
24414fcc91f5304cd67eb4e1e5e9e3d2aa	Most people with Type 1 can eat basically whatever they want, as they're insulin dependent. All they have to do is count, measure, or weigh the amount of carbohydrates that they're eating and cover that with a bolus of fast-acting insulin (Novolog, Humalog, Apidra, etc.) via syringe or insulin pump.<br>  <br>  There are however some exceptions, such as the Type 1s who only take a slow-acting (basal) insulin such as Lantus or Levimir, and no rapid-acting insulin. These people can only eat so many carbs at a time (i.e. 45-60 grams per meal), and there are certain foods that they really shouldn't eat because different foods do different things to your blood sugar (When I was only on Lantus and nothing else, I couldn't have pizza at all because it would spike my blood sugar horribly and I'd be in the 300s for hours).<br>  <br>  But just remember this: YDMV, or Your Diabetes May Very.|`|ZNbauLJzaa	The texture of food doesn't matter, nor does the clarity.  Diabetics are not sick people and what you are describing is what sick people might need.<br>  A person with diabetes must be mindful of the amount of carbohydrates they eat and compensate with the appropriate amount of insulin (which varies from person to person).|`|hqFTWFc9aa	There is no such thing as a diabetic diet. In fact, the diet for most people with diabetes is the same as the diet for people without diabetes. If you have diabetes, you do not have to buy foods speci?cally marketed to people with diabetes (for example, cookies, jams, and candy for people with diabetes, labeled as sugar-free).<br>  <br>  People with diabetes had to restrict carbohydrates and spread them throughout the day by eating three meals and three snacks. With the use of the new insulins analogs and blood glucose monitoring systems, the dietary restrictions are much less of a prob-lem, but there are still some limitations.|`|crYsWgaZaa	Well my brother is diabetic for a year now and he has some schedule of eating like how many things he could eat per a meal. He eats 6 times in a day ( 3 main meals and 3 times when he eats fruit or diet products). So he can eat everything but not when he wants, he eats when is time for his meal. And everything depend from that how many calories he is allowed to eat ( that is predicted from the age and the weight and the amount of insulin that he is taking) <br>  As I said he eats everything including stuff with sugar but he eats stuff with sugar when he is on swimming pool or sometimes before bed time because he sometimes gets hypoglycemia |`|Z2PJBrZSaa	Diabetes brings with it lots of food restriction, so one has to change his/her food habits to high fibre, low calories and to foods that are low in fat. Breakfast- fruits like apple, tea without sugar, cereals or whole wheat foods.<br>  Lunch- salads, vegetables like kidney beans,peas etc, soya bread, yogurt, avoid potatoes.<br>  Dinner- vegetable soups or chicken.<br>  You must do exercise regularly and eat a balance diet. Avoid white rice, potatoes, carrots, breads and banana -- they increase the blood-sugar levels.  Sugar, salt, high fat cheese, fried foods, red meat, eggs.

There is no such thing as foods that should be considered "off limits", but just like everyone else, they should be considered occational foods (ie, sweets, candy, pies, soda, ect.)  You should see either a nurse educator or a nutrionist, they can help you learn how to count carbs, which is EXTREMELY important for Type 1 diabetics.  They will also help you learn to keep your diet balanced, too often our diets in general are garbage and we just think eating health tastes awful.  Find old favorites (like pizza) and find new way to make them healthy (thin crust vs. thick, try chicken instead of pepperoni).<br>  <br>  Here's the most important tips I have found useful: see your doctor regularly, test your BG often, eat healthy, get a good nights rest, and remember food is not the enemy.<br>  <br>  Good luck

b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	Wow.  Between being diabetic and having a blood clotting disorder, you have your hands full.  The way I understand it, when using the Mirena IUD, very little blood goes into the uterus to build up a lining.  With your clotting problem, that blood is never going to clot and build up to come out once a month.  It is simply leaking out as it enters the uterus.  On birth control pills, the blood still enters the uterus and builds up, just comes out as a period every month.  That is why you had lots of bleeding on them, as compares to the Mirena.<br>  <br>  Unless you can get the clotting disorder under control so the blood clots, I think you will continue to have the blood leak out as soon as it enters the uterus.<br>  <br>  No, it wouldn't be normal for people without your problems, but for you this might be as good as it gets.<br>  <br>  Remember, this is not a professional opinion, and  you should never substitute the answers you get here for the ones from your doctors.|`|OXmn9pe9aa	Tell your doctor you want Loestrin fe 24 and take the active pills only.

It'll stick to your ribs longer than the Mini wheats will.  |`|341905b0e67edda5f8bd9a7966c7410caa	Go for the oatmeal. It has less sugar. Sugar has a tendency to make you hungrier shortly after consumption. |`|KsSYsjziaa	How much fiber do they have? I would say the oatmeal would be healthier though.  Less sugar.|`|yWpwUNANaa	Oatmeal..|`|Wf16NOfTaa	Oatmeal.<br>  <br>  And skip the bull**** flavor packets too.|`|WPipgT9vaa	frosted shredded mini wheat|`|WLl7Kht2aa	I would go with oatmeal.

3sIoLMsVaa	I got 4 wisdom teeth pulled out at once. My one tooth was slightly laying sideways. They had to cut a star shape in order to pull it out. It was not painful until the next day. This was mainly because I did not take the pain pills. They made me ill. Other than that I was thankful to have them pulled out. Don't be scared! |`|DLpc8J3aaa	Woke up at home.  Don't remember a thing.  Used tylenol and ibuprofen for a couple of days.|`|zerhyz1zaa	They knocked me out so I felt nothing. And the healing process was easy too|`|BttalmMqaa	Good luck<br>  |`|WKdRhHMlaa	When I got my wisdom teeth out they were impacted (or as you said "under the gum") so mine was an "invasive" procedure, and I got put to sleep so If that is what they're planning for you then you will feel nothing.  <br>  <br>  When I woke up however I was a little uncomfortable, and if that were to happen to you the doctor will give you some sort of pain-reliever so you should be fine.<br>  <br>  For the first few days it was no solids but that was only so I wouldn't tear the stitches, then after that I was eating normally.<br>  <br>  The only thing that was really bad was the swelling and bruising around my jaw bone, other than that it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.  <br>  <br>  Hope all goes well! |`|0itSQ7iTaa	It really is different for everyone. For me it wasn't that bad. I was awake and watched the whole procedure being done via a mirror. Very interesting. But that's my profession. I wouldn't suggest you be awake. It's really not that bad. Like I said everyone is different. Some swell some don't. Some say it hurt, some say they didn't feel a thing. Your jaw may be a little sore from being open. The main thing is follow all the post operative instructions to avoid dry socket. You really have to experience it for yourself. Good luck everything will be just fine. Think how blessed you are to only have 2 and not 4!!|`|cK8H1fcxaa	I had 4 impacted wisdom teeth taken out. I was completely knocked out for the procedure but I was given percocet for home.  After 24 hours I didn't need any pain meds at all.  My mouth was a little sore and I did not eat solids for a days, but it really was not bad! You will need 1-2 days set aside to just sit/sleep on the couch- especially if you are being knocked out for the surgery! Hope that helps.  Heads up, it's not too bad!|`|8AFQdplHaa	im getting this done in a few weeks as well i have talked to several different people about the procedure and all but one has said that it really  wasnt a big deal. of course im still scared but there is medicine that you can take to ease the pain . most of the time they give you vicodin or tylenol with codene. but i am chosing to be sedated and if you are alreasy nervous i reccomend that you do this as well.. hope all goes well, and good luck!|`|5GNtqGySaa	I got all of mine taken out when I was 15 because they were growing in sideways. They knocked me out and when I woke up I was laying in a bed in a 'recovery room'. I was so woozy that I could hardly walk to the car. My mouth was full of gauze (which was quite bloody) and had to be changed a few times a day. Also there were noticeable stitches in place as well.  I couldn't eat anything for a long while and actually lost 10 lbs! Even when the pain was completely gone I still couldn't open my mouth wide (like yawning) for a long time after that. It sounds rough but don't worry you'll be fine!|`|tNUgc5hYaa	i was asleep with i had 4 teeth taken out and when i woke up it hurt and i couldn't eat anything like all day. the pain isn't so bad just make sure you take the pain killers. don't eat anything that will get stuck in the holes and you will be fine. follow the instructions that give you because you be sorry you didn't lol. your holes with feel gross for a while and your mouth will have an iron taste for days|`|hoVV4AJDaa	The dentist told me I was associating the pressure with pain. You feels a great amount of pressure as they pull them out. After words you're nice and numb and swollen, so you won't feel anything for a few hours, but once you feel...omg. Well, for me I couldn't open my mouth, talk, eat, for a week. I was in pain. I hated it. Drug yourself up nice and good. lol I didn't. That's where I went wrong.<br>  Good luck!|`|3ASeqT70aa	same thing happened to me..<br>  <br>  idk cuz everytime i woke up i took a pain killer<br>  <br>  cant eat nothing hard or chewy.. just soup<br>  <br>  and no smoking or sucking|`|PXFf2DlSaa	if u have the choice have them put u to sleep thats better and if they arent in a weird spot thats good too, if they dont cut them out thats good also<br>  <br>  <br>  Drinking with straws or smoking any type of suction is a big no no!!<br>  <br>  make sure u dont eat b4 u go in there too and have someonedrive u to the dentist..trust me they pulled mine out  a couple weeks a go and it sucks.. |`|Z3RFbUrDaa	well, i had all of mine out in the summertime, and i was worried, but you shouldn't be scared...even if you're not :P but it wasn't as bad as i thought it would be. just afterwards my mouth felt a bit weird, and i couldn't really open it far, but they give you medicine for it. :)<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|9HrA1R4gaa	it feels like something is missing for the first days then u will get used to it ...<br>  i rmember when i was at ur age my classmates were making fun of me by saying my cleverance would be 2 points less.|`|ksQ3LQkHaa	They might knock you out, might not. Be warned, YOU WILL DROOL! On everything! The pain goes away quickly, the best thing you can do is not stress over it.|`|ua1s6sVlaa	like a small angry man is eating the skin around your face |`|p9CNjIDUaa	umm idk my teacher got that and she didn't come to school for few days after...|`|krnrjNfmaa	You would probably not feel  a thing since they might put you to sleep.  <br>  <br>  My son had this procedure done a year ago ( he is 18) and he does not even remember when I put him back in the car!<br>  <br>  From what he said your gums might hurt some for a couple of days, and be sensitive for a week, but that is it.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|c3DqvgE4aa	Its very very painful
vOE6bCsLaa	You dont sound too bad.  Just be careful not to lose any weight.  I wish i could be as health conscious as you.  Im not over weight but im definately not carefull about what i eat.  I work out at my gym 2-3 times a week though.  <br>  I think your fine though. Its good to stay healthy and you seem pretty healthy to me. Just dont lose any weight, then i might get a little concerned, like if u get under 105 pounds.|`|PIG9DzYVaa	We have seen your nude photos in your computer hard drive and you are alright.|`|ZctVkLLgaa	you don't sound too bad but i think you should discuss this with your doctor and maybe try to gain about 5 pounds.|`|1eUe9BkOaa	i think your a lil obsessive<br>  <br>  <br>  not too bad<br>  <br>  yet...<br>  <br>  try to ease up on some of your 'routine', its not very healthy 'specialy if youve ben doing it ur life|`|VSFvJ3praa	Eat healthy. You're slim, but trying to gain weight without consulting your doctor is a bad idea. Try not to obsess over how you look- it can make you very unhappy.<br>  And hon- at 13, I highly doubt you are through puberty. The vast majority of people keep developing up through age 17. I went up  two cup sizes at 15, started periods at 11. I'm still not fully through puberty.<br>  You NEED body fat to live. It's unhealthy not to have it. Not like rolls of it- that's bad- but if you're skin and bone, you can be susceptible for broken bones, nasty bruises, and worse.

txTByaIkaa	The first time it probably will...hope it doesnt scare u :) but the best thing is to be ready and feeling good enough that when he does try to put it in it wont feel like it hurts as much but more pleasurable. Also finger action will loosen you up before. At first going in and out will be a lilttle akward and painfull but itll get better. if it continues to hurt maybe stop and try later when your up to it. It might also take a while b4 it gets fully in, so make sure he takes his time! dnt force-ease it in. my first time hurted as well as the 2nd and 3rd but if your ready and willing itll get better i promise. jst dont rush- you have all the time in the world! hope this helps!|`|IpWTMetHaa	It will hurt so good.  :)|`|oLTUn51Uaa	prolly, wait til it happens to really find out|`|8lxHmIlyaa	probably.<br>  it's "tough love". <br>  =D|`|AsttrwODaa	yes but its feels the best first time.

But most of all, do not blame yourself, their issues have nothing to do with you, and it is something that they have to work out. Please be careful not to get caught up, when I was in your position I let it get to me and became a self harmer. Best of luck|`|mZdInpZWaa	I'm in that same position right now, many of my friends are self-harmers and are on the verge of suicide. It scares the crap out of me, but I just have to help them. I told the school guidance counselor what was going on and what to say to the person, because they refuse help of any sort. What they really want when they're feeling this way is a friend to listen. Talking is therapeutic to some people and they just need to vent sometimes. But if you really do think they're in danger of ham ring themselves in any way, you need to tell an adult ASAP or else something horrible could happen. There's a fine line between friendship and safety, and sometimes you'll have to cross that line to make sure everybody is okay.|`|Eax8ERX3aa	maybe try talking to them if you are close with them. tell them you are there and you'll listen and stuff. it helps a little bit. sorry i cant be more help
mdoClD8Haa	If its her first time there about this problem chances are the doctors will have a quick listen to her thoughts and give her a chance to say what she wants. If she wants medication. they wont give it to her They will try to convince her over and over to go to a psychologist because there aint no 'miracle/happy pill'.If your friend still refuses theyll then ask her to talk to her mother/father/ etc. If she still refuses i suggest she tells her parents or big sibling and try again a few weeks or months later at the doctors with the informed adult with them. Im still suicidal and depressed so if you or your friend wanna talk or ask stuff just add me on tis_georgiie@hotmail.co.uk|`|KHSp98gsaa	get her a good one who doesn't prescribe medication!!<br>  I was seriously depressed and suicidal, trust me, medication makes it worse. Give her friendship, love, and support from you, from her loved ones!!

Pablo Rojano Cabrera, fundador y director de la empresa IDEA BIOQUIMICA, (empresa impulsada por la Incubadora de Empresas con Base Tecnológica del IPN).<br>  <br>  Es el primer germicida de origen 100% natural que reúne cuatro cualidades únicas medicamente.<br>  <br>  1.- Realmente es de amplio espectro: ya que elimina virus, hongos y bacterias. Esto lo hace especialmente valioso porque es un solo producto para combatir infinidad de enfermedades.<br>  <br>  2.- Evita la resistencia microbiana, esto se logra matando el núcleo del virus o bacteria sin dar tiempo a la reacción. Esto quiere decir que lo puedes ingerir durante todo el tiempo que sea necesario o las veces que sea necesario. además Germisol no irrita membranas ni mucosas.<br>  <br>  3.- No es toxico. La toxicidad como tal no existe en el Germisol, luego entonces puede aplicarse o ingerirse por cualquier persona en cualquier condición de salud y de edad, sin que haya molestias o reacciones secundarias.<br>  <br>  4.- No mata glóbulos rojos ni blancos al usarse, aún en periodos prolongados.<br>  <br>  Finalmente es una maravillosa opción para todas aquellas personas que: no pueden tomar antibióticos; que tienen enfermedades supuestamente incurables (herpes, VPH e incluso artritis reumatoide, por ejemplo, al eliminar el estafilococo dorado que la ocasiona); que están cansadas de gastar si resultados; que van a ser o fueron sometidas a cirugía, ya que Germisol desinfecta, coagula y cicatriza de adentro hacia afuera y a niver local. Germisol está siendo utilizado exitósamente en Centro Médico s: XXI, Hospital Militar y la UAM-Xochimilco.<br>  <br>  El centro de Distribución está en Casa Ketzalkoatl, Sarto No. 23 y Sarto 29-302, Col. Mixcoac, Del. Benito Juárez.<br>  tel: 56-11-23-08 / 55-55-06-26-20 . También enviamos el producto al interior de la república a través de MEXPOST.<br>  <br>  Por último, el I.B.Q.

Iu1obWb9aa	Depending on how long ago you pierced it, see a DR or go to an ER.  Uncontrollable bleeding is bad...<br>  <br>  Remove any piercings and hold a gauze pad or other clean absorbent bandage against the ear (Firm pressure will help control bleeding).  Hydrogen peroxide & Neospoirn are designed to clean/kill bacteria (not stop bleeding).  <br>  <br>  Be sure to let a parent know what happened if you are still under their guardianship.  Its better to be grounded than lose part of an ear to a nasty infection.|`|DKPhYy39aa	use alcohol and go to the doctor|`|SnTuaKcJaa	TAKE THEM OUT! NOW! You are not supposed to pierce them with a gun. Also, hydrogen peroxide and neosporin is making them worse. TAKE THEM OUT! Also, DO NOT use alcohol on them! It makes it worse.

Get to a clinic quickly and see if they can treat the problem on site.  If you are idiot enough to get five piercings prior to this, you just happened to luck out. Perhaps you will learn a lesson.

When you pierce your ears it should be done with hypoallergenic studs not some hoops! It sounds badly infected and if i were you i would go to a doctor because you probably need antibiotics. This could be something minor or possibly something major. You dont want an infection to get into your blood stream and possibly become septic. Take the hoop out because it is a foreign object in your body that the body is trying to reject. Thats why it is soo swollen and bleeding.Also you dont want it to become necrotic and for a part of your ear to fall off! SEE A PHYSICIAN ASAP.|`|a6x95c3Vaa	If you're using a gun, ears should NEVER be pierced with a hoop, only a stud. Immediately remove the earring, yes it will be painful but it has to heal.

You might also want to go see a doctor.|`|AA11627844	you should never ever let friends do piercings for you. its dangerous.<br>  and you should never have them done with a gun because those cause the most problems and can damage nerves and veins in the ear.<br>  if its been awhile and it still isnt stopping bleeding then take out the earring and put some gauze or a small cloth on it and put pressure on it.<br>  if its as bad as you say it is then maybe you need to get to the hospital.|`|GemPuPFJaa	go to a doctor and just so you know the more piercings you have the more likely you are to have one become infected but you need to take that earring out try icing it so it will be numb and maybe you wont feel the pain as much|`|EyYICgaXaa	take the earring out first off. secondly (this will hurt )  put rubbing alcohol on it. let it heal (watch for infection) then go and get it done professionally.<br>  |`|z6paOEkiaa	Prob infected|`|pkDSL0mjaa	infected!|`|hAFmWIBTaa	You should definitely go see a doctor or it will get worst.|`|fgMuutRAaa	do not try hydrogen, peroxide or neospoirn anymore they will not help.<br>  Usually it should not bleed, but i recommend you got to the doctor and ask for help.

xvey8ixPaa	Well, sort of. One is american and the other I think is Canadian, but most safety eyewear I encounter is ok for both in an industrial setting, but not for sports. I think that the sports ratings actually are governed by the sports associations individually. You should find out what regs you need to follow and follow those for your specific use.

u9mE35o5aa	Go to the dentist.  If there is a crack, it's important to identify it BEFORE you start getting food stuck in there and it turns into something super-nasty.<br>  <br>  Will it tighten?  Yeah.  I'll tell you a freaky story the dentist I work for told me.  This kid got one of his two front teeth knocked out in a baseball game mishap.  Doc picked up the tooth and shoved it back into the kids mouth!!  It works... somehow.  The gums heal back around the tooth.  And makes a great, freaky story.<br>  <br>  But, really... check on the crack.
u9mE35o5aa	If you've caused damage, it will not heal itself.  It will create an opening for further damage.

Gana peso con facilidad y tiene dificultades para perderlo. Tiende a almacenar grasa, pero puede albergar una mayor masa muscular, porque sus funciones metabólicas le permiten mantener ese peso. <br>  Ectomorfos son los ultraligeros, que no son capaces de conservar un gramo de peso y le cuesta mucho ganarlo. <br>  El mesomorfo es el tipo somático ideal, característico de los atletas capaces de destacar en cualquier deporte y, en general, escasos. <br>  <br>  Rara vez un individuo pertenece a un tipo somático único, con excepción de los obesos mórbidos (endomorfos puros) o los delgados extremos (ectomorfos puros). Normalmente, una persona con un peso normal es una combinación de endomorfo y ectomorfo y de ectomorfo y mesomorfo. <br>  <br>  El entrenamiento y la dieta deben ser distintos para las personas de tipo somático puro o combinado. <br>  <br>  Los mesomorfos pueden tomar en buena proporción carbohidratos, proteínas y grasas y obtienen buenos resultados con cualquier tipo de ejercicio. <br>  <br>  El endomorfo se pesa después de haber ingerido una ensalada y ve como ha engordado medio kilo. Su metabolismo es lento, puede desarrollar masa muscular con rapidez y su músculo es denso pero con un porcentaje muy alto de grasa. Le cuesta perder grasa y si la pierda también pierde músculo. <br>  <br>  El ectoformo no suele conservar el peso que consigue, quema calorías con rapidez y parece que nunca come lo suficiente. <br>  <br>  Los endomesomorfos (medio atléticos, medio gordos) ganan masa muscular con rapidez. Se les suele recomendar un entrenamiento rápido y bastante intenso. Suelen retener líquido y, en consecuencia, tienen que reducir el consumo de carbohidratos e incrementar el de féculas, fibras y hortalizas. El resto de la alimentación debe incluir proteínas saludables. <br>  <br>  A los ecto-mesomorfos les resulta difícil ganar músculo pero siempre tienen un aspecto definido. Deben entrenarse con bastante peso y descansar bastante, espaciando las sesiones de entrenamiento. <br>  <br>  <br>  2 segundo  una vez identificado tu tipo de cuerpo . te recomiendo leer   ¨De flaco a musculoso¨. que es un libro para principiantes (osea que te explica todo y  no da supuestos)  y te va a  ayudar aumentar masa muscular. sin secretos , ni pastillas ni cosas raras.<br>  <br>  espero que te halla servido|`|yYDZAdTJaa	lo que te recomiendo son suplementos y ejercicio para engrosar tu cuerpo, en pocas palabras ve a un gimnasio, en ellos hay instructores que te podran ayudar y ademas de nutriologos, suerte!|`|yg9b98mWaa	ESTIRANDOTE  A LUGARES Q NO PUEDES ALCANSAR   A COMER COSAS Q T NUTRAN|`|Q6OTjj8kaa	gimansio y dieta saludable????|`|RUHc2y7Caa	No se entiende tu pregunta, pero pues te respondo lo que creo.<br>  <br>  Si quieres incrementar tus musculos, verlos mas anchos, entonces haz ejercicio con peso, haces pocas repeticiones.

IKe1teMzaa	Actually, depending on your state, you may not have many options. <br>  I live in NY and from what I understand they do not recognize or allow blood for female hormone testing. <br>  I just got what's called a Peri-panel collection kit. <br>  It's a saliva test kit. I collect my spit, quite a bit at atime, in little plastic containers on day 5, 12,15,20, and 26 of my cycle. First day of my period being day 1, of course. <br>  I mail it off to a lab and they test. <br>  It is 300 bucks. <br>  It tests estrogen, testosterone and progesterone. <br>  <br>  I guess the results are reliable...? who knows anymore. <br>  <br>  But, some friendly cautionary advise......don't do any hormone replacement with synthetic pharmaceuticals. <br>  We have options now. There is bioidentical and therefore sooo much safer. <br>  But testing and replacing is very important. Regular western docs are so NOT knowledgable on the subject, believe it or not. <br>  Go to the website link below and look up your state for a great cutting edge doc who knows alot about them. <br>  <br>  My kit is from my doc (holistic MD) and it's called Aeron - Life cycles clinical laboratory.

Or, you can always ask her to take you to a doctor. Stay away from Drs. who think everything can be solved about periods with birth conrol pills. You're still a little young to rely on that. Trust me. If you are sexually active, I do recommend you go to a Dr. to check your health, and to answer any questions you may have about sex and your period.

I say this from experience as I have done both.  Now to give you an idea of how serious P90X is, I learned the hard way that I was not ready for P90X.  I was unable to complete the third phase, because I just was not in good enough shape to start it.<br>  <br>  Now, yes you can get a good work out by using the bands and the door attachment.

Type 1 is an autoimmune disease, in which the immune system attacks the insulin-producing Beta Cells in the Pancreas. There is no cure for type 1, and you can't prevent it. Most people lose a lot (some just a little, some not any) of weight before being diagnosed with Type 1, because when the Pancrease doesn't produce insulin, glucose can't be turned into energy, and your body doesn't recieve the nutrients it needs, so the body thinks it's starving, and therefore goes into starvation mode, which causes people to lose weight.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|1D8tMCYIaa	Depends on which type of diabetes you have. Usually type 1 diabetes mellitus causes rapid weight loss. My fiance was 250 lbs when he started getting the symptoms of diabetes and a year later he was 190 lbs. This is because in type 1 no insulin is being produced in the body and there for all glucose comes out in the urine and doesn't get stored in the body. When someone goes undiagnosed for a long time like my fiance, all that fat content gets used up when the blood sugar is not under control.<br>  <br>  As for type 2 diabetes, some insulin is still being produced in which fat is still being allowed to be stored.|`|dsoN738oaa	People don't necessarily have to be fat to be diabetes but due to today's diets and lack of exercise many type 2 diabetics are, but not all. Yes people do tend to loose weight when they are diabetics as the body and kidneys cannot cope with all the excess sugar in the blood than has not been used for energy and so flushed it out in urine. This could meant though that people can go from fat to slimmer or people with type 1 diabetes can become extremely thin. it a common mistake to place All diabetic folk as fat, a mistake that just needs to be corrected. :) Hope this helps xx|`|Z2PJBrZSaa	 Diabetes is a deadly disease that should be avoided at all cost.

I got it when I was 13 I'm now 25 and I'm the only one in my family who has it and I used to be pretty much anorexic. Diabetes is just when your pancreas stops producing the insulin, If you start becoming really lethargic and find you drink a lot and go to the toilet a lot and are becoming weak, then your chances are high especially if it runs in the family. <br>  Ask you gran to check your sugar level, it cant hurt, if its high I suggest going to the docs.<br>  Hope this helps.|`|FjiRPKp2aa	The quickest way to find out is use your grandmas glucometer if it reads high you need to see a physician if not going to a doc is still a good idea|`|1D8tMCYIaa	Well, there are factors that contribute to the risks.

You can also feel dizzy, lose weight or have blurry vision and more. However, some people never have any of these symptoms beyond the thirst and urge to pee. If you have any of these symptoms, you should tell your parents and get to the doctor. Diabetes is a serious condition, but it can be controlled.<br>  <br>  There is Type 1, which is an auto-immune disease. It used to be called "juvenile diabetes," because only children got it. That is no longer the case. Many adults get Type 1 Diabetes, myself included. There is also Type 2, which is usually caused by obesity and a family history of Diabetes. It used to called "adult-onset" diabetes because only adults got it. That is no longer the case. Obesity among children has become an epidemic, which has increased the number of cases of Type 2 Diabetes in children.<br>  <br>  It is easy to find out if you have Diabetes. There is a blood test called a hemoglobin A1c test. It measures how your glucose (sugar) levels have been doing for the past 3 months. If the result is over 6%, you do have Diabetes; if it is under 6%, then you do not. Very simple.<br>  <br>  There is also another test. You fast from midnight before your doctor visit. When you get there, they will draw your blood to check your glucose level. Then they will give you a very sweet syrup to drink (just a small amount). Then, after an hour, they will draw your blood again. They will do that after 2 hours and after 3 hours. This will show them how your body processes the sugar and will determine if you have Diabetes. Some doctors who do this test also want to do the A1c test, since that test is the most definitive.<br>  <br>  Here are a few web sites that can give you more information about Diabetes:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dlife.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.dlife.com</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.revolutionhealth.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.revolutionhealth.com</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.americandiabetesassociation.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.americandiabetesassociation.c...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.yourtotalhealth.ivillage.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.yourtotalhealth.ivillage.com</a><br>  <br>  I hope this has been helpful to you.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck/|`|N5VyF5UEaa	Well, I am 14 now and I was diagnosed with Diabetes when I was only 10. <br>  <br>  My very close family had no history of diabetes, besides my Mom's Great Aunt...<br>  <br>  If you are very thirsty, frequent urination, or blurred vision, I would go see my doctor.

UeCnigZ7aa	You can use the control solution to test and if the reading is within normal range then it will give you an accurate reading. <br>  <br>  Also, if the strips are expired, the reading will not be accurate.<br>  |`|8b605189bffd91d0497498eabf8d3d17aa	Meters that are old or damaged will do that......and need to be replaced.<br>  <br>  I don't know of any manufacturer that wouldn't replace that meter.<br>  <br>  They can only be off by up to 20%  either up or down as per the FDA, so no manufacturer  will refuse to replace it.<br>  <br>  The bottom line is that the manufacturers make their money off the strips for any particular meter. I also wouldn't keep a meter longer than a year or two, they are known to become less proficient over time.<br>  <br>  So you need to call the manufacturer for a replacement, they won't say no once they hear that there was that much difference within a few seconds, they don't want to lose your business.|`|e241bb5ca60328ab4d08ef938b8dfe20aa	Could be that you had something sugary on your finger.

So I coded the meter to the strips, checked, and was rewarded with at (correct) BG reading of 123.|`|AA10322961	Oh yes.  I use the calibration mixture and then re check.  I've had it go from 440 to 120 in the matter of 2 tests in about 5 minutes.

That just can not be easy to deal with at all.<br>  <br>  My blood sugars get higher when I'm really stressed out to. If you're on insulin, I'd up your basal rate a little bit until your sugars start coming down. Like up it one unit and then another in about 4 days if it doesn't work the first time. But be sure to call your doctor and ask him about it first! <br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|AA10322961	My condolences on the loss of your brother.<br>  <br>  Yes, stress can raise your blood sugar levels. Check your sugar more often and adjust your insulin as needed.  High levels for a short period of time shouldn't be a major problem, but long term, it could be.  If you're having difficulty managing your blood sugar, call your doctor to get some guidance.<br>  <br>  Good luck

nPZiu7ksaa	You don’t need to starve yourself, nor do you need to start a crazy diet to look good in your new swimsuit. Summer weight loss can be best achieved through consuming fewer calories than you burn, and by choosing healthier foods to eat. It’s easier to make better food choices in the summer – heavier food choices and meals full of calories are a turn off from the heat of the summer months. The best summer weight loss foods are those that you don’t need to slave away in the kitchen to prepare, and they are light and refreshing!<br>  <br>  The easiest way to cut back on calories is to eat more vegetables and fruits, as recommended by experts. That’s one of the best weight loss tips! Because produce is at its best during the summertime, it’s great to enjoy delicious fruits and vegetables from your local markets and grocery stores. Produce is also full of good antioxidants, minerals, vitamins, and fiber too! Enjoy as much as you want as well – don’t limit your portions, as you can’t hurt yourself from enjoying such healthy foods!<br>  <br>  If you’re looking to save some time making your meals, add prepared foods like soups and chicken to your fresh produce. It might end up costing you a little more, but you’ll really save time in the long run. Here are some examples of great foods to enjoy that can promote quick weight loss:<br>  <br>  Grilled Veggies<br>  You can use grilled onions, zucchini, carrots, bell peppers, asparagus, garlic, and eggplant to make tasty and healthy quick weight loss foods like:<br>  <br>  ?Grilled vegetable, ricotta, and fresh herb pasta and frittatas<br>  ?Grilled vegetable pitas<br>  ?Grilled vegetable and goat cheese salads<br>  <br>  Salads<br>  There’s no formal recipe needed when creating a delicious salad. They can also be made up fast for a quick and healthy meal. Rinse off and slice up your fresh produce. Add some fruits, vegetables, low-fat cheese, toasted nuts, fresh salad greens, and some light raspberry vinaigrette or ginger. You can complete your meal by adding a whole grain roll.<br>  Also, try a good bean or whole-grain salad such as wheatberry or tabouli.<br>  If you decide to flavor your salad with fresh herbs from the garden, you can save calories by adding less dressing. You can also add some meat or fish, as long as it’s done lightly.<br>  <br>  Chilled Soups<br>  Another great choice for a low-calorie meal is cold soup. Gazpacho and cucumber-dill soup are both great beginnings to delicious meals. You’ll be able to eat less and feel more full by beginning your meal with a nice tasty low-cal or broth-based soup.<br>  <br>  Fruit-Based Desserts<br>  Instead of choosing a traditional dessert rich in calories, satisfy your cravings and sweet tooth with a more natural dessert, such as:<br>  <br>  ?Grilled banana sundaes made with low-fat ice cream<br>  ?Frozen grapes<br>  ?A chocolate-covered frozen banana<br>  ?Grilled white peaches with blackberries and honey<br>  ?Grilled pineapple with rum and pecans<br>  ?Frozen, dark, sweet cherries<br>  <br>  Watermelon<br>  <br>  A crisp and juicy slice of watermelon is not just a great summer weight loss fruit, but it’s very refreshing as well! Also, because half of the watermelon is made from water, it can satisfy your thirst as well!<br>   <br>  Low- and No-Calorie Beverages<br>  Smoothies, sodas, sweetened teas, and sweetened specialty coffee drinks are all easy to drink when it’s hot outside, but they can have a surprisingly high calorie count. Keep an eye out for drinks like that since you’ll be drinking a lot during the summer to quench your thirst. Also remember that drinks can help you stay cooler from the heat, but they usually don’t have any affect on your appetite. You can still enjoy refreshing treats and drinks while you maintain your diet during the summer!|`|J9Heg6Qiaa	I only have three...I hope this could fit...<br>  <br>  1.) dark/black chocolates.  just don't go way too much!<br>  <br>  2.) sushi. salmon roll and tuna roll dipped in kikkoman chinese   <br>       soy sauce with wasabe (for spicy effect and anti-bacterial)<br>  <br>  3.) 0% fat yogurt. this is the healthiest way to repice creamcream.<br>  |`|0itSQ7iTaa	I love to make crab salad

Only you can commit to following the program for the full 90 days.  <br>  <br>  Also due to the fact that you don't have weight to lose I think P90X will get you absolutely ripped.

Try using Acidophilous as long as your doctor does not advise against it. You might try avoiding dairy products.
rJi6a3XAaa	If you have anemia then you should definitely discuss this with your dentist beforehand and he or she should be able to answer your questions and give you information to prepare you for it.<br>  <br>  Wisdom tooth extraction depends on how far your wisdom teeth have grown in and at what angle they have grown in.  Your dentist should be able to describe the whole procedure to you based on what he or she finds in your x-rays.  If a tooth is fully exposed then it should be pretty quick and relatively painless--the dentist will probably just inject you with local anesthesia and extract the tooth.  If a tooth is impacted, then they may have to surgically remove it.  Here's a helpful website that gives you the rundown: <a href="http://www.webmd.com/oral-health/guide/wisdom-teeth" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmd.com/oral-health/guide/w...</a><br>  <br>  When I had my wisdom teeth removed one was impacted and was growing in horizontally.  For this tooth, my dentist made an incision in my gums above the tooth, then moved the gums back and away from it and cut the tooth into smaller sections for easier removal, then detached the tooth from my jawbone (in some cases the tooth is still stuck to your jawbone) and pulled out the rest of it and stitched up the inside of my mouth.

(we make them at no charge to our patient who have gaps after removal)<br>  Also, you may want a bonded retainer to hold the space together. It is a very small wire behind your front two teeth to hold the space.<br>  Discuss options with your orthodontist. The remedies are simple and you will be much happier :)|`|5GcmU8gNaa	Your orthadontist knows do not take you retainer off wear it untill your orthandontist says so because they need to get used to the shape next time you go to your othadotist then say they might give you some infomation.|`|lBFVy8uUaa	Ask your orthodentisit

Yu7y6yfraa	No, this same thing plagued me up until a few years after my mother passed away.  I thought much more about this when I was younger. I used to even try to imagine what it would be like if they passed right then and how I would feel. The feelings would be scared, abandoned, lonely, sad, etc.  What did I do?  I worked hard to develp many close friends that would help me through such hard times.   Also, when my mom passed, she took a large part of me with her.  She also left a lot of herself behind in me.  I wish you the best.  Wanda  |`|98kiNkgEaa	i think the same thing all the time. Im so ******* scared, and don't know if I would want to live.

If this happens to you,<br>  you will grieve and be sad and hurt a lot inside. Trust me you will be able<br>  to go on living. Naturally you will be extremely sad for awhile but you will<br>  be able to live. I am still sad over losing my parents.|`|vbnMfFUIaa	Listen, most people feel that way.  They cannot think of their parents not being there, because they have always been there to comfort you.  But listen, you can't always think about that.  Instead think about all of the good times that you have had, and that you will have in the future. |`|vGMk1uZjaa	I get very paranoid about these things as well and with my anxiety disorder it really tires me out mentally. My father passed away when I was 6, and my mother is on Social Security, and she's not in the best of health either. Next year, she'll have to work two jobs, and I worry how she can manage her home life and work. I worry about the future all the time. I worry what'll happen to me, to my family. |`|7mHlDzn9aa	First of all, we all have a beginning and an end. It is our destiny. Now what I wonder about is why are you so afraid.

I think the same thing all the time. I just have to try as hard as possible to think about the present instead of the future...

So that gives me hope.|`|7e9OKHaQaa	Im the same i get so worried i can say your deffinetly not the only one on this planet.

Low Carbs is a great way Try to do about 60 carbs a day and you need to work out also Yes you need to do the Cardio but there you can also do the weights too if you are at the gym you should do this to nut you do not have to left a lot of weight just enough to give you some tone. You will not see it right away it may take a few months but you keep it up and you will see it falling off. It does work but it is also for life good luck.|`|f4410d16d54cdc594a09cb77a46601f9aa	You should do both.  Cardio to burn calories and weight training to tone.  Toned muscles, particularly large muscles like quads and biceps, burn more calories.  Your metabolism will increase if you do strength training.  Weights 1-2x per wk and cardio 5x a week for weight loss.|`|028a7fe39d1db2bf78ee2709c3c22d97aa	cardio, remember your heart rate must be a certain level in order to start burning fat. Weights help once you've burned the excess fat that is needed. Once you start your weight training focus on small weights and lots of reps. If you do heavy weights your going to add more muscle mass to your body, in turn you will weigh more.|`|0f497cf85ea5b4fb22d540bced25f27faa	It is always better to do a variety of exercises when you are trying to loose weight.  You also should pick things you are interested in, or do the exercises with a friend, because if you dont like to do it, then you wont find time to do it.  Loosing weight is the hardest thing someone can ever do, trust me i lost 40 lbs. and its not as easy as it looks but dont get discouraged if you start to not loose weight so fast because eventually your fat will be turning into muscle. well good luck with everything ..|`|462e7183ec00440f2e51ad1db5485d40aa	lifting weight will make the fat go away, that is because you are turning fat into muscle.

But, don't give up, YOU CAN DO IT!!!!!|`|9bd4f9dcf34a2c43bdbd2fe05bcb3702aa	cardio burns the fat better, lifting weights builds muscle and all activity burns calories, bur cardio burns the fat quicker|`|191ee5febd3f729f792cecd54180bae5aa	When you lose weight you should be doing lots of cardio as well as lifting weights to tone up as you lose weight.
29a3fa6d681183887583da61899d305aaa	I hear you, unfortunately it seems like healthy food and cheap don't go together. I guess buy in bulk when you can is one thing. Like buying the large jar of peanut butter- it is more money at the time but you save money in the long run. Also buying things like chicken in bulk and/or frozen is cheaper in the long run. Actually for chicken or meat we have a local meat market and it is almost half of what it is in the grocery stores so check out your city. See what is on sale for fruits and veggies in the grocery store flyer before you shop. Sometimes buying frozen veggies is cheaper than fresh and you can be sure they won't go bad. Buy whole wheat pastas instead of regular. Usually pretty comparable. Brown rice instead of white. Again even though it is more expensive at the time it is cheaper in the long run to buy bigger bags. Cereals and things like that usually have a comparable no-name kind.<br>  <br>  I am in the same boat and I am trying to eat healthy. I often buy the things that are sale when I am there and make up a big batch of something and eat it for the rest of the week. I always make sure I pack my lunch so i am not tempted to spend money on something. I make my coffee or tea at home and bring it with me.<br>  <br>  Hope this is a little helpful. On weekends when friends want to go out to eat you could suggest getting together for a potluck and there is usually leftovers to take home as well. Good luck.
rAQADfSvaa	I don't recommend diet's; However I do recommend positive lifestyle changes. These are what will last forever! I hate counting calories and following strict rules, so here's what I do. I try and stay away from high sugars and fats and increase my fibre and protein. I'm a vegetarian, and although I didn't make this dietary decision for weight loss, I'm seeing wonderful results. Exercise is extremely important. My favorites are low impact activities, as this is all I'm capable of doing with my medical limitations at this time. I walk 1 hour everyday and do either pilate's or yoga. You'd be amazed at what these exercises can do for your body and mind! :) Remember to start off slow and to realize that the weight didn't come on overnight, so you can't expect it to drop in a snap. Keep a positive, motivated attitude and you can accomplish any goal. My biggest motivator is my health. I have a blood coagulation disorder and very bad circulation. It's very important that I eat well and exercise often to prevent future blood clots. If you can find your personal motivator, then you're already on your way. That's the hardest step. Good luck and take care.|`|AIVd5OHOaa	raw food diet then after loseing lots of weight|`|zzfbE70Qaa	heyyy<br>  i also want to lose weight<br>  this is wat i have been doing (its working)<br>  everyday i put on my favourite CD and i do different excersises to each song<br>  ex: live ur life by rhiana: jumping jacks<br>        BB good by jonas brothers: running up and down the stairs<br>         womanizer by britney spears: sit ups<br>  <br>  and stuff like that....its actually tons of funnn!!<br>  <br>  I also reccomend runs in the morning with an ipod (if uve got the time)|`|wFnZ7s0Caa	you rly dont need diet, that is bullsh!t, idc what people say, just exercise, it depends on how old you are too, if you kinda old, just walk alot, and lift small weights, if your younger, then run alot, and drink alot of water and juice, and eat fruit, but you can still eat like steak and potatoes, and pasta, just instead of junk snacks eat healthy snacks, also invest in an exercise ball|`|LzsBdfoVaa	drink water and change your diet all whole wheat and eat lots of chicken...any kind of exercise will help..you dont have to be jumping and doing all of the aerobics junk to lose weight...just simply walking or jogging 30 mins a day will help...Good Luck|`|mQvZAS7haa	You have to exercise and have a good diet plan to loose weight.

Trust me, it can be a lot worse! You have a normal flow. Heavy flows require you to change pads frequently and are a lot more bothersome (in terms of cramps). Light flows last a shorter amount of time than usual. But if you ask me, they ALL can be a pain sometimes!
GhJEOsiHaa	The first thing you need to do is figure out why your sex drive is low and try to help get it back.  I was in your situation and it's not fun without being horny and feeling in the mood when needed.  I also felt like my orgasms (if I would even get one) were really weak.  Probably because of my sex drive.<br>  <br>  However, I tried exercising and dieting but nothing seemed to be working.  I thought I was screwed.  I then found something just as amazing as the vibrator.<br>  <br>  My friend at work told me about this stuff she took to raise her sex drive.  It was a natural herbal supplement and was I lucky to of found it.  Theres no side effects and the sex drive is just tremendous along with orgasms that are blasting.  The stuff is called Hersolution pills.  At the time I saved money on them at herenhancement.com<br>  <br>  What I did was tried out for 3 months and that was really it.  I found taking them every other day or so was the best to stretch it out. After the months were up, I was back to normal with a beating sex drive and my orgasm strength in increased so much.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and I hope this helps.|`|mKP1mjS3aa	Depending on the brand, birth control pills are available in packs of 21 or 28. The 21 pills (from a pack of 21 or 28) are a combination of estrogen and progesterone hormones. These hormones stop the ovulation process and prevent the ovaries from releasing eggs. It also helps thicken the cervical mucus, making the entry of sperm into the uterus difficult. The remaining 7 pills in a 28-pill pack are blank pills, hence known as spacer pills. This helps maintain a one pill a day rhythm.<br>  <br>  As with all methods of contraception, the pill too has got its own set of advantages and disadvantages. <br>  <br>  Advantages of the Birth Control Pill<br>  The biggest advantage of the birth control pill is its ease of use. It can be used for emergency contraception. Regular use helps maintain a regular period that is lighter and less painful. It was previously believed that regular use of the pill caused cancer, but advanced studies have proved just the opposite. Regular use of the pill actually reduces the risk of ovarian cancer. The pill has also proved to help women who have symptoms of PMS. Acne is noticeably reduced with regular use of the pill. Another big advantage is that total fertility is restored when use of the pill is stopped. <br>  <br>  Side Effects of the Pill<br>  If you are a woman who enjoys good health and does not smoke it is safe to be on the pill regularly.<br>  <br>  The pill available today is much better and safer for regular use than the pills available a couple of decades ago. Even though there are major improvements, side effects are present when you begin taking the pill because your body has to adjust to the hormonal changes that are brought on with the use of the pill.<br>  <br>  Side effects may include one or more of the following:<br>  -- nausea<br>  -- vomiting<br>  -- dizzy feeling<br>  -- tiredness<br>  -- headache<br>  -- breast tenderness<br>  -- abdominal pain<br>  -- mood swings<br>  -- early or late next period with irregular bleeding<br>  -- weight gain<br>  <br>  Usually the symptoms will gradually reduce with the regular use of the pill. <br>  <br>  <br>  Who Should Not Use The Pill<br>  Almost every woman can safely use the pill, but there are those that can't use the pill for birth control due to certain medical or other conditions. They can include women:<br>  <br>  -- who have regular blood clots<br>  -- who have cardiac problems<br>  -- who have blood pressure<br>  -- who have known liver ailments<br>  -- who are on antibiotics and other strong medication<br>  -- who are over the age of 35 and smoke<br>  -- who have diabetes (can be taken only under medical supervision) |`|2lZK5FLzaa	I take yasmin and it doesnt make my sex drive go down at all and it really helps your skin

0e8mlXveaa	Firstly you need to relax and try to get over the mental block of this as it is mind over matter the first couple of times. Secondly if you aren't embarrassed about buying lube of some description such as KY jelly or the durex ones from chemist or supermarkets, lightly coat the tampon in lube first before insertion as this will help. It may also help you to insert a finger first too so you get a feel for the shape and angle of your vaginal canal. It may be worth having a go with applicator tampons a few times too as this may be easier while you are getting used to them.<br>  Good luck and have a wonderful holiday. x|`|f51698460302ec66ac9b2683bcc69ec9aa	Well honey you have to use the applicator.  And when you insert a tampon it has to be at an angle.  The best way is to lay down and bring your knees closer to your chest then put it in.  Make sure you are using the smallest applicator possible.  Haha remember those days you were excited about starting your period : P  well best wishes!|`|ulaNzCPsaa	First, have you talked to your mother or a female family member or school nurse?  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Use-a-Tampon" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Use-a-Tampon</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.teenwire.com/infocus/2004/if-20041217p338-period.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.teenwire.com/infocus/2004/if-...</a>|`|5C6iMYmtaa	Okay, Tampons are a tricky subject!<br>  I had the same problem when I first started using them. How I coped was using the tampons with applicators just to help with insertion better. At your heaviest period flow is when you should try to use them as there is lubricant for the applicator to ease into instead of trying when your flow is weakest. Got that so far?? Follow all the instructions in the pack of tampons and look at the pictures closely because, they actually do know what they're talking about!!! Once you start getting use to using the applicator ones and are waaaay more comfortable using tampons, then you could try use the ones without applicators. <br>  It takes practise and patience, I know, I've been where you are!!!! Lol, oh, and there's definitely room in there even if it feels like there isn't!!!! Yeah, so hopefully, that helps you.|`|7utsLRfyaa	you are doing the right thing, just angle the tampon a bit and keep trying!<br>  You dont want a ruined holiday!<br>  try an applicator one because it pushes it into the right place as long as you insert it according to the instructions.<br>  get tampax compak because they have a really smooth applicator and i started using tampons and they are so easy to use!<br>  start by getting the regular size :)<br>  or get a multipak where there are some light, regular and heavy tampons for every day of youre period :D<br>  good luck!|`|Nd6uItCDaa	remember that when inserting your tampon you need to push it diagonally backwards and not straight upwards. Also maybe try using lil lets? They're really handy for when you first start using tampons. Make sure you relax when you're trying to insert it otherwise your muscles will tensen and you won't be able to insert the tampon.<br>  <br>  If you're really stuck, maybe try using tampons with an applicator.
9snxL5MMaa	A little amount of pain should be expected..but throbbing pain may occur when the dentist has missed a canal..that means he has not located an infected nerve -canal.. the obturating material might be a bit too over-extended (gutta percha)...the entire infection or abscess is not removed from the tooth or he might not have eased your tooth from occlusal forces.. Watch out if you develop a swelling then it means that he might have just missed a canal...but if not then i guess the antibiotics and pain killers should do the job..<br>  <br>  Pathfinder!!|`|d0931e1723721a96a124be586847be18aa	yea i know its really bad, i've experienced the pain before. the pain is still going to be there for a few days. all you can do at the moment is just take some NSAIDs (non-steriodal anti-inflammatory drugs) such as brufen. it will decrease the pain. but the pain will never be gone completely unless the dentist finishes what s/he started

he18hGKNaa	That's such a difficult question.  By general standards, that's overweight.  However a lot can come into play when determining if you're overweight or not.  For example, I'm 5'10 and have been flirting with 200lbs for a number of years.  I've got a 35" waist.  However, I honestly do have a broad bone structure.  I run a mile in less than seven minutes.  By any doctor's standards I'm in great shape and my waist is about as small as my body will allow for healthily... but if you look at a chart and just punch in the numbers, I'm very overweight.  Everyone's body is different, and holds weight differently.  Plus muscle weighs a lot more than fat, so if you hit the gym regularly, your weight is going to be pretty heavy regardless of your waist size.  If you're nervous about your weight, look up online techniques for tape measuring different parts of your body and getting a much more accurate measurement of your BMI.

RMmh0aimaa	You are now fixated on it. Start telling yourself that you are a good person and that you love yourself. Try to avoid those people who make you feel this way about yourself. Everyone has their own problems. These people that have everything going for them most likely have a secret about their life which makes them think your life is much better than theirs. Don't dwell on the bad things, or the bad things will only get worse because you are 'willing' them into your life. If you are a happy person, you will make other people happy as emotions are contagious. If you are miserable, people around you will be miserable too and so it goes.<br>  <br>  If you feel it is really serious, then see a psychologist or a life coach who can help you talk about your problems.<br>  <br>  Being a perfectionist is a common problem. Wanting to be perfect at everything means that you will never live up to your expectations because they are way too high and not achievable. Lower your expectations and become more realistic. Then you will start to feel better about yourself as you successfully accomplish things.|`|oM9s8wmSaa	DON'T C0MPARE Y0URSELF WITH S0ME0NE ELSE that's not good for you. everyone feels insecure about something about themselves but you need to get over that and realize that you are beautiful no matter what. you may think you are ugly but you're not. never let anyone talk down to you.. you shouldn't even talk down to you. and the whole fashion thing. who cares. just wear whatever you feel like wearing. you shouldn't care what other people think about you.|`|TphsSOz6aa	Get out of your own head and into the world !!

Re-program your emotional responses. Hate is a strong term; reduce it to: "I dislike myself, and my life, at present". This allows for the possibility of change. Realise, and accept that YOU are the one who programmed your mind, and that YOU have the ability to re-program it. When you notice something negative, such as: "I'm never going to get over this!" or: "Why am I always so pathetic/useless/such a loser?" or even: "I can't do this/will never get over this!", or a disturbing image, recognise that this is part of the mindset which will hold you back from progress. Having identified and labelled it, visualise a large red "STOP!" sign, and/or possibly a stern faced person wagging an index finger at you in a negative manner, then say to yourself as forcefully as you can, even aloud in a big voice, if alone: "I know this tactic: GO AWAY FOR A WHILE !!!" You may want to use either: "ruse", "ploy", "game", or "trick", instead of "tactic".<br>  <br>  <br>  In the case of an image, visualise a large "STOP" sign, or your preferred version. Some people go so far as to keep a wide rubber band in their pocket, then put it around their wrist, when they catch themselves backsliding, stretch and release it, as a method of reprogramming their mind sooner, but I don't regard it as being strictly necessary. Remember to remove it, afterwards, if you use this method. See the tips at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> in section 2, particularly those in the mental-health-abc and conquering stress websites. Recognise, and challenge your negative monologue (self talk). Make a conscious commitment to being positive, and optimistic, even if it is apparently unrealistic, or inappropriate, because of the benefits it will provide, later on. WORK, to change yourself into someone you can think much better of.<br>  <br>   See sections 38, and 47, and volunteer, even from home, at first, to provide a solid basis in reality for the daily affirmations: "I am a good person, who is valued by my community, because I (insert activity here)". As one insightful (paraphrasing poetically) person put it: an affirmation, without foundation is mere mental masturbation. Read: "Lift your mood now." by John D Preston, Psy.D. 2001, New Harbinger Publications, Inc., 5674 Shattuck Avenue, Oakland. CA 94609 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/</a> may be worth trying for this, as it has a good section on building self esteem, using a different approach. You can also learn to use the EFT, in section 53, several times daily: "Even though I dislike my current life situation, I deeply and completely accept myself". Consider taking up yoga, or t'ai chi.<br>  <br>  There's another simple technique to beating self-hatred. Stand in front of a mirror, and write down a list of your good qualities, and on a separate page, write your bad qualities. You must force yourself to write at least 6 on both lists. Then, once you have finished, rip up the bad list, while keeping a completely open mind, and repeat: "I don't care", 6 times. Then, put the good list under your pillow, and sleep on it, that night. Later, rewrite it, or type/print in large print/capitalise, and place it in a position of prominence, such as your bedroom wall, or near the computer, television, or refrigerator, where you will see it, often.|`|r5wK05N5aa	I like your avatar.

To me it sounds like you are, but I'm just going on what I know from personal experience.<br>  Have you lost joy in doing thigs you used to love doing?

Il trattamento prevede tre fasi per una durata complessiva di almeno sei mesi. La prima fase si propone di fornire informazioni sul disturbo e di ridurre le abbuffate regolarizzando la frequenza dei pasti e utilizzando attività alternative. La seconda fase mira a rendere stabile il comportamento alimentare attraverso la normalizzazione delle porzioni e la scelta della qualità degli alimenti, e a ridurre l’eccessiva preoccupazione per il peso e le forme corporee. La terza fase prevede l’applicazione di procedure finalizzate a prevenire le ricadute, a mantenere i risultati raggiunti durante il trattamento e alla preparazione della fine della terapia.<br>  <br>  I farmaci che, nell'esperienza clinica, si sono mostrati efficaci nel trattamento di tale disturbo sono gli antidepressivi appartenenti alla categoria degli inibitori selettivi del ricaptazione della serotonina (SSRI).<br>  L’uso dei farmaci antidepressivi nella cura della bulimia nervosa è dimostrato essere efficace per tre principali motivi:<br>   permette una riduzione media del 50-60% nella frequenza delle abbuffate nel giro di qualche settimana;<br>   permette una riduzione equivalente nella frequenza del vomito, un miglioramento dell’umore e del senso di controllo sull’alimentazione e una diminuzione della preoccupazione per il cibo;<br>   l’effetto antidepressivo del farmaco si verifica sia nei soggetti depressi che non depressi.<br>  Tuttavia è necessario sottolineare che recenti ricerche indicano che in molti soggetti il farmaco risulta non avere efficacia a lungo termine. Sembra infatti che, sebbene il farmaco antidepressivo riesca a ridurre le abbuffate, non possa eliminare alcuni fattori specifici che contribuiscono al mantenimento della bulimia nervosa, come ad esempio la dieta ferrea.|`|70935455da1a08b68e3e391e47b81a0aaa	al quanto pare  ti hanno spiegato di tutto e di più.. e il vomito indotto può essere fatale a lungo andare  ed e`micidiale psicologicamente en lo immediato..che ti posso dire..si conosci a qualcuno che lo fa .. mettilo sotto avviso e  se nn e`cosi, abbi cura di te.che la vita e la salute sono doni preziosi. nn sottovalutare mai la capacita del nostro corpo di rigenerarsi si gli dai il tempo per farlo...|`|0cfa97eb62be20f49fa9ca394f772ff9aa	provoca danni molto gravi tipo la bulimia e in seguito la anoressia a lungo andare.<br>  Fregatene della linea: la vita vale molto di + e non pensare: la vita e' la mia e come tale la gestisco io.<br>  Faresti male ai tuoi amici, ai tuoi familiari, a chi ti vuole bene.<br>  Pensaci.<br>  Un abbraccio|`|3b8a0e1109c974cb09fda6ba678af2b8aa	Qui ci andrebbe la consulenza d un dottore<br>  P:S:Scusa,ma nessuno ti ha mai detto che sei bellissima così come sei?|`|4575f23f5657d47b98d0bbf8d37bfacdaa	non mi preoccuperi più di tanto per lo smalto dei denti. i veri problemi sono conseguenti all'alcalosi metabolica!!!!!!!<br>  eliminando col vomito acido cloridrico si ha un'aumento della concentrazione ematica dei bicarbonati. tale squilibrio è detto appunto Alcalosi metabolica che provoca seri danni.<br>  1) Il pH del sangue diviene alcalino >7.4<br>  2) la perdita di liquidi genera disidratazione<br>  3) per meccanismi compensatori, il rene elimina K (potassio) per non permettere l'ulteriore eliminazione di Na (sodio)<br>  4) Anche l'apparato respiratorio cerca di dare il suo aiuto, quindi Il compenso respiratorio può essere ottenuto con una ipoventilazione ed un aumento della PCO2 (pressione parziale dell'anidride carbonica)<br>  5) Sintomi a carico del SNC (sistema nervoso centrale), dei muscoli scheletrici (crampi, tetania).<br>  6) lo squilibrio idro-salino detemina deficit di conduzione cardiaca: aritmie, tachicardia, fibrillazione ventricolare<br>  7) l'acido cloridrico può corredere la parete esofagea, esofagiti, reflusso...<br>  ..... mi fermo qui....altrimenti la lista si allungherebbe troppo.<br>  <br>  Occhio!!! questo non è il miglior modo per mantenere la linea, anzi è quello più sbagliato e pericoloso!!!!!!!

Difficile essere in armonia col mondo e con sè stessi, certo, ma vale la pena provarci e se ti rovini la salute sarà sempre più difficile apprezzare la bellezza del tuo essere, del tuo esistere e del mondo tutto !! Infine , curiosità, il vomito indotto per noi é pratica dei bulimici o degli anoressici, negativa e dannosa...ma esiste anche una pratica salutista nello Yoga e nell'Ayurveda che cura alcuni mali, principalmente l'acidità di stomaco, vomitando intenzionalmente, al mattino, a digiuno,dopo aver bevuto un litro o due di acqua tiepida salata...non  si fa comunque tutti i giorni e ha alcune controindicazioni.|`|89922c45e95e9f072b7e1cfbbe4e912caa	Dopo che per anni le crisi di bulimia sono state scambiate per semplici attacchi di golosità, oggi è provato, come dice il dottor Vanotti, che "anche se per questa malattia la mortalità è più bassa che per l'anoressia, i danni all'esofago provocati dal vomito indotto, o la carenza di vitamine e potassio dovuti all'uso di lassativi e a una dieta squilibrata, possono essere gravi. Addirittura letali". Nonostante questo, molte donne che soffrono di bulimia continuano a sottovalutarla. O se ne vergognano troppo per chiedere aiuto. "Eppure si cura con successo nel 70 per cento dei casi", prosegue Vanotti, "con una terapia dietologica e soprattutto affrontando i nodi psicologici che si nascondono sempre dietro questi comportamenti".

Queste complicanze sono tipiche della Bulimia Nervosa e della Anoressia Nervosa con condotte di eliminazione. <br>  Ipopotassiemia, iponatremia, ipocloremia <br>  La perdita di potassio, sodio e cloro provoca complicanze metaboliche (alcalosi, chetonuria), renali e cardiovascolari, sia in forma acuta che cronica.<br>  I sintomi di uno squilibrio idroelettrolitico sono: sete, vertigini e ritenzione idrica, che causa gonfiore a gambe (edemi declivi) e braccia, debolezza, apatia, tic e spasmi nervosi.<br>  In particolare vomitare dopo avere assunto ingenti quantità di acqua (pratica molto diffusa nel tentativo, peraltro vano, di eliminare tutto quello che si è ingerito) crea un profondo e immediato cambiamento nell'equilibrio idrosalino, che ha come sintomo spossatezza, tremori e tachicardia e può esitare in aritmie cardiache anche gravi (dalla tachicardia sinusale alla fibrillazione ventricolare).<br>  I danni renali più frequenti sono la nefropatia ipopotassiemica e la calcolosi renale. <br>  Infiammazione delle ghiandole salivari <br>  Le ghiandole salivari risentono del vomito autoindotto e vanno rapidamente incontro a tumefazioni molto evidenti per aumento della produzione di saliva e per lo squilibrio idrosalino che si crea vomitando.<br>  Le ghiandole salivari infiammate si gonfiano, ma possono anche produrre calcoli di dimensioni variabili, che possono ostruire i dotti salivari e provocare un intenso dolore. La ghiandola parotide in particolare gonfiandosi tende a modificare la fisionomia del volto, dando al viso un aspetto tondeggiante; il fenomeno è reversibile generalmente in qualche settimana con l'astensione dalle pratiche compensatorie (sopratutto vomito). <br>  PER ALTRE INFO RIVOLGITI ALL'ABA

In all likelihood, some relative of yours infected you when you were a child by kissing you at a time when his herpes simplex was infectious.<br>  <br>  The virus scooted right into your mouth and sought a hospitable host cell, probably a nerve cell that would let the virus move right in.

IJE5qK5qaa	You know, I really like the Neil Med saline rinse.  It's a squeeze bottle that is filled with warm water and a powder that creates a saline solution.  You squeeze this up one side and let it drain out the other.  I know, it sounds awful, but after the first time (which can be a little creepy--follow the directions!) I loved it.  <br>  <br>  Add to this an antihistamine or a steam treatment (really hot water, bend over it and put a towel over your head to catch the steam, and breathe deeply).|`|un0C52G8aa	Those little nasal decongestants that look like lipstick cases.

71wBNgbnaa	If I were you I would try using a clinical strength deodorant/antiperspirant, like Certain Dri or Secret Clinical Strength. If that doesn't work, go to the doctor. You may have overactive sweat glands. It's not necessarily detrimental to your health, but it can be embarrassing. The doctor will be able to treat you for it, and then you won't sweat as much. <br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|rt3wnxw0aa	Yeah use anti perspirant and also wear perfume because it masks the scent and even talcum powder!|`|OyeI4dF5aa	Make sure you're 100% dry before putting on your deodorant. <br>  Try drying under your your arms lightly with a towel, then use a hairdryer just to make sure... use antiperspirant instead of deodorant since what you want to do is get rid of the sweat... less sweat = less smell.<br>  <br>  It may also be the foods your eating... try and stay away from salty foods since this in essence is what sweat is - so if we eat loads of salt then we'll sweat more.<br>  Spicy foods tend to make sweat smell even worse.<br>  <br>  Good luck ;-)<br>  |`|qx8RdSLGaa	antiperspirants are what you are looking for. put it on in the morning and after school so that it is fresh. put a lot of it on too. i get that problem and it is an easy fix. hope this helps |`|AA10827242	use an anti perspirant NOT a deodorant|`|95wicx1Naa	g

CciXZNYraa	Don't eat late at night. <br>  Eating late at night can cause you to store more fat in your waist and stomach. Stop eating 3 hours before you go to bed. If you need a snack, eat something healthy like a piece of fruit or a handful of nuts (unsalted). <br>  Eat often, but in small portions. The less your body peaks and falls on the blood sugar scale, the less likely it will be to overeat and/or store unwanted fat. Ideally, cut calories, but don’t starve yourself. If you eat the right foods and eat often enough, you won’t find yourself eating huge portions and overeating in general.<br>  Eat fats like fish oil, sunflower oil, flax seed oil. Also whole grains, legumes, and vegetables and limiting meats. Ease up on the salt and gassy foods that cause you to bloat.<br>  <br>  <br>  Get out and move. After what you put in your mouth, what you do with your body will determine if you can flatten your belly. Get at least 30 minutes of cardio exercise every day, along with a properly executed abdominal workout. Train your body with strength training activities. Adding muscle tone will help you perform all daily activities as well.<br>  <br>  You can also try these exercises:<br>  <br>  Belly rolls strengthen your vertical abdominal muscles. Sit with your legs bent, with feet flat on the floor and arms straight in front of you. Exhale and roll back until your lower back touches the ground and stop for a moment. Inhale and roll back up. Repeat 15 times. <br>  In the same position, exhale and roll back until your shoulder blades touch the ground and momentarily stop. Inhale and roll back up. Repeat 15 times. <br>  <br>  Tummy curls work on your horizontal abdominal muscles. Lie on your back and bend your knees at an (almost) 90-degree angle to the floor with your feet raised slightly higher than your knees. Breathe out, lifting your butt and rolling back to your shoulder blades. Inhale and roll to your tailbone and stop. Try not to let your bottom touch the ground. Repeat 20 times. <br>  <br>  Cross crunches are hard work but they're miracle workers at cinching waists. You will need a liter bottle filled with water for this one. Lie on your back with your knees bent at a 90-degree angle with the floor. With your left hand cradling your head, hold the water bottle in your right hand. Lift your head and shoulders off the ground and reach across your body, so the bottle is outside your left knee. Pulse 20 times and then switch sides and repeat. <br>  <br>  Tailbone lifts work your lower abdomen and can help reduce a belly pouch. Lay on your back, with your arms stretched straight over your head and legs fully extended and crossed in the air. While breathing out, lift your tailbone then slowly lower as you inhale. To get maximum effect from this, don't let your bum just drop, you want to resist on the way down. Repeat 30 times. <br>  <br>  This is a favorite of mine as inverted crunches work your lower back which improves posture and strength. Lie on your belly with your arms in front of you as though you are flying like Superman. Exhale, lifting your right arm and left leg as high as you can. As you inhale, lower slowly. Switch, lifting your left arm and right leg. Repeat 20 times. <br>  In the same position, lift both arms and legs twenty times.<br>  <br>  Burn your belly fat by doing sit and reach exercise. <br>  Running and dancing early in the morning. <br>  Simple stretching and jumping when you wake up in the morning.|`|tSi10jneaa	Workout. Cycling, swimming and running.<br>  Less beef, less pork and less turkey.<br>  Oops forgot the burger and junk food to be stopped.|`|HXpR2bw0aa	You look just like me! And I'm around your age too.. so follow this and I'm sure you'll be looking great by summer in a bikini!   :)<br>  <br>  Okay, well how fast you lose weight all depends on how much you weigh at the moment. For example, if you were obese then you'd lost weight a lot faster than someone who is an average weight, or just slightly overweight.<br>  <br>  It's pretty easy to lose a stone in a few months. For example, I have lost 18lbs since the beginning of January, which is 1 stone and 4lbs.<br>  <br>  There are simple easy things you've gotta do which is using less butters and oils whilst cooking, and cutting down on that odd chocolate bar you might have once every few days. Eventually, after a few weeks, aim to not snack at all. Yep, it's really hard but you've gotta try hard, so think of something that will really motivate you, like thinking about what you could look like after a few months if you stay away from bad foods, and if you do eat it, how bad you'll feel after. Do not EVER eat after 7pm. If you really wanna be good then don't eat after 6pm. But 7pm is the complete latest. It doesn't matter how healthy the snack is, don't eat it. The only thing going into your mouth after 7pm is water.<br>  You should also drink lots of water in the day. Usually, when your stomache is telling your brain you're hungry, you're just thirsty!<br>  <br>  Exercising is a lot easier than people make out. I do aerobics in my bedroom and it's easy. Just get an iPod or MP3 and move! Even have a little dance around. Or, if you don't have an iPod or MP3 player, play music out loud. Whatever you choose to do, just move!<br>  I also go on a 20 minute walk every day. Remember that even a little bit of exercise is better than no exercise.<br>  Then of course, do the simple things that'll burn even just a few calories. For example, if you get a bus often, then walk to the next stop and then get on the bus, or if the journey isn't that far, walk the whole way. If you drive to a lot of places then park further away from your destination and walk. During lunch breaks go for a little walk, even if it's just for 15 mintues, it's better than nothing.<br>  <br>  Chew gum. It'll keep your mind and mouth focused on something other than food, and if you buy an expensive gum, then you'll feel guilty about just throwing it in the bin, and you'll try and get as many chews as you can from it. I understand about eating from boredom, so try and find something really fun to do while you're at home!<br>  <br>  Good luck, and feel free to email me if you need any more tips! <br>  <br>  :)|`|NlC3xaK8aa	do some cardio (swimming, running, cycling... which ever you prefer) and do some situps.<br>  good luck<br>  ems<br>  x

There is no way she would know, if she looks for them (NOT IN YOU LOL) Just hide them in a draw or something. My mum was the same but about shaving my legs haha. Hope that helps|`|XDf8xSyyaa	I tend to agree with most here...it's your body you should choose the products you are most comfortable with, your mum's thoughts regarding virginity and tampons are UTTERLY RIDICULOUS as thetwo have nothing to do with each other!|`|imDv8YzPaa	your mum is an idiot!<br>  <br>  maybe sit her down and say that you want to use tampons and then list the reasons - better still sit her down with a nurse at your local GP doctors clinic and the nurse can help you explain that her ideas are seriously deluded. She is unlikely to change her mind though. Older people get stuck in their ways of thinking.<br>  <br>  I would use tampons and hide them? She shouldnt find out unless she's going through your room (which she shouldnt do unless you're drinking/smoking/doing drugs and getting into trouble giving her a reason to). If she does find them, explain, you've already used them now and all her theories are now null and void, she'll ahve no choice to let you continue using them.<br>  <br>  Seriously, a woman (young woman) has the right to choose the type of feminine protection for herself, your mum should not take this away from you!<br>  <br>  Good luck and try the smaller tampons first (for extra light flow) so they wont hurt putting them in the first few times.<br>  <br>  hope i helped
aQ8o4w3Xaa	Take another test. Do it first thing in the morning. <br>  <br>  Has your eating, exercise regime changed? Sometimes simple little things like that can alter your period and cause major scares like this.  Stress can also attribute to a delay in a period. <br>  <br>  I'd suggest you take a trip to the doctor and get a blood test done. That will tell you for sure whether or not you're pregnant, and if you're not it could highlight any other health problems delaying your period. <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  ;)|`|qNdsNhgOaa	You should have your doctor test you.  Best wishes ;)|`|S5dtWq8jaa	Try again with a different brand in the morning - I heard the first pee in the morning is more effective.  Just keep in mind that your body changes all the time, so don't worry too much about it if this second test shows negative again.  Of course, you can go to the doctor to have a lab test done there too if you are still concerned.
Qnswjc6kaa	Umm... don't become anorexic?<br>  <br>  I don't understand what you're talking about. If you don't want an eating disorder, don't starve yourself. It's as simple as that. I had an eating disorder, and while I had my E.D., I starved myself. So, if you don't want an E.D., I advise you to NOT STARVE YOURSELF. Go on a normal diet. Don't ban entire food groups or get obsessive about it. The key to not getting an eating disorder is just to relax and chill. It's when you start worrying, and you feel the need to plan and control your entire weight loss journey, and you spend all of your time fantasizing about how your world will be perfect when you're thin, that you develop a problem.<br>  <br>  Just don't focus on weight loss. Make sure you have other things going on in your life.|`|8iFoA2Swaa	Well Im sure you expected this but trust me it works, eat salads. Salads may not be the most tastiest food without dressing but it'll work. Trust me if you only consume greens and fruits than it'll help very very well. 2nd go for a run everyday. Im not saying to run until your legs burn, no. Let me state it this way, "jog" about half an hour until your covered in sweat. At home do about 30-50 situps (average of how much you can do or until your abs start to burn) 3 times a day. In the morning, mid-day, and before sleep. Also when your the doing the routine 3 times a day after situps do about 10-15 pushups. This'll have you get great results. And..this is a pretty simple workout and isn't pushing you to the limit.

But the actual pain is truly there, as impulses sent by the affected and damaged nerves. There are many types of pain, of course, with burns being the worst. Some internal organs do not contain pain nerves. Only nerves capable of detecting pressure.<br>  <br>  I tried something on myself once with good success. I once cut off the tip of my ring finger on a table saw. I knew that the throbbing pain would keep me up most the night. (Didn't see a Doctor) After I changed the bandage just before sleeping, I wrapped a piece of Duct Tape around my finger below the injury at the base of the finger. The idea was to give the nerves in that finger something else to do besides detect pain. I had a fair degree of success with it. Although the tape was not at all tight, there was pressure for the nerves there which helped to cancel out the pain felt from another location on the same finger. I got the idea from a TENS unit, (Transcutanious Electronic Nerve Stimulator) which does the same thing. I admit this tactic won't always work. But it did for me in that particular instance.|`|wgEiJAqzaa	Well if your legs arms and head get severed I'm pretty sure that's pain, and you would die, but pain is in the nerves not the mind, or probably the brain sends waves that senses pain, i sure would not know..|`|0eba0c37213d06a8de73db765ea13cc0aa	Yes.

Anorexia is a symptom of a far deeper problem, often great emotional pain.  Anorexia is a coping mechanism.   Heal the pain that drove you to anorexia. <br>  <br>  Accept the fact that you will always be vulnerable to a relapse and tempted to return to this old coping strategy.  So, in a way, you're not a RECOVERED anorectic.  You'll always be a RECOVERING anorectic.  You'll know you're returning to the old ways if you see that you're moving back into old patterns.

Research has shown that to get the most out of your exercise 3 times a WEEK  is the optimal. Whether you exercise 7 days a week or 7 times a day, the difference in gains is minimal.Anyway, your muscles grow while at rest, so exercising the same muscle group everyday will eventually lead to injury. In terms of intensity, if you can hold a conversation you are not intense enough, and if you are totally out of breath and can't get a word in, you are over doing it. Moderation is the key. Interval training is the best method. Short bursts of intense exercise. An example is walk, run walk. Do a full circuit without rest, then rest 30 to 60 secs and start another circuit.<br>  <br>  As far as eating is concerned, eat anything you want as long as its nutritious. Don't deny yourself the things you like, just eat less of them. Moderation, moderation, moderation, drum this into your brain and you'll be okay. The key is to burn more calories than you consume.|`|2DTm06Oqaa	3 times per day is practically suicide if you rep to failure. You're not on steroids, so all this will do is overtrain your muscles. They will then begin to shrink, stay sore and weak, and generally make you feel like crap.<br>  <br>  If you're dead set on 3 times per day, to a max of two sets of 5 or 10 of each exercise, but don't come anywhere near close to not being able to finish even the second set. If you wanna train to failure, work out every other day so you have time to recover in between.<br>  <br>  As for diet, if you're skinny or average, eat like hell. Gaining weight is the only way to gain muscle. Make sure you get lots and lots of protein. If you're overweight, eat just a little lighter, and better (protein again) and do a 10 minute cardio warm up before working out. Not only will this burn some of those extra calories, but you won't go into lifting cold, which will help you perform better. But if you're skinny, conserve calories at all costs.

For generally toned legs, hips, and waist.  Be sure to do a group of exercises, not just one.  I would recommend doing forward and backward lunges.<br>  <br>  To do these, start off initially with a relatively lightweight dumbbell in each hand, feet slightly spread apart, chin up, chest out, shoulder's squared.  Take a full step forward with one leg, bringing your thigh parallel to the floor, then step back. Alternate legs.  <br>  <br>  To do the backward lunge, walk backwards, using full strides.  <br>  <br>  Once you master these techniques then moderately increase the weight of the dumbbells.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://etrueschler.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/lunge.jpg&imgrefurl=http://etrueschler.wordpress.com/2008/11/17/no-time-no-problem/&usg=__viFDzdM3SxhayME4zFySCQ7YCkI=&h=400&w=358&sz=17&hl=en&start=1&um=1&tbnid=Mn0BHirxLKM0MM:&tbnh=124&tbnw=111&prev=/images%3Fq%3Dlunge%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26sa%3DN%26um%3D1" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=h...</a>

And spot toning doesn't actually reduce body fat from any certain area. What you need to do is burn fat  with cardio exercise (yes, your body will decide for itself from where it wants to lose and how much) and then work on toning the muscles in whatever area it is you want to improve, like with ab exercise, crunches etc. It might help the look of the area, but you may always have extra fat there though.<br>  <br>  I'm in the same boat as you actually in that I have certain parts that are just fatter than other parts, and there's no easy fix. <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, liposuction is the only thing that can actually "spot reduce."|`|8dqq0Gwwaa	You can't really loose weight in one place, but to help tone up your stomach, do crunches.|`|7c6d76780a5bd55ebca7725f217f50d1aa	Amputation.

I highly recommend joining a pilates group and asking the teacher the best way to tone your tum. <br>  <br>  Also, you could look at what you're eating. Some people have a slight intolerance to wheat and wheat products, and if you eat a lot of processed food, you'll find that you are getting a lot of wheat in things like sausages, where you might not expect it. Also, restrict your intake of dairy, and if you're worried about calcium, take vitamind D and do what the cows do that make our milk - eat lots of green leafy vegetables. Don't forget to drink plenty of water, 8 glasses a day are recommended.<br>  <br>  Cut out those nasty sweet fizzy drinks, and go easy on fried foods. Lean meat, small amounts of carbs (don't cut them out altogether, especially if you are still a teenager), and lots of fruit and veg and water spread over 5 small meals a day will work wonders. <br>  <br>  If you eat and drink healthy and in moderation, you'll look it within weeks. 
wwP3ONCFaa	Drink Up. Liquids are especially important if you have a fever because dehydration can occur. In addition, fluids can provide needed nutrients when youre too sick to eat. Thin soups are good, as are fruit and veggie juices. I recommend beet juice and carrot juice, both of which are rich in Vitamins and Minerals.<br>  <br>  Do something Sweet. Sucking on hard candy and lozenges can keep also your throat moist so it will feel better. In addition, these products contain calories that your body can use at a time when youre prolly not eating much.<br>  <br>  Warm your feet. Soaking your feet in hot water may help you if you have a headache or nasal congestion.<br>  <br>  Get some rest! You shouldn't  have much trouble following this advice, since your prolly too sick to do much else. Bed rest is essential, because it lets your body put its energy into combating the flu infection. Being active while your still quite ill weakens your defenses and leaves you open to possible complications.<br>  <br>  DO NOT take Aspirin. Medicines that contain aspirin to anyone under 21 who has the flu. Studies have shown that aspirin increases a flu stricken child's risk of developing Reye's Syndrome, a life treatening neurological.I suggest you take acetaminophen. <br>  <br>  Hope I helped|`|Rk46lIBwaa	You don't of course get flu from ice lollies!

Paracetamol will help to lower your temperature and cut down on your aches & pains.<br>  <br>  If you see your doctor he/she is likely to tell you that you must let it run its course, most do.<br>  <br>  Within the next couple of days you should start feeling better, however quite a few have reported that they are left with an irritating cough for a few weeks after.

ZkwtldYlaa	Yoghurt, cheese, and boiled chicken. Your bones need phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium while your muscles need water, protein and carbohydrates to grow. Since you are growing taller, both your muscles and bones are getting bigger and longer. Don't waste your money or your health on drugs, alcohol or cigarettes.<br>  <br>  Have the hair style that makes you appear taller. In order to appear taller, a hair style should be thin at the sides and higher up top, which can make you appear as much as an inch taller Avoid clothes with horizontal lines. Belts are horizontal so make sure you conceal it in your clothes.<br>  Avoid clothes with a tartan or checked pattern. Avoid cuffs that makes your legs appear shorter.<br>  <br>  ? Wear clothes with vertical lines or striping. Vertical lines or stripping make a person appear thinner,<br>  and thinness in turn gives impression of more height.<br>  <br>  Wear shoes that will make you appear taller. If you are a female, this should be easy since you can find a lot of female shoes with 2 or 3 inches’ heels. For males, wear shoes with thick soles to add the illusion of height.<br>  <br>  To increase your height, it is important that your blood is oxygenated as blood provides nourishment to your bones. Regular breathing will also purify your blood. There are three phases to breathing:<br>  1. Inhaling - take in air into your body through the nose<br>  2. Retaining - hold your breath inside your body<br>  3. Exhaling - blow out air from your body through the mouth<br>  <br>  It is during deep sleep that growth hormone does its job of thickening and lengthening your bones. So appropriate sleeping time (not the longer, the better) and correct sleeping posture is very important for your body to grow. Sleep is defined as a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.<br>  <br>  During deep sleep, growth hormone produced by your pituitary gland is released into your blood stream and travel through your body and causes the thickening and lengthening of your bones. Therefore, you should achieve "deep level" sleep on a daily basis in order to coordinate your affords of exercises and proper diet. The following are some helpful tips on how to easily achieve deep level sleep.<br>  <br>  Sleep in a comfortable and firm mattress.<br>  Sleep in a room that is dark, quiet and fresh smelling.<br>  Sleep with clean, soft, and comfortable clothes.<br>  Keep your hands and feet warm. Scientific studies have shown that warm hands and feet will help induce REM (rapid eye movement) deep sleep. Cold hands and feet will keep you from deep sleep.<br>  Drink a big glass of water before going to bed and when you wake up; this will help clean out your system.<br>  Practice total relaxation and deep breathing for a few minutes before you go to bed.<br>  Relax from head to toe. Close your eyes and relax every part of your body.<br>  Maintain a habit of sleeping at the same time everyday, including weekends.<br>  Sleep on your back with a flat pillow under your knees. This will align your spine properly and prevent any back aches caused by sleeping in a bent position.<br>  <br>  Undoubtedly, the quality, quantity, and type of food we eat affect our height, growth, and health. We cannot emphasize enough how important your food intake is in determining how much growth you can possibly obtain. The types of food you eat will either improve or decrease your growth potential.<br>  After careful consideration and research, the daily content of protein, carbohydrates, fats and water can be achieved if the following items were taken regularly.<br>  <br>  Carrots Fish Liver<br>  Egg Yolk Beef Red Meat<br>  Milk Cheese Apples<br>  Green Vegetables Potatoes Nuts<br>  Yellow Vegetables Almonds Bananas<br>  Peanuts Chicken Beans<br>  Peas Salt 6-8 glasses of water per day<br>  <br>  If you eat a lot of peanut butter, your height will not necessarily stop. Neither does masturbation stop height.<br>  What might stop you from growing is smoking, drugs, alcohol, lack of sleep, stress, digestive problems, or lack of exercise.<br>  <br>  Height Growth Products : The first approved natural product for height increase is Super-Growth <a href="http://www.super-growth.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.com</a> or <a href="http://www.super-growth.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.org</a> with this product it is possible to gain additional height growth even after puberty.<br>  I love Super-Growth . I've been using it as a height booster for several months now This stuff is great, It is rare for a product to live up to its advertised hype. But this one actually does. It Works as advertised. Also, this specific product advertises improved joint health. I injured my knee and could find no relief, but after 3 weeks of using the Super-Growth I no longer have knee pain.

I know that sounds odd, but, you can become more active in advocacy (to educate the public) and fundraising (for a cure), meet other people who are also dealing with diabetes (offer emotional support to them), and be there in case someone needs you (this happened to me, had I not been diabetic, there would not have been anyone at work to recognize that a coworker was crashing and already too confused to ask for help - if we'd only called 911 and not had juice in the fridge, they might not have gotten to him in time, so sometimes you just have to have faith that god planned for you to be there and use what you know).|`|24414fcc91f5304cd67eb4e1e5e9e3d2aa	Hey, I have diabetes too. But I don't think God is punishing me - or anybody else who has it - by making me have it. I think he gave it to me because he knew I could handle it. It's been a learning experience for me. I've learned how to take care of my body better. For me, it's a blessing within a curse.. Because of diabetes, I've had many opportunities that other people - without D - can never have, like going to diabetes camp and making great, lifelong friends, and traveling to Washington DC as an advocate and telling my story to the US Congress. I don't really mind the 5+ shots I took every day for the last 5 years, and now I'm on an insulin pump. Why bother resenting it and being depressed about it while you can embrace it?

f8mLpPXlaa	We don't inhale only O2.We only use O2 and it's one of only two gasses in the atmosphere that will cross the alveolar membrane. The other one of course is CO2. Air is composed of mainly nitrogen which is inert. 79 %, O2 20.97% and the rest is rare gasses like neon, argon, xenon, Co2.|`|ky3B42f6aa	You breathe in them all, but you exhale them along with more carbon dioxide.  The most prevalent "other gas" is nitrogen.  It is harmless, unless you are a diver -- in which case, it can cause "the bends" if too much gets into your blood stream.|`|o4g1v45Yaa	Simple Answer is we don't.<br>  <br>  We inhale air just like it is, nitrogen, CO2 and all.<br>  <br>  When the air gets to your lungs it has to cross into the blood, some of the gases will dissolve in the blood, others will bind to something called "hemoglobin".  The vast majority of Oxygen is bound to this "hemoglobin.  The reason oxygen binds and other gases don't is because hemoglobin is designed that way.<br>  <br>  I'm trying to think of a good analogy to why hemoglobin binds only oxygen, here's the best I've got.  Think of a goldfish net.  We use a goldfish net to catch goldfish and it works great for that.  But if you were to try and get water out of a lake with a fish net it wouldn't work, the water is to small and would go right through.  Also if you were to try and catch a whale with a goldfish net, it wouldn't work because the whale is to big and wouldn't fit in the net.  <br>  <br>  Similarly, when air gets to the blood, oxygen is picked up from the air and not anything else, because the hemoglobin is designed to pick up oxygen but not carbon dioxide, or nitrogen.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps, I'm not sure how much detail you wanted.|`|9TyEDcRzaa	your question is how is that only oxygen gets to blood when other gasses are present ---the other gasses like nitrogen and carbon dioxide also inhaled along with oxygen but when co2 is higher quantity  it is sent out during the respiration and also for the  other gasses it is the same|`|uf9pZFlzaa	You inhale air, which is a mix of oxygen and some other gases. However, you only use oxygen in your body, and exhale the other gases with carbon dioxide.
1ggESF58aa	You can develop allergies throughout your life, as well as develop immunities to allergies you once had.  My sister was allergic to peanuts when she was a baby, but eventually became able to eat them as she grew older.<br>  <br>  My guess is you are allergic to shellfish.  This is a common allergy which would explain why you can eat most fish and shrimp - as neither are shellfish.  Lobster and crab are both shellfish, so if you are indeed allergic to crab, you are most likely allergic to lobster as well.<br>  <br>  You can have an allergy test done to let you know what common substances you are allergic too.  Just be sure to mention that you want to be tested for seafood allergies as well.  If you haven't had an allergy test before, all the doctor does is prick an area of your back with many different small needles (which have traces of the allergen) and see which areas react to the allergen and which don't.  It's good to have this done every once in a great while to see which allergies you have developed, which ones you have built an immunity against, and which ones you still have.|`|NbjtZv6Maa	It's possible. I'm allergic to shrimp but I have no problems with fish, crab, and lobster. I think there is probably just something in the crab that you're allergic to. If what you're allergic to is in the lobster too, then you would be. The only way to find out is to try it!<br>  <br>  I hope I helped, have a nice day. =)|`|AA10037126	I'm allergic to crab also but can eat shrimp and lobster.|`|wdmp9eYXaa	you can develop can allergy to anything at any time in your life. and once you have developed an allergy to something it just continues to get worse the more you eat it or consume it in any form. you allergy is probably to shell fish. that would be crab, lobster. you need to stay away from these foods as the more you consume them the worse the allergic reactions become. eventually they will become life threatening to you.|`|ohAoUlPXaa	Yes you can develop different food allergies as you progress through life.  Same as you can be allergic to foods and then later in life not be.  Most likely if you are allergic to crab you will also be allergic to lobster.  Most people are allergic to seafood are allergic to any type of shell fish (crab, lobster, and shrimp).  You might however still be able to eat fish and other sea foods.

AA10299265	Depends on how you define "diabetic". I'm a typical type two and was on medication for years. Since learning how to eat properly and maintaining some daily physical activity, I no longer need any medication. I suppose if I started doing the things I did that got this whole thing started, I'd probably be on insulin by now.|`|4jOaN0WIaa	Ron, not true. I have never heard of that. Once a Diabetic always a Diabetic is correct. It's a lifelong illness.  My dad was diagnosed in his 20s and had it his whole life.|`|WiIUEObTaa	very true. once sugars are controlled . no pills , injections . you will always be a diabetic. this is just in theory. truth be known. very misused statement. the epidemic can be beaten. sounds like you have , well done.|`|8asG4WCwaa	yes.  <br>  <br>  Type 1 has no cure but can be controled with insulin.  <br>  <br>  Type 2 has no cure, but can be controlled with diet, exercise, and medication - but if you stop watching your diet and taking your meds the diabetes will be uncontrolled again.  It doesn't really "go away".<br>  <br>  While there are indeed people (the extremely obese) who can benefit from gastric bypass surgery, I would argue that gastic bypass for the non-obese diabetic is not a cure for diabetes so much as it is trading one health condition for another.  It is the surgical alteration/removal of the stomach.  People trade diabetes for other problems like inadequate nutrition and hypoglycermia.  They still have to watch their diets and worry about their health.  Some people deal with chronic episodes of vomiting, diarrhea, additional surgeries, and the need for supplements because of the proceedure.  Yes, the loose weight, but some do gain it back. There have been a few people who could not stop loosing weight, and others that have died from the proceedure.<br>  <br>   I'd rather be diabetic. Gastric bypass as a cure for diabetes is like cutting off your foot because of an ingrown toenail.  |`|iK3YYRaTaa	If you all noticed that JOHN. RYAN and Rick are all the same person.

If they were to suddenly start eating ice cream and brownies all day they would have high blood sugars. A non-diabetic could eat ice cream and brownies all day and it would make them fat and rot their teeth, but it wouldn't raise their blood sugar.  Diabetes is a problem of your endocrine system being unable to regulate and process glucose.  That doesn't go away entirely with weight loss.  <br>  <br>  Even if type 2's lose the weight and keep it off, they can still have problems when they are older because the stress of old age on the organs is also a factor. It's not dependent on weight, that's only ONE factor.<br>  <br>  So yes, even for type 2's once you're a diabetic you're a diabetic for life. You don't get to forget about how to eat correctly even when you're off meds. <br>  |`|vNbdh8feaa	Depends on what type of diabetes you have.<br>  <br>  If you have type 1, mostly common in younger ages, than that will never go away.

AA12391701	It's best to check with your local hosp. or nursing home.  They can give you idea's to help you get into the Field depending on what it is you want to do.  If your not sure yet vol. I did for two years in a nursing home before I went and got my CNT lin. I have no desire to be a nurse and am happy being a cnt and have been for 12 years. I get to be around my pts more than anyone else which is what I enjoy. If you want to be a nurse my advice is to be an aide for at least a year or two before you go any further.  Will help you get used to the setting and all the equipment you'lll run into not to mention will give you exp. dealing with the pts. and their conditions or diseases. if after 1-2 years you still want to be a nurse a lot of places will pay you to go to school if you agree to work there for a length of time after you grad.

vGxipYJnaa	Yes. Your pill is effective while on your period. It is extremely rare that a woman would become pregnant on her period regardless of birth control though seeing as a period happens when the egg is discarded from the womb.. you can't get pregnant if there's no egg to fertilize.<br>  <br>  To Emry: You're very confused. The doctor calculates the date of conception if you're unsure two weeks after your period because that's generally when a woman ovulates.. not DURING her period!!|`|2lZK5FLzaa	no it doesn't it only works when you take the pill the same time everyday because when you are a few hours late taking the pill than you are more likely to get pregnant than if yoou take it on time.  Therefore if you don't take it your risk of getting pregnant is really high.|`|1rbRp0fHaa	My ultimate advice is talk to your doctor and ask him/her.  The way a lot of birth control pills work is to give a kind of mega-dose of hormones, these cause your body to not respond the same to sex (on a chemical level).  They can also sometimes cause people's periods to either be super regular, or kind of hit and miss.  <br>  <br>  Also remember that pills are never 100% effective.  As old fashioned as it may sound, the only sure fire 100% effective method of birth control is abstinence.  I am not advising you not to have sex, I am just pointing out that you have to be careful if pregnancy is a concern.<br>  <br>  My most important advice is this... NEVER have sex with any man that you would not want to make a father.  Even if you are 100% positive that your birth control will work, don't take the chance.  :P  If you don't think he would be a good father, don't take the chance.<br>  <br>  <br>  PS: <br>  This is an edit after the fact:   This is in response to Olivia J's post. I have learned this from recent reading (I am going to be a father soon), but intercourse DURRING your period is when pregnancy is most likely to occure, especially towards the end of the period.<br>    <br>  That fact suprised me as well.  In fact if you are not sure of the date of conception, the doctor will guess two weeks after your last period.<br>  <br>  Remember, conception doesn't generally take place the day of the act, it takes place a few days after.  Also, your period is not simply the absense of a healthy egg, it is when the body is flushing the old one to put a new one in it's place.<br>  <br>  I will agree that the pill is generally effective either way.

24414fcc91f5304cd67eb4e1e5e9e3d2aa	Because not only did it have false information in it, but it was discriminative against diabetics (i.e. Oliver being called "Sugar Boy" because he can't have sugar.. isn't that a little bit like calling someone who can't walk "Cripple Boy"???). <br>  <br>  The whole episode (I saw it) was based on how Oliver couldn't have sugar, but the truth is Diabetics can have sugar. Especially Type 1s can have as much sugar as they want, as all we do is take insulin to cover the carbs. Even the T2s who take fast-acting insulin.|`|5yPw4TDfaa	the pulled it<br>  they may not show it<br>  alot of the things they said werent true<br>  theyre trying to redo it <br>  but it proably wont happen cuz if he has it now he has to have it for the rest of the show|`|sFGwOnaYaa	I don't know what the context was on the show but contrary to popular belief, diabetics CAN have sugar.  All food gets converted into sugar in the body but foods that do that faster and raise the blood sugar are the ones that need dealt with carefully.  A diabetic can indeed have regular sugar, just in moderation and with insulin monitoring.
AA11434633	I have several basal rates programmed into my pump.<br>  <br>  Right now it's infusing 0.90 units per hour.  At midnight it changes to 0.80 units per hour.

At 5:30 pm it goes back up to 0.90 units per hour.<br>  <br>  I don't know if your new to pumping, but the reason for changes in basal rate are an attempt at maintaining as near 'normal' as possible blood sugar levels.<br>  <br>  I hope you do well with yours.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|24414fcc91f5304cd67eb4e1e5e9e3d2aa	From 8pm to 7 am it's 1.35u per hour, and from 7am to 8pm it's 1.6u per hour..

be5b6f02c20b23ba0ebd00d8685794a0aa	Don’t listen to anyone that claims to be a doctor on here, or that has never had a vasectomy.  No doctor is going to give out free advice on here.  Why would he or she?<br>  <br>  His body will always produce sperm.  He will always ejaculate semen, and it will always be white.  The thickness of his semen is determined by his overall health, and has nothing to do with his vasectomy.  His semen will not contain sperm any longer because they are blocked.  That is what a vasectomy does.  You can’t tell the difference, because the sperm are far too small.<br>  <br>  I had a vasectomy twenty years ago.  I never saw any change in my semen, that can’t be accounted for by my age.  I am now 42.<br>  |`|AA11785060	I assume you have had his semen tested?  If so and it shows any sperm then the vasectomy did not work.  Only way you can tell he is producing a lot of sperm, or any for that matter is for him to have a sperm count done at a lab.  He should have had that done a month or two after the procedure anyway to ensure the vasectomy worked.  Sperm is invisible to the naked eye and you cannot tell if there is any sperm in the semen without a 600X microscope or larger. <br>  <br>  But if you are just referring to semen being produced, and have had no tests, you have no idea whether he is still fertile or not. Most vasectomies are quite successful. But that doesn't mean the guy will notice anything different sexually. He will still produce semen, and sperm cells only make up 2 to 5% of the volume of his semen so won't be missed. So from your perspective you should not notice anything different during sex.  |`|lgyPxg26aa	The testicles will still produce sperm after a vasectomy.  All the vasectomy does is cut the tube, the path for the sperm from the testicles.<br>  <br>  What he is ejaculating, if the vasectomy worked, is seminal fluid.  The stuff that now shouldn't contain any sperm.  Seminal fluid does not come from the testicles.<br>  <br>  Go back to the doctor and have his ejaculate tested for sperm content.  It should be 0.  Anything else means the vasectomy failed.|`|58gBigcNaa	This is perfectly normal, as a vasectomy only gets rid of sperm cell not the liquid semen. Basically, he's still shooting, only now he's shooting blanks. |`|7f7547ce6ae07c763915978ab531d418aa	You are talking about semen, not sperm. Sperm swims in semen but if there is no sperm, the semen doesn't care. A vasectomy stops sperm, not semen.|`|AA11962729	.is it clear or white? if its clear its ok if its white he is still producing sperm and you should send him back to the nut chopping doctor|`|BEIsFgTYaa	Sperm and semen are different things.  A vasectomy cuts the vas deferens which are the tubes that allow sperm to enter the semen.  After a vasectomy a man will still produce semen (the fluid that you see after ejaculation) but it will not contain sperm.<br>  <br>  He should have had 2 semen analyses after the vasectomy which is where the doctor makes sure there is no sperm in the semen.  If after 2 consecutive SAs with no sperm it is considered successful and he is given the go ahead to have unprotected sex.|`|5f695d303f71f12c9aae1be5319e860caa	Dumb question but are you sure it's sperm? Did the doctor tell you this when he went back for his check-up or are you referring to the discharge the sperm would be in if there were any? If the doctor told you then yes, the procedure failed. If this is your observatin you are confusing ejaculate for sperm.|`|WhBmfScHaa	lol... you got this all wrong. <br>  <br>  He is producing ejaculate fluid... not sperm. <br>  <br>  His testicles are in fact still producing sperm, but those are being absorbed by his body.<br>  <br>  The ejaculate fluid is not cut off from his sytem through a vasectomy. I had one 16 years ago and I still blow wads of man jam like a donkey.|`|bKLda8Isaa	A vasectomy is designed to eliminate the sperm, not eliminate the ejaculate itself. Semen is only 2-5% sperm (in a man who has not had a vasectomy). The rest of it is composed of sugars, proteins, fats, etc.|`|ZMph7ZQ4aa	he should have had the doctor who did it check to see if there is any sperm. I think what your thinking is he still has fluid at ejaculation. this still normal what needs to be checked is IF any sperm are present in it.|`|M66ruR3zaa	A vasectomy doesn't cause a man to stop producing sperm, all a vasectomy does is prevents the sperm from entering his urethra.<br>  <br>  If he is ejaculating sperm, then yes it was a failed vasectomy|`|gtzUU21Faa	that means it was a failed vasectomy|`|Gcjfmujaaa	he should see another doctor next time.
24414fcc91f5304cd67eb4e1e5e9e3d2aa	I would understand if it was going down because of the shower if you used insulin, but since you don't, I'm not sure. It's probably just the exercise. I know that I usually have to wait an hour after my last bolus of insulin before I can take a hot shower, otherwise I'll go low...|`|ZNbauLJzaa	It is the exercise, not the shower, that is lowering your blood sugar level.  What is your blood sugar when you wake up?  What is it a lunch time?  If your blood sugar is 140+  all day up until you exerciese that's no good.  There is nothing wrong with swallowing a pill a day to get your blood sugar down to more normal levels.  What is your HbA1c?  If your doctor is okay with you numbers, then your plan is working.|`|g288r5Mgaa	no,i do not think so.And it is said it is bad for you to take hot shower after long tern exercise for all your whole body is at a condition of exciting and the hot shower make them crazy.<br>  <br>  If your sugar level is so high,please go to the hospitall and the doctor can help.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.discount4dvd.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.discount4dvd.com/</a>|`|xTR5fL3uaa	Sugars control your sugar (glucose) levels, not heat.

24414fcc91f5304cd67eb4e1e5e9e3d2aa	No. A lot of type 1 diabetics do lose weight before they are diagnosed, but that's because their body hasn't produced insulin in a while. Weight loss is one of the latter symtoms of diabetes. The reason they lose weight is becuase insulin, which at that point they haven't had for a couple weeks, acts like a key that "unlocks the doors" to your body's cells, and lets the glucose and nutrients that you eat be absorbed by your body. Without this process, the body will think it is starving, because it practically is. It goes into starvation mode and starts eating itself (muscle and fat cells) to get the nutrients it needs.|`|pRF5LLloaa	No.<br>  <br>  In fact, losing weight is usually one of the LAST signs to develop.  Losing weight shows a very serious (potentially fatal) progression of the disease.<br>  <br>  You are AT RISK for diabetes if<br>  ..1) You have a family history<br>  ..2) You are overweight<br>  ..3) You lead a sedentary lifestyle<br>  <br>  If you are overweight, intentionally losing weight (by proper diet and exercise) actually helps prevent or delay diabetes.<br>  <br>  Diabetes canNOT be diagnosed by synmptoms alone.  You MUST have blood tests done by the doctor in order to diagnose diabetes.<br>  <br>  If you are concerned, have your doctor peform the necessary blood tests, and discuss the results with you.<br>  |`|xNkmK0SHaa	No. Actually, weight loss is one of the treatments for type II Diabetes.<br>  <br>  For very  good information, go to the web site of the American Diabetes Association.|`|ZNbauLJzaa	Nope. 
BEIsFgTYaa	I've never heard of anything being "removed with a shot."<br>  <br>  What is it and what kind of shot is he giving you?|`|HEInox5Paa	What do you mean, "removed with a shot?"

yE2vM76naa	A lot of it is mental. You got one stuck when you were a kid or something and now it unconsciously haunts you every time you have to take one. At least that was my story for a long time.<br>  <br>  Realize that every time you eat something like pizza, or burgers, or even just eaten fast, you have swallowed much larger pieces of food.<br>  Oddly enough, that helped me.<br>  <br>  Other than that - for capsules take a big sip, squeeze the capsule in, tilt your head down (so that when it floats, its towards the back of the throat) then quickly throw your head back as you swallow. Thats the only other trick I have. |`|VSFvJ3praa	Take a BIG drink of water or other liquid. <br>  Hold the pill in your teeth, place the water in your mouth, push the pill/let it float into the liquid, and swallow the liquid.<br>  It's harder with semisoft food (in my opinion) because I tend to sort food with my mouth so in a semisoft food, the solid things in it (like gummy worms in pudding) get left behind and eaten after.<br>  <br>  And chewing pills can mess with their absorption, making it too fast or not at all.|`|8pZup0z1aa	I always had that problem until i was prescribed pills that i had to take daily, but a trick i always used was break open the pill and pour the stuff into a food or something like a apple sauce and you won't be able to even tell. If it's 1 of those gel capsules, don't break it b/c it will taste bad !! lol : )|`|aEekTPumaa	well you could grind them up and eat them in applesauce. I used to do that when I was younger. Or you could crush them up and snort them. Well I guess that last one would be depending what kind of medication they are. Or you could crush them up and put them in a shot glass with soda pop or whatever beverage you prefer|`|mX2FLzsuaa	rather than swallowing them with a liquid, have a spoonful of pudding or another soft fluid food.
VSFvJ3praa	Yes, pre-ejaculate has sperm. Ejaculate just about always has sperm in it, but it's harder for most men- even young ones- to have more than three or four orgasms in a single night, and after a short while (a day or so) their sperm recharges. But as the night wears on, orgasms produce less and less ejaculate.|`|9b69f7ec8bbb37936bf7af7bfa55e317aa	Anna, its normal to be confused, after all, its not like us girls get much experience with sperm until our teens at the earliest.  There is usually some sperm in precum, but not too much.  Enough to get pregnant, just not lots.  When he comes for real there is a lot more - millions.  If he was to keep having orgasms, there would be less sperm each time, but still enough to get pregnant.<br>  <br>  When a couple is trying for a baby its recommended to have sex no more then once every day or two to keep the sperm counts high.  <br>  <br>  Another interesting point - guys usually only come once in a "session".  Sometimes twice, but it would be rare for him to orgasm more then twice when having sex - he simply wouldn't get to four or five times so its a bit of a mute point.  Most guys take a few hours to recover before they can orgasm again.|`|yKJt455Baa	Why yes that is some what true. You can tell by the color. If it's white and a bit thick then yes, there are many sperm in there. But if it is more of a liquid rather than thick mucusy goo and more clear than white, then there is less sperm.<br>  Same thing with people who are more sexually active, the more recent you last sexing was the less sperm there.<br>  <br>  But, none the less. There is sperm.|`|Iyc5vrEcaa	There is sperm in all of it and all of it can cause pregnancy, don't worry about it past that.|`|KjKqPrTnaa	I agree with the above answers... pre-ejaculate has lots of sperm, but its not really semen. Semen is expelled when he ejaculates, and that is where most of the sperm is...literally millions and millions of sperm cells per ejaculate.<br>  <br>  But I disagree on a few minor details:<br>  <br>  A young man in good health should be able to ejaculate at least 4 - 5 times in a love-making session, but each time he will produce less semen in volume and less sperm cells. Also if a couple is trying to conceive, the more times the man ejaculates against the woman's cervix, the better the chances of fertilization.  There is no need to have sex only every day or two. The more a man ejaculates, the more his body will produce both sperm and semen...so the more sex, the better the odds of conception.  He will be completely "recharged" in 24-48 hours.<br>  <br>  Semen is the white slightly sticky liquid that a man ejaculates when he has an orgasm. A young man in good health can "shoot" the semen for at least a meter (3-4 feet) in several decreasing "shots" at 0.8 second intervals, and the total volume is maybe a teaspoon full at most. Semen is a combination of sperm cells (invisible to the naked eye), protein, and enzymes to help the sperm survive an an acidic vagina and make their way to the egg.<br>  <br>  Great question, hope you've got your answers!

0jzPpMZtaa	Turn your head away.  Tell the nurse before the shot, "please don't hurt me."  Look away.  Sit still and exhale. The pain will be very short.  You will have a little soreness.

La tua autostima è abbastanza bassa e denota una certa tendenza a non credere sufficientemente in te stesso. Probabilmente a volte ti capita di pensare che gli altri siano migliori di te e che sappiano sempre come affrontare i problemi mentre tu non sei abbastanza bravo o capace. Ti succede probabilmente di provare anche un senso di incertezza a volte, e di non essere sicuro sul da farsi. Nelle situazioni sociali non sempre ti senti tuo agio; di fronte ad una situazione nuova sei spesso intimorito, anche se non sempre... A volte credi che gli altri possano giudicarti malamente ed allontanarsi da te, se chiederai loro aiuto. Se la tua condizione ti fa sentire a disagio, cerca di lavorare sull'idea che gli altri non sono necessariamente migliori e che le situazioni nuove e inaspettate possono anche fornire stimoli piacevoli e costruttivi. Inoltre non devi lasciarti condizionare eccessivamente dal timore di perdere la stima e la fiducia degli altri, in fondo chi ti vuole davvero bene non cambierà opinione su di te così facilmente.

wywO89wTaa	as someone that is coming off 2 stress fractures in my right lower leg, I might be able to help. I can't tell you if you have them or not only a docter can after doing a bone scan. Which is like an x-ray but catches much smaller fractures. If you have them or not I would stop running and rest for at least 8 weeks. 8 weeks will heal most running injuries. Don't avoid the pain. The pain is there to tell you something, and that something is that your broken. You need to rest and heal. You will not get a cast, just make sure you don't do any running or jogging for that 8 weeks. Then you can slowly get back into it. If your telling the truth and you only run 1 mile every other day it shouldn't be to hard to get back into. Make sure you change your running shoes every couple of months or 4 to 500 miles which ever comes first. Stretch all parts of your legs after running. Also when you get back into it I would start with a walk/jog program for a couple of weeks. If you can't find any on the internet I got a couple. Now all this info is the same I got for my stress fractures, we don't know that's what you got for sure. Your best bet is to see a docter. If you can't this info should help for a lot of leg injurys.|`|Lgc9SGfkaa	Hiiiiiiii....This is the web about condom quality of sexual relations and some talk about breast cancer in women.

RMmh0aimaa	It could be exceama (not sure on the spelling) which will spread when you itch it. Usually you will get like puss bubbles - they kinda look like pimples but have more runny watery fluid in them. When it gets worse there are more puss bubbles, when it gets better it forms into scabs which peel off and heal.<br>  <br>  You can get a cream for this called Celestone M which will clear it up in a couple of weeks, but you will have to see a skin specialist as the cream is prescription only.|`|3bf853eb6eadae5d5e3c2aa99854d383aa	hi there! first off let me tell you that i answered you question last night. i looked it up again this morning and my answer wasnt there so im not sure what happened. so if u get 2 answers by me, sorry. <br>  <br>  anyway, based on what you said, it seems to me that we both have the same thing. mine look like grayish/brownish scabs. i have them around my nose, around my bottom lip, and on the creases on the side of my mouth (the laughter lines?). they are not as thick as scabs but definitely feel thicker than the surrounding skin. also they are very dry and flaky. usually they come off when i shower or wash my face with a facial scrub. but once they come off, those same areas where the "scabs" used to be turn red and u can see some faint blood capillaries. Im a girl and i find them so hard to cover up with makeup specialy because of their texture. <br>  <br>  I went to the dermatologist so that i could treat it and he said it was acanthosis nigricans. BUT even after i lost some weight, i had the same difficulty covering them up and they did not fade even the slightest bit. During that same visit to the derma, i had acne and he put me on accutane. while i was on accutane, the marks went away completely but came back after about 2 months. Im sure that time interval was related to the accutane because that is how long it takes for the accutane to leave your system after your last pill. when i saw it coming back, i went with another derma and she made me get a chemical peel. i was so happy when i saw the results but they literally only lasted for 1 week! when i saw them coming back, i pretty much lived with the marks and hid them with makeup but then i started getting acne again so i went back with my 2nd derma and she put me on antibiotics. my acne cleared up completely and so did the marks. now i have been off the antibiotics for about 2 months and the marks are coming back. im really tired of having to deal with them and they feel uncomfortable when theyre dry. im planning on going back to see my 2nd dermatologist and focusing only on the marks now that my acne has been dealt with. <br>  <br>  im not a dermatologist but ive been doing some research of my own based on my experience and the appearance of the marks and i think they might be seborrheic eczema, psoriasis, and/or signs of insulin resistance. based on what ive read, insulin resistance seems to be related to seborrheic eczema so im trying to follow a diet that consists of foods with a low glycemic index along with my daily exercise. you can find a list of foods with a low glycemic index online. my advice to you is to see a dermatologist and hope they have an easier time diagnosing your case. next time i see mine, im going to tell her about what i have found out. maybe it will help her, maybe it wont, but the more information the better chance she has at diagnosing these marks. if u happen to find any information or if your dermatologist finds a right diagnosis, let me know. i would really appreciate it. thanks and good luck.

2IucHxm0aa	I heard your body can only digest 30 grams of protien at a time, thats why body builders need to eat all throughout the day.|`|wwRbkCMraa	There is no set number because everyone is different.  People will try and tell you all the time not to take over a certain amount because your body can't assimilate it, and that you will just piss it out.  This is false, it depends on your metabolism, your age, your daily activity level and many other variables.  <br>  <br>  Think about it like this... If there was a certain amount you could not go over then would shaquille oneil take in the same amount as jessica simpson? No of course not.  that would be absurd.  Shaquille is a giant and will need much more protein per day than and smaller person.  So he would have to consume much larger quantities of protein per sitting.<br>  <br>  Usually losing weight is simple numbers. You need to know your basic metabolic rate (BMR). Once you know your BMR then you can design a diet lower in calories than your BMR.<br>  <br>  But.... it is not always that simple. You could also have metabolic anomalies or even hormone irregularities that can make losing weight virtually impossible. <br>  <br>  Start with the simple stuff. Calculate your BMR right here <a href="http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calcul...</a>  then alter your diet if necessary.<br>  <br>  Now, if you don't see results after that you may look into the hormonal or metabolic areas. Also make sure you are being realistic, and that you do have weight to use. Don't forget... celebrities use tons of drugs and have personal trainers!

bxxwhP04aa	I have taken Lexapro for several years.  It took about six weeks or a bit longer, to kick in.  To tide me over, I also took small doses of klonopin.  When the Lexapro began to help, I dropped the klonopin.  Your doctor should be able to help you like this,  Ask him about it.|`|uKmNYqGgaa	It'll take a couple weeks for you to start feeling the Lexapro starting to work, and four to six weeks for it to reach its fully effective level.<br>   <br>  When you're first starting on Lexapro, you can have "break-in" side effects, that go away after four weeks or so.  They are sometimes not the same in different people.  I had very bizarre and vivid dreams, but after a few weeks they were gone.<br>   <br>  I found (by experimenting) that the best time for me to take my Lexapro is with dinner.  I sleep the best at night, and I'm more awake the next day.|`|sjwbntNcaa	SSRIs usually take about a month or two to kick in, although Lexapro is a bit more fast-acting than others. It does take about three weeks to a month to feel any effects. <br>  <br>  It's unfortunate that anti-depressants take that long to be effective, but once they finally do kick in, most people notice a night-and-day difference. <br>  <br>  Hang in there!|`|x7IWoB3faa	SSRIs work little by little.  When I had my first major depression, it kicked in by the 14th day completely.  You're still on track.<br>  <br>  When I began taking it, I had lost all interest in everything I did, could not eat and completely impaired.  I just wanted to stay in the room.  A complete opposite from my normal personality.<br>  <br>  Little by little I was able to get back.  Take your dosage regularly every day.  You may experience though bowel irritability as your body adjusts to this medicine.<br>  <br>  What was the dosage given to you? You'll be on it at least 6 months.  Eventually your doctor will taper you off.  Don't stop abruptly as this may hinder your recovery.<br>  <br>  All the best.  My hugs to you.|`|RyZXJU1Aaa	SSRI's usually take 2-4 weeks to reach peak effect.

7AUqSr4uaa	he shouldnt smoke around you.<br>  he should go outside. <br>  it is selfish of him|`|o2FJIXS9aa	It is EXTREMELY hard to quit smoking once a person is addicted. My parents quit together in their 50s and I have made attempts but always go back. For smokers, smoking is stress relieving. I bet your dad has a lot of worries on his mind in the kind of economy we have right now. You could suggest that your dad smoke in a certain room in the house or go outside. You could ask him to join a smoking cessation group, get help from a doctor. It takes a strong will to stop smoking, and some people need help from nicotine patches or other meds. If he does not want to quit, then the best thing to do would ask him to smoke in a certain area that you don't have to go in.|`|HUrYSp4oaa	ur right that the smoke can prolong yr colds even worse u could get cancer from the passive smoking. he is very selfish to a) smoke when he has kids and b) smoke inside.  u dont mention yr age so i dont know how well ur able to stand up to him but if ur a teenager then u should tell him u dont want to be around him when he is smoking and refuse to be in the same room. good luck.|`|2OS6mq6Saa	If he smokes around you it's bad,<br>  passive smoking is worse than smoking itself nearly, you might get lung cancer|`|btIvC1esaa	YES
un0C52G8aa	I've had crowns fall off. It's usually caused by improper mixing of the cement used to glue the crown onto the stump. In the case of one of my teeth, the tooth below did have a root canal but there was a stump there. The crown was cleaned and glued back on. I haven't had any problems with it since. You should see the dentist as soon as possible because there is a space caused by the missing crown and it can cause the teeth around it to start shifting. It can cause the tooth directly above or below it to stick up or down farther than the teeth around it. It can also lead to other problems such as decay or cracking of the tooth since it is much weaker than it once was. You might even end up having to get the tooth pulled. I had this happen to another tooth. The tooth had a crown with pins attached that extended down into the root shafts. Over time, it started coming loose until I was able to reach in and remove it, pins and all. There was virtually no tooth left so I had to have what was left of it extracted. Since it was all below the gum line, it was a surgical extraction that lasted over a half hour.

Anemia sometimes can go undetected or not. Doctors will suggest you go through lab tests to confirm if you do. And they'll also ask about you about your medical history - if it runs in the family, then of course, there is a greater possibility that you just might be anemic (-since you mentioned that you had it back when you were younger).<br>  <br>  The most common type of lab tests include:<br>  <br>  CBC (complete blood count) -which measures the amount of the components that make up your blood. <br>  <br>  This test checks your hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. Hemoglobin is the iron-rich protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to the body. Hematocrit is a measure of how much space red blood cells take up in your blood. A low level of hemoglobin or hematocrit is a sign of anemia. CBC also checks the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in your blood. Abnormal results may be a sign of infection, a blood disorder, or another condition. <br>  <br>  Serum Iron test - this test reveals if your blood has either too much or inadequate iron <br>  <br>  Blood Peripheral Smear - your blood will be examined to check the size and shape of your red blood cells - Anemic patients have smaller and paler rbc's compared to that of a healthy person<br>  <br>  And of course, you will also go through a physical examination -<br>  is your skin pale or yellowish? Is your skin, tongue, gums or nailbeds  pale? <br>  <br>  Do you tire easily? <br>  <br>  -tried my best to explain it the easiest way I can, hope this can help you out. =)

YifhZGtyaa	to loose body fat you need to burn the fat, so whatever you eat you need to excersize excessively, but not way too much, and you need to do it day after day or your body won't rest and instead of increasing your metabolism, it will slow down even more in order to retain energy.<br>  <br>  <br>  Diet isn't that important (as long as it's a normal diet and not rediculus) all you need to do is to excersise day after day (leave 1 day to rest) and when eat, eat a little and often.<br>  <br>  <br>  Common mistakes :<br>  <br>  Less food :<br>  <br>  Less food means your body will eventually slow down burning cause it will learn that it will receive energy (food) in X hours of X amount so the metabolism will go down in order to preserve energy. Main reason why crash diets don't work and fat is never lost, it's water and muscle.<br>  <br>  Exercise daily :<br>  <br>  If you work out on a daily basis then you're overusing your energy supplies and your body will do the reverse. Due to too much energy loss your metabolism will go down in this case too.<br>  <br>  What is needed :<br>  <br>  You can eat anything, as long as it isn't excess. (like don't eat 500gr of chocolate or 6 hamburgers).<br>  <br>  A diet program should be like this :<br>  <br>  <br>  (assuming this is your hour of waking up)<br>  <br>  8: am : Big breakfast<br>  11 am :small brunch (a fruit or half a sandiwich)<br>  2 pm : medium lunch (3/4 of a normal portion)<br>  4 pm : fruit/veggie salad<br>  6-8 pm : half a dinner<br>  10 pm : 1 fruit (if that's the aprox time you sleep)<br>  <br>  This helps your body know that since energy is going to come within the next hours, it won't store energy and your metabolism will go up.<br>  <br>  Exercise.<br>  <br>  Any exercise is good, but it should be day after day, like<br>  <br>  Monday : exercise<br>  Tueseday : rest<br>  wednesday : exercise<br>  thursday : rest<br>  <br>  and so on.<br>  <br>  This way, your body won't be alarmed for excessive calorie loss and won't start storing fat.<br>  <br>  I used to be obease (140 kilos)<br>  and i currently am 55 kilos, i didn't starve and i lost all my weight in a year and a half.<br>  <br>  <br>  However, if you're hoping on a miracle thing, then it won't happen.

For example, I have lost 18lbs since the beginning of January, which is 1 stone and 4lbs.<br>  <br>  There are simple easy things you've gotta do which is using less butters and oils whilst cooking, and cutting down on that odd chocolate bar you might have once every few days. Eventually, after a few weeks, aim to not snack at all. Yep, it's really hard but you've gotta try hard, so think of something that will really motivate you, like thinking about what you could look like after a few months if you stay away from bad foods, and if you do eat it, how bad you'll feel after. Do not EVER eat after 7pm. If you really wanna be good then don't eat after 6pm. But 7pm is the complete latest. It doesn't matter how healthy the snack is, don't eat it. The only thing going into your mouth after 7pm is water.<br>  You should also drink lots of water in the day. Usually, when your stomache is telling your brain you're hungry, you're just thirsty!<br>  <br>  Exercising is a lot easier than people make out. I do aerobics in my bedroom and it's easy. Just get an iPod or MP3 and move! Even have a little dance around. Or, if you don't have an iPod or MP3 player, play music out loud. Whatever you choose to do, just move!<br>  I also go on a 20 minute walk every day. Remember that even a little bit of exercise is better than no exercise.<br>  Then of course, do the simple things that'll burn even just a few calories. For example, if you get a bus often, then walk to the next stop and then get on the bus, or if the journey isn't that far, walk the whole way. If you drive to a lot of places then park further away from your destination and walk. During lunch breaks go for a little walk, even if it's just for 15 mintues, it's better than nothing.<br>  <br>  Chew gum. It'll keep your mind and mouth focused on something other than food, and if you buy an expensive gum, then you'll feel guilty about just throwing it in the bin, and you'll try and get as many chews as you can from it. I understand about eating from boredom, so try and find something really fun to do while you're at home!<br>  <br>  Good luck, and feel free to email me if you need any more tips! <br>  <br>  :)|`|wTy2p2wPaa	Not really, But I need to diet too. So if you could help me also.<br>  I only know you can go to 'weight watchers' and they help you there. They basically give you a book and on each day it tells you what to eat only. So say on a Monday it would tell you to only eat egg, pasta and stuff like that. Then on Tuesday it would tell you to eat vegetables and or fruit. It's so simple and basic. For exercise just walk more, Jog more and you'll see the difference. Also go to a gym, Works wonders!|`|1OnUfhifaa	Eat less and walk more...its working for me!!|`|3Y00AC7Zaa	You must decide to really take control of your life and be accountable to yourself. I distract myself when I want to snack on rubbish and I clean my teeth as soon as I want to eat when i am not hungry. Something in the minty toothpaste kills the cravings. Write a food journal every day and write down what you eat and what you want to achieve. Drink loads of water and Dont snack. Buy a shirt or something that you want to fit into and hang it up where you can see it. It will help you to visualise your goal. I drink green tea as well. I think it helps me lose weight. I walk every day and listen to my Ipod with my favourite music on it. Once I start walking and hear my songs, I can walk fo alot longer.|`|MyC8G7hyaa	find a hobbie that keeps you active. dont buy the food that you binge on.|`|UWO7SVVeaa	Do not eat high fructose corn syrup! it's evil!|`|LPO8RlVdaa	Forget about losing weight. Just adopt a healthy lifestyle.Eat a good healthy diet and excercise a lot!!! The more excercise you do the better!<br>  <br>  For a healthy diet, you need to be eating small to medium meals regularly. 4 or even 5 times a day. Each meal (apart from breakfast which should preferably be fibre rich), should contain a balanced ammount of carbohydrates for energy, (from potatoes, rice and pasta, etc) protien (from fish, chicken, occassional red meat is fine, soya is good too) and plenty of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants (simple fresh fruit and veg). Eat like this and make sure you are well hydrated (fruit juice is as good as water, any fluid counts, but some fluids have negative effects too, such as alcohol or caffiene rich drinks.)<br>  <br>  Now for the science bit: Protien is essential for repairing muscle and keeping the muscle you do have healthy (this includes your heart, lungs, brain etc). You naturally lose the ammount of protien you have throughout the day (through urine etc) so this needs to be replenished regularly on a daily basis.<br>  <br>  Carbohydrates are essential for energy. You won't be able to function without it. It also regulates body fat and glucose etc.<br>  <br>  Vitamins and minerals are obviously essential for a variety of reasons. For normal growth and development, for the healthy maintenance of the cells, tissues, and organs that make up our bodies, and also to let us efficiently use chemical energy provided by food.<br>  <br>  You can have a wide range of healthy meals with this, from Thai, Chinese, Italian, British, Indian, etc. Just make sure each meal contains balanced ammounts of these three. On the bright side too, fresh veg and rice and pasta is a lot cheaper than crappy junk food!<br>  <br>  This doesn't mean you cant have chocolate or pizza/takeaway/etc, just save them as very occassional treats.<br>  <br>  The big secret to keeping a healthy weight and staying healthy is EXCERCISE, particularly cardio excercise. <br>  <br>  Cardio exercise includes any form of excercise such as running/jogging/swimming/cycling etc that gets your heart rate pumping and you sweating and out of breath. It will not only burn calories and reduce your body fat levels, therefore making you 'slimmer' by having less fat on you, but will also improve your resting heart rate and lung function, making you healthier. <br>  <br>  I cannot understate the importance of cardio excercise. It is this which will basically burn the body fat off you. <br>  <br>  But you have to remember that once you have shed a bit of fat you have to have a nice toned body underneath the fat to show off. <br>  <br>  Strength training will help you strengthen and tone your muscles. This is done with the use of weights or by free training.<br>  <br>  There are essentially (without getting overly complicated) two types of strength excercises based on different types of muscle fibres depending on wether you want to build size, bulk and power, or just 'tone' up the lean muscles an get more muscle endurance.<br>  <br>  Heavy weights with short reps/sets will build your fast twitch muscle fibres and build size, power and strength. Imagine big guys at the gym lifting heavy weights. <br>  <br>  But if you use light to medium weights with lots of reps/sets you will excercise your slow twitch muscle fibres, you wont build size, but you will tone up your body and train muscle endurance. This will obviously make you 'look' healthier and more toned, but will also increase your metabolism (as your muscles demand more energy) so you will burn calories faster. These muscles are also excercised a lot with cardio workouts (i.e your leg muscles when running).<br>  <br>  Your arms for example, will need bicep curls and tricep dips using weights and reps of your choice (heavy - low reps, light - lots of reps) and also shoulder excercises such as holding the weights at your waist and lifting them perpendicular to your side or in front of you, etc etc.<br>  <br>  Your stomach will need excercises that cover the entire torso. Leg raises for your lower ab wall, crunches, sit ups and planks for your upper and all over ab wall, oblique twists for your sides and superman stretches for your lower back for example.<br>  <br>  These are just basic examples, there are literally hundreds of excercises, but it is impossible to show you on a site like this, get a trainer at your gym to show you some but remember the basic rules of muscles and weights. <br>  <br>  As far as excercise goes, you should aim to strike a balance between cardio training and strength training, this way you will build good strong and toned muscle, but also keep your body fat levels down and increase your heart and lung performance, making you much fitter and healthier.|`|CciXZNYraa	Here are a few tips;<br>  <br>  WHEN to eat for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Eat (at least) three times a day. <br>  Because when you eat only once a day, your metabolism gets slower than it already is! That's the main reason. Sounds funny, but to lose weight... you must eat (the right things, of course) <br>  ? Eat low-fat, high-fiber foods such as salads and vegetable pastas.<br>  ? Your last meal should be before 18:00. Try. <br>  OK, one apple after 18:00 <br>  ? Don't starve <br>  Starvation is not good for losing weight, nor your health. <br>  Starvation is the worse thing you can do in a weight loss diet. <br>  ? Try oatmeal instead of cornflakes for breakfast--eating oatmeal can help reduce cholesterol levels, and its high fiber content will keep you full longer.<br>  <br>  WHAT to drink for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Drink 6-8 glasses of water every day ! <br>  Can be tap, plain, mineral, sparkling. I just love mineral sparkling water! <br>  This improves your bowel, reduces the "hunger" sensation, and hydrates your skin. Your skin will look much better after the first weeks! <br>  Don't believe the slogan "water makes me fat". Besides being stupid... you might get into serious troubles with your kidneys. <br>  ? Drink ONLY natural juices, freshly squeezed! <br>  Don't drink Coca Cola, Pepsi, and Sprite etc. during the diet. Even lite or light versions. <br>  ? Avoid those vending machines by carrying around your own healthful foods and leaving pocket change at home.<br>  <br>  Exercise for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? If you want quicker results - exercise would be good. <br>  ? Don't just sit in front of the TV and eat peanuts... <br>  I guarantee THIS won't work for your weight loss... <br>  ? Start a regular exercise program and stick with it. Don't be afraid of those sweat suits and Lycra pants! <br>  ? Start swimming. Swimming is an excellent exercise to get involved with, since it increases blood flow and uses muscles we don't regularly use. Start a swimming program and try to do it 3 times a week. You will feel excellent and rejuvenated.<br>  ? Choose an exercise program that you enjoy, and don't shun the unconventional. For instance, did you know that regular vigorous dancing is exercise too?<br>  ? Also Cardiovascular exercises such as running, jogging, or aerobics will help you lose that unwanted belly fat. Weight training can also help you lose body fat because the more muscle mass you have, the more ability your system has to burn body fat.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!
y4SUDnpaaa	One of the worst things to do when you're depressed  or experiencing low self esteem is to be around someone toxic to you..........someone like your friend.  I think this 'friend' is toxic to you.Since she's decided to focus her attention on this 20 year older man, it's the perfect time to back out of your relationship with her. When she calls tell her you are too busy looking for work and you really don't have time for anything else. Whatever you have to do to get her out of your life.|`|oLCPlFnXaa	You probably don't need the feelings of guilt of telling her to shove it up her *** in your current state - Just try and avoid her.

If you want to find out if a person is in the normal/healthy weight range you should find what the person's BMI is.<br>  <br>  You can calculate your BMI if you know your height and weight. If you do an on line search of 'BMI calculator' there are sites that will calculate your bmi for you and tell you if you are in the underweight/normal/overweight range.

1e63b80d38152437aa4b300a3f84c6f9aa	Testicles are located in the scrotum below the penis. The scrotal sac is the exterior structure that protects the testicles by ascending or descending according to the temperature.<br>  <br>  Undescended testicles are found in about 1 per cent of boys and usually it is only one testicle that fails to descend into the scrotum, but in some cases both may be affected.<br>  <br>  In many cases an undescended testicle will come down of its own accord within several months of birth, but it rarely does this beyond this timeframe. <br>  <br>  The main cause of undescended testicles is due to failure of the hormones (released from the mother and from the testicle itself) to provide the stimulus for the structures leading to the testicle (the spermatic cord) to lengthen sufficiently to allow it to fully descend down into the scrotum. <br>  <br>  Another reason is that sometimes a normal testicle can be prevented from descending due to fibres that obstruct its passage and cause it to remain in the groin. <br>  <br>  An undescended testicle is only serious if left untreated as it will not be capable of normal sperm production and can cause infertility, and there is also a risk that an undescended testicle may develop testicular cancer later in life.<br>  <br>  Treatment involves an orchidopexy operation to lower the testicle into the scrotum. <br>  <br>  Surgery is carried out within the first few years of life to give the testicle the best chance of normal development. If your pediatrician is aware of your  condition all that is required is that you are currently monitored so you can have surgery at the appropriate time.|`|AA10232591	anytime someone throws you a ball and you  don't catch it ?|`|AA12131829	i guess when you are too weak to bowl...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  :D<br>  <br>  <br>  lol idk?!!|`|05a9381724baee6ca4d50b9ad46dc7d8aa	You are born that way.  They do not have to "drop."  If you happen to have your testes inside your body, that situation would have been spotted at birth and attempts made to correct it.  If you currently have your testes in your body and one in your scrotum, you got lots of problems not and in the future.  Testes need a cooler environment to be productive.  Inside the body is too warm for sperm production and potentially bad for any sperm development.  If that is any guys' case, they should seek medical attention.|`|1ce4c527b288f01a36bf64f87dfcbae9aa	At no age my dear.|`|2d8716867bb461af44d3acc310edd3d1aa	Your Balls dropped when u were born, "balls drop" is a term for when ur not acting like a kid and ur growing up|`|AA10513491	92|`|4e535cc1cf5b355cea460daf61dac0a9aa	They should drop by the time you're five or six years old.  The testicles need to be outside the body (in the scrotum) so that they can produce sperm normally.  Also, the incidence of cancer in undescended testicles is much higher than in those in the scrotum.<br>  <br>  Sometimes in small boys the testicles will go up inside the body at times (when it's cold), but also come down into the scrotum when it's warm (like during a warm bath).  That's normal, but by age 5 or 6 they should stay down in the scrotum.  <br>  <br>  There is a very simple surgery to correct undescended testicles.

Have you been eating your nutrients every day?  These are all things to consider, but as everyone else has said, 8 months is a very long time to not have your period.  You're probably not pregnant (assuming you would have figured that one out by now).  It's unclear as to whether your period will start on the same day or not because you haven't had it for 8 months.

You should exercise with sufficient intensity to raise your pulse rate, which in turn speeds up the fat loss process. The exercises that bring your heart rate close to your targeted heart rate will boost your metabolism, which will lead to fat loss.Besides, making you look better, weight loss offers hosts of other health benefits. When you reduce 10-15% of your weight, your chances of suffering from heart attack, diabetes as well as cholesterol levels go down.

1PXkhhzQaa	Unfortunately, there is no commercially available reversible male contraceptive except a condom.<br>  <br>  The myth that vasectomy is completely safe has fueled its acceptance to the tune of 500,000 vasectomies per year in the United States and 40,000 per year in the U.K.<br>  <br>  Despite five biopsy proven studies showing testicular damage over time with vasectomy (dating back to 1985) and seven post-vasectomy survey studies showing chronic testicular pain after vasectomy in up to 15% of men, vasectomy is quite popular.<br>  <br>  If it weren't, the research on reversible hormonal contraceptives for men would likely have yielded a useful option for men besides condoms and vasectomy. It turns out that if a man takes testosterone shots (monthly) that 75% of men become azoospermic (have very low sperm counts). If you add a progestin, the number goes above 90% and becomes as effective as condoms (90%). This option has not been made available to men due to concerns over efficacy. It is not as effective as vasectomy (99%).<br>  <br>  Hopefully, more research will be done on hormonal contraceptives for men that will reduce the number of vasectomies. Vasectomy has been reported to cause other problems in addition the those mentioned above, and the informed consent process is flawed as it does not mention these possible bad outcomes.|`|H2IqzG12aa	They are working on drugs to accomplish this, the equivalent of the birth control pill.  It's still experimental I believe.  Some vasectomies are reversible.  One method implants a tiny mechanical valve that can be later turned back on.  However, there are always risks that the reversal doesn't work (just as there are risks that the vasectomy doesn't "take").<br>  <br>  Better stick to condoms, etc.|`|4f89b1327da974e89f726a89dddc619faa	There's not much he can do aside from using a condom or a vasectomy (see <a href="http://www.malecontraceptives.org)." rel="nofollow">http://www.malecontraceptives.org).</a> It's pretty much up to you to decide which form of birth control you want to use if he won't use a (male) condom.|`|B667elmWaa	A vasectomy can be reversed.

Half of that being the stronger drug Dexedrine. Half life, I think, in the non-SR about 4-6 hours.<br>  <br>  DEXEDRINE<br>  I’ve been "ON" this drug for three years now.

6ead76b7bae238ffd19b67542dae60eeaa	Okay, for the 100th time, you lose weight by changing your diet and exercising. Green tea can be part of your new diet, but it does not MAKE you lose weight...|`|AA11649438	It depends on what else you actually do, what you eat and what your starting weight is. <br>  <br>  Green teas to avoid are those that come bottled and are sweetened with corn syrup. These are actually just another high calorie soft drink that still offers the anti-oxidant properties of green tea, but not the weight loss.<br>  <br>  The best green teas are those you brew yourself from loose leaf tea (the kind that isn't in a tea bag, and isn't all crushed up into tiny bits). Preparing loose leaf green tea is a bit of a commitment, one that can be enjoyable due to the ritual of preparing and steeping the tea.<br>  <br>  Most people prefer the convenience of tea bags. But, tea bags just don't offer the same taste and some of the properties are lost.<br>  <br>  Still if you're lazy, there are some unsweetened bottled green teas that are drinkable.<br>  <br>  The green tea dieter will drink two to four cups (6 oz each) per day for the maximum benefit. Exactly how the green tea helps in losing weight is thought to be a couple of factors, 1) drinking more helps, just as drinking more water would help, 2) green tea increases metabolism, so you burn more calories, 3) green tea suppresses apetite, so you eat less, 4) green tea soothes and calms so you produce less cortisol (the stress hormone) so your get less fat.<br>  <br>  Drinking green tea instead of soda and making no other changes - other than relaxing and enjoying the tea experience, caused me to lose one to two pounds in a few weeks. However, I was inspired by the experience and started eating more fruit, then more veggies, then more sleep, then exercise and I shed 40 pounds and have kept them off for over four years. It all started with green tea.|`|bhx1Brnpaa	If all you do is drink green tea and do not eat, then yeah you will lose weight, but then you would be hungry and end up stuffing your self and gain more weight then you lost in the 1st place.<br>  <br>  I think the idea behind it is that the caffeine speeds up your metabolism, but this is simply not true. From my experience if you are controlling your appetite and what you eat to control your weight, ANYTHING with caffeine will make you more hungry and you will eat more. Eat more gain more. I do not think that is what you want.|`|btn4U0Nfaa	My friend bought a green tea and she said it works for her because she was fat and now, she is skinny. I don't know what kind she used though.|`|e551190519334efe3a842c3af5dd2c4baa	It doesn't necessarily make you lose weight. I drink green tea everyday just because it's full of antioxidants and that helps flush your system of impurities and even fat. Also, it can reduce your appetite. Anyways, even if you don't lose weight it is still good to drink because it's good for your body and more fun to get hydrated opposed to water.

384addac3bd109ce34b6a4811df9ff02aa	Ciao a te e tutti...<br>  <br>  Questa me la devo segnare... Il sale finisce sugli addominali?? Bisognerebbe chiedere a qualcuno di riscrivere tutti gli studi effettuati sino ad ora sugli effetti negativi del cloruro di sodio (sale).<br>  Caro Nicolò, senza offesa; capisco che tu abbia una certa esperienza in palestra, visto che da anni frequenti tale ambiente, ma da li a dare consigli e sentenze su cose che non conosci...<br>  Il sodio è un composto presente in molte derrate alimentari, come per esempio il sale comune. è necessario per gli esseri umani mantenere l'equilibrio dei liquidi nel metabilismo. Il sodio è necessario anche per il funzionamento di muscoli e nervi. Troppo sodio può danneggiare i nostri reni ed aumentare la probabilità di alta pressione sanguigna.<br>  La quantita' totale di sodio che una persona consuma ogni giorno dipende da individuo ad individuo e da cultura a cultura; alcune persone consumano solo 2 g/giorno, altre fino a 20 grammi. Il sodio e' un elemento essenziale, ma la quantita' necessaria e' soggietta a controversie.<br>  Questa tesi è sostenuta dalle più autorevoli fonti scientifiche. Nulla compare su accumuli addominali causati dal sale.<br>  <br>  Dopo questa lunga premessa, rispondo a "dariprincipessa". Per eliminare fianchi e per un addome piatto, non è sufficente una sola tra le tante soluzioni. Efficaci sono invece i vari rimedi associati, ovviamente con la supervisione di un professionista, i risultati oltre ad essere assicurati sono privi di rischi che spesso si tendono a sottovalutare...<br>  <br>  Per fare questo bisogna conoscere come operare, ma ancor prima è necessaria una conoscenza più approfondita di vari aspetti, ma soprattutto personalizzando una risposta giusta per te.

Ma fem m'accepte comme je suis et je cherche des amants aimant les femmes rondelettes, tout le monde est ainsi content-e !<br>  <br>  l'impact sur les adolescentes et -cents : je l'ignore, n'étant pas en contact avec des jeunes, j'espère qu'ils savent distinguer le bon grain de l'ivraie des médias et autres para?tre.<br>  <br>  ciao et à bient?t|`|1c9296e6faf3b8c9383350294700bb70aa	sur les adolescentes certes il y a de l'impacte car c'est a cette age commence le snobisme en ce qui me concerne je ne suis aucunement heurté je crois en ce que je crois et je suis comme je suis pour moi c'est se sentir bien dans sa peau qui est importante rien d'autre grosse ou mince a notre mort y aura pas de différence|`|6V9R1wnBaa	Faut éviter ce genre de magazines qui ce font beaucoup de fric sur le dos de la crédulité des jeunes filles et des moins jeune parfois,,,<br>  * perso je lis plut?t les journaux plus de texte et moins d'image, c'est plus intéressant|`|KIvxSCYUaa	je ne lis pas (ou plus) ces magazines. rien que la page de couverture m'énerve avec tous les gros titres plus débile les uns que les autres ! je suis complexée depuis l'adolescence, mais aujourd'hui j'arrive  à m'accepter et je peux dire que je suis bien dans ma peau, mais il y a encore des jours ou c'est pas vraiment ?a et si par malheur je tombe sur ce genre de magazine je culpabilise ! il faut être parfaite (enfin comme dans les magazine ) pour être dans la norme, si tu es un peu trop ronde, trop mince, trop petite, trop grande ... tu es hors norme ! mais qu'est ce que la norme ?! !! chacune femme est différente et ce qui peut être un atout pour l'une et un défaut pour l'autre. <br>  pour finir, ce genre de magazine devrait plus parler de recettes pour être bien dans ces basquette plut?t que de régimes alimentaires  !!!|`|Scy4EE7zaa	Oui,mais en même temps je ne me retrouve pas du tout dans ces images qui refletent l'anorexie et l'esclavagisme du corps : la maltraitance subie au nom de la bêtise humaine !!!<br>  Je pense à ces ados anorexiques qui se bousillent la santé.

Ils poussent vraiment les gamines à la maigreur avec ces images là... et les plus rondes à la dépressions|`|a1dfdZfaaa	Quand on est bien avec soi-même et qu'on se respecte, je ne pense pas que ces magazines exercent une quelconque pression.

Je trouve qque maintenant ce sont les médias qui en font trop avec la maigreur et l'anorexie. Attention, je ne dis pas que l'anorexie n'est pas une affreuse maladie, mais faut pas accuser els magazinzs de tous les maux..C'est toujours plus agréable de regarder un beau corps mince qui un corps gras avec des bourrelets, soyons réalistes, après c'est sur qu'il faut pas mettre de filles squelettiques mlais perso, je trouve poas qu'il y en est beaucoup dans les magasines. Et pour tous les régimes..., les ventes de ces magasines sont bonnes, c'est donc que ca intéresse toujours autant les femmes!<br>  Perso, je fais 1m65 et mon poids ou je me sens bien que j'ai réussi a avoir après ma grossesse est de 50kg. Hier j'ai vu dans un magasine qu'avec ce poids je suis considérée comme anorexique!! Alors que tous le monde me complimente, même mes médecins (gyné et généraliste)<br>  A part ma belle soeur (qui faisait récemment 106 kg donc tous le monde traduit ca par de la jamousie) qui s'amusait a raconter que j'étais anorexique!!<br>  Pour les adolescentes,la encore les médias ont bon dos, si elles sont fragiles psychologiquement, c'est pas de leurs fautes, faut arrêter de prendre les gens pour des cons, tous le monde y compris les ados, sont capables de prendre leurs décisons. Pendant mon adolescence, jamais de telles images ne m'ont choqués, mais plut?t la bétise humaine a laquelle il faut toujours un coupable, même a une maladie psychologique.<br>  Pour les ados, ce serait plut?t la bétise des garcons de cet age, qui notent les filles et sont cruels envers celles qui ne sont pas parfaites, c'est plus dur de se faire traiter de grosse ou bien pire (même si elles le sont pas) par les garcons de son école que de regarder des photos!
OnvzTiDUaa	Allora, il dimagrimento è, in sostanza, una riduzione della massa grassa(tessuto adiposo).<br>  <br>  In pratica l'organismo consuma le scorte di energia che aveva accumulato sottoforma di grasso.<br>  <br>  Questo avviene quando la fonte energetica preferenziale (zuccheri) scarseggia e l'organismo deve ricorrere quindi ai lipidi per sostentarsi.<br>  <br>  Si può ottenere il dimagrimento con una dieta (riducendo la quantità di energia introdotta con il cibo l'organismo deve attingere alle riserve) o con attività fisica (l'organismo consuma grandi quantità di energia).<br>  <br>  In effetti sudando sì ha un consumo di calorie ( e quindi un dimagrimento) perchè il corpo consuma energia nel processo omeostatico termico, ovvero nel mantenere costante sui 36-37° la propria temperatura.|`|uSwUEBgqaa	Normalmente per dimagrimento si intende la perdita di peso corporeo, perdita di peso che può derivare sia dallo smaltimento di liquidi che dallo smaltimento di grassi. Nel primo caso, con la perdita di liquidi, si ha una diminuzione di peso ma è anche più facile riacquistare i chili persi. Questo avviene con la sudorazione - sia quella indotta dalla pratica sportiva che quella ottenuta con l'utilizzo di particolari indumenti (come i pantaloncini per sudare) - ed anche con la perdita di liquidi che si riscontra non appena si inizia una dieta. Nel secondo caso, invece, a venir smaltite sono le riserve di grasso presenti nel nostro organismo. Per vivere noi abbiamo bisogno di energia, questa energia è costituita da zuccheri e grassi; gli zuccheri sono quelli che usiamo subito, i grassi sono quelli che immagaziniamo per riserva. Quando con la nostra alimentazione immagazianiamo più riserve di energia di quante ne spendiamo, ecco che il grasso si accumula. Per smaltire queste "scorte" in eccesso si consiglia la dieta - per assumere meno calorie di quelle che si consumano, e andare a intaccare così le scorte di ciccetta - e l'attività fisica - per consumare maggior energia rispetto al solito e consumare così le scorte - ed è questo il dimagrimento più efficace e duraturo nel tempo.<br>  Ciao!|`|XrByvwp0aa	Sudare non fà dimagrire.<br>  <br>  Nel sudore non ci sono tracce di grasso.<br>  <br>  Il grasso viene consumato SOLO quando le calorie<br>  consumate sono maggiori di quelle introdotte.<br>  <br>  Fine.|`|OR0RD0ICaa	Vivendo consumiamo energia... l'energia viene accumulata nel nostro organismo sotto forma di ATP. <br>  <br>  Per semplificare al massimo e dirla magari anche in modo forse non del tutto corretto, ma certamente di più facile intuizione per tutti (visto quel che chiedi, penso sia meglio parlare così)... L'ATP viene immagazzinato come riserva energetica (tra le altre cose) nelle cellule adipose (di grasso) e in forma di glicogeno (carboidrati o zuccheri). Quando facciamo dei lavori, ci muoviamo, e in ogni attività che compiamo, l'organismo utilizza questa riserva... Accede prima alle molecole di glicogeno e, quando queste non bastano più, accede anche alle cellule adipose... Il glicogeno viene costituito a partire dai carboidrati (pane, pasta, patate e simili); il grasso appunto dai grassi (condimenti tipo olio, burro, parte grassa delle carni, latticini, ecc). In modo semplice e semplificato al massimo puoi renderti conto anche del perchè  è più facile smaltire zuccheri (e carboidrati) piuttosto che gli accumuli di grasso: prima accedi al consumi degli uni, poi in un secondo momento e con più fatica agli altri...<br>  <br>  Quando vengono consumati questi ATP? il consumo di energia viene detto anche consumo calorico... perchè si misura in calorie... Semplicemente: muovendoti e facendo attività "bruci" più calorie e accedi alle riserve di energia (glicogeno prima e grassi poi) del tuo corpo. Si chiamano calorie non a caso: con l'attività aumenta di fatti la temperatura dei muscoli. <br>  <br>  Spiego meglio: i muscoli per attivare il ciclo dell'ATP e accedere all'energia hanno bisogno dell'ossigeno... che viene portato dal sangue! Facendo attività serve più ossigeno e quindi più sangue (ecco perchè il cuore batte più forte e respiri più velocemente)...  Il sangue è caldo, e questo meccanismo fa sì che si surriscaldi maggiormente l'intero organismo... <br>  <br>  Il sudore è la reazione a questo aumento di temperatura. Immagino che l'estate, quando fa molto caldo... ti sarà capitato di giocare a gavettoni, di buttarti acqua fresca sulla testa mettendola sotto una fontana... Il corpo col sudore fa la stessa cosa: espelle acqua per "raffreddarsi" un po'... Il sudore altro non è che acqua mischiata a sali minerali (tipo gatorade!)... Non ci sono nè glucidi (glicogeno, glucosio, carboidrati), nè grassi, nè tantomeno perdi calorie... quindi non è vero che il sudore fa dimagrire... Non serve a niente coprirsi e soffocare la pelle per farla sudare di più! Anzi, è molto meglio tenerla libera ed aerata per far sì che il sudore non ristagni su di essa, ma evapori e consenta ad altro sudore di uscire...<br>  <br>  Non dimagrisci sudando... ma facendo attività fisica! Poi sudi anche... ma non è quello che fa dimagrire!<br>  <br>  Mi scuso per i "puristi" per le semplificazioni e il linguaggio poco tecnico, ma spero che così abbia capito molta più gente e soprattutto sbirui!|`|Wp2HYSxIaa	se si suda non si dimagrisce. si perde peso. pero' si perde una parte magra del corpo e che va reintegrata. dimagrire in se se lo prendi come perdere peso allora sudare fa dimagrire. se invece consideri la perdita di grasso, allora per fare avvenire quello ci sono molti modi. il modo ideale e' quello di avere una dieta bianciata con pochi cibi processati e il giusto equilibrio di nutrienti. cosi come l'hai fatta questa domanda e' infinita! nel senso che poi si puo parlare anche di perche esiste l'effetto yo-yo o perche' le diete non funzionano....

qRp1pb2yaa	Les 3 principaux artisans du recul sans précédent des libertés en France:<br>  Nicolas Sarkozy (ex-ministre de l'intérieur), Patrick Devedjian (ex n°2 du ministère de<br>  l'intérieur auprès de Nicolas Sarkozy et militant de groupes neo-fascistes dans les années 70) et Dominique Perben (ministre de la justice, et auteur des "lois Perben")<br>  La loi "Perben 2" a été adoptée par le Parlement le 11 Février 2004. Le Conseil national des barreaux (CNB), qui représente 40.000 avocats fran?ais, avait appelé l'ensemble de la profession à la grève le jour du vote à l'Assemblée. Fait exceptionnel, les 181 batonniers de France, représentant l'ensemble des 40.000 membres de la profession ont participé à cette action de protestation. Les avocats sont appelés à "sauvegarder les libertés fondamentales menacées par un texte dangereux pour la République et la démocratie". Les magistrats dénoncent une loi "contraire à la Constitution, aux principes constitutionnels et aux engagements internationaux de la France".<br>  La loi Perben prévoit notamment:<br>   La possibilité d'installer des micros et caméras dans un domicile privé<br>   L'allongement de la durée des gardes à vue jusqu'à 4 jours et sans possibilité de faire appel à un avocat pendant les deux premiers jours (au lieu d'une intervention de l'avocat dès la première heure). Une garde à vue de 4 jours est aussi un outil puissant pour faire "avouer" n'importe quoi à une personne. En 4 jours, il est possible de faire un chantage en privant la personne de nourriture ou de sommeil, ou en l'entassant avec 10 autres prisonniers dans une cellule de 10 mètres carrés (pratique courante aux USA).<br>  La banalisation du recours à l'infiltration et au témoignage anonyme, en d'autres termes à la délation.<br>  <br>  La Loi Perben institue aussi une nouvelle procédure semblable à ce qui se pratique déjà aux Etats-Unis: la formule du "plaider coupable", qui introduit une procédure opaque en matière de délits financiers. Si l'accusé accepte de plaider coupable, le jugement par un tribunal est remplacé par un entretien à huis-clos entre l'accusé, son avocat, et le procureur qui décide seul de la peine. Contrairement aux juges qui sont indépendants, le procureur est sous les ordres du Ministère de la Justice. La formule du "plaider coupable" est dénoncée par les magistrats car elle va permettre au gouvernement d'étouffer plus facilement les affaires de corruption et les malversations financières. <br>  <br>  Sans procès, avec une procédure entièrement contr?lée par le procureur, les médias et le public ne seront plus informés des scandales financiers qui impliquent des entreprises ou des partis politiques.<br>  Aux Etats-Unis, John Ashcroft, le ministre de la justice de Bush) s'est prononcé en faveur du principe des arrestations préventives dans le domaine du terrorisme comme dans celui de la délinquance. <br>  En France, Nicolas Sarkozy s'est lui aussi déclaré favorable à ce principe.<br>  <br>  Encouragés par Nicolas Sarkozy et par les nouveaux pouvoirs que leur a donné les lois Perben, les policiers multiplient les abus, sévices, ou actes de torture, parfois à caractère sexuel.<br>  Par ailleurs, toujours plus de personnes sont envoyées dans les prisons surpeuplés, pour des motifs de plus en plus dérisoires (au nom de la "tolérance zéro"), le plus souvent sans procès (en "détention préventive"), ou au terme d'un procès expéditif (jugements rendus en moins de 5 minutes par les tribunaux de "flagrants délits" et les "juges de proximité", ou avec la procédure du "plaider coupable" aux Etats-Unis).<br>  En plus de la privation de liberté, les personnes emprisonnées doivent subir une promiscuité digne d'une prison du tiers-monde, ainsi que la violence des autres détenus. Etre condamné à la prison en France, ce n'est pas seulement être privé de liberté comme le prévoit la loi; c'est aussi une condamnation à être régulièrement tabassé ou violé sans que les gardiens interviennent (faute d'effectifs suffisants), et à voir sa vie définitivement brisée.<br>   Un désastre qui peut désormais arriver à n'importe quel citoyen, pour une simple infraction à la sécurité routière.<br>  <br>  Nous assistons actuellement à une dérive inquiétante du Droit pénal. Plusieurs nouvelles lois visent un même but: condamner le citoyen ordinaire à des peines d'emprisonnement, même lorsqu'il n'a commis aucun crime...?<br>  <br>  C'est aujourd'hui une évidence pour tout le monde qu'il existe deux poids et deux mesures, selon que l'on soit riche et puissant, ou que l'on soit un citoyen ordinaire. <br>  dans la loi Perben 2 par ex: on peut écoper de 2 mois de prison pour un simple excès de vitesse même sans accident, alors que des hommes politiques et des chefs d'entreprise bénéficient de l'impunité pour de graves affaires de corruption, détournement de fonds, malversations, ou encore pour des crimes contre l'environnement.|`|3ee04c13fd800dccf823454f60bfe1d3aa	Protéger l'Homme, telle est la véritable voie... <br>  <br>  Entretenir la dualité, "ceux qui se lèvent t?t" et les autres, "la racaille" et les autres, toujours opposer une personne à une autre, telle est la voie du faschisme emprunté le plus fréquemment par la droite.<br>  <br>  Philippe|`|S6pcUFp6aa	Parce que Nicolas prone la tolérence zéro  !!

Also, you could try a diaphragm or a cervical cap, although they both need to be fitted by a doctor.<br>  You also might want to try the female condom, which could give him more sensation than a male condom.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I think all barrier methods are smarter than hormonal methods like birth control pills or the patch. Better for your health.|`|AA10135392	Have you tried the Female Condoms? They're probably the only other OTC method that can be trusted. Male condoms are the most effective, with the exception of prescription birth control.  Female condoms are basically a reversed male condom. They seem awkward because you put it inside of the vagina instead of onto the penis, but they would probably be more comfortable for the man if he has a problem with male condoms.  They are certainly more expensive, but it's better than going without a condom at all. If they irritate him, why not try a non-latex kind like polyurethane or lambskin? See the second link for a list of non-latex brands. If he's complaining that they're too tight, try larger brands like Trojan Magnum and Magnum XL. If he STILL complains, he's probably just trying to get you to go without protection, which is an absolute no-no.

If you do, throw em out and start over b/c burned garlic in this is REALLY gross. Add 1/2 c of the broth and turn the heat to low and let simmer for awhile, about 15 minutes or until the broth has evaporated mostly. [You should start the water for the pasta now.] <br>  By this point, the garlic should be soft enough to crush with the back of a wooden spoon. Crush about 3/4 of them like this. Add the rest of the broth, the sliced up tomatoes, the chopped up onion, and the herbs.<br>   I've actually never measured out the herbs I put in, so you should taste the broth and see how you like it. Wait a couple minutes for the tomatoes to shrivel up, add more pepper, and turn the heat off.

yqy5xfSbaa	i had the same thing at the beginning of the school year...it turned out that I was nervous for school, because it wore off in about mid september. i know it's near the end of the school year, but are you nervous for something? If you're not nervous, i still am not hungry in the morning, so i just don't eat. Do you eat right before you go to bed? That could be it. Or, it could be the time you get up. I get up to go to school at 6 AM, which is way too early for me, and im not hungry then. But on the weekends, i wake up around 9 or 10 AM, and when i wake up then, i'm RAVENOUS. i think it just depends on the time you get up.|`|Mf2f7uU9aa	some call this: "nervous stomach"|`|sPtRjRBEaa	Hello <br>  <br>  I get this as well and i am not really sure why but i think its because we don't eat very much.

Your concern is quite common.  To satisfy you and your dentist, a simple computer generated picture with a before and after image, allows a very simple solution for both you and the dentist.

hIZBkhDWaa	It all depends on what you eat.<br>  I highly recommend a bowl of oatmeal with some almonds in it. Because you won't get hungry again for a long time, because it takes a long time for the oatmeal to digest.<br>  <br>  Another good tip is that you eat 24 almonds a half an hour before you eat your regular meal. Or, 12 walnuts. This is enough to stimulate to your brain that you are "not hungry". So, you won't be eating that much the next meal or not even be hungry.|`|e1d94deb080d8b4c7483f211efa55159aa	Have you grown big ears, bucky teeth and a cottontail yet?|`|SN1PDNSTaa	let me tell you something, eating enough is not good, it regulary food, but not junk food, or fried food, eat something helthy that can also make you feel with 100% energy, don′t look at your weight, because the measurement of wieght, is not good, because first of all, it also measures your muscles, your muscles can wait more, which makes you think that you are too fat.

Confusion often arises because the name "daddy longlegs" is also applied to two distantly related arthropod groups: the harvestmen (which are arachnids but not spiders), and crane flies (which are insects).<br>  <br>  Contents [hide]<br>  1 Appearance <br>  2 Habitat <br>  3 Diet <br>  4 Systematics <br>  5 Misconceptions <br>  5.1 Most venomous? <br>  5.2 Not spiders? <br>  6 Gallery <br>  7 See also <br>  8 References <br>  9 External links <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Appearance<br>  Pholcids are fragile spiders, the body being 2–10 mm in length with legs which may be up to 50 mm long. Pholcus and Smeringopus have cylindrical abdomens and the eyes are arranged in two lateral groups of three and two smaller median contiguous (together) eyes. Spermaphora has a small globose (round) abdomen and its eyes are arranged in two groups of three and no median eyes. Pholcids are gray to brown with banding or chevron markings. Curiously, the shape of the Pholcus and Smeringopus's body reflects that of a peanut shell.<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Habitat<br>  Pholcids are web-weaving spiders and are distributed worldwide. They hang inverted in messy, irregular, tangled webs. These webs are constructed in dark and damp recesses, in caves, under rocks and loose bark, abandoned mammal burrows and undisturbed areas in buildings and cellars, hence the common name "cellar spiders".<br>  <br>  The web has no adhesive properties but the irregular structure traps insects, making escape difficult. The spider quickly envelops its prey with silk and then inflicts the fatal bite. The prey may be eaten immediately or stored for later. When removed from their webs, pholcids are rather clumsy, and walk with an unsteady, bobbing action.<br>  <br>  When the spider is threatened by a touch to the web or when too large a prey becomes entangled, the spider vibrates rapidly in a gyrating motion in its web and becomes blurred, almost invisible, and for this reason pholcids have sometimes been called "vibrating spiders". Doing so might make it difficult for a predator to see exactly where the spider is, or may increase the chances of capturing insects that have just brushed their web and are still hovering nearby [1]. If the spider continues to feel harassed it will retreat into a corner or drop from its web, and leave the other alone.<br>  Misconceptions<br>  <br>  [edit] Most venomous?<br>  There is an urban legend stating that daddy long-legs spiders have the most potent venom of any spider, but that their chelicera (fangs) are either too small or too weak to puncture human skin; the same legend is also repeated of the harvestman and crane fly, also called "daddy longlegs" in some locales. Indeed, pholcid spiders do have a short fang structure (called uncate). However, brown recluse spiders also have uncate fang structure, but are able to deliver medically significant bites. Either pholcid venom is not toxic to humans or there is a musculature difference between the two arachnids, with recluses, being hunting spiders, possessing stronger muscles for fang penetration.<br>  <br>  Pholcid venom has never been scientifically tested on mammals. This would normally require milking the spiders and injecting the venom into humans or mice. In any case, there are no known cases of a pholcid spider ever biting a human and causing any serious effects.<br>  <br>  In 2004, the Discovery Channel show MythBusters set out to test the daddy long-legs myth (season 1, episode 13 "Buried in Concrete"). After measuring the spider's fangs at approximately ? mm (average human skin thickness is about 0.10 mm) the show's host was apparently bitten, although the bite produced little more than a mild short-lived burning sensation. This appears to confirm the suspicion that pholcids can penetrate human skin, but that their venom is practically harmless to humans. Additionally, recent research has shown that pholcid venom is actually relatively weak in its effects on insects as well [5].<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Not spiders?<br>  Another misconception is that the daddy long-legs spider is not a true spider. This misconception arises from the multiple uses of the name daddy long-legs. It is the harvestman (which is also called daddy long-legs) which is an arachnid but not a true spider. The daddy long-legs spider is a true spider.|`|vfdyo8rHaa	It sounds like a Daddy Long Legs and they are not poisonous and I don't think they even bite.

ZpsVx7YHaa	Carissimo, rispondo volentieri alla tua domanda. <br>  Il fenomeno di cui parli si chiama POLLUZIONE NOTTURNA. Te lo descrivo, come sicuramente lo hai vissuto tu:<br>  sogni di fare sesso con una donna<br>  sogni del sesso orale<br>  sogni di mastirbarti<br>  sogni una stimolazione del pene<br>  <br>  e tutto ciò si risolve con un orgasmo forte e con l'immediato risveglio.

VlTGV9DUaa	Calamine lotion!!!<br>  its amazing<br>  u can get it in the tube and its like thick cream or in a glass bottle and its more watery (its light pink)<br>  i prefer the bottle u just apply it with cottonwool pads<br>  also keep it in the fridge so its really nice & cooling!<br>  <br>  i had chickenpox and ended up crying where i couldnt sleep and it itched so bad, but my mum bought me this and it made it so much better!<br>  <br>  <br>  also this might help i got it from a site:<br>  <br>  Head for the kitchen cabinet ... then the bath. "The best home remedy to relieve the itching from chickenpox is to mix 1 cup of white kitchen vinegar, 1/2 cup of baking soda and one to two capfuls of Alpha Keri body oil in a bath," says Marian H. Putnam, M.D., a pediatrician in Boston and clinical instructor of pediatrics at Boston University School of Medicine. "After a good soak of 15 to 20 minutes, leave the bathtub and then apply Dyprotex cream, an over-the-counter product that is sold as pads or in lotion form. This relieves itching better than some of the other anti-itch formulas, and since it doesn't crust like those other drying agents, there's less chance of scarring."<br>  <br>  You can also soak a washcloth in the bath and just apply it to the face to soothe the itching, according to Dr. Putnam.<br>  <br>  <br>  Fix the itch with oatmeal baths. Doctors recommend baths using preparations such as 100% oatmeal to treat itchy skin. "I recommend twice-daily baths for patients with chickenpox, because oatmeal is nonirritating and soothing and has a slight anti-inflammatory effect," says Lawrence Charles Parish, M.D., a Philadelphia dermatologist. (Colloidal oatmeal, such as Aveeno, can be purchased in any drugstore. It is simply raw oatmeal that's been ground to a fine powder.) instead of oatmeal you can use Bicarbonate Of Soda in the water.<br>  <br>  <br>  Control the itch with an antihistamine. ''An oral over-the-counter antihistamine, like Benadryl Elixir, may help control the itching,'' says Dr. Hendley. ''But even if it doesn't, at least it will make you sleepy so he can get some of the rest you need.'' <br>  <br>  <br>  *Keep cool. English researchers speculated in the British Medical Journal that keeping patients cooler than usual might result in milder cases with fewer pockmarks. This is still in the theory stage, but Dr. Sterne has a possible explanation: "When people are warmer, they do tend to itch more, and the rushes are more prominent," he says. (And you'll note that more pockmarks appear on "warm" areas of the body, such as the armpits and groin.)<br>  <br>  <br>  *Forget steroid creams. Probably the biggest and most dangerous mistake people make in treating chickenpox is reaching for relief with an over-the-counter anti-itch cream. "Never put on a steroid cream like Cortaid, because using it may cause an additional bacterial infection," according to Henry M. Feder, Jr., M.D., professor of family medicine and pediatrics at the University of Connecticut Health Center in Farmington. "Besides that, it can make the pox a lot worse."<br>  <br>  <br>    Or try calamine lotion with phenol. This type of calamine lotion works as a topical anesthetic and can help with the itching, says Edward DeSimone, Ph.D., a pharmacist and associate professor of pharmacy administrative and social sciences in the School of Pharmacy and Allied Health Professions at Creighton University. Just dab it on particularly itchy pox. Because this product can be absorbed through the skin, you want to apply it just to the pox--not smear it all over, says Dr. DeSimone. ''Also, make sure that you don't exceed package directions, which specify that this lotion should not be used more than three or four times a day.''<br>  <br>  *Keep out of the sun!!|`|lzp70MlZaa	Take an oatmeal bath you should find it in a store if you ask.

I had them when I was an adult too and it was miserable.  Have you gone to your Dr.?  They have antiviral meds that can help decrease the time you have them and they also may be able to prescribe meds to help with the itching.   Otherwise, I remember when I had them nothing helped.  I would get desperate and take showers and baths because it would give short term relief.  Also, as you know don't itch them because they will leave big scars.  When an area would get bad I would slap them.  One more thing, it is helpful if you can distract yourself to take your mind off of them - rent some really good movies.  Good luck, I feel for you.

AA11689215	VERY good question!<br>  <br>  First, vitamins are supplements, which work in conjunction with the foods we eat.<br>  <br>  Second, not all vitamins can physically be put in one tablet without affecting other vitamins.  Calcium is a prime example.  Calcium and Vitamin D work well together, so you can find those in separate supplements.  However, too much calcium negates the effects of vitamin B complex.<br>  <br>  Finally, when a vitamin supplement says that it is "complete," that simply means that you get some of all the vitamins and minerals you need.|`|AA12007347	100% of every vitamin would be too much for your body to handle. You can overdose on too much vitamin.|`|E9qmJ2jAaa	All vitamins are like that - most adverise complete vitamins because they contain all the most important vitamins you need.<br>  <br>  I am not sure, this is just my theory, but since all vitamins seem to lack 100% of the same vitamins (no matter what brand you take, you dont get 100% of calcium and others, even calcium pills are only 60% or something like that) - anyway, it may be because eating foods in general will give you the amount needed, and you dont want to overdose on them.  I could be way off, but its my guess.|`|ipMrFfvoaa	Because they assume you are going to eat food, too. Some vitamins are bad for you if you get too much of them into your system. <br>  <br>  I think complete vitamin means a complete healthy blend of vitamin.

Sometimes women can get yeast infections with every period.  The normal flora is changed when menstrating allowing for the yeast that normally lives in all women to grow out of control.  If the pain only happens when peeing, then you may have a urinary tract infection.  Either way, you should have it checked out by a doctor.  Both conditions require treatment.

They have vaginal flushes that you can use to clean out bacterias and it may be a good idea to try one of those after your next period just in case.

You just need to get professional help with this and if you can do that then maybe you should ask that guy you like if you two can go to counseling together sometime because you want someone to be there with you when you go.

4c0a4b646f8d3922998ed3b4a2296774aa	So many times I have diagnosed myself only to find out I was completely wrong...I was simply obsessing. Maybe you are just a bit obsessive too. I had to face the fact that "everyone" has little twinges of pain here and there and wonders what it might be, but there is a difference in wondering and worrying. I am certainly not suggesting you ignore everything, but I would say it would be in your best "mental" health to dismiss small things and focus on bigger ones. Easier said than done, I know. Good luck to you. If there was something "bad" wrong somewhere, you would know. Sounds like anxiety issues...hope this helps!|`|15bf864b42b29d179db660b5250fafa6aa	You may be a hypochrondriac. Talk to your Doctor and/or see a therapist.<br>  <br>  And realize that we have VERY little control over the things in life that we could be stricken with, healthwise or otherwise. Just eat right, excercise regularly and don't smoke (oh, and wear a seatbelt!).

If you (or your parents, depending on your age) don't have health insurance, go to a free clinic.  Tell the doctor that you are having anxiety attacks and about anything else that has been wrong in the past few months.   The doctor can give you a complete physical, including: blood and urine tests; listening to your heart and lungs; checking your reflexes, eyes, and ears; checking your breasts for lumps; and performing a pelvic exam if you are sexually active.<br>  <br>  The results from these tests and exams will let you know if you need further tests or if all is well.   <br>  <br>  If the tests reveal a problem, the doctor will help you decide what to do to resolve it.  If nothing is wrong, your mind will be at ease and you will have a "baseline" against which to compare your health and test results when you have another physical next year.<br>  <br>  If you do find that you have no physical problems but still suffer from anxiety attacks, please talk to the clinic about getting a counselor to talk with.  Many people are feeling anxious and upset in these days of constant talk of terrorism and campus shootings.  You may need to talk to someone who can help you address your fears so that you can overcome them.<br>  <br>  You are a unique and important person -- you deserve to be able to take charge of your life so that you can enjoy it and live it to the fullest.  So make a call for an appointment -- and don't stop until you have one.|`|AA10326023	I'm a bit the same. It's only natural to be afraid of serious health problems and consequences thereof, but it shouldn't consume your everyday life. As long as you maintain a balanced diet, exercise, don't smoke, and drink alcohol in moderation (better still not at all), you should be perfectly fine.
rI5rPSiMaa	Do your research....because it can get pricey. I use to have bad acne and scarring. I went to a dermatologist and he recommended me to get glycolic acid peels that brings the acne to the surface of your skin. Your old skin will start to peel and new skin will take its place. I also used his cleanser, toner and creams on a daily basis. Microdermabration is also good to use after your peel sessions is over. That's when they use a vacuum like wand and scrape the dead cells off your skin....Now my skin is clear for the first time.

tQLyrr2Laa	well, It's different for a lot of people. It could be right under the cap on your glans (the rim that encircles under the penis cap.) Or you coould try your Perineum ( thats the peice on skin between your scrotum (balls) and your anus.) I just know that mine is near my Frenlunm which is that loose peice of skin on the underside of my penis. My only question for you is that have you had and nocternal emissions or and encounter with your own ejaculations yet? If not it might just be that you have not reached puberty and if not you can still attempt an orgasm but it will be dry. ( No sperm will ejaculate from the penis.)  Also while trying to ejaculate you might try to play with yourself in other areas like the scrotum or cap of penis. You could try to rub certain areas like those to increase your erotic pleasure. If you try these you might have a better chance of  gaining an orgasm and squrinting (ejaculating). Oh and try to clean up afterward... Messy stuff...   <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  (P.S.)

Dès lors, le mucus n'est plus drainé normalement, et les virus ou bactéries peuvent se développer rapidement. Les sinusites commencent donc dans la plupart des cas par une rhinopharyngite virale qui entra?ne une altération des capacités épuratoires de l'appareil cilié naso-sinusien et peuvent évoluer vers une authentique sinusite bactérienne. Les sensations de pression que peut ressentir le malade sont dues à la surpression provoquée par l'obstruction des sinus.<br>  <br>  Pour les traitements, je préconise de déterminer d'abord la cause.<br>  Les antibiotiques ou la cortisone n'est pas forcément la solution adéquate (par exemple pour des sinusites d'origine allergiques).<br>  <br>  Allez courage !<br>  <br>  @+|`|MwuDy29Taa	C'est une allergie a quelque chose qui irrite les muqueuses nasales .

7a979ac288911a4770cf2bf9d2981d18aa	I'm sorry for your medical problems...  Exclusion from medical insurance is all a matter of how the plan documents are written for your company's medical insurance plan.  Some medical insurance plans have pre-existing condition clauses which can deny you coverage.  However, if you were covered by medical insurance prior to starting for your new employer and there was no lapse of coverage or the COBRA time period for medical insurance selection has not expired from your old job to the new one, you can't be denied coverage, even if there are pre-existing conditions.  My suggestion though would be not to rely on info in this forum, but get in touch with the Human Resources person(s) at your new employer and have them research it for you ASAP.  Make sure you get a dated determination of their findings, in writing...  I hope that helps!|`|AA10120665	There are some pre existing conditions that can be cause for denying you benefits but it would not exclude you completely from the health plan.

Be sure you discuss your concerns with your human resource person as soon as you start your new job.<br>  additional:   they cannot deny claims as pre-existing if you had prior insurance coverage without a lapse in coverage of more than 63 days.  Pre-existing only applies if you don't have prior insurance.|`|37315edaefa363bb7bb622edfc30c71eaa	some can and some can't. Before changing  job I would ask to read the policy.

I hope your baby feels better soon. What you can use is a cool mist humidifier at night in babys room and if the cough is getting bad you can turn your shower on hot and fill your bathroom with steam. Sit on the toilet or floor with your baby and bring a toy or two so they don't get bored. Give them as much fluids as they will drink to keep their secretions thin. Sometimes that means you have to give them a lot more juice then you normally would! When my child was that age, I didn't use medicine unless I absolutely had to. Only if their symptoms were keeping them up or their cough started sounding bad. And of course for fevers I give Tylenol.

Due to injury or pressure on the nerve pathways supplying that area. Therefore it would seem that your Lump/Hernia is responsible. When it has been dealt with the sensation will return but may take some time to do so. So good luck and hope you get sorted out soon.

1b979f76bf6b46aa284dabac9af06299aa	doing workouts everyday is too much....work your abs out about 3 times a week. The best way to help yourself is to allow them to heal...otherwise the muscle grows slowly. Also, when your crunches become too easy, you need to put some weight on your lift, ex: holding weights against your chest so its harder to "sit up" or "crunch". Cardio is important. you need to burn the fat on top of the muscle or you wont see it! running strengthens your core as well. But swimming is just as good, and without the possible harm to your joints with running. good luck and stick with it.

It's also good that  you've gone through a "mental checklist" and determined that nothing else in your life seems to be contributing to the lower libido.  The upside of oral contraceptives is that there are many different combinations available so if there are side effects with one, your healthcare provider can choose another which will hopefully be a better match for your body.

Maybe you should try a different birth control.   the shot is convenient b/c you don't have to worry about taking a pill every day but you do have to watch for weight gain but I'm not sure if it has the same thing in it that might cause your problem, Also there is the IUD ( in uterine device) which I have now and I really like it becuase it last for 5 years and is not supposed to cuase fertility problems. Also It illimunates your period or your period becomes lighter. The procedure only took minutes with little pain and is imediatly affective. This actually helped my libido after the first couple of months.<br>   I guess the best advice I can give you is to talk to your doctor and ask him what your options are.

Como cualquier fobia, se centra en el miedo mayor o menor (suele ser grave para considerarse fobia) frente a varios tipos de situaciones, entre las que destacan:<br>  <br>  Encuentros inesperados con conocidos, familiares, amigos, etc. <br>  Reuniones sociales en las que tendrá que relacionarse. <br>  Mantener fija la mirada con alguien. <br>  Estas situaciones y otra serie de sucesos hacen que el que la padezca se sienta inseguro, acechado, incómodo, con sensaciones intensas y desagradables acerca de lo que pueden estar hablando de él (cierta paranoia).<br>  <br>  Se suele desarrollar en la juventud, después de la adolescencia. Su aparición es mucho más común de lo que se piensa popularmente, y no hay que considerar esta fobia como extra?a. Aceptarlo abiertamente en público es el mejor modo de comenzar a superarlo, para poder intentar sentirse mejor comprendido y de ese modo, aminorar la angustia.<br>  <br>  La intensa ansiedad y angustia en situaciones de desenvolvimiento social, resulta especialmente perturbadora en los jóvenes, para quienes es de capital importancia la pertenencia a un grupo o el inicio de relaciones laborales y de pareja. En un intento de aliviar sus síntomas, descubren y utilizan, una y otra vez, el efecto desinhibidor del alcohol (“voy a tomar algo fuerte para darme coraje”) y otros tóxicos.<br>  <br>  Quienes padecen de Trastorno de Ansiedad Social (también denominada Fobia Social) experimentan un temor exagerado a ser objeto de juicios negativos por parte de otros. Es por ello que evitan de modo constante un gran número de actividades de orden social ya que cuando se exponen a las mismas sufren una gran tensión y síntomas tales como rubor, palpitaciones, transpiración profusa y temblor. Las situaciones temidas pueden ser, numerosas, y en este caso se trata del subtipo generalizado (concurrir a fiestas o reuniones, conocer gente nueva, participar de peque?os grupos de trabajo, realizar conquistas amorosas) o únicas y específicas, subtipo discreto (dar un discurso, actuar frente al público, ir al ba?o cuando hay personas en el ambiente contiguo)<br>  <br>  El 39,6 % de las personas con Ansiedad Social presentan abuso de sustancias[cita requerida]. Téngase en cuenta la importancia que este dato reviste, dado que gran parte de quienes la padecen son personas jóvenes, que presentan así un alto grado de vulnerabilidad a desarrollar una adicción. Este abuso o dependencia de sustancias y/o alcohol, como una forma de automedicarse, disminuye los niveles de ansiedad de los pacientes gracias a la desinhibición que el alcohol produce. Además, estudios realizados revelaron un promedio de 32% de Fobia Social en poblaciones de alcohólicos, un porcentaje casi tres veces mayor que en la población general[cita requerida].<br>  <br>  <br>   Tratamiento  [editar]La Fobia Social suele presentar una muy buena respuesta a la terapia cognitivo-conductual (TCC), en sus variantes individual y grupal[cita requerida]. Es fundamental que los mismos sean llevados a cabo por personal altamente entrenadas.<br>  <br>  En gran parte de los casos está indicado también el tratamiento psicofarmacológico, que suele lograr respuestas donde la TCC sola no lo logra, además de acortar los tiempos de evolución.|`|de829336b49908df346b1ac99ab40ea9aa	Suena complicado.

1b979f76bf6b46aa284dabac9af06299aa	Yes, Ideally that would be how things work. But its not, and it never has. There has always been premarital sex and there always will be. You cannot just teach something to abolish an act. It may help with the frequency with which it happens, but you can never control the actions of humans. And they tell you to wear a condom because it GREATLY increases your chances of not getting pregnant or not catching a disease. So its stupid and careless not to. Like wearing a seat belt, it doesn't guarantee  that you wont be harmed or even live through a crash, but it puts the odds in your favor. And its unreasonable to believe that all people will operate under the same banner. Its unreasonable to expect all people to share your views and morals.<br>  <br>  That's Why.|`|WwL8JbJoaa	Not everybody is a Christian. And even those that are tend to not follow the no-sex-until-marriage philosophy. This is because people aren't marrying at young ages. It would be one thing if people married in their early teens like in the Bible.  But instead people are marrying in their mid-20s to early 30s. This is why it's better to teach people to use condoms... it's more realistic.  Besides, you can have sex married and still get an STD... happens all the time.|`|4d7b49142a25a7bdc3e431d39258b563aa	I understand you, but you know how our nation's all about instant gratification. No premarital sex is considered a conservative religious belief, not the mainstream practice. And since we have the separation of church and state, the government doesn't emphasize something they view as religious. Sex with condoms is not 100% safe, but at least it's SAFER. It's similar to the practice of handling out needles to drug addicts, it's best to stop the habit, but if you can't, you can at least make it safer.|`|IikIKwXGaa	great to encourage that.... but lets be real. its not going to happen. so- by teaching proper use and habit of using a condom is the next best thing. Also by preaching abstinence people think that oral or other sexual practices are not dangerous when in fact you can catch an STD from many other forms of sexual contact.  if we stop telling people to use condoms they are not going to stop having sex. should we stop telling people not to wear seatbelts because people still die in cars.... no we need to take precautions whether or not it is fool proof. a 85 % chance is better than a 50 % chance (numbers made up for point of argument.|`|NzRwnxuKaa	I agree with you on this. Yet you must know that feathers have been ruffled on this subject.  I have been looking on the site and have been astounded by the questions and the cries for help of the people that are playing house for their own pleasures.  As for the answer of separation of church and state this person does not know the history on the subject for it is not what people claim to say it is.   There are persons out there that are trying to let the younger generation know that it would be better for them to wait until marriage then to engage with passion that they are unable to control when it is awoken before it's time.  The true meaning of maturity is when we choose to learn from others mistakes and not to make them ourselves this is why we should listen to those that are older and have more experience with life then ourselves.  Yet there is a drive in us that says that we know it all and that those that are older don't know what it is to live in our culture today.  This is an excuse that is used daily, yet if the younger would really look they would find that the same thing goes on generation after generation just under a different name.  I hope that you do what you have shared with others on this site. It is not easy yet it can be done.|`|pTIheE2oaa	Use latex instead of lambskin condoms and you will be fine.<br>  <br>  Lambskin may or may not be kosher anyway.

H0uNap03aa	Sorry to say, it is normal. I am only 31 and 9 years ago my fibro started in my shoulders. I was working at circle K doing the same kind of stuff. One day I was driving home and I felt this aweful pain in my shoulders that I couldn't stand, but I just couldn't break away from it. It slowly began to hurt more days than not and more extreem pain until it became a 24 hour a day, everyday pain. I get huge knots in my muscles and as bad as it would hurt to have them pushed on, strangely it felt better. Everything I tried ( chiropractic, massage, hot compresses, stretching, accupuncture, ect) )would only help it for short periods of time. I didn't think I could go another second with this pain and it got me suicidal. I kept going to different doctors and hearing the same things," Work your muscles, don't work your muscles,stretch, don't stretch". I finally went to a pain specialist 3 years ago who gave me yucky pain meds and muscle relaxers which helped tone down the pain and make me very loopy. <br>  <br>  Fortionately, they had a machine for "Cold Laser". The first time it did nothing for me. After the second visit I began noticing a reduction in my pain for about a week at a time. You don't feel the laser at all while they are doing it on you. It basically is like someone shining a red light on your skin. After having the Cold Laser done weekly to monthly for about a year. There would be days on end where I would have hardly any pain. But, when I tried to see if my pain would stay bearable with out laser, it slowly returned, but not to the original pain intensity. You may find a doctor in your town with a cold laser machine simply by putting in the search engine " cold laser and your city name. I swear by that machine! It was the best thing that happened to me.<br>  For immediate relief- <br>  <br>  You can either cut down a towel or use a hand or dish towel. sew the three sides like your making a pillow, put inside long grain rice as a filler. Only enough to fill 1/4 to1/3 (or more if you'd like) of the inside. Finish sewing up. Now you can either place in the freezer for 20-30 min + or stick it in the microwave for seconds to minutes until the temp you want. The rice bag will hold the temp for quite a while and will mold around your body. Great for any pain or discomfort and will last forever as long as you don't get it wet. <br>  <br>  -Hot showers<br>  -Keep your stress level down.<br>  <br>  I feel for you! Good luck!|`|AA10730190	as one of the few people who truely know how painful fibro can be, I send you my deep compassion and understanding. althoughI know little about lupus,but for my fibro. somatic stretches both in the morning and before bed help me with stifness and aches.

Mon mari l'a depuis 17 ans, chez lui c'est héréditaire, sa mère nous a quitté à cause de ?a mais elle avait 87 ans, et je fais le régime avec lui depuis le début, ce qui ne m'a pas empêchée d'être atteinte aussi.<br>  <br>  Je voudrais surtout te dire de ne pas faire la même erreur que moi pour mon mari ; <br>  au début, je ne savais pas ce qu'était vraiment cette maladie, j'en avais peur et j'ai suivi à la lettre les conseils de son médecin, pas de sucres, ni rapides (ceux qu'on sent au go?t, chocolat, patisseries, etc...) ni lents (féculents, pates, pommes de terre, tous les légumes secs, pain, carottes, petits pois, etc...) bien s?r les boissons aussi, sodas, apéros, etc... un fruit par semaine...<br>  Chaque fois, la liste n'en fini pas.<br>  <br>  J'ai donc fait le régime à la lettre, en 1 mois, son taux a baissé  trop vite, il ne voyait pratiquement plus, se sentait crevé et moi je tombais dans les pommes.

ASPARTAME en poudre<br>  <br>  c) déjeuner à 12h -12h30<br>  1 petit pain<br>  crudités à volonté de préférence à l'huile d'olive<br>  100 gr de viande ou 2 oeufs sans matière grasse<br>  ou poisson à volonté;<br>  80gr de féculent (riz, pates, pommes de terre, etc)<br>  150 gr de lègumes verts<br>  une portion de fromage ( préferez les fromages à pate molle, moins gras que le gruyère par exemple) & si vous aimez essayez les "light"<br>  1 fruit, sans dépasser 120gr, pour des fruits comme raisins, pastèque, etc...<br>  <br>  d) go?ter à 16h<br>  1 fruit, avec café, ou thé, ou un jus de fruits frais, pas de jus recomposé, pas de soda même light !<br>  <br>  e) souper à 20h<br>  même chose que le midi<br>  <br>  f) go?ter 22h:<br>  un yaourt ou un verre de lait ou une tisane <br>  <br>  Il est très important de vous rappeler que le sucre existe dans le pain, dans les fruits, dans multiples autres aliments. <br>  Il faut aussi manger à heures régulières, évitez l'alcool, qui contient en général beaucoup de sucre.<br>  Ne pas manger de charcuterie, saucisses, viennoiseries etc<br>  ex: pour un pain au chocolat, 8 morceaux de sucre & 2 cuillères à soupe de beurre !!<br>  Pour une pizza, d'une personne, vendue dans la grande distribution, vous compterez 22 morceaux de sucre !!<br>  1 cuillère à soupe de Nutella, c'est 7 morceaux de sucre & 3 cuill à soupe d'huile !!...Délicieux !!!<br>  Voilà ou est le danger, ce sont les sucres cachés  dans les aliments que l'on aime grignoter, en général.<br>  <br>  Faites de l'exercice, à raison de 30 mn de marche par jour. Préférez  monter l'escalier à pieds, plutot que l'ascenseur, allez à la piscine, sortez marcher & évitez le grignotage devant le pc, la tv etc..<br>  <br>  Buvez beaucoup d'eau environ 2 litres par jour, en prenant soin de changer ttes les semaines de marques.<br>  Pas besoin d'acheter des grandes marques chères, les discounts sont très bonnes & peu chères, 29 c / 2 litres <br>  <br>  Bonne chance, il est encore tot pour vous alors prenez une bonne respiration & c'est partit !|`|5cc7832959ca4a866c05a605d033aab4aa	Bonjour, pourriez nous preciser si c est insulino  ou non insulino dependent.

baa557cef234a37bb809caadfb9425b3aa	Les fourmis dans les jambes ou paresthésies traduisent une souffrance des cellules nerveuses par manque d'oxygène. Elles correspondent à un dysfonctionnement du nerf sensitif qui innerve une partie du corps, ou de la zone du cerveau qui en re?oit les informations des terminaisons nerveuses, elles arrivent après avoir privé un muscle de sang.<br>  En prenant une mauvaise position, on comprime les veines et les artères d’une partie du corps et cela diminue la circulation sanguine :<br>  - Par vasoconstriction liée au froid ou à divers phénomènes,<br>  - Par compression des vaisseaux par une position inadaptée, <br>  - Par une occlusion des vaisseaux sanguins ou sténose due à des différentes pathologies (en général athérome lié au tabac au cholestérol à l'hypertension, ou des embolies).<br>  <br>  Le rythme de l'irrigation sanguine est perturbé et crée une surpression au niveau de la compression, puis dépression quand la compression cesse. Au moment du rétablissement de la circulation sanguine, l’uniformisation de la pression provoque ces petits chatouillements désagréables comme si des quantités de fournis vous courraient sur les jambes. <br>  <br>  Le fourmillement dans les jambes se manifeste aussi chez certaines personnes qui prennent des médicaments comme les neuroleptiques, le lithium ou les antiépileptiques et il est plus fréquent chez les personnes qui boivent beaucoup d'alcool.<br>  Certaines personnes touchées par une maladie infectieuse ou inflammatoire du système nerveux central (le cerveau) ou périphérique (les nerfs du membre atteint) peuvent ressentir ce phénomène Cela peut être également du a une hernie discale qui peut comprimer la racine nerveuse et provoquer des paresthésies des membres inférieurs, souvent accompagné de douleur à type sciatalgie ou de cruralgie. <br>  La perception des paresthésies exprimée dans le cerveau lors d’une affection psy ou une amputation peuvent aussi engendrer des "fourmillements" alors que le membre est un bonne santé ou qu’il à été amputé.<br>  <br>  Le fourmillement ou syndrome des jambes sans repos (décrit par Thomas Willis en 1685) est chronique, et même si les sympt?mes sont parfois intermittents, ils tendent à augmenter avec l'age ou en situation de stress.<br>  <br>  En espérant avoir répondu à ta question....<br>  <br>  Amicalement....<br>  <br>  PS, Suite à la réponse d'Opress:<br>  <br>  Très fréquent, le syndrome du canal carpien touche le plus souvent la femme, à partir de la quarantaine.<br>  Le syndrome du canal carpien est une affection qui cause une compression du nerf médian. Le nerf médian est le nerf qui descend le long du bras jusqu'à la main. Il se traduit par une sensation de fourmillement, des engourdissements et des picotements, puis de véritables douleurs à la main, avec souvent des irradiations vers l’avant-bras, le coude ou même l’épaule. Ces signes sensitifs réveillent souvent la patiente pendant la nuit. Ils peuvent toucher un seul doigt ou plusieurs doigts, mais ils épargnent habituellement le petit doigt. Une ou deux mains peuvent être concernées.<br>  Sa cause est anatomique. Le canal carpien est une gouttière osseuse formée par les petits os de la main près du poignet. Cette gouttière étroite n'est pas extensible. Elle est fermée par un ligament solide, le ligament annulaire du carpe. Elle contient de nombreux tendons, des vaisseaux sanguins, et un gros nerf, le nerf médian, qui assure la sensibilité et la force des 3 premiers doigts.<br>  Pour différentes raisons, l'espace peut devenir cher dans ce canal: les tendons sont durs et ne se laissent pas comprimer facilement; les vaisseaux battent et font leur chemin; le nerf, volumineux et mou, est sans défense... à part qu'il vous avertit rapidement de son inconfort: des fourmillements douloureux parfois très pénibles apparaissent dans le territoire cutané du nerf (les 3 premiers doigts).<br>  Les douleurs sont habituellement plus fortes la nuit, sans doute parce que lorsque l'on s'allonge, l'eau des tissus stockée par la pesanteur dans le bas du corps retourne dans les membres supérieurs, rendant les tissus plus volumineux et décompensant les conflits canalaires. C'est aussi l'explication de la fréquence du SCC pendant la grossesse, période d'oedème tissulaire.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.docteurinfo.com/canal_carpien.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.docteurinfo.com/canal_carpien...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.hopitalsaintlouis.org/Infos/main_canalcarpien.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.hopitalsaintlouis.org/Infos/m...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.santeweb.com/ArticlesMedecine.asp?Sid=19" rel="nofollow">http://www.santeweb.com/ArticlesMedecine...</a><br>  <a href="http://rhumatologie.free.fr/region/main/canal_carpien.html" rel="nofollow">http://rhumatologie.free.fr/region/main/...</a>|`|CUyU3ibwaa	Moi se serai plutot dans les jambes te je crois que c'est un problème de circulation.

LdUWC00faa	I recommend coconut oil for hair. Lots of Indian brands, like Vatika, produce it so you should be able to find it at your nearest Asian store. I used to have horribly bad dandruff (not just flakes,  but hardened dandruff buildups everywhere on my scalp) but then I started applying coconut oil on weekends when I wouldn't go out... then let it stay on overnight and wash my hair the next morning - and I saw the dandruff decrease immensely. Another thing you could do is apply it an hour or half hour before you have a shower. Go for it, and good luck!|`|efK2rQJaaa	i got just the thing. it alway works with me.<br>  put vinager all over your scalp then let it sit for a have an hour then wash it out and it's gone.|`|O6qCLXPlaa	This is kind of like the same answer as the other guy but it's a little bit different. A while before you go to bed put a mix of about 1 tablespoon of vinegar and 5 tablespoons of water and rub it all over your head and when your done put a towel around your head and leave it on the whole night and in the morning take a shower and rinse with vinegar water again. Or you could just take a shower and repeat again later before bed. This should help it go away. Do this for a couple of weeks and it should go away.

zQohPPH9aa	Eat 4 or 5 meals a day instead of 3 meals. For example, never eat more than 300 calories at one meal. This will give you a total of 1200 - 1500 calories per day.

However, you can find many other cheaper brands like Healthy Choice at the grocery store.<br>  <br>  NEVER drink anything other than water, tea, or coffee.

Five or more servings of fruits and veggies aren't just a good idea to help you lose weight - they'll help keep your heart and the rest of your body healthy. <br>  Avoid fad or prepackaged diets.<br>  If we were meant to eat from cans, they'd grow on trees.

cnnu1IFtaa	OK, firstly the triple test can't possibly show positive or negative, it gives you a risk. Your risk of having a baby with Down's Syndrome based on the blood test, is 1 in 400. That means that of 400 women the same age as you etc, 1 of them will have a baby with Down's Syndrome. There is no way of saying whether that will be you or one of the other 399 women, but a risk of 1 in 400 is low.<br>  <br>  They told you that the ultrasound findings were a SOFT sign of Down's Syndrome, so try not to get too worked about about it, because your blood test shows that you are at low risk.
t7zuFsdwaa	Keep an eye on this and if the pain, weakness or tingling continues it may be the beginning of DVT. A vascular surgeon can perform a Doppler ultra scan test and identify the problem.<br>  <br>  This is very painful and pain pills do not help. I have had it for over 2 years and the doctor was slow to diagnose it until I was in critical shape.<br>  <br>  Mine started with a sudden onset of calf pain and leg swelling. The pain was worse when the leg was hanging down. There was warmth to the area because the veins were inflamed.<br>  <br>  I am on coumidin (warfarin) as a blood thinner. Usually when they say 6 months, they mean for the rest of your life. The blood thinner does not resolve the current clot problem, but supposedly keeps new clots from forming.<br>  <br>  Deep vein thrombosis, or DVT, is caused by a blood clot in a muscle and can be life-threatening. Symptoms include swelling, pain, and tenderness in the legs. Risk factors include immobility, hormone therapy, and pregnancy. <br>  <br>  DVTs can occur anywhere in the body but are most frequently found in the deep veins of the legs, thighs, and pelvis. They may infrequently arise from the upper extremities usually because of trauma, or from an indwelling catheter (tubing) or device.<br>  <br>  A deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a condition wherein a blood clot (thrombus) forms in a vein of the deep system.<br>  <br>  Thrombophlebitis is a condition in which there is both inflammation and a blood clot in a vein. Thrombophlebitis can occur in either superficial or deep veins. Superficial thrombophlebitis occurs in veins close to the skin surface, and usually causes pain, swelling, and redness in the area of the vein. Superficial thrombophlebitis usually is treated with heat, elevation of the affected leg or arm, and anti–inflammatory medications. A thrombosis in a deep vein is a much more serious problem than one in a superficial vein. The reason for this is that a piece of the clot in deep vein from a DVT can break off and travel through the deep veins back to the heart, and eventually be pumped by the heart into the arteries of the lung. When this happens, the condition is called pulmonary embolism (PE). The blood clot is called an embolus (plural emboli), and the process of breaking off and traveling to the lungs is called embolism.<br>  <br>  Narcotics didn’t help my pain. I now take Tizanidine 4mg 5/day and Lyrica Cv 100       mg 3/day. This helps the nerve pain and I can walk some now. I am feeling much better pain wise.|`|v811KD7raa	my wallpaper table has legs like that|`|tNk6j437aa	Sounds like a circulation problem to me see your GP|`|RxdrkY3iaa	why are they letting you out of bed i wouldn't|`|9g8spRvPaa	If you are generally in good health, I would try eating some banana during the day.<br>  I often get charely horses itf I don't eat them when I am streching during my yoga class.<br>  Also make sure you drink enough water.|`|w29tsXLUaa	It is circulation.

NVxGp317aa	Well to recertify you need to have ex amount of continueing education and most of the time be actively working or voluntering. As for the practical portion to re cert the national you do not need to re take the practical or any test for that matter. Just have your continueing ed and or you can take a re-cert class. I would recommend get licensed in your state and region all you need to do is show proof of completion on the class and then copy of your national license. Haveing that license will actually allow you to work or volunteer as an emt in that state and once your registered in the region you will get information about classes or programs to get con ed as well as if your not working as an emt they can usually set you up with a department or company to do some ride time with. The national alone by the way just states you took the test and you passed it but you still need licensure in a state to actually be able to perform skills as an emt.<br>  Good luck!<br>  You can also check out the national registry web site and they will have all the information and forms need for reliscensure.|`|NNxLypgaaa	I do not believe that you have to be certified with your county/state to get recertified nationally. You can just stay registered until your expiry date. However, you cannot practice anywhere without county/state licensing (which is only being nationally certified and paying an additional fee). To retain a state license you have to get "continuing education" hours every year.|`|RyZXJU1Aaa	For the registry you actually need to be working to recertify as "active". You can recertify as "inactive" if you are not working and then petition for active status if you get a job as a basic. Not sure how Cali works but here in MN you don't need to be nationally registered and can work on just a state licence. Any more help send an e-mail!
SUxniVOqaa	Hi.<br>  I think the torso is generally referred to as the core along with the head.

4KfuWlrlaa	I think you're workout is fine. However, I feel if you're looking to lose belly fat you need to add a little bit more cardio to your work out. I have been exercising now for 2 months straight, going to the gym 5 days a week, either running (intervals like you) or elliptical training for 35-45 min. That has helped a lot but I really started to see results 2 weeks ago when I got a trainer and he said to add cardio to my weekends, at least 30 min each day.Working out with him as helped me switch up my routine and he gives me the push I need to do a little extra.<br>   Also you need to do some total body strength training. The ab and leg work you do are great, but make sure you keep your heart rate up in between sets. Such as doing jumping jacks or lunges. (This is what my trainer and I do) I think it really helps.|`|Rq3KgTxMaa	You can not lose fat in a specific target-ed spot, You lose overall body fat. You are right about the cardio. Interval cardio is the best way to lose weight. You should increase the resistance and time biweekly. Your other workout looks good but where is your upper body workout? You should train your whole body, (for quicker weight loss).  You need to watch the food you need and also need to sleep. Your workout looks good.|`|Ubb4RiXLaa	Your workout sounds great!

And remember that you cannot really target one area of your body for weight loss. You loose weight in the opposite order you gained it (if you gained it last in your legs, that will be the first place you loose it), no matter what part of your body you are working out. You will however, pack on the muscle weight in that one area if that is all you work out, which might make it look fatter for a while until the fat gets worked off. Try doing mostly cardio until you start to see some good weight loss, with not as much weight lifting. Then, once the inches come off, pack in more weights. And when you weight lift, try alternating different parts of your body each day (arms one day, shoulders the next, legs the next, and so on). Good luck!|`|yGWoxnDXaa	It's a good workout but you need to be doing at least 30 minutes of exercise a day to be fit and healthy so two times a week isn't too good. Try going at least 4 times or if you can't afford it go running outside.
Z8d9ipxmaa	If you don't feel physically hungry, it's because you haven't eaten for two days. Your body doesn't send hunger pangs after a while, it uses the sugar store in your liver and muscles; your metabolism slows down. You've had low blood sugar, which is probably the reason for the headaches - your body needs dietary carbs to function properly without fatigue. <br>  <br>  In order to feel hungry, your body has to be healthy enough to have:<br>  - a certain stomach capacity, it can't be too shrunken through being underweight. <br>  - a certain metabolic rate, by eating enough, minimally 1200 calories a day but ideally around 2000.<br>  - eating frequently enough, at least once everyday, but 3 meals or 6 smaller meals is preferable. <br>  <br>  You need to see a doctor, and in the meantime you should eat something with refined sugar and slow release energy combined, like oat meal with fruit or a wholemeal jelly sandwhich. But call your doctor. Good look. =D|`|AA10500537	You could have a bad stomach virus , see a medical dr, soon.<br>  you can go onlt so many days and not eat,|`|90qBWGmJaa	Get help.  That is what you should do.|`|UeUymAjwaa	i am sorry to say this but you need counselling.............eat, think of your favourite food or faourite food while growing up and eat that...or eat something, dont you dare give up on life.......some one will always be there to need you or want you even though you don't know it...you may be having a difficult time but surround yourself with friens or try to volunteer be social.....you'll hopefully get through this......please eat for me.....i dont want to see more dead people or sick people in this world, its bad enough as it is........however if u are gonna stop eating, then go live in africa and trade your spot with an african kid who you will bring here....it disgusts me when people are ungrateful.........please eat anything nutitious even though u dont feel like eating, just put that effort in......why would u feel ugly......everyone wishes they could have a better nose or eyes.........i personally wanted to be taller..i lost my dream of becoming a basketball player or model, even acting, i am afraid i wont get fans.......everyone has problems.....its how you handle them that make u succeed|`|QXhIRvgLaa	sorry but u need help and i hope for the best|`|Bt6WmLjGaa	Could you be pregnant? I heard that happens when you're pregnant.|`|69SHxWA9aa	You need to see a doctor or go to the emergency room and explain that your medications are not correct.<br>  <br>  You really need some help to avoid passing out due to low blood sugar levels.|`|P4WJD6Cpaa	Yes please get help for this. Or I am gonna be so worried.
xItxOqE4aa	Just watch what you are eating. Low carb and have some cardio  daily would help you, but loosing weight take times and effort. Don't worry about what you eat just eat less and exercise.|`|CCekEuhbaa	how tall are you? make sure the the amount of weight you want to lose it reasonable,alot of people just like to have stimulation of the mouth witch could come in the form of food cigaretts candy ect, it could be a habbit, you could be bored. but there is nothing wrong with  little snackind during the day just dont eat like ten meals,and when you are snacking eat health stuff like fruit salid,and soy chips as well as quaker rice cakes that come in flavors like cinnamon and chedar are good. anyway take care o your body if you lose weight do it in a realisyic and healthy way <br>  good luck|`|249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?|`|8RqmZ3zpaa	Hey, do you want to lose weight easily by doing nothing or get motivated to lose weight easily without even giving up half-way?<br>  <br>  The key and answer to successfully do it is in Your Subconscious Mind.<br>  <br>  The subconscious actually stores a multitude of memory patterns which will feed information to the conscious mind when activated. Data is never erased unless the subconscious mind gives that command.<br>  For example, when you walk or drive to your destination, you do it automatically without being aware of it - that is your subconscious mind doing the whole process without your conscious mind.<br>  The subconscious brain is very good at its job and works 24 hours a day on keeping us alive.<br>  <br>  The subconscious controls and regulates involuntary functions of the body such as breathing, circulation, Metabolism, Digestion, hormone balance, etc.<br>  <br>  So you may wonder.. how do you tweak or make your subconscious mind to lose weight easily?  The answer is... Hypnosis!  <br>  <br>  Hypnosis is done by bypassing your conscious mind to your subconscious mind giving instructions and storing them successfully.<br>  That is why people can quit smoking, feel extremely motivated, attain success easily, study easily and so on Successfully just after 1 session of hypnosis! Even faith-healing uses Hypnosis!<br>  <br>  My friend tried hypnosis to lose weight.  Initially, her weight was 198lbs and she lost 18.3lbs within 3-weeks!  All by natural metabolism!  And she never even change her diet but ate as normal!<br>  <br>  You will thank me because I can guarantee you Hypnosis Works!  You can just let your natural metabolism be high and Lose Fat Doing NOTHING effectively and immediately or be motivated to stop binge eating and exercise regularly without pain or laziness!<br>  <br>  Learn More:<br>  <a href="http://www.BetterLivingWithHypnosis.tk" rel="nofollow">http://www.BetterLivingWithHypnosis.tk</a>

ciz0qYwnaa	It's wrong. <br>  <br>  Yes, you are bulimic. <br>  <br>  By throwing up once, you'll get addicted to the hormones your body lets go when vomiting. So you'll do it more and more often.<br>  <br>  Instead of vomiting excercise after eating too much! It's way healthier, won't cause your throat to have problems and your teeth to turn yellow and erode (as in they started rotting), and you'll be fit and have a great body. <br>  <br>  Bulimia can actually make you gain weight. By the time you get to the toilet to puke, nearly all the calories of what you ate have been adsorbed by your organism. So what's the use?

The acid from your stomach can have severely damaging effects to your esophagus, your teeth, etc.  Also, if you abuse your gag reflex too much, you can loose it.  If this happens, it may be difficult for you to vomit when you really need to  (i.e. when your body is trying to get rid of something toxic).<br>  <br>  I suggest slowing down while your eating so you can realize you're full and not eat until you're uncomfortable.|`|E9r3Bx0Xaa	I don't think it's ok to make yourself throw up at all!

8RqmZ3zpaa	Hey, do you want to lose weight easily by doing nothing or get motivated to lose weight easily without even giving up half-way?<br>  <br>  The key and answer to successfully do it is in Your Subconscious Mind.<br>  <br>  The subconscious actually stores a multitude of memory patterns which will feed information to the conscious mind when activated. Data is never erased unless the subconscious mind gives that command.<br>  For example, when you walk or drive to your destination, you do it automatically without being aware of it - that is your subconscious mind doing the whole process without your conscious mind.<br>  The subconscious brain is very good at its job and works 24 hours a day on keeping us alive.<br>  <br>  The subconscious controls and regulates involuntary functions of the body such as breathing, circulation, Metabolism, Digestion, hormone balance, etc.<br>  <br>  So you may wonder.. how do you tweak or make your subconscious mind to lose weight easily?  The answer is... Hypnosis!  <br>  <br>  Hypnosis is done by bypassing your conscious mind to your subconscious mind giving instructions and storing them successfully.<br>  That is why people can quit smoking, feel extremely motivated, attain success easily, study easily and so on Successfully just after 1 session of hypnosis! Even faith-healing uses Hypnosis!<br>  <br>  My friend tried hypnosis to lose weight.  Initially, her weight was 198lbs and she lost 18.3lbs within 3-weeks!  All by natural metabolism!  And she never even change her diet but ate as normal!<br>  <br>  You will thank me because I can guarantee you Hypnosis Works!  You can just let your natural metabolism be high and Lose Fat Doing NOTHING effectively and immediately or be motivated to stop binge eating and exercise regularly without pain or laziness!<br>  <br>  Learn More:<br>  <a href="http://www.BetterLivingWithHypnosis.tk" rel="nofollow">http://www.BetterLivingWithHypnosis.tk</a>|`|HXpR2bw0aa	Okay, well how fast you lose weight all depends on how much you weigh at the moment. For example, if you were obese then you'd lost weight a lot faster than someone who is an average weight, or just slightly overweight.<br>  <br>  It's pretty easy to lose a stone in a few months. For example, I have lost 18lbs since the beginning of January, which is 1 stone and 4lbs.<br>  <br>  There are simple easy things you've gotta do which is using less butters and oils whilst cooking, and cutting down on that odd chocolate bar you might have once every few days. Eventually, after a few weeks, aim to not snack at all. Yep, it's really hard but you've gotta try hard, so think of something that will really motivate you, like thinking about what you could look like after a few months if you stay away from bad foods, and if you do eat it, how bad you'll feel after. Do not EVER eat after 7pm. If you really wanna be good then don't eat after 6pm. But 7pm is the complete latest. It doesn't matter how healthy the snack is, don't eat it. The only thing going into your mouth after 7pm is water.<br>  You should also drink lots of water in the day. Usually, when your stomache is telling your brain you're hungry, you're just thirsty!<br>  <br>  Exercising is a lot easier than people make out. I do aerobics in my bedroom and it's easy. Just get an iPod or MP3 and move! Even have a little dance around. Or, if you don't have an iPod or MP3 player, play music out loud. Whatever you choose to do, just move!<br>  I also go on a 20 minute walk every day. Remember that even a little bit of exercise is better than no exercise.<br>  Then of course, do the simple things that'll burn even just a few calories. For example, if you get a bus often, then walk to the next stop and then get on the bus, or if the journey isn't that far, walk the whole way. If you drive to a lot of places then park further away from your destination and walk. During lunch breaks go for a little walk, even if it's just for 15 mintues, it's better than nothing.<br>  <br>  Chew gum. It'll keep your mind and mouth focused on something other than food, and if you buy an expensive gum, then you'll feel guilty about just throwing it in the bin, and you'll try and get as many chews as you can from it. I understand about eating from boredom, so try and find something really fun to do while you're at home!<br>  <br>  Good luck, and feel free to email me if you need any more tips! <br>  <br>  :)|`|YdOyAcAAaa	Start chopping off limbs....|`|he18hGKNaa	Eat multiple small meals a day... 5 or 6 meals.  Drink TONS of water... water boosts your metabolism, and eating a lot of small meals jumpstarts your metabolism so you're burning more calories when you're just sitting around.  Definitely eat breakfast first thing when you wake up.  If you skip breakfast, your metabolism wont kick on for 3 or 4 hours into the day, which means you're wasting valuable time to lose lbs.  Exercise daily.  Situps and leg lifts are good exercises that dont usually get you too sore, but will pick up your heart rate enough to burn extra calories.  Also stretching is great.  It increases bloodflow, which increases your metabolism.  Dont eat for the four hours before bedtime.  Let your body burn off the calories from your last meal before you relax and let your metabolism rest for the night.  Take the stairs instead of the elevator, and everything you do, do it with a sense of urgency.  Most important of all, when you do eat, eat smart.  Cut all soda or sugary products.  No candy at all, limit fruits to the healthy minimum.  Theres TONS of sites online to give healthy tips to lose weight.  Also very important, dont resort to the traditional anorexic methods.  If you're hungry that doesnt mean progress, your body should remain comfortable through the day.  You shouldnt feel full and bloated, but you shouldnt feel like youre running on fumes either.  Best of luck :)

4eaf3b65b8bcd61e0c28ed377fb53935aa	You're not an idiot.  Aspergers people are usually very smart.  You're obviously very aware of what's happening to you which is the first step.  There is no cure but having therapy and social skills groups helps.  If you have anxiety or paranoia therapy or medications may help.  Talk to your parents about it.  As for the friend that isn't talking to you right now, tell him you're not sure if you did anything to hurt/offend him but you don't want to lose him as a friend.  Apologize if he says you did something wrong/hurt him.  It might be easier to do this is a letter.  If he doesn't understand then he's not worth the trouble.|`|a5f8fb915b0c89693e97dc814aba467faa	No. A diagnosis of Aspergers specifically excludes mental retardation (or, being an idiot.) People with Aspergers have average to genius level intelligence.|`|ba736945eab7fcafa5d9aea2a4781634aa	Why would you think you're an idiot? I suspect you're highly intelligent and you seem to be aware of how aspergers affects you. The problem I see is that the majority of people have no clue about it.|`|Zug1V0AKaa	I can really relate to you. I'm not sure if you've seen my other answers, but I'm a 32 year old woman with Asperger's who can absolutely relate to what you are going through. From the ages of 14 on, I had horrible self esteem, paranoia, thoughts that everyone disliked me, they didn't understand me...<br>  <br>  Friends set me up, turned on me, guys liked me...dumped me...best friends dropped me for people that I introduced them to... I was so affected by the noise of school, the social system, the work, the hours, the smells, the lights...I couldn't handle it. I graduated with a 2.7 and flunked Math! It took me years to realize how to fit in to the world, and this was with no knowledge of Asperger's, no outside help or support. I went to a local junior college and finally started to feel like maybe I fit in...just a little, but still not really.<br>  <br>  It took until the age of about 23 and after being married and having my first child to feel connected to much more than my family....but I started to connect and I worked on my social skills. I opened a little business where I didn't need to answer to anyone. <br>  <br>  I thought that I wasn't smart but the truth was that I was slipping through the cracks...no one took the time to help me learn the way I needed to, no one realized that I should have been on anti-anxiety medication.  I had terrible nightmares, waking dreams, seperation anxiety from my family....I could have flunked out of school because no one knew that I needed help, I didn't push for it because I didn't know..I just thought that I was dumb. Now I am 30 credits away from getting my BA in pre-law from Penn State. My professors assured me that I was smart and I did great in my papers and projects. I had to take some time away from studying...but I will finish some day.<br>  <br>  But guess what? I'm 32 now with two kids and a husband. It took me this long to find out why my entire life was so hard. I'm not trying to scare you, telling you that you will suffer for so many more years...but I am so glad to hear that you at least understand why you are or act the way you are. Anti-anxiety and anti-psychotic (not as scary as it sounds...) medications have changed my life. I have never felt so content or grounded. I still have the days where I need to run away and hide from the world, or give up on whatever crazy task I've thought up for myself...but I am finally happy. I have developed a strong relationship with God and I am passing on my values to my children.<br>  <br>  So...believe me when I say that most people probably do like you. Seek therapy if you must, and be open with you're mom...that is one thing that I didn't have...family support...we didn't talk about that stuff when I was young.|`|df803ac845624e37559acc061d7d047aaa	The first time I ever heard about Aspergers was from a show called Americas next top model.<br>  <br>  My favorite girl heather, she was my favorite.<br>  She has Aspergers.<br>  The other girls on the show didn't no how to understand her..<br>  She was shy and she always talked a lot about being sad because she thought she wasn't smart...<br>   But she really really was. She understood a lot about others and herself.<br>  <br>  I wanted to hug her and hold her face in my hands and say "hunny you are smart as a whip" <br>  <br>  She proved to me that even girls that have challenges can still over come them. She showed me confidence and perserverence.
e2e426c7412c57bd7f104afda806b223aa	It's not what you do but how you do it that's important. If you simply brushed 1/day but did it for 4 minutes and brushed correctly along the gumline with a soft bristled toothbrush before going to bed I would say you're doing ok.<br>  <br>  You can brush 3 times/day but if you only do it for 30 seconds each time it doesn't do you much good.<br>  <br>  Listerine is good - I use it myself and I recommend it to all my patients in the dental office I work in. <br>  <br>  Water pik - my boss recommends this to all his patients because it's great for cleaning out debris and bacteria from under the gumline.<br>  <br>  Your hygienist can recommend how well you are doing with your home care. If they tell you that you have lots of plaque then you need to change something.<br>  <br>  Flossing is not necessary, but you do have to address the areas between the teeth. Waterpik may be doing this. Or you can use a toothpick. Many of my patients never floss, don't even own floss. They use toothpicks and pick away between the teeth and gums. This can also be effective.|`|lj3e3rE4aa	Nah, this guy can help you out though:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PuZoLkvmBbc/SWAHq5OKNqI/AAAAAAAABtc/Vrblhe1AsOY/s320/Isaac+Yankem.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PuZoLkvmBbc/SW...</a>|`|AA11315360	No because you did not list flossing. Mouthwash and water pik does NOT replace flossing.<br>  The purpose of flossing is to clean sides of teeth and below the gumline to prevent bone loss which causes teeth to become loose and fall out over time. Then you have to have dentures made.<br>  <br>  You need to brush at LEAST 2 times a day (brushing more is good too) after eating breakfast, not before. And right before bed.<br>  Rinsing with mouthwash is good but alcohol free is best.<br>  A water pik doesnt actually do much so you can use it but you need to floss at LEAST once a day. More is best and do it daily.|`|GuSSIIDJaa	make sure to floss regularly. check out brytonpick.com for a quick and easy flossing alternative that makes dental hygiene a breeze!|`|6D8BI1ffaa	You really should floss at least once a day, especially if you can't brush after every meal.  I really don't know how effective a waterpik is, but flossing helps.
401ab1f5f1057ecd9a08d04d361fdf8baa	Different blood pressure meds can cause this problem in men and if you talk with the doctor that prescribed it or you perhaps he can change it to another one that is less likely to afffect you that way.<br>  You, at the age of 41, now need to have a PSA check for a baseline level.  That is the blood taken to see about cancer of the prostate.<br>  I have an idea that your mind clicks over, maybe without your even being aware of it, during relations that you may not be able to complete the act with an orgasm...that in itself does not help.  Just discuss this with your doctor and he can help you thru this.|`|Ue5NoJOgaa	Could be your prostate, I would get that checked out, and also, an erection and an orgasm are very directly related to blood flow, so if you have issues with blood pressure that is likely involved.  Also, the orgasm itself is a relaxation response in the body, so tension can be to blame for a situation like what you are describing.

I8lFqyyFaa	No, a urine fetish would have more to do with people urinating or being urinated on.  And I wouldn't put it into the fetish category unless that's what you need to get things going on.  A very full feeling is just similar to the full feeling you get ahead of orgasm.  And a full bladder can lead to increased blood flow that creates sexual arousal.|`|kDvKc3npaa	No, what it is is when you are about to have an orgasm, people liken it to the feeling of having to pee.<br>  I do that sometimes too.<br>  <br>  You don't have a urine fetish, you just like the feeling|`|OwQsCR4Saa	that's really gross...and you must get horny a lot then.|`|H3giw4QHaa	Some people enjoy that type of thing.

I went to Dr a blood test came back off a little we adjusted my diet now losing more weight and no more dizzy spells
W9zgZgKvaa	dude i know this sounds dumb but if you honestly have only done it once then it is out of you system in 3 days tops just from your daily walking around but if you really dont feel claen( and you can feel it) then get a gallon of water and pour a cap full( about 1.13 oz) of bleach in it and chug away. this only covers up the drug test it does not clean your system!!!<br>  this has worked for me countless times but everyones body is different so good luck my friend|`|RyZXJU1Aaa	If you've only used once, it is out of your system already.

Try lukewarm if you can. I did soups myself. I found the ice cream just made my jaw ache.<br>  <br>   DO NOT use a straw though. Your new crater is trying ot heal itself and the suction from a straw will cause the blood coagulated grossness to come out and therefore take much longer to heal or worst yet creat Dry socket which is painful and could be detrimental to a clean healing process. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|AA10041941	as long as your doctor told you it was safe to eat I would say just about anything but I would stick to soft foods..ice cream and smoothies would be perfect..try tommorrow and see if you can try something a little more tough!

On the good side you'll get them less often as you get older. I'm guessing you're under 30?|`|6fjMtWboaa	Canker sores are shallow, painful sores in the mouth. They are usually red or may sometimes have a white coating over them. You might get them on the inside of your lips, the insides of your cheeks, the base of your gums or under your tongue. Canker sores are different from fever blisters, which usually are on the outside of your lips or the corners of your mouth.<br>  <br>  Anyone can get canker sores, but women and people in their teens and 20s get them more often. Canker sores may run in families, but they aren't contagious. Doctors don't know what causes canker sores, but they may be triggered by stress, poor nutrition, food allergies and menstrual periods.<br>  <br>  Canker sores usually go away without any treatment. For pain relief, you can try taking ibuprofen (brand name: Advil) or acetaminophen (brand name: Tylenol). Other medicines, such as Anbesol, Orajel, Orabase and Zilactin-B, might keep your canker sores from becoming irritated by eating, drinking or brushing your teeth. These medicines are applied directly on the sore.<br>  <br>  You can also mix equal amounts of Milk of Magnesia and Benadryl Allergy liquid. After it's mixed, you can swish a teaspoonful in your mouth for about 1 minute and then spit it out. If you do this every 4 to 6 hours, your canker sores may hurt less.<br>  <br>  Some people think that sucking on zinc lozenges, taking vitamin C or vitamin B complex, using a sage-and-chamomile mouthwash or taking a lysine supplement helps their canker sores heal faster.|`|qTbfunugaa	I feel your pain literally.  I get them all the time and have been for years.  I have learned to live with them.  Chew on the other side of your mouth.  If you want a few remidies and quick fixes i have two.  Two have always worked for me.  They both came from my grandmothers.  First is the management requires some pain management.  Put alum on it.  alum is a pickling agent in a salt like form.  lick your finger then put a little alum on your finger then touch your canker sore.  It will hurt for a while then the pain will subsise.  do that twice to three times a  day and the sore will go away in two days.  Second rinse your mouth out with maylox.  simple effective pain free just takes longer.  do not mix these remindes pick one or the other.  They work on different principals.  One "drys up" the sore and the other uses a base to combat the acid in your system.  Hope this helps

That's the funny thing of life, you can never hit bottom. And when you can see that, you don't feel so stuck.

Not all patients require endoscopy, especially if symptoms begin early in life and have been stable. However, patients who have irritable bowel symptoms beginning later in life usually require endoscopy.<br>  <br>  Younger patients with persistent diarrhea may require endoscopy to look for inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis).

Changes in diet may help relieve symptoms in some patients. No diet works for all patients.<br>  <br>  Increasing dietary fiber and avoiding items that stimulate the intestines, such as caffeine, may help.

2YdNp2Ybaa	first go to your nearest chemist and get hold of some 'paracetamol plus dihydracodiene'...make sure you get this one because it will remove the pain quickly plus is would cost much cheaper to buy this than to go pay for a check up and the dentist prescribing you the exact same thing lol.<br>  <br>  someone has mentioned gingivitis above which is a good answers as it is one of the cause of pain but you will need to look close to the bit where your tooth connects to the skin (that region is called the gingival margin). sometimes this area detaches from the tooth creating pockets where plaque and caries develop. if that is inflamed and sore than you have the culpret and you sould see the dentist..<br>  <br>  also you should consider a cavity in your tooth which is distinguished by a bad smell, sometimes these cavities can reach so far and attack the pulp of the tooth (where the nerves and blood supply is) and send a rushing pain to the tip of the root which is embedded in the bone holding the tooth.<br>  <br>  I FIND IT VERY TEMPTING TO KEEP TOUCHING THE GUM AND BITING ON THE TOOTH TO FEEL THE PAIN...DONT ASK WHY LOL  just try ur best not to do this at all, but for now get them tablets i mentioned above as it will kill the pain and may also kill the caries.|`|OleVPkJgaa	GINGIVITIIIIIIS<br>  heh, no but really<br>  <br>  Early-stage gum disease (gingivitis) causes:<br>  <br>      * Red, swollen, tender gums.<br>      * Gums that bleed easily when brushed or flossed. Healthy gums do not bleed with regular brushing and flossing.<br>  <br>  Because gingivitis usually isn't painful, you may not notice the symptoms and may not get the treatment you need. If you don't get treated, the disease will progress.<br>  <br>  Advanced gum disease (periodontitis) causes more noticeable symptoms, such as:<br>  <br>      * Gums that pull away or recede from the teeth.<br>      * Persistent bad breath.<br>      * Pus coming from the gums.<br>      * A change in how your teeth fit together when you bite, or a change in the fit of partial dentures.<br>  <br>  go see your dentist, or if you dont wanna do that, then use some intense Listerine and see if it gets better :D|`|6D8BI1ffaa	Try rinsing at least after every meal with warm salt water to which you've added a little peroxide.

Just to be safe, that it is not anything else, go see an OB-GYN doctor.|`|rlDxn5CPaa	It is just because you are very active and you are probably just late in getting your peroid.

gb1XYoBKaa	THATS A JUMPING SPIDER<br>  The jumping spider is the most common biting spider in the United States. If a bit occurs, it is painful, itchy, the site becomes red, and there is usually significant swelling. Symptoms that are more serious include painful muscles and joints, headaches, fever, chills, nausea and vomiting which may last from 1 to 4 days. Follow basic spider bite treatment procedures for less serious bites and seek medical attention for ones that are more serious. <br>  <br>   Bite Treatments<br>  <br>  Treatment of Spider Bites <br>  Soap and water will always be basic step in every insect bite, which goes as well for spider bites. Cold compresses are effective to alleviate swellings and redness of the bitten skin tissue. In terms of medication, 20 to 50 mg of diphenhydramine tablets will cure the itch. But this should be taken every 6 hours. For patients who may suffer pain due to the bites, 1 to 2 tablets of acetaminophen will do to ease the discomfort.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Do not take antibiotics. It has proven that they do not really produce a remedial effect on spider bites.  <br>  Do not take ibuprofen, naproxen, or aspirin. <br>  Do not try to dissect open a wound for it may lead to further infection. <br>  Do not prolong symptoms or infections relating to the bite without consulting your doctor. Some bites need immediate medical care to prevent further complications.|`|AA10834367	Well, jumping spiders are not poisoness. If she is allergic to the bite, the bite area may swell a bit, and it may be a little uncomfortable for a few hours. She should be ok. Are you sure you made a positive ID on the spider? Jumping spiders are usually somewhat hairy and black, with a little bit of white on them. Just be sure it wasn't a brown recluse!!
x3EPqezJaa	Huh. Heat DOES lower sperm count, but that's a factor of the production of sperm. It's the testes that need to be at slightly cooler than body temperature. But once the sperm is inside the woman, then they're at 98.6, and I don't see how any heating pad is going to raise your internal temperature deep in your uterus enough to kill sperm. Your body works hard to keep your internal temp constant, even if your skin surface temp is changed by the heating pad or hot tub. The only reason those things have an effect on the temp inside the testes is that the testes are external, with a very low surface area to volume ratio.<br>  <br>  If you have sex every other day anyway, then it shouldn't be a problem because there will always be fresh sperm present.|`|nJHZQ5ylaa	its true. also you should be avoiding hot baths, as if you fall pregnant it can cause imscarriages, your partner should also avoid, mint inc chewing gum, alcohol, coffee, using a bicycle, or motorbike and tofu, or soy products.|`|fys4qM9Faa	Yes. Heating pads, hot tubs, tight underwear all reduce sperm count.

objZ18JKaa	There are three root causes of your symptoms i know because my brother had the same problems. The Dr. began with three ideas and twiddled them down to one. Hypoglycemia is a disorder in which you have to eat all the time to maintain a constant blood sugar. Anemia witch is a blood disorder  that reduces the amount of oxygen enriched cells that allow you to operate normally. The third could be the cause of your fatigue and that is sleep apneia a problem that does not allow you to breathe normally when you are sleeping so you never truly get a restful sleep. I admit i am no doctor and a doctor would have to diagnose any of these problems but i hope i was somewhat helpful in giving you some options|`|RSr4XQ5iaa	Depends.<br>  <br>  Do you eat enough?

bSqM0uYGaa	stress may be helping you gain weight, so try to eliminate some of it and get enough sleep. yoga is good for relieving stress and lengthening muscles, as is pilates. Pilates focuses on your core and tones your abdominal muscles and strengthens your back muscles. cardio is the best for losing fat, anything to get your heart rate up. like running in place, jump roping, dancing, hula-hooping, basically anything that involves moving. in gym class, give it your all. work up a sweat and you'll know you're burning off the calories.<br>  try to start keeping track off the calories you eat, you'd be surprised. cut out the unnecessary calories (right now you should be eating 1200-1500 to be losing weight). good idea not starving yourself, you'd only be depriving yourself and making an extremely unhealthy choice. limit your food intake, try to eat healthy foods (fruits, vegetables, lean meat) if you can, and drink lots of water.<br>  good luck :)
Fftw5yATaa	beauty is in the eye of the beholder!

If you are overweight to start with then the first week you may lose up to 6 pounds but after that you should steadily lose 2/3 pounds a week.<br>  <br>  Eat healthy and exercise everyday to give you the best results, but any weight loss in the month is better than none at all.

Shouldn't judge your success based on lbs lost. <br>  <br>  Anyway, to lose weight quickly, drink tons of water, and eat numberous small meals through the day.  A friend of mine wanted to lose weight very quickly for a wedding, and she cut 3 inches from her waist in a month eating 8 scheduled small meals a day.  She mapped out her day and followed it to a T.<br>  <br>  Also exercise regularly.  At least once a day do some form of exercise for at least 30 minutes.  Get a two liter bottle, and slowly go through that in water a day.  Eating healthy is the best way to lose weight.  It's not so much finding time for exercise, but instead only eating what you have to eat, and getting a ton of water.|`|c5ScseTdaa	30 pounds in one month IS extreme.  A pound is 3,500 calories, and experts say 1-2 pounds per week is healthy.  Your body couldn't withstand a calorie deficit of 3,500 calories every single day.  You'd have to lose water weight (useless and dangerous), starve, use drugs, and exercise yourself into oblivion.  If you survived and succeeded, your metabolism would be screwed up beyond any hope of maintaining a healthy weight for the rest of your life.<br>  <br>  Really, the only viable way to lose that much weight in that time frame is through surgery.  It carries risks all its own, but it's far more sane than the methods listed above!<br>  <br>  Why in the world do you have a one-month deadline for such an extreme goal?|`|gjJdoYYHaa	It can totally be done. First you have to get a personal trainer or gym membership and go every day for at least a few hours a day.

Data is never erased unless the subconscious mind gives that command.<br>  For example, when you walk or drive to your destination, you do it automatically without being aware of it - that is your subconscious mind doing the whole process without your conscious mind.<br>  The subconscious brain is very good at its job and works 24 hours a day on keeping us alive.<br>  <br>  The subconscious controls and regulates involuntary functions of the body such as breathing, circulation, Metabolism, Digestion, hormone balance, etc.<br>  <br>  So you may wonder.. how do you tweak or make your subconscious mind to lose weight easily?  The answer is... Hypnosis!  <br>  <br>  Hypnosis is done by bypassing your conscious mind to your subconscious mind giving instructions and storing them successfully.<br>  That is why people can quit smoking, feel extremely motivated, attain success easily, study easily and so on Successfully just after 1 session of hypnosis! Even faith-healing uses Hypnosis!<br>  <br>  My friend tried hypnosis to lose weight.  Initially, her weight was 198lbs and she lost 18.3lbs within 3-weeks!  All by natural metabolism!  And she never even change her diet but ate as normal!<br>  <br>  You will thank me because I can guarantee you Hypnosis Works!  You can just let your natural metabolism be high and Lose Fat Doing NOTHING effectively and immediately or be motivated to stop binge eating and exercise regularly without pain or laziness!<br>  <br>  Learn More:<br>  <a href="http://www.BetterLivingWithHypnosis.tk" rel="nofollow">http://www.BetterLivingWithHypnosis.tk</a>|`|BAeodkdTaa	Depending on your current weight (if your not obese forget it) it is semi-possible, but highly unlikely.

I just read the instructions that come with the medicine when you pick them up and it says under the precautions section to "Avoid alcoholic beverages." Thus I wouldn't take the paxil if you want to drink.
HXpR2bw0aa	Okay, well how fast you lose weight all depends on how much you weigh at the moment. For example, if you were obese then you'd lost weight a lot faster than someone who is an average weight, or just slightly overweight.<br>  <br>  It's pretty easy to lose a stone in a few months. For example, I have lost 18lbs since the beginning of January, which is 1 stone and 4lbs.<br>  <br>  There are simple easy things you've gotta do which is using less butters and oils whilst cooking, and cutting down on that odd chocolate bar you might have once every few days. Eventually, after a few weeks, aim to not snack at all. Yep, it's really hard but you've gotta try hard, so think of something that will really motivate you, like thinking about what you could look like after a few months if you stay away from bad foods, and if you do eat it, how bad you'll feel after. Do not EVER eat after 7pm. If you really wanna be good then don't eat after 6pm. But 7pm is the complete latest. It doesn't matter how healthy the snack is, don't eat it. The only thing going into your mouth after 7pm is water.<br>  You should also drink lots of water in the day. Usually, when your stomache is telling your brain you're hungry, you're just thirsty!<br>  <br>  Exercising is a lot easier than people make out. I do aerobics in my bedroom and it's easy. Just get an iPod or MP3 and move! Even have a little dance around. Or, if you don't have an iPod or MP3 player, play music out loud. Whatever you choose to do, just move!<br>  I also go on a 20 minute walk every day. Remember that even a little bit of exercise is better than no exercise.<br>  Then of course, do the simple things that'll burn even just a few calories. For example, if you get a bus often, then walk to the next stop and then get on the bus, or if the journey isn't that far, walk the whole way. If you drive to a lot of places then park further away from your destination and walk. During lunch breaks go for a little walk, even if it's just for 15 mintues, it's better than nothing.<br>  <br>  Chew gum. It'll keep your mind and mouth focused on something other than food, and if you buy an expensive gum, then you'll feel guilty about just throwing it in the bin, and you'll try and get as many chews as you can from it. I understand about eating from boredom, so try and find something really fun to do while you're at home!<br>  <br>  Good luck, and feel free to email me if you need any more tips! <br>  <br>  :)|`|VX0EvSNWaa	Have you heard about the Fat Loss 4 Idiots Meal Plan?

qJNevpELaa	I'm thinking that if none of that helped, you're going to have to wait it out. I had a horrible fever last weekend too, with extreme chills. After resting lifeless all night and hording all the hot water in the shower, I slept it off and have recovered. <br>  <br>  Fevers are there to heat up your body and attempt to kill the virus, kind of like a self induced chemotherapy or radiation of sorts.  Its actually helping you but it makes you feel horrible. Time will heal.|`|ACVUcKzCaa	you can put an ice pack on your head.|`|TJBvSA5Yaa	I have always found that when i get a fever, the best thing for me to do is to help the fever be a fever.  What i mean is help your body warm up as best you can, with out putting yourself in danger of boiling.  I usually sit in a hot tub, or put on lots of clothes and get under lots of blankets, and stay there until you begin to sweat profusely for several minutes.  NyQuil also seems to help, but i don't usually get to that point.  Drink lots of water, and let your body sweat it out.<br>  <br>  However, if you think it's something really major, get checked out by an M.D.

If you are taking just 4 mg's of this stuff, you don't really need to be on Suboxone. What he's gonna do is ween you up and get you addicted to the stuff so that you will keep him as a Dr. I would go into a detox facility and simply ween off of it altogether...it will be painful but understand this...methadone and Suboxone is the most addictive drug in the world...if you are taking just 4mgs, you don't need to be on the stuff

AA10725882	It cannot be calculated to the month, week, or day when someone will die of cancer.  No doctor knows this precisely months in advance.  Doctors make estimations based on experience because people want to know the future.  We do not know the future exactly - no doctor does.<br>  <br>  It depends which cancer it is and where it has gone.  The growth of breast cancer cells in bone may cause bone fractures, breast cancers metastatic to the brain harm brain function, breast cancers growing in the liver harm liver function, breast cancers growing in the lungs impair breathing ability, breast cancers in adrenal glands impair adrenal function, and so on.  Some women with breast cancer have metastatic breast cancer tumors growing in all of these areas at once.  <br>  <br>  It is usually impossible to say which system will fail first.  Just having the body support a tumor burden of about one kilogram (2.2 pounds) often stresses the body's metabolism to the hilt - but the amount of tumor burden that overwhelms the person also varies from person to person.  <br>  <br>  Often secondary infections cause the eventual death.  Many cancer patients are weakened by their disease - and often by heroic treatments attempted - so they become easy prey for infections such as pneumonia. Some cancer patients develop bleeding as tumors invade blood vessels or cause the blood platelets levels to decline.  Some cancer patients have blood clots related to their malignancy, and the blood clots can cause death.  So excessive bleeding or clotting are both risks.  We cannot guard against both at the same time.<br>  <br>   I saw over 2000 people die from advanced cancers in my 20 years as a cancer specialist doctor.  These were people with many different types of cancer, and no two people with the same type of cancer were exactly the same.  I've seen people die with all ranges of bilirubin numbers, creatinine values, and other blood test abnormalities.  There is no formula that fits all people.  <br>  <br>  Malignant diseases are much more complex than most people understand.  You are referring to someone with far advanced disease.  Medical technology cannot cure someone with far advanced heart failure, a massive stroke, or end stage HIV disease either.  End stage diseases of all types are bad situations.<br>  <br>  Which type of cancer are you asking about?  There are more than 200 types - all different diseases.  The high globulin level suggests advanced multiple myeloma, but we don't have enough information to know this from here.<br>  <br>  Your anger is understandable. Most people go through stages of denial, anger, and bargaining along the way to acceptance - if they ever get to acceptance.  Many people lash out in their grief and anger.  It seems to be normal human behavior to look for something or someone to blame.<br>  <br>  As for paying in advance - all of my patients paid later - usually months later - since most had medicare or insurance which pays only months after services are provided.  No one I ever treated paid up front or even on the day they were seen in my office.  Maybe this has changed in the last few years since I retired.  The many people I saw without insurance did not pay either.  I usually wound up writing off those bills.  No one I ever knew could afford cancer care at today's prices "out of pocket."<br>  <br>  Added Note - If this is about Jane Goody Tweed, there is a surprising amount of personal information already in wikipedia.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade_Goody" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade_Goody</a><br>  This sounds like a very aggressive cervical cancer.  Retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy could block the ureters and cause renal failure.  It sounds like the liver involvement is also far advanced.  Chemotherapy appears to have failed as it often does with advanced aggressive cervical cancer.  If she is under the British national health care, she should not need to worry about paying up front.  I'm not sure how the "globulin of 17" fits into Mrs. Tweed's case.  <br>  <br>  The best person to answer specific questions about an individual case is the doctor on the scene who knows all the medical details.  Yahoo Answerers should never be providing life saving medical advice.  No one can practice medicine over the computer - especially with sketchy information.  All we can do is share experiences.|`|oojO4WAraa	Metastasized cancer is a cancer that has spread from it's initial, primary site to a secondary site.  How fast it will kill someone depends on the individual, where the cancer is, etc.  <br>  <br>  A lot of cancer is preventable through good diet and proper health screenings.  Most cancer is treatable if caught early.  <br>  <br>  Most poeple ignore health problems until it is too late - because they are afraid of what they will find out.  Stupid - because the sooner you know the sooner you can start treatment.|`|Lyjy3xO7aa	Oh, I hope this is a hypothetical question.<br>  <br>  When a cancer metastasizes, it spreads out from the originally infected organ into the whole body. Blood stream, lymph nodes, everything.  This enables new cancers to spring up anywhere, and they invariably do. Since you can no longer surgically remove every infected tissue, your options are limited.  Obviously, this is very serious, and almost always fatal.  Life expectancy is then measured by how fast the cancer is spreading. <br>  At no time is it merely an issue of trying.  Because the disease is not spreading by choice, choosing to fight it, in and of itself, will not work.  Medicine and Miracles are the tools you need.|`|UuGOHHG5aa	The problem with cancer is that  it is made of cells  from our own bodies  so our immunity isnt efficient at  attacking them , plus they multiply  without control which compromises other  kinds of cells that are  essential for survival .<br>  But  genetic  medicine is making advances everydayand soon there  will be  antibodies that can be made  that are specific to each individual and that will only  target the abnormal cells  making  cancer no more serious  or less than an infection .|`|e2be0a15c3672de325a1663ace314573aa	The problem about cancer and finding a "cure for cancer" is that there are 100s of different types of cancers, and 100s of different drugs depending on what type of cancer a person has.  And each cancer is different.  It's like finger prints, none of them are alike.  10 people can have breast cancer for instance, but each person's cancer will be different.  <br>  <br>  I have a type of sarcoma which is extremely rare, a one in a million shot.  But because it's so rare, there's so little known about it, and not enough people have had it for them to come up with a good way to treat it.  Heck, I've been through 3 rounds of chemo already and my tumor just keeps getting bigger.<br>  <br>  So the answer to your question is no one can know for sure.  And even though they might say a person has 3 months to live, they might only live one month, they might live another 50 years....no one knows.

fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	Look at instructions in the pack and make sure you know where to insert (check out Scarleteen <a href="http://www.scarleteen.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.scarleteen.com</a> if unsure) Use organic tampons like Cottons which are softer so more comfortable to insert, also non-applicator tampons are simpler, plus it's one less thing to bin. <br>  <br>  To insert first wash hands, also do this after. Wait until a heavy day and use the lowest absorbency, get into a comfortable position, unwrap the tampon and pull the string so it hangs freely. Hold the tampon in one hand and with the other hand hold your labia open out of the way of your vaginal opening, then insert the tampon as far as it will go, aim towards the small of your back. Don't be scared to put your fingers into your vagina, it's yours, it's clean and menstrual blood is clean, if you're tense your vagina will tense so relax. If you have problems try masturbating as when aroused your vagina doubles in size, becomes relaxed and lubricated, or use lubrication such as KY jelly or olive oil to make insertion easier. If you feel pain as you move after insertion it's not in far enough so remove and try again with a fresh tampon later. If you have problems inserting don't panic just try another time or use another option such as pads, sponges, softcups, free-flow, or menstrual cups which are internal like tampons but safer, cleaner, easier to use, and can be worn for 12 hours any time of your period without leaking. <br>  <br>  To remove get comfortable, relax and pull strings gently but firmly, if you can't find the strings or are using cloth, sponge or soft tampons just grab the tampon itself to remove. A tampon can never get lost inside you, but if you can't remove them you need to ask someone for help or go to hospital. Tampons aren't flushable so wrap up and bin. You need to change every 4-6 hours, always use the lowest absorbency making sure to change as your flow changes, never use when your flow is light, before your period or when you go to bed. You should alternate between tampons and pads, pads are also needed as back-up, try Lunapads which are far more comfortable than pads you may be used to. Tampons have many health risks as they encourage bacteria, damage vaginal walls and some brands contain harmful chemicals, as a result tampons have many health risks associated with them such as vaginal infections or the rare but life-threatening illness Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS). This is why there are precautions to follow when using tampons, note the younger you are the higher the risk. Symptoms of TSS are headache, vomiting, rash, high fever and diarrhea, if you suspect you have TSS remove the tampon immediately and go straight to hospital. See <a href="http://www.spotsite.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.spotsite.org</a> and <a href="http://www.toxicshock.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.toxicshock.com</a> <br>  <br>  Tampons are unhygienic and unsafe, not to mention also very inconvenient, other options really are better such as menstrual cups or softcups. As well as being able to wear cups at any time including from light to heavy flow, before your period, during the night and for sports like swimming, menstrual cups can be worn up to 12 hours and they don't leak. They are more reliable, convenient, comfortable and easier to use than tampons, plus they are much safer, more hygienic and cleaner than tampons. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cup" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_c...</a> - Menstrual cups on Wikipedia|`|QJHE3z1raa	relax.<br>  put on leg up on the toliet<br>  and push it in.<br>  <br>  :)|`|dpgXzMenaa	The ones with plastic applicators *definitely* make things easier for girls who've never used tampons before... but once you know how, anything that's comfortable to wear will be easy to insert. If you do it properly and insert the tampon far enough, it won't hurt to insert one and you won't really be able to feel it while wearing it. My stepdaughter began using them without problems for her second period, just 3 months after her 11th birthday.<br>  <br>  Helpful advice (beyond the semi-useless package directions)? Yeah... just three things:<br>  <br>  1) Aim the tampon more towards your back than upwards... your vagina actually goes *back* for more than half of its length, not just up, and it's almost parallel to the floor if you're sitting on the john... and push it gently (twisting it back and forth a bit might help it slide more easily) as far in as the applicator will go while you're still holding the end of it. Push the plunger in while holding the barrel in place, then let go of the plunger and withdraw the applicator.<br>  <br>  <br>  2) It'll be easier to do the first time if things are slippery "down there", so don't wipe away any blood and stuff until you've got the tampon in place. If there's very little blood there, just smear a couple of drops of saliva on the tip of the tampon (or its applicator if it has one) and it'll make things a lot more comfortable.<br>  <br>  3) Relaxation is **important**. If relaxing isn't easy for you, try pushing just a little bit as if you're trying to poop or pee... your pelvic muscles will relax a bit and that will help a *lot*.<br>  <br>  There's also an OK video instruction about it at <a href="http://www.wonderhowto.com/how-to/video/how-to-insert-a-tampon-235629/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wonderhowto.com/how-to/video/...</a>|`|wP7uDPJDaa	Ok I know you probably r a little nervous but just take a deep breath and go into the bathroom and obviously pull down your pants and underwear and get a tampon and eather pull your leg up or spread them appart and stick it up your "you know wear" and then you will have you tanpon secure.

I would start practicing right away to get ready for the big day.  You will more than likely need to practice-most people don't get it right the first time.

Get playtex gentle glide because they are comfortable if that's one of the things you're worried about.|`|0vF6WM7Eaa	Make sure you get tampons with a plastic applicator especially for your first time using a tampon. Cardboard is absolutely horrible to put in. Get a multipack (box that comes with light, regular, and super tampons) just incase you're not sure which type you need. Most of the time its regular unless your period is pretty heavy. As you start using tampons you'll figure out when you should use a different size tampons. Simply read the directions that come with the box they explain it pretty simply. Make sure you're relaxed. The first time using one can be a little nerve-racking. If you put it in correctly you shouldn't be able to feel it but given the fact that its your first time it might be uncomfortable to put it. You might be paranoid about putting it in right or it being uncomfortable in general afterwords. Just make sure you get it far enough in there. I had to use a tampon around three times before I was comfortable with it. I recommend you start using tampons today so you can get used to it. They are about a million times better than pads. You will thank god for making this decision lol.|`|inr8O6uOaa	ok, so i know that @ first it's like super weird sticking something up there, but TRUST ME-u get used 2 it so quickly and its like million times better than using pads.  just sit on the side of the toilet w/ legs spread apart and CLEAN hands and hold onto the part in the middle that has a little indentation. then, @ an angle start 2 push it up into your vagina( i know! ew! but u CAN do it!!!!!!) once ur fingers reach the skin and u cant push it any further, pull out the applicator.  the string should be hanging out and just throw the tampon applicator away, or if u use cardbord tampons(but those suck) u can throw it down the toilet.  again, i know it can be so awkward @ first but u can totaly do it! u will feel so much better on ur period when u use them.  also, the best brand is tampax plastic pearl.  good luck!!!!!!!!!!!!!! =) =)|`|H3giw4QHaa	Best thing to do is put one foot on the toilet sit and put it in.

KsaaEZqHaa	Perhaps you have an earwax problem? Maybe overnight it builds and you get a bit of a blockage which clears itself over the day. <br>  I have a problem with earwax and sometimes use drops... perhaps you should try a special ear doctor?
RP2QQXbjaa	It could possibly be that you're anemic, or it could be a number of different things.  I suggest talking to the doctor to see what it was he told you.
a6f9db1b86903edf23810c64febaf291aa	I am glad to know that you have already been to the doctor. You are doing all of the right things by having it wrapped, elevated and taking ibuprofen. Now... the most important thing... are you keeping your weight TOTALLY off of it (crutches)? If not, then your doc is the biggest quack that ever lived. Hopefully, you are keeping ALL weight off of it. You probably need to stay on the crutches for about 3 weeks in order to fully heal your foot correctly!! Understand that any weight that you put on that badly sprained foot over the next couple of weeks is only going to do those damaged ligaments more harm and make it harder to heal.

Buona VITA a te!!|`|6CWcMdsHaa	tagliarsi le vene serve a fuggire e a dare sfogo alla propria codardia della sfida della vita, attraverso un rapido dissanguamento causato dal rapido deflusso di sangue nei polsi attraverso dei tagli provocati con un oggetto molto tagliente(comunemente lamette o coltelli da cucina stile miracle blade) e quindi a causa di una diminuzione di circolazione sanguigna e quindi di meno globuli rossi, le cellule del corpo nn ricevono più ossigeno ne vitamine e nn riescono più ad avere un corretto carburante per vivere..|`|qZhzjeLRaa	La vene sono vasi sanguigni che portano sangue dalle altre parti del corpo all'altrio destro del cuore. Se ti tagli le vene (con l'utilizzo principalmente di lame, ma anche di vetro) dei polsi e non vieni soccorso subito muori. E' per questo una forma di suicidio.|`|rtJNAz4Haa	tagliandosi le vene si interrompe la circolazione sanguigna e il sangue non scorre più in tutto il corpo. Se ci si taglia le vene dei polsi o l' aorta, il sangue non circola più, non arriva più a cuore e così smette di pulsare. Praticamente il "tagliarsi le vene" non serve a niente, se non a morire. Lo si Più fare con qualsiasi oggetto tagliente come un taglierino, una lametta, un pezzo di vetro. Spero di esserti stato utile...ma non a farlo.

NGbn7GQ5aa	I have had insomnia like that every since I was in middle school. No matter what I would do I just couldn't sleep and it would be terrible because it would interfere with school and work. I would be awake for 72 hours straight, then sleep for 12-18 hours, and then be awake for 72 hours again. Sometimes I would be awake so long that I would hallucinate.<br>  I began taking sleeping pills and things like Tylenol PM to help me sleep, but I quickly developed a tolerance and had to take up to 5 at a time. I realized that this was doing more harm than good and I would stop taking them, but then the insomnia would resume.<br>  <br>  I finally saw a doctor and a psychiatrist about it and found that my insomnia was a result of another underlying problem, which I now take medication for. Now, i'd say that about 75% of the time I can fall asleep on time and don't stay awake all night long. It has helped get my life back on track so much.<br>  <br>  But no, it's not safe. Being sleep deprived is very dangerous, especially if you plan on getting into a car or something. You could cause a serious accident. I would say take a sleeping pill or something just this one time, and then when you wake up go talk to your doctor about it.<br>  <br>  If this occurs for years on end you should definitely see a psychiatrist; it may be the result of another illness.|`|79529314dfb5ac7be366558924c3393baa	It's possible for you to remain healthy, to an extent, even at this stage of sleep deprivation. However, if you are going through a lot of stress right now, I highly, HIGHLY recommend that you try to get some sleep, because it will definitely help you to stay on top of things and make sure you don't get sick or anything. Normally I wouldn't advise drugging yourself, but after this many nights without sleep you might want to consider taking a pill to help you get to sleep. Also, unless he has something important to do, see if you can get your husband to take care of your kid for a while, because that way you'll be able to temporarily stop worrying about it, which will help you to sleep better. Even if you only get a few hours of sleep, it's better than nothing and in the long run you'll probably be thankful for it.|`|fe8e16fb5d34fbd57e20ac5f74ce1205aa	i would think your body and mind need to sleep.  and when you crash, you will just sleep.  you won't get rest and you'll wake up feeling hung over with sheet marks on your face, puffy eyes and a tenderness in the chest from laying flat on your face (if you're like me).<br>  what's in your diet?  what are you drinking?  what's on your mind?  who will take care of baby if you crash and burn?  answer these questions, then you might have a starting point to find the answer to YOUR question.<br>  good luck.........|`|85c7b5c821a7ba39949a3307cf876e59aa	omg go to sleep before you die! =/|`|grytfPQRaa	I have had insomnia like this all of my life, since I was literally 6 years old. <br>  <br>  It is not good to stay awake that amount of time. You can actually start hallucinating or have all kinds of other problems.<br>  It can even cause psychosis.<br>  <br>  Try taking some OTC sleep aid, like simply sleep or take an antihistamine. Also, try stretching or try to take some Yoga classes. Yoga is the ultimate stress buster.<br>  <br>  You are a prime candidate for a sleep aid prescription. Talk to your DR. about it.|`|pAhV0GGJaa	You should speak to your doctor.  At this point, your baby is most important, and you need to take of yourself as well as your baby.  You could be putting your baby in danger unknowingly.  Hopefully your doctor can help you find a solution, and maybe you can get your mother in for a week or so until you can get things a little more back to normal.  Good luck!

Second of all, a constant washing of hands may very well be a OCD. Go to your doctor and tell him/her what has been happening. They may refer you to a specialist.

Cela entraine une certaine remise en question et un état de tristesse. Mais, je te rassure, après, souvent, ?a va beaucoup mieux (mais faut pas être préssé).<br>  <br>  La question qui se pose maintenant est; est-ce elle qui t'a clairement dit que tu ne savais pas prendre de décisions, etc. ou bien c'est de votre échange que tu as déduit cela ou est-ce seulement l'image que tu dégages et qu'elle t'a retourné?? Attention, si la première réponse: change de psy: elle n'a pas à te casser comme ?a. Si c'est les deux autres, c'est que la thérapie a son effet.<br>  <br>  Les psys servent souvent de mirroir. Ils te retournent ta propre image, tes propres craintes, désirs, angoisses, intérogations.<br>  C'est pour cela qu'on les déteste, ne veut plus y retourner et y retourne quand même! <br>  <br>  En tout cas, bon courage.

It primarily causes ulcerations (breaks in the lining) of the small and large intestines, but can affect the digestive system anywhere from the mouth to the anus. It is named after the physician who described the disease in 1932. It also is called granulomatous enteritis or colitis, regional enteritis, ileitis, or terminal ileitis<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.medicinenet.com/crohns_disease/article.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.medicinenet.com/crohns_diseas...</a>|`|v2HWSwc8aa	hi j, I am a female Crohn's pt. dxed at the age of 12.

They have tons of information ranging from the latest treatments, diet, women's issues, surgery, to locating a local CCFA support chapter near you where you can meet others like yourself and swap information on which GIs are the best where you live, which hospitals are great at treating IBD, which ones to avoid, they have educational seminars where MDs, dieticians, drug reps, etc. come in to speak to pts. and family members, etc.<br>  <br>  They also have a live chat & a hotline that is run by healthcare experts who are well versed in IBD during the week plus they have a forum where pts. and family members can post questions to others who have CD or UC.<br>  <br>  Definitely look into it and also finding a local support group near you. I've joined one near me and I know which GIs are the best in the area, which places are great for testing, which surgeons are the best and which ones to avoid.  <br>  <br>  I have had a few surgeries due to narrowing of the intestines. I am on the newer treatments to help keep me in remission. Ask your GI for something for pain as you are entitled to be made comfortable while flaring.

There are a broad range of symptoms that can let you know you have crohns, i didn't have many symptoms other than that i wasn't growing and i had incorrect blood tests. I get blood tests every 2 months and the doctor mainly looks for the sedimentary rate, its an indicator that lets you know if there is any inflammation anywhere in your body. I take medicine called pentasa (also known as mesalmine) and 6-mp (mercatopourine) These medicines work for most people but have not really worked for me, normal sedimentary rates are from 0-10 while my is constantly from 40-60. most medicines don't affect you that much, you may take medicine called remicade, which is similar to 6-mp. these medicine are immuno-suppressents which means they suppress your immune system to help you feel better. some of the side effect i feel is fatigue and joint pain. I hope i answered all your questions, Crohns is very treatable, good luck!|`|8KWuDE2Gaa	J,<br>  <br>  Please click on my profile and send me an email saying you want some info on a personal experience with Crohn's.

When I was diagnosed at 6 they put me on tube feeding through the nose, and since I cannot get any nutrition from the food I eat, I remain on the tube feeding to get my vitamins and nutrients,only now I have a button in my stomach. I hook up to the tube feedings every night for 10 hours or so while I sleep. Because my food will not stay in long enough to get the nutrients out of it, I take a needle twice a day to hold it in. I have a piece of my small bowel out and also my entire large bowel out, which has required me to get an ostomy (where you use the bathroom in a bag basically..lol). anyway, it sounds like a lot, but I lead a perfectly normal life and am very happy. Crohn's has been pretty crappy to put up with through the years, but I have learned so much from having it and it has enabled me to join the Crohn;s and Colitis Foundation of Canada to help find a cure, and thats what its all about. Anyway, good luck..and dont worry, I am like the worst case senario..just thought I would tell ya what I've experiencd.

From the LiveJournal gymrats community info page which has helped me lose 50 lbs in the past year and gotten me in the best shape of my life, I present the following: (I also highly recommend reading the entire community info page and maybe even joining the community to ask questions, but MAKE SURE TO READ THE INFO PAGE FIRST! If you don't and ask a stupid question you will get snarked mercilessly.)<br>  <br>  Losing fat and gaining muscle<br>  People who are new to resistance training or are coming back from a long layoff can often lose fat and gain muscle simultaneously (meaning same day or week), but only for a certain period of time. After that, it's generally most effective to focus on one goal at a time - either fat loss or muscle gain. We call these "bulking" and "cutting" cycles, and they are referred to frequently in this community.<br>  <br>  People often refer to losing fat and gaining muscle simultaneously as "toning", but some people think of that word as having a different meaning. It should be noted that the word "tone" doesn't have any relevance to reshaping your body. There are no exercises to "tone", there are no diets to "tone", you can only lose fat and/or gain muscle. And of course, you can gain fat and lose muscle.<br>  <br>  Losing fat<br>  Unless you are new to lifting weights, coming back from a long layoff, or are on drugs, you can only lose fat by consistently eating fewer calories than you burn. To lose fat and maintain muscle effectively you have to eat fewer calories than you burn and have a good weight training program. Partitioning can be improved greatly by the specifics of one's diet and training program. Muscle loss on a diet is more and more likely the lower your bodyfat percentage is. (There are other factors as well)<br>  <br>  Gaining muscle<br>  Unless if you are new to lifting weights, coming back from a long layoff, or are on drugs, you can only gain a significant amount of muscle mass by eating extra calories and weight lifting and/or cutting back from daily activity while still weight lifting. By doing this most people will gain some muscle and gain some fat. Again, partitioning can be improved greatly by the specifics of one's diet and training program.<br>  <br>  Losing fat from specific areas = "spot reduction"<br>  A frequently asked question is to how to target and remove fat from certain areas of your body via exercise. This is called "spot reducing" and is generally impossible. When you diet, fat leaves your body in genetically predetermined patterns. When you eat excess calories you will gain fat in genetically predetermined patterns. No amount of crunches will burn stomach fat, and no amount of leg lifts will burn leg fat - exercising the muscle has no direct effect on the specific fat covering that muscle. Sad but true!<br>  <br>  How to schedule cardio and weight workouts <br>  Many people ask which to do first, or if they should schedule them on different days, or what. The answer depends on your own personal schedule and what's doable for you, but there's one thing that's pretty definite - if you do a long and/or intense cardio session and then try to lift weights, you won't get the most out of your weight workout. You may even be more likely to injure yourself. Other than a warmup (5-15 minutes low-to-moderate intensity) doing cardio right before weights isn't a good plan. You can schedule weights and cardio on separate days, or do one in the morning and one in the afternoon or evening. Or if it's absolutely necessary you can do weights first and then your cardio. But please, don't do a major cardio session and then expect to lift well.<br>  <br>  This advice is intended mainly for those who are training for strength sports or for general fitness, and your needs may vary depending on your goals and priorities. If your "cardio" is actually training for a sport such as running or cycling, and that's what's most important to you, then splitting workouts would be ideal. However, if you need to do both you might consider putting the sport-specific training first.

A very brave and poignant posting, and a serious cry for help.<br>  <br>  Right - here we go!

This will hopefully assure you that someone has the ability to understand you and help prevent future incidents.<br>  <br>  Bringing things to an end in this manner really is not the answer, Emily.

You should still go to the ER and tell them what happened, no matter how stupid it sounds... a week is a long time to have waited to try to go to the ER.

DGAk3J2Zaa	~ hi ~ ! I'm very sorry about your illness. Nothing is worse than diarrhea. =( It sounds to me like your body is just worn down. The soreness is likely a result of the nutrients your body loss from the intestinal virus you had.<br>  <br>  This may sound corny, but this is what I do when my kids are recovering from an intestinal bug (and they are teenagers and it still helps). Is we use the BRAT diet. The BRAT diet consists of - Bananas, Rice, Applesauce and dry toast.  This will ensure your body gets the nutrients it needs as you recover and these are foods that are gentle to your system. I think you will find the nutrients in the bananas will help with the back pain. You have lost a lot of nutrients and you need to slowly rebuild your strength. If you don't have these things, have a friend or a relative go to the store for you. You need to rebuild your strength.<br>  <br>  Another thing I do, had chicken and rice to chicken broth (carrots are good too). This will help as your body slowly recovers. But, take it slow to returning to your normal diet. I really think if you follow the BRAT diet, you will find the soreness in your body will subside.<br>  <br>  Also, ensure your staying hydrated. Drink water and also Gatorade helps with additional nutrients your body lost and needs. <br>  Rest up - I hope you feel better soon.|`|KAiHiHkGaa	Yes it probably is from your illness.  The same thing happened to me about a year ago, complete with vomiting all night long.  My body didn't feel normal again for weeks after that.|`|lVR5TcxMaa	Woah I'm sorry your not feeling well<br>  <br>  <br>  I really think you should visit your doctor A.S.A.P|`|tUeH8HDdaa	Seriously I think you are suffering from dehydration which is quite serious - it would be a good idea to see a doctor as soon as possible.<br>  <br>  The dehydration may be the result of food-poisoning - I'm telling you this because when it happened to me I ended up in hospital on a drip.|`|y0kpHZ9Xaa	I think that you should be just fine. Mind the fact that I am no professional, I still think that it was just a little bug that you picked up. Wait it out for a couple of days, and if it gets better, good for you. If it doesn' t get better for a while, or gets progressively worse, I would recommend going to a doctor.<br>  <br>  Best wishes. =]|`|omMkXPkLaa	its probably food poisoning, don't worry, it'll probably go away in about a week or so, but if you probably take some pepso bismo, it'll probably go away like in four days...it happened to me before, u wont die or anything|`|qLuodu3Raa	could be because you are a little dehydrated from the runs|`|iRVk5Pdnaa	go to  a doctor my uncles a doctor and he said they are people like that that keep the back pain seriously go to the doctor|`|17uGQ033aa	sorry dont know<br>  |`|RazLBGQZaa	Yeah i think you just got sick.  Going to the bathroom that many times is exhausting!  plus you were sick, so i'm sure it's just the achyness of whatever is going on with you.  you just caught a bug or ate something bad.  Just ride it out, get a lot of rest!  also, it would be good to take some supplements like a good protein powder, and drink lots and lots of water.  i recommend SmartWater to you right now, as it has electrolytes in it... and you definitely need to replenish yours, LOL.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!  You'll be better soon, don't worry about your back.

SUxniVOqaa	Hi.<br>  If one abuses the body it will come out sooner or later. <br>  What you need to do is start eating a regular intervals. You need to eat food from all food groups. Read this:<br>  <a href="http://www.lifeclinic.com/focus/nutrition/food-pyramid.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.lifeclinic.com/focus/nutritio...</a><br>  <br>  I would also suggest to you to find a good multivitamin and take one serving in the morning with breakfast and another one in the evening with dinner (even if they say one serving per day, the reason is that water soluble vitamins exit the system relatively quickly). <br>  <br>  I would also suggest to you to get the amino acid Glutamine. You can buy it in capsules or in powder. The capsules are easier to deal with. Take about 2 gr. in the morning with water on an empty stomach 30 mins or so before you eat. Reason:<br>  <a href="http://mental-health.emedtv.com/glutamine/benefits-of-glutamine.html" rel="nofollow">http://mental-health.emedtv.com/glutamin...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.thewayup.com/newsletters/041501.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.thewayup.com/newsletters/0415...</a><br>  <br>  I don′t know how your sleep has been in the past but you should get good rest. Give your body time to rest, take it easy for 1-3 weeks and concentrate on resting. After that you should start to take walks at moderate pace, 2-5 times a week. Increase the pace and length after some time when you feel up to it, just listen to your body. The body is built for resistance and exercise has numerous benefits.

YtRB9Mhtaa	STDs you can contract from unprotected oral sex:<br>  <br>  1) Herpes- the biggest STD risk during oral sex since both strains can live in the mouth or the genitals.  Herpes is especially contagious during outbreaks (cold sores, herpes lesions).  Some believe it is contagious for a few days before and after the outbreak as well.<br>  <br>  2) Both chlamydia and gonorrhea can infect your throat giving you strep like symptoms. <br>  <br>  3) HIV can be passed through unprotected oral sex, but it is more likely to be passed during unprotected penetrative sex. The infected fluid has to enter through a cut or sore in the mouth or esophagus to cause infection.  It's not likely to be passed, but it is possible.  <br>  <br>  4) HPV can be passed during oral sex, but it is rare. HPV has been found on vocal chords. <br>  <br>  5) Syphilis can be passed similar to HIV through a cut or sore.  <br>  <br>  Your doctor can see if you have been exposed to these diseases by doing simple tests.  It's unlikely that you contracted anything from oral sex, but it's always smart to know where you are at.<br>  <br>  The best plan for the future:<br>  Make sure you don't have any cuts or sores in your mouth.  Use a dental dam (Lolly), either buy one or make one from saran wrap or a cut up latex glove.  If she does you, use a condom with spermicide, flavors are nice.  If she does get sperm in her mouth, she should either spit or swallow, but not just let them sit there (sitting sperm in the mouth does increase the STD contraction risk)... and with all those rules, have fun.  =)|`|Iez8uSp1aa	can see sex|`|831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	Multiple oral std's.

Lzt1eIZFaa	I am actually trying to stop now.  I had my last smoke on Friday.  I have been smoking 20 a day since I was 14 and am now 33.  I have never wanted to stop before, so always failed.  Now I want to stop. <br>  <br>  My Husband stopped on the 1st of January, he is 36 and had been smoking since he was 9 (I know, 9!).  He put the money he would have spent on cigarettes in a pot, and he has nearly ￡500. in this pot now, since January.  So I'm trying to imagine my pot of money growing and growing.  It's working at the moment because I'm thinking about all these things that I'm going to buy.<br>  <br>  I personally think that you really have to WANT to stop.  I'm going cold turkey because I don't think I could cope with having cigarettes in the house, no I actually know I wouldn't cope as I am actually thinking of having a fag now.<br>  <br>  Anyway, hope you succeed, Good Luck.|`|0CNaq92taa	Sounds very frightening ,but smokers are drug addicts.Nicotine is a very addictive drug hence your G.P.is obliged to offer help to overcome your addiction.Good luck.|`|sPapFBv1aa	The fact that you want to stop is a good start. My friend recently stopped and is going to a support group organised by her local GP. She says this is really helpful not being alone.<br>  Good luck|`|AA10309738	Hi,<br>  <br>  I am off the smokes 7 weeks and I will tell you how I did it. This worked for me so it MIGHT work for you too. 1st I got a really bad case of Bronchitis. I was coughing up blood and for 3 weeks I could only manage 7/8 fags a day. The Doc told me if I kept smoking there was a very good chance I would get chronic bronchitis which is extremely nasty and you can die from it. I am 27 so not much older than you. Let me tell you when that when something like this happens all of a sudden “enjoying smoking” is gone. You see it for what it is which is a trick. The only reason you enjoy smoking is because you have withdrawal symptoms you need to relieve. Once you get through the 1st month you will not miss it. Also the best day of cancer is still far worse than the worst day giving up smokes. I found a great support website which made everything clear. Go to www.whyquit.com . Everything you think you know will be blown away if you read the articles and download the free e book. Don’t bother with gimmicks the only way to quit is cold turkey. <br>  <br>  Please visit this site read the free book it could save your life.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|p28hM9ZGaa	It sounds like you need help if you have been smoking this long.

H9rHtTz8aa	ITP Or Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura as its called has no known cause or treatment. As an ITP suffer myself i can tell you that no matter what you have been told you can not catch ITP, weather its from a dog or a person. ITP truly has no known cause (the doctors speculate on a couple of theories) but nothing for sure and it has no cure. If you are diagnosed with ITP as a child then you have a 90% chance that you will grow out of it. If you develop it as an adult then you have a 99% chance you will have it for life. Trust me on this as i know just as much as the doctors about ITP as it has effected my life in so many ways, and one last thing...NO there has never been a case of it being genetic so your not going to get it if one of your parents had it and if they did when they were younger it must have been before the age of 20 ish as any time up to that age (roughly) it will go on its own and you wont be stuck with it for life. Do internet research if you dont believe me.

IJE5qK5qaa	I'm not going to lie to you:  Prep isn't pleasant.  <br>  <br>  You won't be constantly stuck on the pot, but don't make any plans to go anywhere.  Best advice is stay home.  Drink a lot of fluids, as it's easy to get dehydrated during a bowel prep.  You should be able to sleep, maybe wake up once or twice to use the bathroom.  You will probably be going until either a) you're completely empty or b) you get to the hospital to have the scope.|`|VYCLwKwNaa	Once you start drinking the GoLightly or whatever liquid they make you drink, you want to be close to the bathroom for a few hours. Bring your cell phone, book, laptop, etc. into the bathroom, or work at something in the next room. The stuff tastes better if you drink it cold. I found that if I poured it into a measuring cup, then opened my mouth wide and covered my tongue (and taste buds) with the cup so that the liquid didn't even touch my tongue and poured it down my throat, it was easier to drink.<br>  I had a good night's sleep.<br>  The colonoscopy itself is a piece of cake, because you are drugged and don't remember anything. You will need someone to drive you home and to hear anything that the doctor tells you, because you will have amnesia and not remember both the colonoscopy and the next few hours. Needless to say, don't do anything important for the rest of the day. You won't remember what you did, or you may do something strange like buy a stuffed alligator on ebay.

If all else fails, get a damp face washer and put it on your scrape, it may hurt but it will put some moisture back into the skin and bugs don't like met stuff either so that could help. Try using a low allergenic bug repellent as well to keep them away from you. Bugs are attracted to light so turn off all the lights in your room and turn on one down the other end of the house to attract the bugs away.

FP64kbXOaa	I can't help you much with cramps around different parts of the body, but I used to have severe leg cramps. Instead of going to a doctor I went to a physical trainer and he suggested a few stretches and drinking lots of water. <br>  <br>  If possible, ask her to take some multivitamins. There are quite a few that wont be effected by High Blood Pressure. Eg. Pharmaton. But I do strongly suggest you to take a doctors advice on that as I'm not a doctor and only speaking out of personal experience.<br>  <br>  If on the lower legs or thighs, keeping the leg straight; try stretching the foot and toe upwards as if standing on your toe but the foot should be pressed in. Do this for 5 seconds then let go for another 5 seconds before you continue the procedure. This will tighten and loosen the muscle. Its like giving the muscles a CPR. A little push to breathe.<br>  <br>  BUT PLEASE, try this at your own risk. I'm 22 years old and my body might react differently than to your grand mothers. So DO take doctors advice on this.|`|sAEYkNSqaa	If your grandma has smoked or is smoking it sounds like if the needs will need to be amputated as this is the only way to stop her being in immense pain, do your research on the internet.|`|KTNqah9eaa	I won't speculate as to the cause, but certainly  in my experience massage is a great antidote to cramps.|`|Ge6WhCf7aa	i think you would find a more dependable answer from her doctor or someone with experience.

Apib8680aa	I've been bleaching my teeth at home for a long time with noticable results. Try it yourself. <a href="http://www.americaschoicetoday.com/Teeth-Whitening.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.americaschoicetoday.com/Teeth...</a>|`|hqFTWFc9aa	Some of the basic home teeth whitening tip or methods of teeth whitening, used by people around the world are as follows:<br>  <br>  1. Application of a paste of lemon juice and salt in the yellowish tint of the teeth is a wonderful way of eradicating that dull color of the teeth.<br>  <br>  2. Rubbing the inner white part of an orange peel in the discolored teeth gives a lovely white shine.<br>  <br>  3. Regular use of paste of bi-carbonate of soda with water removes the surface stain from the teeth.<br>  <br>  4. Dried and powdered Bay leaves combined with dried orange peel also acts as an excellent whitener.<br>  <br>  All these home teeth whitening methods when done regularly can give an excellent result.|`|5GcmU8gNaa	Dentist will know if they are whitend but really its up to you and if you are having them whitend make sure you do it with every single tooth in your mouth so it does not look suspicious.

I've seen pregnant girls on campus, and girls walking around with their babies. About 4/6 of the population is Asian, 2/6 Hispanic, 1/6 everybody else. I'm one of the asians, and I can't imagine any1 of the people I hang out with has done it before.|`|HOdisPCWaa	There is no average, I was a young man in the 1960s and if it moved I screwed it.

But that doesn't mean there is anything wrong if you haven't had any . The first time you do it should be special and with someone you really care for . Most guys will do it , just because of peer pressure and it is normally a couple of minutes behind someones shed !!  It is best to have one very good experience rather than a few rushed fumbles with someone you don't even know and probely don't want to either|`|pzLDXL6gaa	I dunno, considering the average age of losing virginity is 17, I would guess by 18 probably almost half are still virgins, some have been having sex for a short time and some for a long time, so the average probably wouldn't be more than 2-3. It's really nothing to worry about though.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|zEy0uuAFaa	Less than one.  Some 18 year olds practice abstinence, and very few have more than one sex partner at a time.  Even having sex with more than one person at different times can get them all mad at you if they find out.  Usually someone who has sex with you wants to keep it just between the two of you - for reasons of intimacy and to minimize STDs.  Most 18 year olds that have sex with others comply, and have sex with just their steady girl- or boy-friend.|`|qRgPA9fSaa	I'm sorry but for the love of god can you get over the manly man thing and realize that having sex doesn't make you macho.<br>  You shouldn't be doing something like that until you have found the person you plan on marrying, and I mean you should be at least 25 and into the relationship with a SERIOUS attitude.<br>  What is wrong with you? don't you have any respect for yourself?<br>  = ( only trying to help

NqfVoVf9aa	i understand your situation. i have many friends that are addicted to heroin and will not stop. i have come down to the conclusion that the only way you will be able to help them is either convincing him to go to rehab or try and get him busted by the police. you can't help someone unless they are willing to help themselves. i have tried time and time again to help my friends that i have known all my life and nothing works. i have tried being a babysitter to them, not letting them out of my sight for months and they still seem to find a way to get a hold of the drug. it ends up taking over their soul and theress nothing you will be able to do about it besides sit there and watch them kill themselves. i hope and pray for your friend and his family and yourself that you all will be able to make it through this journey that no one likes to go down, it's a very hard journey but if you stay strong, maybe one day he will be able to fight it. good luck!|`|F8rO5XXUaa	you arnt goin to like the answer, but get him arrested go to court with him and tell the judge he NEEDS help not just 5 years in general population he NEEDS help and you have to give it to him one way or another.<br>  <br>  good luck dude|`|0lHSFxsgaa	It's so great you are concerned and want to help this guy get back on track but you can't save everyone.

I am so sorry that you have essentially lost such a close friend.  There is not a lot that can be done for someone who isn't willing to get into treatment himself.  People who want help often have to be put on waiting lists to get into programs.  I hate to be negative.  There are treatments available but he has to want it.|`|AA10408209	Hate to say it, but you can't help someone who doesn't want to be helped. If he truly wanted to save his life and himself from the horrible path, he would go to rehab, seek counseling, and there is a drug called Suboxone that helps a person addicted to opiates live a normal life. It is an opiate blocker and so it kind of attaches itself to the receptors of where the opiate would to provide that 'high' but rather than do that it does nothing but keep them normal. It is better than methadone because honestly, methadone can keep a person hooked and it is too easy for them to go back. Heroin is a serious drug but I do know someone that has taken Suboxone for over a year now and has been clean. That is huge for someone who has been on a drug as destructive as this. However, with your 'friend', I don't think there is any saving him or anyone for that matter unless they truly want to save themselves.<br>  Take Care :)
Ue5NoJOgaa	i don't think think it should be illegal to put anything in Cigarettes so long as it is on the label.  it is not the governments choice if I want to poison myself, if I want to drink drain-o, do heroin, and have unprotected sex they just need to stay out of it.  But, I have to assume the risk, so when I end up with stomach legions, a heart condition and multiple STDs I shouldn't get to come whining to a hospital for treatment unless i can afford it.

DtV8OLOoaa	Don't buy into all the bull that whey is some miracle drink. You can get the same results by making sure you have good sources of protein in your diet (eggs, lean meat, fish etc..). <br>  Whey protein is good on the occasions that you dont have time to prepare a meal or just after a workout when your body needs protien asap. <br>  <br>  To answer your question, If your diet is good and you are taking the right amount of protein required for muscle growth (through food or whey) then you should start feeling the difference after 3 weeks and seeing the diference after 1 month. <br>  <br>  also, don't train with weights every day, this does not give your body any time to recover and you wont gain muscle. Cut your weight training to 3-4 days per week at 45mins - 1hr at a time.<br>  If you feel the need to train more than this, then do cardio but no more weights|`|E64juLwJaa	In about 3 weeks:but add egs and chicken(grilled ) to your diet too,<br>  Do not train every day:muscles actually grow when you are resting:so give then a break:go running biking,swimming or jogging on those days for 30 minutes<br>  Colors

45q1vygzaa	My sister had a bad time with dyslexia and could barely read at all well into her teens.  It was pretty awful, and she had a rough time in school.  Finally, we ended meeting someone who was a tutor who specifically dealt with dyslexic kids.  <br>  <br>  The tutor used a teaching method called the Orton-GiIllingham method.  My sister eventually also attended a camp/boarding school called Kildonan, where she worked with some very good teachers under this method.  She was able to pick up reading pretty quickly after that.<br>  <br>  I'm no expert, but I know it worked for my sister.  I'll put the link on the Kildonan website that talks about Orten-Gillingham.<br>  <br>  Granted, you sound as if your situation isn't so bad if the only problem is misreading words relatively often.  So maybe going to the trouble of doing Orten-Gillingham is a little extreme. Nevertheless, if you think it's a problem you should let you parents and school know.  Then, you should work on finding someone who knows a lot about dyslexia.

Blood in stool can be an indication of some kind of internal bleeding, usually an ulcer. Or it could be a sign of something more serious, like cancer.|`|AA10774810	Wait till Monday.  If it's still a problem, see a doctor.

A fissure is a fancy word for a break in the wall that is your anus.  This tear is litterally a small rip in the wall, which bleeds directly out with the stool.  This can make subsequent bowel movements very painful, and it does need to be treated by a proctologist. Fissures are brought on by dry stools, yes.  You need to drink more water daily and at least temporarily take a stool softener.  This is an over the counter pill usually around $9 for a 100ct bottle, take 1 pill a day.  But first see a proctologist!!   A minor fissure will need a presciption cream which taken as directed, should heal the wound in about 10 days.  A major fissure might need surgery.   In the meantime, drink lots of water, take a stool softner, don;'t eat things that bind you up, and don't push like crazy when it's time to evacuate.|`|QASr69PGaa	Sounds like an anal fissure to me too. But i would definitely go to see GP. Has this happened before? I know it can be embarrassing to visit docs with something like this, but it could be something you need to check out. there are plenty of places you can get a home testing kit from if you don't feel comfortable discussing it with your doctor.|`|ce242ed5158fddbbd7d2bd6a7e4cfd17aa	dark red blood usually is no problem...but check with a doctor<br>  my guess is you tore something with the "hard" poo just like if you had scratched yourself on your arm...no big deal but if you see it the nest time you "poo" then see a doctor to be safe because internal bleeding can be serious....in your case it sounds harmless though|`|tBdceRrPaa	Hemorrhoid most likely...but seek medical attention|`|AA11317789	That sounds like intestinal bleeding.

ParFJxnSaa	Limit "worrying time" to around 45 mns, daily, possibly when you get home, or after your evening meal, but not too close to bedtime) after which, resolve firmly to refuse to worry again on that day: realise and accept that to do otherwise would be counterproductive to your mental health, and enjoyment of life. You will have had your "worry time" for the day, and can just write down any more thoughts that come to mind, and say to yourself: "Well, I'll just have to worry about that tomorrow, won't I?". It's important to regularly monitor, and deal with a negative internal monologue (self talk), or mental process, such as disturbing thoughts, images, impulses, or emotions, by the process of (a): recognising it, and (b): challenging it immediately. Technique For Re-Programming Negative Thoughts: When you notice something negative, such as: "I can't do this/ am never going to get over this!" or: "Why am I always so pathetic/useless/such a loser?" or even an image, emotion, or a memory; recognise that it is being generated from the negative part of your mind. Having identified and labelled it, visualise a large, red, flashing, "STOP!" sign, and/or possibly a stern faced person wagging an index finger at you in a negative manner, then say to yourself as forcefully as you can, even aloud in a big voice, if alone: "I know this tactic: GO AWAY FOR A WHILE !!!" You may want to use either: "ruse", "ploy", "game", or "trick". In the case of an image, visualise a large "STOP" sign, or your preferred version. <br>  <br>  Some people go so far as to keep a wide rubber band in their pocket, then put it around their wrist, when they catch themselves backsliding, stretch and release it, as a method of reprogramming their mind sooner, but I don't regard it as being strictly necessary. Remember to remove it, afterwards, if you use this method. Try replacing a negative thought with a positive affirmation of your choice, like: "I am a unique individual, with my own set of skills, and good points", or "I may not be perfect, but I'm doing the best I can, right now". Practice one of the relaxation methods in sections 11, 2, 2c, or 2i, daily, and when needed. Tai Chi, or yoga suits others better. Give the EFT a good tryout, to see if it helps you. There is a version for use in public places, (you can claim to have a headache, as you massage/lightly tap your temples, but you would then be restricted to subvocalising: saying it to yourself in your mind). Section 53, at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> refers: "Even though I sometimes suffer from anxiety, I deeply and completely accept myself." Or Google: "neurofeedback; therapists" Herbal remedies, such as chamomile, passionflower, or St. John's wort, are often effective, but the idea is (as with anxiolytic medication) to use them like water wings, or training wheels on a bicycle, providing initial support, and giving time for other treatments, such as therapy, and relaxation techniques, to take effect.|`|cku5S9WLaa	Stress/anxiety drugs are usually prescribed but you can try St Johns Wort which is herbal but you have to take it everyday before you notice a difference and for some people it doesn't work but it did for me.

Data is never erased unless the subconscious mind gives that command.<br>  For example, when you walk or drive to your destination, you do it automatically without being aware of it - that is your subconscious mind doing the whole process without your conscious mind.<br>  The subconscious brain is very good at its job and works 24 hours a day on keeping us alive.<br>  <br>  The subconscious controls and regulates involuntary functions of the body such as breathing, circulation, Metabolism, Digestion, hormone balance, etc.<br>  <br>  So you may wonder.. how do you tweak or make your subconscious mind to lose weight easily?  The answer is... Hypnosis!  <br>  <br>  Hypnosis is done by bypassing your conscious mind to your subconscious mind giving instructions and storing them successfully.<br>  That is why people can quit smoking, feel extremely motivated, attain success easily, study easily and so on Successfully just after 1 session of hypnosis!

Some people think it's dirty, but it comes from inside your body where it's sterile, and the path through the penis is kept clean by the astringent nature of urine.

Your body is designed to have sex a lot, especially if you're a healthy young male.  Our evolutionary history has selected for males that can have sex and ejaculate often, and your body is adapted to make that possible and easy.  Your body is continuously making the fluids that combine to make your semen, and making it come out as often as you enjoy it is perfectly healthy.  Ejaculating a lot will not make you weak or ill, that's just another lie invented by people who are against other people masturbating.|`|c2281bdd79a22b4095d5a638856c7bdeaa	Not healthy at all.

If you're thinking about the swelling of the penis during erection, this is an involuntary combination of relaxation of some muscles to let more blood flow into the organ, and contraction of some other muscles to keep the blood from draining out as quickly.  This happens as a reaction to thinking about exciting sexual situations, or touching or stroking the penis and other sensitive parts of the body.  Sometimes, especially in young guys, an erection will occur for no obvious reason on its own, or as a side effect of physical exertion or excitement of a non-sexual nature.|`|c2281bdd79a22b4095d5a638856c7bdeaa	No need to do anything as long as ur penis is normal.

a01a909a2ff5b135d406b8f2f4e144c9aa	Dear PE is not so simple. I can tell you one thing that if PE is not treated comprehensively then it remains lifelong. WIth your friends case its a typical SPPE condition where ejaculation is involuantary within one minute of start of intercourse. SSRI or other antidepressants are not permanent solution. They just subside your sexual urge to ejaculate so kill the natural joy of sex.<br>  The treatment of PE aims to make your mind to overshadow the impulse of ejaculation so that you can ejaculate by your will and not by impulse. Its important to re train your inner mind how to sustain the hypersensitivity of sex.<br>  <br>  Dr Anil Kumar<br>  Sr Sex Specialist<br>  dr.anilkumar@hotmail.com|`|cAy1SI9vaa	There are three reasons why your friend may be suffering from premature ejaculation.<br>  One reason could be, that as an adolescent, the masturbation habits you developed may have led to this.  Typically adolescents masturbate with the intention of reaching orgasm quickly, thus premature ejaculation has been “grooved” into your system. <br>  <br>  Now for the second reason, let’s face it we’d all like to be able to make love for hours.  There’s one problem though.  The body sees sex as a means to reproduce.  That said your body is going to try and reproduce as fast and efficiently as possible. This is why premature ejaculation mostly affects men in their teens and 20’s.The catch is, now you have to learn how to control it.  <br>  <br>  3.The third cause of premature ejaculation is the inability to handle and control intense arousal and sexual stimulation.  Once arousal reaches a certain tipping point it becomes almost impossible to hold back ejaculation.  <br>  <br>  In your pelvic region, various muscles come into play during the ejaculation process.  If your friend can identify those particular muscles and if he can use exercises to develop control over them then he can attain total ejaculation control. For controlling premature ejaculation focus on various emotions, thoughts and perceptions that are proven to cause premature ejaculation.<br>  There are some techniques like heart rate technique, breathing technique, training of glans, masturbation and sex techniques. Your friend may find the detail on  website given in source
UBBe1YIXaa	That has to be the worst advise ever. You're basically telling someone to start smoking because if you "cant beat em, join em." No, do not do that. It sounds like you haven't talked to them about it yet, so you never know they might surprise you. Or, have an intelligent conversation and maybe suggest that they could smoke outside. If all else fails, and there is nothing they will do, you could get yourself a nice air purifier and keep it in your room. I'm sure that would help a lot.

But "why" is a non-question - you must ask that to god or someone if you really want to know - but "why" do you need to know why?|`|TN6IQYoPaa	They also have awesome skin, awesome hair and are slim. I guess that's just how they are! I think because they are skinny all over, they have smaller breasts too!<br>  <br>  Kelsey x, by awesome skin I meant the skin texture, i think their skin is usually clear and healthy looking. I didn't mean the color!!! Gosh!!! I know anybody can be skinny, but i personally think in general u won't find alot of over weight/obese young asian girls, well atleast all my asian friends are like that!|`|bKNa7FbDaa	Yeah i wonder that to.<br>  Just runs in their genes i guess.. just the race!!<br>  And by the way to the person above, no. they do not have awesome skin.<br>  Since when was yellow awesome. and anyone can be skinny.|`|EgoT5xkkaa	Really???<br>  How you managed to find it?<br>  Did you check all the asian females before making such a statement.<br>  <br>  You should avoid general statements.|`|TnJKOSQjaa	*blush*<br>  <br>  (run away crying)
sU92tGxfaa	Well before going to gym prepare yourself an energy drink:<br>  250ml of orange juice diluted with water to make up 500ml, and a pinch of salt (optional) or creatine powder for those who believe in it. This is inorder to keep yourself hydrated, also for your sugar level.<br>  continued in link article........<br>  Just visit the below link on how to have an effective workout in gym and strictly follow guidelines
IKD6HWTXaa	I just seen a program about it.<br>  Try changing your work out program. Such as run slower then faster , slower then fast. First use 10 pounds then 20 pounds to work out with. Drink more water. <br>  And exercise less time but more frequently. If you use to exercise 2 times a day do it 4 times a day but cut the time in half of each exercise. <br>  <br>  It really did show results for me and I started loosing weight again.|`|v811KD7raa	either do more exercise for a week or reduce your daily calorie intake by 10% for a week|`|8pOQWtkRaa	hmm i lost 20 kgs in roughly a year, and recently came to halt on my weight loss myself i find the best way to keep going is don't stress yourself by making it a task, just keep eating healthy and take a little stroll in the afternoon, you'd be surprised how much a half hour walk can keep the weight off with a healthy diet. You really shouldnt stress yourself also dont deprive yourself of sweet foods it's ok to eat something with high sugar content every so often, when you start to deprive yourself it makes losing weight so much harder.<br>  Keep it up and good luck reaching your goal weight.|`|dLHmyy2Qaa	Don't be down - be happy with how far you've come. The more overweight you are, the easier it is to lose it at first. And 3 stones in 3 months is quite a lot and rather fast. Your body is now trying to take a breather and hang on to reserves it's losing quickly.<br>  Try a gym to give you a workout on other parts of your body besides the lower parts. Swimming is good too if you can swim.<br>  Slightly lower food intake too could help but keep up with the healthy stuff. DON'T go with fads like diet pills or green tea (I drink green tea but not to help to lose weight - that's a daft idea).
fk9AvB25aa	That is total BS. Herpes dies with in seconds of being away from the body and it doesn't last for more then seconds on objects, even toilet seats. Genital herpes is usually sexually transmitted or if his genitals comes into contact with either oral or genital herpes from a past partner.

YCmvBc05aa	The best thing is to get a dental anatomy textbook in front of you and recreate the shape.<br>  <br>  The following web site will show you the anatomy as well through illustrations :<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.forensicdentistryonline.org/Tooth_morphology/adult_canine_morph.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.forensicdentistryonline.org/T...</a><br>  <br>  *****In short though, you can do the following :<br>  <br>  For canines when you hold the tooth vertically while looking down from the tip of the cusp do the following :<br>  <br>  1. On the labial create 2 planes. The mesial and distal planes should meet a little distal of the midpoint of the labial surface.<br>  <br>  2. That is because the distal part of the incline on the incisal edge from the tip of the cusp is longer than the mesial incline.<br>  <br>  3. Once you have created that make sure you create a second plane from roughly the mid portion of the crown that will end toward the tip of the incisal edge.<br>  <br>  This will give the bulky appearance of the crown. <br>  <br>  4. On the lingual create two longitudinal depression on each side of the cingulum area.<br>  <br>  5. Then make sure you round off all of the sharp line angles.|`|UOZP4Ma5aa	Get a prosthodontic text book or a dental technicians manual, it will show you how to go about it easy.

aVqfgQZkaa	I'm pretty sure pot is not addictive..it doesn't have nicotine like tobacco does.   You won't go through withdrawal is you decide to stop.  You might really really want to smoke but it won't be because your body feels like you need it, it's more of a mental "I really like to do it" thing.  Try replacing pot with something else...like tea, or gum even.  I suggest looking up ways to stop smoking cigarettes and make any substitutes where possible.  Obviously you can't resort to nicorette gums or patches or anything but there are things you can do to keep your mind off getting high.  Good luck.|`|39e46128b8ea5a82c45af42790e8132daa	I'm sorry, but you cannot be addicted to marijuana. It's impossible. <br>  <br>  If you really wish to quit (which, I'm not sure why you would want to), then DO it. Tell your partner that you don't want to anymore, tell them why and ask for their support. It's as simple as that.|`|cPQ7TBcuaa	First off, you'll have to stop hanging around people that do it, because seeing them do it and/or seeing them high will be too big of a temptation. Try talking to him and see if you can get him to stop...tell him it's you or weed. If you can't get him to stop, then at least try to get him to do it outside or at another location so that you don't have to be around it...or try and get him to only do it on occasions instead of on a regular basis. If he won't leave when he does it, then start leaving yourself when he does and maybe he will value your time together enough to at least cut back. Also, try finding a new hobby to pass time, at least temporarily, until you can get pot off of your mind.|`|nPt7hUE8aa	It's gonna be hard if you live with a pothead.  I had to stop due to random drug tests for my position. I ended up moving away... I couldn't have done it had I stayed in my home town.  I worked that job for 4 years and then no longer needed employment so I quit... I again smoke like a mofo... i don't see the problem with it.. but if you want to quit... then you either need super strong self discipline or move out... don't be a nagging gf or wife and expect him to quit. It's sorta unfair.|`|tBdceRrPaa	Stop being a weak minded follower and get some will power to make decisions that are in your best interest regardless of your surroundings. On a further note it is not possible to be physically dependent on marijuana....so just stop.|`|b5tf7EkTaa	Look up: Neu-Relieve at www.martinperron-neurogenesis.com.|`|AA11573460	just stop thinking about it. make urself busy with other things|`|qn9r6dY9aa	Well I've been addicted to just about everything and quit everything I was addicted to cigarettes included. Pot is not physically addicting but then again neither is cocaine. However, just because you don't experience sever physical symptoms of withdrawl like you would with heroine i.e. diarreah, chills, sweats, joint pain etc. Addiction can stem deeper in terms of how something has adapted to your lifestyle or way of doing things. For instance gambling addicts don't put anything in their bodies but their addiction is just as serious and just as difficult to quit all the same. I am happy to inform you that out of all the things you could be addicted to this is the easiest one to quit. This may seem easier said than done but the only way to really beat addiction is to just do it. Every case I've seen where some one has beaten addiction happened because they hated how it was effecting their lives or they have began to hate the person they have become because of they're addiction. Don't set a date when you are going to quit just do it on the spot and do not being high at the time. Sometimes people need to be separated from anything that reminds them of it and separated from the people that trigger the behavior. But like I said pot is not that extreme you probably won't have to go to these lengths. However if your partner truly cares about you and is concerned with you improving your heath or your mind he will respect you enough not to smoke in the house so you can get past this. A person that really wants to quit will do everything that is necessary. Your biggest factor is how strong you want your will power to be and to stop making excuses because there are none.|`|sFnDTZJDaa	are you serious. just stop. if you can quit eating ice cream before you go to bed at night, you can quit smoking pot. its all mental, you're not going to suffer withdrawal symptoms or anything like that. its not physically addictive. just find something else to occupy your mind. its really, pretty easy. i smoke pot almost every day during the summer, but during the school year i just stop. its not hard..<br>  <br>  and to the dude above. cocaine IS physically addicting...|`|mQg5SVQXaa	Even if you don't want a job, go job hunting and take it seriously.

I had them back in my heyday, but got tired once I realized how silly things like that look. There is always the initial pain of someone piercing through your skin, but that's about all. Imagine being bitten very hard in the lip. There you go.|`|tz0qCCGlaa	Lip piercings are not that painful, althought it is a needle going through your skin, so there will be some pain. it would be worth it though.... i think snake bite piercings are the sexxest piercings ever!|`|IySTxK0kaa	my answer by other people is.......yes (and by looking), but u could do little things like ear and stuff, which don't hurt at all.|`|WwVjr8iGaa	i had a friend with snakebites, <br>  he ended up taking them out as they wouldn't heal.<br>  <br>  having piercings being exposed to food/etc. means it is less likely to heal.<br>  <br>  if you get them professionally done they would hurt like a permanent needle, which isnt that hard.<br>  <br>  if it's done by a mate, it's funny to watch and rather painful :S|`|LiSrsbtUaa	they hurt, but the pain is worth it!!!|`|psLk5fDGaa	Momentarily.
