Have your friend wash her skin with soap and water then change into something else. Ask your mom if she can wear one of your shirts.  To be safe let her wear one of your shirts and have your  mom  remove  the shirt she wore.She can return it to you when she gets home if you don't mind.  She will ask her mom to wash it first.  Better safe than sorry.|`|Jp3cWTJiaa	Why in the world did ya cut them open in the first place? Kinda irresponsible don't ya think.... and them to sling them around the house.... I think you should just throw the shirt away and quit asking dumb question and do something that's not so careless in the first place.... I realize that you were having a sleepover but there are other ways to have fun. If I was your mother I would be pissed. Your worried about the girls tank-top and you should be worried about all the other things that you destroyed in the house by SLINGING it everywhere....
051a951539f4262540d3c7ba8903b5abaa	CraigsList.org is wonderful. You can get a nice used furniture set because people are always looking to upgrade their stuff or are moving out of their homes because of downsizing or foreclosures.    I still would consider Ikea. The thing you have to remember is that with Ikea you get what you pay for.|`|AA10097817	In USA, try overstock.com. Or your local furniture store. They're really hurting now. You can probably haggle for a good price.|`|D5dS539yaa	Here are some options:  http://www.homelement.com/products/Bedro...    Good luck!|`|rDug05OLaa	haha i was going to say IKEA|`|02XrxUUsaa	target! target is my homie, there are also really girly accesories at places like clairs and limited 2, aslo u might try libby lou but im not sure if that is just a local store... ok well good luck! hope i helped|`|5C3zkmDOaa	I agree that Ikea is not a great place to buy sturdy furniture.  Believe it or not, you can find lots of inexpensive, but solidly built, stylish furniture through either ads in your local newspaper, yard sales, or thrift shops.  You might also try www.freecycle.com since it is possible that someone might have something nice they are willing to give away for free to a nice well-spoken young teenager.  Another possibility is www.craigslist.com   Make sure it is OK at your age, if not, you can ask an adult to track the lists for you and tell you when something comes up.  I would highly recommend going into your local thrift shops, too.  Leave your name and number with the store owners and ask them to call you if they get something that might work for you comes into their store.  If you have a bit more money and want something new, you could look into unfinished furniture stores.  They make the furniture (some will even make it to your exact specifications), but they don't paint or finish it.  If you did that, you would also need to buy products to paint or finish your furniture, but it would be your very own personality from the start.  Hey, you could even paint it black, if you wanted.  Me? If I was going to paint something black (a great idea in your situation), I would look for used furniture sources first.  If I was planning on only varnishing the pieces for a fresh-wood look, I might buy them at a used furniture store.  It would be really great if you could find something through freecycle!  If you tell a store owner how much you are willing to pay, they might be able to make a deal with you, though.  Hey, I just thought of one more idea!  You might check with the shop teacher at your local high school.  The students need to make stuff for their projects.  If you could pay for the wood at a local lumber store and someone could deliver it to the high school, you might be able to get a VERY inexpensive price on a bookshelf that is bare wood, but brand new.  Then all you would have to do is paint it once you got it home.  By the way, twin beds are going to prove to be much cheaper in every way.  Unless you really do need the larger bed, it would be better on your income to choose a twin bed.  Queen beds, mattresses, sheets, and bedspreads are all at least double in price compared to twin beds.  By the way, if the brown chest of drawers fits in your closet, you could put it in there to conserve space.  If not, you could paint it black to match the other furnishings.|`|iWmbi4traa	I was going to suggest IKEA as well...|`|H6viUi44aa	hah i was going to say ikea

9fed39238f286d3cd62baeb926026293aa	I would add some more burgundy accents to your kitchen, like a rug and burgundy curtains for the dining nook to tie it into the kitchen and I would paint the cabinets a creamy white, if you dont like it you can always strip it later on down the road. Also I would paint your kithen a warmer more inviting color. Glad you are getting rid of the ceiling fan, they dont belong in a kitchen LOL. Other then that I think your kitchen looks cute|`|051a951539f4262540d3c7ba8903b5abaa	Congrats on your new purchase!    I would reface the cabinets to give them a fresher look. It will be less than replacing them. New doors, hardware and maybe molding. Not too much.    As for the countertops, I would replace it with a nice laminate or corian. These are inexpensive and can really change how your space looks.|`|gjs1GXdTaa	It is small and dated.If you want to keep the white appliances, then maybe paint the cabinets white and get all new hardware. Also be sure to paint the panelling above the cabinets.The light fixture would look batter if it was a flush mount and with a finish that will match the new cabinet hardware. You may want to keep the counter tops after you paint and the red will be enough to set it off. The nook area would look better with some type of curtains or a valance over the blinds. Maybe even some wood colored blinds. A counter top paper towels holder or put it in a door.    OR    Restain the cabinets and get new hardware and get black appliances. Paint the table and chiars black and get wood blinds.    You can sell your old appliances on Craigs List to help pay for the new ones.|`|lLm5uIuDaa	I only could see white woodwork so I'm not sure where the darker woodwork is but you want to be consistent.  All white or all dark.  If it was an older original woodworking, I would not paint it, but this home doesn't seem to be of that age.  The cabinets could use an updated stain (maybe a warm cherry), remove the bric brac trim and replace the hardware with something more updated.  Since you are not interested in granite, I would suggest a silestone or corian.  I would install a series of in ceiling spots in lieu of the fan/light combo.|`|0LxgeSJnaa	Your house looks  like its been there for a long time in the 80's    get a new ceiling fan (dark cherry color)    paint the cabinets dark cherry (stain)    i would get teh countertops out of there and get marble instead    if you can afford it all|`|a4L6z5Jcaa	your house looks pretty good

6YbxTlDCaa	check all of your local ads for a decent used stove. An EPA-approved one would be best, as it burns cleaner while at the same time uses fuel economically.  (Fuel is very expensive these days.) I prefer A non-catalytic-converter type. The measurements of your fire box are very important. when shopping be armed with the depth, height and width. Also, a stove with a blower is desirable.  Regardless of what you end up with, a ceiling fan in the same room helps immensely with the distribution of heat throughout the house.|`|9ZLl7nZcaa	I'm wanting to do the same thing . Ive learned that the size of the hole matters and that the things are heavy and not easily shipped because of the weight. Ive seen some good deals on Ebay for them but there always too far from me. Good Luck|`|znFpsUTaaa	I would visit a fireplace speciality shop or go to google and see if you can get some evaluations of various types and styles of woodburning inserts.  The fireplace shop will offer several brands and you can explore their features against their new cost.  You can always ask if they have any used inserts.  Those would be rare.  All the people I know of who have installed inserts have kept them, are apparently happy with them and their function.  A fireplace shop may also be able to deal with what it is you are unhappy about with your current insert.  In a total pinch, if the problem is how doors fit, or how it draws, repairs could be an option.  You can advertise for one but be prepared to spend some money and not find what you need in the size you need.  Craigs List could be an option for you and it does not cost anything to advertise want to buy items.  Finally, there is a brand I believe is called Vermont that seems to be one of the premier stoves on the market.  If you could find a used on of those, compare its price to a new one, you would have a good idea of worth.    Concerning your existing one, remember that inserts are just that--they are additional to a fireplace box and must fit pretty closely.  About the only thing you don't have to worry about if the insert is in a modern metal fireplace is getting zero clearance--that is the space between the stove and anything surrounding it, involves heat transfer, but if the original fireplace was a good one, you could go with zero clearance, which means the insert fits exactly and can actually touch the surfaces of the existing fireplace.  One thing you should consider is making sure you have a fan unit attached.  That helps distribute the insert heat much better than air convection.  However, a very cheap alternative is a floor fan placed not too close to the insert, aimed at the ceiling.  That will force warm air up their to circulate and it should work its way down.  Good luck.
RarI0Rnsaa	Carl, I recommend calling a professional for help. http://www.heatingsystemsrepair.com|`|gFHTcIc8aa	In the sellers disclosure when you put your house on the market, you will need to make prospective buyers aware of the problem.  To have this problem would be a major turnoff to buyers, especially in this tough housing market.    If I was selling my house in a year; repair. Pay as little as possible to get the heat pump in working order and you can claim on your disclosure the heat pump is in working condition.  As far as getting your money back, depending on where you live and the condition of the rest of your house.  There are too many factors to give you accurate answer.  It's probable given the current market conditions you may not get the money back you paid for a new heat pump.  $1000 seems like an awfully high amount of money for a repair; shop around.  You might be able to replace with an aftermarket pump for alot cheaper.|`|wlgRsZpfaa	repair it!!!!!!!! the economy is, i don't know, in CRISIS!?!?!?|`|NyTlXmUqaa	LOL.......|`|HHTLpwrgaa	gsfdgs|`|SCiY5JESaa	If you don't be honest in telling the future buyers of the problem, a good heads up! honesty will sell your house|`|bff8176a9e09f8072e70e345d10362a8aa	1000 ill be right over ill replace it for 900 whay to high a price to replace get another opinion and replace it|`|m4vUUGOyaa	replace|`|KFgrvcSYaa	Could do that, or if you don't want to come right out of pocket.....  can give an allowance that can come out of your askig price|`|2bfdxef1aa	I would replace it cuz if u repare it it will cost u the same amount of money and it colud brake again... but if i were u i would just get a new heat pump|`|DrvEzGxIaa	You won't get your money back for the new heat pump but you could claim it on your taxes. If you're definitely going to sell the house, just repair it and let the new owner handle it. Twenty years is old for a heat pump, though.|`|ZKeVEmCFaa	Replace it  One of the questions on an appraisers work sheet is how old the roof and the a/c are.  If a buyer thinks they will have to replace the A/C they will start to question what else has to be replaced.  I would also get a few other estimates on the replacement.  You can replace the whole unit for not much more.  Pluis if the house doesn't sell you will save money with a replacement.  20 yrs is a really long time|`|9jDBKKw7aa	Do you mean condenser? Anyway, replace it. The efficiencies of a new model are so much better, you will recover the cost through lower bills in just a few years. If you sell your house, the new buyer will consider the old unit obsolete (needing replacement) whereas a new unit should be a great selling point and add value. 3000 sounds like a great deal. Go for it.|`|jaHkY4Rbaa	I really don't know anything about heat pumps, but are you talking about a fan motor, or the compressor ?      A fan motor should just need a few parts to be good as new.    Not sure about a compressor motor, or the compressor ?|`|DGsYLEj0aa	Definitely replace it.  If you were to just replace the motor, there is nothing to say that the compressor will not go out next week, then you would be out almost the cost of a whole new unit.  A new heat pump will be an excellent selling tool when you do decide to sell the house since HVAC repairs/replacement is normally one of the most expensive costs a homeowner incurs.  You have more than got your money's worth out of your current unit since the average life span of a heat pump is 10-12 years.  I would also be sure to get at least 3 estimates and be sure you completely understand what kind of warranty you are getting.  Customers at the company I work for can purchase up to a 10 year part and labor warranty, which will be another good selling point.  If you do decide to purchase an extended warranty, be sure that it is from a reputable company that has been in business for a good while, because if the company were to close, your warranty could be void (depending on if the company is carrying the warranty or the manufacturer is).
jaHkY4Rbaa	How good is your fire insurance policy ?      If you own the home, then replace the ceiling.  The old drywall/plaster has to come off.  You can scrub and cover it with a coating of oil based paint, and that might keep the mold at bay, however, maybe not.    If the ceiling is drywalled, the torch will destroy the paint and the paper and it will need to be re-drywalled anyway.|`|zLoyo24Taa	Bad idea, very bad!|`|8449a75b059164ff6d7636d90b469f9daa	TAKE TIME TO THINK   ASK YOUR SELF, SELF , DO YOU LIKE LIVING INSIDE A HOUSE?

5C3zkmDOaa	Cream satin walls with white high gloss trim will make the room look brighter and larger.  The high gloss will make the edges of the room pop against the contrast of the satin paint.  If you can change the sink, I would get a pedestal sink without a cabinet.  That will make it look as if the bathroom has more floor space.  Try mirrored doors on the walk-in shower with a hanging mirror or a few mirror tiles on the opposite wall, if possible, to give one more illusion of extra space.|`|gjs1GXdTaa	A room that size I would tile the most of it.All of the shower and floor and maybe even 1/2 way up the wall and then paint the other half a color that will match the tile.Maybe a corner toilet or sink would help give you a little more room.|`|2RkDecZwaa	Id paint it white. It looks clean. But also basically any cool colors. And since its small keep it simple! No crazy patterns on anything, just simple colors. Keep it one color scheme. Id say put one nice framed picture on the wall. Anything too much and it will look cluttered and small.
usltkMnwaa	An alternative to fire logs is to use oil, this can be any kitchen cooking oil. Cut two soda cans 3/4 ways down. fill the cans with the oil and make a wick out of a news paper by twisting it. damp the wick into the oil and let a small piece of it out like the wick of a candle. Place the two cans under the fire cradle on opposite sides and light the oil-damped damp newspaper. This will give you the exact same result as a fire log for virtually no charge.     good luck .|`|73aa4bf33f680a909f0c2ac17afbaee3aa	We found the fire starters are best.  They are smaller versions of the log.  We get them at WalMart.  Otherwise, you need newspaper and kindling wood.  Ball up the newspaper, put the kindling wood on top of that and then some smaller logs on top of that.  Good luck!|`|AA10230779	Arrange the wood in a teepee or box fashion designed for good airflow into the fire from underneath and exit from the top.    Put some charcoal in the center to start the fire.  The hot charcoal will help to dry wet wood pieces and will keep the fire going longer by making it burn hotter.|`|b663010fec563a8838443a18a6bec461aa	Make a "tee-pee" shape with balled-up newspaper in the center,  thinner sticks of wood leaning against the paper,  and thicker pieces leaning on the outside.  This design works pretty good.

Personally I think black can be very clinical, cold and hard to pull off in a living room. Maybe bring the warm and stylish aubergine OR berry red into the room, even if you only paint one feature wall this colour and leave the rest a complimentary neutral shade. Both colours suit cream curtains,the beautiful antique gold(pole or metal fittings/cushions) and look so inviting against a wooden floor or cream carpet.

TMB4d3FAaa	When I want to stagger my blooming times of tulips, daffodils etc. I plant them at different depths and/ or I turn some upside down.  The deeper ones take a little longer to warm up and begin growing.  The upside down ones need a little more time to negotiate to the surface. This gives me a greater spread of bloom time. After the blooms are spent, allow the green blades to photosynthesize until they turn brown and go into hibernation.  They will store enough energy for the next bloom.  If you cut the flowers before they go to seed, you'll have better bulbs for next bloom time.  I plant my Tulips deeper then the crocus or grape hyacinths in the same hole.  I get two blooms at different times from the same space with no added work.  Tulips and crocus are great planted in the fall. Your refrigerated bulbs just acted as if they were already outside and planted.   They will set roots and leaves for their bloom time before winter hits.  When it warms just a little they are in full bloom. the crocus are beautiful nestled in the snow and fully bloomed. Your specific area will let you know how deep to plant your bulbs.  Usually, I start out at about three times their thickness for the depth.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	as long as the sprouts are coming out that is the way you put them|`|zILwtO22aa	Points up, the fine curly growth are roots, so they are underneath.

Bzzzzzzzzzz|`|5C3zkmDOaa	There is nothing wrong with the color combination.  What you should be aware of, though, is that black will darken your room or possibly even cause it to seem smaller.  I would not suggest painting an entire wall black.  Instead, consider painting the trim black.  That would add wonderful, sharp contrast while neatly connecting the bed and accessories to the whole room.  I think that painting the whole room yellow with all the trim (and maybe even the door) black would have a stunning effect without darkening the room!

What you do is build a pavillion with a fireplace or firepit in it.  You just need to build a chimney of sorts..  You can use stove-pipe or a brick supported chimney with small column supports for an open pit design..
v3xEtuLLaa	It depends on what you want to do, what kind of beam you have, etc.  I just finished a basement, and the owner bought pole covers.  They are made of masonite, and the 2 halves are held together with biscuits and glue.  It came with trim that fit around the top and bottom, and I painted the whole thing in the accent color of the basement.  You can also use 1-5/8" metal studs.  Put one on each corner, then drywall over that.  Paint it, then put base around the bottom.  This works well if the ceiling above is drywalled, or it can be wrapped with wall angle if you are installing a dropped ceiling.  What I am doing in my basement is making panels around the columns.  I'm putting oak plywood over the studs, then making corners out of 1x4 oak.  There will be 1x4 rails at the top and center, then a 1x6 along the floor.  The inside of the rails and stiles will be wrapped with cove moulding.  All of this will be stained and sealed to match the rest of the trim.  In order to make this work, though, I had to fur out the beam (triple microlam) and drywall it.  It's not done yet, but i think it will look pretty good.  These are just some ideas.  I've also seen them just painted, and it looked good too.  Hope this helps.|`|3W18HDxxaa	use 4- 2x4,s  sit them around the pole cover them with plywood    cut plywood to fit space between 2x4,s screw it on or nail it   [build a box]|`|CwQOGJoKaa	suggest to frame it in with plywood,then cover the plywood with carpet or whatever.

AA11988604	Concrete?  you can buy floor leveler in a 5 gallon can, costs a fair amount, from memory, maybe 50 bucks a can.  check the label for coverage.  Most places will let you return unopened cans, so buy an extra one if you think its going to be close.    You just pour the stuff out in the lowest spot and it seeks level on its own, then hardens.  so you need to watch it closely, perhaps with a tight string stretched over the place you want level, so you know when you have it where it should be.   don't forget to remove the string before it sets up.

I don't like fat pillows that make you feel like you're trying to sleep sitting up because they are too "lofty."  I like my old well-worn pillows that have gotten kind of mashed with the years.  The type of pillow you need will partly depend on which side you normally sleep on.  And there are different firmnesses too.

Sxlcyua5aa	I just went through this process in the summer, but I used contractors.   We had a designer.  I wanted tile in the kitchen, but since we opened everything up between the kitchen and the den we went with hard wood in the kitchen.   So in the end, the bathrooms and the laundry/mud room was tiled, and the rest of the house was hard wood.   We went with three different widths for the hard wood.   Using rugs in the bed rooms and the rest of the rooms sets off the room.   If you are going to do the hardwood floors the old fashion way by laying, sanding, and coating, then I would not hesitate putting the hardwood in the kitchen because the floor is sealed.   If you plan on installing pre finished hard wood flooring then I would go with ceramic tile in the kitchen.   But you need to consider the layout of your house.   If you have an open plan, it is best to use the same flooring throughout.   The interior looks more uniform and appealing to the eye.   One thing I noticed about the tile compared to the tile we used to have is the grout line.   The grout line in the tile that was laid this summer was much thinner.   This gave the bathrooms a much more elegant and modern look.   It simply looks marvelous.   Lastly, nix the carpet and go with rugs.   Pick rugs to enhance the decor in each room, so that each room has its own personality.   Hardwood sells and carpet does not.   The buyer can always decide to put carpet in if they want too.    One last piece of advice.   Make sure you have the humidity checked under the house.   If the humidty is high, like above 14%, your hard wood flooring can start to cup, or warp over time.   Even if this does occur, if you get the humidity down and controlled, then the wood floor will go back to normal over time.   Good luck.|`|lLm5uIuDaa	I have hardwoods in my kitchen, breakfast, entry and hallways and wish I would have run it through the entire home.

If you do put it everywhere then get in floor heating or it will not be nice to stand on.  If that's out of your budget, then get hardwood.  Also, have a look at cork flooring.  Its warm on the feet and is as durable as hardwood.  Its also very friendly to the environment because the cork tree never gets cut down, they just keep peeling the cork off and it grows back.  Might help in re-sale.|`|QRcBM5PZaa	i do flooring for a living  me personally i would prefer tile in the bathroom and the kitchen a nice laminate floor in the living room and hallways and in the bedrooms i would prefer carpet|`|fa83c45e84deed94836a8848efe62af8aa	This is a good question. I can tell you that in an existing house, ceramic tile is difficult for a DIY homeowner to install. If you are considering hiring a contractor to do the work then I would consider tile in the Kitchen, and Baths. I would then consider hardwood elsewhere - Carpet is to hard to keep really clean - if you want to soften some rooms consider area rugs - this also gives you color flexibility for furniture changes, and not having to consider the wall to wall carpet.  I am an architect and we ripped out all of our carpet and installed a free floating engineered hardwood in our old house. We did the work ourselves. We love it. Best of luck.|`|64RamLeKaa	If you will keep this house for 5 years, do what you like because you can't predict the buyer's needs.  Or the buyer will change everything since they brought such a big house, may be they dont mind to spend more to make it as their dream home.      Here are my opinions:  1. Ceramic tile - For sure to have ceramic in the kitchen and bathrooms.  Once you choose the style, try different angles or pattern, because it looks completely different and it might surprise you.  I saw a picture on magazine which uses the ceramic for a big living room with a special pattern, which turns out very nice too.    2. Carpet - If I am the buyer, for sure I will change the carpet no matter how expensive it was, or how clean it is.  I want my new carpet!    3. Hardwood floor - It is very nice but cost a lot more than laminate.  Also if you have children, any toys dropping on the floor will cause damage very easily.    4. Laminate  It costs lower.  Good choice of color and installation are very important because it might have only 3-5 styles for one color, so to have a good mix and match to make it looks nature is not easy.|`|piJ7aDDyaa	hardwood does require a lot of manual upkeep and has a  nice appearancece to it between the applications of murphy soap and mopping it doesn't get as frigid as Ceramic does nor does it require grout being used as well. i think hard wood is a easier way to go as long as you stay on top of conditioning it, is more popular in most houses these days as well.|`|nkH9KUCVaa	Ceramic very cold in winter,if tiles get wet its turns to glass ,as we found out,went we moved into our house .Hardwood its the cost and upkeep .Carpets ok, we do not slip in high heels we are going all carpet|`|NeTNnvSZaa	I adore hardwoods, even in the bedrooms.  As far as resale goes, it would probably bring you more dollars to do hardwoods and use area rugs for now.  You will never get the wear out of a carpet that you will from a floor with a 50 year guarantee.|`|v3xEtuLLaa	I'm not a huge fan of wood floors in the kitchen or bath.  I have ceramic in them, as well as a ceramic entryway and hearth.  The living room and dining room are hardwood, and the rest is carpet.  I am in the process of taking it all out though.  I find carpet to be a pain.  It holds dirt (especially what you can't see), wears too easily, and restricts you with your colors unless you do all neutral, which I don't like.  My carpeting wasn't cheap, but I can't wait until it goes away.  For those who say that wood floors are cold, you can always use an area rug.  Hope this helps.

AHZ7fgQHaa	It is a way to buy a home with financing by the seller. The seller continues to hold the deed until you pay off the home. Often you can refinance with a regular mortgage and get the deed in your name after enough time has passed for you to have some amount of equity. Don't buy on a contract without an attorney reviewing the contract for you. There can be things written in that favor the seller. Land contracts can be a good way for some buyers, but keep in mind that the seller has repossession rights if you default on payments. I have both bought and sold property by contract. If you have more detailed questions, you can email me.|`|FXnHE7mmaa	Run far away from these...you might get lucky and get a great deal, but usually it is written with many loop holes and you will lose out..my opinion is not to get involved with this, but if you decide to do this, think long and hard and get yourself a really good lawyer..one that will scan every word and explain every single detail to you and your spouse.
AA10257357	Before you do all that take the tank lid off and replace the flapper in the tank, its the round rubber piece directly in the middle and at the bottom of the tank.  They become deformed or worn out and wont let the tank drain all the water before it closes.  this is the easiest and cheapest place to start,  2 dollars and ur done.|`|mP0LLMVjaa	My toilet was doing that and I removed it found that the wax ring was down in the drain.

If so, definitely a clog. May be further down the line than your snake could reach. Call a "rooter" service company. If not, the flapper might be dropping down too quickly, preventing all the water from exiting top tank. Make adjustment.|`|AA11228933	Take the toilet off and snake it.|`|ywOqliwKaa	1. remove the cover and make sure the reservoir is filling to the proper level (There should be a line). For proper flush, it must have enough water to start with.    2. When flushed, make sure the reservoir is emptying out good.    3. Remove toilet and roto rooter. A plumber is best because he will have the proper equipment to go far enough in the line and cut out what ever it is.
DGsYLEj0aa	Unless you want to rip up your driveway to install the radiant heat system, shovel and salt are about your only options.

b663010fec563a8838443a18a6bec461aa	If you're having problems with the cold water, but the hot side is okay, then the problem wouldn't be in the aerator.  It would be on the cold line somewhere.  If it's a two-handle faucet, it could be there's an obstruction in the cold valve stem.  Remove it and clean it.  When you install it use plumber's grease on the threads to insure that it opens all the way and won't stick when it's half-way open.  Also make sure you are using the correct seats and washers.  Use the same as the hot side.  Next, check your shut-off valve under the sink.  Remove it and clean it out.  It's common for obstructions to get caught at this valve.  Again, use plumber's grease on the threads.  If you still have a problem, you're going to have to investigate further up the line.|`|UQWusO1waa	like above, you got junk in the strainer on the end of the faucet. unscrew it nad clean it. and check the on off valves under the sink.|`|Iy0si0HYaa	it sounds like the aerator is clogged take it off its the screen at the tip of the faucet also make sure the cutoff valve under the sink is on all the way|`|hDtJOY2vaa	it sounds like you have a blockage on the cold side,shut of the water valve and remove the cold water stem,CLEAN it,you would be surprised what you can find.
Ba0AduWcaa	You can do it..  You will have to take it all down and rebuild it..  Just allow yourself maybe say 2 years to have it completed. Work on it every weekend until you get it done.   You seem pretty sharp and know whats up.  Any amatuer can do this provided they read up on it..  GO for it!|`|wiCikxUAaa	It's "creeping". Really no way to fix it other than taking it down and re-doing it. These type of walls use the "battering" method. Each successive course of stone should be slightly stepped back from the course below. This provides a natural mechanical advantage against the pressure of the earth being retained. They also have natural drainage just by the presence of all the gaps in between the stone. It's probably "creeping" because of water being retained behind the wall by compacted soil or roots. Make sure you loosen up the soil behind the wall when you reconstruct. Not a job for an amateur. You may want to get on-site guidance or hire a pro.

UQWusO1waa	in their desciption ,the "support system" replaces the box springs normally used as the support system. thats why is so thick.|`|aH0yYcTIaa	No, typically platforms don't require boxsprings cause they support the mattress without one|`|68e7a125a67f127a280f01fc8dbf5901aa	You don't need a box spring if the mattress is fully supported.  It would probably be too high with a platform, too.  Your bed won't 'bounce' without one, which takes a little getting used to.  When I first switched to a bed without springs, I had to learn not to flop down on it -- it's a bit bone jarring.  Just as comfortable to sleep on, though.|`|xXP91mYBaa	Buying a mattress online is like buying a pair of shoes with out trying them on first. There are plenty of reputable places to buy on line, however a brick and mortar store will give you the opportunity to compare different models side by side and will ultimately help you select the best, most comfortable, and supportive mattress. If price is the issue many brick and mortar stores will match online prices if out of line.    You do not use a boxspring with a platform bed.  An interesting blog  http://www.stlbeds.com/articles/2008/12/...|`|Oq5a5hRhaa	No, you don't use a box spring with a platform bed.    Be aware, though, that most US retailers do not sell mattresses that are designed to be used without a box spring, and that using the mattress without the matching box spring will void its warranty.
AA10257357	The problem is that you have a limit switch opened on your furnace.. Which causes the fan to run constantly and wont let the gas valve open.  Some limit switches are auto reset others are manual reset which means you must reset it yourself.  Take the front cover off of the furnace.  Look against the back part where all the electrical parts are.  First turn the breaker off please.  With out knowing the exact furnace just start looking at all the electrical componets and push any buttons you see on them you will know when you hit the right one, it will click.

AA11575518	It's the easiest way for a do it yourselfer to get water to the icemaker.  I think you probably found the cold water pipe under your sink. Pretty much the only other option is plumbing in a 1/4 in tee to your existing pipes the way all your other water pipes are connected.|`|ywOqliwKaa	Smog is correct.

If the existing valve is already compression fitted this will be a simple job. What ever you do , dont over tighten. You can always go back to tighten more, but if you over tighten, you may be meeting a new friend. The Plumber.|`|AA10257357	you can use or install a saddle valve under your sink on the cold water side, then run your 1/4" plastic tubing from the valve to under sink to the solenoid valve at the bottom of the frig. this is the easyist way and you dont have to shut off any water to do so.  Another way is to replace the cold water shut off under the sink with a duel outlet shut off valve.  One side connects to your cold water for the sink and the other connects to your ice maker water line.  You will have to shut offf the water to your house to do this though.  Hope this helps

4rYDpMAgaa	Actually bleach is a temporary solution.  It mainly removes the stains, but does not kill all the spores.    You have to find the source of the moisture which is making an ideal environment for the mold to grow and multiply.    Some molds are hazardous to your health - namely the black molds.    From what you describe you likely have a pennicilan type mold.    Is the mold growing near an outside wall or near a wall dividing a washroom or kitchen sink area?    washroom or kitchen sink area:    If so the source of water is likely from leaky plumbing or spilled/splashed water is seaping through the walls.    You can check if the caulking is in good condition around a bath-tub - if it is missing or cracked, clean out the old caulking and replace with a good quality silicone caulking for this purpose.    near an outside wall:    You must have the Landlord/property owner check and repair this.  If left it will also cause very costly structual damage.    Good Luck    PS: your carpeT may have to be thrown out.

Spray everything thoroughly, open the windows, close the door and leave.  Wipe down 30-60 minutes later but do not wash.  Repeat if necessary.   I would recommend following up with new paint.  Start by sealing the old with Kilz as a sealer, then your regular paint on top. You might check with your local Health unit or building inspector to see if there are any regulations they can enforce to get you new flooring.  Mould can cause many problematic health issues if left unattended. Good luck|`|mP0LLMVjaa	Buy a gallon of white vinegar($2.50at drocery store). Put some in a spray bottle and spray the carpet.

AA10257357	You do not want to flush your dryer vent ( im guessing with water ).  It should remain as dry as possible.  Take the vent loose at dryer, then you can take a leaf blower and clear the flex vent. Should remove all the lint build up.  If not then find the mid point of the flex vent and cut it in half, now you can clean it from both ends..To put it back together get a 4" x 8" piece of duct pipe.  4" round by 8" long.
