20081115144653AA5VCdb	News & Events;Current Events	Given Obama's masterful campaign, particularly his use of the Internet, do you see a new age in communications?	Like him or not, Obama ran one hell of a campaign.  Two years ago, would you ever have imagined a man with the name of Barack Hussein Obama would be elected President?  Yet he ran a cohesive, intelligent campaign that used the internet masterfully.  Now, word is that Obama will deliver a weekly "radio" address similar to the fireside chats given by FDR - and that they will also be broadcast over the Internet.  It looks as though Obama will take his Presidency directly to the people - bypassing the media altogether.  What does this say about the media, particularly outlets like Fox News, and how they will represent politics in the future?
