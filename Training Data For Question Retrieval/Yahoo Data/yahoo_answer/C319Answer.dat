pR4Hwmpbaa	I have Life #3: Close family members, most of my "friends" only want me around when they want me to be, and my social life is basically non-existent. When I do have a girlfriend, she generally doesn't stay with me for long. <br>  <br>  <br>  I'd rather have a good woman who would love me and stay with me than have lots of friends. Good friends are nice. But I am so lonely I need a good female companion even more...|`|hyqf7xR0aa	not sure any of us really have a choice about which one they get.

pR4Hwmpbaa	Sure. It happens. <br>  <br>  But most of the time it is just "puppy love" & not the kind that lasts forever...|`|h7F4wA7eaa	No when your in Junior high they may think their in love but its just a crush and puppy love lol!|`|y5FfKGAsaa	It's possible, not very likely, but it can happen.<br>  ?|`|wa8ISRH8aa	Love & in Love are two different things,but then again thats awful young to know what love is,so I seriously doubt it...>=)|`|LdjNYhLlaa	NO!<br>  <br>  sorry but kids in high school think they are grown up but hey are'nt.<br>  <br>  They can't fall in love because they don't know what it is<br>  <br>  Believe me I would love to say that love is pure and has no age limit, but the way tings are now, that just doesnt happen|`|MlraNN6Maa	I know only one couple that would answer yes to your question. They first met in grade 7, and now they're still strong, and in their first year of university.<br>  <br>  So, yes. As much as I myself think its highly unlikely, junior high kids always have the capacity to be able to fall in love.|`|uE2aOqeNaa	Simple fact is no<br>  <br>  I will even go as far as to say you have no idea what love in until you have a kid.<br>  <br>  When your a phucking little kid in school you haven't got the slightest idea of what love is let alone how truly powerful it is|`|rrMYRLpXaa	Not "in love". I think that they can "luv" someone, but definitely not be "in love". <br>  I guess it could happen, though...but feelings are easily confused.|`|e8J0wgcKaa	real love has no age <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  unless its illegal of course but sometimes people confuse love with crush especially at that young age|`|uORkBZOKaa	yes. love has no age limit|`|hyqf7xR0aa	no. i think that strong emotions are both underdeveloped and entirely new to people in that age group and that their inexperience with coping with these emotions lead them to believe very dramatic things, confusing one feeling for another|`|2c4e6005843e2624086af284a2e71120aa	Yes, because I did when I was only thirteen. It's stupid to belittle someone's emotions just because they're young.

AA11736322	i agree with sweet pate ...school uniform is cheaper and two to three are sufficient for whole week but if you want dress casual then you are forced to  follow fashion because of peer pressure which is more costly.|`|TuGkVqwraa	Upto 10th it must be compulsory because that a sort of discipline.|`|ybtOvNs7aa	yes it should be compulsory.. coz parents doesnt have to buy new dress every month.<br>  <br>  two pairs of uniform will do for them for the whole year <br>  Nyuk Nyuk Nyuk|`|EHSfXKfQaa	yes..|`|AA12321514	If you talk about India then answer is YES.<br>  <br>  My math teacher used to say that school students must stand out different from thugs. What I mean by that is if students are not in uniform, how will the principal know who is the student and who is not.|`|NHRzDYNPaa	Yes, i think uniforms are necessary in schools, 'coz then we as girls would need matching accesories to go with them.... + if we go with expensive clothes on, other children would feel bad cuz they dont have such kind of clothes, so...i think we must have school uniforms...THEY ARE ABSOUTELY NECESSARY.... :-)<br>  <br>  P.S. : I also would like to agree with VJ.. :D<br>  <br>  Keep smiling !! :D|`|pR4Hwmpbaa	If I was still in school my answer would be "no" because I would not have wanted to wear one. But now that I am older, I see the reason why schools have uniforms. <br>  <br>  I'd be cool with it as long as I didn't have to wear it myself. <br>  <br>  (Pretty selfish of me, huh?) <br>  <br>  <br>  ;P|`|XHTlAFcpaa	hmmmmmmmmm....<br>  lol,i think uniforms shudd be there,<br>  but in a limited manner....sorta like...ummmmm...different uniforms for different days...that makes it not monotonous and boring...|`|9h29IH22aa	b compulsory- because if we go in school without uniform they will think it's a behooropiyaa and won't allow us<br>  <br>  not b conpulsory- it's boring!|`|jKDZlgMiaa	Uniforms cost a lot less than regular clothes.|`|a678a069d43bd5df52f54a3f3ef6cdd0aa	NOOOOO.<br>  its horrible..<br>  sometimes the cotton tickles :(|`|uE2aOqeNaa	As long as the girl I am dating will put one on on occasion I'm cool|`|1n6LMCS3aa	You know I once saw a video that had children in uniforms. They were so happy, marching around smiling and waving. I couldn't understand the video for it was all in German and made around 1940.<br>  <br>  <br>  No, uniforms are a dumb idea. "Lets teach kids to be individuals, together". Let the kids wear what they want. Lets try not to suppress individual thought.|`|NigoVXX1aa	Uniform is a must otherwise the rich and the poor problem will start.We all go to school to learn and get discipline which we later in our life have to stay in its limit.Uniforms are signs of the school itself.|`|GHHiHlX2aa	school uniform is important and it should be compulsory as well , as it not only helps students learn discipline , but they learn that they are equal and they can concentrate on there studies without getting panic about fashion n style statements .|`|a2b8641f3900ff3887ba8bb3aa67fb65aa	*Yes !!!<br>  If u want to know the reason ..... in terms of recession, <br>  then in the long run, the cost of uniform is much much less as compared to regular clothes.....<br>  while a pair of uniform is ok for a whole week, a girl may require 5 or 6 dresses ....plus matching accessories to go with each dress ...think !!~?|`|hyqf7xR0aa	yes i do. i feel that kids should wear uniforms to school. <br>  <br>  why? because it completely eliminates popularity contests that arise between children when a new $120 pair of sneakers hits the stores. <br>  <br>  uniforms encourage discipline and obedience. uniforms force conformity and that leads to people focusing more on education.

RsYmnu9Baa	I don't think it is silly. I wear an apron while cooking etc. In fact I usually put on an apron in the morning when I start my housework and leave it on most of the day.  Aprons are really making a come back, especially vintage styles like I wear.|`|tmwOwc0Laa	only thing i usually cook myself is some eggs or top roman....and no i dont wear a apron|`|C6ZJcNJjaa	Frozen pizza does not require an apron.

5GW5xGCwaa	I've done E five times.  All of them the best nights of my life.  Did them with my closest friends.  Four times at raves, I love electro and it just made it that much more enjoyable.  I'm so much closer with my friends as a result.  And I'm not e-tarded.  I was going through college and I didn't have any trouble and I earned my degree.  <br>  <br>  Its the best high I've ever experienced.  You feel amazing.  But it's not like being drunk or stoned where you feel out of your head and super hazy.  You're totally aware of everything.  You love to touch everything and be touched because it feels amazing.  It just sends pleasure everywhere.  And you are so happy.  You don't feel one ounce of anxiety and if you are with friends you love it just turns into a cuddle/love/dance fest and you just want to be near them.  You also want to be kind to strangers and they want to be kind to you.  You always make a new friend if you do it at a rave.  One pill will have you rolling for a couple hours.  Usually at a rave you end up taking 3ish, sometimes more because those things last several hours.  The come down is pretty rough because you can't sleep and you've burned up all of your seratonin so you feel a little emotionally drained.  But it has always been well worth it to me.  <br>  <br>  I would say it's not for everyone though.  I've been really lucky that I've never had a bad experience because some people do and I seem to bounce back quickly without being e-tarded and I haven't noticed any sort of decrease in my reaction time or long/short term memory.  But some people aren't so lucky.  I've seen kids carried out of concerts on gurnies because the either dehydrated themselves, overhydrated themselves (a lot of kids have died this way), or they didn't eat a full meal before taking pills. <br>  <br>  So you definitely have to prepare and make sure you've got your best friends with you in case things turn.  Plus its just more fun being with your friends because you are totally open with them and you're able to talk about how close you feel to them and you gain this immense bonds because of the chemicals it causes your bodies to release.  They have the same effect as the oxytocin that is released when a mother breast feeds her child.  In fact it is the same chemical reaction exactly, so you aren't just imagining the bond, it's physically happening.  <br>  <br>  I could go on about how positive the experience is for some people.  But again, like I said, if you can't take necessary precautions before and won't have people that can take care of you, I'd be really careful about what you take.  There is no such thing as doing this drug safely, but if you do it right you'll have the best night of your life.|`|ybWV2ftAaa	yes both, ecstasy was more fun.  acid makes u trip and makes  see things and whatnot.. I took it at work with the kid who gave it to me.  on the drive home the tree's were like going over the road and **** it was crazy.  E makes you emotional and made me very happy.  I was listening to music for like 3 hours jumping around and swinging my head in circles lol.  I felt like i was part of the music or i was notorious b.i.g. on stage or some **** lol it was awesome|`|USooqQlWaa	Are you allowed to ask this - am I allowed to answer this?  I don't care I'm just curious...and if I actually answer this honestly with the DEA storm my house?<br>  <br>  The answer would be yes.  The first I did not like and the latter I like too much.  I'm not saying anything more.|`|G1RSGj9yaa	no|`|QH02h9REaa	tried acid one time but i guess i got some weak stuff cause i barely felt anything. Also tried ecstasy twice a couple years ago, and wow is that a drug. Think of the happiest moment in your life and it's hardly compares to how happy you are on this drug. Music and lights are amazing. It lasts usually between 4 to 6 hours. However, a lot of people tend to get really depressed when they come down because it uses up most of the chemicals in the brain that make you happy. Also, because of how happy you get it is a really easy drug to get addicted to and it has terrible effects and the body and especially the  brain so i really do advise using alot of caution with this drug|`|ZkjClLaKaa	I have tried both, I love ecstasy the best (its my favorite, next to weed). It felt very good, everything was beautiful. Last time i did E at my friend's place, I waited an hour for the effect to kick in, then I lied down on my friend's bed, listening to some industrial rock. I just lied on the bed, tripping out. But about 2 hours later, I felt really horny. I wanted to like.. you know with my friend's sister when she came in. (he was cool with the fact that I liked her). She knew I was on E, so she offered to cuddle n make out with me, so I did. It felt that I was even more affectionate toward her due to the E. How long it lasted? seven hours for me. But the coming down from the E is kinda bad. I got angry and agressive two days after. But it went away fast for me.|`|99f1779a85ee7a66097c0739e60bfd27aa	i did acid a few times... im not gonna lie, it was kind of fun. but probably one of the stupidest things i have ever done.<br>  <br>  when your on acid, all your thoughts become a reality. it can really freak you out. i was walking home on acid one night, and thought the sky was caving in on me, so i dropped to the ground and covered my head. i'm sure i looked like a real idiot lol.|`|0eArONZraa	naww, i only smoke kush, i dont mess with any other drug other than a blunt|`|OPKbGXUFaa	No..<br>  <br>  Drugs are bad for you.

sy8xDtpnaa	"Mariah from the 90's" is still Mariah. Everything she is now is represented in her work. Asking her to stay the same would mean no growth for this talented succesful artist. Mariah grows with her music. True fans would know. If the lesson she felt she learned today is that she needs to kick back a bit more, then maybe that's what she becomes and as a result we get a playful Touch my body. Mariah can still belt as good as she used to, it just has to become boring having to prove yourself all the time. Her ballads are still as infectious as ever. You should just allow urself to  embrace new things and change. Any true artist evolves. It's a good thing! Wardrobe? I think she deserves the right to toy around a bit. Mariah has a solid foundation in music. She aint going no where.|`|3jFm0rWdaa	She became a celebrity instead of a musician.|`|BBVfRheyaa	Getting older.|`|rGvlPAMJaa	I miss her face, now she looks all stretched out and lighter.

There were only a few things from "Butterfly" that I liked, I thought certain songs were decent enough, but there were certain things that were blatantly luscivious such as that song "Honey" (Ew!!) and her being overtly flirtatious in front of that boy in that "My All" music video made me go "What the heck?!!". That's Mariah I guess and I suppose the butterfly symbolizes her flying free from the "girl-next-door" formula and it's really too bad though because she's really scary now and it doesn't make her a good role model to all the teenage girls out there in the world...well at least there's Leona Lewis, Beyonce and Alicia Keys to make up for that.|`|YhuH2k4Caa	she still has the same voice...but her style and genre of music has slightly changed. either way shes still good. i even think her glitter album was nicely done. yes i said it. lol|`|Ysq3N0UCaa	Yeaaa Soo Much :(<br>  She Was Amazing Back Then<br>  Her Voice Was Perfect<br>  Now It's Just ...

aleWoJufaa	yes, you can't find them in suburban neighbourhoods<br>  <br>  they have to stay downtown <br>  <br>  yes - giving them blankets, pillows, food and drinks is better than giving a lot of cash - though they still need some money in their pockets|`|hyqf7xR0aa	uh... by poor person, do you mean homeless person? <br>  <br>  i'd sooner give homeless people money. if they want to buy booze with it, that's their business. the booze may be the only thing that keeps them going.|`|3buQDaRDaa	Homeless people usually have a mental illness.

8OREBeRdaa	I don't have a ponytail now, so it doesn't matter. <br>  <br>  But if you cut my pony tail off say, before last November, I would ask you "Is there enough to give to the Cancer Kids to make wigs for them?<br>  If you said Yes, I'd say "Thanks", then mail the hair in like I did last November, and then go get a trim.  <br>  <br>  If you said No.  There'd be 2 sounds, me hitting you and you hitting the floor.  Then I'd drag your unconscious body to the Sick Kids Hospital.  Duct tape you to a chair in the Cancer Ward for kids and then say "This person is going to explain to you kids why I can't donate my hair to you to make wigs out of."  Then I'd turn to you and say "Take it away, b&tch!"|`|3m6wrCqraa	I'd scream and chase after you with a pair of scissors and try to cut off YOUR ponytail.

adLSRFrZaa	"Low (1977)" is my very favorite David Bowie album.  The dual nature of the album, one fast side and one slow side seems to have been inspired by Can's "Tago Mago (1971)."  That dual nature of Low has inpired countless other albums like "Remain In Light (1980)" and "The Downward Spiral (1994)" by Nine Inch Nails.<br>  <br>  I love the style of Low, and since it was released in 1977, it is arguably one of the first New Wave albums.  "Station to Station (1976)" never clicked with me; however, I do love "Young Americans (1975)."|`|fzqMOD4Waa	Station to Station<br>  <br>  It is my honest opinion that there is no finer David Bowie album.

5Z90vsGJaa	yea i took me about 15 mintues to learn since i played a viola a year before playing a violin. being so, the only thing i was working on was a different clef reading.<br>  <br>  it took me from beginner's level to advanced level in about 2 years for playing a violin. i devoted almost everyday in practicing for about 3-4 hours a day until i was fluent in those darn 3rd octive scales going all the way to 6+ positions. <br>  <br>  tips: practice! that seems to be the only key. find your difficulties in a piece of music, ignore the parts you're fluent in and work on key concepts. Also, if you've got a private teacher, you've earned yourself a lighter load. But seriously, practice. it really is the importance. I'm telling you this from my experience.<br>  <br>  as for my viola that i first started off with, it took me less than half a year/a couple of months to learn starting with pizzicato all the way to square one.|`|4lqwMnhJaa	I've been playing for eight years but I'm still learning!<br>  Of course I'm only 14, but still.

I have been playing violin for 22 years (God, I'm old) and still learn new things every time I play.<br>  <br>  My advice to you is to do it right the first time.  Many technique and postural aspects of violin playing have a specific purpose, such as facilitating more advanced skills or avoiding injury.  If you try to break the mold here, you will eventually have to go back and train the negative behaviors out and re-insert the correct ones.<br>  <br>  Every little detail is important.  This includes being able to read the music you are playing.  Take the time and learn to read the music while you are beginning.  Cutting corners here will actually hold you back from playing more advanced pieces as your skills improve.  It's rare to see a person playing a Mozart concerto or Bach partita with all the notes written in!<br>  <br>  Take your time as a beginner.  Make sure you follow your teacher's directions and make sure you have learned the skill before moving on.  It will seem tedious to you now but the rewards will be great!|`|ns7u7K3maa	Yup!! I've been playing for a couple of years now. When you're first starting, you'll be holding it sort of like a guitar or a banjo, to get you used to it, and you'll start by plucking. Then, you'll hold it up with your hand at the end of the violin, and finally, you'll be using the bow. Personally, it didn't take me long to learn because I was/am pretty good at sight reading. This is ONLY because I play the piano, and so one stave is easier to learn than two! If you play another instrument (like piano) this won't be hard. If not, it still won't be hard to read the notes. However, make sure that before you play, the violin is in tune, make sure that you're using the bow on the correct area depending on the music, and have fun! When I was learning Piano, my biggest annoyance was by not having fun. Since I'm having fun with violin, it's a lot more enjoyable! Just remember that, and have fun x)|`|AZ0FgB06aa	when u are holding your violin with your left hand, keep it still and straight but don't too stiff when you are performing.<br>  Make sure your bow is straight when you are playing, to avoid the noisy sounds. one more ^^ when you are playing with the bow, let your bow play smooth enough and use a certain strength to play it. If you don't, your violin will sound like ..... X_X|`|64R1DrtHaa	I've been playing the violin for 7 years and am at grade 7 standard. I aim for a grade a year.

chHPoiThaa	*******<br>  <br>  Etymology<br>  <br>  The word "*******" is a relatively new disparaging term for "an illegal Mexican immigrant or worker who crosses the Rio Grande into the United States, sometimes swimming to get across" (Hendrickson, 1997). There is some debate as to when the word was first recorded. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first recorded use of the word was in 1929 when Foreign Affairs used it to refer to a peon that walks or swims across and is welcomed by countrymen as a ‘*******’. However, according to the Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins, the first recorded use was in 1948 when the number of illegal Mexicans swarming the United States increased by a significantly large percentage.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Semantics<br>  <br>  The word "*******" became widely used when the United States became involved in a military operation known as Operation *******. Post World War II, millions of Mexicans swarmed to the United States as the demand for cheap agricultural laborers increased. Between 1944 and 1954, known as "the decade of the *******," "the number of illegal Mexican alien workers swimming across the Rio Grande to the United States increased by 6,000 percent" (Operation *******, 1997).<br>  <br>  As a result, in 1954 Operation ******* got under way as a national reaction against illegal immigration. Commissioner of INS, Joseph Swing oversaw the Border patrol, and organized state and local officials along with the police. The purpose of border enforcement was "illegal aliens," but Operation ******* became strictly focused on Mexicans in general. Officials swarmed Mexican American neighborhoods in southeastern states. Some Mexicans, "fearful of the potential violence of this militarization, fled back south across the border" (Operation *******, 1997). In 1954, the agents discovered over one million illegal immigrants. Many of the illegal immigrants were deported to Mexico by trucks, buses, trains, and even ships. In some cases, "illegal immigrants were deported along with their American-born children, who were by law U.S. citizens" (Operation *******, 1997). The agents used a broad criterion for determining who were potential aliens. They began racial profiling of Mexicans on the street. This practice incited and angered many U.S. citizens who were of Mexican American descent. "Opponents in both the United States and Mexico complained of "police-state" methods, and Operation ******* was abandoned" (Operation *******, 1997).<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Cultural Adoption<br>  <br>  After Operation *******, the term became very popular among American culture as a way of defining Mexicans. Eventually, the term began to be used to refer to all Hispanics in general. To a Hispanic, the word "*******" is just as derogatory as the word "******" to an African American. In fact, in 1997, Mary Ann Vigil took her employer to court after she claimed that while "working as a department clerk typist at the Las Cruces International Airport, her supervisor "frequently" referred to Hispanics as "wetbacks," and, in response to complaints that Hispanic customers were overcharged, stated, "I didn't know that Mexicans had rights."" (Mary Ann Vigil v. City of Las Cruces, 1997). Judges ruled against Vigil in this case because they felt that a couple of isolated comments did not truly constitute racial discrimination or bigotry. However, the case is worthy of mention because it shows the anger that a term like "*******" arises among the Hispanic community.<br>  <br>  In certain parts of the United States, the word appears to be more prominent than in other places. For instance, according to Dan Marlowe, a Sante Fe attorney from Oakland, "he didn’t know what racism was until he came to New Mexico and noticed how often New Mexicans referred to Mexicans as "mojados," or wetbacks" (Not Much of a Joke, 1999, pg. 3).<br>  <br>  Similarly, during an Assembly Ways and Means Committee hearing in Nevada, politician John Marvel "averred as to how ‘*******’ laborers might be hired to do repair work because they were good at working with adobe" (Not Much of a Joke, 1999). The assemblyman tried to explain that he was just trying to "make a joke." However, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal, as an educated man and politician, John Marvel surely knew that "referring to immigrants as "wetbacks" is offensive to Hispanics and non-Hispanics alike" (Not Much of a Joke, 1999).<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, many Hispanics grow up in communities where they are constantly haunted by the use of the term "*******". For instance, Rafael Espinoza is Salvadoran, born in El Salvador. He came to the United States on his own at the age of 15. He is now a 30-year-old union leader, the father of the three children, and married to a Caucasian woman. He explained in an interview that the first word he learned when arriving in this country was "*******." (Steinberg, 1998). Similar to Rafael, many Hispanics, even Hispanic-Americans, are exposed to this term daily.

They scare you into believing that you need botox to be young.  Did you not take your meds today?  I swore I told all the girls to give you your happy pill and a pair of panties for you to hold on too.  There there, your not going to die.  I will give you better images to put you at ease!  *wink|`|WT9cjXtIaa	You should see some of the smoking ads on TV here Scoundrel. They give you the worst of the worst images. I agree that public awareness is necessary, but some of the ads take it a bit too far with the graphic nature. <br>  <br>  The fact remains that were all going to die of something someday. And it's all a mater of picking your poison. Very few live to be 100 and die peacefully in their sleep.|`|qdPtCBJeaa	I have heard that its good to have a glass or 2 of wine in the evening.......<br>  I think I'm good to go.<br>  <br>  No Ted....I want to live  forever...LOL<br>  <br>  and thanks for joining me...it was lonely on page 2 all by myself.|`|ba4R1tf1aa	Here's a little prezzie for you, to forget about all of that sort of thing...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idd_92ajjwY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idd_92ajj...</a><br>  <br>  (If you look really carefully, you can see her knickers through her dress...)|`|6U9b2t4raa	I believe what is going to kill you will be a scorned mistress or possibly two. Ok maybe 3, but absolutely no more than 6.<br>  <br>    <br>  Maggs-   you could stop drinking for the next 6 months, and still be on schedule.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	My experience is just the opposite. I am sick of advertisements that show deliriously happy people made happy by whatever the advertiser is trying to sell. The worst are those advertising prescription drugs. People assume if they could take that particular medicine their lives would improve and they too could be running down the beach giddy with joy. Around the holidays you are bombarded with happy families that make your family holiday seem pitiful and to wonder why you and your family can't be 'like the rest of the world."|`|ce7ea7f83a5ba171eb4ef78c629b25a3aa	I do agree that some of the images can be disturbing to the more sensitive of people but people do need to be aware because so many are still ignorant to the dangers/symptoms of all the above. If those adverts are saving lives every year then they are doing the job that was intended :-)|`|53216puqaa	Stuff the Barmy B******** I ain't goin' !

Orthodox drugs are just a hit they are bad for our long term health and have side effects<br>  <br>  If we were all well they wouldn't make money....FACT!<br>  <br>  I have also noticed that animals get operations quicker and better after-care.<br>  <br>  If I am sick I use my mind to give me strength otherwise I would just shrivel up and let the doctor be the judge bollock#s to that.|`|oQ2Rn2hpaa	Old scoundrels NEVER die, WES ...<br>  they just fade into the background, twirling their muzzies and chortling a sly chortle until the heat's off and the coast is once again clear.<br>  You've nothing to worry about, old boy.<br>  Chin chin!|`|uqnQ9Y9haa	The minute were born were dying so it really makes no difference,<br>   frigg to all the stressing adds and just live a life full of sin i say   :)|`|A7QROnjLaa	Yeah the f***ing nannies always go too far with stuff like this.... all they will succeed in doing is depressing people. lol|`|T7HuKzZcaa	You are going to die--  unprotected sex with multiple partners<br>  <br>  phooey!!|`|hh892gJfaa	Everyone is going to die.

TM3M3nrfaa	Hahaha.... a nice one!<br>  <br>  Hear this... (7 kinds of sex)<br>  <br>  The 1st kind of sex is called: Smurf Sex.<br>  This kind of sex happens when you first meet someone and you both have sex until you are blue in the face.<br>  <br>  The 2nd kind of sex is called: Kitchen Sex.<br>  This is when you have been with your partner for a short time and you are so horny you will have sex anywhere, even in the kitchen.<br>  <br>  The 3rd kind of sex is called: Bedroom Sex<br>  This is when you have been with your partner for a long time. Your sex has gotten routine and you usually have sex only in your bedroom.<br>  <br>  The 4th kind of sex is called: Hallway Sex.<br>  This is when you have been with your partner for too long. When you pass each other in the hallway you both say "screw you."<br>  <br>  The 5th kind of sex is called: Religious Sex.<br>  Which means you get Nun in the morning, Nun in the Afternoon and Nun at night. (Very Popular)<br>  <br>  The 6th kind of sex is called: Courtroom Sex.<br>  This is when you cannot stand your wife any more. She takes you to court and screws you in front of everyone.<br>  <br>  And last, but not least, the 7th kind of sex is called: Social Security Sex.<br>  You get a little each month.

pljzOzReaa	Jim Morrison was arrested a few times.  Most of the causes for the arrest are a little bit vague but I will include as much as I know.  I once had this police report for New Haven and it had a list of all prior arrests. I can't find it but hopefully I will be able to locate it later and be able to verify that I included them all.<br>  <br>  The first arrest was on September 28, 1963.  Jim was in Florida State (in Tallahassee.)  From what I read, Jim was drunk during a football game and was making fun of the football players and some of the people attending; he was getting rowdy.  Apparently, he then stole an umbrella and a officer's helmet from a police car.  I have read that he resisted arrest and was being difficult for the officers that arrested him.  Later on the charges were dropped and he only had to pay a small fine.  This is his mugshot:  <a href="http://i.realone.com/assets/rn/img/3/7/9/1/17061973-17061975-large.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i.realone.com/assets/rn/img/3/7/9...</a><br>  <br>  The next "major" arrest was on December 9, 1967.  The Doors were scheduled to perform at New Haven, CT.  Jim went out to dinner prior to the concert and then arrived at the venue.  In his dressing/prep room he met a girl.  He wanted more privacy with the girl so he went into a shower stall area (the venue also served for sporting events.)  Jim has said that while in the room he was just talking to the girl and a cop came in the room.  He rudely told Jim and the girl that they had to leave.  Jim told him that he was in the band and told him to go away.  The cop got pushy with Jim and Jim tried to push him away.  Then the cop maced him.  The police wanted to arrest Jim then but were afraid that the large crowd would start a riot.  By this time the other band members and crew heard and told the cop that Jim was the lead singer of the band.  After identifying Jim the cop apologized about the incident.  During their last song, Backdoor Man, Jim told a story about what happened backstage.  The cops shut them down and came directly onstage to arrest him (this was the first arrest like this in music history.)  He was charged with breach of peace, resisting arrest and indecent or immoral exhibition and something dumb like inciting a riot.  After his arrest he was taken to the station; it seems that he was beaten up pretty badly.  All charges were dropped the next day. Here is video of the arrest, I love the face he makes, also it does not appear that he is resisting arrest at all: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzKrbn9YahI&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzKrbn9Ya...</a> Mugshot: <a href="http://sivers.org/images/jim.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://sivers.org/images/jim.jpg</a> Other pictures from this concert (you can see the effect of the mace on his eyes.) <a href="http://crystal-ship.com/images.php?fld=1967%2F9+d%E9cembre+%28New+Haven+Arena+-+New+Haven%2C+CT%29" rel="nofollow">http://crystal-ship.com/images.php?fld=1...</a><br>  <br>  On March 1, 1969 Jim performed with The Doors at the Dinner Key Auditorium in Miami.  Jim was extremely drunk and said some indecent things (not worthy of arrest in my opinion.)  Trying to recreate the atmosphere of a Living Theater show he saw in the previous week he said he was going to expose himself.  There is absolutely no proof of him exposing himself.  After the concert the band sat with the cops and talked and drank.  A cop was paid for his hat that Jim threw into the crowd.  Everyone was having fun and there was no conflict.  The Doors then went on their planned vacation.  A politician heard of this concert later on and got an arrest for him and the whole ordeal started.   He was charged with a felony and five misdemeanors, the felony was lewd and lascivious behavior two misdemeanors for public profanity, two of public exposure and one of public drunkenness.  Videos are about the arrest <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ap2GNPsXPM" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ap2GNPsX...</a>  Mugshot: <a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3235/2596132673_3741e2582c.jpg?v=0" rel="nofollow">http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3235/2596...</a><br>  <br>  He was also arrested in an airport in Phoenix on November 11, 1969.  Jim was drunk on an airplane and was being loud and rude.  It is said that he was messing with the stewardesses and just generally being obnoxious.  He was charged with something like interfering with the flight of an airplane. I can't find the mugshot, sorry.<br>  <br>  I think there have been other incidents in which Jim was arrested for something such as drunkenness but quickly released without any real ordeal. For example, Jim was arrested in Vegas in 1968 for being drunk and loud in a club.  He was later released with not much else said.

Besides, if you let someone know that something has hurt you, they know how to do it again.<br>  <br>  Anyway, why should i bother complaining? There's always worse things. <br>  I have a cold- so what, one of my friends has cancer. <br>  My boyfriend just dumped me. So what? I have a happy healthy family. <br>  I miss mum and dad when i'm away at school- so what, at least i will see them again.<br>  <br>  I don't think we have the right to burden others with our silly pains and worries when they probably have worse things on their plates.|`|2hx7eEtsaa	Keep it to myself, it is inconsiderate to share it with others.

Depends on how personal the subject is, or if I really need a sounding board, advice, or opinions. I think it's important to have people in our lives who we can trust enough to share our hearts with. "Stuffing" or suppressing our emotions is a survival tool, but one that usually causes emotional damage, can keep a person from learning to connect with others on a deeper level, and can often times build and build until you have to release it and go off on someone or do something drastic. It can lead to a self destructive pattern. I think it's emotionally healthy to be able to share your thoughts and feelings. Just pick and choose wisely who you open yourself up to. If it's someone who truly cares about you and has your best interest in mind, they'll be there for you, and it won't be a burden to them. That's what friends and loved ones are for, you know. :) Take care!|`|5pnl6uoPaa	both i am currently going through a very tough time and i tend to push people away when im hurting but it doesn't help. i been doing this all my life im more mature and understand the importance of sharing.. most people do not like to share because it is a very difficult place to be vulnerable especially guys. me im ok with it now it took all my life to finally realize its ok to let people in thas how trust is built and you realize you are not alone. its called not being so macho for the guys and for the ladies dont worry about telling another person because how they may feel it is you that they should be concerned about...bam|`|zD7bHkSyaa	by myself.<br>  no one ever knows when I'm in pain, I'm good at hiding it.

Y1aAGPURaa	They were sooo funny!!  Here are a couple "oldie" but goodies for you:<br>  <br>  A young man saw an elderly couple sitting down to lunch at McDonald's. He noticed that they had ordered one meal, and an extra drink cup. As he watched, the gentleman carefully divided the hamburger in half, then counted out the fries, one for him, one for her, until each had half of them. Then he poured half of the soft drink into the extra cup and set that in front of his wife. The old man then began to eat, and his wife sat watching, with her hands folded in her lap. <br>  <br>  The young man decided to ask if they would allow him to purchase another meal for them so that they didn't have to split theirs. <br>  <br>  The old gentleman said, "Oh no. We've been married 50 years, and everything has always been and will always be shared, 50/50." <br>  <br>  The young man then asked the wife if she was going to eat, and she replied, "It's his turn with the teeth." <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  Arthur is 90 years old. He's played golf every day since his retirement 25 years ago.<br>     One day he arrives home looking downcast. <br>     "That's it," he tells his wife. "I'm giving up golf. My eyesight has gotten so bad that once I've hit the ball, I can't see where it went."<br>     His wife sympathizes and makes him a cup of tea. As they sit down, she says,  "Why don't you take my brother with you and give it one more try."<br>   "That's no good," sighs Arthur. "Your brother's a hundred and three. He can't help."<br>   "He may be a hundred and three," says the wife, "but his eyesight is perfect."<br>   So the next day, Arthur heads off to the golf course with his   brother-in-law. He tees up, takes an almighty swing, and squints down the fairway.<br>   He turns to the brother-in-law. "Did you see the ball?"<br>   "Of course I did!" replies the brother-in-law. "I have perfect eyesight."<br>   "Where did it go?" asks Arthur.<br>   "I don't remember."|`|POqwp3Fiaa	Ha ha ha, very good, all of them, ha ha ha...!|`|a4d058c8147c73c6850008930a755284aa	Well I like the last one.

Y1aAGPURaa	LOL!!!! Here's one for you:<br>  .<br>  Two police officers saw this old woman staggering down the street, stopping her they can tell she has had far too much to drink and instead of taking her to jail they decide to just drive her home. They loaded her into the police cruiser one of the officers gets in the back with the drunk woman.<br>  <br>  As they drove through the streets they kept asking the woman where she lived, all she would say as she stroked the officers arm is "Your Passionate" They drove awhile longer and asked again, again the same response as she stroked his arm "Your Passionate". The officers were getting a little upset so they stopped the car and said to the woman, Look we have driven around this City for two hours and you still haven't told us where you live. <br>  <br>  She replied I keep trying to tell you: "Your Passin It!"|`|POqwp3Fiaa	Ha ha ha, some cracking humour about the elderly, great stuff...!|`|HXpR2bw0aa	Hahaa, some of those are really funny.

Wi0LBsVbaa	You need to copyright anything that is PUBLISHED, this includes putting it out on the web! You need to investigate the copyright rules of your country as well as reciprocity of said copyright in other countries. This will not prevent theft but will give you legal recourse in the event.<br>  A search on "copyright" should give you what you need to know. (All unpublished manuscripts are protected by law).<br>  i jones is right as always, I believe a notarized manuscript is also sufficient though.|`|vsy4QMHMaa	The theory is that if you mail a copy of the sheet music to yourself using registered mail ... where it is logged by the post office, hand date stamped, delivered to your home where you have to sign for it, then never open the package until you're defending yourself in the court of law ... probably has to be opened in front of witnesses with a notary present ... that it would be evidential that the composition is your original music. [EDIT: I'm not advocating this, it actually costs more than application for copyright, and often won't hold up in courts ... certainly not in international court.]<br>  <br>  Or you can just assert your right to ownership with a copyright notice.  <br>  <br>  .... to have the copyright registered you need to work through the copyright office within your government, and/or foreign governments to register an international copyright.|`|obGQ2Bqfaa	Just assert your copyright when you publish it on-line; You delude yourself if you think that this will stop people stealing it. look at the number of requests for free stuff in this forum alone!|`|17eabce31842e2d00325f347d026051eaa	?|`|tuATxHsVaa	There was a Berne Copyright Convention that essentially decided that you don't need to apply for a copyright on your works. As one of the other posters already mentioned, all you have to do is write a copyright notice on your works and that should be enough. You should always use the special ? copyright sign because "C" is not legally binding. So, do put the notice in your work. <br>  <br>  I understand that each country is a bit different. I looked up copyright law in Egypt. I did discover that the Law Number 82 of 2002 is where you'll find all of the information.<br>  <br>  Here is a link to a PDF of your country's Copyright law (the section about Copyrights starts on page 42):<br>  <br>  <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Egyptian_Intellectual_Property_Law_82_of_2002_(English).pdf" rel="nofollow">http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:E...</a><br>  <br>  I read much of your country's law code. Nobody should be able to use your works without permission; I am no lawyer, but I think the copyright law will be different for each person that downloads/views your music. They will be bound (probably) by the laws of their country.<br>  <br>  Egpyt's law code hinges around the idea of publishing. So, once you have "published" your work on-line (as the Doctor said), then you now have a way to enforce your claim as the author of the work... along with all the rights thereof. <br>  <br>  In many countries, you are good to go. Your creation is your creation, and you don't need a copyright to enforce the fact that it is your intellectual property.<br>  <br>  Why would you, a single person/entity, pay for a copyright? If you yourself discover that someone has stolen your work, then you can sue them whether or not you have payed for the copyright. If you are paying for a copyright, then you are also probably going to be paying for a firm to look for and prosecute those that violate your copyright. Without that firm, your odds of discovering copyright violations are pretty slim. Aren't you too busy composing new music to go after (and search for) those that have stolen your music?<br>  <br>  Are you really that worried that your music is good enough that someone will want to steal it? If you want, you can email me a link to it and I'll tell you if you are wasting your time or not =). Let's not let our egos get ahead of our pocketbooks here... I'm not at all trying to be rude... just realistic. <br>  <br>  The mail systems you are talking about are known as the "Poor Man's Copyright." They rarely hold up in court. You can fake things like this. What you really need are WITNESSES. That's the stuff that holds up in court. Your publisher's insistence that you created the work on a certain date, combined with your mom's assertion that you indeed made it, are a good start. <br>  <br>  I'm afraid that if you want a real, irrefutable copyright, then you're going to have to pay for it. Is that really necessary? Are you really going to waste your time enforcing a copyright, rather than composing? Even with a real copyright you're still going to end up in court. So, what's the difference to you whether you have to prove it or not? Just show your works to your friends so they can back you up!<br>  <br>  I wish you much luck.<br>  <br>  Court Violinist<br>  <br>  *

He left his wife for the Pisces and EVERYONE is still SHOCKED at what he did. Way, and I mean WAY out of character for him.

IsxB0Qi7aa	I really hope not, but most likely it will happen, since it seems like the show likes to play musical partners?<br>  <br>  I think I read a spoiler posted on here that both couples are going to mess around, though I don't know how serious either one is going to be. Most likely with JT & Colleen it will be because like you said Colleen is feeling needy & JT is probably going to comfort her. With Kevin & Amber because they have been getting closer with this Mrs. C thing & Jana's not really believing it, & how he's reliving when he was locked in the closet as a little boy... I think Amber is the one that is going to be there for him & since there are rumors Daniel is leaving the show, most likely Kevin & Amber might turn into something more. I really like Jana though, so I hope not...|`|4kuWOZowaa	I think amber and kevin are suppose to sleep together..but i sorta like them together..they think alike..lol as for collen and jt..prob so since they were together back in the day.|`|EPPb5pRBaa	yeah, i had that feeling.

fDbzt0rlaa	You have very powerful placements in your educational/philosophical and travel areas. I don't think one could call it luck; more of a drive or compulsion. It may feel imperative that you seek meaning in life, and learn about foreign cultures (as you may be prone to feeling negative about them otherwise), however, my advice would be to avoid this unless you know exactly where you are going and what you intend to do..<br>  <br>  You may seek higher education and undertake long journeys, but these may have a transformative and profound effect on you and may involve considerable obstacles that can offer greater achievement than luck, but more danger as well. Whatever you choose to do, you must plan very well and eliminate as many risks as possible.<br>  <br>  You are of a very spiritual/communal disposition, I would say. You may find that your journey or education are to be undertaken on a spiritual level, and that the journey to spiritual enlightenment will not be always easy either. You tend to dream a lot, so committing yourself to things that will outlive dreams is very important. <br>  <br>  You may find your path changing a lot during your life, and may suffer great disillusionment. Be aware too of a potential to abandon people or places in your search for truth or knowledge. You may regret them later in life. <br>  <br>  Short journeys are not so good for you, neither long journeys undertaken for tourism. Whatever you do is more likely to be a pilgrimage. This is ironic, seeing as you may want to head to the west. However, be very very careful about moving on impulse.<br>  <br>  You must be sure that what you aren't looking for is actually the ground you are standing on. Truly. I don't think travel can bring you much happiness, but religious faith, spirituality and above all creativity may be your true destiny.<br>  <br>  You have a lot of luck in the 'art' area of your chart. I think you might be talented at work with children in a school setting, too. You can bring help and support to people in need. You should work with people as you may suffer from a lot of solitude and loneliness in your life. This would not be helped by travel to distant places. <br>  <br>  Of course, I'm assuming you are still in the Sudan because you are young. You could be anywhere, but what I have said will probably apply anywhere. If you were looking for interim work, something in a hospital or institution would probably be good for you. For the long term, any line of work in a medical field may be your career path.<br>  <br>  As for progress; if you don't advance on the material or career level, you will advance spiritually, and possibly to great heights. Humility and perseverance are key words if you are to realise your great potential. You will spend periods of your life drifting a bit, and will feel unfocussed or without energy perhaps, but the message in your planets is clear as day. Don't let yourself fall into disillusionment or despair, and avoid all types of escapism. They are very bad for you.<br>  <br>  <br>  Oh, and you MUSt avoid making choices based on what other people, such as your family, would approve of. You will not find fulfilment in this way. You probably feel great responsibility, but making choices according to your own needs is the right thing to do in the long term. Only by meeting your own needs will you learn how to meet and fulfil other peoples. I am not saying be selfish, but your chart says you will only be successful if you learn to be true to yourself. <br>  <br>  You may have to risk other people's sanctions or disapproval. I hope you do not have  a lot of people counting on you for certain things. You may have to compromise somehow...<br>  <br>  Also, avoid the belief that if you find happiness in love, everything else will work out as a result. Dedicate your time to a greater, humanitarian cause, and the universe will provide all the love you need eventually. <br>  <br>  You must learn to 'go with the flow' and not control every aspect of your dreams, so, contrary to what I said earlier (though long journeys must be planned well), you need to allow certain things in life to develop in their own good time. You are very resilient and solution-oriented.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps: )<br>  <br>  Jooja|`|Nx0kNuO4aa	Planet       Longitude       Rx    Declination  <br>  Sun  11 Capricorn 36     22S56  <br>  Moon  13 Pisces 37     4S24  <br>  Mercury  25 Capricorn 23  Rx  21N34  <br>  Venus  6 Aquarius 07  Rx  20N44  <br>  Mars  10 Sagittarius 33     22S04  <br>  Jupiter  5 Cancer 06  Rx  23S25  <br>  Saturn  15 Capricorn 41     22S20  <br>  Uranus  5 Capricorn 49     23S28  <br>  Neptune  11 Capricorn 60     22S23  <br>  Pluto  17 Scorpio 07     2S22  <br>  Chiron  14 Cancer 50  Rx  29S46  <br>  Node  18 Aquarius 23        <br>  Ascendant  11 Aquarius 43        <br>  Midheaven  21 Scorpio 35        <br>   House System  <br>  Koch  <br>  House       Longitude       <br>  1  11 Aquarius 43  <br>  2  14 Pisces 28  <br>  3  19 Aries 16  <br>  4  21 Taurus 35  <br>  5  17 Gemini 03  <br>  6  13 Cancer 03  <br>  7  11 Leo 43  <br>  8  14 Virgo 28  <br>  9  19 Libra 16  <br>  10  21 Scorpio 35  <br>  11  17 Sagittarius 03  <br>  12  13 Capricorn  <br>   <br>  Aries in the 3rd house is a good place for quickly undersatanding a topic, but may make you quite argumentative, but with Cap sun, merc and Saturn, if you put all the planets together you have the potensity to be a true great.<br>  <br>  Your pisces moon will mean that, you'll have a natural competitiveness but also be able to feel out people as well.
LoKJBLF1aa	The way to learn to read music fast is to do it every day - ya know, work at it. no site willmake you read faster, its up to you.Get one good  book and work through it.|`|AA11625980	That is a good question and I would like to know the answer to that, so when you find out please let me know!!!|`|eda60a6a894beb349ddfd89a4c950beeaa	Forget the net. Try your local music shop and ask about their range of theory workbooks.  These are graded from Beginner (Gr 1) upwards.  It is quite possible to teach yourself music theory, with the right workbooks. (A lot of people do.) They generally discuss and describe the point, then ask you questions.  They don't often include the answers, but all you have to do is check up on the text you have just read.  If you work consistently you could have really excellent, high level music reading skills in a year.  That is around Grade 3. After that the courses get into harmony, history and general knowledge. Most people don't need to go that far.<br>  <br>  As you learn new things, look for them in the music you are playing/singing at the time. That way it will make a lot more sense, as you can see what it is saying.  A sheet of music is basically a set of instructions that tell you how to turn the page into musical sound.  Not much point in learning the instructions if you can't make them work for you!<br>  <br>  Sorry, there is no easy way to do it.  You might even get fascinated with the stuff and be studying for years.  In some places, you can do exams up to Diploma Level.  You would have to check out what music examining body there was in your country.  England, Australia and NZ have one.  Other countries often use one of these systems.
hexzaIGgaa	Uh, hentai is available just about anywhere. Have you never heard of torrents?<br>  <br>  Anyway, porn is porn...and it is everywhere.<br>  <br>  BTW, what exactly is "censored porn?" LMAO<br>  <br>  Some hentai is actually very good...and some, like "Bible Black" is absolute disgusting, hateful, trash.<br>  <br>  And, just what is the line between "Ecchi" and "Hentai?" I mean, "Ecchi" (the word) is derived from the first letter of "Hentai."<br>  <br>  Is Mahoromatic porn? Yes indeedy, soft core porn. Is Misato laying a big wet one on Shinji (14 years old) porn? Is Skuld (adultified) fantasizing after Keiichi (last episode, season one) porn? Onegai Teacher...Kei and Mizuho? "Standstill" was a device used to further the plot and to take the "curse" off of Mizuho doing the deed with Kei (who was ostensibly 15!). Is the constant lechery of Mr. Kimura in Azumanga Daioh porn? The obsession with Sakaki-san's breasts?<br>  <br>  EDIT: I bet Urd-sama would love to get some pictures of Keiichi and Belldandy doing the deed (wouldn't we all?).<br>  <br>  EDIT FOR ARO X: OH PLEASE SPARE ME!

car4UyLFaa	There is, and there isn't. It really depends on the mood and content of the song, the genre, and how experimental the writer wants to be. For example, the usual radio song is not at all experimental and has a repeated chorus and similar verse structures, sometimes a bridge or breakdown. More experimental songs might be all breakdown, or all verses if it's a story-telling song, or a more experimental-ish song might have similarly structured verses with choruses that are the same in the music, but different in the lyrics.<br>  <br>  The artists I appreciate most seemingly pay little or no attention to format, and only to feeling, because that's what art is after all - feeling, not format.|`|SxqYguUCaa	not all all. If there was a format, then nothing would be original.<br>  <br>  Artists find there own format for writing songs usually.<br>  <br>  Like Michelle Branch said she uses :<br>  <br>  verse/chorus/verse/double chorus/bridge/chorus<br>  <br>  But if you want to make your songs unique, try and use different formats.|`|Ht7F5vATaa	generally it rhymes, goes verse, (maybe bridge) chorus, verse ,chorus verse ,chorus.

Xa7TaXDRaa	major and minor are the most basic scales there are and all of western music originated from those only.  in fact modes and pentatonic scales were nonexistent in the european world for hundreds of years.  heres a basic G major scale to start with:<br>  <br>  G A B C D E F# G<br>  or<br>  <br>  -----------------------------------2-3...<br>  ------------------------------3-5-----...<br>  ----------------------2-4-5-----------...<br>  --------------2-4-5-------------------...<br>  ------2-3-5---------------------------...<br>  -3-5----------------------------------...<br>  <br>  as for minor scales:<br>  G major has the same notes as the minor scale starting on the 6th note from G (or 1 1/2 steps down from G), so G's relative minor would be the E minor scale (E F# G A B C D E)<br>  <br>  ALSO before learning all the fingerings, learn the actual importan stuff.

AbRfd29Haa	Singing is great for you. I'm... much older, and I sing for an hour or two a day, along with my guitar playing, and it's certainly one of the better things I do for myself. <br>  <br>  If you're having problems... it is possible to strain your voice if you're not singing correctly. If you're getting any vocal coaching, they'll help you with this. If not, you want to learn to sing from you diaphram, not in your "head" voice, which can be bad on the throat. <br>  <br>  Here are some places to read about tips for singers:<br>  <a href="http://a2z-singing-tips.com/" rel="nofollow">http://a2z-singing-tips.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://singingtipsblog.com/" rel="nofollow">http://singingtipsblog.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.your-personal-singing-guide.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.your-personal-singing-guide.c...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.vocalist.org.uk/voicetraining.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.vocalist.org.uk/voicetraining...</a>|`|akcGfgdcaa	It lowers heart disease.....|`|hSUMs5LAaa	As long as you don't over stress your voice, it's just fine and an hour of singing evereyday is just right.  Also, singing is some sort of therapy and it's good way to release stress to relax your body and soul.  So just go on and sing!!! Just don't abuse your voice though...|`|yYAabiSLaa	As long as you are singing healthily and not attempting technique that will strain you, there is absolutely nothing wrong with practicing an hour a day.  Practicing an hour or two a day is  great.  I've always seen it as a sign of dedication :)|`|xd5uXUDHaa	Sure<br>  <br>  Im sure it would have many benefits to your health
rNqF4gIVaa	They are not comparable. Their music is very different. Which is best is subjective and there is no criteria by which to make such a judgement.<br>  <br>  Both are quite brilliant.|`|f8580fb10a70074a6148e666b97f9cdaaa	The answer could take huge statistics and analysis, however I'll try to simplify the greatest achievements.<br>  <br>  Mozart has developed the classical period music, going up with it to the fullest, with his incomparable melodies, harmonies, and overall music structure, leaving a huge number of amazing compositions.<br>  <br>  Beethoven's 1st period music was integral to Mozart's and Haydn's music, however he then have made the most huge music revolution in the history, breaking the normal classical composition rules, giving the most priority to express his own emotions, creating by this the new romantic music, opening by his own this approach for all the followed great romantic composers.<br>  So Beethoven was the father of the romantic music, and I believe without Beethoven, there wouldn't have been Chopin, Schumann, Brahms, and many other great romantic composers.<br>  So my final result is : Beethoven.|`|vsy4QMHMaa	I think the best Mozart was Wolfgang and the best Beethoven was Ludwig.|`|AA10248966	You can compare very early Beethoven's few known compositions prior to 1791 to Mozart's ( the year of the death of Mozart), and Mozart would outshine him. That is because it is sort of like comparing apples to oranges.<br>  <br>  Beethoven, 15 years younger than Mozart, was a fabulous innovator who took the classical era traits of composition which Mozart certainly was the best and furthered them by transitioning into the romantic era of composition. <br>  <br>  That being said, Mozart's melodic lines were some of the greatest ever, bar none. Had Mozart lived past his 35th birthday, I am sure we would not be talking Beethoven, but Mozart today as one of the three greatest ever. To me, he still was one of the three greatest: Bach, Mozart and Beethoven. Brahms to me was NOT one of the three greatest.|`|CrAwmz65aa	Here is what I think of Mozart:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Avo4.MN07eQBVouwqTA7Vtzty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090219194925AAU93Zv&show=7#profile-info-YQM3evnsaa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  and here is what I think of Beethoven:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ArwOSrA2c5p60QMte7Dwz6zty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090218160612AAnAvM0&show=7#profile-info-0eSKw62Yaa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|obGQ2Bqfaa	Mozart was  an Opera composer, Beethoven wasn't; can you compare meat with fish?|`|MXjvZMUXaa	Mozart IMO|`|Wi0LBsVbaa	As usual i jones is right. the point is to judge a composer, you need to evaluate what his works achieve, in the light of what he was trying to express. Beethoven was trying to express different things than Mozart.<br>  Music is not a competitive sport, it is like being yourself, who is best at that? Music is not a realm of absolutes, it always involves the relationship you have with the composer, which depends on you. So it will always be a matter of who you have the best relationship with at the time. For you only you can answer this.<br>  (As far as mastery of technical equipment, they were equals).|`|HUee9mo1aa	It's all up to personal taste. I actually love Bach, but if I had to choose between the two, I'd go for Mozart.<br>  <br>  They both do some things better than the others, and their music differs in lots of ways. They're both very good, and it's up to you which you think is better.|`|kbFty6eVaa	Beethoven. His late string quartets alone obliterate everything written before 1850.|`|HQKuzxulaa	Beethoven is easier to listen to. In my view anyway.|`|9PK7mITnaa	Scriabin.

wlaxCA3Iaa	I am entertained by both Harry Potter and Twilight. However I feel Harry Potter has a better story line and plot than Twilight. Harry Potter is a timeless classic that almost everyone can relate to and enjoy. Twilight on the other hand is not, it is a fantasy romance novel directed towards teenage girls and will not stand the test of time.|`|21Lnhdfeaa	Harry Potter.  It's the only of these two stories that really deserves to be in print.  It has that special something, like, I don't know, a PLOT, a good story, no gay sparkly vampires, you know, all those things that make a book good.  Harry Potter has them.  Twilight wishes, hopes and prays every night that it might one day grow up to be a real story.|`|aPGPbbz7aa	movie or the book?<br>  well for movies you can not compare them . <br>  TWILIGHT the book would have to overtake harry potter, ive been so absorbed by a book before , i feel like twilight is a part of me now. like i have a secret edward out there with a little jacob hanging on the side and how in every relationship there is a "secret" that only you two can know or you'll never know. O__O TWILIGHT BREATH TAKING ! harry potter .. its a classic but sorry , twilight has possessed us all.|`|FHlA35BLaa	I kinda have the same problem.I think HP has really got the story,I mean it's not just about one or two persons and it has got so much characters that is interesting in their own ways.HP has more action a better story and many people that didn't actually like to read have learned to read with Harry Potters help.HP has also a wider audience.But we all got to admit twilight has got WAY better romance but it's also more for teenage girls and it is not so elaborately written but I got to admit I'm reading it 10 times a day and just can't put it down.I would still say Harry Potter cause the story is so much more meaningfull and just perfectly written...don't get me wrong cause I love both HP and Twilight|`|76140b1733cd124dbe960a504bc06f8daa	Well, dude, it all boils down to Personal Preference.<br>  <br>  What do you like more: vampires or wizards?  C'mon, fess up!<br>  <br>  Potter has sold over $400 million in books around the world.  Has Twilight?  Potter has been translated into 67 languages.  Has Twilight? The Potter series is considered a modern classic that will withstand the test of time; it has won numerous awards around the world for literary quality & originallity. Has Twilight? The last 3 Potter books were the fasting selling novels in publishing history.  Has Twilight? <br>  The Potter movie series has generated several BILLION dollars with it's films.  Has Twilight?<br>  <br>  Lots of questions, there . . .|`|JDogbPg6aa	All the obsessed fans ruined Twilight and degraded it to nothing, because their only interest in the book is Edward. (Stores like Hot Topic who promote it way too much, dumb fans) <br>  <br>  I thought Twilight was an alright book series, but Harry Potter is great as well.|`|WQcxODKLaa	Harry Potter .<br>  it has all the elements you could ask for, REAL action, great character development, and a little romance here and there :)<br>  <br>  Twilight's ok, but harry potter was here first ! :D|`|7U8OggiKaa	How can you say Twilight is better than Harry Potter in the books if you said you haven't even read the Harry Potter Books? I myself Prefer Harry Potter because it has suspense,action,mystery,romance and a great story plot.Twilight has a hollow plot while she just wrote her plot to whatever her fans preferred.J.K. Rowling defied her fans and ended it whatever she thought would be the best.<br>  <br>  Harry Potter beats Twilight any day.|`|Xsk5eWfQaa	This question has been asked a zillion times, and I think that fans shouldn't be comparing the twilight saga to harry potter, mainly because they are totally different series, but here I go...<br>  Although I'm glad Twilight has gotten most of the 12 - 14 year old girls i know to read, Harry Potter encouraged a whole generation to read (i first read them for myself when i was five) and provided an excellent series for older people as well, both male and female; not just teen aged girls and their mothers.<br>  I liked the first book in the twilight saga, and used to like the other books, but then after the initial obsession with them goes, you realise that after the first book (that wasn't even that well written), stephenie meyer is just milking the idea, and making it up as she goes. <br>  JK Rowling had the whole wizarding world planned out, the whole list of characters she would use, locations and the plot line for the whole series before she started writing. The characters in Harry Potter actually develop throughout the series! Bella and Edward are just suddenly "in love" with each other, then, he leaves her! omg! She cannot live without him!<br>  'Twilighters': How is twilight more believable then harry potter? it's either vampires, or witches and wizards! And when you're talking about the characters, the most in depth character is Edward, and that's only because he's so obviously an abusive boyfriend.<br>  As for the movies, Twilight was so horrible, my sister and i sat there laughing for the whole thing. The acting was terrible, and the movie was more Comedy/Art-house than Teen Romance. <br>   People who say "Twilight is better, and even though i haven't read the Harry Potter books, Harry Potter sucks!" shouldn't be answering these questions!<br>  I could keep being really cynical but I won't bore you more.<br>  Even though I've just gone and been really hypocritical and compared the two series, Harry Potter is better by far.|`|DKg7LAPnaa	HARRY. BLOODY. POTTER.<br>  <br>  Hands down. No questions asked.<br>  <br>  Stephenie Meyer has HORRIBLE writing. Her characters are underdeveloped, everyone is too perfect, and there is no story line past the first book. <br>  <br>  Twilight may have a nice romance setting, but Harry Potter has all of the above. Adventure throughout, very strong characters that you can relate to, romance that builds gradually and never so much it takes over the story line, and very witty humor. <br>  <br>  Vampires made of disco balls? SERIOUSLY?!?!?! Stephenie Meyer...I'm sorry, but get off the shelves.|`|5JEsJnWuaa	I never read harry potter but I watched the movie, it was okay. I read twilight it was great (dont say overated cause its made for TEENS). I watched twilight, its wasnt that much like the book. I say twilight beats harry potter in books while harry potter beats twilight in movies.|`|RPZfX5NXaa	twilight appeals more to teens since its more of a love story than HP is. But i really prefer HP because HP books and movies have more to them than the twilight saga. The HP stories are longer and more interesting. <br>  <br>  Also, HP appeals to a bigger audience than twilight.|`|Yb0vZXAiaa	i like harry potter. it is more based on the wizard and witch thing whereas twilight is so dumb its not really based on what vampires really are. eg when a vampire is in the sun, what should it do? disintegrate (die) where in twilight they sparkle. like wtf man. but they are both still good|`|c78b02eb1a997ddefb20d7db451dad32aa	Twilight, it's got way better romance and action & does not have stupid witchcraft in it.|`|4bkKCX4Paa	I thik HP is alot better just because i like the wizard concept more<br>  <br>  and twilight is retarded and some parts<br>  like what Bellske wtf since when do vampires sparkle?|`|GpVnQ1Lsaa	harry potter because S.M. isnt that great at writing she tells good stories but she can't WRITE that good and J.K.R. is a very good writer

7gH7sgi6aa	None.  It may seem like a cold answer but there is a purpose for everything that happens in life and "messing" with the "purpose" is disrupting nature.  God has a plan for each of us and we have no right to question it.  We are all here for a time and a reason.  When our time is up it is up.  We move on (hopefully) to bigger and better things.<br>  Peace & Love  :)|`|bPnmavjZaa	Tough question to answer cause I would want to bring em all back. I would say BIG cause I am an East Coast head who lived on his material. And BIG finally seemed happy in the "Hypnotize" video. But I would say Big L. The world never saw what this lyrical phenom could do. He was kinda mixed up with the streets cause he wasn't movin units cause he was more underground. But Big L went way too early|`|phZR63Rdaa	I would say Tupac, But i think he is still alive....|`|m2UUrurBaa	besides the obvious choices, i gotta go with ol' dirt dog, ODB because he possessed a carefree attitude in his music that you don't find anywhere else.<br>  <br>  just watch videos like brooklyn zoo, and shimmey shimmey ya,|`|Yf3oWfCnaa	@wise man - LMAO that was funny..<br>  (didn't know he was dead? lol)<br>  <br>  <br>  Big Pun|`|MkF92GNgaa	phuk 2pac|`|e41809d06ca21ebf8b0bf28ab33da9c8aa	How about a rapper/producer...<br>  <br>  J Dilla|`|br7KBq8Taa	Old Dirty Bastard.|`|mLSnAdZOaa	Tupac, I'd like to see what he'd say about these new rappers and what influence it would have on mainstream Hip-Hop today. Everyone will probably say Tupac because he's portrayed as "The Greatest". That same opinion about him is what I think can change mainstream RHH. Like if he called out all these new rappers that idolize him.|`|atV28deKaa	Pimp C.

Does he know what to say? If you guys go out again, say, ok, you'll go out but on one condition. Either you & I are going on a date or you & your phone are going out. Don't be snotty about it-He might not even know he's doing it & that it bothers you. Maybe he does it around everyone & no one says anything. Consider the people he hangs with. There's a lot of nice people out there who do rude things because that's what they're around. That's how they're raised. Too soon to tell. Give it some time. Good luck.|`|Dv6KSxmlaa	Not trying to play down your horoscope beliefs here, but maybe that's not the best system of figuring people out? I mean...I'm a libra, and seriously? I'm everything that the horocopes say a libra is not. Just listen to the pisces guy above? He mentioned he isn't unattentive and rude on dates. You can't judge people by their horoscope. <br>  <br>  My advice? Just feel a person out...get to know them as a person, not a sign.<br>  <br>  Edit: My bad, I said guy but Tina definitely sounds like a chick's name. Listen to HER then.|`|1915c9b51bf4f4a90fd8cea8d52841eeaa	Hmmm...I don't like Pisces at all. Never met on that I like :-)|`|to6JW3yFaa	No I dont think so. Im a Pisces and I always try to be very attentive during dates, and leave my phone behind so Im not rude. However maybe he was trying to play a game with u and show u that he's hard to get or something. Or like the other person said, maybe it was work related. I dont know, but he sounds like a jerk...|`|9KklyOcbaa	I've known a lot of Pisces. I've never had that happen and I've dated three. One Pisces said I was rude for being on my phone for just a second because my friend called me. I definitely don't think that all Pisces are like that. He's just a jerk.

I do about 65 wpm and I don't look at the keyboard.  I used to be an admin for 10yrs, I think the more you do it, and do it correctly, the easier it gets.  <br>  <br>  I can usually type and carry on a conversation at the same time without making a typo.  Used to drive my friend crazy that I could do both at the same time.|`|m05HJc1Paa	I don't look at the keyboard when I type.  I took keyboarding (typing) while in high school.

Is there a better self description of this album then that?? Also they have a track on the album called "Datskat" which is basically Black Thought imitating a sort of Jazz/Skat style of singing and applied rap to it.

I mean, they've been out of the popular light for so long you got kids today thinking they're an "underground" group.<br>  <br>  A lot of kids, the predominant buyers of music, don't want any truth or substance to their music.

is132TSYaa	The principle of free will has religious, ethical, and scientific implications. For example, <br>  <br>  in the religious realm, free will may imply that an divinity (god) does not assert its power over individual will and choices. In ethics, it may imply that individuals can be held morally accountable for their actions. <br>  <br>  In the scientific realm, it may imply that the actions of the body, including the brain and the mind, are not wholly determined by physical causality. <br>  <br>  Society generally holds people responsible for their actions, and will say that they deserve praise or blame for what they do. However, many believe that moral responsibility requires free will. <br>  Thus, another important issue in the debate on free will is whether individuals are ever morally responsible for their actions—and, if so, in what sense?<br>  <br>  In other words, the idea Free will is left completely up to the individuals analysis and self adherence, not to societies over-generalised and somewhat overused idea of individuality.<br>  <br>  Hope you arent asleeeeeeeeeep..... zzzzzzzzzz lol|`|pbyw2EYZaa	We have a choice as to how we handle each and every situation.

They just take my money and put it where they want.<br>  <br>  When government says their at war and you must fight then you just have to do it even if you  dont agree with it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Free will can only exist when people are equal.|`|9BY9S3lraa	it doesn't<br>  <br>  if we all had free will most of us would't choose to go to school or work or go to boring family reunions, etc..., etc.. we're controlled by f-ing society and money and the goverment  oh and the laws of nature, and more etc.. , etc...|`|YhuH2k4Caa	it is based on decisions. for example, if i decide to pluck you just because i feel like it, that is free will. i make the twisted decisions!!<br>  <br>  BWAHAHAHA|`|c2b0c54ac5bc43be413eb1675d56c4ffaa	What is up with everyone getting philisophical at 4 a.m??!?!

XkmqZ07Daa	I started at 298lbs when I started to lose weight.I'm now 223.2lbs.Hoping to get to 150lbs.I'm 5'7".I don't do much heavy weight lifting.I lift 5-8lb barbells which has tightened my arms dramtically.I also do 1 1/2 hour of cardio, normally 1 hour on elliptical and 30 minute walk at 3.7mph at a 5 incline.I also eat 6 small low cal meals a day to keep my metabolism moving.Losing weight and maintaining a healthy life is possible.It probably will be hard at first, as change isn't always easy, but this routine has become apart of my daily life which isn't hard at all.Also, if you have a bad day or gain weight one week, don't give up.That's just crazy to give up on something you've been working hard on.Everyone has slip-ups.I know this didn't answer your question, but anways.|`|coZ7Fm79aa	i was 5ft 5 100lbs <br>  <br>  barbell bench 60x8<br>  Deadlift 100x8<br>  Barbell Rows 50x6<br>  Overhead Press 30x8<br>  <br>  now 5ft 5 137lbs still bulking<br>  barbell bench 125x6<br>  Deadlift  160x8<br>  Barbell Rows 135x6-7<br>  Overhead Press 82x4<br>  <br>  my lifts arent great or anything im still weak but i working on it.|`|f82ogPAwaa	5'7 around 145-150<br>  barbell bench 125*8<br>  deadlift-150* 8<br>  backsquat-135*8<br>  5'11 180<br>  barbell bench 155*8<br>  deadlift 305*5<br>  backsquat 225*8|`|PZ9OSv9naa	i weighed 170<br>  bench - max 85<br>  incline - probly really really low<br>  dumbell row - 40x10<br>  deadlift - 135x10<br>  front squat - never did it till i had been lifting awhile<br>  back squat - 135x10<br>  <br>  i was so weak

At guitar center they are having a green tag sale which means these guitars are on sale. The B.C rich is $699 which is Pretty good because it comes with really good EMG pick ups, it has 24 frets and it also has a floyd rose. The dean shadow is $549.99 and it too comes with a floyd rose but the only difference is that this guitar has 22 frets but it's still a really cool guitar. I Have a dean and the sound quality is awesome so i would recommend both guitars.<br>  <br>  Check out guitar centers web site and these tow guitars should pop up when you click "Guitars".|`|3UeOiZVoaa	Get A V guitar if you can. A fender strat is really nice too. The best brands are Ibanez, Fender, Gibson, and B.C. Rich.    It really doesnt matter what kind of guitar you get for certain music. It will all be the same buy something around $200 so you can get a nice amp and effects pedals.

fQkihSHZaa	This is England is a great film!|`|AA10636233	The Red Violin. The music is stunning, and so is the story! When my husband rented it from blockbuster, I was ticked off. He has a tendency to pick out horrible movies that are subtitled (as if they weren't lame enough without the reading)! When this one started, I almost left the room, but the baby was liking the music, so I stayed. After the first few minutes, I was hooked! You will be awed by the surprises that you never see coming! Oh btw, the whole movie is not subtitled, just when they are in the foreign countries mostly france! You will see some extremely beautiful scenery, and you will want the soundtrack, trust me!|`|7dd92fa9e1fedaa65abe9b3824b3fba3aa	"11:14" was a random movie I rented once and turned out to be actually a really great movie.

It's a few years old, but I remember when it came out it was on all the critics' top ten lists for that year.  And I wondered why, because it was in the horror genre and they rarely give horror movies the time of day.  So I watched it and it's amazing, it's not gore-filled, but the story is suspenseful with a great unexpected plot twist at the end.

34477748b33e4e0e3277b953c722882daa	Nokia Theatre at Grand Prairie is probably your best option.<br>  If it is a really popular artist, maybe American Airlines. Don't know that Bon Jovi or Def Leppard would draw a big enough crowd though.<br>  There is a slim chance that Bon Jovi could play at Billy Bob's Texas in Fort Worth.  It is more of a country place though.  But Bon Jovi is a little cross-genre.<br>  Try looking around on Ticketmaster (<a href="http://www.ticketmaster.com/)." rel="nofollow">http://www.ticketmaster.com/).</a>  They have good info about venues.

Most of the time, I take a guess by what type of language they are speaking. Is it proper English & spelling, or is it, "Puter Talk" as I like to call it. (I'm sure there is a proper term for it)<br>  <br>  And quite often the category comes into play as well. LIKE...HELP!!!! I need help w/ my homework, IS probably a teenager. But...HELP!!!!

(& that's a secret, shhhh).<br>  <br>  I do of course pay attention to the nickname they have given themselves. That might be what REALLY tells me about the person more then anything else.

So naturally im freaking the fug out. Random people starting crowding around so i yell at the dumbfucks to call an ambulance cause i don't have my phone on me. One woman calls 911 and she tells the response team that "we've got a young girl, hit by a car, looks to be about 7-years old."  That's nice of her and all but the thing is, Ben is 12-years-old and a BOY. I start CRACKING up right there next to this moaning, injured child laying on the street. Luckily the crowd just though i was crying. I'd like to say that woman's mistake was due to her poor eyesight, i'd like to say that....|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	In 5th graqde this girl was to afraid toi ask to go the the bathroom and she peed herself|`|IqoRBVUTaa	We were reading up on current events, and my friend brought in this one event.

And I tired so bad not to laugh when our teacher read it, but dude, while everyone sat there "Awww-ing" me and him were cracking up. I'm still trippin' over it! I mean, she's gonna die soon, right? ^.^|`|L2pkns9maa	Made my little brother watch the little vid where you stare into the screen and a scary face comes up and screams, yea he jumped and peed himself and cried non stop.

I had the top down and we were leaving my HS parking lot and my gf saw someone she knew. She was in the back and we were only going like...10 mph or so. She decides to get up and just hop out of the moving car. I know smart right? Well, anyway, I turn around and see this and I hit the brakes. Not to hurt her, but it was a reflex She falls, smacks her head on the windshield and totally eats it on the cement in front of her friends. At first I was like, "WTF! I'm so sorry!" Then she got up with nothing more than a scraped knee. I knew she felt bad, but I laughed my a$$ off for about ten minutes after that. haha! DUMB BLONDE! lol!|`|4e2gb3BQaa	so about a week ago i woke up at almost 4 in the morning and my mom is screaming at my 5 year old bro cuz he got sick and was vomiting in the toilet, and then my mom went away and he wanted her to like sit there with him while he puked so he went to go find her and threw up in her bed and his bed, and my mom was like, YOU WERE JUST AT THE TOILET AND THEN YOU MOVED AND NOW I HAVE TO CLEAN UP ALL THIS PUKE! i found that really funny for some reason, but when i tried to tell my friends about it they are like uhhh...|`|vENQ2NJjaa	These work safety ads we have in Australia that show only after like 10pm<br>  where this teenage girl who works at a bakery gets her fingers sliced off from the slicing machine<br>  ahaha|`|lPUHGAcLaa	I literally saw someone pee theyre pants and I followed them around and sang Johnny poo poo pants from Group X, She cried her entire way out of school.

xqQ5C7wmaa	Yes. According to Einstein's theory of relativity, the closer you get the speed of light, the slower you appear to be going. If you could chase a light beam and almost catch it, then everything else around you would appear to stop. There have even been experiments done on this subject where a clock was taken in a jet and went really fast then compared to an identical clock that stayed stationary and the one that didn't travel was ahead of the other one.|`|9BY9S3lraa	yeah I knew that <br>  <br>  that's a way to travel to the future, but for it to work you would have to be traveling at or near the speed of light.|`|QH02h9REaa	yep.

PuWgdXSYaa	Yes,and no.<br>  Depends what kind of government you are talking about. Like the Area 51 type government is something one of my friends is really afraid of. I myself am afraid that they are watching me like 24/7 cause of all this creep technology. Though, if it came down to it, i'd probably trust my government over a crime group.|`|Nc637a6laa	You are so right, I am beginning to think that very same thing about not being able to tell the difference between the two.  There is so much corruption in the Government it might as well be called organized crime.  Our border patrol in Texas has been begging for help and our government refuses to help them and when they try to protect the borders what does the so called justice system do to them?  Well, they Glorify the Bandits and Jail our Protectors or Fine them.  I have been reading and watching this on the news so much lately and it sickens me. I just know that I am so glad that next year is election year!|`|08f3cbe27589e91a2bfcf2bee68902efaa	It depends, of course organized crime is bad, but some of it would never have occurred had the government behaved differently.<br>  <br>  Simple example would be banning of alcohol during the Prohibition Era. To prevent businesses legitimately selling alcohol meant that an underground industry of moonshine/alcohol production went through, thus increasing organized crime in that area.<br>  <br>  Personally I'm a nobody so organized crime wouldn't affect me. However I'm concerned about the government's actions as they make far more decisions that'll affect my quality of life.|`|edf69dba4545622a1a4076166f136f8baa	Is there a difference between the two?|`|55ac50ec591a2bbc757c20a9ce8c4322aa	im going to be the future president one day and im going to do both weeeeee|`|tmOuRXQ6aa	a clevelend steamer is when you take a dump on a lovers chest while or before titty ******* (if that partner is a female.)If you squish it down and then you spooge on it for syrup it becomes a "Boston Pancake".|`|F32uPjAraa	A true anarchist believes that his most dangerous enemy is his own government, and come the revolution.

Then we met.<br>  <br>  I'll tell ya, my wife and I, we don't think alike. She donates money to the homeless, and I donate money to the topless!<br>  <br>  One night I came home.  I figured, let my wife come on.  I'll play it cool.  Let her make the first move.  She went to Florida. <br>  <br>  I asked my old man if I could go ice-skating on the lake.  He told me, "Wait til it gets warmer."<br>  <br>  My doctor told me to watch my drinking.  Now I drink in front of a mirror.  I drink too much.  Way too much.  My doctor drew blood.  He ran a tab.<br>  <br>  When I was born the doctor came out to the waiting room and said to my father, "I'm very sorry. We did everything we could...but he pulled through."<br>  <br>  I come from a stupid family. During the Civil War my great uncle fought for the west!<br>  <br>  My father was stupid.  He worked in a bank and they caught him stealing pens.<br>  <br>  My mother had morning sickness after I was born.<br>  <br>  My mother never breast fed me. She told me that she only liked me as a friend.<br>  <br>  My father carries around the picture of the kid who came with his wallet.<br>  <br>  When I played in the sandbox the cat kept covering me up.<br>  <br>  I could tell that my parents hated me. My bath toys were a toaster and a radio.<br>  <br>  One year they wanted to make me poster boy... for birth control.<br>  <br>  I remember the time I was kidnapped and they sent back a piece of my finger to my father.  He said he wanted more proof.<br>  <br>  giggle here are a few more for you :) hope it made you giggle like it did me <br>  <br>  <br>  angel|`|vibMky05aa	Wow! This guy is a pure genius!

UX2dqQQVaa	Overrated underground MC....he is nice BUT not as nice as people make him out to be.  Sure they say "Dance With The Devil" is an example of how amazing he is, when most of his stuff don't sound like that.  <br>  <br>  I don't like him, but some people do...listen to some of his stuff for yourself and see what you think|`|1lvyUwo7aa	I think he is good, but he isn't in my top 25. a lot of people on RHH love him, but i just think hes good, nothin special.|`|3drMJB1maa	I don't really like him.|`|t395RWhGaa	To use an extremely bad metaphor, Immortal Technique is sort of like the gateway drug to real Hip Hop... I used to love his work (along with Jedi Mind Tricks, they both got me into Hip-Hop) and while I now listen to a much broader selection of Hip-Hop, I still enjoy listening to some of his songs.|`|gb8JpBLtaa	I don't know how anyone on here can say he is not an incredible MC.  Just because you think someone is overrated, doesn't mean they're not good.  If you consider him overrated, you need to think about why he is considered to be so great by so many hip-hop fans.  He's got the strongest delivery I've ever heard, forces you to listen.  Top 5 MC ever no question.|`|ALqrgLE2aa	Immortal Technique is in my top ten all time fav rappers.<br>  I do asmit he is a bit overated but give the man a break, he has really put made his point in regards to politics and dance witht the devil,no comment|`|e1jG5fhLaa	hes good but not great XD<br>  I can name at least 10 rappers i like better|`|FJHpUMwtaa	He is absolutely cic, he is raw & uncut underground MC, his songs do everything from tell a story, to challenge the listeners mind, to teach & to distinguish multiple cultures. He certainly is an acquired taste, either you like him or not, his DJ helps weigh in to deserve props DJ GI JOE~ last time i saw Tech perform was in the DC area & he said, 'there must be FBI & police in the crowd, so F*&^ you, & there is people in the crowd who your father is a cop, so F$^@ him, & F@^# you & F#^ your whole family' ~now~ i know your hardcore or whateva but when you start spittin bout F(*& my family~ thats it son, thats love loss|`|FAaePWPWaa	I'm not a huge fan of Immortal Technique. But people on Yahoo love him. I dontthink he's that special though. He's definately not up there in the top 10 or 25. People make him out to be the sickest MC ever but when you actually listen to his music he's not special. His flow isn't special. His delivery isn't good. Nothing stands out about Immortal Technique except his name.|`|MJx8TKhtaa	I don't really listen to him, but everytime  someone has to say "listen to real rap like Immortal Technique" cuz they get mad when someone else listens to Soulja Boy and lil wayne.. But i dont know i think he could be overrated..

S7cRXUb7aa	i believe it was "Van Halen"|`|AA12109156	Van Halen|`|6ea27722cbf179035ef19096b0b1936caa	It was eponymously titled, and I think released by Warner Brothers. It turned out to be one of the best guitar albums ever made, thanks to Eddie's two-handed tapping and unique sound. I think some of their best work came from that album and never got any recognition--Atomic Punk, On Fire, Little Dreamer, I'm the One, etc., etc. Did you know Gene Simmons financed their first demo?|`|x1Ckyhhaaa	Yeah, it was just titled "Van Halen"
miCJLOHYaa	*shrug* Time is relative. <br>  <br>  I'm a bit indifferent towards it. Depends on my mood. Which is currently apathetic in this situation. <br>  When it comes to applying it? I think it's reasonable to snatch an opportunity if it's rather uncommon, but I don't see partying every night that entertaining. Like you said, it becomes an excuse. Still, if I get that Golden Ticket, I'm goin' to that factory >.> And I will glomp Wonka. Damn skippy I will.<br>  <br>  Kinda like that "shoot for the moon one"... My teacher said that in class and I responded with "the higher you aim, the further you fall"...

JWjq5iaXaa	This is going to be fun.<br>  <br>  <br>  _________________________________<br>  _________________________________<br>  _________________________________<br>  Running can be the ultimate option, depending on the situation. If it were a minor outbreak, and correctly quarantined, all you'd need to do is get a few miles away, and you're safe. You never needed to touch a weapon or even get near a zombie, right?<br>  <br>  Sadly, that most likely wouldn't be the case. A zombie outbreak would be hard to tame, unless it were on an island or a town with only one way out accessible to a creature who doesn't have the motor skills to climb or swim.<br>  <br>  <br>  _________________________________<br>  _________________________________<br>  _________________________________<br>  Literally, Hand-to-hand combat would be the worst option. The zombie won't punch, or strike you. He'll bite. And one bite could mean either a nice lunch for our hungry little friend, or a certain you becoming a zombie... a fate worse than death, in my opinion.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Melee combat is important. Depending on what object you use and how you use it, it could be the difference between life and death. However, even the greatest of swordsmen would fall to the zombies if relying on a blunt object not of choice. If the strongest man on earth was using only a role of wrapping paper when face to face with 20 zombies, he couldn't win... and the zombies would feast on his delicious muscles.<br>  <br>  If I could simply sort melee weapons into categories, I'd sort them into BLADE, STAB, BLUNT, HEAVY, OTHER. I know, there are other categories, this is the best I could think of if a zombie were banging on my door. Which would be the best? It depends really how you use it.<br>  <br>  First encounter with a zombie, anything is better than nothing. You don't know how he'll move, you don't know how he'll die. Just pick up the most swing-able, heavy thing you can find, and aim for the legs. Once he's on the ground, break the head to keep him from biting.<br>  <br>  Thing is, a realistic zombie would die as easily as a human... vital organs are still vital. They'd just be less prone to the pain that would keep a human from fighting back after a hard hit. So if he's on the ground, he'll still fight back. He won't think to get back up, and he'll do whatever he can to get you from the ground. Even if he did try to get up, he might not be able to, depending on how hard you hit him.<br>  <br>  Then, once you've got a safe moment, find something useful. A nice, swing-able blunt object will work nicely, if you were successful with your first zombie. A two-by-four, a baseball bat, something like that. Using the categories (BLADE, STAB, BLUNT, HEAVY, OTHER) Think of what you can use.<br>  <br>  <br>  Any blade will be nice, but hard to find. A nice slice-and-dice could take down a zombie as easily as a giant, walking piece of cheese. mmm... now that's a pandemic I could handle. Look for something sharp, similar to a sword.<br>  <br>  Stabbing weapons are difficult... If you stabbed a zombie in the heart, he'll react like a human, but without pain. He'll probably gasp a bit (while still clawing at you), and eventually fall to the ground. If a stabbing weapon is long enough (longer than a pocket knife), it should take down a zombie fairly easily. Good luck finding something like that, though. Simplest I could think of is some kind of long scissors...<br>  <br>  Blunt weapons are everywhere... already mentioned this. Something swing-able and heavy will work, try a metal bat or piece of wood. A sledgehammer would work very nicely, unless you were up against more than one zombie. Which you will be. No sledgehammer.<br>  <br>  Heavy weapons are mostly for emergencies. Something really heavy that will take both hands, useful if you're in a tight spot or completely surrounded by zombies. Drop your weapon, pick up a chair or TV or whatever you can find, and swing for your life.<br>  <br>  Other describes everything else. What could that be? A can of axe and a lighter, gardening equipment, whatever you can think could take down a zombie nicely that doesn't fall into the other categories. Good luck. Be creative.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Firearms are a completely different story. Unless you're well armed... no, actually, firearms are always useful. They just have some downsides, depending on what you have.<br>  <br>  I'm not going to sort the guns, considering there are probably more than 10 categories. I'll just be specific.<br>  <br>  I mean, guns are more difficult to find than melee objects, and unless you're in a hunting shop, you're not going to find much. And unless you know where you can find ammo, you're gun won't last long.<br>  <br>  A pistol will probably be the easiest thing to find, I suppose. I'm only a teenager, I don't know how you go about getting a gun. All I know is, some people keep a gun in their house for self-defense. Others are hunters, and those people would be the best-suited for something like this. A pistol would keep off zombies, and if you aim correctly, you could take down one at a time nice and efficiently. Not the best|`|qrB0QxN8aa	Well looking at movies.<br>  Firearms are better than hand-to hand (but hand held weapons can help).  It would help to outrun both the slow ambling zombie and the fast agile crazy 28 days later zombies.  In most zombie movies the zombies get to you eventually no matter what you do.  Groups are better for traveling and raiding but if you just barricade yourself in with a ton of food then maybe having more people will quicken the rate at which you need more.  By the way remember to have a list of all the girls who have turned you down so you can call them all up after the Apocalypse you can call them up and say "Oh hi Cindy. remember when you told me 'not even if you where the last man on earth'?  Well guess what!". Boy I love talking about zombies as if they are a feasible threat.  It makes me laugh.|`|0NIbSyvMaa	Wear a tin foil hat in the shape of a upside down oil can.
IVy35SE2aa	I think the Indian astrology is also different from chinese.  But I don't<br>  know a thing about them.

My Great Grandmother had died and I was under a lot of stress.  She raised me.  I did not want to live with her husband (my Grandfather) or her son (my Uncle)....and they constantly argued over my and my brother's futures.    My Grandfather wanted us to be farmers,  my Uncle wanted us to go to school and become a well educated businessmen.   I wanted to chose my own life.   I got upset,  ran to the bathroom and had sleeping pills in my hands and almost took them.  I am too much of a coward to use a blade, and had no guns around to use.   Lucky for me,  I did not do it.    I did my own thing after that anyway.   But it was a major change in my life.|`|JPQVyCVJaa	manymany many time's lol , actually my last attempt , i took all my meds went on life support for 3 days , stayed in hospital for 5 months , and whiole i was there , they let us out for "weekend passes" meaning we get to go home for the week end then back in the hospital , i snuck a razor blade and cut my arm up to **** , had to get 82 stitches, then , i got out , did another attempt  , cops came, i tried to grab a cops gun form his hoister and he took me to the ground while another cop tased me XD lol it ******* hurt , but my attpemt with my pills and going on life support , i know have to suffer from serious mental illness , this was about 4-5 months ago , i am starting to see things that are not actually there , and im hearing things , all because i took over 350 anti depressants and scizophrenia meds.|`|4d9935586be55aa85a6c466ef935061faa	nope never tried never will|`|EWFtQNSdaa	Yes, last year I OD'd on anti-depressants and I was in hospital for 3 weeks.

Then I was sent to the psychiatric unit for 3 months.<br>  <br>  Last November, I was plagued by suicidal thoughts, so I tried to cut my jugular vein in my neck by taking a drinking glass, breaking it, and using it to cut my neck. I ended up in the ER needing stitches and a stay at the psych unit.<br>  <br>  I have also tried strangling myself with my shoelaces. That was the most uncomfortable feeling ever. I hated not being able to breath. So I would repeatedly try to deprive myself from oxygen, but wanted air so badly that I let go. But one time, I had tied and untied the shoelaces so many times that by like the 7th time, I couldn't feel need for air anymore. I was about to pass out, and if I passed out, that would be the end of me. So I remember laying in my death position, with my arms thrust back ready to die. But right as I was about to pass out and die, I thought about it in my last moments, and untied the shoelaces. I then called my dad and he sent me to the hospital again.<br>  <br>  I still get very suicidal, but I learn to control it better. I still have the option to run myself over on the nearby railroad tracks, but I have thought better.|`|0ff2304aa58946a2151ca64e5d9e7cd9aa	No, but the opportunity presented itself.

She obviously doesn't sing the faster songs live because she dances as well and it would be too hard for her to do both at the same time. I don't think that it takes away from the concert if she lip synchs because she's still out there dancing her butt off for the audience and it's great to watch. But yeah, she might actually sing some of the slow songs live if she doesn't dance around too much.<br>  <br>  Dancing and singing live don't mix.

fQghpx3Zaa	My two absolutely faves are Adam and Anoop! I love, love, love them! They are amazing. Adam's voice is out of this world insanely amazing and powerful! Like wow! Anoop is a good performer and has a good voice and personality. <br>  <br>  I don't really like any of the girls. I'd pick Jasmine though. She's so underrated but I think she's the best girl there and the most current.|`|FHQZz8dNaa	Adam!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! He looks damn fine in them tight jeans, touching himself, while hitting a Steven Tyler high note BABY!!!!!!!!!!! I like his classical rock toneage!!!!!!! I also like Scott and Danny too! I really hope ppl pick Adam for his talent, not how really super hot he is tho. That factor always helps tho LOL!!!!! I also love Alison, cuz she sounds like Kelly Clarckson, and she has real energy on stage. Megan is cool, cuz for a common looking forgetable girl, you can't forget her unique voice!!!!!! I CAN'T STAND TATIANNA ...SPELLING? I DON'T EVEN NEED TO EXPLAIN..........|`|DnHKZ0kGaa	I like Danny Gokey and Scott 9the blind guy) because they are really talented and for girls I think Lil Rounds has the best voice.|`|OMTMv29Taa	Lil'Roundz... Did i spell her name right? Anyways i like her cuz shes got a powerful voice.|`|nbW9Zqi0aa	Guy: Danny<br>  Girl: Lil Rounds<br>  <br>  I'm hoping Lil Rounds will win cos she seems the most genuine to me and has the greatest potential to go on and sell a lot of records. Her sound and her look are current and I think she'll go on to be a successful top 40 artist.|`|lo6xQpz1aa	#1..Guy...Danny Gokey, #1 Girl:Allison <br>  #2:  Scott are my fav's.<br>  <br>  Megan... That little twisty thing she does,, that's halarious!<br>  <br>  Adam can sing... he has a kinda of new age Elvis look to him, but I think he needs to trim the back of his hair, kinda looks like a wig to me.|`|AA12043222	Girl-Allison<br>  <br>  Guy- None.They all sound gay and Adam really is. I would like Danny, but he makes me sick using his dead wife to get votes.|`|o2FJIXS9aa	I don't remember the last names, but I like Allison with the bright red hair and Megan with the long blonde hair. Allison reminds me of Kelly Clarkson but a little more edgy. I always like the girls that can rock. I liked the song Megan sang - I thought it was sassy and I want to see what else she can do.|`|cETQuE9waa	Girl: Allison<br>  Guy: Adam, Danny, or Scott<br>  <br>  I really like how Allison could sing the Heart song!<br>  Adam, Danny and Scott all have great voices.

cxNLOPHNaa	You have two options open to you. As well as a long shot for a third.<br>  <br>  1- Go to their profile and see if they accept IM. If they have it enabled, send them a message whether their status is "available" or "invisible". If they are not logged on, they will be able to read it the next time they log on to IM.<br>  <br>  2- Wait until after Midnight. At 12:01, PST, You will have a new day, and the email function will open up to you, once again.<br>  <br>  3- If the person you seek to contact has asked a question at least 4 hours old, and they have chosen a "Best Answer"... Then the "Comments" box has opened up. You could leave the Asker you wish to contact a message in that box, and hope that they check back and read your comment.

YHT998N1aa	1. Quest Crew<br>  2. Jabbawockeez<br>  3. SuperCrew|`|7lZnHiYZaa	1. jabbawockeez<br>  2. quest crew<br>  3. super crew.<br>  <br>  <br>  i just really didn't like super crew... even though it was obvious that they were going to win over SoReal Crew. (even though i liked SoReal Crew moree) And this season was really closee! I almost thought for a second that Beat Freaks were going to win! I'm happy for Quest Crew, but I don't think they won by very muchh!<br>  <br>  can't wait for season 4 :)|`|yD5pz3Cnaa	1) Quest Crew<br>  2) Super Cr3w<br>  3) JabbaWockeeZ<br>  <br>  A lot of people would consider JababWockeeZ first but I think they're overrated and that Quest Crew and Super Cr3w could outdance them any day.|`|76740ad28a40658e6b40499a8b2cb447aa	Jabbawockeez<br>  Quest Crew<br>  Super Cr3w.<br>  <br>  I loved Super Cr3w, but they couldn't touch Quest Crew. And as much as I love Quest Crew, no one could touch Jabbawockeez. They're in a league of their own and they were the original ABDC. But I loved all of them and thought they all deserved the title. All 3 seasons, I knew these crews would win their season from the first episode. But if they were all on the same season, competing against each other, it would come down to Quest vs Jabba,with Jabba winning and Super Cr3w would place 3rd.|`|tjWinaXZaa	i say <br>  1-Jabbawockeez<br>  2-Quest Crew<br>  3-Super Cr3w<br>  <br>  i personally wanted SoRealCru to win season 2 because supercrew most of them have already been known for the bboy competitions and crap and because they basicaly only did a buch of stunts<br>  i<br>   wanted quest crew and jabbawockeez to win because they actually do "choreography" unlike SuperCr3w|`|ZKVlF2pKaa	1) JabbaWockeez<br>  2) Quest Crew<br>  3) Super Crew<br>  <br>  I personally think that both Kabba Modern (Season one third place) and Beat Freaks (This Season second place) were both better than Super Crew and that if one of those two crews had competed on season 2 they would have actually won instead of being finalists.|`|wLpVXhbBaa	Wow, they've already had three seasons?  I though they were only on season 2.  I have no idea who Quest Crew is, but Jabbawockeez rocked!  Supercrew was pretty good too.
pMKAfsgNaa	it's never rude to keep watching tv, in some cultures it's expected. what the hell do you think tv was invented for?|`|bea2c50e30c8c234aeb6e88e02424208aa	If, by "disinfectant" .......you mean napalm and/or white phosphorus....... ......maybe it is a *little* bit rude.<br>  <br>  The other day one of the neighbor kids came by crying 'cause he scraped his knee.

AA11707096	My mom is a Libra and my dad is an Aquarius,  They have been married for 55 years and even though there were some rough times the really look kind of sweet on each other all the time now.  They;re both 60 and they seem to have more fun with each other now more than any other time.  Of course, their kids don't live with them anymore, that could make anyone significantly happier.  Your sole mate, astrologically speaking, is the sign directly across from yours on the Astrology Wheel.  If you are an Aquarius then your sole mate would be Leo.  If he is a Libra, then his is Aries.  Aquarius is a great sign, Libra's can tend to be moody and sometimes mean.  But Aquarius finds it easy to tolerate most everything.|`|xrUmI9dUaa	I don't believe that you should base your compatibility with someone on a horoscope.Especially since they aren't all that accurate,and when they are it's pure coincidence.You should get to know someone the normal way,and figuring out if you'd be compatible with that person if up to you,that person,and any form of relationship you two already have.Anyway,best of luck.|`|9KDE7v7Haa	As long as your interests are mostly on the same page, sure!

3vfrO1bOaa	its all about US as people. WE killed hip hop. An artist cant get grammy nominations, paper and sells if it wasn't for THE PEOPLE. Support your favorite artist and stop with the downloading. Demand shows in your community and keep lame rappers out of your mouth. Its gonna take mad time but that alone will change the game. Majority rules.|`|D2p9tV84aa	Yes it definately has.  the hipsters have now adopted hip hop into their culture but it's usually skinny white kids listening to other skinny white kids to stay away from the scary big black men.<br>  <br>  Skinny jeans are not hip hop.  caps tilted to the side are not hip hop and if i ever see one more person with a public enemy t-shirt who know none of their songs i'm gonna slap them.<br>  <br>  hipsters annoy me|`|wYYxqAu8aa	Yeah 4 sure because all the so called "rap or hip-hop" songs now are more like pop songs and it is a lot of the same thing-there is no real rhymes or anything its all repetition! An 8 year old could write these songs!!!!!!!!!!!|`|OGNBOaKyaa	i 100% agree with lord!|`|a02180765517a018eecd133f0f7b2876aa	rap has cancer. Hip-Hop is at rap's still healthy heart. BET sucks too. The adoption into the mainstream has just made it a little more difficult to tell the fake from the real for anyone who is used to looking.<br>  <br>  OR you could say Hip-Hop and rap used to overlap. . .<br>  A lot. You couldn't have Rap without Hip-Hop or Hip-Hop with out Rap. Now that Rap is patrolling the streets looking for a quick thrill, Hip-Hop has outgrown Rap. They still talk, but Rap and Hip-Hop ain't what they used to be.|`|1lvyUwo7aa	I don't think Hip-Hop is dead you just have to listen to the "alternative music" meaning you can't turn on your radio and expect to hear something good, you actually have go on the internet and find good songs. Hip-Hop I think will improve a lot this spring with Bone Thugs, Eminem, Dr.Dre, Jay-Z, Immortal Technique, Big Boi, and Lupe Fiasco having albums drop in the spring/summer. Hip-Hop isn't dead its just goin through negative change. I hope those cds comin out helps Hip-Hop get back on its feet.

Good luck in your attempt. <br>  <br>  Final resort? Can just buy the CD, which I think the original one can cost less than $5 USD, if you lived within Asia region. What I can tell you about this show is that: It is an OVA consists of two episode, which the event took place in Rozen Maiden Traumend period, before HinaIchigo "died" and after Suigintou met her medium. It's actually a reflection of the doll's past, focusing more on Shinku and Suigintou's friendship, and how misunderstanding can cause further hatred, jealousy and conflict.

Because the money is needed to fund keeping these people alive... and I would say it is unfair that I am paying to keep them alive for their ignorance ( though it can hardly be called ignorance- people, surely, know the dangers of smoke and alcohol by now) <br>  <br>  I agree with this bill... but I think the government should relax many of their other laws... such as health and safety ones- the conkers game, for example- children are not allowed to play it without wearing goggles, and gloves.

135b47dd06c37bc042aa0969ad35cb25aa	Okay well, for my 14th birthday me and a ton of friends went to the mall and we just hung out there for a while. We tried on dresses and all kinds of stuff. Just an idea. Your birthday party doesn't have to be a sleepover if that's not what you want. I like your idea about renting the hall, you could get streamers and balloons and everything. I've learned decorating is more fun than the party. :p Also you could get games and stuff organized, have a mix CD and put some funny songs on there too. Like the Cha Cha slide, Cupid Shuffle, Hokey Pokey, Electric slide. Stuff like that. Make sure you have lots of yummy snack food too. :) Good luck. and have a great birthday!|`|ZPfCk0sZaa	you can make your birthday a little bit different i suggest to read this article at <a href="http://articles.onlineweblibrary.com/Art/2771/256/Use-Happy-Birthday-Clip-Art-To-Add-Color-To-Your-Birthday.html" rel="nofollow">http://articles.onlineweblibrary.com/Art...</a> <br>  this article about Birthday Clip Art To Add Color To Your Birthday<br>  i think it is good you can try it and you can watch this video at <a href="http://www.mytopclip.com/play.php?vid=10367" rel="nofollow">http://www.mytopclip.com/play.php?vid=10...</a> <br>  it is about latte art birthday it is a new idea for the birthday|`|oZODexjaaa	:D<br>  yea its fine if you call your friends over at a big hall or a club :D<br>  Make the party hall funky and cute at the same time :D<br>  so that this makes your friends bring you loads of good and nice gifts<br>  Plus give them a nice cute invitation card that makes them feel welcoming to your party xD<br>  HOPE TO SEE HOW IT GETS ALONG!<br>                 Love, EnJoYaBlE :)   Good GIrls|`|IFotQ6kBaa	well Im doin the same for my 13th birthday party, even though im already 13 (late party) and I am not havin a sleepover if you dont want a sleepover then you should have a party late like mine is gonna be like 6-10, if you want do a 7-11. hope this helps.|`|dYA5DxFSaa	i suggest book the hall u thoght of having decorate it wid lots of colorful stuff. arrange for some games and competions and gifts 4 ur frnds and lastly arrange 4 a movie that can entertain yer frnds ......since all girls much better put on a movie with hot guys we gals like........A big Birthday cake and a birthday bash....hope i helpd<br>  HAPPY BIRTHDAY|`|V2iADQdHaa	what u have planned sounds good :) why dont u have a hall and then u could invite ppl over for a sleepover.....why dont you want a sleepover that sounds like funn.............just do something funn and be creative

M3pufPlnaa	on Disney Channel its something like<br>  Fantastic Four or something<br>  its about these kids with a dog who solve mysteries<br>  i would reccomend looking it up :)|`|WZa6GhS3aa	Well a very old but good detective one was danger mouse obviously that is pretty ancient but it was good.<br>  Then there's stuff like fantastic four dork hunters or something that was newly advertised recently.|`|SUdyK72qaa	such as detective conan|`|dfjIBHe3aa	Martin Mystery.  It's based on an Italian comic book except the TV series features a Canadian High School Student, his stepsister and a Neanderthal who have all kinds of adventures saving earth.  It isn't as rationalistic as Scooby-Doo but let's face it, it's the atmosphere which makes that series so much fun and Martin Mystery like its source Martin Mystere (about an adult) have that in spades.<br>  <br>  Oh, one of the oldest popular strips, which Steven Spielberg is producing a live action movie about, is the Belgian strip Tintin, which was being serialized in Childrens Digest in the sixties when I was a child, and still in the nineties when I last saw it, and  which stopped when the author Herge (Georges Remi) died.  It's about a reporter, his little dog Snowy (Milou), his friend Captain Haddock and the two detectives Thomson and Thompson (Dupont et Dupond).  They have adventures all over the world.  Not all are about supernatural mysteries (they went to the Moon once) and where there is a whiff of the supernatural it isn't always explained.<br>  <br>  Equally good, and dating from twenty years later is Spirou which was originally about an elevator boy but when the publiisher bought the rights to it he met the lunatic reporter Fantasio and it became something of a gentle satire on Tintin with more science.  During the Early nineties there was a French Canadian TV series (animated) you can see individual episodes of on Youtube, and I'm told there was a brief revival in 2006 but I don't know anything about it.|`|S5FZy9Ppaa	Fantastic 4

9azX3N4Laa	Venus in Aries makes you fall in love or lust at first sight. It makes a person marry someone impulsively. Venus in Aries people confuse sex for love and love for sex. Sex and love mean the same thing to them. You also like rough sex. Venus in the 5th house makes your sex drive very high. <br>  Venus in Aries (Detriment): (Love at First Sight). Venus here impulsively falls in love. You're cheerful, positive, idealistic, yet touchy and easily offended. Your magnetic personality makes you enthusiastic and charming at social gatherings. You go after what you want and can often be inconsiderate of others without realizing it. You must develop more understanding for others' feelings. Your aggressiveness and emotionalism in expressing yourself may drive others away. You fall in love quickly, impulsively and passionately, but if Venus is afflicted, you may be fickle or marry impulsively. You can be competitive in seeking others' affections. You're an idea person and a fast thinker, but have a strong, impulsive urge to become involved in moneymaking schemes that rarely pay off. You demand a lot of personal attention and tend to be self-centered. If heavily afflicted, you can be quarrelsome and restless, causing difficulties in emotional relationships. Venus in Aries is an enthusiastic love. <br>  Venus in the 5th House: (House of Creativity and Sex). You love life, have a sunny disposition and are popular and well liked. You're very attractive to the opposite sex and have many romantic opportunities, which you usually take advantage of. If unafflicted, these love affairs can be happy and successful. Social and romantic outings often involve theater or musical performance-- you appreciate the creative and artistic talent of the actors and/or musicians. You enjoy games and social activities. You can be of great service to those in their teens and early twenties. You adore children and can often gain through them (children of your emotions, mind and body. The latter are usually girls with artistic ability.)|`|0HGqGJYTaa	I would imagine an extremely passionate and romantic person with Aries in the house of Romance, which Leo rules. <br>  <br>  Aries is a funny sign. In some respect, it could be an extremely loyal and passionate lover. On the other hand, it could make for an unstable lover who's bored and looking for the "next" challenge. But, with Leo's influence, I would imagine to have a positive affect on this aspect.|`|VvCs9Ijmaa	Venus in leo makes you a very romantic and passionate person.

obGQ2Bqfaa	Ah! But your C is not the same as Mozart's, and his was different from Handel's..With good relative pitch , one hears the intervals in the context of the key, and the keys DO sound different even without absolute pitch.|`|7gHnVJpyaa	So....<br>  <br>  how many answers are you expecting for this one?<br>  My suspicion is that everyone gets a different experience from hearing music, and would respond to alterations in pitch in different ways.<br>  <br>  I have perfect pitch too, yay for me!... I mean, us!<br>  I guess I shouldn't have answered this one then..... oh well...|`|6LIBZ3nLaa	I don't have perfect pitch...but I can identify intervals and hear distinct notes, basically the same as anyone with perfect pitch. Perfect pitch just determines that you know which note corresponds to what sound and vice versa. If you're referring to being tone deaf.. then that's a different issue.|`|jR8kyp0Taa	C-E sounds different than D-F#, but I wouldn't be able to tell which one was which unless someone gave me a note I could use as a relative base. <br>  <br>  BW|`|eK2xCiFbaa	hmm..  I'm not academically too well versed in music so im not completely sure about whether or not im pitch perfect.  I was under the impression it was being able to listen to any note and identify it which seems impossible.  I can normally identify D because of all the dropped D guitar playing I do, but if someone gives me a reference pitch, say C, I could easily identify any other note from the intervals.  I don't know about other people but I learnt my intervals from naming them to sounds I recognise.  For example, I would imagine a minor second as the "jaws" interval, major second as the "Red Hot Chilli's" interval and so on.  As for C-E and D-F#, I'm not completely sure what you mean by "do they sound the same", because to me the answer is yes and no.  Yes because they are the same intervals and would give the same difference in pitch, but no because they aren't the same pitches.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  Hang about...  you can listen to any note/notes out of context and identify them straight away?  Impressive.  Thats an ability I wouldn't mind nabbing from you :P lol

9ee25102a7763535588f4a899e88f4dcaa	For any piece written before around 1920-30, we can lose an awful lot. From the Baroque right through to Mahler and beyond, composers often used the 'opposed' seating of first and second violins. This is nothing to do with Toscanini. Mozart and Haydn often used to play-off the violins in this way - tossing-around melodies back and forth. This is completely lost when the sections are next to each other. Mahler often used the first and second violins as completely independent sections and would play on the fact that they would be on opposite sides of the stage. Even Tchaikovsky used the effect - such as in the pizzicato scherzo of the Fourth Symphony and at the beginnnig of the final movement of the Pathétique Symphony. Did you realise that, at the very beginning of this movement, no-one actually plays the melody? Each note is played alternately by the first and second violins (and they alternative the harmony notes accordingly as well) - which Tchaikovsky expected to come from oppsite sides of the conductor.<br>  <br>  I'm afraid it is the Americans who are to blame. Stokowski (admitedly a limey), began the rot in Philadelphia and the disease spread from there. It was done in the name of homogeneity of sound! As r_denig has correctly said, some British conductors retained the 'opposed' seating and I fear that now Tod Handley is gone (he was one of the last), we might lose it completely outside of the period-instrument orchestras. To me, it is unmusical and undesirable to have the violins together when the music so obviously was written for opposed sections.<br>  <br>  Of course, the musicians prefer having the sections together - it makes ensemble playing easier and also avoids the second violins playing 'away' from the audience (if placed to the right of the conductor, the 'f' holes face inwards towards the orchestra, therefore giving them a disadvantage against the firsts). However, I think musical needs should outweigh those of convenience.|`|ca64f074806522d41931e7a2676ce936aa	Many conductors have done this, in fact I would suggest that (certainly in recordings) it is the norm. To quote the late Vernon Handley in an interview printed in a CD booklet accompanying one of his recordings of Arnold Bax:-<br>  <br>  'Q, ....as always, you split the violins left and right. Why?<br>  <br>  A. The first and second violins are different sections. In music from Bach inwards there is a written-in antiphonal give-and-take. Seating the seconds on the right gives then their own identity and clarifies the dialogue between the two groups. If the seconds sit next to the first as is now usual they are a pale imitation of them. If you you place the cellos next to the first you have an ensemble advantage because on of the bass instruments is with the group which usually leads the melody'<br>  <br>  Handley was a protege of Sir Adrian Boult whose habit it was also to split the first and seconds.|`|E6tZceP1aa	I actually started setting my middle school orchestra up that way a short time ago.  It was to facilitate a processional performance of "Canon in D", not to enhance sound production, but right away I noticed an improvement!<br>  <br>  When I think aout it, if you are going to "bury" a section in the middle and behind the conductor, it should be a section that has the strength and projection to handle that challenge.  At the public school level, 2nd violins are stereotypically weak and need the acoustic advantage of being closer to the audience.<br>  <br>  Thank you so much for your post.  I didn't know that it actually used to be done this way.  I wanted to share this with colleagues but feared that "sniff" reaction.  Now I can back it up!|`|9PK7mITnaa	It really depends on the piece. Generally, violins are either doubled, or played fifths up from each other. This does not add much color (if any) though adds power and richness of tone. It sounds better if they are at one side, while cello is at the other. <br>  Although, if playing differently, then thats a whole other story<br>  <br>  In final: it depends on the piece ;]|`|AA11279973	I've played both ways and the main problem is the amount of room the cellos need to actually play,  In orchestras with the space to accommodate the extra room needed, it actually does enhance the music, but it is not practical for many orchestras|`|CrAwmz65aa	Putting the first and second violins on the left and the cellos on the right is called the Koussevitsky arrangement.<br>  <br>  Putting the first violins on the left and the second violins on the right is called the Toscanini arrangement.<br>  <br>  (I'm not saying that's who originated those seating arrangements, <br>  I'm just saying that's who the seating arrangements are named after.)<br>  <br>  There is also the Stokowski arrangement, with the first and second violins on the left, the cellos where the winds usually go, and the winds where the cellos usually go.<br>  <br>  A nobleman once visited a rehearsal of the royal orchestra.<br>  He asked the conductor why some of the violins were on the left and some were on the right.<br>  The conductor explained that the ones on the left were the first violins and the ones on the right were the second violins.<br>  The nobleman said, "What?

HeHe~! :P<br>  <br>  maybe they thought that u offended or maybe cz u just ranted .. many of my contacts questions were deleted for similar reasons ..<br>  <br>  Beware~! <br>  <br>  Cya~!|`|4n6iXf13aa	Unfortunately violations are just a part of being on Y.A . All someone has to do is say they were offended and they take your question down. Dont let it get to ya......|`|aTU2OeOKaa	1) IT'S NOT TROLLS<br>  it's yahoo<br>  <br>  2) that was chatting.<br>  <br>  Ffs, read the guidlines children!|`|IM6UsVC2aa	wow thats pretty dumb.<br>  yahoo answers violates the damnest things sometimes|`|YMnTveWuaa	Friggin' &#%@  *@#&#*ing Trolls.|`|654c7643984cd6b3f7f0f00356056e81aa	Sadly, you might get reported for this question, too!

On the weekend, that automative computer kicks in and pulls certain questions immediately based on certain elements found in the question that would remotely "resemble" chatting. I know you typically write this way.... but I think "U" is one of those automatic kick backs that makes them feel that you are responding to someone one on one instead of to the group. I seriously hate that this happens. I'm terribly sorry about your question. *hands Red 10 points back*|`|jpTl3o5naa	I got one violation and I didn't realize I was switched to the guns and sports section. I answered the question of the different guns I fired but said I don't kill animals. Evidently that was enough  to get the violation. I appealed it and lost. They wouldn't tell me why and that's not fair. There is nothing wrong with your question and I have seen many that are explicit go through. Sorry, I think someone is out to get you. That stinks....those little trolls.<br>  I love KFC and a sense of humor! Maybe the part about  "would you let me in?" scared some people. I don't know. It just keeps getting worse. Sorry this happened to you. It seems like we have to watch every word we say anymore. No fun. :(|`|8yE2sYGeaa	This is the problem with trolls: Y!A gives them a lot of credibility.<br>  <br>  Some would say that your question is chatting, that it is not a real question, but if you post in Polls and Surveys, this IS the kind of question one may ask|`|ZkDjl5I8aa	Who let the trolls out?<br>  Woof, woof, woof woof!|`|Ap8tyiUlaa	TROLLSSSSS|`|qlcY8aKFaa	Chat<br>  <br>  It wasn't me that reported it.

I would love to see alot of the old TV Game Shows that were broadcasted back in the past, especially from the 1950's, 1960's and the 1970's during "the Golden Age of Television." Unfortunately, the majority of those game shows from that period ended up being wiped (erased, deleted or destroyed) because video tape (introduced in 1957) was too expensive at that time when it was available to the networks. The Video Cassette Recorder (VCR's) wasn't invented until 1970 but released to the public in 1972 at the inflated price of just over $2,000.00 at that time. <br>  <br>  The three networks in America (CBS, NBC, and ABC) were notorious for destroying Game Shows. However, CBS learned the importance of archiving shows, mainly game shows and regular programming so they stopped doing that practice around the early 1970s (except for soap operas). However, a bunch of game shows ended up being lost or misplaced. NBC & ABC are sort of suspect on their television archives (since ABC was a spin-off of NBC). Supposedly, ABC stopped wiping game shows as of January 1, 1978 and NBC continued this process until the end of 1981 (but rumors are speculating on YouTube that NBC is fully lying on their game shows archives).<br>  <br>  BBC Television was ultimately destroying shows up until 1993 (even though that they did have an archive policy set in place back in 1978).<br>  <br>  The only network that never practiced "wiping" was the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC Television) for they archived everything.<br>  <br>  <br>  David|`|SwTSRubGaa	friends<br>  o.c|`|ddf97263e4bac13f02a3db67a26b8d53aa	be good to have birds of feather back|`|drEfr9waaa	The Goodies<br>  Dr Who (it's back and updated but it''s not "the real" Dr Who in my opinion)|`|Ccj8Y0tZaa	F.R.I.E.N.D.S   <-- the best show ever|`|pB3piiPzaa	Cold Feet.

6Au5FIYWaa	I am also a pisces with a gemini moon. I give off the impression of being extremely moody as well. I will often joke at odd times, even when I feel horribly depressed. Sometimes I can go from crying intensely one minute (or berating someone in anger) to laughing or humming a song the next. It makes me feel a little crazy, but I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing : ) !!!<br>  <br>  I think having a gemini moon with a pisces sun, in particular, will lend to bizarre bouts of moodiness. My ex-boyfriend was also a pisces with a gemini moon (wouldn't you believe) and he is very much the same way. One minute you're attached to your emotions and clinging for your life, the next your floating off somewhere else and start viewing it from the outside. If you can find a place in your head where you don't let either sides take control completely or send you off the wall suddenly, I think this combination can be a very good thing as it allows you to experience both sides of the spectrum in a way, and I think both are important.|`|SlhdAZzpaa	yup i do, very very do..|`|3JL40zc1aa	Well I'm a Gemini Sun and Pisces Moon and Rising...so I definitely have my fair share of Gemini and Pisces...I actually think I am very much like you and the first person to answer...I think it's the optimistic natures of both signs that makes it that way, I think it's a good quality overall! =)

Here's one for you:<br>  <br>  A man escapes from a prison where he's been locked up for 15 years. He breaks into a house to look for money and guns. Inside, he finds a young couple in bed. He orders the guy out of bed and ties him to a chair. While tying the homeowner's wife to the bed, the convict gets on top of her, kisses her neck, then gets up and goes into the bathroom.<br>  <br>  While he's in there, the husband whispers over to his wife: "Listen, this guy is an escaped convict. Look at his clothes! He's probably spent a lot of time in jail and hasn't seen a woman in years. I saw how he kissed your neck. If he wants sex, don't resist, don't complain.....do whatever he tells you. Satisfy him no matter how much he nauseates you. This guy is obviously very dangerous. If he gets angry, he'll kill us both. Be strong, honey. I love you!"<br>  <br>  His wife responds:<br>  "He wasn't kissing my neck - he was whispering in my ear. He told me that he's gay, he thinks you're cute, and asked if we had any Vaseline. I told him It was in the bathroom. Be strong. I love you, too."
yqe0I5zpaa	The movie was terrible. It was a throwback to the exploitation films of the 70's. That is now Tarantino's style, i wish he had chosen another project. If your a fan of Tarantino, you are going to scratch your head after watching this movie.|`|Klb4ZYcVaa	I'm a huge fan as well, so WATCH IT!|`|fQkihSHZaa	I watched it last night on sky movies i liked it at first but then i slowly started to lose intrest. the ending was SH*T but it has got some wicked car chase scenes but i would go as far to say its QT's worst film!|`|SShDNdx4aa	I have the DVD.

He's known for blowin' it out the box when it comes time to party...<br>  <br>  Sutherland strikes me as more the kind of guy who'd hang around in the chaise lounges, drinking beers and chillin' while the barbecue was going... which isn't a bad way to party either, but hey... not quite like burnin' down the house, either.|`|9it5nGJjaa	Rob Zombie, Hayden Panettiere, Marilyn Manson and Justin Timberlake. Sorry I can't choose out of the ones I've selected, but at least I narrowed it down.|`|8v3kQdtmaa	justin timberlake..hes hot :P|`|XTWClFLQaa	Marilyn Manson, I don't like him but it would be one crazy party.|`|547Ln6rNaa	"Party"?

None of these losers.|`|O97uZDN5aa	has to be a draw between hayden panettiere and justin timberlake. the only two sane, non-slutty, remotely normal people in this list.|`|RpxKmUBUaa	Amy Winehouse...she is the funniest and the coolest trainwreck I've ever seen!|`|pTBhq0rHaa	That would be hard, Kid Rock and Gretchen Wilson...Just because I am a southern girl.

That way I would look like the celebrity.|`|Ova4dilbaa	Hayden Panettiere|`|SFGAj0reaa	Whichever is richest.

I think he is so unspeakably HOT in some demented sort of way!|`|gxAyp9iNaa	Ok, let's break this down:<br>  <br>  - If I go with Paris, she'll be likely to get into some sort of trouble (God KNOWS what).<br>  - Amy Winehouse would get too uncontrollably drunk to do anything fun.<br>  - Keifer Sutherland could possibly mistake that guy in the corner for a terrorist, and possibly attempt to incapacitate him.<br>  - Tila Tequila? Really?<br>  - Justin Timberlake might make the party TOO sexy.<br>  - Jenna Jameson is a former porn-star. I'm the jealous type.<br>  - Marilyn Manson is cool, I guess. When he's not a total douche.<br>  - Britney Spears is Britney Spears.<br>  <br>  That leaves Kid Rock, Rob Zombie, Hayden Panettiere, and Gretchen Wilson. Because I would prefer to go with a female, that eliminates Kid Rock and Rob Zombie (however cool he is.)<br>  <br>  Hayden is 5'1", and Gretchen is 5'4". Being 5'8" myself, the obvious choice would be Gretchen to avoid a staggering visual difference. However, other factors now come into play.<br>  <br>  After plugging both Hayden's and Gretchen's heights and what I like to call, their RARs (Relative Attractiveness Rating) into a highly complicated and convoluted mathematical formula, Hayden edges out Gretchen by the slimmest of margins.<br>  <br>  I would go with Rob Zombie.|`|uVo5rGJvaa	Keifer Sutherland.  Seems like a nice guy|`|RfeAiRF9aa	Jenna Jameson|`|6wCsyMJdaa	britney spears|`|m057VroWaa	JT !|`|xck85bSxaa	Hayden Panettiere or Britney Spears|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	Amy Winehouse, if choosing from the list.<br>  <br>  If choosing randomly, Bill Maher or Robin Williams.|`|g5RS83paaa	Justin Timberlake, seems like it would be a fun evening|`|8j70Neqeaa	paris hilton|`|xHc3KGDmaa	Gretchen Wilson|`|mSt1LGfjaa	Kid Rock..,,he is hot hot hot....|`|AA11713693	Paris Hilton or Britney Spears sound good for a party.|`|DZ24AAkiaa	paris hilton|`|ZYrQXiwBaa	None of them.

5f0111f71db8592710a5d1cb4897be4aaa	I think Heather still loves the little snake and feels bad that hes jailed >>> but... knows he deserves his punishment !<br>   I'm thinking.....Evil Adam wasn't really that into her > he was using her and her powers she had in Genoa City ? ( creep )|`|IsxB0Qi7aa	Heather was just doing her job, which I guess was more important to her than her love for Adam. I hate the way Victor always talks about how important family is to him when he is such a cold & heartless person & has even turned his back on Nick & Victoria, now he is turning his back on Adam because Adam was being cold & heartless just like his father. I know Adam deserves to pay for what he did, but Victor did make a promise to Hope & if family is so important to Victor then he should love all his children unconditionally.<br>  <br>  When Adam needed a doctor I think he asked Heather because he knows deep down inside she still cares about him & deep down inside I think he still cares about her. Of course he's not going to come crawling after her right now because he blames her for putting him in prison. <br>  <br>  I don't understand why they are dragging out that storyline & how Jack got away for his part in the fake diary while Adam & Frank the forger are just sitting in prison. When Adam gets out of prison, whenever that is, I bet he gets together with Heather, I doubt he will ever forget what she did, but eventually I think he will forgive her...|`|ow1m3c8jaa	Apparently so, she must think that Adam should know that she turned him in because she had to due to the nature of her job, and thinks that he knows she really loves him despite that and by now he should forgive her for it.<br>  But all Adam is thinking about right now is that he's in there because of her and he may never get out so he's nowhere near ready to just let his feeling go and forgive her yet.<br>  <br>  He's also bitter because Victor won't use all his power and find a way to get him out of there like he would if he were Nick.<br>  When Adam gets out (assuming he does), and calms down he may still forgive her, but even then I am sure it will take awhile before he can.|`|4kuWOZowaa	Yeah..that is what heather gets..she should have went more after jack|`|EPPb5pRBaa	Yeah, she did get fooled..|`|uUzbqGh5aa	Adam is his father's son, and just like Victor, he'll never forget those who helped bring him down!|`|YIAVYlTYaa	it's adam's fault he is where he is. he should be the one begging for heather's forgiveness! she was just doing her job.
uUzbqGh5aa	Wow, that would be sad, but maybe Murphy could help her remember and then they could fall in love properly all over again and get married.|`|nrqWwQBXaa	maybe they will make it where later on they end up being together. just wishing?|`|IsxB0Qi7aa	Well, I'm glad to hear she survives the explosion, though I didn't think they would kill her off the show. I figured the explosion might help her get her memory back, but I don't like how it's going to erase all her new memories. Does that mean she isn't going to remember everything that has happened to her since the car accident or is it just Murphy that she doesn't remember? I don't like that they would make her forget all her memories of Murphy, even if she does develop feelings for him again, it's sad she won't remember all the special moments they had together.|`|ow1m3c8jaa	That's so sad that she won't remember Murphy after all he's done for her, they are so cute together and I was so glad she finally found someone that loves her for her and not her money.<br>  I will be so upset if they write Murphy off the show!<br>  <br>  I am glad that she finally gets her memory back, but really upset that she won't remember all that's happened since the accident like how Amber is just about the only one that never gave up on her and that Jill and Nikki treated her like a criminal.<br>  Knowing Jill she won't even let Kay know all that Amber tried to do for her.<br>  I hope Nikki doesn't start drinking again because she is the one that will feel so guilty by the way she treated Kay and didn't believe that it was really her.<br>  <br>  I really hope they don't drag on this thing with Clint treating Kevin just like his father used to.<br>  Kevin has come such a long way, look at how he's been so determined to save Kay and even risked his life for her, I would just hate it if they make him the creep that he used to be again.|`|5f0111f71db8592710a5d1cb4897be4aaa	Now,,,that is just plain sad !<br>   Murphy was with her through this whole ordeal. <br>   I was really hoping that they fell in love and she could give him a piece of the good life ( something he has never had ) <br>   Looks like Murphy will be back to his Bait-n-Tackle shop.|`|AA10623143	Im happy she has her memory back, its probably better that she doesn't remember how Jill and Nikki were so mean to her.  She can fall in love with Murphy all over again.|`|EPPb5pRBaa	I guess she is getting her other Memory back. I hate the way they are doing this story line,|`|4kuWOZowaa	I didnt see this episode yet..could you write a little more about what happens.
NOIseyASaa	A doctor was having an affair with his nurse. Shortly afterward, she told him that she was pregnant. Not wanting his wife to know, he gave the nurse a sum of money and asked her to go to Italy and have the baby there.<br>  <br>  'But how will I let you know the baby is born?' she asked.<br>  <br>  He replied, 'Just send me a postcard and write 'spaghetti' on the back. I'll take care of expenses.' Not knowing what else to do, the nurse took the money and flew to Italy.<br>  <br>  Six months went by, and then one day the doctor's wife called him at the office and said, 'Dear, you received a very strange postcard in the mail today from Europe, and I don't understand what it means.'<br>  <br>  The doctor said, 'Just wait until I get home and I will explain it to you.'<br>  <br>  Later that evening the doctor came home, read the postcard, and fell to the floor with a heart attack. Paramedics rushed him to the hospital emergency room. The head medic stayed back to comfort the wife. He asked what trauma had precipitated the cardiac arrest.<br>  <br>  So the wife picked up the card and read: 'Spaghetti, Spaghetti, Spaghetti, Spaghetti - Two with sausage and meatballs; two without.'<br>  <br>  <br>  From :|`|kSIbucMjaa	haha. the spaghetti one...lol!<br>  <br>  x|`|Y4RS35M7aa	A horse walks into a bar and the bartender says, "Why the long face?"<br>  <br>  A duck goes into a pharmacy and asks for Chap-stick.

Even if she isn't, just because Hinata likes him doesn't mean Naruto automatically likes her.|`|AA11818174	I don't think she's dead yet but in response to your second question. I don't think Masashi Kishimoto hasn't cared before about his fans getting upset over a character death. He has the whole manga decided already and is just publishing the chapters as it goes. But yes if Hinata dies (which I hope she won't) SakuraXNaruto will be a much more plausible pairing.

32P3hG0Laa	My dear sweet Capricorn Angel... <br>  I have been watching your posts for quite awhile now. And I would like to make a gentle suggestion: Focus on yourself. The better you make yourself, the better you can serve the world and your guy. You cannot make anybody do anything, which is a hard lesson for any Capricorn to learn. We yearn to control everyone and everything... but as we age and grow and evolve, we discover we simply cannot. We can suggest, guide, manipulate (it can be done in a loving way) and advise, but we cannot make someone take advantage of all our suggestions.<br>  <br>  You are beginning to make your guy's troubles (job loss, perhaps some shock & depression) about you. If you feel he has turned away, well... Capricorn's do that in a crisis. They pull in to find the things they need to do to come back bigger and better. And it is hard to be giving and loving and attentive when he feels like a failure. Every Capricorn takes a public failure personally. And you cannot rush or out wait a Capricorn, even if you yourself are one.<br>  <br>  If you can, try and back off a little. Focus on yourself. Improve and evolve. Teach by example. He will be watching.|`|ax9xk0Ndaa	Aspicco couldn't have said it any better..<br>  So true..<br>  <br>  Us Caps are so complicated and when things go wrong block out everything..and just like you're doing right now there's times when we just think & think about things until we make ourselves upset and analyse it to make it sound even worse than it is..<br>  Oh yeah & we're even more stubborn when things go wrong knowing we have other's wondering about us..even though we subconsciously like knowing we have someone there for us..but everything will work out better.. <br>  Treat him as a butterfly<br>  Trust me Angel once he's found himself again he'll come straight for you..x

The words helter skelter where written in blood at the crime scene where the Tate-Labianca murders were committed.|`|XhJuHMwQaa	He didn't steal it.

My daughter has had chicken pox three times.  The doctor said she can get them again, because she never had enough for her body to become immune to them.  She only had 3 or 4 little marks each time she had chicken pox.  However, they now have a vaccine, my two sons received the vaccine and never had chicken pox.|`|AA10075716	Yes you can get it more than once but this is not very it usually happens because the person was not treated properly for it the first time round and then the person has been in contact with someone who has chicken pox.

BJIo6twUaa	Taken - very good movie, best i have seen this year.<br>  <br>  I also read on here that a lot of people wasnt impressed with Friday the 13th. I havent seen it yet but i will probably wait until DVD, but Taken was worth seeing in theaters.|`|YQ1Q7XeEaa	Taken is quite good.  Lot's of action from beginning to end.  Great acting and good writing.<br>  <br>  Friday the 13'th is remade, tired and did I say remade?|`|AA11540024	Friday the 13th|`|vvAyfBGCaa	Taken is the best  movie in theaters right now. Friday the 13th has been remade at least 4 times, and none of them have been very good. Taken will keep you on the edge of your seat, where as you already know what's going to happen in Friday the 13th (people look pretty, people die, girls scream and somehow still look pretty, they die, more screaming, more death, the end.).<br>  <br>  So, Taken, is the best choice.|`|Xbgd5h8zaa	taken is way better you wouldn't regret|`|GCQZMuCtaa	Taken|`|2g2GLblXaa	Taken by a mile!<br>  <br>  one of the fastest paced movies i have ever seen, Liam Neeson is GREAT!<br>  <br>  movie is along the lines of the Bourne series action wise|`|AA11412052	Flip... EASIEST question EVA!! lol, Taken, of course!!|`|EImm4teRaa	Just saw "Taken" last weak and it was awesome. Best movie I've seen in the theater in a long time.

cAauS5aqaa	I blame the entirety of the human race in general. I think that when it comes down to it, we are all to blame by not, down through the years, listening and trying to maintain the teachings of people like Martin Luther King, Abraham Lincoln, Bob Marley, John Lennon, Bob Dylan, Malcolm X, Bobby Kennedy, JFK, many more. These people were true advocates and gunslingers for peace, and although we have holidays and make movies about these people, we still don't uphold their visions. It behooves us to do that in the long run. We oppose races like the blacks, the Jews, Middle Easterns, and other nationalities because of things that happend in the past (usually commited and dreamt up by a single person) and hate them. I have friends from every creed, from Hispanic, to white, to black, to Asian, Arab, it doesn't matter. There should be no discrimination because it leads to hate and ultimately, death.|`|sr3l6pgsaa	"Your fault is my fault too".<br>  <br>  Once upon a time,there was a home called "YOU".<br>  You had lots of addresses,but there was an address missing.<br>  You knew many people,but there's someone that you haven't met.<br>  And that person is "YOU".<br>  <br>  We are the ones who needed peace.<br>  We would profit from it.<br>  We are the ones who went so far away from our simplicity and true nature.<br>  We need to come home.<br>  The home needs where we are,not a block with four walls and a precise number.<br>  A home is where Peace is.<br>  And the home is YOU.<br>  <br>  Every hatred starts from "YOU".because peace is to be felt,not a definition.|`|ZvWDWvA1aa	Old survival instincts that are still engraned in us but mostly useless now. Jelousy is a good example.|`|d61511600922f016b452fc8b39ab7408aa	Everybody!!!|`|prKwpJ8haa	Hitler & Osama|`|M3s3TrbAaa	i think terrorists.....|`|f4fddd96f6c1635b7fc9966339558ba9aa	People with inflexible ideas and closed minds.

RTfPrlEhaa	i think they are all pretty unique..i like ryan, baya, and chet the most..ryan seems really cool and his song on the last episode was awesome..baya is a great dancer and seems really chill..chet has a cool style and it's really cool how he's interviewing bands on the show..they have awesome web exclusives on the mtv site and you can see more about the cast: <a href="http://www.mtv.com/ontv/dyn/real_world_brooklyn/videos-web-exclusives.jhtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.mtv.com/ontv/dyn/real_world_b...</a>|`|294db1e52bf0162d7d7ff79b4102975faa	I saw the episode with the boys fussing at the girls. I thought that the breaking of the table was way too much and I would have been packing my bags at that point.|`|fe5be031d9c57e4799c55e4f222ca2ecaa	I watch it from time to time when I am scanning channels and can't find anything to watch because for some reason I cannot get into this cast.  This is coming from someone who has watched The Real World and been a huge fan for many years, and I also felt this way about the Philly cast...I hope it's just these people and not that I am growing tired of the show in general.  <br>  <br>  I do applaud Katelyn for being so brave on tv...I think Chet's secretly gay, Baya is so quiet you'd miss her if you aren't careful, Sarah is ok, kinda dramatic (but who isn't?), Devyn is def. a diva, the rest of the guys don't contribute that much, except Ryan's occasional anger issues...
v1hCymAEaa	You asked this in the wrong section.Celebrities may have more answers for you. As for your question, Ashley Greene is not fat and will do fine in New Moon.

I got it fixed a few times, it really took a few different plumbers to seal the crack, so if you do have one burst ever, make sure a really good plumber fixes it.

CQX3TAIoaa	That would be so awesome. I watched the scenes, but you just don't get it the same as from the game. Unfortunately, I suck at the game. (And video games in general.) Luckily my brother is good at videos games, and so I'll watch it and he'll play. But then he goes off to train, and then I'm like "uuuugggghhh."<br>  <br>  Uh, tangent there :)<br>  <br>  Anyway, that would be very awesome.

(I looked at your profile). Please, stop asking them. You bore me.|`|ZYrQXiwBaa	I think it's inappropriate to see it as an opportunity to see girl's panties.|`|UHIi8AuQaa	who|`|hi7uk4Kmaa	Um.. who?|`|s3Ztpnelaa	Do you think so?<br>  I don't have an opinion on her =]|`|81Ru1OL6aa	no its corny|`|wSYhEREjaa	she's pretty, but i can't say cute cuz i'm not a lezbo<br>  <br>  ?|`|HWijr6uxaa	huh?|`|qpjorXRnaa	Holy crap dude, ive seen you ask like a million of these questions..my god|`|ROWSzTknaa	I like banana flavored condoms.|`|d3a0045532049c589188fdb06b472cffaa	off course not! it's funny and at the same time u could hurt yourself.|`|4idInZwoaa	I'm confused....|`|E6J3Ci5faa	what?? im confused...if you slip on a banana peel it hurts!|`|qwInrvUGaa	this time i have no idea who you are talking about<br>  <br>  how about you ask "is moo cow cute?" next.|`|D78jfOMZaa	It can be funny but I will help you get up:)|`|FomIa9jQaa	I guess so:)|`|IM6UsVC2aa	NO|`|0APjNSc5aa	No.|`|f2Lcv80faa	Huh?|`|YYUWqbC7aa	stop asking if you think girls are attractive....horndog|`|lfDDdq4Gaa	nO. but i think yOu wOuld like it.. if i slipped lOl.|`|eta0c25yaa	no|`|Ova4dilbaa	i have no idea.|`|4gyOqTqGaa	i think thats just about as cute as dead babies...|`|7tNv9T3oaa	No, but a slip made of banana peels would be!|`|Tr1hzduraa	yes but not as Hot as Shadygal back from suspension|`|rpVQpJA7aa	Sure|`|CuSvCNrpaa	yes, very cute.|`|YtDp0wjdaa	do me next lol =]|`|uVo5rGJvaa	Not sure who that is.|`|BBVfRheyaa	Ouch !!|`|wz8gx3gaaa	I hope your legs are all right.|`|CArzkDIUaa	I am a girl, so no.|`|gEkLQWF4aa	more of these questions?

UKxNhn7uaa	yes i do|`|KoNHUcNUaa	Definitely. Thats when he was being true to himself, before he got all "gangsta".|`|3drMJB1maa	Same with Me Against The World|`|Bwosoy7jaa	it was all good. i personally like me against the world the best. but i have all his albums and love them all. any thing that u think is gangsta is him just trying to vent out the pressure and pain. their was a lot of pressure on him at death row so his stuff sounded more hard. but in everyone of his songs he yells u to stay strong, now what singer do you know who does that and Truly means it.|`|UX2dqQQVaa	You could always go back further and talk about 2Pacalypse Now.  I think that 2pac was nice before and after.  I mean, I like All Eyez On Me a lot, but I like 2Pacalypse Now a lot too.  He just progressed as an artist.  He's not my favorite artist, and most of the time I feel like people overhype his skills BUT he did have talent.  <br>  <br>  To answer your question...probably a tie between the two.  But I like 2Pacalypse Now more than I like Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z.|`|r7xSbMbaaa	LIKE BOTH|`|9MoytEURaa	2pac is like the legend of rap .|`|ZzubQcfXaa	I like the pre-Death Row Pac, was more of an artist imo

Qbhuj5a3aa	Hi, Yes It was so surprising but what happens on Rockwiz isn't different and surprising.<br>  Paul Kelly was awesome. In fact everyone who performed was great!<br>  Did you know there was 11,000 in the crowd.<br>  I was totally in awe when Judith Durham came on & sang "The Carnival is Over" at the very end.  What a wonderful talent. Still singing like a princess.<br>  This was a truly magnificent singalong event for me.<br>  I hope they replay it for those who missed out!<br>  Long Live Rockwiz!!!!!|`|JvBGKmpyaa	Missed the first 45 mins or so but loved what I did see.<br>  <br>  Ross Wilson is always brilliant! <br>  <br>  I thought it was wonderful that they got Marc Hunter's daughter to do 'April Sun in Cuba'. <br>  <br>  Closing with Judith Durham was so fitting!   (I think The Seekers' farewell concert at the Bowl still holds the audience record?!)  Her voice is still going strong after all these years - a well deserved standing ovation!|`|PeqdWE3waa	I have not stopped talking to all my friends all day about this concert!<br>  Julia was great as usual.  The Rockwiz band wow they are just the best. Wasn't Judith Durham still wonderful after all these years!!!!!!!<br>  What was the First Album that you bought: Mine was Normie Rowe and was even in his fan club. (I still have the LP)<br>  Never was allowed to go to a live concert as a teenage but did go to the Wrestling at Festival Hall even had ringside seats.<br>  My first live concert was in my early 20's I was married and my now ex-husband was a fan of the goons.<br>  We went to see Harry Secombe in Concert at the Melbourne Town Hall with my In-laws.  I know you will find it difficult to believe but he was a fantastic performer doing varing bits of comedy in between songs like "If I Ruled The World" etc.,  My next was Harry Secombe again this time at the Sir Dallas Brooks Hall but it was only my ex-husband and I this time; it was a superb concert. Since then I have seen Randy Travis at the Art Centre & Neil Diamond at the Tennis Centre where we were 8 rows from the stage on the aisle it was great.

If Justin have or had feelings for Britney he wouldn't do all that bs that he done to Britney instead of helping Britney he went against her, and you call that love, no way.

Lg2F2pIKaa	Yes.<br>  Let me tell you a story from childhood.<br>  It happened in secondary school. One day in the play ground i was searching for my blazer(jacket). I asked my friends have you seen my blazer. And they just laughed i did not understand but i did not take it very seriously. When i realised 10 minutes later that my blazer was i understood why everybody laughed at me. And that was when i got embarresed.|`|WQcxODKLaa	yes .<br>  i had this brand new pearl necklace that my mom gave me and one minute, i had it and the next it disappeared, so i went crazy and started crying too, and after 20 minutes of searching, i realized it was still on my neck . it happens .|`|EsufC1qhaa	happens... life|`|AA10387455	I`m 78 now and still haven`t reached that point.|`|cjlwOKR1aa	that happened to my glasses once. i was wearing once all the time, when i realised i was wearing them the whole time i thought it was kind of funny. i then told my mum and she laughed.<br>  <br>  yes............ it is fustrating trying to find something and then you find that you are wearing it / it is in your hands!|`|97sKOWQ0aa	Yup|`|qlDe6N6gaa	only when im high...it sucks. and is a pretty dumb feeling.|`|NIUkYdL2aa	Either that or my pocket|`|aXtV5YdFaa	yes, it's humiliating
wFsqpdN9aa	Good editing.<br>  You turned the photo around and made it darker.<br>  But photos always look better natural.|`|1EyRZm4Faa	Pro!|`|ZFTkBTvvaa	your editing is good, your the next air brusher for playboy magazine.<br>  <br>  <br>  but you need a better looking girl because i dont care if your jesus, nobodys editing skill is going to make her look pretty.|`|267739bad1b3dc41ca6496f1c1d996bcaa	Thats pretty good - you made her skin tone more even, the lighting is a bit funny on the after picture though<br>  But still, very good editing!<br>  <br>  <br>  =)|`|qwInrvUGaa	pretty good|`|prKwpJ8haa	cool
GI27dKIkaa	Absolutely !<br>  <br>  There's far too many charity adverts on tv these days - asking two pounds for this - three pounds for that - AND they don't pay for the air-time either !<br>  <br>  Just like my local town centre - there's TWELVE charity shops - none of which pay rent.  I'm all for donating to worthy causes - BUT - they should be self-sufficient !|`|2OO9U8o9aa	Well they do need money to run the organisation and help those children who are neglected and ill treated by parents . I don't particularly like adverts like this , especially those that use  emotional blackmail to get you to contribute . I much prefer to select on my own which organisations to help . But I know that the adverts do indeed get cash rolling in so good luck to them , most of these organisations do a fantastic job with limited resources and wonderful volunteers|`|ssGQsRJWaa	What all these Charities that are Springing Up wont Inform you in  Their Adverts are, the Amounts They Deduct from All Donations First, Before Using it On Charity. It starts at 35% in Every Pound Going Upwards Depending on the so Called Charity........They do not Do it for Nothing!|`|3904bf9cec60af77f3ce3e9dfcd8c007aa	And the rest,Two pounds a month for this two pounds a month for that,Totally cheesed of with it.|`|9Ao28gYaaa	The adverts dont really stop them from dying but they bring it to the forefront of peoples minds.<br>  <br>  I think they do help as they guilt trip people into paying money and if you know of kids being abused you might say something. You can never stop showing them regardless of how much they get on your nerves.<br>  <br>  That money helps the NSPCC to stop children being abused and being killed.|`|AA11323431	never give to charity the money never goes to the people who need it e.g where does the nspcc get the money to pay for their adverts.how does comic relief,children in need collect ￡20+million every year and all they show for it is one well in a village, who pays for lenny hendry and his fat wife to go to africa and show them what its like to eat five meals a day|`|iBH7NTl3aa	I'm sure a lot of the directors of charities have a financial interest in the advertising!|`|tNk6j437aa	They are trying to do a good job and need funds so whats your problem|`|4D059ohkaa	Yeah I seriously do hate charity adverts, its geldoff's "give us your f**king money!" all over again!|`|MfBDN2mxaa	Grow up. Or are you just THAT thick?
i6Th0lItaa	I agree with you. The book was brilliant, but I'm afraid a lot of people won't "get it". Plus, if they want to make a 2 and a half hour movie, they're going to have to cut out some parts, and that will take away from the storyline.<br>  <br>  That being said, I saw it yesterday, and I thought it was great!|`|fQkihSHZaa	I admit i haven't read the books (after watching the film i am going to) but i really enjoyed it i wouldn't say it a super hero flick its very grown up plus its been getting very good reviews<br>  <br>  PS aren't movies a from of art.
eUwetilMaa	hey i am a song writer, also!! i write about my life. the truths. but i stretched the truth a little........... but also having a crush, breaking up, telling a guy/girl there stupid and should have u, having a fun night out with friends and many more!!!!|`|6iBbDrueaa	write a song about what makes you love writing song<br>  a magic moment you're living in|`|ReCy0Omxaa	Yes<br>  <br>  you can write about anything and make it into a big hit...look at Lady Gaga<br>  <br>  you can even write something about a coffee mug...haha...seriously though...look at some Lonely Island music...it's all silly stuff|`|DsnMKfLsaa	Love<br>  Hate Anger<br>  Just a song...?
yqe0I5zpaa	Raging Bull and No Country For Old Men are my 1-2 in my top movies too!<br>  <br>  <br>  I don't care for Donnie Darko at all...<br>  <br>  <br>  my number 3 is The Departed<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: It just isn't my style of movies, i understand that the movie was brilliant. It is. But it's not something i could watch over and over.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The Departed is an example of a true crime film. It has great dialogue, great plot development, the characters are developed well, the entire ending is just genius... the film is truly one of the best.|`|SpPfs3o9aa	I enjoy raging bull and no country for old man too.they are kind of my all time-favorite movie!<br>  and I like Taxi Driver (Robert Deniro) and usual<br>  suspects(Kevin Spacey).they are my best!
O2jX3lpQaa	lol i live in australia, so i wouldnt know... or would i?|`|YhuH2k4Caa	she is so annoying...shes like irrelevant. shes only there to be the female  hard** since paula is so sweet and everyone is tired of hearing simon say "that was absolutely dreadful"|`|3Nr9o9UDaa	I have to admit that i miss when it was just the three judges, but she doesnt particularly annoy me|`|SWU4eQA4aa	I think she's good. she's not crazy like paula, and she's not mean like simon. she's in between, just nice enough and just mean enough. i like kara.|`|elfIbUCmaa	She's ok, better than Paula. At least she's not drunk half the time she's judging and she knows what she's talking about. but on the other hand she did get pretty jealous of "bikini girl"|`|7OuNY2q9aa	American Idol?, Judge?, what is it a legal show?|`|270fdb1e8d561581a5bd83644348c012aa	I think, ( so far) she is right in the middle. She is nice like Paula but honest about it like Simon (even if it hurts) and funny like Randy, but I'm not sure if I like her yet... I think we need more time really.|`|xA6iDhKDaa	At first I was like okay whatever she's not that bad. But now I just find her annoying. Very annoying.|`|1Cg5CU2naa	I personally dont like her.  I think that she is too full of herself.
5ADpQYDSaa	yes|`|Fyt9JxTqaa	Yes. It's actually a bit creepy. Her face never shows any emotion.|`|1945ddd3e3bf4d0537d95dec0c73cfb9aa	extremely. she has no characters of bella and has nothing for which edward may fall for her|`|EvxVrGPQaa	No. I do have to say that she can have the same expression on her face for a long.. long time. But I do like her. Because she is not the next Lindsay Lohan [No offense to her fans, really :-) ] who is in the news 24/7, doesn't mean she is dull. She has her own personality and is not an attention seeker.<br>  <br>  I do have to admit that sometimes I hear she says things that are kind of wrong, but most of the time quotes of people are always mis interpreted.|`|DhOjQM34aa	No I think she is a really good actress<br>  Just cause she isn't all fake and attention seeking doesnt mean she's dull<br>  :)|`|3qWxd9HNaa	No, if she is she wouldn't be in front of the camera?|`|zD7bHkSyaa	not dull, but not like HELLO LOOK AT ME!!|`|cYElnuFeaa	Yes but no...<br>  I think her expression on her face makes her who she is<br>  makes her mysterious. plus she's really hot!
cMw0R0oRaa	PETS.<br>  P<br>  ET, as in Extra Terrestrial<br>  S, as in sun.<br>  <br>  Duh?|`|Wjlg0nLZaa	yEAH ITS PETS SORRY IVE COPIED IT!!!!
G6Uy43coaa	I have an online relationship with my best friend.  We have fun and do things we enjoy online and on the phone.  I haven't received a virtual STD yet.....THANK GOD...however, I know of some who received the real life STD's but then again, men need to watch where they stick it.  Not everyone in real life is who they say they are either....<br>  <br>  In any event, its best FOR ME, to get to know someone without all the physical stuff clouding who I think he is before I hop into bed with him.  But I'm not a ho.  Some people have better, more fulfilling and intellectual conversations with those they meet online than anyone they spent time with in real life.   <br>  <br>  Sad for the people they met in real life not to be able to hold the attention and be interesting enough of a person because  they HAD the opportunity to actually see the person in real life and hold them and have real sex with them.  I guess the  online person was found to be more interesting.|`|CtJLXDJjaa	HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA... <br>  <br>  .....okay well just had to get that out of my system lmfaoooo.<br>  yeah i do agree with you.... i feel meet people over the internet is just fine, chating with often and such is good.  you get to know people from all over the world and its pretty interesting.  as for relationships, uughhh, that i find a little awkward.  you do F*CKING even know the person, half the time they are not who they say they are, plus do you even know what they REALLY look like???<br>  <br>  Com'on there are plenty of single guys and gals out their who you can meet off the street instead of off the internet.<br>  <br>  okay ill admit i did have a "thing" with someone off the internet, but i would NEVER call it a relationship, since i hardly even knew the person.  yes we chatted pretty much daily, but i dont really know who he is, and we had nothing going for each other..... really if you think im the kind of person who just going to "see" one guy over the internet, your WRONG.  damn i saw many guys over that time period form my home town, so you couldnt call it a relationship!!<br>  <br>  therefore online relaitionships are PATHETIC.... just like the guy i was taking to before!!!!!!!!! =\|`|s7UWLOS9aa	Pathetic. You never even know if that's them. It could be like a 50 year old pedophile. And besides, you never really get in contact with them. I mean seriously, is it that hard to get off the computer and find someone in real life.|`|blbd7e1Qaa	Well.., it surely is safe sex as at least they won't get STD's (except computers infected with malwares, trojans etc. computer viruses)<br>  I find it actually pretty hilarious...<br>  <br>  But on the other hand.., knowing some person in cyber first, is often easy way to introduce...  And later in real life...|`|Gc49JgoQaa	It's only one step further than having an online friend. And I personally feel online friends to be legitimate, even though they are a different form of social interaction compared to a real life friend.<br>  <br>  Online girlfriends/boyfriends are a bit of a stretch, though.|`|Io7x29vhaa	Lmao.Pathetic|`|G8VNBSj7aa	It could be nice, funny if you meet nice people here.|`|1y5IxCVyaa	Its not really for me, but if it makes other people happy then that's cool|`|OMoOg5WJaa	Pfft as if thats gonna work|`|98db094f444e5154c3fcacd3e51e23c2aa	Willing to give it a shot, send me an email :)|`|LgNqYUECaa	Oh I lol'd. <br>  <br>  Um. Not so sure.|`|d07797575b9836110677f24a37896268aa	Is that an offer? wink wink ;-)|`|Tl9ErwUGaa	i think its creepy<br>  and pathetic<br>  <br>  hello . . youve never met them<br>  <br>  weidos<br>  <br>  what if they turned out hideous and had the worst acne and all those pictures they showed you where theyre gorgeous is actually theyre cousin who works as a runway model<br>  -takes a breath-|`|Uip8NpD4aa	yes it is quite pathetic l agree and with some of the emails l get, l can see why they hang around the internet with their sad little lives|`|prKwpJ8haa	It's s2pid lol|`|4n6iXf13aa	childish........... personally if i cant get a piece of *** there is no relationship.|`|SjLDdUh7aa	Yes, it is lame.|`|xVs6vFhXaa	l a m e|`|PKhIXkJAaa	Sometimes it can work out for people. <br>  It certainly doesn't interest me, but I've known of people it has worked for. <br>  I guess it's just like any other way of getting to know people. The difference is that online it's much easier for people to be deceptive about who they are and what they are really like.<br>  <br>  I've got some good friends online, but I'd never consider  anything else.<br>  It's pretty risky.|`|KN36rGMvaa	I think they are stupid.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Cheers<br>  -Will

DsWgAqS8aa	Buffy's feelings have ALWAYS been strong for Angel, and to answer you, more than her feelings for Spike. I know she tells Spike she loves him, but i really do not think she meant it in a romantic way. I think Buffy's love for Spike is more of a "I have come to respect you now" type of love.<br>  Spike even knows she doesn't really love him romantically. I have come to learn that Spike is special when it comes to love, he knows the truth of peoples feelings. He may be a vampire now but even so he is the same forlorn William we saw so many years ago. He knows about love, and i believe him when he says Buffy doesn't love him. He knows.

But there is one man who deserves the credit for establishing the fundamental rules of the sport and for organizing the first baseball game. He is Alexander Cartwright.<br>  <br>  Cartwright was a member of the New York Knickerbockers, a club of young businessmen who regularly played Town Ball to escape the confines of their office lives and get some exercise after work. In 1845, Cartwright and a committee from his club drew up clear rules designed to convert Town Ball into a more elaborate sport. He called it Base Ball.<br>  <br>  Rock & Roll was NOT invented in England. You obviously don't know much about music history. All the great artists from England you mentioned came WAY after Rock & Roll started. The Beatles will even tell you that two of their biggest influances were Chuck Berry and Buddy Holly, and Buddy definately wasn't obscure. <br>  <br>  Blues was perfected way before that great Eric Clapton was born.<br>  <br>  I'll go no further here, because as I said, it's obvious you no nothing about the subject.

UIglk6AVaa	no she's far too talented for a bond film, anyway she's so much more well known than Daniel Craig and she would steal his thunder!|`|akcGfgdcaa	No, I can't imagine her in there. She's far too talented to be in something like a Bond movie anyway.|`|9Cog4Tj0aa	I agree with the first guy... it just doesn't seem right 4 her 2 be in a bond movie...|`|76140b1733cd124dbe960a504bc06f8daa	Only if she takes all her clothes off.  Finally.|`|yOsBSqDUaa	I love the James Bond films, and Friends. I think Aniston was great in frineds, but after playing that role for so long, shes become pidgeonholed as that sort of actress, drama and comedy. I think that she just wouldn't really fit in a Bond film in the audiences mind. That said, I think anyone would have to see her in that sort of action film before they could pass judgement|`|Bh1eq1pNaa	She's too funny to be in a James Bond movie|`|Y4RS35M7aa	Aniston is a mousy little dishwater-blond bimbo of some small talent.  Maybe she'd be OK to play a corpse or something.  A Bond girl?  No way.  She's just not glamorous enough.|`|w2Dui70Faa	It just doesn't match. Jennifer Aniston is an amazing actress, but I just couldn't see her in a James Bond movie.
ObeBvtzgaa	I think it depends on who is judging and what genre of music they are playing. It is always best when they combine the two, but there have also been some great guitarists who weren't able to play extremely fast and sweep, yet they are still very good.|`|LkN5nr6faa	David Gilmour's guitar playing captivates more more than Michael Angelo Batio's guitar playing if that means anything to you. It's all about the soul!|`|89xzNpVaaa	Any good guitarist or wants to be a good one needs passion, practice, and right attitude. Come on, if you don't love what are you doing, then you suck, and practice of course, practice with anything, you can do it, attitude is important to me, you shouldn't be too proud or humble, just be you.<br>  OK ,for example there are many guitarists who had/has a lot of passion in guitar, but never played a popular riff.<br>  It doesn't mean that if you play a famous riff, and there you are a good guitar player, first comes practice and passion.|`|kTlapd8Aaa	my opinion is that you need an amount of both...it doesnt help if you have a lot of feeling and passion but you completely suck at what you are playing.|`|9hFexadLaa	if they have the ability go play the guitar great|`|ISljRZIRaa	A mix of both. No great guitarist lacks feeling and skill.|`|nEn6EPuqaa	if you look on youtube theres lots of good guitarists covering peoples songs flawlessly.

A good friend is worth more than some guy who probably won't even be around for more than a month.  Don't lose the trust or friendship you have with your girlfriend over this guy.<br>  <br>  Actually, he's showing you what he's really like by going for you over your friend.  What makes you think he wouldn't do that to you too if you got with him ever.  Instead of falling for you he should be concentrating on his relationship with your good friend.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you and your friend.  There are plenty of guys out there where you don't have to date or go for your good friends boyfriend.  Way too much drama there to be worth it.|`|A9NBtUy6aa	All is fair in love and war.! :P<br>  <br>  Nevertheless, I'd talk to him about it, and tell him you can't do that to your friend.

32P3hG0Laa	This is a tough one to answer. I have not personally seen a lot of Sun/Moon conjunctions in my years of experience.<br>  <br>  I have seen people with Sun/Moon in the same sign. These people do have a certain inner harmony, but they also lack the ability to look at themselves objectively. Their inner and outer selves have the same feelings, goals and ideas. For most of us, we can use our Sun to evaluate our Moon, and vice versa.<br>  <br>  Regarding your last paragraph, I only consider a Sun conjunction combust if the orb is 1o or less. This is pretty rare with the Moon. And I understand your comment about the mother being extinguished by the father, but I wouldn't make a blanket statement just on the Sun/Moon conjunction. Conjunctions are, in my experience, kind of "neutral" aspects. They join two energies, but it can go either way depending upon the all the other planets and aspects. There would have to be other indicators in the chart, like perhaps a Saturn square the Moon (Saturn is "dad" too...) or Pluto aspecting Moon or Sun,  or perhaps other aspects. Also, what's going on in the 4th (mom, home) & 10th (dad, public image) houses?<br>  <br>  You may see the Sun as burning, but heat can also melt and ergo, the two merge. So look at the whole chart for the full answer.

T9fxCu50aa	Do you have a utility room or work shop? Or is there a room or area that is usually reserved for pets, such as a dog kennel or a cat condo?  This is a good possibility if either of these are in the basement. Try those.  Look up in the air, on a shelf or at the top of a closet possibly near sharp instruments, like knives or cutting tools.  Perhaps a red toolbox is in the area.  Look there.<br>  <br>  If you find it in such a place I'll explain all this.

cLW7vFUGaa	...I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and hope you're referring to the fact that, in the show, she's hailed as such a "striking beauty" and yet she appears not that much MORE beautiful than everyone else in her school. It's just the art style, with its idealistic features for all... But if you think someone else is prettier, of course, that doesn't make the other ugly.<br>  <br>  So, otherwise, DO NOT BLASPHEMIZE THE HARUHI unless you want her to inadvertently wreak her melancholic rampage on the world!!<br>  <br>  Looking at her in terms of character design, from the anime standard, she is almost undeniably quite pretty. If perhaps you just saw a bad picture of her...<br>  From original light novels: <a href="http://www.fishatlas.net/girochin/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/haruhi_book_01_s.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.fishatlas.net/girochin/wordpr...</a><br>  From CD single: <a href="http://parttimeotaku.files.wordpress.com/2006/07/haruhi_singlecover.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://parttimeotaku.files.wordpress.com...</a><br>  From anime OP: <a href="http://53rg10.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/suzumiyaharuhi.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://53rg10.files.wordpress.com/2008/1...</a><br>  Long hair: <a href="http://www.cartoonleap.com/wp-content/gallery/june_2008/haruhi_50.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.cartoonleap.com/wp-content/ga...</a><br>  And don't deny that ponytails turn you on: <br>  <a href="http://s184.photobucket.com/albums/x177/crisuskeer/MyAnimeList/?action=view¤t=haruhiKyon07.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://s184.photobucket.com/albums/x177/...</a><br>  ^^<br>  <br>  If you truly just happen not to like her appearance for whatever reason, fine for you. There are plenty of other anime beauties out there for you to choose from, who are beautiful in different ways and with different moé points that may appeal to you. But know that plenty of people will beg to differ.|`|bMMZKrvDaa	uhh..the only ugly person is the one who just asked this question.....u sure u didn't see a crappy fan art of her?...or are u just blind. In my opinion she looks nice.|`|yrGVGn2Xaa	How is she ugly? I'm sure when the mangaka drew her, he/she thought that Haruhi was pretty. Maybe it's just how the art is drawn which makes you dislike it. She sure wasn't meant to be "ugly", if that's what you thought! For an anime character (I like anime), she's actually quite pretty! I hope this helps! Bye!

AA10053661	I know.... it's really sad. When they first started the TC badges, every category was included. I had one for P&S. Ok not that it's a huge accomplishment of makes you any different from any other answerer, but it was pretty normal just because these badges were floating all over the Yahoo site. <br>  <br>  But the majority of all violations came from P&S because people came here to "play" and not to "contribute" knowledge or wisdom (which I sooooooo soooooooo disagree with). So the TC badge was removed from P&S. Really pretty cruddy...... NOT that we care a flying flip about having a badge. But it basically was a slap from yahoo saying that this was a playground and was not on the same level as other categories that THEY had indeed created themselves. <br>  <br>  We're just little step children and I know they are so chomping at the bit to just get rid of P&S....... but could you imagine the fallout if they did? Wow!<br>  <br>  So we just exist knowing we're best..... Badges? We don't need no stinking badges!!|`|2Hl4AAP7aa	there are no t/c in p&s or jokes and riddles|`|xe6wc0jXaa	I agree.

NzrTIPPuaa	One most certainly does old girl, I find it puts a spring in ones step first thing of a morning. I sometimes have the twins help me as I'm a little slow getting started of a morn. Tip top.|`|ba4R1tf1aa	That would be quite the feat for me, since my computer and bed are not located in the same room. <br>  <br>  Plus, in the mornings on weekends, there are other things I like doing more. Like doling out orders for service in bed. Always have others do for you what you don't feel like doing yourself, that's what my mama  used to say.<br>  <br>  Who doesn't love some ham between the sheets for breakfast?<br>  With their eggs, sunny side up...|`|qdPtCBJeaa	I just love a good bashing in the morning too, Hattie, and some in the afternoon....and again in the evening. (and sorry for draining the Babe) I like to post a little something while I m having the morning cup of coffee too.|`|AA10387455	Sorry, but when I wake up. the bathroom is my first thought.|`|PHKSoUTDaa	There was a time when I would regularly bash one out every morning.  You know, during those brief moments one spends sleeping alone, which I must confess, has never been more than for a few days in my case.  Now wife number three gets very upset if I'm staring at my laptop whilst bashing one out because she feels she's missing out on all the fun and wants to make her own contribution, which usually sucks and can cause the laptop to fall out of bed if we're both trying to get at it simultaneously.  At certain times of the month if I ask nicely, and tell her what I  want to produce, she will bash one off for me because her fingers are much more nimble than mine and she gets it done faster than my ham-fisted attempts.  She's ambidextrous too.|`|mMmNEljxaa	I did that once and broke it so I don't use alarms any more we have an inner clock you know. I wake up when I don't feel sleepy any more, just a bit later than sunrise probably much later than I really ought to.|`|sNNRQxhOaa	???? bashing peple is not nice|`|Tl9ErwUGaa	wow<br>  <br>  O.O<br>  <br>  major obsession much?|`|oWHplAzwaa	I'm not talking Answers, more redtube.|`|WT9cjXtIaa	Usually Maggie will give me a nudge and I'll respond to it.

zlrWHQ68aa	mine's green also|`|WfwFuQB0aa	i love all colours but my favourite is purple or shades thereof such as lilac, mauve, light and dark purples, violet.<br>  <br>  my problem is if i go into a clothing store and there is something with purple (or shades of) i usually buy it.    have even been known to buy purple candles.<br>  <br>  reason - i am a leo, king of beasts and the royal colour is purple.<br>  <br>  the only thing i don't particularly like are purple bruises.|`|CplYpG8Naa	my favorite color is WHITE. it symbolises  peace which is d current need in this time of terrorism....|`|prKwpJ8haa	Green and Blue|`|BOmPuInsaa	Colour of friendship and love.|`|U23DRFtbaa	Blue|`|YRsxg6Z3aa	black !!|`|thcr8Y5vaa	Black...|`|1hiImyBdaa	Red.|`|kPmzj4Rcaa	i like pink - bright neon pink [:<br>  but i like all bright colors though tbh. ?|`|YTQGKzuqaa	My favourite colour is pink =]|`|uJskRjP7aa	Purple|`|qhU3PDgfaa	black...|`|GTsKitahaa	My favorite color is the purplish pinkish color that the sky turns at sunset.

akcGfgdcaa	Completely agree with you about Ross.<br>  <br>  Intially Chandler was my fave but Ross just started getting some great episodes after the failed marriage with Emily.

MYYYYY SANDWICH?!!!"<br>  <br>  -The one where Ross gets his teeth whitened.<br>  <br>  -When Ross gets a tan.<br>  <br>  -The one where Ross gets a sofa and the whole section where he's screaming "PIVOT!....PIVOTTT"|`|7hhBEZGRaa	Joey|`|Y0w2Pk5kaa	Joey ?|`|XbGkjC4Taa	tie between Joey and Phoebe :)|`|ZAvV3WfLaa	I like them all, i can't pick, but towards 9th & 10th season Ross has got to be the funniestt! i love the fake tan episode haha x|`|oVirVMYFaa	Ross|`|FI1a6NPDaa	Phoebe, chandler or joey<br>  <br>  i really dk ahha<br>  <br>  xxxx|`|j4SjsBdNaa	I LOVE FRIENDS!!<br>  umm... my fave is PHOEBE!! she is soo funny<br>  i also quite like Chandler<br>  but... i love them all<br>  awesome show<br>  =]|`|OKZkABDqaa	phoebe or chandler :)|`|MXjvZMUXaa	Definitely Joey. :)|`|uJskRjP7aa	Phoebe :)
kJFPd6JSaa	i always believe in this line which was told by one of my friends..<br>  ''never ask god for what u desire ask for what u deserve because ur desires may be few but u certainly deserve a lot better.!!''i think god's clever.he knows if everyone gets wat they want then no one will remember him and he has perfectly etched out what every person needs the best!!!its not about wat we need it its something which ought to get!!!!|`|jROpVbrhaa	Thats life, So we must accept it that way.but i think it depends,not all wishes come true ,its a matter of hard work and patience.And also with the guidance of the Almighty is the most important one.<br>  <br>  How i wish we will be friends.!!! Good day!|`|lNB2IOqUaa	You're generalizing. That does not happen to everyone. Maybe it's just your luck? :)|`|WpWzrdO6aa	I have wondered this same thing for way to many years and I have yet to find an answer.|`|A8mKCXuUaa	Yes,it is so bcz dreams never come true.<br>  But sometimes what u don't want is better than that u wanted to have.|`|aDhZIhQcaa	Have you ever noticed that we want what we can't have or shouldn't have?  And I truly believe that sometimes what we wish for, subconsciously, we deprive ourselves of or sabotage it because we know that it is not something we need or truly want.  I know that I have prayed for things in my life and God chose to have me wait and then He provided, to me, what I truly needed.  And those things God provided to me have been the greatest blessings I could have ever asked for!|`|SvaneHOFaa	there is nothing like dat it is more the way u see it.the more u desire the more mistakes u make b`cause u r more concerned abt it.try being more postive for the thing u desire ,if  u want to win u will and u and to lose u will.|`|TTt51jutaa	Well, that's not always the case, but it sure happens to me often.<br>  You just have to believe that everything happens for a reason.|`|j2VDYbeoaa	My wishes are simple. An extra hour of sleep...traffic lights that stay green just for me...time with those I love...Perhaps that is the problem regarding ungranted wishes? People are too greedy or complex? It is, after all, the "little things" that mean the most.|`|ergI4qQPaa	Well if we got everything then who would remember the Almighty God above and pray. We get what is the best for us, so whatever we have we shoould find happiness in that|`|eQWAVpDXaa	Whatever it is,we should be happy with what we get rather than being sad for what we wished & didn't get...|`|7bLrZOAvaa	Well, i think it's better to get what we deserve, instead of what we desire.............. isn't it?|`|PMGXddjgaa	Becos you have to do more than "Wish"... You have to work for it!!! xxx|`|CplYpG8Naa	it is not at all necessary that whatever we wish for is exactly what we deserve.<br>  In a life time it rarely happens that one gets more that what he/she deserves.<br>  May be what u wished for was not what u deserve according to your deeds and what u r getting is what u deserve whether u want it or not.<br>  <br>  always trust god n always believe in his existence n power <br>  what ever He gives you must accept it with full respect <br>  <br>  whatever he gives u is best suited for u . may be sooner or later he gives u what u wish for<br>  <br>  All d best fr dat!!|`|aA3NsOkNaa	Life is a comedy I think..lol<br>  It gives us maybe opposite of what we want so we have to learn something. <br>  I look at it like a puzzle maybe and there are still pieces missing if you are living, one never knows which piece will show up next...Making it very interesting. <br>  I smile and enjoy it, even if it is what I never expected, I am still alive.|`|ViZoXKUTaa	That would be Mr Sod and his silly law.|`|wz8gx3gaaa	If we wish for unrealistic target and want only materialistic things in life, we will never be contented.  Waise Bhi Samay Se Pehle Aur Kismat Se Jyada Kuchh Nahin Milta.

Instead of screaming and throwing a fit. I just walked off.|`|UE79TUFRaa	Not my current one. But my last one, yeah. But I had no hard evidence. But then minute one of his friends had a little too much to drink, he spilled EVERYTHING.

Anyways you disappoint me that was one of my bad dreams. lol|`|01dfmIjPaa	noooo okay, Taylor was in the dress she wore to film "Love Story" and that pic of Miley was one of the pics of her and her boyfriend (not Justin or Nick, some other dude) on a bed (not IN a bed, but ON a bed, not under the covers or anything)<br>  <br>  that is so totally fake|`|Qr9Ecqgbaa	Ummm... It's so obviously a photoshop img. You can see the line fold in the middle and the chair miley's sitting on doesnt even match up with Taylor's. They're also seem not aware of each other so...<br>  <br>  IT'S A FAKE and TWO IMGs COMBINED BY PHOTOSHOP!|`|wRQdLXG6aa	That pic is so fake. Look at the lighting on their faces and arms. And even if it is real they are good friends. Something wrong with that ??|`|g6yXXF8Caa	thats called photoshopped|`|TukQ4g8baa	oh that picture is fake and whoever made that is a loser that is just a waste of time.|`|9Epea6vaaa	that is photshoped and sitting together dont mean they are more than friends|`|i5HaqMgjaa	that is a fake pic|`|5hIVsBx8aa	wow that pic is really really fake and even it wasnt it isnt even that bad so they're sitting next to eachother. big deal!|`|i5GT4nNhaa	Unless Miley Cyrus is about three times the size of a normal human being and can defy gravity, it's fake.<br>  And, are people not allowed to make any physical contact with their friends what-so-ever anymore, or what?

Y1aAGPURaa	I like the "oldies" but goodies.  Here are a few for you to enjoy:<br>  <br>  <br>  There was an old man whose family could no longer afford to take care of him. So the family decided that a nusring for the aged would be appropriate. <br>  <br>  Of course the old man rejected the idea, but no sooner he was convinced that it was the right thing to do. On his first day at the home, he spent most of his time laying in bed reflecting on life, feeling lonely. A while later, an orderly stopped by to seee how the old man's first day was going. <br>  <br>  "How you doing today?", she said to the old man, "First day I see". The Old man replied with a nod. <br>  <br>  In no time the two began talking up a storm. As the conversation began to drag on, the orderly was eyeing the room filled with fresh flowers, cards and balloons from friends and relatives. She noticed a bowl full of peanuts sitting on top of the table next to the bed, and help herself to a handful. <br>  <br>  As the two continued to converse with each other, the orderly kept eating more helpings of the peanuts. She look at her watch and noticed that nearly 2 hours had passed and said, "My goodness, the time has gone by quickly. I have to tend to other people here too." "That's okay.", said the old man, "I feel so much better being able to talk to someone." Looking into the bowl the orderly said, "I feel awful! I ate almost all of your peanuts!" The old man responded, "That's okay. Ever since I got these false teeth, all I could do was suck the chocolate off of them anyhow." <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  As a senior citizen was driving down the freeway, his car phone rang. Answering, he heard his wife's voice urgently warning him, "Herman, I just heard on the news that there's a car going the wrong way on I-95. Please be careful!" <br>  <br>  "Heck," said Herman, "It's not just one car. It's hundreds of them!"<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Two police officers saw this old woman staggering down the street, stopping her they can tell she has had far too much to drink and instead of taking her to jail they decide to just drive her home. They loaded her into the police cruiser one of the officers gets in the back with the drunk woman.<br>  <br>  As they drove through the streets they kept asking the woman where she lived, all she would say as she stroked the officers arm is "Your Passionate" They drove awhile longer and asked again, again the same response as she stroked his arm "Your Passionate". The officers were getting a little upset so they stopped the car and said to the woman, Look we have driven around this City for two hours and you still haven't told us where you live. <br>  <br>  She replied I keep trying to tell you: "Your Passin It!"|`|Wjlg0nLZaa	aLL KINDSA JOKES BUT LOVE THE JOKES THAT R MESSAGED THRU FREN COZ THEY MAKE U SMILE EVEN IN THE WORST OF MOODS|`|DrW4sKv1aa	Funny

9azX3N4Laa	Wow your loving is very good, almost too good. You are very romantic because your Venus in Pisces. Thats the best sign Venus and be in. You love unconditional and are very very very very romantic. You usually end up with the wrong type of person who will take advantage of your compassion. Wow i have so much to say about your romantic nature but dont have that kind of time. Not only are a Pisces, but your Mercury is Pisces, your Venus in is Pisces and your Midheaven is Pisces. You should definitely be a nusre or have a job where you have to care for people because it comes naturally to you. And should be very attractive because your Sun in conjuction Venus. You are very pyschic and emotional. You also put up with things that you shouldn't put up with in a relationship.

WvwWgp7iaa	No it is definatly not in the book! I found at yesturday that his GF was playing Hermione's friend, but only whn you posted this did I realize how wrong that would be. Only through the first 100 (give or take)  pages are they not searching for horcruxes. But during that time they are at the Burrow preparing for Fleur and Bill's wedding...<br>  <br>  The only posibility I can possibly think of is a wedding guest and they watch Harry, Ron, Fred, George, Bill, and Charile play Quidditch in the backyard of the Burrow.<br>  <br>  However if that is the fact, then I will be VERY disapointed. We will have to wait 6 months after the first part of The Deathly Hallows for the second part to come out and, like you said, maybe it could be condenced into only one part if they didnt add something as stupid as that!|`|o924Por5aa	I think the article got it wrong.  She's suppose to be in the Half-Blood Prince, which is coming out this July.|`|m9MT3Nsoaa	I read that book about 2 months ago. their is no quidditch except when they play in the back yard once or twice. at the burrow|`|B9dgSQtIaa	that's wrong, plain stupid, there's no <br>  such thing.|`|1OJNgIVyaa	No its not in the books it could be at the beginning though where they are all getting ready for the wedding like a bit of fun for the kids. I agree with you though if they stopped adding longer scenes than the ones they were cutting then the movie would not need to be in 2 parts.|`|cAyMzxXfaa	No, there's no such thing in the book. But maybe they are adding some flashbacks or something. They don't always stick to the book, do they?

o2FJIXS9aa	Well, I am a Pisces but I have a Sag rising. Anything having to do with animals would be a good bet. All Sagittarians love animals. I have 4. They can be found volunteering at animal shelters, walking their dogs, I even adopted one of my pets from a Sag lady that was running her own pet rescue place. Since they are usually religious, a church would be a good place. And they aren't all goody two shoes there either. I've known some wild ones there that mean well but just can't restrain themselves from relationships. Most Sag women love sports and love to play sports - a football or baseball game would be a good bet.

They were "created" just for you. If you're older than that, you should be able to figure out they were basically put together by the Disney Channel, given some songs written by other people, taught simple rhythms to play on instruments and plenty of air time on Radio Disney and in between their TV shows. That doesn't sound like a good band.|`|rzm1ZDovaa	I think the reason why ppl are not so into Jonas brothers is that they have different voice. You know what i mean...

Of course, it's Stanley Kubrick's!|`|k2ETwjitaa	I didn't like it at all. Especially the eye scene.....<br>  Don't bother - Kubric or not.|`|Wqjaz2cgaa	IMHO Stanley Kubrick's worst ever movie, based on the sensationalist and meaningless novel by Anthony Burgess.  Check out his really great movies, like Full Metal Jacket, The Shining (great horror film), 2001 : A Space Odyssey, and Spartacus. <br>  Which reminds me of my favorite Spartacus quote - 'I'm Spartacus... No, I'm Spartacus..... No, I'm Spartacus...'<br>  Happy Viewing!|`|qZaNu8Hvaa	Yes, A Clockwork Orange is one of the greatest movies ever...worth watching once....it's a classic.<br>  <br>  Watch anything Hitchcock did.....North by Northwest is probably my favorite of his.

tBaCFTtBaa	i have a "friend" like that.  actually, she is my friend's friend, so i've seen her at every birthday party, graduation, wedding, etc.  we've always gotten along, and then she became friends with my cousin and spread lies about me!  about sex on top of it!  and she knows Nothing about me, especially anything about me in the bedroom!!  the next (and last) time i saw her was a few months later at a birthday party.. she acted like nothing happened, so i did, too.  i wish i said something, but it was a party... but i made sure Everyone knew what she did and i hardly spoke to her.  i hope you can figure out what is right for you.. make no regrets.  good luck!|`|7R7e6yX5aa	i don't|`|9TAHh7tjaa	id make em bite the cuuuurb|`|vH480nisaa	Don't care, because she/he always talking nonsense.|`|AA10387455	I treat them with the contempt they deserve.

Don't say it sarcastically, even though you mean it sarcastically. Smile lots, and say 'Your hair looks so amazing today!' or 'That colour works so well with your skin!'. This will make her confused, then suspicious, then guilty for being so horrible. She won't show that she's guilty, she'll just say something back, like 'Shut up you bl*oody slag!', but if she says something utterly horrible, just laugh and say 'That's so funny' or 'You crack me up'. I did this to a really two faced girl, and it drove her up the wall at school. She told the Year 10 guidance manager, and she got two afterschool detentions and loads of lines to write for being so awful to me, and I got rewarded for being mature and kind to her.

And he hadn't had any human contact for those years and when he gets out he is really really fucked up and he's on a journey to find out who it was that kidnapped him and did this to him and why. Its got a fucked up plot and its definetly a pyscho thriller.<br>  <br>  Another good one is "Donnie Darko"<br>  Its about a guy who sleep walks and wakes up one day, is convinced the world is going to end in a certain amount of days and he decides that he can do what ever he wants because the world is going to end and so he does and he ends up uncovering a pedaphiles secret layer and meets a girl who he falls inlove with because through a sequence of events that he creates from realizing he can do what ever he wants, he ends up meeting her and in the end. The world does end, but only for him.<br>  <br>  "Paradise Now" is another good one.<br>  Its in Arabic and its about two palestinian guys who are best friends and live normal lives. One day they get recruited to become suicide bombers against Isreal and I guess in their culture its an honour to be asked to do that, so they decide to do it and basically the film centers on their last days and what they go through mentally and their families and basically their whole lives just change and suddenly its almost like one of the guys sees the bigger picture and he's having doubts. <br>  His whole world is turning upside down.<br>  <br>  Sorry these descriptions are off because I haven't seen some of them in a while and I'm trying not to give too much away so that you can really be into the films.

rzm1ZDovaa	Yup, you're pretty much the same... go for it!|`|eVt0qkT8aa	Personally, I think that when it comes to love, astrology goes out the window. My mother is a Taurus and my father is a cancer - they irritate each other and do not get along at all, so it's not a harmonious match as it seems. However, this also means that it depends on the whole chart, not just by sun signs.<br>  <br>  Speaking of that, to answer your question, some say that Gemini and Scorpio is a horrible match, because Scorpio is very secretive and Gemini is very curious - the scorpion is less likely to open up easily unless they really trust you. Your scorpio could a heavy air influence like my friend who's a scorpio ( moon/rising/saturn in aquarius, venus in libra) who may communicate his feelings easier and you might have a good water influence to respect his secrecy. <br>  <br>  But all of that said, I say go for it !|`|ypLiYJMnaa	Follow your heart. Dont follow zodiac sign.|`|Nx0kNuO4aa	It does depend on other planets in your chart, but based on sun signs alone, you guys will clash, Scorps are too serious, jealous and controlling for a gemini, who just thinks and chats because ideas are fun.<br>  <br>  But if you're up for some hot NSA then take it and run.|`|VvCs9Ijmaa	No, for water and air signs do not go well.|`|xTpADMajaa	he just wants to hit it. go for it

TcS1YyxIaa	Good Grief, if Ichigo died and Hime brings him back, that would sooo suck 'cos it's happened before, with the whole Grimmjow thingy.<br>  <br>  My guess, maybe he will have a lil' talk with Zangetsu, or SHirosaki will come out? Maybe SHirosaki will have his power fully tapped into, we may get new movies for Ihigo, or a new look for Tensa Zangetsu!~<br>  <br>  Ichigo might just be down for a while,(don't blame him with that huge hole in his chest) and things may go on just with Hime, Ishida and Ulqi-chan. Or we may get a history or life story of Ulqiourra..... ~ ^_~<br>  <br>  Or, Kubo may tease us by switching to the Rukia/Rudabon fight. I real wanna see a reaction from Rukia regarding Ichigo's fading reiatsu, maybe she will get a power up and kick that Tree's *** ^^<br>  <br>  Who knows what will happen? I'm biting my nails here XD

Pay half up front and half upon return.<br>  <br>  Or, if there is an organized city tour you can take, a bus would probably have room for the bag.<br>  <br>  That's all I can think of offhand.  If you are stuck with taking the bag, you could still take a taxi to a lovely restaurant in a scenic part of the city, dine, and not have to worry about rushing back because you'll have plenty of time.  I think that sounds great, actually.

They made the ending a little stupid because they both could have fit on top of the piece of wood.|`|Klb4ZYcVaa	EVERYONE saw Titanic. I'm just really proud of Kate Winslet. Terrific actress.|`|5sTPhPGiaa	Margaret, Chris and I went to see Titanic some time ago. During the part where Jack is drawing Rose au natural I said to Chris, “Wouldn’t it be funny if he were a really good artist but he couldn’t draw noses?”<br>  <br>  Then I thought of my friend Jason replacing Jack in the scene, and how he’d draw a beautiful picture and, at the final pen-stroke, **** something up. He’d scribble angrily over Rose’s face and fling his sketch pad across the room. This moved me to such uncontained laughter that I had to leave the theater and go into the bathroom to laugh and laugh and laugh.<br>  <br>  Chris was giggling just as much. He told me that he thought of that drawing in the movie with a “bulb nose,” or perhaps an upside-down “T.” The “bulb nose” kept him stifling the laughs. We both hurt ourselves by morning with the jokes.|`|2zgv89OQaa	Yes, one of the all-time favorites.  It did make me sad, just to think people and families were lost was so tragic.|`|X9RjMselaa	Yess it made me cry so muchh. ohh i love that movie its so sweet.|`|XCVFEAC8aa	yah, it's such a sad movie!

nkmwGAKjaa	My daddy wouldn't buy me a bow wow, either! And I suppose during my lifetime I have over-compensated because I have had countless dogs since my childhood.  ;-) But I did have a cat and I was very fond of that!  I did so enjoy the dogs and the bawdy song!

She was never classified as a "singer" and was more along the lines of getting the "average joe" involved in a pub singalong, making people feel good. I dont think she ever expected to be judged on her singing capabilities. She never professed to be Dame Joan Sutherland. I think you are being a bit hard. The voice suits the song. But in answer to your question, my voice is more refined than hers but I dont know that I could ever match her appeal and entertaining value.

AA11355531	I just saw the movie last night. (** SPOILERS **) They Have sex. No mistaking it. Quite a few scenes show a guy humping on top of a woman; the attempted rape scene is more on the violent than the sexual side ... a man knocking around a woman; So sexually I think it's too much for an 11 year old; who will probably see sex one way or another; but best not to encourage it by taking them to watch it on the big screen.<br>  <br>  Violence factor is high too; it's more bloody/gorey than sin city or 300 - people getting shot, bones breaking, arms sawed off, one guys head Hacked repeatedly with a big knife - it's very violent. So i wouldn't take them to see that either - Most of the comic-book films have been careful not to show too much blood because they Want the kid dollar; this movie, in my opinion, is rated R, because it's aimed At Adults - and NOT made for kids ... <br>  <br>  Rated R should really tell you there, that it's not something to let your kid watch - when I was 11 .. my parents NEVER let me watch those kinds of films .... but, each parent decides what is best and ultimately this is what you need to do; As someone else suggested, You should go see the movie first, and then Decide if you want to allow your kid to see it.|`|NtWslbpraa	Sorry for your son, but I would have to say No. I am 17 and I saw this last night and first of all, I think you should just save your money and time because this movie was not that good (comparing this to any other comic book movie like The Dark Knight, Iron Man, LoTR etc.) and there was much profanity, a rape scene, a 5 min sex scene, much violence, blood, and its just too much for an 11 year old. its probably still too much for a 17 year old.|`|qlVQ8GxHaa	NO!<br>  I would not advise for you to let him see Watchmen.<br>  There is a LOT of blood,<br>  violence,<br>  ESPECIALLY the nudity is a LOT!<br>  So I would not let your 11 year old see this movie.<br>  What you can do is maybe let him sleep over at one of his friends house<br>  then go see Watchmen with your friends or something.|`|ARTqP2w6aa	There is one major sex scene. There is also a reasonable amount of graphic blood/gore<br>  <br>  Not for kids sorry|`|b74222ab84625a98e519e55038843a30aa	This is absolutely INAPPROPRIATE for an 11 year old.  There is a rape scene, a lot of profanity and very graphic violence.  I would absolutely NOT take an 11 year old to this film.  -- Father of a 13 year old who will not be seeing this film.<br>  <br>  Batman/Dark Knight was very very tame in comparison.  The Watchment is closer to the movie "Saw."|`|i6Th0lItaa	There is a kind of graphic sex scene (it's like 5 minutes long)... And it is a little like the Dark Knight, where it's hard to tell who's to good guy and who's the bad guy. You go through it thinking you know who's good and who's bad, but at the end you might change your mind. It's really violent, but everything relates to the story. I personally enjoyed it, and I'm 15.<br>  <br>  But all in all, it's not really good for kids.

wA8Dyhq7aa	No, let Ozzy do that.  He's already decapitated a rabid animal, so he's an old pro.|`|JIvvg6f7aa	Kurt lied when he sang "and I don't have a gun". Courtny killed him.|`|NQ3XZElFaa	Kurt Cobain didn't bite pop stars heads off back in the 90's and I doubt he would do it now. Yes they play crappy music, but at a certain level of maturity, you should be able to move on.<br>  <br>  Nirvana fan boys can worship him all they want, but he wasn't that great. He played catchy, heavy, well-written pop-rock. He was a very good song writer, but a mediocre guitarist and singer. He didn't even like being the "voice of a generation," so I doubt he would have taken it upon himself to destroy all these successful groups in the name of a generation. He didn't like being worshiped, so if he ever rose from the grave, I wouldn't expect him to like having thousands of fanboy apostles following him.|`|076b9d27ad5d5f819b3da4ba342506eaaa	No. If Cobain was around, Nirvana would be around.

I love it!|`|YcWGDKvkaa	OH YEAH!<br>  <br>  If Kurt was alive, he'd probably bite Kanye's head off for saying he's the "voice of the generation."<br>  <br>  He'd probably divorce Courtney<br>  <br>  He'd most likely think that guns and roses became 'sell-outs.'<br>  <br>  He'd most likely mispronounce Avril Lavigne's name.<br>  <br>  He'd probably would've written the best songs and teach today's crappy bands what REAL music is all about.|`|3LEPfzVhaa	Lol, I just read the question and KNEW it had something to do with the JoBros. <br>  I dunno, I think he could just generally give them a lesson in what real music is, then they'd go and get real jobs, safe in the knowledge they will NEVER be as cool and influencial as Kurt.|`|2c9e27b528ec302c442a3ff42014807daa	If Cobain was still alive today he'd be a shriveled-up old heroin junkie (once a heroin junkie, always a heroin junkie) incapable of biting anything!<br>  <br>  Frickin' Loser!|`|gJ8F634Haa	Enough with this now.

Which made me feel really awkward, especially if I needed to cough or something.<br>  <br>  Then again I've never been to a funeral for one of my own relatives dying, so I'm not sure what it feels like.|`|XjFxlcIlaa	Yes I've been to several, it's part of life. They are emotional and it's always a relief when they are over because after when you get together the tears slow down and you remember the good things about that person. Yes I have seen dead bodies, it really doesn't bother me, but some people can't do it. I guess you do what ever you can cope with. Some people want to say a last goodbye with the physical body of their lost one but for some it's too much.|`|DxltFeFVaa	i have been to 2 funerals in my life. i am 16.<br>  one was a long time ago and i don't really remember it but in november last year i went to a teacher from my school's.<br>  it was a closed casket and extremely sad. we sung his favorite hymns and listen to readings about him. although sad, it was one of the most beautiful and exhilarating things i have ever been to and made me feel extremely happy.|`|86rG6Jhyaa	It depends. I was very young when I went to my first funeral. it was aopen casket and of course i was a little scared. but as time went on and the more people I lost i grew numb to it.|`|AfPKkYaKaa	i think you need help<br>  <br>  i just read your other question that got deleted and you made me not hate girls and be scared of them<br>  <br>  ok maybe some of them scare me but you don't|`|l2xgzcRPaa	What's a funeral?|`|456d68efa2a1d62c7af67d47f76d8bf0aa	Yes.  I went to my best friend's funeral last July and was the hardest thing I ever had to do.  It is quite painful and makes you numb at the same time but also presents you with an opportunity to say goodbye.|`|mQgoqrC9aa	Yes I did just a week ago. I went to the body viewing and after I saw my great gram-pa dead I burst unto tears. :(|`|AA11445621	I have. It is a very sad thing. People are crying and everything. The priest talks and maybe a relative talks about the person. Then it depends if the person is buried on their funeral day. Then you go outside and you throw the flower(s) you've brought into the grave. Otherwise you put it/them on, or sometimes beside, the coffin. People are dressed in black, sometimes black and white. Those are the only colours "allowed" I guess grey is fine too.<br>  They make the bodies look... nicer(?) at the morgue, but before it depends on how you died. One thing's for sure though, dead bodie look horrible. I've seen them on pictures and stuff... Never seen one in real life.|`|UmIRYF6Jaa	Yes, too many.  Is there a purpose to this question or are you just curious.  They are not the best things in the world, probably the worst if it was someone very close to you.<br>  My first was when I was 11 it was a school friends, it was awful.|`|l5zWxw1Aaa	the ceremony they did for my uncle was beautiful, but it was so sad, i couldn't stop crying the whole time, we were so close and to lose him was so sad. he was only 37.|`|iBH7NTl3aa	Sad

l6EFHE8uaa	Wu-Tang with everyone together (especially with ODB) could whoop anyone's *** in a freestyle battle. Even with one or two guys (red and meth), they could take down damn near anyone. The guys have put out just assloads of freestyles that actually sounded really good. Plus, the pure insanity/genius would leave other rappers confused only knowing they got burned. Bad.|`|1Cznz2mkaa	you must be stupid.<br>  Wu-Tang son.<br>  Even the Wu's "weakest" member (U-God) would **** on wayne.<br>  <br>  Even though Public Enemy is one of the top 5 best hip hop groups, Chuck D doesn't freestlye all that much.|`|e1jG5fhLaa	Everyones in a group lol except Wayne..|`|jdSnYJtraa	lil wyane cuz hes the only one who can make music by emself|`|aJfBtT9iaa	wu tang|`|t395RWhGaa	Wu-Tang, Public Enemy has 3 MC's to work with. Eventually they'll run out of steam. Wu-Tang has 8. The same would apply to Insane Clown Posse and Lil Wayne if they had actual talent :/
cXngLI3Vaa	The example of the D chord so that the D is located all over the fretboard. As your question you can use the variation. I have seen so many times. As an example you can play GCD in the first position, or you can change it and use barre chords such as G and C barre chords at the 3d fret and use your D at the 5 the fret. it still will sound the same. THE PRIMARY is that all of the chords have scales in the different position. The scales in the position are the solos. The tabs are in the scales within the chords. If you know the D chord and you know the scales you automatically know the notes in a solo. I have seen people say that it doesn't matter, but they are wrong. I'm a guitarist in band in Nashville and I don't have the time to learn a new song(s). I use the chords and figure in the scales.|`|6Hj0h5BYaa	Most tab sheets are just "approximations" of how the song should be played. Unless you have actual sheet music and you can understand and follow the sheet music, it's hard to read what the EXACT chords are supposed to be. Tabs are more of a guideline so you can sort of get yourself in the right key and figure out the structure of the song. 99% of the time, you will still need to listen to the song to figure out the little details and try to mimic them on your guitar.<br>  <br>  As far as chord memorization, sometimes looking at those chord charts are a pain. Something I found helpful was looking on youtube for videos of people demonstrating different chords. I find it easier to watch what a person's fingers are doing and then do what he did.

SXwlw9N2aa	She must have gotten that way from the boarding school she was going to. It doesn't help either with the way that Victor keeps spoiling her with everything.|`|IsxB0Qi7aa	You're right, I think they are overdoing it a little with her character & now Victor is spoiling her rotten... It seemed like Victor was competing with Brad & trying to buy her love by buying her a champion Arabian horse.<br>  <br>  When Ashley's character went to work for Forrester Creations on the Bold & the Beautiful, Abby was living in London, so I'm just guessing that she went to a rich & snobby boarding school.|`|ow1m3c8jaa	Great question, she was so cute and sweet as a young girl, but since she came back, she's been nothing but a spoiled brat!<br>  I really don't understand what it is that is making her be that way either.<br>  Brad certainly was not like that and Ashley can be smug and stand offish sometimes, but even she's not nearly that bad and is finally telling Abby to knock it off when she sees her act that way.<br>  <br>  Victor is no help either by showering her with gifts (especially the million dollar horse) and treating her like she's some kind of queen or something.<br>  Someone needs to sit that little b*tch down and bring her down to her knees until she can get rid of that enormous chip on her shoulders!|`|rNzmTRueaa	Because she's a spoiled rotten little rich brat.  I don't like her character at all and her acting sucks.  When she showed up for Brad's will and made the statement about cotton mouth... it just didn't seem genuine.  There are other instances where her acting seemed off.  I can't put my finger on it, but there is something about that girl that I don't like.|`|r7sgshwKaa	I don't care for her behavior either but she is the only one who had the nerve to tell Eden off for that skating fiasco and for that I give her kudos.|`|yhQ3LT4haa	How old do you think she looks? She's playing a 14 year old ! She looks 16! She is a snob because she has been spoiled all by Victor and Brad. I'm 13 and she looks way older than me.|`|4kuWOZowaa	I really dont like abby at all|`|uUzbqGh5aa	In all the shows she's acted in: Malcolm in the Middle, Two and a half men and the King of Queens, her character has always been as she is now on the T&R. The only thing that makes her stand out here is because the "Abby" before was not like that and also because Victor keeps forking out the cash to keep her happy!|`|5f0111f71db8592710a5d1cb4897be4aaa	Apparently Abby learned Snobby 101 while overseas !!! <br>   I hate what they have done to the character !<br>  <br>   She acts like she's Billy's child rather than Ashley's .<br>   I cant imagine Victor allowing her to act this way,,,No Way would Nicholas or Victoria gotten away with this when they were her age .<br>  <br>   <> Shame on Victor and Ashley to let her behave like she's better than others <>

They're so funny together. I also like watching Maxie with anyone (especially Jason). :P|`|8xdcBKfUaa	Yes, you're absolutely correct. Especially on General Hospital; it's full of them. Winifred and Spinelli, Diane Miller, Max and Milo, of course. Sometimes even Carly makes me laugh a little. Especially when she's on the warpath or drunk. All characters on GH have their funny, shinning moments. And...Rex on OLTL, Opal and Amanda on AMC, Buzz and Frank on GL, Pam on B&B, Amber on Y&R, Carly and Craig on ATWT, and Nicole on Days. There are so many greats.|`|o5jSID4Jaa	Yes! Spinelli more than anybody else. Like someone else said Carly on her warpath can be quite entertaining too. To name a few others Max and Diane, Diane and Alexis, Anthony eventhough he's the "bad" guy could have some pretty funny moments at times.|`|5JgchYUEaa	david on oltl never disappoints. tuc watkins is hilarious. love him. spinelli on gh makes me laugh with his ramblings and you can't forget luke and tracy (spanky) lol.|`|IsxB0Qi7aa	Sometimes Henry & Vienna from As the World Turns with their silly role model playing games.

So I'm going to clean it and decorate it with help of my two best friends. I'm inviting 5 girls and 6 dudes. We are having a MASQUERADE BALL. The girls are dressing up for it but the dudes don't have too. Me and my two best friends are gathering all our favorite cd's and its a ball (dance). We are also cooking EVERYTHING cause we like to cook. The girls come 30 mins before the dudes so they we can help eachother with makeup and hair and stuff like that. It is 3 hours long and after 2 hours all the girls are going inside and getting into our pj's (its also a slumber party for the girls) and we will watch a movie. Then the dudes leave and the slumber party is also in the garage. I'm pulling out a queen matress and there is a tv and cd player in there so its all good.|`|q2AsDnjpaa	a normal one.

Have you ever asked yourself how good you'd have to be to go to heaven? The answer may surprise you—because the answer is this: You'd have to be perfect.<br>  <br>  The reason is because God is perfect and holy, and any sin is an offense to Him. In fact, God is so pure that even one sin would be enough to keep you out of heaven. The Bible says of Him, "Your eyes are too pure to look on evil; you cannot tolerate wrong" (Habakkuk 1:13). No one who is impure or sinful can enter His presence, and that's why the only way you could get to heaven on your own would be to be perfect.<br>  <br>  But that isn't the whole story! God loves us, and He doesn't want us to spend eternity separated from Him. That's why He has provided another way for us to be made pure and fit for heaven. That way is Jesus Christ, who came into the world for one reason: to cleanse us of all our sins. He was without sin, but on the cross all our sins were transferred to Him, and He died in our place. The Bible says, "The blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from all sin" (1 John 1:7).<br>  <br>  No, you can't be saved by your own good works. But God loves you, and Christ has provided the way for you to be saved. Turn to Him today and ask Him to take away your sins, and then commit your life to Him as your Lord and Savior. When you do, you too will be able to say that if you died tonight you know you'd go to heaven—not because you were good enough, but because of Christ. <br>  <br>  David<br>  believer_in_jesus37421@yahoo.com|`|gwjBvXTbaa	I am going to go potty, gosh darn it!

OvrcKRQzaa	Exactly.. the point is nt that its dark but the point is ppl start assuming anything which exists or doesnt exist... They are actually afraid of the fact that something unexpected might nt happen that gives birth to wat we call fear,...|`|1634875a2112f90de61c5b890983ed03aa	I suppose that's true.

YX4y4vCfaa	It's not so much about the brand. It's all about the model and your preferences. I like set necks. If you want a tremolo find one with a floyd rose. Active pickups are good to give a little more kick. The more you spend the better the metal will be on the frets and the last longer and the heavier the wood will be as well. I love my Gibson SG. My next guitar purchase is going to be the Ibanez Xiphos HX.|`|dc49d60c4d19a92e193ce2f41c92cfedaa	I like Deans but the Vendetta isn't my favorite for body style<br>  <br>  What type of sound are you trying to get out of it?|`|G4wDlSh7aa	greg bennet- ultramatic(UM-3)<br>  b/c it's the best out of those options, duhhhh.<br>  :)|`|3vwvLWrHaa	Your guitar is chosen by your genre' and your style of playing.<br>  Instead of names perhaps you should look at types and electronics.<br>  Strats use single coil pickups with usually a floating tremolo, while Gibson uses the double coil humbucker with a standard bridge/tailpiece.<br>  Most all other brands design their Instruments with these basic features as their core.|`|TxEu0R61aa	Dean<br>  <br>  I don't know why.<br>  All of my friends have them - and for the quality of play they are very cheap, and they are just amazing guitars [x<br>  <br>  I love them.<br>  <br>  And they are always in special deals too :)<br>  <br>  Just my opinion, but I'd definately go for the Dean :)<br>  <br>  Luu-Aleesh'<br>  xxx|`|2FIbamFgaa	Dean cause Deans are the ****.  <br>  <br>  Really you have to try it out to see what you think of it.|`|TI3U6IWnaa	My favorite is the fender stratocaster, but seeing as that isnt on your list i would have to say Ibanez the humbuckers sound great and if youve been playing for a while then it is perfect|`|kLK2peV1aa	HAMER<br>  beautiful sound for every style of music.<br>  I know tons of people who play them, I just wish I had the money for one.

In fact, a LOT of people are unhappy ... see why. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://community.abcfamily.go.com/watch/secret-life-american-teenager/aunt-ashley-mime-dad-sneak-peek" rel="nofollow">http://community.abcfamily.go.com/watch/...</a><br>  <br>  Anne schools Ashley on aunthood, and George gets very weird. <br>  <br>  After all her talk about keeping the baby, you'd think Ashley would be more excited about being an aunt. But looks like she didn't get an invitation to the shower, so she's got an attitude. Speaking of attitude, what is George doing? Love the expression on Anne's face. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://community.abcfamily.go.com/watch/secret-life-american-teenager/adrian-vs-ricky-sneak-peek" rel="nofollow">http://community.abcfamily.go.com/watch/...</a><br>  <br>  Ricky disinvites his foster mom to the shower by accident. <br>  <br>  Doing her last-minute best to arrange Amy's shower, Adrian calls Ricky to see if he wants to invite anyone in his foster family to the event. But that's not what he's looking for. And then his foster mom shows up. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://community.abcfamily.go.com/watch/secret-life-american-teenager/adrian-sees-through-grace-sneak-peek" rel="nofollow">http://community.abcfamily.go.com/watch/...</a><br>  <br>  Why does Grace look so happy? And where'd all the balloons go? <br>  <br>  Hey, what's up with Grace? She looks kind of happy/guilty/amazed. Who was she blowing up balloons with?

Ow3O7h4caa	Aquarius people are often involved in bi-sexual activities generally. Mercury afflicting Uranus and the Moon strongly affect the mind.<br>  Saturn ruling the 5th house placed close to the midheaven, and in a mental and masculine sign is another pointer to the nature of the sex outlook.<br>  Neptune in the 7th adds to the mental and emotional chaos and also indicates dissatisfaction with marriage.<br>  <br>  So there are a few consideration to take into account and Mars in Aquarius alone, is not enough. The tendencies can be indicated but it doesn't mean that the person will go through with it.|`|AA11899483	i agree with some of the people above, theres more to a person than a couple of planets or a few signs. you have the asteroids, house placements, aspects everything. there is a whoooolle lot more to it. i have a mars in gemini, but im not bi-sexual, i know a few mars in aquarius people and theyre not bi-sexual either. what indicates bi/homo-sexuality is still a mystery.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	Because they tend to be open-minded and ready to try anything once. <br>  <br>  I have a friend with Mars/Venus in Aquarius and she's definitely not the adventurous type. She's straight, too. She also goes for boring guys, which is something I would not expect from Mars/Venus in Aquarius. But she also has Pisces sun, Scorpio moon, Cancer rising.|`|LrKCLZF7aa	From the study that I have conducted so far the signs have nothing to do with sexuality. But it sounds like it might be right. So does the Gemini theory. There are many planetary positions that don't even include signs so what do you do when you find a homosexual person with no aspects in longitude? That's where the signs are. You have to start reading the whole chart and that means including declinations and heliocentric.|`|32P3hG0Laa	It is too limited to merely look at Mars in Gemini... you have to look at the entire chart... all the planets, the houses, the aspects...<br>  <br>  Pulling out one detail reveals very little...|`|VHxZuaOfaa	no they are the type to be more freaky in bed a Mars in Gemini is more likely But Aqua Mar ill make sure the person is clean and will use protection|`|y6wikiJDaa	Mars is sexual expression. Aquarius is rebellious. That includes social norms, expectations, and gender roles of all kinds. Put them together. Mars in Gemini are also inclined to bisexuality. Gemini being of dual nature, curious, and able to see either side. All the mutable signs tend to bisexuality, but Gemini is more dual than most in the sense that a monosexual Gemini is almost a contradiction in terms.|`|531f08d2bae7afb19dbace61520eb62caa	How? Just blindly believe.<br>  <br>  No one has control over when they are born. This makes astrology a bigoted concept. Similar to sexism and racism. Take away astrology's natural stereotyping and bigotry, then you won't have astrology.<br>  <br>  If it's not science, it's superstition.|`|7rrNvFK7aa	oh yes. mars in aquarius often gives gays and bi-sexual and lesbians. That 's cool. These person are often more sensitive and very smart people. Don't underestimate or knock them. They are humans like other people/|`|bvwYVGJOaa	I have Mars in Capricorn..?<br>  <br>  But yeah i think Gemini can be bisexual or bi curious...

And honestly, the disterbia one wasn't to great, but this one really changed my mind....i take a lot of it back! Maybe disterbia wasn't a good song choice for her. But softer more serious songs are better i think. Still a little flat a some points, but hey.

omEC1DWcaa	They are a good starting point. Think back to your first anime. It probably wasn't Paranoia Agent or something. Series like Bleach/Naruto/Inuyasha even are the animes that get people into anime. And once they watch one of these, they look for other anime to watch and discover the rest of the stuff that's better. These are like intro animes with training wheels, and then people take the training wheels off and see other stuff. Since they have pretty mainstream ideas, people can use them as a starting point.|`|O8JkQEHQaa	it is probably because they are worth watching. before asking this question, did you try to watch any of the two shows for at least few episodes, until it gets to the good part? bleach and naruto are two shows with over 200 episodes which are really worth watching and you hardly get bored  (ex: fillers=really boring manga sequel=very interesting) also bleach and naruto got unlimited count of twists and characters that will entertain you in their own way, not like a 12 episode anime that "WILL" entertain you but for only a short period of time. also both plots are stunning and once you will start watching it, you will get addicted as I am, so just have a go and try to watch at least 20 ep from each anime and if you don't really like it, the next time you ask for a manga, just say you don't want naruto and bleach ;)|`|RvHZOKp6aa	there just very popular plus compared to other anime on adult swim it comes on fairly early so u can watch it without being tired<br>  <br>       ps: if u can watch code geass but its almost the end of the season so if i were you go to FYE and buy Code Geass epi. 1-5  and it has tons of extra features i love it ^.^|`|OyoJL5YAaa	'cause they're the best.|`|neqPUsy8aa	cuz everyoen knows bleach and naruto..peeps can recognize tha charactrs|`|yKWPdilQaa	They're as popular as DBZ.|`|BpYjNdEzaa	Alright because it's mainstream anime and they are the top anime and manga because it's on tv that's the reason why. it's the only anime they really know.<br>  <br>  alot of people get bored watching Naruto and bleach because they take so long. Naruto is so far behide in the manga and they take one chapter and spam it over 3 episodes which in the end ruins the anime.<br>  <br>  there is much better anime out there then Naruto and Bleach.|`|WXi033Kxaa	Ugh. I hate both the shows. I get a little tired of the fangirls/fanboys.<br>  <br>  I really don't see what's "absorbing" about them either. Mainly Naruto. The show is terrible in my opinion. I feel dumber for watching a few episodes when I was younger.<br>  <br>  It cracks me up that they're considered the "top animes." I think that means America just isn't getting as much as we should be. lol <br>  <br>  Then again...they're somewhat tops in Japan too. Yuck.<br>  <br>  Could be some people are too absorbed to branch out and realize there are better ones. Zombies.|`|okJuemOUaa	It's probaly just because Bleach and Naruto are among the top manga and animes|`|tSU1BmGtaa	Because their both like the best manga ever!

akcGfgdcaa	He definitely did, though Tim isn't the only one to blame although he is the one who makes the final decision on what the writers come up with. <br>  <br>  Season 1 of Heroes was amazing, but everything went downhill during Season 2, it was easy for them then to blame it all on the scriptwriters strike but the truth was it was bad writing, and that continued during the fast half of Season 3. The characters were written badly, the story had so many inconsistencies, the whole catalyst aspect was boring, the explanation of people's powers was just silly and confusing.<br>  <br>  I'm glad Bryan Fuller has returned to the show, the interview he had seemed to be spot on about what was wrong with the show. He said that the first 3 episodes of the Fugitives chapter would be decent, then it would dip, and then get better from chapter 19. So far what he's said has been true, and hopefully he will be able to save the show and get it like it was during Season 1.<br>  <br>  And no-one should have to learn from Russell T Davies; Dr.Who is such a cheap show.|`|a231cd46589d3ea6efabcc68cdd6e69baa	Yes.  But Bryan Fuller's return has me hopeful.  If he turns the show around in season 4, NBC may hand control to him.|`|bM05KZnNaa	yeah he has gone a little over the top i like the first 2 series but after that it went downhill in my opinion|`|52pZj3WFaa	Yeah...the only thread I'm interested in now is Silas. But I'm kind of hoping that he finds the others and they become a vigilant group and kick Nathans @rse.<br>  <br>  But all in all, I'm not thrilled by it at all. And the bird who plays Claire seems to be reading all her lines through clenched teeth.|`|BTT1zgIqaa	Definitely.<br>  Plots were always a bit hard to follow, although Heroes Unmasked follow on programme did help explain a bit, but this new series is just impossible to follow.|`|4BJp6pFiaa	Definitely!<br>  Just consider the fact that he has added turtles and not armadillos to the script shows that he has lost it...

He is just one big ego problem, and he acts the same in just about every movie.<br>  DeNiro is still a good actor, but in Righteous Kill he is stretching a bit, and too old to be playing a action (semi action) role.<br>  So, I prefer DeNiro in his older, last 10, years.|`|oIIiMY5Zaa	Probably|`|6m6LjAVNaa	I have always liked them both! Jack is just Jack that doesn't change but he is human like the rest of us,as we age and approach our own deaths we become changed, a little softer perhaps,kinder because we know all those things we had thought were so important or just things after all and not so important at all really.<br>  God should be number 1 in our lives and to him be the glory not some big to do over ones day job of acting no matter how good or bad that might be,we are all Gods children and life is secondary to that!Realizing that we all are on the same path,and it changes us as people which is good we all need to be humbled and to know our God and that all people matter and to care for them,just my opinion.<br>  I think these men have learned these lessons and that is why they are now different.<br>  I wish them both only good things!

Its gained a substantial amount of popularity in the past few years, and like hair metal 20 years ago, its going to die soon.

Kind of like an early 90's alt. rock revival.|`|d02c709e184c7a1f7828d9e3e00c32b4aa	Considering that the Emo craze is on its last legs, it wouldn't be reasonable to expect an offshoot to get any bigger than it currently is.  <br>  <br>  No, I don't like it.

Ow3O7h4caa	Sagittarius in your 10th gives a desire for knowledge and for teaching it and applying it practically in life. The point of view is that of the practical philosopher who is always ready to learn.<br>  <br>  This brings a good trait inthe personality as you tend to create your opportunities with a constant focus on them You need to be challenged and you are not very good with routine and not particularly money motivated, but is ambitious. Typical career routes include the legal profession, outdoor sports, veterinary profession, travel industry, export industry, university lecturer, town planning, space industry, airline industry, the church. Profession could be law, religion, or higher education, publishing.<br>  <br>  Jupiter rules your 10th house and denotes success in all matters over which you preside, so that your occupation will be to your taste, and likely to bring you joy and happiness. There are many pursuits that you may follow to advantage from a judge to a merchant, according to your abilities, but so far as trade is concerned you will do well in businesses that clothe and supply the general public with provisions, etc…<br>  Another trait that Sagittarius brings is optimism but you may not look at the ground beneath your feet. Concentrating on the world of possibilities, one neglects to integrate what has already been acuieved, therefore, one cannot built storng foundations.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	The native is fortunate in life and receives a degree of distinction and fame, which brings profit and honors. A good deal of travel is likely to be associated with the native's career.

dMBSE8ilaa	I liked the episode, the lady teaching the children to sing that song was creepy!<br>  <br>  It was sad that Sam told Melinda she needed help. I wonder what that Doctor is going to do...<br>  <br>  Next week looks good! I wonder if Jim will come back, seeing how Melinda called him Sam , and he's lie who's Sam? The thing is, even if he does come back, he will have a different face to everyone else. I wish they hadn't killed him off in the first place.|`|fHgbL046aa	I am freaking out. Melinda tells Sam/Jim to leave and she was left crying in the house. What is that ghost gonna do? He is going to cause problems, he's so evil. I knew Sam/Jim would not be able to accept Melinda gift. I would like know were the show is heading instead of having to wait ever week.|`|MJvL013yaa	Yes! I really can't imagine the show without him. He is a perfect compliment to Melinda.|`|DcYD9vWRaa	was o-k to me|`|EnYLhQajaa	I'm sorry, but that is the dumbest show I have ever seen.
ow1m3c8jaa	Just ignore that rude first answer above me, apparently they have nothing better to do than pick on us soap lovers, and they say people who watch soaps need to get a life, hmmm!<br>  <br>  I so agree about Brad, there must have been some way they could have kept him on the show.<br>  Why didn't they just eliminate some of the actors that just bring the show down with their totally idiotic, juvenile, or boring characters (Rodger, Abby, Jeffrey, etc.) instead?<br>  <br>  Certainly after all the years Don D. gave to the show he deserved to be treated better than being let go so they could replace him with characters that do anything but add class and excitement to the show!|`|jX7v8Ebbaa	I sure wish Abby got killed off instead. I can't stand that little snooty stuck-up biatch. Then that would have given Brad a story line too. Sharon might have felt bad for him and fallen in love with him too. ow that is a good s/l!|`|eff556e68b639b40e89cc7516013482faa	Spoilers say that Don Diamont is going to B&B anyway, but not as Brad Carlton.|`|AA11369432	He chose to leave the show.|`|IsxB0Qi7aa	It's kind of funny if you think about it, since the people in Y&R know the people in B&B & now Brad is going to be on B&B, so if Ashley goes to visit Forrester Creations is she going to think he looks like Brad's twin? I guess we are just supposed to believe that he looks like his new character. I would have preferred they kept his character alive so he could go back & forth like other character's have, but I don't think he is ever coming back, though with soaps you never know...
bsnnEsp5aa	Monster in m opinion is hugely underrated. <br>  Correct me if you think I'm wrong, but I much prefer it too Death Note, infact I feel there is little comparison, because Monster delves much more deeply into the human psyche and you get a real test for your own sense of right and wrong. Though Death Note attempts this, it is no where near as real and gripping in my honest opinion. I felt much more in touch with the characters in Monster than I did with Light, L or Near.<br>  <br>  I think Dr. Tenma is an excellent protagonist, by the end of the series you understand him completely and the plot around him develops consistantly while himself as a character develops with the story. Often I see character development being weak in most anime/manga's but I think in the case of Monster it is done absolute justice.<br>  <br>  Hope you enjoy the rest of the series ^_^|`|4b04c75387288f794c445a45826af7b1aa	Wow I loved Monster, I read the manga and then watched the anime, it's awesome and really unique, I love the drama, mystery and suspense. <br>  I think Dr.Tenma was really cool and how he still stayed strong after how many things went wrong and twisted, how he went from surgeon to a sort of detective on the run. Out of the whole anime he was the only person that was open minded and unprejudiced, and super intelligent, shows how horrible people in the world can really be Dx. Johan was awesome too :D

May herald the birth of a child.|`|qXvFsnOcaa	Mostly, you can't. There is an upper limit on your abilities that comes from your genes and there isn't much that you can do about it. It's like if you have a two cylinder motorbike you can rev it all you like, but it will never become a 4 cylinder. You could try using crystals to focus what energy you have, and do concentration exercises, to help you with your mind reading, but I don't think that it will make much of a difference. At least not unless you are doing it completely wrong at the moment, in which case learning to do it right will help somewhat. Forget about reading individual thoughts and memories. They are usually too complex and to person specific (they are very contextual). Instead try reading emotions and the thoughts at the back of a persons mind. They will give you a good idea of what a person thinks or feels about something, which is more useful than a lot of scrambled images without context about what they are thinking at the exact moment in time.<br>  <br>  You should also forget about seeing into th future. Only prophets can do that and there haven't been any prophets for hundreds of years. They are probably not something that we will see again. The modern world can't cope with them or their revelations.<br>  <br>  What you see in your dreams are probably just regular dreams. There is no mechanism in the human body for seeing the future, it's just not possible as it has not yet happened. Prophets are given visions of the future, they come from outside of them. There is no part of the body that generates these visions and most prophet were genetically regular people.<br>  <br>  I usually post this kind of question under folklore. It's where the Wika and the new agers hang out.|`|ztzEloj5aa	about your dreams- keep a notebook by your bed and as *soon as* you wake up write the stuff down that you remember- I started doing this a year ago- its crazy how you can write something down like a word or phrase and come back to it an hour later and not remember anything about the dream- or having the dream -  but you wrote it down<br>  once you start to practice this you can look up the meanings of your dreams|`|7rrNvFK7aa	do some meditation.

Then you run and collect the piece of paper, at which point, you will be arrested.  They will convict you of assault, and will put you in jail.  Before the hearing, however, you sell the piece of paper you threw at her on ebay for 1,500,999,432 dollars.  Some Rhianna obsesee would buy it. Trust me.  So when you go to jail, you bribe the jail man with half of it and he'll let you out.  Then you find Rhianna again and buy the umbrella for the amount of money you have left.

I'm not Fred Flintstone, but I can make your bedrock!   <br>  I lost my teddy bear, will you sleep with me?   <br>  A boy gives a girl 12 roses. 11 fake, 1 real and he says to her " I will stop loving you when all the roses die"  <br>  See my friend over there?

n3pSWkg0aa	ya of course they are, no guy wastes that much time on their hair, and do you see how tight their pants are?<br>  and i agree with the first post, miley is a man XD<br>  and purity rings? no comment, good to not be a wh*re young but they flaunt it everywhere, same with nicks diabetic, its not that big of a deal<br>  <br>  example:<br>  <br>  at the kids choice awards<br>  joe: thank you for the award, we are grateful<br>  kevin: btw have you seen our purity rings?<br>  nick: I have diabetes :D give to my charity, because *sniffle*sniffle* my life is so hard with it *tear*<br>  joe: yes give to our charity and buy our *crappy* albums so we can be richer|`|1UOIoOzKaa	Yes, they are gay together ;)|`|D2WLPK0gaa	Nope.|`|GilxwZ2Haa	*sigh*<br>  They are straight. And what they wear does not change that, they just have different styles than most guys. What's wrong with being unique? Why do guys have to be abercrombie and fitch clones all the time? (I am saying this to some of the other comments). <br>  They are straight, they are all currently in relationships. (except for Nick, who just ended one) <br>  <br>  So no, they are not gay. And it pisses me off when people assume that. Even if they were, there's nothing wrong with it.|`|EfxExqrkaa	No they r not gay they r just fags|`|SvzsXddUaa	Yeeeep and their music is too.<br>  <br>  ...You just figured it out now? :p|`|933e4a28cf2ed1dee09acc2b64ac1674aa	no <br>  but i think you are <br>  for asking this dumb question|`|qxdUzCCDaa	NO!<br>  I agree with party in my bedroom <3 your just TRYING TO GET ATTENTION !<br>  The Jonas Brothers are not gay,just because you think they are doesn't mean they are.<br>  <br>  Joe is dating Camilla Belle<br>  Nick is was dating Selena Gomez (now he's single:)<br>  And Kevin has a Girlfriend (don't know her name)<br>  <br>  I love the jonas brothers, all of them.<br>  <br>  Their clothes suit them they have nice songs <br>  <br>  AND they have nothing against you so stop going around calling them gay! <br>  <br>  YOU CAN'T GO AROUND CALLING PEOPLE GAY <br>  IT'S INSANE. <br>  AND CHEAP|`|oQrIn41zaa	nope, they're okay, I like their music, not too special, Joe is quite fit, Nick had diabetes and Kevin is cool.<br>  They're not gay, as in sexual orientation, they're all straight, Nick dated Miley Cyrus for 2 years, they split in early 07, then Selena Gomez  dunno where he's at now, I think he's still with Selena, not sure...<br>  Joe dated AJ (Amanda Joy) Michalka in 06, then Taylor Swift in 08, dumped her at the end of the year, Taylor wrote Forever & Always (wel, co-wrote it) about Joe, and I dunno who he's with atm...maybe single, if we are lucky...lol<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope that answered your question! <br>  <br>  <br>  [x]|`|ehrzYOPHaa	wow.<br>  u are just looking for attention, because you know everybody here hates the jonas brothers.<br>  <br>  fact 1.<br>  there tight clothes are smexy<br>  fact 2.<br>  they are NOT GAY!<br>  fact3.<br>  kevin has a GIRL freind|`|hgEHJhAqaa	Of Course they are gay...did u see how tight their clothes are? <br>  like youve got to be kidding me...how do they get their dang pants on?<br>  Hope i helped!<br>  Coco Malloy|`|Io7x29vhaa	Joe walks gay !<br>  but he's so hott !|`|aJB1OPoFaa	I do think kevin is..|`|9298mlxoaa	I think they are bi.|`|lb1pPyTcaa	yes. nick went out wit miley and miley= man|`|d6a68669a02108d3c2a56807e8eb2423aa	NOOO!?!<br>  don't call my boo's gayy<br>  they just have a different clothing style, but nothing serious like being gay...<br>  they like having a good time on stage, but til this day idk how they do splits during performance w/o splitting their pants. They must have like 'anti-split' pants. lol|`|uRnndgCraa	Nick stated in an interview he's bisexual|`|ROtdc8fyaa	no!!
vZDUwF0Naa	he forced her to have sex. and she said yes bc if she didnt jamal would have died. salim felt powerfully now hes somecody nt just a slumdog, he was a gangster and had power and was going to take advantage of that! slumdog millionare is the best movie i have eevr seen. i feel so sorry for those children having to go back to where they live :( its teasing them alittle bit really :S. love everything about the movie especially the music in it its fab:) its sad to see that that is what really happens out there :( and alot of people dnt realize how lucky they are x|`|i6Th0lItaa	I thought it was because Salim anted to be alone with Latika.|`|Klb4ZYcVaa	Well, after he pointed the gun at a couple of gangs, he officially works for the toughest ganster in the whole India. Now it's his job to make money, & since latika was a professional dancer/prostitute at a young age, she wanted her for business. He believes Jamal is interfering & will only get in the way, so he sends him off.<br>  <br>  I highly doubt Salim wanted to "get it on" with Latika, they were kids. It was all business.|`|b42dde3b8bf259a89160959c1849c2b0aa	Salim wanted to get it on with Latika, and would of killed Jamel for it. He wanted to remind Jamal that he was still in charge.<br>  Latika didn't want Salim to kill Jamal so she stayed with him. Why she didn't leave after, or why Jamal didn't come back is another question

AA10750459	hehe. good one. my fav was when he thought he was Beyonce. have a star. try these:<br>  <br>  1<br>  <br>  Fresh from her shower, a woman stands in front of the mirror complaining to her husband that her breasts are too small.<br>  <br>  Instead of characteristically telling her it's not so, the husband uncharacteristically comes up with a suggestion. "If you want your breasts to grow, then every day take a piece of toilet paper and rub it between your breasts for a few seconds."<br>  <br>  Willing to try anything, the wife fetches a piece of toilet paper and stands in front of the mirror, rubbing it between her breasts.<br>  <br>  "How long will this take?" she asks.<br>  <br>  "They'll grow larger over a period of years," he replies.<br>  <br>  The wife stops. "Why do you think rubbing a piece of toilet paper between my breasts everyday will make my breasts grow over the years?"<br>  <br>  "Worked for your butt, didn't it?"<br>  <br>  He lived. And with a great deal of therapy, may even walk again..<br>  <br>  <br>  2<br>  <br>  Man driving down road.<br>  Woman driving up same road<br>  They pass each other<br>  Woman yells out her window, "PIG!"<br>  Man yells out his window, "*********!"<br>  Man rounds next curve<br>  Crashes into a huge pig in middle of road.<br>  <br>  Thought For The Day : If only men would listen.<br>  <br>  <br>  3<br>  <br>  The mother-in-law stopped unexpectedly by the recently married couple's<br>  house. She rang the doorbell and stepped into the house. She saw her<br>  daughter-in-law standing naked by the door.<br>  <br>  "What are you doing?" she asked.<br>  <br>  "I'm waiting for my husband to come home from work," the<br>  daughter-in-law<br>  answered.<br>  <br>  "But you're naked!" the mother-in-law exclaimed.<br>  <br>  "This is my love dress," the daughter-in-law explained.<br>  <br>  "Love dress? But you're naked!"<br>  <br>  "My husband loves me to wear this dress! It makes him happy and it<br>  makes me<br>  happy. I would appreciate it if you would leave because he will be home<br>  from<br>  work any minute."<br>  <br>  The mother-in-law was tired of all this romantic talk and left. On the<br>  way<br>  home she thought about the love dress. When she got home she undressed,<br>  showered, put on her best perfume and waited by the front door. Finally<br>  her<br>  husband came home. He walked in and saw her standing naked by the door.<br>  <br>  "What are you doing?" he asked.<br>  <br>  "This is my love dress" she replied.<br>  <br>  "Needs ironing." he said.<br>  <br>  HEHE>>HAVE FUN 2 YA GUYZ READING|`|5TNDDsFzaa	ha ha ha funny thank you.|`|pmi7Z0R4aa	i don't get it|`|SOxdyWQOaa	lol|`|VSfiigz3aa	*  I liked the part about the geisha.|`|POqwp3Fiaa	Very cleverly thought out, and a little bit funny, nice one...!|`|TjWA37kuaa	LOL|`|cMZEmpp0aa	Good god no.

IsxB0Qi7aa	I agree, I'm starting to HATE Nick more & more! He's always reassuring Phyllis how he wants it to work & then while they were making out, he said " That's It, Never Again" & just because Sharon overhears he goes to her room to reassure her that he didn't mean what he said to Phyllis. Then in the previews for next week it shows him & Phyllis in a hot & steamy sex scene, I'm like WTF?!  I used to like him, but he's acting like a dog in heat!!! <br>  <br>  With Mrs. C first she's in a car crash, now the bombing, when will she get a break?! I know she can't be dead, so maybe the incident helped her get her memory back, at least I hope so... I want everyone to believe she is alive already & stop thinking she is Marge.<br>  <br>  I feel so bad for Kevin, now he's reliving the worst thing that ever happened to him, if Clint was so concerned about not having any witnesses why didn't he just leave Kevin in the room with Mrs. C & Esther so he could blow up, too?|`|ow1m3c8jaa	Nick sure is a moron, just who does he think he is treating both Sharon & Phyllis like a piece of meat?<br>  I can't wait for Phyllis to catch him with Sharon red handed, there will be h*ll for him to pay then.<br>  Phyllis had better make him grovel big time if she is willing to forgive him after a stunt like that!<br>  At this point she should just let him go back to his precious Sharon because he sure isn't worth the anymore than a piece of dirt!<br>  <br>  If it were me, I would kick him to the curb with all his stuff in a used garbage bag and take him for all the Newman money I could get!<br>  <br>  I doubt Katherine is dead, they wouldn't have dragged on her story line so long if they were just going to kill her off, besides they know they would have a war on their hands with the fans if they let Jeanne Cooper go.<br>  <br>  Poor Kevin, I read in the TV Guide that this will make him go back to his dark side and Clint will talk him into robbing banks.|`|nrqWwQBXaa	i think nick and Sharon have mental issues. poor Philis i really like her. it is so dumb what nick is doing to her. yes that was so sad what was happening to Kevin it made me cry to i could not even watch the whole thing?|`|5f0111f71db8592710a5d1cb4897be4aaa	<> Nick has became as Nasty as Sharon !!!!!!<br>  <br>   Don't  be sad,,,Kathryn didn't die<br>  <br>   and yes,,,it was sad to see poor Kevin have to relive his childhood.( but you wont believe what's going to happen )|`|qWzN3i3Uaa	I know this is a little harsh but i hope Nick catches some kind of STD. I mean, its the only way all of these guys will stop sleeping with Sharon. She is such a ****. She just got done having sex with Billy the night before then she goes and makes out with nick. Someone needs to put her on a leash. She is out of control. I don't think Katherine will bet blown up. And Kevin in the trunk was so sad , it made me cry too|`|Jy9KORHDaa	It almost seems like he is so turned on by Sharon that he goes back to Phyllis and screws her to forget about Sharon, but I think Sharon will be pregnant because she is screwing the hell out of Nick and Billy, did you notice Billy leaving her room the other morning when Chloe couldn't get in touch with him?|`|kWFgNO2Qaa	I was feeling bad for Kevin. He's so hot. I think Phylis has no right to get mad at Sharon for being close to Nick. Has she forgotten that she was sleeping with Nick while he was married to Sharon. I they both need to dump Nick. I don't think she's dead.|`|5JgchYUEaa	omg! wth? nick and phyllis are going at it like horny teenagers and then he leaves to reassure sharon and they are practically ripping each other's clothes off and then he goes right back and is banging phyllis. did he take one of victor's little blue pills or something???!!!|`|mXQYbFiiaa	Nick's a man whore.

2eXbueHkaa	twenty, <br>  <br>  cox you are counting the same cows both ways?|`|EmUMa0f8aa	ok This can be answered several ways depending on the way it is worded. For example by adding a comma in the first part after cows, going to school then you are saying you were going to school and counted 20 cows but the way you have used it you are saying the cows were going to school and we know cows don't normally go to school (or church either) that we know of unless they have their own school under the shade tree at noon. You could say 40 cows because you used the word THEN meaning that you counted 20 cows THEN you counted 20 more cows. I could also say you have counted no cows because cows don"t go to our schools and they don't have a home. 0,20,or 40 depending on the way you look at it|`|5TNDDsFzaa	depends: <br>  20 cows they could of just come out of school and went home,<br>  40 cows all together or cows don't go school|`|39wcLSoPaa	20|`|wV3Fs9Ebaa	20|`|POqwp3Fiaa	20, because cows don't go to school, but they do go home...?

FHQZz8dNaa	You could look at the obvious: She wants to be herself, she doesn't want to sink to the HOLLYWOOD scene. She is human and wants to do what she wants to do. NOT what the music industry and hollywood want and expect of her to do. Instead of getting caught partying next to Paris Hilton on the front of PEOPLE magazine, she wants to hang alone sometimes, caught in even the most WHAT NOT TO WEAR OUTFIT stuffing her face with fatty foods.<br>  Look at it through my view: similar message but the industry is the Machine, everyone in Hollywood is that robotic, programmed personality, partying, hanging with a LOT OF FRIENDS, on starving diets, fake smiles, etc. They all live in their own world of PERFECT. Where everyone is expected to act like each other. She is trying to break away from this world, even though she has to sort of live in it, cuz she is famous, she is not following everyone else. She is escaping their little la la land.<br>  :)<br>  Great Question|`|qgE8E70Qaa	I guess what she means is that Hollywood is like a machine that makes copies of people, but Demi Lovato is saying that even though she's a star in Hollywood, she doesn't want to change.|`|2DAfAjv2aa	I thought it was just her trying to get her point across that she isn't just another Hollywood singer. Despite all the fame that comes her way, she still remains herself.

1wNsBNmxaa	On the night of September 7, 1996, Shakur attended the Mike Tyson - Bruce Seldon boxing match at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. After leaving the match, one of Suge's associates spotted 21 year-old Orlando "Baby Lane" Anderson, a member of the Southside Crips, in the MGM Grand lobby and informed Shakur. Shakur then attacked Anderson. Shakur's entourage, as well as Suge and his followers assisted in assaulting Anderson. The fight was captured on the hotel's video surveillance. A few weeks earlier, Anderson and a group of Crips had robbed a member of Death Row's entourage in a Foot Locker store, precipitating Shakur's attack. After the brawl, Shakur went to rendezvous with Suge to go to Death Row-owned Club 662 (now known as restaurant/club Seven). He rode in Suge's 1996 black BMW 750iL sedan as part of a larger convoy including many in Shakur's entourage.<br>  <br>  At 10:55 p.m., while paused at a red light, Shakur rolled down his window and a photographer took his photograph. At around 11:00-11:05 p.m., they were halted on Las Vegas Blvd. by Metro bicycle cops for playing the car stereo too loud and not having license plates. The plates were then found in the trunk of Suge's car; they were released without being fined a few minutes later. At about 11:10 p.m., while stopped at a red light at Flamingo Road near the intersection of Koval Lane in front of the Maxim Hotel, a vehicle occupied by two women pulled up on their right side. Shakur, who was standing up through the sunroof, exchanged words with the two women, and invited them to go to Club 662. At approximately 11:15 p.m., a white, four-door, late-model Cadillac with an unknown number of occupants pulled up to the sedan's right side, rolled down one of the windows, and rapidly fired twelve to thirteen shots at Shakur. He was struck by four rounds, with bullets hitting him in the chest, the pelvis, and his right hand and thigh. One of the rounds apparently ricocheted into Shakur's right lung. Suge was hit in the head by shrapnel, though it is thought that a bullet grazed him.

The bodyguard, Frank Alexander, stated that when he was about to ride along with the rapper in Suge's car, Shakur asked him to drive Kidada Jones' car instead just in case they were too drunk and needed additional vehicles from Club 662 back to the hotel. Shortly after the assault, the bodyguard reported in his documentary, Before I Wake, that one of the convoy's cars drove off after the assailant but he never heard back from the occupants.<br>  <br>  After arriving on the scene, police and paramedics took Suge and a fatally wounded Shakur to the University Medical Center. According to an interview with one of Shakur's closest friends the music video director Gobi, while at the hospital, he received news from a Death Row marketing employee that the shooters had called the record label and were sending death threats aimed at Shakur, claiming that they were going there to "finish him off".[48] Upon hearing this, Gobi immediately alerted the Las Vegas police, but the police claimed they were understaffed and no one could be sent.[48] Nonetheless, the shooters never arrived.[48] At the hospital, Shakur was in and out of consciousness, was heavily sedated, was breathing through a ventilator and respirator, was placed on life support machines, and was ultimately put under a barbiturate-induced coma after repeatedly trying to get out of the bed.[49][48][6]<br>  <br>  Despite having been resuscitated in a trauma center and surviving a multitude of surgeries (as well as the removal of a failed right lung), Shakur had gotten through the critical phase of the medical therapy and was given a 50% chance of pulling through.[45] Gobi left the medical center after being informed that Shakur made a 13% recovery on the sixth night.[48] While in Critical Care Unit on the afternoon of September 13, 1996, Shakur died of internal bleeding; doctors attempted to revive him but could not impede his hemorrhaging.[49][6] His mother, Afeni, made the decision to tell the doctors to stop.[49][45] He was pronounced dead at 4:03 p.m. (PDT)[6] The official cause of death was noted as respiratory failure and cardiopulmonary arrest in connection with multiple gunshot wounds.[6] Shakur's body was cremated.[50] Some of his ashes were later mixed with marijuana and smoked by members of Outlawz.[51]<br>  <br>  <br>  Murder case<br>   This section needs additional citations for verification.

022a70c3422f4e77c8a63e672f7c2b18aa	Nothing spectacular in this group of comics you posted - even if they were Mint, I doubt anyone would give you more than $20-25 dollars for them. A store will give you even less (<$5, probably). Reasons?<br>  <br>  1) No standout issues here; nothing to make them worth more. Simply being a few years old doesn't mean anything.<br>  <br>  2) The economy is going to make buying comics a real disaster for a while, and back issues always suffer the most for this.

It's the sign on its cusp that colors the activities of that house. <br>  Ex..<br>  Aries in the 6th house, the affairs of that house wouldbe conducted with Aries energy.<br>  <br>  The Planets are colored by the quality of the sign it is in. Their energy is tinted with the attributes of the sign it is in and expressed in that fashion and in the area (the house) it is in as well as the house it rules by sign. <br>  The quality of this energy will be good or bad, positive or negative according to the aspects.<br>  <br>  To answer your question, the Planet is most important but, it needs the sign to express the type of energy according to the sign.<br>  The house is worthless if their is no sign on it. Thus, the sign colors the activities of the hose it is in.<br>  <br>  In a nutshell.....<br>  Planets show 'What is going on – What you want. Planets create the drive.'<br>  Signs indicates 'How it occurs – How you go about getting what you want.'<br>  House show  'Where the activity is taking place' <br>  Aspects indicate 'The quality of the energy, use or abuse, with which you seek what you want.'|`|32P3hG0Laa	Planets planets planets... that's where it all starts.<br>  Planets are IN signs, not the other way around.<br>  Planets are in houses.<br>  Houses have signs.<br>  <br>  Honestly, I could do an accurate reading if all I had available were the planets, and the degrees of the signs they are in. Houses are, in my experience, icing on the cake in a reading. I get 80% of my reading from planets, signs and aspects.

It is the house of the soul's transformation. If you flow with that twelfth house, it can be a great source for tapping a reservoir of information, knowledge and past life contact.<br>   The objective of the twelfth house is to confine your ego because narcissistic pleasures and desires in order to acquire what it wants. The conflict between what you need and what you want can be totally destructive to the soul. This is the house of karma or the end of it.

M8qLP7MLaa	Naruto never goes to Jounin exams.

J9pIrpkBaa	Justin agreed to let Frankie have Charlie in the end. I can't quite remember what happened but it was something to do with Justin getting Jake to confess to Sean's murder. Justin was the one who finally got Jake to confess (because he did it for Warren to get Louise of the hook) and he said to Jake that he would support Frankie in Court and would leave Charlie alone if Jake admitted to the Murder. <br>  <br>  When it all went to court Justin was supposed to support Nancy but in the end he told the Judge that he didn't think Nancy was fit to be Charlie's guardian and so Frankie got custody.|`|IPoaeWXPaa	I think they might get it back, was it not on Friday night that when Justin and Ste were in the dog with the group of guys going to the football charlie was bought up?<br>  Thats the first time its been mentioned in ages so this might be the producers way of bringing it back up again...|`|0ejfWPytaa	Well...

Chris had been trying to make rihana jelouse getting girls numbers one of the girls text him about meeting up, and he responded, she got upset and somewhere along the lines it began to escilate.   he was driving and drilling her in the face as he was driving, she called her assistant and acted as if she was calling the cops told him their looking for him so he pulled over and let her have it some more!!!! she curled up into a ball, rolled over so he grabed her in a good old choak hold and started biting her neck ear and sholder (probably took some advice from tyson) then tossed her out the car like a rag doll due to the fact that she went uncouncous somewhere throught the whole ordeal... I don't know how my Girlfriend got the information, but she's kinda like a detective......|`|d1tyTq6Saa	they were on their way to the gramys and chris got a text from a girl, rhianna saw it and knew immediatly who that waz.

He wouldn't listen so she slapped him on the face!!!  He got EXTREMELY mad and he started beating her up<br>  It was HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  PS.

o2FJIXS9aa	Umm, not so bad as some signs I can think of. Because Sagittarius men consider themselves to be morally upright and beyond reproach, if you are in a serious relationship with them it's unlikely they will flirt beyond what is reasonable. Mostly they like to show off their superior intellectual abilities and good will towards other people (men and women) who will appreciate it. I have a Sag neighbor that knows he's cute to me but doesn't take advantage of it. He knows his Aqua wife will go stone cold on him. Sag men are usually good looking, like female attention, but don't use their charm to full advantage if they are dedicated.|`|AA11631715	if you believe in that stuff maybe so...it's nonsense though.|`|VvCs9Ijmaa	These people like to be free and do work as per their wish.

ADBMrG87aa	I'm with you!   Nora is so obsessed with bringing down Todd that she's become incompetant and somewhat corrupt.  Todd gets beat up to almost a pulp and John McBain didn't even get a slap from Nora, Bo or anyone else in law enforcement.  John McBain broke every law in the book when he barged into Todd's house and battered Todd to a pulp and Nora, Bo and everyone else just forget that laws were broken and Todd's rights were violated.  Nah...Nora's too busy trying to find something to stick it to Todd and if John had beaten Todd to death, Nora would find a way to not punish John and she'd probably celebrate Todd's death.  Dorian the malicious vindictive two faced pompous farce who tried to kill Ray Montez thinks its ok for her to commit crimes but Todd is not entitled to anything not even his own family.  She's another one who's just out to stick it to Todd just for the heck of it.  Todd can't seem to catch a break in Llanview; he's made too many enemies with important influential people and his timing just sucks because he's always at the wrong place at the wrong time.  I don't think that the serial killer knew that Todd was heading over to see Blair so that was just a coincidence.<br>  <br>  (\__/)<br>  (='.'=)<br>  (")-(")<br>  Sweetie|`|fab4d863aae6c11ee1163077586edcdaaa	Here, Here!<br>  <br>  Nora's problem is that she can't get over Todd terrorizing her tail while she was blind and threatening to rape her!  OH, and ... that sticky little business of her being made a fool of by Todd, Zack and Powell!  Remember: she was their defense attorney in Marty's rape trial, and she put poor Marty through the ringer trying to make her out to look like a **** who "asked for it" ... only to find out that her three little defendants were playing her.<br>  <br>  As for Dorian ... that old cow HAS no excuse!  She's got mental problems sure as the nose on my face ... and I don't even see how her two sisters Melinda and Addie ended up in nut homes, but she didn't!  She's nuttier than Melinda and Addie put (baked) together on a Tollhouse Cookie!|`|UY3zl9dFaa	It's understandable why Todd would be Llanview's prime suspect for all crimes- he's done A LOT of really bad things throughout the years and ticked off a lot of people. As for the current story line, it looks like someone is setting him up- there he was with Lee's body in his own house, he'd had a fight with Wes the night before he was stabbed, and he appeared right after Blair was stabbed (btw, looking totally unsurprised). The question is who would stab these people (and maybe more) to set Todd up (if that really is their motive)?|`|NGNeT3rYaa	I know, he is responsible for a lot, but not this time. he wouldn't hurt Blair bc for one, she has custody, he don't, so if she dies,his kids are without both of them. For two, no matter how he acts or what he says, he loves her still and always will, she is the mother of his children.

3jjS6f0Vaa	It's called D-minor augmented. That's take a normal D minor:<br>  <br>  x57765 and augment the 5th, the A note, in this case it's fret 7 on the D string, so it becomes an A# on fret 8.|`|hGTuCqeEaa	I just checked this out on You Tube. The  tune starts with C minor 7 for 1 bar, then F minor for 1 bar, followed by Bb for 1 bar. The next bar has Eb for two beats, then Bb/D for two beats. Bars 5-7 are the same as bars 1-3; bar 8 has D minor for two beats followed by G for two beats; then in bar 9 they play C minor on beat one followed by a dead stop until beat one of the next bar; the vocal follows the changes you listed, SteGriff, with the passing chord Bb/D as in the intro between Eb and C minor. The passing chord you supplied above would work- it's a G minor 7/D, which is relative to Bb; if you listen to the piano intro, he doesn't use a G there, but adding one to the chord would not clash.<br>  That's a fun tune; I hope you have fun singing and playing it for the listening and dancing pleasure of others.<br>  Hamish M- there's no such thing as a minor augmented chord; augmented triads consist of two rising major thirds from the root. Any other use of that term in a chordal sense is out of context.

pbqo4nXGaa	The way I understand it is that if it is a multi media prize, it is one, or how every many of the item are being given away, per all stations & if it is local it is just your local station. If you click on 'show more info' above the picture of each prize, it will say either mm (Multi media) or L (local).

You have a better chance of winning the local prizes as less people would be entering, but I do know people that won the MM prizes.  One of my friends won the $1000 prize a couple years ago.  It seems harder to win the MM prizes, as more and more people are playing.<br>  <br>  Good luck, hope you win something big!!|`|Z81bOxq7aa	It's both, depending on the prize.

9azX3N4Laa	Sun in Leo in 11th house makes you love attention and very friendly to people. You shine when your in a group or with your friends. Venus in Leo in the 12th house can make secretly obessed with your looks. The person you date has to look good also. This can make a person vain.Physical appearance is important to you.|`|a2ag67pKaa	?|`|Ow3O7h4caa	This is an excellent position for any types of relationship. No matter what the purpose of the relation, the two of you will be able to get along.<br>  <br>  Even for marriage, because in the long run, friendship is one of the most important elements in cementing a marital relationship. Both will share common interest and ideals as this is what the 11th house offers.  Even in a business or professional relationship it is likely to develop a strong personal dimention as well.<br>  <br>  As for Venus in the 12th, it is one of the least difficult planets to have here. This signifies tht while you may have strong feelings of affection for each other, you may not be demonstrative about them.  Others may not even be aware of how you feel about each other. I don;t know if this is a secret relationship or what but, this position can make it hard to understand the dynamics  of this relatiosnip and you may do things for no apparent reason.<br>  This can be either good or bad depending on what you do. Try to understand what lies behind your relationship. On the positive side, this placement can ehlp both of you overcome your ego-drives within the relationship.

nbZMSCkSaa	The only way I know of getting it to sound like a synth properly is with one of the electro harmonix pedals of that variety. They've made a few. The two that come to mind at the moment are the POG and the HOG, both of which will make you wet yourself at how good they sound and neither of which could ever be described as cheap unfortunately.<br>  <br>  By pendulum do you mean the band pendulum? If so, then, square wave distortion is the go (failing that muff type distortions come to mind as a vague possibility depending on what your setup has to offer. Whatever flattens out your sound and gets rid or characteristic variations in tone). That's the closest I've got. There aren't any pedals I can think of that are meant for square wave. Some multi-fx pedal boards have it as one of their distortion features. The Boss ME-50 has it (that's what I use) and its an all round pretty decent pedal for the type and price. I also roll of all the treble on the guitar's tone knobs and then boost it back on the amp (I have a Mesa/Boogie with graphic EQ) but the treble knob or a eq pedal would do much the same I suppose. It has the effect of getting rid of the trebly pick attack which helps identify the tone as being that of a guitar. I also use just the tinniest bit of chorus, so little that u wouldn't even pick it just to listen but it just helps to made things sound less natural.|`|3vwvLWrHaa	I use a magnet and hover it over the strings near the pickup, it makes some freaky sounds with a good DSP and a whammy bar|`|TZz1uPY2aa	There are foot pedals that can achieve this effect.

2cZvjZTnaa	The black notes are actually dependent on the notes it is in between. If there is a thing that looks like a b in front of a note on the music, that means it is flat. So you play the black note that is down from it. Say you have a B flat. You would play the black note in between A and B.<br>  <br>  If there is something that looks like a tic-tac-toe board in front of the note, that makes it sharp. That would make it the black note up. So if you have a C sharp, you would play the black note in between C and D.<br>  <br>  There are also some special cases. If you have C flat, you would play the white note, B. If you have B sharp, you would play C. Another case is with E and F. If you have E sharp, you play F, and if you have F flat, you play E.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps. Good luck with your learning.|`|vsy4QMHMaa	There are any number of on-line music theory to explain notation, the use of key signatures and accidentals. There is way too much to cover here.

If the note is a sharp, it is on the black key to the right of that note (ie C sharp would be on the black key to the right of the C key) and if it's a flat it's to the left. If there is no black key to the right or left it's just the next white key.

gPuASwcWaa	Legal issues<br>  T.I. was on probation stemming from a 1998 conviction for violating a state controlled substances act and for giving false information. After being released on probation, he earned a litany of probation violations in several counties around Georgia for offenses ranging from possession of a firearm to possession of marijuana.[38] In 2006, after appearing in an Atlanta court on (May 10) and having charges that he threatened a man outside a strip club last year dropped for lack of evidence, T.I. was arrested on an outstanding probation violation warrant from Florida. The warrant claimed that T.I. did not complete the required number of community service hours he was sentenced for a 2003 assault of a female sheriff deputy at University Mall in Tampa. T.I. was detained by several mall Security Guards at the time of the incident. According to WSB-TV Atlanta, the rapper’s attorney said that the problem was nothing more than a "technical matter" between Georgia and Florida. The confusion arose because T.I. was also sentenced to community service in Georgia for driving with a suspended license, for which he did complete 75 hours of community service in his home state. The rapper was released on bail shortly after being arrested, and was expected to surrender to Florida state authorities the following week to resolve the matter.[39]<br>  <br>  On October 13, 2007, federal authorities arrested T.I. four hours before the BET Hip-Hop Awards.[40] He was charged with two felonies — possession of three unregistered machine guns and two silencers, and possession of firearms by a convicted felon. The arrest was made in the parking lot of a downtown shopping center, which a witness identified as the Walgreens drug store at the corner of North and Piedmont Avenues. Harris was arrested after allegedly trying to purchase the guns from a "cooperating witness" with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. According to federal officials, the witness had been cooperating with authorities since Wednesday, when he was arrested on charges of trying to purchase guns from a federal agent. The witness had been working as Harris' bodyguard since July, authorities said.[41][42] T.I. walked out of the Atlanta United States District Court after appearing before U.S. Magistrate Judge Alan J. Baverman on October 26, 2007. Judge Alan J. Baverman required T.I. post a $3 million bond, $2 million in cash and $1 million in equity on property he owns. The rapper was required to remain at home except for medical appointments and court appearances. The only people allowed to live with him were his girlfriend and children. Visitors were required to be approved by the court. T.I.'s suppression hearing was originally stated for January 3, 2008; however, U.S. Magistrate Alan J. Baverman pushed back the suppression hearing until February 19, 2008. The performer later pleaded guilty to US federal weapons charges. He will serve a year in jail beginning in March 2009 after completing 1,000 hours of community service.[43]<br>  <br>  In an interview with MTV about serving jail time, T.I. stated, "Presumably, while I'm there, I'll be able to strategize my comeback." He went on to say that he would not "just be sitting still doing nothing".[44]<br>  <br>  On November 21, 2008, T.I. testified in the murder trial of a member of his entourage, Philant Johnson, who was murdered in a shooting that occurred after a post-concert party at a club.[45]<br>  <br>  edit: this has all the information and details.|`|CqqH12I8aa	what he said.|`|186AWszkaa	first of all the guy on top wrote to much oohh and t.i. is going to jail bcuz he had illegal weapons and if he goes to jail hell go only for a year thats why hes making so many new songsto remember him by <br>  also the judge said hell get less a sentence if he helped kids you know do the right thing|`|NtWslbpraa	He deserves to go to jail for breaking my stereo with his bad music.|`|jdSnYJtraa	cuz he got cought wit straps

She says that the Israelis attacked innocent Lebanese civilians while Hezbollah attacked the military during the Israel-Lebanon conflict. The US supports Israel, so I doubt it. She doesn't speak English, just has knowledge of a few words here and there, but did try to encourage people to learn English.<br>  <br>  She has performed with 50 Cent and has been with Naomi Campbell, etc but that's when they're over there (like in Cannes, France, etc) but I think there'd be a lot of negative publicity if she actually TRIED to become famous here, especially because of the wars going on now. The US doesn't have the best reputatio over in Lebanon right now.

s3iruA0raa	Don't sell it.  Our likes and dislikes come in cycles.  I play the piano and had a dry spell but am rocking again.  Do this:  What caused you to love it in the first place.  Find that and re-spark your passion.  Practice a little and play before an audience.  Once they applause, you will love it again.|`|mH8UscHdaa	Don't you dare. It's been the same with my keyboard. I thought I lost interest in it. But the small part of me just couldn't resist playing again. Just wait. When the time comes you'll get that feeling that you can't resist.

qGNkB2Ipaa	A) How is a camera for movies made?<br>  <br>  As you know Cameras for movies aren't the same as other cameras,<br>  they look more clear, but of course they need lighting.<br>  But now we can use any digital camera.<br>  <br>  Check The video and do a resume.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/movie-projector.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.howstuffworks.com/movie-proje...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  To show a modern film-based movie, there are five things you absolutely need: <br>  <br>  A way to advance each frame of the film <br>  A way to project the image from the film <br>  A way to read the audio <br>  A surface to project the image on <br>  A system to play the audio <br>  A projector provides the first three items on our list. While movies are usually projected -onto a screen, a large white wall is all you really need. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  B) How is costume make-up done?<br>  <br>  Costumes are divided in category's <br>  <br>  Depends on what time they are,<br>  <br>  Eras; 60's,70's etc; Or Ice age era or medieval time, or the present and future.<br>  <br>  Also at Morning,Noon,AfterNoon,Night and MidNight.<br>  <br>  They are made like any other clothing.<br>  <br>  Make up also depends on time.<br>  But it also depends on who your playing.<br>  <br>  Like in the Movie THE CAT IN THE HAT<br>  Mike Myers needed to be the cat.<br>  6 hours every morning.<br>  <br>  Mostly it only takes taht long when you play a mystical creasure like a zombie or a monster or even an animal.<br>  <br>  When its just a human, just a few make up.<br>  So you don't shine in the camera.<br>  <br>  From the earliest days of the movies, make-up artists have had to combine their art with film-making technology. Actors in silent films, for example, had heavy yellow make-up to compensate for orthochromatic film that was insensitive to the red end of the light spectrum [source: Patrick Robertson].<br>  <br>  <br>  Today, makeup techniques and computer-generated images come together to create visions like Lord Voldemort's snake-like face in "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire" (2005). For that look, make-up was applied to actor Ralph Fiennes' face in the usual way, but computer wizardry flattened his face and altered his nose [source: Internet Movie Database].<br>  <br>  <br>  Behind the magic on the screen, the world of a make-up artist is a demanding one. But what exactly are make-up artists' responsibilities? What's it like to work as a movie make-up artist? And what does it take to become one? Read on to find out.<br>  <br>  Depending on the demands of the movie director and the script, a film make-up artist may need to be adept in creating sophisticated, high-fashion looks or need to rely on design, sculpting and creativity to alter an actor's looks by showing age, injury or characteristics of an alien or cartoon creature.

I realize it has alot of cheap stuff, but sometimes cheap is all i want or need. I go there ,,but I try to spread my shopping around and go to other places to help them out too and keep them in business,,especially the local , small business...We need to all keep the competition up or else we won't have many choices to pick to shop at..The big places will do in all the small striving places.|`|70OHpjySaa	Cheap quality but you pay for what you get.<br>  <br>  When there, I stock up on tissues, toilet paper, paper towels...anything that cannot break.<br>  <br>  I wish they had cheaper prices on wines.

Y40IDWEOaa	Yes!! I like her new songs I guess for fun, but I miss the old overly-sensitive Britney that made songs like not a girl, not yet a woman. I never knew she had so many unreleased songs though..it would be pretty cool to listen to the ones that the company wouldn't let her release, they're probably more her. It seems like they control her a lot, she should be like f you guys and release some of them on her own.
muX5G72Vaa	Some of them have psychological disorders.|`|grifjdr0aa	Frankly, the first time I got fat, it was to protect myself.  I was sick and flippin tired of all my mother's disgusting boyfriends molesting me.  So why don't you just STFU?<br>  <br>  Not fat anymore, but 15 pounds overweight cuz I quit smoking-- again, lol.  But I haven't eaten for 5 days, maybe it's down to 10 pounds now.|`|nBGjPwViaa	I think for those people, it's not about whether they're fat or not -- the overeating is a symptom of underlying problems...<br>  Until they fix the underlying problems, they'll continue to eat...<br>  And, ya know, some people actually DO have medical conditions that<br>  make them obese!|`|XT51fZq7aa	What I dont get is the obese people that go on diet pills then continue to eat junk food constantly and fizzy drinks that are full of calories.|`|DzIlM76Xaa	Because cake is good. You're the only one I see complaining about fat people.|`|BXbnLxNJaa	I have a hard time getting from 130 to 135<br>  I will never know|`|HXpR2bw0aa	I'm a teenager and I was obese this time last year. But now, my BMI is 23, and I'm still overweight, but not for long! Last year I did think I was very fat, and I should stop eating so much, but when I was a little kid my parents let me eat anything, and they didn't teach me at school that food made you fat, and as stupid as this sounds, I honestly thought I was bigger than everyone else in my class because I was stronger than them all, so it was better.<br>  <br>  I honestly don't know why people who complain about being fat don't stop eating. For example, there is a girl in my class who is always complaining that she's fat, and always dropping hints to try and make people tell her that she isn't fat, even though she's a little overweight, but at lunch time she's eating crisps and chocolate!<br>  <br>  It's strange, but their fault. If they wanna lose weight, they'll have to make changes!<br>  <br>  <br>  :)|`|PRpO8zNkaa	I made a promise to myself and I sure as hell am kepping it:)<br>  If I EVER get to 150 pounds I am starving myself till I get back to 120 ahahaa...Its actually worked out pretty well so far.<br>  <br>  haha its so dumb when fat people complain about how hard it is being fat when they are the ones who were shoving twinkies down there throats while everyone else actually made an attempt to be skinny yet the fat people get all the sympathy.<br>  Now thats messed up.|`|l5zWxw1Aaa	they do, but they are lazy.<br>  take my mom for example. she drinks coke, wants to eat out alll the time, and then complains about how fat her stomach is.<br>  and i'm like mom, you can go running with me any time its not that hard, it's also not hard to cut back on all that food you eat.<br>  and then she gets mad!|`|Mgg5vcdOaa	Probably usually similar to why a smoker doesn't quit smoking even though they cough constantly and cannot breathe.  It can be an addictive habit that is hard to break AND one can completely avoid alcohol and tobacco but one cannot go without food.|`|jBZJkSjWaa	it all happens gradually so they only notice it after the situation is out of hand...to gain is easier than to shed...and to shed needs hard work and dedication...to gain just needs xtra eating...|`|fYIchD71aa	I really have the same question! how difficult is for someone to understand that they must stop eating? They probably have no mirrors, who knows?|`|uS1KAnCbaa	iv never had a weight problem so i dont know..maybe theyve been that way as long as they can remember and dont feel like they can do anything about it..or maybe they need to put down the fishsticks....|`|cYsPx9sSaa	whats your question? lets think about that first? why dont people come up with proper questions before putting a question mark in front of them, i mean the stupid people who complain that they didnt get any proper answers

I cry every time i hear Walk Like A Man and I Got The Girl. I could watch their music video's all day..i love the video for Wanted Dead Or Alive, Misunderstood, Living On A Prayer, Have A Nice Day, and I'll Sleep When I'm Dead. but i guess I'm not a huge fan because i don't own any of their Cd's, T Shirts, Poster, or anything like that...and they aren't my most favorite band.|`|rFBypeEfaa	This is a big bon jovi fan.<br>  <a href="http://991.com/newGallery/Bon-Jovi-It-Aint-Over-Til-428480.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://991.com/newGallery/Bon-Jovi-It-Ai...</a>|`|MXjvZMUXaa	I wouldn't say I'm the biggest Bon Jovi fan, but I'd say I'm the biggest Bon Jovi 14 year old fan 'cause I've been listening to them all my life.|`|pyHF4eYJaa	I would say that I am the least big Bon Jovi fan.|`|z3WTXOmZaa	I'm their biggest fan, just because I love them.<br>  <br>  But more seriously, I think in term of support the Japanese and the German fanatics are the best for this band, those countries always have Bon Jovi in the number one spot, so I think that, I'm from Colombia, and that's what I have realized the last 12 years that I followed them|`|jrO9L6mEaa	bon jovis great|`|7nkQyM0Laa	His Mom, she knitted him a New Jersey.|`|Rwv6tSLhaa	wrong.<br>  im 14 aswelll.[:<br>  that makes lots of us.[:

Possibly Into Eternity - Nothing.|`|REoNMbanaa	"The Arms of the angels" by sara mclaughlin. it's emotional yet soothing and quiet. its a beautiful song and i highly reccomend it.|`|YcWGDKvkaa	probably, "Angels" by Robbie Williams or "Live and let die" by Paul McCartney it's cool when a piano could be there.|`|TGxo22Smaa	the air that i breathe - all that remains<br>  i'd like to get that song played in my funeral.|`|4gIGX56naa	The Show Must Go On- Queen|`|Gnx24Eqvaa	To where you are by Josh Groban.

emGF1hZ9aa	It depends on what kind of music you want to play.<br>  <br>  The best thing to do though, is to practice scales and chords, then you can build on that. Even learning music theory would be a good idea. If you're still in school, see if your school has a music theory class, and if it does, take it as an elective.<br>  <br>  If you want to play rock songs, look for songs by bands like Three Days Grace and Breaking Benjamin. Most of their songs sound awesome, and would be impressive to hear, but use mostly power chords and have few, if any, solos. <br>  <br>  Have fun!!!|`|o8y7MYi0aa	For now practice different songs, and practicing hammer-ons and pull-offs won't do any harm. So far, just start of slow and repeat songs a lot, then gradually build up speed. And use your pinky, a lot of people are reluctant to do that.<br>  <br>  Good songs to start off with:<br>  -Crazy Train by Ozzy<br>  -Any Black Sabbath<br>  -Sweet Child O' Mine by Guns N Roses<br>  -One by Metallica<br>  -(Don't Fear) The Reaper by Blue Oyster Cult<br>  -Rock You Like a Hurricane by The Scorpions<br>  -Any Blink 182<br>  <br>  Need any more help, email me.
akcGfgdcaa	I'm still trying to get used to the whole dynamic change of having a 4th judge.<br>  <br>  I also hate her use of the word "ridiculous"...she says it in almost every sentence!|`|SMrG7A9laa	When she says "you killed the song", she means it was a great performance. I like her much better than Paula, I mean seriously who says " I want to squeeze u and stick u on my rearview mirror" ? [Paula said that to David Archuleta when he sang Imagine]|`|dHcP602caa	She says the exact same things the other judges say. But it's a lot better with four judges, in my opinion. She's annoying, yes, but I would still rather have her there.|`|TGV6gEiuaa	She always speaks in a very patronizing way, which annoys me. But at least most of her comments make more sense than Paula's!|`|KlkUj6uFaa	She is extremely nasty and annoying!|`|D2C0OSenaa	i think killed it means good.<br>  not sure though.<br>  <br>  i don't like her and she annoys me a lot.<br>  :(
QMYNDtHgaa	I don't really like any of them to much. <br>  I think Danny Goki is probably the best as of now.  That or the guy who sang "I can't get no satisifaction"  He looks like a Jonas Brother was to much product in his hair but has the best performance power.  Plus he has the Tween Girl Demographic eating out of his hand.|`|6OrYH4Traa	My favorite will more than likely be Adam Lambert this year.<br>  <br>  I also like Michael Sarver, Danny Gokey, Scott, Anoop, Kris Allen, and Alexis Grace.|`|pSgKRP8jaa	Adam and Scott- they are both great! Adam simply has an amazing voice, and Scott has an amazing voice but is also very inspirational. I hope one of them wins!<br>  <br>  Love,<br>  dancer805 <3|`|fQghpx3Zaa	Adam Lambert is my favorite with Anoop Desai in a close second! Adam is just pure talent. He def. fits an American Idol. His voice is freakin' amazing and he seems like a really good guy and he has the look. <br>  <br>  I don't care for Megan. She doesn't really have much talent. Just stand up there and looks cute? I think that's all that people see in her - is her looks. Her voice sucks. She has no range. Sorry though.

Especially if what pushed them together is Michael waking up.|`|rqwXqmyTaa	I am excited about Jason and Sam...Michael waking up from his coma and Dante coming into town.  Also...I think its gonna be great when Laura comes back with Scotty...not sure if that is supposed to happen...but that's how it ended when she left for France.|`|19118ef0907ef0b119cc1faefbfca6f1aa	I looking most forward to the reuniting of GH's own Bonnie and Clyde.  Can't wait for Jason and Sam to be a couple again. Also interested in seeing how the whole Ethan Lovette storyline plays out.|`|ZmGOL8kCaa	Jason and Sam's reunion!!! I love their scenes together, they're perfect together. They have crazy chemistry and are funny together too.<br>  <br>  GO JASAM!!! :P|`|VAp5ICaBaa	Sonny or Carly finding out about Claudia just so she can stop watching those DVD's|`|2Wzw4i0Vaa	i dont watch gh so much abymore since the writers screwed up lusam. but i still love my girl sam. i dont want her with jason but i like them working together on cases. 2 things i want to happen is spixie becoming a couple. i think its about time maxie acknowledges spin's feelings for her and reciprocate them. and lusam reunite but i doubt the latter will happen cuz the jasam wave seems to be growing.|`|UY3zl9dFaa	I'm curious to see how Claudia will get out of it once the truth comes out. I want to see more of Spinelli and Winifred on the run. And I want the truth about Rebecca to come out, as well as Ethan's parentage. And I want Robin to finally get some help and end the PPD story line.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	I am looking forward to Sonny figuring out what he married and what he does next.... To see wether or not Rebecca is indeed Emily, the return of Helena!!!|`|ADBMrG87aa	Excited about Michael waking up; Claudia's secret being revealed to Sonny; Jason and Sam getting back together and Spinelli and Winnifred working as a team and if Johnny and Maxie fall for each other.<br>  <br>  (\__/)<br>  (='.'=)<br>  (")-(")<br>  Sweetie|`|YA4qCDukaa	jason & sam getting back together!!!!!<br>  i was braking my heart to see jason so alone....the only one he could ever be with was her. i can't believe how different he is around her.<br>  <br>  if that rebbecca chic really IS emily.<br>  <br>  i'm just can't wait to see all of it.|`|D3Fyxj0raa	jason and sam back together and michael wakening up and Claudia's secret coming out|`|7XM4QJiuaa	Spinelli and Winifred on the run
g2QUNwZzaa	the 3rd one, the ibanez ijx...<br>  <br>  ibanez are good basses, probably 2nd most popular brand besides fender. and the package comes with alot more than the fender one (tuner, teaching dvd, louder amp) for less money.|`|l6EFHE8uaa	9 times out of 10 I would recommend Fender for the simple fact that they are the definitive bass guitar maker, but at a low price that Dean is looking like a good deal. Simple (not a whole lot of knobs to screw with), cheap, Amp included, rated well, and the people say it's great for beginners. I'd tell your buddy to get that. Also tell him to get some new strings (preferably Ernie Ball, those work best in my opinion).

d4Uz4FqZaa	Fang has an invisibility power. People can't see him if he keeps still in a place for a long time. Iggy can identify colors by touching it. Then, Iggy can contour when being nearly snow blinded. Nudge has a magnetic power. Well, she can attract metals later. Gazzy can make a big yellow-greenish gas which Max called mushroom cloud. Angel can change her appearance. But, the changes are still limited. You can recognize those powers on the fourth book.

28f3beb29b657d3d0b6851852a284a79aa	she made up all that for publicity|`|bFOqf40zaa	no she is scared and she may feel if she loses chris than she loses love.  Millions of women go through this a year.|`|JIvvg6f7aa	he gave her herpes. No one else will have her now.|`|GA5BAhaRaa	She was probably threatened by Chris Brown's managers and stuff so she wouldn't completely ruin his career, she tried to play it off like it was nothing and okay so his fans wouldn't think it was a big deal either.<br>  <br>  Have you noticed that only very few celebrities are taking sides on this issue? Like its nothing new, its ridiculous!|`|PhwOfrrgaa	because she thinks that they were meant to be and that she can't live without him. That they are true lovers. If you ask me I think that is just pathetic.|`|Ev6WQRmzaa	Women do this all the time.<br>  <br>  I've seen lots of women go back to men who beat the **** out of them. I wish I understood why, but I don't.|`|SHoIWZ56aa	she doesn't want to give up on the realtionship<br>  like if you were really in love with someone you'd do whatever to stay with teh person|`|Ubb4RiXLaa	well, at least now we know why she sang.."hate how much I love you Boy, can't stand how much i need you...." what more can I say? how do you insist on being with someone who shows you no respect, and shows no respect for your fans either? I'm still waiting to see how this all plays out...|`|ZtGThw01aa	There is no excuse, but I bet there is more than we know....There has to be a reason behind this. Surely she is not that stupid! I thought , I read on one of the tabloids, that she was pregnant. Not sure..Would not want to start a stupid rumor.|`|AA11556445	Even if she still loves him; love shouldn't have to hurt.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  <br>  There's no excuse for his behavior.  N-O-N-E.  Why would she go back?  ( o _ 0 ) I dunno.  Other than she still loves him?|`|9447d6d4627edef320b8495e7ad8a770aa	Maybe she's pregnant with his child, and doesn't want the father in jail.|`|QLe4U0baaa	i think those who like the two of them have brain damage|`|ff45d4a1e9c635610b6dabc895da74d5aa	She is just doing that for the attention of the public... that's what mainly all celebrities do anymore...|`|LWEfc0UOaa	who cares. its her life, she can go out with whoever she wants|`|jpH4IjWnaa	She's stupid to go back with him!|`|NGSCuXi2aa	I think it's the former. You have to remember that we do not know exactly what happened that night. No one has come out and actually said something. All we know is that Rihanna was attacked. We don't know the circumstances under which she was attacked.<br>  <br>  She could have hit them first, or there could have been another girl with them that night (as initial allegations first suspected).<br>  <br>  Either way, we don't have all the facts yet, so we can't say that she was wrong for going back to him.|`|HlXrHd52aa	I think you are missing something about domestic violence victims!  They OFTEN go back to, or stay in relationships with the people who are violent.  I'm sure there are different reasons (they think he is sorry, they are scared), but it happens a LOT!  <br>  <br>  Sad, isn't it?|`|fc0ceb24e049a36bb200c392ee2c4b26aa	You would have to understand the mind set of an abused woman.

Please don't judge her, but hope that she realizes that she is a beautiful and precious woman that deserves better.|`|AA12147066	either shes hiding something maybe he threatened her or she loves him and thinks hes this perfect guy but hes not it happens to abused victims who have been beaten for a period of time they get insecure and only trust there attacker its crazy but thats what happens. she'll come to her senses|`|gQudMMTXaa	Shes nuts, my 10 year old niece loves her and i think the example she is setting for the kids that listen to her music is absolutely terrible!|`|Akt4uZsAaa	She is setting a bad example for these young girls that are in abusive relationships, She hella stupid.|`|e4ZxaNxKaa	because shes pregnant with his child|`|PuMsIIL6aa	It's just hollywierd|`|7e9bce7df6b13d448cd20f1bff3d3cf3aa	Lack of self-respect???|`|yte0BzXKaa	I think shes just scared.<br>  They should lock Chris Brown up and throw away the key!|`|xVEqBjDVaa	she wants publicity.|`|uzZuwtgXaa	Treat em mean keep em keen.

It's her own fault now|`|YDRRDwiBaa	its not as bad as people say it is|`|DbWmKHbhaa	She told 107.1 that everytime Chris Brown threatens her, he later on goes back to her either crying or extremely sensitive.<br>  She said that he "is her angel all over again"<br>  <br>  I dont' know why she would be moronic to still love himi but I guess you can say she needs the publicity and she likes to start a lot of drama.|`|GC1xuZlfaa	While she started the fight with him and Rihanna are half Aquarius and Pisces so one of her is tough and the other fall too fast. Trust me I'm an Aquarius and I would be the one with the charges for beating his butt. My bestie is a Pisces she is in love soon as she meets the guy and he can do anything to hurt her she still loves him tomorrow.

CB was much better without the weird deep voice thing.  I hope he does a good job in the upcoming Terminator film.<br>  <br>  I just couldn't ever buy Mr. Mom as Batman.
7Pu5r0eMaa	I actually watched the movie yesterday...love it!<br>  <br>  but its not a true sory its a Hollywood movie. written by Jonas Barnes. The "truth" behind the story is that a family had been murdered on a small farm in the middle of America. no suspects, no witnesses, not even any evidence of who might have committed the crime. All the rest is fiction.

There are 3 seasons so far. Only the first season is translated into English, but the Japanese Subs are very good in my opinion. The second season is called Zero no Tsukaima: Futatsuki no Kishi. The third season is called Zero no Tsukaima: Princess no Rondo.
b74222ab84625a98e519e55038843a30aa	I think if you have not read the novels, it sucked.  It was three hours of listening to Rorscharch whine about how bad the world is.<br>  <br>  If you have read the novels, it was a very good adaptation.<br>  <br>  Wolfe, I agree with your post.  Just have to mention, LOTR is not a comic book movie.  It was based on novels.|`|qlVQ8GxHaa	I thought Watchmen was a great movie!<br>  I thought the sexual content was too much, but other than that,<br>  it was very good!<br>  I agree with you. My mom thought it was disturbing though. haha!|`|NtWslbpraa	Sorry, but this movie was not as good as expected. The commercial showed the best 4 parts of the movie, and thats all the movie really had. It was mainly talking about a superhero whine about the human race and crap that was not worth 10$ and not worth 3 hours. and there are a lot of comic book movies you forgot to put before Watchmen. Ironman, Lord of The Rings, The Hulk, Spiderman series, etc.

6BqA5NGhaa	YES!!! Your AMAZING! I wish I had a voice like yours! At first when I was listening to you singing Disturbia I thought I was listening to the sound track for a second. I think you are an AWESOME singer! I'm so jealous! But you are a LITTLE pitchy. Work on that and your GREAT|`|vWKQJhwRaa	ur really good at singing!! <br>  i commented :D|`|t6wpE4Q9aa	You don't have a bad vioce. But you are asking for honesty. You sounded flat in spots where your voice needs to be low and pitchy in spots where you went high. But you have a fairly nice voice. As for the video all I saw was one picture. But I commented on it.|`|cDZJgM4jaa	The beyonce song was really good. The rihanna song was good too, but i don't like the pink song. You have an incredible voice range and you should sing songs that show that off.|`|1C123Xdsaa	Yeah, you can sing. You sound English, audition for X Factor. Or American Idol if you are in US. I'm in the UK.|`|H6Ps4tbEaa	...Uhm you can only give 10 points on Yahoo! Answers...<br>  <br>  Can't hear/see the video on my work comp.<br>  Oh well.<br>  Take everyone else's word for it.|`|G03EHYj8aa	Okay, well I have to be honest. And I swear m honesty is going to get me killed someday. But really, you aren't that great...your really flat and nastily. Maybe if you got some voice lessons, you might be better. But I don't think you should try anything like "American Idol" until you've learned how to control your voice better. And seriously, i would have loved to say something, like "Wow your amazing." but really, I'm not going to lie. If I lied then you'd just go on thinking you were amazing, and some where down the road it would hurt you and you'd blame me, the person who said you were amazing.....Sorry I don't want to be mean though :)|`|hTIBZ4TDaa	I'm sorry you can't sing for your life!|`|txhUlNrhaa	i couldn't really here you but it was good when i did here you

FKaoaD2yaa	So what?? I mean, grow up Kid.. In your late 20s, being popular will be the lesser of your headaches than finding a job with a decent salary. But if this is really important to you - do these<br>  1. Work out and build a hot physique<br>  2. Grow an assertive attitude without being a total jerk <br>  3.

You also have to be a little consided like if theres a nerd or something look at her like "umm goo away from me", you also can't talk to just anybody talk to the cool people and the popular people.

eff556e68b639b40e89cc7516013482faa	Ok. Just so you know, Maury is what is known as a syndicated program. It's not part of a network's programming. Individual stations get these shows and air them whenever they have open airtime. For example, around here, Maury is aired around 11am, so when you said "last night", I had no idea what you were talking about. <br>  <br>  Also, if you ever run into this problem again, and the commercial aired on a local tv station, you can call them. You can ask for the Traffic Department. They have to keep a log of everthing (and I mean EVERY little thing) that went over the air.

emGF1hZ9aa	"You Found Me is a tough song for me. Its about the disappointment, the heartache, the let down that comes with life. Sometimes you're let down, sometimes you're the one who lets someone else down. It gets hard to know who you can trust, who you can count on. This song came out of a tough time, and I'm still right in the thick of it. There's some difficult circumstances my family and friends have been going through over the past year or so and can be overwhelming. It wears on me. It demands so much of my faith to keep believing, keep hoping in the unseen. Sometimes the tunnel has a light at the end, but usually they just look black as night. This song is about that feeling, and the hope that I still have, buried deep in my chest."<br>  <br>  <br>  -- Isaac -- MySpace Bulletin.|`|sLVGdCOTaa	I think it's about God finding him|`|kGSZvLxbaa	I think its about a man waiting for god to preform a miracle for him. In the lyrics, about the telephone, its a metaphor. Hes really waiting for a miracle. That miracle is for a girl to like him/ stay with him. But he decides to give up. And right after he gives up, the girl starts liking him. So he felt that god was "just a little late". Its like that quote that goes: The day after the day I give up on loving you, you will start loving me. I can really relate to this song. Maybe thats not really what the song means, but thats what IVE interperated.

ak610Npjaa	it would be alot better if u knew her venus sign but ill go off her being a taurus since i am one also. make sure you stay in her life ex.. call or text just to check on her ask can you stop by just to talk as u probably know we love to listen. stay around but dnt make it to obvious right now.. we dnt do well with aquas bc they dnt give us what we need so if the relationship gets bumpy be there for her, when its over give her a little while to get over it and then tell her how you feel. she will appreciate your honesty and consider how u have been there for her<br>  <br>  hope this helps  and good luck
