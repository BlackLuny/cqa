pMIc1XXWaa	the kings are tards. they traded a great young player in o'sullivan who had 2 years left on his contract for 2 mil for williams who is often injured and he is 3 years older and is going to be out for another 2 weeks. he is under contract for 2 years for 3.5 mil.<br>  <br>  so they traded down and they managed to throw away a 2nd round pick all in one move which shows dean lombardi has incredible talent.|`|c69svim5aa	The best was obviously the Guerin trade because he was the captain of the Isles and they just traded him.

7eiXqVKuaa	Your on the right track with the stuff you are already doing you just have to stay dedicated and you will continue to see progress. Some things you can try in addition to the track your already running is to get a parachute pack or if your strapped for cash tie some weights to a rope and tow them around at 40 yrd sprint intervals, and try to really explode out of the gate. Just be carefull if your doing the weights to not hurt your back. go easy with the amount of weight you use to make sure your body can handle it before really exploding out of the blocks with it.|`|4c53e7f4bfee240ca908f05ec3874353aa	Wild Bill has some great advice.  I just want to add that racquetball will improve you lateral movement, hand eye coordination.  Like basketball, your first step towards your goal (block, pull, fill, etc. should be your quickest), unless it is a draw, of course.  But to really excel, my advice would be learn proper technique.  In all aspects of being a fullback, learn your techniques.|`|dmrpFGxcaa	Watch Jim Kleinsasser highlights he was the best

WdgIaLZJaa	Yes, you should be able to run right into lane 1 as soon as you receive the baton from your teammate. I ran a DMR last year for track and I ran the 400 but I noticed that you can go right into the first lane.|`|U5l7LZ3kaa	No.  Usually you have to wait until the backstretch to cut in (that is if the 400 is first) .  Don't cut in immediately too.  Run the tangent.  That means run in a straight line to the start of the next curve.  Don't cut in right away.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps - Good luck.

rNUyV1EYaa	Yes, they will draft a safety.<br>  <br>  But a more immediate solution will be starting Patrick Watkins or Courtney Brown at free safety; then moving Ken Hamlin into Williams' old strong safety spot.|`|cdQryr7paa	They don't need a safety.<br>  Williams was hurt most of the season last year.<br>  They proved they don't need him.<br>  What they need now is a cover corner back since they traded Henry away for Kitna.|`|iVAR3Osfaa	Strong Safety is a need in BIG D. Roy will be traded to a small market team in need of leadership like a Detriot or San Fran. Da Boys and NFL's minor league team have done business of recent. Why not? Maybe for a 2nd or 3rd round pick. Big D won't get their #1 pick back they gave up 4 the WR Roy Williams.|`|daRDQE9maa	Chung wouldn't be bad but what if they pick up a vetran like Jermaine Phillips he can def still play ball.... so i don't know i think they will make it work out they normally have a good defense despite a few collapses last season...|`|RS3fjNboaa	They'll draft a safety for sure. I'd like to see Chung in dallas, but I'm not sure he'll still be available that late. I think Roy hurt the Cowboys more than he helped them.|`|c03a1e29209b69a15065f8edab5c54daaa	Well, if they could move up the board a ways they could probably snag William Moore.  I don't think he'll fall to the 51st pick though, so they'll have to make some draft day moves.|`|opOJPp9uaa	The would like to trade SS Roy Williams, but no one will trade for someone that is likely be cut. As for safeties I would like them to consider taking Texas Tech's Darcell McBath. Just a thought.|`|HE6S36fQaa	i think that they dont need roy that much because last season they didnt do to bad without him. What they need to focus on is on Ray Lewis and get him to sign with the cowboys :))))|`|5B6w8mxVaa	Yea they will draft a safety, sad thing is roy was goof years ago.|`|dmrpFGxcaa	Roy Williams sucks.  I hope cowgirl fans dont expect too much for him in return because he isnt worth much.|`|Vkbgr94xaa	The Cowgirls suck!!!!  <br>  <br>  I hope they restructure Roys deal and keep him because he rocks!!!!

AA12262106	Definitely with running shoes. Not only do running shoes protect your feet from possible injury from debris that you might step on, they are designed to provide support for your feet and ankles.|`|BJERgbM5aa	Outside running?  Paved roadway? Track?  Indoors?  What's the story.|`|TMkHzArLaa	Running shoes  because you could get  problems with your ankles, feet, arches, back, legs, knees, ect by running with no shoes. wear running shoes. They will let you keep running comferbel|`|U5l7LZ3kaa	Depends on where you are running.  If you can run on a perfectly flat spongey surface (an artificial turf field or a major league baseball field) go barefoot.  For everything else - get some running shoes.|`|H0knYRKbaa	lol, i ran the last 2 miles of a XC race without shoes because a blister was forming on my left foot. turns out there was a piece of wood stuck on one of my spikes (as i found out after the race).

My suggestion is to run with shoes on.|`|AA10287830	I can run alot faster barefoot but if you are running track you need a good running shoe.|`|WdgIaLZJaa	Running shoes absolutely because you could get serious problems with your legs, knees, ankles, feet, arches, back, and all kinds of other parts of your body by running with no shoes. I have arch problems and knee problems and they really limit what you can do. Please wear running shoes, they will let you keep running longer and more comfortably.|`|e45f658f9932624abf10e836e95d3bd3aa	WOW!!! I can't believe how uninformed people are these days about running barefoot. When a barefoot Abebe Bikila of Ethiopia won the Gold  for the marathon at the 1960 Olympics in Rome, the whole world saw how functional a pair of bare feet can be. In the early 21st century, American Ken Bob Saxton maintains the Web site runningbarefoot.org, which has inspired <br>  numerous runners around the globe to investigate the <br>  benefits of running without shoes. As of March 2007, Saxton had finished 59 marathons running barefoot. That is equivalent to running halfway across the United States, roughly the distance from Los Angeles to Kansas City.<br>  <br>  The number of barefoot runners has steadily grown over the past several years.  Brett Williams, ran the 2006 Salt Lake City marathon sans shoes. The Wall Street Journal and other media outlets took note of Williams accomplishment, and ABC News aired a feature on barefoot running in November of that year. <br>  <br>  Even various shoe manufactures recognize the <br>  benefits of nature’s original design. Some have even developed designs that attempt to simulate being barefoot to some extent. Of course, anyone who desires to get that barefoot feeling, can simply save their money and just go barefoot. <br>  Nike Free: Nike researchers developed a training shoe that simulates barefoot running. The Nike Free was born as a result of researchers watching the Stanford track and field team practice and perform training exercises barefoot.<br>  Swiss Masai Barefoot Technology: This shoe style provides less support and stabilization, requiring the foot muscles to work during the act of walking. As a result, the feet become stronger, more developed, and less prone to aches and pains.<br>  Newton Running: This new shoe’s active membrane retracts as the foot rolls onto its toes requiring the runner to land on the forefoot or midsole as opposed to heel-first landings. A technique widely used by barefoot runners.<br>  In general, being barefoot promotes healthy development of musculature in the feet and legs, while excessive reliance on shoes tends to promote atrophy and weakness in those same muscles. This suggests that overdependency on shoes can have serious consequences. A study published in the September 2006 issue of Arthritis and Rheumatism found that “modern shoes may exacerbate the abnormal mechanics of lower-extremity osteoarthritis.”  Researchers concluded that maybe it was time to re-evaluate our daily walking programs, <br>  presumably to include time for walking barefoot.|`|dyBMX1hgaa	it may feel like running barefoot would be the best idea because you don't have the extra weight of your running shoes. But the truth is if you run without shoes you are missing your base of everything and could end up with serious problems|`|Jr9j5f6naa	I'd say 99% it is better to run with shoes. unless somehow you get stuck with shoes 4 times smaller or bigger than your size I guess...or if your times are a lot better without shoes? but I doubt that...so...?

b6hid42iaa	WTF?!?!?!<br>  <br>  Dwayne Wade Is WAYYYYY better than A.I. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1111111<br>  <br>  <br>  i think Dwayne Wade is the Best player in the NBA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|AA10263761	Like Stephen A Smith on ESPN Says<br>  "Everybody Is Entitled to there own Opnion, but that doesnt mean there opnion cant be wrong."<br>  <br>  His Opnion is Very Very Wrong and Idiot<br>  <br>  Edit:Anthony E M<br>  Wade has a Championship Which he Won by Him Self and Iverson Doesnt Have a Ring|`|1JsWMX0daa	Allen Iverson is deffinetly NOT bettr than Dwayne Wayde. But, Dwayne Wade is NOT the best player in the NBA. like them or not the truth is that coby and Labron james are the best players in the NBA. But, Dwayne Wayde definetly makes the BEST commercials!|`|H8u7gMAYaa	Hell no. A.I. is a better scorer than Wade, but that is about it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: Anthony E. Exaclty right man. He is the BIGGEST Wade jocker I have ever seen. Anybody besides Wade, he says they all suck in comparison toward Wade.|`|QJgcwXzxaa	because those A.I fans are too stubborn to believe their favorite player  and  once scoring champion will become a 6th man and want to bag on other people to hide from the truth that Wade and a lot more point guards are better than Iverson today.|`|vFthoB6Haa	dwyane is way too better and stronger than allen iverson..but if AI has the same height as dwyane is, or maybe even lebron, i'll go for iverson!|`|868namC6aa	nobnody in the whole world could think AI is better.<br>  <br>  D-Wade is the best!|`|HiuNSScLaa	Rockets FTW your like other a.i fans they can't stand seeing one of there favorites getting benched you have obviously never met the *** hole my uncle lives right near one of his houses in virginia hes met him like 20 times i met him with my uncle (my uncle hates him cause he has a nasty attitude but he let me meet him) hes a ****** prick hes an *** hole he woudnt even sign my ball wtf kind of nba player doesnt sign a 12 year old kids ball even if hes pissed and whoever said a.i was or is better than wade is a ******* joke and wade is still a better scorer ALSO so whoever said that is a total fn joke|`|8Cv70ZUyaa	dwyane wade is the best of the best! who in this world would think that allen iverson is better than him?|`|6Gg0wIM4aa	That's RIDICULOUS! By the way Kobe is by far the best|`|JD5NQxeNaa	Who says just because a player is a 6th Man he is not better than  a starter and a star starter, like Wade. Take Manu for example he is one of the best SG's in the NBA like it or not and he is a 6th Man. Leandro Barbosa is better than more than half of the NBA's tweeners and he is too a 6th Man.<br>  <br>  D.Wade is having a great season. But, he has not accomplished what AI has for his career and AI is in a system that does not work with the type of player he is. Last, year on a transition team in Denver and for a couple of seasons AI > Wade, so right now AI has not declined it is just that he is on a team that does not play his style, so he is still better than Wade.<br>  <br>  I find it funny that you say Wade is so great and has done nothing of value except stats since Shaq left. I am also beginning to think you are a Wade jocker and not a true Miami fan. That is something I can not take serious. I like fans not jockers.<br>  <br>  Also, D.Wade is not the Best player in the NBA. I admit he is beastly and I hate Miami. But, he is not the best player in the NBA. I would take LBJ23, TD, KB24, DH12, KG, and maybe even CP3 over him. MVP Candidates have their team above a 7th seed by seasons end the Heat will be a 7th seed. By the way if Jamal Crawford has the ability to out perform D.Wade for 52 I believe. Manu sure as hell can compare to Wade in a head 2 head. Manu when healthy plays well against KB24, who is better than Wade, so why can't Manu compare to Wade?|`|xeEOTsyYaa	...He has Fidel Castro as his avatar. Not that surprising.<br>  <br>  And yes, at this point, Wade is better. But Iverson in his prime was on Wade's level.|`|KYaM65gzaa	a prime Iverson couldnt top this Wade.

eEjcEZ8gaa	I have declined every gal's request to take her fishing.  It won't happen.  My fishing spots require some boulder scrambling and long hikes, not to mention some very aggressive wading.  And when I'm out on the water, I'm staying on the water.  No matter how cold, wet or hungry I may be, I'm casting until darkness drives me out of the river.<br>  <br>  Besides, my fishing time is my time.  I don't want to hear moaning about rain, mosquitoes, frigid water or camp food.  I go fishing to 'get away from it all.'  Generally, when they understand there's no tv, no restaurants, no internet, and lots of physical challenges, they opt to stay behind...where they belong.|`|QujHYtQqaa	My significant other and I usually go together. We have fun, cause we both are quite competitive.

It all in the approach, just slow it down. He never listens and gets so p-off! I laugh and take lots of pics. So it can be fun as long as they know what they're doing. You don't want to have to fish for the other person too, cause' they don't have a clue. No fun then for sure!! Good luck and remember to CPR.|`|SEpHGcnKaa	My ex never wanted to go fishing with me.

You'd rather go up to the lake and fish for a stupid bass than be with me.

In all honesty, if you look at his early years, he really wasn't even good, Pittsburgh just had a run-first offense and Ben's only job was to not lose the game.  Look at his SB win, he sucked, roughly 100 yards, nothing special, he just didn't throw the ball much and didn't take chances that could result in INTs.  Over the years he's matured into a decent QB who can make plays as needed.  I still think he's overrated, but if he was drafted to Cleveland he would have never had the success he had in Pitt and likely wouldn't even be starting now.

r4btdgQlaa	The hard truth is that rock climbing is much more dangerous than sky diving. In sky diving, you get 2 parachutes. If one doesn't deploy correctly, then you could clip it and deploy the other one. Rock climbing, however, is very dangerous. There are many jagged rocks that can easily cut people and start an infection. There is a possibility that the safety attachment at the top could break loose and you could fall to your death. There might also be poisonous creatures laying on a rock that you might happen to grab and you will need to be rushed to the hospital, but you are still on a elevated rock giving you less time to get down safely onto the ground and over to the emergency room. Of course you must be skilled in both sports, but what may surprise people is that skydiving is safer that rock climbing.|`|uC9iiQqVaa	definatly sky diving.<br>  rock climbing on a mountain can be very dangerous depending on high and what equiptment you have.<br>  I think more people die doing rock climbing because sky diving is always  done with professionals and there are strong regulations but I little problem 10,000 feet up and you dont stand a chance,|`|QGrnEIETaa	Sky Diving.<br>  If you don't use a parachute you DIE!!
KDpR83oVaa	There is no right answer to your question.  Realistically, if as a player you are a very good skater then you will be one of the best at the position you play.  You can list all the reasons why skating is important to each position but you just need to be a great skater to be a good player.  I have coached kids starting at 4 year olds right up to 10 year olds.  The kids that skate well at a young age always excell and become the players that play on AAA or select teams.  It is an exception for a child that struggles in skating to catch and become as good a player as the ones that are good at skating when they start.  If you as a young player do not have to concentrate on your skating game it allows you to become a good stick handler.  You are able to learn how to handle the puck while keeping your head up and "seeing" the ice.  This is huge!!!<br>  <br>  My boy starting skating at 2 1/2 years old and is now 10.  He has been playing on top teams since he was 5.  Has starting playing on AAA teams for the past two years and mainly because of his ability to skate.  All good skaters at a young age tend to end up playing on the point (Defence) because of their exceptional skating ability forwards and backwards and specifically their transition.  It also allows them to move the puck out of their zone because they are always looking up ice to make the play or clear the zone because they see the forecheck.  Kids with their heads down will never see this part of the game till later in age.  Another important part is their stability.  They need to be agile and strong on thier skates so they are not easily knocked off the puck.<br>  <br>  Anyway to answer your second part of the question.  It wil take no time to become a good skater if you practise enough.   It is important to have a good long stride and learn to use your edges turning and stopping on both sides.  Most young skaters will tend to always stop and turn one way you need to do both.  Never turn your back on the play!!!<br>  <br>  Hope that helped!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!!!|`|ZNFjSlKvaa	You need to be able to do different things everywhere.<br>  Center requires the most endurance, its the most skating. But mainly forwards skating. Centers out of the forwards are usually the most conditioned and are usually very fast.<br>  Wings are good at stops and starts. Its still a lot of skating but not as much.<br>  Defense has backwards skating to do. That's the hardest part for them, they need to be able to watch the play develop by skating as fast backwards as the other players forwards. They have to be able to transition from forward to backwards easily.<br>  Goalie is actually a lot of skating work. Its said often that the goalies are the teams best skaters. They have to use their edges constantly.<br>  <br>  It depends how hard and long you practice. You need to work hard. I have been playing for just under 4 years and are one of the strongest skaters on my team. Work hard and good luck!|`|8t5vPDnqaa	Defence, goalie, forward.|`|hMo9z0TSaa	In my opinion would be both Defense and Forward, because when you are a Forward you have to go all the way down to the other side of the ice and same with Defense. Defense though you would have to be tougher because Defense guys usually check the other teams player to get the Puck back. Goalie is easy but you would have to ALL the techniques and if your teams pulls you, you just have to skate to the bench but you would have to stand on the ice, be VERY Flexible.|`|pUus16BYaa	Forwards probably the least, I swear there is this kid on my hockey team that is the worst skater but if he rips one from center ice I bet he would score.<br>  Defense should have some good skating ability because they have to skate backwards a lot and move the puck out of their zone.<br>  However Goalies need the most Skating Skills because me myself being a goalie know it is not easy to skate with all that goalie gear on. You also have to react in a second which means being quick on your feet. Goalies even have to play the puck sometimes so they need to be able to skate|`|QSShHlRiaa	Goalie,Defense Man,Forward.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Unlike most people i will give you the most truthfull answer.<br>  just ask anybody who knows anything about hockey.<br>  and they will tell you that the Goaltender is the position where<br>  skating skills will be needed the most. And if you do not believe me<br>  here are a cuople of reasons.<br>  <br>  1.) Goalies must be able to get up after the make a save.<br>  2.) Goalies must be able to slide across the goal line to stop a shot.<br>  3.) The Goalie must be able to hold his ground on breakways or else skaters will just skate around the goalie.<br>  4.) If a goalie can not skate he will just fall to the ice on every shot he will never be successful<br>  <br>  My point...<br>  <br>  a goalie will never be able to make it far in his carrer if he can not skate.<br>  <br>  Go public skating whenever you have the chance work to your full potential at practices when doing skating drills.

wpDegcx6aa	Yessir you are shooting correctly. I usually jump and then releases but do whatever is more comfortable for you.|`|2f4qTCciaa	a) you practice shooting the ball <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x6zg_wKgSM" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x6zg_wKg...</a><br>  b) you can do both, but if you release the ball when you are coming down you will feel it harder.  And usually you release it when you feel like your ready, when you have a nice grip and shot|`|mff1vstNaa	It seems like you and your team are very young because there is no way that a whole high school aged basketball team shoots by their chests. <br>  <br>  anyways, to make a jumpshot. put your feet together, set the ball a little above your head, jump, shoot, follow through.|`|f1006988bdbdd7ae5e5276623f046308aa	Ok  bring the ball up in front of your right eye (if you are right handed) and start the jump. Keep bringing the ball up and release it at the top of your jump with both arms totally extended. In your mind picture the ball going threw the hoop. This is very important. Always picture the shot making it in your minds eye. Also inhale before your shot and exhale while taking the shot.|`|GERlmBIUaa	You should release in mid jump but most importantly shoot how you are most comfortable because if you see shawn marion's shot it is soo ugly but he can still make a shot...best answer plz|`|zLBDmcsnaa	Yeah you're doing it right & both can be a jumpshot. <br>  Yeah stay ballin ha. <br>  = ]|`|YtYoSH5Paa	Those are both jumpshots|`|UJFXamzzaa	Not really above your head.<br>  It's supposed to be about eye level with your chest directed at the basket and your elbow straightened out towards the hoop.<br>  <br>  The problem with shooting it from you chest is that it'll almost always be a set shot (picture someone jumping 2 feet in the air and shooting from the chest, it just looks wrong) and won't allow them to shoot in traffic in the paint and they'll be more likely to get blocked. See: Shawn Marion.<br>  <br>  The problem with shooting over your head is that when you jump, your extension will be so long that your more likely to have unnecessary movement, which will throw off your jump shot. So what happens is that too turns into a set shot. Thats why you see alot of centers with that shot way over their head, it allows them to shoot over people without having to jump. If you plan on being seven feet tall, that might pan out, otherwise go the middle route.<br>  <br>  A lot of younger kids shoot from their chest though, because it requires less upper body strength, so it extends their range. Of course, when they get older and stronger, they'll have to adjust to a real jump shot. <br>  <br>  It's probably best to get the mechanics right the first time and just work on getting stronger to extend your range then having a crappy jump shot you can shoot from far away. <br>  <br>  Look up ray allen or reggie miller on Youtube. <br>  They've got it about textbook.<br>  <br>  G'luck.|`|2r5xGAkUaa	a jump shot is really complicated to categorize since there are so many variables and factors that go into every shot a person takes. if someone is shooting from their chest, it may be because they have not developed the strength to release the ball from above their head. shooting from your chest brings more of your body muscles into the shot which allows you to shoot from further out, but it also brings the ball lower, allowing for defenders to block it easier. In general, with a regular jump shot, you would like to release at the peak of your jump. in terms of jumping and release point, like you pointed out, it can also depend on distance. when shooting from further out behind the arc, i'm talking about nba range, releasing while jumping gives you greater distance but this decreases accuracy. in general, most of my coaches have told me to release at the peak of your jump, before you start to come down. it all depends on what your most comfortable with. different release points work for different shots. try releasing the ball from way above/behind your head when you fade away, if you can get comfortable with this, fade shots become easier because your getting more power from your release and your shot becomes virtually unblock-able, much like kobe bryant's. try jumping fowards slightly when shooting from distance to get your legs more into it and allow your arms to work less. pull up midranges from the elbows off a dribble or jab step work best for shooting at the top of your release. sorry for rambling, hope this helped.|`|7ISUKu38aa	Many pros do it over their heads, however neither is wrong. younger kids do it at their chest because it takes less strength.|`|lhxe2XOeaa	u should shoot a jump shoot at the chest but i dont think u have to and u have to release as u go up because otherwise its called a travel|`|868namC6aa	whichever way works and is comfortable for you

THYOQ2nmaa	you can just purchase Ping G10<br>  Many people order that one|`|Ijjl5RRiaa	I'd definately go with a higher loft ie) 56 or 60. You can create so many more shots with those, like in the sand, or the rough and even in the fairway. But brandwise, ping is great, i have their touri wedges, but they dont give off much spin. If you want spin, the best wedges you can get are the spin doctor reverse groove wedges. You really spin the heck out of those babies.|`|BZFmSglEaa	go with a 52 and a 58 degrees......<br>  <br>  you will have consistent 6 degree gap from 46 to 52 and  from 52 to 58 degrees.<br>  <br>  58 degree is a VERSATILE club because you can adjust the clubface to play it as a 60 or 56 degree.|`|JSGLKnA4aa	52 deg gap 56 sand.|`|sBrummATaa	well i would go with the 54 degree wedge, and i would definitely go with titleist vokey. and for the driver: very nice|`|ajkMt6gRaa	Forget about Gaps.  It' s all about the course.  If you play a course with big greens you want lower lofts. If you have ltos of false fronts and less room on the greens you want the highe lofts cause typically you play more Lob shots.  <br>  <br>  If your game is bunt it down the course and you have a lot of 80 / 90 yard shots you will have to sqeeze distance ut of a sand wedge ( 56 ) ... especially if you are a little shorter player or if the wind is up.  I really think that s why the lower loft clubs  50 and 54 work well for Texas courses.  The greens are big.  You can still put proper spin on them. <br>  <br>  I see guys try to play with a 58 , but i fyou are not a 5 handicap or less, you probably don't need that club.  Just being honest!  <br>  <br>  I'm a short game fiend and I do play a 58 when i'm playing a firmer green ... or if I know the wind is blowing and the chances are that I'll b around the green but miss a lot of  GIR.  <br>  <br>  Just do what you think fits your game best.  If you are a bomber , higher lofts may work cause you typically willbe close to the green.  If you are more of a control player you will probably like to hit the low check shots or the precise yardages.

uKdf9xWBaa	Rinse the tackle box with a suspension of Bunker oil, 1 teaspoon in a bucket of water. That would leave a strong fishy smell. Also, make sure that your hands don't have any smell that would make fish shy away, i.e, perspiration, sun tan lotion, cigarette or tobacco smell.

There are 2 things you can get on your hands that will absolutely kill your ability to catch fish.  Make sure you do not gas up on the way there and wear gloves if you do.  If there is even a chance that you got a little gas on your hands go into the restroom and wash them several times.  The other biggy that I am religious about is bug spray.  I refuse to wear any at all anytime I am fishing.  If you get some on your hands and handle your bait or lures you might as well be casting up on land.  Even if you don't spray any near your hands if you scratch or swat where you did it will have the same effect.  Good luck!|`|AA11016927	In my opinion, it probably has more to do with either your casting ability, rigging ability, or what you were using for bait. <br>  <br>  The next time you go fishing pay special attention to HOW your neighbors are rigging their hooks and weights. <br>  <br>  Does their main-line appear heavier or lighter than yours? <br>    <br>  What type of lead weight are they using?<br>  <br>  What type of rig are they using?- <a href="http://www.tidalfish.com/Saltwater_Articles/p2_articleid/554" rel="nofollow">http://www.tidalfish.com/Saltwater_Artic...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tidalfish.com/Knots_Rigging/p2_articleid/31" rel="nofollow">http://www.tidalfish.com/Knots_Rigging/p...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.peacetoken.com/pt-rigs-croaker.html?gclid=CN-3vtGhi5kCFQO5GgodkQULlg" rel="nofollow">http://www.peacetoken.com/pt-rigs-croake...</a><br>  <br>  Perhaps using a "stealthier" rig might prove more effective??<br>  <br>  (Take a look at the diagram for the "Red Drum rig for the Pier".) - <a href="http://amelia-island-fishing.com/fishing/rigs/index.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://amelia-island-fishing.com/fishing...</a><br>  <br>  Are they using Flurocarbon leaders? <br>  <br>  (Flurocarbon line has the same refractive property's as water thus making it virtually invisible to fish.)- <a href="http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Product_10151_-1_10001_44287_100017002_100000000_100017000_100-17-2" rel="nofollow">http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores...</a><br>  <br>  WHERE are they casting? <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  If you totally feel it IS the tackle box and it's "funk", then go purchase another tackle box, (simple!).

Here is where I will stop and let you figure it out after I tell you this simple story.  I have been a commercial professional fisherman for 34 years, I now run the largest offshore charter company here on the Gold Coast Queensland, Australia. We constantly get people on board that cant get a bite and or catch a fish, many times its females.  So what I do is put some humour into it and say, "What did you do with your hands this Morning"  I usually get strange looks but then out comes the answers, women get out of bed, go to toilet, washhands with pretty smelling stuff and then they shower, putting on more pretty smelling soaps and gels etc, then they get out of the shower and put on their face stuff, make up etc and the perfumes and then the sunscreen etc etc etc , See where I am coming from and then we expect some dumb fish to come along and bite a bait that smells and tastes like a mixture of the make up and perfume section of your large department store, making sense, so have a look at what you you use your hands for before going fishing, and get rid of it. I get some pilchards or squid and get my people to squash it in their hands and that covers up the stuff that the fish most probably dont like.  Worth a try mate.|`|qU03Jegpaa	That sounds like the perfect excuse for dad to buy new tackle. If mom complains...gently explain that tackle boxes are not supposed to be "squeaky clean" and that it may be because of her that you aren't catching anything. Once the new stuff has been acquired...as Joe said..tell mom to keep her hands off of it.<br>  <br>  Along with all the new tackle, which can be pretty expensive, have dad pick up a dozen roses.

nooi0ldjaa	well, a cheap way to do it is just salt it. but its going to be hard and stiff when your done, not like a blanket or something. its pretty easy really, you skin it and nail it to a wooden bord, take a small razor and cut away everything that's not skin, (fat) once you've got it cleaned off really good, put a THICK layer of salt on it. leave it in a DRY bug-free area, for 3 days, then change out the salt, cut away any fat you missed (trust me, you'll miss some) and put salt on it again for 5 days this time. (you wanna do it right the first time right?) after your done, it should be stiff as a bord, and have no smell at all. then you can hang it on the wall.<br>  <br>  a good way to keep bugs off of it, is put plain old, black pepper over the layer of salt. a taxidermist told me about that one :)<br>  <br>  once your done, keep it dry. the hair should never fall out.<br>  for a fox your going to need a few pounds of salt, not just a hand full, trust me!<br>  <br>  edit: almost forgot, kosher salt only.<br>  edit2: all i know is it can't be iodized salt.<br>  something like the iodized part eats the skin or something. kosher works good, not sure about rock salt. table salt is no good though.<br>  <br>  since i did a small deer tail, i just bought 2 jars of non-iodized salt at wal-mart. but your going to need a bulk block. or you'll end up spending 20 on salt alone. just go for the "non-iodized".<br>  a taxidermist told me kosher salt works, but i didn't use it.|`|DHIudHy2aa	The freezing will have almost no effect, other than you will have to thaw it out, and the skin may be tougher to remove. I know this from experience, I just did a coyote that had been frozen for a week or two. It is now fleshed and sitting in a salt rub in a fridge at school. I won't go into detail about tanning however, because shooter already gave you straight forward instructions for that. I will be on here later to add some different tanning techniques if you really want them, but it is fairly late where I am and I want to go to bed.|`|bgxYKsGiaa	i just skin it and nail it up to the shed wall and put just table salt on thats the easiest and cheapest way to do it ....... and to get t smooth i just take my knife and put it on a barrel and shave it<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  or really what slip said is the same sorry|`|UrNVuFx6aa	I will assume you know how to skin the fox, Annie. So, I will start with the next step: fleshing the skin.<br>  The skin should be well-fleshed immediately after removal. If the skin is already removed when you get it fleshing will be more difficult, but can be made easier by swabbing the flesh side with a mixture of one ounce of borax in one gallon of water. Don't overdo it though; fox skins break down rapidly and hair slippage can occur. Once you have fleshed the skin rinse it very well to remove all traces of the borax.<br>  Fox skins are thin and can be tanned easily by several methods. One of the easiest is an alum tan.This method will work for a wall-hanging or rug. To do this method you need a container that will hold a little more than three gallons. A plastic five gallon bucket would work wonderfully. Mix three pounds of alum, three cups of salt and twelve ounces of washing soda into three gallons of hot water. Stir until all the solids are dissolved. Put in the fox skin and weigh it down with a stone or brick; the solution has to completely cover the skin. Stir the skin at least four times the first day and two or three times the next two days. In three days the skin should be tanned. You can check by slicing a small piece from the edge and see if the skin is the same color all the way through. If not, return it for another day and check again. If it is you are ready for the next step.<br>  After tanning in this mixture you will need to neutralize the acid in the skin. To do this mix three ounces of baking soda in three gallons of water. Soak the skin for an hour or so. Rinse it in clean water and squeeze out the excess water. Dry the hair with a blow dryer or by hanging the skin outdoors. While the skin is drying it will shrink unless you pull it by hand or attach it to a stretching frame. You can soften the tanned skin by rubbing it over a stake, table corner or other item or by tumbling it.<br>  <br>  Another method is using the foxes brain or the brains of other animals to tan the skin. To do this you will need the brain, or you can buy hogs brains from the grocery store.<br>  This is an easy method and is quicker than the alum tanning detailed above. I don't have my brain-tanning book available right now but here is a link to one method: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mullerslanefarm.com/braintan.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mullerslanefarm.com/braintan....</a><br>  <br>  Here is another that details and pictures an actual fox, from skinning to tanned:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.primitiveways.com/foxtan/Tanafox.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.primitiveways.com/foxtan/Tana...</a><br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  <br>  EDIT: You didn't say what part you had trouble understanding, but I will try again.<br>  Fleshing is the act of removing the little bits of flesh, fat and the inner membrane from the skin. When you flesh the skin it is easiest to do if you have a fleshing beam. This can be something as simple as a piece of PVC pipe about five feet long that can be propped up on a saw-horse or as elaborate as a long log or other material buried in the ground at about a 30 degree angle and extending to a height that is comfortable to work at. If using PVC make sure it is at least 6". 8" would be better but is not necessary. Take a knife and hold it on a slight angle with the cutting edge away from the direction of travel. Scrape the flesh side of the skin until the flesh, fat and the entire membrane is removed. If the membrane isn't removed entirely it will prevent the tanning solution from penetrating and working on the skin. This has to be done regardless of the tanning method you decide to use.<br>  Once this is completed you need to wash the skin to remove any dirt, blood, twigs, etc from both sides. When the hair and skin are both clean you can proceed.<br>  Mix the chemicals listed above in the proportions listed and stir into 3 gallons of hot water. Stir the water mixture until all the chemicals have dissolved completely. When the solution is ready you can proceed to the next step.<br>  The next step is to immerse the skin in the solution. The entire skin must be completely covered by the solution for the skin to tan properly. Place a clean stone or brick on top of the skin to hold it under the solution. Stir the skin at least four times the first time. More stirring will not hurt but does not speed the process up much. On the second and third days stir the skin/ solution at least two times per day. After the third day slice a small piese of the skin from the outer edge. If the skin is the same color all the way through it is completely tanned. If it is not the same color return it to the solution, place the stone back on top and stir it some more. Continue for another day or two and check again by slicing another small piece to check for completeness. Once the skin is thoroughly tanned you are ready for the next step.<br>  You are now ready to neutralize the acid that is present from the tanning process. To do this mix the three ounces of baking soda into three gallons of water. Submerge the skin in the solution for an hour or so, using the stone to hold it under the solution if necessary. After the hour is up remove the skin and rinse it in clean water. Using a minimum of three water changes and squeezing and rubbing the skin under the water you should have all the final solution removed. Once you have completed this step you can proceed to the next step.<br>  You need to dry the hair of the skin. This can be accomplished using a hair dryer or by hanging the skin out-of-doors. While the skin dries it shrinks. To prevent excessive shrinkage and to help it dry you can work the skin with a rounded piece of wood (a baseball bat works) or other item. Working the skin helps to force the water out of the hide, soften the skin and keep shrinkage to a minimum. Once the skin has been worked and is completely dry it is ready for you to use. <br>  <br>  If you want to make the skin somewhat bug-proof then smoke it over a smoldering pile of wood. The smoking process changes the color of the leather and makes it washable without having to re-work it after each washing since it will then dry soft and flexible. <br>  <br>  I hope this clears up some of the confusion I created.<br>  <br>  By the way, salting the skin does not tan the skin; it dries the skin and makes it hard and stiff. This will preserve it for a little while but does nothing to protect it from bugs, cats, dogs, etc. that may still find it appetizing to chew on. It also does not prevent the skin from rotting and smelling bad. If it is kept inside the whole room and possibly the entire house would soon smell like a rotten fox skin.
AA12325046	Interesting matchup sir, and I do not believe this one has been asked yet as far as I know anyway.  John L is generally recognized as the first champ and was legendry for his enormous strength and of course toughness.  Fighting for many years in the bard knuckle era was known for many tough fights against guys like Charley Mitchell, Paddy Ryan and Jake Kilrain.  Jack Dempsey was at one time a hobo that frequently fought in saloons starting off.  He developed a bob and weave style of fighting that was very effective and was also known for his power.  He demolished Jess Willard for the title and beat Georges Carpentier in one of the biggest fights of that time.  Neither man would have to look for the other in this fight.  I see Sullivan as more of a stand up style type of fighter that would look for openings.  With Dempsey he was more of a swarmer looking to land vicious punches to the head and body.   With both men in top shape, this would be an all out war.  I can see Dempsey wading in on the great John L and getting floored early in the fight, but coming back to bloody Sullivans nose.  Both men would inflict heavy damage as the fight progressed.  In round 8 Dempsey would surprise Sullivan with a low blow followed by a great left hook.  Fortunately for Sullivan the bell would ring ending the round.  Sullivan would clear his head in round 9 by holding and hitting which would both infuriate Dempsey and tire him out too.  By the 12th round neither man would have much left in the tank.  In the last round Dempsey would finish the round with a flurry of hard shots as the bell sounds ending a great fight.  Dempsey wins 8 rounds Sullivan 5 rounds with 2 even.  Dempsey by majority decision in a great fight.|`|b3e474d5e2b22c03370fe229c6f87ec1aa	Good match up, The Boston Strong Boy vs. The Manassa Mauler. <br>  <br>  I feel Dempsey takes this fight, and here's why:<br>  <br>  John L. got his start as a bare-knuckle fighter. Most bare-knuckle fighters used to stand straight up, and moved very little when trading punches. Sullivan's power was legendary - when you stood in front of him, he'd knock you out cold with one HARD shot to your chin. His weakness was against a fighter who could move, such as James J. Corbett, who knocked him out in 21 rounds back in 1893.<br>  <br>  Dempsey had massive power in his fists. He was also the first boxer I can recall who made the art of bobbing and weaving a stable. If you look at him and look at Mike Tyson, you can see how much they both bobbed and weaved and how it was tough for their opponents to land clean shots on them. <br>  <br>  Like I said earlier in this post, guys that could move gave Sullivan trouble, and bobbing and weaving was practically non-existent in those days. Dempsey would have mauled Sullivan much the way he mauled Jess Willard as a result.|`|4qBwXDvvaa	Floyd mayweather|`|kqP7GwOcaa	Great question, I wish I could give it a thumbs up.  I actually sat here for a while thinking about it, and it is a really tough call.  I think the lack of video on John L would hurt him in comparison to any reasonably modern fighter, and lets face it, Dempsey's fight with Firpo is epic.  I think Dempsey would do enough to win a 15 rounder, but reality is John L could easily go three times that distance, redefining "toughness" by any standard.  Great question.  Could Dempsey go 45 rounds with John L and survive?  Unlikely but possible.<br>  <br>  As phrased, Dempsey by decision, but in an alley with nobody around to break them, the Hobo gets mugged.|`|dh48AkbCaa	dempsey's bob and weave style and his power makes all the difference, and i believe he ko's sullivan by the 10th round.
vnYhL5ZXaa	I'm kind of surprised myself! I didn't expect the A's to sign anyone this offseason, but they already got Matt Holliday, Jason Giambi, Orlando Cabrera, and others. I honestly thought we were just gonna lose players, but hopefully they have a chance especially since they have to compete with the Angels in the AL West|`|AA10263761	There the Mini Yankees on the West Coast<br>  <br>  Which is why i have been telling people if teams really wanted to spend more money they could|`|qsWk3Fo6aa	The A's will always be competitive.  Beane knows how to use his Sabremetrics.  However they will not win the World Series.  They will make the playoffs and then lose.  Angels have gotten worse and the Mariners and Rangers stink.

UzhfaJH2aa	Telqvist is not going to steal any games for you, but won't be responsible for losing any either. He makes all the routine stops but nothing spectacular. He's a good backup goalie that you can depend on when needed. <br>  Dominic Moore is a hard working guy who can score. Again, doesn't do anything spectacular, but was the most consistent player the Leafs had this year. A good checker, responsible in his own end, he'll be a good fit for the Sabres.<br>  Basically the Sabres got Moore and Telly for Kotalik and a 2010 fourth rounder. I'd say they did ok.|`|jB1fesmwaa	actually got more worse than better!!! <br>  <br>  1)Tellqvist isnt a big deal!!!<br>  <br>  2)They got rid of a good sniper (Ales Kotalik)--- But 2nd rd. pick is ok<br>  <br>  3)Shouldnt have traded that 2nd rd. pick....Dom Moore is a minor player, he is nothing big!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  LOOK AT NY RANGERS.....

I like this trade, as Moore is slightly younger, and rapidly improving, has a better upside.<br>  <br>  Get Tellqvist for a 4th rounder: Trade a late pick for a solid backup. Works for me.<br>  <br>  I would have liked them to make more of a push to the playoffs, but did improve as a team, hopefully enough to get into the postseason.

xQFWjFyZaa	"Feb 27 CF Vernon Wells re-injured his left hamstring and will be out of action anywhere from two to four weeks. That's the same hamstring that Wells injured last July causing him to miss 25 games. The question that pops to mind is: Will Wells be battling hamstring problems for the remainder of his career and will it mean he'll have to shift positions and move out of center field? It's a question that manager Cito Gaston has pondered. "I mean, you might have some concern, but what can you do about it?" Gaston said. "No matter what you do, you can't protect it. Baseball is a game of quick starts and stops. "The only thing you can do is play like we played as kid sometimes, let him DH and have somebody run for him. Otherwise you're just going to have to take a chance, that's all." <br>  <br>  I'll take Pence and the lower injury risk.|`|eSL9tWnQaa	It's a solid deal.

The first thing that comes to mind is Two Man Power Trip.<br>  <br>  Jack Swagger and Charlie Haas (or Shelton Benjamin): 2 or 3 great wrestlers together in a tag team or stable with and American Hero gimmick would be reminiscent of Team Angle.

Possibly a tag team rivalry over the IC title. But CM Punk siding with Jericho in an attempt to purify himself and stay away from the "hypocrite" label would draw heat on Punk but also launch his career if it worked. Also the "honest man" gimmick would allow him to launch his straight edge gimmick also.<br>  <br>  Tyson Kidd and Evan Bourne: Most likely the only two guys who can make tag team wrestling extremely relevant.

GyGhHpRraa	What makes it funny, is not only was it for Leclaire... <br>  <br>  It was for Leclaire AND a second round draft pick, haha.  I, however, believe Vermette is a VERY good player.  I think he just didnt fit right in Ottawa.  If you're a Jackets fan, I think you will be pleased.|`|XQoH9ZI5aa	No. It makes PERFECT sense, with the emergence of Steve Mason they were happy just to get someone to take the Leclaire contract off of their hands. He makes 3.6M next year followed by 4.8M the following year !!!!<br>  <br>   Amber......Vermette is a player who just never progressed (might have regressed a little).........maybe a change of scenery will help.<br>  <br>   This deal helps both teams, Columbus rids the big contract and Ottawa gets a starting goalie.|`|PtRmhxU9aa	I doubt it, LeClaire is a great G-man... when he's healthy. The problem with his erratic style though is that it lends itself to injury.|`|WshIrCo2aa	No, not really.  It was no secret that they wanted to get rid of him, since the kids they have now are significantly better, and get paid less.  Leclaire was set to make 3.6 million next year, which would have almost obligated the Jackets to start him over the younger, better, Mason.  All things considered, I think they did ok.|`|pUus16BYaa	Yes, he is actually a very great goaltender when he stays out of injury. To see him traded for a guy that only has 9 goals made me think... he probably could have gone to the Leafs for Antropov who has 20 goals, hell the second round pick would have done it...|`|Uathep5Yaa	No with Mason playing so well, everyone knows who is #1 in Columbus
0HOGn7njaa	fartlek training. its a goofy name but a great workout for runners! we used to do them for lacrosse. <a href="http://www.brianmac.co.uk/fartlek.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.brianmac.co.uk/fartlek.htm</a>|`|e37b10dd9e41a3d4d901feab990b7e9daa	Most people who run slow are running improperly. Below are some get techniques for running. I have seen some "chicken legged" people run very fast. Maybe not run powerfully but fast. They this:<br>  <br>  Use proper technique. Running with good form, such as standing tall and keeping your head, feet and toes up, is one of the easiest fundamentals to change in order to sprint faster, and can help to eliminate muscle and joint injuries. <br>  <br>  Improve your starting stance. In order to determine which foot goes first in the starting block, stand upright with your feet together and have someone slightly push you from the back. Whichever foot moves first, this should be your rear or "quick" foot<br>  <br>  Perfect your first step. Having an explosive step out is key to learning to sprint faster. You can do this by practicing several starts and videotaping it for review. Use the tape to determine if your leg angle is correct, which should be about 45 degrees, or if your stride is too long, which makes you lose speed<br>  <br>  Bring your heels near or in contact with your behind. At this point, your thigh should be parallel to the ground and not pointed down. And be sure you are using a circular, not an elliptical, motion when your foot leaves the ground. <br>  <br>  Pull your toes and feet up towards your shin as soon as your feet leave the ground. This is dorsiflexion and helps you to sprint faster by causing the calf muscle to contract and propel the body forward. <br>  <br>  Strengthen your legs with various weight machines and exercises. Skipping for height or distance, doing squats or calf/toe raises with weights are good strength exercises for sprinting. <br>  <br>  Train with people who are faster than you. If you are training by yourself or with someone who is slower, you're going to be less likely to push yourself to sprint harder.<br>  <br>  Was in top 5 of state, 100m, a three years of high high school.|`|FpUPEJZyaa	you have to try out for your track team? wow, that's weird. well just start off with jogging for about 4 days, you know, get your body back into it. the next 4 days take it up a notch. then the next 4 days, jog for about 30 seconds, then sprint for about 10 seconds. do that for about 3 mins or something. then relax then do it again. the for the next for days just sprint all the way.<br>  <br>  g'luck|`|iVAR3Osfaa	Wrong spot... BUT i'll help you. Do you live in an area with telephone poles? Well each one is about 30-40 yards apart. I did this for football and it greatly improved my speed.<br>  <br>  Monday: Sprint from one pole to another and walk to the next. Continue this. Do around 15 sprints and walk 15. <br>  <br>  Tuesday: Sprint from one pole then skip a pole then stop at the next. Sprint ten times and walk ten.<br>  <br>  Wednesday: Sprint from one pole to the next and JOG one pole. DONT WALK!!! Do 22 sprints and 22 jogs. This is about a mile.<br>  <br>  Thursday: Sprint 5 poles and walk 5. This is supposed to be easy after a tough workout.<br>  <br>  Friday: Do the Wednesday workout. A hard workout b4 a long break.<br>  <br>  Sat and Sun: Take a break. 2 days recovery!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps! Continue this during track unless its too tiring.|`|aHhRzaF7aa	I run sprints, so heres what i do. Get good at your launch! Thats the secret right there, so practise it over and over jst crouch and start. If you want to increase the power of your quads too, try running heel taps(where you run whilst tapping your heels to your ***) try it up a steep hill. be warned, itll make u knackered bt by god it works. <br>  <br>  <br>  Hope i've halped and good luck for the trials bud|`|Et00egktaa	don't be lazy try google|`|p2HHFTufaa	Ummm..... work out early in the mornings....eat breakfast, lunch, dinner, sleep.

Both these guys have had very successful coaching carers. They always coach a major playoff contender no matter what they are given. Sloan deserves huge credit this year. He formed a very talented Utah Jazz team with most of the major stars injured for a good part of the year. Deron Williams, Carlos Boozer and Andrei Kirilenko were injured for a long time, yet the Jazz still won games. I believe he deserves coach of the year this year. It is a shame he hasn't won it yet.<br>  As for best team, it is hard to say. I think the Lakers are the most well rounded. The Celtics have the big three, and Orlando is playing well especially with Alston joining the team. I also have to say to Jazz are a contender this year because now that they have their main player back, they will be a feared team come playoffs. The Cavs are playing very well. LeBron should lead them deep in the playoffs.<br>  Western Conference Finals<br>  Utah Jazz Vs. Los Angeles Lakers<br>  .<br>  Eastern Conference Finals<br>  Boston Celtics Vs.

RyZHhI6aaa	well, it depends on what you mean by bad.  50-1 is going to pay you a lot of money if the horse wins.  However, 50-1 also means that the horse is not very likely to win the race.<br>  <br>  The lower the odds, the better chance the horse has to win.  So 1-9 is the absolute best possible horse while 99-1 is the worst horse.  But remember that the odds are only what the other handicappers think of a horse.  Handicappers can be wrong so if you think that a horse can win the race, it's all the better if the odds are higher because you'll win more money that way.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	50-1 is awful.  Generally, with the size of the field (20 horses) and the fact that you have several really good horses, your favorite will go off around 7-2.|`|cddb16aa82a34a10ef1d3b4255960a9faa	50-1 is bad if put down $100 on a 50-1 odds, you will get back<br>  5000|`|ho0XRinGaa	If the horse has the remotest chance of winning or coming each way, you're getting an amazing deal!|`|X7aO14m7aa	Uh no... 1-1 would be the best odds.  Are you kidding me?|`|wAy9lXPTaa	uhh thats kinda iffy|`|AA10130923	1/1 odds are the best then it goes up from there anywhere up to 99/1. The lower the odds(1/1,7/2,5/1) are the Favorites that the odds makers(handicappers) think have the best chance to win. The higher odds(30/1,50/1) are considered the Long Shots. The numbers represent the amount of winnings per wager so $2 on a 50/1 long shot will get you $100. But don't let the odds decide your bet in the 2005 K.Y.Derby Giacomo won at 50.30/1 and paid $102.60 per $2 bet!!!

Rex plans on a heavy run game so I wouldn't mind another RB to go in the mix. If Thomas Jones gets hurt, there is no depth behind him. Yes, Leon Washington is a good back, but not an every down back. I don't believe he can handle it by himself. I'd like Knowshon Moreno or maybe a WR.|`|9to0vRbhaa	yeah probably in the draft though|`|ZrnSwqrIaa	jets dont have many glaring holes on offense.  what many people forget is that this team finished very high this year in points scored.  the rushing game is solidified and the line is solid.  im hoping that kellen clemens is handed the ball to be qb this year.  that leaves the wr position.  jets have cotchery but not a speedy reciever.  i was hoping we would sign houshmanzadah but since we didn't im looking for the draft.  ive heard rumors that crabtree has significantly dropped in the rankings because of his injury.  some people are even predicting he falls all the way down to 17 (prob. not gonna happen).  im hoping that the jets actually trade down to grab crabtree at around #7-9, hoping he falls that far.  aside from him i dont see the jets making anymore moves on either side of the ball, at least nothing that would impact the starters.
CnNAOoWgaa	It always bothers me when people criticize Maria's personality because in all the years I've watched her, she's always been the sweetest and most gracious of people on and off the court.  She is frankly one of the nicest people I've ever seen in tennis and that's all the more amazing given her beauty, fame, and fortune.  I only wish all the young starlets of this world could be as sweet and humble as her!  She does come across as very focused and serious on court but that's part of what makes her one of the top players.  Maria has a wonderful personality and she deserves all the success in the world.  I have never ever seen her be rude or unfriendly to anyone during an interview or an umpire during a match.|`|eEXz9KG6aa	To tell you the truth i don't know why, because she's actually a sweet girl. Maybe they think shes attitudinal because they're comparing her to ivanovic. i prefer maria's attitude than that fake ivanovic...come on ever1 gotta be feisty|`|aTBs7pJ4aa	i think she is very materialistic and showey.. glamour type.... but who could blame her with all that money and star power..<br>  <br>  <br>  but i bet she would be a cool person... nice girl... good girl|`|M0kD9UFeaa	Because she is XD|`|zjzq6VS3aa	She thinks as if she is has some beautiful body...  She is just a thin chocobar stick without ice cream...|`|75ZMWlnnaa	she does appear feisty on the court, and so it is very easy for people to judge her and say that she has a full-on attitude. they do not understand that sharapova is a very focused and determined player when she is on the court.<br>  <br>  off the court, i think she just likes to be left alone, but u have the media full stalking her all the time, i do not blame her for looking sour-faced at press conferences.<br>  <br>  i just think that with sharapova, what you see is what you get, she is NOT a phony, and that is why im a fan of hers.|`|TKQZUhPBaa	i guess its the way she carries herself on court, kinda intense no matter what, barely ever smiles on court. of court i rekon shes a great person.<br>  i dont think the grunting helps her attitude image either
4i133cAVaa	There are different pistol permit limitations in NYS. Many county's are different. If your in the city your up s**t creek. When I applied I could choose either carry conceal, sportsman and then there were other limitations like for work only or home only(I think there were a few more). Even though it is a state permit the county's are the ones issuing them (some are better than others) and every county's paper work is different. When you apply for a carry conceal you will need to fill out what is called a "proper cause" form. Basically "Why do you need personal protection 24/7?". If you can honestly fill out the proper cause form as to convince a judge than good job. Otherwise they will either down grade it to a sportsman or lower, or just plan disapprove it. My father and i applied at the same time and because i was able to do a better job with my proper cause form i got CC and he only got sportsman ( it is also nice when you send military certificates showing training for weapons safety and range safety, even awards showing responsibility). Your best bet for answers to permit questions is contact the issuing authority for your county and ask. They only have a job if people are getting permits (I found Onondaga County's pistol permit unit to be very helpful). My suggestion is to always apply for CC and let them down grade it. You may get lucky and get a CC.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	You'll probably have to get a carry permit.  Good luck with that in the Vampire State.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	N.Y.S. has different levels of license.<br>  Posses, carry, and concealed carry.<br>  You have to take a course to get one, and part of the course <br>  will explain the Laws.<br>  Depending on your County of residence it can be easy <br>  or near impossible to get concealed carry.|`|WcLpltHNaa	you need a licence

Run.|`|NRiSJewTaa	there are hella ways to train every part of your game... when i work on my shooting i play around the world with myself.... since my court is in my huge backyard, i get to be more creative....|`|Bwosoy7jaa	just go shoot around by yourself from everywhere until you can shoot it perfectly, if you can hit almost anything you well be the best. Everyone has a different shooting style so work on your own dont try to copy anyone else.

Jr9j5f6naa	How we would we know if your a good runner or not..? o.0<br>  <br>  umm I would say try out. If you've never it, there's going to be people there better than you. But there will also be people worse. I also bet no one is going to laugh. Athletes usually get looked upon badly if they make fun of people, and the coaches would probably kick them out anyway. So do it!! If your a good sprinter, you'd probably be good at the 400, 100, or 200. (1 lap, 1/4 lap, and 1/2 lap) <br>  <br>  By the way, when I tried out for track I thought I was a great sprinter, but I ended up being put in long distance because I did cross country. So don't be upset if you get long distance, it get easier pretty fast!|`|H0knYRKbaa	you should do distance because distance is awesome. sprinters suck. and hurdlers are gay. distance is where its at.<br>  <br>  P.S-(jk sprinters and hurdlers)
pR3mmJ3iaa	You can usually find laws specific for your state if you Google "skateboarding laws/surfing laws for (your state)".  That's probably the best way to find updated laws.  I've done the same thing regarding car safety requirements like window tinting and taillights.|`|yRPYuJhsaa	Ask a lifeguard or police officer. As far as books go, I think laws are changed to often to be put in a public library book.|`|8994a4fa814ed13f79ff6c5f35a79d69aa	buy a new book

u8GHTJEEaa	One player to start at each of the following positions: Point Guard, Shooting Guard, Small Forward, Power Forward, and Center and a backup for each. The guards are known as the back court because they usually play further from the basket. The forwards and center are called the front court because they usually play closer to the basket. Also recommended is a third guard and a third power forward/center. Last but not least is the head coach, who draws up plays, runs practices, manages players' minutes, and yells at the officials (when necessary). The head coach usually has 1-3 assistant coaches, but there is no limit on the number. The assistant coaches are responsible for helping to run practices, and managing various statistics such as player fouls (personal and technical), timeouts left, player availability,  and team fouls during the game. The assistant coaches are also responsible for restraining the head coach from going after the official and the players on the bench from going on to the floor, should things get heated.|`|C4mzZwiWaa	how they feel with each other if they get enough ball time(no homo) playing time also it makes them feel good when they have playing time.|`|qsWk3Fo6aa	I believe its having a guy on the team that you run the offense through.  Either a point guard or someone who can make good decisions.  Also, unselfish play.
pUus16BYaa	They won't if they don't start playing Conk considering Osgood has the worst stats in the league... it only makes sense to play Conk.|`|9GzkVwfGaa	Sharks vs. Ducks...|`|KyCJOR2paa	New Jersey is scary, but I would take it and it would be a great series to watch.  I would be happy with them beating anyone though.  Personally I don't think the Wings will win it all this year, nor will I be extremely upset if they don't.  This is because they have been legit contenders every year since 1993, and they have 4 Cups in the last 11 seasons.  Another Cup would be AWESOME, but I'm just glad we still have a competitive team, unlike other recent Cup Final winners and losers.  Hopefully they can stay reasonably healthy and can go the distance again.  GO WINGS!!!!!<br>  <br>  Keep dreamin' for a Finals berth Pens fans... it ain't gonna happen.  But of course we don't expect you guys to give up hope, that would be anti-bandwagonism.|`|x7NtYD8Aaa	haha. Well i must say Ozzie has been steppin up his game(knock on wood). And idk how much of it would be revenge, but yeah it would be nice to beat em. As long as my boy Hossa comes back we will dominate. <br>  GO WINGS!|`|c69svim5aa	The Stanley Cup Finals will be Pittsburgh vs. Red Wings! Pittsburgh will get revenge! We will win!<br>  <br>  LETS GO PENS!|`|kcJeZPvbaa	sharks vs bruins|`|Cc1cBCgXaa	I don't know if I see jersey going to the finals (im a devils fan...so maybe im just trying not to jinx it lol)<br>  but I think our defensive unit is a little inexperienced as far as the playoffs go, though havelid is a good pick up. And while we have raised our offensive levels this year, we have gone several games where we get 40+ shots and maybe 1 goal? or 40+ shots and end up getting shut out.

Not that hard.|`|2hHHKTwNaa	your dad isnt you personally d end is a funner and all around better position though n i play linebacker for my jr high team even though d linemen dont make that many tackles people will respect you and you will feel like a champ good luck|`|nfLd3ngraa	Tight ends are big targets.

DL8d8pViaa	i did all stars for 2 1/2 years. honestly they price depends on your gym and how many competitions they do and how many are nationals. i paid quite a bit but my team did quite a bit of out of state competitions plus worlds. i also did a lot of extra tumbling and privates. i can't remember how much but uniforms are usually around $100, travel over $1000, and competition fees are about $100-$200.<br>  <br>  its adds up pretty quick. but gyms usually offer some sort of scholarship if you really need. plus they fundraise for competition and travel cost. if they are not getting a new uniform next year you can get an old one from someone who either quit or out grew their uniform. and see if there are anything around the gym they could have you do to cut cost. or if all else fails go to your parents for more work around the house that maybe they pay someone to do.<br>  <br>  they way me and my mom convinced my dad (he wasn't to hot about the all star thing) was to look at what other skills this will give you. cheer help builds confidence and that is important. it will also give you leadership experience and ways to handle high pressure situations (try having to change your routine 15 minutes before you compete) all stars gives you more chances to meet all kind of people. first off your on a team with people not from your school and maybe not even your state. on top of that you meet all kind of people at nationals. a lot of cheerleaders go on to be CEO's and high powered people in the work place.<br>  <br>  hope you are able to do this. all star cheer was probably one of the best experiences i have ever done.

When the fans see there team using the product, they will buy it to, therefore the company makes lots of money.|`|XLXncQu9aa	To make money.  I know what you may be thinking, these companies don't fit the team. However it is a money issue.  Since the Redskins are located in the MD/DC area, many of those companies have customers that work in federal agencies since DC is known for government employment.  But overall it is about money.

They don't know crap about b-ball.|`|cJfWkt4Daa	all celtics and cavs fans are dumber than turkeys. enough said.|`|JD5NQxeNaa	Well I do not like the Celtics at all. I like and admire the Big 3 and House and feel indifferently towards Rondo and absolutely hate Marbury and the entire team in general. Last year I rooted for Cleveland against them and hope leveland could beat them, but to be honest the Celtics even though KG is out have every right to be confident because they are the defending champs and did contain LBJ23 in the first 2 games of that series a year ago.<br>  <br>  Not to mention that Atlanta is the only uptempo team left in the NBA and being the most athletic team in the NBA Atlanta and uptempo teams in general frustrate the Celtics. Thus, it does not matter if Boston barely beat the Bulls cause they are an uptempo team and like last year when the Celts barely beat the Hawks they did win a title, so 1st round matchups aren't indicative of how the rest of the playoffs will turn out.<br>  <br>  Orlando and Cleveland have a lot of talent and are far better teams than the Bulls and maybe even the Hawks. Although, thinking the Hawks could not beat and eliminate the Cavs is foolish for their system provides them w. a chance to do so.<br>  <br>  Orlando and Cleveland are half-court set teams, like Boston - so they will take Boston to 6-7 based on pure talent level. The Hawks would take Boston the distance, like they did a season ago and like the Bulls did this year based on young talent and their uptempo style that the Celts as a vet team are too old to match. Cavs and Magic have a better chance of playing away from their half-court set, but an Atlanta can pose a threat for them too. Boston is hoping that Atlanta would lose the series against Cleveland cause of the matchup difficulties Atlanta presents them.|`|vFbzBo4eaa	Hahahahahha,Celtics fans are funny.<br>  <br>  When the Lakers had the league record and they were way to strong there weren't any eltics fans.When they lost 2 times from the Lakers,they weren't here too<br>  <br>  Now,they barly passed the Bulls and here they are<br>  <br>  Celtics own the NBA is a sh*t|`|dFacbjIZaa	Celtics own the NBA is a fact, historically speaking|`|ZdNSSm0waa	Celtics own the NBA is a piece of sh*t|`|XM694gv6aa	They have 3 superstars and just won a ring.|`|uFk8ohenaa	dk

oAjbBLDpaa	I don't think it will hurt RAW too much but it will definitely boost TNA. Cena has been shown to increase ratings by a small yet significant amount so it will give TNA an extra step up.|`|bjNAbDO3aa	dude he wouldnt be in tna cuz he wouldnt get pushed there is two requirements in tna to get pushed its either your over 40 and your pushed and the other one is you have to be able to wrestle and your pushed.|`|bzUBiwTYaa	john cena, batista, and triple h are the only three real wrestlers wwe has left.|`|zw8MtELCaa	I wouldnt mind if he went to TNA.<br>  Let him go and destroy it like he's destroyed the WWE.|`|Hp40PucSaa	if cena goes to tna i will shoot him and sale his body parts to people.|`|hfEGHKePaa	If John Cena went to TNA...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EPIC FAIL

e197cb3f4211de6521dcc6f8afc0358caa	He's just hit a rough patch, and Lampard's really at his very best, so it makes Ballack look worse than he is.<br>  <br>  I think his injury got to him. But he has come up with 3 crucial goals this season, and many crucial winners in the seasons before (Porto, Blackburn, United). He's definitely an asset. As CFC says, he covers more ground than anyone else, and the German team are benefiting from Ballack's higher level of fitness that comes with playing in the Premiership. Joachim Low said it was the Prem and the lungs it gave Ballack that has made him better.<br>  <br>  Ballack needs to step it up. He's not firing on all cylinders, and if he doesn't step it up fast, Essien will be replacing him, not Mikel (like everyone's expecting). Mikel's had a great season, his coming of age you can say.|`|mK06dus9aa	I think he is a little in awe of playing alongside Frank Lampard. He does need to raise the level of his game. I hope he manages to do so.|`|0dTXkBopaa	dude,<br>  he doesnt suck<br>  hes having a bad season<br>  last season was awsm.<br>  why would a guy who "sucks" be the german captain.|`|PrsbAjZAaa	If it wasn't for Ballack we never would of beat Blackburn , United , Fenerbahce , even South End if he hadnt of got the equaliser<br>  <br>  <br>  age has nothing to do with it , Defour is Belgiums Captain , and he's only 20 or something<br>  <br>  <br>  Torsten Frings could be Germanys Captain , or Lehmann before he retired<br>  <br>  <br>  Ballack whether he plays well or not , gives 100% , he runs more than any other players in the whole team , against Juventus he ran something like 10.86 km , and the squad average was 8km , he does more than you think.|`|632BbbUtaa	yes. he does. hes old and hes is a dirty player.|`|TxVAXBpTaa	agree.. Ballack is getting fat, lazy, and useless...|`|no3tD0OSaa	So you're saying that a player has a bad run of form, he's ****?|`|2zTX5qpSaa	He's not playing so well this season but we cannot blame him or any other player for the bad performance of Chelsea. It's the fault of the whole team, the previous coach, Kenyon and Abramovich.|`|Bgty97dDaa	no, i respect ballack he is a good player , maybe he dont like to play with chelsea any more , and ingeries , when he play to german he play well - in my opinoin - at least that what u asked for|`|hlnNZ9N4aa	No he just is not scoring very much. He is injured and still getting over it. If you watch games he has many good passes and defends well so I do not think he sucks.|`|8QxVjXUxaa	disagree. hiddink is already getting the best out of him. that is why deco is still in the bench|`|AA11114139	Hate the bastard kill the bastard eat the bastard!!|`|U23DRFtbaa	Disagree|`|694149338c32706629cae99071e6b1daaa	you suck! he is the sh!t. reason why doesn't shine in chelsea is because of lampard
MjPd9vyYaa	Uhh I personally don't like that line up.<br>  <br>  EPL - Man Utd ( as usual )<br>  Ligue 1- don't watch<br>  Bundesliga- don't watch<br>  Serie A- Inter<br>  La Liga- Barca|`|cf4d6d60fab75efc136a4d66dd5c03b4aa	Yes, in football manager<br>  <br>  2<br>  Manchester United<br>  Lyon<br>  1899 Hoffenheim<br>  Inter<br>  Madrid|`|oNR7il8baa	Yes there can. <br>  <br>  Premier League? Man United<br>  Ligue 1? Lyon =\ <br>  Bundesliga? Hamburg!!! <br>  Serie A? Inter<br>  La Liga? Barca =\|`|7Xridrxaaa	yes there is teams that have used a 3-6-1. I think it originated in Brazil if i am not wrong. Sao Paulo i think.. not sure but when they came up with that in the libertadores a lot of teams had no answer for it. 6 people in the midfield is a substantial amount if you ask me haha.<br>  <br>  2nd question-Who do you thinks will win?<br>  Premier League? Man U<br>  Ligue 1? Marseille (yes i believe haha)<br>  Bundesliga? Hamburg (jol is doing the trick)<br>  Serie A? Inter<br>  La Liga? Barcelona|`|KmMRHKTNaa	Ye like this<br>  <br>  -------Gk-----<br>  ----RWB----CB---LWB<br>  ---------CDM------<br>  ---RM---CM---CM--LM<br>  ----------CAM---------<br>  --------------ST------<br>  CAM=Central Attacking Midfielder<br>  CDM=Central Defensive Midfielder<br>  RM,LM= Right or Left Mid<br>  CM=Central Mid<br>  ST: Striker<br>  RWB and LWB= Right or Left Wing Back<br>  CB: Center Back<br>  GK= goal keeper<br>  <br>  Premier League-Manchester United<br>  Ligue1- Lyon but Marseille giving up good fight<br>  Bundesliga- Bayern Munich. Hoffenheim currently 1st place<br>  Serie A- Inter Milan have like a 9pt Lead<br>  La Liga- Barcelona, but 4pts separate them from 2nd place Real Madrid.|`|8UOkX4Jnaa	Yeah but its crazy!<br>  <br>  Premier League? Man united<br>  Ligue 1? Lyon<br>  Bundesliga? Hamburg<br>  Serie A? Inter:(((<br>  La Liga? Barca|`|IWM1khX7aa	I guess you can do that.  3 center backs, 2 defending midfielders, 2 outside midfielders, 2 attacking midfielders, and 1 striker.  <br>  <br>  EPL- Man U<br>  Ligue1-Lyon (like they have in the past 7 years)<br>  Bundesliga- Bayern Munich<br>  Serie A- Inter<br>  La Liga-Barcelona|`|M9Hh6MPpaa	1. yes there can be all kinds of formations, who knows if they'll work though<br>  '<br>  2. Prem League -- Man U<br>      Ligue 1 -- Lyon<br>      Bundesliga -- Bayern Munich<br>      Serie A -- Inter<br>      La Liga -- Barcelona|`|VDh1fcGIaa	Yup whatever coach thinks works best for team. But professionally you don't really see that lineup at all.<br>  <br>  Premier League? ManU<br>  Ligue 1? Lyon<br>  Bundesliga? HSV<br>  Serie A? Inter<br>  La Liga? Barcelona|`|D6RSJ1BNaa	Who cares who will win those leagues.  What matters is who will win this year's Club World Cup|`|J89NekHyaa	1. yes<br>  2. Serie A
wKnjGSU1aa	I think he should, he has been working very hard, he's been on a very good form, not just now, but for a while now, since last tournament. He's still got good enough speed, good enough stamina, very good free kick, very good leadership, and has good enough skills, his legs don't shake for a few boos thrown at him.|`|qbPbvLuLaa	He deserved to be called up but I think his age is one of the reasons he isn't being called up.|`|8zgFyfibaa	Morales is a great player, but he won't get called up soon maybe never again. <br>  <br>  I mean when guardado got injured why dint eriksson call up morales?? I wish eriksson did but as much as we want him he won't get called up no more.<br>  <br>  or maybe he's being a real leader and letting new players play in el tri.|`|Epmny08zaa	I Think He Should Play For El Tri...His Free Kicks Are Crazy! <br>  <br>  I Say He Should Play <br>  <br>  Along With <br>  <br>  Cuauhtemoc Blanco <br>  Juan Carlos (EL TOOORRRRIIIITTTOOOO!!!!!) Silva <br>  Omar Arellano <br>  Michel (3rd Goaly) <br>  Oscar Rojas <br>  <br>  SHOULD GET CALLED TO LA SELECCION|`|Cpm25Pekaa	The reason Erickson doesn't put Blanco, Borgetti, Ramon, etc. Is that those players will most like ly not make it to the World Cup anymore, and now is the time to use the future.|`|vgf15dMjaa	i dont even have to watch the video to tell you:<br>  <br>  Hell Yeah!!|`|pSOmwwlIaa	Right now all the Cruz Azul people like Hatecrew gonna come here and say it should be Jimmy Lozano. Lozano ain't the same player anymore. He's wasted and burned out. All he's got left is the free kicks and some other game play like passes.<br>  <br>  Morales on the other hand can still play en El Tri. I think he's the best option to replace Guardado and only option. I think he can replace Guardado easily. Though what Guardado has that Morales doesn't have is that Guardado is young. Also Guardado is faster than him. But I still think Morales should be in El Tri.|`|c7931bb97511f819bc3df45abd39f170aa	yeah he is worthy of playing with el tri... he has been one of the best wingers Mexico has produce.... even though he is closed to retiring he still has the potential to play with Mexico..... <br>  <br>  He did a great job playing during the 2006 fifa world cup.... Him and Andres Guardado at wingers caused Argentina a lot of trouble|`|TkKHIoPIaa	Ofcourse he already plays for the best team in Mexico how can you not want him sending in those corners ! <br>  <br>  <br>  Chivas future campiones de LIBERTADORES!!!!!!!!!!!|`|eWadjRfpaa	I think EL TORITOOOOOOOOOOO might be better.|`|8ucq6SEjaa	that was a nice video of him.<br>  he should definately get called up to la seleccion.<br>  <br>  he's Awesome(:|`|qOOU1EVlaa	of course!!!..hahaha..hehe hes oone of my favorite players((HE FRM mICHoACAN))|`|9KbU8jPRaa	hell yea but you know thats not going to happen  puro michoacan

KNTofuxMaa	I like Ray and think he would be a welcome addition, if nothing else, for the leadership attributes. However, our problem wasn't all defensive. The offense was completely out of sync. Lewis won't help that much.<br>  <br>  Yeah I know, Joseph... Some teams buy the referees. Ahem... *cough* Steelers *cough*.|`|b64219f408e63daa3f8c2cba4d84a232aa	No...I do not want him on my team.<br>  Terrell Owens,I don't think, gets along with Ray Lewis.<br>  I think he should stay with the Ravens.<br>  Ray Lewis hates Owens as well. [since along time ago]<br>  You thought people were trying to make trouble for Dallas................................wa... till  Lewis comes.<br>  NO!!! I HATE HIM|`|6X1JsvfBaa	i hope he does.<br>  <br>  Im not much of a leader...everyone is calling me Snuggles now...<br>  they are calling me coach snuggles...i cant cope with this.<br>  <br>  So I think a good ole guy like Ray Lewis will be a good leader... I think he may be the only guy who can shut up TO|`|xDDNCKvlaa	I really hope he come to Dallas. If we have Ray Lewis, Demarcus Ware, Bradie James, and maybe another linebacker (if Thomas isn't with Dallas next year, I hope he's not) then that would be scary.|`|WaaFCtuOaa	He may help the defense but one problem, Tony Romo is still going to be the starting QB & is good but just highly over-rated|`|zFNOaDAYaa	Ray Lewis is slowing down alot. He would be a good leader but as I've said before, they need leadership on the OFFENSE. there defense already does a good job|`|IoCK2bEnaa	Lol. No one can clean up that mess in Dallas. Ray ray would knock some sense into the young men in Dallas, but he's not the solution. He only has a couple more years left. You gotta look at the longterm, not the short term. Unlike the cowboys, some teams dont need money to buy a championship team. GO STEELERS!! By all means, take him away form the AFC north :-)|`|h9ZRYMWzaa	I think ray lewis will help the 'boys he's a leader and sure the cowboys have a lot of star power but they have no leader hence ray lewis|`|8f264df90f04c294a122ee3032ed2541aa	I would Like to See Him At Dallas, I would also Like to see the current ones Step up and show more leadership on the Feild.
k8YSuKGpaa	I agree that kelly kelly is not a great wrestler, but if people think she's good then let them think that. Everyone has their opinion. I don't think she's terrible, but she's not great either.|`|QMveJrziaa	Kelly Kelly is a terrible wrestler. You are right, she does a few flips, and her offense moves usually rely heavily on her opponents help. It amazes me that people think she is talented, or improving.<br>  <br>  BQ - I honestly hope not. While I would like to see Trish come back for WM, Why Candice Michelle? That would be a waste of her return. I would rather she fights Mickie James, or Beth Pheonix.|`|JiCfYfLraa	i understand she sucks and she cant wrestle.<br>  <br>  kelly kelly does a few backflips and everyone says she can wrestle. she is very overrated.<br>  <br>  jillian hall should have whooped her on monday. kelly kelly is starting to creep and crawl under my skin.<br>  <br>  do i like kelly kelly no do i respect kelly kelly no is kelly kelly a whore YES.<br>  <br>  no i do not think trish stratus is coming back to fight kelly kelly but i heard she was coming back to face natalya.|`|F9yxiQ1faa	They like her because most of them like her for her looks and not her in-ring talent. some would like to say she's improved but that's because they'd like to think that their favorite is the better of everyone else.<br>  <br>  <br>  WQ: No trish is not coming back to fight Michelle , I heard it was going to be Beth and their is also a rumor flying around that it will be Lita fighting Beth and Trish just to make an apperance.|`|1JywgkyMaa	no,its not true that trish is going to wrestle michelle,but i would like to see her come back and whoop kelly kelly's ***|`|444pPdy5aa	Yeah her moves suck. I hate when she does the back flip and she hops like 10 times before she jumps.|`|8sGbSBOWaa	I have never liked KellyX2 but I do think she is better than some other women in the WWE right now. I am not saying she is good but she is better than she used to be. But she still has a long way to go. But the good thing about her is she has been working hard to get better and has a good attitude about trying. That is better than I can say for some others that have had more talent.<br>  Anyway Trish wants to be part of wrestlemania so it might happen.|`|Skremsvlaa	AHAHAHA KELLY KELLY A GOOD "WRESTLER" HAHAHAHAAH,<br>  <br>  KELLY KELLY AND "PRO WRESTLER" SHOULD NEVER BE IN THE SAME SENTENCED!!!!!!!|`|xZVmvgtHaa	Okay im not a fan of her wrestling skill but she is getting better whether you like that or not<br>  <br>  WQ: No Trish isnt coming back.....She should though|`|0Z0onKvdaa	KELLY KELLY IS ONE F***ED UP *****
i5MInqeMaa	Sacramento.  Kings fans are way more faithful.  Laker fans in the mid 90's were just about non existant.|`|sOae9LUzaa	Utah Jazz. They are willing to go to any lengths to let their team win, even if it means getting ejected from the stadium.<br>  <br>  Second are Knicks fans, who still think they have a shot at a championship each year.<br>  <br>  <br>  For those who say LA, where were the faithful fans last year in Game 4? They didn't even root for the Lakers nor try to cheer their team on. Most of the people in the Staples Center are celebritites who don't even know what's going on.|`|qaz33UnNaa	more specific LA clippers im assuming but still Sacramento i think has more faithful fans cause they suck worse...!|`|xHc3KGDmaa	Sactown|`|Kwywmcs8aa	Oakland<br>  <br>  Warriors are a losing team and the games still get sold out|`|H8u7gMAYaa	That's a hard one. I'm going to say LA. Just because we have a much bigger crowd of fans, and they seem to outnumber your guys' fans.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: I know their are alot of true Kings fans out there. I used to live in Sac for a little bit. But, you hardly see any Kings fans on here or anywhere else. You can go to NY, Chicago, Minneasota, Phi, etc and there are Laker fans all over. Sure some are bandwagoners, but there are ALOT more Laker fans than Kings fans.

38d6d7d6011bdd646925e15a23ec4590aa	Because he is Shaq  an nobody has enough Balls[ yes i said it} to tell him something. Honestly if he would tell me something disrespectfull i would fire back at him and i could give a damn who he is|`|XTHmWkhWaa	Agree. i just star ur question. he is getting out of control. last year, he mocks kobe. Now he starts to go out of hand with Van Gundy, Patrick Ewing, Dwyane Wade,and other i can't rememeber. He is insulting people too crazy, He is worse than Charles Barkley|`|38f16af5e5fc1e44e0b50a5058b0ad41aa	You can't hate Shaqtus, he's Shaqalicious! Don't worry about it.|`|C4mzZwiWaa	cuz hes shaq, ppl dont mess around with him.|`|aVkoNhvPaa	During his trial instance in Colorado, Kobe made a statement that got out the media  that if he would have done what Shaq did and paid off the whores, he would never be in this situation. By doing that, Kobe basically dragged Shaq's reputation down with him.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://blog.sportscolumn.com/story/2007/6/15/9628/45943/nba_mia/Shaq_doesn%27t_pay_for_sex" rel="nofollow">http://blog.sportscolumn.com/story/2007/...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  This was never proven and where was it Kobe's place to say things about other players. Shaq responded with fury to Kobe's accusation. My point is, why would you drag another person, not to mention a former teammate into your mess if you were such a noble human being? You don't see Magic Johnson or Wilt Chamberlin dragging teammates into the same situation when they were found guilty of adultery.|`|sOae9LUzaa	I think someone should start to rap on Shaq. I mean, this guy is out of line. He's been insulting Dwight Howard for being an amateur and for copying his style. I mean, how inflated can this guy's ego get.

AA11570394	What gets me is the few hunters and gun owners who are for banning “assault” weapons. Clearly they can not see the chipping away of our rights or the true need for semi-auto weapons.<br>  <br>  The need for semi auto weapons is to foremost protect us from tyranny or invasion. Yes we have the military but what if we are engaged in a large war overseas and have our country attacked while most our troops are elsewhere? Don’t think that will happen? Well it did in WW2 when the Japanese invaded the Aleutian Islands in Alaska. Locals had to fight with what they had as local military personal were overwhelmed. And a bloody fight it was! And right now the Mexican government can’t stop the drug cartel from killing thousands along our border. How could they stop a large group of terrorists from another country in a surprise attack into Texas or California? It would be the people of Texas or Cali with their guns who would have to back our LEO’s and military until reinforcements arrived.<br>  <br>  So if we were attacked or if our government had a military or political coop how could we fight back with a single shot rifle? Not too well I’m afraid! <br>  <br>  Then there is all the shooting competition events that use semi-auto weapons. Hunters who use some types of semi-auto guns for hunting, or the home owner who protects his family with a semi auto. Do we really want a home owners to be up against criminals who have semi-autos, with a bolt action rifle?<br>  <br>  And the big one criminals don’t follow laws! Just last week in New Orleans an ex-con and his buddy shot people with a semi auto “assault” rifle.  Why didn’t the laws prevent him from doing that? For the love of Pete cant people see its not about the criminals its about the law biding public being denied the RIGHT to have certain guns!|`|VCzsfVM5aa	I think everyone that cares about the issue knew this was coming.  So yes, these weapons were bought up,  I fear that by 2010 guns sales in california will be non existent or much more limited as the governator placed a bill to require pins to be microstamped to reflect gun serial numbers.  The main reason for CA gun restrictions is due to all the gangbangers, and will not slow them down getting their hands on banned weapons and using them.  I fear as a costal state we will be left defensless should the worst arise.|`|AA11729094	I want to see what our local obama supporter has to say besides his typical cut and paste answers decorated with **'s and ~~"s and other nonsense. When shown PROOF of what obama stands for he still ignored it and cut and pasted his nonsense answers anyhow. Now we await what nonsense it will post to this question. Apparently, being a liberal is truly a mental illness.|`|0cLj35Fgaa	Keep in mind that not everyone can afford to spend $1200 on an ar-15.<br>  <br>  I never voted for "change".  Therefore that part doesn't apply to me.<br>  <br>  This is what I have been trying to say for a while now.  Guns will eventually be outlawed and people won't be able to access them legally.  That's an obvious trend.<br>  <br>  What is not obvious to me is why people can't work up the guts to get illicit arms.  Whenever someone asks a question about supressors, I tell them that they can get them through the ATF or they can ask a machinist to do it for them "under the table".  I usually end up getting 5-6 thumbs down and a few snotty comments from some of you.  The day may very well come when the illicit economy will be one of your lifelines.  It's better to realize, accept, and practice that now than later.|`|8A0JdS7Xaa	I can't understand the reasoning of the people who have spent the past few months buying up all the guns and ammo that they believe are going to be banned, thinking they're making some kind of "investment". Knowing what we know about Obama and the far left's view of armed citizens, there can be no market for them. They're destined to be confiscated and destroyed, period. <br>  <br>  There will be a short window of opportunity between the time that it becomes painfully obvious to everyone what the new administration means to do to this country and the time when we no longer have the means to prevent it. I have little confidence that enough of us have the will to resist, and in any event I dread the outcome. I'm afraid I may live to see the end of freedom in America.|`|HZvdr8VLaa	I am a little hesitant to discuss my actual plans in a public forum, for all we know the commie bastar*s monitor this too.  I know my families history of fighting and dying for the freedoms we posses.... I would rather be dead than willingly submit to this.  I am prepared to meet my maker and all I ask is that some of the little spoiled pus*ies we have raised, lay down the nintendo and for once.... DO THE RIGHT THING.  <br>  Give me a good funeral.|`|KMASS2Gmaa	When did civilian non-automatic military knockoffs become Assault weapons. I was in the ROTC program at NMSU when the M16 controversy was going on.  They defined an assault weapon as a weapons that has a selector switch allowing it to fire full automatic for the final 100 yard rush of the assault. The weapon had bo be light and the ammo had to also be small light weight rounds to allow the infantry to carry sufficient rounds to allow for full automatic weapons. <br>  <br>  Now as I understand the current laws those weapons are currently banned and have not been legal to sell with out a FFL Class III  and paying a heavy tax with a background check that can take as much as five years.<br>  <br>  When did that change? If it has not what the fu@k is Obama talking about assault weapons. are we talking the AR-15 clones, Mini 14/30s, etc, IF so then the man is directly violating the second amendment. <br>  <br>  The SECOND AMENDMENT IS NOT ABOUT HUNTING. It is about the civil population being allowed to be as well armed as the Federal Government. It is time to remind the hired help that the We The People is not them but those who hired them.|`|dpSr0icwaa	NICS reported 1.4 MILLION checks in the month of November.<br>  <br>  Dig in.  Grab your wallet now.  Who cares if you don't agree with 100% of what certain pro 2nd amendment groups do.  We can worry about all that other crap later.  Now we need to GET SH!T DONE.<br>  <br>  Like we said about the war 'Fight them over there so we don't have to fight them here.'<br>  <br>  Fight now, with money and time and votes, so we don't have to fight them the other way.<br>  <br>  Too many people like to chant 'from my cold dead hands' but can't be bothered to call or write their senators and reps.<br>  <br>  Hell, this is the time for real action too.  No, you don't have to send thousands, but you damn well better give hard consideration to sending $100.  Get involved too.  <a href="http://www.secondamendmentmarch.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.secondamendmentmarch.com/</a>  You might not be able to afford to take a week off of work and fly to DC to attend the march, but if you think the RKBA is important, you better damn well be willing to spend 8 hours in a car and march on your local capitol.<br>  <br>  All these things are needed, and considering how may true patriots shed blood and lost their lives securing or liberty, a few days and a few hundred dollars are CHEAP.|`|35aUnX8Xaa	I feel your pain. In the UK, 1988 I waved goodbye to semi auto centre fire rifles. In 1997 I waved goodbye to handguns.<br>  <br>  Now I'm left with shotguns and bolt action rifles from .17 up to a 50cal.<br>  <br>  The only semi auto's allowed are shotguns and rimfires.<br>  The licensing structure is a load of BS.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|CuusFccNaa	I have to agree with you, as a responsible hunter and sportsman.  I feel as though my second amendment rights are about to be erased before my eyes.  Look at the city of Chicago (Obama-ville), where it is already against the law to own a firearm. The authors of the U.S. Constitution secured the 2nd amendment to protect citizens from a corrupt government. Now watch as that corrupt government takes away our right to keep and bear arms, like they already have our right to free speech!  I believe it was Adolph Hitler who disarmed the citizens in in Eastern Europe before destroying them.  Have we learned nothing?|`|ZDOUwJsbaa	Thank you for this question Randy. It's nice to know that im not alone. I am very worried about whats coming around the corner and to be quite honest I feel quite powerless against it. Everyone says "They will get my guns when they pry them out of my cold dead hands." How many people do you know who say this, that wont crap themselves and throw all their guns in the back of the gov. truck, when a team of armed men show up at their house to collect? I'd like to think that we are a government of the people by the people and for the people but it's not looking quite so much like that these days. If that were the case than wouldn't our liberties be more and our tax burden be less?<br>  <br>  I live in rural Maine. I still have many liberties that many in our country do not. They don't pay allot of attention to us up here in the sticks and that's the way I like it. But if this is going to be a nation wide ban on certain guns which is bad enough, but ammo also??? That is going to effect everyone that has anything to do with hunting and shooting. My question for you is. What Can I Do To Help???|`|sWquRnVTaa	2A says NOTHING about sporting use of firearms. It was not written for squirrel or duck hunting. The 2nd Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America was SPECIFICALLY written in there as a form of protection from tyranny.<br>  <br>  I say let him push. Check this out...<br>  <a href="http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/legislation/2009/HCR0006.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/legislat...</a> <br>  <br>  I know, it's long, so you can scan ahead to the end of the document.<br>  Basically they are saying that if there are ANY further restrictions to the 2nd Amendment, they are done with the federal government. So, push away Obama, Pelosi, Kennedy, Kerry, Feinstein, Biden et al. Push away. We very well could be looking at Civil War V.2 and the Great Depression V.2 all rolled into one decade.|`|z0OcW0t7aa	Hey Randy,<br>  <br>  This is an issue that I feel strongest about. It gives me chills & makes me sick to know that our basic rights as Americans can just be stripped from us so easy.<br>  <br>  I applaud all who went out and demonstrated those rights in buying AR and handguns.<br>  <br>  Although I could not. Because I am under 21 (20 to be exact) there is a law in NY(and many other states) that do not allow a great citizen such as myself to get a pistol permit. I can go over to Afghanistan or Iraq and die for my country (the country I actually love and care about unlike many liberals), BUT I cannot PROTECT myself and my loved ones?<br>  <br>  I would have never voted for Obama's "change". Because I knew, just like you did Randy, that it would come down to this.<br>  <br>  Makes me sick to my stomach...<br>   I encourage all of you who read this post, to go to NRA's website (www.nra.org), look at the current pending bills along the bottom, in red, AND make a difference my calling your local gov't.|`|QrjuueMCaa	Wounded Duck can kiss my ***.<br>  <br>  I never voted for this tool. He is not my president...Hell, he isn't even a US citizen.<br>  <br>  The time has come to step up and unite. Get heard. Write your congress, senate, heck, even your mayor. Join a hunting organization such as the NRA, GOA, etc...<br>  <br>  This is a travesty of government.

Our founders understood that a citizen is armed a slave is not.<br>  And they wanted us to be able to stand up to a government if it should ever try to make slaves out of the people.<br>  <br>  The second amendment was not put there for hunters, nor was it put in place for self defense purposes, although guns are great for both of those things.  The second amendment was put there for protection from the government.<br>  <br>  And since obama seems to fancy himself a dictator, and socialism is the first step before communism, and comminism is just sociliasm enforsed at gunpoint, It makes sense that Obama would want to take away america's guns as a step to being able to enforse communism on the good people of America.  <br>  <br>  My thought is that some day it may require the Good responsible citizens of America to raise up and stop this unrestrained march to socialism and communisim.  Assult weapons are the tool nessarry to winning back our freedom if that should ever become nessarry.<br>  Obama knows it.  <br>  He's also trying to silence talk radio which is one of the biggest impeadiments to him trying to take away america's freedom.<br>  Once he gets rid of guns, and talk raido, there will be nothing stopping him from gaining complete control of everyone.<br>  <br>  These are dark times we live in,  And I dont look forward to the uprising that may be comming down the pike someday, but I do know this, <br>  I will give up everything that I have and everything that I am If I think that it will save this country, and keep us from loosing all our freedoms.<br>  I'm prepared to Live free or Die.|`|tuULGJS6aa	Surprise, surprise...NOT! I knew we gunowners were in for it from either Clinton or Obama, so I would've cut off one of my hands before I'd vote for either of those scumbag @$$h0!es. One of my friends has been standing on the street collecting signatures to send to our Congressmen about this issue. I'm going to rejoin the NRA for sure. There's a war starting with Slimy Snake Barack the aspiring Lunatic Left Commissar overthrowing the Constitution. I feel like kicking any man who says he voted for "change" in the cojones.

1ApbWVhsaa	It's a big deal because he just got back from a long injury lay off.His first of his career(I believe)..He stopped EVERY shot he faced.Getting a shutout in the NHL is tough but to get one in his return game?I understand the Avs are bad and a bad road team but you can't blame Devils fans and hockey fans for being excited.<br>  <br>  Another example-When Mario came back from his battle with cancer..He scored a goal but lost the game.The comeback of a player is bigger then the game itself..understand now?I know his cancer battle was worse to deal with then an arm injury but ya get it..|`|HJuOSvmdaa	I won't be sarcastic like most of these other people lol.<br>  <br>  It's because he came back after sitting for four months, and he is a legendary player so he naturally gets more attention.  The fact that he came in and gets a shutout his first game back is pretty impressive against any team, you don't just come back after four months and kick *** normally.|`|G33E41IBaa	I know the Avs didn't play well, but a shutout is still a shutout, and Brodeur just came back from a major injury after missing four months of the season.  Brodeur didn't just win, but he didn't let in a single goal after facing 24 shots.  He's now only 5 shutouts and 7 wins away from breaking some big records.<br>  <br>  For your team, I think the equivalent to Brodeur's win would be if Joe Sakic returned and scored a hattrick, no?  Three goals would still be a lot, regardless of what team you play, and it's a big accomplishment after being hurt for almost the entire season.<br>  <br>  So yeah, we Devils fans are pretty happy :)|`|Pq5Ds8F2aa	It's like the second coming of Christ man.<br>  <br>  He was a solid as the day he got hurt. No he didn't stand on his head, but he did all that was asked of him.|`|WKKdQq2Aaa	Typical question from a Av's fan who is frustrated with his team, so he must question the shut out win of a legend.|`|JEenJYrkaa	it wasn't the Avs day.|`|g8jg3jnTaa	The guy was out for 4 months, nobody expected him to be great let alone get a shutout...There was no rust, he did what he had to do, & will go down as the greatest goalie...What he did last night was spectacular...That is why it was a big deal...Everyone thought it would take him a few games to be comfortable...The fact the avs are horrible have nothing to with it..They are still in the playoff race & they needed that win last night..But whatever...Last night the KING OF KINGS IS BACK ON HIS THRONE!|`|QSShHlRiaa	Look at Andrew Raycroft and the rest of the Avs.<br>  and you have your answer...|`|wCblFbrmaa	True the avs suck and he wasnt tested
cf4d6d60fab75efc136a4d66dd5c03b4aa	Cardiff and Swansea are not in England for better examples.<br>  <br>  You got a point but the wall of arrogance will become a major factor to stop your devised project.|`|MjPd9vyYaa	Maybe because L.A isn't in Mexico. And L.A is in the U.S and they should stick with their league; MLS.<br>  <br>  Edit: True. But Mexican League is different then other leagues so....|`|p1kmZziVaa	People say that it's because LA isnt in Mexico but there's a Canadian team in the MLS - Toronto FC|`|TkKHIoPIaa	Easy answer ,because L.A.is not Mexico . <br>  <br>  <br>  Chivas run it , Future Campiones de LIBERTADORES !|`|09SjyOHkaa	LA is in USA...not Mexico<br>  As simple as that..|`|82MzhqHRaa	true but time after time the Mexican league has shown they are 32532 times better than the MLS. If not look at the CONCACAF Champions league. Even a Puerto Rican team made it. Chivas USA nor Galaxy are doing anything special. Plus honestly i go watch Chivas USA games at times and its wack. It only gets good in Chivas USA vs Galaxy games. I am sure many agree with me. And if we did do that, the only reason we would sell out in LA is because everybody would go watch the other team haha. Or at least that is what i would do. I would only go watch them when they play Pumas, Chivas, America, and Cruz Azul|`|sJznih8raa	i think the reason is because LA is not in mexico. its as simple as that.|`|cOPCNP7Laa	And umm the same way Welsh teams play in the ENGLISH Premier League, Toronto in the MLS, San Marino in the Italian Leagues (tho at the bottom haha), Monaco in France, Liechestein teams play in the Swiss League, etc....
cxd2kSaSaa	I think it has something to do with the loyalty and belief of the supporters. The ones who want him to leave dont believe he has the potential to win the league, but I'd say around two thirds of the fans really want him to stay becuase they know that he is the man who's undoubtedly going to deliver for us soon. He has more than enough potentail to do it - he's got us this far.|`|8Nov6Xaoaa	Well I reckon if Liverpool had a British manager then they would win the Premier League. I think Martin O'Neil is the man 2 take Liverpool 4 ward!|`|O5KOwhovaa	No, they don't.|`|tfotPdeZaa	I dont think they do but it would be funny :)|`|A1cCdluFaa	Neva in a million years|`|LdJFFvSVaa	Well they're a very changeable bunch aren't they|`|cOPCNP7Laa	There's mixed feeling.

rv6zl5t3aa	The Avs probably are the worst statistically, but the Islanders are in more of a shambles, for their goalie situation.<br>  <br>  Avs<br>  <br>  Budaj    16-24-1    .896sv%    2.98 GAA  1 SO<br>  <br>  Raycroft    12-9-0   .897sv%    3.04GAA<br>  <br>  Both were starters in the past and have played well, but dont know what the issue is this year.<br>  <br>  Isles<br>  <br>  Dipietro- 15yrs for.....Nothing, but injuries and inconsistency<br>  <br>  McDonald- 12-24-5  .900sv%  3.30GAA Not a bad goalie, but not a starter.<br>  <br>  Yann Danis  5-9-2  .924sv% 2.54 GAA 1 SO probably has played the best out off all of them, but again not a starter, just a Journey man|`|0f213e569404219f01d20decc3749462aa	For the past 15 years or so, the Philadelphia Flyers have never settled on that "Goalie." Even if Niitymaki plays well here and there, they're still confused on who it is, him or Biron. Luckily they have 7 guys who will easily top 20 goals on the season.|`|ZbNXVQu7aa	What about the Islanders?<br>  <br>  DiPietro, who seems like he's constantly injured, still has several seasons left on his 15-year contract, and the other goalies who have played for them this season are a rather uninspiring bunch.<br>  <br>  I will concede that the Avalanche have also been uninspiring as far as save% is concerned.  What I can't tell is if it's bad goaltending or bad D that has them (and the Islanders) in last place.<br>  <br>  That brings me to the Sabres.  Miller's going to be out for a while, and there's no telling when the flu will force Lalime to miss a game (or, even worse, several games in a row), which would leave their fate in the hands of untested (at least in the NHL) Jhonas Enroth.|`|WKKdQq2Aaa	Although Conklin has been playing damn good his past few starts... I still say Detroit. The only thing that worries me about Conks is he is not playoff tested, and depending on how Osgood plays tonight, he may have to just jump into the #1 starting role. <br>  <br>  The ONLY thing that makes me nervous about the Red Wings is the goal tending.|`|HNE7dJQiaa	Probably macdonald and the islanders|`|oJsrGmmPaa	The Islanders. Wait, they don't even have a goalie...|`|Pq5Ds8F2aa	When you figure it out NJ has a Clemmer for sale.|`|srVQ1tTLaa	Even though Dallas is narrowly holding the 8th spot right now, I think The Stars have the worst goalie situation. <br>  <br>  We have a revolving door for who occupies the back-up spot on the bench. Turco has all but turned into a cheap copy of Ed Belfour with all of his head games. By the end of the saeason, Marty will be so tired, I am starting to doubt we can hold onto a playoff berth.<br>  <br>  We are in trouble....|`|R7ACldBKaa	three way tie between the Avs, Thrashers, and Islanders...maybe throw in the Cyotoes seeing how they went straight to last after the allstar break|`|pMIc1XXWaa	the ducks. between giguere playing terrible as he always does and hiller who is playing ok hockey.|`|Q8amh0rUaa	Def the avs.  Raycroft and Budaj go down in the butterfly before the puck is even shot.|`|LEQowzHCaa	I think the New York Islanders have the worst goalie situation|`|Xl8CB3oEaa	sabres. miller is injured and Lalime is "sick".|`|ks1WIgSKaa	Colorado

PRDZmeiEaa	I agree with you 100%!! LOL I guess I need to study my hockey so I can answer your questions... Ha Ha|`|ARuJLITUaa	I think the Rangers got a pretty good deal just by having Kalinin off the ice.  He is freaking awful.  Ugh, watching him was painful sometimes.<br>  <br>  I am REALLY happy he's gone.  Prucha was never productive, though he played his heart out every night and I loved his enthusiasm.  He's a small guy, which makes everything he does that much more impressive.<br>  <br>  Dawes I really liked... I'm going to be sad to see him go.  Again, not as productive as people would have thought, but no Ranger has been... I was really hoping tortorella could get dawes to start connecting.<br>  <br>  I don't know much about Morris at all... I've heard he's pretty good defensively but never progressed as people were expecting him to.  I guess I'll see when he starts playing... but anything is a step up from Kalinin.  Ugh, he's so bad.  I'm SO GLAD he's gone.  Sorry, phoenix, I wish he had gone to a team I hated more.|`|IZ4GcYgiaa	Pretty much everyone here does!<br>  <br>  The Coyotes got the better end of the Carcillo deal as well for a 2nd round pick and Scotty Upshall!|`|64LZW2y8aa	Yeah, they definitely won a lot, if not, ALL their trades that they made today. They're rebuilding, and they did a good job of it today.|`|Hki3AoL5aa	yea, i wonder if that why the caps didnt persue him more because they wanted too much!|`|WcLNcXjNaa	This was an awesome day for the Coyotes. They came out looking like bandits.|`|XQoH9ZI5aa	Howler..........easy there big fella. We can't evaluate most of these trades yet, we can only speculate.<br>  <br>   Upshall is an RFA at season's end.....what if a team makes him an offer of 3-4M per for 5 year and the Coyotes decline to match.........then the Coyotes would have him for a total of 20 something meaningless games and have a couple of draft picks to show for it (that would be hit or miss to turn into anything........meanwhile Carcillo goes onto score 20 goals per year for several years. LITY thinks Philly did well in that trade as well. As do I.<br>  <br>   As for the Q. This trade a mirage in that the NYR had to shed some salary in order to fit Morris into their cap space.....essentially they needed to send about 4M back to PHX for the 4M salary of Morris. Economics move.

He came out and said exactly what he wants... more money.  He didn't insult the fans by saying he wants to win or be in a situation where his talents are being fully utilized, before he decided to take a big contract with an inferior team.  He came right out and was refreshingly honest about his intentions (unlike so many other players that seem to string teams and fans along).|`|64rFAlMAaa	nahhhh man he's still a monster at what he does, who cares if he leaves the Ravens, they should be grateful that he made their defense dominant for so long. Your probably a Ravens fan, dude the NFL is a business, can't blame him for making the decision anyways|`|j7i0zPpWaa	Nope, he is a good player but testing the market. His career is either over if he leaves to a crap team  but he may stay and retire a Raven. He has everything where he is at, if it was a dream for him to play in Dallas he should have went early in his career not at the end.|`|mUSs0lyaaa	as a die hard ravens fan, i love ray lewis. its too bad i wont get to see him every sunday during fall, but i think the ravens D will do just fine without him.|`|YRRXtVXeaa	i never had any respect FOR THIS MUDERER! HE IS A PUNK AND FOOL WHO GOT AWY WITH MURDER! COWGIRLS WILL REGRET GETTING HIM JUST LIKE PAC PUNK JONES!|`|KNTofuxMaa	It's  business and the Ravens and Lewis have to do what's best for themselves. Having said that, that is why I prefer college. Players stay with one team and there is not all the crap associated with the financial aspect of the pro's.|`|mTSOJKlyaa	i agree, you lose a little respect for a player when they give up n their traditional team and bolt for the nearest dollar they see, but this is one of the least disrespectful things Ive seen a player do so compared to many other things it does not bother me.

LGVrhTFTaa	DO IT!<br>  I often benched A.Rod in favor of Longoria last year.<br>  A.Rods' (P.E.D. enhanced) skills are deteriorating.<br>  Plus I don't see A.Rod generating alot of bat speed,or stealing many bases with a bad hip.<br>  Also; Hamels is a slight upgrade over Kazmir..<br>  <br>  ~g0()d LuCk!~|`|NKQw4BKSaa	That's a fairly even trade. ARod is gonna play this season at only 75-85% because of his hip injury, and plus he doesn't want to get surgery. Scott Kazmir is in a tough division, where any team can put up 10 runs in 15 minutes. He's also at times a little bit inconsistant. Evan Longoria, on the other hand, in the AL Rookie of the Year. He didn't even play for the full season, and still managed to hit 300 and drive in close to in not 100 rbi. Cole Hamels can in second In the NL last year in Cy Young Voting. He pretty much established himself as the finesse version of Johan Santana. It also helps that with the exception of the Braves, none of the teams in the NL East got any better in the off season.|`|hN36KWkraa	do it now before he realizes A-Rod wont be much this season<br>  while Evan Longoria is probably top 5 3B<br>  and Hamels and Kazmir are even<br>  but ill take Hamels because he has a better chance of a win<br>  Kazmir only beats him in Ks but if u have other pitchers to get u Ks<br>  make this trade right now!<br>  good luck!!|`|911851b2b251a8cb71cb5ba956d76d89aa	A-Rod is injured and Hamels is a stud pitcher, better than Kazmir (I had both of them on my team last year) so the trade is worth it|`|M6uIbKXRaa	hell no it sounds like a good trade but i dont think it would be a wise choice|`|Uh0EGOu4aa	do the deal, but it is stacked way in your favor.  u must be trading with a five year old kid who only knows derek jeter and a-rod.|`|4uSRVZNNaa	if you can get somebody to agree to that now, good luck.  take it and run. <br>  whether this is a legit injury or a cover up for a suspension, I believe arod will miss significant time this year. I personally wouldn't touch arod now with a 39 1/2' pole.  <br>  I could be wrong but I doubt it. I say dump arod while you can.  he's a hot potato.
Gj8JTJGRaa	Because he is named after desperado the hitman from mexico|`|91052aeeaae7f679e0597b8689a2057aaa	Because he is from Manchester city but he has the heart and determination on a Mexican fighter. Mexicans are brought up with the mentality of never giving up or get knocked out.

6b4d4fb2e519a8ffe2f58e1c9e3c4a2baa	MANNY IS A PUNK AND SHOULD JUST RETIRE...|`|DSJOxz0Qaa	Don't fall victim to the media.  Don't believe for one minute that the Dodgers keep giving him "final offers" and he is rejecting them.  Its called negotiations, and just because LA papers need to be sold and ESPN needs a lead story does not mean that the Dodgers are close to saying "take a hike".  If the Dodgers are to have ANY hope in 09' it now lies with signing one man.  Without him, they are a bunch of young players with out the power or consistency to be a factor in the division; yet alone in the playoffs as they did last year.  Anyone that has ever done high level negotiations knows that this is done all the time.  We the fans, never really know the way the contract is structured, only the 'highlights' from whatever new source you listen to and they all have an agenda.  I am willing to bet anyone that thinks differently that he will be in a Dodger uniform within 3 weeks...with the deal that better than what we have heard thus far (from Manny's perspective).|`|2VVU7gNfaa	I wouldn't even have offered him this last deal after he rejected the one before that if I were the Dodgers.  I'm pretty sure this was the last call for Manny with the Dodgers.<br>  <br>  Manny is a great hitter, but he and his agent are both fools.  Any 36-year old guy or his agent expecting a bidding war with long guaranteed contracts are just delusional.  $45 million dollars is a hell of a lot of money to turn down if Manny ends up not playing anywhere this season.  If Manny sits out a year he's probably finished playing altogether because you don't see a lot of 37-year-old baseball players making successful comebacks.|`|ViB84hYzaa	Yes, and there are a number of players that MLB and the fans should say farewell to once and for all. A-rod, Pudge, Bonds, Mcgwire, Sheffield, Clemens to name a few.<br>  Manny is just one of them towards the top of the list!|`|LbJqU82waa	yep! manny is a greedy fool and an idiot for listening to scott borass, the greedy leech of an agent! i would hang both of them on sight!|`|hMkb7H31aa	Manny  WHOOOO????<br>  Anyone who thinks he is bigger than the game is not worth the drama.|`|NWMwWTxyaa	It should be more like F*U*C*K off|`|ea5d3bd72b30b35cee341b84c4025d7baa	As a Dodgers fan, I'm getting tired of this nonsense. What is Manny waiting for? Is he waiting for the economy to just suddenly go up again this year? Well...that's not going to happen and the longer he waits, the worse his image is going to take, which was bad from the start anyway. Sure, he had a Ted Williams-like second half that almost sent the Dodgers to the World Series but at some point, he's going to have to support and feed his kids, and without any income, he might look desperate enough to sign a contract. Maybe he's still waiting for his hometown Mets or Yankees to give him a call (like that's going to happen).     <br>  <br>  The Dodgers have got this negotiation right from the start, to the dismay of some angry Dodger fans. They offer him $45 million for two years (15 million in 2009, 22.5 million in 2010, a club option for 2011 for also 22.5 million or a 7.5 million buyout) at the General Managers meeting back in November. They offer him arbitration and a one year deal worth $25 million. The last one has got to be the best of all offers: Two years, $45 million (sorry for the repeat but the difference is that the second year is a player option for $20 million in 2010, meaning that Manny could opt out after 2009, presuming the economy gets better). The Dodgers even made some threats, pursuing Bobby Abreu and Adam Dunn as leverage in their negotiation and Manny didn't bite for it. The deal works for both because if Manny performs well, he can opt out after this season, and the Dodgers can pursue Matt Holliday or Vladimir Guerrero to replace him. If he performs below par, he still gets to keep $20 million for next season (assuming he doesn't opt out) to go along with $25 million he's earning for 2009.<br>  <br>  In Scott Boras point of view, he trying to gain a personal victory for himself this offseason after he saw his client, A-Rod, negotiate his own 10-year deal w/o his help, meaning that he won't get any commission out of the historic deal. The only major deal he negotiate in 2009 is the Mark Teixeira contract w/ the Yanks, in which the Yanks outbid themselves to land his service. He thought he could do the same thing with the Dodgers, but that's not the case. The Dodgers are still fuming after J.D. Drew opt-out suddenly in 2006, losing former minor league prospect Luke Hochevar (draft number one by the Royals a year later), and signing Andruw Jones to the worst contract in baseball history. All of this was of Boras fault and they weren't going to fall for it again with Manny. If Manny wants a contract and repair his image, he should have done what A-Rod did and negotiate for himself. Otherwise, the Dodgers can just move on with the season starting over a month.|`|hv8ytdaoaa	Yes, the Dodgers should stop offering Manny something he doesn't want. If he rejects every contract that the Dodgers offer, they should just forget about him.|`|M0eyMvqlaa	Dodgers have no choice now, it's either "Money Ramirez" or no win. So messed up how one player has a whole entire organization in the palm of his hand. This attitude clearly displays that the Red Sox were right about him. Totally disregard the fact that there's a recession "Money Ramirez" and get paid, because you're just that good. I don't care how talented he is now, I don't want him on my team, and as I stated before, damn sure happy that the Mets didn't sign him.|`|7X1H2AfWaa	no. the dodgers need manny, or they are nothing. yes, they have kuroda, broxton, matt kemp, james loney and other guys who can play the game well, they lost two of their starting players. derek lowe who was their best pitcher and matt kemp who was their second baseman who retired. these guys had a role in the dodgers success but arent on the team now. if the dodgers have manny for the whole season, they might improve.|`|nDzenpkwaa	If manny decides he is going to play instead of quit, then he is a huge impact for a team.  The biggest problem for Manny is, he quit last season playing for the Red Sox and then decided to play when he got to L.A.  Who can trust him?  I think he is waiting for someone to get hurt and then get an offer.  The problem with this thought is, what team is going to offer 4 years 100 mil for his EGO.  The Yankees, NO.  They have their players.  The Red Sox, No, they wouldn't make that mistake twice.  The Mets, No they have their players.  What other teams, other than the Dodger's, are willing to shell out that kind of dough for Manny's "Maybe I'll play today" attitude.  He'll be playing for the Dodgers in the first game of the season.  And Yes it is time for Manny to be told to "Screw Off" by the Dodgers...  But he won't be, they need him...|`|wYdHeAE9aa	pretty arrogant if you ask me. dodgers could get more talent, if not, dodgers don't need baggage. manny is troublemaker.|`|XOtN0mzNaa	YES!|`|5d77c66b171b12a5932576b2dc7b7dd3aa	yep
LaqPbYkBaa	Resistance Running.|`|BB6HGbnPaa	As a runner and after running for my school for 2 years, I improved a lot after 1 year. If you join and start going to practice everyday, it will effect you greatly and probably make you fast and give you more endurance. If you can run 2 miles now, wait till 2-3 months. You can probably run a marathon. But just to warn you, running takes a lot of energy from you and if you have 5 hours of homework, it will be hard and you have to find a way to balance running and homework. Personally, running took a lot out of me and I didn't even have 5 hours of homework to do. But if you really want to run, go for it but balance your schedule.|`|wHWfTuPKaa	Haha my suggestion is to buy a treadmill and run while doing all that homework :)  WOW 5 hours!!
Khn1wTAlaa	I would get a mini-logo board. They're cheap, but they're good. Trucks, i would go with ventures or krux. They're both pretty light, ad they both work pretty good. Bearings, anything thats good. I would go for the swiss-reds, but they are pretty expensive. As for wheels, i like spitfire, for no particular reason. but wheels depend on what type of skating you do. vert, miniramp, street...street, i would get something lighter. same with miniramp. vert; size doesnt matter so much, neither does weight. good luck!|`|SCs2inCsaa	You can also get a MiniLogo complete. If you don't mind sorta higher in price.. Habitat/Toy Machine...pretty good brands.

I got dealt at the deadline to a team, and had to start back in the minors.  But they pulled me up pretty fast, and my team made a playoff run.  I was a goalie and simmed a lot , so i dont know if they trade you if your doing good but for sure if your bad and you dont take your coaches advice.|`|pMIc1XXWaa	my guy has only been traded when i sim more then seven or eight games. i have not heard of being traded while doing good or even ok.
qoE9H2WNaa	Most large caliber lever action rifles are loaded thru a 'gate', one round at a time. I have never seen any type of clip or other loading device that will work with any 'gate' design.<br>  There have been several tube-type 'speed loaders' for different model .22's with tubular magazines, but not all makes & models are able to use them.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	Most lever-action rifles have integral tubular magazines under the barrel.  There are some older Savage models which have detachable magazines, and some Rugers.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	Most lever action rifles have fixed magazines, singly loaded.<br>  There are no 'clips'.<br>  There are few exceptions. No. .22s or 30-30's that I know of.<br>  Some of the Larger caliber Winchesters and one of the modern <br>  Brownings That I recall had 'stack' magazines, but i don't believe <br>  That they were detachable.|`|a268bbf5f7d7d4bbb6f43d11ccd29916aa	A 'clip' is inserted into the action and ejected (or drops out) when empty.  The ammo is typically packed already loaded into the clip.  'En bloc' usually precedes clip when discussing the M1 Garand.<br>  A detachable magazine is often mistakenly called a 'clip'.<br>  A 'stripper clip' is what a charger is commonly called.  It is fitted into an attachment fitting on the action near the magazine.  The rounds are 'stripped' out of the charger and into the magazine by you applying force with your fingers or hand.<br>  The BLR is a currently produced lever action that uses a detachable box magazine.|`|oYf3jSq6aa	Garands had clips and I believe Carcanos did<br>  Other than that no other rifle that I know of operates with a clip<br>  <br>  Some do load with stripper clips, like the SKS<br>  <br>  Later Savage 99 lever actions used a detachable rotary magazine|`|cR7Sf4cjaa	No.  All lever action rifles either side feed or the tube in opened near the muzzle and round dropped in (common in 22's).

4gZYucHMaa	My best advice is to start slowly, you go out too fast you're gearing yourself to just not enjoy it, burn out and possibly cause injury.<br>  <br>  You're better to go out slowly, and build up the endurance and your time. Go out one day and go around the block, if you can manage more then do it, if you have to walk a bit, do it....it takes time. The key also is to *breathe* there is no right way to breathe but you need to experiment different breathing techniques to find what works best for you.<br>  <br>  Running isn't so much about how skinny you are (much to some peoples disbelief) but rather is a state of mind. Your body wants it, wants to be pushed to the limit however it's getting your mind to cooperate so if you can psych yourself into enjoying running, seeing the positve side of it. Running becomes very very natural.<br>  <br>  If you want to follow a plan I've provided a good link below.<br>  <br>  I'm a year into running, after 2 kids and 25 lbs to lose, if I can do it, there's hope for anybody.|`|x4MPNrPcaa	it will take a month at the most to notice getting faster. just practice by like running more and more each day. like do one mile then two miles etc. and getting in shape running will help but try lifting wieghts or crunchs.

bdbZ0DTsaa	You are way to thin to be running right now. To even be in the game you have to eb at LEAST 100 punds if your a girl,120 if your a boy. You need to build up your muscle mass before anything else.<br>  <br>  it is normal to be in pain. But listen to me on this- Eat more PROTEIN! It will REALLY reduce the soreness of the workout the next day. <br>  This is because the muscle you tore down needs to rebuild. But it won't rebuild unless you are eating enough protein. <br>  <br>  NOTE: you should take AS MANY GRAMS OF PROTEIN AS MANY POUNDS AS YOU ARE EVERYDAY THat YOU WORKOUT. For example, take 200 grams of protein everyday you workout if you are 200 pounds.<br>  <br>  I suggest getting a whey protein poweder. They cost about $10-$20 and are all natural from egg and milk. You just mix the powder into your milk, basically what people call "protein shakes". <br>  <br>  I would suggest 3 protein shakes per everyday you workout- <br>  <br>  that is, one in the morning for breakfast, one at lunch, and one at dinner-after you workout. <br>  <br>  And for those days that you don't workout, just take one protein shake.<br>  <br>  Great question! Hope this helped!

ZKikquiOaa	Please do us all a favor and don't sky draw.  That's what Bryan M suggests.  Sky drawing is about the worst thing you can do, specially when using a release.  There's no telling when that release is going to fail on you.  Sky drawing is the number one reason archery ranges get shut down.  I've seen a lot of people sending arrows way beyond the backstop when they sky draw.  <br>  <br>  Now back to your question, others have covered it quite well.  Get a few heavy stretch bands, or something like the bow fit.  Draw it back to anchor, hold 5-8 seconds, let down slowly about half ways, pull back and hold again.  Repeat until you can't pull anymore.  Then rest for twice the length of time you did the exercise.  Then repeat again.<br>  <br>  The proper pull motion is done by the lower trapezius, to exercise it well, you need to pull at a downward angle.  Australian pullups are good for that.  The rest, pushups have helped me tremendously.  Also don't forget to exercise your shoulders and rotator cuffs.<br>  <br>  The best thing to do however is to get a lighter bow.  A friend of mine recently had an injury because he was pulling too hard.  He needed to have surgery to his upper cervical spine.  Not to mention you'll get more enjoyment out of a lighter bow.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	Push-ups will build your arms.<br>  Curls and presses with weights if you've got em.<br>  Practice with your bow, and don't 'stiff arm' it.<br>  Part of your 'draw' can be pushing the bow out as you draw back.<br>  As long as your position is good at release, it doesn't matter too <br>  much how you got there.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	Do push ups, do pull-ups on a horizontal bar, do dips on horizontal bars.* Shoot your Bow only and until you feel your body saying no more today. I usually begin by just trying to shoot 6 arrows, then advance gradually to 12 and so on until your body talks back to you and says that's enough for today.*|`|uChkvc5qaa	upright rows, will strengthen your upper back for your draw.<br>  point your bow up into the air and pull down toward you. when youve reached  the break then point your bow down and aim.|`|TvARYVRJaa	i release may help  tab ,,,,  or simply turn down the poundadge

A budget sniper?<br>  They don't exist, well at least not a decent airsoft SNIPER rifle.

AGM I've never heard anything bad about, but nothing good either.  Double Eagle as far as I'm aware of is fairly low quality, and won't last you to long.  Don't really know anything about TSD.  If it was me, I'd save my money and get one I know will be nice quality, instead of settling for something.

F7GH5gvHaa	I highly recommend the american baseball institute! I got to see it first hand and was really impressed with all of the talent there. I met the instructors and several of their prospects on a day they had a few scouts come over and sign a couple guys. They are very well known for their pitching program. I saw 8- 10 guys throwing in the 90 mile an hour range, a few of them reached 95, one hit 97 and was signed on the spot by the Rangers. I overheard them saying none of them came in throwing nearly that hard. It was nice to see such hard work and dedication. I plan on living and training there this next off season when I can get out of indy ball. <br>  <br>  I heard about it through my cousin who played with Neiman Nix in the minors before breaking his arm on a pitch. Was told he threw in the high 90's, touching 100 mph often. But no teams wanted him after he had 9 arm operations. I am most impressed with his players telling me about how he still can throw 98 miles an hour, and throws 400 pitches a day, catches bullpens, and conducts most of the workouts. He was truly a nice guy, very interesting, and really seems to takes care of his players.<br>  <br>  I think they have a great hitting and conditioning program, where guys are running 6.3 sixty yard dashes. The strength coach was this little jacked dude from UW that was motivating all of the guys through some awesome workout routines. I am looking forward to hooking up with them this September.

He collapsed and was immediately atended to by both the Reds' and Mets' medical staffs and the physicians seated near the plate.  He was pronounced DOA at the hospital.<br>  <br>  Actually it was the umpires who offered to keep the game going.  Jerry Crawford and Steve RIppley would work the game as a two-man crew as the fourth man in the crew (I do not recall his name) went to the hospital with the EMTs.  The players from both teams said no and allowed the umpires to get to the hospital as the next day was a scheduled off day it was easy to make it up then.<br>  <br>  Most of all I remember Reds third base coach with an arm around the shoulder of a weeping Crawford as McSherry was being attended to on the field.

Plus Pro Wrestling Illustrated does not consider the ECW Championship a World Title. To them the only current world titles being used in pro wrestling today are the WWE Championship, World Heavyweight Championship and the TNA World Heavyweight Championship.|`|uUDHEFrSaa	I agree, it was very sad to see that fat blob of mucus say "Ma Gawd Keeng, Mah' Hargy dang get da Munna in da bank den be champion like his buther jeh hurda!"

THATS IT!!!|`|tQw8UqVtaa	Well see ECW world champion doesnt really count for a WWE Champion so yea. And if Matt does win the Money in the bank i am sure that he might not be champ.

qzRDh8Rgaa	Ummm, suck him in to the top of the key then cross right.. but cross to where you keep him guessing when you will actually drive, keep making him bite.. if he waits down low.. then take the freethrow jumper.. but on defense... put your hand in his face.. if he does get position, which he probably does, put up a hand and block his eyes... it works.. but be efficient when on offense make sure you score, if you aren't hitting the 16 footer, don't settle, start driving, get him tired..|`|4rURc0roaa	Cross him over and drive it in every time.|`|ZSAVHC84aa	If you are faster than him, use it. If you're not, pray.|`|F1xpcJ2Laa	use your speed your probably WAY faster than him|`|RMKvHJdnaa	half the game is based on ur eyes...if u can get him wit ur eyes like vince carter ur good to go...also if he knows what hand u r n u usually go to one side...try the other side...n when he first checks it to u...give him a good pump fake...n drive like no tomoro....last ahaha..when u do drive...stop right under the basket...pumpfake him n then when hes in the air shoot the easy lay up|`|keVth5yGaa	First off dont be frustrated. playing a center or a "big man" is much more frustrating if u are a guard, forward, etc. but here are some good tips. "big men are usualy slower then us guard, point, players so the big man will probably play off u a little bit more because he is not as quick. this gives u the perfect opputunity to shoot the ball. if the big man u are playing is more agresive and blocked your shot or "stuffed" you then give him a head fake or two. he will most likely fall for it. when u are playing him and he is on offense or "has the ball" and he can shoot very well play him very tight unless he is fast. this will confuse him and make it harder for him. if he is not a good shooter give him room so he feels obliged for the ball. now in 1 on 1 fouls are not called as often as they should be since theyre are no refs and since u are calling your own fouls so dont be afraid to swat for the ball a little bit. follow these tips and hopefully u will beat him next time. good luck|`|H7AcXAyaaa	Take it to their chest.|`|KYaM65gzaa	the old reggie evans maneuver

Just good luck on raising your child and again nice story.<br>  <br>  BQ: Both.|`|LAdeGGGFaa	ask your parents or some one related to you with kids. i dont have kids so i wouldnt know but if i did i would tell you how it feels.|`|I5FsYmjIaa	I dont know ask your neglecting parents..<br>  Or you could ask your mom if you could quit huggin her so much<br>  Hahah|`|wKnjGSU1aa	To have a baby is the best feeling in the world. You have the best reason to wake up in the morning, even though everyone does, but when I wake up, the first thing on my mind is waking up and playing with my son. I love my wife, even if we divorce or something of that sort, I'll always love her for bringing my son into this world. I think that's a love towards a woman I could never lose (not including the love for your mother, which that love can never be compared to, in my opinion). As a father, you have someone who is going to be learning from you, looking up to you, playing with you, and wanting to become like you. My son is 1 year and 2 months old now, 2 little side notes, I named him Raul, after Raul from Real Madrid, might not matter to most of you, just a little side note. The other one is, I was born on December 31st, my son was born on January 1st, as soon as my birthday celebration and New Year's Eve ends, his Birthdy and New Year starts. Like I said, might not matter to most of you, but it's just a few side notes. Anyways, back to how it feels, you want to show him new things, you want him to have way more than you ever did, I'm sure every single dad feels that. Man, when you're in the hospital, before your wife has him, it's the best feeling, you're there with your wife just waiting for it to happen, anxious, waiting for him to be born already, then when he's born, I felt like nothing else in the world mattered, you really can't put it into explanation. I didn't cry (and I ain't trying to feel Macho or anything), I thought I would, it's a feeling you don't experience every day, I was just way too happy to see my son, I didn't think of anything else. Then once my son was born, I am not joking, I did not sleep for about 3 days, maybe in those 3 days, I slept about 3 or 4 hours, I was just too happy that all I wanted to do was carry him and play with him, stay up, "hang out" and watch him all night, also because my wife was very tired afterwards. It's a feeling that you can't explain too well unless you eperience it. I know some people might read this and might think, damn Eazy, you over-did it, you wrote way too much for a simple answer, it's a little too much, and if you're thinking that, all I gotta say to you is, wait until you have a son, wait until you speak of how it feels like, then you'll know how it feels to talk about the experience, I could go on and on talking about my son, that's something you never get tired of, but then again, it might just be me.<br>  <br>  As for the 2nd question:<br>  I would much rather see Mexico win the World Cup.|`|d006c09fcf96a47861ea8ba43ac7673faa	I personally dont have a kid. but i know 4 a reason that the feeling well be IMMENSE.|`|DO7nz8aRaa	sorry don't have kids but as for your bonus question i'd rather have mexico win 6 world cup|`|qbPbvLuLaa	I'm too young but it probably feels good but there are tough moments.<br>  <br>  mexico wins 6 world cups|`|8zgFyfibaa	Its the best feeling in the world, I mean when my son was born I aint gonna lye I cried. I mean that's something you can call your own. <br>  <br>  Imagine your gonna have a baby calling you daddy,saying I wanna be like my daddy (oh snap I'm getting sentimental)<br>  <br>  Having a baby is priceless nothing can be compared to having a baby,|`|82fd54d1c65455ed9c17232b1e7b390baa	I'm 15 but I'v baby sit and I took care of a kid from 3 months till he was 2 years old, last year is when I stopped taking care of him and wow he called me dad evev though he wasn't my son but I didn't know his dad and he didn't live with dad but it was a great feeling taking care of a little child but I believe it's different if it's your own child. I probably get married in 10 years or so. =D|`|jUeiFZfmaa	Lol nacho. father of nine? Hahahaha u crack me up. I don't hav kids of my own but from my experience with other kids i know that at times it can very fustrating. The kids i knom hav little or no manners so i don't like being around them. Personally i will pass on having kids for now but maybe in five to seven years.|`|Awfv7TV3aa	this is the futbol mexicano section. seems it's only fitting to make your "bonus" question the primary question and vice versa. either that or visit the family & friends category and keep the two seperate. entendido?|`|LteyOHZwaa	I'll let you know in about 10 years...

kx4M1nvvaa	I was also expecting it to be a clean match but i knew that something was going to happen because smackdown doesn't just throw triple-h in a random match and it be clean.<br>  <br>  Primo and carlito will face morrison and miz next week.<br>  <br>  I've been wanting him too, all i've been doing is screaming at the tv "Kick matts @ss jeff" but jeff being the nice person that he is won't sigh lol<br>  <br>  Vickie I know has something goin on with show and thats what i think cena whispered in her ear because he knows and threatened to expose her. But I say go ahead and cheat because edge cheated on her.|`|gIR2MXHXaa	<a href="http://getinnanswers.angs.com.au" rel="nofollow">http://getinnanswers.angs.com.au</a><br>  A very informative website, kindly stay a minute in website and enter you email address for getting your answer.|`|9mZBVkJMaa	Yes expecting Legacy, not excepting the snot and stuff coming out of Triple H (SICK)<br>  Jeff should kick Matt's azz but it will not happen they are building on something.<br>  Would have loved it if Vicki and Big Show had a fling, that would be funny.  Edge treats Vicki badly, Big Show is more her equal.<br>  <br>  However it is all Drama and stories leading to Westlemania, the draft and into the summer.  AAHHH how I can not live with out my weekly dose of smackdown.|`|gNeFtZdBaa	EDGE IS THE BEST|`|wcgkX4lVaa	Well now that I read that Umaga got injured after falling over the ropes I think that Legacy came in earlier than expected. I think that it was suppose to be a clean match and once whoever would have won's music hit they'd come out and attack Triple H. But since Umaga got injured, they needed to come in earlier to take the camera's attention off of Umaga and fill in the extra time. Then again, who knows :/<br>  <br>  SD!Q: I think he should have went total ape ish on Matt but he did say he wouldn't fight him. So I sort of knew he wouldn't hit him back.<br>  <br>  SD!Q2: Haha yeah. I mean she was being "taken care of" by Big Show and gave him main event matches against The Undertaker and she seemed soooo focused on him while Edge was gone. Now she's naming Big Show the number one contender for the WHC out of the blue? That's a little fishy, haha.|`|58h70voyaa	Not a hole lot but i dident think he wasent|`|yl86ZQ6Daa	I knew Orton would get Triple H... I was just waiting for it to happen!...|`|JeACGbWNaa	I wasnt expecting the legacy to turn up attack and attack HHH, but wen it happened i was kinda expecting John Cena to come back out again and even things up a bit, or infact any 1 from out back. then again thats the only way Randy Orton can beat Triple H, by having his 2 boyfriends wth him.!!!!<br>  <br>  Iv said before on another question, Randy will win at wrestlemania, then the following week HHH will be drafted to Raw and set up The New Evolution involving Himself, Batista and HBK, to take on the legacy and destroy them once and for all. Y else do u think HHH mentioned Evolution when talking to Randy on Raw, and Batista will be back from injury aswell, and HBK will end Takers streak at Mania.<br>  <br>  I may be a bit biased, but i think Matt has every right to beat up Jeff and be annoyed with him, at the end of the day Matt has been here longer than Jeff, and all he got woz the ECW title, whereas Jeff got chucked in with the big boys on sd and won the WWE title, but y did Jeff get 6 attempts at the WWE title, if u dont win on ure 1st title shot, u shld go back to the bottom of list and work ure way up again.!!!<br>  <br>  Vickie and Big Show, now thats gross 2 beached whales 2gether.!!<br>  I just hop Big Show destroys Edge coz he is such a cheater and cant win the title without cheating.!!!

Drink it a lot before the day you have gym. If you get a side ache then you can pinch your side were you feel pain. Side aches are caused by breathing too shallow. Try to keep calm durring this. You don't always have to go super fast. Go at a slower pace and when you feel good, you can speed up. Good luck!|`|JZoC7K4saa	practice beforehand. if you try running similar measured circuits outside of school, that should help.<br>  don't drink to much water before running as that can lead to cramps - just have small sips very often and stop around 10 minute before you are going to run.<br>  good luck

Or more specifically, what goes into making a good match. I guess it's because I'm always watching new wrestling matches and constantly growing as a fan. I've started exposing myself to different aspects of prowrestling around the world so that enables my opinions to grow and develop. Besides, I'm looking into a career in some sort of production and marketing in the future, so I'm always critical of what kind of things appeal to me.

It does depend on what martial art you're studying; but from my experience working in a school- that is the best way to get them, if your instructor will allow them. The school can usually buy the products at wholesale from their supplier; so u'll prob. save a little bit bying them that way. The shoes aren't cheap, by any means; even with the school discount u'll prob. pay between $75-$100.

1KeJEHvYaa	Did you read the article in the Sport Illustrated magazine that had the Arod story. They said that there many names possibly not as big as Arod but when the reporter from S.I. magazine asked him about the test results he immediately started telling his trainer to get her out of there and she shouldn't be here and when she told him all she wanted was an answer he just told her that she would have to talk to the union about it. Eventually he chose to come out and fess up to it. Because he knew sooner or later all the names are going to be leaked out because all the tell all books coming out about the steroid use in the MLB. It's not just Conseco spilling all the beans. So Arod figured might as well tell now now then try to hide it and be scrutinized for trying to lie. I think the excuse he gave for doing the roids was a cop out, I feel like everyones excuse were cop outs, Clemens took them to "get over and injury", McGwire took them to  "beat old age", Bonds took them cause he said, "everyone else was so why not" and Arod said he took them because, "I had to, to be the Arod everyone wanted". I just feel like hey if you took them you were and idiot. No I don't think any of them should be let into the Hall of Fame, I know alot of people are gonna be mad but that's how I feel. It's dumb not to let Pete Rose in the hall of Fame for betting and he did not bet on his own team, but they will sure as hell let roid disgrace, yes, but I also think that the issue just needs to be dropped. It's just a sticky , touchy subject you know. I'm a Cubs fan.|`|axxQzOCHaa	I admit to being a Yankee hater, but the fact that the other 103 names haven't been made public is cause for suspicion. I have said for years that they should make all records public, whether if one is guilty or innocent.<br>  <br>  I see your point Arrested, but I'd rather one be an average player without steroids / hgh, than be one of the best with the help of illegal performance enhancers, whether if they were illegal at the time or not.|`|1ccf4408a6862b6272c7872e63b19c51aa	I'm not protecting Him because he needs to be More Honest.|`|tvuhGTD9aa	NO ONE on the list should have been disclosed. Whomever did leak Rodriguez's name almost certainly had an agenda in so doing, and he was probably the biggest, highest-profile name on the list not already associated (however strongly or tenuously) with PED usage. A practical exercise in "the bigger they are, the harder they fall".<br>  <br>  The remainder of the list, while obviously in the wrong hands, is supposed to be kept confidential by standing agreement between MLB and the MLBPA. Now, those wrong hands are very likely a third party (the feds) not beholden to that agreement -- but the list is also under court seal. Leaking even just the one name could be a crime (and therefore, deserving of punishment). Upholding the law MUST take precedence over the curiosity of any one or legion of snoopy baseball fans.<br>  <br>  We never should learn the remaining names on that list. I hope we never do. I recognize that, eventually, we likely will.<br>  <br>  I doubt the deliberate leakage had anything to do with Being A Yankee and everything to do with Being ARod.|`|YjTU7Psyaa	The others will slowly leek out, just like Arod. The test was supposed to be anonymous and not released, but whatdya know, ones already out. They leaked Arod because he is arguably one of the  best top 3 or so current baseball players. Letting his name come out first causes all this outrage and pandemonium, they knew it would.Everybody in baseball knows who Arod is- its a pretty big deal!<br>  Soon, more will come out. Especially because everybody is going crazy and wants to know so bad. Now people think- If Arod was one of them, who else?? Manny Ramirez?? Big Papi??|`|7HRLYfjaaa	Because Arod is on path to be one of the greatest baseball players ever so its a big deal|`|haxPqmIgaa	im a YH and i honestly think there might b some payoffs.
XRw2ux9waa	People can only guess what's going to happen at The Draft this year. Seeing as Vince doesn't want any inside information getting out online, and it's really frustrating him, a lot of WWE may not even know their selves who's being drafted at the moment.<br>  <br>  Similar to last year. Some to none of the superstars in the 2008 Draft didn't even know they would be drafted. Jim Ross had no clue what was going on, and actually was about to retire because he was drafted away from his home, Monday Night RAW. Other superstars who were drafted, you could tell the surprise on their face. Not like previous drafts. <br>  <br>  So, like I said, you can only guess who will be drafted. <br>  <br>  Christian Cage To Smackdown.<br>  <br>  He went to ECW so he could be known with the newer fans. WWE made a mistake when Jericho debuted and the new fans didn't know who Jericho was, so their working differently with Christian. By the time the draft comes, Christian will be over with the new crowd and be ready for a much bigger stage.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  John Cena to Smackdown<br>  <br>  He's seemingly storylineless on RAW, except for a small feud with Edge, who's currently on Smackdown. Since Edge is the king of Smackdown at the moment, and his wife being the Smackdown GM, I can't see Edge moving, so I see Cena moving to Smackdown, recreating his feud with Edge and having a fresh new list of opponents.<br>  <br>  <br>  CM Punk to SmackDown<br>  <br>  Punk has done a lot on Raw, but somehow, I think it would be hard for him to break back into the main event there. I think if he were drafted to SmackDown, he could rev up the momentum and potentially burst back into the main event.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Mickie James to Smackdown<br>  <br>  Similar to John Cena, nothing to do on RAW.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  MVP to RAW<br>  <br>  Newly turned face, and done with a losing streak. He could do well with a move to Raw and hopefully gaining some momentum there, also breaking into the main event like CM Punk.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Undertaker to RAW<br>  <br>  The biggest change that should happen is Undertaker. I think switching brands is definitely the right thing to do, he's out of things to do on his brand. Undertaker on Raw has 'Taker/HBK, 'Taker/Orton, 'Taker/Jericho, and more.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Triple H to RAW:<br>  <br>  Triple H was placed on Smackdown in order to help draw views when WWE switched stations to My Network TV. That's done now, and Since Cena is moving to Smackdown, I can only predict that Triple H will be taking his place, also the fact that he's in another feud with Orton, who's - Like Edge's case, on a different brand.<br>  <br>  <br>  I didn't make any ECW predictions because of two reasons. Over the past several months I heard ECW is to be merging with one of the two main brands. And the second reason is simple, I just don't know who would move there.|`|4tvI9WYjaa	i read that to <br>  rey mysterio is coming back to smackdown triple h possible raw batista  to smackdown jim ross back to raw for michael cole  chris jericho to smackdown edge to raw i wonder who is going to get the big trade this year?
GCOrku95aa	I certainly hope so. As a Martin fan, I can tell you I'm tired of the engine failures, and it's only March! Mark didn't have this many engine failures over the past 3 seasons combined! Here's hoping it's all behind them and the 5 car runs solid. I'd feel great if he finished the race, but I'd feel a helluva lot better if he won!<br>  <br>  <br>  Oh, and good luck to Kurt, too!|`|JfGVUh9aaa	Mark is doing awesome. I watched qualifying and at the end they said Mark Martin is the second oldest to win a pole at 50 year's old. First oldest is Harry Gant at 54ish.<br>  This is his 1st pole in like 276 races. He made sure to mention he started 2nd, six times with DEI in the 8 last year.<br>  <br>  And how can you not root for the "Blue #2 Ford Miller Light Hot Rod".<----That's Rusty talking......and me.|`|50e3b0849b4360114052f91433a42927aa	yes i think he will do well this sunday........he is running good this year,which i like to see out of the miller lite dodge.........believe i will drink a few lites come sunday.............he has decent stats at atlanta,and performs well on the intermidiate tracks,hopefully he can stay out of trouble.|`|yt4PN1R4aa	I thought Kurt Busch was going to have a really good year. His best with Penske probably. I predict 4th in points by year's end. <br>  <br>  Except my predictions have been way off so far.|`|AA10431326	Go Mark Martin, I am thrilled to see him sitting on the pole at Atlanta.|`|S2vI4VEXaa	I just hope that this week his car doesn't croak on him..<br>  It sure was sweet seeing the Duece up front, and Kurt's still a great driver..too bad Penske's turned into a somewhat sub-par team.<br>  <br>  Mark Martin will be fine, he's in the best equipment in NASCAR..and the 5 car has been running stronger than it has since the late 90's..<br>  Rick wants to get him a championship.|`|XNdDrXAzaa	I could give you my thoughts on your question, but my answer might get deleted. Oh golly gee... I hope i'm not chatting with you, or my answer might get deleted for that. O.K. How shall I put this... I "predict" Kurt Busch finishes better than the #5 car. And I aint saying this just because i'm a MoPar fan... (yes I am) Darn it! Now i'm thinking out loud!|`|3971fad8bfeb5090ffc3629ffe9dbd80aa	I'm real happy for Kurt. He's been struggling & having some of the worst luck most of last season. I'm very glad to see him doing good. Mark Martin, what can you say, he was so happy today and I'm glad to see him hold onto the pole. He had a great car last week too. It would be nice to see some different faces winning this year, but I'm still pullin for Junior too.|`|YHYT8qMKaa	Yeah, Kurt is doing real well. I'm not surprised, though. Kurt is a great driver and last year was just a struggle with the COT. I had a feeling that his team would rebound like this. And Mark has been doing good as well. Even though he had the engine failures, he has been up front and fast in these first few races. I think both of them will do well on Sunday.|`|595902780e2c09920890743b229c9c08aa	Im very very happy to see Kurt doing better. I don't think I could take another year like 2008. Im hoping the #2 car keeps it going through November. Yes Im very stoked!<br>  <br>  It made my day today to see Mark Martin get the pole and strut his stuff this weekend. The number 5 has always had a spot in my heart ever since Terry Labonte drove the Kellogs car.<br>  <br>  Have a great weekend everybody!|`|i8soZLfRaa	I think Mark will prove that it's not a fluke that he's on top of the speed charts week after week. Busted engines aside, he has run well.<br>  <br>  Kurt is showing his kid brother what qualifying is all about. Kyle is consistantly showing his big bro what winning is all about.<br>  <br>  Kyle is growing up, his attitude was bad, but HEY, he's winning races!<br>  <br>  >> Fluffy, you're killing me, when have you ever been afraid. Deleted is afraid of you! <br>  "Deleted has nightmares about Fluffy"<br>  "Fluffy lives under Deleted's bed"<br>  Fluffy's tears cure cancer, too bad fluffy never cries<br>  <br>  ROFLMfAO

vJyF8siJaa	Keys to the game: Focus<br>  <br>  Tacos: Yes<br>  <br>  Lakers will win and be first to 50 wins.<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Yes, the long wait for another Lakers game is over, can't wait for them to play.|`|mwxKnUleaa	I got the Lakers winning the game. It would be a big blow losing ground in the overall standings for the number one overall seed in the playoffs. As for the keys to the game I say since both teams have had a couple days off they might come into the game a little sloppy so a fast start might do the trick. Avoid turnovers and play good defense. Limit three point makes, because In the last game both teams made a lot of three's and neither team could pull away. As a Lakers Fan I hope the team comes out with something to prove and they play lock down defense to give the fans some tacos.|`|HtYGxZcCaa	wow did you really ask who would win a game in such a monumental mismatch between the Lakers and TWolves? lol<br>  <br>  The Lakers and yes the fans get tacos because the Lakers will give up points in garbage time and they will win 121-103 and from my knowledge 100 points=free taco|`|c7992d905ee1715cf5c3ed1c09c6ee98aa	Lakers <br>  1) Box out <br>  2) Play aggressive defense <br>  3) Use shot clock <br>  4) Use subs <br>  <br>  Wolves <br>  1) Box out <br>  2) Play aggressive defense <br>  3) Keep ball out of Kobe's hand's <br>  4) Push the ball <br>  <br>  Final Score <br>  Laker's - 93 <br>  <br>  Wolves - 98 <br>  <br>  Sorry but I smell an upset!|`|83ebpB19aa	Lol. This isn't even close. The Lakers will win by 20-25 points.<br>  Keys to the game: Lakers<br>  1.Once you have a lead, don't blow it.<br>  2.Take advantage of the triple threat.<br>  3.Get the defensive boards.<br>  <br>  Minnesota:<br>  1.Make Kobe shoot.<br>  2.Stay out of the paint.<br>  3.Move the ball around a lot.|`|H8u7gMAYaa	Keys to the game:<br>  <br>  1) Play consistant defense for 4 quarters<br>  <br>  2) Don't give up easy shots, layups<br>  <br>  3) Kobe needs to limit his shots <br>  <br>  4) Our bench needs to step up tonight. They haven't been there lately<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I'm going for my Lakers: 105-96|`|kZuktZ3iaa	defense.<br>  and the bench.<br>  <br>  <br>  if they play defense for more then 10 minutes<br>  which has been a lakers regular thing since the end of november<br>  and if the bench performs well<br>  <br>  they got this.<br>  <br>  && yes.<br>  they will get tacos.|`|bSuUpZvSaa	Warriors crushed the Wolves 118-94<br>  <br>  Imagine what Lakers are gonna do!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|4rURc0roaa	I wonder if Kobe will ask for a blindfold during the game to give the Wolves a fighting chance|`|65H77wolaa	Lakers Win<br>  100-50|`|bxnMQQMJaa	this isn't a serious question........Lakers in a blowout|`|014d662e9ccdcc2dfcbd68b27f469d57aa	Lakers<br>  They will win<br>  If they don't <br>  Oh well|`|Kwywmcs8aa	Lakers<br>  <br>  Theres no hope for Minnesota without Al Jefferson.|`|u2QhQAxzaa	I have never gotten my tacos!!!

rabjcdjHaa	Mo Rivera!|`|WUuO6wbAaa	Well, you're a Yankees fan, so of course we know your answer lol I have a lot of respect for Rivera, who's awesome, but K-Rod just broke the save record. He's only 27. Basing on last season, Lidge would be the best closer in baseball. Papelbon and others are up there too... But just between K-Rod and Rivera, I'll go with K-Rod. Every year Rivera's had since '03, besides '07, has been awesome. But he's 39 years old.|`|c03a1e29209b69a15065f8edab5c54daaa	Mo any day of the week and twice on Sunday.  K-Rod is overrated, washed up and not even the best closer on the Mets.|`|6tGYe5roaa	Mo. He has been doing it better and for a whole lot longer. Also, despite his age he has shown no signs of slowing down.<br>  <br>  Good Night Janet! :)|`|RKMWeMk9aa	Mo Rivera he is one the greatest closers in MLB history!|`|AA10349169	Game 7 of a WS?<br>  Rivera anyday|`|TCehI17kaa	I hate to sound biased but this question shouldn't even be asked Lol!   Bu I'll say Mo.|`|1ccf4408a6862b6272c7872e63b19c51aa	I take K ROD he is a Better reliever|`|tDM1RVH4aa	Well if I could get both players when they first started their careers I would pick, Mariano Rivera because while K-Rod might possibly be better overall, Mariano Rivera has done it at such a high level for so long that you know you will get your money's worth and then some.  When he retires, while he will not have the best season(s) of any closer ever, but he will have the best career of any closer ever.<br>  <br>  As of right now though, even despite Rivera's excellent last season (steroids? he's a Yankee you never know!), you'd have to be an idiot not to pick K-Rod.|`|rw36hFo7aa	well if mo was younger i would pick him because he didnt have one blown save. I know K-Rod broke the save record but thats just because he had more chances so that doesn't mean anythign but he is 26 or 27 so he would be a good franchise closer because Mo is going to retire in a couple years and his career is only going down hill whil K-Rod is just entering his prime|`|J1w0Ewy0aa	Mo has been better almost every single year. And has more rings and post season dominance than K-Rod. K-rod is one of the best relievers in the game today, Rivera is the best reliever of all time. Period. Last year, at age 39, his numbers were much better than K-Rod's even though he's much younger. His team just sucked last year and didn't give him save opportunities.|`|J9GWbyAvaa	Mo.<br>  K-Rod is too dramatic. he allows to many baserunners.<br>  Mariano is 1-2-3, game over every night.|`|9a54C8nTaa	What are you guys nuts? K-Rod. He has more saves then Mo since 2004 and he just set the single season save record. All time i would pick Mo but as of now Mo's days are done.|`|vOBZPDgcaa	I would choose a Trevor Hoffman over those two any day but to truly answer your question, Fransisco Rodruiguez.|`|pChoen9haa	Mariano Rivera Is Much Better.|`|v9bTfQGMaa	Mo Rivera, I just think he's better, in my opinion:)|`|30bec3177e3b5db11c5b72b82bf84bb5aa	Gott go with Mo..proven over the years. I hope K-Rod has a big year for the Mets though!<br>  <br>  Viva LA YFFL!|`|CK45Qeulaa	MO MO MO MO MO MO MO MO MO MO MO|`|1uSoU8Lpaa	Mo is the Ice-Man, he can pitch under pressure. He's got ice water running through his veins.|`|V97ddsyyaa	Mo younger but now K-rod|`|M0eyMvqlaa	Would I be biased if I chose K-Rod? <br>  <br>  Peace!|`|KTp27Fokaa	Well, it depends.<br>  <br>  I'd rather build my team around K-Rod because he's younger<br>  <br>  But for one game, I would take Mo. He hardly ever blows saves and has been one of the clutchest Yankee players.|`|g9P7oWyeaa	IS THIS EVEN A QUESTION !? <br>  Mariano Rivera anytime anyday anywhere <br>  He's actually the only Yankee I like. <br>  34 post-season saves, 0.77 ERA .. thats soo non-human like <br>  He's almost too perfect, too bad he blew that save in 01<br>  But yeah, yeah yeah, K-Rod and all that save record, who cares ?!<br>  I'd probably take Soria, PAPELBON, Nathan, over him anyday. <br>  Well we could say im a little biased since K-Rod is like my most hated MLB player right there next to A-Rod [ they're both great its just that]<br>  <br>  My rant is over, so yea Mo anytime. [:|`|utTFiz3gaa	this is quite an unfair question for everyone is about to choose Mo <br>  <br>  well i'm sticking up for the ex-angel but to answer your question first i say Mo, he's quick with outs, unbelievable cutter and a shoe in hall of famer :)<br>  <br>  now Frankie has a wicked slider change up combo that is absolutely sick i mean take it from someone who knows (i've been watching him close games ever since he's been an angel .. 6 years!) he's great. Yes a bit overrated in a way and he is definitely a roller coaster ride but he doesn't blow as much saves as you think he would. <br>  <br>  p.s. I like Frankie's passion.. not annoying to me :) nothing wrong with thanking god and his grandpa who passed away.|`|P93I8CHtaa	the save leader is who i pick|`|u1T5TQP7aa	I would definitely, no doubt pick K-Rod
QPyFTOhYaa	i have tried just to see if i could but i just felt really sad and low. I think it has something to do with the pressure or something whos knows lol .|`|KTj3z0loaa	Yes of course you can but obviously it wont look like it because you're surrounded by water anyway.|`|y9z65Rndaa	well... not really, you can feel sorrow under water but not cry.|`|hMH0lUdwaa	People stop asking this question|`|AA11211091	Lol. No. I tried to one time. Like i could feel the warmness of my tears coming out and going up on top of the water. But no not really :PP|`|DEHBIqJraa	it would depend on the depth of water and the pressure.|`|PwW0Ng8Qaa	no|`|GHefTsUyaa	It's certainly not against the Law.|`|x2yUC47Zaa	I think the amount of water above you would prevent anymore tears from falling. But like the first answer you can feel anguish, pain, sorrow, betrayal, suffering, heart-break, sadness, depression, anger, indecisive feelings, hate, rage, and mad at yourself because you feel like you never took advantage of the things that were around you a long time ago; now being your greatest downfall and the reason why you feel all these feelings, as well as the fact that your friends from Elementary school don't even want to hang out anymore and you're left in your house with but not a single thing to do except be all sad and depressed over the fact that that part of your life is gone and you'll do anything to get it back, which, in your mind causes nothing but anguish in your mind about the whole situation which seems interminable and unbearable and as well as the love you shared for a girl who turned out to be nothing but a ふざけんなよand now you look back at how stupid you were to have loved her at all and still have mixed feelings about the situation, and as a way to recap, You're alone, sad, depressed, indecisive, AND MOST OF ALL WISH YOU HAD A FREAKING ガールフレンド!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
gUMucKOkaa	Sizemore is definitely the better pick. In addition to almost equal power he adds speed. Sizemore is considered the number six overall pick in most rankings. Braun is not far behind, but is behind. Check it out.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|4uSRVZNNaa	I go with sizemore here.  they are virtually even in every stat category with exception of stolen bases.  sizemore is significantly superior here.  if it was last year I would say a toss up because of braun's added 3b eligibility but he's just an OF now.|`|e0M5lpc2aa	Sizemore, only because he adds steals as well. Having a solid 5 tool player in fantasy baseball is a tremendous advantage. That's why Hanley Ramirez, at such a shallow position, is a top 4/5 pick.<br>  <br>  I'd also probably take Josh Hamilton over Braun as well. While Braun had a good year last year, his numbers dropped, and I can't see his numbers rising. Hamilton's numbers jumped (you see the HR derby at all??), and I see him hitting 35+ with 130 RBI again. He also hits .300+ in comparison to Brauns .280. While that .020 might not be a "huge" difference, it can definitely make an impact in fantasy baseball. It also means he has a 20 point chance of hitting you more HR and RBI.|`|hN36KWkraa	Definitely Ryan Braun<br>  Sizemore is more like a 2nd rounder<br>  u might get both<br>  but yeah definitely in the 1st round 5th pick<br>  Ryan Braun or maybe Jose Reyes??<br>  good luck!!

KYaM65gzaa	no thast not all he can do. in the cava games ive seen hes very good at gettin on the offensive glass for put backs and layups, whether or not he lands in between. yes he  could shoot a little better.<br>  championships are generally the measure of greatness in this league LBJ will win some, but it's not black and white title wise for example: Steve Kerr won 4 rings (in a row!) is he better than LBJ too?|`|tzrLDbHWaa	You may be right, but I seriously doubt that LeBron  doesn't work on his shot.  I mean, he's not a bad shooter, but he's not on Kobe's level when it comes to pure shooting.  They have a diferent playstyle though.  LeBron is a SF and their game is usually more slashing than outside shooting.|`|piZ4xDBqaa	LeBron is scoring an awful lot of points for someone who's only an average shooter.  His outside game could use some improvement, sure, but suggesting he won't be as good as Kobe until he can shoot from outside is just plain wrong.  They're different players with different styles, and LeBron has an inside game that Kobe just can't match.  And LeBron isn't going inside and counting on the ref to bail him out.  If the other team doesn't foul him, he's going to slam the ball down.|`|13XU8cCKaa	In "my opinion" LeBron is better than Kobe.  If your saying that LeBron will never be better than Kobe until he doesn't get a jump shot like Kobe is dumb.  Thats like saying Daequan Cook is better than Dwight Howard.  LeBron is a SF and they are usally slashers.  He scores at will.|`|RMKvHJdnaa	true i agree wit u....i was watchin one of da cavs games n lebron missed 4 shots ina row...if he could nail dem jumpers he would be ALMOST the next micheal jordon...n kobe...hes very good...VERY good|`|5FypDafWaa	no lebron is better than kobe and his ego

3rmVGqWsaa	Don't you have to have at least 9 players to have a tennis team? 3 doubles and 3 singles? i don't understand your question.<br>  <br>  <br>  ~Claire~|`|gnRiLwSxaa	It seems reasonable to me.    The coach has limited court time for his or her players, and limited match opportunity for them to actually compete.    Your numbers do not make sense, by the way.  If 13 are cut, there will be 16 left, not 24.|`|wsQ6G8OEaa	That's like 3 doubles teams and 2 singles for varsity and more for jv not that harsh.  Just play awesome.

I mean you don't have to go fishing. Can't you do anything else? There are a lot of other fun things. Or just do pushups.|`|qsqmykzsaa	I love fishing too.<br>  sometimes I take my 13 y/o grandson. we have taught him to fish and he loves it too.<br>  what about your parents or grandparents?<br>  Would they take you?|`|JxmJg37Iaa	go with a family member then
4uSRVZNNaa	if you have power to spare in your lineup you should definitely do this trade.  hardy will still give you decent power numbers and won't kill your average like dunn will.  <br>  adding zambrano will make your pitching staff unstoppable even if somebody goes down with an injury. and unless your league has holds or krod goes down putz is almost useless.<br>  I would get rid of tejada if you can too.  with his legal troubles and steroid issues he may get a mysterious "injury" too like arod did or giambi a few years back.  plus he's going to be 35 this year (allegedly), an age where most ballplayers start to decline.  his stats have declined over the past 3 seasons.|`|hN36KWkraa	Definitely accept that!!!<br>  you would have the nastiest pitching in the wholee leaguee!!<br>  and really Adam Dunn playing in Watching wont be his usual 45HR and 190strikeouts<br>  he  would be more like 35HR and 250 strikeouts<br>  so he isnt really all that good<br>  i really encourage u to accept the trade<br>  good luck!|`|Uh0EGOu4aa	couldn't have said it better than fonz, if u have power to spare then do the deal.  otherwise hold on to dunn.  <br>  <br>  i would get rid of tejada as well, maybe try hardy for tejada first, or just drop tejada for someone else, since his stats are going to shoot down super fast.
guAFsmNjaa	hopeless|`|BQ7rS5m2aa	I always thought he was pretty good. He came 4th in highest disposals  for Carlton tonight against Geelong notching up 19 disposals.<br>  <br>  And plus, he's only 22, it takes most players a few years to really get a feel of what AFL is like and to get their confidence up and going.|`|aN4SUKkRaa	Never heard of him. Must be a waste of talent then if he's been around for 4 years!|`|EUaIGX0Gaa	who is this guy|`|4pi34FMeaa	who???? who does he play for??|`|H7AcXAyaaa	He is still young and can turn it around.|`|2s244jGgaa	I have heard about this guy, i dont remember how but I remember hearing of him to be a bit slow and slack at every possession opportunity. Being picked 9th is a big thing, to be in the top 10 is such an honour - he is not making ful use of it.
a6cb15fd4b323dbc753a289a5e6f7a87aa	Probably since he enters at #30 I would say that John Cena would have the best chances of winning.|`|VU6ODC5Baa	Probably Kurt Angle|`|vGmN4bGhaa	John Cena ?|`|8zVXZQmEaa	Kane|`|bSsBGrZVaa	"HBK"<br>  Shawn Michaels|`|AA11482019	RVD #27|`|qo0kKtvpaa	John cena, because he is always on the script to win.|`|4tvI9WYjaa	wait for it the lights go off where here mr kennedy kennedy !|`|fmUGHvgHaa	rvd gonna win #27 is the lucky one|`|rgQ2zUkxaa	whoever is scrpited to win

a9f693c71e4b465afcc9a6b377b02694aa	1) For this year's draft, there are 7 rounds.<br>  <br>  2) The number of picks per round is at least 30, depending on compensatory picks, a round can have more than 30 picks (this year Phoenix gets a compensatory pick in round #1 for Boston signing Blake Wheeler)<br>  <br>  3) Play extremely well, and you'll get noticed.  For this year's draft, over 30,000 draft eligible players from around the world are in the system, the top ones have been ranked by various entities (THN, ISS, NHL Central Scouting, etc).|`|hyL72qdVaa	30 picks per round 7 rounds

2Bl7zOO4aa	Sprint or Earnhardt towers. Best seats in the house.|`|mIdcJEJNaa	Depalma, or Earnhardt without a doubt..<br>  Go to daytonainternationalspeedway.com..<br>  Check out the "virtual seating" chart..<br>  It will shown you the view from any seat in the house..|`|uTrPQ4Gdaa	turn three, in the box. you can see back down the backstretch, the start/finish line, and it's where the excitement always is. if you sit too low in the stand on any turn, you won't be able to see much of the track. remember, it's 2.5 miles! and a tri-oval, so it's a little different in terms of viewing angles. most seats cannot see the entire track.  Otherwise, most of the seats are about the same since they're mostly along the start/finish side. Either side has its blinds spots, ust make sure you're  up high enough to see, but not so high you're in the goodyear blimp. <br>  <br>  or... if you ever get the chance, go camp out in the  infield. i did it 10 years running for the 500, and its the most fun! super loud though, and you can get hit with things from the track. but definitely the best time i've had in nascar.|`|i8soZLfRaa	In the driver's seat of the car that is the first to cross the stripe at the end of the race!<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Ask anyone who's been in THAT seat and they'll tell you it's the best seat in the house!<br>  <br>  KMA all thumbs down, that is the only/best answer!<br>  <br>  >> I can't believe that no one else thinks that that is the best seat to have. Even "The Intimidator" died trying to be in that seat. C'mon folks, that has got to be THE best seat at Daytona.|`|PGlZn1wEaa	Turn 4.  Oldfield or Depalma.  I explain all the time. Take it however you want from experience.  Start/Finish is overrated and borderline crap.  <br>  <br>  Have a nice night.|`|0829df852fa519b2e4acb82ff156a13eaa	Winston (now Sprint) Tower|`|qZpcgXgDaa	i think you should sit in the back strech because usually cars wreck there. i always like to sit there.|`|eIwYlDT2aa	well i would have 2 say mid pac becuse the pole never wins just avoid a reck and you got a good shot|`|zdh6aq8oaa	Any where, It's Daytona not a bad seat in the house.

YajYjjxLaa	I'm sure he has his happy moments every now and then|`|XQoH9ZI5aa	No. Rumours are his boyfriend might be though.|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	First off, rumours on the internet...step away from the computer.  Secondly, it's Sidney.  Sydney is a city in Australia.  Sidney...name of a hockey player.<br>  <br>  Look, I find Crosby and his legion of female puck bunny fans among the most annoying people on this planet (right up there with people who solicit religion by knocking on my door, loudmouth jerkwads on their mobile phones, and the idiots who drive 30km/h below the speed limit on dry pavement), but his private life is just that- his private life.<br>  <br>  With that being said, I could care less if he is into men, women, or box turtles.  It's not my business, nor is it yours. Of course, if you're looking to ask him out on a date, take a number behind the puck bunnies, and wait your turn.|`|9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	Yes...and rumor is he has eyes for you, big guy! Honestly why in the F*** do you even care what someone elses sexual preferences are? God I hate these ignorant *ss questions (and I used to wonder why Bob got so uptight all the time....now I am getting it!). The Village People were gay too....go buy their record and wheel the record player into your bathroom....the rest should be self explanitory!|`|XuGFt3boaa	No.  You don't nothing about Crosby.|`|d7769329bd0a2936e9a45b35adc6db88aa	yes and he wants your number|`|AA12167030	I don't know that his sexual orientation would have any impact on his ability to play hockey, so I'm not sure why this is even an issue. I'd kind of love it if he was and came out, though. The hopes and dreams of so many Puck Bunnies would be crushed instantly. Statistics make it highly likely that SOMEWHERE in the NHL is at least one homosexual person among all of the players, team staff, and officials and there's probably more than just one.|`|y531A4FAaa	they're rumors, you can't believe 'em until you have hardcore evidence/proof. before reading this question, that never crossed my mind.|`|SBBNsgKfaa	Just wait for him in San Jose and kidnapped him to San Francisco.|`|PDF2NUZKaa	Who the f**k cares???

4uSRVZNNaa	I know its a temptation to grab sizemore but wells has developed a hammy problem that will probably plague him the rest of the season if not his career.  his base stealing days are done.  don't forget he plays on turf half the season which is rough on the legs and he runs a lot playing CF.<br>  I think holliday will be fine in oakland.  he won't put up monster avg like in colorado but his road avg has improved every year since he came to the bigs.  and he will still get you 20-30 SB.  I think he will still be a force.  abreu is hitting in a great lineup and is virtually a lock for 20/20 and 100/100. true he is aging and those stats may decline slightly but he is still a solid player who is more reliable than wells.<br>  unless you have a deep OF, or you can get another player better than wells, I say don't do this trade.|`|da6e80356582b46ab1025eb8248a43e0aa	no question at all u do seizmore is the now a top 5 player and who knows wells could break out any time. Holliday is now a 3rd perhaps a 4th round player becsaue of the move to thepitcher friendly park as for abreu i dont belive he is that great hes solid but the chance to grab seizmore is too great<br>  <br>  edit: didnt know wells was injuried well idkthen but im telling you i dont trust holliday this yearif you can swap him for seizmore then you'll win the deal|`|eSL9tWnQaa	I believe he gets the better of that deal. Abreu will be better than Wells, and Holliday has very consistent numbers year in and year out, and the A's have surrounded Holliday with as good of a lineup as he had in Colorado. Sizemore is playing for an Indians squad that has lost it's pop from a few years ago.|`|hN36KWkraa	The guy gets the better deal<br>  dont tradeee!!<br>  you are gaining some stolen bases with sizemore but not as much cuz bobby gets some too<br>  and alfo Matt Holiday would be great with the A's as they have imporved a lot there offseason<br>  whille Vernon Wells is i think injured and that would probably bug him all season<br>  so dnt trade<br>  good luck!!|`|Uh0EGOu4aa	i would say this deal is very even, sizemore is a stud but wells is always a risk.<br>  <br>  holliday isn't as good as sizemore but abreu is better than wells.<br>  <br>  win win, or lose lose depending on how you look at it.  :^)

5MtNumoSaa	You say it's not about commitment anymore, but then complain that the coach expects you to actually show up for games? Sounds to me like it's completely about commitment.<br>  I agree with Frizzer in that we probably are not getting the whole story from you. And without that, I'm afraid I would probably side with the coach. I don't think it's too much to ask for players to be at every single game. A coach with players who are truly committed doesn't need to set such rules. I would guess that perhaps some of the players (not necessarily you) are not committed to the team. And with only 11 players, it's not like your coach has a lot of options if a couple of players decide not to show up. As rude as it may sound, I would suggest to you and your teammates to just suck it up. I doubt a petition would do any good, at least it wouldn't have helped at all when I was in High School. (back in the days when dinosaurs roamed the earth) If anything, I think the coach would probably make it even tougher on all of you as a result. <br>  Playing a varsity sport is a commitment. The school has committed money to pay the coach, to purchase uniforms and equipment, and to pay the umpires. That, in addition to insurance, field maintenance, etc. is a tremendous financial output for a school to take on. And if you or any of your teammates can't appreciate the time and effort it takes to even be a coach, and feel that breaking team rules as simple as "show up for the games". then perhaps a varsity sport is not for those particular young ladies.<br>  Sorry to sound harsh, but again, it sounds to me like there's a lot more to this story then just a coach being crazy.|`|b30195e932765839f31a572f8d05c0f8aa	Something tells me we are not getting the full story from you.  All of the team members have to understand the rules going in and there must be concessions from the coach if a player is not able to make a game because if illness or other valid reasons.  I really think we would get a totally different response from your coach.|`|2bkV73gpaa	Sorry, but you shouldn't be missing games unless you're sick, injured or it's a family emergency.<br>  <br>  Or unless you're like me and got suspended for a couple games for saying something about an umpire's manhood after he made an idiotic call.|`|haxPqmIgaa	Get a petition signed or you should all protest in someway. Maybe sit on the bench and dont move until she changes rules, or go gandi and fast... jk lol. i know it sounds babyish, but it mite work (exept the fasting1 wont lol|`|3XFHK7a8aa	Ask her what the basis of her rules are and why she set them the way she did.<br>  <br>  Convince her what she is actually doing. who knows, maybe she went through a bad breakup?? lol|`|QyJBl9aFaa	baseball/softball has always had rigid rules.  Other team sports do too, but playing on the diamond is unlike any other.  Baseball/Softball players are more of a "team" concept that requires all to function as 1.  All she is trying to do is instill these values in you and they are lessons you can take on for life.  Unless you work for yourself youll have to follow company rules, which attendance and punctuality are always going to be foremost.  You are of no value to your team for that game if you are not there.  Sounds to me like your coach has your future in mind when teaching you lessons now.

8LBk7vUpaa	I've been to hundreds of dirt tracks in N. America.  I tend to enjoy smaller dirt tracks more than tracks like Eldora and Knoxville, although I've seen great races everywhere, including witnessing Tom Bigelow's first ever USAC sprint car win at Eldora in '69, and Bobby Allen;s win at Knoxville in 1990.  The best track in history, for me, was Ascot Park in Gardenia, CA (sadly, shut down forever in '90).<br>  <br>  Here's my personal best list, of tracks still in operation.<br>  <br>  Bloomington Indiana<br>  Boone Iowa<br>  Parris California<br>  Petaluma California<br>  Kokomo Indiana<br>  East Alabama Speedway<br>  Silver Dollar in California<br>  Brewerton NY<br>  Sharon Speedway OH<br>  Cowtown in Kennedale TX<br>  <br>  Gee, only ten.  There's at least twenty more that I really like.  East Bay, near Tampa FL ain't fancy, but the racing is always great. <br>  <br>  I'd walk away from free tickets to any NASCAR event, anywere; to attend any one of the tracks listed above.<br>  <br>  Thanks for the question..|`|a4LWildhaa	The three I think are tops:<br>  <br>  Manzanita - Phoenix<br>  El Dora<br>  Knoxville|`|ZsxbOXtzaa	Used to know lots of them.

You can see more and the competition is closer.|`|MTbtsWtTaa	I haven't been to Ceder Lake (maybe someday) but I'll guess it's in the top ten based on what I've heard about it on message boards.  My list of top tracks include:<br>  <br>  Knoxville Raceway, IA (not the raciest of tracks but very fast and has a great history)<br>  <br>  Belleville High Banks, KS (possibly the fastest dirt track in the country and a 100 year history)<br>  <br>  Eldora Speedway, OH (site of some of the biggest and best paying dirt races in the US)<br>  <br>  Eagle Raceway, NE (I'm biased, I work there.  But it's the raciest track I've ever been to.  1/3 mile high banked track that always has 2 and 3 wide action)<br>  <br>  Springfield Mile, IL (gotta put a mile long track on the list, just for their history)<br>  <br>  I'm sure there are numerous tracks in the Northeast and Southeast that shold be included but I just don't hear much about them.....<br>  <br>  This is a VERY good question, it's too bad there aren't more people interested in dirt racing on this board......|`|eR7IZXdBaa	being from ohio I have to say Eldora is the best with Attica & Fremont a very close 2nd|`|NiOa9pyqaa	go to  racingaroundamerica.com  you will find all the tracks in the U S

WeEjc79Uaa	Id have to say metal for the best performance...<br>  Rubber doesn't get the best grip.|`|91052aeeaae7f679e0597b8689a2057aaa	Metal baseball cleats have the advantage because you can gain better traction on wet fields especially. Plus you can dig into the plate a lot better with metal spikes.|`|H78Mm1mlaa	if you play high school ball and you take the field with rubber spikes you will be laughed at. this isnt little league anymore. jk jk. metal spikes are cooler and you can cleat people a whole lot worse with metal. have a good season|`|wXyoo8mNaa	would u want to be slid into with metal cleats??|`|QYludYxzaa	I recommend metal.  You get the best traction by far.  There is alot less traction with rubber.  Although, there are 2 kids on my high school team that wear rubber cleats.  The one is our catcher, and he got the fastest time on the team running from home to second.  He runs like crazy.  The other kid is very fast to and all he wants to wear is rubber.  Sometimes I think that you can run faster in rubber, but get metal.|`|57czVj6paa	only like half these dudes know the game of baseball!!<br>  <br>  of course u get the metal spikes<br>  <br>  the coach will teach u how to slide and not cleat anyone<br>  and they give u a ton of better traction<br>  <br>  the only problem with them is that they take a little while to get used to, like maybe a couple practices.|`|14hGf7Glaa	number one if you go onto a high-school field with rubber cleats u might as well just urn around and go home, because u will look like an idiot. ha jk but yea rubber blows, get metal . way better traction|`|0klxQ775aa	medal<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  go redsox!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|H7AcXAyaaa	Rubber.|`|Rz9vY53Aaa	you need metal you get way better traction..but then again it depends on what surface you are playing if its astroturf rubber spikes..regular field just metal

yaq7oaH6aa	By the time you buy and properly fit a new barrel, <br>  you could buy a new rifle at the same or less cost.<br>  From your other question, I assume this is to be a target rifle.<br>  You will want a heavier and longer barrel, (for the stability), and <br>  a different stock shape from your 'hunter'.<br>  you might consider going to the '06' for the option of using longer, <br>  heavier bullets for long range shooting.<br>  You might look into the new Savages. <br>  I hear good things about that trick trigger, and that <br>  can be important for target work.<br>  You will want a specialized scope as well.<br>  That 9x variable won't 'cut it'.<br>  High power target is a strange game.<br>  I repeat my suggestion that you get your feet wet <br>  with what you've got and see how you like the<br>  game before you lay out a ton of dough for a specialized gun.<br>  Most shooters are more than happy to advise, <br>  and help out, a new shooter: 'spot' for you, and sometimes even lend you a spotting scope  or <br>  a mat, if they're not using it on your relay.|`|OAEuYZkZaa	Just buy a new or used .308 Win rifle and then you will have both the .270 and .308.. It would be no more expensive than buying a barreled action and having it fitted to your existing stock.<br>  <br>  Besides then you'd have a .270 barreled action in need of a stock.<br>  <br>  Just buy another rifle, you know that is what you want to do.<br>  <br>  Besides, a gun crank always needs one more rifle.<br>  <br>  Doc|`|h2KkiKK3aa	well, it's cheaper and more reasonable to buy a new gun.|`|oZj6DfpKaa	For the cost a changing the barrel you can go to Walmart and get a nice Weatherby Vanguard in .308 or check the pawn shops as they some times come available.<br>  <br>  If you are looking for a long range shooter, avoid the Rem 710 and 770s.  <br>  <br>  If price is the major consideration, price the above mentioned Weatherby against a Mossberg 4X4 in .308.  The Mossys are competitively priced.<br>  <br>  Also, check out the new Marlin XS7.  With an MSRP of 340 bucks, they are getting rave reviews as excellent shooters.  Just make sure to put Leupold STD scope mount and rings on it and a good scope (Nikon ProStaff?) or the rifle will never be able to live up to its potential.|`|FhHIAbmLaa	Your rifle is a long action. <br>  <br>  To change the action, you are buying a new gun. The action is the gun. <br>  <br>  Sell it, and buy a .308. Or you could re-barrel it in 30-06, and now you have a 30 caliber, a bit stronger than a .308.<br>  <br>  Complete, it should cost about 400 bucks. <br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|cR7Sf4cjaa	When you change the action and the barrel - you have changed out the entire rifle save the scope and stock.<br>  <br>  You would be much better off buying a new rifle.<br>  <br>  It's not a sin to own two rifles.|`|266ceb85ba0b67055921349df27eadb2aa	You can change the barrel but it would not be much cheaper than a new rifle.  You would not need to change the action, which is good because this is impossible.  A .308 will function in a long action rifle, but shorter is always better.  I would strongly recommend buying new rifle.
eff556e68b639b40e89cc7516013482faa	I think that you should check into your local laws to see what is required in order to pass. Some schools require at least one semester of swimming or you can't graduate. If your school requires it, you'll only have to do it later on, and that could put you behind and make you subject to even more ridicule later on. If it's a one-time-only offer thing, and you really want to get out of it, break a leg. Seriously. If you break an arm, it would make it more difficult for you to do your hair and makeup. No teenage girl wants that.<br>  <br>  Or<br>  <br>  You could move here to this little hick place. There's not a school in the entire county that has a pool. No motels, no gyms. In fact, if there's an indoor pool anywhere in this county, it's privately owned. As a result, unless your family has money for lessons, there's not many people who learned how to swim. What a shame.<br>  <br>  You have no idea how lucky you are. Trust me, you won't the the only one who's self conscious. The ones with the biggest mouths are usually the ones with the most to hide. Besides, any inconvenience you suffer from this class is only temporary.<br>  <br>  Maybe it's time to grow up. All of us at some time are forced to do things that we don't want to do. I don't want to pay my electric bill when my local shoe store is having a sale, but I do it anyway.|`|2U4U22cxaa	Just wear a worn out one piece that is pretty much see through. When you walk out to swim they will stop you and you say this is my only suit  and most likely they won't make you swim since your in PE class. I know its a little crazy but it works my friend did it once because no teacher wants that kind of distraction or potential problem in their class.|`|ND1nFEWSaa	note from your doctor stating swimming affects your ears|`|gELcwzNhaa	move out of p.e|`|kpTlEW59aa	u have cramps|`|iAhz88tEaa	**** the guys in the class. If youre an ugly girl, dont worry, youre one of the many more...in my old PE class, there were hot girls, and nasty ugly girls. We didnt even do swimming, but we didnt fuckin look at the stupid ugly fat chick runnin her 2 laps like a moron, and when we did, our eyes burned. so..people wont look at you if ur an ugly girl, and everybody probably would already know it so youre not losing anything. if youre a dude, **** the other guys who cares, either get in shape, or dont worry that ur 1 of..many fat dudes..ur not getting out of it so man the **** up and grow some TESTACLES|`|fSN0thP2aa	then don't!! accept the consequence that you fail if you dont!|`|bc5KJdaFaa	tell them you are on your period and are scared to use a tampon|`|RMKvHJdnaa	well if u break a bone ??haha um idk...ignore them...ur the better person..dont worry bout them..wat goes around comes around|`|t4xtqjjfaa	A doctors note excusing you from swimming is really the only way, but getting your doctor to write you one will be hard if you don't have some kind of real medical issue but its worth a shot, maybe your skin is sensitive to choline or the water hurts your ears. Make an appointment and talk to your doctor about it.
tqEJtkifaa	This may sound like a funny technique, but until I get my stride and breathing coordinated, I breath out twice (once per each step) then breath in once (another step).  So, for each step you take, you exhale twice, the inhale on the 3rd step.  This will allow you to get a good rhythm.  They your natural breathing technique will take over.|`|yUHh1Q8Qaa	Inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth and adjust the level of your activity to a pace where you can (barely) keep your breathing under control.  Eventually you will adapt and then you can increase the activity level as your endurance increases.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|Zz4FGiAEaa	If you put your hands over your head and up, it helps to open your airways.|`|qP1iHC0Taa	My gym teacher told me that when you are running a long way, you can breathe in from the nose and breathe out with your mouth half open. It works for me.|`|3iF7sb33aa	the best way to breath is in 2 breaths and then out 3 that switches the exhaling breath on your feet bc when you exhale you press down harder
RxTIzsyhaa	Depends on your area and if there is a' demand for them. Atlus Mikes has Roe/eggs in the vacuum packaged form that can be ordered online (link).

Wo2TEbHPaa	Its a possibility but very small. Girardi will get pulled from his job if he doesn't have the yanks in 1st by all-star break. If that would happen Im sure the yanks will have a former player of theres or even coach from the minors come up and manag them. Willie wont come to NY its to soon for him to return if ever. He be drowned by the media with mets questions and it wouldn't be easy returning to citi. I think willies content with being a bench coach for his small market team.|`|Rz9vY53Aaa	doubt it..I bet you girardi will do a decent job|`|Jyw78OPeaa	Hopefully so. I think Randolph did a great job as the Mets coach and got too much BS for not making the playoffs. The manager can only do so much, sometimes its the players. Get Girardi OUT OF HERE.|`|30bec3177e3b5db11c5b72b82bf84bb5aa	maybe...intriguing idea
hq46T7UWaa	Yeah like the other commenter said - it all depends on who is playing. Stubhub/TicketStumbler/Razorgator/Ticket... should have tickets either way.|`|fYIIRgVraa	It all depends on who is playing who that day. I have seen games in the Garden where St. John's play and it is 9/10 empty because nobody likes to watch St. John's stink it up on the court. If it is two teams that are high up then it would take probably 3-5 days before tickets are gone going off of prior years experience.

014d662e9ccdcc2dfcbd68b27f469d57aa	Okay<br>  You can't pick up the ball after you already dribbled, and you can't dribble with 2 hands. If you do any of these it's called double dribble.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	You cant pick up your dribble and dribble again.  You cant put 2 hands on the ball and then dribble again.  Its rather simple.|`|4l2qOy7Paa	when you dribble... hold the ball... and then dribble again. you have to pivet your feet if you want to pass the ball to someone.|`|1b4u5Ch7aa	double dribbling is when you dribble the ball then stop dribbling the ball then start dribbling again like say you r dribbling the you stop like for a few seconds to look around one you stop dribbling that ball you are suppose to pass to a different person but if you don't and dribble that is double dribbling HOPE I HELPED!!|`|adM9rI7Faa	ok so wen u dribble the ball and u stop and pick up ur dribble u cant start dribbling again. so once u stop dribbling u cant do it again unless u pass the ball and get it back or if a defender knocks it out and u get it back its so simple cmon dawg|`|bxnMQQMJaa	Lebron??? Is that you??|`|YOKuERs9aa	double dribbling is where you get the ball thru a pass or rebound or whatev, and u pick up the ball and dribble and u stop dribbling and then you dribble again.|`|bSuUpZvSaa	you catch or get the ball with two hands.<br>  <br>  you dribble around.<br>  <br>  then you hold the ball with two hands again.<br>  <br>  then you dribble again.<br>  <br>  THEN YOU GET A WHISTLE|`|WumhCEpVaa	be more clear but its when u bounce the ball with both hands then bounce a gain or bounce the ball stop and bounce it again
sVyH0jTiaa	You never knnnnnooooooowwwwwwwww|`|khbLZQHIaa	They'd have to play such a fast paced offense ... it's not even funny.<br>  <br>  But maybe with two high scoring, fast paced teams and two-three overtimes, it can be done.|`|Kwywmcs8aa	If the game goes to quadruple overtime between the Suns and Warriors or Knicks|`|NJtjJA8Baa	It would have to be a team like the Warriors who score a lot and cannot play defense, because the tempo would have to be lightning quick.

They really need to get Morrisson and Rey in there but Jeff is currently feuding with Matt so the WWE is planning something with just him and Matt.|`|CK45Qeulaa	It should be:<br>  <br>  Rey vs Jeff Hardy vs John Morrison vs Kane vs Edge vs Mr Kennedy vs RVD vs Christian.|`|YLkD4lgPaa	Even I didn't get why they put Mark Henry I even doubt he can climb that ladder. <br>  I agree with u REY should be in there.|`|bexN2lbvaa	yes<br>  yes they have ! come on it should be <br>  kane rey mysterio john morrison mark henry cm punk umaga mvp finlay|`|QbY18bjkaa	We all understand why kane is in it, but the rest i have no clue|`|thmLcDVKaa	i hope they put rey and evan in there if not is gonna suck!|`|9ttLI7S5aa	mark henry doesnt deserve it at all but at least, we know he wont win money in the bank|`|kx4M1nvvaa	There pushing one of the lightweights if they put two heavyweights in a money in the bank match so expect a win from one of them at WM.

And there's still Shelton and MVP nad Kane. Rey will probably get in somehow. CM Pumk would do pretty good. Mark Henry. BLEH. Finaly(not so good).

I wish they both get a second chance because I thought either one of them or MVP would win|`|plhLIIeAaa	Creative has their reasons. When you see the match, then you can ask this question again. Until then just watch and see. Someone might have to put up their spot in a match soon.|`|J9GWbyAvaa	i want to see that fatty Mark Henry fall off a ladder.<br>  HA! it will cause an earthquake.<br>  BTW, WWE lost its mind years ago.|`|ULSUqmeZaa	Both Jeff and Matt didn't win cause they will be facing each other at WM. <br>  Rey will get in there somehow. I don't get Mark Henry in that match either but Kane definitely deserves a push.

QYludYxzaa	well i have pitched forever now and i usually ice my arm the day that i pitch and the day after i pitch. What it does is contract your aching mussels and slows the blood flow.  When you pitch, or throw hard alot, you are killing blood vessels in your arm, which ice helps to heal.  Make sure that you put heat on your arm after you get done with the ice.  The heat increases your blood flow and gets some good blood in there.  When you are doing pitching, or throwing hard for that matter, there is bad blood in your shoulder that needs to be regulated.  Go for a run or a bike ride to get the blood flowing through that area the day after you pitch or throw hard.  I also take a short jog before games to get the blood flowing.  Healthy blood will really help to releave a sore arm, if you do the right things.|`|iPWKzzQtaa	It goes something like this. Any injury or minor inflammation could lead to minor swelling. Icing decreases the blood flow to the area so swelling maybe minimised or lessened. <br>  <br>  On the other hand, a warm up, is designed to get more blood flowing to the muscles.<br>  <br>  You definitely should follow the coaches advice.|`|6kA3TwZvaa	to relax your muscles|`|8wIsPXjJaa	Icing your arm helps in many ways. When you pitch, you are using the muscles, and they get filled with blood. If you keep that blood in there, that is what makes your arm sore. The ice makes the blood vescels in you arm constrict, forcing the blood out of your arm, keeping it from getting sore.|`|fxF2oraPaa	To get it nice and frosty, like a cold beer?
Y4mz8BShaa	That depends entirely on the maturity of the 11 year old.|`|vMZCED9jaa	Okay don't listen to the soccor moms.<br>  If your son is very mature about it, then sure why not.<br>   If you know he'll go around the neighborhood shooting other kids, cats, dogs, pets, people, who aren't wearing good eye/face protection, then of coarse, no.<br>  I honestly think 11 is a little young, but it's fine. I started when I was 13, and it was pretty fun.<br>  Remember, he needs to be mature about it, and not go play Rambo on against the stray cats in the neighborhood. He should always wear good eye protection.|`|39SZUJj3aa	yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee...<br>  they are not dangerous ther fine everyone who said no are idiots. i play it all the time. its harmless. im 11 and i cant use because my parents are retards. i play it your son can play. just tell him not to aim at eyes or face. wear protection. people that say no never played airsoft.|`|MWvcl9tKaa	I say yes but if hes not responsible with it then take it away.|`|c008639131d10cb89d12c2d03e6f96f6aa	no|`|9THRCVtOaa	yes but teach them gun safety first

268Rwp6zaa	a .01mm difference is not much at all. that is one hundredth of a millimeter. If your gun came with a non-precision barrel already, it would help, but it does, so it won't.<br>  <br>  You could get a longer barrel. Maybe get a new hop-up if yours isn't that great or is wore down.<br>  <br>  I don't know for sure, but I don't think reinforcements would be needed for your gun. G&G is a good company, and should take most upgrades, especially a fairly simple one like that in stride.

You need to tell more information about yourself as a player too... like your position, grade, experience and bench max.<br>  <br>  Don't worry... like the other guy said... it's all about heart and determination. You could be a 6'3" ripped linebacker with great ability, but you're not going to be great unless you have determination. Don't let size get to you, look at Darren Sproles. Watch Rudy.<br>  <br>  Good luck man.|`|yx5OBwXDaa	It all depends on what position you're trying out for. You could be a runningback. If you're fast and have good footwork. Oh and I also think it depends on the size of your school and where you're from. If you're from Texas probably not but if you're from Vermont your chances are pretty good.|`|mcJBDBSbaa	um no u do not sorry hate to brake it to u unless urun about a 4-8 40 u wont im 5-9 160 ilbs and i bench 145  or if u bench like 130 then no and i start running back and i run a 4.8 40 so dont count on it sorry bro eat a crap load|`|wBq0ERSJaa	Depends on position, these guys have no idea.

UJZZ4bnLaa	it means the  pick is conditional on how well the team does after they get the new player.   <br>  <br>  if the team misses the play-offs  they  might only lose a 6th round pick<br>  <br>  if they make the play-offs  the team might have to give up a 4th round pick<br>  <br>  if the team makes the stanley cup  they might have to give up a 2nd round pick.  it all depends on the terms the 2 teams agreed on when the trade was made<br>  <br>  .|`|a9f693c71e4b465afcc9a6b377b02694aa	There are certain conditions that need to be met before they can determine what the draft pick is.  New York and Toronto have not revealed the criteria for that pick.<br>  <br>  However<br>  <br>  The Islanders traded Bill Guerin to Pittsburgh for a conditional pick<br>  If Pittsburgh fails to make the playoffs, the conditional pick is a 5th rounder<br>  If Pittsburgh makes the playoffs, but lose in the first round, the conditional pick becomes a 4th rounder<br>  If Pittsburgh makes to the 2nd round (or farther), the conditional pick becomes a 3rd rounder.<br>  <br>  <br>  For some trades, when the conditional pick is in a later year, it can be dependent on how many games a player plays, how many points a player scores, etc.
LEQowzHCaa	I hope so<br>  <br>  They have two second rounders and I wouldn't be surprised if Burke does trade for a higher draft pick<br>  <br>  I really want to see Matt Duchene in the Blue and White and we arn't going to get him if we keep on winning<br>  <br>  Hopefully we lose, and Burke won't have to trade for a higher pick|`|XQoH9ZI5aa	I think Burke is tremendously overrated and is a bad choice for Toronto's GM position.<br>  <br>   Also, what is with all the excuses prior to even playing season's........this is going to take awhile and I think the fans understand that...........I have no respect for his caveat of failure prior to even failing. Already sounding like JP Ricciardi.<br>  <br>   Other teams have make quick turnarounds in salary cap climates, granted they don't have the nucleus the other teams did but they have the ability to spend the most on personell, buy-outs, maximizing cap space etc.<br>  <br>   Now if they have a decent season next year (play-offs) then he looks like some hero. They miss the play-offs and he gave the old patience precursor. Burke is a jerk.|`|a9f693c71e4b465afcc9a6b377b02694aa	No, he has no currency to do so.  <br>  <br>  Aside from Kaberle, he has nobody he can trade for a higher pick (keeping in mind that they are in line for a top 5 pick in a deep draft) and even Kaberle probably wouldn't entice the Islanders/Ottawa/Atlanta/Tampa gangs to give up their pick.|`|lYnkvRASaa	I doubt he will have the ability to do so, most teams will want to keep their pick.<br>  <br>  Of the lower ranked teams the Isles have a nasty habit of trading their picks away so it is a possibility although the Leafs burnt them last year with the Schenn pick that they got from the Islanders.<br>  <br>  He may be able to move up one spot.  Ie Islanders have third pick and he has fourth for example.  If Islanders don't want the guy he wants they could in theory flip picks, get something out of Toronto and still get their guy.  That is about it.  No one will give up the top 2 picks.  Tavares and Hedman are too far ahead of the rest of this draft class IMO.|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	No. Toronto will have a high draft pick and any one of the top 8-10 prospects would be an instant starter on any team.
1a17e73a07a2c5ebb65e5750cb7c97faaa	That would be Mille Lacs Lake in north central Minnesota.  They have 2 story ice shacks with complete kitchens, living rooms, indoor bathroom and the sleeping quarters upstairs.  As you mention they name "streets" and deliver mail to the shacks.  When I was younger we had a cabin not too far from there and we used to driver right by the lake on the way.  I have fished it before but not through the ice, I have plenty of good ice fishing where I live.  I am only about 1 1/2 hrs. due east from there, in NW Wisconsin.  Other lakes with big shanty towns would be Leech Lake, Red Lake and Lake of the Woods in Minnesota.  Devil's Lake in North Dakota is probably similar but I have not had the good fortune to make it out there yet.|`|uzNm9KtYaa	I believe you will find your answer given best from the Minnesota Department of Tourism.  I know of lakes in the North Central part of the state that elect a mayor, name streets, etc. on the ice during ice fishing season when the ice shanties can number in the hundreds.  You might also want to check with the Chambers of Commerce for such communities as Alexandria, Glenwood, and Brainerd/Nisswa in Minnesota for the same information.  It is really something to see.|`|qxBxy7e1aa	I live in WI. I think lake Michigan is a great place to get bass , pike , trout , and salmon :)

IIt2e7pJaa	They can IF..... They win tommorrow and Ok state and Texas lose. In which case Texas and Ok state will have a tiebreaker and Texas will have the upperhand ( Division record) and since they lost to K-state, the wildcats would be the 4 seed. Congrats I can't believe they may do it without Beastly/ B-easy<br>  hopes this helps|`|bSuUpZvSaa	i don't know|`|e9nZrkGaaa	so texas, texas a&m, and ok st. all need to loose and K state needs to win. this scenario is very likely since the three teams that need to loose are playing the top 3 teams in the conference, and k state is playing the worst team in the conference.  if this happened, texas ok st and k st would all be tied for 4th. i don't know how they deal with tie breakers, but they could decide by who beat who in the regular season, or their overall record i'm not sure.  if they based it off the regular season, i think ok st would win the tie breaker because they beat both k state and texas. but if they based it off of the overall record Kansas State would be 4th.

BB6HGbnPaa	Have you heard of an "ice bath"? You basically get in a tub will of cold water and with a bunch of ice that does up to your waist. Sit there for about 10-20 minutes. Than get out and you will feel refreshed. We had to do that the night before a race. It is uncomfortable at first but it works. Its like a giant ice pack from your waist down. Try it.|`|Jr9j5f6naa	take a hot bath, and/or use a heating pad on your legs, then stretch slowly. get someone to massage your legs, or possibly massage them yourself. relax, and get plenty of sleep. then maybe tommorrow put ice on them. don't kill yourself over this race because you could injure yourself to the point where you can't do the next one. So take it easier on this one if it isn't district or anything like that. And in the future, DON'T do a hard workout before a meet! Sorry about that though :/|`|JK7xWBnRaa	Strectch alot and just try to soak tonight and get rid of some of the soreness, and make sure you get a good nigths rest. You should be alright|`|p0jWdSsAaa	Like the others said take a hot bath or if you have access to a jacuzzi sit in there for a while. Then for dinner have something with a lot of carbs. Something like lasagna or spaghetti.
PJzd8iJaaa	after a while ull love that wind, its good speedwork, if u can run sa an 18:00 5k in wind u can do atleast 17:30 or better with no wind.|`|Jr9j5f6naa	try and keep your head down. also remember in a race the wind will be affecting everyone equally. and maybe the wind is making you a better runner by using more energy? but anyway, just remember to use correct running form, not much else you can do.|`|BB6HGbnPaa	You should love the wind. Its like having a big resistance band around your waist and your trying to stretch it. Its a good workout because it works your legs and your legs burning means that it is getting a good workout. But if you have to cut the wind, simple put your head down to cut some of the wind.|`|e5e7b6abc96b5c6e410bc10bc14ce363aa	Don't put your head down, keep it up this will help keep your form more precise and equal. if u run the same way u do with the wind against it u will be faster, just train your mental strength. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  In a race never take 1st place spot on a windy day instead take 2nd place  so the person infront of you is eating most of the wind while ur just running (using less energy) and then last 100 kill them!!!!!!!
8MUj24s6aa	A friend of mine just bought a Sig 226 factory certified for 550. It is 99.9% perfect....Does not look used at all. It was a dept issued duty weapon.|`|HoYpU86Gaa	Yes, these refurbs are good guns. Last show I went to about a month ago they were about $550. So, thats a good number. <br>  <br>  I assure you.....there is nothing wrong with the Glock, but it is not in the same galaxy as the Sig. <br>  <br>  The 40 cal looks a little better than the 9mm on paper (ballistics charts), but it is just barely measurably more potent than the 9mm. In actual bullet through meat tests, the 40 and 45 scored only 3% higher than the 9mm (91% vs 94%). Thats not enough to brag about. <br>  <br>  I would go for the Sig.

X1yZOMYHaa	Not necessarily. If Kiprusoff stays healthy they won't need a back up goalie. If they need a backup to play anymore than a game here or there in the playoffs then they're finished anyway. It doesn't matter which team. Your #1 needs to be there throughout the playoffs. That's partly why it's so hard to win the cup.<br>  <br>  Who started in the finals last year? Osgood and Fleury, both teams number 1's.<br>  <br>  Any teams playoff hopes are based on their hot goalie being there throughout the playoffs. If Kiprusoff goes down it's probably over no matter who the Flames have to replace him.|`|a9f693c71e4b465afcc9a6b377b02694aa	McIlhenny will only see action in the playoffs if Kiprusoff gets injured....so no worries.  <br>  <br>  Very few teams have the luxury of two good goaltenders to lead them to Stanley Cup glory....so Calgary is not alone in that.|`|hMo9z0TSaa	Probably not....If they do get in the playoffs.

mFLIZ2nQaa	ive been a cheerleader for 4 years going on my 5th. i have tryouts tomorrow for a co-ed team. i remember when i first tried out. my feshman year was the first time i had ever cheered. i had taken a little bit of gymnastics but not enough where i could do back-hand springs or tucks. i made JV my first year then after that Varsity the next 3 years. im not gonna lie, your gonna be nervous but dont show it. SMILE!!! and be CONFIDENT!!! i still to this day cant do a backhand spring but thats ok. i made Varsity with a roundoff. keep stretching, work on your jumps, (if you need help to learn how to do some jumps there are websites out there that teach you), at tryouts if you cant see the person teaching you the routine then move to the front. who cares if you look like a fool, you'll learn it better. if you have questions about a part in the routine or cheer, ask. dont be afraid to ask. im sure they will help you get a move right. <br>  <br>  Good Luck and remember to SMILE and be CONFIDENT!!!|`|55TRTY9Taa	well i am a cheerleader but i am not in high school yet but i can tell you a cheer it goes i said i feel so good i like to tell you why so smile a while and raise your spirts high!need any more just ask i am open:)

Jr9j5f6naa	try doing repition work outs. that means running shorter distances faster, like do a 400, 200, 100, 200, and 400, as fast as you can. it gets you in better shape to run distance. and of course just practice!!! try working out 4-5 days a week. one week focus on shorter distances, (3 out of 5 days) and the other days do 1.5 miles, and vice versa. You could also try running 2 miles every so often so that the 1.5 seems easier, and isn't as good as you can do.
xQFWjFyZaa	I think they are a year or two away due to experience. Most of the Rays players had a few seasons under their belt last year. Jay Bruce, Chris Dickerson, Joey Votto, Homer Bailey, Edinson Volquez, Edwin Encarnacion and Johnny Cueto need to take another step forward and make more progress.<br>  <br>  I will consider them contenders next season, assuming Volquez's arm doesn't fall off in Dusty Baker's hands.|`|sHzPnGXHaa	yes your the only one|`|kGXU1Dotaa	No your not i believe they will be the surprise team this yr.|`|yk4S7uuraa	I'm not sold on Dusty Baker, I didn't like him as a player, and I dislike him more as a manager.

The Reds have completely changed their style of play (from relying on hr to speed and playing "little ball"). They have new, young talent all-round, notably in the outfield. They finally have a catcher. Their starting pitching, if Homer can reach meritocracy and Harang can turn his record around, is good and their infield is superb, notably Votto, golden-glove winning Phillips, and the return of Gonzalez. Getting rid of mediocre, lazy Reds players and cleaning the clubhouse, was defiantly good for their chances. In my opinion, their only concern is having a big power hitter in their lineup to drive in runs. Besides that, I am optimistic about them winning the weak NL Central.|`|DPlJiWyWaa	I've feel the same way.  Each year I am astounded that they finish with such a poor record.  They have a decent bullpen, pitching, hitting and outfielders.  Not to mention management.  Not sure if they can be like the Rays last season, but they have the potential now to get into the playoffs.  They just need to make it happen.|`|x8sFzzUIaa	I agree.

YUqNIKCeaa	Yes, you have an option or two.<br>  <br>  The first option is to use reverse chudan stance.  It is slightly unorthodox, but is not outside the rules.  The stance is where your right foot is at the back and the left is flat and forward.  The only problem I can forsee with this is that if you need to fumikomi with your left... it too would hurt.  This means though that you would probably end up using Jodan stance eventually as it is predominantly the one used with this reversed footwork.<br>  <br>  Alternatively, you may consider using a Tabi, it is like a leather slip that your foot gets into.  Normally it is worn by people who can't handle calluses on their foot etc.<br>  <br>  I would suggest that you might consider also talking to Sensei to see what he suggests.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  In response to the other response, to make less ripping and your calluses more comfortable, you should moisturise your feet regularly.  Once you form calluses, if you do not keep your feet supple, the calluses harden up, and then split, causing open wounds which take a while to heal, and will also be prone to infection.<br>  <br>  If you moisturise (I use cheap sorbolene) then it will soften up and be much less prone to cracking and tearing.  Foot pain is something you get used to and once you have enough thick skin, it becomes less.<br>  <br>  What you will need to be careful about though is stress fractures in the ball of your foot too, because one of our members recently over-trained and gave himself stress fractures which took him out of training for five weeks.|`|6sTsDvKmaa	I'm having the same problem!  Kind of jumped into kendo and have now developed what I think is plantar fasciitis, not to mention like 3 layers of blistered skin that I keep ripping open.  I also have flat feet so it's really hard to be walking around barefoot, much less pounding the ground.  <br>  <br>  Best way I've learned to deal with it is a good stretch before and AFTER practice.  Ice a lot, and time will help you adapt.  There's also the half tabi that someone mentioned.  Tape will also help support your foot and add some extra cushion.  <br>  <br>  I'm beginning to think that foot pain is an inescapable aspect of kendo.  But it's still worth it to me, so I'll probably just practice through the hurt until it goes away.

ehMPOlefaa	I'd alternate between the two games as well.  With certain conditions being involved.  Like the WBC game has to have two competitive teams and it has to matter, like an advancing contest.  Not just a pool game<br>  Besides that I'd predominantly watch the beginning innings of my hometown club's game to see the regulars and how they are rounding into shape.|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	Spring training games at least I can see the mets bench and minor leaguers.

RbCsBbhLaa	No matter what only exercise alone won't help anyone. Loosing weight is a matter of input vs. output. The whole reason that people need food is for energy and for our bodies to run. If you eat an apple instead of a cookie your body is getting the vitamins in the apple instead of the precessed sugar from the cookie so you body can use more of what's in the apple.  You need to put-out more than you take it. So that means eating right and exercising. If you eat a health diet and run on a treadmill for exercise than yes it could help. <br>  good luck!!|`|167529fb60fd91f624600021b83b22c7aa	We had a nice tread mill, that became a great clothes hanger!<br>  I waved at it, as I passed, so it wouldn't feel neglected!<br>  Sold it, and got a winter pass at the local "indoor pool", burn more cal's, and have more fun!<br>  and the views are sometimes great!|`|0VHzP9jzaa	more of running in general but ya.  but its a mix of things like the last person said. for exercise if your working at a high amount of bpm (beats per minute), it is stregthening your heart while when its at a lower bpm its burning fat. follow the link in sources. then do the little subtraction thing about halfway down the page.

BB6HGbnPaa	Treadmills dont really help you unless you just want to lose some weight. Treadmill is just you running in one spot and that doesnt help. Outdoor track is great unless it on a cold day. You can enjoy the sun shine and all that.

5xLqJoyPaa	I too cannot believe someone like Brett Stewart could be involved with something so disgraceful. Sure I don't know him personally but my overall opinion is one of him being professional, a practical joker and generous. Given his diabetic history it's also hard to believe he was on an all day bender. <br>  That aside - I too found it strange the parents of the girl heard her cries for help and not the neighbour whom help they sought. ( I can only assume the neighbour in question was closer than their own apartment...otherwise why waste time and not go to your own and call - witness perhaps?) <br>  Also the mother of the girl found time to answer questions from the media to explain why her 17 yr old was outside smoking and explain that they had only been there 3 wks and would now be leaving the premises.<br>  This was before taking her to Dee Why police for a statement. <br>  Even if the press were yelling questions at you - wouldn't a parents concern be first and foremost for getting help for their daughter..<br>  Something doesn't feel right here. Gut and heart feelings only.<br>  I have a funny feeling Current Affair or Today Tonight will air an interview (faces obscured) to explain the family's side of the story - for a respectable fee of course.<br>  If I am wrong I will glady admit it and support prosecution. But if I am right I hope that they are made to be fully accountable.<br>  Just a quick question - I haven't seen anywhere where it was suggested a case of mistaken identity - any links?|`|x5U1Kx7faa	What I can't get over is how this crap rears it's ugly head 2 or 3 weeks before every NRL season, this is about the 6th year in a row that i can remember that our game has been tainted with this kinda stuff prior to a ball being kicked.......  No i don't believe Brett Stewart would do something like this, but if he did, then he'll be found guilty and punished accordingly and we can all get on with what we love about Rugby League....hopefully it's another storm in teacup....(no pun intended)..!!|`|uHaB5dehaa	I BELIEVE THAT IF HE DID IT HE SHOULD BE LOCKED UP AND I BELIEVE IF SHES LYING SHE SHOULD BE LOCKED UP SIMPLE . but ill let the courts or investigations decide,Brett looks and sounds like a good bloke but when alcohol is added it could be easly a different story, lets get to the root of this ZERO TOLERANCE is your answer NRL wake up and get real .|`|AA11619982	I believe that he should come over to the Bulldogs and play in a team with Todd Carney, Jonathon Thurston, Andrew Johns, willie Mason, Dunny Door Bill Williams, Greg Bird, Darren Lockyer, Darius Boyd, Karmichael Hunt and Hopoate you would have to keep them all locked up as caged animals after games but they would absolutely smash the opposition.|`|JfrQVNOmaa	No I dont believe it,I think she was looking for her name in lights,Maybe something happened and Brett said no,and she retaliated with this aligation.|`|4eQqTiYwaa	we will just have to wait and see if he is|`|JAg8cIOsaa	Where there is smoke......!  We will now see if the clubs and the NRL are fair dinkum when it comes to players behaving badly (to put it politely) and suspending them at the very least.  Or will it be one law for the lower grade players and another one (read slap on wrist) for the top players.  This happens every year and nothing seems to deter these so called role models. I dont really care who he plays for. He put himself in this position and now he finds himself having to prove himself innocent.  It is time these idiots woke up to themselves and realised that their behaviour is always being scrutinized.|`|ONuF4CjCaa	i say that he definately didn't do it<br>  <br>  it annoys me how the media can claim that a nrl player has done something wrong then when they find out that it wasn't the nrl player, they go about it as if they didn't do anything wrong.<br>  its making the players look bad when they are doing nothing wrong, in some cases. as for todd carney, he actually did do stupid things and got caught. but just a couple of weeks ago wes naiqama was accused of something, in the sexual assault area i think, and the media released articles on it which made his name look bad, they then found out that it wasn't him but made no apologies to wes..<br>  <br>  stupid media should make sure they are 100% correct first before releasing information which is later found out to be wrong.|`|96bVfIlYaa	If it is true, then the NRL have a huge problem on their hands and need to address the whole pitiful scene for once and for all - craig bird, the carney bloke from Canberra, the 3 guys from the broncos.  What kind of morons are they recruiting?<br>  <br>  I don't understand it at all.   These men reportedly have girls hanging off them, offering themselves up like delicacies on a platter.  And most of them seem to have stunning girlfriends too.   With all that available and willing 'meat' available, why on earth would you need to commit rape?|`|9zxrXqhXaa	I think its bull cause all u hear about these days are sports stars allegedly attacking girls. the girls jus want attention and money from these people  and its not fair to them especially brett stewart he has worked so hard for manly why would he do somethin stupid that would ruin his career. Most people say that NRL players dont have a brain but brett bein stupid and reckless dont think so... This is goin to hurt the manly club alot because of this girl and they only jus won a premiership... coincidence or not??|`|OyAD7LXKaa	I am completely in love with Manly, they are my everything, literally, and i'm not just saying this because I am a massive supporter.<br>  I seriously doubt that Snake would do such a thing, that girl is probably just hungry for money, and is trying to make something out of nothing just to get a few dollars out of the media. Why is it all these allegations are made against league players, yet are never found guilty? Yeah, exactly my point, the 'victims' are just money hungry. <br>  Manly FOREVER.|`|yYenuIVwaa	No he didn't do anything to this girl! The allegation is totally false.Previously being voted NRL sexiest man<br>  (not that Im into that kind of competetition)<br>  He is dating someone at the moment who Im sure he is committed too and is very attractive! He just won a premiership and has all kinds of accolades to his name! He has the NRL world at his feet. He obviously does not need to resort to a low act such as the accusation given to him. I don't believe he did or would resort to doing anything like that. No matter what circumstance or amount of alcohol he may have consumed.<br>  It is just a stupid false accusation buy an attention seeking girl.<br>  On the other hand if this allegation is to be correct than I take back everything written here and apologize to the girl and will class Brett as scum. However I do believe that Stewart is a decent person and understands the role he plays as an example and ambassador of the sport to countless people and is innocent! Nuff said, Leave him be now! Its false!|`|fsLMFIpgaa	No I don't & i'm fed up with these dumb females who go to private places with men then cry rape. What the hell do they think they are doing there? I have not heard any bad publicity concerning Stewart before this & I don't believe this.|`|CZvrFqZ1aa	No.<br>  I know I'm a huge Manly fan and it will prolly seem like bias coming from every angle here, but I don't think he would do something like this.<br>  She maybe could have asked him to come into her room or something, and he said no ( he has a gf remember). So, she cries for sexual assault.<br>  Seems like a bit of a step up but I can't see him doing something like this, really. Who knows, he could have just touched her arm and she cries.<br>  I don't know the full story yet, but I'm pretty positive this will drag on for ten years, no matter the outcome.<br>  I still don't think he would be the type to do something like this. <br>  I believe it's a bunch of BS atm.<br>  Below: No I don't know Brett Stewart. But do you? <br>  Nah, thought so.<br>  To me this seems a typical case of 'He said no, but I'll cry anyway'<br>  Oh yes, and that makes a sh.tload of sense, the NRL won't cull Stewart because Manly ''want to win at all costs'', that is the most pathetic thing I've heard before.<br>  The NRL will get rid of him If things are shown and proven to him being guilty. Just wait, I can bet my house on it this is an honest bloke being falsely accused.|`|Uyz6iZwKaa	I don't like manly at all.<br>  <br>  However, in the past the media have done the same story on other clubs blah blah blah and never has anyone been charged...not because they are nrl players but because nothing happened and it was a load of crap to get attention and money. <br>  <br>  I think it is the same case here.<br>  <br>  If the media are wrong (and they are) - dont hold your breath for an apology!|`|28667a2fab4e406f52bfe94a34c859cbaa	Do the media just pick a player before the season and decided to ruin his reputation with this crap|`|4NBAfnqbaa	no. i believe his innocent<br>  not only does he not seem like the type of person to do such thing<br>  but isnt it interesting that the 17yr olds father could hear her screaming from 2 doors away, yet a neighbour in the building didnt hear a thing<br>  He also has a girlfriend and apparently they are inseparable, why would he want to ruin that with some desperate 17 year old.<br>  His at the point of his career where he is one of the biggest stars in the NRL, he isnt stupid enough to throw that all away like this.<br>  I just want to say good luck to brett stewart and i hope the truth comes out soon so this can all be over with and brett stewart and the manly boys can have a good season<br>  back to back premiers boys!|`|HtaO5Uu6aa	Do you no Brett Stewart? What makes you so sure he did not do it? Have you known him long enough to make a call like that?<br>  Or are you just going by what you see on the footy feild and in the tv presentations he gives.<br>  <br>  I can Gaurantee you if a Priest in the Mighty Church can assault little boys than There is deffinately a chance he could have done this.<br>  Im not saying he did but becoz the girl apparently lives near Stewart her mistaking his identity would be pretty slim, i deffinately no who im talking to. This is why he was not allowed to return home as the girl stayed a few houses down.<br>  <br>  What i cant get over is Reni maitua losses his contract for missing training.<br>  Carney losses his for drinking.<br>  <br>  Watmough gets absolutely nothing for assaulting a Manly sponser!!!<br>   If the Nrl has to pull their add campaign becoz of this Manly will be under huge pressure to drop Stewart.<br>  Will they do it No becoz Manly want to win at all cost. <br>  If Stewart is Guilty he shud be Dropped<br>  Watmough should have been stood down aswell what sort of club puts up with Players Assaulting sponsers its a bad look on the whole Nrl and the only reason he was not dropped is becoz he is 2 valuable a player if it was a reserve he wud be gone.<br>  <br>  Also a Sexual assualt did take place as the girl was treated in hospital, i doubt this wud be necessary from a touch on the arm.<br>  <br>  To the person a few posts down, Brett stewart was actually arrested and had a order placed against him which meant he could not return home as the girl lived close to him, which means hthis is not sum stab in the dark. Stewart was drinking for 8 nine hours he was in the same complex he was still their when police arrived he was arrested and not allowed to return these things dont happen for no reason. The girl was treated at hospital so it was not made up.<br>  So in this case the Media is actually correct in what they have published.
Pq5Ds8F2aa	You sure did, and surprisingly it was not from me.|`|n708rCp0aa	yes, assuming from the lyrics.
oSakZ1asaa	It has been said over the years, Daisy 880's have killed more people than any other pellet gun. That's probably because it has been produced in larger numbers than anything other than the Crosman 760. which has been on the market since the 1960's. The Daisy since about 1970. Basically the same since original, but more plastic.<br>  <a href="http://www.drspock.com/article/0,1510,6242,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.drspock.com/article/0,1510,62...</a>|`|xOReEw6Waa	Yes, air rifles have enough energy to put a pellet through the chest at close range and can puncture a lung or damage the heart causing death. This can  happen quickly as like a any other wound or take longer if there where not a lot of bleeding and the area became infected. There are times when even a possible shot to the cranium will cause death. I do know of a few cases that are reported yearly in the US and elsewhere so you need to treat air rifles with the exact same rrespect as any other firearm.|`|5xIroQjMaa	Yep. Someone killed me last week with one.

Like said before, some would probably kill a buffalo if the cards were stacked right. <br>  <br>  It doesn't take a .357 or .45 to kill someone. I certainly wouldn't use it for home defense, but I treat them like any other high-powered gun.<br>  <br>  Lock and load.

(east coast US, around 3 years ago) then it was found he had a heart attack, but the media still said he died from paintballs.|`|1jmXT4Vvaa	They have even shot and killed a bison with air rifles.

It is normally the case that the victim is a little kid, or the person gets hit in just the right...er wrong spot in the chest, temple, or eye.<br>  <br>  There was even an instance where a bb broke the skin and entered a blood vessel and traveled into the blood vessel to the heart and then blocked part of the heart, causing a heart attack.|`|a268bbf5f7d7d4bbb6f43d11ccd29916aa	Yes.  I was there, as I have posted before. 15 year-old boy shot in chest.  .177 pellet from Benjamin pump went right through him.  Couldn't save him.  Didn't even know there was an exit wound until the ambulance crew picked him up.  Everyone just assumed the pellet was still in him.  Tough lesson for all.  If the boy holding the gun had been taught the rules and followed them, this wouldn't be written.<br>  <br>  All guns are always loaded.<br>  Never let the muzzle cover anything you aren't ready to destroy.<br>  Keep your finger out of the trigger guard until you are ready to shoot.<br>  Be sure of your target--and beyond.<br>  Never put anything into a gun other than exactly what it is made for.|`|CuusFccNaa	Yes, they can kill.

The Canadian Ski Association is the amateur sponsoring group for competitive racing in Canada.  Molsons did  co-sponsor a racing circuit for recreational skiers. If you are thinking about national class racing or further out an international class the training and racing takes many years to reach that level.  A typical olympic class racer will need about $1 million dollars US to reach the Olympics.  This would include at least 10 years of junior racing and junior national team racing if they are that good.  If you are serious about racing start with a good team and coach and hope you are good enough to progress to the regional team level.

HdS25o2saa	Pretend the bowler is naked, you wouldn't be scared of a naked guy would you?|`|M8XmhqIhaa	I had the same problem. Its a natural human reaction and cricket can allows to switch this reaction off. Be confident and when the ball is coming at you, stand your ground and play straight. Trust me, you're more likely to get hurt when you're backing away because you let your eyes off the ball.<br>  <br>  Another important thing is to watch the ball. Also, you need to practise so get your dad or a sibling to give you throw-downs aiming at your body. Do it slowly at first but when you get more and more confident, tell them to speed it up.<br>  <br>  Edit: I had a similar problem and my coach put a cricket bat behind my feet during my batting stance like a barrier. Everytime I went to back away, my feet would hit the bat. This allowed me to stop backing away. My average after that went up heaps.|`|AA11088802	be confident|`|lVKwnFvjaa	Try and blank your mind to any thought other than "watch the ball, watch the ball....." and your subconscious will engage your technique, you'll start to pick the length of the delivery as soon as the ball leaves the bowlers hand. Then you'll find you'll have much more time to play, leave or duck the ball.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|Qq2MKeXUaa	Just watch the ball.  Practice in the nets with a fast bowler in your own team as well.|`|Zh9y58yCaa	Just close your eyes before facing the deliveries!! lol|`|561a42dcf730fd97fc3a2ebd788ea961aa	try to think as chris gayle or jayasuriya,.. try  go dominate fast bowlers...from the word go>>|`|pbHFxUt2aa	this might be completely different to all the answers given before me but stand well outside your crease. yeah you might get the ball a micro second early but you will negate the swing that will really make facing fast bowlers easier.. keep your head straight all the time and play with a straight bat. no problem if you give him a maiden you can make it up off a slower bowler later.. main thing is that you are not out.. <br>  <br>  also it might help if you go for a wild swing and manage to get a good shot out of it.. it really puts bowlers off when they get hit for good shots.. <br>  <br>  BOL!! (best of luck)|`|aN4SUKkRaa	Watch the ball! Watch the ball!<br>  <br>  Don't flinch, you have a bat in your hands. <br>  <br>  This may sound insane to you, but let yourself take a few hits! If you're wearing the right protection equipment you'll hardly feel the impact! Get used to it!!<br>  <br>  If the fast bowler sees you backing away, his eyes light up, he can see that fear! Get behind the ball and smack the bowler through the covers, the ball can't hurt you if it's bouncing off the pickets!!<br>  <br>  When (not if!) you DO get struck by the ball, don't rub the area. Stare the bowler down! He can't take your wicket if he's hit you on the body!|`|0ac3af7f05344feefbb618ff09a3b896aa	Concentrate and always have the eye on the ball.<br>  Hit only the balls you are able to hit or you will miss it or will be edged and caught behind. Always be prepared to face a yorker or block hole.<br>  Always try to hit pull shots to length deliveries. Some fast bowlers get swing so beware.If the ball overpiched  try to do the straight drive because it is a safe shot. It is good to flick the balls which come to you(In swing). Never be sacred ,play with full confidence.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped you!!!<br>  These are the things you should do against fast bowlers.|`|dtLrEBjKaa	You are Australian and talking like child. Assume yourself as Sachin or Adam Gilchrist. Wear all protections. Have confidence. Watch the ball to the end and look at the hand of the bowler very carefully. you'll have Idea about the delivery. Sachin always does this and he watch the ball till it is 30 cm far from him. then he plays strokes. I was also afraid of fast deliveries but I wore protection and firstly i Played defensive stroke to stop the ball speed No push or pull just normal stop. i did for 7 days and after that I started to shot them and now I am easy with fast bowlers and thrash them. This was also the case of Sachin Tendulkar.|`|i57vLejdaa	well. i had a similar problem.. and the only thing i can say is .. just play and practice it out over and over again.. get used to the pain. it just stings.. goes away quickly. try focusing on the ball out of the bowlers hand.. only think about the ball|`|1nCHPs0uaa	always keep your eyes on the ball and don't be scared of it.|`|FUQtpQByaa	bring it on babe just be brave

xIfvXy4waa	Honestly, Vick. My team, the Steelers, has Santonio (MVP), and Hines (11 year veteran and my favorite player) we don't need TO. Big Ben is a good QB, but he isn't the best, even though he thinks he is. TO can mess up a team chemistry which is the last thing we need. We are Superbowl champs, we don't need to go out and have a big signing, Vick would help our team more.|`|7RziqsDcaa	Both.<br>  <br>  I would be gald to sign both those beasts.

Philadelphia was supposed to be the fresh start, complete with a big-armed quarterback and a great supporting cast. But it only took one year for Owens to start a raging forest fire in the Eagles locker room, undermining quarterback Donovan McNabb, disrespecting then-offensive coordinator Brad Childress and even coming to blows with former teammate Hugh Douglas."<br>  <br>  "Media reports out of Dallas over the course of last season read like an unchanging manual of self-destruction, complete with Owens allegedly showing an uncanny ability for chirping and bitching and stirring up other teammates.<br>  <br>  A former Cowboys coach told Yahoo! Sports last month that he saw Owens do it with fellow wideouts Miles Austin and Patrick Crayton. Other media reports indicated Owens did the same with newly acquired wideout Roy Williams, too, all the while creating a familiar divide between his recruits and some of the familiar targets: the quarterback, the head coach, the wide receivers coach, the offensive coordinator and others. Like his situations in San Francisco and Philadelphia, it wasn’t just Owens having his own problems. It was T.O. convincing other players they should have a problem, too."<br>  <br>  I think that in the near future, even more players will come out with the truth about him, now that they don't have to worry about him in the locker anymore.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news;_ylt=Ao...">http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news;_ylt=Ao...</a>|`|U3qGMT6eaa	Michael Vick probably, but i think people are making T.O. out to seem worse then he actually is. From what i've seen, his teammates have said he works hard, wants to win, and doesn't bring them down. Nothing wrong with that to me. He can still be a bit of a brat, but not as bad as everyone acts. I would take Vick though because T.O. has too many drops, even though he's a great receiver.|`|0tp5qpzkaa	Neither <br>  <br>  But if I had to choose one for their respected positions I'd take T.O. because he can play WR.

He'd probably stay in control for a season or two and who knows, we might win that elusive championship. <br>  <br>  I would not consider signing Vick for any reason.

XNdDrXAzaa	it's a combination of engines and drivers and technicians, plus the spectrum of the whole organization. You'll never get anywhere by "playing by the book". That's not what racing's about. If you can't  "think (play) outside of the box" you'll never win. You could blame it on NASCAR if you want. They're the ones who make all the restrictions to performance modifications, but I wouldn't really be too critical of RPM, since they were forced to make so many changes within their organization. It's also safer to make certain changes slower. The decisions they make are only for their stability in the future as a race team. The beauty of this sport is...  that if you stick around long enough, you'll eventually win.|`|E5mFWOqqaa	The new engine is still being tested. You see what's happened with all the engines that have already been developed so far this season (we're up to what, a dozen or two failures?). <br>  <br>  By running an engine they know is solid, RPM gives their teams a better chance of not having their drivers locked out of the Chase due to an untested engine package blowing up and the driver finishing 43rd. <br>  <br>  In my opinion, the move makes perfect sense. Dodge is already well behind the other three makes, and their new engine was fully implemented by some of the Dodge teams (there's what, Penske left?) while others aren't quite so sure of the engine and want to finalize testing on it before they put their extremely underfunded team on the brink of failure because a couple blown engines and bad finishes pushed sponsors away.|`|595902780e2c09920890743b229c9c08aa	You have a excellent gripe about that. In the Kansas last year was when Penske started using the new engine. They had a rough go of it but they kept at it and have now worked most of the kinks out and are performing really well for all of Penske's Nascar Cup drivers. Yes even Sam Hornish jr. RPM is way behind the 8 ball unless they have been testing the new engine without anyone knowing. Here is a article I found that explains some of the stuff about the new engine.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/sports/motorsports/story/1059543.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kansascity.com/sports/motorsp...</a>|`|g1RtC9n5aa	Dodge doesn't have any better engines. they would have to change their make, which costs a lot of $.|`|iO12Vjnvaa	Couldn't agree with you more Tom. It's rediculous. It's that kind of passive decision making that got Petty Enterprises in trouble in the first place. C'mon RPM don't GIVE AWAY POINTS!

VDFkJvyGaa	Well Obviously you don't know what a Real Rockets fan is. Only a Rockets fan would know what WE think. Mcgrady was good without and with the injury. When he played 20-30 minutes he would give you 20+ points. The Rockets are doing good without him and better ONLY when he is dragging and not scoring. Basically, not having his night. So it is better if he did get the surgery  and come back next year. :)|`|014d662e9ccdcc2dfcbd68b27f469d57aa	Dude shut up. You must be a Phoenix fan that is badly hurt by your loss.

Unless if Nab by gets hurt in the playoffs and pulls off a Cam Ward and wins a cup for SJ.|`|Hki3AoL5aa	i'd probably remember that goal just like Thomas's giving up the goal in overtime (even though that was a slap shot but still 80 ft come on)|`|UoUaO52taa	The streak. That's over 5 GAMES. Ridicoulous|`|ViB84hYzaa	Fluke goal yes, BAD goal definitely, 5-hole nonetheless! Should have stayed up square and been ready to react. One of the reasons I despise the butterfly style. I always knew you need a goalie with excellent reflexes for shots to the posts and along the ice, (where the stick and kick saves are necessary) but I'm sure a big guy that stands up covering more net will not give up as many 5-hole goals as we see, which sometimes astound me. Dallas announcers were mentioning the ice being bad and seeing all kinds of bad hops. I only caught the last 8 mins of the 3rd roughly and OT. I also failed to hear if the announcers confirmed with any of the players whether the ice was bad as well. <br>   <br>  I think the goal will follow BB for the rest of the season but that will cease sooner than later. I think this has to weigh on the mind of the Sharks (new found goaltender issues) who are struggling just a bit right now. Not necessarily the right time to struggle, although the sooner the better and they still do have plenty of time to end this mini-slump and right the ship for the playoffs, they'll need to. The shut out streak will always be mentioned more so when talked about than this goal. How important is a healthy Nabakov. Hopefully Nabakov comes back healthy for the sake of the Sharks otherwise it could be another  early SJ playoff exit.|`|61ebb98dbcf0e5b37666270ad52df781aa	the bouncing goal from a backhanded dump by zidlicky from center ice. imagine zidlicky's enjoyment watching his goal go in from the bench.<br>  <br>  btw joe, as a mn wild fan, i do have to say the it did look like the ice was causing a lot of trouble during the third period. it looked like both teams were having trouble skating and keeping the puck under control. plus, the announcers were from mn, so i don't think they were trying to make any excuses for boucher.|`|KyCJOR2paa	Plenty of good goalies have give goals like that up.  Chris Mason allowed a goal from center ice in the playoffs last year.  Nicklas Lidstrom shot a floater than one hopped over his shoulder.  Tim Thomas gave up a long one this year.  Last year, don't remember who it was, but he gave one up to the Islanders from behind the opponents goal line.  Osgood has given up plenty.|`|UzhfaJH2aa	Well at least that wasn't the goal to end the shutout string. That would have been been tough for him to swallow.<br>  A lot of goalies have given up godawful goals, not many with five game shutout streaks. The streak should be remembered far longer than the flukey goal.|`|KXh6YPByaa	His shut out streak will be what he is remembered for.  Every goalie has let in a soft goal like that in their career.  Sure it sucks, but a yr from now you will be hardpressed to find someone who can describe it to you in detail.  One mistake.  it happens. it will be forgotten fast.|`|qcDHyhdtaa	Nice goal! lol <br>  <br>  Both will be in the minds of fans of how long the streak was and how a flukey goal ended it.|`|AA12172407	The streak...I still think of him any time a goalie strings together even a couple games of shutouts|`|k9YaLawCaa	OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, that's some bloop.<br>  I'd say his 332 minutes and 1 second shutout streak will live longer.|`|4lyAGOkbaa	shut out streak .. no doubt
6rS42uSdaa	Your hundred time is much better.  That is a huge jump from a hundred to a 1650, if you didn't feel like you were going to through up you weren't swimming hard enough.  Keep on working at it, but that time isn't horrible.  The thing about the 1650 is their are little things that you change and it takes off minutes.  For example do 2 dolphin kicks off of every wall, make sure you are swimming down the middle of the pool, and dont spend to much time on each wall|`|97izv0Dbaa	what i do for distance is get slightly faster every 50.

wxXguyK3aa	They could do very well.  But the Giants, Cowboys, and Eagles are all playoff contenders as well, it will be very hard for them to win their division.|`|lrJN4M49aa	First off the people saying no, are insane or don't know football.<br>  Barring any major injury. Yes they should make the playoffs<br>  -These two players make an already good defense (finished in the top 5 last year) into a really, really , really good defense and we all know defense wins championships go ahead ask the Steelers.<br>  Zorn who is in second year as head coach should feel more comfortable and this should eliminate some of the rookie mistakes from last year that cost us a game or two. As well as Jason Campbell being in his second year in this offense. Throw in a pro bowl tight end (Cooley) and running back (Portis) there is no reason why we shouldn't make the playoffs. We did finish 8-8 last year and we just made some significant upgrades. Plus Vinny said we have enough money to sign one more free agent most experts are speculating offensive linemen Derrick Dockery who left Washington for the big payday in Buffalo. With Dockery returning and hopefully signing one of three top offensive linemen in the draft and reasonable play from third round draft pick Chad Rhinehart are so called ageing O line will have a infusion of youth, and lets not forget third year player tackle Stephon Heyer. Lets face it  facts we are ripe for another playoff birth, because those drama queen Cowgirls will choke, we beat Philly twice last year, I still see the Giants winning the division, but a departure by Plaxico could also change that. Free agency has just started and we have signed two of the most talented defensive guys at there position.|`|cDKkKEgvaa	Well their defense will be BEAST, but the offense and Jason Campbell really need to step it up this year and produce some good numbers.....I mean he has Santana Moss and Randle El they might be playoff contenders.  But the thing they have to survive is the tough NFC East.|`|B8sJEBxTaa	Even with a good defense, they don't have a good offense. I'd say they are capable of making the playoffs, but they won't be Super Bowl contenders. Also, who knows if Haynesworth will get injured again. He's quite prone to injuries.|`|2VVU7gNfaa	Albert Haynesworth can be a difference maker on defense for the Skins (or any team).  DeAngelo Hall got beaten like a rented mule in Oakland - I don't know if he'll have much positive impact on the defense judging by his terrible play last season.<br>  <br>  I think Haynesworth makes any team with decent talent around him a playoff contender, Skins included.|`|Y5S2dDkYaa	Man, I freakin hope so...<br>  <br>  I dont even count that game against Tampa Bay 2 years ago<br>  <br>  They need some young guys on defense - the ownership needs to thing long term instead of season-to-season and build their defense up the ol-fashioned way (with time and conditioning)<br>  <br>  The redskins also need to find more players for Campbell to throw to - and then, then if Campbell still cant cut it, they need to put Colt in the game<br>  <br>  GO COLT !!!!!!!|`|zFNOaDAYaa	Contender?

Their problem is offense. They have some good players with a lot of talent, their offense just doesn't always perform at the level they should.

4wRyTY9Raa	Good question, i really don't know the answer, but i do know that Fitzroy were known as the gorilla's.<br>  Hawthorn were the mayblooms.<br>  sth melbourne were the bloods.<br>   it's interesting to know or find out how they got there names.<br>  <br>  EDIT-<br>  found this, so here is your answer.<br>  <br>  In the absence of the VFA team, there was no need for the "Same Olds" distinction and, by 1922, the other nicknames "Sash Wearers" and "Essendonians" that had been variously used from time to time were also abandoned. The team became universally known as "The Dons" (from EssenDON); it was not until much later, during the War years of the early 1940s, that they became known as "The Bombers" — due to Windy Hill’s proximity to the Essendon Aerodrome.[7]|`|7Ek9YkUhaa	Idk good question, i'd like to know how they got their name.<br>  <br>  West Coast are blue and gold for the sea and sand, although the stupid gold coast is now coping our idea!<br>  <br>  And I thought it was the swans because at the time of relocating they had a load of Western Australians in their side and WA's state emblem is the Swan, could be wrong though.<br>  <br>  ?i@m_B?mbers why don't you allow email?<br>  okay then that's understandable, I was just wondering.|`|sjWBmBTCaa	Don't have a go at me for this because it is a fact, Essendon at one time were known as "The blood stained *******" this is true.|`|WwQ1y5TMaa	Because generally bombers drive planes|`|wRSbZcNxaa	Essendon football club got their nickname the bombers & the dons in 1922 when Essendon had to move from East Melbourne now known as jolimont railway yards where they played most of their games before having to move to Essendon recreation oval where they have played ever since. Essendon airport opened in the early 1920's where bomber planes would land "hence" this is where their nickname the bombers came from....|`|BQ7rS5m2aa	Not sure about the mascot, but Port Adelaide chose black, white, silver & teal to represent the Port River (and of course to differ themselves from Collingwood). So, unless there isn't any story behind 'Power' I would assume they chose it to suit the colours.|`|guAFsmNjaa	maybs because there is essendon airport and as in bomber planes|`|vcaFkuphaa	Because ..... I have know idea, good question! <br>  <br>  Maybe we wern't always called the bombers?|`|okOxlu4Faa	dftm is actually correct, most clubs provide detailed histories of their origins but Essendon understandably tries to gloss over this fact. Most of the teams were known simply as Essendon Footbal Club, Richmond Football Club etc. and supporters gave them nicknames that coincided with their playing uniforms (which is why Melbourne used to be known as the fuchias lol!) Back at the turn of the 20th century open racism was an everyday part of life thus "blood stained *******" was a product of the prejudices of this era. Perhaps ironically the "Bombers" now have the equal highest Koorie representation in the league.|`|H7AcXAyaaa	Essendon airport.|`|mXFOru11aa	ok i'm confused too why is essendon called Bombers but their Mascot is a mozzie?
r5AMG8g7aa	All of the above. Depends on the instructor. Problem is there are many fakes out there that are claiming to be something that they are not. Be careful who you train with. Krav Maga like many MMA schools are being run by people that simply do not have proper training, and should not be teaching. The laws do not prevent anyone from teaching.  Anyone cane claim to be anything they wish and open classes. As long as they pay taxes and do what any business is expected to do there is nothing anyone can do about it.|`|NJMzhcKhaa	Actually, Krav Maga is easy but useless.|`|SWDIDXOtaa	Kinda depends on what you are looking for. If you want to learn a martial art as a hobby, then Krav Maga is not for you. It is not a martial art but a self defense system, and it is very brutal. It was developed for the Israeli Army and is designed to do the most possible damage in the shortest time possible. In Krav Maga it goes defend, counter attack, then keep attacking until the threat is nuetralized.<br>  <br>  If you are actually serious about self-defense, then Krav Maga is among the best out there. You start by learning basic strikes, wrist-releases, escapes from basic chokes and headlocks, 360 degree defense, and inside defense. In the more advanced levels you learn stick defense, knife defense,  gun defense, etc.<br>  <br>  While it does take dedication and training, Krav Maga is pretty simple to learn. It's based on the body's natural reactions to attacks, which enables the new recruits of the Israeli Army to become proficient in it in as short a time possible.|`|4d13f34c6f100ed6121b3208fd700099aa	havent trained it but from what ive read it can be hard.<br>  <br>  i would hardly call it boring though.|`|e86f624ac7abafd2725c361b122b48f9aa	Anything that's not hard is not worth it.|`|qgr0sT8naa	it's hard work, but still a lot of fun

All time means the entire history of the league. The Super Bowl has only been played in the last 30some years. They had a championship game before that. The Packers have twice as many championships as the Steelers. in 75 seasons, the Steelers have managed a winning record a whole 35 times. That means 40 times the steelers couldn't win more than they lost.

I only play at h&h paintball brantford and do not go in the tree forested area to pla so what do you think i should get?|`|QcmNHRzyaa	yes you can you may need to buy a clamping feedneck and sand the halo feedneck down a little|`|7530d621e9d31ae44b57540e48cb990baa	You could probably put it on if you had an elbow because Halo feednecks are huge.

wPlfPc0gaa	How can PCB, Miandad, Younis Khan, etc say Broad is wrong? <br>  Chris Broad has been at the scene of terror,  coming face to face with the terrorists. PCB, Miandad and Younis Khan  were not. Is PCB trying to cover up the security lapses and the substandard treatment meted out to the visiting team or are PCB too a part of the conspiracy?<br>  An Enquiry done reveals that there were serious security lapses.<br>  Not only that even what Muralitharan said backs Broad's claims. Why aren't the PCB responding to that.<br>  As a matter of fact, the Sri Lankan govt has ruled out all possibilities of an Indian hand in Lahore attacks.<br>  I think Chris Broad deserves an apology from PCB.<br>  <br>  ---<br>  Congratulations to Indian women's for Trashing Pakistan by 10 wickets in the women's world cup opener.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  Miki, This is for you, mate.<br>  'Taufel Blasts Pakistan security' - <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/international/australia/4941705/Sri-Lanka-cricket-attacks-Umpire-Simon-Taufel-blasts-Pakistan-security.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket...</a><br>  <br>  Why is Broad singled out?|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	pakistan has habit of saying strange things|`|b7f6b1292b666a974a7a9c247d278b21aa	It appear this the neo Islamic culture to have guests slaughtered.<br>  <br>  I am sure they would also asking for the life ban on Sri Lankan cricketers(Murali, more particularly) and Simon Tauffel who said they were "like sitting ducks"<br>  <br>  Rameez Raja has also joined in condemning Taufel.  <br>  <br>  He also has proved a great joker by pleading that ICC should not isolate Pakistan.  I feel he wants more and more cricketers killed.<br>  <br>  Their President is a puppet and like the security provided to the puppet, Sri Lankan were also provided security (i.e., the lack of it!).<br>  <br>  Sri Lankan intelligence is also responsible.  They have exposed their lack of Intelligence and also why so pre-tour security check was not conducted by the Sri Lankan authorities?  Better Mr. Premadasa answers this!<br>  <br>  Now Australian, British and others were at the receiving end of this terrorism existing in Pakistan at first hand, hope they may demand stricter action against the Government sponsored terrorism industry, which is thriving despite economic slow down in the world!|`|NDbx9CSvaa	yea, today morning I read Miandad was demanding and now even Younis Khan is demanding the same. Those freaking Pakis will always blame others for such incidents. When the Mumbai shootings happened, they tried their very best to deny all claims that the terrorists were Pakis and trying to show that India was lying. Now also they are trying to show that the Sri Lankan's and the match referees are liars by claiming they provided adequate security. Heck even the bus driver now says the security was more than adequate (they probably told him to say that else he'll lose his job). And, some A**hole minister even suggested that the terrorists came from India and that they even had evidence to prove that. They probably were local terrorists returning to their beloved Pakistan. Isn't it completely bizarre that the only day Younis Khan decides to make the team travel 5 mins later than SL, the attacks happen?

AA10241450	My favorite training that dramatically reduced my times was using Sebestian Coe's coaching methods which balances your speed program for longer and shorter intervals.  This method is probably best for you since it will help your 400 meters speed along with a 10K if you decide later to move up in distance.  It will also help if you periodically do a 5K race since your be challenged by more experienced runners or for Cross country season. Your speed sessions are:<br>  <br>  A) 2 miles X 3 at 10K pace with 30 second rests<br>  B) 1 mile X 4 at 5K pace with 30 second rests <br>  C) 400 meters X 8 at 1 miles pace with rests to 120 heart beats per minute <br>  D) 200 meters X 16 at 400 meter pace<br>  <br>  Try doing 2 of these intervals per week - 3 if you don't have a race.  You can omit A for this season since your goal is a sub 5 minute mile or when your peaking so you can reduce some distance and concentrate on quality intervals.  The paces help to make you a better runner and teaches aerobic/anaerobic threshold running and anaerobic intervals in case of 200 meter sprints for working endurance and speed.  The paces vary dramtically depending on your PR's - your 10K pace should be a challenge however not difficult since your not accumulating lactic acid as much as with 200 meter sprints. The paces also will help you in running in any situation from a tactical race that is slow to a fast breaking race.  Good luck with your PR's.|`|EfaQpsd5aa	thats my goal to! i run a 5:17 right now, and i want to breack 5min!

Keep up with your schoolwork. If you're failing or barely passing a subject you'll get kicked off the team for awhile.<br>  2. You'll have to do some serious training. Do about 25-30 1600m a week. And every time you do one increase your speed slightly <br>  (you don't want to hurt yourself and not get to reach your goal).<br>  If none of that doesn't work talk to your track coach about it for some tips. <br>                                                            -Mari   Age:11|`|e5e7b6abc96b5c6e410bc10bc14ce363aa	What you should do is run the 30-40 a week and then get in at least 1 tempo for 15 minutes at race pace. then you should do what we call broken 8's where your run a 800, jog 100, then do another 800, jog 100, walk a lap.<br>  then run a 600, jog 100, run a 500, then jog 100.<br>  walk one lap.<br>  run 400, jog 100, run 300.<br>  walk one lap.<br>  run a 100, jog 50, do another 150 jog 50 and then finish with another 100.<br>  (*these should be done with ur 800 times*)<br>  u should also run 4x400's<br>  8x200's<br>  12x100<br>  1x1600.<br>  this will help u get out fast and help u stay the same speed due to ur speed training( it will get u used to running fast for a long period of time)<br>  <br>  trust me i got my 1 mile time down from 5:23 to 4:45 in a season|`|BB6HGbnPaa	Yes it is possible to break 5 minute by the end of track season. Just keep running the way your running and if you dont break it this season, you are definitely going to break it next season. As a freshman, thats a fast time and as you get better, you can probably hit 4:30.
5b5e3b4f114d52c05fdb151a2f5b2317aa	Depending on what position you play, make sure you let them know that's where you play best. You don't want to be stuck at 2nd when you're used to Center.<br>  Other than that, pee before tryouts because you will probably be nervous, and if you have to pee, you know that's all you'll be thinking of.<br>  Keep your eye on the ball, and if you're infield, make sure to clear out any rocks in front of you. Loosing teeth is no fun.<br>  Good luck!!!|`|241VNhclaa	Take a deep breath and relax. Stretch out well even before you get to the fields and bring plenty of water. It would also be a good idea to maybe take a small jog before you go. Most teams will make you run so be prepared.|`|EXArkmVWaa	i have try-outs 4 baseball (the real ****) monnday, i know what ur goin through, just do ya best soooo yea just use roids|`|x5PO3L1Yaa	i argree with the one above me|`|BILIAKSOaa	I had softball tryouts a couple weeks ago.

Practice the basics before you leave and make sure you tell them what position you play best so they know what to have you do. Also, pee before you go even if you don't have too ! I got so nervous and kept messing up on my tryouts because I had to pee really bad lol (: Be confident and prepared. Good luck & hope you do good. (:|`|eac78f41a64d286478c23785cf30be23aa	Stretch well. focus on your abs and lower back...These are the areas that tighten up when you're nervous.  If you're too tense around your midsection, it could mean the difference between a good play and a ball going through your legs.<br>  <br>  Warm up well.  Do some sprints or whatever it takes to get a good sweat going before you start the tryouts.  This will ensure you're warmed up and also help settle the nerves.<br>  <br>  Finally, focus on what you do well.  If you're a contact hitter, now is not the time to swing for the fences.  If you're not a slick infielder, now is not the time to try a quick diving backhand and spin-throw.  If you stay within you're abilities, you'll maintain your focus and confidence level...and those things will be noticed by the coaches.|`|RoNAr2Imaa	I hav played softball every year since I was in 2nd grade. Make sure you don't act afraid of the ball and don't cry if you get hit. Your coach will think ur a wuss and u won't make it.|`|WeEjc79Uaa	Well, get a good nights sleep first of all.

Williams is like Kidd, he's got the size and strength to grab rebounds and force smaller players into turnovers. but since your question is who's better, i like williams because he can play in more than just a fast break (so can paul he's just quicker and flashier), on the offensive end, if the transition D is back fast enough, he can either post up or draw it out on the pick. On defense, like i said, he forces other guards to pass it before trying to drive. Williams might not get as many steals as Paul but it's because Paul is faster, and guards will try to get past him. Williams deters smaller guys. He's not an all star yet, mostly because of injury but because his game is so fundamentally rounded out, it's very arguable that he might be the one PG right now that could be better than CP3. i like defense and both guys have it, just in different ways. that's good for Team USA, it gives them a different look instead of having 2 of the same, just a sidenote.|`|6yoQhXsOaa	Deron Williams is better than Chris Paul at everything good. Marc Jackson or whatever the commentators name was during the game was said Deron Williams is better than Chris Paul.|`|ae9858633deed377699c4fe70d00725baa	Chris Paul is much better then DeRon Williams.|`|sjnzoERfaa	lol no competition chris paul|`|j0YJX8U6aa	CP3 is better but I wouldnt be surprise if that changes|`|T8fldPKmaa	paul|`|4DcvpQXfaa	I like D-Will more|`|VZMLMHLpaa	Chris Paul. better stats, better record, and less to work with. im not going to knock on Deron Williams..hes very talented. but right now Chris Paul is playing at a higher level and the Olympics is a great example of how Chris Paul is better than Deron Williams.

ZbNXVQu7aa	Sizemore first, then Beltran, and finally Upton<br>  <br>  There isn't much difference between Sizemore and Beltran, but the extra HRs and SBs have me favoring Sizemore.<br>  <br>  The SLG, HR, and RBI categories all work against Upton in that format, and he doesn't provide enough SBs to deserve being drafted ahead of Beltran.|`|eac78f41a64d286478c23785cf30be23aa	Grady would be my first pick.<br>  <br>  Based on the last three years, he's a good bet to get well over 600 ABs, and he'll probably end up with around 120 R, 29 HR, 90 RBI and 35 SB.<br>  <br>  Beltran's 3-year numbers are very close to Grady...about 10 higher in RBI but about 10 lower in SB.  But last year was the first time since 2002 he actually made it to 600+ ABs, so I'd have concerns about his durability and decline in power.<br>  <br>  Upton is the "wildcard" and could very well have the best season of the three....or he could settle in as a 18 HR / 70 RBI guy.  Because you're talking about "now" and not the "future." I'd let someone else take the risk.|`|6vzpHTqQaa	Grady Sizemore<br>  <br>  The guy will most likely go for 30/30 this year (that's 30HR/30SB).  He's done it the past three years, why not do it again?  Beltran is on the downside of his career and Upton doesn't really hit homers.|`|rzc1oLktaa	Bj Upton Hands Down.|`|ae9858633deed377699c4fe70d00725baa	Best player is Sizemore at this time.

Sizemore does a little of everything and is just good and not injury prone.|`|x8sFzzUIaa	I think Sizemore is the best right now.

He's 2-3 years away from reaching his potential.<br>  <br>  Beltran has come off 3 good years, but still seems to be underperforming based on his tremendous blend of speed and power. But his average gets stuck on .280, when you expect him to hit .300.<br>  <br>  Sizemores got great potential, but last year hit only .268, while striking out 130 times...but that's in 634 AB's. Sizemore has yet to have a real breakout year.<br>  <br>  I have to go with Beltran...he's still in his prime, while Sizemore hasn't reached his full potential yet.<br>  <br>  You said this year only.|`|c68b31739ffbee17f6dfc635bbe9ffddaa	Sizemore, Betran, Upton<br>  I feel Sizemore is good, but soooo over rated.

Lake fish feed there at sun up and sun down and trout, steelhead, salmon bass and other predators too will set up there to watch for tasty morsels caught in the downstream offerings at the mouth of the lake.

AA10270018	It is the same in doubles first, third and every odd game...|`|nR1887O1aa	The rule for changing ends is the same for doubles (after every odd game) however, when a new set begins you can change which player serves first. That way the same person is not looking into the sun every time. A good strategy is if one of you is right-handed and one is left-handed neither of you will have to face the sun if you set your rotation up correctly.|`|5oIE4Mypaa	It's the same in doubles.

SIKuOevVaa	Even though I'm an Arsenal fan and looooooooathe Tottenham, I'll try to be objective -- besides, I can't stand Man U either (so I won't be watching this monstrosity).<br>  <br>  I think it all depends on how much Sir Rudolph the Red-Nosed Manager wants it.  If he sends out a "junior varsity," Spurs could do it, especially if Darren Bent gets on one of those hot streaks.<br>  <br>  However, if it's tied going into the last minutes of regulation, Sir Alex may decide he wants to make a point.  He may send in fresh legs.  The chubby legs of Rooney.  The waxed legs of Cristiano Ronaldo.  And then, if it's still tied after extra time, there's penalty kicks, and good night Spurs.<br>  <br>  Really, Spurs' best chance is if Ferguson doesn't give a damn.  Which makes my fellow Gooners' point: Nobody in the first division, except Tottenham, cares about the Carling Cup.  So Spurs are in a no-win situation.  If they win, everyone says, "Big deal, it's the Mickey Mouse Cup." And if they lose, everyone says, "Hello, Tottenham f(oul)s up again! What did you expect!"<br>  <br>  On the other hand, if you beat ManUre, you'll be doing civilization (or even "civilisation") a big favor.  So you might as well win the thing.|`|c3bf5e50955868d3fa13833ede1663a0aa	Maybe...|`|qO7nbSQVaa	Anything can happen but realistically No.|`|pRklTpuFaa	C'mon united...!<br>  and no i think will man utd will win!! :D|`|VMXl7Up1aa	Only if United don't show up,miracles do happen though especially in cup games.|`|q71osfkiaa	Cmon, say YES WE CAN!

0f213e569404219f01d20decc3749462aa	Housh is going to Seattle, it's almost a done deal. I'd like the Eagles to trade for Boldin. They have two first round picks this year; I think they should at least deal one and anything else to get a deal done for Boldin. They just upgraded their O-Line with Shawn Andrews brother, Stacy Andrews, so thats a good thing. If Tony Gonzalez is also available as he was at the trade deadline, he'd fit in well.<br>  <br>  I think the 49ers might possibly have a chance at drafting Crabtree if I'm not mistaken (Long shot). I'd much rather go for him then second-tier wideouts like Nate Washington, Devery Henderson or an aging posession wideout such as Coles. So if I were them, I'd probably wait it out till next year, or make a draft day deal.<br>  <br>  Brian Dawkins is also now on the market, and even at his age of 35 made his seventh Pro Bowl last year; I feel not only his leadership and intensity but his level of play can still help a contender.|`|SJEXY7Ufaa	as a STEELER fan I am watching our division rivals big name players jumping ship...gonna be another easy north win|`|KZsdVGJzaa	well i don't think the Rams have far to go. but yea i'd prefer them to jus pick up some decent FA and build more through the draft|`|5B6w8mxVaa	hope cowboys get lewis|`|Boc1Buuwaa	Bart Scott signed with the Jets|`|qSZfVDWUaa	you know

lrJN4M49aa	Last time we won a playoff game was 2005. Better question is when is the last time the cowgirls won a playoff game (13 years ago). Only time will tell if this is a bad deal or not, if  Haynesworth stays healthy and is a beast for the next five year, he is worth it. Yes we have been trying to buy a superbowl, but because we made mistakes in the past doesn't mean we shouldn't spend. We need to better evaluate talent stop spending on players who are to old to be productive, don't fit are offensive or defensive scheme, or player who once they get paid don't put in maximum effort anymore. I would rather have an owner who spends then one who doesn't, i don't want to end up like the Detroit Lions|`|WaaFCtuOaa	I have been a die hard Redskins fan since 1970 & have seen good times as well as bad & as long as Daniel Snyder is the owner, I hate to say this, but as much as I want them to reach the post season, he continually pays big $$$ to over-rated players, old players past their prime & trade away my favorite player, Champ Bailey|`|cDKkKEgvaa	Hey he has a net worth of $1.3 billion........if he's got the money then why not?  Why do you care what he spends his money on, he has plenty of it just be glad you aren't paying for Haynesworth<br>  <br>  Not saying Haynesworth is worth that much money.....but if the guy has the money don't freaking worry about it....live your life and he'll live his!|`|mTSOJKlyaa	100 mil in redic|`|wAiQOP0Laa	He's probably third to Al Davis and Jerry Jones in overpaying players.  He overpaid an old Jason Taylor last yer, he's overpaying a overrated Hall.  However, I have to agree with the Haynesworth signing.  He had a monster contract year, true, but he was good before then as well.  If we get an average Haynesworth he'd be an upgrade at the tackle spot.  <br>  <br>  He doesn't try to buy superbowl teams though, that's a bit of an exaggeration.  He's known to build the offense the offense through the draft in all fairness.  However, he pays big money for "proven" defensive players.  That's his flaw.  If he had the same patience with the D that he does with the offense, he wouldn't actually be that bad.|`|Y5S2dDkYaa	I have been a Redskins fan since the original Gibbs days - I was 12 win they won their last superbowl; and yes, Virginia, Snyder is an Idiot<br>  <br>  Hew  is far more sinister than your run-of-the-mill idiot though - he is also a megalomaniac billionaire with no restraint or discrepency for fiscal responsibilty. He is essentially the Steinbrennar of football.<br>  <br>  Lets consider the past 8 yrs - Jason taylor, Deion Sanders, Jeff George, Adam Arshuleta - I like Haynesworth and Hall, but do not like Snyder. We should trade him to Dallas.|`|a1fa483b68a91fb247652338cc26b6e7aa	He is an idiot. I like the pickup but don't like the contract. Cant have it both ways I guess. The defense was ranked #4 in the league last season with no DLine. Haynesworth will make the D scary good next season. Too bad Albert can't play offense. As far as the last playoff win, that was 3 years ago unlike the Cowboys streak of 12 years.|`|qXsbRsiXaa	Hanes is a monster but I dont think he was really worth 100 million. IT was a good pick up though for sure, but now they need to stop working on the defense and fix the offense.|`|ILW3vkhEaa	yes cuz haynesworth is not worth that much money, they will be regretting this move in a few years, and they will still finish last in the division.|`|6AfM6SWaaa	jerry jones is cowboys im confused|`|bIbyAkHPaa	Snyder is a fool to buy headcase players.|`|f7qVtYfaaa	he has mortgaged the franchise on this deal , better hope haynesworth is a monster for the next three or four years|`|xXa3eQOeaa	Snyder is an IDIOT!<br>  <br>  How many decent players had to be released, to make room for "Fat Albert"?<br>  How much weaker is the overall TEAM, without THEM?<br>  Haynesworth is only one guy. A very stupid move!
XLXncQu9aa	Based on reports I've heard that it could be Luke McCown.  I think having Luke the starting QB is a bad idea.  I think it should be Griese as long as he produces.  Griese is nearing the end of his career, but there were signs that he showed improvement while in Tampa Bay.  But I I have to agree with you, Josh Johnson should get some reps during the season, but its likely he won't.  Josh should probably be the future of that franchise.  The Bucs eliminated themselves for contention next season because they released a lot of their veteran guys that actually produced.  Now you have question marks at the QB position.  I think since they have question marks they need to re-build with their young guy Johnson.  They should give him a shot since they know what they will get with Griese and McCown.|`|KZsdVGJzaa	ur dreaming if Jeremy Maclin and Michael Crabtree will b available at 16 (u r i think). Mayb they can get Percy Harvin. and to answer ur question, I'm not exactly sure who any of their QB's r. I'm guessing they're gonna get someone in FA|`|LuWT8KQBaa	Tampa Bay is even further down the list in the draft. Maclin and Carbtree won't make it out of the top 10. Why would you want a poor man's Mike Vick? I don't think people even want the regular Mike Vick. His accuracy sucked. I think the Bucs are just SOL on a QB this year. They should have done like the Vikes and looked for a guy like Rosenfels. Maybe they can resurrect Derek Anderson from the FA. The Bucs offense is pitiful, and Winslow won't change that. He'll just become pitiful with them.|`|e6TD1j1gaa	Jeff Garcia last year,,, next year looks like Luke McCown or Brian Griese... neither or whom I think will be of much use at all. <br>  <br>  Just heard that the Bucs traded for Kellen Winslow, so there's an option at TE, if he can stay on the field and shut his mouth once he steps off it.|`|X1OHx67caa	Imma bucs fan, so i hear things.<br>  <br>  It looks like it's gonna be a competition between McCown and Johnson..or maybe Josh Freeman if they draft him with the 19th pick.

A cup, especially in football is too restricting to play in, and run in. That is why its such a big deal at the bottom of pile ups where you hear people grabbing..."things" That aren't theirs.

Except for the 2 years when I was playing center.  I'd rather not have another man's knuckles directly on my frank and beans.<br>  <br>  Though I figure linemen would have LESS need to wear one, since there's less impact force and more push force.  Please you should always be leaning forward on the line.  Way I figure it, if I'm standing straight enough to get hit in the nuts, I deserve to get hit in the nuts.
86VgnUmQaa	I asked a question similar to yours last week. One of the tips was to eat a banana.<br>  <br>  So, if you eat breakfast about 3 hours before the tryouts, do this<br>  <br>  3 hours beforehand: eat some toast, and vitamins & water<br>  <br>  1 hour beforehand, eat a banana :P<br>  <br>  if you don't have a lot of time, just eat a banana<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|YhYSZlroaa	what you've eaten so far is fine. You should have a decent dinner for energy tommorow. no cereal in the morning, because the milk won't be good for your stomach while running. Toast in the morning, and an energy bar before tryouts and you should be good. thats what i would have whenever i had a cross country meet, so i know what im saying|`|D3hJ55XPaa	Going with lots of carbs is never a bad idea, as they will be your body's first source of energy.  Pasta and rice will do the trick.  For breakfast, depending on how soon your tryouts are, you probably don't want to eat too much meat since meat is quite heavy and makes you sluggish.  Something like oatmeal will give you the energy you need, and some fruits as well.|`|FhrCLLzFaa	You're gonna wanna eat more than that.<br>  You need energy if you're gonna be doing a lot of running!|`|3pMQE32Vaa	well to be healthy eat fruit|`|KJMOvKcSaa	maybe meats for protein|`|1CTlViGBaa	dnt starve yourself just keep it light. water. cracker. fruit. yourgurt lil snack foods that arent fatty or filled with sugar it may slow u dwn
c4GykfVkaa	sorry, i don't think so:(|`|BSqDYs1eaa	might win a game|`|Nj8lj0ZZaa	Nah, I'm a gunners fan, but I don't think they deserve to win anything this season, the team is in a real bad shape, Arsene Wenger needs to spend huge loads of money to bring new players in every position, or else it will be difficult for them to compete for any trophy next season too.|`|O5KOwhovaa	Hopefully they'll win the FA Cup.<br>  <br>  <br>  Because it would be better than Man U or Everton winning it.|`|7d41e22f79cabbca0ca379a3a7aa40c6aa	I hope they rock.|`|ntLqwEDnaa	theyll win my ******* ****.|`|TutWAUJjaa	maybe if there is an award for best youth team??
bIbyAkHPaa	Almost all USC QB's are busts.<br>  Leinart<br>  Marinovich<br>  Salisbury<br>  McDonald<br>  etc.|`|mz9siXuTaa	Mark Sanchez will most likely be a bust. He does not have as much experience as other Qb's I feel sorry for the team that stumbles upon Sanchez, and is preassured into picking him.|`|gF6pgy8raa	In my opinion, it depends what system he goes to. A team the Jets, he would not succeed.|`|KZsdVGJzaa	i think the guy has potential but he needs to b supported by a good team. Example the Buccaneers he would b pretty successful there but if he goes to a team like the uh Jaguars with no wide receivers at all then yea he would b a bust|`|dbc3503ab379d3f8b3803c2488ab5e36aa	Most likely USC QB's are nothing more but system quarterbacks who once they get to the league really don't do much. Palmer had a chance if it wasn't for the injury back in 2006|`|0Ub8hoN6aa	ya... <br>  lets not count leinart dead he still has a year or two to redeem his so far stumbling career... but i have the odds stacked against him heavily seeing as leinart and john david booty have not done to well in the nfl and sanchez has less experience than both of them... not to mention booty started over sanchez at usc and couldn't go past 3rd string qb at minnesota, a team with qb struggles all year... he's all hype and won't go anywhere... weak qb class once you get past matt stafford|`|RrKeyYo0aa	leinart stayed 2 years at USC... sanchez 1, he needs to sit under a proven vet for 2 or 3 years. carson palmer (and his heisman) did, leinart (and his heisman) is, if he get's thrown to the wolves early, then oh yeah... he's a bust.|`|XOtN0mzNaa	Yup.  He should have stayed and played another season at USC too.|`|6AfM6SWaaa	yes
2C8Kjj78aa	Go to their next match and take some notes, and help readers feel as though they were there.  You don't have to do a play-by-play, but you can write up a particular rally that you thought was exciting.  Interview a couple of players on the winning team (hopefully from your school, but if not, get at least a comment from one person on the other team).  <br>  <br>  Get a couple of comments from the coach of your school's team about how the match went and what s/he was expecting.  <br>  <br>  Find out who the team captain is, and do a couple of sentences about how long she's been playing volleyball and what she likes about the game.  <br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|vgCw179baa	just simpley write about how good of a team they are and how empressive there skills are even f they arnt that good.talk about the coach and what the girls think about the season.
qAJWFJlqaa	that look is there year after year anyways, so i gotta go with haynesworth getting knocked over or better yet juked so bad he falls over.|`|zFNOaDAYaa	The look on the fans faces would be my choice. It's too bad cause it really looks like the Redskins are genuinely trying to make a push at a championship. Kind of a shame.|`|jLOCqhckaa	Haynesworth getting run over...by Brandon Jacobs or coming face to face with the best O-Line in the league|`|GJycKc5Laa	does it involve getting kickd in the nuts cuz thts hilarious|`|ILW3vkhEaa	the look on the dumb redskin fans when they see fat albert be lazy or get injured and still won't be close to making the playoffs|`|k2AmQylBaa	o i know ! I can't wait to see Haynesworth be a complete waist of 100 million! and im gonna have to go with the look on the fans faces|`|UgnMjtYDaa	An injury to any key player in that defensive scheme throws a wrench in the whole thing. Jason Taylor will miss some games due to back pain. Hall can't tackle. I can't wait to see the empty seats. The redskins should recoup and trade Albert for a TOP 5 PICK.
43daa72d6abd58775d0e46a24824eddeaa	top ten no doubt. some of the guy's who put russell as #1 are dreamers. russell was a great champion on a team of H.O.F players and coaches! he was incomplete because he couldn't score or pass. outside all the rings and D, shaq is much better. there are only three centers that were better than shaq.....kareem, hakeem, and maybe, wilt. malone gets an hon. mention, other than these guys. shaq has the ups'|`|2972f919bb971e541701418e09d5d8c5aa	1, IMO. he may have not won as many championship as Bill Russell, or put up the stats that Wilt did, but they played in a different time where the rules weren't as refined.<br>  <br>  the NBA had to create the 3 second rule just to give everyone else in the league the ability to beat a team he was on, because he was literally unstoppable before then.|`|EKF2HdZKaa	its honestly an opinion question<br>  i would put him 5th<br>  1.Bill Russel<br>  2.Wilt Chamberlin<br>  3.Kareem Abdul Jabbar<br>  4.Tim Duncan<br>  5.Shaq|`|CHdQqxM4aa	1.

Considering the NBA had to change the strength of the hoops just for him, I think that says something. In his best days, he was dominate. Even old and washed up, he is not the worst center out there. Even Michael Jordan sucked after he stayed in the game too long.|`|21J0IIZbaa	1. Wilt<br>  2. Kareem<br>  3. Shaq<br>  4. Hakeem<br>  5. Russell<br>  6. Robinson<br>  7.

The 3 second rule has been around for many years, before all of these. The widened lane is more likely as an equalizer.

Yg1QR4mmaa	This is so true and in my opinion it is better because it comes from real fans, my personal favorite is boxing info. Bloodboxing and Buddhaphy are both great show as well. I just watched the new episode of P4P. A guy I would recommend if you like really good highlight videos and interesting boxing videos from the past is a fella by the name of RoosterforLIfe. Check him out if you have the chance.<br>  <br>  And Bolo Punch Boxing Hour, great show that covers all areas of boxing.|`|Ra8x4QQgaa	gaurd your grill boxing all day  baby. GYGB. but what yall know about that boxing 4 real now called omega boxing. I used to like pound 4 pound boxing but they put to many emotions in certain fighters who they always pick to win but lose.|`|4432bf9b709422220cc7a44ccbf8f500aa	Please pardon the shameless plug, but I invite anyone wanting to hear a quality boxing radio show on youtube. . . to check out the show I've hosted every Thursday night since 2002. . . The Bolo Punch Boxing Hour.  <br>  <br>  I often listen to other shows, too. . .just to get a feel for "what is out there" . . . and if you are able to listen live on a Thursday night, we have chatroom capablity so your questions for our live guests can get asked immediately.  Guests we've had on our airwaves recently include Shannon Briggs, Nate Campbell, BJ Flores, Juan Diaz, and Bert Sugar.  <br>  <br>  We're not professional broadcasters.  We're just four guys that like to sit around and talk boxing.  It's the show I'd tune in for if I didn't host it.

Iod5edCSaa	who can remember that far back.|`|xRPjgGs1aa	Forward|`|NWMwWTxyaa	He doesnt shoot at all.....he never is playing.....maybe he should try not jumping when he shoots to lower the risk of injury.......because from what i see his knees are made of glass......he could have been great but once again injuries kill a career......i guess there is still sometime but what makes people think it wont come back again to bite him
96e87a34be378117a6ffb1fd3c4f9db4aa	It would be helpful to know more about what specifically you are interested in finding out about.  There are a ton of websites that explain the basics like scoring and game play with Wikipedia probably being the most general and there are also a lot of videos on YouTube that can show you different grips and shots.<br>  <br>  As for personal suggestions about playing the game, first off, just have fun.  I wouldn't worry when you're first starting out about hitting the ball over the fence and all that, it's going to happen. If you want to get the most out of the sport, get yourself a decent racquet.  The $19 special at the local department store is okay for just messing around, but if you are at all serious about improving significantly, I'd be prepared to spend $60 to $80 to get a quality model.  Some racquets cost upwards of $200, but for recreational players, realistically you really don't need to spend more than $100 since any improvements you'd notice at the higher price won't be discernable to the average recreational player.  Also make sure you use new balls every time you play competitively.  I practice with old balls, but I never play a match without a fresh can because there really is a huge difference in bounce with new balls.<br>  <br>  I don't know where you are located (isn't the internet a wonderful thing) but here in the U.S. most major metropolitan areas have tennis leagues to join so you can play tennis in a social atmosphere at any skill level.  I live in Atlanta, Georgia USA and am a member of two leagues, and I'm not very good, but there are 5 leagues I know of just in this area.  I imagine that even if you are in another country that some sort of national authority or federation could put you in touch with resources for playing recreational tennis.  I wish your question was more specific because there are a lot of things I can speak to that I haven't covered.|`|976d29535eb417416a2e21ba6bfa5288aa	lol

It will come when it comes and girls can smell desperation a mile off - and they don't like it. Instead of looking, concentrate on things that you enjoy and developing new interests.

sd65CtLYaa	Here's a few things (in general)...<br>  <br>  1. Have CONFIDENCE in yourself -- if you're not confident in yourself, then how can the coach be confident in you?  (not to be confused with being cocky)<br>  <br>  2. Listen to your coach -- if you don't listen, the coach will hate it<br>  <br>  3. Play to your strengths -- try to showcase what you're best at<br>  <br>  4. Communicate -- talk & listen to your teammates<br>  <br>  5. Rebound -- or at least prevent your man from getting a rebound...one of the worst things you can do (in other words, make sure to block out!)<br>  <br>  These are just some general answers, but I've actually got a website with a page dedicated just to basketball tryout tips @<br>  <a href="http://www.basketball-tips-and-training.com/tips-for-basketball-tryouts.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.basketball-tips-and-training....</a><br>  <br>  Check out the page if you want some more in-depth tips.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|F05yVezraa	Pray to God|`|NDkHAuniaa	pretty much show that you're committed and dedicated to be on the team. do not start slacking when you're running drills or even running laps. do not show that you're exahusted or even tired. since it's three days away, start working on your jumpshot to perfect it.
