po62AbPqaa	rats need time to relax and get used to their new environment...all the smells and sounds are strange to them. They like routine and it can take weeks or even a month before you have built up a solid routine with them and also for them to come to trust the sounds and smells in their new environment.    Never never never grab them by the tail because it can cause the skin to 'deglove'...it comes loose from the skeleton of the tail and will not repair...this leads to incredible pain and need for surgery    pet rats have undergone an alteration to at least one gene on  the neural crest that has impacted on their melatonin to seratonin processes and in turn has changed their naturally aggressive behaviour to more benign attitude towards other animals    they should not ever bite unless scared frightened etc. unless of course they are fed through the bars of their cage. rats have poor eyesight and once trained to think that food comes through the bars they are likely to bite at any fingers that come through the bars as they think it is food...usually though these bites are not hard or vicious but can give a fright, especially to a child    let rats develop their trust of you at their own pace...what you are basically aiming for is to build up their trust in you...let them decide when you are ok for them to come out and take food from them    rats love peas, usually, so put some peas on your open palm. situate your palm well away from the ratty and just wait...sooner or later, if all is calm, they will come and grab a pea and run off with it...do this plenty of times per day...gradually move the hand a little closer but not too close too quickly    eventually you rat will feel comfortable about your smell and learn to trust you    VIP...give them TIME to build up trust...DONT FORCE THEM!!! rats have amazing memories and will NOT forget who has hurt them    VIP...take your TIME to let them DEVELOP TRUST for you    this is the best advise any one will give...good luck with it :>|`|M9o5WpOqaa	Hi there.My baby rats all did the same thing,though I had one that was braver and much more sociable right from the start.What worked for me is every time I walked past their cage,I would repeatedly speak their names...get them used to your voice.Also,if they won't let you touch them,just put your hands up to the bars so they can get used to your scent,and hold treats (they go crazy for bananas) so they start to associate your hand with food.It doesn't take long,believe me,before they start eating right out of your hand! If you put your hand in the cage,they might bite out of fear,and it REALLY hurts! Also,don't pick them up by their tails,as you could really injure them.|`|Q7xc5Qmzaa	MAY BE YOUR SHOULD DRESS UP AS A RAT SO THEY THINK UR A RAT LOL|`|Km6gOd61aa	Well it kind of sounds like they're frightened of you. you can easily fix this just everyday stick your hand in the cage and let them sniff you, eventually they'll come to realize you're not going to hurt them. Also, most hamsters don't eat out of people's hands.    Oh and also when I first got my hamster they would tun away too. Just grab them and hold them in your hand and lightly storke their little heads. They will come to know you don't want to hurt them and want to befriends with them and they will grow to love you. Now my hamster sleeps on me.|`|McjaM0hDaa	Well for my rats i had to put some food in the middle of my hand and lay it out in the cage, and wait a long time. But it was worth it because after a while they got interested and came out ate the food and started crawling on me and now they trust me alot more. good luck!!!!|`|S9jyc95jaa	You just have to be patient.  It will take a little time and effort to gain their trust.    Stick your hand in their cage everyday.  Don't chase them around or try to grab them.  Rats are curious, and they will eventually approach your hand and sniff you.  (Yeah, you'll be spending a lot of time with your hand stuck in a rat cage. ;) )    After they get used to your hand, start giving them treats.  It's a good idea to give them treats they can't run off with so they *have* to stay by your hand to eat it, like baby food or yogurt.  (My rats LOVE baby food, like banana or sweet potato.)    It really will just take some time.  Eventually they'll get used to you, and come to realize that you're the person who brings them food. ;)|`|I6KKFwxXaa	only one of my 4 did that and I have had her for a year she is just now getting to the point she doesn't run but I never let her get away with it I always picked her up anyway and talked to her. The treats work mine will not take food if I am holding them but will take it if I give it to them while they are in their cage mainly because they want to hoard it and keep coming back for more treats limit how much you allow them to hoard I have to or mine would go all day hoarding they also hoard and bury their block food. I sat next to their cage for 30 minutes to an hour everyday until they got used to me and I left their door open so they could get their curiosity out of the way. good luck and have fun. you didn't say how old they are and I just got a new baby yesterday she is adorable.
w1lh1INHaa	A vet diagnosed melanoma or a black spot?  Black spots on cats' lips are very common and nothing to worry about.  What has your vet suggested?
QxxCN4pVaa	crate training is the best way to train your puppy. dogs never pee or poop in there sleeping area. make sure you bring him outside at least every hour. also take him outside after playing, napping, and about 15 minutes after eating. and puppies will need to be let outside during night to because they really cant hold all night long until they are about 9 months old. also it helps to take away food water around 8pm.|`|EibnoZUPaa	crate train.  schedule.    no, they're not any more difficult than other breeds
c90696a851f3ee0c6b1f63f7f595eca4aa	Dogs and cats often eat grass because it clears out their insides. She may have eaten something and is now trying to get rid of it.|`|11e7b5ad9ba61d1a91f337642b15102eaa	Either put it outside or in the bathroom. Just let her throw up.  Dogs eat grass to. Clean out their stomach. Make sure out have plenty of water for her to drink.|`|GoluIRIAaa	Dogs do that sometimes they eat grass and it makes them throw up it cleans out their systems don't worry about it at all my dog used to do it every couple months its perfectly fine.|`|IxyQpOkpaa	Don't do anything for now, just watch her.  She may have ingested something while she was out of your yard, and is eating the grass to calm her stomach.  I read that animals, esp. dogs and cats, sometimes eat grass if they're not feeling good.|`|PvnRGHt2aa	if the dog is throwing up inside your house and every where else they may have parvo. but if not they probably just ate something bad and are trying to get rid of it.
NaPibFiYaa	Male:  Patches  Teddy    Female:  Sparkle  Star  Poppy  Peanut  Muffin    Good luck!|`|NAHlxbbFaa	This is really stupid probably, but when I got my first hamster, which in fact was a light golden and white teddy bear hamster female, the store clerk asked me what I was going to name her and I just said right of the spot Cutie, because I really didn't know what I was going to name her. Turned out I ended up naming her Cutie, and the name suited her (except for when she always hissed in the car when we turned, which was really weird) and I think Cutie is a great name :]|`|uHCIxJmqaa	we have had a few hamsters and i always watched them and seen how they act.  first one we named HAMHAM  2nd - like to bite so we named nibbles  3rd - pee peed on my friend the first time we got it and named it wizzer.    mr or mrs fluffykins  anything CUTE
aoHjYqrHaa	cover her with a blanket and holder close for warmth  call a emergence vet  try to get her to drink water by using a syringe  quickly get him to the emergence vet  and remember to tuck her up tight in a warm blanket and keep her off her back  try to get her warm but don't sit her near a hot heater  also try comforting her with your voice and sweet talk    i really hope she makes it threw.  if she doesn't I'm very,very sorry.|`|RFuWnx00aa	oh no :( omg im so sorry dumb vets! but im sure they have an emergency line!! dont they? call every vet around, sometimes they leave emrgency numbers on the answering machine..  and how do you know its dying? mybe the bunny had too much water??? i hope so ;( calm down, just confort the little one.. :( i hope the bunny gets better and dont die :(|`|CqQ1DaKDaa	If you don't know of an emergancy vet check the phone book, if you still cant find a one then ring up a local charity such as PDSA, RSPCA or if you're in America another charity. Follow the aboves advice, I'm sure if you do this rationally calmly and as quick as possible she'll make it through. Is she screaming? If she is silent then she may not be dying yet. But they can remain silent under ALOT of pain.|`|rmSdDT5Faa	let it do what it needs to, if its dying, there isnt anything you can do sadly, you can comfort it to make it better for it but really, thats all, you can call the animal hospital in case you need to, their there to help.     id you definitly know its dying its just its time but if its peeing all over  then call the vet immediately for help on what to do.|`|q17Zlq1Zaa	im sorry,maybe put some towels under her,and stay with her.  how do you know she is about to die?  is she very old?|`|NaPibFiYaa	Oh no! Ok, just calm down for now. First of all, what are the signs she's showing that she's dying? Maybe she just drank too much water? Rabbits do make a lot of noise when they're peeing, and they do pee a lot, so maybe she's okay?   Ugh, those vets! They're never open when you need them!  Good luck!|`|TAmsoJAhaa	Just stay calm! Everything will be alright! If she dies she will be in a better place! If she doesn't then everything will be alright. Just breathe and relax.
MPQI8Bg3aa	Buy a healthy weight formula for the fat cat. This allows the cat to still eat enough to feel full, but with not as many calories as a regular formula. Also if you are currently leaving food out all day switch to twice a day feedings. It makes it easier to monitor who is getting what, allowing you to make sure that the skinnier cat isn't getting completely beaten out for food.|`|Enr7zACMaa	I have the same problem with my cats. For the food problem what you do is lock the thin cat in a room with food and keep her in there for 5 minutes. When you come back she should be eating and when she is done let her out. With the fat cat you have to give it less food no matter how much they beg. Also my fat cat had breathing problems and then we discovered that he has asthma so I would bring your cat to the vet's office because cats need to be treated with asthma as soon as possible.|`|Aoa2fwQgaa	Be sure she's getting exercise, give her at least one ten minute play session a day with her favorite toy. You might also want to try giving them wet food once a day because the wet food holds more protein than dry (though be careful because some wet foods can have lots of caramelized sugar in them and can cause teeth problems, I learned that the hard way). What we do with our fat cat, is we don't let her go in and eat until our other two cats have finished eating. As well be sure not to give them too much food. For our cats, we give them, I'd say, a half a cup, maybe a bit more, in the morning, then throughout the day if their food bowl is empty we give them half of what we gave them in the morning. At night before we put them to bed we give them a small, mouse-sized portion of wet food.
8ohAAwrEaa	Blow air onto the cats nose.  That usually gets any animal to stop what they're doing.  If you do this everytime, the cat will associate biting with the feeling of being blown on.      It may take a while with a cat though.|`|5GKKHbgHaa	it might be trying to be playfull..My cat will lick my hand and clean it and then just bite..not dig in but just bite and not move..then she'll continue to lick...|`|iDxoM3X8aa	this can be stopped by spraying the cat with a little water.|`|Enr7zACMaa	You hold them but keep their head away from your body.|`|Aoa2fwQgaa	Keep in mind that a cat's belly is the most vulnerable part of it's body, and it's their natural instinct to protect it. If you don't have a lot of trust with a cat, then when you go to pet their belly they'll try to bite or scratch you. Be careful when petting them, not all cats can be pet as abruptly as a dog, you have to be more timid and calm with most cats, or at least until you gain a lot of trust from them (for example, I have three cats, all of which I can even pet with my feet and they don't care because I've built up years of trust with them). Using a squirt bottle can help the problem, or maybe a light cuff over the ear (lightly swiping your fingers across one of their ears like another cat would do). Sometimes a light tap on the nose can work as well as a scolding mechanism, but it really does have to be a very very light tap because their noses are very sensitive.
rrFbQZzIaa	I'm not completely sure on what you're asking. If you're asking if you should keep the male and female together if the female is pregnant and about to lay eggs? I would seperate them. Dragons should be kept seperate and brought together just for breeding purposes. The male can stress the female and he can also show dominance which may cause the female to eat less or none at all and during such a important time for nutrients, food is imperative. Also when the eggs are incubated and then hatched, you do not want to keep them w/ the mother. You will want to have a completely seperate cage for all the babies and they can be kept together for the immediate future|`|ZQS2Q6cXaa	yes, keep the male in a separate tank. males can be aggressive towards the babies.
MNW0QaC4aa	They may think:  something is down there  they want to make a nest  they have to pee  they want a private place to wash themselves|`|oGVWdnHraa	Most rats just love to dig :D My two boys (and they are def boys, ive never seen testicles that big on a female lol) love to dig in their litter box :D|`|lhmsAlQuaa	He/She is either makeing a nest and NEVER ever give it a towel shirts or any type of cloth cause it can it the fiber on it and can choke on it and if she is preganet NEVER EVER TOUCH the BABYS cause that could mix their scent and the mother wouldnt realize who it is and might aboandon it or worse eat it and they like dark corners sometimes they might make a courner as its bathroom and if it does have babys wait 2 weeks to touch them and avoid cleaning the cage till then thanks you hope this helped you good luck!  (^^)\/|`|zQcOmhjiaa	y u have a stupid rat lol|`|7lH5NPWPaa	Its because he wants to get out of the cage. How would you feel if you were trapped in a cage?|`|NaPibFiYaa	Rodents like to burrow. Its normal. My male hamster does it all the time.   Good luck!|`|07qFHL6iaa	IDK 4 rats but my hammie likes to do that 4 a place 2 pee|`|deU903Iqaa	i think shes a girl and pregnant. makin a nest 4 young|`|jQeQYebmaa	it making a sleping area|`|2nJh3RIqaa	Rats like to dig plain and simple. Its also usually to burrow. Try giving it a brown paper bag or paper towel rolls to keep it occupied
bI7wMCJXaa	For Siamese unless an Angel was watching over your shoulder and there was one in a shelter you will need to contact a breeder. http://www.cfa.org/cbrs.html    Siamese and other purebred cats are no less expensive than a purebred dog from a breeder. Please save a life and adopt one of the millions of homeless kittens that are going to be available over the next few months. Please also make sure your mom wants a kitten. There may be a reason why she doesn't have one now.    Please also be aware that Kittens have the horrible habit of growing up into cats.|`|D6KMUndOaa	check your local pet stores and see what they have out  or the Humane Society|`|tBJZ3RtQaa	Well it depends where u live cause my humane Society has them all the time so you can check there also look online at google also look in ur pet listings in ur newspaper|`|9AnNb7Tbaa	Check your newspaper, pet shops or even online to see where any kittens are for sale near where you live.
DoEUlpadaa	Hogs need a lot of protein.  Get a feed that has soybean meal mixed in.  Be sure to get a self feeder.  This allows a pig to eat any time they want.  Hogs also do better in pairs.  They will grow faster as the other is competition.  Good luck;)|`|AA12189965	go to feed store get HOG GROWER|`|XK9RLaPeaa	No hes probably getting it ready to sell for FFA or the school AG program. That is a pathetic way to get the pigs fatter, so you can cheat the purchaser out of the money. But go ahead, those morons need to be cheated for buying animals to butcher. Pathetic people.|`|EfqPwhu1aa	You're NOT going to eat him are you?!  Because if you are I won't help you. But if he's a runt and  needs to gain weight give it just food scraps. Pigs gain   weight fairly quickly.|`|u61yKsE3aa	sweet feed and a little veggie oil
oOfTCWlEaa	Most people in snowy places take off the shoes in the winter, and this may be why your mare did not have shoes on when she bought them.  Unless the horse is going to be heavily used during the winter, shoes should not be required.  I have experimented with both bare foot and shod, and a lot depends on the horses toughness of her hoof, and tenderness on the underneath.  If you do a lot of trail riding or a lot of riding period shoes should be put on.  Boots like Cavallo's are nice for if you are riding in the winter and you havent called the farrier, but for long term use, I have found that then tend to change the horses step, stride and footing. I would keep the horse shod during heavy use periods.    Hope this helps|`|jyGTlpzTaa	I think it really depends what you are doing with the horse...two hours work a day is not going to work with most barefoot horses.|`|8GDd6lrnaa	the boot sounds great if your on rough or pavement. on dirt i always like bare.|`|qEsas2Ssaa	I believe that shoes are very important for all horses.  We have had ours for 14 years and would never let them go with out them.  It's better for their legs and hoof protection.
pBA58Sjiaa	I have heard that there is some truth to this.  When I got my girl chihuahua, I noticed that she really liked my husband.  I know she loves me, but she gets all goofy with him, and acts like such a girl.  Maybe I am humanizing her, but seeing is believing.|`|2IOFXmQ2aa	I don't think so.  The dog may want to please your boyfriend more because she believes he is the dominant one.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	No, that's not true at all.  Dogs can develop a preference for different sexes but it doesn't matter which sex they are.    An interesting fact though, is that dogs that live primarily with a woman or with women, will often times not be fond of men.  But dogs that live primarily with men usually don't have a problem with women.  Kinda wierd, but it seems to work that way.|`|ae4afccd58f1ebbb8504d0dea2b6cd7faa	I heard that too, although never experienced it.  My male dog takes to me over my roommate just because i spend more time with him.  My ex-boyfriends dog when we were together took him more, and he was male.  My cat is female and doesnt want anything to do with me or my roommate.
XK9RLaPeaa	The third post- Alex- is a great example. They are in it for the money. He breeds his dog over and over and doesnt even know it is breed, not bread. These people shouldnt even be allowed to own a dog. They are in it for the money. They buy a pure breed dog, and make thousands of dollars off of them until every ounce is sucked out. It makes me sick. The people taking these peoples puppies, could have possibly chosen to adopt a shelter dog. So for every puppy these people breed, they are killing a shelter dog.  Alex: And of course vets believe this is justified, they are the ones making all the money off of your puppies!|`|3FL3zIKsaa	I don't know. I promote getting pets fixed, too. I bought my kitty, Token, from an animal shelter. It so sad to think about how many die everyday because there just isn't enough room.    Did you know :    The average number of litters a cat can produce in one year is .::3::.  The average number of kittens in a litter is .::4-6::.  and...  In SEVEN years, one cat and her young can produce .:: 420,000 ::. kittens!|`|MzJSj7Oxaa	I waited 5 years to have my dog neutered.  The reason I waited was because I was so afraid the he would have some kind of negative reaction to the anesthesia, or that he would bleed to death or all bad sorts of things would happen.|`|e4QW4xvOaa	I, myself, do not spay/neuter my dogs because of the fact they are purebred and very costly. I let them bread, and can sell each puppy for 500 dollars each easily. Of course, I only let them bread once a year to keep the mother healthy. Many veterinarians believe my reason is justified and always ask me if my dogs are purebred, and if that is the reason I have not spayed/neutered them.
oOfTCWlEaa	Iceburg lettuce is the safest lettuce you can feed a small animal such as a hamster, but lettuce has fiber strings that are not healthy for a small animal, although it is hard to see, lettuce has fiber like celery. This is very dangerous for the digestive system.  the string fibers can clog up in the intestines and may kill you hamster.  Stick to hay and other fresh veggies and fruits.    Hope this helps|`|ZbOZlU4gaa	yes because it is very healthy for them also it taste good to them.|`|HS44HUrgaa	yes but it has no nutritional value.|`|0L8B1gIMaa	yes|`|X40Ww89qaa	yes|`|1oCUMOW7aa	yea! i do all the time. some of my hamster's faves are ststrawberries, carrots, and tomato|`|SLeX0gGaaa	Yes/ But don't give it a lot. It will get the runs later.|`|JhStKzRiaa	No. Feed your hamster romaine lettuce.|`|Qxk1V55Zaa	you can but iceburg lettuce isn't really good for anything nutritionally thats why you never really give iceburg to lizards.. turtles.. or anything like that|`|XzTa2Pw2aa	Of course :] he/she will love you for that|`|TY8FNnW0aa	Lettuce has no nutritional value at all for hamsters, and contains about 90% water, lettuce will give a hamster diarrhea, or loose stools, depending how much is eaten.   A Hamsters stomach cannot cope with large amounts of water, and feeding him lettuce will overload his system. Prolonged use may also cause liver damage.    EDIT: will idiot thumbs downers please check the official website listed!! Jeez......|`|dNF0fZrSaa	Its just water really...it wont hurt him, but I don't recommend it as a permanent diet...iceburg lettuce has no nutritional value and would probably, eventually make him sick...so as a treat, yeah, I don't see why not|`|Ro2ObPXlaa	You can, but it is not going to do anything for him nutritionally.  Also, do not give him too much, there is a lot of water in lettuce and it could make him explode.  (not literally)  ...but it isn't great for him.|`|izQn53q2aa	yeah, but, it doesn't have any vitamins, there are other types of lettuce that would actually be good for the hamster such as Romanin|`|Ya8SWdysaa	Yes, but it has little or no nutrition and can cause poop issues, like the other person said.|`|krqfJViEaa	Yeah you can along with other various fruits and vegetable. But make sure you only feed him/her a small portion once a week. You can give it to him/her as a treat also if she/he likes.|`|R1U4uGC3aa	yep
ErNNjUdjaa	That's yucky, but it definitely is true that he did switch his bathroom area to the wheel.    Well getting toys would help out but it will never suffice to a wheel. Because hamsters get so much exercise off of there wheels. I would just get a couple of toys for your little buddy like maybe the little edible houses, the little cars that they sell for your hamster to live in, or you can even make your own toys. Like take a string and just tie a big old knot at the bottom of it, usually rodents love that!    For the wheel I would take it out for a couple of weeks so that he can reselect a new potty spot and then once he has selected another spot, put the wheel back in and see if he goes back to peeing on the wheel.    I hope that I helped you!|`|aqarrEGIaa	My dwarf hamster does the same thing.    you shouldn't try to replace toys with its wheel though.  they love to run and stuff and there's nothing really other than a wheel   to replace their source of exercise.  unless you take him out every now and then and put him in a ball.  i wouldn't recommend it though it could be stressful for them.    what you can do is buy those cage cleaning wipes and every other day wipe/clean the wheel.  i wouldn't clean the whole cage with the wipes as it would take many of them, i would stick to water and soap for the whole cage.    lmao  :D|`|HOedKyX2aa	lol I had the same problem.. within hours of her wheel being cleaned it would be puddled with pee again, she would also put all her bedding in it!    Tunnels, they love tunnels!|`|Ya8SWdysaa	Get him a hamster litter box, they put natural chemicals so they urine in it automatically. They're also easy to clean.And buy a new wheel,   1. It's gross and covered in urine.  2. He wont automatically pee on it    http://www.thefind.com/pets/info-hamster...
1tOr2qLAaa	With all the symptoms you describe  he must have had some physical problem, not being a vet I am not going to guess. I think you took very good care of him, I don't think he would have died from grief with everything that went on. I am very sorry you lost your little friend, please know you did everything for him.  I would think that the vets diagnosis is probably very close to it. With little birds it is often difficult to tell what exactly is wrong with them.|`|EJpiaCMQaa	The diagnosis sounds accurate the vet made.  Inner ear problems can cause the bird to become very unsteady and lose control of moving his head.  If you'd like, you can have the vet do a necropsy so you know exactly what the bird died of.    Sorry for your loss.|`|6KxBqnstaa	Sounds to me like he had either a lead or zinc toxicity problem. Can get from water, toys or coating on cage. Could have also been something inhaled as many things can be dangerous and toxic to birds. To hard to say for sure as it could have been so many things. So sorry you lost your bird it is so hard and sad I have been there. Mourn his death but celebrate his life sounds as if you gave him a good one. :)

Apisf1gAaa	This isn't exactly the place to be asking for shells.  Try Hermit Crab sites like landhermitcrabs.com and hermitcrabassociation.com.  You can also try to buy shells from your local craft store, like Michael's. They sell lots of small shells for cheap.  And I know this isn't free, but there are plenty of sites online for you to buy shells from, like e-bay, naplesseashellcompany.com, thecrabbagepatch.com and elsshells.com.
izQn53q2aa	well it would be nice for the animals to have a place to run, but if she takes them to a place such as a dog park or for walks, then the animals should be just fine.  Dogs really just need love, a place to sleep, food and a place to go potty.|`|eF6HTt0gaa	No your not wrong, most cities only let you have one or 2 pets depending on living area size. I just hope no one calls Animal services about all her animals and she has to give one up. As for the kittens put up notices in your local grocery, laundromat and so on to let people know you will only give the kittens to good homes once the vet gives the OK. There are always plenty of people who want a kitten, I would ask for references as to how good of an owner they might be just so you know that they arnt shady or anything and might hurt the animal eventually.
rKuDDohDaa	It could be your water, do some tests.<br>  If he has just moved into his new home he might be a little stressed out and might not eat...<br>  He could have a disease so check his breathing + any fin rot etc.<br>  <br>  Go on bettatalk.com<br>  to check out any symptoms and there is a lot of help on keeping bettas on there.<br>  <br>  Hope he gets better and good luck!|`|277f88461e1df8f316c52c480977aaa6aa	He might not be hungry.  fish can go for days without eating.  in the wild they have to rely on bugs they find. they don't eat every day.|`|Z5sKsrBFaa	If you just got him a few days ago, he could still be adjusting to the new environment.

It is the best kind of exercise because you are bonding and the bird is getting exercise. Try teaching it tricks and let it walk around.|`|7jyXdz2Yaa	i've had cockatiels before, and i can say that some exercise is pretty important for them to be healthy. you should try to let them out every day or every few days, to fly around or walk around. my one cockatiel liked to pick up small objects in her beak and throw them around on the table. what your birds like to do depends on their personalities. but you should definitely open the cage often to let them out.  be careful when you let your birds out of the cage, because it can be dangerous. close window shades so the birds dont crash into them, turn off ceiling fans, etc. if you leave the cage door open the birds will usually come back in when they get tired of exercising. its a good idea to try to keep them in one room, like the kitchen, where you can watch them, they'll be safe, and won't poop on carpet or anything.|`|Vl2Z390Eaa	yes,   cockatiels need exercise to be healthy and have a longer life. let them out to fly iver few days if not everyday. cockatiels are parrots and they dont get all their exercise from flying unlike finches and other birds. they get a lot of their exercise climbing around on the cage and walking or playing with toys
lZboLipvaa	I have a Tibetan, one of the ladies at the dog park has a Havanese.  Havanese are smaller dogs with smaller bladders -- which makes them harder to potty train.     My Tibetan loves children, but I think that neither can tolerate bad behavior like pulling hair.  Neither shed.  Both have hair, not fur which is tough to maintain.

YhH0PNupaa	Keep food and water available at all times. It's easier that way and they can eat when they want. Also, I have found that if they stay full, they eat less, sounds weird, but it's true. Layena is a good layer if you have hens at laying age. Great info can be found about everything chicken at backyardchickens.com|`|J1F3SRJsaa	Here try this - lionsgrip.com/chickens|`|s3tY5YzIaa	I feed my chickens Purina Brand Pellets called Layena. Its about 10 bucks for a 50 pound bag.     You can get chicken feed at any local feed store like Agway, Nistles, and other feed places. Usually anywhere that sells horse or cow grain also carries chicken grain.     :) I feed them 2 large coffee cans in the morning, for 5 hens, and it usually lasts them all day, gets em laying too ;)    good luck. chickens are a joy to have.
9f97f8a980cb5aa7360577720efbdd70aa	If the bird seems incapacitated and cannot fly away on it's own right away, you can place it in a shoebox and keep in a quiet warm place for about 60 minutes to let it recuperate.  This will keep it from getting eaten by a predator as well. If after this time it still cannot fly or still seems disoriented, you need to get the bird to a local wildlife reahab:   http://www.tc.umn.edu/~devo0028/contact....  This bird crashed into your window because it could not tell there was a barrier there..you need to place something on or in front of your windows to keep birds from crashing into them.  Decals such as these work well:  http://www.windowalert.com/  Or keep your curtains closed or shades drawn.|`|kZ9TTWZ9aa	Very Simple. Clean it up.|`|AA10097817	Just leave it alone. It can fend for itself.|`|enC9TvxUaa	-It is stunned, possibly hurt.  If there is no harm form cats/dogs/insects, then leave it alone.  You should put something on the glass of the window so he and other birs know there is glass there- some sort of sun-catcher maybe.|`|6KxBqnstaa	Seeing as it is up I would just watch it from afar and make sure no predators come around. It is stunned and will regain its composure in a few hours. I would put some food and water close by so it can get to it. Don't want it to try to fly yet as it will crash again. If you see it is not doing well can bring in and put in a dim lit room in cage or box and keep very warm and offer food and water until gains its composure again. If still does not seem right then call a wildlife rehabber in area and bring there or to a vet that sees injured wildlife. Sometimes head trauma can take awhile to heal. Free for all wildlife. To ward off birds crashing into windows can buy nice decals that are frosted at Dr's. Foster and Smith online or in book they are cheap and work great. Look nice to. Good luck and nice of you to help the little critter. :)|`|LfNaScTJaa	At the moment , the bird is probably in shock.  More than likely "Stunned)  If you do try to catch it, use a towel to throw over the top of it and then put it in a warm ( not hot ) place. Box or cage. Check it over to see if there is any visible damage. In about an hour or so, it might surprise you and be jumping around and alert. Keep the bird in a confined place so if it does get active you won't have to chase it all over your house trying to catch it. Hopefully all will be well in an hour or so. Good luck. Make sure you give it a shallow bowl of water so it won't dehydrate. Not knowing what type of bird it is makes it hard to let you know what type of feed it would need. We can only give one answer on this question. Once it is submitted we can't give any follow up.|`|UictPrl5aa	wild bird, just leave it alone. it happens sometimes they make it sometimes they dont, only thing you can do is let him be.|`|bRK08EFBaa	It would be better if you just left it alone and let nature take its course.|`|s3tY5YzIaa	Usually i will put them in one of those brown grocery paper bags on my porch and then when they are ready they can fly outttttttt :D

J5hsCONRaa	I was thinking this recently. I think the "film world" has realised just how many people like dogs, not just own them, and so are exploiting this fact! I remember a few years ago, a load of films about cars/drag racing etc all came out within 6 months of each other. Its like one film is a big hit so all other producers and such "hook" onto it and so then all their films came out together.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, they are still to produce a "realistic" dog film which promotes training, exercise and a good diet! They merely create fads ("Where can I get a Marley dog?" "I wanna puppy like the one in.....how can i convince my parents?") and an increase in badly bred dogs.<br>  <br>  And yep, the films are aimed at kids - and in todays "I want" society, parents give in to the excessive pleading as the dog in the film was "so well-behaved, the puppy we get will be the same" as apparently, its too hard to say No to kids these days!!!|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	And unfortunately, these movies will simply "humanize" people's perception of dogs.  More fuel for the ARistas.|`|2G6b5y8Taa	its more for children with a imaginations|`|Hwybmzg5aa	i know it is crazy|`|eyZhiXYpaa	Hmmm, I know what you mean.<br>  <br>  The dog food involved will probably be ones of those hypocritical ones that test their ingredients on dogs in invasive muscle incision techniques.<br>  <br>  I hate how dogs are overly sensationalized in this way - this makes children think dogs are cosmetic (like a hand bag).|`|AA10029366	The sad fact is this crap sells. I agree that it reinforces the "dog-as-people" mentality that fuels the fire for AR-types and -- what's worse -- instills the idea into children.<br>  <br>  As long as you can merchandise it, and McDonalds will put it in their Happy Meals, Disney and its ilk will keep whoring out dogs.|`|GSf09ALBaa	What bothers me is all the people who will go 'buy' a Chi and/or Labrador just like it happened with the 101 Dalmatians.

muPiBQ3Uaa	There is no "certification" legally required. Sadly, there are also no "standards" to which a dog has to comply to in order to be considered a service dog, except for that the dog must be individually trained to mitigate the effects of a life limiting disability for the person who will be handling the dog, which is: being able to do the tasks or work needed by the disabled person.<br>   But first, the basics of training: well behaved, no relieving except on command, well socialized to people as well as surroundings, simple obedience (sit, stay, come, leave it, down, etc.) plus some more need to be instilled before even the most rudimentary service training work can be taught. A lot of trainers like to have the CGC (Canine Good Citizen) training done, as this can weed out some dogs who are not quite fit for strenuous service work.<br>   Most professional service dog providers have a "puppy raising" program where the dogs are bred by the provider, raised by volunteer puppy raisers until around 18 to 24 months of age, then returned to the provider school for intensive service training. The puppy raiser teaches the basics listed above, and the professional trainer at the provider school finishes with the task and work training.<br>  Every service dog needs to be trained to the individual that it will be working with, so there is a wide variety of work and tasks that can be taught, and the learning never stops even after the dog and human have been partnered for years. My wifes Guide is still learning new things (as is my wife), and they have such good fun partnering together everywhere they go. And I even learn a few new things along the way as well.|`|Bw18seFqaa	there is no actual certification.<br>  <br>  It would be quite easy for someone to fasly pass their dog off as a service dog (however should any legal issues arise, for example, the dog bit someone, the person would have to proove the dog is a service dog!)<br>  <br>  Legally tho, all you need is to be disabled, and the dog has to be trained to perform a task or function to assist with your disability.  When in public, you are not required to show any proof or certification..  legally the dog does not even "have" to have a vest (although it helps)..  all the store is allowed to ask is "Is this a service dog".. they cannot ask you information about your disability.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  In general tho, the dog is first raised.. it must be properly socialized, learn basic obedience, house manners, etc.<br>  <br>  It goes thru tests when its about a year old to assess that the dog is confident, and not fearful in new situations..   the dog may also be evaluated for health (hip checks etc).<br>  <br>  The dog then goes thru formal training, which can take up to 2 years, depending on what the dog is being trained for...  the dog is given field trials with a handler and another instructor to assure that the training was successful.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  However, a person can also train their dog themselves.. or hire a private trainer..  you dont have to go thru a facility to obtain a service animal.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  There's no particular breed..  I know of a facility that uses Standard Poodles, Labs, German Shepherds, Goldens, Dobermans, Boxers and Vizslas for guide dogs.<br>  <br>  Size of dog is not always important either, depending on what the dog is being trained for..  small and large dogs may be used for seizure alert/assist and for the hearing impaired.  Larger breeds are preferred for seeing eye and also dogs trained to provide stability for someone with mobility problems.|`|n4pNNcGfaa	Under federal law there is no such thing as a certified service dog.  Individual programs may choose to certify the dogs they produce, but that certification means little but that the program will stand behind their dog.<br>  <br>  Some states require certification, but since most people covered under state law would also be covered under federal, there isn't much point.  I collect laws, including state laws.  I think at one point or another I've read the laws for all 50 states regarding service animals.  I do not recall a single state that spelled out that there should be a standardized test or what that test might be.  In California, guide dogs are required to be trained and certified by a program recognized by the state.  Other than that, states that do require certification sort of vaguely say it should be done by "a recognized program," yet they have no system for recognizing programs.<br>  <br>  Legally, a dog is considered a service dog when it is trained to perform tasks that mitigate the disability of an owner who is legally disabled.  Legal disability is somewhat different from medical disability.  Additionally, if the dog is to be used in public, the public has a right to expect a certain standard of behavior.  If the dog fails to exhibit that behavior, it can legally be excluded.  The dog must be fully toilet trained, must not interfere with other patrons including soliciting attention, must not be disruptive (say by barking), must be under control, and must not exhibit any aggressive behavior.<br>  <br>  ----edit----<br>  <br>  A CGC test is not a "must."  It is a test of good manners for pet dogs, not for service dogs.  While all service dogs should be fully capable of sailing through a CGC with top marks, they are not required to do so.  Passing a CGC does not make them service dogs and it does not count as a public access test.<br>  <br>  The TDI test is for therapy dogs, not service dogs.  It takes eight weeks to train a therapy dog and 18 months to train a service dog.  Big difference.<br>  <br>  Assistance Dogs International has published their minimum standards for a public access test.  This test is generally considered within the service dog community to be an inadequate test of service dogs because it doesn't cover commonly encountered situations.<br>  <a href="http://www.assistancedogsinternational.org/publicaccesstest.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.assistancedogsinternational.o...</a><br>  <br>  This test, or something harder, is required of all dogs certified by an ADI organization.  Not all organizations are ADI organizations.  Other programs and organizations have their own public access tests.  This is the only one that is published for others to see.|`|dZ3B2vNIaa	Dogs need to be tested before entering training classes.  They need to be energetic, fairly large, eager to please, and not fatigue of anything.  They need to be officially certified by the state to go through training classes and become service dogs. And they need to be at least 10 weeks of age to do that.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Passing the CGC is the first step.  After that they need to pass a public access test.  That test will test how they'll react in public places, like stores, restaurants ect, ect.<br>  <br>  So that's where you start with all service dogs.<br>  <br>  And no, not all dogs are "bred" for it.  Many are and are raised by puppy raisers until they're a certain age, but many rescue dogs have become service dogs too.<br>  <br>  And no, there's no certain breed the dog HAS to be.  The dog dog does have to be non aggressive and most service dog trainers will gravitate towards labs, goldens and GSD's because these dogs love to please people but ... they don't HAVE to be any certain breed.<br>  <br>  And there are to certification tests for the dogs.  What there isn't is certifications for the people training these dogs.  Anyone can call themsevles a service dog trainer.  There's no regulating body for that.  There are no tests service dog trainers have to pass.|`|y2nC8BUGaa	They go through a lot of training.  I see them all over town around here in training.  They walk them through malls and around lots of people and teach them not to be distracted by everything going on and all the signals they're supposed to know.  <br>  <br>  The people who train them are pretty rude to other people sometimes though.  They don't clean up after the dogs when they have an accident.|`|0747fea6c45bf75b7874aeb315e68a95aa	According to the Department of Justice, ANY dog that has been individually trained to perform tasks or do work that mitigates the disability of a person who meets the ADA criteria for being disabled is considered a service dog. <br>  <br>  The criteria that must be met are that the handler be disabled under the law and the dog must be specifically trained to do mitigating work. No certification is required, but in case of a challenge in court, the handler would have to prove both disability status and that the dog was trained at the time of the challenge to perform tasks or do work that mitigated the qualifying disability.<br>  <br>  These are the only requirements for a dog to be considered a service dog under federal law. Many states have laws that extend additional protections or rights concerning service dogs, and some of these states limit their protection to dogs that have been registered or certified through state, local or private programs,or that have graduated from particular schools. Other states simply mirror the ADA language. In states that specify different criteria, only dogs that meet the state criteria are protected under state law. Other teams would have to rely on federal law.<br>  <br>  That being said, everything that melissa said regarding temperament, obedience, and public access training is true if the person with the disability is going to have an effective service dog. A dog that is distractable or frightened is not going to be able to work well, and so will be unable to effectively function as a service dog, especially  in public. People who actually use their dogs to assist them in public generally recognize this and go to great lengths to ensure that their dogs meet the criteria melissa mentioned.|`|AA11830350	For a dog to be appropriate to be a service dog they need:<br>  -To be trained and demonstrate an advance level of mastery of all basic obedience commands. The dog must be able to maintain a calm, quiet demeanor while responding to commands in an extremely wide variety of environments and ignore distraction like other animals, running/screaming kids, people making stupid noises, etc. The dog also must be TRAINED to perform tasks that mitigate the handler's disability. Service Dogs have no right under the laws, people do. No matter what a dog does if it not working for a person with a disability, it has no more right to be in public than your average pet.<br>  As someone with a disability wanting to train a dog to be a service dog they must:<br>  -Be trained only to eliminate in areas designated by the handler and on cue.<br>  -Have no history of fear biting or aggression to people or other animals<br>  -Show minimal startle reflex when scared and look to the handle for direction in those few situations.<br>  -have their prey drive in check. A dog constantly wanting to chase cars, cats, birds, etc. will never be reliable in public. This is one reason dogs are dropped from programs.<br>  -Like people.<br>  -Be able to adjust their energy levels to the handler and various environments.<br>  -Willing to repeats the same cue many times in a row.<br>  -Enjoy working<br>  -Enjoy learning new tasks<br>  -Willing to continue working and problem solving to accomplish the task at hand.<br>  Now how does one help the dog gain the skills and experience needed: whether choosing a young dog 1-2 years old or a puppy it advisable to work with someone very experience with choosing candidates for this kind of work.If you have a young dog who cannot pass the noise, strange dog, strange people, three minute seperation, or grooming sections of the CGC given by a completely unknown person in an unknown place. They will never be a good service, in fact, it would be a cruel thing to ask of such a dog. After passing the CGC the dog and handler must pass the Public Access Test and be able to demonstrate the tasks it has been trained to perform to mitigate their handler's disability.<br>  Classes that can help dog and handler reach the appropriate advance levels of training include:<br>  -Puppy Kindergarten<br>  -Obedience<br>  -Rally Obedience- this one is good because teams are mark for obstacle performance and the relationship displayed.<br>  -Agility<br>  -Trick Classes<br>  All dogs need to be solid in all obedience to an advance level before working in public. Socialization outing should be short and focused on giving the dog/pup a positive experience in a given environment not doing your errands.

She's a puppy, so brush her for only a couple of minutes, then give her a break to tell her what a good girl she is, give her a treat, then brush some more.  Puppies need to be taught how to be groomed liked they do everything else, so make it a good experience for her now so she'll enjoy it throughout her life.  I've never had a dog in over 30 years who didn't love the one-on-one time spent during the grooming session.|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	Just go ahead and brush.

If she has the coat that needs to be brushed on a regular basis you need to stop this biting behavior.  Look at like you have this job to do (brushing her) & you are not going to let any of her little antics stop you from doing it.  She will have a life time of brushing & you need to get her to where she will accept being brushed.  Just don't wait to brush her so her cost doesn't mat up.  Brushing out mats hurts her so you need to brush her enough so that it is like second nature for you.<br>  <br>  You just need to condition her & your self to this.|`|rumYVkDsaa	I had such a hard time with my girl that i kinda gave in.

AQsiugSpaa	Hi there,<br>  <br>  First of all the most important thing for you to do is to learn about feline behavior and why they do what they do. Additionally he is a kitten who is curious and eager to play. You say that your kitten knows he is misbehaving but that is not true. He is scared of you, and that is why he jumps down and runs away from you. Yelling at a cat, who has extremely sensitive hearing is painful to them. No wonder he runs away.<br>  <br>  First of all, cats are attracted to high places. They are not floor pets like dogs!  If you supplied your cat with a nice high cat tree with shelves and hiding places, he would be attracted to that. <br>  <br>  Cats usually like countertops in the kitchen because no matter how you clean it, the cat's incredible sense of smell can detect the slightest remains of food odors, so are looking for a "snack", even though he is well fed as you say. Countertops are where folks prepare food, so - kitty checks it out!<br>  <br>  Since he is doing this when you go to bed, he probably wants more attention from you. After all , you must remember that he is a kitten.. much like a three year old child. I suggest you play strenuously with him prior to bed-time, give him a midnight snack, and he will probably sleep through the night on his full tummy. <br>  <br>  <br>  For an excellent article to help you with your issue visit:<br>  <a href="http://cats.about.com/cs/behavioralissues/a/counter_surfing.htm" rel="nofollow">http://cats.about.com/cs/behavioralissue...</a><br>  <br>  Additionally I suggest that you buy a book on feline behavior so that you and your cat can be speaking the same language. One of the best ones that I found, which is available at amazon.com is, "Think Like a Cat- How to Raise a Well -Adjusted Cat, Not a Sour Puss" by Pam Johnson- Bennett<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Think-Like-Cat-Well-Adjusted-Cat-Not/dp/0140288546" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Think-Like-Cat-Wel...</a><br>  <br>  The author gives fabulous advice on all kinds of cat related "problems." which will make your life a lot easier, as well as your cat's.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps,<br>  And please don't be frustrated with your kitten.<br>  <br>  Troublesniffer<br>  Owned by cats for over 40 years<br>  Member Cat Writer's Association|`|DtkLsetkaa	Closing him off of the kitchen isn't going to solve the problem, he will still think he's allowed up on counters.  I have tried (give or take) about 400 methods and have yet to have success.  One thing that worked for a little bit was putting tin foil on top of the counter, just laying it out like you are baking cookies.  The cats don't like the feel and won't want to step on it.  Mine however, decided "oh shiny new toy!!" and would pull it off the counter and play with it.  Other suggestions I have heard are lemony spray (something non toxic) the cats don't like the smell of it, and it makes your kitchen smell yummy and fresh.  Also the soda cans is a good one.  Sometimes the noise scares them.  Spraying does nothing unless you catch them in the act, and unless you stare into your kitchen all day, not much luck with that.  Good luck to you man, I hope you solve this.|`|gU34xa9vaa	I can't see why he has to be locked in your bedroom with no food, water or litter ? Why can't he have those with him ? Is he an indoor cat ? He's probably bored out of his skull poor creature.He needs a scratching post, catnip toys, and some kitty grass at the very least.<br>  You say he runs when he hears you, yes because he is now nervous of you, you need to be very gentle and patient with cats, talk to him, say his name a lot, also play with him before bedtime to tire him out.Your reward will be his good behaviour.|`|SnanuNKiaa	you can try using foil wrap shiny side up. they don't like that, but if it doesn't work, get some lemons and spray the juice on the counter and the edges of the counter particularly. they can't stand citrus smells.|`|386524142680a3e18e5b2498e17e6041aa	Did you try setting some mouse traps in different places on the counter then gently lay newspaper over the traps.

It is in their nature!  Someone said use some common sense, which is a very good idea (in Aisle 3 at Walmart) but failing that you could always put him in your room with a litter tray food and water.  Sounds like a playful little soul to me who is setting out on this great adventure called Life! There are sensible ways around everything just think outside the box (not the litter one) a bit and the answer will be there GOOD LUCK|`|5vg46uiVaa	I read somewhere that if you crinkle up aluminum foil and flatten it back out and set it on the counter, when the cat jumps up there, he'll hate how it sounds and feels and won't do it again.

Their lives are very short in comparison to ours, how will you feel if your cat dies young and has spent long lonely nights in the basement, just for being a cat and doing what cats do ? <br>  I treasure every moment with my cats !

They hate tin foil, my cat eats it. Anyway try Ssscat. It's a motion activated sprayer. It's not harmful and works great! It sprays a vapor or something not water. My cat no longer goes on the counters. Good luck!

97cea69af418b36fa64d887915f51776aa	You have way too many fish in that small tank. The best thing you need to do before buying medicine is to gradually raise the temperature to 80 degrees Fahrenheit/ 27 degrees Celsius. and add some aquarium salt. <br>  Here's a website that tells you everything about ick from the causes, preventions all the way to the treatment:<br>  <a href="http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?c=16+2160&aid=2421" rel="nofollow">http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?...</a><br>  <br>  As a fish breeder i would recommend you to not move them to the 55 gallon otherwise now you would have to deal with treating two tanks rather then one and that's going to increase the chance of your from dieing. since some of your fish and snail are sensity to the med, you just have the use half of the dose recommended (meaning it's going to take a while to heal them all but that's better than infecting two tanks and stress the life out of them). I have dealt with ick several time and once a fish has it, know that every fish in that tank has it wether they show signs of it or not.|`|499ce2344d684feb00ec06bcf55edd71aa	That tank is really on the small side for just one betta. It sounds like you have a betta and at least 2 tetras, a snail, and an idea of adding more? <br>  <br>  Ich is usually caused by overcrowding and poor water quality. This tank is drastically overcrowded. Because of that, and the fact that this is a new tank, I bet the ammonia levels are quite high. <br>  <br>  You need to at least double the size of that tank for what you have or you have a very high chance of all of them not living very long.|`|65baadde1a27b20964ccb07ad83092e0aa	Yeas it is ich.  The reason you might not be able to get rid of it is because you are not treating for long enough. It can take 14 or more days to rid a tank of ich. You should do water changes every other day before treating the tank.  <br>  <br>  here to treat ich you need to fully understand what it is you are dealing with. <br>  <a href="http://www.novalek.com/kordon/articles/ich.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.novalek.com/kordon/articles/i...</a><br>  <br>  ps. just because you don't see it does not mean they don't have it. It hinds in the nose and gills of the fish.|`|bqrKVBqVaa	Yes!  I second Junie's emotion.  <br>  <br>  You should NOT have peaceful fish like neons with the betta, he will kill them.  I know because my girlfriend made the same mistake.  Betta's need to be alone.  And he will also eat your baby guppies too!<br>  <br>  As for your ich problem -- Quick Cure.  It's cheap, it's effective, and you can get it at Walmart.  If you don't want to treat the whole tank, then set up a temporary quarantine tank and treat them there.  <br>  <br>  By the way, that's what you should have done to begin with.  You don't just put new fish in your tank.  You have to treat them in a seperate quarantine tank so they don't infect your other fish, or gravel in your main tank.<br>  <br>  My advice, isolate the betta and use Quick Cure on the sick fish, preferably in a seperate quarantine tank.  It doesn't have to be fancy, a bucket will do for a few days.  Remember to use proper airation (air stone) and heating.<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  - Roy|`|2IhKJjY1aa	I also use Quick Cure.  It worked for me.  It even help with sores.  My one molly had a sore on her one side fin and it cleared up in less than a week.|`|Z5sKsrBFaa	I use Quick Cure.  It has always worked for me and it didn't bother my neons.  One question though, are you going to breed the guppies in the tank with the betta in it?  The betta will attack them if they are fancy-tails and will eat the babies.

If this isn;t possible, I once bought this play pen type thing for my hamster and it basically allowed him to be out his cage and with all the toys that wouldn;t fit in his cage without being at risk of getting lost.

yE2vM76naa	With a heater and a filter, a betta would be "oh-so-happy" in a tank like that - he would literally dance a jig - you could throw in a couple shrimp (ghost or cherry) or a nerite snail and have a great little tank|`|2IhKJjY1aa	How about guppies?|`|499ce2344d684feb00ec06bcf55edd71aa	As long as it is filtered and heated, you can get a betta.

Z5sKsrBFaa	I've been breeding betta fish for a few years now and I can help you with you questions.<br>  <br>  1. I usually separate all the babies into jars as soon as I can catch them just to make sure I didn't leave 2 males in with the females, and it also helps keep track of individual health.<br>  <br>  2. I usually keep then in the warmest room of the house and place a thermometer in a few of the jars to Monitor the temperature, if it gets too low I turn on a space heater to warm the room up a bit more.<br>  <br>  3. I usually wait until the female is swollen with eggs before I put her in the same tank as the male. I've never seen the females display like that. Also, the male could mistake her fro another male and be flaring up to intimidate her.<br>  <br>  4. Yes keep them separate and once it is over with remove both from the tank or the male will kill the female and eat the eggs.<br>  <br>  5. I've already answered this in #3<br>  <br>  6. Yes it is normal for a male to create more than one nest.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and good luck!|`|bIh5ZFwIaa	1# as soon as you can sex them<br>  <br>  2# you could either lay them out in an existing tank with water around them which is warmed by a heater, then that will heat the jars<br>  <br>  3# make sure the male has already blown a bubble nest, with the female in a jar inside the males tank, he will be able to see her then, and release her when she and he is ready<br>  <br>  4# think i explained that above :/<br>  <br>  5# every betta is different, maybe she is too young/old?<br>  <br>  6# the bubble nest should be really big, under a leaf from ebay if possible or under half a polystyrene cup<br>  <br>  hope i helped, if i don't make Sense, email meor if you need any thing else then mail me :)

YFTZM86maa	[edit] Anglerfish<br>  After Dory dropped P. Sherman's diving mask, both she and Marlin venture into a deep-sea trench in order to search for it. Marlin and Dory were in complete darkness, only to be entranced by a soft blue light, which turned out to be the lure of a vicious deep-sea anglerfish. Marlin uses its lure to give Dory the light needed to read the writing on the strap of the mask. After the credits roll, there's a scene where Blenny swims in the darkness before a light appears, a few moments later the angler fish appears out of the dark, only to be eaten by Blenny.|`|FtVfuByHaa	In my opinion it is a fish from the Tetraodontidae family of primarily marine and estuarine fish. The most common species of this family are puffers, balloonfish, blowfish, bubblefish, globefish, swellfish, toadfish, and toadies, so i would say it has to be one of them because this is the closest type of fish matching to its outer appearance. I hope this helped =D|`|qW2ZG1NHaa	It is an Angler. Not sure the of the exact type. They are named Anglers because they literally fish for food. Just like in the movie, they dangle their  'lure" in front of their mouths to draw in fish that plan to eat the wriggling worm, and then snap!!<br>   The one in the movie is a deep sea angler which is why it uses the light. Frog, and toad fish are also anglers i believe. They live in shallower waters around reefs and so do not use the light approach.|`|dD08pRIwaa	That is an angler fish.
STs2ouqRaa	I have a cat that does the same thing, and he's done it pretty much since I brought him home as a baby kitten. The nearest I can figure with him is that the mother cat stopped taking care of the babies and it's a comfort thing, like a substitute mother. If your cat's been doing it their whole life I'd say it might be something similar. My boyfriend calls it his sex blankie because it looks like he's groping and kissing the blanket lol.

I'm going to keep an eye on this question though because I'm interested to see if anyone has a good explanation.|`|G032Flc3aa	You don't know much about cats mate, I'd say more than 90% of cats do this at some time, it's harmless and makes them remember their kittenhood with their mothers before they were parted from her.

PetSmart trainers are sometimes morons that will put little Yorkie puppies into puppy classes with Great Dane puppies - which, yea, probably not a good idea.  You want to make sure there will be at least one other pup that will be similar in size to your pup.  Because, at the end of class.  The puppies will get play.  Unless there's noone their size to play with.  Then they have to sit out.  :(|`|B95Jmf9naa	We had our puppy in a beginner class (she was 5 months old) , and I was very happy with it.

I was less than impressed as they had very young dogs doing 30 second sit stays with the handler removed across the ring.  That is just way too advanced for such young pooches.<br>  <br>  But a puppy class would probably be just fine, and I am sure that there are some good petsmart trainers.  You may want to see if there is a dog obedience club in your area, and check them out.|`|AA12083992	Depends on your dog. If you have a socialized, easy to handle dog. they are okay. They are not for dogs that have a tendency to be aggressive or hard to handle.
t85b6QMiaa	That's odd. As far as I know, Oscar Cichlid is a very good parent that will take a good care for their eggs and young fry. They are also very productive. <br>  <br>  Is it possible that your Oscar have realized that the egg was "dead" or unfertilized and decided its better to eat it? And as I know, the mother won't lays all the eggs in one go. It maybe the first batch of a thousand eggs (yes, she's able to lay that much).|`|Z5sKsrBFaa	If he ate it, then its gone.
n8jrLDblaa	You don't need the damn Dog Whisperer...you need training and exercise.<br>  <br>  When a dog (especially high-energy terrier breeds) do not get enough exercise, that excess energy can and does become destructive.<br>  <br>  Your first step, quite obviously, is to dog-proof the home. Lock the garbage up where the dog can't get to it. Don't place potted plants on the floor, etc. If they aren't there, they can't be chewed. Anything not movable should be doused with bitter apple to deter chewing.<br>  <br>  Ever owned a terrier before? They need TONS of physical and mental stimulation. Increase exercise. Stimulate the dog mentally by providing obedience training, going over commands daily, or getting involved in sport. This is managable..you have the power to correct it.|`|cnZlMojUaa	The chewing is a big issue. She eats the wrong plant, or chews an electric cord it could be deadly. Put up anything you don't want her in. Spray bitter apple on all cords, table legs, etc. that you can't put away. You need to watch her constantly. When you can't, crate her. Get an inexpensive spray bottle, fill it with water, and spritz her face when she misbehaves. This will help with the counter and table jumping. Keeping her on an umbilical leash (one end hooked to her collar, the other to your belt loop) will let you constantly watch her.<br>  <br>  Have lots of appropriate toys for her. When she chews the wrong thing, use an appropriate toy to redirect her attention. Make sure you teach her "Drop It", "Take It", and "Leave It." Chewers tend to chew whatever they can get their mouths on. They have to be taught what is appropriate and what isn't. I couldn't scold my little dog when she trotted through the house with my fuzzy bedroom slipper--it looked like a toy to her. I could tell her to drop it, then gave her an appropriate toy, and put the slippers where she couldn't get them. The black Kong extreme toys and the power chewer Nylabones are good toys for for chewers.<br>  <br>  If you haven't done a basic obedience class, you might want to look into this. She needs direction, and lots of exercise. Jack Russells can be hyper little dogs. Working with her is so important. You need to exercise both her body and mind--Jacks are smart dogs. The training will be a wonderful bonding time for you both. Remember, Hayley is just waiting for you to mold her into the perfect dog. You can do it!|`|XavY3fiWaa	You have to keep her busy so shes not trying to chew on stuff.  Try dog toys with food inside of them, and get all different dog toys that you know your dog will be interested in, that might keep her busy so shes not wanting to chew on everything.  Jack russels are high energy dogs so take her for lots of walks too and take her to the dog park so she can run for a while.  If that doesn't work than you may have to find a dog trainer, or put her in some obedience classes.|`|hwxeQCdDaa	I like the nick name " Haley the Destroyer"  I call my pup WMD. Weimararer of Mass Destruction"<br>  <br>  Sounds like separation anxiety to me. Make sure they get lots of exercise and basically don't make a big deal out of leaving or coming home. Our older Weim had this problem but with some work we can leave him alone in the house without problem now. Good luck. If you search separation anxiety you will get lots of good training tips.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Have you taken the dog to a basic obedience class?<br>  <br>  My guess is no.  <br>  <br>  Dogs don't "grow out of" bad behavior.  You have to train them and teach them what you want.  And unlike what you see on tv with the dog whisperer, bad behavior is not cured in 30 mins.  It's cured over months of hard work and training.  So, find a trainer that deals with dogs with behavioral problems and go get a consultation.  Then sign up for whatever classes the trainer recommends.  And plan to spend the next 6 months putting your normal JRT though bootcamp.<br>  <br>  And yes, your JRT is acting like any normal JRT that hasn't been trained would act.|`|J5C3WKxfaa	you really should have researched the breed first, unfortunately she wont grow out of it, jacks are high energy and will run none stop all day.<br>  <br>  she sounds like she is bored, i have 2 jacks and my female sleeps all day but my male doesn't, i will sit for hrs throwing the ball across the lounge for him, i even hide treats around the house for him to find and this keeps hi stimulated.<br>  <br>  jacks also need a lot of exercise i take mine out for 2 hrs in the morn and 2 hrs in the evening.<br>  <br>  when i leave them at home i crate them which isn't often, they are also crated at night. this keeps them safe as they will destroy anything left around INCLUDING wires.<br>  <br>  i would suggest crating her and training her and playing with her more, take her out more often too|`|RehgySLCaa	I spend almost 10 bucks a week on chew toys. If you have not tried that then you have not tried everything
OXA9s57Uaa	Tavis, you need to make sure that before you put anything on him he is completely used to being lunged in the round pen and listens to you. You shouldn't put anything like this on him without him trusting you first and actually trained well in lunging. Give it a few months because he is nowhere near ready for this and neither are you. Just being honest. You have to admit he doesnt listen and is still pretty hard headed lol. yes if you havent guessed it's lauren. right now, putting that on him would be disaster. Also instead or getting a chambon, borrow my martingale.|`|SzW9GmRsaa	Ugh.  If you want a fake horse as stiff as a piece of cardboard, by all means go for it.<br>  <br>  What you have to ask yourself is exactly WHY you want this.  If you're not a good enough rider to achieve the desired results from riding you have no business resorting to ropes and pulleys (or any other "training aid") to get it.  If you are a good enough rider, just get on and ride!<br>  <br>  The best way to school your horse to be consistent under saddle is to ride it.  Gadgets are just that, and they go in and out of fashion.  Good riding will always be the best thing for any horse.|`|UvBK3p9raa	I have not used that particular system, but I do own and use something very similar - it uses no bit.  In my experience, it has helped horses learn to carry themselves correctly and build good musculature.  However, I did feel the need to get help from a trainer to learn to use it; as, I had never used anything like it before. Happy riding!|`|36612d416e7176f5335f2b3fb47cf46caa	I use a very similar one that I got second hand of Ebay for ￡45, it works just as well. I found it good at teaching the horse self carriage and it's good for getting them to really bring their hind end under when working. It also lets you develop the correct muscles on the horse for them to come 'on the bit' correctly.<br>  <br>  I found it really helped our cob to lift in front and lighten on the forehand. Like someone else said, you start with it very loose, use a soft bit and remember it's there as an encouragement, not to tie the head down. Don't overuse anything like this - it's an aid not a quick fix.<br>  <br>  With anything like a chambon or pessoa type system don't use for longer than 1/2 hour at a time cause it's hard work for the horse. You can also use side reins but the advantage of a pessoa type thing is it also encourages the horses butt underneath it|`|iiNAJfGCaa	Do NOT use the Pessoa system. It will crank your horse down into a fake frame, ruin his muscling, and tip him forward onto his forehand. If you are looking for something to help your horse with achieving correct muscling on the lounge I would recommend the Chambon. It is also featured in the article that Krude Kitty linked (LOVE that article and everything on that site, btw) and I have used it on my own thoroughbred with wonderful results. To quote the article: "Out of all of them, the chambon is the only one which really works satisfactorily in its true context - lungeing. The chambon is the only device that lets the horse stretch fully forward-down-OUT." The chambon is relatively inexpensive (you can make it yourself if you know how, or buy it for around $50) and works by leverage on the poll. When the horse tenses and lifts his head he feels weight on his poll. When he relaxes and stretches down through his neck and back the weight releases. The chambon works most successfully when you are driving your horse forward so is has to use his hind end in order to remain balanced when he lowers his head and stretches through his neck and back.|`|ZB0VuKh8aa	There is absolutely nothing wrong with using a pessoa. But like all equipment it needs to be used properly! Also, don't get carried away with the idea that it is the answer to all your training problems, but, yes, they are useful.|`|pfbIm4lEaa	I have to disagree with the others. I have used the Pessoa system and gotten great results. You just have to know what you're doing and not go too far too fast. Put nothing harsher than a rubber snaffle in the horse's mouth. Start with the rig pretty loose and slowly work your way in. The idea is to get the horse's hind end up under him while collecting the front end as well. I like this system because it's designed so the horse isn't pulling against a device, he's pulling against himself. If the hind end and the front end are both balanced, there is no pressure on the horse. We had a mare who was VERY heavy in the front and we used this on her once or twice a week and saw great improvement. So as long as it is USED PROPERLY, I give the Pessoa rig two thumbs up. <br>  <br>  I was under the impression a chambon's purpose was just to lower a horse's head? but I could be wrong . . . I'm not that familiar with it.|`|iz03uvV4aa	Iam sorry I know this isnt an answer to your question - I havent used the Pessoa System BUT I would like to know what issues you're trying to work with, with your horse.<br>  <br>  I just came across a forum that you might find helpful - how to use, what people thought of it etc. These are all people (by the looks of it) that have used it! Here is the link:<br>  <a href="http://www.horseforum.com/horse-tack-equipment/pessoa-training-system-8170/" rel="nofollow">http://www.horseforum.com/horse-tack-equ...</a><br>  <br>  EDIT**<br>  Now that Ive looked at this system Iam not sure Iam a fan :S!  It seems to me that this could get a little over demanding on a horse, its busy, complicated to use and might cause ALOT of further issues in collection if really not utilized properly.  <br>  <br>  Again, perhaps if we knew what issues you were trying to fix, there might be a bit more beneficial way to help your horse along.|`|58410e61549a3fe40d177cf7e71fc875aa	I LOATHE the Pessoa system.

wPod2vbSaa	Paul A has the right idea. I just did this myself.<br>  <br>  I bought a large rubbermaid tote container...one with the highest sides I can find, and because the walls are taller than my cat when he's in there, there's no way for him to accidently poo over the side...or fling the litter either. It was an inexpensive and easy solution. It also helps to clean the litter EVERY day, so kitty's delicate nose doesn't get offended. Sometimes they poo outside of the box just to protest the dirty litter.|`|b8VRlStoaa	My first thought that is if he has already used the box and is unwilling to go where he has already gone before. I had a similar problem with a cat , and basically we had to make sure his poops were removed immediately or shortly after he went.

If not , I would put some news papaer out side the door and just deal with it. Good luck!|`|gjrbp1Aoaa	I agree - get a bigger box.  <br>  I have two regular boxes and it's a wonder most of my cats are able to keep their poop in them at all since the size of the boxes are small compared to many of my cats.  But I also have a large litter box that allows them plenty of room.  I don't think it's supposed to be a litter box at all. Maybe it was for paint, I'm not sure.  Just wander around a store like Home Depot and look for something that could work as a large litter box. What I have is at least as big as two regular litter boxes and the sides are higher. <br>  <br>  One of my cats is 14 lbs too but even some of the smaller cats will poop on the side the box and make a mess outside it when they use the regular boxes. Accidents are really rare with the big one, they fit in it just fine. I should probably replace all the boxes with big ones. :)<br>  good luck!|`|2EY1h3Vxaa	I would say that the box is not clean enough for your cat.  My cat does the exact same thing.  He usually does not behave this way if the box is clean enough though.  I also would leave it uncovered, if your cat is large it is hard for them to move around and away from anything offensive to them with a cover on it.|`|q8nwHwNEaa	I think you should get him a new bigger BOX, the bigger the box the less chances of him messing up.<br>  <br>  Also if you own more then one animal, he may be intimidated because of it.|`|Yr6oHXvVaa	Forget actual litter boxes, go down to walmart and find a plastic tub  with high walls.(dosen't have to be super huge, just one he can fit in but can't stick his butt over) A decent size Rubbermaid tub shouldn't cost more than 10 bux.|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	I've got a 15lb lump and occasionally he misses and occasionally it's down to him kicking it out when he's trying to cover it with kitty litter.

Most species I've seen that are egg layers take longer then 24 hours to begin incubation and hatching.  I have a couple egg laying Madagascars myself, and I can say that the incubation on Pytchochromis Oligocanthus is about 48-60 hours.  The tails are the formation of the fish.  Eventually a head and body will emerge, but still attached to the eggs.  The fry will derive and extract food from the yolk sac until they become free swimming.

zc7xneuOaa	Put the rabbit somewhere else.  The rabbit will be causing the dog stress, that's why she will be crying- she's longing to eat the rabbit.  It's natural for any dog to want to do that.

I take care of my sister's daschund all the time and her crying does get frustrating. You should take her for a walk or let her outside for a while.

PM23RDycaa	Nope and here's why    -From a byb a puppy purebred or mutt should be no more than 100$    -I don't like small dog    - I would only pay 200 for a mutt if it was a shelter pup    - bybs and oops litter more often than not produce unhealthy animals. That 200 can quickly turn into 1000s at the vet    -Reputable breeders don't do that OBO crap or haggle.|`|AA12071655	Since it's not an actual breed all you're really paying for is the care and feeding and hassle of the litter. Ask to see any vet records for the puppies.    Don't get me wrong; mixes like this can be cute and wind up with good personalities, but it's not a breed - it's a mutt.|`|EijzrUn1aa	I would not buy it and support Back Yard Breeders that breed designer dogs just to make a buck when there are hundreds of dogs like it that desperately need homes.|`|rfI3CrwQaa	Check your local shelter and see what their adoption fees are. Personally, I wouldn't pay any more than a regular adoption fee for a mixed breed. Besides that, good breeders often have puppies on the high end of the price scale because they need to cover the cost of breeding. Back yard breeders generally don't have this problem. You get what you pay for.|`|DSzG23WRaa	Same type of dog can probably be found at your local shelter or on Petfinder. Adoption fees are alot less than $200 and you won't be supporting backyard breeders. Check the shelters, I think you'll be surprised.|`|WbRhr0OYaa	Well the only way I would pay 200.00 for a MUTT is if it had been spayed/neutered, utd on shots, dewormed, fecal samples, heartworm tested, bloodwork, etc. If it had not had anything done I wouldn't pay 200 for a MUTT. I payed 100.00 for my mutts but they had all of the above done so I had no problem with the price.|`|XgqwQ7szaa	sure..it's cute, seems playful and energetic.

dmEaKHxpaa	Are you talking about when you are riding your horse?  If it is when you are leading him and he won't go where you want, you can start by doing lateral work.  Instead of going forward, go to the side.  Movement is key.  When movement stops, rearing occurs.  A horse can't rear when they are moving forward with their front legs.  Step to the side of your horse and bring his head to the side.  If you are riding the horse and he rears when you ask him to go in a direction, try going to the side at first.  Most likely, your horse is upset and confused by your riding experience.  I don't mean to offend, but you need to under guidance of an experienced rider.  Horses rear as a last resort, so your horse is confused by your commands.<br>  If you are patient, and try to move laterally for a while (horses prefer to go straight, not in circles), you need to be patient, your horse will start to follow your rein.  You must "give" or relax the rein the second your horse gives back.|`|wanG4pndaa	You may need horse riding classes.
w68p19bNaa	All animals are different so until they're introduced, it's impossible to say how they'll actually get on. It's been my experience that most animals are very skittish around others - whether of another species or their own. However, I've also seen animals that hit it off instantly - again, regardless of what species they are. I owned two dogs and a cat that moved in a pack together and hamsters that tried to tear each other apart. It really depends a lot on the temperament and personality of the animals.<br>  <br>  Your skunk definitely sounds like they could use a companion. I am curious to know why you'd go for a ferret over another skunk. But that aside, whatever pet you want to bring into your home, you should do it during a period of time (like a weekend you don't work) when you can be there and monitor their progress. Animals that seem to be getting along when you first put them together can quickly be attacking each other an hour later. Until you are reasonably sure both animals are comfortable with each other they shouldn't be left alone for very long together.|`|YyiESOpFaa	just try it out, and if it your pet doesn't like the new addition, maybe then find a different home for the ferret.|`|jCeylLsIaa	only if they stink like sewer too|`|OgV94ozgaa	sure i think

So there will be no reproducing of poorly bred pet quality pets.<br>  <br>  Ideally you should get  both dogs championed out & then once they have their championship you breed to another dog that also has champions in their ancestry & has its championship.

cd731a89d8c493e5a2e82406e38dcdb2aa	Wait a sec here. You bought a dog from a breeder that did not give you the registration papers, then you turn around and buy yet another dog from them?<br>  <br>  As for your question...... unless you have some type of hereditary and congenital health guarantee, you probably won't get anywhere with that. Reporting her to the Humane Society might raise a red flag for them to investigate, but.... good luck.<br>  <br>  As far as not getting the papers, the AKC will plainly tell you, you should never have left the greeder's pemises withouth papers in hand, and you are the happy owner of a dog with no papers<br>  <br>  ADD: Pamela D: you do not pay for registration papers, you pay for a pup/dog that is registerable. Papers designated to a litter by the AKC belong to those puppies, not you. You are supposed to mark them Limited if it is to go as a pet pup. <br>  If you advertise whether in text or by mouth AKC pups and you withhold papers all together or charge a fee specifically for the registration papers, your AKC privileges can be permanently suspended.|`|PM23RDycaa	Papers are to be given at the time of purchase unless you signed a contract stating you would not receive your limited registration papers once the animal is spayed.<br>  <br>  As for genetics unless you were given a health guarantee against genetic disorders it is on you to prove they knowingly sold you an animal "unfit for sale"<br>  <br>  Pamela - you do know that the AKC warns consumers against breeders who charge more for the registration papers right? Not providing papers isn't going to stop someone from breeding. If you are so worried about breeding you sell the pups spayed/neutered already or  you sell to people you know will adhere to the spay/neuter contract clause and then send them limited registration papers.|`|AA10029366	LMAO @ Basset!!<br>  <br>  Do you have contracts stating that the puppy is warrantied against genetic defect, and that registration papers will be supplied?<br>  <br>  If not, you have limited options.

You should have purchased the dog with a warranty contract regarding health and registration papers should have been provided when the dog was acquired. <br>  <br>  Your only recourses are:<br>  1. you live in one of the very few states that have puppy lemon laws<br>  2. you have a contractual warranty that protects your rights and you can take the matter to a small claims court.<br>  <br>  From the AKC registry rules:<br>  IV. BUYER PURCHASES A SICK<br>  OR DEFECTIVE DOG<br>  The American Kennel Club is always concerned<br>  when we learn of sick dogs. In situations such as this, it<br>  is vital to seek veterinary care and to inform the breeder<br>  so they can using this knowledge in future breeding<br>  decisions.<br>  The AKC is a strong proponent of research that will<br>  result in healthier, longer lives for all dogs. In 1995, the<br>  AKC established the AKC Canine Health Foundation<br>  and has contributed over $15 million since its founding.<br>  The foundation has helped fund nearly 250 studies.<br>  Some useful information can be found at the AKC<br>  Canine Health Foundation Web site, www.akcchf.org.<br>  Another resource would be the breed club. A parent<br>  club is the national organization designated by the AKC<br>  to represent a specific breed. It may also help to notify<br>  the parent club’s health liaison, as AKC-CHF surveys<br>  the parent clubs every two years to determine the top<br>  health concerns.<br>  If a dog owner is attempting to recover all or part of<br>  the dog’s purchase price and they are unable to settle<br>  with the seller, we recommend that they seek legal counsel<br>  to determine if they can gain relief through civil channels.<br>  It may also help to to contact the Better Business<br>  Bureau or Consumer Protection Services in their area.|`|KvUJZa1Paa	Did you pay for registration papers for other dog?, some breeders do that including myself to keep new owners from breeding puppies. but i also have a spay or neuter contract also that goes along with it.<br>  <br>  But as for other dog could you kindly give more info.|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	You didn't notice that the dog had short legs?|`|AA10400143	do you know what they are reg with?

izQn53q2aa	Well your female dog is in heat.  This will happen about twice a year for approximately 2 weeks each time.  During this time, the female can get pregnant. So, don't be too surprised if in two months you have a litter of puppies.  :) Of course you can wait about a month or so and take her to the vet and they should be able to tell you by then whether or not she is pregnant.  :) lots of luck :)|`|aCqSF87Raa	If you let your dogs mate then she will become pregnant (more than likely.) So one of a few things could happen:    Scenario One) Keep the Pups and be Responsible About It    You'll have to dish out a few grand in vet bills for ultrasounds and regular check-ups.    You'll have to read tons of books and talk to the vet about whelping and possible problems during whelping. You'll have to learn how to bottle feed and stimulate the pups (just in case mom doesn't take care of them.)     Then you'll have to take a few weeks off school/work to stay with mom so you can be there for her during whelping and stay while she nurses the pups to make sure nothing happens.    At the end, you may have a healthy litter of pups that may or may not find good homes. Or you may have a dead b*tch and pups because you didn't know how to recognize a problem.    Scenario Two) Do Nothing and Hope for the Best    Wait to see if she gives birth and hope she doesn't die due to complications.    Scenario Three) Do the Right Thing    You bring her to the vet and have him/her spay your b*tch to keep her healthy and alive, and to keep her pups out of shelters later on in life.|`|RecUV33Daa	ok!!!

YqVtOSWwaa	Have you looked at garage sales, classified ads, and thrift stores for cheap used cages? It is temporary, you will only need it for about 2-3 weeks. It doesn't have to be the perfect size or anything. Try craigslist.com for some cages.    You need a second cage regardless of the situation. The introduction is a lot more risky without one, but even more importantly, you MUST leave a quarantine period. This is where you keep them as far apart from each other, in different buildings even if you can, and monitor the new one for signs of illness. Neglecting to quarantine might cause you to bring in a sick rat that showed absolutely no symptoms, infect your current rat, and you will have to pay two vet bills. It's a good precautionary act, especially if you are low on money now. I wasted lots of vet money myself, and kicked myself about it afterwards since it was so easily prevented. Read about quarantine here:  http://www.petratscanada.com/ratcare.htm|`|Jguzosm2aa	Define 'large cage'.    If the space is large enough for two rats to live comfortably, then you needn't worry about getting a new cage. What you will need to do is scrub the existing cage (both the bars and the base) and all the toys inside and add new bedding before you bring the new rat home. Make sure there are no beds or hides with only one exit, so that one rat cannot corner the other. Let the new rat into the cage for about ten minutes to sniff around, and then add the older rat. Let them sniff each other out, and don't panic if there's a bit of chasing; this is normal. If one attacks the other, remove the bully from the cage and put her in a separate box for about fifteen minutes to cool down. Try again. If the problem reoccurs, remove the bully once more for twice as long. It helps if you can put a few drops of vanilla essence, or another strong (and safe to ingest) scent to both so that they both smell the same when introduced.     Normally, female rats do get along well even if introduced a bit later in life. I don't think it'd be right to give you any sort of percentage, as no two rats are the same. But just try it out. Most stores and breeders have a return policy of some sort, and if it really isn't working out, you'll have that to fall back on. Just remember to inquire about it when picking out your new rat.|`|metCRNaFaa	my sister had 2 rats n one just died so we'd like to get a second one.  i've read up on it n appartenly rats do take easily to each other, probably bout 80% of the time with what ive read which i was surprised with.  the thing is its not a guarentee and id be scared if i introduce them n they seemed fine what would happen if they turned on each other when we wasn't there. i would get second one n if they didnt get along just put the other in a seperate cage but like u cant really afford a second cage so probably not going to get one. from what you;ve sed u spend more than enough time with it n wen ur not there she has toys so i wouldn't worry about it. ours is lonely but thats cos hes used to having a m8 with him but urs hasn't so what she never had she wont miss. ours really like the nibble stick u hang from the cage n there only bout a 1 for 2|`|DgqjjJqJaa	What I did with my rat was I just introduced them in a place they both have never been. I let them check each other out. Sniff each other and all of that and then I cleaned out the cage really good, like I cleaned everything with soap and water real thoroughly. Then I rearranged the cage to make it look differently and I put them both in it. All in one day. They have never fought. I've had my newest for a month now. They still havent fought. They've been great together and get along great! I dont really think a new cage is necessary at all. I know so many people that just stuck their rats together and if there was some fighting they just let them squabble it out, made sure that it didnt get too bad and things were fine. I'd just try it out.|`|FdnShJn9aa	It's too risky to introduce them without a back up cage. Beleive me. It can go REALLY bad. I've heard of rats eating each other because they were just thrown in the same cage. These were FEMALE rats doing this!!     DON'T do it unless you can get another cage. It doesn't have to be brand new, you could look and see if anyone has a cage that they want to get rid of. It doesn't have to be online, I'm sure a Flea Market has one.    Sure, you might think they're lonely, that they will want to try to get along, anyway... take my Stevie for one, he won't get along with any of my boys no matter what I do. So he just lives in a rabbit cage all by himself (which is really big enough for 3 rats.) until I can neuter him.    I know, people have gotten lucky with this and didn't need an extra cage, but think about it: how would you feel to wake up in the morning to find one of your pet rats dead?|`|r0egYHTVaa	ive had 20 rats in my life time, including a hairless... and ive had them all liveing in the same cages... you introduce them to each other in a place where nither rat has been before, ie: the bathroom floor with the door shut... watch them very carefully, they may try to fight once or twice but that is normal, is a pecking order thing... to see whos tougher and in charge, they may whine or squeek when they do which is ok to becuase so rats are whiney... at night keep the cage somewhere close to you so if they start fighting violently you can break them up, dont stick your hand in, you can use the end of a pencil or a soft ruler, dont poke hard to hurt them just so they stop fighting and start paying attention to you... give your first rat treats when you introduce them and praise her if she approches the other and licks or grooms the new rat... and one more thing - you may notice red streeks in the couners of  your rats eyes and nose, it may appear to be blood but it is not, rats have a gland in their body that produses fluid, the fluid tends to be blood colored, so no worries, it is completely normal, if you have any questions feel free to ask any time :]

2fdee6b1fd597a29209ecfad9dc8b598aa	Ferrets need a high quality kibble or a raw and/or natural diet.  For kibble, here is a guide to help you pick the best:  http://www.mdferretpaw.org/care/food_tre...    They need a ferret proofed room to roam in for at leat 4-6 HOURS A DAY.    The cage and play area needs to be cleaned at least once a day (get a good enzymatic cleaner like Zer-Odor, Nature's Miracle, etc).    They need ferret-safe toys.  You must check them for excessive wear and tear daily (toys should not have dangly, small, easily ingested pieces, nor should they have holes which a ferret could get stuck in).    Ferrets are not mean.  They can, however, be unsocialized/teething.  To discipline: scruff, give a LIGHT shake, hiss (long, low 'heh' sound), then say no.  To just restrain: scruff.  *Never hit or spray them in the face.  It is mean and cruel and can caue injury.*    Keep them away from foam, rubber, soft plastics.  Ingesting this can cause blockages.  If you think your fert has ingested something you can give them canned pure pumpkin (Libby's) as long as they can still pass SOME stool.  The first day, give them as much as they can take (or 1 TBS every 3-4 hours); the second day, give 4 times.  You may have to force-feed.  Nix the ferret-lax.    It is always a good idea to have pumpkin, unflavored pedialyte, chicken baby food, needle-less syringes, neosporin, antibacterial flush (Band-Aide for humans is fine), gauze, beeswax, kaopectate/pepto-bismul, pediatric benadryl on hand for emergencies.  Get the proper dosages from a vet and keep the info and supplies together.    Do research on your own.  Join online forums and communities.  Don't rely just on Y!A for the info.  I can guarantee you it won't be complete and indepth.  Always *continue* to look for new info--there's always things to learn.|`|cff06890d4173c156cdcc883215f12bcaa	I'm not going to say you really should have researched their care before getting one.  :)    Anyway, they are a lot of work.  They poop many times a day.  They are very messy.  Feed them a high quality ferret food ONLY.  They love to eat rubber and plastic and frequently become obstructed and need surgery.  Always ferret proof.  They need large cages.  Wash their hammocks and blankets frequently to keep the odor down.  Go to this site for complete info;    http://www.ferretcentral.org/|`|8h5DyQvvaa	I have never owned a ferret but I've seen a TV show about ferret owners.  Their back muscles can get weak so owners usually set a ferret tube (like the plastic kind dogs go through - exept smaller) on stairs and roll a ball through it, playing "fetch" with the ferret to stregthen the muscles.|`|d1742746833f2615dcf34991254210b1aa	There is too much for me to tell you- but you may have had all those pets, but ferrets aren't like any of them. They use blankets for bedding, not wood shavings, are NOT rodents- they're carnivorous weasels, and they can cost you $1000s in their lifetime. They are extremely high-maintenance, htey need to be out of the cage for at least 3 hours a day. Marshalls food is bad, along with multiple others. Good kibbles are Evo ferret, Zupreem, and Totally Ferret.Here are some helpful links  http://www.ferret.org  http://www.ferretcentral.org  http://www.everythingferret.com  http://www.ferretuniverse.com (has a very loud ferret dooking, so you might want to turn your sound down)    Here are my favorite forums  http://www.ferretharmony.com  http://www.ferretopia.proboards51.com  http://www.ferretvillage.org|`|OfL7FjA0aa	Not good Not good my mom had ferrets in collage and they were evil little things(personally i love then) but when they had babies it was all over next time do your reserch!|`|gLfdfXNUaa	yeah you really shouldnt get a pet without researching it first.  get a book on ferrets and/ or spend a lot of time researching them online.  one really important thing to remember is that they are NOT caged animals like hamsters in the sense that, although they live and sleep in a cage they NEED a lot of time out side their cage running around and getting attention from their owner.  ferrets should be out atleast a few hours each day.  but you have to make sure that your house (or whatever rooms they are allowed to roam) is ferret proof so that they cannot get hurt or lost.  i have had ferrets before and if you spend enough time handling, playing and training them they can be great pets even affectionate and cuddly.  good luck!|`|Czh1fbQgaa	It is really dumb to get a pet without researching it beforehand, buy a good book all about their care. Without proper handling, nutrition, and care, your ferret can suffer greatly. Ferrets are not rodents and are nothing like hamsters or gerbils.

WbRhr0OYaa	There is no such thing as one sex being better than another. I have had many of each and I find they are about the same. If your dog is a male I would recommend a female. Of course you should spay her as well. While you may still have some issues at first you won't have two males fighting to be the alpha male. I would bring your dog with you when you pick out your puppy. Watch your dogs reaction to the puppies. With him being older then your puppy will grow up knowing your dog is "the boss".|`|ffbf0a2ccec7c61d3e4e701869d3ad4aaa	Our female dogs were sometimes hormonal and excitable in patches for no good reason which was a bit wearing.     The male dogs have been much more straight forward once we've worked out how to cope with them and they've had their bits dealt with. Also they seem to have more character and are more comical.     We already had a male Spaniel who had become quite grumpy before we got a male Jack Russell and it's cheered him up having the company. He taught the puppy essential boys' stuff like where to sniff and mark and chase foxes and now they are pals. It wouldn't be the same with a girl dog as there would be a different mind set.    Also did you notice that Jack Russells think they're big dogs anyway and seem to get on well with the larger varieties.|`|3f2TLhJhaa	males r more agressive and proutective  females r more loyal and more companian but u should neuder her because if u wont she will get a period and u will get blood and could get infection|`|TC9Z548Maa	Male dogs   They tend to be territorial and dominant. Even before puberty, these behaviours are attributed to male hormones. After puberty, these classical masculine traits get even more exaggerated. This makes training male dogs more difficult.  More active and more destructive.  More prone to aggression with other dogs. Dogs that are the same sex, size and age are more likely to see each other as rivals and show signs of aggression.  Has the instinctual urge to roam.  A neutered male will become similar in temperament and affection as a female. Neutering makes him significantly calmer and far less aggressive.    Female Dogs  Generally easier to train and housebreak.  May be more demanding of affection. Females tend to focus their attention strongly on their human companion.  At puberty, female hormones can changes in behaviour. It can increase possessiveness, alter mood, and increase the need to den.  During a females heat cycle, they will actively seek out males.    The bottom line though is that all dogs are different some people may find males tend to be more affectionate, When adopting a dog/puppy it's always best to see the dogs for yourself.|`|55GNtviDaa	female dogs are so much more calm than males, have both and the male is just more to handle than the female|`|Mlt5jJPSaa	my opinion is a female cause they tend to be much calmer then males and also are less agressive.both genders are great companion.|`|hf2GQbsuaa	female animals are more loving and usually arn't as energetic and arn't as strong (aka easier to handle) ... depends in your personality, if you want an animal that it super active go with a male dog.|`|Dk3Rdj7oaa	Take your PJRT to meet the puppies to see how they get along.

You should get fixed when she is old enough.     Also, please don't assume that your dog would NEVER bite at all. Things can happen. From experience, I had 2 dogs playing with the same toy - they were playing tug. Well, as soon as one of them growled (a playful growl) the other one snapped out of no where and they started fighting. It was very bad and now they stay pretty much away from each other.

rLDf1gGGaa	Never buy a pet without your parents permission, most people who go behind their parents AREN'T allowed to keep the kitten or puppy-they parents take the kitten/puppy and kid and dump the poor animal at the shelter/pound as unwanted pet.    Is it fair on your old cat to get a playful mischivious kitten? 7 x 7=49 approx age of your cat, would you want to be bother with a kitten at that age?a kitten that guaranteed to pester-and want to play when your cat wants only to left alone, grandparents don't have patience for unruley children, neither do alot of old adult cats have patience for unrulely, mischievious little but cute 8week old kitten.    If you have an older cat in your home and are looking for a friend for him or her, another adult cat may be the best choice. Kittens can be too playful and may upset your cat instead of providing companionship. A kitten may cause your resident cat to be more annoyed than amused.     Remember a kitten is going to grow up to be an adult in a BLINK of eye.Kittens may be tonnes of fun, but can also be incrediable destructive, my friend took in two free kittens for christmas for her kids-got tricked into the innocent looks and cutenes factor thinking they won't be any trouble, and now she wants to give them up, because their TOO destructive-Bet she hasn't provided a scratching post or even toys or given them enough attention! But remember a kitten has to learn not to be destructive, you have teach them and provide ways to let them be a cat, you cannot stop a cat from scratching at all.

Save up some money and once you have a decent amount, present your case to them in a mature fashion.

7dc556d67f0e9a4f5714fa5d96b331b7aa	I have rescued many kittens and I would not say this is normal.  It sounds like stomach upset to me.  Make sure you only feed her a high quality food and check her litter box to make sure her stool is not soft and mushy.    Do not feed this cat table scraps or snacks which can make this worse.    This can be from the food you feed her (allergy), to her having an over growth of bacteria in her intestines to her having worms.  If you only feed her a high quality cat food (at least a brand name and the same brand each day) and this continues she might need to see a vet.|`|4a4b9be516eeab81005bf8f97c61e37aaa	Probably because you are feeding her inappropriate, inexpensive grocery store dry food.

If you live in an area that has coyotes and other creatures  that love to eat pets.. then its likely it wont last that long.  It's also likely that someone could have taken your pet in.  That happened to a friend of mine. Someone found her cat  and claimed it as their own.. refused to give him back. :(    There's many possibilities.  But as I said, the most likely answers depend on your area.    The cats around here that go missing usually only last a few days, if not just a single night. Which is why we never let our cat outside past sundown. My cat already had a run-in with a coyote a long while ago and learned his lesson. It broke his hip and would've killed him if it weren't for the neighbor's dog barking.    I wouldn't keep your hopes up. :(  If your cat does come back, count it as a blessing.  But as far as hoping for it.. you'll likely end up disappointed.|`|Qq9dRq6Oaa	I hope you find you cat soon.

We took him to the vet straight away and after 2 nights at the vets an clean bill of health we brought him home again my dad didn't;t want to give the cat away again much to my relief and he stay with us for another 15 yrs when he died of old age.

She was at work and got a call from a vet saying they had her cat. She thought someting had happend to Bonnie his sister. But no they said it was Clyde(he was chipped). To cut a long story short when he went missing he had got into the rubbish bins and gone to sleep. He was then taken to a rubbish dump where he had been for the past 5 years. The person we think who had been around then got ill so they took to a local vet.  Clyde is a very happy content cat now.|`|6So3uHtRaa	I have a friend who moved house with her cat and they let it out before it got used to its surroundings. It was gone for about 3-4 Months. They went out into the garden every couple of hours at first to shout it. No luck. Eventually she gave up. A couple of days later who did she find fast asleep on her school bag. Her cat!   What im trying to say is to not give up. Ask your neighbours if they have seen her/him. You never know she might have just fancied a walk and got a little lost. Dont worry cats have great sent glands and will he/she will use that to get home.     Hope you see her/him again. Good Luck|`|PmQyPEmpaa	Awww my heart goes out to you,please don't give up hope,I've heard so many stories of people's cats that have gone missing and then have just re-appeared a number of months or years later,just like a lot people on here.Our cats are all indoor cats,but that's because one of our guys,who used to go out,went missing after a neighbour let a fire work off,she was missing for I think about two days,and I worried myself sick,I stayed up all night just in case she needed to come in,and then on the second night that she was gone,about two in the morning I heard her chirrping at the back door to be let in,I tell you it was the absolute best feeling,I sat down with her and cried with her in my lap and since then she nor any of the other guys have gone out ,it broke my heart too much when we couldn't find her. So I guess what I'm trying to say is don't give up,put more posters up,knock some doors,ask people to check their shed's and garages,and ring all the animal homes in your area,you never know someone may have picked him up and handed him to a shelter,also see if you can get a little story in your local paper,they may be able to print a picture of him and ask for any sightings,it's definately worth a go,my guys are sending over sand paper kisses in hope your little man returns safely home to you soon xx|`|cAoJmUMIaa	i had one that was missing for nearly two years he came back a bit bedraggled but ok so don't give up hope...|`|77700ae60cac2abd41d7a7f8bd98336aaa	I had one missing for 7 months then one night I got a phone call from a guy that had found her sleeping on his porch just blocks from my house.

I hope yours does too!|`|uPYgASpNaa	Omg I just remember tomorrow is the anniverersey of the day our tigger went missing.  Maybe he will show up one day!  Theres nothing false in hope!  I still have my jenny though =)|`|Fu7OK54kaa	my cat was missing for about 2 weeks and it turned out we accidentally locked her in the garage :S  she was hungry!! But she got a load of roast chicken on tap so she didn't hold a grudge :P    Yes, cats can be missing for absoloute ages and come back!! Keep your frame of mind, never forget and maybe rescue a new cat? Again, NEVER forget your friend :)
ak9DrBSwaa	Campbells Russian Dwarfs? The fathers actually help raise the babies, it'd be uncommon for him to destroy a healthy litter if they have a large enough cage, proper diet etc.|`|NVx3iRZJaa	Mothers naturally eat the unhealthy babies, or the babies they know for whatever reason won't make it.    Not all fathers attack the babies, but the majority of them will so it's just better not to risk it.|`|cesTfRKPaa	Oh my gosh i am so sorry. ):|`|xBd96wvRaa	The mother feels they are in danger and they are stupid and eat their babies to protect hem.

ffe5fd93595474e278dc16274aa2a2d4aa	Unfortunelty this is why nature did not design the persian cat: it was man that did through breeding- in nature, these cats just don't exist, and so to keep them in fit condition, people do need to put in alot of work.    You would need to brush her atleast once per day, and wash her with a mild detergent for animals once per week. She will continue to wash herself, cats do, but as it gets warmer, she will get hairballs and this will result in her throwing up alot, so getting her used to being brushed and washed every day/week is essential as soon as possible.    It can take hours to brush and clean a cat with long hair, my grandmother used to know all about this stuff. It is sometimes better to brush before washing, and then brush after washing. When you towel dry, make sure you do so with a towel- no rubbing, just padding. Keep the cat warm! Some cats are better then others but you will likely need two people until she gets used to it. If your cat allows you to, use a hair drier on a cooler setting, but be aware it can terrify some cats and put them off the entire cleaning process, thus making it much harder for you next time!|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Brushes don't do anything for longhair cats like a Persian type.  You need a fine toothed and medium toothed comb and use it every day to keep tangle/knots from forming.  Brushes just go over the surface of the coat - not down to the skin.|`|JgTNtT9Uaa	Just give her a spliff and put bob marley on the stereo, she will be happy :) failing that, my mum has a dog and he gets mats, she uses some kind of de-tangling oil on him. Perhaps they have the same for Rasta Cats? Try Pets-R-Us if your in the UK.   Sorry for the joke, just tickled me, Good luck, Vik|`|c88Z21chaa	we had a persian living on a farm, n she never got dreads! do try combing rather than brushing, and be thorough. remove as many dead hairs as u can. clipping isnt a bad idea, we clipped our cat every summer and although people thought she looked funny, she was more comfortable and its all about keeping her happy.    cats dont naturally turn to dreadlocks, she should be able to keep herself half decent and if she is struggling, you should take her to the vet to get her teeth/mouth checked.    hope everything works out!  xox|`|6Ow34Lokaa	My cat, Tasha the Persian (that's her name), insists on being brushed several times a day. We use a kinda limp wire brush, get lotsa hair off her. I'm thinking of using it for something. Do you brush too hard? I give Tasha the high fashion Persian cat a dab of butter every day to keep her skin and fur kinda moisturized and easier to brush. We don't see dreadlocks in Tasha,  the high fashion cat.|`|oCJVZ1WCaa	Brush her so there is no matted fur and it is knot-free and just brush her whenever she needs it. :]  x|`|PGXMGlxGaa	You bathe your cat?! Wow, that's brave...    Do you use a brush when you groom her? A fine tooth comb is better at keeping mattes and clumps at bay - it works for our long-coated Persian.|`|OfL7FjA0aa	Try checking the local pet store for cat grooming stuff or detangeling spray|`|tBJZ3RtQaa	Give her no hairball food tht u can get from a local pet store and the shampoo can be a no hairball thing to|`|AA10387399	Try a comb after the brushing, If that doesn't work  have the vet do a lion cut on her. Good luck aren't persians wonderful|`|ibtkbZWmaa	theres no way lol  u just hav to cut them out wen u can =]  i hav one lol|`|PmQyPEmpaa	You need a comb rather than a brush,we have a maine coon and like the maine coon's,persians have a three layer coat,so a comb will get right into all the layers and get all the loose hair out,a brush will only brush through the top layer of hair,when our cooney was having problems with her hair matting all the time,we trimmed the fur like yourselves which worked for awhile but then would soon matt again,we were constantly combing her and in the end she started to hate it,but a cooney breeder then told me to try a really fine dusting of plain unscented talc powder,put the talc in your hands and then pat over her fur,and then comb out,it helps to take out any grease that may be laying in her fur or on her skin and will make the fur easier to comb.Just make sure you get all the talc out,you only need a small amount anyway,we've tried it and it really has worked,once she started to feel that her fur was a lot better and not so uncomfortable she then got back to grooming herself properly again,so try a comb and some talc should do the job,good luck
ZQS2Q6cXaa	what is dripping from her mouth?  and what was she doing prior to this starting. you need to post some more facts.|`|n99NOgHJaa	It's hard to tell just by what you've said. If you are really concerned I suggest calling up a vet , or taking it to the vet at you first chance.
pDKm9Wmgaa	The cat will only die soon if it is not taken to the vet. The cat probably has a UTI (Urinary Tract Infection). It is uncomfortable to downright painful. That pain is associated with the litterbox. If the cat does not get veterinary help, the cat will make a habit of urinating inappropriately. Your mom must get the cat to the vet.|`|w1lh1INHaa	Well, your mom could be right if the cat doesn't get to the vet and get treatment soon.    A cat peeing on the floor is trying to tell you it has a problem.  If the cat isn't drinking excessively, it could be a bladder or urinary tract problems.  There are a lot of reasons why your cat might be peeing on the floor, some serious, some not, but most easily handled with a visit to the vet.    Again, your cat peeing on the floor is a signal your cat needs a vet visit, and not necessarily a death rattle.  Five years old is very, very young for a cat.    Vet, first thing Monday.|`|ocwetmQuaa	He may have developed Chronic Renal Failure.  Without treatment, he will not last even 2 years.  You can read about the desease online.|`|dpKQMoMWaa	he probably has a bladder infection. thats what my cat has. take him to a vet! they can die, but not if he's treated soon enough. TAKE HIM TO VET!|`|h5xSfcT6aa	no! you cannot tell whether he is going to die soon or not! load of rubbish.  he may have lost some control of his bladder, in which case he might need some medication, so I would take him to the vets to check he doesnt have a unrinary infection, or kidney infection.  or  he may just be being lazy and testing the limits! it is winter after all, and my cat sometimes just cant be bothered to go out so pees inside! very naughty girl, but you can understand why! its just so cold!    dont worry  xxx
Fu7OK54kaa	http://www.omlet.co.uk there's a house for them and they do crap everywhere, but easily wash-awayable with a hose on solid-areas, they eat corn, you can either buy online or get it from pet-shops, very cheap btw! They need a constant water supply of water for drinking like any animal, and would very much appreciate a sand-pit or paddling pool full of water. But, you need to clip their wings so they don't fly away. You might need to make some kind of barricade for your plants because they will eat anything they can, no matter how expensive :P    Make sure you get a small breed of duck. AVOID MUSCOVY DUCKS|`|tp61e25Eaa	They crap everywhere. Their pond/pool will have to be cleaned often. They need shelter to keep them from predators at night. You can get a feed for them from a feed store. They would be best in a fenced pen with a pool/pond, or in a yard with one and having some sort of shelter to retreat to. They are adorable with their little duck feet and bills, but they do crap a lot.|`|P6NptCz8aa	I own a pet chicken, and they are similar. Ducks are a little more loyal, which is kind of  cute. My uncle had ducks and they used to nestle in his beard when he took a bath. The problem - they have very runny poop and lots of it. Do whatever it takes to make them poop outside. This is why I brought up my pet chicken - these kinds of animals don't really have a sense of where they should or shouldn't poop. You just have to make sure they do it outside, or have a scrubber and a bottle woolite handy in case they let loose a fresh steamer on the carpet.|`|IQjO3Weoaa	Well, have you got a pond or some sort of private water feature? It would need to be pretty big. That would be a good start.|`|kMkRXLpEaa	No but they make a good snack|`|9GvflDg1aa	I don't think they would be very fun pets.    & they need to stay outside.|`|8Y583Fluaa	they do indeed cr@p everywhere and it is cruel to own one cuz they are social birds of thier own kind...they need a lake and freedom|`|Qas05nZraa	yes they're good pets|`|XZlFLecLaa	maybe if you get it a diaper ... they have no control of their bowel movements....|`|F08HDRvraa	I have had a couple of ducks and live in the city.  They need a pen with a small plastic wading pool and you will need to have hay in the pen and clean it daily to keep the smell down. You will also have to dump the pool because they will crap in there as well. Yes, they do crap every where, they cannot be kept inside when they get older because of this.  Also, if you live where it gets cold in the winter, you will have to have a special shelter so they aren't exposed to snow or ice.  There is special duck food that you can buy at farm supply stores that is not expensive at all.  They are interesting critters, but I'm not sure I would do it again.|`|Vv465eJMaa	Yes they make decent pets but you need at least 20ftx20ft water with vegetation and grass.The poo is always the wet type.Chicken make excellent pets they love being stroked and picked up and great individual characters|`|HKNbWjtOaa	i had a Peking duck and it was lovely!|`|P4RZK3dyaa	it worked on Friends!|`|UBS4jIAcaa	ducks make excellent pets, and receipes too.   mmmmm bombay duck|`|0mXQODsIaa	we had ducks and we didnt live on a farm. they think that the first person they see is their mum. they are loyal to that person, but they get vicious to other people. so get one still in an egg and incubate it, and make sure you are the first thing it sees. get 1 though, 1 is enoough|`|rpA9y3Wuaa	They crap and make a mess of everything!!!!|`|Vl2Z390Eaa	last week i caught a duck cos it was gettin attacked and now i still have it. i feed mine duck or chicken pellets from the pet shop. they are really cheap. i think you can give them vegetable scraps aswell and they eat snails and other bugs. they can be kept in a pen made out of wire or an avairy or something similar. they can be fine with a tub of water. as long as they can drink out of it and wash themselves they will be fine. um yeh they do crap alot. i dont live on a farm or anywhere near the country either.

4gcy4q95aa	It could be just a hairball but your cat also could have been eating a lot of grass while it was outside.  If a cat eats to much grass they will throw up.  I guess it keeps to clean out their digestive system or something.|`|737e8ad896c16931d3da06dca8c8e2b4aa	A barfer kitty is always a concern... It is encouraging that this has stopped now that kitty is kept indoors.     An outdoor cat can get into all sorts of mischief. Catching and eating birds is a particular problem. If kitty ate the birds they might induce an emetic episode. So yes it could be because she ate something weird.  Feathers are hard to digest!|`|EFqqpwiRaa	it's possible she had been eating grass. it is normal for them to throw up afterwards. this site lists reasons why cats eat grass:  http://www.pawsonline.info/grasseating.h...|`|6Ow34Lokaa	Not usually something to worry about. My big male cat throws up for fun. He seems to enjoy it. A  few times he puked on the newspaper as I was reading it and I swear he was laughing at me. None of my cats have health problems, they just don't mind puking as much as people do.|`|8uqbNrICaa	Food changing could be the cause, as well as hair balls swallowed while she cleans her hair by licking.|`|wMXAatHyaa	My cat throws up all the time he eats to fast and to much it is normal.

EeJMITyCaa	Their eyes open and start seeing 2-3 weeks. They can start being weined at 3-4 weeks meaning you leave food (meat flavored human baby food or hard dog food that hs been soaked in warm water) out for them and they will begin starting to taste it but they probably won't completetly give up milk until they're around 5 weeks.|`|lhOd2hvXaa	Pups open their eyes at 10-14 days.    They'll start toddling soon thereafter but won't be ready to wean (eat puppy food) until 4 weeks of age or so (at the earliest, this is breed dependent).    Good Luck!|`|2O58btqxaa	7 to 14 days to open eyes bout 4 weeks to start walking and 4 weeks to start eating|`|XgqwQ7szaa	2-3 weeks for eye sight and hearing.  3-4 weeks for puppy chow|`|46eedfcc0d431f5086b7b4cfa950eb57aa	Miss and Susie are right but don't forget they need their mother for 8 weeks
cff06890d4173c156cdcc883215f12bcaa	Very normal for them to do so.  They get extra nutrients (especially vitamins) from doing this.  Don't worry.  :)|`|Bw18seFqaa	they are suppossed to.. yes..   Guinea Pigs do not always fully digest their food the first time around, so they eat their poop so they can re-digest what nutrients they did not get.  Many animals do this.. its called coprophagia    You cant get the pig to stop.. its just what they do.|`|Wbz8Q6ztaa	I think so    If guinea pigs have a similar digestive system to a rabbit then they are supposed to be eating their own poop.  They have a very poor digestive system which is pretty much dead straight as opposed to curly lik ours. This means that they don't have much time to properly digest their food, so they eat their poop in order to digest the food that they didn't digest the first time|`|Czh1fbQgaa	They do eat some of their poo, and it helps them absorb nutrients.
etVzcc6gaa	Hi!  Hens usually start laying at about 6 months old. You can start telling the difference between sexs a few months earlier than this though. Have a look at this website http://www.americansilkiebantamclub.org/... It gives a few hints on what to look out for.    Hope that helps!|`|bTvrv59saa	No. Eggs look the same. Not untill they hatch. (duh?) (jk. lol)|`|AA10356572	they will lay in the spring after they are 6 months of age or more..  you can tell the gender when they start crowing - or laying...
eSoU2C3Waa	make it so the bigger tank is on the bottom and the smaller one on top.  I would build it because then you can build it bigger then the tank and later on if you want a bigger tank it's easy and you don't have to spend a lot of money.
CUFnorZyaa	50 to 60% normally and bump it up to 70 to 75% when he goes into a shed. Otherwise you might get spotty sheds. Not always, but it can be an issue.|`|eSoU2C3Waa	60-70% or he'll have a hard time shedding.|`|cff06890d4173c156cdcc883215f12bcaa	60-70%.  He'll have shedding problems if it's too low.  Great site:    http://www.kingsnake.com/ballpythonguide...|`|nmzpdvkqaa	40-50% when not in shed, and 60-70% when in shed.
cff06890d4173c156cdcc883215f12bcaa	If he is eating, happy and active, then don't worry.  He may be sneaking sips of water or getting enough from his food (if it's canned).  If he is urinating plenty, then he is drinking.  Sometimes they don't drink or eat much when they first come home because of the stress and separation anxiety.  Just keep a couple of dishes of fresh water available and you should see him drink soon.|`|sbeHyaCqaa	he is a toy.|`|IQjO3Weoaa	Dogs get a lot of their moisture from food (that is if he is on tinned food, not dry). Try getting her to drink puppy milk  - you can buy cartons from the supermarket. It will taste nicer than milk. If none of that works, I suggest taking a trip to the vet.|`|cMz0Cbu4aa	Maybe you dont see him drink water. They dont always drink water when they eat. Change your water every day. Does the water bowl smell weird? Im sure he is drinking. Dont give him anything else to drink.

X2TnitFwaa	Do not feed your rabbit carrots. It's okay to give small amounts sometimes as a treat, but it has too much natural sugars in it to be a big part of his diet.    The main part of his diet should be hay, alfalfa since he's young. As he gets older, switch him to timothy hay. A list of vegetables rabbits can eat, as well as other nutritional information, is here:    http://mybunny.org/info/rabbit_nutrition...    You can also give a small amount of pellets every day, but the most important thing is hay.    Rabbits clean themselves, and should only be given baths if there's something you need to wash off of them (like if he steps in urine or something). Baths really stress rabbits out.    You should brush him every week, and every day when he's shedding.    If he's a house rabbit, you don't need to worry how cold it is, whatever cold is fine for you, is fine for the rabbit. The only thing to worry about is heat.    If he lives outside, try to keep the temperature from between 45-75 degrees, which is where rabbits feel most comfortable. I do suggest you keep him inside, though.    Make sure you provide him with chew toys, and plenty of other toys, as bored bunnies will become depressed, or angry, which could lead to damage of your things. Rabbits also need chew toys for keeping their teeth short.    Some ideas for toys are cardboard boxes, and toilet paper rolls, or you can buy a lot of neat toys at pet stores.|`|qeOlkRM0aa	My last rabbit lived 13 years.Feed them rabbit food, and alfalfa or timothy hay. Let young rabbits eat as much as they wish, until they are 6 months old, then cut back. They generally like regular room temps, even a little cooler is fine.  Remember, rabbits are intelligent and very sensitive animals. They ask for so little and can give so much. They thrive on love, and can pine away if ignored or neglected.|`|GoEdpprvaa	Lol. They live for years, not 6 months. You should give your rabbit rabbit food (little pelits), fresh vegies & fruits like lettuce, apples, carrots, etc, water & straw/hay. They can basically clean themselves, but if you want you can give it a bath but they have sharp nails so be careful. For a bed, you should fill a cardboard box with some blankets. Rabbits like to jump around the place & exercise so you should make sure it does that. Also, they can be litter box trained (filled with moltch).  :]|`|4a4b9be516eeab81005bf8f97c61e37aaa	The principal ingredient in a young bunny's diet should be alalfa hay when it is young because it has extra calcium.  Then the rabbit needs to have timothy hay for the rest of its life.  About an eighth of a cup of pellet a day is OK.  A nub of carrot, some healthy greens such as cilantro, Italian parsley, lettuce (not iceberg which has no nutrition).  An occasional slice of banana, a strawberry, or apple slice a couple of times a week.  I have been told the amount of fresh veggies should be the size of the bunny's head daily and fruit is definitely a treat.  It has a high water and sugar content and can cause diarrhea.  He should also have a full water bottle at all times - filtered water if you can.  I use a Brita water filter for my cats' water.    If the bunny's diet is correct, his litterbox changed daily and his cage cleaned out daily he will never be "dirty".  Rabbits clean themselves, like cats.    Remember the hay is the most important element in his diet.  Without that roughage rabbits can get fatal intestinal blockages as they cannot throw up the hair they ingest from grooming themselves.    Google up the House Rabbit Society and you will get information on all aspects of caring for your rabbit.  It is important that your rabbit be neutered as soon as you can do that.  It makes for a healthier, happy pet for your home.    Your rabbit must live INDOORS so temperature will not be a problem.|`|4Uj2SJP1aa	They can live between 10-14 if cared for correctly.  Currently one of mine is 8.  They need plenty of timothy hay.  Besides carrots you can give them Romaine lettuce, Kale, Dill, Parsley, Dandelion, Turnip greens, Cilantro and Spinach.  Their diet should be mainly these veggies mentioned.  The pellets should be kept to a minimum, about a spoonfull per day.   You can also give them strawberry tops, and if you give it apple it should not be very big, and no seeds.  They clean themselves, they don't really need baths, unless they have like too much urine on their feet you can clean the feet.  If  you ever decide it needs a bath do not get the ears wet on the  inside or the nose(nostrils).  Keep him inside your home room temperature is good.  In the summer make sure he does not get too hot, under 75 degrees is ok.  Rabbits can die if they are kept in extremely hot temperature.  When you pick him up make sure his back is secure, their spine is very delicate.  Do not pick him up by its ears, or by pulling the skin.  You can also litter train your bunny, pay attention where it pees and then get a corner litter box and put some Aspen Supreme litter pellets.   Also let your bunny out of the cage for a few hours so it can get some exercise.  Water should always be available and clean,  change the water in its bottle every day or every two days.  Timothy hay should be in the cage at all times.  And last when you have a chance to go to a pet store get some chewing wood blocks for him.  Good luck with your bunny.
gJBqAXwtaa	Trust me on this one   this is a very reliable website , you go there and find puppies for sale then you can get the contact information for the seller off of the website and get in contact with them personally  you don't buy the dog over the internet or anything  very reliable   i bought my three dogs through this site and so did my cousin after i recommended it to her  here is the site:    http://www.epupz.co.uk/search/index.asp    i hope you get the dog your looking for   you can also see information about this particular breed on this site to give you an idea of how they act and what they are tolerable to and stuff like that if you don't already know.  im wish you the very best of luck getting a new dog is a wonderful experience and the memories of them remain with you forever.  good luck :D  xxx|`|BhXOLas1aa	Dalmatians are prone to many inbreed illnesses so ask your local vet how to find a breeder that is approved. Take out insurance when you find one because they will cost you a fortune in vets fee's unless you do.  Dalmatians need at least 3 hours walking a day or they can become bored and destructive.  They look nice but need a lot of care and dog experience to keep them healthy and happy.  Wishing you all the best and make sure you never buy one from a puppy farm|`|AA11443269	I would recommend that you do some Research that breed, they are not for everyone.

They have purebreds of almost every breed, as well as hybrids and mutts.    You'll be giving a home to a puppy that needs one, and I'm sure it's less expensive than a breeder.|`|iHkbrJF1aa	Before you buy one, I'd thought I'd let you know that they are hard to train and are stubborn dogs. My I know of 3 different owners through the years who had them and all of them told me the same thing.|`|Y3c1DRYKaa	It is a good idea to contact the kennel club and find out if they have any dalmation breeders on their accredited breeder scheme, that way you can be sure that the puppies have been well bred and properly cared for in line with the kennel clubs regulations. It is worth considering contacting a local shelter as they are struggling to cope with the amount of dogs they have, however it is your choice i hope you find the right puppy and good luck :)
F3FrZ7eAaa	Yes they can! I've seen them at the pet store many times. I don't think they're too expensive, but I can't give you a price.     Piranhas live up to their Hollywood reputation as vicious fish that will not hesitate to chew off the hand that feeds it. This isn't a pet for the faint of heart  only experienced aquarists should take on the piranha.    In the home aquarium, piranhas will reach about 8 to 10 inches in length if given enough room. They have a silvery-gold color, a red throat, and a mouth full of razor sharp teeth designed for tearing flesh. They are found naturally in the waters of South America and Guyana and it is illegal to import or export them in many countries.     You might want to read up a little about them before buying some though! Good luck :)|`|HBsc2wwLaa	Yes they can. They retail around 20 for 4-5", but are hard to transport because they bite through the bag. They are very shy and hide when they see movement, so you'd be looking into what seemed like an empty tank most of the time!|`|Bw18seFqaa	they are illegal in some areas, check with your local animal control to find out if you can own them.      I've seen them at some petshops..  price may depend on the size of the fish itself..  last time I saw one they were around $50 each...  its been a long time since I've seen one at a petshop tho.    You could also get a Pacu, which resembles the piranah.. however they are not aggressive, nor do they require live prey.|`|T13qFY1baa	yes they can infact my dad used to have one though in some states you will need a license but if you dont wanna go through the legal stuff you could get a pacu they are closely related and look almost identical to red phirrana|`|AtHBtTaJaa	yep !!  it depense on where you live some areas of the world you might need a licence or sumthign they selll them in the pet shop i got my snake from   such kl pets the shop owner is a frend of my mum and has them at home she said there such good fish !! lol|`|xyPpruSjaa	Yeppp! You can keep 'em as pets! Do research on google to see if they are legal in your state though. Some states have certain restrictions that you need to check out.     Be aware that you will have to feed them live animals...such as mice, and gold fish, meal worms, etc. If you're too squeamish then pirhanas aren't the right pet for you :]     You can buy them from breeders or at a pet store (if they have 'em)    Good luck!
hfZIKrhCaa	take him to the beach or to the park or for a walk  or lay fetch or something  if you try playing with him he might stop  buy him some treats and teach him to stop growling and if he does give him a treat so he gets teached good manners|`|66jX06Onaa	I don't allow my dogs to get away with growling. Something is wrong between you and the dog. Either you're touching him in a way that aggravates him, or perhaps there is some teasing going on. Dogs don't like teasing much - it's deceptive and annoys them.    Work with your parents to find out a better way to deal with the dog.  A growl is a warning. If it's not heeded, it could turn into a bit.|`|2ef97aeb1a649982da219c1f98d30f3aaa	He probably thinks of you as just another littler mate and is trying to be dominant over you.  He has to learn his place in the pack and that is at the bottom, then you, then your mom and then your dad.  Have you had the dog in obedience classes?  If not , maybe you should.  Good Luck|`|SEvhwIXQaa	Not really sure what your question(s) are.  But here's what I do with odd dog behavior.  I lay down near the dog but not next to the dog.  If the dog has any friendly feelings towards you at all, it will come and sit next to you.  It might take a few minutes but you will know how your dog feels about you.    Also, the only dog I ever knew who growled at my constantly whenever I petted it had been abused as a puppy.  The puppy had been teased a lot and when it grew into an adult dog, it never trusted men again.  I hope that hasn't happened to your dog as it can be tough to overcome.  Good luck.|`|zWFJBlJZaa	I, for one, would like to know what breed of dog this is and how old it is.    From what little information you have given, I would suspect that you have either pestered the dog too much (which is why your parents are telling you to slow your roll) or the dog has some other issues.    If it is an old dog and it is growling when you pet it, perhaps it has aching spots that are touch sensitive and it's trying to tell you, "No, not there."    If this is not the case, your dog is playing a domination game -- AND THAT'S A DANGEROUS GAME THAT WILL GET YOU BIT!  If this is the case, your dog needs professional training by an instructor who specializes in aggression problems.    Certain terriers get "flaky" like this with children, so your parents idea of you ignoring the dog for awhile until this problem gets fixed may save you from getting hurt.|`|3VNOKSEPaa	The growling is probally like a cat purring! He likes it & when you stop he gets mad!
pv7XYLELaa	Uhm, Try to keep your eye on them at all times for the first day, females will generally fight and tick each other off.    If they don't get along take the new one back to the store.    I would say buy another cage for the female, or buy a male and give the pups back to the pet store when they're old enough.    If it's a Syrian hamster, don't buy either. Syrians will fight to the death no matter what sex you have.|`|O5kuTvMOaa	well simply pick up the new hamster and cookie then like hold them up to each other and then after about ten minutes put them in the cage and they shouldnt fight|`|Km6gOd61aa	I'm sorry to say but you can't put two hamsters togeter in the same cage unless they've lived together from birth. You're going to havee 2 get 2 cages. Sorry. I would suggest getting a cheaper cage from crittertrail
Cl23eeneaa	Hello I work in an animal hospital..  1. Try and keep your pet relaxed..the more hyper he/she is the more blood flow there will be.  2. If he/she has ripped off the nail completely and if gushing blood I recommend taking him/her to your local vet or 24-7 emergency clinic. If the nail is partially ripped they may be able to save the nail or they may have to just yank it off (should not try at home)  3. Home remidies include, if you have any flour in your house apply the flour to the area that is bleeding the pasty flower will help the bleeding to stop with an ample amount of pressure..  If you have any gauze pads (preferably the non sticking ones) and some sort of bandaging material in your home get it. once your think the bleeding has calmed down place some extra flour on the gauze pad and apply that to the area and simply wrap your dogs paw with the bandage..not to tight not to loose..the bandage should end just below the "wrist joint"    If you feel you cannot handle this at home then just take a wash cloth and wrap up your dogs paw and take him to your vet  hope that info was usefull|`|GVC08Swkaa	That means she ripped apart this sensitive vein thing in her nail.... go to the vet IMMEDIATLY|`|KIX3Hfakaa	take her to the vet!! immediatley!!!! believe me, i know!!|`|uydFTAJCaa	Hold pressure on it will a wash cloth and take her to a vet. Also, hold her paw up high. Or, call the vet and see what he thinks. Hope your dog will be ok.|`|MTJs95Emaa	Put pressure on her paw if she'll let you and take her to the vet ASAP. She could get a infection really easily.|`|cc2a9fa95b895badd94cab1b2f6a808baa	muzzle her so she doesn't bite you, get a towel and apply direct pressure on the paw. then take her to the vet.|`|9IhgFvuLaa	Take her to the vet, but dab teh paw in flour or something to make the blood clot, go to the vet right now,|`|7b31ddb38e2072009948a9a8c2511aeeaa	sounds bad but light a match, blow it out and immediately stick it to it! coderize it and FAST!|`|LdbNOGzQaa	Cornstarch will act as a "quick stop" like the groomers use. I would also call or go see a vet it may need to be treated or sutured if there is a hole. Bandage it to help also. If the whole nail is ripped out I would give him a pain killer (ask your vet for the best one, I use baby Tylenol)|`|OHI4Sca4aa	Vet, now.  it won't stop bleeding on it's own|`|svtJYHM3aa	Depends on how far she pulled it off. if she still has some nail then she probably just chewed/tore into the quick, which can bleed pretty badly if the dog is older, but usually looks worse then it is. If this is the case, put some corn starch of the toe and it should stop the bleeding. Now if she tore her whole nail off or ripped her dew claw out, then yes, take her to the vet!|`|2ofzcrdGaa	You need to take her to the vet. if you can not stop the bleeding.|`|7nGwou8uaa	ice and elevation?|`|RSDmLgXDaa	emergency??|`|ydshiNrKaa	Hold a piece of gauze over it and apply slight pressure.  It should stop. You can put some corn starch or flour on it also to help clot the blood.  Keep it clean and keep an eye on it and watch for infection.|`|agTCqkLDaa	Wrap an old shirt or towel around it tight enough to stop the bleeding, but not too tight so as not to cut of circulation.  Have her in a calm area.  Take her to the vet ASAP.|`|RKw56KZaaa	Wrap a rag around it and put a sock over it to soak up the blood and stop the bleeding.|`|mcqO9Hgxaa	i'd take her to the vet ASAP.. but thats just me,  hope your dog is okay!|`|GZCmyzBYaa	get a towel and keep presser on it till it stops bleeding, then once it does put a sock over your dogs foot to keep your dog from picking at it till your dogs nail grows back|`|wmtbNdO0aa	Try holding a towel to the wound to stop the bleeding and call your vet.|`|e7uUfLsqaa	Get some septic powder - that stops the bleeding. (may be called something else, but they have it at pet store).    good luck|`|NYg0M9Ttaa	When my dog's ear got a thorn stuck through it ( I had to remove it) it bled a lot! but that's only because they bleed more to make sure any dirt comes out. It should be fine, but if it doesn't stop take her to the vet.|`|q76xm0YRaa	Grab a cup of corn starch or if you don't have it, get some flour and stick your dog's paw in it.|`|IDgSVPBxaa	First of all get some cornstarch or cornmeal and dip her toe in it.  Then call the VET.  or 24 hour vet may have to laser seal it.|`|HmkCFddAaa	If you don't have a septic stick take some flour and make a thick paste and apply it to the area.. I have found that a flour paste works better than the septic stick.  If you do this and it doesn't stop take the dog to the vet.
Fu7OK54kaa	It means the dog's been registered with the Kennel Club. Only pedigree pups with parents that have been KC registered can be registered too. And this is dogs only. There are separate ones for other animals. I can't remember the cat one, but the rabbit one is BRC, British Rabbit Council and there are others for different places, e.g. britain, USA|`|xdF08Uqfaa	kc or kennel club means that the dog is recognised as a genuine breed of dog,by the club,and not a cross breed.|`|Ld1vLH8Kaa	It has been registered with the Kennel club, meaning they have records on its history|`|OD3FqMaKaa	registered with the Kennel Club    http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/|`|AA11579568	KC=Kennel Club  It means the animal has a pedigree and is registered as a pure bred by the KC|`|OxmoHPhcaa	yeah..

lyhnHhuWaa	Cats are in heat on average from 14-21 days.  Short of having her spayed there is NOTHING you can do to make her stop.  Her behavior is perfectly normal for that of a female cat in heat so it's something that you'll have to endure if she's not going to be spayed.  I recommend calling your vet first thing Monday and making an appointment to have her spayed.  Although they'll charge a tad more because it's more complicated, she can be spayed while in heat.  This will stop the annoying heat cycles and contribute to her long term good health.  With every heat cycle she's at risk for pyometra, a potentially lethal uterine infection.  Until she's spayed, she's at risk for ovarian and uterine cancer.  Having her spayed will eliminate that risk, and will significantly reduce her risk for getting mammary cancer.|`|AA10027242	Have her spayed.  It is the responsible thing to do.|`|6KxBqnstaa	Well you can make it stop permanently by getting her spayed.|`|9f97f8a980cb5aa7360577720efbdd70aa	You make it stop by being a responsible pet owner and SPAYING her....it is not rocket science...geesh!|`|AA10371721	The poor cat is miserable.

But if you can't try to calm her down or bring her to the vets office they know what to do.|`|AA12398420	Spaying your cats is a win-win situation for all involved. Your cat will be healthier and happier. And you will no longer have to deal with her being in heat.  Besides that is the responsible thing to do when you are a pet owner.|`|kQStNgzUaa	Keep her in until she is out of heat(best to keep her in all the time anyway), then have her spayed. There are various organizations that may be able to help with the cost of the surgery. Note:after spaying, your cat will need to be kept quiet for a few days, and you will need to check the incision several times a day to ensure that it is healing ok. Good luck.
PumYhJSvaa	Keep an eye on her. My dog acted the same when she went into labor. As soon as you see a mucus plug looking thing come out, she is ready to go. Make sure she is comfortable and don't let her walk around with any pups sticking out of her. If she has trouble birthing at all, you can gently pull the pup the rest of the way out.|`|PM23RDycaa	Its possible.    First you need to move her from under the bed to somewhere you can actually monitor. Do NOT leave her unattended if she is in labor. If you have a large plastic storage container that is low enough for her to get in and out of but high enough to keep puppies in place her in that.    Find the number for your local ER vet. And despite what some have said no not all dogs instinctively know what they are doing, let nature take its course blah blah. There have been bitches who don't tear the sac from around their pups to outright killed them.    Whelping - http://www.hilltopanimalhospital.com/whe...

For every pup you should see an equal number of after births.|`|t3A9qpQIaa	Sounds like it to me.  You can keep checking on her and pet her and talk softly, tell her it's going to be alright.  give her some water, no food, and keep soft, clean cloths on hand.  If you have to pull a puppy out put a cloth around the head and very gently pull.  Put puppy up by mom's head , she will clean and then put by nipple.  Old baby blankets are questionable.  There is a smothering risk.  Why not a stack of clean newspapers?  You have a lot of good advice here, I suspect you are doing just fine.  Being a mother yourself I think you will know if something is not right.  Call the vet and let him know so he will be available for phone.  Be sure to get shots and worm on time.  They are born with worms.|`|hUYaaXBvaa	i would call you vet if your concerned  they would know better  i don't know that you could predict when she'll have them|`|cff06890d4173c156cdcc883215f12bcaa	Sounds like labor.  She may be in pain and not sure what is happening if this is her first litter.  Ideally you would have had a whelping box all set up for her to get used to a couple of weeks ago.  Do you have supplies on hand to help her if she doesn't take care of the pups herself?  If she tries to push and nothing comes out within an hour, it could be an emergency and she might need a C-section.  I'd call your vet or emergency hospital just in case.|`|d3b6fdf2d631c2f5712339448db9e43caa	yes, she's in labor. leave her alone, and the pups will come. keep an eye on her once she starts giving birth, and be prepared to call the vet if anything, i mean anything goes wrong. congrats!|`|savPsYWjaa	If you don't eat the placenta, the puppies will die.|`|cwqB4j0uaa	what you need to do is take her to the VET first and foremost and then the rest will follow!!but u need to find out first instead of she actually going into labor and u not being prepared for it =)|`|oEdgddQPaa	leave the dog dont disturb unless its screaming my dog delivered 4 puppies through the night buy her self a yorkie  good luck|`|47rMSA3paa	Either that...or...shes dieing...:(  How old is she anyways?

AQsiugSpaa	Hi there,    Terramycin Antibiotic Ophthalmic Ointment is the full name of this product.

I have a cat with ocular herpes and the treatment was anti-viral drugs and antibiotics in addition. You should not use any medication that has steroids in it either, as steroids can make the condition much worse.    I would suggest taking your cat to an eye specialist for the right kind of treatment.    Additionally, you can give your cat 500 mg of L-Lysine daily.

The dog pulled very hard trying to yank it's tail out.  Which broke it's "tailbone" or pelvis.  The vet couldn't do anything about it.    I made my dog as comfortable as possible, gave it aspirin (per the vets advice) and it healed ok in 3 or 4 weeks.

She has told me to do shorter strokes instead of stroking the whole length of her body.  I've also noticed I can tell when she's getting overstimulated and I will stop petting her for a while.    So far this has worked great for me.  Hope this helps you out.|`|rpA9y3Wuaa	My cat does that sometimes. just tell her   'NO" when she does it.|`|RAtgv9GHaa	I just got bit by a neighbors cat.I still have the "ouch".

FvAl3UgQaa	No, don't. It's totally normal for male RES to have very long nails/claws - it's one feature that is used to distinguish between the two sexes.|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	Never trim them. How would you like it if somebody cut off your secondary sexual characteristics?|`|b5b08a7f14d2315049ad9f67246d2a56aa	do not trim them...you have a male RES, all males have long toenails  on the front legs, when they court a female they put their "hands" in front  of the female and wiggle their fingers at her|`|McjaM0hDaa	i would go to a professional and see what they think. but i trim my box turtles nails. and am sure at some point you would have to.|`|vS1Z0inOaa	It's true that box turtles and land tortoises sometimes need their toenails trimmed. This is due to the fact that in captivity they usually have very soft soil for burrowing, whereas in the wild they have to walk long distances foraging for food and dig into hard soil. So pet land turtles' toenails don't get worn down naturally and have to be trimmed. However, aquatic turtles onl use theirs for courting, gripping on while mating, and maybe for gripping on as they pull themselves out of the water onto a basking log. They don't walk on hard soil much and they don't use their toenails to tear/dig up food, so their toenails naturally don't get much wear. On top of this, like others have said, its normal for male RES to have long front claws. I have never trimmed my aquatic turtles' toenails, no matter what, except for one case where the nails were curling wrong and were poking him in the bottom of his foot. I wouldn't advise it unless it's one of thos rare times where it's obviously uncomfortable for him like in the aforementioned case.|`|AXTUWKwcaa	No don't trim them|`|ZQS2Q6cXaa	you don't have to trim them, its more of a preference. if you want them trimmed, go to a professional.|`|hMR2L2gfaa	no, your not supposed to trim them. they have them so they can grab things and stuff also maybe for protection...so i wouldn't trim them :)

Chocolate can be deadly.|`|YaOzRFhkaa	I have a cat myself, I am not a vet or anything, but I love cats and do a lot of research on them. Take her to the vet if she is sick. Chocolate is actually poisonous for cats and dogs, so don't give them any. Chocolate doesn't always make cats and dogs very sick, but it can and they are not eat it. Don't try to make her sick to get the chocolate out. Cat know how to take care of them-self, they are very independent. Also another tip is to never start giving your cat canned cat food, because some cat foods have an ingredient used in foreign countries to make plastic. My grandmas friends had cats that almose died from eating canned cat food. And my cat good very sick and had a huge seizure from eating fancy feast canned cat food one time. And I never give her canned cat food and she has never had a seizure before. But yeah she should be fine.

If your cat is violent and hurting the kitten you would want to separate them but it should just take time to get used to the whole idea of him not being the center of attention and eventually they will coexist.|`|OfL7FjA0aa	try keeping your kitten in a small room when it first comes home and introduce it to the old cat gradually with monitered play sessions, if your olds cat is an indoor cat it probably never sees other kittys and ws scared, after about a week try letting it out for a day if it gets beat on try again with the little room kick sometimes its easist to get a little tough cat and let them fight one of them will back down eventually (never let them hurt each other) and they will stay away from each other
Y3c1DRYKaa	firstly well done for re-homing a dog, he has  had a lot of change in his life, my advise would to buy a good quality natural dog food put a little down in a bowl, if he doesn't eat it after 10mins take it away again, offer it to him again in a few hour time, keep this up for a couple of days, to much choice is not helpful to dogs, if he hasn't eaten after a couple of days get the vet to check him out, though i am sure he is just nervous and having to get used to a completely different home life. Good luck|`|Fu7OK54kaa	Stick to one food and keep it on a routine, like fill bowl at 8:00am and take bowl away (full or empty) at 10:00 and put full bowl down again at 6:00 and take away at 8:00. Doesn't matter what times, that depends on you but it needs to be constant. Hope it helps!    Also, dry food is best because it uses their teeth and keeps them good and strong :B|`|78Xb7enMaa	Dogs don't take well to changes in diet which should be introduced gradually if possible. Perhaps you could cut out the treats and put down a little food at a time? He should always have access to fresh drinking water which I'm sure you already know. Puppies will not starve themselves so maybe he's just settling in. If he seems unwell he should see a Vet, otherwise I'm sure he'll start eating when he feels settled.
c76c3ee25732c42579fccc8f6af2e8ffaa	For the third time, no.
c76c3ee25732c42579fccc8f6af2e8ffaa	NONE.  Mixing species is NEVER recommended.
c76c3ee25732c42579fccc8f6af2e8ffaa	No way.  A 20 gallon is good for an adult crested.  And day geckos are EASILY stressed out.  Being housed with an active, nocturnal animal will not allow him to sleep, and he could be attacked during the night.  Also, the temps required by day geckos are too hot for a crested.    Housing different species in such a small tank, or at all, is just asking for trouble.  They are going to stress each other out and make each other sick.  I'd say that the crested would be likely to attack a day gecko during the night, too.  If you want a day gecko, get a different tank.  It's just a bad idea.|`|bG3cHE3eaa	Yes they should get along.

MmyOgpO0aa	A yorkie is a good dog. They tend to bark alot though. They also have thin hair, which most of the time regardless of how much you wash it will smell. You have to walk them lots because they are so full of energy, can be quite hyperactive.  A regular yorkie is larger than a tea cup yorkie. I think the regular yorkie is a better size than the tea cup.     I personally think the tea cup is too small, a friend of mine has one and I feel like I am going to stand on it and squash it all the time (if I did, it would be very hurt that's how small they are). You can pick it up with one hand, its very light. You can't leave sliding doors or anything like that the smallest bit open because they will get out. Really really slow to walk too because of their size.    Yorkshire terriers are good dogs but remember they are terriers and terriers are bread to hunt for things. I have two terriers and they 'hunt' for insects all the time and dig (they even try to dig on my bed!) Very cute dogs but the constant barking is annoying.|`|PM23RDycaa	One is real and one is not.    There is no such thing as a teacup ANYTHING.    Yorkies should be between 4 and 7 lbs but overall can bee above or below this range. THIS is the range that is healthiest for their size    http://ytca.org/faq.html A - What the breed club has to say.

Labels like "teacup" are just used by irresponsible breeders to sell a sickly runt for a higher price.|`|uBFhKXgHaa	It's a good dog for someone who's lifestyle it fits in with.    The difference is that a 'regular' Yorkie exists, while a teacup Yorkie does not.    There is no such thing as a 'teacup'. They are not recognized as an actual breed size, the smallest breed size recognized is toy. All 'teacup' dogs are are the runts of toy dogs bred together by backyard breeders to create tiny, sickly dogs with a cutesey name tacked on. They are scams, and only backyard breeders breed them.     Please don't support the backyard breeders and mill breeders who produce these poor animals. You will only end up with a short lived, sickly dog that will cost you an absolute fortune in vet bills.

Of course, as the owner of several, I'm a bit biased there... ;)    There is no such thing as a "teacup" Yorkie.  It's a marketing term used by unethical breeders to describe dogs bred to be extremely tiny...something that no reputable breeder would do.    Regardless to if you decide on a Yorkie or another breed, please take the time to educate yourself on the breed as much as possible before you actively start to look for one.  Having a general knowledge of the breed will give you a better idea of what expectations to have when you do own one.  Also, it will enable you to determine if a dog you are considering is a quality representation of the breed, will tell you what breed specific issues you should look out for and be aware of, and help you to spot shady breeders.|`|eBBHHJltaa	Nothing. The term "teacup" is just a marketing ploy. They're usually the sickly runt of the litter, that's all.|`|WbRhr0OYaa	There is no difference except health issues. There is no such thing as a "teacup" anything. They are just sickly runts bred with other sickly runts to make more sickly runts. No reputable breeder would breed "teacups". I would recommend looking on www.petfinder.com to find a yorkie. Many yorkies end up in shelters so think about adopting one. I have been around many yorkies that have come through the shelter where I worked. They are sweet dogs but very noisy and demanding. Due to their size I wouldn't recommend them for a child. They tend to be nippy towards young kids. Plus kids can get too rough and hurt such a small dog. Please do research before adopting any dog and do not support backyard breeders. If you see anything with "teacup" run the other way.|`|M3DF5zoLaa	teacups are very small and typically cost more.|`|gz5O9Tbpaa	Yorkies come in ONE size. O.N.E. All of the other terms are complete crap, teacup, mini, micro, etc. They are huge red flags that you are looking at a poorly bred runt from a BYB that couldnt care less about her animals. These BYBs are TRYING to TRICK you into paying more for a dog. PLEASE do more research and dont fall for their scam!!    But other than that, yorkies are great dogs!! Make sure you do your research (as you obviously need to do anyway abut the teacup thing) so you know what their needs are.

If you live in the city, there is good chance that something happened to it. But don't lose hope. Ask neighbors and others in your area if they have seen him. Check shelters and vet clinics.     Think of the good times. If you get another cat learn from your mistakes. Go to the vet and have your cat micro chipped so you can track it when it runs away.

It needs to be grained way more than the pasture calves.  I'm ussuming you want a steer since your wanting to make "sale" after the show.  Most ppl buy their calves in November, they should already be broke to lead by now, since most weigh-in's are in the middle of February.  I am also going to assume that your show is in the summer.  In that case you will want a spring born calf.  I prefer black with a lot of hair.  You want  em thick in the front and the back.  Make sure they are sound, long bodied, hooks to pins even, good depth, none that are tight hearted or bucked over.  A good level top line, straight legged but not post legged.  Make sure they don't toe out or walk choppy, the list goes on and on.  The price can go anywhere from $1,000 on up.  The biggest cost will be in feed and hair cair products.  You will also need a blower, fans, trim chute, health papers, halters, show stick, show box, and clipper.  Age doesn't matter when you are selling, it just needs to have a good finish on.  You will also need to join 4-H.  You will need to attend at least half of the meetings and have 6 hours of beef meetings to be able to exhibit at the county fairs.  Beef breeds don't matter, crossbreds will be shown in a commercial class.  Just be sure to avoid too much navel, ear, dewlap.  Hope I helped some, email me if not:)
w1lh1INHaa	Many companies provide that info on their sites, but if not, you can figure it out yourself.     To calculate the  approximate weight of the carbohydrate in a food, add up the values for moisture, protein, fat, fiber, and ash and subtract this value from 100%.  Here is an example from the PetGuard website for their Organic Chicken and Vegetable Entree:    GUARANTEED ANALYSIS:  Crude Protein 9.0% Min  Crude Fat 7.0% Min  Crude Fiber 1.0% Max  Moisture 78.0% Max  Ash 2.3% Max    If we add up the above figures, and then subtract this value from 100%, we come up with a rough idea of the carbohydrate content of this food: 3%.    But we are not finished yet.  The value of 3% needs to be converted to a 'dry matter basis' (DMB) for accuracy.  This calculation takes the water component out of the equation and then allows values for canned and dry foods to be comparable. See here for an explanation of dry matter basis.    For the DMB value, we see that there is 78% water in this food.  That leaves 22% as dry matter.  If we take our 3% and divide it by 22% we come up with 14% carbohydrates (by weight) on a dry matter basis.  With further calculations to compute the calories from carbohydrates, we come up with a value of 11%.    Calculating the percentage of calories from the carbohydrate part of the diet can be done with a few equations (shown below).      When calculating the percentage of calories derived from the proteins, fats and carbohydrates in a high quality food, we know that 4 calories are contributed by every gram of carbohydrate.  For every gram of protein, 4 calories are provided and for every gram of fat, 9 calories are added.  Do not use the human equivalent of 4.5 for protein or carbohydrate, as pet food is a lower quality protein and carbohydrate.      For these calculations, you don't have to worry about converting the values to DMB  since the water content does not matter when looking at the percent-of-calories issue.      We will use the PetGuard example above - keeping in mind the limitations for accuracy when using GA numbers:     GUARANTEED ANALYSIS:  Crude Protein 9.0% Min  Crude Fat 7.0% Min  Crude Fiber 1.0% Max  Moisture 78.0% Max  Ash 2.3% Max     9% of this food is made up of protein (9 grams of protein per 100g of food) so 9 X 4 = 36 calories from protein.  Repeating the calculation for the 7% fat, we get 7 X 9 = 63 calories and from our calculations above, we know that this food is 3% carbohydrates.  3 X 4 = 12 calories from carbohydrates.    36 + 63 + 12 = 111 total calories per 100 grams of food    To calculate the percentage of overall calories from each food source, divide each amount by the total calories:    Protein: 36 divided by 111 = 32%    Fat:  63 divided by 111 = 57%    Carbohydrate:  12 divided by 111 = 11%    To double-check your math, add up the percentages to make sure they equal 100%.    32% + 57% + 11% = 100%|`|K0uTjeWiaa	I don't think I have natural life but I have many others and will give them here,  http://www.geocities.com/jmpeerson/dryfo...  http://www.geocities.com/jmpeerson/canfo...     If you are worried about weight, there are good and bad calories and the the thing would be to feed species appropriate food and not dry foods        Nutrition since there are so many bad things out there is very important to your cats health  Contrary to what you may have heard; dry foods are not a great thing to feed a cat.   Please read the label on what you are feeding? What are the ingredients? Do you know what they mean? Is the first ingrediant a muscle meat like chicken or meal or other things?  http://www.catinfo.org/ Learn_How_To_Rea...  http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04...  Dry foods are the number 1 cause of diabetes in cats as well as being a huge contributing factor to kidney disease, obesity, crystals, u.t.is and a host of other problems. Food allergies are very common when feeding dry foods. Rashes, scabs behind the tail and on the chin are all symptoms  The problems associated with Dry food is that they are loaded with grains and carbohydrates which many cats (carnivores) cannot process.  Also, Most of the moisture a cat needs is suppose to be in the food but in  Dry, 95% of it is zapped out of dry foods in the processing. Another thing, most use horrible ingredients and don't use a muscle meat as the primary ingredient and use vegetable based protein versus animal. Not good for an animal that has to eat meat to survive.  http://www.catinfo.org/ My_Cat_is_Doing_...  You want to pick a canned food w/o gravy (gravy=carbs) that uses a muscle meat as the first ingredient and doesn't have corn at least in the first 3 ingredients if at all.      THE  BEST CAT FOODS CONTAIN NO GRAINS NO BYPOODUCTS NO MEAL  Cats are meat eaters not cereal or rice eaters   Fancy feast is a middle grade food with 9lives, friskies  whiskas lower grade canned and wellness and merrick upper grade human quality foods. I would rather feed a middle grade canned food then the top of the line dry food.   Also, dry food is not proven to be better for teeth.

Vetinarian diets  The reason your vet thinks so highly of the pet food they sell probably has more to do with money than nutrition. In vet school, the only classes offered on nutrition usually last a few weeks, and are taught by representatives from the pet food companies.

Instead, I'd look into a higher quality cat food. NaturalLife is not a good quality food to be feeding your cat.    Not all pet food is made equally. A lot of it is full of corn, by-products, dyes, unhealthy preservatives, filler grains and all sorts of nasty stuff. A lot of pet food companies are perfectly happy to the dump cheap leftovers and things that aren't safe for human consumption (from human food processing plants) into their foods. Will it kill your cat? No, it has to be nutritionally complete and safe to even be marketed. Is it healthy? Not by a long shot.    Corn is a low quality ingredient you never want to see in your pet food. Corn and low quality grains are two of the biggest culprits when it comes to food allergies in our pets.    Thankfully, there are some excellent cat foods being made these days that include organic, human grade ingredients rather than trash not fit for human consumption.    Examples of low quality foods to avoid: Anything you can find in a grocery store will be low end, Purina, Iams, Eukanuba, Science Diet, Royal Canin, Whiskas, Fancy Feast, Friskies, Meow Mix.    Examples of high quality foods to look for: Innova, Wellness, Solid Gold, Felidae, Fromm Four Star, Merrick, GO Natural, Nature's Variety Prairie, Nature's Logic, Artemis Fresh Mix, Timber Wolf Organics.    Although the high quality foods are more expensive, you're getting what you're paying for. Less filler material means more concentrated nutrients... this means you typically need to feed far less of the high quality food than you would of the low quality one. Which also means less poop!    Seriously on a budget? Two of the most affordable of the higher quality foods would be Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul and Felidae.    Before following your vet's food recommendation, keep in mind that vets get /very/ little nutritional training during their schooling. Besides that, what training they /do/ get is usually sponsored or taught by the crappy pet food companies! They also often get paid to sell some of their products at their clinics (Science Diet, Royal Canin etc.)    A great option is to go with an entirely grainless diet. Diets high in grain/carbohydrates have been attributed to problems with diabetes in cats. Cats are obligate carnivores, so why should there be grain in their diet? Many of the high quality foods now put out grainless formulas. Some good grainless diets include: Innova EVO, Wellness CORE, Blue Wilderness, Nature's Variety Instinct, Orijen, Horizon Legacy, Merrick Before Grain, Fromm Surf & Turf, Now!, Sold Gold Indigo Moon, Ziwipeak, and Taste of the Wild.    Some pretty decent foods can even be found in common pet stores. Petsmart carries Blue Buffalo products (such as the excellent grain free diet Blue Wilderness). Petco carries Wellness, Solid Gold, Natural Balance, Eagle Pack Holistic Select, Blue Buffalo, Castor & Pollux Organix, Pinnacle, and Halo.     If you can't find a food, most of the high quality cat food brands have websites with store locators on them that will help you find the store closest to you which supplies their products. Simply type the cat food brand's name into Google, go to their website, and type your zip code into their store locator.    Another option, if you can't find anywhere around you that sells good foods, is to order your pet food online. Here's an excellent place to do so: http://www.petfooddirect.com/store/    Remember that foods should be switched gradually (mixing the new slowly in with the old over the period of about week or so), especially when switching to a higher quality one, so as not to upset tummies. For example:  Days 1 & 2: 75% old food, 25% new food  Days 3 & 4: 50% old food, 50% new food  Days 5 & 6: 25% old food, 75% new food  Day 7: 0% old food, 100% new food    Another option for feeding cats is to feed raw. This is something that should be thoroughly researched before being attempted:  http://www.rawfedcats.org/ (Excellent raw feeding information for cats)  http://www.rawfed.com/ (More excellent raw feeding information)  http://www.rawfed.com/myths/index.html (Myths about raw feeding)    Now the question is, do you feed wet or dry? Wet is the correct answer. The reason is, in the wild, cats normally get most of their water content directly from their prey items and drink very little. Domestic cats are no different, and because of the fact that they are designed to take in water with their meal, they have a very low thirst drive. Cats often just don't drink enough. This leads to urinary tract infections and crystals. The bit about dry food being better for teeth is a myth and has not been proven in the least (cats barely even chew their dry food and, really, does a pretzel clean /your/ teeth? Cats should have their teeth brushed with cat toothbrushes and cat toothpaste at least a few times a week as well as see the vet for dental cleanings when necessary /regardless/ of what they are being fed). Canned/wet food is better because it more closely mimics the cat's natural diet.

F3FrZ7eAaa	First off, male or female?    Some great unisex names, which I'm completely in love with are names after cities, and countries. Or just areas in general I guess. It can even be personal if you have memories in that place, or related with the breed. Here's some examples: India, Brooklyn, Arizona, London, Paris, Asia, Dallas, Denver, Phoenix, and Vegas. You might want to name him/her after a city in Switzerland, since they're Swiss. I looked at a map, here's some possibilities: Basel, Glarus, Stans, Sion, Geneva, Sarnen, Lausanne. Not too bad, right?     Anyway, good luck! Hope this helped.|`|7vJNHaskaa	I always liked the name Bear. Especially cause he's a big dog. :D

Good luck|`|YVP9vTi1aa	So.. you own the pet shop?    Not alot of people decide to buy from Pet Shops. They are known to care less about the kitten's health, what kind of home the kitten should go to, and whether or not the kitten needs particular attention.  Just as to go on to the internet and decide to ask a bunch of people on a website how much a kitten should sell for instead of seeking out an answer yourself.    I think you should sell the kittens for 75.    Please do NOT negotiate with people, unless they look responsible enough or have good and reliable pointers.    The price is expensive, even though the kitten is a moggie. But this is to ensure the person can afford the kitten.    If they cannot afford the price, don't sell it for a lesser price. If they can't afford the kitten, they will not be able to afford the cost of yearly vaccination/health, food, and cattery bills.    Please think about this. :-)|`|gM7VuCM4aa	I wouldn't pay anymore than $50 but than again I wouldn't purchase from a pet shop and I wouldn't purchase a moggy either.|`|uBFhKXgHaa	Whatever price the local shelter is adopting them out for.

Darksong~|`|1ad7aa5Caa	Free. Or no more than ten bucks.|`|PfmXPbFpaa	so you sell kittens for a living? and then you don't know what they are worth? or maybe i am reading it wrong.      did you breed the kittens yourself?  do you know who did? are they a reputable breeder?    if they aren't i would say free or the cost of the first vaccine.    Let's face it, you wouldn't know their family history, you wouldn't know their medical history, you wouldn't know their disposition.  If they were raised  in a cattery (or conditions of overcrowding) they may be sick or diseased.  I am not saying this is the case for you, but if this is, I cannot justify selling them for much.|`|PGkbPBZmaa	With only a first vaccination, not much at all. You should give more vaccinations and deworming, and at the very least you should spay or neuter the kitten before rehoming, this is the reason why you got the kitten in the first place. 60 bucks with more shots out of the way and spaying and neutering.
w1lh1INHaa	You can sprinkle a little Metamucil on the food (psyllium hulls) -- it is what vets recommend first.  If that doesn't work, a little milk as the lactose will help soften stool (and is way cheaper than a lactose based med from the vet).      If this is just a once-in-a-blue-moon incident, those will do the trick.  If this continues, or you see blood in the stool for more than a day or so, then you might want to see the vet.  Constipation could be a result of too much dry food in the diet, worms/parasites, or something more serious.|`|cff06890d4173c156cdcc883215f12bcaa	Yep, a little milk can actually soften the stool.  Too much will usually cause diarrhea.  A little canned pumpkin or metamucil in wet food can also help.  It is not common for them to become constipated.  Try to determine the cause--too much hair ingested?  Use a petlax more frequently.  Otherwise, check in with your vet.|`|45b08ca1dc880690ca7764657e05b376aa	Give the cat a tiny bit of milk to drink.|`|UBS4jIAcaa	drown it ,buy another one|`|OfL7FjA0aa	Try consulting your vet if it doesn't get better with milk|`|g7karw44aa	A phone call to the Veterinarian is free.  There are plenty of clinics open on the weekend and after hours.  They are medical professionals who can give you safe suggestions.  Strangers who might have little or no knowledge of animals cannot diagnose your cat over the computer.    How do you know he is constipated?  If he hasn't defecated, that doesn't necessarily mean he is simply constipated.  He could have an intestinal blockage, parasites, gastrointestinal infection that is causing the intestines to stop moving, or any number of other problems.    Giving any medication or other at home treatments can potentially cause more harm than good.  If you don't know 100% for sure what the actual problem is, you don't want to start trying things.    Giving treatments for constipation if there is a problem with the intestines can cause them to rupture, become severely inflamed and potentially kill your cat.    A phone call is free.  Please give your Vet or whichever 24 hour or emergency clinic is open a call.|`|ef24d5d199381427fa9d32357dfe59bfaa	a friend of mine- on orders from his vet- gave his cat pumpkin. like libby's pie filling in a can.  his cat was in the litter box a day later
oOfTCWlEaa	Chinchillas naturally make quite odd distinguishable sounds, like barking and grunting.  Typically a chin will do this when it is scared, startled, or trying to find a mate.    Do not worry about it, it is not abnormal or anything, just funny to listen to.    Here is a site that might help you out  http://www.chinchilla-sounds.de/index_en...|`|cff06890d4173c156cdcc883215f12bcaa	They are capable of making lots of sounds.  Here is a really good site with info about this:    http://www.chincare.com/HealthLifestyle/...|`|2Go0Y0xnaa	He is not having a seizure, and even if he was, a TUMS will accomplish nothing.  He is sending out a distress call.  Chinchillas are herd animals, even when they aren't in an actual herd.  The instinct to protect and warn the herd is still there.  That noise you are hearing is telling you that something is alarming him and he is warning "the herd."      Some chins just do that for no apparent reason.  I can be laying on the couch, and all is quiet, and suddenly a lone chin in the chin annex will start barking out a warning.      Relax, it's normal.  :)|`|bTvrv59saa	HE'S HAVING A SEIZURE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Feed him half a tum! Quick! Every month feed him 1/4. I have two. My male does that too. Or it could be just a wild scream but most likely the first thing.
uBFhKXgHaa	Your vet advised you to feed your obligate carnivore veggies? Time to find a new vet. Not really very surprising though, as vets get painfully little nutritional training during their veterinary schooling.    Ditch the veggies. They are not species appropriate.    Stick with a high quality wet food fed twice daily.    Examples of low quality foods to avoid: Anything you can find in a grocery store will be low end, Purina, Iams, Eukanuba, Science Diet, Royal Canin, Whiskas, Fancy Feast, Friskies, Meow Mix.    Examples of high quality foods to look for: Innova, Wellness, Solid Gold, Felidae, Fromm Four Star, Merrick, GO Natural, Nature's Variety Prairie, Nature's Logic, Artemis Fresh Mix, Timber Wolf Organics.      Edit: Cubby, Science Diet (and Nature's Best) are crappy, low quality cat foods. Hate to break it to you, but it's true.    Darksong~|`|1ad7aa5Caa	A cat, which is carnivorous, does not naturally go around eating green beans. I'd just start cutting back on your cat's food every day until you reach the amount for a healthy cat, about one or  one and a half cups. Cats need high protein foods. If he doesn't get the protein, it could upset his system.     Just make sure that the cat food he is eating has protein as the number one ingredient at least. Also, go for ones without corn or corn products. That's a filler.|`|AA11736483	Your vet is either kidding you or is a quack! Cats cannot metabolize vegetables - they are strict carnivores. If your cat is overweight, you are probably free feeding dry food. Gradually switching to regular feeding of wet food along with some exercise is a better solution.|`|HwujORd2aa	Wow, that cat is HUGE, especially for its age!  Get a high quality food, and only feed the recommended amount for the healthy size he's estimated to be as an adult. The other important thing is to get him to move.  Get a laser pointer and some fishing pole toys and get him moving for at least 10 minutes twice a day.   I don't think they need veggies-it's really more about the calorie count, and feed the best quality food you can (from a specialty pet store-it's more expensive-but you'll have knowledgable people there and generally better, cleaner food to choose from).  I do have one cat that likes broccoli and spinach, but it's just fed as a treat.   Good luck.  He's gonna drive you CRAZY when you cut back on the food. Stick with it though.  He's a baby and has such a long life ahead of him if he can get the weight off.|`|PfmXPbFpaa	Did your vet say you could flavor them with something like the juice from their wet food or something like tuna?  that might help.|`|OfL7FjA0aa	I would try the same green veggies as dogs,  Broccoli green beans carrots any other kinds a dog can eat...usually|`|VDP3pNCPaa	I would start with a new vet. Dogs are all right with veggies, but they are not really appropriate for cats.  Yes, some of the newer "natural" cat foods show vegetables on the package, but if you look at the ingredient list, they really are minimal.  Cats are carnivores, and their body is designed for meat.    Weight reduction is done with calorie restriction and perhaps food that has added fiber to make them feel full without the calories.  But it is food formulated for cats.    Weight reduction is done gradually. To get your cat down to a more reasonable weight is measured in many, many months.  I would expect several years would be needed.|`|l1dAq3pOaa	Science Diet has a dry food made from veggies and chicken.  It's called Nature's Best.  My cat eats everything but the peas. He puts them on the floor by his dish!  He also likes lettuce once in a while but is crazy for fruit like mango, peaches apricots, bananas, grapes and melon (canteloupe)|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Many cats like green beans.  If he won't eat the regular kind, try the french style where its more shredded.
XK9RLaPeaa	Im glad you are feeding him outside, and not trying to catch him to be a pet. You can buy some carrots at the grocery store for him. They also like broccoli. But dont give him too much, because he wont go out to search for his own food. If you ever moved away and stopped feeding him, he wouldnt remember how to find food for himself. But a few treats here and there wont hurt anything. Good luck!|`|F3FrZ7eAaa	Well, rabbits are herbivores meaning they stick to a diet consisting of no meat. So, all greens should be okay for them. Lettuce, carrots and a variety of vegetables. Try hay too, they like it a lot! Also, if you wanted you can pick up some pellets from the petstore to feed him.    Good luck.|`|8GDd6lrnaa	you can pickup some rabbit pellets or something with grain mix. he will appreciate it in cold weather. more nutrients to keep him warm.|`|ke9xPnsNaa	CARROTS!!!!!!! lol

Our two cats prefer sleeping on people's beds, especially when the bed isn't made. Both of our cats never took to cat beds.     Try to put the bed in a dark, cozy corner of the house where you rarely walk by. If you expect the cat to like going into it in the kitchen, you're silly. I'd suggest someone's bedroom or closet that always has an open door.|`|c88Z21chaa	cats have a mind of their own, and wont sleep in a cat bed if they dont want to. just let thew cat sleep somewhere else.  however, if it is a fear, just leave the bed somewhere without moving it or acknowledging it and the cat will grow accustomed to its presence. Maybe feed the cat IN the bed after a while, nothin like comfort food :p    just to help though, dont permanently feed ur cat in its bed lol it will end up obese    xo|`|o0VyLaPiaa	Then don't give him or her one.|`|7y3Fwrniaa	My cat does not like her cat bed but she is not afraid of it what she really likes is the box the 24 bottle water comes in she loves them she'll sleep it it for hours.|`|V9G3zvzZaa	o_0 That's the first time I've ever heard of a cat scare of a cat bed.

a03e19c2c6feed0e49819e0271f97e78aa	Yes. American shorthair cats are the best mousers. You should not have to teach it, though. I think their hunting is pure instinct.    Other qualities include good health, very little grooming needs and overall friendliness.|`|gM7VuCM4aa	Maine Coon cats are noted for being excellent mousers. Many Maine and New England farms still have them for this purpose. They are extremely large, the largest domestic breed and can reach weights of 20 lbs +. I had one named Big Bear and he jumped up and caught a bat in mid air once, inside the house! I didn't let him kill it, it was stunned enough so I could put it in a paper bag outside. I was so grateful because when they are flying around they are so...EW! Plus some Maine Coons have double paws, so they have these great big mitts to pounce with.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	IMO your best mouser come from farms and barn cats where mom teaches the kittens hunting.  Our cat is from barn cats.  While she has never hunted, her mom was an excellant hunter.     I know if a mouse or bird got in the house, Ling would not waste time in catching it and killing it.  She has a strong prey drive.  I would never buy a pet mouse and bring into the house.|`|WKcC0Qayaa	they need all of their claws, and to have some experience hunting - unfortunately many abandoned cats have no real hunting experience.  We have two from the bound (and one other cat), and none of them associate little animals with food.  They think that they are toys.    you want one that is not too thin, but on the thinner side.  they should be active, and less than 5 years old - younger would be better.    instead of the pound, you might want to get a farm cat - they have to hunt to survive.|`|4a2eee5eefa1d6701c73d4bd94101010aa	There's probably no sure way of telling.  I would think that putting something moving (like a string or a cat toy you can drag around) in front of the kitty to see if how fast the movement grabs it's attention and how eager the cat is to hunt the thing down would be slightly indicative.  But many well-cared for cats will chase down mice and birds, they won't always kill them (they'll just bring it home to you "see what I got you?") since they don't see the things as food.  And it's not necessarily a breed thing (although abandoned "alley" cats have had to fend for themselves so they've developed hunting and killing skills).  If you can see how good a mouser the mom is, that'd be good--kits learn how to hunt and how to kill from their moms, and it is a learned skill so the more practice they have, the better they get at it.  If you can, spend some time with the cat you think you might want, go back for several visits and just test how readily it tries to jump on moving toys and string and things (maybe tie one of those toy mice to some string and drag it around like the mouse is running for it's life).|`|YMSAv2LUaa	Me, personally, thinks it runs in the genes. My grandma's cat Seal could snag a bat out of the air. I now have Seal's grandson and daughter. The grandson caches mice and birds (which I dislike strongly). On the other hand Cuddles (the granddaughter) is the laziest cat I've seen. As a kitten, she was the shy and "runt" of the litter. She wouldn't hurt a fly.    Daniel, the good mouser was very playful and energetic as a kitten. Usually the "wimp" of the litter will not become a good mouser.    It usually depends on the personality of the cat and how good of mousers their parents were.    BTW, if you're looking for a cat that eats mice, its pretty rare to find it. Daniel occasionally eats his catch but only to show-off to me. Cuddles is a picky eater and won't get near it. Depends on how the cats were raised, too. If the cat was raised as an indoor cat, there is probably no chance of the cat killing mice. But my grandma's cats were half-feral, so they are the best mousers I've seen.    Also, if you want you're cat to catch mice, don't spoil it with cat food. I'm not saying starve it, but if it gets hungry it will find something to eat. After it catches a mouse, don't give it more cat food, (as to make sure the cat eats its catch) and pet it a lot and praise him verbally to let it know how proud you are of it.    Overall, palyful, "type A" personality barn cats are your best bet.|`|56e0ac9f997cfe07a2c89aa1d28490daaa	Genes do not play a part in a kitten for it to grow into a good mouser.  Circumstances in its growing, formative months impart the mousing skills by its mother when its mother is allowed to bring up the kitten in a full course of natural training for survival...  When easy food is not readily supplied to the mother-cat by human, then,  the mother-cat feels the need to educated its child to hunt for their survivals. Cat hunts and  eats all moving creatures much smaller than its size.  The characteristics of a potential, good mouser is one that you do see as one that is always alert and particularly playful.|`|OltGGE47aa	I think it really depends on the individual cat in many ways! I know some breeds are better for hunting/mousers than others, but the only boy cat I have is also the the only American ShortHair I have and he is huge and muscley but the biggest cry baby/wimp we have!
W2GcDwyOaa	Ferrets that are older are right tame and sweet, with baby Ferrets (or Kits) they are a bit nippy and jumpy but they are a bundle of fun and add more fun as you'll have a whole life to look forward to with her/him. Ferrets usually live 8 to 10 years. I own an Albino 5 month old, she is very jumpy and playful but she's very sweet and she likes to cuddle up next to me and sleep. It don't matter about gender as all Ferrets (store bought or rescued older Ferrets) are fixed (spayed and descented). I give my Ferret Purina Kitten and Meow Mix and I make sure that she has her vitasol vitamins and snacks and she loves to play in paper and plastic bags. Ferrets are very curious, playful and very energetic and they are a lot of fun!    I've had Ferrets since before my birth (dad had them and now I have them) and they never cease to amaze me.

WAilZ39maa	Congratulations, ferrets are cool too!!! You don't have to read all of this but I only put the IMPORTANT STUFF...    Ferrets spend 14 to 18 hours a day sleeping and are naturally crepuscular, meaning they are most active during dusk and dawn. Ferrets are energetic, curious, interested in their surroundings, and often actively solicit play with humans, having a repertoire of behaviors both endearing and difficult for some human owners. Play for a ferret will often involve hide-and-seek games, or some form of predator/prey game in which either the human attempts to catch the ferret or the ferret to catch the human. They also have a strong nesting instinct and will repeatedly carry small objects to hidden locations. It is difficult to predict what objects ferrets will attempt to hoard, with owners reporting play toys, socks, bags of onions, pizza slices, keys, calculators, coins, silverware, aluminum foil, shoes, sponges, toilet paper rolls, textbooks, video game controllers, remote controls, footballs, brooms, pencils, erasers, bouncy balls, cardboard boxes, etc. Ferrets will seemingly form attachments to certain objects and will repeatedly 'steal' the same object and bring it to their hiding place.When ferrets are excited, they may perform a routine commonly referred to as the weasel war dance, a frenzied series of sideways hops. This is often accompanied by a soft clucking noise, commonly referred to as dooking. It is often an invitation to play or an expression of happy excitement and is not threatening. The ferret's posture may become rigid with wide open jaws, momentary eye contact followed by thrashing or turning of the head from side to side, arching the back, piloerection (goosebumps), and hopping to the side or backwards while facing the intended playmate.    Ferrets tend to nip as kits. Nipping is the act of biting in a playful manner representative of mock fighting and sparring; young ferrets are also more prone to chewing and teething, and have a tendency to bite harder. Older ferrets tend to chew far less frequently and, when trained correctly, almost never nip a human hand or only do so very gently. However, ferrets that have been abused or are in extreme pain may bite a human, and are capable of strong bites which break through the skin.    Ferrets, like cats, can use a litter box with training, but they are not always completely litter box trainable. Their instinct is to spread their waste in order to scent mark a wider foraging territory for themselves; thus, multiple litter boxes may be necessary, and all litter areas should be changed frequently.    Ferrets are obligate carnivores. The natural diet of their wild ancestors consisted of whole small prey, i.e., meat, organs, bones, skin, feathers, and fur. Some ferret owners feed a meat-based diet consisting of whole prey like mice and rabbits along with raw meat like chicken, beef, veal, kangaroo and wallaby. This is preferred in Europe and Australia, and becoming increasingly popular in the United States due to concern over high carbohydrate levels in some processed ferret foods.    Alternatively, there are many commercial ferret food products. Some kitten foods can also be used, so long as they provide the high protein and fat content required by the ferret's metabolism; high-quality commercial ferret foods are preferred to kitten foods by many ferret owners because the foods are geared more toward a ferret's metabolism than to a cat's. Most adult cat foods and kitten foods are unsuitable for ferrets however, because of their low protein content and high fiber. Ideally, a ferret food should contain a minimum of 32% meat based protein and 18% fat and a maximum 3% fiber.[22] Low-quality pet foods often contain grain-based proteins, which ferrets cannot properly digest and result in lower nutrition leading to increased food intake and more waste.    Ferrets may have a fondness for sweets like raisins, bananas, peanut butter, and pieces of cereal. The high sugar content of such treats has been linked to ferret insulinoma and other diseases. Veterinarians recommend not feeding these foods to ferrets at all. Also, like many other carnivores, ferrets gradually lose the ability to digest lactose after they are weaned. As a result, lactose-free milk is to be preferred.    READ THIS PART, IT'S AMAZINGLY IMPORTANT: Recliners and fold-out sofas are a leading cause of accidental death in ferrets. Ferrets will often climb inside the springs and can be injured or killed once the chair is put into a reclined position.Ferret curiosity often exceeds common sense and ferrets are good at getting into holes in walls, doors, cupboards, or in or behind household appliances such as clothes dryers and dishwashers, where they can be injured or killed by drowning, electrical wiring, fans, and other household items. Many enjoy chewing items made of soft rubber, foam, or sponge, which present the risk of intestinal blockage and death if ingested. Serious and sometimes fatal injuries have resulted from ferrets chewing on electrical cords. Screen doors can be damaged by a ferret's claws, and dryer vents often become escape routes to the outdoors.    Hope this helps! Good luck!|`|svtJYHM3aa	Awesome to hear your getting a ferret. They are very neat! To answer your question on biting...Babies do bite, but not in a mean way...more like a puppy bites. And like a puppy, they can get rough and not mean to.   I use to own three of them and whenever my baby bit me too hard, I would put a small amount of pressure on her snout and told her sternly "No." That seemed to work just fine for me!   As for helpful advice, the one helpful thing I can think of is the magic of the scruff lol. If your trying to give your ferret a bath, or trying to clip it's nails or any other thing that might make the ferret wiggle, don't be afraid to hold it by the scruff of the neck like you would a cat. This DOESN'T hurt them at all! The ferret will instinctly go limp and will allow you to do whatever you wish!     Well that's all I can think of! Have fun with your new ferret!

ydshiNrKaa	Get him neutered. It probably will help.      For older dogs, neutering may still have the desired effect but marking in the house may have become a habit that you will have to break. Testosterone seems to play a role in urine marking. At least one study has shown that neutering a dog at any age will help prevent it. It can't be  guaranteed that neutering a dog is going to magically cure this problem but if you don't neuter a male dog, your chances of breaking the habit are greatly reduced.    You can try to stop this behavior by supervising your dog.  Catch him in the act! DOGS LEARN QUICKLY FROM THIS    Close supervision is necessary. You must be dedicated to stop the marking behavior of your dog and you must be consistent. A couple of weeks or often much less time of intense supervision and correction can save you a lifetime of tearing your hair out trying to find a quick fix for the problem. Some people have reported that it has only taken a day or two using the intense supervision method.    Confine your dog to one area of the house where you can watch him. Shut doors to other areas of the house or barricade them off with baby gates or improvise with whatever is at hand.    If barricading is not possible another option is to put your dog on a retractable lead while he is in the house with you and for you to have total control at all times.    Make yourself a Shaker Bottle or Shaker Can    Watch your dog for any signs (such as sniffing and circling) that he is even thinking about marking. The moment he begins to lift his leg shake the can once only to get his attention. The loud noise should startle him and interrupt what he is doing. As he looks towards where the noise has come from. Give him the command in a stern voice 'NO PEE'. Sometimes throwing the can in his general direction works well too but be careful not to hit him with it as you only want to startle him not harm him.    If he then turns around and resumes what he was doing, repeat the process. Try to divert his attention with something fun like a game or throw him a ball.    OK, so you have stopped him peeing once. Now you have to be consistent and diligent and continue with the behavior modification each and every time you see him attempt to mark urine.     Do not rant, rave or smack your dog at any time. Punishment will make an insecure dog more insecure.    Don't forget to praise your dog when he marks in an appropriate place. If you are outside and he marks on a tree or other acceptable object or area tell him what a good boy he is. Tell him, 'Pee here, good boy'  in a happy voice. Dogs learn quickly from positive responses to their behavior.     The message you are trying to get across to him is that urine marking isn't bad, but that marking inside the house isn't such a good idea.|`|RFfTjnxzaa	Neutering will not stop him marking in the house. He is improperly housebroken.    I can only suggest re-housetraining him.|`|yjT6ToTCaa	They sell something called a belly band for male dogs online, but getting him fixed is the first and a good step to do. Just google male dog diaper or belly band. They are also pretty easy to make yourself. I used them for my male Italian Greyhounds and I have used them with great results.
u61yKsE3aa	It depends on whats wrong.  Most people I know myself included only take initial rescues to the vet for a check up.  Other than that They are taken only for an as need basis.  THe vet I use charges 45 dollar office visit as a base and then it goes up depending on tests run and treatments done.  If your treating mbd it can get up to hundreds fast if your only treating parasites it canstay lower lesss than 100.00 so it just depends.  Some people take their snake for a yearly check as long as you know what ailments your lookind for this isn't ndo not necc. becasue they do not recieve yearly things like shots.|`|vd8J5r6eaa	I took my burm in for just an annual checkup, no bloodwork no fecal float no nothin just made sure he was healthy and such, and it was about $30 i believe

jhEjIAYGaa	i am a rat owner and went to california for a few weeks recently.  i had a tough time finding a pet sitter for the rat, and when i did, it wasn't cheap.  in my opinion, it was worth it: i knew my rat was going to be cared for in my absence.      however, i understand it may be impractical to arrange for a sitter for your rat.  if you MUST leave your rat alone, put an extra amount of bedding in its cage.  leave a large water bottle for it, and make sure to check it for a few days before you leave to ensure that it doesn't leak and won't run out immediately.  i would put more food than you think your rat will need in something like an open tupperware container.     if you can't get someone to watch your rat, maybe you could arrange for someone just to drop by in the week to check that your rat has sufficient water and food and is doing okay.    good luck.|`|1YYmQI5Naa	Get him a pet sitter. Don't leave it alone.|`|t5Mz1aLvaa	ask a neighbor to watch over it... somebody who you know will take care of the rat and wont try to kill it... also, knows how to take care of rats, unless you leave directions.     or you could take it to a vet place and ask them to watch it for you...     hope this helps|`|vwTyihvvaa	Rats are one group of rodents that cannot be left alone, let alone any rodent.    Rats are highly socialible and need a lot of attention and of course care. You really do need to find someone to pet sit while you are gone.|`|f12Uz4bRaa	Rats are VERY socila animals and are very happy living with there own kind  Get a pet sitter|`|NoGmacqNaa	give it fresh bedding and alot of food and water it should b fine!|`|mbt4topIaa	Ok, before you leave, clean the cage, completely, take a layer of news paper and put it on the bottom... sprinkle baking soda on that and place another layer of news paper on top of it (make sure it is full sheets, not ripped up) next, find a bedding that has excellent odor control, but is dust free, and not wood.  Next, put as much food as possible, I had 4 rats left alone for a week, and put a lot of food in the cage, I had like 2 flower pots, 1 bowl of seed mix, then like 3 large handfuls of lab blocks in the cage.  Next, I took 2 large water bottles filled them and hung them from the cage (I suggest 3 or more).  That took care of the food and water, and kept the smell down, I then took a fan, connected it to a timer, and had it set to turn on for about 3 hours, then off for the rest of the day.  Also, lots of stuff for them to play with, and hide treats among the cage, and in the food piles, gives them something to do.... then when you get back, lots of attention.    Hope this helps|`|A6ritUpHaa	I dont know much about rats (mostly other rodents...) but be sure to leave the essentials:    1) Food  2) Water  3) Toys    I would actually agree with the other person who posted; get a sitter.

r9BXyz9zaa	this is Absolutely not normal. I'm thinking its an infection or maybe a diseases. It somehow reminds me of cancer, with the lump and all, but cancer doesn't form boom- in a week. What ever it is it seems horrible if it is the size of a baseball. If your grandma had a large lump on her belly she wouldn't question going to the doctor, she'd check into the emergency room. I would get that dog into the ER ASAP. The next few days may be critical to her well being. She shouldn't wait until an appointment, this maybe urgent!|`|jPoSQ3Kzaa	I would recommend getting the puppy to the vet asap!! It could be an infection internally and it is important to get her looked at.|`|okAYAGvXaa	This is most likely a reaction to self dissolving sutures. Usually the inner wall only. CALL YOUR VET and keep them posted. This is a "known" issue with this type of stitches. BTW, this happens very often and should NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|C5RdjN57aa	An active dog can get that lump on the incision after a spay. The skin  and the muscle rub together a lot with high activity and that area starts  to fill itself with serum.  If it looks as if the incision area is going to start seeping, Take her to the Vet to get it drained.  Usually just an office visit.  Otherwise, it will eventually go down, and is not at all painful to her.|`|XrEut6S1aa	same thing happened to my dog it will go away soon|`|RFfTjnxzaa	You should take her to the vet.    I would not have taken her back to get spayed by the shelter. I've seen shelters do such butcher-jobs...
ybwqYZ1waa	The best solution is to call the vet. I don't think there r any other solutions to that but leting her sleep and rest her body.|`|lg3MQJsnaa	There really isn't much you can do for her except get her to the vet as soon as possible. I recommend going into an emergency office, but if you wait till tomorrow it could be worse. I really haven't an idea what's wrong with her... Maybe she just kinked her neck?    Keep in mind that smaller dogs tend not to live as long as bigger dogs. Prepare yourself.      Good luck, I hope it turns out okay.|`|WKKdQq2Aaa	Maybe she ate something outside? I would take her to a vet ASAP.|`|VwxX8kDRaa	The head tilting makes me think of an ear infection.  I'd let her sleep with you tonight and watch her, then take her in tomorrow.|`|im3vWyv6aa	I'm with Janeway... I think maybe an ear infection.

It will help with the healing, and MAYBE she won't like the taste/feel of it and will leave it alone.  The Bitter Apple spray is the BEST thing to keep on hand for situations like this.    With the Bitter Apple spray, she won't need a cone at all.....and she'll be less stressed, so may leave the wounds alone......

rApLHbmWaa	I love my dogs so much I wanted my first tatoo to be of them but it costed entirely too much so I looked through the tatoos at the shop and have the artist to make one "kinda" small tattoo out of the three that way it would be original. And even though it consists of flowers, dolphins, water, etc. Everything is laid out to symbalize certain things in my life... My love for animals... the struggles i have been in and the determination that got me through tem.... etc. etc. etc.  Even though it sounds a little tacky and not everyone like flowers, to me what matters it the meaning behind it!   But after the fact I started to think about the dog tatoo again and finally decided that If I get a tattoo of one dog I will want to get a tattoo of every other dog that i get attached to throughout life, and eventually i am going too have no more room left.  But anyway, point being that if you are a huge animal lover like me it would probably be a good idea (as already commented on) to get a dog paw with a message next to it.. Like... "I will forever remember you." or something that reminds you of you every time you see it!  And then later on if you get attached to another dog and it passes away, you will also remember it every time you see the tatoo.  Although they are our babies and if you think you will never be able to become attached to another dog or if this is the one thing that will really helped to get over the pain, i think this is a great idea...  If it so hard to get over the death of such great companions and friends!  God Bless You through this very painful time!  Good Luck with everything and let your heart lead the way!|`|JV0i77uiaa	No,I would not have a tattoo on my dog.  I don't any and I love dog.  One of the reason is hard for the poor dog and the other when dog is gone you will suffer when you see his face.  They are happy with a bone and the love you give them.|`|piZxqLrjaa	not a chance|`|0jQkajfOaa	lol no.|`|pIEI9Rg2aa	hahaah  ^|`|rxPbrEX9aa	that was mean^^^^^^^^|`|KQpDsKh7aa	I would not get a tattoo of my dog. That is just a little strange. get something that represents your dog. like an angel or something|`|alDqf8DAaa	Well you really didn't ask a question, but if you really loved your dog then go for it!  Just make sure he/she was a cute dog haha :)|`|VH07uFuhaa	I personally wouldn't, i would just keep pictures everywhere around my home to remind me of him. But if this is something your passionate about and you feel you need to do then do it. Its your body and if you think a tattoo of your dog will help you show your respect for him than you should do it.|`|69fb08854a4e77f2b45550c526754d26aa	I too have had a dog that I've loved so much..Tattoo? Hmm..Maybe on the inner bicep? ( I didn't spell that right did I?)|`|fe8aa5495caab3873690c07d37e65268aa	I love dogs, but I would never get a tattoo.  I know many people who wish as they got older that they never got one.  I work with the elderly.  You can barely even recognize what the tattoo is of as they get older.    I would just keep the picture of my dog, as I do my favorite dog on my fridge, although he has been gone for many years.  I miss Snorkel.    Whatever your decision, it is yours to make and it is no one elses business.  I find it sweet that you loved your dog.  You do what you want.|`|aein2bCbaa	I'm soo sorry but just a few days ago I was thinking what i ever would do if I ever lost my dachshund Peanut and since his name is Peanut I decided that I'm going to get a tattoo of a peanut on my ankle in honor of him. I suggest that you don't get a tattoo of his face cause it will be pretty big and it'll hurt lol. But maybe a smaller one that represents him, it'll be cheaper too lol. Good Luck :)|`|Sbmte7psaa	If I was still into the tats like I used to be then yes I would definitely get one of all my dogs especially my first dog ever she was the best|`|y46ZQItQaa	Yes , well i would get one of my cats , because i dont have dogs .

(im 14)|`|Kb6eTkbGaa	I absolutely would, if you had your dog printed while he/she was alive you can have his/her paw prints tatted on ya. That's a tad more feminine. Other than that maybe back of a shoulder?|`|SPMS5yIuaa	I would not recommend getting a tattoo of your dog. Get elliott surrounded by stars or something.

But here is some on people....|`|1nn0SaYXaa	I sure do miss my pit bull Captain. I don't think I'd get a tattoo of him but I do understand someone doing that. Especially if you already have tattoos.    It would probably look it's best on your left shoulder just above your shoulder blade, but then you wouldn't be able to see it often.  So that would be your personal preference. If you did do it I'd like to see something like that.|`|uU22GER7aa	Instead of a picture of my Jack russel terrier, Precious, I got her name in chinese on my ankle...    I see nothing wrong with loving your dog so much you would want to do that. Go for it. It's your body and the love is in YOUR heart for your beloved dog.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	I do know a number of ppl who have done it.  Majority are beautiful & some only contain a small piece about their dog like the name or paw print in with another tat.  I have tats but none of my dogs.  At this point I have 7 so it would getting kinda crowded & I couldn't pick just one.  Maybe having their names on a vine among the branches or something would be nice.|`|TpOVmqpHaa	That's what pictures and lockets are for.    A friend of mine had her beloved GSD tattooed on her back and it looked like Scooby Doo on Steroids.  Awful.  Have a portrait painted of him and hang it in a special place.  Carry his photo with you.  You don't need a 'cartoon'on your body to help you remember him.|`|gHi5SVFuaa	I think that is a really great idea. I have had dogs and know how important they can be, so I think you should do it. By the way, are by any chance from Soquel, CA?|`|qIaBOtltaa	No! it's a DOG!! lol :-)|`|ydshiNrKaa	I don't have any dog tattoos but a friend of mine (who is a male) did get his dog tattooed to his upper arm.

Why not carry a pic of him in you wallet or purse.  Sounds like you'll be in a grieving process the rest of your life. A tattoo is permanent.     But ppl put their kids faces on their body.  What's the difference. I don't see the point.|`|j9axB0YMaa	I want one of my dog too! I think I want it on my upper arm because I want to be able to see it. A lot of people get them on there back up by the shoulder.  Who cares if it's not feminine! What since your a chick you can only get tattoos of roses and butterflies?  Oh and to the chick that said old peoples tattoos are all faded, don't worry about that the ink they use now is far supperior to the ink they used 50 years ago. Just don't forget to put sunscreen on it.|`|MJnF0pfFaa	omg no
SPvtrI9jaa	yes! they are very friendly and are easy to look after. try and get a male if you want one because they have a better temperament and are more friendly! they are beautiful little animals!
vwTyihvvaa	Rats by far are the best rodent on this planet!     I have raised over 20 rats at one point and they are clean, intelligent and down right amazing!     Just stick with one rodent of a kind though.|`|FdnShJn9aa	It's not good to mix any rodents together. So yeah, you should keep them seperate. Unless, of course, you don't mind them killing each other|`|Ws2QPD0Iaa	NEVER put them together.  They will definatley fight...    It would be okay to put them in two DIFFERENT aquariums next to eachother, yes.  As long as they don't seem stressed out about being next to eachother.|`|Xl2jpQPcaa	NEVER NEVER NEVER put them in the same aquarium or cage. If you want to put them beside each other, that's fine. just make sure that the rats can't get into the other cage.     And yes, it is possible the rats can get out of the aquarium. The reason why you don't want to put rats with gerbils/hamsters, is because they can possibly eat them.|`|7NNiddPJaa	different is the best...it would not matter if they r next to eachother..good luck with them|`|q0Dg8a1haa	They will not get along. If they are babies perhaps but they won't get along for long so don't take your chances.|`|ETX2tZoEaa	NO. They do not get along at all, trust me. It's mainly about size and dominance. My advice to you would be to keep them in SEPARATE aquariums. It would be fine to keep them right beside each other, though. The sight of the each other shouldn't set their territorial spark.|`|jhEjIAYGaa	i have had rats and hamsters.  hamsters prefer to be alone, as they like their own territory.  rats prefer company, but rats and hamsters cannot live together, as they are not the same species and will almost definitely fight, likely to the death.  no idea about gerbils.  whatever pet you chose, be sure to get two of the same gender or have them fixed so they cannot breed.  good luck!
20ccea7fa7f3ddbfe3a11c22cf8097ddaa	Two schools of thought on this. The berries themselves are ok  for the birds to eat . There are several reasons for disagreement. First the berries often come in contact with the ground where they can often pick up bacterias and molds and come in contact with fertilizers. Since the berries do not have a tough skin you can scrub it is difficult to wash off the residue . Another possibility is contact with insecticides. Most berries from foreign countries are often sprayed with insectcides not allowed in this country. That goes for grapes too.especially from South America.  One berry once in a blue moon probably wont hurt your birds,My birds only get grapes I grow myself. Blue berries are probably a better choice.|`|1tOr2qLAaa	Strawberries I have never heard that they are unsafe, Birds in the wild eat them. I have tried them with my birds, they were not impressed with them.  I would go with organic though to be sure the chemicals were not on them. The same with apples. I checked one site that had information on feeding parrots and strawberries are fine.|`|43bb1de059cf4886a340467b97276fecaa	Yes, you can feed your birds strawberries. :)   - Detach the leaves and wash each strawberry thoroughly.    Birds, can eat all kinds of fruits and veggies; apples, carrots, melons, red and green peppers, cellery, but you have to be careful of the amount of fruit you feed him/her because of the sugar. Too much fruit can make your bird over weight, and then your bird may have health problems.    :]|`|e6wo7czgaa	I believe it depends on the bird. My friends cockatiel loves them for the seeds and the fruity sweetness (we guess)   You should wait around a bit though if your unsure. Until they poop, and see (yes i know its gross) if there is anything wrong with it. off colour, watery, etc.  I'm sure your birds will be fine though. But I'm not sure for the leafs of the strawberries are like tomatoes if you should be cautious about that. Don't worry though. If there is a problem call your vet.|`|0e2dcf078f31fa4438e1cbf0ec8784ecaa	Yes it's fine, just make sure there are no leaves and that you wash the fruit to remove pesticides. I give my cockatoo all kinds of fruit including strawberries.|`|bTvrv59saa	YES. I think that they just don't like the leaves, but I'd take them off anyway.|`|NllWkSDiaa	strawberries have one of the highest levels of pesticide contaminents. Be careful to serve only organically grown strawberries to birds.  Very high in vitamin C, K, and the B vitamin folate. Contains Omega-3 fatty acids.|`|enC9TvxUaa	-WASH them very well!!!  Strawberries have lots of pesticides, fertilizers, and dirt on them!!!
jV7SmnaTaa	Ok...potty pads are NOT going to work with a BOXER!!  lol...he's  not a 4 pound pomeranian!    Anyway - I would bring in a urine sample to the vet just to be sure that it's not a UTI.  It doesn't sound like it, but we hate to make that mistake.    Next, I would invest in a crate for him or atleast limit his access ot the apartment.  I would only allow him in one room or confine him to the bathroom.    Also, I would really work hard to make sure that he's getting plenty of exercise.  He's probably a bit unsure of his new surroundings.  Remember...a tired dog is a good dog.  Dogs that are too tired to get up and roam the house typically don't potty in the house.    Hope that helps...|`|qlCwiXpyaa	if your not there and he has to go he will go, but if your there you will see him and he will know so he wont do it. so try potty pads so he can use those inside if he has to go. or you can try those door mats with the fake grass with the flower on the corner. it worked for my dog, both, so they think its grass and it is only ok to go on grass.|`|WcdXFaBaaa	well if u got it from someone they probably let him. if u got him from a store then u should ask them|`|mkuOUO15aa	It could be separation anxiety or it could be general attention getting.  Here's  a helpful article on how to stop separation anxiety in dogs:  http://www.dog-training-works.com/lp/wha...    If your dog is just going for some attention getting, don't give him the satisfaction.  Don't scold your dog for making inside.  Just clean it up and ignore him for the next 15 minutes.    Positive reinforcment is the only way to train a dog to recreate an action.  Don't try scolding him to prevent accidents.  He'll like the attention whether it's bad or good.    Take care!

CqQ1DaKDaa	The most common job is an Animal Care Assistant, you don't usually require any qualifications other than common sence and enthusiasm for the cause. Another is a Veterinary nurse, you will need to go through a training course for this, which can last from two years or more depending on what skill level you're looking for. And then there is the Veterinary Surgeon you will need very good grades from school and about seven years of training. Or you could just be a receptionist, you will probably need some experience in this role. You could just be a volunteer like what I do. I clean out the animals and feed them, I try and do this once a week. But if you want paid work the animal career is rather competitive, I've been trying nearly two years now to find a placement for a vet nurse course but the north east of england doesn't have many places available.  I hope I have been helpful, if you have any more questions please just email me.  Raych|`|tUfKEXxCaa	You can work there but they will not pay you.You can only volunteer . You can choose to spend time with any animals that you want and do the work that you enjoy. Even if you only stay an hour or a whole day it is still helpful for the animals. There are various types of jobs to be done, ideas of what to do are listed according to the animal.|`|AA10276489	Go to an animal shelter and volunteer and you will get your ?? answered|`|AA10356572	I worked in one for 5 years..  every shelter is run different, I dont even know what country you are in    we got to work at 8 - fed and medicated.. then started cleaning kennels.. which took all morning.. the office opened at 9.  Wednesdays were vet days - all animals who were there too long or for what ever reason - (too many animals) were euthanized - others were vaccinated and put into adoption - afternoons - some dog walking - doing laundry/dishes.. etc .. medications.. feeding - hopefully adoptions.. etc.. go home at 5 pm    I loved it.. I hated it.. I wish I could go back and work there again.. but I moved away and there are no shelters here..
Qas05nZraa	both would be great|`|AA11569882	We have both, they aren't really pets though.  Whichever you are getting, they must live outside with others of their own kind.  Chickens would be easier because you can pretty much just convert a shed and if you have a secure garden then that's that.  With ducks you definately need a pond, and they tend to dig up the garden so they make a lot of mess.  Plus, chickens are friendlier - they naturally follow as chicks, whereas ducks have more of a mind of their own.    However... I'm not sure if poultry is the best idea for you.  See, neither are house animals - whatever you saw on 'Friends'!  They can not be house-trained, so you can't let them live in the house, unless you like slipping around in poo of course.|`|Fu7OK54kaa	chickens are much better, they crap less and are MUCH more friendly. In all, I've had 6 chickens and they lay free-range eggs almost every day :D I answered your previous question and gave you this: http://www.omlet.co.uk and that has good chicken houses that are predator-proof too. They also give you 2 hens and put it together and clip their wings. It's good, I got Patty and Selma from there :P    -Patty steals crisps out of my bag!!|`|Tjr9aObNaa	Ducks...way cuter!|`|FtBqmFDEaa	They both need a predator proof space, proper food and somewhere secure to sleep at night. You need more than one, its cruel to keep one duck or one chicken, they need company. You need to be around every morning and evening to let them out & shut them in.     Ducks sh*t a lot and its really messy, they also make mud out of any grassy area you might have and they need water to bathes/dabble in and they make that all muddy too. Chickens make slightly less mess but they still have to be cleaned out regularly.     Unless you have your heart set on poultry I would have a couple of guinea pigs maybe, I know they don't lay eggs but they are a lot less hassle.|`|CCLLnSrGaa	how about a pet turkey,mine used to run up the path to meet me when i came home from work,|`|vaulPrAmaa	dude, if your going to get a feral bird for a pet, and your decided on which one by who poops less, you shouldn't be with animals.  I think that ducks and chickens should both be free, or at least live in a good, outdoor home.  I have no prob with people who have birds and have open coops where the chickens/ducks always go back, but don't leave your bird in a cage or cooped up all the time or inside.  learn about them and their needs, don't determine a bird by how much they crap.  GET A LIFE!!  (no offence)|`|bIouq64Oaa	Ducks are cuter|`|Ihhb8aKKaa	Get a duck its more normal.|`|8GDd6lrnaa	if you have to have one go with the chicken maybe bantam.|`|bTvrv59saa	I think that it should be a chicken. They "crap" the same. You can hold a chicken! :) LOVE THEM!!!!|`|x3ly5oSdaa	Ducks !!!  Ducks are cute and tameable, but they crap alot.  Chickens poop less and are mean, well the roosters are.   It depends how much room do you have, how much are you willing to spend, are you getting a kiddie pool for a duck. Research my friend.|`|b70c76c680f23b7b2d94815940d49450aa	I believe chickens make better pets.    Chickens are more hardy, many breeds enjoy being handled and certain ones make great pets for kids (particularly bantams). http://www.henkeeping.co.uk/which.html    Both birds produce alot of waste but ducks tend to have messy poops. Chicken poop makes for good compost although you can't put it straight on many plants, you have to let it break down first.    Ducks are great birds to keep but require more work, a fresh water area to bathe and swim etc, aren't easy to put away at night and have a tendency to damage their legs more.    Check out the Clucks and Chooks site for more info on chickens and which breeds may be best for you. It also has lots of info on how to keep chickens and the things you need to consider before buying them.    http://www.henkeeping.co.uk    Good luck!|`|fQmJSlEyaa	chickens are good pets
sMVKFBk9aa	I have a green cheek conure and an Indian ringneck.  I would recommend the conure if you want a friendly bird.  My indian ringneck is afraid of hands.  He also chews up everything we give him in a day.  The conure is alot friendlier.  He will come out and play and is so funny to watch.|`|7HEZhx46aa	Neither one of them are "easy". No bird is "easy". No bird is "cheap" -- they all have ongoing expenses -- food, cage, toys, vet check ups once in a while.  I'd go with the conure, though, because they're not as prone to revert to being wild like an IRN if you don't spend as much time with them.   If you take care of them, either bird will live for several decades.|`|LR15VM9Iaa	i have had both ring neck and conjure i don't have much to say both are good ring necks are going to be more expensive they usually live to be about 27 years with good care but nothing is guaranteed all birds are extremely susceptible to fumes vapours and gas leaks this is where the term canary in a coal mine comes from the conjure is going to be less expensive idk how long they live next up is care now as far as mouses answer gos i think the beginning at least is completely ignorant all birds do not require the same care take for instance a macaw and a budgie you can not tell me the macaws poop is the same size as the budgies the macaws is going to be alot bigger ergo yourr giong to have to lclean out he macaws cage more frequently plus the macaw will like fresh fruit now back to your question your choices are going to be about the same clean up the ringneckis larger so his poop might be bigger but it shouldnt be that noticable what ever you chose be sure to buy from a breeder not a pet store and buy them young and hand fed i would get the ringneck because they are very pretty and more exotic and they form a love to generaly one person but thats not always the case   hope this helps|`|1tOr2qLAaa	All birds are about the same to take care of keep cage clean, feed what you are supposed to and love them and train them.  I would think maybe the conure would be less expensive. What I would try and find out is which is less noisy. Ringnecks can be kind of shrill occasionally.I honestly don't know much about black capped conure. Some Conures as in Sun Conures can be real noisy. I have Nanaday Conure that is quiet until she sees someone outside, then the alarm goes off.  As for friendlier it is basically how you train them. Try to find a baby and start from the beginning.  Good Luck and I hope you find a good friend.
1a66e55f2184fe6adca74fb4a9e4fd8caa	It could be fear, or it could be because of the food issue. Dogs may be extremely territorial over "their" things to other dogs, but not to humans. Some females, if never having puppies themselves, are aggressive towards puppies.  Really, it could be anything.    I wouldn't be afraid of your dog as long as she has never showed any aggression towards you. One of my parent's dogs is extremely loyal to his family, and very friendly to everyone. He plays well with other dogs, but if they go towards his ball (he is extremely fetch obsessive) he will attack them with intent to kill. He quits as soon as the other dog gets away from the ball, but the other dogs now know to avoid touching his ball. If they do avoid it, the dogs all get along great. I love the dog, but he could never go to a dog park because he would attack any other dog that has a ball. If it was a ball-free park, he would behave himself perfectly.    Your dog may have the same thing over food, or "her" things to other dogs, especially if she hasn't had a lot of other dogs over in her house.|`|ZT0K3q2Aaa	Maybe she thought it was a rodent or something.|`|Rr2D2POcaa	Has she been around puppies a lot? If not, it would be expected since it's still another dog and sometimes older dogs try to establish dominance over others especially puppies since they don't know better.|`|opjYENGGaa	That's just proof that no dog can be domesticated. The puppy obviously broke into your dogs comfort zone and that was her way of saying "go away". I'm sorry about what happened though.|`|fe447af35c529588ddeb8f78da7b83faaa	Could just be the pairing witht he other dog.  Your dog could have given off warning signs that the puppy did not understand.|`|CysZTGWnaa	he probably didn't like the way he was looking at his butt|`|Mw49Vjs6aa	This sounds like a resource guarding issue - your dog protecting her food from the puppy.  There is no such thing as a "bullet-proof" dog.      All dogs are capable of all canine behaviors in any given situation.      The only dog that can't bite is the dog without teeth, and he can  gum you pretty badly.      The next question is what you should do next.  I'd recommend contacting an APDT (association of pet dog trainers) CERTIFIED trainer or a certified canine behaviorist to help you sort it out.|`|o2ekfo8Faa	I had a dog who did the same thing (story on goodbadpitbulls.blogspot.com), and after much speculation and vet visits, we determined it was misdirected aggression.    What you need to do is first take him to the vet to rule out anything physical. Something as simple as a splinter in the paw is enough to make a dog attack.     If it's not physical, it may be mental. A trainer can help you with this one. Many problems, like food aggression, can be worked out, and if not, there are steps to take to prevent anything like this from happening. If all else fails, it may be best to rehome your dog.|`|5af8PNwxaa	Like people...maybe she is just not feeling well or she may have a bad tooth given her trouble and the other dog came a little too close.    She may have even had a fall in the yard which you did not see and hurt herself.    Are you able to look in her mouth, or feel gently over her body or will she growl at you ?      For piece of mind...a vet check would not hurt.  It may even pick up something which can be corrected asap and not neglected until it is too late to fix.
c48nm70gaa	My Min Pin has had a day of " wheezing, sneezing and hacking"  this past winter. Food and water has been the same all along and no recent trips to the very neat clean boarding kennel. We don't have a clue either!     If you're worried, a trip to the vet would put your mind at ease.
jV7SmnaTaa	I do some fostering.  I have not done a pregnant/nursing dog, but would like to at some point.    For my regular dogs that I've fostered - I just try to be diligent at making them so they'll be successful in their new homes.  The dogs must have an area of the house where they can be safe from the other dogs (especially new moms can be very protective!) and need a place where they can't get into trouble.    Many foster dogs are not necessarily house broke and also may be very young pups themselves - so, chewing may be an issue.  Depending on the breed of dog,  you may need to invest in a big kennel for your basement (like 4x8 for a large dog) or an exercise pen (4x4 for a small dog).  Remember though, mother dogs can't be expected to be in with the pups 24/7 - especially as the puppies get older.    Basically - I would suggest starting out with a regular dog without pups.  I am a very strong believer in crate training.  I think this greatly assists the dogs in being successfully potty trained in their new home.    Best wishes!|`|Jguzosm2aa	Don't bother if you're fostering outside - pups should not be raised in a shed/barn, heated or not. There's simply too much exposure, they wouldn't be getting the valuable socialization they'll need, and you won't notice problems nearly as quick.    Section off a room or part of a room for the dog and her pups. You can use a wire dog fence, or build your own barrier. I find it is good to have two old quilts, plenty of newspaper and a bag of garbage bags. I line the floor well with the bags (cut down the sides to spread them out more) with papers over them, and then spread out the quilt on top of the papers. Soft and absorbent, with something to ensure that little to no waste reaches your floor. I switch the quilts and papers as necessary, replacing soiled papers and washing the quilt. The bags generally do not need replacing.    When the pups are old enough to start going on papers on their own, I keep the idea of the bags under the papers, only this time I keep the double layer of the bag.|`|HDiSjSHiaa	Congrats on taking the step to foster. We need more people like you in the world!    Ok for starters. The disease... You will want to keep your own dogs away from the mom and pups. Even though your own dogs are vaccinated they can still carry viruses. The parvo virus can remain the the ground for weeks after a dog or anything in the canine family has past though.   This leads to probably needing a spare pair of shoes to be worn in the same room as the mom and pups and only here, once you leave the room, you should take them off.     As for a whelping box, all you need is 4 planks of 2x4's and nail them together. A stack of towels or old blankets and you're good to go.     If you ask your local shelter they should provide you with some paper and blankets and any other supplies needed. These can be washed and reused.    You will want to keep your dogs away for safety also. Many moms will want to protect their young. An empty quiet room or shed (depending on the outside temps) will be the best option as it is very stressful on moms, especially when there are other dogs around.     When feeding the mom you will want to give her extra food, especially wet food for the first few weeks as she will need to replenish her body after the birth and as her body works over time trying to feed the pups.    When the pups are ready to eat, its best to always cater to the youngest of the group. Meaning that now you should feed puppy food. You will also have to increase the amount of bowls in the room. To avoid any resource guarding between mom and pups.     A few things to look out for- Mom will have runny poop after the birth. Even blood at times. This is normal. ANything after a week or so is not normal.    Keep an eye on the activity level of the pups. Make sure mom is caring for them and not letting any of them get cold.     Once the puppies are a little older , around the age when they are plying with each other. If you find that they are lethargic and not their normal 'puppy' self seek medical help. ESPECIALLY if they're not eating, vomiting and have bloody poop. This may be parvo.    I hope I've answered all your questions.      Have you considered fostering older puppies? Perhaps that would work better with your dogs. Many puppies need to be fostered because they haven't had much contact with dogs or humans. That way they can play with your dogs and should be vaccinated by then.
vwTyihvvaa	Okay, I have had many rodents, and what works and has always worked for me was by wearing a thick sock on my hand as a glove and taken out whatever rodent, in this case a dwarf hamster and placing it into you hand with the thick sock on.     They of course are scared but make a somewhat firm grip and first start by petting their head, over and over, then touching their little paws, etc. Within three days they get use to the sock and you petting them, then in about seven days remove the sock and they'll still try to nibble your hand but not bite.     Best of luck! I swear, this has worked for me with all rodents I have had.|`|RHUDduUbaa	rub her bellie with your finger,give her treats and take good care of her also talk 2 her ALOT|`|x3ly5oSdaa	I think her name should be Spazzle nn Spaz.

She will bond with you, also take treats and hold them to her.|`|ETX2tZoEaa	First off, you should not have done that. The good thing is that it's not because of that. Dwarf hamsters are generally spastic creatures, no matter how long you wait! :D   So, your new buddies' spaziness is not a result of taking it out, but because of its nature. It might takes months for it to get used to you... But over all, don't TRY to get her to like you. Simply take her out every once in awhile, and let her go to you.   Good luck, and don't let your hamster climb walls or get online. Who KNOWS what havoc it could bring to the internet!
shRzfEHuaa	Don't worry too much, I've had my kitty disappear for a couple days, then suddenly appear again and she was fine.  Each time i was sure she was gone forever.  I'm not going to lie to you and tell you that you he is fine and he will come home for sure.  He is probably ok though, How cold is it outside?  In the future you should probably keep him inside when it gets real cold.  Is there a way he can get inside?  If not try to stay up as late as you can to let him in.  Leave a box outside with a blanket so that he can go in it if he comes home too late.  I hope you find your kitty.  Thats sweet you knitted him a sweater.|`|7dVtO1gtaa	why didn't you get a locater chip planted into him|`|JgTNtT9Uaa	He is probably at a neighbours house, curled up by a fire, with a bowl of warm milk, and not giving you a second thought.

But with the  temps so cold, it can be dangerous for him.  I quit letting my cats  out in the very cold.  My two are getting older and they want out  then within a few minutes they are waiting to come back in.  Give it  some time, if you are that worried about him, then bundle up and take  a flashlight and look for him. Does he go any certain places regularly?  The first thing I do when this happens is check any outbuildings and of course I check the road and ditches.  Nightime is the worse time for our animals.  They tend to get hit by cars... good luck.  Hope you find him

45N6tmWraa	Hey, equal opportunity!  Ask if anyone's MOM is a vet!
W0buucLsaa	I have a dog like this. Like people, some dogs are pickier than others who they socialize with.     There may be some discernible pattern in the dogs that he chooses to hang with... or there may not be; it might be based on smells. Take note of whoever he plays with and see if there's a pattern, particularly if you want to get another dog one day.     My dog is the same way, and then we realized that every dog she wanted to play with was a lot bigger than her... male, female, didn't matter; she just had a lot of respect for dogs that were 100+ pounds. She's fairly large herself, so maybe she just thinks that she's bigger than she really is. :)|`|wet127TIaa	i bet you are choosy who you play with if you know what i mean, so your dog has good sense too.he will click one day and you wont be able to stop him.  hes a clever dog.|`|bicAgoycaa	It's just like the way children are... if a dog can sense another dog is incompatible, then they won't show interest. If it's truly a concern of yours then do everything you can to socialize your dog with all different types of other dogs. Most of the time dogs will choose if they like big or small, male or female... it's just a matter of somewhat making them "Befriend" any type of dog.    My female is a large dog but she only likes smaller dogs because dogs the same size of her seem to hurt her when they play.    Just be thankful that your dog just loses interest in the other dogs and doesn't show aggression.|`|okAYAGvXaa	Just like people, dogs are individuals. That's all.|`|cmNQJjEbaa	What breed do you have.

BNHeJm8Maa	Garlic is great for killing infections so it wouldn't do your dog any harm in normal amounts. Not sure if it would be enough to cure heartworms though.|`|pvgwJwxvaa	NO garlic will not get rid of heart worms but it will cause hemolytic anemia which can kill your dog.  no homeopathic treatment will get rid of heartworms!  and yes you need a prescription from your vet for heart worm prevention.|`|Bw18seFqaa	doesnt work.. the amounts of garlic you'd have to use would be dangerous for your dog.    ivermectin works.|`|ixFbNr4taa	Totally false...."homeopathic," "natural" or "organic" products are often touted as cures or preventives for heartworm disease. However, such products have never been proven effective by rigorous scientific methods.  If these methods (Garlic? - get real!!) actually worked --then you would not have the huge problem of heartworm that is typically seen across the southern United States.      From Wiki..... The currently approved drug in the US, melarsomine dihydrochloride, is marketed under the brand name Immiticide.  After treatment, the dog must rest (restricted exercise) for several weeks so as to give its body sufficient time to absorb the dead worms without ill effect. Otherwise, when the dog is under exertion, dead worms may break loose and travel to the lungs, potentially causing respiratory failure and death.  The course of treatment is not completed until several weeks later when the microfilariae (baby heartworms) are dealt with in a separate course of treatment. Once heartworm tests are negative, the treatment is considered a success.    EDIT -- don't try to treat heartworm on your own.  There are very specific problems assoicated with the worms such as getting rid of the "load" from the heart ifself.  Work with your vet!!!
8NSh1D4Maa	You generally feed 2-3% of their body weight daily for a dog of normal activity level.  That would be somewhere around 1.5-2 pounds a day for a dog the size of yours.  You will adjust from there based on your dog's body condition.  If he's getting chubby, reduce.  If he's looking thin, increase.  There's no set amount that will work for every dog.|`|PM23RDycaa	Assuming he's fully grown and  not over or underweight he needs 14 ounces a meal twice a day at 2.5% of his current body weight. 80% muscle meat, 10% bone and 10% organ half of which needs to be liver.    here are some Raw/preymodel sites and groups for you    http://www.rawfeddogs.net/  http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/RawCh...  http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/rawfe...  http://www.rawfed.com/myths/index.html  http://www.rawmeatybones.com/|`|RNqHUNgEaa	You should feed 2-3% of your dog's body weight daily. So your dog would need 1.4---2.1 pounds of food a day.    This is not how people comfortable and advanced in raw feeding do, however. They just feeed what they think looks like enough food (just by sight, you don't weigh, just put some food in the dog's bowl) then if the dog gains weight they feed less, if they lose weight they feed more. Weighing your dogs food before feeding it is time consuming and can get annoying to do it day after day, this is why people comfortable with raw feeding don't weigh their food.|`|vT4l2caVaa	Adult dogs can be fed between 2-3% of the their body weight. They recommend starting with 1/2 pound of food per 25 lbs of body weight daily and make adjustments according to your dog's age and activity. They also suggest that the daily ration be split to feed morning and night. Remember that a healthy dog is not overweight.
SnAsZapMaa	No way is timidity normal in the GSD breed.  In most countries the GSDs have to pass a courage test (the one where the GSD finds a "criminal" behind a wall, "tells" the criminal to stand still while the owner walks up, escorts the criminal away then lets him depart on the owner's command, then - when the criminal suddenly turns around, yells & starts an attack - grabs his arm and holds on despite being hit on the ribs by a cane) in order to qualify for a Breed Survey Classification (BS.Cl.1 or 2 in English, KKl.I or II in German). Sadly, KCs aren't interested in whether a dog has courage and fits the rest of its Breed Standard, just whether it and its parents are in the Breed Register, so lots of litters get born to pooches that should never have been bred from.    However, as your bit.ch has been abandoned by its first owners and had who-knows-what experiences while loose, then was tethered by its finders, and then passed to you, some reticence is understandable. One adult bit.ch we bought regarded herself as kidnapped, so we ignored her, just talking as we passed her run or cleaned it or fed her - by the end of a week she was craving affection.    Her response to you will be improved if you do nice things and interesting things for her:  ? A tidbit when you come home - toss it to her while she is reluctant to come close, later drop it halfway between your & her, later drop it at your feet. Eventually you will be able to choose between holding it in your palm & calling her, or calling her to Sit in front of you then dropping it into her waiting mouth. ALL dogs like tidbits, it's just a case of finding the right ones - hard cheese, baked liver, crisped bacon, a peanut, a bit of cooked sausage, whatever. But always only a tiny sliver - a tidbit is not intended to be a feed, just the scent & taste, leaving the dog keen to earn another. Some messier things my dogs beg for are bits of canned salmon, canned beetroot, a drip of dairy butter, a drip of peanut butter.  ? Take her for on-lead walks to places where there are no loose dogs. Don't worry about training her to heel - let her meander provided it is in the direction you want to go and at about a speed that suits you. But use the leash to bring her to you whenever a dog does appear; also to prevent her picking up stuff she discovers while walking.  ? If she is a ball-crazy dog (not all are), spend time kicking a ball around for her to chase.  ? Buy her a sheepskin (or similar) rug; place it beside your armchair or office chair then walk her on-lead to it and sit yourself in your chair - appear to ignore her but praise her when she decides to lie down on the rug. It places her in a good position for being stroked when she is ready for that, and having a dog trained to lie on her place-mat is handy if you take her & it when visiting people who don't have dogs.  ? You personally deliver one of her 2 feeds a day, placing it in front of her cage then stepping back. She is old enough to need only one feed a day, but 2 are an advantage while her ribs show when she is asleep and while she has family members she needs to learn to associate with her meals.    When she is happy with you, enrol yourself for a course (probably 8 sessions a week apart) with a training club so that your techniques are polished by the instructor, and so she learns to pay attention despite distractions from other dogs & people in the class.

As of next Saturday, four of my five dogs I have owned were rescue dogs.  My fourth dog, the one I have now, was given to us.  We'll get the fifth dog next Saturday.  Two of my dogs were very timid at first, especially to my dad.  We pretty much knew the first one was abused by a man.  We didn't know for sure about the second, but we figured she was with the way she acted towards my dad.  My third one just loved everyone.  My fourth one, never had any problems with men, as she was given to us by a breeder as a going away gift.  I don't know about the fifth one yet.|`|yAsLhdp2aa	It is going to take time...German Sheps are extremely intelligent and loyal dogs..just sounds like she has not been stable in a home long enough for her to devlope self esteme and loyalty...as soon as she does, she goes to a new place.  Give her lots of time (several months) and plenty of positive reinforcment..she will come around. She may have been hurt by a male, and that is why she is so timid around you and not your wife and children.  Talk to her in a high pitched voice..similar to when you koo to a baby, she will adjust and be the best dog.  Let her settle in w/ the family and establish you as the family (pack) leader before you sign her up for any adult ob. classes. it will just confuse her more if you rush her into it too soon.    She feels safe in the kennel you have provided for her, that is why she retreats back to it (it is her den).  Sounds like she would be a good house dog if you were to move the kennel in the house with the family. She will adjust to your routine a lot faster with having family noises around her 24/7, she may feel as if you are going to abandone her every time you go in the house, she may not know when her next meal will be and feels left out and alone (sad) when you leave her.    Do one on one activities with her..only you feed her (family can start after you and her have bonded)...it sigifies that you are giving her authorization to eat (pack leader). Be the only one to take her on walks and take her to the park, go for a drive, any thing you can think of. good luck|`|CysZTGWnaa	I had a dog that would come to me and my family but would never go near my dad. After about a year and a half he would come to him  but........  my dad never kept trying he just wanted to give the dog time. I would reccomond giving her treats to bring her she will warm up to you after a while she just has to learn to trust you|`|ydshiNrKaa	Give her time.  Most german shepherds are very shy at first when they are with new individuals.  If you have only had her for 4 days she is still getting use to her new surroundings and her new family.  Give her time to warm up.      She may have been mistreated somehow in the past by a male individual and it will take time for her to trust  you completely, but she will.  She is feeling a little insecure and that is why she is going into her kennel.  She feels safe in there.  Try feeding her her meals at night and giving her some treats.  If she won't take the treats, throw them toward her so she can pick them up.  Make them special treats too like pieces of boiled chicken or cheese.  Make sure no one else feeds these to her as they will be your special treats.She will associate these treats with you and know that when you come around she gets these treats.  Good things happen when you come around.  don't force yourself on her, just let her get use to you in her own time.  Sit by her and talk to her in a calm voice not making contact with her. You may want to do this when she is in her kennel feeling more secure.  Face away from her and just talk to her for awhile.  Then get up and go about your business.  do this on a regular basis.  Take her on walks to help bond with her, take her in the car with you if she likes to go for rides, any thing that puts the two of you in a good situation.   GSD are great loving protective and loyal companions but they can be shy if they do not know you.  I'm sure that given time, she will be a great addition to your family.  have patience with her and give her time and space.|`|AM7CgQ4daa	the more time you spend with your dog, the more she will relax and bond with you.   Its also a good idea to do some simple obedience, don't make a big deal, but it is a good way to show her that you are happy if she does what you want.  Just go over sit and come, a few times a day and treat with something yummy.  The more you feed the dog, the quicker she will bond, again give her something nice, you could mix a little sardine with the food.  But it does take time for dogs to settle in, everything smells strange, and the more intelligent the dog the more unsettled.    dont push things to much, stay to the same walk and keep away from other dogs for a while, first you make her feel safe before you start to push the boundaries.
d10wjRifaa	put them in separate containers so the other one does not get infected, to the one that is sick make sure you provide warmth put a lamp over her or a heat mat, make sure you put her in clean new fresh substrate, rinse all of the habitats items like  exercise wheel, food dish, water dish etc.     I had some mice before they were young about 2 and a half month old and when winter came they got sick all of a sudden one started sneasing/squeaking a few days later it died but then 2 of my other mice started doing the same and they ended up dying thats why I advice you to keep them separated.     If problems continue take it to a vet|`|vwTyihvvaa	While one is sick, you need to seperate them so that the healthy mouse does not pick up whatever the sick mouse might have.     I would recommend taking the sick mouse to the vet though, doesn't sound like it's having an easy time with whatever it might have.
u61yKsE3aa	It's always best to give them time to adjust first.  It is stressfull on a reptile to move and giving them some alone time to adjust is always reccomended|`|d10wjRifaa	yes it is because the gecko is not yet used to its new home being handle the first day this will cause stress to the gecko
gM7VuCM4aa	Use Dawn dish washing detergent or any anti grease dish soap. People that show their cats use this to degrease the cats fur. Have fun!|`|w1lh1INHaa	All your options are too harsh for cats...and their delicate eyes.    Do you have any Dawn dishsoap, as a drop of that in water is okay, just keep well away from the eyes.    You can clean off major spots of grease with some olive oil, as the olive oil will break down the grease, and won't hurt your cat when she decides to groom.  If she doesn't seem clean enough, you can mix a little cornstarch with baking soda, massage it in, then brush out, as this will remove a lot of the residue.  If you have a hard time getting the mixture out, you can rub down with a wet cloth (there will be some fizzing).|`|c4f8a63972685e95e511d29969f672a3aa	No, you should only use a special cat shampoo for a cat. Human shampoo can be too harsh and dry out the skin or cause an allergic reaction.     Most human soap products should not be used on animals. This is because they contain scents and other ingredients that can trigger serious dermatological conditions. Cats maintain a healthy balance between skin and hair with natural oils, and aggressive cleaning compounds can have an adverse effect by removing these.|`|HaDR9veDaa	http://www.petco.com/product/106080/John...    you could try this but if he is really nasty u may want to take him to a groomer|`|shRzfEHuaa	Cat shampoo is really cheap.  I got a big bottle of it for 3 dollars.  I wouldn't use anything else.  If you have to then use something unscented.

And then you'll have a big problem on your hands. I say the shelter.|`|4owUg43oaa	I'm sure the squirrels would love it, but you could also mix the cat food into a brand your cats do like and use it that way.  I do that with hairball formula for my cats.  Also, the previous post that mentions donating it to a shelter or rescue group is a great suggestion!|`|0ZxYrtv0aa	YOUR wild squirrels? Are they actually yours? Because if they're not you shouldn't feed them anyway, some animals can become too dependant on being provided with food that they actually forget how to hunt for it on their own. So please be careful.    I wouldn't know if it would kill them, but to be safe, just don't let it near them.    :)|`|VUfT35UQaa	"killing them dead?" -how else can you kill them without them being dead (that made me smile XD)    But no, don't feed wild squirrels, because they will become dependent on you and stop hunting, or will develop a taste for cat food and come onto your house and scare your cats.
395196f427a3bfd5aca87f8298bfa682aa	Well more than likely she's pregnant.  There is nothing you can do now but wait.  Taking her to the vet would be a waste of time and money.  Depending on when this "piggy back ride" took place or how many times it took place it could be any time now that she'll deliver.  You need to get the male out of the cage and into another one.   The female will become more aggressive while shes pregnant, also you need to get him out of there because within half an hour of giving birth she can get pregnant again.  No I'm not kidding.  When she goes into labor just let her be watch from afar but just let her be but count babies every now and then just so you know how many is there so she doesn't leave them scattered.  When she first give birth its possible that she will have the babies scattered all over the place but when she is done delivering she will gather them up and put them all in a nice little nest.  Depending on where you have your cage located you need to make sure there are no drafts, and that it isn't even remotely chilly, the babies are born with no fur and the draft could possible kill them.  You could start cutting up some apple into very small pieces and giving her a couple of pieces of it or do the same thing with a hard boiled egg but not to much just a little, the egg and apple will help her get her protein and nutrients back.  If she doesn't eat all of the apple or egg make sure you get what she doesn't eat out of the cage so it doesnt smell or attract mice. Oh before I forget make sure the water bottle isn't leaking and that the cage isn't damp or anything that could harm the babies too.  Hope I helped if you need to know more feel free to email me.|`|cqxTi6wTaa	Don't Worry find a vet & see if the can tell you!!!|`|aERd9Se2aa	i think you should just wait and just separate the male if it is still there.. so in case she would give birth.. just feed their mom and after about 2 weeks old the babies should have hairs... just let it stay their with their mom then after about a month just sell them if you want to...     i've got 2 hamster and 1 gave birth of 2 babies... now again it gave birth to 9 babies weeeeee|`|vwTyihvvaa	You'll know soon enough, if she is pregnant she is and there is nothing much you can do about it.

EFZRSqFcaa	The day after a gastrotomy your dog shouldn't even be home let alone eating.  It's highly irresponsible of your vet to let your dog go home.  If you're at all worried you must call your vet. If we had performed this op where I work we don't allow the dogs to go home until we know they can eat with no further complications after the op and as a rule they are not allowed to eat for at least 24 hours.|`|nctxHm8Qaa	If your dog is acting like he is in extreme pain or is worrying his incision, he should see a vet.  NOW.  A torn GI surgery site is not something to mess around with.|`|9kTejB0uaa	You don't say how long ago he had this surgery but any time I'm not happy about what's going on, especially after major abdo.surgery, I call my vet.  Immediate post op shivering is reasonably normal - surgery patients need lots of warmth, a place to lie quietly and they don't very often show any interest in food.  They might take a little water, but don't allow them to load up on water or they may vomit it back.  If your vet didn't give you any pain killer, it might be worth asking for some (some vets are better at post op pain killers than others, although normally they do give patients an painkilling injection at the time)    Bottom line - if you are worried, call your vet for advice.|`|Yn3InySlaa	He might still be feeling bad from the anaesthetic, or maybe the wound is bothering him.  I'd take him back to the vet straight away, to be on the safe side.|`|e8f092bbd197b0b3bdad36d4e1287a01aa	im not a vet ether, i would probably take the dog to a vet, and see what he ( or she) made the shacking
AA10387399	FLy pets in cargo is not safer than being with you, trust me I used to work at a large international airport. I would never ship my cats.Here are some tips from a seminar I did.. Hope they  will help.    Traveling with your Cat~    Introduce an upcoming vacation by bringing out the suitcase days beforehand~.     Set aside time for you and your cat to enjoy extra cuddles~.   Pay attention to the special needs of a senior cat; he'll often need extra reassurance.~   Stay up-to-date on veterinary visits and vaccinations so that your cat is healthy  and at his best for handling change~.     Decide as a family that all members will interact normally with the family cat when any routine changes.   Maintain all of your cat's grooming, feeding, and playtime rituals.~     To keep your cat  from causing or having an accident, keep confined in a carrier or crate  A stretch carrier allows your pet to have more room to roam once the carrier is loaded in the car.  If you have trouble getting your dog or cat into a carrier, try a top-opening one that you can lower cat  into. Secure the carrier with a seatbelt or other device. ~    Keep your pet harnessed or collared even while he's crated, and make sure he is wearing ID tags   Leash your cat if the two of you decide to take a scenic stroll.~    Park in the shade   Make rest stops every two or three hours so your pet can relieve herself and have a drink of water   The inside of a parked vehicle can reach 120 degrees in warm months, and your pet could experience heatstroke, which can lead to brain damage and death.   When you make a rest stop, park in the shade.   Traveling at night or during cooler times of the day is a good idea if you don't have air conditioning in your vehicle. You can also place a cooling mat in your pet's carrier or crate to help keep her from heating up, or wrap an ice pack and place it in the carrier~.     If your pet experiences stress or motion sickness, he might pant excessively, drool, vomit, or develop diarrhea. Discuss medication options with your veterinarian before hitting the road. . You might also try covering the carrier with a light weight material. Sometimes iif they can't see out they do better with motion sickness~    Don't feed your pet for about three hours before beginning your trip. Offer your pet a snack while riding, but don't provide dinner until you arrive at your destination Take along a supply of your pet's regular food, a food bowl, a heavy water dish that won't tip over, and a supply of water from home. If you are staying overnight at a hotel or motel, phone ahead first to determine if it accepts pets. There are many books on the market that list pet-friendly hotels~    Moving to a new place with your Cat~      Moving home can be a very traumatic time for people and cats. Owners have many worries about how their cat will cope and how they can ensure that it does not wander off and get lost in its new environment or, if the old home is within an easy walking distance, that the cat will return there instead of accepting the new house as home. Indeed this does happen and, since cats value their territory as much as their owners, they may return to their old haunts and try to take up residence with the new people who live there. There are some things which the owner can do to help the cat settle into its new home~.      After the moving men have gone and the house is quiet,   A cat should remain in its carriert on arrival until one room is straightened out and its familiar objects installed. the cat should be allowed to explore, but all outer doors and windows must be kept closed against escape~.    It may be wise to board particularly nervous individuals in a friendly cattery before the packing of belongings and stripping of curtains etc. starts at the old house, and not to bring them to the new house until everything is unpacked and positioned~    If your kitties must go outside, here are some suggestions to make their   transition to a new home a bit easier~.     First, keep them mostly indoors for three to four weeks. This will allow them to get used to their new home, much the same as you will be doing when you first arrive. When you take them outside during this time, do so only in a carrier or on leash with a shoulder harness. This is the best way for you to introduce them to their new outdoor surroundings. Take them to all corners of your property. If your cats are in a carrier, take them out of the carrierbut hold on to them. Don't let them jump out of your arms and run away. Let them sniff and look around. Repeat this many times during those first few weeks. They will learn a lot from these little excursions~.     Second, hang some wind chimes near your back porch or doorway. When the cats are allowed to go out, they will use all of their senses, including their ears, to get their bearings and know where they are. The familiar sound of those chimes might help them find their way home if they travel too far~.     Fina|`|Yn3InySlaa	I'd drive with them, too, especially if they're fine in the car.  Will they tolerate a harness and leash so they can get some fresh air and stretch their legs when you have a break?  If not, I'd try to get them used to this over the next couple of months.  Make sure their carrier is secure and can't slide around so that they can make themselves comfy.  Good luck!|`|KuKB0kfEaa	If I were you I would Drive with them. It sounds a lot safer to me then putting them on an airplane. I would never want to leave them ether. Good luck with the move.|`|A7XV2K3Paa	I would think that they would feel safer and more secure in your care. After all, YOU are the person that they know best. I think I would contact the vet ahead of time and see if there is something that you can give them to keep them calm as well as tips. All the changes could be quite stressful for them.   Lots of rides prior to the trip may help them take it more in stride. Best wishes.
4gcTZNZBaa	Buy special ones it can really hurt if you use regular ones. Cut just a very little at a time. If she does bleed have some pet blood stopping dust on hand (you can get it at a pet store).|`|CVXCSTHoaa	Dark nails are harder to do, when i clip mine I just take off the tip if you do cut into and bleed use  cornstarch or flour to stop it pack it on the  tip.    You can use nail clippers but its alot harder to do, I would advise you to get animal nail clippers they run about $5.00 in pet stores.|`|Ho80Hslgaa	I have a bunny how I clip here nails I bring her to the vet it only cost about ten dollars|`|CqQ1DaKDaa	Get a torch, blanket, flour (just in case) and special rabbit clippers that have a guard on.  Right now unless your rabbit likes to be handled pick her up or have someone else pick her up and make sure you can clearly see her nails and she is comfortable; an easy way to pick up a nervous rabbit for nail clippings is a 'burrito' style. You just wrap the blanket so the rabbit can obviously breathe and the nails stick out; only use this if the rabbit is too nervous to be handled. Now shine the torch away from the rabbits face but though the nails, my rabbits nails are also dark but in time you get used to where the quick is. You should see a thin line inside of the nail. This is the quick. You should never cut this as it can cause the rabbit pain and she will bleed. If this occurs use the flour to gently pad the end of the nail to stop the bleeding. Make sure you clip with the guard on. Always comfort and praise your rabbit throughout the process so she is relaxed and happy. Then once done give her her favourite treat or a piece of fruit/veg. This way each time she will look forward to it.  If you want any more help with your bunny please either visit my website:  www.pixibunni.webs.com  or just email me okay?  Good luck.  Raych|`|VXVwevE4aa	The best thing to do is to speak to your local S.P.C.A they will advise you how to do it correctly and safely and, it's free advice.|`|mowvERi1aa	buy the "special ones" you can find them at wal-mart where the cat section is or any pet store for like 5 dollars...    i just clipped my rabbits nails today and some are black and some are clear just clip the tip of them where they are pointy and dont clip more then a centimeter.    if you accidentally clip her quick don't freak out just get corn starch or flour and put it on the part where the quick is.    after you get done clipping then give her s treat or something that she likes like a slice of banana or a little piece of a vegetable or fruit.|`|SFgipEgCaa	You cut to the point where you do not cut the vain.

BWVDKixeaa	I used to be a dog person and was actually kinda scared of cats.  I was living with someone and they got 2 cats and I just got used to cats and realised they are not as bad as I thought. Now I have a dog (family dog but stays at my house) and a cat.  I love dogs but they are a lot of work compared to cats.  I prefer cats because they are less dependent on their owner but are still loyal and loving in their own way.  Of course every cat is different just like dogs are different.  I love when my cat jumps up on my bed to sleep with me, I love when she comes home at the end of a long day outside, I love how she follows me to the bathroom, I love how she tries to talk to me, I love how she likes me giving her kisses and just sits there taking it all in like she's in heaven, I love when she shows off in front of me rolling over and over on her back.|`|kcbVPJh9aa	More lazy|`|YGjzuvoaaa	Yes, cats make excellent pets. I have one. But, cats are really nothing like dogs. If you are a dog person, you should definitely get a dog, not a cat. Cat people love cats and dog people love dogs. Cats sleep more, use the litter box, are more independent, but are definitely as affectionate in different ways than dogs. You should ask your parents to get you a dog because if you're a big dog person, you probably won't like having a cat. If you're feeling ambitious though, try it out. You might like cats better than dogs afterwards.|`|35f126768433fb7bc9a5037cf6657dbcaa	cats make great pets|`|Qas05nZraa	cats are great pets, they are friendly, affectionate and fun|`|BYMaGYIvaa	i don't like cats that much   im allergic so in my case no.....  but their cute=)|`|HZ7Dlz3kaa	i love cats.  they are so independent and so much easier than dogs.  they are not as needy, and they make you work for their trust (some people don't like that, but I think it's a wonderful quality - people normally make you work for your trust too)  they are very smart, too (you can't get 8 cats to pull a person in the snow! The cat demands to be pulled! lol)    anyway, once you gain a cat's trust, they are the sweetest pets.  they know when you are upset and will cuddle with you, but you don't need to constantly entertain them if you aren't in the mood.  they are cute and sweet - of coarse, all cats have different personalities (just like different dogs or different people) so make sure you play with the the kitten first before you take it home.|`|paaozogGaa	cats are great  I like the black ones best  honestly I am more of a dog person too, but cats are still wonderful   the nice thing is unlike dogs they don't need  to be potty trained  bathed  walked  crate trained  they are easier pets then dogs, but they still offer the same amount of love|`|JgTNtT9Uaa	I am a cat person. The reason i love my cat is because, when i call her she ignores me, when i want a cuddle..she ignores me, when i am cold she doesn't keep me warm. When i buy her toys, she doesn't play with them. Cats are very independent and only do things if they want to, when they want to, and in their own time.   I think if you want a dog, you may find that a cat is unrewarding because dogs are obedient creatures. Cats are not.   Having said that, my cat can run away at any time, but she hasn't because she likes me being near her, she likes warming herself next to me and she likes my ability to open cat food tins.I find that very endearing. So if you want to be a slave for a little furry master with sharp claws, then get a cat, if you want obedience and something that you can take for walks, get a dog.

My cat brings me her toy back when i throw it for her|`|shRzfEHuaa	If you want a cat like a dog, get a cat that is at least a year old, because cats personalities change a lot while they are a kitten.    Why are you a big dog person?  The only thing i like about dogs are their tricks are cool, and they protect your house.     Reasons I like cats better  They are easier to carry, unless you get a chihuahua or something similar  They poop in a box, instead of having to scoop up poop in your back yard, you simply empty the box.  They live longer then dogs  Do less damage to your stuff  Easier to push away when they want to be affectionate and you are busy  So adorable to watch them play, chasing string, I like to make mine jump and run in circles for it  Keep your house free of mice  Bathe themselves.  Don't need to be house broken, most just know to use the litter box      Some cats are snooty, and they aren't as loyal as dogs.  You can train your cat to walk on a leash with a harness.  You can train a cat to use a toilet.  Some cats can be very affectionate and cuddly like dogs, my cats are.  My kittens run to greet me when i come home.  If you want a dog to teach it cool tricks, i wouldn't recommend getting a cat.  They are much harder to train.|`|zrqd9Nuuaa	i have a dog, who is a bit of a cat i think.  he sleeps like there's no tomorrow.  is as ignorant as a cat.  and very independant.  i think a ragdoll cat would be good for you.  ive heard they are very much like dogs,  they are not aggressive whatso ever.  aggressiveness just isnt in their nature.  but, they have to be indoors at all times as they do not know how to defend themselves.  i really want a ragdoll, i'm going to get one sooon.
KeevlZnTaa	A fancy hamster, teddy bear hamster, honeybear hamster, etc are all the same breed, and all of them prefer to live alone.     Most likely your hamster have already mated, hamster reproduce very fast, and will mate until the female is pregnant. If you do not plan on having a litter of hamsters then remove the male(although it may already be too late). When the female becomes pregnant you will have to remove the male anyway, as hamsters are solitary and will not stay "friends".|`|vwTyihvvaa	Unfortunately, regardless of the breed of hamster, hamsters prefer to live alone.|`|x0a2Zxc5aa	ummm yes and yes they will probably mate|`|ak9DrBSwaa	These are both Syrians and since you have a male and a female mating is a definite possiblity.    Of greater concern is the fact that they may very well kill each other. Syrians are solitary critters and should be housed alone. Since you didn't know this, it's obvious that you don't have the information on how to breed safely and responsibly. Please seperate your hamsters.

uIk9MAnDaa	ok what i would do is take the cage in the bathroom and open the cage door and if they don't come out on there own then you put your finger in there and push there chest and they should jump on but you never i mean never grab them with a wash cloth or a towel take a thin pair of gloves and grab them very carefully so that you don't stress them like you would if you grabbed them rough or in a wash cloth you have to take them in your hand and hold them close to your chest and they will be very comfortable and then they will want to come out because you held them right and after that you can not have them in the bathroom and you can just let them sit on your shoulder or on something and they will really like you then, i had the same problem because i had to get them out like that so plz don't stress them with the wash cloth =D good luck|`|9a056324e084aa96722167b89dc65ce2aa	Let me first tell you that getting 2 budgies was a big mistake if you intend to hand tame them. It is WAY easier to hand tame a bird, when it doesnt have another bird to play with. Im not saying its impossible, but still much easier with one. Also, realize, that if you were to have only got one budgie, trained it, and  then got another, it probably would have went back to being "wild." Birds prefer birds to humans. I have cockatiels, one that was handfed as a baby, the other not. The one that was handfed is still nice, but prefers to be with the other. So you want to let them out and you want to know where? Anywhere, because nowhere is 100% safe. Make sure if you are in a room that has an outside door, that the door is locked, so nobody can come in and the bird can fly out. When starting off its easiest to have the bird in one closed off room. Realize, your bird will fly away from you. It will land on high things, youll try to get it, and it will fly. It will go behind things that are far too big to move, and even climb inside of things that it can get stuck in. I would suggest working on having them step up on your finger in the cage and stay still for a long time. When, any time. To hold them, if your trying to catch them, you can just grab them around the body, hold tight enough so they cant get away, but no tighter. Other then that they should sit on your finger. Also, if you have a bird that bites hard, you can use a wash cloth to catch them, and grab around. have fun|`|LR15VM9Iaa	Okay i will admit that it would have been easier to tame them if you had only got 1 but you can still train them okay first off what are you feeding them if its an all seed diet that's not good and they need to be converted over to pellet food now you need to establish a meal plan for your birds like in the morning give them their food bowls all the way full   and in about 1-1 1/2 hours take their food out and later on in may bey 6 hours try to get them to eat some seeds out of your hand this probably wont work at first but keep trying if you cant get them to eat out of your hands then try todrop a seed in their bowl make sure they can hear and see you drop it in try to slip the sunflower seed though the cage bars so you dont scare the birds oh and you should put them in seporate cages while training or all the time as this will limit distactions budgies are very skiddish and this will take some time. ill be adding more messages later   hope this helps|`|x3ly5oSdaa	Well put out your finger, or grab them with a washcloth. If you want to bond with them you need to put them in different cages also important don't put a mirror in the cage or they will bond with the "bird in the mirror", wear an old shirt and put them out your shoulder.|`|upHeh1AUaa	close the windows and doors of the room they're in, and open all the cage doors and wait for them to come out. then try to get up close to them and just talk to them so they know that you're not going to hurt them. Try to put your finger to their chest and make them stand on your finger.    You could also get their wings clipped, that way they will be much easier to play with. Never ever put your hand in the cage and grab them because you could injure their wings.
uBFhKXgHaa	Cats do not get periods. They have heat cycles. Why are you waiting? It's healthiest for her to be spayed /before/ her first heat cycle. Please make an appointment with the vet ASAP.

5af8PNwxaa	Heather and Chewbacca (great name!!)... like human doctors vets can make misdiagnoses.    If in doubt, seek the advise of another vet...a second opinion.    Just something to think about, when he got the rash did you put any new plants in the backyard or had his diet or anything changed.  If so, I hope you let the vet know as they need as much info as possible.|`|jV7SmnaTaa	Yes, this is a very common problem.  Typically the veterinarian will give some some sort of cream to apply to the eye for atleast a week.  The dog will be just fine.  Remember though, eye problems can go from questionable to terrible very quickly - always bring your dog to the vet ASAP for eye problems!  :)
Kj8Ie77waa	There is no such "best one". Different breeds have different energy levels, exercise needs, attention needs, training needs, and so forth. Some breeds may be very dependent and need to have someone who is home all the time, others are more independent and not so needy. Some may train easy and obey well, others may be more stubborn and difficult to teach. Some may shed alot, others may not shed much at all but need to be taken to the groomers to be clipped or shaved.    There are just so many, many differences between each breed, you just can't pick one "best" of them all. Each breed is different, and each person is different. What may work for one person won't work for another. Pick the best one for "you".     Figure out how much exercise, attention, and so forth you are willing to give a dog. How much time are you willing to spend grooming the dog? training the dog? Do you want a dog that will enjoy lap time, or a dog who can be more independent. Will you have a long walk everyday? Or just playtime in the living room?    Make a list of all these things, THEN start searching for a breed that matches your needs.    but there is no "best" one of all the breeds.|`|76nTvO4iaa	Pomeranian|`|Qas05nZraa	shih tzu or a chihuahua|`|dYluozLHaa	the ones that are begging for a home at your local shelter  PLEASE ADOPT|`|AA12069383	Norfolk Terrier|`|c48nm70gaa	We have a four year old Miniature Pincher.

They're good with kids,don't shed much,lively,loyal,strong.  They still are terriers though,and have a digging instinct,somewhat difficult to train since they can be stubborn,but are very smart.

L22hVXTIaa	She could get pregnant and that would be very bad for such a young dog.  At 7 months she's still a puppy herself and not ready to take care of puppies.  You could seriously damage her growth - not to mention the myriad problems that can come with a pregnancy.  Keep you male away from her if you value her and then make an appointment to have her spayed and the male neutered.|`|1ad7aa5Caa	You mean she is in heat.     Yes, this is potentially dangerous. You could ask your vet to spay her ASAP. Also, I'd ask about neutering your other dog. In the meantime, keep them away from eachother.|`|U1RcZjqJaa	As long as he is fixed then there shouldn't be an issue. When my dog was in heat and my (fixed) male would try to hump her sometimes she would let him and sometimes she would snap at him, but never bit him, its was just a "get away from me" snap.|`|ynkJ09QJaa	expect puppies|`|cAqS3Vosaa	Idont thinkj that it is, but I think that you should go ahead and get them both fixed before you have puppies. By the way, its called a heat not a period!|`|Cl23eeneaa	It is very normal for your 7month old puppy to start her heat cycle at this age. I would suggest trying to keep them separate until you get at least one of them spayed/neutered (i know money may be an issue due to the economy). Humping is also a sign of dominance, but since your babies are not altered yet it could result in pregnancy. I have been involved in allot of pre mature pregnancies being that i work in an animal hospital and i usually help out allot when it comes to puppy whelping. As I said before about money concerns, you can call your local shelter and ask if they do voucher programs. What I mean is that some shelters will issue spay/neuter vouchers making the cost of the surgeries significantly lower (between $25 to $50 usually).  I hope all works out for you and good luck with your puppies.|`|cIh5EI3eaa	She's in heat hun....oh my. lol She could have puppies best thing to do is get her spayed that way you dont have to worry about her bleeding and male dogs.|`|ixutx59Daa	Your dog is in heat.

And, you should never breed a female smaller than 5 lbs.  Your 6 lb girl may be okay, but have a vet on standby in case she needs a C-section.  There really is no average number - but 2 to 3 is the usual.  Although some have 1 while others have 6.  You should check with your vet now to confirm her pregnancy and talk things over with him/her so that you know what to expect and what to do when she is ready to deliver.
0f3fde633bd5c269a5dc7fc600702cccaa	You may have miscounted and your dog may be closer than you think for her delivery.  She may also be having a problem but that can only be determined by a vet.  Dogs are only pregnant for 63 days so if shes 8 weeks pregnant that's only 56 days.  That's a week early and that does not sound like such a long time to us but for a dog its way to early.  Most of the development of the puppy's happens in the last part of the pregnancy.  If she does deliver and you are right about the time the puppy's may not survive.  You should also be concerned for the health of the mother its not normal for a dog to have a premature birth so she may be having a problem as well.  Get to a vet as soon as possible.|`|PM23RDycaa	Call an ER vet and stop relying on STRANGERS to tell you whats wrong with your dog.|`|f3f09dd5dab69f7e644b37c4cf98a3abaa	if the discharge is blue/green - go to a vet ASAP - as that is a sign of something quite serious.      get off the computer and call an emergency vet or your breeder mentor - you know someone who has helped you with what tests needed to be done and assisted you in finding a health tested male.

5IyJoLM8aa	This unfortunate illness is called coprophagia.  Vets say that this is due to a lack of specific nutrients in their diet.  I personally think it's out of sheer boredom.  There is actually a pill that you can buy to make their poop less appealing.  The good news is that there is 120 tablets in the bottle, and the dose is something like 1 tablet per 10 or 20 lbs.  The downside is for someone like me who has 3 dogs....I went through 1 bottle in 3 days!  I would try this and/or vitamin supplements.|`|EeJMITyCaa	You can put chunks of pineapple in his food.

Just thought I'd share.  |`|0f3fde633bd5c269a5dc7fc600702cccaa	There is a commercial product called Forbid,basically its just MSG, you can put it on his food to make the stools so foul that he can't eat them.  Better than putting chemicals on your dogs food try to house train him.  Coprophagia is a common problem in puppy's that they usually out grow.  If you just make sure there is no stools available for him to eat he can't do it.  If he is still pooping in the house you need to do some crate training.|`|aInY5go2aa	Try sprinkling meat tenderizer in his food. It makes the poop less appetizing to them.
CqQ1DaKDaa	You've had a lot of answers already but I just wanted to give you my advise.  An outdoor rabbits regular life span is commonly known as 4-6 years.  An indoor rabbits regular life span is nearly 10 years.  So as you can guess that rabbits live longer indoors. There are a lot of debates about indoor/outdoor rabbits. I do believe that rabbits kept under the right conditions can be kept outside, so long as they're in big hutches with attatched runs with other rabbits they've been sucessfully bonded with. However, in my opinion I think rabbits are indoor pets like cats and dogs, though you can keep both outside in some cases.   Rabbits are very easy to house train. My bunny was so much easier to house train than my jack russel. Their cages tend not to take up that much space, and overall it can be very fun for both you and your rabbit. Expecially a rabbit that is by themselves. You see rabbits are VERY sociable creatures and live in groups in the wild. The like company and to be talked to, my bunny just likes to watch me do my hair and steals stuff to get attention. The main problem with outdoor rabbits is that no one really wants to go sit out in the freezing cold or bad weather and play with their rabbit, so they get very lonely and depressed. And the depression can lead to a very early death.   I'm not saying you have to bring your rabbit indoor as they may be difficult for you, I am only asking that you take in my advice and decide whats best for both you and your rabbit. For information about bringing your rabbit indoors or just general care for your rabbit then please visit my website: www.pixibunni.webs.com or email me. (my adress is on the site and on my yahoo page)  I hope you and your bunny are fine :)  Raych  xox|`|4gcTZNZBaa	He is preserving energy.  This weather will kill him get him in now or find another home for him!!!!  He will die if u leave him out there!!!!|`|RYRhMyh7aa	I have two rabbits that live outside. One likes to stay in the run unless the sun is out while the other is outside the run all the time. I think that it just depends on the rabbit. Do you cover him up at night? I put a camping trap over mine at night so they can stay warm.|`|VUfT35UQaa	Awww! Your poor bunny is saving his energy keeping warm and so not moving!  He will get ill if you leave him out there! keep him warm in the house, and if you cant keep him in the house, put him in a shed which has a SAFE electric heater (nothing that will start a fire) that isn't blowing hot air directly at him (that will annoy him).    edit: Also, if he has already ben out in the clod for so long, take him to a vet to get checked up!|`|pUaGFbzaaa	dude it's pretty obvious put him inside you tard!  common sense dude put him in or bye bye bunny|`|OBW6nzkLaa	my bunny lives outdoors in my shed and hes alright .. i bring him in to play everyday for about 3-4 hours in the winter  maybe you should do that too if your worried about him being in the cold .xx.:)|`|yjT6ToTCaa	As long as you provide a warm place to get out of the weather he should be fine. They know when they need to get warm, unless he is sick then he may need some help, but as long as he is healthy let him decide where he wants to sit.|`|aoHjYqrHaa	your rabbit should not be out side in below 0 degrees water not even should he live out there that can cause death.of course im sure he's cold.what is wrong with you that's like animal abuse.get him inside of the house not outside in a hutch|`|tBJZ3RtQaa	well as they say rabbits like the cold better than the heat but if it is below 0 degrees than at least go and buy him a indoor cage and put him in the house or in the garage...( or at least somewhere where it is a lil warmer)|`|eM1kHW1saa	if i were u id get him checked over and get him inside|`|VXVwevE4aa	Hiya, I have two rabbits who live inside but get outside via a cat flap.  They can come and go as they please but the flap is locked when it gets dark.  My 2 always come inside when it is cold as they have a choice. Although they have fur coats as people often say, they still get cold and should NOT be out in this weather.  Bring them inside before they die.  Wild rabbits have their family to snuggle into and keep warm, your rabbit is on its own.  No matter how much hay and paper they have they will always be cold and lonely.  Vision yourself being out all night in the freezing cold.  If in doubt, speak to your local S.P.C.A.  They will give you free advice.|`|naVUguuHaa	Haha, I love all these people saying "He'll die!!!!!!!1111".    Rabbits do really well in cold weather, surprisingly. Put some plastic over his hutch to block chilly wind, and give him lots of hay to nest in (never yarn, or cotton balls!), and he'll be fine.|`|6So3uHtRaa	For my rabbit we put thick bubble wrap around his hutch and tie it on. We then remove it in the summer. We also have a clear plastic cover to cover the open part so he isnt in the wind. If he is walm when he sleeps then he should become more lively during the day.    Also his age could be effecting his livelyness. If he is old he will get cold easily.     I think he will probably just be preserving his energy though so I would worry. If possible remove the run during the night or put something to stop him getting to it. Make a little nest with his hay. This will encourage him to burrow.|`|Eu3zSfRkaa	he will be fine my rabbits outside most of the time and hes outside toight and it has been colder and he is only 12 weeks and he is all warm and cozy in his hutch he actuallt likes it outside so just think of the wild bunnys they are outside so why cant are bunnys be outside in a hutch

You're throwing off the vitamin mixes and protein concentrations by mixing it with baby food.  And because he's not eating crickets, you need to just mix it with water.    You can keep trying with the crickets, but some just don't figure it out, or only figure it out when they see another one eating crickets.  Good luck.|`|F2rNfOQQaa	he may be sick at the moment, he really doesnt like them, or hes just not trusting you yet. best of luck|`|ahci6qGUaa	hes trying to tell u they taste like crap|`|5nseONR7aa	He's not hungry.

I would keep it on the diet it is currently on as long as it is eating. If it also stops eating the food you're currently giving it the only option I can think of is to take it to a vet.
Qas05nZraa	golden retriever|`|2R1H8B8taa	hey there!    If you want a dog, you have to have someone let it out during the day. At least once, if not twice. Being gone for that long without letting the dog relieve itself will only cause you frustration, as it will make a mess in your house.    With that, if you can have the dog walked or let out, a beagle would be a very good companion. They are small but energetic.|`|MvX2Hg9Taa	i wouldn't get a puppy if you are going to be gone that long. OR at least not a untrained puppy. Also if you are going to get one and going to be gone that much you should think about crate training them. Because even the best dog in the world can get so board one day it rips something up.|`|AA12069383	That's kinda too long for your dog to be alone|`|X0kqaRRaaa	Your best bet would to be to get a stuffed dog. That way he won't be lonely while you're at school, the size wouldn't really matter then. It wouldn't shed like real dogs naturally do; you would save the little time that you would have on a real dog for the training issue.  Wait until you have more time to actually be there for a real dog ; one who you could train that you would be gone ALL day; one who you could take the time not to tear all the furniture up, one who you could could comb or groom so as not to shed everywhere. In the long-run, you would have that good companion.|`|nI8G21y8aa	Boston Terrier  Border collie|`|Yn3InySlaa	To be honest, those hours are a bit long to leave a dog on it's own on a regular basis and most of them would be chewing furniture, your shoes and anything else if left alone for 9 hours.  I honestly wouldn't recommend it because it wouldn't be fair to the dog; they need their people around as much as possible.|`|KT9J9n9uaa	Saw that someone suggested a beagle: just a heads up, my family just got a beagle puppy and she is very sweet but also completely crazy/a little frightening when she has energy. She's very needy (in terms of attention) and loves to be around people, so just be aware that a young beagle (or any puppy for that matter) may not be able to handle long hours on its own, and if you left it uncaged, he/she might destroy your belongings.    On another note, if you really want a dog with your hours, you should look into rescue/shelter options. You might find a good match in an older dog, and they'd probably be more calm, stable, and comfortable with longer hours alone. Plus, they'd really appreciate your company when you do arrive home!    And after going through this puppy stage, although they are adorable I really like our new beagle, when the time comes for me to get my own, I'm pretty set on adopting an older rescue dog.
1mYIF1uYaa	Yes, some of them are like that. It is not necessary that all of them bark. It depends on their personality too...    As long as I read your explanation, he is just a friendly dog, maybe. And also smart. That is not rare, and I know many dogs that doesn't act like their normal behavior according to their breed.|`|d7bcedc128f094df6e910173d672703eaa	First of all, he's just a baby at 4 months old. Second, if you are concerned, perhaps you should check to see if he can hear.  Maybe he's deaf?  Clap you hands and see if he turns to your direction to look. If he has been responding to your voice and other sounds he's ok.  Other than that, be patient and wait for him to mature. "Be careful what you wish for."|`|q0vKbocHaa	you should be proud that your dog doesn't bark! Many, many people try a very hard to achieve what you did and you did it accidently.

To this day i still think the majority of them don't bark to much. Barking shows excitement and/or fear and they were bred to fight so...  You can teach your dog to bark(but im sure your neighbors wouldn't like that so much) but there definitely isn't anything wrong with your dog.|`|o2ekfo8Faa	Pit bull dogs (the american pit bull terrier in particular) have been bred not to be aggressive towards people. It is a very common trait for them to greet strangers like they've known them forever. They also don't usually bark, which is a blessing for some people.    I've got one who's a bit odd, though. She'll bark whenever the other dogs start to bark, and woe to the one who comes with bad intentions, she has been known to act aggressive towards shady people.    But your dog sounds like he's acting like your typical pit bull. The friendliest guy on earth.

8cuPVvYnaa	Here are some suggestions:    1) Take him out first thing in the morning when he is certain to need to go. Take him to the same spot always to go pee and poop. Command him to go poop or pee. If he does praise him excitedly & give the best treat you can (I used a small bite of meat). When you praise him say "Good pee" or "Good poop" (reinforce the command words)    2) Save the special treat (hopefully fresh cooked meat) for just when he's gone pee or poop. Don't give the best treats at ANY other time until he is potty trained so that he really wants to do what you ask to get it.    3) After he's succeeded with the am pee (which he should) then take him out automatically every 2 or 3 hrs to give him another chance.    4) In addition, watch for when he starts to lift his leg inside and quickly pick him up and say "no" and then bring him outside. Be sure to clean up the spot well since the smells in the house will encourage him to continue to do it inside.    5) Lastley, as far as pooping, always take him out right after eating as well as watching for sniffing the ground, squatting, etc.    Good luck!|`|P8Q39vA4aa	grass wont hurt your puppy. and lol it takes a lot of patience and time lol bulldogs are a stubborn bugger.|`|qlCwiXpyaa	he is eating grass because his stomach is upset and its like a medicine. it will make him throw up but it will make him feel better. you will have to start disciplining him when he going potty inside and make sure it is all done outside.|`|okAYAGvXaa	Read a book, any book for Christ's sakes!!!!!!!!!!|`|n7GOiKC0aa	Hi,    Here are the training tips to get your pup potty trained.

KxjUim7yaa	Duhno. Are dogs dancing to it
np6W9hnsaa	It's probably a dominance thing, but you should get him fixed.   Most of the time neutering a  male can decrease or get rid of humping impulses.   Now, until you get him fixed you can work on every time he humps you or your new puppy put him in a closet or bathroom (isolated) for 3 seconds or until he calms down. Make sure he's not barking.   Once you get him fixed do this if he still does some humping, but most likely he will have much less of an impulse to hump.|`|jiwTWNNtaa	His "pink thing" will make appearances throughout his life. You can lessen this with neutering. My female humps my other female as a sign of dominance, but they don't fight over it. The two males will!! You can help this dominance issue by neutering. It won't eliminate it, both my ladies are spayed, but it will certainly cut down on the level of emotion.    He's the perfect age to go get get snipped, so go for it.  Now is the time to assert yourself and you have to let the big dog know that the little dog "belongs" to you. You have to be dominant and stop this behavior that your don't like.|`|KYC0pmH6aa	He may be feeling jealous so he follows you.    If he's not fixed that may be the humping problem. Fixing a dog calms them.    It's normal, they dont care about the gender.|`|q0vKbocHaa	he is showing dominace over that little puppy. He isn't trying to "do it" with him, nor is is gay, he is just showing the new kid who's boss|`|ve0sWDThaa	yes,all of that is normal.He's just excited..once he gets older he'll be able to tell the difference.|`|ydshiNrKaa	This is all normal behavior and your older dog is showing dominance over the younger one.  Please get both dogs neutered as soon as possible.  The older one can be neutered now, and the pup in another 4 or 5 months.  They will get along much better as they get older if they are neutered.|`|RwQmN7Reaa	It's actually very common for male dogs to do this to other dogs, yes even males, and also other animals. It's a dominance thing.|`|qlCwiXpyaa	he is still a youngster and doesnt know the different. its normal so you will need to get him fixed!|`|okAYAGvXaa	What is cool here, that the most dog illiterate "questions" come from owners of the Pitties. No wonder they are pushing for BSL.|`|bicAgoycaa	Same sex humping does not mean he's trying to mate. Humping is a sign of dominance for dogs. But if you do not get him fixed, it will get worse. Odds are, It won't stop the dominance humping all the way around, but it will lessen it, and it will stop him from trying to hump things other than dogs.    Also, you'll find out that he'll be more interested in you when you're on your cycle... watch your legs until you get him fixed.|`|VDy99i3oaa	It is normal, don't worry. It's just like human puberty. If you get him neutered it will reduce the urge, it probably won't go away completely since he's already begun to get the urges. Humping the other dog is also normal, and he does know the difference between boys and girls. He could be doing this for several reasons, to establish dominance over the other dog or just to release the feelings. To prevent it, just don't allow him to do it. I always used a spray bottle with water, whenever he does it just spray him with the water. It's totally harmless and since he won't like it he'll quickly learn to associate humping the other dog with getting water in his face and stop.|`|fe447af35c529588ddeb8f78da7b83faaa	Happens all the time!!! For various reasons! Humans, non humans... just whenever.    When I was at puppy class with my dogs.  A young puppy would hump the other dogs.  Our trainer mentioned it was a form of playing for them and that it did not have to do with dominance or anything sexual.  This might be the same for your dog not sure as I know he is not a puppy anymore.
HDiSjSHiaa	I would take her to a vet as soon as you can.     Vomitting can be a sign of many illnesses such as a gastric infection, parvo, kennel cough and even furballs (yes dogs can get them)     Keep an eye on her water and food intake. If she isn't drinking she could become dehydrated.   Is she still eating her food?   Have you changed her food lately?  Is he pee a normal colour?  Does she have diahriah? (spelling)  Is she lethargic?    Usually when a dog vomits bile, there may be another symptom to go along with it.    I highly doubt it's the chocolate. Usually they would have to eat a HUGE amount for it to effect them.    Good luck to you and your pooch.  Let us know how she does at the vet.|`|gwUMipsUaa	Maybe.  Take her to a vet.|`|lcg1u1U7aa	No, it isn't the chocolate would have acted as a cardiac stimulant and the effect would only have lasted for a few hours.

Dark chocolate is ESPECIALLY more poisonous to a dog than milk or white chocolate.  A chocolate bar is enough to KILL a larger dog.    The yellow liquids are Bile.    Take her to the vet as soon as you can, unless you don't mind burying your animal before it's time.|`|np6W9hnsaa	I'd take her to a vet as soon as possible, though chocolate usually has an immediate affect.|`|WcdXFaBaaa	yah i go with apricot snow girl. but ur dog might ..........................DIE|`|qlCwiXpyaa	its bile. it wasnt enough to harm her, just an upset stomach. if you are worried, talk to your vet.|`|nI8G21y8aa	it could be, cal lyour vet and he might ask you to bring her in|`|tSZ7A1NPaa	Yes. Take her to a vet right away|`|5af8PNwxaa	Best check with your vet.    Chocolate toxicity:    Top     Chocolate contains theobromine, a compound that is a cardiac stimulant and a diuretic.     When affected by an overdose of chocolate, a dog can become excited and hyperactive. Due to the diuretic effect, it may pass large volumes of urine and it will be unusually thirsty. Vomiting and diarrhoea are also common. The effect of theobromine on the heart is the most dangerous effect. Theobromine will either increase the dogs heart rate or may cause the heart to beat irregularly. Death is quite possible, especially with exercise.    After their pet has eaten a large quantity of chocolate, many pet owners assume their pet is unaffected. However, the signs of sickness may not be seen for several hours, with death following within twenty-four hours.    Cocoa powder and cooking chocolate are the most toxic forms. A 10-kilogram dog can be seriously affected if it eats a quarter of a 250gm packet of cocoa powder or half of a 250gm block of cooking chocolate. These forms of chocolate contain ten times more theobromine than milk chocolate. Thus, a chocolate mud cake could be a real health risk for a small dog. Even licking a substantial part of the chocolate icing from a cake can make a dog unwell.     Semi-sweet chocolate and dark chocolate are the next most dangerous forms, with milk chocolate being the least dangerous. A dog needs to eat more than a 250gm block of milk chocolate to be affected. Obviously, the smaller the dog, the less it needs to eat.    Other things dangerous for dogs are:    Onion and garlic poisoning   Top   Onions and garlic are other dangerous food ingredients that cause sickness in dogs, cats and also livestock. Onions and garlic contain the toxic ingredient thiosulphate. Onions are more of a danger.    Pets affected by onion toxicity will develop haemolytic anaemia, where the pets red blood cells burst while circulating in its body.     At first, pets affected by onion poisoning show gastroenteritis with vomiting and diarrhoea. They will show no interest in food and will be dull and weak. The red pigment from the burst blood cells appears in an affected animals urine and it becomes breathless. The breathlessness occurs because the red blood cells that carry oxygen through the body are reduced in number.    The poisoning occurs a few days after the pet has eaten the onion. All forms of onion can be a problem including dehydrated onions, raw onions, cooked onions and table scraps containing cooked onions and/or garlic. Left over pizza, Chinese dishes and commercial baby food containing onion, sometimes fed as a supplement to young pets, can cause illness.      Other potential dangers   Top     Avocado (all parts) - the toxic ingredient in avocado is called persin (toxic amount unknown). Symptoms include difficulty breathing, abdominal enlargement, abnormal fluid accumulations in the chest, abdomen and sac around the heart.

Chocolate is like speed for dogs. You should have made your dog swallow peroxide upon consumption. They do that at vets offices to make a dog throw up. And you should have take your dog to the vet.    Yellow is bile. You NEED to get your dog into the vet ASAP. Your dog is going to just keep throwing up until it gets too late. She could have parvo if you haven't gotten her shots.    You should never let your animals go for more than 48 hours if they're puking like that. I mean, you wouldn't let your child go that long before contacting a doctor.|`|T7SDK8zFaa	GO A HEAD AND TAKE HER TO THE VET BEFORE SHE GETS TO SICK, CAUSE DARK CHOCOLATE IS THE WORST CHOCOLATE FOR A DOG TO HAVE!!!!  TAKE HER TO THE VET RIGHT AWAY.  I HOPE SHE GETS BETTER!!!|`|9E1KRkTpaa	Well, sometimes my dog throws up yellow vile, could that be it? Its pretty wattery, and theres not a whole lot of it. It could be just from coughing, or briefe choking (nothing life threatening.    Dogs have eaten lots more chocholates, and they have been fine. I wouldnt worry too much.     But if it happens more frequently, and gets worse, it probably would be a good idea to take her to the vet... just in case!

ydshiNrKaa	The exact reason for these reverse sneezing episodes is unknown but may be related to allergies, nasal irritants, or nasal inflammation. Any age, breed or sex can be affected.   A reverse sneeze may look disturbing  many people fear that their dog is not breathing during these episodes  but it is not a harmful condition and there are no ill effects. Reverse sneezing attacks are generally quite brief and not life threatening. Between episodes, the dog acts normal.     In some situation when reverse sneezing is frequent, a more serious condition may be the underlying cause. In those situations, testing for nasal mites, nasal cancer should be done.|`|KYC0pmH6aa	Pharyngeal Gag Reflex    It usually occures with terriers as yorkies and shi tzus. But this may be it.

This usually occures when the dog is excited or running, or drinking.      It is harmless and normal|`|okAYAGvXaa	As per both members above. This usually sounds worse than it is.

tMlwcim8aa	My best guess is he just has standards in what water he likes. I have had some guppies do this and when I transferred them to a different tank, he liked those water conditions better, and swam normally, again. If that doesn't help, it really Could be that his tail is super heavy for him. I highly doubt he is sick. Also, it could be he has such a lousy balance do to his size or tail that a high flow of water can knock him around so he goes to the top to get away from it.

They ride, they rope, oh the things that theyve seen!      They wander through the misty hill,  They cross the water  it lain so still    The hoof, it strike, the water with force!  The placid place, is scattered from thy horse!    The ripples exceed the area surrounding,  The ripples are touched by the fathers of founding    The cowboy, he found, this land so great!  Through the terrain, he rides every gait!    He set foot after only one other creature,  This creature is the worlds greatest teacher    The creature, the horse, this four legged being!  Has taught everything that a man could be seeing!    Oh! The things that its taught!  By humans its sought!    But what only Cowboy, he know,  Is that from his steed, inside his mind, he does stow    The secrets of life, that many seek out!

He saddles his horse and rides o'er the range,  City folks find this peculiar and downright strange.    A cowboy tries to tame bucking broncos by riding them down,  Getting right back in the saddle when he gets tossed to the ground.    Cowboys round up stray cattle - it makes for a chase  Bringing them back to the corral - yeah, that's the place.    With his boots, jeans and hat, the cowboy's recognized,  The cowboy's pick-up truck is the item most prized.    There's also the cowboy poets, singing songs so grand,   Praising the life and praising the land ...    (That's as much as I can think of now ...)|`|rTSwouqXaa	Ok this is going to be one of my originals. I have been published a couple times for my poems.     Long lonely hills,  Hot dusty drives.  Bitter long days  punches ornery strays    A lonely life of the cowpoke  Workin' alone with rope in hand  Killer bronc and steers  Each day has no plan    Talkin' to m'horse  Cuz there aint nobody  else to talk to  Why would anybody want this    Then you see a hawk on the wing  A Rocky Mountain sunrise  or a desert sun set  and you pitty city lives    God gave us this trust  for wich we live  Why live in the city  when the country has so much to give.    The poem means the cowboy life sucks! But city life is worse!
xjQs80TYaa	yes! Every time she needs to go out side, leash her and take her to the designated spot where you want her to do her business, try not to let her go anywhere else in the yard. Put a word to her designated spot.. "Go pee" and take her there. Praise her with pats, love and ocassionally a treat. She will get it..as long as Your consistant.    Good Luck.    I can let my 3 dogs loose in the yard, and tell them "get over there" and they will all walk over to the correct spots and do their business. Of course it took time, but now I don't even have to step outside the door :).. and they we all rescued as young adults.|`|fOLO4TNhaa	With consistency, yes.|`|c90696a851f3ee0c6b1f63f7f595eca4aa	Absolutely. You'll just need to walk your dog over to the area and command him or her to "go pee" or whatever command you want to use. Praise them whenever they go in the right area, and it should be an easy learning process.
mFNEbR3Maa	Your mother i can sorta understand her but do a lot of work around the house and try to get good grades if you want a puppy it may be like a long time but me and my friend are breeding and i want you to have a puppy so yay just follow my steps and maybe you can tell her how you will do everything that the dog needs and does so sit down and talk to your mom good luck and i wish you the best of luck in the future with any animals and P.S. get a short haired dog they dont really shed but i hope yuo are able to get a dog                                                          THNX                                                 Elisabeth|`|d8WtO3iRaa	"People" are right. There's not much you can do. You are living under her roof and if she doesn't want a dog in the house, you should respect her wishes. You will have plenty of time when you're on your own to get one. In the meantime, you can always do something like start a dog walking/playing business for your neighbors. You could even just volunteer. That way you still get you fill of time with dogs.|`|kBjzKyZyaa	Do your research on different breeds and the maintenance of a dog, make a pro and con sheet for the breeds you thing would best suit your family, (example what shed, size it will get, known health problems, Intelligent) and then go and talk to her about all of the information you have found out. By taking the time and doing the research your are showing her that you are being responsible. Also do research on the cost of having a dog (vet bills, food, toys, obedience classes, ect.) and make sure it is something that you can afford. Being informed when you talk to her and speaking to her like an adult it your best method of getting through to her.|`|RFfTjnxzaa	Nothing you can do about the fact that your mother isn't a dog lover. She doesn't want the responsibility, vet bills, and the commitment of owning a dog, and for all you know she has a good reason for it. Owning a dog isn't a cheap nor easy hobby.    But if you are willing to take up all the responsibility (walking the dog, training the dog, grooming the dog, feeding the dog), then you can explain to her that a properly housebroken dog will not be doing her business on the carpet. There are breeds who shed very little, like the Havanese, Maltese, Scottie, and some "designer breeds".    Also, you will want to get a male.    Show her you are responsible by doing your homework, getting good grades, doing your chores correctly, etc.|`|3891fcebb566f7370dbbd6418e15f386aa	I feel you!  I always wanted a dog but my mom didn't. I had to wait until I was on my own before I could get one.  The fact is... A dog should never be brought into a house where not everyone in the household agrees on having a pet.  I didn't understand this until I began working with animals and now I see the differences in dogs that are wanted by the entire family and dogs that are only wanted by part of the family.  Dogs sense when they are not wanted and this usually causes behavioral issues such as, aggression, nervous peeing, potty training issues, social disorders, etc. While this isn't always the case, in my experience it's 98% the case. I know this isn't the answer you wanted to hear but if you would really like to have a nice, mentally healthy dog.... wait.  It will be worth it.|`|PM23RDycaa	You can't make her like dogs if she does not like them. Listen to the people around you they know what they are talking about and all you are doing is further pissing your mother off. Wait until you are an adult and living on your own.    It's HER house and HER rules. She's said no, now grow up and act like the mature teenager you claim to be and accept that you are not getting a dog.|`|NDHiLwaLaa	Well, to convince your mom that you are responsible enough to own a dog why don't you ask her if you can keep a smaller pet like a goldfish or a turtle or a hamster. Then your mom might realize that you are very capable and responsible enough to keep a dog if you do good taking care of a smaller animal! Oh and by the way if your mom doesn't want fur on the floor try getting a dog breed that doesn't shed as much. And if she doesn't want pee on the carpet use a proper method of house training and your mom will be convinced in no time. I wish you the best of luck :)|`|q5DTcOuaaa	Is she religious? Tell her dog is God spelled backwards and you one for your house.|`|ydshiNrKaa	Sorry,but if your mom doesn't want the responsibility of caring for a dog then nothing you can say to her is going to change her mind.  From what you said she doesn't even like them so don't expect her to change her mind.  Instead of annoying her with asking for something you are not going to get, see if you can volunteer at an animal rescue group or the humane society to get some interaction with dogs.  The rescue group or humane society will appreciate your help and you will get to work with all kinds of dogs.|`|6RqjxUTnaa	well it won't be easy find a dog That suits her. Tell her you can asopt a short haired dog that won't shed alot you'll vacume eveery day. it will make you more responsible,and please don't get mad because i brung this up. Also tell her you can keep it outdoors in the day or full time so no pee or fur will be on the Carpet. tell her you'll get a Boy so it won't get pregnant. Also it will be good for your lil bro, because when he's older ,and starts to explore he'll need a friend to protect him.You can get a little dog so it wont even be like Having a dog more like a cat. Then just tell her PLEASE mom you won't regret it I need this! Thats all sorry if it dosnt work i never had to worry about it my mom loves dogs guess im lucky. Hope This Helps.
qpCMz1zAaa	I have a 5 month old smooth mini that I've had for almost 2 1/2 months. The best advice I read was to take them out directly from the crate on the leash, to the same spot, everytime. Let the dog sniff a bit, but don't let them play. If they don't go, they can go back into the crate and try again in a bit.     If you are taking the pup out every 15 minutes, he probably doesn't get that it is potty time instead of activity time.

He has learned from them. but if you don't have any other dogs just keep trying on the crate training. and maybe until he is older keep him in only one spot in your house. Ex. living room. and just block off all the other rooms so he cant potty in those hard to find spots.    i wish you good luck!|`|KxjUim7yaa	I have 2 Dachshunds and had no trouble potty training. I crate trained them and took them out every 2 hrs, I have no kids at home so the dogs got 100% of my time. They were confined to a small cleanable area in case of accidents. The problem is letting them out to have the run of the house. Have the kids go to the puppy area not the other way around.    Use Nature's Miracle on accident spots|`|kUnvlr3Oaa	Hi... :)  Dachshunds are great dogs but some of them can be very stubborn with house training.  How old is he?  It takes time.  Just keep remembering patience and lots of rewards and praise (when he does go potty outside).  Kennel training can feel tough but its best to stick with it.  Just tell your kids they have to wait to let the puppy out until you can watch him (to make sure he is not sneaking off to go potty).  Best of luck!|`|vn5Y7qgsaa	I have written an article for people like you.    Please see the article on my site    at http://www.dachshundgifts.org    Best wishes, Link

aP4bkYOCaa	Around 2 years old, and only after you've gotten his health testing scores back.|`|VxKH7KHmaa	Once he is 2 yrs old, has his conformation championship, and all of his genetic health tests results cleared....otherwise he should not be bred.|`|D15q5cz6aa	If you cannot answer this question, then you are not really in a good position to even think about breeding. Do some research on this breed and learn more about this sort of thing, or simply consult your vet.  If you are worried about your dog mating with another then if he can do it, he really is old enought isnt he?. time to have your animal de sexed before you get unwanted puppies. Many small breeds of male dogs can breed very young, ie 6 months old. do the breed a favour and have your pup desexed.|`|OuI5eFcmaa	I believe that the answer is the same for all male K9s, which is - at least 1 yr. old (for female it's 2 yrs.).  The problem with studding any sooner is that when the couple becomes "tied" a younger dog may get freaked out and hurt itself.
3268e8d024b704cf849382ae55cd77ceaa	You don't say if this is a breed show or open show.  But western pleasure classes are basically the same.  Different breed associations have different requirements about what you can and can't wear.      The whole idea is to look nice and compliment your horse.  Remember, you are showing your horse and not yourself in WP classes.  You want the judge to notice your horse, not you.  So don't overdo the bling on yourself or your horse.  Be sure any bling/decorations comliments you.  Try to match your blouse with your saddle blanket/pad.  If you have a blue blanket then wear a blouse that has some blue in it too.  The color should compliment your horse not blend in with it.  Don't wear all black on a black horse.  Do not wear blue jeans.  Wear western cut colored show pants.  Boot cut is best.  Make sure they are long enough to cover your heel when in the saddle.  Basic colors such as tan, brown, and black work well.  Your pants must not be faded, torn, or stained.  Your blouse should be neat, pretty, and have long sleeves.  It does not have to have a lot of glitter and such on it.  Make sure it compliments your saddle pad.  You can also wear a nice vest or a fitted jacket.  If you opt for this be sure it compliments your saddle pad.  Your blouse can be solid colored when wearing a vest or jacket that has a pattern on it.  Be sure your blouse is buttoned all the way up and is tucked in.  Ties are optional.  If the neck area of your blouse is plain you may want to add a tie or a western brooch pin at the neck.  Be sure your boots also match your outfit and that they are clean and not all scruffed up.  A little spit and polish go a long way.  A nice belt and buckle is needed.  The belt should be same color as your boots or close to it.  Your hat should fit you well and be properly shaped.  It too should go with your outfit and should be neat and clean.  Chaps are optional.  Be sure they fit well and go with your outfit.  Your pants should match your chaps.  They must cover your heel and your pants.  Your hair must also be neat and should be pinned up if long.  Long ponytails can be tacky and will cover your number if worn on your back.  Use a nice barrett or a bow/hairnet combo.  For the final touches you can add earrings, a little makeup, a pretty hatband, ect.      Good luck and have lots of fun.|`|yY6Aj1xpaa	I see there are still some "died in the wool" people who truly believe that blue jeans are the "in" ticket for WP classes......that you wear jeans under chaps......wrong number!!!  Those in the know color coordinate their outfits, everything from pants, chaps, saddle blankets, hats, shirts, etc.....Avail yourself of Showtimeshowclothing.com, Pards, Sergeants Western Wear, particulary look for Carol Metcalf in their ads; you will not find her dressing like a schmuck with jeans under her chaps unless she's riding the working cow horse classes.      http://www.showtimeshowclothing.com/    http://www.karenskustoms.com/clotheswest...    http://www.winningstitches.com/index.htm    http://www.conniescustoms.com/|`|3LXbUg1raa	Just to say, the people that already answered, minus the very first poster, gave you very good answers to your question...    Blue jeans are a definite No.  The only time you will ever see blue jeans is maybe if the rider has blue chaps, it's a guy, and it is in one of the low level shows...you'll almost never see it beyond the very low show levels.  Some bling is nice, but don't over do things, as you don't want to be looking tacky or taking away from your horse...also remember that the more 'shiny things' you have on you, the more light is reflected off of you and it may make it look as though you are moving more than you'd want, especially if you have a horse that is a little on the more rougher/bouncier side...it can work against you by making it appear that there is more motion going on, when there might not actually be...Matching western hat, boots, and a nice western belt complete with buckle would complete the outfit...and always remember to have pants that are the same color, or as close to the same color, as your chaps.|`|AA10986942	You have alot of good answers here but you do need to clarify what kind of show you are going to... 4-H fun show?  Local all breed show?  fair show?  AQHA show?  there are all different levels of shows so there are all different levels of expected dress....  for a 4-H fun show or a very small local show you would look way over dressed if you dressed the same way as you would for a AQHA show...  But always remember to invest in the basics and that starts with a NICE hat!  Nothing ruins the picture worse than a crappy old cowboy hat.. buy the best one you can afford and have it shaped for your face, learn how to care for it ie: never touch the brim, only handle it by the crown always store it upside down in a hat box to protect it,  after the hat you will need a well fitting pair of chaps, someone said theses are optional but not if you are trying to look like you know what you are doing... and then your boots.  These three should all be the same color, hat, chaps and boots.  If it is just a small show you can wear a nice, well fitting not baggy western shirt.  wear a neck scarf that the same color as your hat, chaps and boots.  Make sure you do not wear your number on your back!  Print up the number you want to use on a computer then take it and get laminated.  You will need 3 one for each side of your saddle pad and another to pin to your shirt or jacket if you show in halter or showmanship.  If you are showing bigger shows then you need to go to Hobby horse .com and read about what to wear for what class.  The biggest mistake I see at small shows is that peoples clothes dont fit nice, they are too baggy and that maks them look sloppy.  It is easy to take in a western shirt all it takes is someone with a sewing machine that can just sew up the sides and down the sleeves... so good luck and I hope everyone gave you some ideas!|`|hEXb1unraa	never wear jeans in a pleasure class....its tacky ,    wear the same color pants as your chaps....Black, or tan is a good standard, you can go to Hobby horse clothing  http://www.hobbyhorseinc.com/  this site will give you some ideas on what to look for, chaps boots, hats and tops.|`|6Ey9TYIhaa	great, i kn answer this one!  I do barrel racing and I think you need wranglers ( brand of jean), and definetly cow boy boots which may cost some more....mine were 150$  anyway, and then you would want 2 coordinate the outfit with a fancy western shirt that is long sleeved ( nice patterned), and maybe a nice belt ( I have one that i got from lammel's and omg, it has diamonds all around it, its soo blingy)  heres a good tip:  Western pleasure and any kind of western event is BLINGY, gotta have lots of jewels and studs and shiny stuff  A helmet would also be good, unless your so skilled that you can wear a coy boy hat!  try to match the outfit and remember....BLING BLING BLING
ydshiNrKaa	I have an electric fence for my dog and he has done very well with the fence.  If you train them properly on the use of the fence, and the audible tone the collar makes, your dog may never get shocked at all.  The trick with the fence is taking the time and doing the training properly and not rushing the procedure.  My dog learned the boundaries and everything in about 3 weeks time.  He did go through it once, but that was only because I did not have the collar on him correctly.  It is true that once they get out you have to go out after them, take the collar off and lead them back in, but this rarely happens.  I love my fence and there are several people at the dog park where I go that have it also and like it.  Just don't rush the training and you'll do fine.|`|TPpTAKAdaa	I think electric fences are ideal for some dogs, especially larger ones, becuase smaller dogs are more prone to escape.  But they work really well.  Dogs are smart, and will learn not to leave the yard becasue of teh invisible fence.  They will only get shocked maybe once or twice in the beginning and the shock only lasts a second.  Besides, they look nicer and are cheaper than regular fences.|`|37Tl4cvXaa	negative on the electric fence idea.|`|lD3RQhYiaa	its crule! just my opinion|`|2BUCOTaJaa	yeah get an electric fence then tie him 2 it with a chain. he wont run away anymore.|`|9tMDxwHeaa	I've used the electric fenc for both small and big dogs, and I have never had a problem.

What happens when other things can't be kept out?    No. You need a real fence and some time exercising your dog.|`|CkecSp4Uaa	I would never use one as a means of containment when you aren't there to directly supervise your dog.  They don't really work that well to keep a dog in the fence...all the dog has to do is break through the barrier ONCE and most dogs will figure out that they only have to put up with a few seconds of discomfort in order to be free.  Invisible fences also won't keep people from coming into your yard and snatching your dog when you aren't watching him.  Or keep other animals that might hurt him out.  Your dogs might be "great" with their invisible fences for now...but I'd rather be the one consoling them when their dog breaks loose and is hit by a car than to take their advice and trust one for my own dog.|`|CtYqMs5Paa	They don't work for every dog...in some cases the "shock" isn't enough of a deterrent to keep the dog in the yard when something more appealing seems possible beyond the fence.|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	i have neighbor with it and works pretty good. i think if that is what you want go for it. they work good and your dog will of coarse abide by it for sure.
fe447af35c529588ddeb8f78da7b83faaa	When our dog got neutered the vets didn't even give him a cone and we had to purchase one.  We got the right size but he kept taking it off as it was one that didn't attch to his leash.  Anyways, he ended up taking out his own stitches and licking it (without us noticing) We took him to the vet and she said that it looked fine even though he had licked it.      The vet told us it rarely gets infected it just gets irritated. So you should be fine.    Having said that when we were shopping for a cone the one vets we went to suggested we  wrap a towel up and put it around his neck (not too tight of course) that limits their head movement too.  You might be able to do that to make sure he can't reach his stiches. You could do this with the cone on too. I'm not sure exactly how you would get the towel to stay but I guess you would roll it up and then maybe duct tape it to itself around the dogs neck (they stressed the importance of it being loose)|`|pOgzmCn2aa	There will be some rubbing on the stitches, because if he can not lick them, he more than likely will drag himself!     The best thing to do, is monitor him, and if he keeps trying for the stitches, then say "Nuh uh!" (avoid using "no", because it's too common of a word, and dogs can sometimes easily be confused) and do something like clap your hands.    If you are worried about the cone still being too small, Petsmart sells cones for relatively cheap --you can pick one up there, and they're open on Sundays. :)|`|m4uDn0ofaa	I would just watch him for now.  Something you could try is to distract him when you think he is getting too close to the stitches.  Call his name and when he looks at you tell him "Good boy!" and play with him for a while.  Hope this helps and I hope he heals soon!
3891fcebb566f7370dbbd6418e15f386aa	I agree with Linze2go.... SD and Iams/Eukanuba  FACT: The ingredient list is full of cheap fillers that are hard to digest. Its virtually a whos who list of the cheapest, lowest quality ingredients possible. According to Science Diets web site, as of 9/6/03 these ingredients are used in Science Diet dog foods. Here they are along with Naturas explanations in parenthesis.     CORN MEAL (corn is considered to be highly allergenic)   SOYBEAN MEAL RUN (referred to as 'floor sweepings'...nothing more than inexpensive filler w/ little or no nutritional value.)   CHICKEN BY-PRODUCT MEAL (questionable nutritional value...much less expensive and less digestible than chicken meal)   PEANUT HULLS (no nutritional value whatsoever, concerns regarding level of residual fungicides that soak into peanut hulls...used exclusively as a filler   CORN GLUTEN MEAL (there is no justification for the use of corn gluten in dog foodsonly a cheap protein filler)   SOYBEAN MEAL (poor quality protein filler. Meat protein is better absorbed and retained and higher in essential amino acids like methionine, arginine, and taurine. Soybean meal has a biologic value less than 50% of that of chicken meal.)   SORGHUM (low digestibility)   BREWERS RICE (lower quality rice product...missing many of the nutrients found in ground rice and ground brown rice)   ANIMAL FAT (byproduct of meat meal processing...origin of the contributing animals is never known.)     FACT: Animal fat is rendered from an unkown mix of animals that includes euthanized pets, roadkill, tumors, fetal tissue, and dead, dying, diseased & disabled animals in various stages of decay that do no meet USDA standards. The euthanized pets often contain Pheno Barbital, which is the drug used to euthanize them. This drug survives the rendering process and thus makes it into pet food. The FDA has confirmed that euthanized pets are an ingredient in pet foods. The California Veterinary Medical Assoc. confirmed that rendered products can legally include dead pets processed in rendering plants. Colgate-Palmolive, Science Diets parent company, owns one of the largest rendering factories in the country.     CHICKEN LIVER FLAVOR (used in pet foods primarily as a flavor enhancercan potentially contain a disproportionate amount of toxins from the blood.)   BHA, BHT and ETHOXYQUIN. All 3 are proven to cause cancer. BHT & BHA are banned for human consumption in Europe and Australia. Ethoxyquin is manufactured by Monsanto for use as a rubber preservative. Yes, the same thing thats holding your Goodyears together is being used by Science Diet to feed your dog. Ethoxyquin containers are marked POISON. It is listed by the FDA as an insecticide and by OSHA as a hazardous chemical.     FACT: Whole Dog Journal, a monthly periodical dedicated to canine health, conducts a yearly review of dog foods. This publication is largely unbiased based on the fact that they do not accept advertising. Needless to say, none of Science Diets products made their list of top foods. In fact, Science Diet Natures Best with Real Beef and Purina Beneful were the only two specifically mentioned as the worst dog foods based on their lack of worthwhile ingredients.     FACT: According to WDJ, high quality foods should contain the following:   1-Superior sources of protein, either whole fresh meats or single source meat meal (ex. chicken meal rather than poultry meal)   2-A whole-meat source as one of the first two ingredients.     Most SD products contain chicken by-product meal as the only meat protein source, and is either the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th ingredient.     According to WDJ, high quality foods should contain a MINUMUM of the following:   1-Food fragments such as brewer's rice and wheat bran. Beware any food that includes several fragments.   2-Meat by-products - any food that contains meat by-products as the MAJOR protein source indicates a low-quality product.     FACT: SDs philosophy is to use the cheapest ingredients possible. Most of their foods are extremely high in both food fragments and chicken by-product meal.     FACT: As an example, here is the ingredient list for SD Sensitive Skin Adult: Brewers rice, corn meal, corn gluten meal, chicken by-product meal, dried egg product, vegetable oil, animal fat. flaxseed, chicken liver flavor.     Notice the ONLY meat protein is cheap chicken by-product meal? It is listed as the 4th ingredient. All the other ingredients are cheap fillers. This is a typical Science Diet product.     According to WDJ, high quality foods should NEVER contain:     1-Fats or proteins named generically (ex. animal fat/poultry fat instead of beef fat/ lamb meal)   2-Artificial preservatives (BHA, BHT, ethoxyquin)     FACT: SD uses animal fat in most of its dog foods. They use BHA/BHT/ethoxyquins as a fat preservative in many of its foods.     FACT: According to SD, a 40  dog requires up to 3 cups/day. The same dog requires only up to 2 cups of Innova or Wellness dog foods. They need|`|c41001e4efe8816ae7efff5a40520a47aa	I work at a pet store that stocks and trains on ALL brands of food.  What I have been trained is go into your local pet store that stocks ALL brand foods.  They will ALWAYS put the BEST pet food in the first isles.

Look what they labeled Mediocre food, shelves in the middle.  You find Science diet and Iams.  I personally feed my 5 rescue dogs Nutromax.  They love it!

Qe04KxYoaa	All dogs can bite and the fact that this was bred by an irresponsible breeder makes it more likely to be aggressive.|`|0NUj2CNXaa	uhmm. all dogs act differently though :( mine is soo harmless he won't even hurt a fly|`|7fb9ba045d96cd607bd916c4c659256caa	Schnauzers can be very tough and aggressive. Did you get him as a puppy?  Most of the time it is just a matter of teaching them not be aggressive. Like a simple correction and then leash the dog up if he continues. If the dog gets worked up take the dog away from the situation. Schnauzers talk a lot  trash, and will get into fights with bigger dogs. I tried a lot of different methods. But the only one that worked was, fighting = you getting a beaten. Even now he looks at me and I tell him, you go after that dog, you going get it. Other that never use fear to train a Schnauzer. They will just lock up and not learn. Awarding good behavior is always better.|`|RFfTjnxzaa	You're talking about a Schnoodle?    I know several, and as far as I know they have never gotten aggressive in any way.    If you're so worried about this "breed", perhaps you should consider another one?    Please remember that Schnoodles are not a recognized purebred by any reputable registry (AKC, UKC, CKC).    If you're planning on spaying or neutering your new puppy, why not try adopting? Shelter dogs are generally up to date with shots and have already been spayed/neutered (but some shelters jump the gun and fix before 6 months which is too young, so be careful).
zXknLaTlaa	I love Shetland Sheepdogs they were my first dog and they will be my last. They are a lot of work , they have a double coat so brushing is a must at least once a week or more if you can do it.  Most of us just see this as bonding time. Just like any dog when they are young you must keep an eye on them, lots of chew toys and playing is a must. You should really crate train, this gives them a safe place to go to when they need alone time and when you are gone to school, this goes for any dog. The sheltie needs human interaction, they need to be indoors with their pack ( you and your family) . They do settle down as they get older, so they play when you play and sleep when you need to read or watch TV. As with any dog this breed will pick the human in the family they want to be with so don't be hurt if it's not you. This breed is a people pleaser, they want everybody in their pack to be happy and they will lick your tears when you cry and bark with joy when your happy. They are a sweet and gentle soul that loves endlessly. If you can't be there for them or take of them correctly then don't get one. But if you do get one, you can tell them anything and they'll never tell your secrets. Good Luck and I hope you make the right choice for you and the dog.|`|C9xguzBXaa	Yorkie they are the best dogs ever !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1|`|Z11DKA9Gaa	pittbull yea|`|Cr0TWTSLaa	if you read a book and research. ill go with a pit bull.    i am 17 and i got a pure bred american pit bull terrier and he is a year now. very easy to train.

What's your lifestyle like? Shelties were bred to herd and as a result they are highly intelligent and require a lot of exercise. If you're not up to providing obedience training and providing long walks and lots of exercise, this breed might not be for you. They can become destructive when they're bored.    Personally, I think you should head down to the local animal shelter and explain to the staff that you've never had a dog before.. and then tell them what you're looking for in an animal. Chances are they have exactly what you're looking for, and for $100 or so you'll get a new best friend that will come already vetted, microchipped, vaccinated and altered.

DSzG23WRaa	Go to counseling. I don't want to sound awful, but you need some help. Not from us either. Professional help. Get over your cat's death before you bring another pet into your life. Seriously. Good luck to you.|`|CkecSp4Uaa	Honestly, it really doesn't sound like you are ready for another pet right now whether it's a cat or a dog.  It sounds like you are still working through your grief over your cat and it does seem likely to me that a big part of you will resent any pet you bring home right now.  You can never replace a lost pet.  They take a little piece of your heart with them when they go and it will take time for your heart to heal enough to open up to another pet.  How long depends on the individual person and, to some extent, the relationship with their pet.  Some people are ready right away and getting another pet helps them cope with their loss or honor their friend's memory.  Some people aren't ready to open their heart to another pet for weeks, months, even years.  There's nothing wrong with either, it's just a difference between individuals.    If you are having thoughts of suicide, then seeking professional help for your depression is important.  There is nothing wrong with feeling that way over the loss of a pet just because that pet was not a human...they were still very much an important part of your life.  But regardless of whether suicidal thoughts are brought on by the death of a human or animal pet professional help could make a world of difference in your ability to cope with them.    I would also recommend visiting www.petloss.com.  It is a pet loss support website that has many resources to help people work through their grief over loosing a beloved pet...whether that pet is a cat, dog, or even a hamster.  There are links to online and local support groups with people who really do understand what you are going through.  And there are some really nice ideas for ways to honor and remember your pet.|`|ardSb3jlaa	i would try to rescue a dog. just ask about its personality (as you dont want to get a dog that is untrainable and unloving) i absoulutely wish your beloved cat rests in peace. i bet you that the thing she wants right now is that her owner is happy (even with a dog)     May your cat be remembered and the memories of her cherished|`|htWtHCIfaa	I'm sorry about your cat, to start with.

If you where happy with a cat, a dog wouldnt be right for you. You should get another cat when you're ready. and your old cat wouldnt mind, because he's no longer with you, not to sound mean. Go back to the shelter or the store and buy a new cat when you don't break down or anything. Wait until you're ready|`|kBjzKyZyaa	Getting a new dog, wont replace your cat, but it will provide you some companionship that i think you are missing from the loss of your cat. I would check different breeds online and figure which breed is the best for you. Like i have 2 mix breed dogs Dachshund/Chihuahua mixed aka Chiweenie. They are the most loving dogs, all the want to do is cuddle up to you and be with you all the time. I've always been a cat person prior to getting my chiweenies, but they have the best personalities, and the way they just want to be petted and loved reminds me of the cats i've had. Do some research with a site like petfinder.com and see which breed is the best for you, and you might just find a rescue dog that clicks with you.|`|746YLjISaa	When My cat got eaten by a cyotey I missed school for two weeks because everything reminded me of her. On my first day back My mom had gotten me a memorial grave and we put it in the backyard and planted flowers around it. It's okay to be sad. It's been a year since my cat died and I recently got a Chocolate Labrador named Sadie she has helped me through hard times. I love hher to death. Yesterday she stood up on her hind legs and put her paws on my back it was hillarious. I think you should wait at least a year before getting another pet. Im sorry for your loss.|`|LochBxhlaa	not i think its jus fine that you get a dog. i mean you had those good times with ur cat but i mean you do have to move on sumtime. and if you get a dog it might make it easier for u to move on. but don't forget about ur cat but its not unfair to the dog it jus wants sum love too. and im sure it will give you love back. :D|`|a8bcff9f1e69ff91dcbe876ebedd9240aa	My deepest sympathies for your loss.     To be very honest, NO. You are not in the right frame of mind to care for a dog. You would smother it trying to console yourself for your loss - they  - that's not fair to the dog.  You need to grieve for your cat. It will take time.     When you are more stable, go back to the shelter and foster a dog for a while, so you can see if you're even a 'dog person'.|`|d0BRip3gaa	I think your story is really sad! :( . I had a cat too but i had to put it down,as much as i really didn't want to i had to do what was best for him i saw him act differently and suffer, but when he died i never wanted to have another cat.(just like you). Nothing can replace it. But i remember on Christmas my whole family came to my house and opened the gifts and i saw a huge gift that they just brought in, they said, this ones for you i opened it and it was a cage with a german shepard in it. Although i did not want another animal i got a girls best friend and i would NEVER replace it.SO i think you should get the dog.  : )     P.S Good Luck on the decision.

NUIrBHXgaa	According to this site corn snakes reach sexual maturity between 18 months to 3 years of age. theres more about there reproduction on there too. apparently there seasonal breeders even in captivity.    and heres another site just to compare to.  ah i see sexual maturity is determined by size not age. The first site says 3-5'  at sexual maturity.  The second one seems to say 2.5- 4'  so its probably around 3' . Ya i took a look at a 3rd site and it says sexual maturity is around when they reach half there eventual size. They grow to around 6-8' so 3-4' is around when they become sexually mature.|`|2CbfO4jWaa	sexual maturity in corn snakes is decided by size not age. 28" is sexually mature ( there can be issues when breeding a female this small)|`|ZhPlmL0Vaa	the minimum weight of the female is 200 grams...the male at 150 grams...any smaller than this will cause egg binding or other complications.
oQBzf5tYaa	Its winter time again and your pets feet are suffering. Ice, rock salt and snow can lead to dry cracked paw pads. Paw pads are a difficult thing to heal because your pet is constantly walking on them, each time your pet walks on them the area splits open again, so how to do you help his paw pads heal?    With just a little bit of first aid and TLC, you pet can be up and running again in no time. The most important thing to help heal the paw pad is to keep it clean and dry. You will want to clean the wound with an antiseptic wash a few times a day. Then apply some neosporin and then cover the wound with gauze. You can wrap it with vet tape or an ace bandage to keep the gauze in place, you might also want to cover it with a dog bootie. If the wound doesnt start to heal in a couple of days, visit your veterinarian.    To prevent your pets paws from cracking and bleeding, you want to keep them moist and protected. You can apply some Shaws Paw Wax each time your pet goes out to keep the salt off your pets pads. You can also use dog booties, such as Pawz, if your pet will tolerate them.    Each time your pet comes in from outside, be sure to wipe his paws off, especially any snow that is caked between his toes. This will help remove any salt that may have gotten on him while he was out.|`|HDiSjSHiaa	You can buy her booties. I put 'muttluks' on all three of my girls.     Vaseline is also a good idea, they do have special doggy paw rub out there. I hear it's very good.     You can ensure that you clean your dogs paws after every walk to get rid of the sand and salt.    It shouldn't really bother her, if she is licking her feet a lot then maybe.|`|eHHp4tulaa	You can also get a salve from wal-mart that heals the pads of the dogs feet. It's says that its (udderly smooth) I think that it has vaseline in it. There's not much you can do about the pads, just try and keep her feet washed from the salt as much as possible. If the skin opens up, there may be some pain from the cracking.|`|MBcP3Tfzaa	It probably doest hurt her. and there really isn't much u can do. maybe put little boonies on her. But, Vaseline does work, the aquaphor works, and neosporin also. i have a dalmation that has that and we put Neosporin on her and it helps the cracking go away! i hope this helps you! good luck|`|c2d91f8848c790497d198b753a8d3401aa	Yes, it can hurt her.  There are sprays that you can buy that will protect her feet and, of course, there are also boots that she can wear.  Check with a pet store in your area.|`|DHTowv7saa	Don't worry! The cracking is just showing that your puppy is growing up. A year from now, she won't be that soft cuddly puppy anymore. The cracking doesn't hurt her, and you might want to consider to trying to find lotion if you think its that bad. Not all dogs are perfect, but make sure you are cutting her nails, and that's all you need to worry from the feet.  Also, if you are afraid of the salt outside, consider buying or making little paw boots. I use them on my dog, and they seem to be completely comfy.|`|Tp5za8wvaa	Yes it can be painful to your pet.  From my experience it helps to wash the dogs feet after being outside and apply a little vitiman e oil to the pads 2x aday within a day or two they will start to fill in and once the weather warms up and the salt is gone so will be the problem  good luck|`|yN4QiPKlaa	1st of all, make sure you are wiping her paws off EVERY time she comes in.  Just a warm wash cloth, no soap.  Then put udder balm on her pads.  If you can, put the balm on, then put baggies on her feet.  Tie them with string, tight enough that she can't get them off, but not so tight that it cuts off circulation.  Leave them on for 10-15 min,  then take them off and let her run the house.  Don't leave her unattended during this time though.  She could chew at the bags and swallow plastic.  Once the cracking is gone, (will prob take a few days of doing this) then just make sure that you are cleaning her feet each time and put the balm on a couple of times a day.|`|JsBb732Maa	Look for a paw moisturizer and protection. They sell them in pet stores.If it gets bad enough it can't feel good, maybe boots for you dog to wear out side until he potties?|`|InCpu9Vfaa	put some socks on her|`|yenUJGsoaa	cant really do anyhting and it doesnt hurt them|`|0bX3uZ3Baa	it will hurt her...and at the pharmacy you can get what's called udder balm. they use it on cows to make sure their udders don't chap...and you can also use it on your hands, etc. it's very good moisturizer. get some and rub it on the pads on her feet.|`|1dVoVp1gaa	take her to the vet|`|weBvwrloaa	don't use Vaseline because it's a breeding ground for bacteria to grow, use Bag balm. You can find it at any feed store or  usually a tiny tin at any store with pharmacy. It's a green tin with a picture of cows udders and  dark green and red writing.  Fantastic stuff!   Bag balm is an antiseptic ointment used originally to help milking cows when their udders would chafe so badly that they would split and crack. It made them heal quickly and prevented infection.Today, it's used for an assortment of things from lip balm, to nursing human mothers and everything in between. Costs about $5.00 for a small tin.|`|f6851264bc5d56ceb1264b29ddb15bddaa	JUST KIss It  TOtallyy will feel better =]|`|ErQLvVQjaa	Just keep putting vaseline on them.

And its super cold and snowy.     I have some special medication that the vet gave us to put on the cuts on his paws. You might want to ask about that.     Then I usually put a bandage, made out of just some Gaze (that cottony stuff) or a regular old paper towel and some tape to make sure that the blood doesn't get all over the rugs and kitchen floor.     I just had to do it this yesterday, just made sure that the puppy doesn't keep biting or licking too hard on the cut or else it might become irratated and that wont be good.     Here is a article about Winter Paw care for dogs. =D     http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art2...    I hope I helped you!!!    ~Sherri|`|fe447af35c529588ddeb8f78da7b83faaa	Vaseline.    You're using the right stuff.  I use vaseline on my dogs.  You can even put it on her before you go out for walks.  It protects them, keeps them warm in the snow as it creates a barrier and it helps heal them.  If you put it on when your inside I find the dogs like to lick it off.|`|St6Jvc3Daa	lotion?|`|vJAhIAt0aa	thats perfectly normal 4 a dog its shedding she will have a fresh set of paw pads soon so dont worry|`|bDxFezYLaa	Well. no it doesnt hurt them, it's natural. and you should keep her inside, and if she isnt potty trained, buy some mats.|`|zdPqht41aa	nah it doesnt hurt they have no feeling in the pads they crack because of concrete too its normal for them to crack unless the dog starts limping then worry|`|H8pkaoodaa	I dont think it hurts hur unless they start bleeding. If at all possible keep vaseline or even cocoabutter (works wonders with me) and if its a small breed you could try buying her doggie boots if it gets too much.|`|s4k29qKPaa	my dogs pads crack too but all i do is not let her outside for to long so the cracking doesnt get worse. if you really are concerned, then ask ur vet.|`|p5IR7ezTaa	Just put baby cream on them that is hypoallergetic. that should help. you could also get some booties for your dog, or once she comes in from outside wipe her paws down with warm water to get rid of the salt. and it might hurt her because if there are crack are open the salt might get in it and sting. and if this doesnt work i would suggest going to see a vet to see if the can do anything

I like to think they're just happy to see me when we come in the door, but it could also be because they're hungry, or just want attention. Rubbing her nose against your face could also be for attention. I think I remember hearing that cats mark their territory by rubbing their nose/cheeks...take from that what you will, I guess.
rTSwouqXaa	I have only seen one horse test positive. It was put down on the spot. It was in with a group of horses and it was the only one to test positive. In over 28 years of being around horse, training/showing/owning. I have seen thousands of horses and can only remember once case of positive coggins. But it is always better safe than sorry.|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	I have not met a single horse who has EIA.  I hope never to, and to never own one!  I am not sure why its never heard of.  I guess it's pretty rare.|`|253749a8c740b2b9ceb438a7f88d0d44aa	My vet has had one in his entire career. The reason we don't hear about it is b/c it's so controlled. Just think, if they quit being so particular about it, more horses would catch it, and then we would start hearing cases of it.|`|XL62syrCaa	No I have never because usually that horse has to be kept away from any other horses (which we all know IS NOT good for horses) and usually are euthanized|`|Pm8nsCGZaa	The Coggins test does not test for the actual virus that causes EIA. It tests for antibodies to the virus. This virus is similar to HIV and, like any pathogen, causes the exposed body to generate antigens and antibodies. The virus that causes equine infectious anemia is a lentivirus, part of the same family of viruses that causes AIDS in people. One of the most important things to realize is that once infected with this virus, the horse remains infected for life. ~*~*~*~*  The horse will be quarantined for the rest of his life, there is no cure, but not all horses die from it. I do know of one in Florida. Still a good riding horse, they have a place there with just EIA horses and everyone comes and rides them.|`|5QG9Zrjaaa	Back in the early '80's we had an AQHA stud that was positive.  We had a choice at that time; a) destroy the horse, or b) send him to a quarantine farm in Arkansas and pay to have him boarded there.   Tony was a good stud, but the farm wouldn't take studs, and our insurance wouldn't pay off unless we destroyed him.  Sadly, that was what we had to do, from a financial point of view.  There are only a few places in the country that are licensed to be an EIA quarantine farm, you can't keep them at home and be your own quarantine place.    Afterward, our farm was quarantined for 6 months, no horses on or off.  It was not a pleasant time, but it was for the best overall.  No other horses ever came up positive in our care.|`|ej9IE5Csaa	EIA is Equine Infectious Anemia this is mostly around the golf coast or swamp like areas. You find it in warm and humid area's much like florida and New orleans.   There was an out break of EIA in Florida a couple years back, and alot of people had to be checked for and could not take their horse out of the state with out papers stating they had tested their horse for it.   I have been around a horse with HYPP that failed a coggins test.|`|Q8Sv4V48aa	No, I haven't ever heard of a horse being positive for it, but it is very closely guarded. You can actually get a fine for not having you horse tested every year. That's probably part of these reason you haven't heard much of it. Plus when a horse is positive, that horse and any exposed horses must be quarantined.|`|SFfE6dOfaa	yes it is usually found in humid areas. It is very contagious, and there was a huge breakout, but bc of that breakout everything is monitored much more closely so that it won't happen again, and bc of that there aren't a lot of horses with EIA at big barns or shows or anywhere where you might see one. If a horse comes up positive in a coggins test, they vet has to report the horse to all vets in the area, the local authorities, the local barns, the local arenas, the local horse owners, and pretty much everyone! The owner must then either euthanize horse or put it in strict quarantined the rest of its life. The horse must never come in contact with another horse again. All horses that the horse was in contact with before must be tested. Any others found positive will be quarantined. EIA cannot be cured.

Af3dH6jXaa	take her to the vet|`|mFNEbR3Maa	just to let you know shes probably is in labor or pregnant or she may have a throat problem because they cant breathe good so they pant and they cant eat cause it hurts to swallow and ps really take her to a vet i sware something can really be wrong|`|Wp23aaLQaa	I don't mean to be rude but you shouldn't have a dog if you can't provide adequate care for it and that includes regular vet visits or at the very least taking her to the vet when she is sick. This makes me sad. She could be really sick. You need to get some money together and take her to the vet. Maybe you could volunteer to help out in a vets office for  a little while just this one time. Most vets really love animals so they might do it because they don't want to see a dog suffer because of financial reasons.|`|p9A61dFgaa	www.pdsa.org.uk/eligibility.html See if your able to get their help they offer free vetinary services don't put off taking her to the vet, breathing problems are not signs of heat or stress. But something worse, I agree with the sell your pc!|`|hIJRrIWiaa	She may just have to fart. Try giving her some chocolate.|`|rmSdDT5Faa	i have a rottweiler, there are times he doesnt eat, and we never knew y. he didnt like the hard food so we gave him soft, and he ate it, but  when this happen we decided it was maybe a stomach bug. he was 2 at the time and not as old as yours so it could have been a totally different thing all together, but the breathing thing, im not sure about, if its late and the vet isnt open go to the animal hospital, ive done that at 2am with my other dog for other reasons to put my mind at ease, its just so hard that they cant tell you whats wrong so maybe the vet can be of more help.     moving may have something to do with it, they can get depressed also, if you dont want to take the dog at least call to ask y hthe dog is reacting in such a way and if it should be looked at, im sure they have seen this type of thing before and could give you a better answer than anyone could on here.    they do have at the animal hospital a payment plan ,at least we have it where i live, now, the vet doesnt, but it would cost anything to call and ask, but if it were the animal hospital they can do a payment plan, a relative did that with her dog when it swallowed a rock they didnt know abt,    but if it looks serious, money shouldnt be a option when its the life of your pet,|`|kBjzKyZyaa	It could come from a number of problems, if you call around to different vets offices, you can probably find one that will let you make payments. Has she been on a heart worm preventative?|`|c7992d905ee1715cf5c3ed1c09c6ee98aa	This might be the age that is causing a lot of problem. She might be suffering from arthritis and might be in pain. At this age she might be having circulatory insufficiency, heart prpblems gums and teeth diseases, thyroid problem, intestinal parasite and many complications. The old age itself is a syndrome. If you can't take her to a vet for a diagnosis then I pray she will be alright. But take her to a vet thats ridiculous GET THE MONEY!!|`|NnqhtP2raa	Awww...thats so sad|`|BF9KE9tZaa	Well, it sounds like your dog may have a twisted stomach.    I would prepare for the worst.

Sell your computer or something..|`|Tlk3rvT1aa	I'm no dog expert but if you moved to a different city or town maybe the air is different? Is it hot and smoggy?

And I hope someone gives you a better answer.|`|kCRBhCVfaa	Take her to the vet|`|g7karw44aa	A phone call to the Veterinarian is free. There are plenty of clinics open on the weekend and after hours. They are medical professionals who can give you safe suggestions. Strangers who might have little or no knowledge of animals cannot diagnose your dog over the computer.  She could have a variety of things wrong with her, all require medical attention.    You can try Care Credit.  It is free to apply, you can do it over the phone or internet.  It is similar to a credit card, but it is based off your credit history.  Basically you apply and if you are accepted, it will tell you an amount.  It is definitely worth applying for.  www.carecredit.com  You pay the company directly on a selected payment plan.    Also, most vet clinics will take credit cards over the phone if you have a relative who will loan you money.    At least call your Vet, a phone call is free and it could save your dog's life.|`|Xign5u9faa	I also have a senior dog who was sick and won't eat.

Restlessness and panting is a classic sign of PAIN in a geriatric dog..    your option is to take her to the vet or watch her deteriorate in front of your eyes...your call. but keep in mind that you are breaking the law if you cannot provide her medical treatment.    If it is an emergency, then the vet will have to stablaize, reguardless of your financial situation..euthanasia will be a 3rd option if you cannot afford treatment on a dying dog.    Rapid weight loss is a classic sign of kidney failure or cancer. Rotweillers do not age well or live long (you mentioned she was a mix. cancer rate is also high in rotts)|`|g4B66YqPaa	she probably misses ur old house or is pregnant or in heat!!  :'(|`|gjDcdTcDaa	probably shes  in heat or shes pregnant!     hope this helps!|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	it sounds really bad. shes old for sure and this could be her near end. the breathing heavy could be poisoned or maybe shes just dying and has heart worms they can kill and mabye its been awhile caus eit takes time to do this generally speaking an animcal can adjust to moving especially a dog.|`|InCpu9Vfaa	i dont have money      what kind of BS is that?    the dog is your responsibility     if you love that dog then you're GONNA have the money whether you actually do or not|`|ydshiNrKaa	Well unfortunately if you can't afford to take her to the vet, then you will not know what is wrong with her and how you can help her.  Excessive panting is sometimes a sign of pain or distress and if she is doing this while resting/sleeping, she may be in a lot of pain.  I would suggest that you borrow some money from family and friends or get a credit card or sell something to get some money to take your dog to the vet and have her properly treated and cared for.  At 10 years of age, she is a senior dog and needs to be seen by a vet more frequently the the younger dogs as things can go wrong with an older dog much quicker.  You may want to call the humane society and see if they can direct you to low cost clinic where you can take the dog for treatment.  Not taking the dog to the vet is not an option - she needs to be treated for her pain and discomfort so get out there and find the money.
VeVHY7OOaa	Cash, because you'll be spending a lot of it on it's vet bills.  Or how about not even naming it.  It's harder to get attached to something you don't name, especially since it won't live near as long as a real dog!|`|AA10223196	Calli|`|QxxCN4pVaa	Millie  Livie|`|uBFhKXgHaa	Nonexistant  Scam  Backyard bred  Sickly runt    Darksong~|`|aab30902c32aa18d4eeead9019224c2aaa	Fang, Killer, Wolfie ...|`|sZFLtCbdaa	Missy    Argentina    Pockets    Pepsi    Buttons|`|ardSb3jlaa	shadow  sandy  nancy  blizzard  butternut|`|1bvl5zbkaa	Holly.      =]|`|9e1a0e459c90e3a8eb8741a8fb042e12aa	scoobie snack|`|8QiVEGNsaa	how about Teany or Maddy? haha.|`|n7GOiKC0aa	Hi,    Here are the unique names for small dogs.

AA11570905	Eiohippus.<br>  Genesis said that the earth was without form and God created the earth, then the creatures of the waters, then the land creatures and then the birds.  If you follow the scientists version of evolution then you will see that it happened in the same order. The current interpretation of the bible over simplifies the process but the process is the same.  God DID create all the creatures but they have since been changed and modified as the earth changed and modified.  It just didn't happen in 7 days (at least not 7 24 hour earth days)  What are 7 days to an infinite being anyhow?  Seven "days' to God could very well be billions of years!  That is what evolution is all about.  Those narrow minded Christian Fundamentalists can't think outside the box and have no imagination.|`|cSqx1DxKaa	Oh, Servant Servant Servant.  Ye of little reseach skills!  There is no "missing link" nor have any scientists ever claimed there was one.  "The Missing Link" is a cliched hypothetical term, and an antiquated one at that.  I think perhaps you are thinking of well-known hominid evolutionary hoaxes (which were, interestingly enough, generally found to be perpretrated by religious anti-Darwin zealots) such as "Piltdown Man".  If you do a little research you will discover that Piltdown Man was never taken seriously by anyone, as it was an obvious hoax.  <br>  <br>  You are certainly entitled to your own opinions and beliefs, but the ones you have stated as your "proof" are extremely flawed and inaccurate.  I'm not surprised you don't "believe in" evolution, if those are your reasons.  If you're interested in learning more about the correct principles behind the theory of evolution, I suggest you read "The Origin of the Species" by Charles Darwin.  <br>  <br>  Sorry to divert from you, question asker - the answer you're looking for is Eohippus.  Here's a great link:<br>  <a href="http://www.noanswersingenesis.org.au/horse_evolution.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.noanswersingenesis.org.au/hor...</a>|`|Ps8IqLXwaa	The answer to that is Eohipus|`|PWankIUpaa	Don't fall for the Evolution stuff . As a Christian I must tell you this is all false. The So called science of Evolution has been proved false by Astronomers , Biologists , Geneticists , and Archeology.<br>  <br>  The so called missing links have been proved to be pig's teeth. a combination of Monkey skulls and human from a tribe that ate monkey brains . In every case each of hte so called proofs were proved false.<br>  <br>  The Answer to your teacher's question you can google however know it is False and the Teachings of Genesis is Wright.|`|QpElKY8Kaa	Just to be unanimous, EOHIPPUS. <br>  <br>   I, too, am a devout Christian.  I study the Word, for myself. <br>  <br>   I do not agree with the oversimplification of most fundmentalists. <br>  My God that says '...I AM that I AM.  Before time was, I AM..."  That tells me that HE can do anything.  <br>  Oh, there's that other Scripture, the one thats says"...a thousand years is as a day to Me...", that makes our concept of time very small.<br>  <br>  The horse was born on this continent and grew to the horse we know today before it was, in all it's forms, extincted.<br>  <br>  We owe a debt to the Spanish for bringing them back home.|`|PmwX2VXOaa	quickdraw mcgraw|`|Cujjbbyoaa	Eohippus was the "first horse."

fe447af35c529588ddeb8f78da7b83faaa	I think she should be fine.     We have a small dog that use to have seperation anxiety.  When she had to stay overnight at the vets they said she was really good. When dogs are in that environment they seem to understand.  I'm sure she'll be fine.|`|4jOaN0WIaa	I think they would just bark or have accidents or shiver from being scared. They should have let her have a blanket. It is too bad that the vet will be closed other than someone looking in on her and that no other pets will be there. I know it's hard but it's only until Monday. She will be back with you before you know it. She will be fine. I doubt she would have a heart attack from the stress. She is very young. She will be so happy to see all of you on Monday and vice versa.|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	It could happen,but it's really rare,especially with the dog being so young. Does the vet know that she  has separation anxiety? They could give her something to relax her. But if she is on an IV,she probably is feeling too ill to worry,and the vet would probably call you if the dog was overly stressed. What is wrong with the dog?|`|FdcWPp48aa	If she is on an IV, she is probably too sick to worry about being separated.  Sorry your dog is sick, hope she is better and home soon.|`|9HOTbRxiaa	I don't think anything medical will happen.  She'll just be really excited to see you on Monday!|`|HqWPJXlRaa	She should be ok. I've heard of many stories about how dogs died from depression when sick but if you visit her everyday it'll be fine. Even though you may think that dogs can't live without their owners, they are actually OK. Don't forget, they have a life of their own too!   My dog is 10 and we go for a holiday every year for a month and leave him in our farm and he's fine.
4c1e07d9ba0c2d099d9db46ee34af35faa	Try the Cleveland Bay society - this is a rare breed and even though he is cannot be bred from, there is a reasonable chance that the breed society may know somebody who would like him - they often have waiting lists.<br>  <br>  Otherwise I can't understand why anyone would sell a horse at the sales, you get much less for them and you are right, if the prices are low enough they could go to the meat men. <br>  <br>  If you think you could afford him at horse sale prices, you could try going to the sale and bidding for him there. Otherwise do you have a good friend who you would be willing to share with and pay half each for him. If this was a possibility then make sure you get a proper contract so everyone knows where they stand.|`|an1L8njXaa	contact the cleveland bay horse society, they normaly will do everything in thier power to stop this horse going to meat. normaly by finding someone to buy it very quickly.<br>  <br>  As you are in the UK they would be your best bet<br>  <a href="http://www.clevelandbay.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.clevelandbay.com/</a><br>  <br>  If they cant help you then your next best thing is to make sure you can afford to keep him and then attend the auction yourself.<br>  the meat man will rarely pay over ￡500 for a horse and never over ￡1000. So you could buy him at the auction.|`|iiNAJfGCaa	If this horse is a registered Cleveland Bay then you have a very good chance of saving him as that breed is relatively rare (at least here in the United States). Get the word out, tell your friends, tell your barn... put up fliers if you have to. Find out what is the cheapest price the owner would sell him for.|`|PWankIUpaa	I would approach your mom and dad and ask them if you can buy the horse on time. Perhaps a small enough sum each month so that you could afford it and if you get their permission and then go to the owner ans ask him with your parents. I do not know of any person who loves horses who would rather do this than sell a horse to be put down unless there is something very wrong.<br>  <br>  A Friend of mine had a beautiful horse and he let his young daughters rid him. This was a Stallion . The horse killed the daughters and the man in grief killed the horse. While I do not agree with the action the man took I certainly can understand the situation . <br>  <br>  If you are a young girl or woman and the horse is a stallion find out the facts before you jump.|`|3a1e378691e31e4af23432441a473407aa	I think you are being over dramatic.  The way you are talking you sound young, and a big horse such as this might not be for you.  Not all horses are sold for meat in sales, and unlikely that a CB would be as they are good breed and I believe a dying breed.|`|j2yLjm6Naa	Work really hard to earn the money Sell horse treats, clean stalls, have a truck and trailer wash, groom horses, baby sit, Pet sit, dog walk, bake sale, or even have a yard sale. Put it in your mind that you will buy this horse and you will.|`|Cujjbbyoaa	If the owner is selling him at auction for meat prices, than they will not get more than $1500 if it is a really big horse. How much are they asking? If they are selling at auction then they are probably desperate for some quick cash. If you cannot afford to pay that price, then you probably won't be able to afford to keep the horse. Keeping a horse costs about $200/month very bare minimum in rural areas. If you really want this horse, make plans now to lease him or at least half-lease him to someone else as a way to cut down on the expenses. Is he rideable? If not, you probably will not be able to find anyone to share the expenses with. His owner is probably going through economic hard times. Many people are, and there are equine "rescues" cropping up all over because of it. Try to find some rescues near you. They might be able to give suggestions. You might offer to pay 2/3 of the price to the owner up front and then pay the rest in monthly installments, sign a contract. When the horse is officially yours and if you cannot afford to take care of it, set up with an equine rescue. These organizations will sometimes take care of a horse and/or adopt it to a good home. They will not sell it for meat. The sources below have some creative suggestions for keeping a horse inexpensively during economic hard times and for setting up horse leases. I wish you lots of luck! I got my own horse out of a very similar situation.|`|i9JFKN6Paa	If you can't afford to buy him and the owner won't loan, there really isn't much you can do. <br>  <br>  You could try to offer weekly payments to the owner to buy him, but to be honest, if you can't afford to buy him, you can't really afford to keep him either. It's very, very expensive to keep a horse. There's stable hire, feed, vet bills, tack.<br>  <br>  It would be sad if he does get sold for meat, but at 7 years old i'd be very surprised if he was. He has many years of riding left in him, I'm sure he'll find a nice home.|`|dd15228a42b4652d8768334912349b61aa	I hate to hear this ~ obviously the owner has problems, it sounds as though they don't have any other horses [so offering to look after the stable etc. wouldn't work]<br>  <br>  I'd be happy to come round with my shotgun and have a quiet word with them, but that wouldn't do any good either,<br>  <br>  Try getting in touch with the Horse Protection League in your area, see what they have to say [after all a 7 yr old has a long time to go], you may be able to get them to help, and you repay that by helping them, they can always do with all the help they can get.<br>  <br>  Sorry I can't suggest anything else ~ but the very best of luck with this, after all animals can't speak for themselves.|`|SHKhqBPtaa	How much is the guy asking?  Around where I live in Arkansas, I just got a 6 year old registered QH for only $450.00.  Horses are going real cheap.  Also, in the United States, as far as I know, there is a no kill on horses now.  Even with the economy so bad.  I hope you the best of luck.. See what you can work out for the guy helping him with things so you can get the horse.  We have 5 horses and 5 ponies on 20 acres.  Even with that much land, it still costs me an arm and a leg to take care of them.  I am only half owner of them all and I still have to spend well over 300 a month on them.|`|LJg590NLaa	If he goes for meat there must be a health problem as he will not fetch as much as he would as a riding horse.

Or my very favorite, a Mynah bird if you can find one.  Both birds need large cages, and they can be outside in the heat if the cage is in the shade.|`|wF52XMxAaa	I'm a bit confused about whether you want pet birds or aviary birds.  In the U.S., parrots are most often kept as pet (or companion) birds.  As such, they would prefer to be inside with you rather than outside (though they might enjoy an hour or two outside each day).  They are highly social, and need to interact either with you or other birds.  A single parrot in an outdoor aviary will be miserable and self-destructive.  So you'll want birds small enough that you can keep at least two in the cage.    The link for the cage is broken, but a 6' tall cage (height is the least important dimension) might handle two medium sized birds or one large one.  But as previously noted, one large one is a bad idea.    Some of the Australian parrots make good aviary birds, such as the Neophema (including Bourke's) or Psephotus parakeets.   see   http://www.avianweb.com/grassparakeets.h...  http://www.oldsca.monitorgroup.co.uk/gui...    They should be able to handle temperatures from about 55-95F with appropriate shelter.|`|b5b08a7f14d2315049ad9f67246d2a56aa	any parrot can be acclimated to live outside as long as certain conditions are met and they are protected from extreme weather|`|5b9d75acf8c31110fcdbe2289558b613aa	Any type of bird you want.

7gyvOQMWaa	You filter is dirty. Buy a new one they are avilale at pet-co and places like that.|`|eyKx05LKaa	You might possibly have a bacteria bloom, which will cloud the water.  This can be caused by overfeeding, and overstocked tank or not doing enough water changes.  The bacteria feed on the waste in the tank, which if there's too much it can cause a bloom. <br>  <br>  I had this problem before.  The best way to correct it, is to do regular water changes.  Normally I change 20% of my water once a week.  When I had the bacterial bloom, I did a 20% water change twice a week until the water cleared up, and I stopped overfeeding (which is what I was doing). It took almost 2 weeks before my water was crystal clear.  Also make sure you are vacuuming your gravel when you do your water changes. <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|GHpcc5iKaa	It could be algae my tank started like this when i got an algae bloom. A way to prevent this is to scrub the sides and stir the rocks around then fish out the rotting waste that floats up. It would also help you to do a water change and give the tank less sunlight. Best of luck! :)|`|dJs2s9pfaa	If it's a new tank it could be from not rinsing your substrate thouroughly which the filter will take care of. Otherwise, you may need to perform more water changes. Filters should be replaced every 2-4 weeks. 25% weekly changes should be done no matter what as you could quickly get disease or dirty water.<br>  <br>  I would recommend getting some all in one test strips just to see where you stand with your water quality.|`|499ce2344d684feb00ec06bcf55edd71aa	That all depends upon what you have. If it is a new tank set-up, then it is normal and will go away. If it has been stocked for a while, it could be anything from not changing the water and filters properly, or overfeeding, or overcrowding..........<br>  <br>  Re-post with tank size and water parameters. You will be able to get a better answer.|`|SnanuNKiaa	stop putting so much fish food in there. you only need a tiny pinch to adiquately feed your fish.|`|0udjgaoBaa	Hes been smoking the stickiest of ickey! duh.|`|97cea69af418b36fa64d887915f51776aa	Well if it's a brand new tank it's normal for it to be cloudy becasue it's going through "the new tank cycle" meaning good bacterias are being establish, don't do anything; once the bacteria are established the tank will clear up by itself. <br>  <br>  Now if it's not a new tank meaning you didn't just set it up, then it's because you are overfeeding your fish, and the food goes and spoils in the tank and messes with the water, the good bacterias will not be able to help your tank if you are overfeeding your fish, or you have stuffed a bunch of fish in there and they are making too much waste which filter cannot handle.<br>  <br>  Cloudy water could be a result of lack of care and negligence, meaning you don't do your 25% water change weekly like you were supposed to and you don't take care of the gravel. Or you have never replaced the filter pads for months and the carbon became useless.<br>  <br>  Now i think you might now know what could be the reason, if it's a new tank that you just setup, don't do anything just buy a water testing kit and watch the ammonia and nitrate level and such. If it's not a new tank, then i would recommend you to change at least 25% of the water and replace your old filter pad with a new one, if the problem still presist then it means you have too many fish, and you either have to buy a bigger tank, or donate some of the fish where you got them from.<br>  <br>  Take care, good luck.|`|BMri9tITaa	How long have you had your tank?  Do you have any fish in there?  How many?  How quickly did you add them?  What kind of filter do you want?  Is it near a window?  Did you cycle your tank before you added fish?

Turtles don't protect their young.|`|2YIxnXXyaa	I can assure you she's not attacking you to protect the baby.  Turtles are independent animals from birth.  Mothers lay the eggs and that's the only motherly role that takes place in her life.  Lays her eggs and leaves.  She probably just thinks your fingers are worms and are trying to get a snack.|`|FvAl3UgQaa	Adding a little bit to Elizabeth's answer - not only will the mother not be protective of the baby turtle, I would recommend that you urgently remove it to a tank of its own as there's an extremely high likelihood that she will harm/kill the much smaller baby.
Ro2ObPXlaa	Ok, well be VERY careful.  They can and will attack if backed into a corner.  My brother chased one off today and it took two good whacks from a heavy stick before he ran.  They come in my barn to eat my cats food.  If I can't chase them out you have to shoot them.  If you have a powerful pellet gun and it isn't an aggressive possum, you can put it right at the back of his skull and kill him humanely.  Do NOT do this unless you know what you are doing.  If you are afraid to kill an animal, open the garage and then whack the thing a couple times and it will run.   Good luck.      Edit: Not to discount the posting above, but they CAN be aggressive.  These are rural possums I deal with and most are mean.  They hiss and show their teeth and will not just be pushed around.  Be careful!!!|`|54fdf2affdc8dc366315eec2cecd5920aa	Opossums don't like noise.  Go out there and make some noise to scare it away. .  .  Now if you make a sudden loud noise, it just MIGHT make the opossum go into a faint; in which case you could perfectly well pick it up and put it wherever you want to.  I've done that; the ears may twitch, but it will be pretty limp.  Otherwise, it will be more scared of you than you are of it.  It would bite you only if it was trapped and you tried to catch it; no way would you do that.  Opossums don't eat cats, though it might bite in self defense if a cat attacked it.    I don't think the opossum is going to hurt anything; but on the other hand, you may not want it living in the garage.  They are nice to have around, they eat snails and bugs.  Recently I encountered one, and it kind of froze, so I snuck up on it (in full view) and gradually got closer; the opossum started drooling with its mouth hanging open, trying to look rabid or something, but I wasn't fooled.  I first touched it on the back, then gradually petted it and scratched around its ears, all the while it played like it was very sick.  When my attention strayed a moment, it tried to snap at me, but I growled and it went back to being half conscious.  Well, I left it and went inside.  I have to wonder what goes on in that 'possum brain when I'm putting it into a trance.    Take a radio out to the garage and turn it on.  Also leave the light on; opossums don't like light.  Loud music and bright lights, that should scare it off.|`|SX3k1ncyaa	Call animal control in the morning.  They will send someone out to catch it and release it in the wild.    AS FOR your cats, i'd be more worried what the cats would do to the possum, because that possum most likely isn't going after your cats anytime soon. The cats will probably try to attack the possum before the possum even thinks about even walking TOWARD your kittys.|`|lgrzd9RWaa	if i were u i would call animal control,  and are possoms really that big|`|nOmX8XGUaa	firstly lure your cats away with a treat or something, possoms can be dangerous. then open the garage door and wait, it will leave eventually|`|NeymQe9raa	What ever you do, just don't feed the thing or else it will never leave. If you want to "encounter" it, start by taking a shovel with you. Opossums are actually very calm if you move slowly and don't have FOOD. Just run if it starts foaming at the mouth or starts running at you okay? (joking, you can get a trap...I used to trap the suckers and feed them peanut butter)|`|8bTder08aa	We have "pizzums" living under our house.  They come to the side door to eat the food we put out for a couple of stray cats that live in the yard.  We have big pizzums, little pizzums, and a whacking great big male pizzum that's impossibly ugly even for a pizzum.    First thing you need to know about pizzums is they have the approximate IQ of a houseplant.  They are really, really DUMB.  They are also as completely inoffensive as a wild critter can be.  Yeah, they look like rats, believe me, I'd rather be up close and personal with a pizzum than a rat.  Rats are MEAN.    Pizzums can easily be pushed around (literally) with a broom.  Just get yourself a broom and you can use the bristle end to sweep/push the pizzum out of your way if it doesn't run on its own.  Summer nights here, we get the pizzums running across the top of the brick wall around our yard, which makes my dog go absolutely whacko.  Dog starts barking like a maniac, and if I let it go too long, neighbors start complaining, so I have to go out with the broom to push the pizzum off the fence onto the other side (they invariably freeze when they see me coming.  They think they're invisible if they don't move.  I can walk right up to them, give 'em a gentle shove with the broom, and they fall off the fence onto the other side and scurry away.  Problem solved.)    I have pulled a baby pizzum by the tail to get it off a fig tree in the yard; as soon as it got off the fig tree, it scurried away under the house.    Don't be afraid of pizzums.  If you can swing a broom, you are in no danger.  **************************************...  Edit:  our outside cats and the pizzums coexist with no problems.  I've seen pizzums and cats eating from the same bowl of food outside at the same time.|`|bEQn0Vrtaa	I have read ever thing that was written to this point and honey let me tell you i was raised on a farm lived most of my life either in the country or country like settings and these critters are just every were, They WILL NOT HURT YOU, you almost have to step on them to even get their attention. Sure they will show you their teeth they have to do something to look mean they just are not OK They are coming in for the food that is in the garage.|`|KToEYmwWaa	If your cats will come when you call them, try to get them inside.  Maybe call a neighbor.|`|NaPibFiYaa	That possum is probably more scared about your cats than your cats are scared of it. But, just to be safe, try to call them in or shake a can of food and keep them in. As for the possum, open the garage door and see if it comes out. If it doesn't, wait for your dad to come back and ask him to call animal control or something.   Good luck!
7rx3sdehaa	Try using a dish more like a plate.<br>  <br>  My boyfriend has a Spitz who is totally fearful of bowls, because she likes to actually see her food laying out in front of her. Sometimes dogs just do not care for certain things, but there would be no harm in adjusting her dish to make her more comfortable.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|EeJMITyCaa	Treating him like a baby is doing nothing but making the situation worse. See dogs see attention as a reward so you rewarding him is telling him that he is right to be scared of the food bowl. What you need to do is sit by the food bowl and when he tries to take the food out to eat somewhere else then put the food back in the bowl. If not then it'll become a habit of his and he will never stop even when he stops being scared of the food bowl. Or you could try getting him a food bowl that looks totally different. The fear is getting worse because he is still being rewarded for being scared. If you are feeding him on a schedule and only leaving the food down for around 15 minutes and taking it up when he doesn't eat then he will get over it pretty soon. But your method of praising him for being scared isn't helping him. I had the same problem when my one of my pups were brought home. He was scared of the bowl because he'd never eaten out of a bowl before but eventually when he realized that he wont let me take the food out of the bowl and eat it somewhere else and that the food only stays in their for about 15 minutes, he got used to it. Now he sleeps by his food bowl.|`|8e373a7bc6b3c784f2bae9cc02a6cf20aa	Sit on the floor next to the bowl and hold Benji.  (Hold the bowl too, if you can.) Let him eat from it while you are holding him.  Once he sees that it is safe he will get more comfortable with the bowl again.<br>  Good luck and be patient.|`|KuUx34hCaa	take the bowl out of the stand & set it on the floor see what happen what kind of a dog is he how tall is he|`|GDTPhQHeaa	You need to read the book by Cesar Milan. He is a great dog behaviorist.  He says that if you make a big deal out of something scary then it'll make it worse than if you just shrug it off. People tend to run over to their dogs and hug them and cuddle them after something scary because that's what we do to our children but dogs look at this as making it more of a tramatic event. Now that he's already scared, I would just put some really good food in there and leave it alone. If you go over to it and hold it and hold him near it, it's adding fire to the flame and making the bowl more of a BIG event instead of just simply a dog bowl. You would be playing it up. Maybe move the dish and put something really good in it. That'll entice him to go over to it but just don't make a big deal of scary events! I never have with my dog and she isn't scared of anything. In the doggy kingdom, they don't cuddle after something scary.....they move on.  You need to be able to speak their language for your dog to be truly happy!|`|MYEEK4dcaa	Stop trying to convince him!  <grin>  Puppies are like small kids in this respect - the more you try to get him to do something, the more he doesn't want to do it - especially when it comes to eating.  By now, he knows that you're worried about his food consumption, and by refusing to eat it, he gets your attention.<br>  <br>  Start by just putting the food into the bowl and putting the bowl itself on the floor beside the stand.  Call him to dinner, and then ignore him.  Leave his water in the bowl on the stand if it's a two-bowl stand.<br>  <br>  After he's been successful at that for a few days, put the bowl back on the stand.  Then ignore him.  He will eat, eventually.  When nothing keeps on happening, he'll get over being afraid of the stand.|`|iU1VaRcTaa	First I would take the bowl out of the stand.  With a small breed such as yours it's fine to let the bowl sit on the floor anyway.  Please consider getting a plastic or better yet porcelain bowl.  They don't carry electrical currents which can help keep your dog calm during thunderstorms.<br>  <br>  With a different bowl you can then put different BETTER treats in the bowl like chicken or turkey or hot dogs.  This isn't for feeding, this is for treats.  You want to make the bowl as attractive as possible.  Start with the treats on the ground around the bowl and then put them in the bowl.  You want to stay calm while you do this, no high pitched praising or noises, just the treats over and over and over.  If you'd like to work back up to the stand, do it only after he's ok with the bowl again.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
YQfEOeStaa	I agree with the responses about keeping your puppy in the crate. It was a lifesaver for us doing that to our puppy, who was born last March. On occasion we let him sleep in our bed with us (mostly on weekends, not during the week when we have a schedule to prepare for work).    A couple key things to note:    * Dogs and puppies LOVE schedules. They love knowing what to expect and they feel safe and secure having a place of their own.  * A hot water bottle and ticking clock does wonders in soothing puppies who miss their moms and litter mates.   * Don't reinforce their whining. If your puppy whines and you react, you are letting your puppy be the alpha. YOU are the alpha. Don't forget. Dogs get anxious if they don't have a leader. Step up!  * Dogs don't want to pee where they eat or sleep. IT isn't in their nature. Crating is the EASIEST way to potty train your puppy.    Good luck and enjoy!    p.s. one last thing. If any dog is misbehaving in any way, acting up, etc. The FIRST thing to do is make sure he/she has enough exercise. Too many dogs (especially puppies with their boundless amounts of energy) do not get the necessary exercise and their owners get frustrated with their "behavioral problems" and they end up in rescue or in a shelter or abandoned or abused. Please don't let this happen! Exercise, Discipline, Affection. As the Dog Whisperer says!|`|JsBb732Maa	She won't feel like she's being punished for sleeping in the crate. Let her out to potty before you crate her and have her where you can hear her if she needs to go out during the night. If she likes the crate she won't mind sleeping in it.|`|Ei85kgfdaa	Crating helps with housebreaking, yes. Its fine to crate her at night but keep in mind that she is just a pup. At her age its likely she cannot hold her bladder more then 4-5 hours so she will need to go out very early in the morning.|`|fe447af35c529588ddeb8f78da7b83faaa	I would keep her in the crate.   If you keep them in the bed you may have behaviour problems later on that you have to deal with as they feel they are equal or above you and may think they are alpha dog.|`|746YLjISaa	Your boxer will eventully take over your bed if you let him sleep with you. I have a baby boxer aswell his name is Monty and I take a puppy gate and put it up in my bath room with his bed a soft non-sqeaky toy and a chew stick he sleeps through the night in his bed. But when I firs got him he whined and barked so I put a ticking alarm clock an hot water bottles wrapped in towls plus a large dog stuffed animal he slept like an angel sent from heaven!
bf5084d1ec35330c95ff7b7bd883bbffaa	Hamsters and other rodents have been known to do this under stressful conditions.  It's complicated to describe, but you could describe it as storing the male's sperm to fertilize an egg when it later drops into the uterus.    Hamze (below) is also correct and what I was alluding to is his description  2 technically called, "Parthenogenesis".  It's very rare, but does happen.|`|o0VyLaPiaa	Some animals can "store" sperm and then become pregnant later when their environment is more stable/better/etc.|`|AA11707728	Your neighbors hamster escaped and climbed in the window for a little booty call.    Seriously though.  Isn't it obvious.  Your poor hamster kicked the bucket and rather than tell you, your parents got another one that looked just like it.  Unfortunately, it was already pregnant when they bought it.    Now they're busted.|`|JZMfUDylaa	oh that happend to my hamster! the reason why is cuz whatever pet store you got it from didnt seperate the male and female hamsters they were all in one cage silly huh?|`|OocDN5evaa	I had a hamster that escaped from her cage. I found her after a few days and put her in a better cage....and then she had babies. So either hamsters and mice can mate or there's another hamster somewhere in my house, living like a mouse.    Maybe you have the same issue. Or else your hamster is a pimp in disguise.|`|6ibAiO9Paa	i have read that this can happen in 2 ways    1. The hamster stored sperm(ver unlikley since its been a year)    2. A rodent can have babyes without sperm its very intresting the babys are actully part of the mother and she just does this thing(i forgot how) and she has babys on her own but the babys are actully like clones of her because ther wasnt a male in the cage so the hamster took parts of its self to make babys|`|oQQ3lnCGaa	She probably got bred at the pet store. I would keep her and raise the litter well but go to the pet store you got her from and tell them plus give them heck.  Just keep on complaining ;)|`|uXUPCh9saa	I think maybe a wild hamster broke into the cage one night and...you know...Or maybe it was the other way around.

I've kept fish before and often thought it would have been easier tending to a herd of elephants.|`|JvTF7UrMaa	hey iv just got a new fish tank, and the best fish to put in to biuld up a cycle are either tiger barbs or platty's. They are great beginner fish and do a brilliant job at building up a cycle for more delicate fish, e.g neons, and angel fish ... But, any way if i where you id go with either tiger barbs, or plattys they add some colour to a tank are great comnutiy fish (well the plattys are but tiger barbs can be violent) hope it goes well, zack xxx
D7wQjUYqaa	I made the mistake of searching for a particular breed of horse, rather than the horse itself, and ended up with a horse that I did not want.  Forget the breed!

SnAsZapMaa	Ignore the people who recommend interfering with his ears.    If he has correct genetics - and your statement that they they HAVE been up in the past shows that he does - and is given a nightly gnaw bone to exercise his cheek muscles (incidentally cleaning his teeth, dislodging deciduous teeth, and helping permanent teeth break through the gums; and what's swallowed has the perfect balance between calcium & phosphorous) his ears WILL erect once his health clears up. As others have said, he will be teething at present; painful teething puts enough strain on his system as to constitute "poor health" until the current tooth finishes emerging. And for this couple of months you can pretty-well guarantee that there will be at least one tooth trying to break through.  To find out when each tooth can be expected, click http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/The_G...  Another part of that site will tell you about neutering and the possible side-effects - some good,  some very bad - and the likelihood of each happening, based on the age at which neutering was done.    If he doesn't have correct genetics then he should definitely not be bred from - dogs asked about here are automatically not up to breeding quality - if they were, their owners would be asking their pooch's breeder and their own mentor. The longest I've had to wait for both ears to be permanently up at the same time was 9 months.    ? If your dog was bought with a Guarantee that it was of show quality and/or of breeding quality, but it reaches 11 months with a drooping ear or ears, you have a come-back on its breeder. The breeder should certainly be told so that he/she can't claim that the lines have never produced floppy ears. Whether that breeder takes any notice depends on which is more important to him/her - using everything he/she owns to pump out cute pups for money, or producing a few carefully-bred quality pups for improving the breed and the kennel's reputation.  ? If you  bought without a Guarantee, that was your choice - so accept the consequences, and realise that the dog doesn't care about having an ear hanging down, but it DOES care about having its ear taped or glued, and is very likely to kick a haematoma into its ear while attempting to get rid of the "parasite" you glued/taped to him. A haematoma adds enough weight to ensure that the ear will never be able to erect.    Next, learnt that there is no such thing as a "German Sheppard" - my breed was developed to HERD sheep in the German boundary patrolling way, so is named die deutsche Sch?ferhund, which translates exactly as the German Shepherd Dog, GSD for short.    To ask future questions about GSDs, join some of the 300+ YahooGroups dedicated to various aspects of living with GSDs. Each group's Home page tells you what they want to discuss, and how active they are.  Les P  owner of GSD_Friendly:  http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/GSD_F...  "In GSDs" as of 1967|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Ask your breeder but I wouldn't worry now. They tend to change position while teething.  You can tape them or glue them if needed or if possible.  Some shepherd ears won't stand cuz of being too large & heavy & poor breeding. This is the link to a no-tape method if you want to have it in advance to be ready.    http://moonstruckbxr.tripod.com/Informat...    It applies whether the ears were cropped or not.|`|Ei85kgfdaa	Your breeder should be the one to call and ask this question.    ITs not uncommon for the ears not to stand until later but if they arn't going up by about 7 months I would consider starting to post them.|`|ydshiNrKaa	His ears will go up and down until he is done teething.  Usually around 6 months or so.  If they have been standing but are now down again, don't worry, they will stand up once he has his adult teeth.|`|iJtuhLMTaa	Your dog is in the teething stages and ears often go up and down when the are teething.  However if they are staying down all the time consult your breeder about taping methods to make the ears stand properly
bnJLKQWMaa	With negative media coverage about 'bully' breeds do you think this is helpful...    I think not.  If they are playing, OK,but someone is getting hurt here and it helps no one to advertise it.

They chew everything it is really nly if they ingest the plastic most gerbils use the plastic for nesting material just make sure they are not bored|`|xarKlp0Oaa	If your gerbil chews on the plastic they can't digest and it blocks their intestines and causes death. I have had many gerbils and never heard that plastic just kills them. I have had many plastic cages and as long as they don't chew on it they will be fine.|`|9GMePSopaa	As you probably know, Gerbils will chew everything that they can! <br>  Plastic isn't too good as they can easily chew it (which they like because it's nice and tough) and if it is ingested frequently it can cause blockages in their digestive system as it cannot be digested.<br>  <br>  I did, however, have plastic tunnelling in my cage for a month or so (they destroyed the tunnels in the end!) and I've had no problems since then.<br>  I just stick to safe wood now though. It's harmless and it lasts for ages because it's so tough.

If you saw the episode with the water obsessed Lab, Cesar puts on a short wet suit.  These are very form fitting, they don't hide fat.  There is no fat on the man.  He is however a typical Mexican build.  Short, sturdy and very muscular.    And as far as his training methods:   He trains PEOPLE, he rehabilitates dogs.  The dogs on the show are dogs that have seen regular trainers, and the trainer, owner and dog are still a mess.  Many of the dogs are one car ride away from the needle (R.I.P.)  I am a regular watcher and apply the psychology to my dogs.  It has improved my understanding and our relationship.  My dogs are far better behaved than many, and better than 2 years ago, (not that they were bad.)       I am also a fan of Victoria Stillwell who is a more conventional trainer, but she uses the same psychology as Cesar with the dogs.
RgO3Sn38aa	My dog totally controls me with ESP.  "Let me out"; "Let me in."; "Play with me."; "Scratch my belly"; "I'm going in the car with you and if you forget me, I'll chew up the cat." ; "My cookie bowl is empty."; "You're home from work, where is my marrow bone treat?"     I'm tired of being the slave.
bB0qV51Haa	First off please don't get his claws removed. The way I dealt with this was to keep our newest cat (she was a stray we rescued off the streets and was literally starving to death) was to keep her in the spare bedroom for the first few weeks. She was more afraid than anything else and the only life she knew was fighting and surviving. Your cats are trying to establish dominance and that can sometimes be scary to watch. After Sophie had lived in the spare room for a few weeks I started letting her out to visit with the other 2 cats we have. Our female hated her on sight but our male (also 12 at the time) really did try to become friends but Sophie wouldn't have any of it. When Sophie went after one of the other "kids" she got a time-out in her crate. Usually a half hour and I kept her near me while she was in it, talking to her and trying to soother her. The other 2 would come up and sniff and there was some growling and hissing but with time it lessened. She also spent the night in her room for about the first six months because she was an extreme case and got up to no good with the others after we went to bed. There were many times we thought about giving her up but I had become so atached to her in spite of it all that we saw it through and today she gets along quite well with the others. I think your best course of action would be to give his own "space" when he's being mean. After he's been in a room alone and calmed down a bit you can go in and talk soothingly to him. Then try bringing the female into the room with you and see how they do. When he goes after her catch him and hold him a while and see if he calms down. Hopefully it will work out with time. If not you could contact the shelter to get their advice or ask about returning him. But again, please, don't get him declawed. If you do have to return him to the shelter there is no guarantee the next person wouldn't let him outside. Besides, his teeth can still do the same damage if not more to her.|`|zeTGmB3faa	I am assuming the cat is neutered. Please don't declaw him I don't like the idea of returning them to a shelter as they are labeled or put down do to the aggression. Have you tried re-homing him? Ask friends and family, co-workers, etc if they have a nice home for your cat.   If these cats could get along, it would be good for the female as it will keep her more agile in her older years by playing with a younger cat. Have you tried the old water spray on him or a loud hand clap with a stern "no" when he chases her. Might want to give it a try and he may start to behave. If it doesn't work then, the re-homing would be the best option. Best wishes.|`|KnwsvnTjaa	Is he fixed?  If not that would make him less agressive if you had him fixed.  If he is already fixed, then as hard as it would be, you may need to take him back to the shelter for the saftey of your first cat.  First you may want to try some medication to help him calm down.  The vet has something like "kitty prozac" that helps them chill out.|`|4a4b9be516eeab81005bf8f97c61e37aaa	You should return him to the shelter.  Sometimes that happens with cats and it is not fair to your older cat to be so persecuted.    He is a young cat and can more easily find a new home than others.  He may not be aggressive that way in another home.  He shouldn't be declawed - that's not fair to him and would not make him any less aggressive toward her.|`|Z5U5uYv0aa	As unfortunate as it is, this is normal behavior. He is trying to establish is dominance and place within your home.     As a male he believes he should be the dominant animal. As the younger and more fit he believes he should be the dominant animal. And if he is unaltered, he may just be full of hormones which also makes him more aggressive and believe he should be dominant.     So treat him as the dominant cat. When you pet them, pet her first, him second, for a little longer than her. (Just the opposite of canines, cats believe their importance ranks with who you pay attention to last, and longer.)    Eventually, he will calm down, and Im willing to bet they will become very close friends. Please dont return him to the shelter, and dont declaw him. Im with your parents, it is inhumane. What if he gets outside accidentally? How will he defend himself?    I wish you and both your kitties luck. Just be patient with him, in time he will calm.|`|TY6Geyjkaa	I agree with the vet appointment. Maybe he isn't fixed after all. Also, if he was fixed recently he still may have hormones raging in him. If he was fixed when he was mature, he will have established aggressive habits that will be harder to change.     Quick fix for the claws - go to the pet store & get the rubber tips. The cost about $10 and will at least prevent him from injuring your other cat.     I'm not totally against declawing, and if his behavior is that extreme, he may just end up back in the pound. Trust your own judgement on that one - I think declawing is better than the cat being unadoptable & perhaps euthanized in the future. Maybe give the situation 30 or 90 days to get better, and if not, then make that decision.|`|HDiSjSHiaa	Please don't get the claws removed. This is a very painful procedure.    Firstly I would confine them to separate rooms for now. Then,I would contact your local shelter and ask them for advice on gradually introducing/reintroducing cats. Many shelters, if not all of them will have information on doing this correctly.    You should have at least one litter box and one food bowl PER animal. Cats have a tendance to guard the litter and food and so these items should be placed apart, Perhaps in a separate room entirely.    It could take something simple for them to get along, please consider your options before giving up on them entirely. Don't be afraid to ask for help and don't feel like it's your fault. Some cats just don't get along.|`|Qq9dRq6Oaa	Is the male cat de-sexed? cause this may be the problem if he his then you might want to keep them in separate rooms for the moment and let them smell one another through the gap under the door.  This what im doing at the moment as I have a stray kitten that is now going to stay with me and my 3yr old cat hissed and spat at the kitten and almost attacked it.  so have put them in seperate rooms for now and letting them get used to the smell of each other.  Also you may want to take him to the vet and get him check as there may be some underlying health issue that was missed at the shelter.  I don't believe in getting cats claws removed they are there for a reason just need to keep them trimmed and give him a scratching post.  Also have the vet check your female as she might me suffering from stress without showing it.  Hope this helps|`|5d10867c48069bdd586d3ac760f8a73faa	animals in the cat family are territorial.

Go on your vets recommendation|`|KnwsvnTjaa	At about 6 months.|`|y7igESfUaa	6 months is the 'usual' age to spay or neuter a cat.|`|ptNy4uicaa	Neutering (castrating a male) is usually preformed at 6 months of age. It can be done later but it is recommended to do it as soon as possible to decrease the chances of the cat picking up on learned behaviors due to hormones such as humping and spraying.     It is a brief surgical procedure, the the animal quickly recovers from.     Its great to see responsible pet owners out there like you that take responsibility for their animals and help control the pet population, to reduce the number of animals without homes that result in euthanasia! :)|`|4a4b9be516eeab81005bf8f97c61e37aaa	The Winn Feline Foundation did a study over ten years ago to show that the early neutering and spaying of cats had no adverse on their health or development.  On this basis kittens are  currently neutered in most shelters at two months of age if they have a normal weight of 2 lbs.    It is a great policy as it prevents a lot of "accidental "pregnancies with people who wait until the cat is six months of age.    There are many older veterinarians who still insist on waiting until a cat is six months old.|`|RAtgv9GHaa	maybe about six months|`|87Zhgwmcaa	Most cats are neutered at approximately age 6 months. I got my cats neutered at 4 months. As long as you do not make the incision area wet, the cats do just fine.|`|zBvKemqAaa	The newest guidelines in regards to spaying and neutering cats has changed due to the improvement in surgical procedures.  I work at a Humane Society in Atlanta, Georgia that also has a full animal hospital on its campus.  The new guidelines with a healthy male/female cat is a minimum weight of 2.2 pounds and no less that 6.5 weeks of age.
ydshiNrKaa	Your best bet would be to either go to a vet or a groomer the first time and have them show you how to clean them.  They make ear wipes that you can buy at petsmart or petco and you just wipe their ears out with it.  I usually wrap it on my index finger and put my finger into the ear and wipe it around in there.  There is a solution you can squirt into their ear, swish  it around and let them shake it out, but you need to have someone show you how to do that.  It's not hard but it's hard to describe how to do it.|`|lMYuPrhIaa	I wouldn't mess with a dog's ears until a vet/groomer properly instructs you on how to do it.    Visit the groomers, and ask them how to do it. I'm sure they wouldn't mind showing you.    Good Luck.|`|4hNRTWtDaa	You need to get a good ear cleaner from your vet.

Then when you get to were you will be collecting from you will need a harvester permit. so i total you will need not just one but two permits. the getting them home alive is the really tuff part make sure they wont be in a container for more than 24 hours make sure to use some sort of heat source i use had warmers wrapped in wet paper towels and use a insulated box.|`|I5pUxwPbaa	I think it depends on where you go, as far as I know it's illegal to take coral from Mexico but Im not sure about other areas.  The problem is, is that if everyone just took a small piece of coral, this could make an impact on it, despite good intentions|`|AA11101968	I can't say for sure, but I would think that it would depend on if the beach you get them from is conservation land, and if the coral is an endangered species.

It may sound harmless to take just a little piece, but if everyone did it there would soon be no coral left.  In most places you would probably have to be a professional marine biologist to qualify for a license to collect samples.|`|f71bc553ce48de0d47d00ce15fd871aaaa	personally id be more concerned about the laws where you harvest the corals and then surviving shipping than i would with importing laws in canada, last thing you want to do is go to jail in Jamaica for some pretty acro frags,|`|TJHxVwrpaa	Certainly|`|GHpcc5iKaa	It really depends on where you are, you can buy some at pet stores though? that always works :)|`|htSZsds7aa	Dont even try, the coral reefs are dying right now from people taking what they want. First of all you just dont break a piece off and shove it in your suitcase. Coral is living thing, and a frag has to be removed very carefully, it has to be kept at a certain temp, and put into the auarium with in several hours. You need to pack it with ocean water to keep it alive. It takes YEARS for coral to grow in your aquarium so that u can get a frag.This is why they are expensive.<br>  If u are serious about growing your own coral and seeling them in a business, you need to do ALOT of research. It is not near as easy as u think. U need alot of knowledge and equipment.

IrdZKYT3aa	Well, I'm a fan of guppies : ) my 20 gallon has 15 in it right now and I love to watch them flit around.  Since they are livebearers it's best to have 1 male to every 3 female.    Guppies are pretty hardy as well and a good fish to cycle the tank with.  I'd be careful with tetra and guppies though as they are known fin nippers and may be aggressive towards the males.  Livebeareres commonly include guppies, mollies and platy's.  So a group of 3-4 each would be fine with a few cleaners and tetras thrown in.  Tetra are also more fragile when water parameters are concerned so make sure the tanks fully cycled and has great water quality before attempting them should you choose.  Also, neon's should be in groups of 6 or more to be happiest.  Also, look into otto cats for cleaning.  I got three, as they like family.  They are great little sucker fish that stay about 1 inch in length compared to most common plecos reaching 24 inches.  Also try some shrimp or cory cats to keep the floor clean.  Best of Luck!|`|HypqcnJaaa	SHARK!|`|rS7fh6pRaa	Goldfish .. & Nemo!|`|3BvRAGcQaa	if you have a 20gallons Shabunkins are normally for ponds but they are fun look at. my favorite are fan tailed gold fish. i used to have one and he was lots of fun! unfortunately my little cousin got to him.

You might consider some platy as well, or a mix of them.    http://www.liveaquaria.com/product/aquar...    As an alternative to neons, consider cardinal tetras which are a little more vividly colored (still the blue and red).    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_te...|`|AraBfesHaa	You're right Brian, a BIG FAT NO on the shark idea.    If you get livebearers, don't bother getting anything else, unless you get ONLY males or your tank will be overrun with them.  Best bet, any female livebearer you buy is already pregnant with a potential of 80+ fry so that's all you need.  (And that's only in one batch)  And don't mix mollies with tetras.  My mollies killed and ate all my tetras.  I really don't want to suggest what kind of fish you should get, sorry, but I can tell you from experience some of the bad combinations.  Mollies also killed my chinese algae eater, in one night, they killed it and ate it all the way down to where all that was left the next morning was it's spine and a little knob on the end that was once it's head.  They also killed my apple snail, which I thought would be inpossible.  AND NO common plecos like you get at petsmart or petco.  They shouldn't be in anything smaller than 55, but even bigger than that is better.  They grow to be 2' long (at least mine did).  There are other plecos, like bristlenose that will only get to be about 6" but I've never seen any for sale around here, just on the web    I know this isn't the answer you're looking for but I hope I at least helped a little in your decision making.  Oh, and don't listen to the peeps at the pet stores.  I have yet to get the truth on compatability, size, etc from any of them.  Do your research on the web. That's what I do now.

It is a very small dog. The average height for a Shiba Inu male is about 15 and a half inches. And 14 and a half for a female. The average weight for a male is about 22 pounds and 18 for females. They are great indoor dogs. But they do have sesonal sheding. They are very active dogs and make great playmates for children. They come in black, red, and white. If you think you might be intrested I recomend you go to www.rightpuppykennel.com and look around. That is where we got ours from. (If you do go on the website our puppy is named Zach.)|`|aP4bkYOCaa	I'd suggest a Miniature Poodle or a Bichon Frise. Both breeds are affectionate and friendly, and shed minimally. They do require grooming every 4-6 weeks, but if you keep them in a puppy cut, this is also minimal.    They can be active if you're looking for a walking buddy.    If you plan on buying a puppy rather than adopting, remember to seek out a breeder who health tests for genetic abnormalities and shows their dogs. This is going to be an animal that will be with you for 14 years or more, you should get it from a breeder who will do everything within their power to make sure their stock does not suffer from issues such as luxating patellae or bad hips! :)    Check out these clubs for more info:    http://www.poodleclubofamerica.org/  http://www.bichon.org/    Best of luck!
3sB49YNnaa	I think that, given her behavior history, you might better off being a 1 pig household.  This is especially true if she seems content and you pay a lot of attention to her.  If you get a second, you need to be prepared to have her housed in a separate cage.    We put resting sows (the ones not in breeding) in girl pair cages for company but we have one sow who will not tolerate a sow cage mate and is aggressive even if the other sow is bigger than her.|`|bEQn0Vrtaa	If you give her enough attention there is no reason to have to get her a companion she will turn to you as her companion. You will have to give her a lot of loving time and play time. It sounds like she just might have a personalty to do better by herself then with another. I have had many companion guinea pigs and they were very happy and live long health lives, they are the best companion pets one can ask for. I do however spend the biggest part of my day with them, i adjust their cage so they can be next to me at any time they want. And they can also sleep with me if they choose, they usually chose to sleep cuddled up to my feet which put them neat the opening of the cage so they could dart home to potty.|`|aY3e2RLPaa	If you want to get her a pig, you're going to need a separate cage. You should keep them separate for atleast a week to make sure nobody has any diseases or illnesses that can be passed.    Once the quarantine period is over start introducing them slowly and in neutral places like the floor or a box. Some rumbling and nipping will be normal, but serious biting is a definite bad thing. If they get along on the floor put them in the same cage and moniter their behavior for a little bit. If they don't get along you have the other cage as back up.
VxKH7KHmaa	Its most likely a phantom pregnancy or (false heat).    Why not clear up all the confusion and just have her spayed?

They have a contract with PETA to not sell live feeders so they only sell frozen if you buy a mouse from them you have to pretend it'll be a pet.  If you don't have a small store that carries hoppers just try to get the smallest feeder mouse you can from the store you ussually go to.  Most balls can take a feeder.  If  its too big your snake won't eat it.  Good luck.|`|6j9EZXGWaa	If there are any other pet stores in your area that specialize in reptiles, they will have them. Petsmart sells frozen.

Not only that but for the rat to be happy they need another rat with them, or several hours of interaction with you a day.  They are very clingy pets.
jV7SmnaTaa	Yes - the dog will be fine assuming that you guys are up and about early in the morning (for sure before 8).  If they remove water at night though, they should NOT remove it during the day while at work/school.  Dogs really should have free access to water.

It's cutting it a bit fine (I would be cutting off his water at 8 or 9), but it's probably okay.|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	If you get up at 6: 00 a.m.,that's 12 hours with no water. It's a bit extreme. I would let him have water until 9:00 p.m.|`|okAYAGvXaa	It's the only way so he doesn't pee his crate/bed at night. It's ok.|`|fe447af35c529588ddeb8f78da7b83faaa	what time do they give the water back in the morning?    Our dogs don't have access to water at night.  Usually its from 10:30pm - 6:00 am. They are small dogs ranging from 1 year to 6 years old.     Your dog should be fine as long as they are giving the dog a chance to drink early in the morning and have access to it for some time before they go off to work.|`|AA10502611	your parents are correct in limiting fluids before bedtime so the pup does not have discomfort thru the night.|`|o2ekfo8Faa	I would say, depending on the circumstances, it might be ok. I would never do it, as 9 times out of 10, the dog won't go to the bathroom where he sleeps anyways, and it is always better to keep fresh water available for dogs at all times. However, if he's been very well hydrated beforehand, it probably wouldn't hurt him, provided he's getting up early enough to rehydrate himself.|`|VDy99i3oaa	It's fine as long as you make sure he's not thirsty before you take it away and you're getting up and giving him water at about 6am because any longer is too long to be without water, especially since he's so young. I would suggest taking his water away about 2 hours before you go to bed and walking him right before you go to bed and than giving him water as soon as you get up in the morning.|`|MGAmNxddaa	No,it's not okay.Puppies have been drinking "at will" for several weeks from their mom,and all of a sudden have strict hours as to when he can drink?I think I would "ration" his water between 6 and 9 maybe,then tuck him in bed at 9...he should be good to go around 6 AM...LOL|`|2YHpV9koaa	Ya. That's fine. My parents don't give my 14 months old Weimaraner Poodle mix (40 pounds) water after 11. ( He goes to bed @ 2:00 and he is housebroken). It's good for them, especially when not housebroken.
ND5KncX0aa	This type of diet for your dog is probably the healthiest choice for him.  Even the top quality foods you buy prepackaged contain preservatives and other chemicals.  I've been able to find cookbooks for cooking for dogs even!  There are plenty of people out there who do this, as long as you have the time and budget for this new diet.  Also i would like to add that salmon is another good source of protein and keeps their coat shiny.  However your dog's stomach may be sensitive to the change, so a gradual transition from the organic dog food to your home cooked food would be best.  Try calling your vet's office and see  what they say, although i'm sure they would be more than happy to sell you their brand of dog food, the vet will also have some good advice.|`|pOgzmCn2aa	My advice would definitely be consult with your dogs vet before changing his diet. Any diet change should always be consulted thru your vet.    A lot of foods are poisonous to dogs, a lot of vegetables are too! And I believe Turkey is also bad for dogs, however I am not entirely sure.    Also, your vet will be able to help you determine things like what to feed your dog, how frequent, and how to balance it's diet, it's actually quite more complicated when it comes down to feeding a dog "people food" verses dog food!|`|HDiSjSHiaa	Sounds yummy.    Don't feed turkey as it has the same effect in dogs as it does in humans, The chemical in turkey makes us sleepy. Although it's far worse in dogs.    You can also feed fruits to your dogs. Apples and berries are a good source.     Veggies are always good but you must avoid tomatoes, potatoes and onions.     Fish is great, is offers a good source of omega 3 for your dogs.     Remember, dogs can't eat chicken bones.    There are some great books on holistic dog foods, perhaps they may have something at your local libruary.|`|AA11457471	I suggest reading Dr Pitcarin's Guide to Natural Health for Dogs & Cats. There's also some wonderful recipes in the book. You have to make sure your dog is getting everything it needs in a homemade diet.  Best wishes!|`|Ei85kgfdaa	Dogs don't need veggies or their meat cooked. Nor should they have a grain based diet(rice).    If you want a home made diet then go research and feed raw. Otherwise stick to the high quality kibble.|`|D3agflP1aa	well i htink that dogs can eat anything other than like chocolate but still im not a pro|`|ardSb3jlaa	i would start with chicken and rice. if you dont already know this, the rice is very good for a dogs digestive system as it helps to absorb the food. really hope i helped!!!    (i wish i was that dog eaten human food and all) lol!!!|`|RFfTjnxzaa	I feed one of my dogs cooked food, and so do some of my neighbors. To be really honest with you, I know a lot of people who cook for their dogs.    You seem to have a pretty good menu set up here. Try it out and see how it goes.|`|Y43nptlvaa	Just use a dog food recommended for it.. ot will save you time and money|`|57mE02q3aa	nooo give him normal dog food if u give him or her she might get fater|`|PNT4iuyWaa	i had a german shepard and when he got sick i remember always giving him ground beef with white rice it helped his digestive system|`|okAYAGvXaa	What you are suggesting is 100 times better than the shyt from a bag.  I feed raw, though.|`|VDy99i3oaa	It's a good idea, especially if you plan on feeding him organic food. I suggest looking up what a dog needs in a balanced diet and than ensure that that is exactly what you're giving him. Also if you do decide to do this, wean your dog onto the diet so that way his body is accustomed to the food before he is completely on that type of diet, the same as you would with switching brands of dog food.|`|LochBxhlaa	i dont think it sounds like too good of an idea. u gotta remember that  dogs aren't people. i don't want ur dog to get sick. but im sure he is healthy enough right now.:D|`|o2ekfo8Faa	Talk to a vet/nutritionist first, before starting your dog on any new diet.
50WCN0graa	If you are committed to caring for and exercising your dog, you can definitely get a dog. It is great that you are taking this step so seriously... because it definitely changes your life.    We got a pup a year ago and both my husband and I work 8 hours a day. We do have to devote ourselves to playing, giving attention, and walking our dog when we get home... but, if we do those things, he is happy as can be. We try to at least walk him once a day.... usually 30 minutes. Once and awhile we miss, once and awhile we take him out to run in the woods for hours or play at the dog park. When he was 4months- 1 year, he definitely needed the most exercise... he required longer walks and/or more dog park time.    It is harder when they are puppies. They can't hold their bladders very long. I have heard they can usually hold their bladder for 1 hour for every month they are... ie: 8 months, 8 hours. I found this to be pretty true. So, when our dog was a baby, I tried to come home every day at lunch, if possible, to let him out and change his crate blankets.    Sounds like you know this is a serious commitment and are really making sure you are ready. That is great! As long as you are willing to put forth the work when you are home, you can definitely work a full time job and be great pet owners. Best wishes!|`|Iyl5N9EKaa	Got to your local animal shelter. You sound like you need a dog not a puppy and there are sooo many that need a home. They have profiles and can help you find the perfect dog. With a dog your able to walk them twice day and some days get away with just one. What is important is how long you walk them. Good Luck.|`|n7GOiKC0aa	Hi,    Dogs need 30 to 60 minutes a day exercise which includes a good walk.  Here's more info:    http://tinyurl.com/ac6w8x|`|c2d91f8848c790497d198b753a8d3401aa	An older dog can probably go 8 hours at a time without going out.  A young puppy could not go that long.  Consider an older dog that needs to be rehomed.    The opposite end of the deal is too much walking.  Puppies shouldn't be overexercised as that can lead to joint issues.  So while they need to be let outside and can play in the backyard, you probably don't want to take them on mile long runs until they are closer to 1 1/2 years of age.|`|HDiSjSHiaa	Every dog is different.     It all depends on breed and age of the dog. If you adopt a border collie puppy, they will need at least an hour in the morning and the same again at night...    As Opposed to a 6 year old mix breed who is happy with 30 minutes a day and will quite happily sleep the rest of the day.    It all depends on mental stimulation. A good saying is a tired dog is a happy dog. You can walk some dogs for hours... but unless you provide the mental stimulation they will never be tired.     Throwing a ball, doing some tricks, some mind-using toys or even some obedience commands will help tire out a dog.    I highly suggest looking for a slightly older dog at a shelter. It's not fair to get a puppy and expect them to behave when both your routines are so sporadic.|`|VDy99i3oaa	It is possible for you to get a dog, however you would want a dog that can handle being alone for that length of time.  Concerning the walking issue, how often a dog needs walked depends on the scheduling of his feedings. I suggest that after he eats in the morning walk him and than take his food away while you're gone. Than whichever one of you gets home first would give the dog his food when you get back and leave it out for the rest of the night so that way he isn't hungry. You would need to walk him as soon as you get up in the morning, right before you leave, when you get back and once before you go to bed. This is feasible and as long as the dog is housebroken, has water available and is getting walked at least 4 times a day, you should be fine and the dog won't be suffering or anything.|`|CkecSp4Uaa	A dog should be walked at least once a day, even if they have a large fenced yard.  As far as I know, there is no "maximum" number of times a dog should be walked unless the dog has a medical condition that results in an exercise intolerance.      Most people have to work at least 8 hours a day in order to pay for the house and caring for a dog.  I would say that if you and/or your girlfriend are willing to make time to walk the dog (getting up an hour earlier for example, or skipping a night out with friends to go home and walk the dog) then you should have enough time to walk a dog properly.  However, given the length of time for which you are likely to be gone and the fact that your schedule can vary so much I would not recommend getting a puppy.  Puppies need to go out every few hours and they really do best on a set schedule that is more or less the same from day to day at least until they are older.  An adult dog would probably be a better fit for your lifestyle as they are physically capable of being more flexible than a puppy.|`|ydshiNrKaa	Well dogs like routine and will do well on a regular schedule.  If your hours are erratic getting a dog may not be the best thing to do at this time.  depending on the breed of dog you get also will depend on how much exercise the dog will need.  Just taking it for walks is not all that needs to be done when you own a dog, which I'm sure you are aware of if you have had previous dogs.  They need more exercise then just walking, they need to be run and socialized with other dogs and people.  If you don't have the time you really should wait on getting a dog at this time.|`|fe447af35c529588ddeb8f78da7b83faaa	My dogs are walked at various times during the day.  My schedule varies as well.  As long as you are walking them it won't be a problem.  I've had to miss a couple of days because I had the flu and couldn't get out of bed.  The dogs were okay but I could tell today when I took them out that they needed an extra long walk to get that extra energy out.     I have a chi, terrier mix and a lab and we go for 45 min walk in the winter (sometimes more) but with the weather its too cold to go any longer.  In the summer it will be 2 hour walks.  If you want to half that into two walks that would be fine too.     The length of the walk will depend on the size of your dog and the energy level they have.
fe447af35c529588ddeb8f78da7b83faaa	My chi goes in circles for two reasons.  1) if she has to go pee or poop she'll circle around until she goes. Sometimes she twirls 20 times and then doesn't go.    2) If she is trying to get comfortable and decide where to sleep.|`|18uFvmFDaa	No worries :-)  She's just getting comfy!|`|p5IR7ezTaa	Your Chihuahua is perfectly normal dogs do that they usually turn in circles when they are looking to find a comfortable spot to lay|`|DSzG23WRaa	My chi does this when he has to go pee or is just trying to get comfy.

All dogs in pet sores and from breeders will eventually be bought and taken home, but animals in shelters may be killed if people like you and me don't bring them home.  You may find a dog similar to a Yorkie for free, and you will feel so good that you didn't let the poor puppy die.|`|iJtuhLMTaa	There's no such thing.  If you find a "breeder" selling yorkies for under $200 you are going to end up paying thousands of dollars to deal with medical issues due to poor breeding.   Yorkies from responsible breeders are generally $1000+ and they aren't going to sell to a child.  Some shelters and breed rescues may have and older Yorkie in that price range but again they aren't going to adopt to a child.       As far as liking children, infants and other dogs that is a matter of training and socialization and takes work it doesn't just magically occur.   If you want a dog to be trained you are going to have to train it.  Some but all dogs from rescue may have some training done but many don't.       As for dressing it up.  Its a dog not a fashion accessory.|`|lMYuPrhIaa	Ok there are SOOO many things wrong with this question.    First off, a GOOD yorkie is going to cost you over $500...at the VERY least!    A dog to dress up?? Dogs are dogs, not FASHION ACCESSORIES!!!!    Oh, and they have to be TRAINED to like kids, dogs and babies.    You MIGHT be able to find one in a shelter near you, but it is unlikely.    PLEASE PLEASE think more about this before considering getting a dog.|`|htWtHCIfaa	wow, how old are you? if u get any dog under 200 dollars, itl either be a shelter reject with attitude problems, or have health problems from bad puppy-mill breeding. A dog is a huge responsibility, and I wouldn't recamend a yorkie. Are you still in school?

Yorkies, or any dog for that matter, are living creatures that require care and attention, not toys to play dress up with!  Furthermore, if you want a dog of any sort, you will have to save your funds just like everybody else and pay the price for one for a breeder.  It's not sensical to expect to be able to get something for less than it is worth simply because you "want" it.  Breeders have expenses they have to cover by the price they charge for puppies they place.  $200 wouldn't even begin to cover the costs a breeder incurs with one dog.  I also seriously doubt any reputable breeder is going to hand over one of their dogs to someone who wants one because they want a dog to play dress up with.  If your funds are limited, try a resuce or shelter, but don't expect to be able to get something for nothing.|`|41m6RZ4Jaa	you could prob get one for just less than 800, thats the cheapest you will get, if in australia, try freedeom kennels is south australia, they are usually the cheapest place you can get them|`|9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? www.petfinder.com|`|MBcP3Tfzaa	go to your local spca. i think the adoption fee is like 100 $. and you are rescuing a puppies. giving one a home! always to them before any other adoption places.!!!!!!!!!! good luck!|`|Rr2D2POcaa	No way you could get a dog that cheap, some from a breeder cost over 1,200, lol.

And about how every one else is saying dressing up dogs is "cruel"  Some dogs like wearing sweaters because it keeps them warm like my dog has a bear tummy and is only 7 pounds so we put a coat on him to keep him warm and it doesnt bother him in the least.  Just take it easy with the "dress up"|`|2P5WRadhaa	Forget finding a quality Yorkie for under 200.00. Instead, go shopping at some rescue shelters and find a puppy that automatically gets close to you. You can find everything you're looking for and more at the shelters; and the dogs don't cost nearly as much, and are just as loving, cute, and interactive as any high strung pure bred dog. You'll be much happier. NC has many shelter programs. I live in NC; I have 3 shelter dogs - love them all and they are great, and are very social.    PS: Forget, also making a dress-up clown out of your puppy. Show them more respect than that. If you are just wanting a dress-up dog, you really aren't ready for a dog. Learn mature responsibility for the animals before you get one for the wrong reasons.|`|c90696a851f3ee0c6b1f63f7f595eca4aa	First of all, try the pound. Where I live, little dogs are 150 dollars and big ones are 50. Secondly, even if the initial price is pretty cheap, dogs cost a lot of money.

I hope this helps!!!  I hope you get your dog too!!!|`|qW0tq6A2aa	first off, dr. hannibal lecter, "if u get any dog under 200 dollars, itl either be a shelter reject with attitude problems, or have health problems from bad puppy-mill breeding.".... this is NOT true so completely disregard that.    many dogs go into rescues because the owners were not prepared for a dog, they have to move, they have been abandoned, they have been cruelly treated, they have ran away, owners have passed away, owners' dogs weren't neutered/spayed and now they have puppies they dont know what to do with, etc. but the point is... that statement is completely UNTRUE and i really hope that it does not keep people from looking into adoption from shelters    secondly you should research yorkie rescues near you. many rescues specialize in a specific breed and yorkie rescues are very popular... plus they can give you lots of information about the breed.    speaking about information about the breed.... have you researched this breed much??? yorkies have a high maintenance coat, can be very yappy, and being a small dog, could very easily suffer from insecurity (which many small dogs do)... insecurity meaning scared of other people, biting other people (from fear), barking at people, scared of other dogs, biting/barking at other dogs, hiding, seeming fearful, etc... i take it you will carry it where ever you go... this will NOT help insecurity and will just make it worse. yorkies are also terriers and terriers can be a difficult kind of dog as they are bred to dig, bark, chase things, hunt, etc.... maybe not what you want. not to mention, yorkies are known to have housebreaking difficulties... are you sure you want that?     dont get me wrong, they can be great dogs.... but it doesnt sound as though you are quite ready or prepared for one.    purebred dogs can actually be very difficult also because oftentimes they have been bred to have one trait very strongly and this can be VERY frustrating. i highly recommend mixed breeds as my family has owned 7 different dogs and mixed breed or rescue dogs make the best pets... the purebreds have had health problems, mental problems, and desires to do things CONSTANTLY that were a little bit too much to handle many times.     shelters have many little dogs and some of the CUTEST dogs as well.    also, you said you want a dog so you can dress it up??? seriously??? that is NOT what dogs are for.... that's great, but i hope you are ready to handle and care for a dog properly (and that does not include dressing it up) or else you are just asking for serious psychological problems in the future that will be bad for the dog and ultimately bad for YOU. will you be able to have time to train it? feed it every day? give it proper exercise for a good 40 minutes EVERY day? do some homework and research? be willing to take it to the vet and take care of its expenses???    you want it already trained and one that likes other dogs and babies.... ok im sorry but you have to be willing to put in some work yourself!!! your best shot for this is going through a shelter.    it just sounds like you are NOT ready at all and because of this i say you shouldn't get a dog until you do some research and figure out what you're getting yourself into... otherwise you're not being fair to the dog that you get.... a dog NEEDS attention, exercise, food, etc. to be psychologically happy and balanced... (which is also another reason so many dogs end up in shelters because of owners like you... no offense... that go into getting a dog having NO CLUE what they're in for)   Do your homework!!
fe447af35c529588ddeb8f78da7b83faaa	Dogs make eye contact whent hey are trying to show dominance.  The fact that the chi is not making eye contact is good.

It is hard to say how to handle the way the first dog is behaving. But you will need to give her attention. Maybe, afterwhile, they will get to be buddies. The thing you will need to watch will be the way the puppy acts as it grows. The puppy may seem like a threat simply due to the size of the German Shepherd, so you will need to teach the new dog to be gentle. This could take some time. One thing you might consider doing is to cage-train the pup. In this way, your pup will be easier to housetrain, as well as having the role as lower on the totem pole from the Chihuhua. When the puppy gets too boistrous, you can put her in the cage, if necessary, which will be a great advantage. Additionally, we used to own a German Shepherd. I can say, unconditionally, DO NOT try to train the dog to be a guard dog at the door. It is usually second nature. You will not need to train this, and usually dogs learn to bark at the door by a certain age. Don't worry if she does not do it right away. Train her to be gentle and a kind dog. That is the best training you can provide. Our dog became a large problem at the door, in the car and during walks. Gentleness - the best. Spay at the appropriate time for better behavior, too.|`|9QKZ878Raa	just make sure that you give both dogs equal amount of attention|`|NVCC7UYMaa	That reminded me of my dogs I have a Candian white Shepard mix and a Dachshund Chihuhua mix. =]  Your dog is jealous but will probably get use to the new dog.

2P5WRadhaa	You still can't go wrong with a Boxer! Even if you give them an extra walk/romp or two each day, it will pay great dividends. I have 3. Small fenced yard, but I let them out FREQUENTLY! I monitor them while they're out so I can discipline them about digging and chewing, and I have no trouble whatsoever with them inside. They are all crate trained, and I can leave them IF I have to for 4 - 6 hours. I'm generally home, but sometimes I have to go for Doctor visits, groceries, etc. and they do great. They are loving. loyal, protective, and gentle at the same time. and are bred to protect kids. They are very tolerant of kids and their rough playing. I love the Boxer Breed I've had them for over 14 years! Wish I had found out about them sooner.|`|bnJLKQWMaa	I think a trip to your local Humane Society might help you.  You can find a slightly older dog that is good with kids and you can see how it will interact with you and the family.  I would not recommend a Boxer as they are rather hard to train and can be very stubborn.    A large dog in a small yard can be OK as long as the dog is getting lots of exercise as well, good long walks and playing ball.    I hope you find what will suit your busy family.  Best wishes.|`|DI9wXRVgaa	I agree with those who suggested you pass on a large breed dog until you have the room and lifestyle for one as it is simply not fair to the breed traits of the dog - no matter if someone else's limited experience suggests otherwise.    The Humane Society is not a bad place to look for an already big, friendly and loyal dog. We adopted a three-year old Boxer from the Humane Society when my sons were little. There was nothing wrong with him either - his owner just couldn't keep him. His owner named him Rolf. Rolf was a beauty. He lived to be nine years old and the only problems he ever had were skin conditions in the summer. He was a very energetic dog but not rowdy or hyper. It seemed the more he aged, the sweeter he got.     I for sure would not give up on your desire to have a boxer even if the time isn't right. They are the cutest pups and they are incredibly loyal and mischievious. You will love it - but again - you will want enough room *and* time for it. Too, I think you will want to get your Boxer from a breeder in your area when you are ready.    Still, I wouldn't discount the Humane Society  - not all the dogs are 'duds' like some people seem to think. Good luck :)|`|A4v5B2zXaa	To be honest it sounds like you already have your hands full and since you have a small yard w/ all the kiddies and one dog already I don't think it would be fair to bring another dog home at this time. However it is your choice. So good luck.|`|PQv034s8aa	take your dog to a dog park frequently, maybe once every two days. so it can get proper exercise|`|p9A61dFgaa	Go to your local pound ask about their dogs. You can keep a big dog in a small yard(better than the pound) you'd be suprized at the beautiful dogs in the pound (I nearly died I found a Boxer puppy in mine) Boxers can be trained tie him to start with teach him the boundaries. Gd luck|`|qy73mdfHaa	Greyhounds are couch potatoes! Loving, sweet, quiet, but big ole couch potatoes! Save one and have a friend for life!|`|r18PoGJiaa	Mastiffs  They are huge dogs but need little exercise.|`|11e7b5ad9ba61d1a91f337642b15102eaa	Get a big lazy dog like a pit bull|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	I think if you want a boxer, you'd better invest in a proper dog run.  A rambunctious breed like that is liable to blow right through an invisible fence and run loose on the golf course.  Invisible fences are not reliable especially for strong-willed dogs determined to escape.
w1lh1INHaa	He's a domestic longhair cutie, part licorice and part spun sugar.|`|oldKepHXaa	why he isnt a cat at all!  BEHOLD a dust bunnie!|`|y7igESfUaa	I know it's not what you want to hear, but he is most likely a Domestic Longhair. Not that there's anything wrong with that! I've got two Domestic Shorthairs myself! :]    If I were to choose a breed that he looks most like.. a Somali maybe?    Either way, he's gorgeous! :D|`|RAtgv9GHaa	He ls very cute.  i would say his dad was a tabby,and the mom was a silver kittie!!  I had one like that and we saw him mom and dad,a tabby,and then silver mom.|`|77700ae60cac2abd41d7a7f8bd98336aaa	Handsome cuss. He looks a lot like a female I had that lived to be 21 years old. I had a friend that thought she was "Russian Blue" She was born to a barn cat so I don't know, but you might want to research that.|`|4aAhEK9daa	He doesn't look like ANY particular breed which is why people have told you "domestic longhair" - which is just the term for a cat of no particular breed or breed mix.  Only THREE PERCENT of all cats on this ENTIRE PLANET are of a particular breed.  Cats were domesticated nearly 4,000 years ago and most don't bear traits of ANY particular breed.|`|Xuuv8klAaa	a purr_ty one!!!   :)|`|zBvKemqAaa	The general term for a non-pedigreed cat ("ALLEY CAT") is either Domestic Short hair or Domestic Long Hair cat.  This is a reference that there is no sure way to determine what he is a mix of or how many mixes of past family lineage he may have.  He kinda (just a guess) may have some silver point Siamese or Somali in his distant past.  PS-He is gorgeous.|`|vAF4wgVDaa	I can tell you one thing. He is adorable.    Not really sure about the breed. He doesn't look Main Coon or anything. He is Def. Domestic long hair. He just looks like a regular cat to me, and that is all right. All of my cats are just "whatevers". As long as they love me I do not care.|`|eYcNsptOaa	When I was little we used to go to an auction where they had some thing (we were never allowed to see it so I don't know what it was suppose to be, but I digress)  that they called Lil' Rico.  The marketing line the people used was We know his mother, but WHOOOOOO was his father?  I think the same thing applies to your kitty.    It is a cute cat, however, probably nice and soft.|`|Qq9dRq6Oaa	I agree with everone else he is a domestic long hair - a political correct way of saying alley cat or cross breed.  He's very cute.  I have a domestic short hair that look like a bombay cat.  But I wouldn't trade him for the world.  Domestic short/long hair cats are the best cats around they are more robust and resilient compared to their pedigree cousins.
oldKepHXaa	your cat is Retarded dont worry i have a retarded cat to|`|HwujORd2aa	Ooh she really loves you and trusts you now, and wants you to play with her.  Agree with the others.  Get some toys or string and play. (Don't leave the string out without watching her though, she'll eat it and that's bad.)|`|pUaGFbzaaa	she wants to play! get some string and get ready to run!|`|X7fJjXFuaa	she wants your attention and wants to play. get her a few toys and figure out what she likes best.     i play flashlight with my cat and he loves it. all you do is move the beam of light around on the floor and they will follow it and go crazy trying to catch it.|`|uHCIxJmqaa	if shes a kitten she just wants to pounch and play with anything - give her lots of toys and a laser light is GREAT for cats and gives them tons of exercise.   if the cats older i always heard cats will run around and act crazy right before weather is about to come  i have a cat that does nothing but lays around but when a storm is about to come she goes off the wall!!|`|63y7bTNMaa	she was taking time to get to know you and now that she has realized you are a trusted human and wants to play with you, you should get some toys and string and whatnot, and use those as a diversionary to get her to play with them instead of pouncing on your leg or arm, shes not crazy shes, playful, its a good thing, if you see her about to pounce you toss a toy in front of her and she will try to chase it and she will forget all about you and think about the toy you just tossed, climbing toys (the big things with carpet on them and compartments) are great for active playful cats also, take time out to play with her and she will tire and not want to pounce you so much, if you don't like this and don't have much time to play with her, simply leave some toys around and give her a slight (not harsh whatsoever) reprimand for pouncing you and she will learn not to do this, something like "bad kitty jasmin" and say it with a firm voice, other than that, just play with her and she will be happy and pounce you less|`|zBvKemqAaa	Nope, your cat is not going crazy.  She has become completely happy with her home and enjoys her tight relationship with you.  She needs and wants to play.  Teach her to play with cat toys and avoid using your bodyparts a a cat toy.  You want to make the actual cat toys the focus of her kitty play and energy and not your bodyparts as toys.  Its a matter of training and consitancy.|`|bfe64c1553815bdd2ea9e4f6ff28becdaa	I adopted a very neurotic kitten that wouldn't leave me alone and thought I was a toy.  I got him a playmate and he was very happy playing with an older female kitten.  You might want to get her a female playmate that way you won't have to worry about having kittens.

po62AbPqaa	critter nation cages are great...lots of room and easy to clean. I have the australian version ferret kingdom...it is good but not as good as the critter nation cage...wish we had it over here (ps note: Ferret Nation cages are not good for rats as the bars are too widely spaced)    you can give rats a small amount of chocolate, but it is STILL JUNK food    you are right about the other dietary no nos, but also no uncooked potato, sweet potato, no brussel sprouts too I read    anyway...good luck :>|`|M9o5WpOqaa	First of all,congratulations on your new rats-I know you're going to love them,they are AWESOME pets! I will do my best in helping you answer your questions,k?  1)Scuffling is normal,as they are establishing the pecking order-deciding who's 'in charge.'You might want to separate them for a short time (10-30 minutes) if it gets out of control.  2)Diarrhea could be caused by the stress of having a new friend in the cage with him.Should go away within a day or so,but keep a close eye on him,and have an experienced exotics vet handy.  3)Heavy pooping is normal,just make sure the stool firms up.  4)A smelly rat will soon learn to groom himself and will eventually spend a majority of the day grooming.  5)Neutering should wait until they are at least 16-20 weeks old.  6)Most pet shops sell pet rats at about 8 weeks old.Size/age doesn't have a lot to do with it.I had a young rat that was almost twice the size of his older brother.We appropriately named him Moose.  7) There are lots of good cages on the market,but I recommend a very large one-something with lots of levels and stairs/wheel.I checked out Martin's cages and noticed that most of them are made from galvanized metal...which has severely sharp edges and often rusts.Please get one that is powder coated and baked.  8)Rats aren't very choosy in the foods they eat.Best choice is a natural rat food purchase @ a pet store.Here is a list of good/bad treats for your new babies.They will love you for it!  Good:ripe bananas (in small quantities),seedless grapes,unsweetened cheerios,warm oatmeal,unsalted crackers,skinless chicken,broccoli,the white (only) part of a hard boiled egg,cooked pasta (no sauce),yogurt (in small quantities),unbuttered toast,unsalted pretzels,cooked rice,carrots,tiny bits of apples,pears,and plums,kiwi fruit,raisins.  Bad:chocolate (NEVER give them chocolate),onions,garlic,butter,lemons,l... cereal,lettuce,spinach,celery.  Though this was long-winded,I hope I was able to help!  Have fun :D|`|I6KKFwxXaa	1 your dominant male is because he was the first when you put them in the same cage did you scrub it really well and take out all old toys etc????? the smell could have been from the tank the pet store kept him in I use baby wipes the hypo allergenic one to clean my Sady she is the only one I have with hair LOL my other 3 are hairless and the baby 14 weeks I got yesterday. They should be fine together they are young.2. the pooping yes he should out grow it give him a few more days and him pooping all the time well he will out grow that too it is his way of saying he is scared. 4 I have girls so don't know the risk but check with vets who specialize in small animals they can give you more information RESEARCH is the best way to find a vet for you boys. If you do not feel comfortable talking to the vet then go with your gut and find another one. The cage I have the one in the link below for my 3 the baby will not fit in it yet she can get through the bars I will also include a link for the one I want. & as for the foods I don't give my girls chocolate but I have heard of people giving them chocolate chips as a treat 1 or 2 shouldn't hurt but it is my preference, Avacados and anything citrus I have also heard it is not good to give them spinich but i have given it to my girls before and they are fine,. You can feed them most veggies and most fruitsmine love bananas I have also seen pictures of other people feeding their oranges so IDK about the citrus thing. I also mix things like trail mix, dried fruits, those chips and pretzel mixes, have used bulk parrot food mixed with their own rat formulated food because of the larger things in it and the seeds, I got them the gerger graduates freeze dried fruit snacks today and have given them baby food before as a treat corn on the cob and carrots my girls love them, an occasional chicken leg bone or peice of tender they had a chicken vienna sausage today from the gerber graduates baby section crackers and chips pop corn omg they go nuts if I have some you can give them peanut butter but it should be on a cracker like even the pb cheese cracker, I have mixed gold fish in with their food as well. It is easier to tell you what I have given them than it is to tell you what not to give them, ALL OF THE SALTED FOODS ETC OTHER THAN FRESH FUIT AND VEGGIES SHOULD BE IN MODERATION Enjoy them hold them a lot and spoil them rotten. I bought the small animal play pen and put boxes in it this one you can buy a cover for it to keep them in if you want to take them outside. I also bought in the baby section the over the shoulder baby carrier and had all 4 of them in it today when we went to the pet store it was so much easier that way and if they wanted they could climb out and on my shoulder. Fleece I use fleece like it is going out of style LOL they love it and you can buy the fleece baby blankets at the diollar tree stores here or scrap at Wal Mart. Bird toys and ferret toys are good for them also the rope toys for dogs I don't use anything hard plastic mostly things that will not hurt them if they chew on it. Clipping nails is an experience did that today and cried all over my Gracie she started licking my mouth as if to say it's ok. Have fun with them if you have other questiions you can e-mail me same screen name as here @yahoo I also have messenger just put in the subject rat friend or something because i play in canasta league and have over 100 people in my messy|`|6lXkzc5Aaa	Hi I've got two little boys as well ( OZ AND ANGEL) In fact oz and angel are both sitting on my shoulder right now.    1. They will be fine together mine tumble all the time and Oz squeaks but it's normal. And cute to watch.    2. Well sometimes they have diarrhea because of the food there eating it should go away but if it doesn't contact your vet.    3.Yes they poop on you because they're scared and don't worry when they get older they won't    4.Epie is probably smelling more because he is dominate and wants to let sock know that he's the "TOP" male. Again once he gets older and more used to you he'll stop smelling, also desexed rats smell less. It's best when they get older to desex Epie and sock because they will "mark you" and will explore more eg. they will go outside if the doors open .      5. You can't if you really want to know you could go to a vet.    6. Mine have a big double story rabbit hutch they LOVE IT don't get anything too small because rats do grow biggish.    7. raw meat, raw potatoes and kidney beans there's more but thoses rats CAN NOT EAT and yes you can give them Chocolate, I occasionally give mine some as a treat.

fWf3A3Ioaa	You mean when it says "1 part kaytee to __ parts water" I'm guessing.    It's talking about the mixing ratio.    So for example, if it says 1 part Kaytee to two parts water, this would be the ratio should be 1:2.    The ratios don't make much sense - the best thing to do is get your water boiled, and add the formula in slowly stirring after you add a little bit, until it gets to the right consistency (like runny porridge for young babies, like thick porridge the older the baby).|`|54fdf2affdc8dc366315eec2cecd5920aa	It means amounts.

6cbce34f6d81808399f7101c75d8526baa	Hi, I have 1 and he will only eat meal worms and super worms. You should try crickets and veggies with greens like collard greens, turnip greens and mustard greens. I have never been able to get mine to eat the veggies or greens but i keep trying.  Yes you do need to treat his meat with calcium. I do mine each time. You will also need to have a fairly large pan of water so he can get in it. Most likely this is where he will poo as well.  Don't forget you will need a UVB light and heat bulb as well. The UVB should run the length of his cage and for the basking or heat bult you can use regular light bulbs but be sure to get yourself a digital thermometer probe so you can keep check on the temps. I use the UVB as well as 2 dome lights to keep my temps up and I also use a ceramic heat bulb continually but then my house is on the cold side. You might not need the ceramic heater bulb if your  house is warm. You will also need to have your dishes for feeding. The meal worms don't escape as easily as super worms. Mine used to eat from the dish but he is spoiled and will only eat now from tongs. LOL I hope this has helped you.|`|At0d5ltlaa	Probably meat. And don't keep it away from the mother for too long. If it can't stay warm from a fire (like in the mother's belly), it could die. Make sure it gets plenty of firebeans so it can breathe fire.|`|yjsIhHeuaa	Well, basically its best to start off with crickets, small ones are the best, make sure your tank has a substrate suitable for them not to eat, the baby's WD have no clue they can die from consuming too much substrate. So i veer towards the outdoor carpet stuff as its easy to clean. after your water dragon get a little bigger, you can offer guppies, small feeder fish, meal worms, super worms, night crawlers (are excellent source of calcium). Dust crickets twice a week, and provide ample UVB lighting, mercury vapor works the best -www.reptile-UV.com- or a florescent tube piked up at your local pet store, reptiglo 5.0 works the best in my experience.

First why would someone sell you an egg for say $25when  he could sell the baby for $1200 ?    Next --one of the ways to prevent an egg from hatching is to shake it. The egg will be delivered by extremely careful delivery men. LOL Yeah sure I got a wrought iron cage with a dent in it.     That leaves you with the scam artists who will take your money and ship you some eggs from Cameroon or some other place in Africa. That's another laughThey will ask for more shipping charges  and you will never see an egg or your money again. Now that you have publicized a desire for a macaw you will get all kinds of offers for birds. They are even worse than the egg offers. Don't buy anything you can't  see before you buy. These schemes are rampant and people lose hundreds every day. The best way is to save your money and buy from a reputable dealer|`|9UjRLeJMaa	Save money. Live Better. Walmart|`|MCmV7BOIaa	If you find ads for fertile eggs..don't bother..they are not from reliable caring people who in most cases only care about money and possible scam artists..no responssible breeder sells fertile parrot eggs, Weaned babies yes..fertile eggs no..      Besides you cannot guarantee the eggs won't get damaged during delivery and the embryo could be destroyed..        If you are wanting a baby  macaw or cockatoo find a breeder or good reliable petstore and buy a weaned youngster that no longer needs handfeedings.  Most people believe that the bird bond to them if  they handfeed them from day one..this is not true what creates a bond between you and your bird is the time spent with them.|`|T2rU15Nsaa	Those ads are a scam! There is not a single breeder on the planet selling exotic parrot eggs. In fact, when we see an egg in the nest it is cause for a celebration (bust out the champagne!!) and there is no WAY we would sell it. Some parrots only go to nest every few years for crying out loud!   Not to mention the fact that moving the egg can kill it (in nest egg candlers are a must have so we don't have to pick it up) And when something happens and we have to incubate the egg there is only a chance it will hatch. Exotic eggs are extremely fragile and worth their weight in gold. If it were as easy as buying a fertile egg from someone and putting it in a chicken incubator, no one would bother spending tens of thousands of dollars on buying and keeping exotic birds in the first place. Sorry, but unfortunately there is no shortcut. The only way is to pay your dues with the parents over a period of years, and then you get that one chick, but it's all worth it. Best wishes!!    PS: dont try breeding moluccans if you do not have previous experience breeding birds. They are the hardest, hands down. I only know a few succesful breeders. Thats one of the reasons they are so expensive.|`|47VsCAHtaa	flea market?|`|w0p8zwt7aa	Don't buy them. Depending on the type of Macaw they are only in certain parts of the world and endangered.  Go with a parakeet  or something.|`|f8O3QGBbaa	Do not trust any of those ads.  Alot of the ads will even come from here like Miami, Fl.  This is a big fraud thing going on here.  I would also love to do the very same thing.  Camaroon is the worst place.  I have heard nothing but bad things from any place that is selling these eggs.  Think about it...they will ship these eggs to you?  Eggs are fragile and must be at the right temp at all times.  Could be hard boiled by the time you get them.  How would you know what you were getting?  You might as well go to Vegas and lose your money.  I am trying to help you.
T2rU15Nsaa	Although home made formula sounds like a good, healthy idea, if you are a first timer with handfeeding, it's probably a better idea to go to your local pet supply store (petsmart, petco, or even some feed stores) and buy   Kaytee Exact Handfeeding Formula  it is easy to mix and and most chicks thrive well on it.    But the most important thing anyone can tell you about handfeeding is "temperature temperature temperature"!!!! If it is barely too hot you will have a burned crop and a dead baby (or a baby needing surgery) If it is barely too cold you will get a stunted or sour crop, and again have a dead baby or a baby needing lots of medicine and vet care.   Research the type of bird you are handfeeding to make sure on the EXACT temp the formula needs to be for that particular chick, and if in doubt about something, call a local breeder, they are always happy to help newbies!!

z6d6k1Ltaa	He's probably ok, but drooling may indicate a tooth problems so check that at the vet the next time he goes. Of course if it worsens or he has other symptoms, see a vet asap.|`|SnanuNKiaa	usually when a cat drools its because they are stressed out. if there is no reason he should be stressed and he's drooling take him to the vet. there might be something caught in his throat.|`|D2sMKkchaa	My cat is 1 (Boy) and he does this!He is fine!Don't go to the  vet unless you really think something of it,we drool in our sleep don't we?Yes we do,it is probably just because he is happy.Mine does this when he is being petted.I wouldn't think much of it.|`|5kjYFb9Taa	My cat drools because hes really fat, but if your cat is drooling a lot, its not normal. You should call a vet.|`|qBV4OX6faa	I THINK IT IS TOTALLY NORMAL BEACUSE WE DROOL WHEN WE SLEEP, SAME THINGS WITH ANIMALS! <br>  <br>  BUT I MIGHT BE WRONG, GO TO THE VET TO CHECK!|`|coYARP3aaa	Nothing bad. My cat drools when she gets exited.|`|flKkoiwbaa	Drooling for a SHORT period of time is normal if a cat is stressed or happy (my cat drools on me sometimes when I cuddle and pet him).<br>  <br>  However, drooling that is constant is a sign of trouble.  It could be an indicator of gingival disease, a dental abscess, or other mouth problems.<br>  <br>  Drooling can also be a sign of nausea, pain, kidney problems, or could be an indicator that your kitty has ingested a toxin or poison<br>  <br>  If your kitty is drooling constantly, it's time to go to the vet!|`|BpXbNjEpaa	It would probably be a good idea to get his teeth cleaned, just to be sure.  Sometimes, cats are just drool-y.  Older cats especially seem to just sit around and drool?  Our cat does it whenever he's happy (complete with lip smacking).  <br>  It isn't necessarily a sign of anything serious, but it could indicate an infection in his gums.  Getting his teeth cleaned will reveal if that's the case.|`|14RzmDTmaa	my cat dose the same thing it's okay. when they dream they drool just like we do.
pSX5stBHaa	Any veteran Cocker owner will tell you that they can be pee-pee dogs.<br>  They do this for different reasons. It can be happiness, fright, pissed off. (No pun intended.) And in some cases an infection such as UTI.<br>  <br>  Pay attention to what led up to the point where she peed in the house and she had just relieved her self outside.<br>  She could also be a submissive pee-pee dog.  I'm just throwing some issue out here.<br>  When a dog pees for you such as submissive or happiness, it is the best compliment in doggie language.  It says I respect you so much that I'm peeing for you.<br>  Check out my blog for potty training 101 www.goldenrottie.blogspot.com|`|AA10229248	You mean a 15 week old puppy isn't 100% reliably housetrained? Amazing! That would be like an 18 month old child that isn't completely potty trained.<br>  <br>  SHE'S A BABY! She's going to have accidents. She has a bladder the size of a walnut and the attention span of a gnat.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	She is a puppy. She can't hold it like a adult dog. You need to be more consistent in getting on a schedule and sticking to it.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	For her to be consistent, you have to be consistent.  You have to crate train her or supervise her every second.  Never let her out of your sight for a second.  Dogs that are not fully housebroken should not be allowed on the bed.  If necessary, tie her to you with a leash so you can supervise her every move.<br>  <br>  She's only 15 weeks, so i wouldn't expect perfection yet.  But consistency on your part will mean faster training on her part.|`|4ab58a8654f438c9feb415c928245003aa	Be more patient, it happened to my 2 female dogs when they are under 2 years of age. I guess they are unable to hold their bladder as the male dog. I realise they do not sniff round a circle before they pee, they just squat and pee, so i take it that they can't hold they bladder well. One of them still pee when she get too excited. <br>  <br>  Give her more time, she will do it right sooner or later, no worries.<br>  My dogs: <a href="http://sg-creations.blogspot.com/2009/02/pretty-but-deadly.html" rel="nofollow">http://sg-creations.blogspot.com/2009/02...</a>|`|8E8T1ZNBaa	Your dog is still young, she will go potty outside more often when she grows up a little as long as she knows that outside is good and inside is a bad place to pee.  Which you say she does, it sounds like she is a good girl and will grow out of it.|`|WFRVSU7eaa	My puppy still pees when she gets excited and shes 17 weeks old. its no big deal dont stress.|`|vouUQQzBaa	She's young give her time :) Accidents do happen.<br>  <br>  If it's little tinkles (and Cockers are famous for that lol), she might be excited and little squirts come out :P<br>  <br>  I own a Cocker Spaniel female myself. She's 3 years old now (almost 4).  They can be stubborn but ohh so willing to please. Give her love, affection. Keep on what you're doing. She'll get the hang of it :)
ZttGhvMTaa	You can tell she if suffering when she stops eating fine. If she's lazy and has a hard time getting up then she's suffering. If she starts losing a ton of weight, then she's suffering. IF your vet thinks she is not suffering then make your last few days, weeks, month really good for eachother.|`|mh9XYkGOaa	Shes probably suffering. I'm sorry but think about her.|`|GHpcc5iKaa	Well depending on what type of cancer it wont hurt her much quite sometime other then a bit of aching. I dont think you should... But if you really think its necessary then its fine i guess. But like i said before it wont hurt her much until its about time for her to pass.|`|hdO6CNQ1aa	I think you should ask the vet if she would be in pain, At least then you will know. And if the answer is that she's in pain, Then maybee putting down would be a more peaceful and kind death. If she isn't in as much pain as you think, Then Just give her all the love you can and enjoy your time with her.<br>  <br>  Sorry about her having cancer, My cat had to be put down because of cancer, I feel your pain :(|`|bepZupAfaa	i recently lost a 4 yr old to cancer. he was diagnosed almost a year ago. he played, ate,drank and did his bodily functions right up to the end. <br>  <br>  he had slowed down a lot but didn't seem to be in any pain till the last couple of weeks before he passed. then it only seemed that he had  pain when we held him. so i figured that the pressure of just being gently held was uncomfortable.he didn't like it any more. he just wanted to be down on the floor where he could roam freely.<br>  <br>  i still miss him even though i have 5 other fuzz balls. he was my cuddle bug.<br>  <br>  so no if you can handle the changes in her as the cancer progress i wouldn't put her down just yet.  as long as she shows no signs of really hurting or quits eating and such . just do as the vet says enjoy her while you can and give her all the extra love and attention both you and her share together.<br>  <br>  my prayers go out to the both of you <br>  hope this helps|`|z74BXkhSaa	if she is suffering then it is best. hard i know but best|`|bce7c7c86797ed7f455b74b4180876ddaa	As long as she is eating, drinking, and playing then I would say no. Once these stop then she is suffering and the best thing to do is to end it. Sorry to hear about that, I lost my 4 month old ferret to cancer, she died while they were operating trying to remove the tumors.|`|ZITQEwFGaa	OMGS NOOOOOOO i have a ferret too but if the doctor said to love her till the end then doctors orders nd she probley just needs aome love nd affection i will keep u in my prayers nd pray tht she'll be ok!!!<br>  God Bless <br>  Mickie Danielle|`|tVrnhFGdaa	You'll know if it's suffering or dying.

FewhKlx9aa	I have 1 dog that does this when she is nervouse or scared and the smell does go away but it can be really bad to smell this..You can take a paper towel and hold her tail straight up and squeeze on each side of her butt straight up to see if you can get anymore out..But you can just wash her behind and she should be OK..Some dogs have this problem and need to have the anal glands cleaned out before they get impacted..If you tell your vet when you go for the say and ask them to show you how to clean them it will save you in the long run..You can do this at home before they get infected and there is'nt a need for the vet all the time|`|EijzrUn1aa	If you are worried, you could always call your vet and ask. I do that when I'm worried. It doesn't sound serious, but then again, I haven't had this  problem.|`|raJETLfRaa	Totally normal, dogs empty their anal glands when scent marking/stressed/nervous etc. Bath her 'cause emptied anal glands really stink, the smell should go away soon. This really doesn't seem like anything to take her to the vets over.  :-)|`|2ef97aeb1a649982da219c1f98d30f3aaa	Its just the anal glands and you shouldnt do them yourself unless you have been shown the proper way.  Vets and your local groomers will do them too.  Our groomer does it for 5.00 where our vet charges 20.  Just call around.|`|3giaPYe8aa	This is really not a costly procedure and your scenario sounds pretty normal.  Usually when the glands are full or impacted, the dog will "butt surf" on the floor.  I do think it would be a good idea to have them expressed.  You won't have to pay for an office visit, only for the expression, which is usually done by a Tech.  Our Vet is pretty expensive and we pay $18.00 for this.  Some Vets are cheaper, some charge more.  Just call the Vet and ask what their fee is.  Do NOT let them suck you into an office visit charge. No need for it.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	She simple released from fear. a lot of dogs will do that.  All you can do is bathe her or rinse off her rear end.  She release them there is no problem.  The problems with glands is when they don't released them & become infected or impacted. Read this site for all the info on glands - their purpose, how to express them & what to look for.    http://www.marvistavet.com/html/body_ana...    You can even demonstrate on the dog on the site if you want.

You can't just take a poll you need to weigh the pros and cons of both pets. Make sure the one you choose is right for you. Lke dogs need a ton of time and kittensas well but mostly dog they need to be walked and trained. Kittens not as much. Also you will need time if you want to train your dog to do tricks.<br>  <br>  So if you have some time but not tons get a kitten. If yu hae plenty of time on your hands then get a dog.<br>  <br>  But remember KITTENS RULE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|E855dvZdaa	You have to think what do you want in the end. Puppies as well as cats are at least a 7 year commitment and they don't stay small forever.<br>  <br>  If you want to go low maintenance go for a cat. Cats are generally a good pet if you are not home that much and just want a silent companion. <br>  <br>  Dogs need a little more attention. They need to more attention than cats, they need to go out for walks, get trained, etc. Dogs are however a true life long friends and will love you no matter what. Also remember, dogs come in all shapes and sizes, but even small breeds need more attention than most cats.<br>  <br>  I have three dogs. I use to have cats and I loved them to bits too.

I would say Dog unless you are renting a home or apartment in which case they may have restrictions and limitations on weight and breed.

IRyA3m4haa	It is not unusual behavior, but the dog should be at least attempting to get to the pad.  If it is locked in a cage, you really cannot blame the puppy for the incident, when you gotta go, you gotta go!  It will be easier for the pup to control itself as it gets older.|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	The whole point of a crate is that the animal NOT soil it.  However, if the crate is too big or you force the dog to stay in too long (sorry, but 12 1/2 week old pups can't hold it for four hours!) then accidents will happen.<br>  <br>  As for the carpet, he is still learning the whole potty training thing.  Of course, look at it from his pov...you say it is okay to relieve himself on this little square of "carpet," but not on the rest of the house carpet.  Puppy pads can be a major source of confusion when potty training.|`|rMbmVzEqaa	4 1/2 hours is a long time for a 12 week old pup. <br>  <br>  <br>  Especially a toy breed. <br>  <br>  <br>  I have a 12 week old lab. She needs to release her pee every 3 hours or else she pees in the house.<br>  <br>  She just can't help it. She's never pooped inside, but again, you have a toy breed that will need to pee and poo more frequenly.<br>  <br>  <br>  The younger and smaller the dog, the more he/she will have to pee/poo.<br>  <br>  <br>  As they get older they hold it better. Remember your pup is still a baby.|`|2G6b5y8Taa	some puppy s do regress,just keep training the puppy it will get it|`|MYEEK4dcaa	A puppy can only hold its urine for 30 minutes for each month of its age.  Larger dogs can hold it a bit longer, smaller dogs require a bit shorter time between outings.<br>  <br>  Put him on a rigidly regular schedule.  <br>  <br>  One thing  you can do is get an x-pen.  This is an exercise pen you can put in front of the crate when you put him in the crate.  Put piddle pads down in the pen. Leave the door to the crate open so he can go in and out.  <br>  <br>  Clean his crate bed with an enzymatic cleaner such as Urine Gone.  It used to come with a black light so you can see where the stain is.  Clean a spot a little larger than the stain.<br>  <br>  Get a size-appropriate Kong toy and stuff it with peanut butter, yogurt, or squeeze cheese.  Freeze it overnight and give it to the pup just before you leave for work, inside his crate.<br>  <br>  NOW he has an alternative to urinating in his crate.  <br>  <br>  At 12 weeks, your puppy is still not old enough to be completely  house trained.  It's going to take several months to train him to be 100% reliable.<br>  <br>  The two important things are:  keep him on a schedule and give him an alternative to wetting in his crate while you're gone.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Apacapacas|`|UyKMwdrAaa	Some puppies are harder to train than others but most puppies need to go to the bathroom immediately after eating or drinking.  Sometimes if they eat too much at one time they can not hold it.  Same for drinking.  The thing to remember is not to scold them or reprimand them when they do that as they can not help it.  Is there any way you could put him in your bathroom with papers and puppy papers and put a baby gate across the door.  I have done that with several of my puppies and then you give them a blanket to lay on away from the puppy papers and they get the idea.

Are you sure he knows? I would suggest, when you are at home walk him to the pad every hour, even though he does not do anything.<br>  For a puppy that small he will probably pee a little. <br>  When I got my dog he was 11 weeks old, and I walked him out every hour. Sometimes he peed, and other times he did not. But i took him to the same spot every week. And when he peed, I praised him and sometimes gave him a treat (be careful not to give treat everytime or they associate the two). The duration got longer than 1 hr in a week or so. In a couple of weeks, I attached a bell to the door at his level, and every time i took him out, i rang it and coaxed him into using his nose to ring it as well. And before I know it, he was ringing the bell to go out to do his business. The puppy will grow up fast, but you need patience and time to instill some good practices in them. Hope this helps.
IQezKzNEaa	If you have to pull, definitely use a harness!  You do not want to damage her neck.  If you want her used to her leash on her collar, you could try having 2 leashes--one on her collar, so she gets used to gentle tugs on her neck, but for any harder pulling, use a harness.  Try to find a special harness that uses some kind of pressure system.  Traditional harnesses were made for the dog to pull something, not for something to pull the dog.  Pit bulls are especially strong, so I would not let her get used to her pulling you around!  <br>  <br>  Also, while you are walking, talk to your dog to encourage her to come your direction and stay by your side.<br>  <br>  Another method, which I used with some success, was to loop some soft rope through the lead-ring, then behind the back legs.  This is what they do with foals to train them to lead, and I have adapted a lot of horse-training techniques to my dogs, lol.  Whenever you pull on the rope, she'll feel the collar move on her neck, but also, the part behind her legs will encourage her to move forward; just make sure she can still move her back legs to walk, and the rope doesn't get in her way.<br>  <br>  One last thing, if your dog is ever pulling you, just stop.  I like for my dogs to sit by my side when I stop, so every time my dog pulls me (in any direction, mine or not), I stand still until he comes back to me, then when I have his attention, ask him to sit.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped, and the most important thing: patience!  You'll get there if you work hard and keep trying.  Good luck!|`|2G6b5y8Taa	you can try the harness if it doesn't work try calling her to you and if she come reward her so she sees the leash is not a bad thing but a good one and if that falls just pull her (just not to hard don't want to hert her)she walk when she gets tired of struggling with the leash|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	Just walk.  She'll come along.<br>  <br>  My first Basset Hound had the habit of lying down during walks and refusing to move.  My step-father would CARRY him home.<br>  <br>  He tried it on me one time, I just kept on walking.  After a few seconds he got tired of being dragged and decided he'd better walk too.  He was fine after that.|`|LvK6rg1caa	OMG i got one too about 3or4months too..rednose pit brown lil bad girl lol. She was afraid to walk OUT of my apartment too, I had to either carry her or drag her out lol. They just have to get used to it since they dont know what is going on lol. Once she saw that every time i put a leash on her means a ride in the car to my moms house (which they have an older dog so she plays) or to my bf's house (whish his mom has a tiny older dog too), or to the park so she know when its time to go out its playtime. <br>  <br>  She used to be so afraid the first months we tried taking her out + it was so cold (in DC). So just give her time, she will get used to it!!
r27M5SnNaa	he could have just got into something, but I would keep an eye on him for the next few hours and see if it gets worse or he starts having real bad diarrhea, then you may have a bigger problem.|`|anjf5PTFaa	call the vet if it continues|`|NAGiNKFWaa	Bile, onions, undigested puppy food, there could be 100 different things.

lhOd2hvXaa	No, he's too leggy and has an incorrect topline (probably has other faults too, it's not my breed).    http://www.akc.org/breeds/siberian_husky...    Hope this helps!    EDIT: I wholeheartedly agree with the question-asker regarding stacking. Looking at a stacked dog can give you a FALSE impression of what a dogs struction actually is.  Even I can take a dog that is hocky and stack them to make them look like they have a lovely rear.  As far as pedigree and parentage is concerned.....bah again....I've bred some incredible top-winning dogs in the past that have produced pups that had faults.  Any breeder that can't (or doesn't) say that is either lying through their teeth or kennel blind as heck!|`|P8Q39vA4aa	Bad topline and leggy. Looks like a working line cept for the topline. Working lines tend to have broken color.     TO KM who is obviously NOT dog knowledgeable:  Eye color has nothing to do with it this breed is known for having duel colored eyes.|`|aCqSF87Raa	If it your dog or just a picture you found on the internet?    Either way the quick way to tell is by examining where you got the dog from: if the dog came from a pet store or shelter, then definitely not. If the dog came from a breeder, possibly.     Did that breeder show any of their dogs? Where any of the dogs Ch titled? Did any of them have excellent pedigrees? Where any of the dog working dogs? Where any of them tested for genetic illness?|`|7fb9ba045d96cd607bd916c4c659256caa	That's a Husky ?|`|vPde97E2aa	It isn't stacked......isn't gaited.....is it bite correct....etc.    Since the breed can be "any color from black to white"...there nothing in that pic to judge.    darlin'...being cranked around like that doesn't show it's NECK or layback or much of ANYTHING but that's a DAWG. It sure lacks any depth of chest,decent bone,tight feet,strong pasterns,etc.|`|Bw18seFqaa	cant tell from a pic alone.    This doesnt look like a show-bred husky.. but it could also be a work-bred husky..  without any knowledge on the breeder, parents, pedigree, etc.. you cant tell.    Breeds that were not bred for work are more ovbious.. expecially when you see a pic of a dog with a fault or disqualification.  If someone posted a pic of a Crested, yorkie Chihuahua, or some other breed that was bred for companionship only its easier to make a guess on it..  something like a lab or a german shepherd, which may also be bred for work is harder to make a guess based on conformation alone..  not all working dogs fit the breed standard..  some breeders breed for work ability and are not as concerned with conformation faults.|`|tBJZ3RtQaa	somewhat but where i live thrs better but i think hes ok|`|KxjUim7yaa	Interesting color pattern, never seen one like that before.|`|CDBRXtnLaa	it looks like someone just copyed and pasted the head from a siberian husky to a dalmation but i dont know i mean someone would buy it if they saw it just take more good care of it|`|G6JXHvZKaa	I DON,T THINK DO  IT IS NOT VERY STRONG LOOKING  AND WHEN THE EYES ARE DIFFERENT COLORS  THAT USUALLY MEANS THAT DOGS TEMPERAMENT  IS PRETTY UNPREDICTABLE     GO FOR A MALAMUTE BETTER BREED DOG  MUCH  STRONGER  AND LESS TEMPERMENTAL
9G03aQhsaa	It sounds like more of a stomach issue.  Check to see if her stomach feels swollen, or if she seems to be in pain when you touch her stomach.  large, barrel chested dogs like labs can get something called "bloat".  This is very serious.  Check out the attached link, and if she has the symptoms contact your vet right away, she may need treatment before Monday.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Kennel cough is caused by a bacteria and can be treated with antibiotics. Your dog sounds like it might be suffering from a problem caused by bones. Kennel cough would be contagious to other dogs.|`|nY2hZrUMaa	just take her to vet    problem sorted.|`|iIGOi2Idaa	It does not sound anything like kennel cough. This is characterised by actual coughing, kind of a hacking cough and even bringing up phlegm. Dogs with kennel cough often seem otherwise all right in themselves, so don't worry about that at this stage as it is unlikely. Also, dogs and humans cannot catch illnesses from each other, and they cannot carry kennel cough from one dog to another. A dog has to breathe in the air another dog has coughed in to catch the disease.    From the symptoms you describe, you should suggest to your uncle that he finds a vet to take her to tomorrow, I would not wait until monday. At her age, you can't really afford to wait around especially if she's not eating and seeming so lethargic.    Very likely whatever the problem is it will be made worse, if not caused by her overweight. Your uncle should not have let the dog become obese - labradors are extremely prone to this, but it is terrible for their health and must be avoided at all costs. There are few illnesses that aren't exacerbated by overweight.    If the dog is OK or whatever illness she has turns out to be cureable/manageable, then your uncle should make weight loss for her a priority. She's in to her senior years, and carry so much extra weight will make life much harder for her.     Good luck to her - really don't wait until monday!!    Chalice|`|FQmZLqMdaa	Time to go to the vet. It could be anything but for a Lab not to eat is very unusual.    If it is kennel cough will bark & sound like it has something stuck in his throat, then you could try giving him a child's dose of Benefon four times a day.|`|AA11443269	First off your uncle is correct she needs to go to a vet ASAP.    Second off it's not kennel cough, KC is just that a cough, a constant and miserable cough. It will cure its self in time but the best way to speed the cure is with a Bortetalla shot. Another thing is that if one dog gets it they will all get it soon if not protected with a bordatella shot.    When a dog doesnt eat there is something very wrong. Is the dog going potty? The vet will ask you that so you must know, it is important.    But there is something wrong and it's not kennel cough, I don't know what the problem is. Keep him warm with plenty of water. Make up some chicken & rice or noodle soup and feed that to the dog - you can eat it also. Sometimes they will eat that when they won;t eat their regular dinner.    Another person said that diseases cannot cross specie lines for the most part that is true but not always. And that same person also said that kennel cough cannot be transmitted via humans; that also is wrong. Kennel cough s proper name is Bordatella and it can be carried via the air, or via a contact, basically whenever and whenever a droplet of moisture carrying the bacterium still lives.|`|zvqspfSCaa	kennel cough will not effect the way the dog eats. but they will cough a lot. it is transfered just like a cold between people. and is treatable only by a vet. as for a person carrying it i dont know

I wish I could help you.  I wish you all the luck getting your no-kill shelter built and funded.|`|msAh2tItaa	hi i love your idea but i just don't see how you could soundproof the walls and such. have you ever thought of outdoor dog runs check out dog town it is located in a hot climate and all of its kennels are indoor/outdoor and very nice and easy to care for as well as being fairly cheap to build. each is a small two room heated and cooled building with a large kennel attached housing 4+ dogs the dogs have free access to one room in the building for shelter and to get out of the heat while the other room will be for supplies or in the case of adoptable dogs a meet and greet area. also try contacting large no kill shelters to see if they can help you come up with a plan. if nothing else start small and as you get the funding add to what you already have this is normally the easiest way to start a no kill shelter. plus as people see what you have accomplished and how many animals you have already saved and rehomed they will be more likely to want to fund you because you have shown that you can be a successful no kill rescue. good luck and hope i have helped a little or at least given you an idea or two.|`|IQezKzNEaa	I'm not sure if it is practical, but could you build it like an open-air barn?  I couldn't find a picture of exactly what I was looking for, but a barn I went to had medium-height walls that left an open section under the roof for ventilation.  It worked really well, and the structure was very simple, leaving you to build inside as money allows.  Anyway, just an idea.  Good luck!

Havanese are playful, loving, and devoted to their master. They get along with people and other dogs very well! They are good watch dogs so they may tend to alert you when a person arrives at the door but when the visitor comes in they are curious to meet them. I would also suggest searching petfinder.com for a list of your local shelters that may have havanese dogs or havanese mixes. Make sure you do not buy from a pet store and support puppy mills!

I'd take it back to the breeder for a replacement.What's your contract say?|`|PM23RDycaa	Were you actually shown the test result for the parents? If not probably lying. Talk to your vet about treatment options. Its the best way to go. Sorry you have to go through this.<br>  <br>  Yes parents with good hip scores could still throw a pup with bad hips, but the odds are low. If you have a genetic health gaurantee with the breeder see exactly what is covered and also see if there are any state laws in regards to this. Said breeder may have to pay half or all of the related vet costs or refund what you paid to purchase the animal|`|iVQULHqYaa	The fact that the sire and dam had good hip scores is no guarantee that their progeny will have good hips. Healthy humans can have babies with problems.<br>  <br>  I suspect that you were too shocked by the results of the x-rays to ask your vet about treatment. Regardless of the credentials of the breeder, there is no way that you will ever come to terms with the shock of the diagnosis. Lets face it, if they offered to take your puppy back you care too much to do this.<br>  <br>  GSD's are the love of my life, however one of my puppies (fifteen years ago) had the same problem as your puppy. Her name was Ginny, she was a one off. Even as a tiny puppy should would rush across the garden and try to attack me, she wasn't playing she was aggressive.<br>  <br>  I realised that she had a problem with her gait when she was five months old and had her x-rayed, she had no hip sockets . The vet said that there was a possibility that she could have an operation when she was twelve months old, however that this may not be successful.  In the interim she said that Ginny could not play with my other dogs, run around the garden, go for walks or be allowed to meet visitors.<br>  <br>  Even a puppy with a wonderful temprement would find this difficult to cope with. Puppies need constant socialisation, long walks and training. Because of Ginny's tempriment I realise that if she was restricted that she would end up a anti social hooligan. With great regret I had her PTS. Later I discovered that her mother was so aggressive that she had to be separated from the breeders other dogs.<br>  Bear in mind that this was a long time ago and if your puppy has a wonderful temprement and you have no other dogs, perhaps both you and he  can cope.<br>  <br>  There may be other treatments available now. If you love dogs we owe it to them to end their misery if they are in pain.I hope that your vet can offer him treatment.|`|Bw18seFqaa	Yes, its genetic.  There are several genes that affect hip displasia.

There are (expensive) surgeries that can be done, but at 7 months you surely have to consider what you are going to be putting such a comparatively young dog through.  Keeping him quiet during the recovery period, and at the end of the day, with limited guarantees of the outcome.<br>  <br>  My nephew had extensive hip, and elbow surgeries done on their young Choc.Labrador who he bought, against all my advice.  The bill (he was insured) ran into thousands of pounds and the poor dog had to be kept contained for ages.  It was a nightmare because not only did they have to deal with this young boy and the pain etc. involved, they had two small children who couldn't understand why their puppy was hurting.  He did survive the surgery/recovery period however.<br>  <br>  HD is mainly genetic, although environment does play a part, and yes, even if the parents scored low, it can come through from previous generations genetically.  I would say it's entirely possible you were lied to - did you see the paperwork relating to the scoring of the parents?  At the very least, these breeders should be made aware of what has happened and shown your vet report!  Depends on the contract you had with them (if any) as to compensation etc.  But of course, money/replacement puppy can't ever be a substitute for the emotional turmoil you are going through.<br>  <br>  I think you have to be advised by the vets, and put what quality of life this young dog might expect, immediately and in the future, before your own feelings.  Hard as that may be!  I'm so sorry.|`|IyGliGWvaa	Hip dysplasia is not a condition of putting a dog to sleep, first of all. If you do, you're denying him a chance to survive.<br>  <br>  There are many medical options to alleviate the issue. Artificial joints, just as those used by humans, have many positive results, and helps them tremendously. However, it's an expensive treatment. Non-surgical interventions include weight control, exercise control and medication.<br>  <br>  I'd go with surgery, since it has a high chance of success (approx. 95% with a good surgery team), but only when there's no other alternative to alleviate his pain.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	If it's that bad at 7 months the dog isn't goint to have a real quality of life. :(<br>  <br>  Did you actually see the parents hip scores?

Did you check back further?<br>  <br>  Did you get a 2 yr hip guarantee when you bought the pup? All reputable breeders give at least 2 year guarantees.<br>  <br>  Otherwise - you are out the money, and the puppy. :(  Research more next time and try to take these people to court in the meantime.|`|UyKMwdrAaa	Hi there have u talked with the people u actually bought the dog from usually they are responsible if they have sold u a puppy that has bad hips.

The vet will check then to make sure the puppy is healthy for your health warranty, and to set up a shot schedule.  If you haven't been to the vets, I would schedule an exam as soon as possible.  It could just be the stress of a new home.  I wouldn't give the puppy full run of the house just yet, it will be too overwhelming.  I would limit the rooms, and supervise him, and when he can behave, I would let him graduate to more space.  I am sure he feels like you are going to abandon him, so he is needing reassurance.

Try leading him into each new room with a treat and give him a good play session in each room to show him there is nothing to fear.  Also, get his scent and yours on a few towels and leave one in each room so he knows he is welcomed there.    Try heating his food up a bit in the microwave to make it smell tastier to entice him to eat.  Keep monitoring the poop situation...three days is a pretty long time.  It could just be that he has not eaten, but if he doesn't go soon, or if he belly seems bloated or painful contact your vet.|`|xeDchK38aa	some puppies can be shy and timid, I would highly recommend you take it slow, give him time, give him a warm blanket and hold him alot, as he gets older I recommend you socialize him alot, as far as the not eating, try another food, have him checked out by a vet as soon as possible, if he is not throwing up and is drinking lots of water, he should be okay.  I too have 5 dachshunds, and foster them for coast to coast dachshund rescue, I currently have one foster, she was very shy when I brought her home, but was also very abused.
