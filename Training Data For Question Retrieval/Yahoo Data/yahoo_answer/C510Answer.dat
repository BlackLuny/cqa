kNDYsWEyaa	Yes your posture has a lot to do with it! Try putting a footstool under your feet to relieve pressure from back. They say it is good to use a chair with an arm rest too. The postion your monitor is to you has to do with you hunching over and your vision may cause you to bend forward . I was told it is not got for your circulation to sit in the same postion for long periods of time;try timing yourself every 30 minutes to an hour get up and do something( stretch, walk  around) to keep you from stressing your neck,back and eyes.  If listening or watching tv while on computer,try taking a break between shows. I pray this helps. I find my lack of practice in typing and having to look down at keys so much then up at computer makes my neck ache! LOL! =0)|`|bQ4RAi07aa	Stretching is critical in the prevention of aches and pain. You should take your hands off the keyboard/mouse every 30 minutes to dangle your arms and stretch your upper body for up to one minute (e.g., slow wrist circles; shoulder rolls; forearm/hand, chest and neck stretches). Get out of your chair every hour for another micro break to stretch your back and improve blood circulation. This does not mean you have to stop work (e.g., try standing while talking on the phone - you'll sound better!)|`|JFo1tiaQaa	Long use on the computer over time can cause forward head posture.  It's probably the most common postural misalignment these days because so many people do that same thing.<br>  <br>  Basically when you see a picture of yourself from the side, your ear should line up with your shoulder.  But so commonly from loss of the neck curve from an injury or poor posture day in and day out you can start to get neck pain and upper back pain as a result.  One thing to do is take regular breaks from computer work, getting up and moving around.  Another is to do neck traction to restore the curvature: <a href="http://www.arc4life.com/site/615058/page/493475" rel="nofollow">http://www.arc4life.com/site/615058/page...</a><br>  <br>  You can also get more neck stretches and exercises from the site below.|`|rELSr3Oaaa	Stop every half hour and stand up and stretch. <br>  Pull your shoulders back and arch your back and then round it several times. <br>  Raise your shoulders as if shrugging and draw circles with them.. <br>  Move your head in exagerated circles to stretch your neck.<br>  Stand up and reach high into the air with both arms and alternate moving them up as if climbing a ladder with your hands<br>  Lastly, use the best possible posture at the computer, slumping even a tiny bit makes it worse.

It is important to wash other sex to wash off all the bacteria (not saying either of you are dirty, everyone has bacteria) then you can get a UTI (urinary tract infection).

6sPcYQr0aa	It doesn’t really matter what you eat (besides the obvious junk food) and when you eat it, as long as it has the nutrients your body needs and you give it to your body when it needs it.  You cant forget protein, which is not only a main building block for your body but for your mind as well. I will explain.<br>  One of the worst things you can do to your body is stop eating. Your body needs fuel just like your car needs fuel. And just like your car, the better the fuel and oil is, the better the cars performance, the better the food and liquid is that you put in your body with too make you "run" better.<br>  If you are trying to lose fat. Try to raise your metabolism by eating smaller meals, more nutritious meals, and about five or six meals throughout the day.<br>  Also, remember that if you are working out you are also building muscle, and muscle weighs more than fat does. So as you lose the fat and gain the muscle your weight might not adjust for a while until your muscle building reaches a plateau and your body begins to really tare away fat.<br>  If you do not want to eat five or six small meals a day. Eat three meals a day, smaller portions, then between breakfast and lunch have a healthy snack or meal replacement shake, and another between lunch and dinner.<br>  The idea is to teach your body to get rid of all extra fuel it doesn’t need, which are fats, carbs, and simple sugars for the most part. And once your body begins to understand that you are giving it the fuel it needs when it needs it, then your body will no longer store fat cells as a fuel reserve.<br>  It is also a good idea to use a body cleanser, or detoxify before beginning any change in diet. Especially if you are going to begin eating healthier. The process might cause head aches or muscle cramps depending on what your body has become used to. Also diarrhea is a common side effect of most cleansing programs, but don’t worry this is a sign that your body is getting rid of the toxic substances. The cleans will help your body to easily extract the nutrients it needs from the food you intake and bypass the rest as waste.<br>  To expedite the process it always helps to concentrate on full body workouts to keep energy storage empty. Also, drink water, water is used to clean your body inside and out. Stay away from caffeine and soda.<br>  This will take time. But once you are able to achieve routine with your eating habits it is one of the easiest ways to keep the fat off.<br>  So with this, your diet can be very flexible as well. You can have sweets and things but for best results I would stay away from all simple sugars, like candy.<br>  Good luck and God bless.|`|aGXankr2aa	Without your age, weight and several other details, not enough information.<br>  <br>  If you are a girl, looking to maintain her weight, you should be eating a balanced diet of about 2000 calories and exercising on a regular basis.  If your looking to lose weight safely, and remember being too underweight is as unhealthy as being overweight, aim for about 1750 calories and up the exercise a little, but remember, when you reach your goal you up your calorie intake.  That menu above is lacking in protein for starters, which your body requires.  Seek out your doctor for proper nutritional advice.<br>  <br>  If your a male, then maintaining is 2400, losing 1900-2000.|`|AA11103012	This is an extremely low calorie diet, and is not really healthy.

LirTrcZraa	You should not be removing your own earwax are you could damage your hearing. Your doctor or an audiologist is trained in serumen management and can deal w/ the problem without damaging your hearing. Typically, unless its a rediculous amount or painful, the serumen is not removed as it protects the cochlea. If you must, us a warm cloth to rinse the serumen out of your pinna (outter ear), make sure it does not get pushed into the external auditory canal. Please don't try candling or at home wax removal... It can cost you your hearing

If you are running around the bases and fielding balls.. yeap, you are going to burn calories.  If, however, you are sitting on the bench or just standing around in the outfield not going after balls it's not going to cause major weight loss. <br>  <br>  That's true of any form of exercise... go to any exercise class and you'll see some people giving it their all and burning lots of calories and others barely putting forth any effort and those people aren't going to get as much out of it.  (And I'm not talking about people making low impact modifications... I'm talking about the people who are literally just going through the motions).|`|WdGmsSrMaa	Yes!<br>  <br>  As long as you're active, you can lose weight! :)|`|ABsEvDCraa	well its a form of exercising so i dont see why not|`|WpqwaqcQaa	it will help<br>  <br>  but the only way to lose weight is eat less and burn more calories.<br>  <br>  you would need to change your entire life not just playing softball.
EKoRHgdgaa	No, you do not need to be fat to have love handles.  :o)|`|gUWcvxzuaa	LOL<br>  "Love handles" is the slang term for the loose skin or fat around a person's waist (above the pelvis) on their sides.

r2j5kf9Eaa	As you can tell from the consensus of the other answers, you should really see someone quickly, whether it's a psychiatrist or or psychologist or school counselor.  Even a priest or minister could help if you're of that ilk.  You should also talk to Desirée, even if it makes her sad.  After all that's what friends are for, and someday she'll need you and you'll be there for her.  Or try your second or third best friend....   Please resist the urge to cut yourself it will only make things worse.  Throw your blades away.  I understand how aggravating it can be when you're trapped in a situation like that, and it can seem like forever before you can get out.  I did my thesis work with kids who were in "discordant' family situations, some worse than others, and I just wanted to strangle some of those parents.  But believe me, time will pass and eventually you'll be old enough to move out and things will be better immediately.  In fact you might try asking a Y!Ahoo question to find people who have had bad family situations, and ask them how their lives changed when they turned 18.  That may provide some hope and maybe some folks you can chat with about it.  If the situation is too bad you may have to take measures to move out sooner, but please talk to someone soon.  There are some very effective medications now for depression, which you can get from a psychiatrist or family physician.  Good luck and be strong....|`|3MM64geHaa	Talk to your counselor at school or call the local crisis line.|`|7AfEG5rWaa	i hate life too.<br>  you could try anti depressants but it sounds like you have reason to be depressed and they are generally for people who are depressed for no reason. i would suggest talking to a counseler. just hold out a few more years til you can move out.|`|rAE2FZEraa	i know where your coming from [not the cutting thing] but the depression no one to talk to and family issues it all sucks but you just have to be positive there will always be something better this is just the beginning [ that sounds depressing lol ] just try and make life better for yourself!

Everyone feels bad, sometimes very bad, every once in a while. But you do care about happiness. If you didn't care you wouldn't have typed this question here.<br>  <br>  What people usually do in this situation is they have a variety of people they can go to that will really help them emotionally to fight through, but it sounds like you do not have that support group so....I say you either talk about it with your family or even a better idea is to join a sports team a club etc. <br>  <br>  I can talk to about 30-40 guys on my football team that would help pick myself up. So get involved! Just go out there. Hope this helps.|`|gdCqKl89aa	I hate to tell you this, but this is life. Without ups and downs, without people screaming at us, we never grow, we just sit stagnant with no reason to aim any higher. This is your low so you can have a high...without sadness there is no happiness, it wouldn't register.<br>  <br>  I won't kiss your @$$ and tell you to talk to some BS counselor, they are too worried about liability if you kill yourself. But really, this IS LIFE...it is like that, there is good and bad, and in between. If you can't deal now, how will you do it in the future? Boredom is most likely the problem, ppl overthink feelings when they are bored...get a hobby...go make something...go plant something....nurture a plant...just get out of the house and do something productive, it will give you more self esteem and self correct your unhappiness for now!
ew0FaElzaa	You can't ask a broad spectrum of people what YOUR dermatologist appointment is going to go like.<br>  They will treat you in a professional manner in accordance to your condition. More than likely they will look at your skin condition and determine A) the severity and B) what type of skin condition it is (there are many types of acne i.e. cystic acne. And C) What treatment options are available and proven effective for pre and currently existing patients. <br>  An appointment can take ten minutes or sometimes a half hour plus. It all depends on how busy it is and how simple or complicated your condition is. <br>  As for what they give you, it will vary usually for acne a topical cream, very rarely will they give you a pill. What they choose exactly though, as I said above depends on what your skin type is and what the conditions criteria for medication is.
eb603a32531b733c208d6a3685da0228aa	Yes, your parents will get a statement of the treatment from the insurance company.  Since they are paying for it, they have a legal right to know.  What the statement says exactly will depend on the company- but as a rule it doesn't reveal any personal type info, like why you saw the doctor.  They would also get a statement if the insurance company pays for a prescription.  Before you set your sights on an anti-depressant, though- you really should consider seeing a therapist to explore non-medication solutions first.  The stress you describe isn't really the  mediation sort, because the causes are temporary situations that can be solved otherwise.  Medication is more intended for folks with an organic problem, like chronic depression, and not the normal reactions to things you mention.  I am not dismissing the seriousness of your feelings, by any means, and hope you don't take it that way.  Since you are in college, there should be a student mental health clinic where you can get the help you need to deal with the problems you have at the moment, and find solutions other than medicine to help yourself.  You are actually more normal than you realize, and the stresses you describe are also normal.  What you need are tools to help you deal with them or to decrease their intensity- but not medication to dull you to it.  This solution would also eliminate your having to discuss matters with your parents when the statement arrived.  However, discussing it with your parents is still a good idea as well.  They do still love and care for you, and may have a few helpful options to offer you as well.  If you are going to have them pay the bill, they have a right to know what they are paying for after all.  That's only fair.  Otherwise, I would suggest trying the on campus facilities and a non-medication route to solving your problems.|`|Dy11NInPaa	A statement will be mailed from the insurance company to show that a claim has been paid to the doctor for the visit; it's usually called an Explanation of Benefits. But it would not have the details of the visit on it; like, it would not state specifically that you were placed on a prescription for an antidepressant. So, your parents would know that you went, though.That is how all of my insurance plans have worked. You could, in order to feel better about this, check on the back of your insurance card, and call. Speak with a representative.<br>  Antidepressants along with counselling can be very helpful together in handling depression, no matter what the cause of it is.<br>  Good luck, + I hope you feel better soon.

S5SvTGTZaa	Ummm... Tricky. If your cold is viral in origin and your eye infection is primary, then antibiotics can't really do anything since antibiotics are not right treatments for viruses. If your eye infection is secondary, however, it means that it is possible that it's caused by bacteria, then you can use antibiotics since antibiotics treat infection of bacterial origin.  <br>  <br>  But I am not a doctor, so see a doctor for sure, you need to pinpoint the nature of your eye infection----viral or non-viral. Also, remember, when you treat eyes you usually use drops as opposed to pills, since from what I heard is that there is a blood barrier separating the eye from the other tissues, so treatment should be directed to the eye directly.|`|leqZNLFPaa	set it on fire.

Then do all the things you couldn't do when he was "controlling your life" and breathe for the first time in probably a long time. <br>  <br>  Abusive and controlling relationships can become addictive because that person insists on being the center of your focus and your universe every minute of every day, like a screaming toddler. They are so self absorbed that there is no room in your world for anything but them! THen when they leave you there is a hallow void where they used to be. What used to fill that void?<br>  ALL your friendships they cut off from you, all the hobbies they wouldn't let you pursue, all the activities they wouldn't let you do anymore because your life had to revolve around them. <br>  <br>  Now there is a black hole there, and you have to replace that void with all the things that slowly got lost while you catered to the controllers whims. <br>  <br>  You will get better but you need a lot of therapy and a lot of work on yourself to figure out why you got sucked into that kind of relationship to begin with, or you will IMMEDIATELY get attracted to the same kind of person and do it all over again. Because the easiest way to fill that void is to stick another self absorbed controlling overgrown toddler in the void and find someone just like him to replace him. It takes serious work and dedication, and belief that YOU ARE WORTH THE EFFORT, to really break free of the cycle. <br>  If you had a very very dysfunctional childhood sometimes it makes you even more prone to falling into dysfunctional relationships. You really need to learn relationship skills like communication and boundaries that other people in more functional homes learn from modeling healthier people.   Since sometimes if you grew up in dysfunction you don't recognize it when it happens, and it feels familiar, you can misread things.<br>  <br>  Such as, a desperate needy suffocating guy can sometimes really make you feel LOVED because wow he's so into you he can't take a SHT without you that must be love. No, that's a red flag he's not normal. You need to learn to recognize it.  And a guy with a healthier outlook and healthier attitude might, out of respect, give you personal space and wait for a cue from you before demanding more. ANd you might MISUNDERSTAND that cue as abandonment. Since I grew up in dysfunction I misread things, and I've had to teach myself to not misinterpret cues the wrong way.<br>   So spend some time working on you. You need therapy, and commitment to yourself to get over him and NOT REPLACE HIM with a clone!|`|51HWwSlwaa	He's a looser and he will realize it someday when you have moved on with your life. Want to get him back? If you sit home and cry that's what he wants, why should you be crying and he's having a good time. OK, dry your eyes and call a friend or two and talk to them tonight. Tomorrow will be another day where you can look your best, don't cry and act sad he will love that. But if you act like you don't care that will really get him. GO out with your friends, have a good time even if you feel like crying DON'T!!  Let him think you have control of the situation and don't miss him, he will DIE!!  (not really) but that's not what he is expecting you to do. Always do the opposite of what they think you are going to do, That will freak him out and trust me he will be sorry and when he calls one day, who knows you just might tell him to go back to his new girlfriend. HANG IN THERE!!|`|vODnQvLiaa	when something like that happens you need to be sad and do nothing for a while. tell him you saw him cheating on you when you are ready, dont let him say sorry and get back together with you and dont hurt yourself!!!|`|Fmu1j3ruaa	the last thing you want to do is sit around watching sad movies and crying.  call up a few friends, go hang out!<br>  and another thing- learn from your experience and never let a guy control your life.  it isnt worth it.|`|QM7cAE4vaa	Firstly, don't just sit alone watching sad movies.

3pEFEmSCaa	1.  eat some complex carbohydrates, like pasta, or starches like rice/potatoes *3-4 hours before training*.<br>  <br>  2. go for regular sets / repetitions of each exercise.  Ensure each set is a manageable number with 1-2 minutes break in between each set.<br>  <br>  3. alternate muscles groups - e.g. do maybe 3 sets of press-ups (each set should consist of 20 or 30 or whatever feels right and manageable), with a break in between.  Then go to e.g. sit-ups, and do a few sets of these (again with a rest / break between each set).<br>  <br>  4.  sip a little water every now and again to prevent dehydration - but do not guzzle loads of water or you will feel rough.<br>  <br>  5.  keep 'cycling' through the different muscle groups, e.g. go back to press-ups/bicep-curls/tricep-curls after the sit-ups or whatever.<br>  <br>  as for thighs - try squat thrusts?<br>  for stomach - sit-ups and crunches<br>  <br>  hope this helps =]|`|jatsxY1Vaa	The first answer copy and pastes that onto each question, don't listen to him.

You cant forget protein, which is not only a main building block for your body but for your mind as well. I will explain.<br>  One of the worst things you can do to your body is stop eating. Your body needs fuel just like your car needs fuel. And just like your car, the better the fuel and oil is, the better the cars performance, the better the food and liquid is that you put in your body with too make you "run" better.<br>  If you are trying to lose fat. Try to raise your metabolism by eating smaller meals, more nutritious meals, and about five or six meals throughout the day.<br>  Also, remember that if you are working out you are also building muscle, and muscle weighs more than fat does. So as you lose the fat and gain the muscle your weight might not adjust for a while until your muscle building reaches a plateau and your body begins to really tare away fat.<br>  If you do not want to eat five or six small meals a day. Eat three meals a day, smaller portions, then between breakfast and lunch have a healthy snack or meal replacement shake, and another between lunch and dinner.<br>  The idea is to teach your body to get rid of all extra fuel it doesn’t need, which are fats, carbs, and simple sugars for the most part. And once your body begins to understand that you are giving it the fuel it needs when it needs it, then your body will no longer store fat cells as a fuel reserve.<br>  It is also a good idea to use a body cleanser, or detoxify before beginning any change in diet. Especially if you are going to begin eating healthier. The process might cause head aches or muscle cramps depending on what your body has become used to. Also diarrhea is a common side effect of most cleansing programs, but don’t worry this is a sign that your body is getting rid of the toxic substances. The cleans will help your body to easily extract the nutrients it needs from the food you intake and bypass the rest as waste.<br>  To expedite the process it always helps to concentrate on full body workouts to keep energy storage empty. Also, drink water, water is used to clean your body inside and out. Stay away from caffeine and soda.<br>  This will take time. But once you are able to achieve routine with your eating habits it is one of the easiest ways to keep the fat off.<br>  So with this, your diet can be very flexible as well. You can have sweets and things but for best results I would stay away from all simple sugars, like candy.<br>  Good luck and God bless.

M1BS0O5Caa	Wash your legs with soap & hot water. Pat dry with a cotton towel, and GENEROUSLY apply hydrocortisone cream (available at any drug store). There are numerous brands of hydrocortisone cream, but they are all 1%. Some have moisturizers (preferable).<br>  If the itching persists for more than a week, see your doctor. You MAY have "scabies" (which require a prescription for PERMETHRIN CREAM 5%). Scabies will NOT go away without this medication! Scabies ARE highly contagious so be cautious when coming into physical contact with others.<br>  Hope this helps-good luck in your gym class.|`|syYV8JH1aa	This will sound odd, but is a tried and true method to cover a rash.<br>  <br>  You need to go to the hardware store and get WD-40, an oil agent, and go to your pantry and get flour and peanut butter. Mix flour and peanut butter until you get the skin tone you desire, and then combine with WD-40 until it's the consistency of a paste, and spread it thinly on your rashes. They will appear to disappear, and that night, the paste will form a thin scab layer, like dried Elmer's glue, that you can peel off and your skin will appear better.<br>  <br>  This happened to me once, was really embarrassing, if I knew this method, I'd have saved myself a lot of humiliation.|`|pvNPsG4Uaa	Lubriderm is the best medication (lotion) i can possibly think of for the kind of thing. i know because im in the same predicament every morning during gym.

All I do is simply flex them, especially during work, school, bus rides, etc. I don't mean go around flexing your muscles and looking like an idiot, but you can easily flex your stomach muscles without anyone realizing. I haven't had to do many stomach exercises ever since I started doing this, and the muscles are keeping their tone. I have been doing it for a number of years, so now I flex without even realizing. It is quite beneficial for those occasions that you can't work out.

It will only last a few hours on surfaces.<br>  I did not know that you can get this on your hands??<br>  I know that if you have a severe case of this virus you can get a bluish tinge to your body -- this is because your body is not getting enough oxygen, this would be a good time to see a doctor!<br>  I would suggest that if you have something on your hands that you do not know what it is and it is a bother to you--a trip to the doctor would be in order.<br>  Good luck.|`|S5SvTGTZaa	On your hand?

A nucleocapsid was packaged inside the lipoprotein envelope. On the envelope, you would see some spikes, and these spikes include the fusion glycoprotein, the attachment glycoprotein, and small hydrophobic protein. <br>  <br>  Maisie, to answer your question of how you get it on hand, well, it's one of the ways it is transmitted, which according to my Virology lecture notes----"transmission is via inoculation of conjunctival or mucosal surfaces by hand or particle containing respiratory secretions".

8RCANzJvaa	personally i think its a little too much... 90 min a day is more than the average... ive heard its recommended about 30-45 min a day is sufficient. (shape.com says 45 min is the magic number) <br>  <br>  if you are intent on doing that much cardio, its good that atleast your spreading it out... so that... say if you have to work a half hour later and you do the full 90 min, you arent dead at work. looking again, even better now that i notice its low intensity.<br>  <br>  im currently on a workout plan, and i do cardio (bikes and the treadmill) 2-3 times a week and weight training 2-3 times a week as well. <br>  <br>  your body does need a resting period between strength training days... otherwise you just over exert yourself and you cant perform your best. try every other day, thats what my gym recommended for me.<br>  <br>  dont forget to stretch after your workouts, it will make your muscles lean looking and prevent injuries.|`|AA12041135	that's not too much.<br>  that's actually  a pretty good amount of exercise, i usually do strength training at night and go running for an hour or so about 5 days a week.<br>  hopefully you'll reach your goal.|`|kF5qDuLuaa	To answer your question... yes, it is possible to do "too much" exercise... it's called Anorexia Athletica.  I don't know that there's a set time limit for what's healthy and what's actually harmful... honestly I'm sure it's more than 1 or even 2 hours a day so your plan seems reasonable to me.  Really I think it is diagnosed more on what affect it's having on the individual... when exercising becomes an obsession it's not good... really there's not much in life that's it is healthy to become obsessed about... moderation in everything is the way to go.  A for weight loss shows... most all of them have a disclaimer that the contestants are being medically supervised.  Going from little to no exercise to multiple hours a day puts a person at risk for injuries.  When in doubt it's always best to consult your personal physican.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ccnH77SOaa	It all depends on what your body can handle and what your diet is.  Diet has a strong effect on this.  I used to work out seven days a week, three hours a day....(when I worked out those hours my body was at it's best- but I had a routine that gave me no problems.) <br>  I routine was an hour on elliptical, thirty minutes toning, fifteen on bike, fifteen on weights, finish off an hour on elliptical.<br>  <br>   but I did know my limit and if I didn't push myself to the limit.  If my body needed it's rest I gave it.<br>  <br>  Everybody is different, there is such a thing as working out too much but again you can feel that on your own.  If your muscle is sore, dont work that muscle out give it a rest.  Study foods, because there are foods out there that will rebuild your body after a workout.  I've heard from many people eating a Burger or CHILI after a workout is really good for you because it's protein will repair you.

This helps you concentrate and feel more energetic, which can sometimes be interpreted as stress relief.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't recommend it, though. Cigarettes cause serious health problems and addiction, so you'll die sooner and spend tons of money.|`|nMPo8rKRaa	no|`|c8ebe8705eaf13a28547213ca1de8013aa	You have received a wide variety of opinions regarding your question.  There are nicotine receptors in the brain.  The nicotine from smoking a cigarette reaches the brain in 15 to 30 seconds.  Unfortunately medical studies do support the notion that stimulating the nicotine receptor does reduce an individual's 'stress' - although stress is not easily defined.  There is a drug which 'blocks' the nicotine receptor called varenicline or Chantix.  The Food and Drug Administration has issued an advisory that varenicline may have adverse central nervous system side effects some of which may be quite serious.  This has posed a problem for physicians as varenicline is the first drug that actually helps with smoking cessation.  Bear in mind that cigarette smoking is the number 1 preventable cause of missed time from school or work, disability, and death in the US.  Indeed upwards of 500,000 deaths per year are related to cigarette smoking.  To put this in perspective during the 20th century the US lost about 500,000 men an all of the armed conflicts we fought.  In a sense cigarette smoking is 100 times as lethal as war.  Therefore many physicians feel that the benefits of varenicline - specifically smoking cessation - outweight the risks of the drug.  I myself am very cautious in prescribing it.  Cigarettes smoking is associated with an increased incidence of both anxiety and depression.  I often approach a smoker by determining whether one or both may be present and then I treat either or both disorders.  This aids in smoking cessation and eliminates the need to smoke to relieve stress.  I wish you the very best of health.

It's a small price to pay. <br>  <br>  Don't be scared or anxious, you'll be fine.|`|oP8krEBiaa	heyyy, okay, so dont worry. trust me if you do then you will look back at yourself in a month and feel so embarassed lol. I am not going to lie, my first week was painful.It is different for everybody, but i mean hey c'mon you  have to expect it theyre basically moving your jaw/ teeth. Try not to eat hard and sticky foods, especially when you get them tightened. You will get useed to them really quickly too , i kinda have fun with them, in gym class i just hide my gum on the top of my braces, lol. St stop panicking, it wont hurt a bit when they put them on, oh and btw all they do is just glue the brackets on, put the wire through, then put the rubber bands on to hold the wire, and tighten the wire.Make sure you have some  advil at home, you might need it, oh and lots of yogurts, soups, and mashed potatoes. lol, REMEMBER: no hard foods (the first week)<br>  <br>  So any other questions feel free to e-mail me.|`|AA10841164	I have braces got them yesterday. They just put these things in your mouth to make it wider you'll look really funny then the doc. comes in and starts putting on the glue for the brackets to stick. I thought he was just looking at my teeth when he was putting on the brackets but what happens is after the brackets is the bands they are wire and they might burn it but it DOES NOT BURN YOU! Then you can choose you colors to put on it is really easy then your mouth will be sore. It hurts worse the next day so this is day 2 for me you would want to eat soup and try to use your teeth as little as possible. Oh and you HAVE to clean your teeth EVERY day after EACH AND EVERY meal. It is a big responsibility so hope you like having braces sort of.|`|nl0qQdRyaa	About the pain, it depends on your sensitivity. Some people are sore for several weeks, some expirience no pain at all, though most peopel are sore for about a week. Just take a bunch of advil and the pain will be manageable. <br>  <br>  Your orthodontist should also give you a list of unpermitted foods, but just stay away from sticky things. Although in my experience the orthodontists exaggerate on the food. My list says no bagels, but I've eaten caramel and all sorts of things, without breaking my braces. Just be careful. There not that bad don't worry.|`|15ErhPmMaa	1. Getting them on doesn't really hurt.<br>  2. After you get them on, it will KILL trying to eat.  (theres a lot of pain)<br>  3. After awhile, you forget you have them.|`|1ynYuF2Jaa	it doesnt really  hurt, your mouth might be sore for a few days,but i got braces in the summer and they diddnt bother me, dont listen to everybody who tells tou its horrible its not|`|Xf1hcWGPaa	Hey, I've had braces for 6 months now and they are perfectly straight apart from one tooth on my bottom teeth (but its practically straight just not perfectly yet) and my gaps are closing where i had the extractions they are like | | that far apart.<br>  anyway, Firstly they put this clear thing on your lips to open your mouth really wide so the orthodontist can get a proper look and stuff then she gives you a sucker thing to suck the saliva and water out of your mouth. she cleans your teeth with the stuff thats very sour (that was one of the worst parts) and gets the water to wash it off. then she puts the glue on the teeth and attaches the brackets but only like 3 teeth at a time and she uses this lazer thing to set the glue and once all the brackets are on she puts the wire on you will feel some discomfort as the wire will be too big for your mouth. but they chop the excess off. it depends on what type of braces you have but they will either put on rubber bands to secure the wire or ur brackets will have clips on them.    since having my braces I've felt no pain, i've been very lucky. the most painful thing so far was the powerchain. and you get alot of cuts because the brackets are sharp but you soon get used to it. hope this helps and good luck

Best thing you can do is tell your Mom so she can get you pads and answer your questions.<br>  <br>  It is not unusual for girl's periods to be very irregular for the first couple of years.  They can be just some brown spotting or last for 3-10 days depending on the person.  Some girls even miss a few months until their hormones develop.  When you get regular, your period will start anywhere from 25-35 days apart and all are normal, but most are usually about 28 days.<br>  <br>  welcome to womanhood..|`|dALX1qQdaa	spotting|`|tvTPYSTVaa	HOW OLD ARE  YOU?

cCXGEZxaaa	Possibly more judgmental than the rest of us, they spend their days listening to people pour out their problems. It is completely unrealistic of us to not expect them not to think about rolling their eyes at some of the superficial things we say. <br>  And yes I do go to therapy for 'legit' reasons, but I do also talk about the idiocies of my life I know a middle age man does not care about.|`|WcSXO5vhaa	I believe that they make judgments but are able to remain professional such as their job requires. They're human, and like any human they're bound to make their own judgments about what they're hearing and processing. They're just not going to be open about it because of their job.|`|lzDalUfaaa	of course!!!<br>  when they see a 600 pound man walk in they for sure think: what a loser<br>  <br>  But they hide it b/c its their JOB|`|3SqtWtaxaa	No I think they are professionals that provide help to the lost sole.|`|gkqmrIAGaa	Not therapist are trained to not be judgemental. If a therapist makes the judgement that he/she can't help you or doesn't feel comfortable with you they will recommend another one for you. The same as your choice in therapists. You have to feel a bond with a therapist who makes you feel comfortable. If you don't have that your therapy won't work.|`|FtVRYkI4aa	I guess that if they see that you need to change something, they will let you know that you since that is what they are doing, helping you with whatever concerns you may have, etc.|`|upvLAyyzaa	Yes, I do believe that.  I think everyone is a little judgmental, but therapists have been trained to not let that reflect in their work with people because obviously if a therapist said he was judgmental, no one would go to that therapist because they may have sensitive and delicate issues they need to deal with and they fear being judged.  So of course any therapist is going to say they are not judgmental.|`|2jMFurDoaa	well being human im sure they are judgemental.<br>  but they are professional so they keep the thoughts to themselves because they know judging what the patient does wont help.<br>  <br>  its only natural for them to think something the patient does is strange.|`|AA10529146	I think some are, but not all.

YDykVkcmaa	All the 'supplements' and 'boosters' are just vitamin/mineral supplements that make sure you get you daily dose of these to help your body work as best as it can to make its own testosterone. Some of them also contain plant extracts that they will claim will help your body manufacture more testosterone - which is just more marketing hype to get your money.<br>  <br>  If you want any of these types of products go to your pharmacy and buy a good vitamin/mineral supplement for 1/10th the price.<br>  <br>  Also be aware that there are no foods that contain testosterone that is usable by the human body or any other chemicals that the body can use to directly convert into testosterone.<br>  <br>  Also please be aware that there are NO natural sources of testosterone that the human body can use.<br>  <br>  The best way to boost testosterone naturally is:<br>  <br>  1/ Eat a well balanced diet high in zinc (zinc is vital in the bodies production of testosterone, it also helps stop testosterone being converted into estradiol (female hormone) and also help convert any estradiol you may have into testosterone.<br>  <br>  These sites will highlight some good sources:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/zinc.as..." rel="nofollow">http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/zinc.as...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.naturalhealthtechniques.com/D..." rel="nofollow">http://www.naturalhealthtechniques.com/D...</a><br>  <br>  2/ Stop smoking and drinking. Alcohol is a real t-killer and<br>  <br>  3/ Undertake a regular gentle exercise regime. Excess exercise will also kill testosterone.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you want to build muscles then you need to eat whey protein (your body needs protein to actually build the muscles) and exercise. Nothing will build muscles for you without exercise.<br>  <br>  If you need testosterone replacement therapy then you need real bio-identical testosterone not any of these boosters and stuff.<br>  <br>  Don't start any testosterone program without seeking advice from a doctor. It can be dangerous if you don't know what you are doing or if you have any medical conditions that could cause bad interactions.

Its your confidentiality and your right that they break doing otherwise. Explain to the doctor and have an examination done, they will probably do a blood test to verify if you have this or not.

Then cancer returns, and sometimes there is no more fight left in them, that is how hard chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation is on the body.<br>  <br>  People choose not to have chemotherapy and live the remaining part of their lives without the poison.  <br>  <br>  Cancer is fear, the worst thing that can happen is to die from it.  Many great people have, and it is sad but many more will.  Stage four cancer is worst.  In some parts of the body it could be more deadly than other parts.  <br>  <br>  I believe that death actually sets free the soul of the person that dies of cancer and when they pass on they are now free of all life's aches and pains.  They are totally in peace and in the presence of God's love.  We the ones left behind are the ones that are crying, not them, instead they are blissfully in peace and free at last.  <br>  <br>  So, if the worst kind of cancer results in death, and death actually frees the spirit from cancer's hold and all of it's pain, is it really the worst kind of cancer there is; or, does it only get us to God faster?|`|IBJHXCJPaa	Melanoma (skin cancer)<br>  <br>  They all suck.|`|NFyQWFoGaa	Esophageal is tough.|`|ECLYzIXZaa	They are all bad.|`|zwvDITr5aa	pancreatic, guaranteed death sentence with a lot of suffering

Certain things, like porn, can heighten arousal, making it easier to orgasm. But if when you masturbate you're just doing it because you happen to have a hard on, it'll probably take longer unless you are thinking about something really arousing. And of course men tend to find it easier to ejaculate during actual sex as appose to masturbation.|`|LYeMqJIRaa	It all depends on your level of arousal.

Keep up the physical activity, that will stimulate your body, and try to avoid red meat because of the excess hormones and antibiotics they feed the cows.

Unfortunately, there is no magic formula when it comes to quick weight loss.  <br>  <br>  Try eating a healthy, balanced low fat diet with plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables.  Eat lean meats only, low fat dairy products,skimmed milk, sugar free beverages, eggs, and non sugary cereals.<br>  <br>  Try to include more wholefoods into your diet.  Such as brown bread, brown rice, brown pasta, beans & pulses.  These are high in Fibre and will keep you feeling fuller for longer.<br>  <br>  KEEP al junk foods, ready made meals, alcohol, sugary fizzy drinks, and takeaway meals to an absolute minimum.  These are high in saturated fat and full of sugar.  The two main ingredients which will add on those extra pounds.<br>  <br>  Junk food is just what it says - JUNK.  With one added ingredient in - FAT.<br>  <br>  Although, exercise is beneficial regardless of your diet.  However, 80% of your physique is a result of what you eat.  20% is exercise.<br>  <br>  The more exercise you do. The more calories you will burn.

It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 What’s so funny about bovines? If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?

AA11727191	Do you mean an Oral Glucose Tolerance test? If so you will fast for...12 hours I think. And then go in. They will give you a very sugary drink to drink. Then they will take your blood sugar a few times over 2 hours. If you go over 200 at any time you are diabetic. If its between 140-199 you are prediabetic. Good Luck!|`|c8ebe8705eaf13a28547213ca1de8013aa	The glucose tolerance test is utilized to assist in determining whether a person has diabetes or not.  The popularity of glucose tolerance tests has waxed and waned over the past 40 years.  In 1980 for example, they were generally thought to more confusing than helpful.  In addition they are seldom performed correctly.  Nonetheless as the incidence of diabetes has been rising in the US the glucose tolerance test has become increasingly popular.  In my 30 years in medical practice I have never done a glucose tolerance test.  Diabetes is easy to diagnose and the glucose tolerance still leads to more confusion.  It often labels people as being 'glucose intolerant' which is an improper term - just as 'pre-diabetic' and 'borderline diabetic' should not be used.  For the GTT you are given a fixed amount of glucose to consume.  Your glucose is then tested every hour or every 2 hours.  There is a great deal of disagreement as to how to interpret the results.  Personally I believe that physicians who perform glucose tolerance testing may have missed the point about the pathophysiology of diabetes.  Damage precedes an elevation in glucose by a decade or more.  Thus 'glucose intolerance' is actually a case of early diabetes which requires prompt intervention as considerable damage has already been done.  I wish you the very best of health.|`|SG88qduLaa	A glucose tolerance test in medical practice is the administration of glucose to determine how quickly it is cleared from the blood. The test is usually used to test for diabetes, insulin resistance, and sometimes reactive hypoglycemia. The glucose is most often given orally so the common test is technically an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). <br>  The patient should have been fasting for the previous 8-14 hours (water is allowed).<br>  The patient is then given a glucose solution to drink & .It should be drunk within 5 minutes<br>  Blood is drawn at intervals for measurement of glucose (blood sugar), and sometimes insulin levels.<br>  the most important sample is the 2 hour sample and the 0 and 2 hour samples may be the only ones collected<br>  Interpretation of oral Glucose Tolerance Test:<br>  1 _Fasting plasma glucose should be below  (110 mg/dl) If from (110 to 126mg /dl) it is called border line("impaired fasting glycaemia"), and fasting levels repeatedly at or above (126 mg/dl) are diagnostic of diabetes.<br>  2 _The 2 hour glucose level should be below (140 mg/dl). Levels between this and  (200 mg/dl) indicate "impaired glucose tolerance." Glucose levels above  (200 mg/dl) at 2 hours confirms a diagnosis of diabetes.

pnE7nlQqaa	yes oral cancer is very real and even if you do not inhale anything at all from the filter you will still need to breath so therefore you will be susceptible to 2cd hand smoke at the least.|`|AuM57Q7Aaa	Why wouldn't you inhale? <br>  <br>  <br>  You can still get mouth cancer, ya turd. haha ;] :]|`|oTHGgowsaa	You bet, they can cause cancer of the mouth and gum disease, that's the grossest picture that comes on the smoke pack in my opinion, is the one with the gnarled up mouth.|`|fnMlgExbaa	of course!<br>  you can get mouth cancer. no matter what form of tobacco you use, it damages you in the same way just maybe in different parts of your body.<br>  <br>  keep in mind second hand smoke and THIRD hand smoke can do some nasty damage too.|`|UpvzJGAYaa	Yes, your teeth will still rot & turn yellow, still get bad breath, smoke still sneaks it's way into your lungs, mouth cancer.

They're awfully dangerous to your health either way!!!!|`|hbUaDewPaa	whether you inhale or not there are all kinds of ill effects caused by smoking. why do you smoke at all? waste of money if you ask me, and if you are not addicted .... <br>  QUIT the f`n things while you still can, save the money for more beer|`|DQkDQraOaa	You can still get mouth cancer.|`|IF9MAgjAaa	Sandy is right, but you're not smoking if you don't inhale. <br>  But you can still get mouth cancer.|`|u15hauUCaa	You can get cancer in your mouth, tongue, gums, rotten teeth, etc.|`|l84XYm0yaa	They hurt you no matter what. No matter if its gum disease or a hole in your throat.|`|IYGLvxxjaa	yes.|`|hYP6akCYaa	yes|`|Bsimt0Dgaa	Okay, no lies here....<br>  <br>  Yes it can and will harm you.  Have you ever heard of second hand smoke?  Just because it's you doing the puffing, does not eliminate you from inhaling the smoke in the air around you.<br>  <br>  You are also opening up the possibility for lip and gum cancer.<br>  <br>  Try not to smoke.  I started when I was 16.  I'm much older now and I can not quit.<br>  <br>  Quit while you're ahead.  Do not let it fool you.  It is very addictive.  You may say that you don't have a problem with it right now, that you don't inhale and you can stop whenever you want, but that's exactly the way almost everyone starts.<br>  <br>  Think about that for a while.<br>  <br>  Hope you make the right decision.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|nrVy8hNnaa	if the carcinogens enter your mouth and not your lungs, you will eventually get cancer in your mouth and not lungs. Smoking also causes stomach cancer, so I would guess you're still going to be at risk anyways. so if you insist on smoking, you may as well inhale<br>  <br>  ... and I would never lie to get you stop smoking, I don't care enough|`|baJvx6WZaa	yes because they damage the inside of ur mouth and will be hard to breath. my dad used to smoke and the way he quit after 8 months is by going on a nice long run.  he couldn't do it because of the smoking but he had to quit.  he knew that sometime in his life he would need his body to do something such as ride a bike for example.  now that im 12 and hes is 35 (he started to smoke around 22 ish) we go on bikerides all the time and he is fine. if i were you, i would stop smoking and if you can't, go on that nice long run.  please man|`|vUNxsB2zaa	Yes, it can still harm you. The tobacco and other (over 2,000 cancer causing chemicals) in one drag can still pollute your mouth with potential problems.. Your teeth, gums, mouth, and throat are still at risk all that is really 'safer' about it is less seeps into your lungs.. but it's still bad.|`|zGQt7sAOaa	not as much but they can turn your teeth yellow. if you smoke just for the taste then i dont know how to help you, but if you smoke just because its cool or whatever then you shouldnt do it at all. smoking can make you feel good but its not worth what it can do to your body.|`|aa3f145fa32f9e32f89879e9f9f46792aa	Yes it is harmful, Second Hand smoke is just as much a killer as First Hand. Just because you aren't inhaling directly doesn't mean you aren't exposing yourself to Second Hand smoke.|`|tWgGLVxXaa	No doubt about it.<br>  Just because you aren't inhaling, it doesn't mean none of the toxins are entering your body.|`|EDbnHmhdaa	Yes, but its a bit pointless if you arent going to inhale ..  thats the point of smoking|`|aDZyh2jzaa	Yes they can. because you always inhale a bit.|`|akvrwpywaa	Yes.|`|do4c3O3paa	not as bad as inhaling, but can lead<br>    to gum disease
2wMMAKpOaa	Burning while peeing can be caused by a number of things. If you're a virgin then the chances are that it's probably a yeast infection, BV, or a UTI. These are all very treatable just go to a doctor. If you are sexually active then it may be an STD such as chlamydia or gonorrhea. Either way get it checked out. Hope this helped :)|`|lYQDCJgeaa	See a doctor!|`|l7GjBVvhaa	A urinary tract infection or bladder infection... <br>  <br>  <br>  Consult your primary.<br>  <br>  <br>  Be seeing you....|`|eQthqZKwaa	You probably have a bladder infection (aka: UTI - urinary tract infection) Whatever you do, dont wait to go to the dr. Contrary to popular belief, you cannot cure a bladder infection simply by drinking a lot of water or cranberry juice. You need antibiotics. Once you get them, go to the women's isle in the grocery store and get some Uristat (over the counter pain relief for bladder infections) Take that for a couple of days and then lay off to see how your infection is coming along. You should feel 100% in 2-3 days if you are on the right antibiotics. PS: Uristat is not a cure, only masks your symptoms so you can sleep at night, function during the day...that's if you have a bladder infection that hurts really bad.<br>  <br>  Bottom line, only your dr will be able to tell you if its a bladder infection, only he will be able to prescribe the meds you need. Dont wait too long to see a dr. If the pain gets so bad that your back begins to hurt like someone punched you, you throw up, and/or you have a fever, then that means you waited WAY too long and it turned into a kidney infection.|`|iQaKNSI6aa	You might have a disease and I highly recommend that you go to see a doctor. This may be a big problem, or not, but it's best to be safe because your not gonna find out exactly what you have on yahoo answers, or at least you won't know for sure. But, if I had to guess, I would say it's urinary tract infection.|`|kvCa4xCmaa	urinary tract infection. drink like two bottles of 100% cranberry juice.. works every time for me :) sorry about your pain i know it sucks! good luck.... <br>  <br>  one time i took antibiotics and it almost seems like it took longer to clear up then when i just drink cranberry juice.|`|c5WFme5Jaa	Most likely a water infection which is nothing to worry about but really hurts ! Drink lots of water stay away from tea and coffee and go see a doctor to get some medicine, but it can clear away by itself over time.|`|AA11121472	You are  most likely having bladder spasms and could also have a bladder infection. You need to go to your doctor and he will check your urine for infection.  .|`|Q4N1ZOQcaa	Possible urinary tract infection. STD? A urine test would help. Drink alot of water.
H01MwmkVaa	It's an individual thing.  When is the time of day that you are the most alert and energetic.  That's the time for you to work out.  I work out late at night and that works for me.|`|ugsfuQQcaa	It varies from person to person, but most experts think the morning is best because you get the energy going and it gets you revved for the rest of the day.  If you work out in the evening, if can actually make you more awake and it might be harder to get to sleep at night.|`|wdNfee9Baa	There is no best time to work out because no matter the time of day you will still burn the same amount of calories.  I.e. you can run for 30 mins in the morning or at night and it will do the same thing.   From a personal standpoint work out for what time is better for you.  Some people enjoy the morning because it jump starts the day however many enjoy going after work to let the stressful day out.   Whatever you choose make sure it fits your lifestyle :)  As a personal trainer I would suggest working out in the afternoon if you have a lot to do in the morning as you do not want to skip parts of your work out or cut corners because you are running late.  If you do not have a hectic morning schedule by all means go then (the gym will be less busy if your working out there).  Again no matter what time as long as you go your body will benefit from either time of day work out.|`|46otjIowaa	either, as long you stick to your schedule|`|0abc7b6c3865e21018ce64c64d0ea018aa	at night|`|ULLRoTsVaa	I have read that it is better to work out in the midday-afternoon.. they said that doing it in the morning is a good stimulant but to see a difference in weight you need to burn excess, so I guess the later part of the day is better so you can burn off that lunch/dinner and it won't sit in your belly all night.|`|fIEmi84Laa	The morning. I don't know why, but it energizes you and it help control appetite too.|`|QrSFskUpaa	early in the morning|`|fde58a4004c1e1d57eb4cf4ee32bdb21aa	early morning.

If there is a lot of vomiting or diarrhea ,Checking between bouts. Our immune system is compromised  by the diabetes so it can be a little easier to get sick.

I would think it might make it worse.|`|ICLekd2Vaa	i think its from the lower oxygen level in the blood from not breathing right.|`|EuUQuFnoaa	Total guess but I agree with what Waffles said.

And that could also be keeping him awake at night.|`|Mzu9bHbmaa	Having allergies to another person is an urban legend. The TV series House MD had an episode about this. It's basically impossible. There are a few disease that can seem like allergies to someone else, but they are extremely rare.     Anyways, stress can cause all of the symptoms that you described. I recommend that your husband and your sister sit down and talk about their issues. This won't go away  until they work this out. You might want to consider counseling if you can't work this out.

mrPkIUazaa	This may be too much of a personal question but are you sexually active? I tried to use them when I was not and it hurt. Now that I'm older and active they are easier for me to use. I'm not saying to go out there and have sex if you are not already but maybe you should just stick to pads.     Or just keep practicing. Make sure you're squatting. Maybe once your vagina gets used to it, then the process will be a lot easier.|`|UcgWrGaAaa	You may need to push it up there higher.  There are muscles at the opening that will make a tampon not feel right and you have to get it past those muscles by putting the applicator in just about as far as it will go.  Hope that helps.|`|114a9e7f24177ba552a0e5c76a745e27aa	relax your muscles(easier said than done) put on foot up on the closed toilet lid or a step stool(this helps) and be sure to use the thinnest tampon possible. you might have to insert it at an angle. Not all vaginas are straight. insertion and removal will not hurt when you do it properly. it takes some practice so don't be upset. also if you are only bleeding lightly it can be uncomfortable to use one.|`|fde58a4004c1e1d57eb4cf4ee32bdb21aa	well it is going to hurt.period. but if taking it out hurts its because its still dry.|`|mWBD1Mgyaa	If you are a virgin - the Hymen could be stopping the tampon from going in completely.  Pulling out a dry tampon always hurts...  Try to relax - if you are tense at all, it will make it harder to put in.  Aim the tampon towards your back...don't put it straight up.  You can try lying down, put one leg up...  You'll figure out what works best for you.|`|e138b4efa4524e74d6719f0ebf966a81aa	well normlay its cus its dry thats why it hurts   try other brands of tampons i love tampon pearls tent to work better an not hurt if u try to take it out and it dont come dont force it use a shower head that is movable and hit some water at yoru va jaja  to lost en it up|`|SslUWT0Jaa	ok, yes it was stupid of you to pull the tampon out while it was still dry, you should of poured some water on it, then it wouldn't of hurt.  if you put the tampon striaght in you may of hit that ball like thing in you, sometimes its more tender during your period, sometimes not.  Try putting the tampon more off to the side maybe, and if you get really good at it you can fit on on each side, which is really good when your really heavey.  Or if you want to totally make sure your not going to leak.|`|apzX48W4aa	It was really hard for me to get it right too. I was scared to try it for a while.

LeaUjOoUaa	The idea that diabetic men will suffer a low sperm count as a result is a myth. An issue that could affect him is not sperm count but potency. One of the affects of diabetes is that the smaller blood vessels can burst or be damaged. Blood flow to areas fed by these blood vessels can be compromised. This is why some diabetics over time can suffer from eye problems, as the blood vessels to the retina are affected. In much the same way, the blood supply to the private regions of your husbands body can be affected and the ability to maintain arousal can become an issue. It does not necessarily have to happen, but it can. If this does occur, there is that wonderful blue pill to help. Many mistakenly think Viagra and other similar medication is supposed to turn the guy on but it actually opens up the blood vessels so that good blood supply can get where it needs to get to make certain things happen. If your husband begins to suffer from ED (erectile dysfunction) have him talk to his doctor about it and you should still be able to keep trying.|`|J2bLQcHNaa	Probably Not.|`|945gMsSZaa	Unfortunately there is evidence to suggest that men with diabetes have difficulty conceiving a child as there is more damage to the DNA of the sperm.

When you have a major condition, everything seems to stem from it.  However, this is not an epilepsy issue, or even a driving issue.  It's an issue with your family, and an issue with you.    First, you need to communicate with your family or how they are making you feel.  They may not even realize what they are doing to you. Perhaps an open dialogue with them will help both sides come to a realization.      Second, you don't need a car to leave the house, so do so.  Since you must at least be sixteen, you're old enough to work.  See if you can find some type of work within walking distance.  Some employers even offer free carpooling aide to get to work.  Also, I'm sure you have friends.  See if they can take you out a little more regularly.

xfpJGBfwaa	That sounds pretty normal for a 16 year old.  When I was 16, the way I calmed down was one of two ways:    1. I listened to music with my eyes closed in my room.    2.  I cried.  Actually I'd make myself cry because i knew it would calm me down.      The way to get over this is to keep practicing making eye contact and saying nice things to people.  Work on "Hello, how are you?"  with eye contact, and maintaining eye contact while they answer, and while you answer when they ask you "How are you?"  in return.   Keep doing it.      Don't worry about how it looks.  Just keep it up.  Eventually you might explain it one day  "I was shy and I hope you don't mind my practicing on you."  But there is no need to hurry.

Don't use lip balm with Petroleum in it, as it makes it worse.

Try different lip stuff until you find one that helps.  Regular wax-y chapstick isn't usually very helpful.|`|yazZH4khaa	I, at least in the winter, always have chapped lips.

Good Luck and feel better!!!!!

65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	Walk up and slap him in the face with it.  When he slaps you back, carefully note everything you see.    On a serious note:  You've said that from what he says you're about the same.  This means 1 of 2 things:     1.  He's lying, and you're bigger.  2.  He's truthful, and you're the same size.    Either result seems very acceptable.  If it is case 1, that means you've got the biggest one in your class.  If it is case 2, then you're tied with him.  Neither one will require you to compare penises, meaning neither one will require you to find some clever way to do so.    Also, there's always the option of walking in on him when he gets out of the shower at a sleep-over.    EDIT:  I SUPPOSE Jerome's answer would work as well.  But where's the fun in that?  Nobody gets walked in on.  Nobody gets slapped in the face.  BORING.    EDIT:  Crewe_Drunk, I'm glad I'm not the only one who thinks a penis slap to the face is funny!    And to our asker:  You'd only be gay if you wanted to see it just because you like the looks of a penis.  Which you don't.  Perhaps you could get him to whip it out under the premise of "in the interest of science"?  Also, I'm glad someone enjoys my humor.    StudAZ - the only one he's got?

Usually guys put something porn on their computer, or watch the late tv channel, etc. and start to talk about sex, t*ts, girls, etc and get hard, then ask him if he minds if you get comfortable, and if he says yes, then you can either start to w*nk under the sheets/sleeping bag or whatever you have, and see if he follows suit...

PCsW0gbPaa	I have had this exact same experience with Zoloft.  But when I went up to 100mg I started getting really sweaty and had to back off of it anyway.  My doctor told me that sometimes the depression goes away for a while right when you get on the medication because of the psychological reason that you fell like you are doing something about it.  But the bottom line is that maybe the medication just isn't working as well as it should.  The doctor ended up adding a different med (Wellbutrin) to a lower dose (50mg) of Zoloft.  I still don't think that the medication is totally curing me, but I didn't get the immediate backsliding like I did when I was just on the Zoloft.|`|AA10772154	Do not under any circumstances increase dosage without your doctor first being notified !

ydow56Ekaa	I have lost several pounds in the last couple weeks by combining a healthy diet with exercise 3 times per week and Acai.    Acai is an awesome health food, in fact you will probably feel the difference in your body within a week of taking a daily acai supplement. So, why is it so good?    Acai berries have far more antioxidants than any other fruit. Even more than blueberries! Besides that, the nutrients in acai berry supplements help many other diseases and maladies, from diabetes to arthritis to blood clotting. It really is a worthwhile supplement to add to your daily nutrition.    Acai can also be a great weight loss aid. The berrys natural concoction of essential fatty acids, fiber, phytosterols and amino acids work together to help your body burn fat more efficiently, process food more quickly and shed the unwanted pounds that youd like to lose.    The fatty acids and amino acids aid in both muscle development and proper digestion, both of which are essential to fat loss. The fiber helps your body to move food out of your system quicker and also to help you feel full, as do fatty acids. Phytosterols help fortify your digestive tract, moving waste materials out and absorbing nutrients more efficiently.    Acai has great anti-aging benefits, will cleanse and detoxify you, and has destroyed cancer cells in recent studies. You really can't go wrong by adding an acai supplement to your daily vitamin regimen. So far it's working for me by helping my digestion, curbing my appetite, and by giving me more energy each day... I don't even get sleepy around 3pm anymore.    My friend at work showed me this website where she ordered her Acai berry from. It's a great deal and there is even a free trial offer, check it out!    http://www.news-pulse.com|`|VUfT35UQaa	see your doctor about a healthy eating p;an, 5 a day and lots of water.    good luck|`|6MwIvHlNaa	Aerobic exercise like running, cycling, swimming, aerobics classes are the best way to lose weight.  If your fitness is really poor start off with long brisk walks first.    As for diet, google 'healthy diet' and there are 1000s of government and charity backed articles.  Don't follow a crazy celebrity diet, just change to a healthy diet and the weight will gradually drop off naturally at 1 - 2lbs per week.

XKLNoo2Eaa	Treatment for BDD likely will include a combination of the following therapies:    Psychotherapy: This is a type of individual counseling that focuses on changing the thinking (cognitive therapy) and behavior (behavioral therapy) of a person with body dysmorphic disorder. The goal is to correct the false belief about the defect and to minimize the compulsive behavior.     Medication: Certain antidepressant medications called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are showing promise in treating body dysmorphic disorder.     Group and/or family therapy: Family support is very important to treatment success. It is important that family members understand body dysmorphic disorder and learn to recognize its signs and symptoms.     ___________________________    What Is the Outlook for People With BDD?  The outlook is promising for people with BDD who receive and follow treatment. In addition, those with a strong support team tend to do better in the long run.    Can BDD Be Prevented?  There is no known way to prevent BDD. However, it might be helpful to begin treatment in people as soon as they begin to have symptoms. Teaching and encouraging healthy and realistic attitudes about body image also might help prevent the development or worsening of BDD. Finally, providing the person with an understanding and supporting environment might help decrease the severity of the symptoms and help him or her better cope with the disorder.|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	therapy is the key to BDD, not meds.

I decided that it wasn't a good idea to start a relationship, as I felt she needed time for herself.    She was very insecure, and had very little trust in guys.    Some guys notice those insecurities, and take advantage of it to really squeeze out any self esteem that you have left, and pretty much control your life. That's what had happened in her case.    You definitely are vulnerable, and I suggest you stop dating for a while, and really start focusing on rebuilding your self esteem and learn to love yourself.|`|fWbuYL08aa	u may not be vulnerable,  but you are very insecure..  plzz open up and have some fun gal!|`|YlLdIPRvaa	Sounds like you're dealing with some major insecurity issues.  You may be vulnerable or attract a certain kind of guy for this reason.  Perhaps you should take a break from dating to focus on yourself and restoring your spirit.  I would recommend talking to someone about it as well.  You can't expect a great guy to love you if you don't love yourself.  And you DO deserve a great guy.|`|CYzTJIhVaa	It sounds like your own insecurities are keeping you from attracting the right guy for you.  I have just gone through this myself so I can sympathize with you.  However, you are going to have to change your self-image before you can attract guys who are going to treat you the way you feel you deserve.  What you think of yourself is radiated to others and so "players" pick up on these things and prey on you and "good guys" pick up on it and run as fast as they can in the other direction.  A good man wants a confident woman.  Even the "ugliest" woman can get a man if she believes in herself.  Look up Christian Carter on Google.  He has a lot of e-books on dealing with men.  It may cost you a little but it will be worth the small investment.  Also, in regards to your self-image, honey you are going to have to develop some self-esteem.  It is not easy though, trust me i know.  It won't happen overnight but every step you take towards it, will make it that much easier.  I hope this was helpful to you.|`|NsVMneVcaa	I wouldn't say you were vulnerable Emma. It sounds like you lack self confidence though, and you have no self esteem or self worth.

aMQD2UnWaa	My son is just going off of it.  One side effect for him was that it caused him to NOT have much of an appetite. That's it.  Why don't you google it or go to webmd.com and get more information.  Remember that side effects listed don't mean that they will happen.  When they are researching a new drug and it is in the trials any symptom that is reported by a person involved with the trial has to be reported. So lets say I was one of those people and while taking the drug I started vomiting from the flu, they would have to list it as a possible side effect even if it didn't have anything to do with the medicine.  Try not to worry, but it is very, very good that you are questioning it.  Good job!

The side effects are you will be pretty tired the first 3-4 days when you get up in the morning but make sure you stick to a schedule and it will be fine in about 3 days. I was told that I would be hungry more but I haven't had that so far. Also I get light headed during the day here and there. It also depends on what your dose is. The good news is that the side effects seem to go away after about 3 days.|`|WXExyAlWaa	I take 100mg every evening. When I first got it the pharmacist told me to be careful because it makes you drowsy, but that's why it's prescribed to me. :P It's basically a mild sedative, it won't straight out put you to sleep like zopiclone or something, but it does make it easier to sleep. And never drink alcohol with it.

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|wdNfee9Baa	Fast pace cardio and lots of water!! within a week if you do cardio everyday for 60 mins and drinks lots of water you will lose weight.

qg11igznaa	Probably just growing pains and puberty. You're 13, so that seems most likely to me. Of course a lot of exercise will cause this kind of pain if you don't stretch  before and after.
QQMQ4u70aa	that is normal. i see it all the time. even though your foot doesnt hurt, DO NOT put your full weight on it or even walk on it if your doc has not told you its safe to. it is still healing and putting your weight on it could re-break it or delay the healing process.|`|0LUBf2Juaa	I broke my ankle about 10 years ago and it didn't hurt me from start to end. It used to occasionally ache after having the plaster removed and I get the odd twinge now and again, but I can't honestly say that I was ever in pain.|`|c67a2f77ab7471bed4b2f279ff05e2e1aa	the broken pieces of bone must be properly aligned.  they hurt a lot more when out of place|`|0w1f6Dh1aa	After the first few days the pain lessens (or goes away altogether) because the cast is keeping it supported and in place. I broke my wrist a few years back and thought it had quit hurting until I had the cast replaced for the first time. The doctor cut my cast off and I was astounded at how much it hurt without the support! Couldn't wait to get another cast on.    I didn't take painkillers, either. Didn't feel like I needed them.
RvddYKqjaa	Rather than worry, have an eye doctor check it out.|`|rE9J1DqTaa	You probably popped a blood vessel in your eye. I know plenty of people who has had this happen. I suggest you call a doctor and let them know what happen
cq11zfBWaa	Finish the antibiotics, try and get some hardcore painkillers (Legally, of course) and finally, check in with your dentist or GP every week at least.    The pain will ease and the tissue should stop swelling.|`|NAbioaNmaa	stay on the antibiotics|`|ZIJvBQAMaa	Sorry! I dont know what that is. Sounds like you should call him agian and so no IT REALLY REALLY REALLY HURTS then hold your tounge and say APPLE|`|wPD3BGEHaa	Well an abscess is an infection of the tooth, usually there is no way to save a tooth once it's infected, except for a root canal, and that can only be done twice. one root canal and one re-treatment of the tooth after that the tooth must be pulled..sorry    EDIT: An abscess is actually an infection of the root of the tooth, a root canal is the only way to get rid of the infection, since you had the first root canal, you can have it retreated. If by chance that does not work, the only other option is Extraction.|`|RGcXgjEDaa	Sounds like becuase it was in soft tissue it was (for lack of better word) absorbed, thats why the antibiotic.  You have an infection in the soft tissue which is causing the pain.  Should the antibiotic work there should be no surgery neccesary.  Time will tell though, I would trust the dentist|`|RvddYKqjaa	Keep taking the antibiotics. It can be a very slow process. Keep in close contact with your dentist.  The abscess will eventually go away, but it might be painful for awhile. Assume that the meds will help. Don't think beyond that right now. If the abscess needs to be drained, you can rest assured you will be numb and won't feel it.|`|JV0i77uiaa	Just keep taking the antibiotic, make sure you take all of them.  Ask the doctor to prescribe some pain killer.  Put some ice pack to avoid swollen, chances are that the abscess will go away.    I had a big abscess in my lower tooth and the dentist took almost three hours draining pus, but he gave me antibiotic and pain killer.  The next day I had my throat all swallen.  After a month I went back and everything was ok.|`|46otjIowaa	It should go down on its own.  As long as you take the antibiotics.|`|4Dn7JRFWaa	try putting a cotton ball with hot water drenched in salt on the affected area as long as you can stand it and it will bring the infection down|`|OP6zAOULaa	Your taking the amoxicillin (an anti-biotic) which fights and kills the infection. So your dentist as of now believes that the meds will kill the infection. lets hope that thats the case. make sure you finish them all because if you dont there could be a little of the infection left and it will grow back. when you got the root canal he may have drained most of it. which may be why its not daining. and yes abscess are very painfull. i would suggest just relaxing and taking your meds on time|`|kTZevQNHaa	The abscess will probably come to a head (Eeew--gross I know--but that's what usually happens) and this bitter tasting gunk will come out--you will see the whitish abscess develop on your gum most likely......use hot salt water -swishing in your mouth--and also holding a hot waterbottle on your side where infection is and it will speed up the process--bring it to a head  and help the antibiotics to work.  When you see it...take a clean tissue...and press on that spot and burst is yourself if you happen to look in your mouth and it's there...sop the mess up and rinse well..and it will then just go away.
rpnFxnCQaa	You should go see a dermatologist (skin doctor). Perhaps just a mouth ulcer but who knows until they see it.    All the best!|`|uaIUBYTcaa	Go see a doctor.
dc5579dda31633fb3c2d8612ff7583cdaa	Pre-Workout Snacks    Dont enter a workout hungry. If you start exercising in an energy deficit, your body is likely to preserve fat and perform poorly. If you tend to bonk out midway through a hard session, low energy may be the culprit. Quick absorbing carbs with a high glycemic index will give you fast fuel. So before a tough workout, have a sports drink, juice, fruit, bread or pasta to take in some calories. Depending on the intensity and type of activity you are doing, you may be less likely to have an upset stomach if you avoid high-fiber foods at this time. Or if you have them, wait an hour or two to digest before you start your workout. If you need to grab a snack minutes before a workout, chew thoroughly and go for a quick-digesting, high-carb food. But, if you are merely going on a moderate-paced walk for 45 minutes, you probably dont need extra food unless youre heading out first thing in the morning. But if you are going to do two spin classes, an 8-mile run or something equally vigorous, fuel up beforehand.      During a Workout    Again, what and how much you need depends upon what you are doing. If the workout is intense and lasts from 60 to 90 minutes or longer, you probably need extra fuel. A sports drink or energy gel is the easiest absorbing solution, although bread, juice, fruit or an energy bar work too.      The Post-Exercise Energy Window    If you went on an easy walk for an hour, you dont need to eat extra. But if you had a high-intensity workout lasting 60 to 90 minutes or longer, then its crucial to eat afterwards. Within the first 45 minutes post-exercise, there is a metabolic window. This means that enzymes that replenish muscle carbs are at their highest levels. Plus, insulin, which rebuilds protein stores, is at peak levels. So eating a carb-and-protein mix (peanut butter sandwich, yogurt with fruit, bagel with cream cheese, or a handful of nuts) at this point will maintain muscle, replenish glycogen stores and reduce the amount of fat your body  stores. Even a sport drink or a piece fruit are a good idea if you dont have something more complex available. (These calories are needed to recover, so they are less likely to be stored as excess fat.)|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	hydrate before, eat after.|`|Shp5riE6aa	Some pasta and fish about an hour after would be good.|`|NAbioaNmaa	after    eat a protein bar or something before|`|Rj3epU5yaa	eat about 2 hours before you work out, eating right before is a bad idea, if you work out properly you won't be hungry until a while after you work out.|`|ygimTNzoaa	Eat after, my dad told my brother it's best to eat after because before it just drags you down and sometimes you'll get cramps, your food is digesting and your body isn't burning it off yet since, well you haven't digested it yet so eating after is better. You working out while you digest will just burn you out faster because your bodys working over just so you can still digest while you exercise. As for what to eat it really depends on the person so I cant help you much there.

It is good to eat before a work out but allow at least an hour after eating before exercising, this will prevent stomach cramps and throwing up, you will also be able to give your body a better work out with out the fear of your last meal coming back up.     It is also good to eat after a work out but about 20 mins after as this will give your body time to cool down and get back to normal after exercise eating too soon after will resort in feeling ill and possibly sick.    Before a work out carbohydrates such as bread, pasta and potatoes are good to eat as they keep you going and after a work out a cereal bar or something similar is good just to stop you feeling really hungry and snacking loads after. Drink lots of water before during and after the work out.    Hoped this helped! :)|`|BpE1y2Rraa	Definitely after. After eating, your body begins digesting the food you have eaten and expends a great deal of energy to this task. Blood rushes to your stomach. If you exercise after eating, you are interfering with the digestive process and demanding of your body that it divide its efforts to two tasks. The result is that both are shortchanged because one is at the expense of the other. Leave at least three hours before exercising after eating.|`|BTYyj9jiaa	After....your metabolism is fast and you don't get as much of the fat left in your body.|`|MmF9okcdaa	eat some steak before you work out then eat some chicken when u done and u build lean muscle and bulk up and get diesel son|`|UbQyyWtuaa	think small snack before and small dinner afterwards.

g3AdLLUPaa	Boils (skin abscesses/skin discoloration) are localized infections caused by bacteria or toxins that find their way into your skin and infect deep skin tissues.     They often start out as reddened, tender   spots which then become hard, painful   nodules that fill with white blood cells   (pus) and form a "head." The skin   surrounding a boil is often angry,   red and extremely sensitive.     If the boil does not erupt and drain   in some cases the skin must be lanced by   a physician to clean out the infection.   Some people suffer from repeated outbreaks   of boils (Furunculosis).|`|72DBWVBOaa	use emolient oil moisteriszer

gIVZhSKaaa	It depends on the strain and if he takes his medicine. Some strains will go into remission others can be cured. Some times the portion of the infected lung can be surgically removed as a move toward a cure.  People with Aids, contract it easily and it contributes to weakening their lives more readily.    If you have been around him, undoubtedly you will be asked to have a TB test.

CLcGxHpAaa	You need to see a psychiatrist or whom ever is currently prescribing you Prozac and Xanax and tell them exactly what you have said here.  If that person is not available you need find another mental health professional. Have you ever undergone therapy?  It can be beneficial in combination with your medication, it may also give you some much needed support, that your family seems to lack..  You are not a piece of ****.  You are a young woman in need of serious psychological help.|`|GVf1Ho7haa	this is scary because you sound like me and from what I have read I can relate a lot!I know what depression , anxiety & paranoia feels like..its horrible & your mom doesnt sound very helful/understanding but neither was and is my mother ..btwnare you in therapy? I think that could be helpful  I was going through that and I still kind of am so maybe if you wanna talk you can just add me if you like I dont mind    Larissa_LIBERTY@hotmail.com    good luck =)|`|Hqs0Apz7aa	I was in a similar situation just two years ago. It seems to me that you really don't want to kill yourself, and I would also recommend that you don't. But what you have to do first is to stop putting yourself down. Don't say that you are a piece of **** or anything like that. The first step I think, is to stop putting yourself down, and don't try to make yourself feel bad...try to forget everything that makes you feel depressed. Try to express your feelings through something else like writing (poetry) or doing some physical sport. Also, you should try to think as optimistically as you can, no matter what anyone says. Just ignore everyone who says anything rude and worry about yourself. And If you don't think you can do this, try to find some motivation. Like I got out of this in order to prove to everyone who put me down that I could be better and I am now. Maybe you should think in a similar way, try to do everything in your power to get better to prove everyone who doubted you wrong, and to prove to your mom that you are capable of achievingng great things.    I hope that helps you.|`|QJ9OAto3aa	Your mum is one of the reasons your feeling like this, there's nothing worse then i parent undermining you. My dad does the same thing and i feel terrible. Keep taking your tablets and don't worry what they think of you! Your do things for yourself, no one else. Go to your GP, seen as your 16 and tell him you would like to b refereed to a therapist or concealer as you want to talk about your problems. I'm in almost the exact same boat. You can email me whenever you want to and we can share our problems!. You can add me on MSN.. Me and my sister have a joint account but don't worry shes also in the same position. Good luck to you!.|`|y43tzOQlaa	Hi, I will start as a mom, you are not a piece of ....! You are a Human being that needs love and understanding! Your mom is probably lashing out at you because she feels like she somehow failed you. That is not your problem to bare. If she hasn't already she could probably use some counseling her self. If you feel like your dr.s are not listening to you, change dr.s, it's your right to find good qualified help that actually helps you! There is also allot of help through learning about nutrition and exercise, that doesn't mean you go to the gym and work out everyday, it means that you take walks, you ask a friend if they will just go for a walk with you. You don't even need to talk but breathe and walk, learn how to relax. It is a process that you have to stick with but it takes as much energy to get better as it is to stay sick. No one can break you if you find the strength a little at a time, one step at a time. It has to be your choice to be strong and get better, anxiety and depression don't always "go away" but there are so many ways you can learn how to work with it. Your brain is a powerful tool, use it to get yourself stronger and better. Hang in there, I have teenagers and as a mom I know how important it is for me to support them and listen so they can thrive. Ask your mom to please just listen and not say a word, just listen. Maybe try a mediator, she needs to not point fingers and just try to listen. Take Care....Jen|`|CYzTJIhVaa	This is a sensitive subject so i will try to keep that in mind as i write you.  Suicide is definitely not the answer to life's problems and pain.  The struggles we go through make us stronger people.  At 16 you are hardly a "fuk up"  You haven't lived long enough to fuk up anything honey.  You have your whole life ahead of you ( i know it's a cliche but it's true! LOL)  It sounds like the root of your problems may be your mom.  It sounds like she is the one who has problems and now they are affecting you.  She probably is dealing (or not dealing) with her own issues.  If there is someone you know very well and trust, go to them when you are feeling this way.  If you believe in God, pray when you are feeling troubled.  There are many people who have gone through this.  You are not alone, so just please keep going.  there is someone out there who can understand and help you with this.  Also the suicidal thoughts could be a side effect of the meds your are taking.  You may want to let your doctor know what is going on.  One thing you should rememeber is that it might be dark right now but there is ALWAYS a light at the end of the tunnel.  It may take awhile to get there, but you will.  NO ONE suffers their WHOLE life unless they want to.  It WILL get better, believe me.  But you are 16, you can become anything you want!  Don't worry about what your family thinks of you.  What is it that YOU would like out of your life?  If they really feel you are a fuk up, then prove them wrong!!  Chances are they could be quite miserable themselves and misery loves company, so it is only natural for them to try and attack you to bring you to their level.  Don't let it happen.  Be the best you you can be and I guarantee you you will be a much happier person.
pCZPtegeaa	I've been taking it for about a week now and I've dropped 4-5 pounds taking one pill twice a day. The max you can take is 3 twice a day, and I haven't done that yet.|`|NPzDQmlQaa	I have been through it all and know what's it about.  The main thing is to stick in there.  You can't be an addict to food and never exercise if you want to live a healthy life and keep the weight off.  I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.      Nothing works,  besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.      First,  depending on how much weight you need to lose,  your diet is the first concern.  You can't eat 10,000 calories a day and expect the weight to come off,  even if you are exercising a lot.  Which brings us to the next thing.  Duh,  Exercising...    This is a must especially if you need to a lot of weight.  Get at least 30 mins of some good hardcore exercising.  Do some cardio,  in the long run,  it's good for the heart.    However,  I find the most hardest part of losing weight/keeping it off,  in my diet.  It's so hard to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or those chocolate goodies.  I've found a great addition to help any one out,  it's a natural weight loss supplement called Proactol.  Now don't get all crazy on me and say diet pills don't work.  That is true,  but not in this case.  This one isn't meant to burn pounds while you sit on the couch.  It's an appetite suppressant,  along with being a fat binder.  I saved money on the pills at theweightlossplace.com along with getting some good info.  It basically makes those fingers not go towards the cookie jar.  For me it's the best pill I've tried and I've tried cupboards full.  Now this doesn't mean you have to follow my foot steps but I've successfully lost roughly 70 pounds and keeping it off til this day.      Well good luck and remember what I said,  Dedicate.

Z8EKWJ3aaa	being that you sit a lot for your job, it sounds like hemorrhoids. I wouldn't go to the ER, it will cost you several hundred if not a thousand or more. You should start with a regular doctor and go from there. You can see one for under a hundred usually. Probably could even find a reasonable doctor at or very close to any larger truck stop just for driver convenience. It can lead to something serious if it isn't roids.

For example: one may work for one person but the same antidepressant might be useless to a different person.

It also help reduce and suppress my panic attacks. A good anti depressant is prozac and for a mood stabilizer lamictal.

MYqu4bDNaa	usually there is not much relation between diabetes and headaches.  headache can be as simple as tension headache to headaches due to space occupying leisions in the brain.it can also be due to sight problems or simply due to sleep deprieval.it can also be due to high blood pressure or due to some trauma.in short it is of variable etiology and is abit difficult to say its cause without going into detailed history and examination.|`|ZNbauLJzaa	My son has diabeates. As the person before me noted, he gets headaches when he's really high.  Your headache may not be related to your diabetes.|`|1wFMGizXaa	High blood sugar and hypoglycemia can cause bad headaches. It's also possible that your headaches are unrelated to diabetes. A lot of people experience seasonal allergies. Is the pain in your face at all? Do you have a tooth infection? Are you stressed out?|`|KAHrZLz3aa	I sometimes get headaches right before I go low, I also get them when my BS is high|`|e49df1dd7953dd332ef171ba30601b89aa	When I was 15 I kept getting horrible headaches. My doctor kept telling me it was nothing and to just take some headache pills. Needless to say I ended up spending a week in the hospital due to being in DKA. Since you said your levels aren't great but not that high you should still look up DKA and see if you are experiencing some of the other symptoms like:    - High ketone levels in your urine  - Excessive thirst  - Frequent urination  - Weakness or fatigue    There are more symptoms than that. You will have to look them up but don't just take it lightly cause it could just be a headache or it could be something worse like DKA. Make sure you drink plenty of water, if it is the beginning of DKA the water will help flush your system and keep you from going into full blown DKA. If you start vomiting seek a physician immediately. DKA can be life threatening . I hope I didn't scare you.

He might be depressed as well. There's really not that much you can do other than being a stable influence in his life. Just let him know you enjoy his company and hopefully he'll come around. Do your best to be the friend that you'd want him to be for you. The Golden Rule.     He's very lucky to have someone like you.|`|AA10772154	Don't push - Just continue with your friendship - Be considerate - He is hurting still -|`|tYvf7YK6aa	Wow that is so sad.

He obviously just needs time, it takes him a while to really trust someone so if you want you can try to ask him out as a group thing with your friends. He may open up a bit.

4nCoFPlOaa	I've used it on scars before and it does make a difference. The gel is quite sticky and needs a lot of massaging for it to absorb.

Hope it works for you too :)|`|IiiowjP8aa	absolutely, by all means ,use it. it is expensive and an alternative is to get some vitamin  e lotion and use that on your face
hF6uZqWRaa	I just started taking birth control and my doctor told me not to have unprotected sex until i been on it for over a month. Your body is just getting use to the pill so it takes time... just to save any surprises keep using a condom ... good luck.|`|lzcglDnMaa	Just for your safety sake you need to use condoms everytime you have sex. Even if you are on bc you can still get pregnant, many girls have.|`|wLLylvN2aa	Most say to wait a full cycle before having unprotected sex. Dont forget birth control is not 100% effective. You want to make sure you take it same time everyday to make it the most effective.|`|tGcNmDUZaa	Yeah this should be okay. You should use a condom too though... Just in case.|`|kQ6x5Mokaa	if you started taking them on the first day of your period, yep. If yuo started at any random point in your cycle you might want to wait a month, but your chances are still much less.    even with no contraception and full internal ejaculation on the day you ovulate, you never have more than a 33% chance of getting pregnant on any given month|`|Tz7cBm0iaa	oh, you naughty little thing.|`|dgqETVLmaa	its sounds fine|`|kdh46X95aa	No it's not ok you're acting pretty dumb about the situation.|`|fXj2kVpPaa	*sigh*    Please don't have sex.|`|bgdjtJepaa	Your best bet would be to finish your first month of birth control beforehand.

If he touches the right spots in the right way then yea you can have an orgasm. But sense it seems like ya'll r both inexperienced it may not happen.

Just remember only do this if you truly want to,even though it isn't full intercourse it may be more than your emotionally ready for.|`|bgdjtJepaa	I had my first orgasm by fingering.  Go for it it is absolutely amazing!|`|jZwK9WlLaa	Yes it is.     You can have one being fingered with out having sex before.   Your 19 so the chances are higher. But it depends on how he does it. You both have to be in the right mood.    Also you have to Communicate with him, tell him where you like it, how hard how fast etc some places it can hurt some its really nice. so just talk about it, it may take some practice. make sure his hands are clean.  have fun :)|`|SEsGRdHTaa	It all depends on the person.

5769f110474fd157a0d6c0b3ca8ac6d8aa	This is not a fun operation.  But it is worth it.  It is rather painful, so take all the pain killers they give you.  Also, they won't let you out until you can eat properly - I found that by eating ice cream first, I could eat proper food!  And never ever eat a banana.  Some people say it hasn't affected them, but I ate a banana after about a month after my operation and I hit the roof.  Don't take a chance - do not eat a banana.  My daughter sings - she had her tonsils out last year and she couldn't sing for at least six weeks.  Maybe even longer.  But don't let it stop you - once it is over and done, you will be much healthier.|`|cNk4I6qfaa	tHE OP IS WORTH IT  but believe me, it was hell for me.  The older you are the worse it is, and i'm 14 so yeah it's not nice.  But whatever you do, no matter how painful, force yourself to eat, that is the ONLY way it goes away quicker.  That's what i had to do, i had to take antibiotics for it too, and the pain meds were too weak , i had to go back and everything.  Geez.  Stupid tonsils.!|`|uRcx9llkaa	i don't think u will sing ever again but u can try. my sister had her tonsils out and she said it was painful and she has to eat alot of jellies!
e6Kbb3H9aa	Antibiotic shot that works faster if given in the Hip. Yes it hurts from the sting of the meds.
XmLJ84YBaa	Hmm...I've had strep several times, but I've never had a shot. I usually just got some penicillin or other antibiotic that I took by mouth at home. As far as the shot is concerned, try not to look. Tell the doctor/nurse that you do not want to know when he or she is going to give the shot. Then it will be all over before you know it. This is the trick I use, and it has worked well for me.|`|O3t4Rccsaa	Not as bad as your throat will if you don't get the shot.  It is all over in a moment and it's a lot better than not being able to swallow when the strep gets worse|`|1YEtUVHnaa	No, usually its in ur but, its a little pinch unless you are sensitive to those things its not to bad|`|QQMQ4u70aa	nahh. shots dont hurt. =]|`|01pnDX0yaa	lol i just got back from doctors and i have strep throat, but they gave me some anti-biotics that i have to take for a little while but no shot :D|`|NsYIUu3caa	there's a possibility of getting 2 shots from your doctor, 1 is a penicillin based anti-biotic and the other could be a steroid to help speed up the recovery process. ask your doctor about it, normally they will either give both shots or the antibiotic as a shot and steroid as a pill.  and the shot is just above your butt (technically in your hip)
O3t4Rccsaa	LOL,, it can kill you.  There is NO way any doctor is giving you methadone, oxy's and Klonopin at the same time.    If you are looking to get high that is a great combo to lead you to a dirt nap.    The oxycodone is great for pain    The methadone is great for getting of opiates and for pain by itself    The klonopin is great if you are having DT for booze, anxiety or kicking heroin    Please don't take the advice of people that have no idea what they are talking about,,,it can kill you.|`|sy9rDK1Gaa	You may not believe this, but there is a natural pain lotion that alleviates any pain BETTER than any of the prescription drugs.  If your pain is not gone immediately, you get your money back.  See: www.extremedy.net|`|QQMQ4u70aa	oxycodone is a pain killer so yes.  but be VERY careful using these. they are narcotics and tend to make people who take them become dependent on them. only take the recommended dose when scheduled and try to avoid taking them for a really long period of time.     if you are worried about that, you can also have your doctor prescribe you a pain patch.|`|qyqxp4abaa	I take two of the three (oxycontin and klonopin) for chronic pain and they are effective, but could be more so.  Looking into a new option and entering hospital tomorrow for a trial with an intrathecal low dose morphine delivery directly into the spine.  Hope this works.

I0GqKJ0aaa	Well you're right, after working out you should feel energized and happy. One problem might be that you're not getting enough protein and not eating as healthy as you should be. You can work-out all you want but still feel bad if you don't eat the way you should. Make sure that you don't drink only water when you work-out, drink something like gatorade too, because it'll help keep you energized. Also, eat before you work out (not RIGHT before, but a good 30 min.) and make sure it's something nutritious (I usually have a serving or two of fruit or veggies) and then make sure you eat after you work out (nothing too big either, I usually have a healthy snack). Another problem might be that you're tired because you don't get enough sleep. Make sure you're getting at least eight hours a night because this will really take a toll on your body and health. When I feel tired after working out it's because I'm actually really tired. I hope this helps! :)|`|Tc23KWgzaa	I think you need to see the dr.  This isn't normal for someone your age.    TX Mom|`|ot8tImmcaa	maybe your not eating right. Exercising and eating right goes hand in hand|`|aariLFAMaa	Maybe your not getting enough protein. Make sure you drink a lots of water and take a multi-vitamin everyday. You should probably cut it down to 3 times a week and see how that goes? Or maybe cut your workout time shorter. I had the a similar problem. I started working out 5-6 days a week for about an hour but after a few weeks, I started to get really tired because I have school and I work full time also. I put my school work before my workout so I cut it down to 3 times a week.  It's really hard to keep up the consistant routine but try cutting it down and if you think you can handle it more, gradually start working out more. Maybe your overwhelming your body with everything else going on.|`|F1VXXMrOaa	It is probably your diet. Make sure you are eating healthy and getting enough protein. Stay hydrated. If you work out more, you need to make sure you have enough healthy calories to keep you going through the day.|`|XmEjhMvRaa	you are working and using all of your muscles..that's good. But you are also extering enegry which means all your enegry is going into that work out and once u are done working out..u are really tired and don't have enough energy to do something else
QQMQ4u70aa	try getting some myoflex.   thats what we use at the hospital on people who have had knee and hip surgeries and who are sore after their therapies. its good stuff.|`|xzl9njBXaa	Ice them down minutes after you finish your workout,get a massage.|`|EMmGFqgJaa	Eat a banana. The potassium in them might help.

tSCaG1iRaa	I know abortion is a hasty descion to some of you out there, but she is 16. How do any of you know if she has the means to even properly care for herself or the well being of this unborn child.      Stop judging others that descion is hard enough on a woman to make with out hearing what other closeminded people have to say about it.     Do any of you remember the times where women were shoving COAT HANGERS up their vaginas in attempts to abort a baby? what about being pushed down stair, or even hit in the stomach, and dying from these methods??!!!!!  This girl is trying to do this safely.     ok now heres my answer.  tell your mother. no matter what she will still love you. Secondly find out if there is a planned parenthood in the area or something similar. a womans free clinic maybe. I am not familiar with England, but I'd go a head and assume there is something like that across the pond.     dont do anything rash. keep your health in mind when making your descion. good luck. and i hope all goes well.|`|MRw1uEuLaa	I'm very offended by this question  I'm not going to answer it|`|9QyrW2iCaa	I realize that you said you have no other option, but I'm wondering if I could adopt your baby.  I've been trying to get pregnant and it's just not happening.  My family of origin is from England so it would kind of be like keeping the baby in an English family.      You know I thought I would have killed myself when I was around your age if I got pregnant due to my mother's reaction.  It took almost 25 years later for her to tell me that she wouldn't have wanted me to abort a baby and that she would have been supportive.  Sometimes I think we imagine the worst in our family and friends.    I'm sorry you're having to make such a difficult decision at such a young age.  It is quite amazing how we can often think that the worst of circumstances will ruin our lives and they just don't turn out like that.    Have you seen the movie, "Juno" . . . just wondering . . .     Best of luck to you, whatever you decide.  : )|`|gT3fnenwaa	Unfortunately, I live in the U.S so I don't know about the laws in England. I went to a doctor that I found in the phone book. And seriously, he was actually listed under "abortion". They required me to have an ID and of course, cash. I was under age and had my sister take me. We said she was my legal guardian. It never showed up on any of my records. Your doctor will never know either unless he is also your gynecologist.        It really sucks to in your position, I know how you feel. Besides detesting the idea, will your boyfriend be there for you? If not, get a good girlfriend to go with you so you have somebody to cry on. I'm sorry for your situation and hope everything turns out for you.  The baby will understand and forgive you, of that I am sure!|`|hF6uZqWRaa	i know planned parenthood does abortions but i dont know if theres any in your area... but you have to be 18 or if your underage a parent has to go with you... good luck .|`|jZPv153Jaa	sometimes things happen for a reason.. . .i mean just think it over and try just try to talk to your parents. . . .and maybe planned parenthood would work. make your decision be worthit and that you know you wont regret it laer> >|`|jaAolejUaa	please, please, please do not abort the baby    if u cannot take care of it just look for someone who is wiling to adopt in and assist u in your pregnancy. there are a lot of couples who cant have a baby who does that|`|Xrvutzmdaa	ok first DONT HAVE AN ABORTION !! please not only are you killing a poor little Innocent baby but from the abortion you are at risk because i met with soo many women who had abortions and they had thoughts of suicide and they are so depressed etc. but please if u need any help with any thing u can seriously email me like go online to project rachel http://www.hopeafterabortion.com/ this is this whole session women go to because they get really depressed from the abortion go through the website maybe contact the women and they will help u please dont have an abortion !!|`|m4nDQcWQaa	Is that really the only option for you right now?  Take care of the baby. You should be responsible for your acts though. Please don't abort the child.|`|rVnTnuU1aa	I really don't agree with abortion, but that is personal decision that each person has to be able to make and live with. At 16, i can understand your reasoning. Although you may want to consider adoption as a possible choice to. So many families out there that cant have children. Check the yellow pages and make some calls, you should be able to obtain an abortion without it going on your medical record. However, there can be complications, so you might want to keep your family doctor in the loop as well.|`|H82TNFlgaa	Try Marie Stopes - they are private. But remember, this is a very big decision - they do offer counselling, but it is focussed more on whether to abort or not. I would advise going to a family planning centre (which is off your medical record) and ask them for a consultation before making up your mind.    Whatever you decide, take your time and talk to someone if your family.    Good luck|`|29X6EEsKaa	Not really an answer, but I just wanted to say I support your decision and right to choose. These self-righteous people telling you to give it away don't have any right to tell you what to do, nor do they know what your going through. Best of luck :)|`|a0b83986209c3ad9a015c92f044e983eaa	Check to see if they have a planned parenthood in your hometown. Good Luck!|`|rnNn9Ervaa	I'm not too keen on the law in england, but do this the right way and go see a doctor. I'm sure you can request that it not go on your medical record. i know here in the states that in some places, even under 18, you can go and get an abortion without involving your parents or your medical record.    and don't listen to the idiots above begging you not to abort it. its not their body and it certainly is not a living thing. We all make mistakes, it's entirely inevitable.     good luck!|`|ciQjwtTcaa	Im not saying whether or not im for or against abortion, im just ANSWERING your question.  first off tell your parents, then go to the doctor, tlel them that your considering abortion.  Im not sure if its legal where you live, it its illegal, you might have some problems that you will have to face at that point but if its legal, tell your doctor, he will (probably reluctantly) give you information.  Be persistant.  But make sure that you have THOUGHT very hard about what your doing.|`|493bd246fd26d0e4c730058dc333cc80aa	Note, this isn't a hate message.

I would think about it.|`|PeMpDAbraa	Sorry...but....there is always the chance that sex will produce a baby and you now have a BABY.

The Silent Scream was a propaganda movie, as is most of the other "information" the anti-choice people glom onto and parrot without any knowledge as to what they're talking about and there is no room in their tiny buttinsky little world for responsible people who have contraceptive failure.  No birth control is 100% effective and a person who tried to prevent pregnancy shouldn't have people preaching at them to alter their bodies and hormones for something they clearly tried to prevent.  In the end, it's your body, your decision, and your future.  Good luck to you.

Give it some time- if it doesn't stop in a couple of weeks, see a dentist.|`|6MHdh2rIaa	chew on the other side, wait for it to stick again. it should stop soon.|`|3d2q4X5Taa	I had that.<br>  just bush your teeth better, and do w/e to keep them clean.<br>  Use your brush on your gums above the tooth, but do it light so it wont bleed.<br>  <br>  Hope that works for you|`|XtOcQm5Kaa	wait a few days<br>  if its worse<br>  go see your dentist<br>  dont worry you 'll be fine :)
YsZqNHOhaa	yeah i think they are cause when i get nose bleeds my mum always asks me if i've been getting headaches lately, i always thought it was a sign of high blood pressure, if you're worried a visit to your doctor wont hurt.<br>  <br>  good luck<br>  <br>  (=
ETcBRko3aa	Yes, but you need to be able to show that you are NOT well controlled with medication; because many believe that once you take a mood stabilizer, you are all better.<br>  <br>  Here are things they will look at:<br>  Have you been hospitalized<br>  Are you in therapy<br>  How many medications and how long<br>  How many jobs and reasons for losing them<br>  How many "episodes" do you have, <br>  etc..<br>  <br>  You will denied the first time.  Almost everyone is.  Then get a lawyer, reapply if you fit the "criteria" and you should be approved.|`|gkqmrIAGaa	Absolutely if you are unable to keep a job because of your Bi-polar disorder or any other mental disease. Bi-Polar is a disease just like heart disease or diabetes and requires the right medications. In your case an antidepressant and an antipsychotice for the mania. I hope you take your medications as prescribed. You can go to your closest Social Security office to apply. It will save you a lot of trouble if you have a list of all of the doctors that you have seen, their addresses and phone numbers and all of the places that you have been employed including again addresses and phone numbers. As soon as you apply for the SSdisability you immediately qualify for medicaid.  If you are only able to work part time and don't have medical insurance you local Human Resources Office may be able to help you to apply and let you know if you qualify.  If you are having problems getting your medication or seeing a psychiatrist you can call your local Social Services Department and they can refer you to low cost or free medical help.|`|3SqtWtaxaa	yes Im pretty sure it does.

You need to take the whole pill everyday. If you're not comfortable with all the "hormones" running around in your body then you better get used to not having nice skin. It's not that big of a deal, it actually evens you out.|`|qNYW6Y97aa	um no and to be honest that is the stupidest idea i ever heard.  you cannot break down a birth control pill.  you take one pill a day for three weeks and then you get your period.  otherwise you will be messing with your cycle.  The hormones are safe.  You should research this.  Birth control has been around for many years and its safe, i know people who got pregnant ON THE PILL if you don't take it within 30 min of the same time each day you reduce the ffectiveness of the pill down to 92%.  But since you are not sexually active you should know that breaking down the pill or taking it every other day will probably just screw up your menstural cycle (when you get your periods) and you will not get ANY of the benefits associated with the pill.

AA11693263	It is called Salmonella poisoning and if you had this you would definitely be sick enough to know. At first you would feel fine and then all of a sudden you are just sick. Really sick, throwing up, diarrhea, stomach cramps. I had it once about 10 years ago and it was the most horrible sickness that I have ever had. I was in the bathroom constantly, I couldn't eat or drink anything. I got so weak that I couldn't even sit myself up in bed let alone walk on my own.

Hln4rv4Caa	Hi Tita,<br>  <br>  Hi, Stretch marks appear due to expansion and shrinkage of epidermis( the outer skin ) but dermis (The second layer or inner layer) also get affected due to stretch marks. There are many reasons they appear .Two are main , because of pregnancy when skin expand and then shrink and second one when you gain or loose weight very fast.<br>  <br>  Your case is infact the second one as you said you have gained weight .You can use cocoa butter but it will have little effect in your case.<br>  I would suggest that if you have itchy feeling first apply some antibiotic lotion . For removing stretch marks , it will take some time.<br>  <br>  But the good news is there are many tricks and techniques which you can use at home and get rid of these stretch marks .<br>  <br>  Like take a teaspoon of honey and mix it with 3-4 drops of lemon juice. Cleanse the affected area and then apply the mixture twice daily.<br>  <br>  I a week or two you will see visible effects.<br>  <br>  If you want to know more about How to get rid of stretch marks , visit<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/how-do-you-get-rid-of-stretch-marks" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/how-do-you-get-ri...</a><br>  <br>  Hope you will find your solution.|`|RXI8ImdIaa	I've heard of people using vitamin E creams and oils for this. I don't have any personal knowledge though.|`|Ba8PjaCGaa	Stretch marks are due to a tearing of the dermis, a layer of your skin. It has been commonly thought to be due to skin stretching such as from pregnancy or weight gain. But evidence suggests that the tearing of the dermis is more the result of hormonal changes within skin itself.<br>  <br>  There is debate about whether creams using certain vitamins can totally remove stretch marks. Most agree that the marks can be reduced. But there is some testimony from consumers and also a dermatologist that they can be removed completely. You could check on those articles below:|`|KrFQ1gcraa	I have them and they were really noticable for awhile but they've faded over time<br>  <br>  I used some creams that were supposed to work but I've herard cocoa butter works<br>  and just tan them away :)
c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	It will strengthen your arms and shoulders...good for running...|`|zLUQJxJkaa	Chest yes, also the outside of the upper shoulder. Try doing different kinds of pushups, triangle, wide, elbows close to your body, and facing away from your body. Be sure to go SLOWLY, fast isn't as good. The only thing that fast will do is build explosiveness (it won't look much different, maybe a little smaller) and honestly, clap pushups are much better for that.|`|fdKA2Rr7aa	It will help your chest, triceps, biceps, & shoulders. Push ups are actually a very effective method of exercise. You can even get someone to put a weight on your back to increase resistance and improve the overall results. Another way to build the resistance for pushups is to elevate your legs while your arms stay on the floor, such as resting them on a couch or stool.<br>  <br>  Depending on the distance you hold your arms apart for pushups you can work on different areas of your chest, back and arms. Keep up the good efforts.|`|9cYqY6vWaa	It will do most for your chest, like your pecs, but will also do good for your arms, as long as you are doing them properly.

GvQHw4Ntaa	It's really best to take a prenatal vitamin, but the most important thing to take while you're pregnant is folic acid, which can be found in green leafy vegetables like spinach, bok choy, and swiss chard (all of these are actually quite high in folic acid). Folic acid cannot be properly absorbed if you're deficient in other vitamins, such as B12, which is found in large amounts in beef.<br>  <br>  There's really no substitute for a good prenatal vitamin, though, as it takes into account such relationships among vitamins and minerals and will be formulated so that everything is absorbed efficiently.|`|OF7ZHq19aa	You can't find prenatle vitamins in food you dumbo prenatle vitamins are a multivitamin you buy them at the store

Eat (at least) three times a day. <br>  Because when you eat only once a day, your metabolism gets slower than it already is! That's the main reason. Sounds funny, but to lose weight... you must eat (the right things, of course) <br>  ? Eat low-fat, high-fiber foods such as salads and vegetable pastas.<br>  ? Your last meal should be before 18:00. Try. <br>  OK, one apple after 18:00 <br>  ? Don't starve <br>  Starvation is not good for losing weight, nor your health. <br>  Starvation is the worse thing you can do in a weight loss diet. <br>  ? Try oatmeal instead of cornflakes for breakfast--eating oatmeal can help reduce cholesterol levels, and its high fiber content will keep you full longer.<br>  <br>  WHAT to drink for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Drink 6-8 glasses of water every day ! <br>  Can be tap, plain, mineral, sparkling. I just love mineral sparkling water! <br>  This improves your bowel, reduces the "hunger" sensation, and hydrates your skin. Your skin will look much better after the first weeks! <br>  Don't believe the slogan "water makes me fat". Beside being stupid... you might get into serious troubles with your kidneys. <br>  ? Drink ONLY natural juices, freshly squeezed! <br>  Don't drink Coca Cola, Pepsi, Spite etc. during the diet. Even lite or light versions. <br>  <br>  <br>  Exercise for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? If you want quicker results - exercise would be good. <br>  ? Don't just sit in front of the TV and eat peanuts... <br>  I guarantee THIS won't work for your weight loss... <br>  ? Start a regular exercise program and stick with it. Don't be afraid of those sweat suits and Lycra pants! <br>  ? Start swimming. Swimming is an excellent exercise to get involved with, since it increases blood flow and uses muscles we don't regularly use. Start a swimming program and try to do it 3 times a week. You will feel excellent and rejuvenated.<br>  ? Choose an exercise program that you enjoy, and don't shun the unconventional. For instance, did you know that regular vigorous dancing is exercise too?<br>  ? Also Cardiovascular exercises such as running, jogging, or aerobics will help you lose that unwanted belly fat. Weight training can also help you lose body fat because the more muscle mass you have, the more ability your system has to burn body fat.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  Hope this helps~|`|pW16KBlqaa	you're only 7 and you're posting here?<br>  <br>  <br>  *edit* after looking at your questions i'm really having a hard time believing you're 6. i mean i've heard of people lying about their age but not this bad! lol|`|daqfuACgaa	go on a swim team. play water polo.|`|PE5r9ii7aa	ask ur parents and doctor. no offense but u r a bit overweight 4 a 7 year old so ask ur parents
rlvrgwWvaa	Something similar happened to me a while ago, and it was when I was running out in the field in softball. I'm not sure if we had the same thing...so don't take this as a sure thing. What basically happened was my leg ran out of oxygen, and my muscles produced this sort of acid thing that is very painful. I started hyperventilating and crying, and I had to sit the rest of the game out. I wrapped it with ice and that made it feel better. It lasted about a day or two. Or it could be a cramp. However, as for school, get a ride or carpool with someone. And do see the doctor.
WoR9Jyitaa	Often the Monistat cream will cause temporary burning when first applied to the area that is affected. It takes a couple of days for it to take effect. If you do have a yeast infection, you can try a tablet called Fluconazole to get rid of the infection instead of the cream. They are normal prescribed by the doctor. If you have a community health clinic, you can simply go to them, they`ll ask you for a urine sample and they`ll use a little test strip to check right away if you have any infection. Minor scratching once in a while is normal, but I definitely think you need to see a doctor to give you more than the cream you have. It could possibly be just dry skin, but again, he or she can verify that for you. Yeast infections are very common, and it`s best to get them checked up immediately before they get worse.<br>  *In reference to the rude person below, I made a mistake, as everyone in the world does and will correct myself. I meant to say that if you do not have a yeast infection- instead possibly a UTI, then they can treat it with something like a Sulpha drug to clear it up. Often urinary tract infections will accompany a yeast infection. In this case, the doctor may prescribe both medications to be safe before he gets the results of the tests back. Now please people, stop using forums to attack people. Any person in their good mind knows this is not a substitute for sound medical advice.|`|Z7TzJWX4aa	it may not be yeast.  you should NOT be using monistat.  the problem with monistat is that when you misdiagnose yourself (as you likely have), you treat something you don't have.  doing this may cause your body to become resistant to monistat.  one day, when you really do have a yeast infection, it won't work--cheers!<br>  <br>  you need to see a doctor if you think it is yeast.  studies show that most women are incorrect in the self-diagnoses.<br>  <br>  clean yourself off and wait a day or two to see if things get better on their own.<br>  <br>  ps - that "nursing student" is wrong and should probably fail out of nursing school.  antibiotics DO NOT treat yeast--in fact, sometimes they cause yeast!  yeast is not bacteria!|`|DxbaEPbUaa	Monistat needs to go on the inside of your vagina, not just on the outside. you need to tell your mom what's going on. you could be having an allergic reaction to detergent, soap, shower gel or something else.|`|RhPNV1ohaa	Yeast Infection:  Douche morning and evening with a two quart hot water bottle/douche/enema bag.  Filling it with as hot of water as you can tolerate but not so hot that it burns you.  This is very effective at killing yeast as it summons your own white blood cells to the area of infection and they do a splendid job of killing the infection.  One or two days treatment is normally required to get over most yeast infections.
GBC39wHAaa	You might be allergic to Monistat, try one of the types of vaginal creams on the list below. However, if this is your first time having it -then any of the other ones should work except for the Monistat which is causing you more irritation.

Making the initial call is as much your opportunity to 'interview' them as it is for them to ask you questions about what kind of treatment you are seeking.  <br>  <br>  Below is some information to read on how to choose the right one for you.|`|ZX0ddCY1aa	Yeah I think it's probably a waste of money. BUT if you like it and it makes you feel better in any way at all it is worth it. Plus that is therapy for you in a different way. Ya know? Of course only if you can afford it. If you can then get going! :)|`|Bxj8ty2xaa	NO! If it is not helping, and you don't need it, DO NOT GO.<br>  <br>  <br>  Only go if you have a serious problem, and GO TO SOMEONE ELSE.<br>  <br>  You need someone who cares about YOU not themselves!|`|BpwJ97cjaa	I would say switch therapists. if you miss it there has to be a reason. I think you should go back.|`|3SqtWtaxaa	Yes if it is beneficial to you. If you dont like the therapist see another one. They are not all the same price. Shop around.|`|qVYgTdr3aa	i think you should.<br>  you should do what's best for you.<br>  <br>  char. ;D<br>  <br>  Take care!|`|q34vCB3Qaa	no your wasting your money! just seek help from friends and your fellow friends at Y!A :)|`|EEba0I83aa	maybe you just miss having someone reliable to talk to. and/or just having that company. i know i did when i stopped going to therapy, i just recently went back and it's been getting better. you're the one paying, you're the one in charge. so you should be straight forward about it and stern, and tell him maybe he should let you talk about you. and if you just want to go and hear him talk, then that's cool. sometimes you just need the company, and it being a therapist is always a plus. if cost is an issue, talk to him about it. there's always some kind of help.<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|td9UKfjsaa	You should find a therapist that works for you and that is less expensive. Not everything therapist is good. Especially ones who talk about themselves that inappropriate for a therapist to do. Find one that you insurance covers and don't be afraid to ask your old therapist to refer you to someone|`|FyP4QFJ1aa	You may feel like its not doing anything but it could be... I'd suggest trying it again and really evaluating your progress or if a different therapy or place could be better. Hope I helped a little :)|`|vfL4VMVqaa	ok like another user said: they arent all the same price. so why dont you look it up in the phone book or sumthin you will most likely find a better therapist|`|RrmO1xkuaa	It depends on whether your client needs have been fulfilled, and what kind of therapy you've been going for. A counselor who talks about himself is absolutely unprofessional, not to mention that he charges way too much for doing nothing. What do you miss about the sessions? If you want to save money, maybe you should try sharing your problems with friends and family, or if you need professional help find another person who doesn't charge as much.|`|Dj5f1SRfaa	Find a better therapist that suits your needs.|`|upvLAyyzaa	$500/month!?!?!  That sounds a little outrageous.  I pay $20/month, but then again I only see my therapist like on a monthly basis.  But if it's not doing anything, stop going.  Especially if he just talks about himself all the time, it's not about him, it's about YOU!  So if you miss it, I may recommend finding a different therapist.  Or figure out what you miss about it, then if possible, find a different way to satisfy that need.  Know what I mean?  But I know how you feel, it's so easy to get attached to the therapeutic relationship because it's close to you.  So either find a different therapist, hopefully cheaper and more helpful, or find out what attracts you to that relationship, and try to find another way to fulfill that need.|`|5l6Ol14Raa	Therapy is good for everyone, it's very nice to have somewhere to go to less go of everything and "dump & deal"<br>  <br>  Try going to a therapist locally. They most likely have a lower price and the insurance helps out allot (In my case at least).<br>  <br>  Google this: therapy counseling centers<br>  + your city and state.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|RrgQUT5vaa	That's pretty expensive!  Is that your copay?<br>  <br>  I think that you should look for a therapist that listens to you and doesn't talk about himself.<br>  <br>  If you miss it, I don't think that it was completely uneffective, right?|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	No just start being honest with yourself.You know what is right.Do what is right.

dJuEtGxraa	I just answered J M questions and he copied my answers. Heres the proof: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ApqsBudfq2zPvXrIZsKSIe_sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090219185233AAv2zwL">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|kbGOMwi7aa	Here are a few tips;<br>  <br>  WHEN to eat for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Eat (at least) three times a day. <br>  Because when you eat only once a day, your metabolism gets slower than it already is! That's the main reason. Sounds funny, but to lose weight... you must eat (the right things, of course) <br>  ? Eat low-fat, high-fiber foods such as salads and vegetable pastas.<br>  ? Your last meal should be before 18:00. Try. <br>  OK, one apple after 18:00 <br>  ? Don't starve <br>  Starvation is not good for losing weight, nor your health. <br>  Starvation is the worse thing you can do in a weight loss diet. <br>  ? Try oatmeal instead of cornflakes for breakfast--eating oatmeal can help reduce cholesterol levels, and its high fiber content will keep you full longer.<br>  <br>  WHAT to drink for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Drink 6-8 glasses of water every day ! <br>  Can be tap, plain, mineral, sparkling. I just love mineral sparkling water! <br>  This improves your bowel, reduces the "hunger" sensation, and hydrates your skin. Your skin will look much better after the first weeks! <br>  Don't believe the slogan "water makes me fat". Beside being stupid... you might get into serious troubles with your kidneys. <br>  ? Drink ONLY natural juices, freshly squeezed! <br>  Don't drink Coca Cola, Pepsi, Spite etc. during the diet. Even lite or light versions. <br>  <br>  <br>  Exercise for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? If you want quicker results - exercise would be good. <br>  ? Don't just sit in front of the TV and eat peanuts... <br>  I guarantee THIS won't work for your weight loss... <br>  ? Start a regular exercise program and stick with it. Don't be afraid of those sweat suits and Lycra pants! <br>  ? Start swimming. Swimming is an excellent exercise to get involved with, since it increases blood flow and uses muscles we don't regularly use. Start a swimming program and try to do it 3 times a week. You will feel excellent and rejuvenated.<br>  ? Choose an exercise program that you enjoy, and don't shun the unconventional. For instance, did you know that regular vigorous dancing is exercise too?<br>  ? Also Cardiovascular exercises such as running, jogging, or aerobics will help you lose that unwanted belly fat. Weight training can also help you lose body fat because the more muscle mass you have, the more ability your system has to burn body fat.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  Hope this helps~

LCMCrmQTaa	Ive been the same way, its called cyberchondriac. U look up on the internet your symptoms and make yourself believe you have an illness. I think you need to stop worrying about cancer, unless its really really abnormal dont worry about, every single bump and pain is very occasional in teens. I had really bad pains in my chest before and i got a chest xray and everything was fine, same with bumps ive been the dermatologists and they dont worry at all.

0e3034d2280fb2b424be0eff3932f8e1aa	The results will be the same. There are pros and cons to both a fixed appliance and a removable one. A removable one is more hygienic (easy to clean by removing and no food getting trapped).  The fixed one will likely take less time to do the job it's intended for since you will not be removing it to eat, clean, etc. However, the fixed one is hard to clean unless you use a waterpik to remove food particles that get stuck in the appliance.<br>  <br>  The dentist I works for usually gives the option to the parents which one they think would work best for their child. Some are more responsible and will wear a removable one as instructed and some won't.  Talk to your parents about it before you approach the orthodontist about your preference. He/She might not give you that option either. <br>  <br>  Good luck!

Try sleeping in pajama bottoms so your legs don't touch each other and don't use vaseline or anything greasy, try some kind of medicated powder.

However, if you don't experience any bad odors or discharges, have no fever or rash, you should be OK.

If you get a fever or a rash - get to the doctor right away - you could possibly get toxic shock syndrome.  It is caused by tampons that are left in too long.  But, it is a guarantee you will get that just because you left a tampon in too long - just that it COULD happen.|`|X8ImtFIDaa	well first things first. change it. but be careful to not do it again.

And im sure you dont want that to happen so..yeah.|`|cjcjRvKdaa	You're probably fine, just don't let it happen again.  The risk is if there is bacteria in the vagina.  As long as you keep yourself clean and you had clean hands when you inserted it in the first place, you are probably fine.<br>  <br>  However, if you develop a fever and vomiting soon, you should definitely keep that tampon in mind.  <br>  <br>  Think of all the women who go to their gynecologist because of a bad smell, only to find out they left a tampon in there for a couple of weeks.  I've heard of that happening a lot, and the worst case of anyone I know personally is them getting a vaginal infection that was easily treated.<br>  <br>  Don't worry!  It's terribly common!|`|XbZIicftaa	You could get an infection, like toxic shock syndrome.

I dont binge or purge. But I will tell you my story. When I was 9 I went to the doctors because I was barely eatting anything. Not because I wanted to loose weight but because I was getting sick with everything I ate. My whole family was getting scared they thought I was going Anorexic so they brought me to the doctars. And so when I got there I was diagnosed with Anorexia. But then I started eatting a lot going back to normal I stopped getting sick. Then when I was 12 at every food I have in my house or when we go food shopping I look on the back of every nutrition. I look at the total fat and calories. Also to add on, I was a complete profectionist. Every mirror that I walked by I looked into, I was exstreamly self conscious. I also have acne issues nothing terribly serious like I've seen a lot worse then mine but it'd still make me cry. Things got worse with my perfectionist mind, I always thought in my mind I have to be the most beautiful. It was something in my mind I'd go to school and I'd say, "I look the best in this class today." But then I had ot be the best looking at school as well and places I went too and its obviously a known fact that there will always be better. Things got worse I started to starve myself and everyday I'd look onto the scale. I'd make sure I hadn't gained any weight from the morning and from at night. I'd gone 3 days without eatting, eventually I ate tons of food and felt so sick. That time I was so close to purging myself I even had gotten myself into the bathroom. I wouldnt even sleep until I felt the grossness go away. But then I went back to eatting daily, EXCEPT I didn't eat breakfast or lunch. Only dinner. People say thats the wrong way to loose weight that you'll actualy gain which is lie to me since I lost weight with this method. Now I am 15 and I still look at the back of every nutrition and I still avoid eatting breakfast. But I never felt recovered mentally. I still always try to be the best. Although I have many friends and I always tell them how beautiful they are even though I don't really mean it... I always wondered if people really did mean it? I am still a perfectionist that has not changed but I quit the starving. I realized that I'd never get a real relationship with someone until I loved myself. When I was starving people avoided me and I did not love myself. I missed my friends I was always so tired and it lowered my grades at school. I realized that my education was more important and my friends were more important then how I physically looked. When I told my mom about my problem she didn't take it seriously. She still dosen't. But the differnce from you and me is that you have actualy made yourself throw up, there is a differnce from actualy doing it and almost doing it. Once you do it once you can't stop. Its just like how you starve you do it again eventualy right? You say you can do this on your own, can you? I'm not saying you can't I dont know how strong you are since I dont know you personally. But your not strong enough to say no throwing up? I know you are going to refuse to get help but realize if it gets worse, the worse your permanent health is going to be. Eventualy its going to get so bad your going to get caught and be forced to get help. Wouldn't you rather get help being able to stand on your two feet and tell them out loud? Or would you rather be puking in a toilet passed out on the floor? I would rather stand up and go against it. Do you think you can honestly live with this secret for the rest of your life without telling anyone? If you really want to get better it has to stop today and now. It cant be tommarow, a week or a month. It has to be now. Tommarow you will eat breakfast, lunch and dinner. That is the only way you can get better on your own and if your that strong I hope the best for you.|`|BlHGarlHaa	bulemia.<br>  its suppose to be like an athlete's problem.....like wrestling.  they have to keep in a specific weight.  it just means that ur stomach is not timed right.|`|3SqtWtaxaa	bulemia.
1N73V2Ygaa	Hey!<br>  You sound a lot like me, last year. Yes you do have an eating disorder. I had the same thing. There are two types; anorexia and bulemia. Anorexia is where you starve yourself and excersize a lot, bulemia is where you binge on food and then use laxitives or throw up. An eating disorder is where food becomes the main priority and starts to control your life. Nothing else seems to matter except loosing weight. This is a very serious matter. You basically are slowly killing off your body. I would start by telling my parents, but I would also completely understand if you don't want to. Seeing a counsler or group therepy helps A LOT. Find a new interest to focus on. If you can afford it, horseback riding is a great one. It builds confidence, keeps you in shape, fun, and is a great form of therapy. Ever since getting help, I recommend anyone who has an eating disorder to get help A.S.A.P! Another thing is that if your friends are doing the same thing or supporting you, get new friends. Seriously, believe me on this one. Also, reading the book "Perfect" might help. I don't remember who it is by but you can find it at Barnes and Nobles.<br>  Good luck; I completely understand<br>  you can email me if you have any more questions.|`|WoR9Jyitaa	It definitely is an eating disorder.

It seems to be a form of anorexia.  You need to find out for yourself what your motives are for the eat-starve-eat cycle.  What does food mean to you?  What about your own body image?  What about how you feel about yourself in general?  Any problems going on in your life?  How can they be solved?

RXI8ImdIaa	What you are describing is not descriptive of diabetes.<br>  <br>  People with diabetes insipidus have a terrible, insatiable thirst all the time, and also have to urinate constantly.|`|WysJMdnWaa	that is possible, but don't get scared yet, try to see if you get sleepy alot or feel dizzy. Those are somethings that happend when ur diabetic|`|1w3k29iuaa	i am diabetic myself, and this does not sound like diabetes. as for the other two people who have answered that diabetics do experience extreme thirst constantly as well as urinating constantly is also false.<br>  <br>  but, for you, i just think that you just feel thirsty at times. if you were to be diabetic you would be experiencing other things as going to the bathroom more than you normally would, weight loss, blurred vision, vomiting, and way more. <br>  <br>  but, for the other two who have answered, i say they are wrong about the whole drinking and peeing constantly. i have been a type 1 diabetic for twelve years now, and i dont drink gallons a day, and i seriously dont pee like a horse. its all about maintaining your blood sugar levels well to balance it out. high blood sugars will result in high thirst and frequent urinations as good blood sugars will result in about a normal amount of thirsts and peeing. yedig?|`|c8ebe8705eaf13a28547213ca1de8013aa	No that does not sound like diabetes.  When you say that diabetics 'drink a lot of water' we are talking about very large amounts - not a 'whole glass of water'.  If you wake up with a dry throat it is perfectly normal to drink a glass of water.  Most people who wake up with a dry mouth have been 'mouth breathing' while asleep.  The body prefers us to breathe through our nose.  Thus the most common cause of mouth breathing is swelling within the nose which is extremely common.  If you physician looks in your nose they will be able to determine with certainty whether or not this is the problem.  Swelling in the nose is treated with inhaled nasal corticosteroids.  These are quite safe as only an insignificant amount is absorbed into the body.  I wish you the very best of health.|`|oBDkKdA4aa	here is an article on diabetes, maybe it'll help you:<br>  <a href="http://danistac.blogspot.com/2009/02/diabetes-in-nutshell.html" rel="nofollow">http://danistac.blogspot.com/2009/02/dia...</a>|`|ZNbauLJzaa	We'rea all a little dehydrated when we wake up.  To drink water when you wake up is normal.|`|cebad5b46077e5b2866e0817f2c2e8caaa	No.  The thirst that is associated with diabetes is all the time.  And thus you go to the bathroom constantly as well.  Just being thirsty when you wake up  is most likely because you sleep with your mouth open and possibly breath through your mouth the whole night.  After 8 hours, anyone's throat would be dry. <br>  <br>  Below is information regarding diabetes symptoms.|`|UediSxFbaa	With diabetes it is common for one of the first symptoms to be extreme thirst, but this is usually litres of water, rather than a glass. <br>  <br>  it sounds like you might be sleeping with your mouth open to breathe and as a result your throat is drying out as you are sleeping. <br>  <br>  A whole glass of water is not unusual and not a bad thing.|`|QyxTipSWaa	No,It is not diabetes and it's perfectly normal to drink alot of water.

AFi5kTiEaa	You need to find some type of exercise you like, and keep at it...forever and you will be less likely to gain weight.  Can you join a gym?  I find getting out of the house to do exercise really helps and I am more inclined to do it.  I find exercise videos very boring and i hate doing them.  I will do it for a week or two, get bored and quit.  If you go to a gym ther are so many different things to do so you can switch it up and you dont get so bored.  You have to make exercise a part of your daily life and just do it!<br>  <br>  Dont try and look good for your boyfriend, do it for YOU!  you will gain confidence and look and feel better about yourself.|`|2PfY0Neiaa	I went through the same thing. Its very frustrating.  But don't do it for your boyfriend but for yourself. Your boyfriend loves you the way you are trust me. I told my boyfriend I wanted to look good for him and that caused us to discuss how he loves me the way I am. Hearing it is one thing but feeling it for yourself is completely different. My advice is forget the videos because they only are helpful when you are in the mood. Working out isn't suppose to be easy but a life style. My best advice for you is to either find a track and walk a lap, then run one, walk then run... Bleachers are also a good workout. They really help. Another suggestion is join a gym. They have lots of different options. <br>  Good Luck!
eIjiI0M8aa	TMJ problems are normally sent to an oral surgeon. The oral surg. can decide if you need to have surgery to correct your problem. The dr you saw made the right decision in giving you meds to reduce the inflammation. They probably need that to be better before they can see you at the oral surgeon's office. Good luck. I have it too and I feel the need to pop my jaw often. Yuk but it feels good when I do it.|`|zw6EJ2izaa	Well, the joint can become inflamed from other less serious problems associated with chewing or jaw movements.  It is more likely to be something less serious and he is prescribing something that will help inflammation until it heals.  Temporomandibular joint disorder is the oh-**** scenario if the inflammation doesn't go away.|`|9p6HIu2raa	Temporomandibular Joint Disorder = TMJ.  An inflammation in your joint is basically the same as arthritis, etc.  It means your joints are having trouble.  They'll creak and cause pain.  The reason he's not sending you to an oral surgeon is that the only way to "fix" TMJ is to break your jaw and reset it.  You don't want them to do it.|`|RPoFBenJaa	Its otherwise known as TMJ.

This is 'standardized treatment' and he isn't trying to 'mask' the symptoms at all.  Surgery to the jaw joints can do far more damage than it fixes, so the inflammation must be 'reduced' as much as possible before the oral surgeon can go 'in' and start 'grinding on the bone' ... believe me, you'll be much happier if you don't have to have the surgery!|`|PogMq7Pcaa	temoprary what?|`|LCMCrmQTaa	TMJ is described as a cracking and painful noise in the jaw. Unless all other treatments fail, surgery is often not required. You should get a second opinion, unless you are in severe pain.

oE0ApHqPaa	Wow, even Drysol didn't work?  I know it stings and itches, but did you use it like you were supposed to?  I had to use it for a week or two to notice a difference, but after that I only had to use it once every 4 weeks or so.  It is worth the discomfort.  If you followed the instructions and it still did nothing, you need to speak to your doctor again, and if he won't take you seriously, get a second opinion.  Have they figured out why you are sweating excessively?  You should have your thyroid hormone levels checked, excessive sweating is how I found out I had a thyroid problem.<br>  <br>  There are treatments like Botox injections and surgical removal of sweat glands, and I think you may need to discuss these with your doctor.

I also don't pee during the day (ewww, school bathrooms lol), so when I got home I saw and I freaked out, I don't know why, I guess although I had waited a long time, I had just stopped expecting it. So I grabbed pads from the closet, and told my mom I had to change my pants because they were too tight. I told my mom the next morning, and she was like o.k.

Then my younger brother overheard and wanted to know what we were talking about and what a period was lol.  that was kinda embarassing and funny.|`|qEPr0FOCaa	I got mine in school, and of course I try not to use gross school bathrooms, and I mean I felt something, but ignored it. So I got home and showed my mom my pants when I took them off and all she did was stand there with my disgusting stained pants in her hands crying. And there I was, probably 12 or 13 and I was thinking "what is she cryin about? its just my period!" Hahah|`|Ql5fgVtBaa	I got my period in 5th grade when I was using the restroom in school.

My mom comes downstairs and hears me sniffling in the dark. And she's asked what was wrong and I said I was bleeding. And she asked where. And I said 'down there'  So my mom yelled and was told me to get off her couch and I ran into the bathroom and she handed me one of her pads.

VtqdeSQ8aa	Not any more than sitting burns in general. The extra you lose is water weight from sweating.|`|vv2uk9hHaa	Nope, not at all. You'll loose a lot of water though. But you'll just gain that "weight" right back up as soon you drink something. Sorry. A cold room, on the other hand, will make you burn more calories as your body has to produce more heat to keep you alive. But it is still a trivial amount. It won't make you loose pounds. Maybe a few milligrams a year.|`|iebJqJ4Naa	No it just feels great

249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 What’s so funny about bovines? If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?|`|8e78ab3e9f61fd825a86ea5e1c7c2e92aa	Exercise or jog 30 mins daily. Eat smaller portions.

wa3AvezGaa	Based upon your current weight, I think you should be more concerned with your self-esteem than your waist line.  It doesn't sound like you need to lose any weight.  If you insist on losing weight, try to work diet changes and exercises into your lifestyle rather than attempting some crazy short term planned starvation.|`|4zQEvzCsaa	Sweetie, you could eat 1000 calories and still lose weight! 500 isn't enough to keep your body functioning each day. This diet I'm on at the moment says avoid carbs and up your protein and you'll lose at least 3kgs (6.6lbs) a week and it's been working so far! Cut out bread, potatoes, fast foods and whatever else is high in carbs (get one of those carb counter books to help and get whatever has 10gms of carbs or less. If you eat meat (I'm vego, so I don't) up your meat intake, but go for chicken as opposed to red meat because the fat levels are much lower. And go for your life with vegies and salads! Hope I helped!|`|2jMFurDoaa	technically you could ....if you add up all the calories ....<br>  <br>  but your body would more then likely hold on to every calorie you eat at first because your body is starving so you wouldnt lose anything.<br>  <br>  eat 1200 calories a day, health wise they tell you not to eat less than that... and exercise like you normally do.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|JGNgdbVcaa	no and i repeat NO<br>  if you want to lose weight, eat regular ammounts of calories.<br>  if you dont have enough energy (which you get from calories), you cant burn off fat.<br>  the average 18-35 year old should have at least 1500 calories a day. but lay off the major calorie bulks like whoppers or quarter pounders.<br>  i've never eaten one in my life, and i weigh 103 lbs. and im 5'2''|`|XKYP0sGQaa	It's possible, but I can't say you will for sure.

Most likely your body would go into starvation mode and soon as you eat normally right after your body would store everything it could as fat.

GvQHw4Ntaa	A desire to gain weight is a terrible reason to start taking birth control, unless you also need it for contraceptive purposes. And the amount of weight you might gain varies from person to person... depending on the relative amounts of hormones in the pill and the natural chemistry of the person, some people may even lose weight on the pill.

If you were to look at a muscle anatomy picture, you will find that what we call love handles are simply our gluteus medius which goes up and connects to the external obliques and goes down to and forms the gluteus maximus which is connected to your lats. Doing the following will help with the entire area to tighten and tone up your muscles and help burn the fat around them. Hope all of this helps do lunges, step-up kickbacks, walking downhill, running, leg raises without weight or very light weight, yoga, push ups, lat pull downs, pull ups rowing, and deadlifts.

I take Sundays off to rest and relax. Push pull for example is doing triceps extension with or without a break then doing biceps curls and adding reverse or regular crunches in there to make sure I get abs in and it cuts down on time. I do abs a lot to keep my core strong. I try to get all of the muscles in that area to work together on the same day. Do the amount of weight for what you want to accomplish. Say for toning, lightweight and high reps (15-20) and 3-4 sets. To build muscle, 2-3 sets and 10-12 reps. All beginners need to start with 1-2 sets and 8-10 reps with lightweights. Remember to stretch after your workout to keep from cramping up.10-15 minutes of stretching is optimal.

b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	Hon, this is not like when your friend gets a new cell phone and you wish you had one too.  You want it because it is a step toward being a grown woman and all of your friends are talking about this period thing and you don't fit in.  Not unusual to want to be like your friends and do the things that they do.  But this is different than anything else your friends have and you don't.  Each girl's body develops hormones at a different level.  Maybe your friends are taller or weigh more and that is why they have developed their hormones before you.  If you have pubic and underarm hair for over a year and have discharge, you may be close, but girls start anywhere from 9 to 17 years old and all are normal.  If your friends had cancer and were talking about it, would you want that too? <br>  <br>  You might be careful what you wish for.  Once you start, for the next 40 years you will have 3-10 days out of every month that you bleed from your vagina.  You have to deal with pads and sometimes smell.  You have to run to the bathroom at school and check between classes to make sure you haven't bled on your clothes.  What you should really be doing right now is doing the happy dance because you don't have periods yet.  Once they come, they aren't like the cell phone, you can't just wish they would go away and get rid of them.  <br>  <br>  So be happy for now and know that if you are female, you will not escape having periods.<br>  <br>  best wishes..|`|QJHE3z1raa	first off, <br>  nothing will make it faster<br>  <br>  and second off,<br>  you wont want if after you get your first one.<br>  its not fun<br>  <br>  and third just tell her or an aunt or sister|`|muHctmaGaa	There are ways to induce your period after you've already begun menstruating (like with parsley), but not for your situation. That is, unless you cannot have a period due to physical activity or being underweight, in which case the solution is obvious.<br>  <br>  Not everyone's parents make such a big deal out of it. Just tell her you started your period; she's used to it for herself so it's not embarrassing or anything. You're sending mixed signals in that you want something you're nervous or ashamed of. Why do you want to start your period in the first place? To fit in? To grow up? That's all subjective. I started in FOURTH GRADE, and as a woman with no plans to ever reproduce, it's annoying and useless.|`|6gthdHpnaa	There really isn't anything you can do. You'll probably get it soon if you've had discharge for 1-2 years but you never can tell. It's not fun, I know the pad companies make it look fun on commercials, but it's not.<br>  About talking to your mom...it's not like you're telling her something abnormal about you. She is expecting this to happen, she knows it's going to happen to you. She isn't going to say anything bad or anything, she'll just probably buy you some pads/tampons/wipe thingys. <br>  Just say, "Mom, I need to talk to you," or even just, "Mom, I got my period,"|`|EnYLhQajaa	Some signs you should look out for are a lot of clear, stringy discharge (usually comes 2 days before first period). You're period may start out as brown discharge, so don't be alarmed. Before I got mine, I was so scared it would NEVER come.

vUC4ioB2aa	a yawn is a reflex of inhalation and exhalation that draws more oxygen into the bloodstream.<br>  <br>  One likely explanation is that the yawning reflex is triggered when our blood needs more oxygen.

WX7pUlepaa	There are differences in opinion on this one. Certainly, people have believed for centuries that retaining flatulence is bad for the health. Emperor Claudius even passed a law legalizing farting at banquets out of concern for peoples' health.  There was a widespread belief that a person could be poisoned or catch a disease by retaining farts. <br>      Doctors I have spoken to recently have told me that there is no particular harm in holding in farts. Farts will not poison you; they are a natural component of your intestinal contents. The worst thing that can happen is that you may get a stomach ache from the gas pressure. But one doctor suggested that pathological distention of the bowel could result if a person holds in farts too much.|`|iZk9jEBpaa	It can't be good for your stomach someone even told me it can cause a heart attack..lol|`|KC5vBg4uaa	As long as you're not in an unpressurized airplane.  Many pilots in WW2 died from holding in farts in unpressurized airplane cockpits.<br>  <br>  So as long as you're not in a plane in which the oxygen masks have dropped showing there is low pressure, you should be fine.<br>  <br>  But it is probably best to just let rip.  If you need to, spread your cheeks and just let it slip out without you pushing to mute the sound.  That's what I do in school.|`|Bg3lbGR1aa	I don't think you can die or become extremely ill but I know that it must be super uncomfortable to hold in excess gas because you're afraid to let out a stink bomb. If your farts smell like sulfur than perhaps you need to make changes to your diet.<br>  <br>  Gas is made up of air that is swallowed and air that is caused during the digestive process, so it has to find a way out and it can either be by burping or farting. <br>  <br>  If you are that uncomfortable farting in public then excuse yourself, and find yourself an isolated spot/bathroom. for more privacy. <br>  <br>  Just some fun facts about farting:<br>  ? On average, a fart is composed of about 59 percent nitrogen, 21 percent hydrogen, 9 percent carbon dioxide, 7 percent methane and 4 percent oxygen. Less than 1 percent of their makeup is what makes farts stink. <br>  ? The temperature of a fart at time of creation is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. <br>  ? Farts have been clocked at a speed of 10 feet per second. <br>  ? A person produces about half a liter of farts a day. <br>  ? Women fart as much as men.<br>  ? The gas that makes your farts stink is hydrogen sulfide. The more sulfur rich your diet, the more your farts will stink. Some foods that cause really smelly farts include: beans, cabbage, cheese, soda and eggs.<br>  ? Most people pass gas about 14 times a day.|`|oenwiCepaa	Holding them never bothered me.  I am an anal person though.  I let it go outside.|`|Pst0TRQVaa	i think it is bad for your health but im not that sure...
VEfh03cAaa	It sounds kind of like what I did to mt knee. I'm not exactly sure, but this may help. When I played soccer a couple years ago and popped my knee and ended up moving the tendon out of place, then continued playing my season on it and ended up shredding the tendon. I had arthroscopic surgery and had the shredded part of the tendon removed. After that I developed arthritis in my knee, but now I run rack and all my muscles are really strong so I have no more pain beacuese my muscles are taking the beating so to speak instead of my bones.|`|zF1MRdUFaa	you probably just tore something and it will have to scar over.. it will take time but will get better.|`|eIjiI0M8aa	You probably tore a ligament or tendon. In case you don't know, those are what hold your joints together. You probably didn't break a bone, as they said but the ligament or tendon problem can hurt for a very long time! You may have to have surgery. Good luck!
L63BRwXbaa	well, not every girl can squirt, andif your GF does every time, than something is goin right for you, live it up|`|5PErLg6Daa	Marquis, yours is the easiest by far of all of the female ejaculation questions and i love to provide this answer for you or anyone. Are you ready:  <br>  <br>  Almost all women can ejaculate.  Just like almost all men can ejaculate.  It is because of the male controlled medical science that it remains a medical problem if women expel fluid during sex. Until recently they call it some level of urinary incontinence, of late more doctors and sexologists have been consistent with the  reality that women can and may prefer to ejaculate.<br>  <br>  Take an imaginary trip with me if you would...<br>  <br>  If your woman was touching and kissing you. All over your body. From head to toe. Your ears, neck, your chest, every millimeter of your arms and hands, your chest, then she works your belly button area just brushing your pubes. You are hard as a rock.  Now, she raps around and does your sides and up and down your legs, never touching your dick.  then she licks the top of your dick where it meets your abs. the part where it is not really sensitive. she leaves the underside alone.  she rubs the head just with the tip of her tongue and allows no friction to the underside.  your get to the point that you cant handle the anticipation any more because it feels so good its is driving you wild, but not causing you to ***!!!  <br>  <br>  Your would stop her and and switch opting for intercourse and blowing your load, or correct her or something, but the truth is she would have been successful in turning you on sexually.  <br>  <br>  she truly made u climax.  <br>  <br>  but to us, as men, if climax dose not conclude with ejaculation we are beyond frustrated.  <br>  <br>  THAT IS HOW MEN LEAVE THEIR WOMEN MOST OF THE TIME!!<br>  <br>  NOT YOU!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Under the extremely rare situation that her man dose not mortify her into believing she had peed on him!  <br>  <br>  Any woman that has learned the mechanism of her body that allows her to ejaculate, will always continue.  That woman will learn to repeat the feelings needed to get to the point of ejaculation. <br>  <br>  I tell female students that once they have learned to control their orgasm. That they can start to pre ejaculate and soak the sheets simply from getting their necks licked and their clit touched.  The G-Zone orgasm is just the reality of anatomy.  Their g-zone in the vagina is the same as the bottom of our penis.  These areas are where proper friction causes ejaculation in both men and women.  But as all men know we can defiantly get pretty sticky on the end of our urethra and wet just from our girl doing very little to us.   <br>  <br>  The Squirt Doctor

IGYa2yF6aa	Technically, the answer is no, because breasts are made of fat. However, you can tone up the muscle underneath the breasts and that can help quite a lot to make the breasts appear firmer and a little larger. The best exercise machine for that is the "Pec Deck". Do 3 sets of 10 reps each. Without a machine, pushups are best (same number of reps). Do inverted pushups with your feet or knees on a bench to firm the upper part of your chest. Flat pushups get the center of your chest.|`|1HbMf5Vpaa	talk to a doctor|`|WHN5cuGZaa	depends if they are saggy it could help.. if there ok then it might stiff them up a little :D
mAZi1eH7aa	No. The more you use, the more you need. The more you weigh, the less you need till you have evened your metabolism. Once balanced, it will be an even intake and out put, provided you balance your diet.|`|9ebe04169d04d9c952a946440b3ad139aa	Despite popular opinion, heavy people have a faster metabolism than lighter ones, because of all the extra weight they have to carry around. They do burn calories faster!|`|f3c8a5f174ca386a6855ce97b71adbfbaa	True. A heavier person burns more calories because they are moving more weight when exercising.
PO5Q7POuaa	Well the age a girl should wear a tampon is dependent on when she started mensturating. I believe it is recommended to wait at least one year after your first period before using tampons, but probably the longer you wait wouldn't hurt since tampons aren't a necessity. When a girl does start to wear tampons she should start at the lowest possible abosrbency level and she must remember to change it every couple of hours and to have clean hands while doing so as to help prevent getting Toxic Shock Syndrome. Always if you're not sure you could talk to a trusted adult female or a doctor. <br>  Hope I helped =)|`|hNa5oHxQaa	12|`|Kb0p6mcJaa	i startedm uh period when i was 10. <br>  i never ever ever used a paddd.<br>  they were super ickyyu dont have to have sex to use them despite wat they say.|`|k6x2lVLYaa	Any age is okay once you get your period, but it depends on when you feel ready too. Some girls don't get used to it until they start having sex . . . <br>  <br>  It doesn't matter what brand, to me, they're all the same. <br>  but; you might wanna try with ultra small, and wear a panty liner under it. It's what I do. <br>  <br>  <br>  For me, I could easily use them at age twelve, for some girls it will start to hurt. It all depends, you can try them, if you don't like it, don't worry.<br>  <br>  <br>  We're all unique, so don't base yourself off of other people and how there cycles, etc work.

I'm a virgin and I use Playtex Sport. If you feel comfortable using them then go ahead. Tampons really aren't as bad as they seem, trust me I was terrified to use them and now I think they are a piece of cake. Good luck! :)|`|hfqUp1IBaa	The easiest to use and my #1 brand is Tampax Pearl.  Make sure that you use a tampon to the flow of your period.  You can use them whenever your period comes at any age just read the safety insert!|`|WTLbP5hDaa	You should wear it at least the age of 16, because your more mature from when your are 13. And it dosent reallly matter what brand it is, i just get the cheapest ones and it still works from the most expensive ones. And it dosent hurt for me, and im still a virgin.|`|Sdm9Xqpraa	when i 1st got my period i wore pads but i felt discomfort like everyone could see it. an there really messy 2 deal with. so tampons are way easier. but then some people get headaches and nausea when they use them which is a sign of tss (toxic shock syndrome). so think before you use them. an if your a virgin u might wanna think about using a smaller size like regular. sometimes the bigger ones can break ur hymen. good luck!|`|hLswVIG5aa	When you're ready, and it doesn't have anything to do with virginity, I'm 15, I using them and I'm virgin!!...

8iHbDmHmaa	Work out.  Your whole body.  Target training really doesn't work.  Meaning, you could do 1000 sit ups a day and lose weight off your thighs.  Bodies are wierd that way.  Cardio is a great way to burn off calories, and weight lifting will help your whole body get toned and fit.<br>  <br>  Crunches, pushups, burpies, tricep dips, squats, jumping jacks, these are all things that you can do at home that work really well.|`|rObWC2ajaa	Targetted weight loss is quite tough, some would say impossible, but the sole diet that clearly showed results for me is wu-yi tea, it can be checked out in the resource box underneath, they have a handful of free trials in stock, it was highlighted in Fox News and CNN. I shed 25 pounds, it clearly does produce results!
kZHy4XGWaa	yes stress can cause late period though how long you havent had it depends. you  could possibly be pregnant just take the test now before it's too late.|`|AA10988719	I guess at 20 you know that condoms can break or malfunction -- if  you ever watch "FRIENDS" that is how Rachel and Ross conceived.  However, if you are under a lot of stress that could change onset of your cycle and how regular it is.  I don't know you or your lifestyle but I recall from way back when I was in high school that excessive exercise could delay or eliminate your cycle as could being anorexic.  However, there are other health concerns that could be affecting it, such as diabetes, obesity and thyroid problems.  I am referencing this article to you as a starting point.  If you are still concerned check with your OB/GYN.|`|BIyiOgPYaa	Stress will absolutely delay your period.|`|aCLqYRtEaa	yes  it can... but take the test! good luck:)|`|B06MKPbfaa	yes stress can delay your period or soemtiems makes you skip it
vRxx6Oegaa	Drug use despite negative consequences. Physical symptoms are very minor compared to emotional problems. An addict may be aware of their problem and want to stop, but the drug keeps telling them to come back essentially. The drug becomes a necessity, much like food, water, and air. Some methamphetamine addicts will not eat or drink water, instead they will seek out another fix. It is a powerful grip that the person has on their life, and many cannot quit, thus causing them to use more and more.|`|lLC7Cf2zaa	You want to know what the symptoms of addiction to methamphetamine are?  hmm... well, it would probably show up in the withdrawal symptoms... so look for that...  like shakes, temperature regulation problem, muscle aches, heart rate and blood pressure problem, eye dilation abnormal, wanting to get some more... (joke)   That's when you know someone is addicted - withdrawal... and needing more and more to get the same kind of high as before because your body gets used to the previous level... until one day you get used a high level, then stop it for a few days, maybe you run out, and try it at the high level again.. and your body isn't used to it anymore... and well, you're pushing up daisies.

GkmeJuwzaa	Seriously, try FiberOne products. Their original cereal you kinda have to get used to, but it has the most fiber and lease calories. But some of their other flavors are almost as good. And also their snack bars or whatever are super yummy. They have a TON of flavors. Also of course eat lots of fruits and veggies! Hope I helped! :D

You cant undo sex. Its like if your pet dies, its something irreversible. Now if you dont have sex for a long time then all that happens is that your vagina stays "tight" which guys like. But other than no you cant undo something like that only if you go back in time and tell yourself not to have sex.|`|tWePoJYNaa	No, you can't grow a new hymen, sorry. As for surgery, I don't think that's impossible, but I don't think that's a real procedure either. I doubt any doctor would do that either. People make mistakes.

They are fleeting whispers of an all-prevading, subtle, non-expressive potential reality.<br>  ..or..<br>  The word Verginity has only what meaning you give it. In "loosing" your virginity..something that woman practically give a life of its own...You are actually learning of a new experience. You can not unlearn intercoures. There are other differences, such as the breaking of that small amount of mucous membrane called the hymen. I have no idea if there is a surgical method of replacing the hymen..but even if i wouldn't recomend the prosegure due to the other effects of sex for the first time. The actuall act of sex is like a ticking time bomb of chemicals and hormons that are relesed throughout your body, signalling your mature starte of growth and our readyness to bear offspring. <br>  If you have not had sex for many years then it is likly you have forgotten most of the physical & emotional aspects of intercourse. And belive me, the next time you do have sex you will probably wish you didnt forget seeing as sex can be akward for even the most season'd player/play'et the first time round with a new partner. <br>  So dont worry so much about it, and if you cant stop thinking about it and you find you cant let go of that primative crutch, then read and reread the first statment I wrote. That is one of the smartest things i have ever come across. Look up each word, and look up thier base words, trully grasp all that those two simple sentances have to offer. it will change your life..<br>  Lastly...if this is all just so your boyfriend can experience sex with a virgin, just hold some plastic wrap down thier and let him push through it. lol He can have sex with a virgin everytime..and dont for get some fake blood and lots of painful faicial jestures. might wana cry a little to. <br>  Good luck!|`|UlXQocWWaa	No because surgery would only take the physical existence away but the mental feeling will always be there.

I don't understand what you mean by surgery but basically i would stick to the definition but you can consider yourself whatever you want to be. Some people might consider that being a virgin or not. Honestly its all opinion.|`|0s2ds5guaa	No|`|f79674f11cb0d8833ea9b2f32ce01461aa	You're five years old, aren't you?|`|9vCI33O0aa	umm...no|`|uDSXv5Fbaa	no|`|82n7jtvVaa	sorry but that dont make no sense once u lose it its gone but hey im only 14|`|3SxFytziaa	um no. i don't think so.
BRDqfAy3aa	it is symptoms of puberty development - read below|`|b418f2cdb879b4a8266bb262f2fee70daa	Yes - all sound like puberty|`|BwUSAXxqaa	From the signs in your symptoms, it would seem that puberty is the most likely cause of your problems. Itchy and sore breasts are sometimes caused by a hormone imbalance and irregular hormone levels due to the sudden changes when arriving at puberty. This can also cause acne on the face, back and chest. Stress levels also contribute to this effect.|`|Jqve5UPlaa	Ah yes I got that too don't worry about it! I think, as you know, it's just puberty. Take some painkillers and try your best not to scratch them!<br>  xo.|`|87nG6aKaaa	i think you are just about to get your period thosse are sign <br>  welcome to womanhood!!!!!!!!!! :)|`|2YHpV9koaa	how old r u? probably growing pains|`|BD0L3JcHaa	most likely yea. sounds similar to my case. i have those "spots" as u call them are pimples. or acne. and i wish i would have known this before i got them so im telling u now so u dont have to suffer like i do. start washing ur face everyday if u dont already the longer u wait to start washing ur face the worse ull have it.|`|A4KYtiNnaa	its puberty hun
dM1jwSGyaa	I used to have this problem too. Drink LOTS and LOTS of water. Eat tons of fruit. Stock up on gum. And listen to music or watch tv so you forget that you're hungry. Good luck!|`|wYrS24e2aa	calm down, alright well what is your status right now? are you skinny, a little chubby or heavy? because if you're skinny and you're obsesses with weight then you have anorexia. but if you're like the rest of america and like food a little too much then thats a fixable problem. I know food tastes good but it could also be for some other reason. You see some people eat too much food because they like the taste alot. Others eat to consol themselves. For example you got picked on at school and you turn to food to feel better. Or you broke up with your boyfriend and you started eating alot of icecream. Things like that. But whatever your reason if your goal is to lose weight then just figure out how many calories does your body need and just minues about 500 a day and you should be alright. I'm pretty sure an avg female calorie need is around 1200-1300 for your most basic needs -food absorbtion, to keep organs alive etc. But if you walk around and go to school like normal people than you probably need around 1900-2000 calories. And if you were to be physically active/play a sport or ride a bike everyday than that number would go up to around 2300 calories. So just figure out which one is you. And then just eat around 300-500 calories less. helpful point- never go below your basic calorie needs 1200/1300. because then your body goes into starvation and every calorie you consume gets stored as fat. But try to do some type of exercise ride a bike, walk 30min a day. Something to keep you active during the day. As far as eating the calories you eat should come from clean food- fish/chicken, broccoli, other vegetables, and healthy carbs like fruit or sweet potato. All of these foods should not be cooked with any type of oil. Better to just boil everything. If you'd like more advice just email me and I can make some sort of exercise/nutrition plan southsiders69@yahoo.com but you should be alright with the tips I give here, good luck|`|iPwmyRYFaa	chew gum|`|OEi0BoeEaa	stop shoving food in your mouth and pick up a hobby or also you could control your self and keep your hands with the food away from your mouth|`|JmCY7Bnnaa	keep busy by doing stuff.. like sports<br>  <br>  somtimes i feel like im hungry but im not.

I would recommend moral support, and some inspiration.  I think the best way to control your diet is to obtain a good workout regiment.  Whether is be sports, p90x, jogging, yoga, martial arts, or whatever it may be try to go online and get inspired to work out  and i believe it will make you control what you eat.  <br>  Good luck|`|VwGhlh6Faa	Are you near your period because that's what happens sometimes... just when you're hungry just eat fruit and yogurt and healthy stuff... I would go to the gym because you're digestive system might be out of whack, so when you eat, it seems like you are always hungry... drink lots of water, not too much or else you will throw-up. Just have maybe 2 water bottles a day and you should be having to go to the bathroom a lot, which means a faster metabolism!!! YAY!!!! Good luck and remember, when in doubt don't pig out! =)|`|bUlfS1vyaa	try to exercise, drink alot of water, try giving up soda, sooner you'll find out is not that hard, I was in a similar situation, now I gave up soda and I lost almost 35 pounds.|`|E8MkLTjdaa	drink a lottt of water. usually when i feel like eating a bunch i just try to get out of the house and take a run. for me, running is just as good a way to deal with stress as food is.|`|SogS1WzYaa	easy - stop eating. just STOP. think about what starving kids in africa have to go through- then you wont be so depressed. its all mental, nothing else.<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|yYBMYMwZaa	Find something else to do with your time other than eating

One thing you can do is to be more active. Walk more. Go to the gym. Maybe get a trainer or at least get one training session on how to use the gym machines. But most importantly introduce more physical activity into your life.|`|flnYvE4vaa	Weight watchers. I know it sounds soooo dumb but seriously they go by points. Its easy, especially for a 15 year old. Go online and read about it. They have meetings like 2 or 3 times a week? you only have to go once a week and they have a group for youth about your age. Go there and try it out.

BRDqfAy3aa	you an use any kind of menstrual hygienic products just it should be comfortable for you - see below - different menstrual hygienic products and everything about tampon insertion|`|A4bdvg1Yaa	no, i'm 14 & Do not use them.<br>  they're not for everyone.|`|44e9OFjPaa	no its not weird. I used tampons for a few years but then It was so much confortable with pads. because tampons leak and they sometimes go all the way into your body, if you forget to change it every 3 to 4 hours. where with pads you just change it ever 4 to 5 hours depending on your period flow. and certain pads like the super thin always are so confortable and it feels like your not wearing pads. its not weird at all, not a big deal. its same as boxers or briefs, pads or tampons.|`|muHctmaGaa	Not necessarily. I generally didn't like the idea of shoving chemicals up there (in the bleached and scented tampons) and used pads until I was 19. <br>  If it hurts, you're probably inserting with the wrong angle, and you might want to run water lightly over the applicator at first to lubricate it.|`|lMxIbTQZaa	We're like twins!<br>  Haha. Except I haven't even tried tampons yet. I'm far too terrified. I have a low tolerance for pain, so I just stick to pads for now. I know I'll eventually wear tampons, but why rush? Pads work just fine.|`|fEKCRmv8aa	not weird at all. I don't think I really started using tampons until I was about 20.. and I still don't use them when I'm sleeping.|`|2YHpV9koaa	No!<br>  I don't use them either. Usually, older women seem to use them more. If you don't feel comfortable with it, don't do it. My mom started when she was married, my aunt still doesn't. Some are strongly against it. <br>  If you are going to, use extra small first! <br>  They are good when you do swimming and are good when you do curtain sports.<br>  And do not keep them in too long, this can lead to TSS which stands for Toxic Shock Syndrome, which is VERY serious.|`|sGhEl7YSaa	not weird at all. some girls/women prefer not to use them. Also you should consult you gyn b4 you use a tampon esp. at your young age, they can cause complications like toxic shock syndrome so it is probably best to avoid them anyway if you can. I am 30 and only use tampons if I happen to go swimming during that time of month. Hope this helps.|`|XIIGr5f2aa	i'm also 14. i've had my period for 1 year and i only wear tampons when i swim. they hurt me too, and i can always feel then. also, my grandma kinda freaked me out cause she told me this story about the first time she put one in she passed out. yeah. so i think you're normal. (:|`|sW3yg6m2aa	If they hurt then you probably aren't using them right.  It's not weird if you choose not to use tampons, but if you don't use them because they hurt, thats not normal.|`|XeEkpxXoaa	omg same! im 14 and ive had my period for 2 years! and i dont use tampons cause i cant get them in. lol so no ur not weird.|`|nFTyOWMCaa	No.just use pads.|`|6GWctkQzaa	No not really.<br>  but you HAVE to use one in the pool.|`|87nG6aKaaa	no it is not wierd|`|FIzN3VdBaa	It's a matter of preference, so it's not "weird" if you don't use them.. I mean, it might be weird if you don't use ANYTHING while on your period, but if you prefer pads to tampons, then nothing's wrong with that.<br>  <br>  If the tampon is hurting you, it probably isn't in correctly.  You shouldn't really be able to feel it.|`|yY6WOKLxaa	no. am 18 and i still prefer pads over tampons.<br>  they dont fit...lol<br>  everybodys body is diiferent.
m1TSG9Cvaa	I would suggest a cleansing diet. I lost 12 pounds in 9 days and then 28 pounds in less than a month. I also lost a lot of inches too!   I learned that cleansing will help the body get rid of toxins.  Toxins come from a lot of things like fast food, pollution, food additives and preservatives and lots of other things.  The toxins get stored in the fat in our body.  To get rid of the fat, we have to get rid of the toxins by cleansing the body.  This made sense to me and I decided to try a cleanse program and it worked.  The weight came off fast and this kept me motivated to keep going, not like other diets where the weight loss it too slow. I did Jenny Craig, Weight Watcher and Medifast.  If you want to learn more call the toll free number 1-877-587-4647 or check out the website.  This was the first time I ever did a cleanse, it was easy and I feel better.  Good luck whatever you decide to do!  <a href="http://thebestcleansingdiet.com" rel="nofollow">http://thebestcleansingdiet.com</a>

JG5vuPc4aa	Sounds like you don't believe you have a disease . . . but whether you do or not, you have to figure out how much calories you burn now (find a 'calorie calculator' in google) and then eat fewer calories than that . . as for breakfast, try some fruit or snack bars, just be sure to watch the calories!
ParFJxnSaa	Limit "worrying time" to around 45 mns, daily, possibly when you get home, or after your evening meal, but not too close to bedtime) after which, resolve firmly to refuse to worry again on that day: realise and accept that to do otherwise would be counterproductive to your mental health, and enjoyment of life. You will have had your "worry time" for the day, and can just write down any more thoughts that come to mind, and say to yourself: "Well, I'll just have to worry about that tomorrow, won't I?". It's important to regularly monitor, and deal with a negative internal monologue (self talk), or mental process, such as disturbing thoughts, images, impulses, or emotions, by the process of (a): recognising it, and (b): challenging it immediately. Technique For Re-Programming Negative Thoughts: When you notice something negative, such as: "I can't do this/ am never going to get over this!" or: "Why am I always so pathetic/useless/such a loser?" or even an image, emotion, or a memory; recognise that it is being generated from the negative part of your mind. Having identified and labelled it, visualise a large, red, flashing, "STOP!" sign, and/or possibly a stern faced person wagging an index finger at you in a negative manner, then say to yourself as forcefully as you can, even aloud in a big voice, if alone: "I know this tactic: GO AWAY FOR A WHILE !!!" You may want to use either: "ruse", "ploy", "game", or "trick". In the case of an image, visualise a large "STOP" sign, or your preferred version. <br>  <br>  Some people go so far as to keep a wide rubber band in their pocket, then put it around their wrist, when they catch themselves backsliding, stretch and release it, as a method of reprogramming their mind sooner, but I don't regard it as being strictly necessary. Remember to remove it, afterwards, if you use this method. Try replacing a negative thought with a positive affirmation of your choice, like: "I am a unique individual, with my own set of skills, and good points", or "I may not be perfect, but I'm doing the best I can, right now". Practice one of the relaxation methods in sections 2, 11, 2c, or 2i, daily, and when needed. Tai Chi, or yoga suits others better. Give the EFT a good tryout, to see if it helps you. There is a version for use in public places, (you can claim to have a headache, as you massage/lightly tap your temples, but you would then be restricted to subvocalising: saying it to yourself in your mind). Section 53, at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> refers: "Even though I sometimes suffer from anxiety, I deeply and completely accept myself." Or Google: "neurofeedback; therapists" Herbal remedies, such as chamomile, passionflower, or St.John's wort, are often effective, but the idea is (as with anxiolytic medication) to use them like water wings, or training wheels on a bicycle, providing initial support, and giving time for other treatments, such as therapy, and relaxation techniques, to take effect.|`|LNnRSLdtaa	write things down<br>  i find i get a similar problem when im trying to sleep on a work night and im simply not tired<br>  il just keep going over useless things so now i keep a note book by my bed so that when i get a thought i just keep thinking about (like what time im going to leave the house etc or what time im meeting friends)i just write it down in there and it makes it easyer to settle down|`|SyyBtXFuaa	try meditating for a hour or so everyday it might help sit in a comfortable position and breath in through the nose out through the mouth and let go of everything|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	I used to do the same thing.I learned to trust the LORD.I do not worry anymore.|`|ug0FnKgeaa	Smoke Weed.

tkDfqjQdaa	Pepto Bismol will not stop you from throwing up in every instance, so yes you could.
RXI8ImdIaa	That's a good question.<br>  <br>  My prediction is if your doctor has written a prescription for blood glucose testing supplies (monitor, strips and whatnot) your insurance will probably pay for it.<br>  <br>  If you don't have a prescription, they are not likely to cover it.<br>  <br>  That's just my guess, you'll have to ask the insurance company directly.|`|zrKuaiDLaa	I really don't know... Go to their website for more information!<br>  I hope it helped!|`|ZNbauLJzaa	They may not cover the strips since "pre-diabetes" isn't a real medical condition.  You have diabetes or you don't.

Q4ggnG0waa	Cancer Treatment Centers of America, Inc., and two affiliated hospitals have agreed to settle Federal Trade Commission allegations that they made false and unsubstantiated claims in advertising and promoting their cancer treatments. The FTC alleged that the respondents could not back up claims, among others, that through certain specific procedures such as "whole body hyperthermia" and "brachytherapy," they were able to successfully treat certain forms of cancer unresponsive to conventional treatment. The respondents also allegedly failed to substantiate a claim that their five-year survivorship rate had ranked among the highest recorded for cancer patients.<br>  <br>  <br>  Please make sure she's taken care of by a qualified oncologist.<br>  <br>  Brian giving idiot answers sure does make your intelligence shine.

5d0506fe6f86fded69f53c9e28c5f779aa	These sound like tough corrections but I think I've seen Invisalign cases online that have adjusted most of these issues. You would likely need attachments on the overlapping teeth to help the clear trays grip the teeth. They are tooth colored bumps they add on some teeth. I personally have spaced out teeth and was just fitted for Invisalign. It is costing me $5000 which seems about standard for a 'full' correction case. This includes trays on both the top and bottom. I would imagine that is about what it would cost for you're case as well. If the treatment ends and everything is not completely straight you might have to pay for 'refinement' which is additional trays to help smooth out what wasn't perfectly fixed during the initial program. I have a blog I will be writing in to discuss everything I experience as I go through the treatment. I encourage you to read what I have written so far. <a href="http://my-invisalign.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://my-invisalign.blogspot.com/</a>

My own son suffers with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder he found that Emotion Regulation Therapy changed his life  His exact words were "I can't believe I'm feeling this good, and on a consistent basis. He completed the therapy almost a year ago and continues to enjoy the success in that therapy which is specifically designed for PTSD and those with Borderline Personality Disorder. Both have much of the same symptoms and are caused by trauma and this therapy may be something you want to discuss with your psychiatrist. By making your own blog you are doing something to help a lot of people and should be proud of yourself.|`|ParFJxnSaa	I suggest that you check out sections 33 - 34 on PTSD, at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> Consider having the new Propranolol therapy, or EMDR, as shown.
AFi5kTiEaa	it will help, but you should also start running.  Running will help burn any fat you have and the situps will build mussel and tone your tummy.  It is really hard to get a flat stomach.  You also have to diet to loose fat.  Not that you are fat, you just may have some in that area and diet, running and situps all done together will be your best bet.|`|DXJ6Ws8oaa	no you need to do an actual exercise routine.|`|WTASRbzAaa	woow. thats alotta situps!<br>  uum.. it probally will, but don't over do it.
iCUstJdNaa	I think it may have been the tan cream.  You also may have an allergy to a deodorant or perfume spray.  You must stop using these and try something gentle with no additives.  Try not to itch or you can make it bleed. If it doesn't improve you may need some anti histamines or some cream from your gp.  As itching is irritating and stressful.|`|bGcYp6oPaa	E45 xD|`|1WFJsAZUaa	oh got to the pharmacy and by magic ccream!!<br>  its magic.|`|aqdDFdm8aa	Try to make sure you lotion your skin well so that it is hydrated. Itching is caused by dry skin.  You might have a mild case of eczema. It can be taken care of just by making sure to lotion well after a shower because that is when all the moisture in your skin leaves. Why not try it. I use coca butter by Palmers-its the only thing that will work for me. Hope this helps don't forget to vote best answer!
c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	Exercise and make sure you get lots of calcium....|`|SsfnitjXaa	Never smoke (smoking prevents the bones from absorbing calcium before the age of 30)<br>  <br>  Walk!  (Running is too hard on your joints) Walk 30 minutes a day 30 days a week.<br>  <br>  Calcium tablets do not work (too little in each tablet)<br>  <br>  Stay away from all osteoporosis meds (unless you already have osteoporosis) they cause too many problems.|`|AGlpdpAKaa	Milk is actually NOT a good source of calcium.  humans have a hard time absorbing calcium from animal products.  you're better off getting your calcium from different fruits and vegetables.  just do a google search on "calcium food source" or "calcium fruit and vegetable source" and you should find a list.  <br>  <br>  north america has the highest milk consumption, yet also the highest rates of osteoporosis.  what does this tell you?  diets higher in fruits and vegetables and lower in diary and meats is better for you.  there's actually something about milk (the protein maybe?) that actually leeches calcium OUT of your body.  so you drink milk for the calcium, but end up losign more in the process.  try picking up some fortified rice milk.  i have fortified vanilla flavored Rice Dream.  it's got a TON of added stuff, but it's not hormone injected or an animal product.  nutrients are easily absorbed!|`|OiUxoqcPaa	It's more than just exercise and calcium.  If you live in a place that has a long winter (like north of the New York City latitude), you can't get enough Vitamin D naturally.  That's because you can only get it from being in the sun (without sun screen) for about 20 minutes a day,  And the sun isn't strong enough in northern latitudes most of the year.  Vitamin D works with calcium, and together they help bones rebuild.  Throughout your life, you should take vitamin supplements of Vitamin D and calcium.  Even more after menopause.  You can get vitamin D from fortified foods (like milk), but you can't realistically drink enough of it to get as much as you need.  Read up on line.  May go to webmd.com and learn about it. Good luck!|`|2wMMAKpOaa	Well osteoporosis is when your bones become brittle and breaks. To prevent bones for doing this and to keep them strong and healthy you need calcium. You can take pills for calcium, or dairy products have it as well. Ex milk, cheese, etc. Hope this helps :)
W2z5dCrmaa	There is a set of small glands near the base of the penis called the Cowper's glands. They produce a clear slippery fluid when a Dude gets sexually stimulated for a short time. These glands eject the fluid into his Dick and out it comes to make ready for slippery penetration. It's natures best lubricating fluid for making easy and comfortable penetration for sex.<br>  <br>  It's clean and totally natural and serves a really good purpose when real Love Making happens. They call it pre***m but it doesn't mean that a Dude is ready to *** .<br>  <br>  If you are this comfortable together already, it's really too bad that he felt embarrassed about it. Next time tell him to not worry about it and that it's OK!<br>  <br>  Some Dudes produce a small amount and others allot.

hgmexwtEaa	2 miles a day sounds like a good thing. Make sure you also change your eating habits into healthy ones and drink lots off water.<br>  <br>  At first, you should rapidly lose 10-20 pounds in month, or two weeks,(saying that you dont work out usually and you dont have very good eating habits), but then your wieght loss would slow to about only 1-3 pounds a week.<br>  So  you can put the nubers in and see how long that would take.<br>  <br>  happy weight loss! =]
WoR9Jyitaa	I know you said that you don`t exercise a lot, but I like dancing! I don`t really get the chance (or take the chance) to get out much, so when I have spare time..I just dance in my room by myself. Sounds competely crazy, but I lost like 10 pounds lately just doing that lately (and not eating late at night) Haha! As far as food, sorry to say, but natural, unprocessed foods are the best. Stay far away from trans and saturated fats and watch the sodium intake on the packages of food. I try to limit mine to about 1500 mg, so that I know my system can flush itself out better! And whenever taking apples and stuff like that seems weird..try applesauce in a squeezing tube (like the yogurt) or try carrots and dip. There`s always ways to spice things up, so it`s not like you are eating nothing.|`|XKYP0sGQaa	How do you feel about taking up exercise ? That would really help you to lose weight - and another bonus is that if you are exercising you can eat more to compensate for the calories that you are burning. <br>  <br>  If not, then really your only choice is to eat less then what you are eating now. Decrease your calorie intake.|`|atn30lRPaa	eat smaller proportions and since your not a exercising person try exercising at least 3 times a week better then nothing|`|1N73V2Ygaa	I'm a teen trying to loose weight too!<br>  Here are some tips:<br>  -EXCERSIZE! run at least 1/2 a mile or walk 1 mile a day. <br>  It is actually easy. Just walk home from school or something.<br>  - Drink water 30 minutes before you eat and you won't eat that much.<br>  -Drink water 24/7. it is healthy and keeps hunger away<br>  -Eat a big breakfast, small lunch, and small dinner before 6:30. After 6:30 your metabolism slows down.<br>  -If you do diet, make sure you excersize, because your metabolism adjusts when you eat less, making you gain weight. That really sucks.<br>  -If you eat oatmeal for breakfast, it is really healthy and will help you to not eat much more the rest of the day.<br>  Hope this helps! by!|`|CV2NPBMAaa	PUT DOWN THE FORK, LMFAO. <br>  nah, just kidding.

jPxkg7vKaa	Sometimes severe anxiety attacks can feel to a person like a heart attack. It's really not anything completely serious. Your symptoms increase when you panic about the "condition". <br>  <br>  Take some deep breaths, eat well and make sure to get plenty of sleep. For your headaches, try some tylenol. Nothing with caffeine, because this can make the symptoms worse.|`|GAHFiIqSaa	You have a ghost which is causing your symptoms.<br>  <br>  Think of the art you have seen that depict the saints. Their halos represent spirits, which is what you are feeling with respect to your "weird headache."  The "crawling" feeling is also this spirit. Basically, you have become a saint, and the spirit's presence is a blessing.<br>  <br>  Try talking to it with your thoughts (telepathy). Begin by thinking, "hello, are you there," or a similar type thought. You will hear its responses in your mind, as if they were your thoughts.|`|cebad5b46077e5b2866e0817f2c2e8caaa	If you have had tests done at the doctor (I am assuming they have done an EKG), then most likely nothing is wrong and it is just anxiety.  I know, I have the same problem.  I have very weird pains and unexplained symptoms that often feel like heart issues, but everytime I go in, there is nothing wrong with me.  <br>  <br>  But if you truly feel there is more going on or even just to allay your fears, you can ask for additional testing.  You are your own advocate.  Often you have to push the issue and say that you want them done.  Sometimes it does depend on your insurance and what they will cover for you, but even going to visit a cardiologist and get a stress test done is an option. <br>  <br>  After you have had blood work and a stress test, if they all come back normal, then just learn to manage anxiety better and see if that helps the symptoms.|`|RPoFBenJaa	Anxiety can be funny like that . The brain works in weird ways, and even though you may "feel" calm and relaxed you can still suffer from anxiety attacks. The feeling in your arms sounds a lot like restlessness, where you feel like something is crawling under your skin and you cant stop moving them. The best thing to do, to help you relax I think would be to try and meditate. I know it sounds stupid, and Im no hippie but my doctor reccomended this for me and it was very very helpful!

FicyC2TXaa	Most breast lumps aren't cancerous, and at your age they are almost certainly hormonal.<br>  <br>  The chances of breast cancer at 16 are close to zero; it's mainly a disease of ageing. 80% of those diagnosed are over 50, only around 5% are under 40 and 0.1% are under 30. It;s almost unheard of in under 25s.<br>  <br>  Wait a couple of weeks and if it's still there have it checked out to be on the safe side, especially as you've had problems before. - those of us who've had breast cancer are advised to follow the 'two week rule' - if we notice anything we're concerned about, wait two weeks and if the symptoms are still there, see a doctor.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile try not to worry about breast cancer - it's beyond unlikely that you have it.|`|34VXCyvVaa	Yes, it could be a cyst, but you can't get diagnosed online.

You can have a phobia of anything in the world. You can even be afraid of certain colors. A girl I was friends with in high school was afraid of white milk..no joke. She said something about it freaked her out bad and she wouldn't drink it. Although being afraid of mentally ill people isn't a normal fear, I can see why someone might be. Not to be rude either, but they can be loud, violent, and they can make odd noises and faces and can drool and do other things that are not normal behavior. I've seen autistic people go nuts if things weren't going their way and they would start throwing things and breaking stuff and became combative with their parents as they tried to get control over them. I've seen movies and shows on Discovery Health Channel and I know sometimes they can act a little scary.|`|M1jlvLMwaa	lol....i'm not laughing at you...but it's just idk...kinda funny...b/c it's kinda normal really....<br>  <br>  i mean these are not normal people..they have handicaps mentally...some are even extreme....<br>  <br>  i just think some people are going to feel uncomfortable with them....like yourself....<br>  <br>  i mean if you are around these people day in and day out, you'd get used to it...<br>  <br>  so, anyways....it's normal-ish....i mean just don't be rude or mean to them....but you can walk around them if you're in a crowd or something...<br>  <br>  but remember, they can't help it.
0ixo6bkdaa	I totally agree!|`|RXI8ImdIaa	A cure would be nice, but I don't think there is one. Most of the 'cures' are either hoaxes, or are so caustic to the skin that they cause more problems. Different things work for different people, but those with severe acne usually do not get relief until they grow out of it.<br>  <br>  Or, are you saying that it should be researched better? I'll agree to that. Although I would not want to divert any funds that are being given to research for life-threatening conditions.

Stress, change in weight, diet, amount of excercise, alcohol, smoking, etc.<br>  <br>  If you aren't sexually active, or you are but you've always used protection, I would say that it's just a random occurance, and don't stress about it.

The heat really helps me relax and alleviates the pain in my hips for a few hours.  But I make it as hot as I can and sit in it as long as I can. Try soaking your hand in hot water with either regular salt or Epsom salt. It will help ease the pain and relax you.|`|ch5qHt9vaa	I use a Tens machine.

muHctmaGaa	You don't always have to binge to purge, just like anorectics don't completely starve themselves. You're even more likely to put on weight this way because your body now has to fight for every morsel that goes past your lips, putting it on guard to store fat because it isn't getting proper nutrition. Nevermind the chipmunk cheeks you'll get from swollen saliva glands. If you aren't allowing yourself regular meals, you're also throwing off your electrolytes. Throwing up exacerbates the irregularity. That's a perfect recipe for a heart attack. <br>  <br>  Excessive exercise is a disorder in its own right, but for now, instead of vomitting why not just get a pass for the gym? You're needlessly endangering your body, and it's not even likely you'll lose a lot of weight with bulimia in these early stages.<br>  <br>  Have fun in Florida with bad breath (vomit AND malnutrition), yellow acid-stained teeth, and brittle hair. That's really good-looking. And your breasts are where you'd lose short term weight first.|`|S6bsdP1Vaa	i know you said dunt tell you but bulimia is SOOOO bad for your body..puking is a way of getting rid of waste...and if you do that too often you wont have enough waste to function yoru body.  YOu need waste in your body to function.  The internet scares you because bulimia is SOOOO bad.  You will probably lose weight but this is ONE OF THE TWO WORST WAYS TO DO IT!!! Just be cautious about what you eat and excersise regularly and you will lose weight the right way.|`|mMGQCGMsaa	Just so you know, that can cause your teeth to rot and can cause cancer of the throat and esophagus.|`|Hrky2Tigaa	i got my acai info from here|`|P8zFVGnEaa	Any type of throwing up purposely is bulimia and at first it starts off that way.  But it is addicting, it seems so normal at first- and then its so easy that you keep doing it- then you do it when you're upset or depressed because the release will make you feel better.  Before you take a step down that road...<br>  <br>  First you have to know:<br>  1) YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL JUST THE WAY YOU ARE- INSIDE AND OUT!<br>  2) When you tan, you look thinner automatically- you should be working on your base tan in an indoor tanning booth instead of throwing up.<br>  3) Thinner doesn't necessarily mean more beautiful.  <br>  a)When you lose weight quickly you gain stretch marks and sometimes cellulite. <br>  b) The gastric acid from throwing up gives you a sore throat and makes you more succeptible to getting sick- something you DON'T want to do before going on vaca.<br>  c) The acid also eats away at your teeth and gives you cavities- most people who throw up frequently end up needing root-canals (expensive)<br>  d) The acid also tears away at your esophagus and stomach lining which can make it difficult for you to digest food and it causes heart-burn and indigestion.<br>  d) Throwing up swells up the glands in your face giving you "chipmunk cheeks"- something very common in bulemic girls (no matter how thin they are.<br>  <br>  Now think... is it REALLY worth it?

Conversely, if you had a cold sore on your lip (which is actually the herpes virus) and went down on her, you would give her that strain of virus on her genitals.  Sometimes people don't know they have herpes, and it's only obvious when someone is having a breakout.  Herpes on your genitals are a similar strain to herpes on your lips (cold sores).  When people are run-down, if they get cold sores (herpes) they will get one.  It's the same with genital herpes - they come when someone is run down.  It's very difficult to protect yourself completely but always use condoms and just try and know and trust your partner.|`|x4T2cFDcaa	stats are that one in 4 people in NY have herpes or a STD<br>  so that is prob the nation's average and are you a gambler?<br>  <br>  What you can catch is gum disease, Thrush and other<br>  diseases that can ruin your gums and cause your teeth <br>  to become loose and fall out. Once the gums get infected<br>  and not treated they become unable to hold the teeth in<br>  so those are some minor things you might want to think<br>  about BEFORE going for it.<br>  <br>  so for future ref something to think about.|`|oXuLtEHyaa	Yes you can get herpes, but if neither of you have one then I would not worry about. In most cities they have a free clinic that will give you a test if you want to make sure.

BUT you can if somebody has it.|`|nrGsxWw3aa	Yes you can.  Use some protection.|`|aq60VOU6aa	Yes.<br>  <br>  Most STDs are transferred by blood contact, and I think you know where the blood comes from.|`|OzYgAV4Raa	Oh yes. the scary virgin STD transfer<br>  its deadly.<br>  better drink lots of vinegar to flush it out of your system.|`|0C8lOe6Faa	not if she doesnt have it but be careful she might be lying and not telling you about it|`|B3HsDsIXaa	Freakin herpes man, and it would be on your face, dont do it unless you know she's clean|`|9KBqN0KAaa	Yeah a mouth one, like herpes.|`|5Yu7wCeiaa	put saran wrap over her vag.|`|q8IwKTfFaa	uhhh, YEAH|`|895XRbnJaa	yes any skin to skin contact can get you a std

It's just that your period wasn't over completely, and what was left wasn't finished flushing out of your system.<br>  <br>  As always, if you're using protection you shouldn't be worried. If you weren't... know that there is no 'uncommon...' it's possible to get pregnant at any time during your cycle, including right before, during, and right after your period.
8d1unoyraa	yea its good
lLC7Cf2zaa	You mentioned mood swings - that is not a symptom of ADHD.  I think your mental fuzziness may be a symptom of long term anxiety and depression.  But I understand - it could be hard to figure out the difference sometimes and you could still have it or both.  Check it out with your pdoc.... it wouldn't affect your ability to be a cop just to check.  It's better to know and get help then continue to let it keep you from performing well in college.  These sort of things often don't show up until the student leaves the comfy regulated environment of home and are suddenly without the structure of high school and home.   I understand about the reading problem, and it's horrible.  Sometimes it's worse when I'm anxious or just too much on my mind or going on around me (it doesn't take much).  Try studying in a very quiet room like the library or the basement of your dorm.  What you describe is a symptom of ADHD - but you need more than that for a diagnosis - this is coming from someone who has adhd and bp.  Oh - and doctors years ago wouldn't necessarily have picked up on anything b/c they didn't know about adhd (really!)  Good luck and I hope you reach your dreams!|`|fhJbo1rSaa	no u dont ADHD... thats not any of symptoms.. an plus if u did it would of picked ip on tests years ago as u when to docters growing up....

Just the other week, I thought the exact same thing.  I went to my doctor, I had a cyst rupture, an ovarian cyst.  He said it's common.  I felt it when it happened, it made me jump.  Then it really hurt it my stomach area for about a week.  It hurt to go over bumps in the car.  And I could feel a "lump" in the area.  He said the fluid irritates the area until it dissapates.  Maybe this will ease you somewhat, but go get it checked out, whether or not this sounds like what you have.  You'll feel a ton better.|`|xImRs3K7aa	It sounds a bit like cystitis- which is awful to have and only takes one antibiotics to get rid of.|`|mMGQCGMsaa	It might be an ovarian cyst....

What I mean by that is that sometimes there might be something that we eat on occasion that can cause these symptoms and then it clears out.<br>  <br>  When it becomes bad is if it happens on a conitnuous basis and it can be an indication of something like Irritable Bowel Syndrome.  <br>  <br>  It sounds like you could be dealing with something like Irritable Bowel Syndrome (an example only).<br>  <br>  The only way to know for sure is to see your doctor for further evaluation.

i1BBsAhtaa	shrooms try to get in touch with what is alive. Go outside feel the wind and the water leave the human part of this world behind and decide for your self what makes you happy. After you know the things that make you happy move to your goals to obtain them with out help from others. Money is something unreal but needed in a human world. Look for people that you can love and they can love you. If you dont know what makes you happy than you need to push yourself to try new things till you find it. If you can not understand life forces around you perhaps that should be your first goal.<br>   And yes you should go see a doctor and keep seeing one till you get something that works.

VdOVNtBWaa	i'm anorexic, i like to think i'm recovering, but... well, it's hard. i don't WANT to. one of the biggest probelms about anorexia is that it's a constant battle with YOURSELF. you can't escape it. you're never going to want to recover, you're never going to feel ready to recover, you just have to take a leap of faith (i feel so hypocritical for saying that) <br>  <br>  it's hard to pinpoint the exact moment this started, when it switched from a harmless diet to a life threatening disorder but i think it was sometime last year around the time my grandmother died. i've lost over 25% of my inital weight, and i still feel so fat. i hate that i can't stop thinking about it. i'm a christian (i think, i'm starting to doubt my salvation right now, i'll explain in a second) and i go to a christian school, and so it's hard when people at school tell me i'm putting food over God, i blow them off because i want to think they're lying, but when i think about it, probably about 75% of myself goes to food and weight, 10% to god, 10% firends 5% school. that's what makes me question if i'm truly saved or not. i'm putting this over God and i don't want to, but how can i stop thinking about it? it's such a struggle and deff. the hardest part about all of this for me.<br>  <br>  well, that barely even began to scratch the surface of my battle and i'm sure none of that made any sense whatsoever. but i do hopw you overcome this. i hate seeing you go through this hell. good luck|`|X1TeqHcxaa	I was anorexic mainly in high school, but also throughout life to some extent.  Used to have a contest with myself how long I could go without eating.  Drank diet soda, chew 40 sticks of gum each day to curb hunger pangs, ate tuna every day.  I was 84 lbs. in high school and still thought I looked fat.  Wouldn't go out in a bathing suit or even shorts.  Was 5' tall, 97 lbs. throughout my adult life, which was excellent!<br>  <br>  Looking back, I had a dream body, one I should've been proud to show off.  I know now that the anorexia was caused by a very distressful dysfunctional abusive family situation and was the only thing (I thought) that I could control.  It's all about feeling your life's out of control and you're literally screaming for help, only no one seems to be able to understand you or what you're going through.  They just assume you're going off the deep end or weird, but you're really calling out for help.  Help not for losing weight, but for some other frightening thing going on in your life.  I know, I've been there!!!!<br>  <br>  I must say though, at my current age I have a figure to die for, so I'm kind of glad I was strict with myself all my life.  Just don't let it get so bad your health's at risk.  As an anorexic I've seen really skinny girls/women at the mall and I'm even shocked that they look like skeletons.  I never looked sickly, just like I had an excellent body, which has been a trip.  Just monitor yourself so you don't go over the edge with it.  <br>  <br>  My anorexia was greatly lessened when I met the love of my life, who showed me that I wasn't eating normally.  So along with his nurturing love, I started getting healthier.  We ended up getting married.  Good luck in finding your balance.|`|nN8D64Yzaa	i'm in recovery right now, and it's definitely hard. i never became dangerously underweight, but the warped thinking is really hard to push away. i feel like there's hope though--i'm in a counseling/therapy program that my school offers for free, and so i get pulled from class once a week to talk to my therapist. it's weird because now a few people have found out about my illness, but the fact that some of my friends know i'm in recovery has made me want to recover even more. if i hadn't sought professional help, i would be in a lot worse place right now--probably underweight and nearing an emergency hospital visit. <br>  <br>  if you haven't already found professional help, you really need to. just knowing that someone is committed to helping me treat my illness, and doesn't think i'm crazy or seeking attention, is invaluable to me. <br>  <br>  good luck with everything, please try to get your disorder under control before it ends up compromising your life any more. go to www.something-fishy.org if you want to read up on recovery a bit more.|`|t1zhVVfBaa	Realize contrary to what you think guys do not like anorexic chicks.  They are gross.  We would much much rather have a healthy in shape girl, or even a girl with some meat on her, rather  than a sickly, skinny,  anorexic girl.|`|ccnH77SOaa	I used to be bulimic but i understand what it feels like to look in the mirror and thinking that I'm look fat and I'm not really.  The best thing I used to help me get overcome bulimia I looked up the bad side effects online and it scared me.  Anorexia has bad side effects also and you may be doing this to yourself to lose weight but it takes away from your looks and will make you look like an eighty year old woman.  <br>  <br>  I also started studying food and health...I learned what foods could do for my body, which was healthy and which was bad for me.  I began keeping a food diary and counting calories.  I learned for my body how much calories was I supposed to eat.  I also changed my diet to eating healthy foods because if I overate I wouldn't feel bad because the foods were actually healthy for my body and doing my looks and body great.  <br>  <br>  I also picked up exercising, but I think in your case I wouldn't pick up exercising until you got a better hold of your diet.  <br>  <br>  Study food and study health, if you learn about your body this will help you.<br>  <br>  Also study the negative side effects of anorexia, it may be able to help you.  For me to see what being bulimic was actually doing to my body scared me.|`|r4lIq7zxaa	I was on my way down the downward spiral, when my father threatened to not let me exercise if I didn't gain weight.  Call me crazy, but after that, I gained weight like mad!  Soon I was completely recovered, but now and again, I find myself critiquing my body very badly, and wanting to go back to my anorexic self. It's very hard...|`|px3yyPJYaa	well honestly i know nothing about it cause i've never been anorexic...i honestly think u need medical help cause u can die from it...its not something u should wanna ask some1 recovering from the disorder how they feel!!!! GO FIND MEDICAL HELP!!!|`|0L5NjF7kaa	I was anorexish once but i realized that girls didn't like scrawny guys so now i workout and eat Altot of protein I am 14 girls love me and im having the time of my life thin is okay really skinny is just ugly|`|MpTZjdLJaa	u just gotta force yourself to eat <br>  if you want to look at these, this is what you will look like if you keep doing what you are doing<br>  <br>  <a href="http://sidaorg.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/anorexia4lp.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://sidaorg.files.wordpress.com/2008/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.skeptically.org/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/anorexia-bikini.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.skeptically.org/sitebuilderco...</a><br>  <br>  tough love|`|doftmlQWaa	I can't ever imagine myself 'getting over' it :/

jlQHB9dvaa	I'm sure that you mean MUFFIN TOP, not muffin toX.  Like the top of a muffin looks, get it?<br>  For abdominal weight loss, lower your fat and carb intake and do exercises that concentrate heavil on that area.
tsn34pS4aa	Mos def above average. He's looking for attention either from you or in life in general if he's convinced he has a deficiency down there. Average man is barely 6" erect.

f8mLpPXlaa	Sounds like you're mouth breathing while you sleep. You could have sleep apnea or it could just be dry air. You could try a room humidifier, just make absolutely sure you keep it clean. Change the water frequently and wash out the reservoir.  Bacteria can grow very fast in water and it can easily spread throughout the room.<br>  God bless.|`|CvESLNnkaa	If you are developing algeries this will sometimes happen.  Odd but true also mouthbreathing.  I learned this from my doctor when I had the same problem.

Not going to kill you probably, but you may not get better for whatever the doctor is treating you for. OH there is that other pesky other issue of marijuana being illegal and if Dr. took a blood sample he'll know you use OH Oh bet you forgot to think of that,? Doesn't that ad for drug control state, marijuana may make you think you look cool, but often shows others how dumb you are. Well God Bless and think about RECOVERY Reggie|`|l8GiNCIGaa	Dude, dont smoke! You should realize that you are throwing away the rest of your life by doing that. Everyone hates people on drugs and who smoke.|`|iQaKNSI6aa	don't smoke marijuana at all it's bad for you don't you know that.|`|lDBFqmCJaa	weed is natural so no it wont effect it. Just dont take any other (synthetic) prescriptions together|`|kSTc05bmaa	You should's smoke marijuana at all.
428685eaf1e34d4ea7d852ce47f954c6aa	For the lower teeth, it is the inferior alveolar nerve<br>  For the upper teeth, Posterior superior alveolar nerve (back teeth), middle superior alveolar nerve (middle teeth) and anterior superior alveolar nerve (front teeth)<br>  <br>  These are the main nerve. <br>  Don't worry about which nerves you need to numb, because in dentistry school they will teach all that

GIs1jMhHaa	Some people just start late, there's nothing she can do. It's not like people can look at her and tell that she hasn't started her period, so why is she worrying?|`|2eGgbhVoaa	It's fine...If it gets to 16 and is has not happened that's when you go to the doctors. I got mine on my 13th birthday! And was one of the early ones in my group of friends at the time. Lots of them did not get it until much later.|`|J7k4xJtoaa	Well she isn't exactly a late bloomer, she has already had her growth spurts and she is well developed. From someone that has really bad pains with the lovely period. Tell her that she has all the perks without the payment. She should enjoy it while it lasts and it will come when her body is ready.|`|VkbZfOBAaa	tell her that you were lying and you didnt get yours yet either
sKTmxnx1aa	Yes, they do masturbate.  Some of them do, but I don't, and I'm not planning to anytime soon, so I couldn't really tell you how or anything about it.|`|jcL7gDMKaa	Of course we do! There are loads of 'toys' you can get from places like ann summers or online. even a standard vibrator does the trick. It doesnt damage if you use the thing properly and dont push it in too deep.|`|l7GjBVvhaa	Girls masturbate, yes.<br>  Many and most masturbate by self-fingering their vagina and clit. Some can and do use other objects/toys as well. There are dildos/vibrators that mock a real penis and come in many sizes, shapes, colors, and textures. There is not much damage that can happen unless a girl does not keep her toys/hands clean, as well as not harming her vaginal walls and lips with scratches and burns.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Be seeing you......|`|r61rzh7daa	Yea, some just use their fingers, I don't know if you're a guy or a girl, so.... Sometimes they use vibrators. It doesn't do damage, actually, it's very healthy. It's supposedly a good way to relieve sexual tension.
e43c70f0ddb74bd3e9e8e01784a9fa8faa	I hope all goes well.<br>  As a survivor of cervical cancer my heart goes out to her and her family.|`|dovVcDPmaa	Yes I agree with you entirely. She will at least have a beautiful wedding that she so wishes for.<br>  I would like to point out the Cervical cancer is Not necessary Always due to STD and have noticed that this is not often mentioned.  Jade's illness has at least made many females aware of this certain cancer & will encourage them to go for smears.|`|UA9IaN0maa	Yes, I too hope that she has a wonderful day and her whole family have some happy memories to carry them through.|`|zoyw8CRKaa	I do indeed, it is such a sad sad story and i hope she has a lovely day that she can hold in her heart till her last breath. xx|`|13561ef688d651ebae907f5ff2f7fc41aa	Don't want to sound all righteous, but it is not for us to judge poor Jade, just thank the Lord that we have not been called to go through this hell. Her life is being snatched away before she's hardly lived in any kind of happiness and she has the utter agony of leaving her little boys..and who knows the physical suffering that her final weeks will hold ? C'mon find a little compassion and bite back the spiteful things you want to say! I hope her wedding day really does transport her to a meaningful state of happiness and, yes, I think she is brave and dignified.|`|8KhD8MPBaa	yes, I hate the people who are saying she's milking the whole publicity thing, she's doing what any mother would do and getting as much money as possible for her boys who are soon going to be without a mother :( .|`|5vcmSuk2aa	God Bless To Jade Goody<br>  My Heart Truly Goes Out To Her And Her Family<br>  Apparently Shes Only Got Weeks Left To Live<br>  Poor Thing x|`|0kXlNWcMaa	who is Jade???|`|u7o75zipaa	Sure, everyone deserves a good wedding day.<br>  <br>  I personally don't care for Jade Goody. I can't stand big brother or any of the wannabes who have been on it. I do sympathise with her situation - nobody deserves that - but for all the people defending her so much, did you give a f*ck before she was dying? She's still the same person so grow up.|`|2242ab75cc3bad9ab4ca7fbaf5578defaa	Yes<br>  <br>  I wish Jade all the happiness, luck and love in the world for tomorrow<br>  <br>  I hope for a really special day for her<br>  <br>  God Bless you Jade!
S8Fhbvu7aa	Lindsay Lohan is unhealthily thin, her skin is palid and her hair is dry and rough. Plainly put, she's really unhealthy from the lifestyle she pursues. If you're asking for her diet so you can go on it I think you should find a dietitian and eat real food without throwing it up after like her.|`|0MODZ0Iwaa	shes on the "i want to look like a twig cuz i love trees so much" diet|`|pBRN4xxTaa	the coming out as a lesbian all of a sudden diet|`|4SxrT2seaa	Actually, you don't have to diet in fact to lose weight, the one diet that clearly delivered for me is wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box below, they have a limited number of free trials in stock, it was highlighted in Fox News and CNN. I worked off 20 pounds, it clearly does produce success!|`|H4isBL4jaa	she is on the "fish " diet!!!<br>  no she probably does cocaine!!!
VyPVJSepaa	omg i have that sometimes too! i understand how u feel about this but try not to think about food. or maybe your just under alot of stress, sometimes when im stressed i tend to binge too and make sure to get enough sleep at least  hours. one more thing keep the food that youll likey to binge on out of the house so you wont be able to binge.<br>  <br>  and try to have 6 meals a day so breakfast, snack( a fruit), lunch, snack, dinner, snack. This really helps me wish u the best! xoxo|`|xFgXny0paa	DO NOT do wot tara ses, that really mucks u up, trust me i know! never do that! never start!! if u r binge eating then try chewing gum.|`|3efVGK9Maa	try chewing gum|`|8y24H37Maa	try binging and purging that usually takes care of it.
9pLdhuBnaa	As for if you should let them do it, I would recommend letting the nurse know that you need to talk to her doctor some more because you have some questions about this issue.  One of the questions that you should ask in addition to how this will effect her is about other options for treating the issue besides the feeding tube.  Also, ask about the risks of them doing the procedure both during and after the procedure.
e5VUwaRsaa	Which one? Copper...immediately.<br>  Mirena...up to a year.
32i2f6tOaa	Although I do not know much about coeliac disease, I do run a local carers group and one of the carers that attends her son has coelic disease. There is a website that maybe able to give you more information  it can be found at www.coeliac.org.uk There is also a telephone number which is 0870444 8804.<br>  <br>  And remember there is a great network out there called Contact a Family<br>  they can be found on www.cafamily.org.uk or contact number is 08008083555 this is a great way of contacting other families who have children with the same problems....the website explains how they work.<br>  <br>  Hope this has helped<br>  <br>  PS There is also a website that covers this at <a href="http://www.e-celiacs.org/2-Celiac_Disease_in_Children.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.e-celiacs.org/2-Celiac_Diseas...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  celiac and coeliac are the same thing.|`|mnb6bF7Paa	My friends adopted daughter has coeliacs disease it was diagnosis when she was a baby and she is now nearly 11 and with a gluten free diet she is fine
yJ31VS79aa	I don't know you should go see a doctor as soon as possible. This happened to one of my friends, they bled for like a month then they were fine.
MPX0f5jzaa	You have a factor in your blood meaning you're susceptible, not that you have it.  It's genetics, remember?<br>  <br>  I don't believe in natural treatments, sorry.  Most of that juice stuff is hogwash.
S3AU0KDiaa	Depends if you want to build muscle and put on weight, or lose weight.<br>  <br>   If you want to put on weight, drink a protein shake or eat an ommlette or something.<br>   If you want to lose weight, drink some water or something light like a piece of fruit.|`|tIldpr7vaa	a protein shake, or a protein rich meal ( a healthy one no crap)|`|roe07rI8aa	Banana
t9Nw86Plaa	I've never heard of anyone drinking this tea to ease amenorrhea, but I do know that eating eggs (several per week) helps.<br>  <br>  Additionally, if you're on the underweight side, then gaining weight (by healthy means, of course.. eat more healthy fats and oils, wholegrains, etc) will help.|`|AA11809403	caffeine makes it worse, usually, so how is the caffeine level in the tea?
yE2vM76naa	This is the sort of info you share with a doctor. Call the office, tell them - there is nothing to be ashamed of - its more common than you think, and they should be used to dealing with it considering they treat women there - and ask them if you might should consider a tranquilizer such as xanax and a driver.|`|b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	I see by your name that you are a Mom, so maybe you need to put your health ahead of your fears to insure that you will be here for your daughter as she is growing up, especially if your own Mom had cervical problems young.  Just keep your appointment and think about that while you are having it done.  Do it for her.<br>  <br>  good luck..|`|ziVtTtObaa	i am so sorry. i recommend therapy if you are not already seeing some one. Also you did not say if your GYN was a female or not. Try and see a female GYN. that may take away some of your stress. also see if they will call if a Rx for you like ativan or xanex to take just prior to your visit. that may take the edge off, just have some one drive you if you take a pill. also take a close friend or family with you to hold your hand a talk gently to you to reassure you. My heart is breaking for you!|`|VXQFT341aa	Would it help to find a female doctor? You may want to seek counseling. With your family history you need to over come it. But really no one on hear can do that effectively. Im so sorry you had to go thru what you did.|`|9607f07a7fcd3e1d711c44cbed59369faa	Would it make it easier for you if you went to a Female doctor instead of a Male doctor???|`|AA10889282	This is awfully sad. Have you considered speaking to a mental health professional? You need to get over this.|`|q29obefdaa	i would deff get a female doctor. (im very uncomfortable around men other than my husband) i've been abused too.<br>  i would suggest having someone in the room with you. if you're close to your mom, have her sit in the room (she doesn't have to be on that end, just behind you, or next to you. &talk to her)<br>  it will comfort you.<br>  i've only gone to female doctors...i can't even imagine going to a male doctor.|`|eCKNRcIVaa	First of all can you get a female doctor?  Secondly can you ask your doctor for a mild sedative like xanax or ativan just to take for the exam, I bet they will give it to you.  Why don't you call the doctors office and ask for a prescription fo just one xanax pill ( tell them why ) and take that as soon as you arrive at the office.  It will help you relax|`|f40f9129dabe19ad12978425e1f40401aa	Go to a female doctor, and tell her your concerns BEFORE the actual the day of the exam. Maybe you need an anti-anxiety medication. That way you won't be as bothered with the situation. If you do take medication to calm down, make sure that you have someone drive you there and back.|`|l4tZTALfaa	have a long talk with your doc about it he may suggest a female doc and ,most of all you need to go in for counseling before this makes your life even more messed up ,,sometimes these things never go away without help. dont let it eat up the rest of your life ,been there hon  hugs Rain|`|muHctmaGaa	First of all, let your doctor know the source of your concerns. She will understand how to treat you much more gently. Second... maybe you should drink first. Do you take anti-anxiety medications? Is there a trusted friend who you wouldn't mind being in the same room to hold your hand?|`|A7XL1eH6aa	You need to overcome that in some way.  Whether with your doctor or a therapist.  You need the tests done so you can assure you are healthy.|`|w7XNcmihaa	Aww, I'm so sorry. :(<br>  <br>  You need to just think about something else at the moment, there's nothing much you can do|`|tmGRe2Jraa	First, good on you for understanding that even though it's a difficult and painful process for you, getting your pap is an essential part of taking care of yourself.  Although there's no getting around it, there might be ways to make the situation less uncomfortable for you.  Would you feel better if you were able to bring a friend or family member into the room to keep you company?  Would it help if you were wearing a long skirt that you were able to leave on?  If your anxiety is extreme, your doctor might be able to give you a light sedative to help you relax.  Have you spoken with your doctor about your situation?  He/She might have encountered this situation before, and have ideas to help you or be able to make certain exceptions to make the process more comfortable for you.  And remember, if your doctor seems insensitive or unwilling to make special arrangements for you, or makes you feel embarrassed -- I can't emphasize this enough -- Get A New Doctor.|`|GCr8ssB6aa	Hunny dont you worry.<br>  <br>  my friend was the same. she was to scared to let any one see her down there. understand the doctor wont hurt you, there are toher pople that can help you. why not try talking to  a family member?<br>  <br>  dont worrry youll be fine.
DJXW96d0aa	If it was food poisoning you'd likely be vomiting and/or experiencing diarrhea (these symptoms usually set in within 24 hours of eating the bad food).  At this point, an OTC remedy like Pepto-Bismol or Gas-X will be your best (and fastest) bet.  If you get a fever, begin vomiting, and/or start to have severe diarrhea, seek out a 24-hour Urgent Care facility.  It sounds like indigestion and gas (especially considering the dinner involved), but these other symptoms could mean something more serious.
3OoCiOkAaa	You are still growing and have probably not reached your full adult height.<br>  <br>  Therefore you weight is not a matter of concern yet. If you were 5 8 tall, 18 years old and weighed a 100 pounds I would recommend you seek dietary and exercise advice.<br>  <br>  <br>  Your body is going through  transitions ( changes) Imagine a cygnet turning into a swan or a kitten turning into a cat. You can only make your decision once you have reached your goal which is adulthood.<br>  <br>  <br>  Don't focus on your weight - just allow yourself to grow up. Eat sensibly and take varied exercises. Not just aerobic exercise , but some resistance training to help build up some muscle and keep your bones strong.<br>  <br>  <br>  Focussing on your weight inappropriately never helps anyone as they either end up very fat or very thin. <br>  <br>  <br>  See yourself as a young lady approaching adulthood and try to enjoy the journey as much as you can as you will be an adult sooner than you think.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Try products such as Quorn, Tofu and Soya . They are vegetarian options to meat and give you all the protein you need.<br>  <br>  If I ate a yoghurt a day I would be a 100 pounds . I would say you are surviving on less than 500 calories a day. You need a 1800 cals a day if you are still growing.<br>  <br>  If you don' t take  in more daily  calories- you may not end up growing to your full height and you could end up having weak bones and prematurely aging.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Try<br>  <br>   SOYA<br>  TOFU<br>  QUORN<br>  <br>  <br>  They all taste different and it is personal choice which one suits you.<br>  <br>  You should also try bean products as they are also rich in protein and are quite easy to digest.<br>  <br>  <br>  At the moment you are eating a lot of fat and very little protein. You also need to have vegetables for your joints. To stop you getting old before your time.<br>  <br>  I have included a few sites and the last one also shows you some ready meals you can buy -if you don't like cooking.|`|CDL8WJ7Paa	:D sounds like me haha<br>  im 14 and about 98 i thinkk<br>  then again, im like 5'1 xD<br>  i would reccommend eating lots of fruits and veggies, because consuming too much dairy may be bad in the long run.

AA11375099	I am so sorry you feel this way, I truly believe that fighting cancer has a lot to do with attitude, faith, and trust.  I am very familiar with "Triple Negative Cancer" because it is what my wife is fighting now.<br>  <br>  And her oncologist (which is rated one of the best in the Pacific Northwest) believes that this kind of cancer is very cure-able.  Quite the opposite of your oncologist, that I cannot believe told you that you would die if it returns.  <br>  <br>  In fact our Oncologist Dr. Vinn of the Swedish Medical Center in Seattle told us that with the treatment prescribed her chance of the cancer returning is less than 3%.<br>  <br>  My wife was diagnosed with Stage 2B Triple Negative.  The treatment was 15 weeks of Adriamycin and Cytoxin.  Then because there were no clear margins she had a mastectomy.  Now we are on week 10 of 12 weeks of Taxol.  Then we will rest a week and a half and begin Radiation treatments for 6.5 weeks.<br>  <br>  After her mastectomy they found from the lab that the cancer found in her breast was the size of a small grain of rice reduced from the size of a fifty-cent piece.  Before treatment she had 3 lymph nodes with cancer after her first treatment of chemotherapy there was found only one lymph node that showed cancer and it was the size of a large grain of rice.  It had not ruptured and showed no sign of entering the blood stream.<br>  <br>  Right now, I asked my wife how she felt about her cancer after she had the mastectomy done and she replied that she felt she was cured.  She see's herself now as being cancer free.  And with her oncologist saying that it has less than a 3% chance of reoccurance she feels great about the treatment.<br>  <br>  I believe as already know that fighting cancer is hell, it takes a lot out of you physically and emotionally.  The attitude you have as you fight cancer is very important to your outlook.  Staying positive about the disease will improve the probability of you surviving it.<br>  <br>  In life we make our own reality, what we believe happens will happen.  Change that record that is playing in your mind because your body will hear the message and it will become reality.<br>  <br>  Don't let your future be held hostage by what an oncologist says, I could hardly believe that she uttered those words.<br>  <br>  Here is a true story of what happened to my grandfather.  He was fighting skin cancer.  He had gone through 12 weeks of chemotherapy.  His doctor on the day of his last treatment told him that he could not believe how well a 94 year old man is doing so well with chemotherapy.  He said so many of his patients would be very sick by now.<br>  <br>  That night he went home, got sick and died.  That is how powerful a the words of a doctor could be.  Don't give that power to anybody.  Doctor or not, it is your life, you have been a year free of cancer, and you will live to see your grandchildren's graduation from college.  <br>  <br>  What you believe will happen will happen, so believe only the positive and have faith that God has healed you.  Don't play what your doctor said ever again in your mind.  Enough already!|`|QseFxRhVaa	Yes, actually, it is. Many people cure it all around the world, and actually with home remedies rather than over-the-counter drugs. The only country that really doesn't know about this is America.<br>  <br>  Anything that will strenghten your immune system will help make it go away. Also, detoxing too.<br>  <br>  ?Green tea is good for it because green tea is good for cancer, getting rid of free radicals, high in antioxidant content, etc.<br>  ?White tea has the highest antioxidant level in the world. You need antioxidants to strengthen your immune system.<br>  ?Echinacea tea is also very good for your immune system<br>  <br>  Eat a lot of green vegetables & a lot of fruit. Try organic, because those keep all of the nutrients.<br>  <br>  Coconut oil. (Get a scoop and put it into cold water and drink it).<br>  <br>  ?Goji berries<br>  ?Acai berries<br>  <br>  Yoga would also help you, because it corrects your chi flow. It needs to flow correctly for there to be nothing wrong with you.<br>  <br>  Also, don't eat things that have a lot of estrogen in them, because it will make the breast cancer get worse. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps! D:|`|2Cl6egUDaa	I am so sorry.  You are so young; this shouldn't be something you have to deal with.  <br>  <br>  I've been doing a lot of research on cancer because my brother-in-law was diagnosed with Renal Cell Carcinoma, which is also a very bad type of cancer that cannot be cured with traditional methods (i.e. chemo, radiation.)  Nevertheless, he is getting chemo and I feel like his doctors are holding out false hope to him in order to take his money.  I've done a lot of research the last few months, and everyone I've found with RCC who has had traditional cancer treatments has died. However, I did find one man in my hometown who has lived for years now by using alternative therapies.  (His cancer docs gave him 6 months and wanted to remove both his kidneys.  He said no, still has both his kidneys and is doing great.)  Since you've gone the traditional route, I would strongly suggest you try some alternative therapies.  The best site I've seen that outlines them is:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cancertutor.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.cancertutor.com</a><br>  <br>  I would suggest trying the Budwig protocol.  It seems pretty easy to me, (I tried it myself and I don't have cancer) and it is outlined on this site:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.healingcancernaturally.com/budwig-diet-implementation.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.healingcancernaturally.com/bu...</a><br>  <br>  Also, there is an Italian oncologist who has been curing cancer with Sodium Bicarbonate treatments.  This is his website:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.curenaturalicancro.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.curenaturalicancro.com/</a><br>  <br>  The gentleman I know who cured his cancer (so far) did so by veggie juicing and going on a vegetarian, alkaline diet.  It makes sense to me that the best way to beat cancer is to change your diet.  I've dealt with health problems my whole life, although not cancer, and the only time I feel good is when I get off sugar, dairy, yeast, etc. and eat tons of veggies and drink vegetable juice.  Look for books by Robert O. Young, Ph.D.  He's published a lot of books explaining alkaline diets and they usually have recipes in them that make it easier to follow.<br>  <br>  Anyway, don't give up!  Try some of these alternative treatments that are available.  You might find that the answer to your question is yes, cancer is curable!<br>  <br>  All the best to you in your fight.
8rvPgdSIaa	I consider this abusive and you need to see a counselor and go on some anti-depressants immediately. Sorry for being so harsh but either your joking or you have some issues.  Things can't always go the way YOU want them to, so get over it and respect people's own opinions/decisions and instead of being mad at them, compliment them.|`|7agJ1Gemaa	In some ways yes. In other ways this is plain scary and I think you need serious help. Disowned your son?  Hit your wife? C'mon man that's not right.|`|7STihXONaa	this is more then ocd....u need some professional help|`|qXCgeye3aa	i think you need counseling, you take life to seriously
raqQPkwyaa	Your ideal caloric intake should be 1818 calories. To lose weight get more exercise and keep your calories at or under 1818. The figure 1818 was figured based on moderate exercise. You can check it yourself online.|`|GYSxsQOqaa	You should take in 2500 calories a day. Eat 5-6 smaller meals a day instead of 3 big meals. Get at least 1 hour of exercise a day. Don't eat chips, candy, or other crap. I would suggest try to eat less dairy and red meat. Eat lots of veggies, fruits, fiber, and lean protein. Drink 8 glasses of water a day. Then you will lose weight if you stick to that! (I'm almost 14, I eat like that (I don't eat any meat or dairy) and I'm starting to exercise more now and I'm losing weight. I'm 5'3" to 5'4" and I'm like 115 and going down!!!|`|nKtbkHQaaa	because losing to much weight because at that age and height your weight is fine if you lose to much you will be underweight which is unhealthy. i would just say if you want to lose weight just eat smaller portions and no junk food.|`|wpaMDZlsaa	Don't worry about calories, worry about your meals.
C6VZOpPiaa	Not sure why you're getting them, all I can advise is that you drink enough, it helps prevent stretch marks. And moisturise, too.|`|QciqgJPuaa	maybe your just growing or something or losing and gaining idkk<br>  <br>  maybe its cellulite?<br>     but cocoa butter on them i think it helps|`|Jq2K3N1Zaa	Well everyone gets some stretch marks. It has to do with genetics also. Ask your mom or sister if she has them too. I bet she does. It sucks!|`|HdXy9Ppvaa	i have no idea, im getting the same thing.
xT6TQvElaa	I don't think so. If you have a yeast infection, the discharge could be so bad it could go through your underwear. But, if it doesn't get on his penis directly, then no he shouldn't get it.
muHctmaGaa	The packaging should answer your last question. There are often dissolving pills that work from the inside out, similar to a suppository. For now, a safe alternative is using plain yogurt.|`|7xRNCogLaa	most yeast infection creams are internal, i would check and make sure your cream isn't just for itching and actually cures yeast infections. the time differs, some take three and some take 7. depends on how much you want to spend.
5Ra5xbziaa	no not to me
rgcW2ly1aa	get a hula hoop or do sit ups with weights every day<br>  about 100 per day
C6VZOpPiaa	Not necessarily. You might end up similar, you might be completely different. My sister is a lot bigger than our mum, and I am a lot smaller. Remember, it's not only your mum's genes, but her parents' and your father's parents'. Add to that the factor of weight, and you could be anything.|`|bhyVC2mtaa	You should be the same size as your mom. But if you weight a lot more or a lot less than it can change.|`|4f3GfrN6aa	No.<br>  <br>  Mine grew bigger.<br>  <br>  Thank you, paternal grandmother!<br>  <br>  Breast size is determined by genetics.  You can get breast size from either side of the family.  I inherited mine through my father's side of the family, just like I got his eyes, height, and my grandmother's hair.|`|sNnMZV5qaa	im only 17 and my breasts are already much bigger than hers are right now. but like the others have said, you can get it from your fathers side of the family too, like i did!|`|8a719441d739d9411f7c186796d5fd5aaa	No, I take after my fathers side of the family. I am not a Jeff, I'm his wife.. But my sister takes after my Mom, so it depends of who your body structure takes after.

If not, go pick i up!! <br>  In the words of the truly great heroin of this book "ITS EMOTIONAL F**KWITTAGE~" <br>  <br>  This guy is playing you, but its 110% normal to be attracted by that. How many times have you played the ice queen to guys just to see them squirm? Everyone does it.<br>  <br>  You cant get him off your mind for that reason. Also, if you feel guilty and he ignores you, it plays on the same nerve. <br>  <br>  Try to stop thinking about it. I promise that he's moved on from what you've done and most likely still thinks your hot. Move on. If he thinks its acceptable to repeatedly treat you this way, the relationship wont go well and will result in more broken hearts. <br>  <br>  You can still think he's hot, but get out with guys more and your friends. Life doesnt end when a relationship does. Your probably craving male attention aswell. A few gorgeous guys around you wont do any harm =] Eventually, the feeling will go away, and you'll only be left with good memories. <br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  x|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	It`s called a crush .<br>  And not a mental disorder.<br>  <br>  The only thing you can do is realize that he is not available - and also not interested (way he acts).<br>  <br>  And, it can be difficult.<br>  <br>  But, when you get your own bf - he`ll be forgotten soon :)|`|XtHsBlJKaa	Well i don't believe you can love some if you have never even dated them, It takes awhile to grow a bond to actually love someone.......you probably just have a huge crush. <br>   I had a crush on this guy for 2 years. Crazy uh? Well he was in a long relationship so i never tried to be with him or let him know i liked him, As soon as they broke up I went after him, Guess what?! I think it was more of a desire to have something i couldn't have because as soon as we started dating.....I decided i didn't like him that much after all. That completely blow my mind,  I broke up with him a few weeks later, We decided to be just friends. <br>  You will probably get over him faster than you think.  : )|`|QNvHjcVraa	No, your normal. Of course your going to fall for someone who flirts and gives you all these attention that they like you. It's okay to feel the way you are, just as long as it doesn't get obsessive.|`|Nage3N1Faa	I felt the same way about someone too. <br>  She was available however things got between us and I never said anything either. It could take awhile but you will get over it.<br>  Just look for someone new to be with.

FjsmaFcYaa	it is possible, water is really important to flush your system of impurities and keep you hydrated, both promote healthy and clear skin.  soda is full of sugar and syrups and nothing of nutritional value, which can affect your skin.... mayb e try swithcing to flaavored water or unsweetned iced tea and save the soda as a treat|`|muHctmaGaa	Are your nails brittle too? Is your tongue white even with good dental hygiene? Those have always been signs of dehydration for me. If you don't like water, try drinking milk or juice if you don't want to give up your carbonated, diuretic soda. You don't necessarily have to drink just water to reach your recommended fluid intake level. Also, the bags under your eyes could result from other things besides poor diet, including stress and lack of sleep.|`|9g2OAB8Maa	Yeah, you definitely are dehydrated. Water is truly the only thing that quenches thirst, and it is important to keep all your important body parts nice and hydrated.<br>  I would suggest drinking some water, NOW!|`|wgm9ADfBaa	yes you need to drink water. that is why you have bags. you know your suppose to have a gallon of water a day?|`|yOr4SOO4aa	Yeap the eye bags could be because you are dehydrated. It's not the best think to drink only soda because of the amount of sugar, and only 3 cans doesn't make the best amount of water your body needs. Actually when you feel thirsty it's because you are already dehydrated, so don't wait until you feel thirsty to drink liquids. Try having only water for about 4 days and i could bet your eye bags will disappear.|`|DSzG23WRaa	Wow. At least your honest.

I lost 12 pounds in 9 days and then 28 pounds in less than a month. I also lost a lot of inches too!   I learned that cleansing will help the body get rid of toxins.  Toxins come from a lot of things like fast food, pollution, food additives and preservatives and lots of other things.  The toxins get stored in the fat in our body.  To get rid of the fat, we have to get rid of the toxins by cleansing the body.  This made sense to me and I decided to try a cleanse program and it worked.  The weight came off fast and this kept me motivated to keep going, not like other diets where the weight loss it too slow. I did Jenny Craig, Weight Watcher and Medifast.  If you want to learn more call the toll free number 1-877-587-4647 or check out the website.  This was the first time I ever did a cleanse, it was easy and I feel better.  Good luck whatever you decide to do!  <a href="http://thebestcleansingdiet.com" rel="nofollow">http://thebestcleansingdiet.com</a>

I had my first child a year ago and the whole year has been a struggle to get back to my pre-pregnancy weight.<br>  <br>  The first thing I would do would be to start counting calories. There are a lot of calorie calculators on the internet that should tell you roughly how many calories you should limit yourself to a day to lose weight (google it).<br>  <br>  Stay away from fast food and preservatives as much as possible if not completely.<br>  <br>  Start working out or working out more. I found that 30 minutes a day jogging or doing aerobics was very effective!<br>  <br>  I also tried Slim Quick. I can't say for sure if the product actually did anything or not, but the diet plan it came with was a huge help.<br>  <br>  You will not lose weight instantly, but it will come off with time. The largest factor to losing weight is commitment.|`|5rJ6nf2oaa	You can do it in around 8 weeks by following a diet-based liver cleanse. This means eliminating red meat, animal fats, dairy and any processed food/food with additives. Replace with seafood (not fried), some lean chicken (no skin), vegetables, salad and fruit, and wholemeal pasta, bread and rice. Drink a lot of water to flush out toxins, and drink a fresh raw vegetable juice every morning.<br>  <br>  It's a nice diet, you don't have to starve, and the reason it works is because you are helping your liver to burn fat more efficiently. I lose at least a couple of lb a week on this diet, but you will as much excess as you have. Limit your calorie intake to 1200-1400 a day, and walk or jog 30 min a day for even better results.<br>  <br>  Read the articles below for further explanation and example diet plan.<br>  Good luck.|`|tggywKcgaa	hey if u wana loose weight at home easily u <br>  can try the diets and tips given in this site <br>  regarding weight loss efectively<br>  <a href="http://medifastweigghtlose.notlong.com" rel="nofollow">http://medifastweigghtlose.notlong.com</a><br>  it has got so many weight loss tips and diets <br>  to help u loose weight easily at home|`|sQu3LLqtaa	Perhaps you can find some useful information in a web search for "how to lose weight the safe way".

GQJbOblQaa	You are doing nothing wrong.  It was bad luck that few of the women rejected your requests.  It happens and be a sport and take it lightly.  Never lose hope and try out another night.  Try to be yourself, keep your self esteem high and propose to girls the way you usually do.  If you can't treat women as queens, no problem but do treat them respectfully.<br>  <br>  Everyone has self respect and none has the rights to hurt it.  Become handsome not only by outwardly looks but also from inside.  Nurture positive thoughts while approaching people.  <br>  <br>  Enjoy life the way you want.

PJelxn5Xaa	Yoga, pilates and cardio like running or kick boxing are the best ways to burn fat. Cut the sweets and sat. and trans fat out of your diet. Drink A LOT of water.

Some calendar months have 30-31 days, so which do you mean? At any rate, it will come when it will come.<br>  <br>  It should make no difference in your plans. If you were planning to have sex, it may be a little bit messier, so just put a towel under your hips in bed.I've had a few lovers in 40+ years of experience, and none of them were too bothered by menses. <br>  <br>  You're going to use condoms anyway, right?|`|qfSKgxDsaa	Nope sorry hun...even if you started birth control now and haven't been on it, it probably wouldn't work...it usually takes 3 months to get regular on that stuff...if you are sure you are getting it on the 26 have your day on the 25 maybe kinda late where it'd be midnight and technically your b-day (depending on when you normally get it) hopefully doing it on the 25 and at midnight if possible will work for you :)|`|AA10670662	There's no way you can delay your period at all without birth control. If your boyfriend really does love and care about you with all of his heart, he will understand when you start and don't feel good and don't want to go out. I have a boyfriend too. My boyfriend is 100% understands when I'm on my period, because he has a mom, grandma (which he calls her granny) and a little sister, so when it comes to periods he completely understands, and lets me rest up and feel better again.|`|qbuKhyrYaa	these things have messed up my cycle in the past<br>  -not eating<br>  -take plan b<br>  -but seriously u should prob go on the pill anyways so u might as well start now just go to planned parenthood theyll give you it all for free no questions asked and you dont have to give them any information if you dont want to its a lot easier than you think and you can be any age|`|a9BYPzKxaa	Nope, you cannot.|`|iDScOWBIaa	if yours are what i think they are.... dont until your wedding night. dont throw your pearls before swine
b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	You don't say how many carbs a day you have been eating, but if you want to increase them, do it gradually, like 10 grams a day more and if your weight starts to increase you will know you have added too many.  Don't forget that if you increase your carbs you will have to decrease either fats or protein to get the same calories.<br>  <br>  good luck..
2LflHv23aa	A vaginal discharge is very natural. If you wear a panty liner it will help with the wetness. It should not smell however. If it smells funky it is a sign that you could have an infection. Go to the doctor to have it checked out. Other than that nothing to worry about.|`|hZWup7xXaa	this is very normal, this is how your vagina cleans its self. to keep it from staining clothes and feeling wet, you can wear panty liners, they are sort of like pads but a lot thinner and you cant see them through your pants or anything. hope this helps hun :)|`|T4L9uTe8aa	wear a panty liner duh|`|hxvjeApFaa	yeah thats normal. it probably just means your gonna get your period soon or your just horny!|`|sW3yg6m2aa	That's just vaginal discharge, not ***.
niZBsn9Qaa	Weight lifting first.<br>  Here's why:<br>  <br>  When you lift weights, you deplete the glycogen stores in your muscles. Then when you do cardio afterwards, it has to target your fat stores for energy - since there's nothing else available from being depleted by the weights.<br>  <br>  Also, if you do cardio first, it uses the energy in your muscles, tiring you out.. and preventing from going as hard as you usually can when lifting weights. This slows results down, and it's also dangerous. Since your muscles would be tired from cardio, and then you would hit them again with the weights, you're pushing a higher risk of injury.<br>  <br>  Since you should be eating like 6 times a day, just time your gym session to be after one of those meals (which should have some complex carbs in it) Then after your workout, have a protein shake and some simple carbs - like fruit juice.<br>  <br>  The protein is what your muscles need to repair themselves (which is when you get results), and the fruit juice spikes your insulin levels, which replenishes the glycogen stores in your muscles. It also increases the speed of the protein uptake into the muscles.<br>  <br>  Also, something to keep in mind - cardio trains your cardiovascular system - burning calories, and hence, fat, is just a side effect of that. Cardio only buns calories when you are actually doing it.<br>  <br>  Weight lifting jacks your metabolism, keeping your body in an accelerated fat-burning phase for up to 12 hours afterwards. This is why you want to go as hard as possible while lifting weights, and to do this, you need to do it first.|`|CBx6qHztaa	1st poster had good info.  But, if you can find the time do weights on separate days than cardio.  You'll have more energy to put into each workout.
JsEK4sv2aa	i feel you pain.. literally... ive never been with a guy under 9in. so i know what your talking about... <br>  the best thing to do... is a lot of foreplay, make sure your extrememly wet and lubricated, have him use his fingers slowly to stretch you out before he starts so no tearing will occur.. if he wants it to work he will have no issue doing these things.. <br>  make sure you always start on bottom, and have him insert, very, very, very, lol, slowly... i know youve tried this.. but im serious..<br>  have him insert in small increments, and kind of just stay inside without pumping, thrusting, moving, and this will help stretch you out as well... <br>  make sure that when, and you should, you apply lube, it is both inside AND out... having some extra wetness outside will help prevent tearing, chafing, n that typa thing.. <br>  hope this helps some..|`|rhuhp6KCaa	Im 22, well for one he has to be gentle at first after a couple of tries everthing should work out. The vagina is able to take it because vagina  can stretch wide enough to have a baby!  He just have to start out slow and use lots of lubricant and also very important ( you have to relax your body). Worrying  that its gonna hurt will only make you tense and in that case it will definitely hurt.  If hes a gentleman who respects and loves you any at all he will be gentle and go at a pace suitable to you.|`|mFLL37M5aa	My best advice would be to just slowly work your way up until you can take him.  Perhaps if you also do some of the work yourself with toys and such might help.  My best of luck to you both, especially you sweetie.  :) Be careful not to rip.|`|4kiV8CaNaa	Guess the average works good here.|`|EDXh0tk9aa	The average depth of a vagina is only 4 to 6 (or 7) inches even when aroused.  He will bump your cervix and it can hurt and cause pain and bleeding.  Since he's had this problem before, he should already know he can't go all the way in and stop trying.|`|qfSKgxDsaa	Wow that's big, he's just going to have to get used to not being able to go all the way inside you...he should still be able to ejaculate though.  You may want to try a little ky jelly and tell him to be more gentle.  It will only ruin the relationship if he lets it.  Try these tips and possibly go to a sex therapist or talk to your doctor...many couples have this problem and can work through it :)|`|9i1r2VBHaa	Looks like you two will have to do a lot of oral stimulation to save you the pain. Save the actual intercourse for the days you are in a romantic mood and take take your time.|`|1ed613bb747b97b7785ed2c62ec2b592aa	i feel your pain,girl. my boyfriend isn't as big,but hes still 9'' and it is really painful. try different positions, that should help.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|VvNKTFhJaa	This happened to me as well with three different partners (mine is 9.50).

9pLdhuBnaa	I have gotten this as well during my periods and the reason that this can occur is because of something called prostaglandins.<br>  <br>  However, I would recommend checking with your doctor as well to see what they say.
TODzjTczaa	wana get high? is dead wrong.<br>  <br>  You should be targeting your diet at about 2100 calories/day, but focusing on dropping foods made of flour, sugar, or soy.  Eat more meat, many colors of vegetables, and many colors of fruit.  Snack on nuts and seeds and cheese, and drink only whole milk (yes, really!).<br>  <br>  Your weight loss if you diet like I suggest and exercise like you claim you will should be in the 2-3 pounds/week area, and should be permanent *unless/until you start eating lots of flour and/or sugar again*.|`|B12E4rYiaa	It helps if you add overall body workout in there with weights so that once you lose you will be toned not flabby. And keep track of all you eat and drink by writing it down tracking calories then you can lose about 2 pounds a week safe weight loss.<br>  <br>   So at 8 pounds a month with you being consistent and on track it will be 2 and 1/2 months to lose 20 pounds. You must not stray from the plan or it won't work.|`|raqQPkwyaa	Hard to say for sure. You shouldn't lose more than 2 pounds per week for weight loss  so that would mean 10 weeks. The exercise is great now simply eat fewer calories than you burn off running or walking. Stay away from fast food and eat vegetables, fruits, and whole grains. Also drink plenty of water. 1 ounce per pound that you weigh.|`|m1TSG9Cvaa	I would suggest a cleansing diet. I lost 12 pounds in 9 days and then 28 pounds in less than a month. I also lost a lot of inches too!   I learned that cleansing will help the body get rid of toxins.  Toxins come from a lot of things like fast food, pollution, food additives and preservatives and lots of other things.  The toxins get stored in the fat in our body.  To get rid of the fat, we have to get rid of the toxins by cleansing the body.  This made sense to me and I decided to try a cleanse program and it worked.  The weight came off fast and this kept me motivated to keep going, not like other diets where the weight loss it too slow. I did Jenny Craig, Weight Watcher and Medifast.  If you want to learn more call the toll free number 1-877-587-4647 or check out the website.  This was the first time I ever did a cleanse, it was easy and I feel better.  Good luck whatever you decide to do!  <a href="http://thebestcleansingdiet.com" rel="nofollow">http://thebestcleansingdiet.com</a>|`|UZB8i6iOaa	well. if your eating around healthy 1400-2000 calories...<br>  you should lose about 1-3 pounds per week<br>  so about 10 weeks mayybe...?

9pLdhuBnaa	I have not heard that to be true in all cases.  The reason that I say that is because sometimes a slow metabolism can be an indication of a hormone imbalance such as with the thyroid (an example only).<br>  <br>  I would recommend checking with your doctor as well to see what they say.

9pLdhuBnaa	Yes, being on the pill or taking the injection can cause some women to gain weight but that weight that is gained is mostly water due to the hormones in the medication.<br>  <br>  However, I would recommend checking with your doctor as well to see what they say.

Some girls have these signs that you listed for a couple years before they start their period and some have them for a couple months.<br>  <br>  I would just recommend that you be prepared for your period (have pads/tampons handy) because it sounds like it will start soon. I'm sorry I cannot give you a better estimate.

pvYy6iTSaa	Dear Dance... Instead of asking many unknown persons on ANSWERS, you need to contact your OB/GYN or general surgeon who would do the umbilical hernia repair.  The best time is the present.  There may be no emergency now, and you do not want to postpone this correction.  The best time for the operation is now while you are in good general health.  Arrangements that you might have to make in the future will not be any less, but would likely be greater as your 6-month old child grows heavier and you will be lifting greater weights.  A future pregnancy would add stress on the hernia.  The operation is a simple one, likely to be done on a same day basis.  The healed surgical repair will contain stronger, hidden scar tissue which will be safer and protect you against any future sudden hernia of any intestine through the hernia space of the umbilicus.  Have your surgeon review all details and answer all your questions during a visit this coming month.  Better safe now than sorry later when life can be more complicated.|`|ziVtTtObaa	Wow lots to try and answer. Getting Pg without repair of hernia can cause the hernia to become larger. which in turn can cause the bowel be become trapped in the hernia and strangulate, which is very very serious! if you have it repaired ask them to use mesh. You then can easily become Pg with less chance of problems. the surgery is a simple out patient procedure covered by insurance. You will not be able to lift for several weeks. you will need family and friends to help with the little one.

QxF783Ipaa	Sometimes emotional distress, such as anxiety, can lead to difficulty swallowing or the fear of choking. It does sound like a bit of anxiety and your probably over thinking about swallowing as well.The causes of swallowing difficulties vary, and treatments depend upon the cause. Here are some things you could do to help with this problem. If things do not clear up in a week, I would recommend you see your Doctor. <br>  <br>  Medications can slow stomach acid production, muscle relaxants, and antacids are a few of the many medicines. Antacids between meals and at bedtime may provide relief.<br>  <br>  Gargling is an effective way to soothe your throat and the inflammation that exists. There are a number of solutions you can gargle with. Salt water is among the most popular of these. Simply mix 1 teaspoon of salt with an eight-ounce glass of warm water. Gargle the whole mixture and repeat every hour as necessary. This combination will increase the blood supply to the area by washing out the mucous and dilating the capillaries.<br>  <br>  When the difficulty does not clear up by itself in a short period of time, you should see an otolaryngologist—head and neck surgeon.|`|DJXW96d0aa	An extremely common complaint is the feeling of a "lump in the throat."  It is largely related to anxiety, which could explain why Xanax helps.  Someone must've discerned that you are experiencing some anxiety if you have that particular prescription, so this "lump in the throat" symptom of anxiety, again, makes a lot of sense.  If it interferes with your breathing, follows a specific food, drug, or environmental exposure, or is accompanied by other symptoms like vomiting, severe headache, diarrhea, or rash, then you should seek out an Urgent Care facility next time you experience it.  Otherwise, follow up with your doctor and maybe you can find a different prescription or a referral to a counselor that will help manage your anxiety and stress.

l7Q5tCpbaa	Just the fact that you remember when she lost the baby might help. My friend was pregnant with her youngest when her friend lost her baby just weeks after she was born. <br>  <br>  My friend thought she should stay away, so only phoned and invited the woman to visit if she wanted. (she did, and was the first to visit my friends baby) on the anniversary of the baby's passing my friend sent flowers and a card with "thinking of you both and wee Emily sitting on a star, watching over her mummy and daddy and her new brother or sister" (the lady was a few month pregnant again). Her friend was really touched that she'd remembered and it helped her feel she wasn't alone. From what my friend said this lady and her husband were in the same position as the other poster - the grieved in different ways and blamed themselves. Although they were pregnant things weren't the way they'd been before. <br>  <br>  Maybe you could point her towards a support group, offer to go with her if she wants. I don't think anyone truly understands unless they've been through it, that might be what she needs - someone who's lost a baby and come our the other side to tell her I've been where you are, you'll get to where I am, and we'll both get to where she is. <br>  <br>  Good luck. If all else fails - show her this thread. I'm glad she has a friend like you to look out for her.|`|2e859d32fe514ed3486570d4ec58b1e9aa	There is no one right thing to do or say for her.

God bless both of you!|`|dvQYaRNDaa	Take her out to lunch. Go shopping. See a movie together. Keep yourself available to her. This will show her that your being sincere.<br>  <br>  Don't bring up the miscarraige.

Make sure your marking your calender.|`|b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	Very normal as a matter of fact.  You started on the 1st and again 28 days later on the 28th.

Fsq9qvkqaa	1. Use Playtex Gentle Glide tampons with the Light absorbency to start. They are the smallest and this brand is very easy to insert.<br>  2. Position yourself comfortably. Sit on the toilet or put one foot up on the toilet.<br>  3. Take the tampon and hold it with one hand at the middle, ridged part of the applicator.<br>  4. Place the tampon near the opening. Angle the tampon so it points towards the lower part of your back.<br>  5. Gently insert the tampon. It can take a few tries at first, because your hymen may not be stretched enough in order to allow a tampon through. Just relax, and take deep breaths to avoid tensing up your muscles. Push the plastic applicator in until your fingers reach the opening of your vagina.<br>  6. Press on the end of the applicator tube to insert the tampon. Then, pull the applicator out. You should see the tampon string hanging out. You will pull on this to remove the tampon.<br>  <br>  You shouldn't be able to feel the tampon. If you do, then it isn't in far enough. Either try manually pushing it in further, or remove the tampon and try again.<br>  Hope this helps, and good luck :]|`|wgm9ADfBaa	try to put it in at a different angle or something. maybe you need slender ones <br>  <br>  :D<br>  good luck|`|7xc8jgLXaa	i don't know what kind of tampons you use, but i just bought Playtex Gentle Glides today. They have a plastic applicator and they go in super easy and smooth.<br>  <br>  Try again with the kind you have and see if you can get it to work...<br>  <br>  Try a different angle and make sure you are relaxed when putting it in (your muscles tightening could make insertion hurt worse)|`|DSzG23WRaa	<a href="http://www.tampax.co.uk/period-how-to-use-tampon.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.tampax.co.uk/period-how-to-us...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|D5cOFZdwaa	I agree with the 1st answer. u could also try putting a small bit of vaseline on the tip and applicator to help it slide in easier

Either way, read the whole package insert and use a backup like a condom until your pill has taken effect.|`|FjsmaFcYaa	its a precaution to make sure you arent pregnant when starting the pills, and to make sure that you don't take it mid cycle which could throw of you whole cycle , i recommend the first sudnay after your period because it is the start of a new cycle , which is what i am doing becuase i have to restart a new kind sunday|`|Vrzn4r8Qaa	If you take it the day you get your period you don't need to use another form of protection (but you should). And if you take in on the Sunday, you'd need to use another for of BC for about a week.
JhJs2cnmaa	Everyone is different so all you can do is try out and experiment more yourself. I did not have proper orgasms for a while especially with the selfishness of men sometimes you don't get chance lol!<br>  <br>  But seriously, don't worry. Some women have them all the time, some have them hardly ever if at all. It's all about finding out what works for you.|`|6YXPHVpBaa	Well you dont always get a orgasum,<br>  <br>  the longer you wait for sex the more often you will get a orgasum|`|Eec9JeXbaa	I totally disagree with the previous question. waiting doesnt help me at all....<br>  I don't have it to this day unless I use a toy... so don't worry, it'll come one day. some women don't have orgasm at all, apparently it's normal..?
tIldpr7vaa	strict diet and lots of cardio|`|rb2XqC7daa	Incline sit-up <br>  This exercise is useful.

TODzjTczaa	Easy -- eat right, and just start walking.  Walk a block a day for 3 days, then speedwalk the same block for 3 days, then jog, then run, then sprint.  During this time, cut back hard on any foods containing flour and/or sugar, and double down on the protein, especially rare beef.  <br>  <br>  Drink twice as much water as you have been, and don't miss a day.  Every day you skip, you undo two days of progress.|`|Ff1zpABzaa	i'd say because your in track, do strength training two days a week.<br>  and cardio 3-4 times a week.45 minutes to an hour in a heart rate zone between 140-185.<br>  with sprints at least two days a week(40 yard,10 yard,100 yard,etc.)<br>  you'll probably want to add in some lunges,squats,jumps, and abs.<br>  <br>  this along with a healthy diet and alot of protein should get you in shape by three weeks.
Fsq9qvkqaa	Yes. Besides stopping your period, being underweight can cause a LOT of other problems, even with your heart. It can be just as bad as being obese! Your body will go into panic mode. Your organs will even begin to fail once you reach a very unhealthy weight. <br>  <br>  Please don't starve yourself. Having a period is something that every woman has to deal with! You are definitely not the only one. Sure, they can be a pain, but there are SO many ways to manage it. <br>  I'm sorry you feel this way, hun, but you are only hurting yourself by making your period go away. Please talk to someone about this.<br>  I wish you luck :]|`|muHctmaGaa	It's called amennorhea, and you'd have to be severely under- or overweight for it, which would affect your other body functions as well. Not worth the risk.|`|SMKQ47jQaa	Don't try losing weight just to stop your periods, are your periods really heavy, is that why you don't want them, or what is the reason that you want them to stop?<br>  And also, I weigh 43 kilos and my periods havent stopped so I guess you would have to get below that weight for them to stop, but that would make you really skinny and unhealthy!|`|C6VZOpPiaa	Being drastically underweight can stop your periods, but it's not a good thing. They stop because your body doesn't have the energy to go through it... which means it also doesn't have the energy for other things.<br>  DO NOT try to do this. If you're having troubles with your periods, pain or whatever, find another way. If you just wish you didn't have to have them - bad luck.|`|Uo0b2aShaa	lbs if so stop now periods are a fact of life gets over it

ULTRJJ6waa	Wow...That's ridiculous. You need to find another doctor. I see a couple different doctors and never wait more then a few weeks for an appointment. If you ever had an emergency, you'd be in trouble. Find a doctor that isn't so over booked. Good luck :-)
Gw1LLzDgaa	I presume that the fact that there is no government insurance indicates that you are in the US.  In that case, even ERs that have to service those without insurance often give them poor treatment.<br>  <br>  Start by picking up the phone and calling the nearest Planned Parenthood office.  Explain exactly what is happening to the receptionist - just as you did here.  Ask if they can help OR refer you to a doctor who can -- be CLEAR that you have no insurance.  Alternatively call any emergency line in your city (I don't mean 911 -- but a line that helps people in crisis) -- or call a local LGBT Center if there is one.    Your mission is to find a doctor who will see him and treat him with compassion and concern.<br>  <br>  It may be an infection, but if so it sounds to be resistant to the antibiotic that they gave.  Alternatively it may be torsion.  If so I worry that he has by now lost long term use of that testicle -- and if he has, I suggest you sue that emergency room and hospital.<br>  <br>  Kind thoughts,<br>  <br>  Hermes|`|WoAAdxHEaa	well if its stones...that sucks. hurts horribly and you just have to wait for it to "pass"|`|0iHL3fLLaa	go back to the doctor ASAP!!!!!|`|DYUfnPzhaa	OK- a couple of things.<br>  <br>  He may be dealing with an allergy to the antibiotic, too.<br>  <br>  He has GOT to go back to doctor/ ER... whatEVER.<br>  <br>  He's not going to make it to any job interview if he remains in the shape he's in, and by the sound of it, he needs treatment.. NOW.|`|jdZfzZUjaa	You should go back to the ER because if it is kidney stones then those just don`t "go away". He needs surgery to remove them or it might get worse. As for the pain _& throwing up pain pills you should crunch the pills and put them in water.|`|Nq4FWEIcaa	Try to find a free clinic in your area.  While not an expert, I think something may still be wrong.  Go to the clinic and get help.  If he is not eating, he will slowly get weaker and sicker.  GO NOW!|`|W7alu42Kaa	dude go to doctor or ER and get some hottie lady doctor and help him then give him some medical for sure he will feel better|`|jBQdFiXsaa	SUX FOR HIM|`|tGihjHaZaa	You should call the physician who gave you the perscription. Tell him your problem.<br>  Did his brother, or uncle got through this also?<br>  Try eating white bread with the pills, or yogurt. (yogurt protects the stomach when taking medicine) Have him sit up for an hour after eating, and try not to make sudden movements. Drinking 7up or sprite helps with the nauseousness, i would say drink baking soda, but with the medicine he is taking i wouldnt recomend it.<br>  Hope i helped, i'm sure he will be fine, don't worry :)|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	Contact that doctor again & advise him nothing has helped & ask what should be done?|`|SLTlvqRlaa	Go back to the doctor straight away.
tIldpr7vaa	depends on the height but once u get in the 140/150 range thats gettin too big, but for shorter women it would be less|`|bl4rQm5qaa	The word overweight spells out different things to different individuals. It's a good idea to set off at the beginning, and ascertain whether you are actually overweight for your size or not, by working out your BMI (Body Mass Index). To be honest, the sole diet that definitely worked for me was wu-yi tea, it can be checked out in the resource box below, they have a few free trials in stock, it was featured in Fox News and USA Today. I shed 20 pounds, it definitely does produce success!
SCD6Pdtnaa	If it is really thick and has an odor, it might be a yeast infection. Many women get itchy when they have a yeast infection, but some don't - sometimes the consistency of your discharge is the only symptom. <br>  <br>  If it is a yeast infection, there are easy over-the-counter cures, including creams and pills. It'll go away in a few days. However, it may come back again - that's kind of the way that they work.<br>  <br>  However, it isn't necessarily a y.i. - it could just be normal discharge, too! <br>  <br>  Go to your doctor for a check-up; they'll be able to tell very easily. If you're sexually active, you may want to get the routine checks for STDs done, too. They can check for the yeast infection and STDs at the same time.|`|pexxZB8Daa	thats just discharge, it comes with puberty. i dont know when it stops|`|3zl6DrjVaa	discharge its normal!|`|Co9I2OMSaa	The white gooey stuff is called vaginal discharge and almost every girl gets it, some girls don't because their bodies just don't produce it.  Usually you start getting discharge 1-2 years before you get your period.  You can't stop discharge, it's the bodies way of cleaning itself out down there, it helps prevent infections.  Some girls wear panti-liners so the underwear doesn't get wet and feel uncomfortable and sticky.|`|J4hOL3oLaa	That started when I was about 12 and I am 24 now and still having the same issue....it's normal! Unless masterbating moves to sex with a partner and the discharge has an odor or color to it...you may have an STD|`|jgutIEjJaa	its COMPLETLY normal... its called discharge. it usually happens 2 years before you get your period.. its all just part of puberty
F4rCjV1haa	It is a yeast infection.You can just go to the store or call your doctor.You can use monastat,or what you like to try.Good Luck .If it doesn't go away after using over the counter call your doctor|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	sounds like a yeast infection alright.  My favorite treatment is Monistat 7 day treatment, just follow the instructions in the box.  If you have a sexual partner have them treat themselves too, or you can pass the infection back and forth between you.|`|hXQnR2Scaa	In the US there is a product called Vagisil.<br>  It is very well thought of for these sorts of conditions.|`|kAKMkmfZaa	Monistat is the best for over the counter or if you can see a doctor just ask for diflucan it's the best|`|gEQQzfaCaa	dont worry, u will only lose your v-jay(it will fall out) and ur eyesight and no drugs will help|`|yOr4SOO4aa	Go to the drug store and buy Monistat, and if it doesn't go away go to the doctor!
JHqFSmFyaa	wowwwwwwwww|`|EkZDP3Oyaa	They will stop hurting in a few days if that, tell him to go easy on them next time.|`|5CvocInQaa	If you take birth control that's one side effect from them that you might have. That will just go away after awhile. If you are not on any medications that doesn't effect your nipples then he is just being to rough with them or playing with them too much. Just leave your nipples alone for awhile. They will eventually stop hurting.|`|qmk2mIKpaa	hahah, idiot|`|usgKQuS1aa	this is too funny sorry.

r1yvPkdWaa	He or she must see a doctor right away. They don't need to have had a major trauma in order to have internal bleeding.<br>  <br>  Years ago, I developed ulcers on my intestines. In the long run, it ended up being due to my body creating an excess of a compound that normally exists in the body, but in smaller amounts. It was simple to treat once we figured out what it was, but it took several weeks, during which I was in pain, and very hungry, due to not being allowed to eat solid foods.<br>  <br>  If it is not hemorrhoids which could be serious--I said if it is not hemorrhoids, it IS serious--that person should get medical help. It might be ulcers.<br>  <br>  It's also very possible that the problem your co-worker is having has been created naturally by their body. But it's not very likely that it's going to go away on its own, so tell them see a doctor right away.
Fd7xayn4aa	Don't listen tobthe rest of this shizzz. the most common things that A LOT of women get are cysts in the ovaries. i get them too and it happens because when we fertilizeesss ourselves every month sometimes one will stay and build up with blood but and itss painfull but not serious because they go away on their own once they burst. then wallah the pain is gone. oh and if you get it for more then two weeks straight that means its dangerous because its holding too much blood. when you go to the gyno they will always?most likely give you b.c to prevent this because when your too fertile, this is what happens..so clearly the b.c works. my sister had this..so did i but i did'nt need the b.c|`|KpZ73Uzpaa	There are several things that it could be. Being that it doesn't happen on a constant basis it could be that you are eating certain foods that upset your stomach but may not occur every time you eat that food, sometimes it happens right away other times it just comes and goes. Another thing it could be is a ulcer. Not all ulcers hurt all the time, some are triggered by certain foods. It's best to have it checked out by a doctor to make sure that it isn't something more serious. My husband had something similar after several months he found out he had gall bladder disease and had to be rushed to the hospital. He was told once he was there that it was 6 times the size of a normal gall bladder and if he had waited even an hour longer it would have exploded and he would have died. I'd get it checked as soon as possible.|`|FFd2m9Eiaa	i get the same pains<br>  my doctor said it might be because u do excercise but it depends where it hurts if it is in the lower right side then it might be the appendix <br>  left side it might be something considering bowel problems<br>  if it is in the middle it might be abs|`|ETiITRdoaa	it is probably just gas and im not trying to be mean or just answering for points i know for a fact that its gas because that happens to my friend all the time because she has a lot of gas because she only has like 3% or her intestines|`|BzUy85n9aa	One of my family members has this, not trying to scare you but it could be a oulser or a bump inside your stomach. i would suggest going to your doctor. it could just be intergestion!

But here are some tips that will definitely help:<br>  Drink 3 glasses of any kind of milk daily.<br>  Eat lots of protein.  Meat, chicken, fish, eggs, nuts, cheese, cereals.  <br>  Eat lots of veggies!  Frozen, raw, or steamed.  Whatever you like, eat 'em every day!<br>  Exercise!!!  Get outside and play basketball!  Or run, jog, even walk briskly without stopping.  Or you can do the treadmill, stationary bike, etc. for at least 25 minutes without stopping.  5-6 days a week.<br>  Remember to stand up straight!

muHctmaGaa	It is a fallacy that Planned Parenthood gives birth control pills away for free. They offer severe discounts to low-income families or students, but the price of birth control actually increased in 2005 under the Deficit Reduction Act. Expect to pay between $20-$40.

5AaMDz91aa	I also have panic attacks.  What you need to do is stop what you are doing.  If you need to sit down, then sit down.  Take deep breaths.  When panick attacks come, a lot of times you are breathing from your chest.  Slow down and breathe from your stomach.  It should slow everything down and get you back to normal.  If that doesn't work, then I'd say take a 30 minute walk EVERY DAY.  And cut back on a couple calories.  Eat mostly fruits and veggies, protine, and a little carbs.  That should do it!  Good luck!|`|m1TSG9Cvaa	I would suggest a cleansing diet. I lost 12 pounds in 9 days and then 28 pounds in less than a month. I also lost a lot of inches too!   I learned that cleansing will help the body get rid of toxins.  Toxins come from a lot of things like fast food, pollution, food additives and preservatives and lots of other things.  The toxins get stored in the fat in our body.  To get rid of the fat, we have to get rid of the toxins by cleansing the body.  This made sense to me and I decided to try a cleanse program and it worked.  The weight came off fast and this kept me motivated to keep going, not like other diets where the weight loss it too slow. I did Jenny Craig, Weight Watcher and Medifast.  If you want to learn more call the toll free number 1-877-587-4647 or check out the website.

AA10409832	I get panic attacks, and there have been about 4 or 5 times in my life I've ended up in the ER thinking I was having a heart attack only for them to tell me my heart was fine, and I had a panic attack.  I am now on meds for them and doing fine.  Your symptoms sound like a panic attack to me, but if you want to know for sure, when you feel like this again, go to the ER and let them tell you if anything is wrong.  If you are doing cardio 3 times a week and you don't have any problems with that, I think you're fine.  I walk 5-6 miles a day, with plenty of hills and don't have any problems, but I still get panic attacks at times.  Here's what I would do.  First, I'd stop taking all supplements and herbs, etc. for at least 2 or three weeks (especially the Yasmin) and see what happens.  Then, I'd introduce them back into your body one at a time.  The vitamin first, a week later the fish oil, a week later a mineral supplement, etc.  See what happens.  If you have that "feeling" again, stop taking whatever you introduced that week and see if the "feeling" returns.  If you still don't know what is happening to your body, please go see a doctor.  Better safe then sorry.  If there is something wrong with you, it will be the best $40 you ever spent.  Good luck.|`|J4hOL3oLaa	Sounds like an anxiety attack.

If you are reading web articles about weight loss, you'll know that essentials like a pound of weight from fat is 3500 calories; that our bodies expend calories, and doesn't shut down, even when sleeping; that we do need selective food choices to supply essential energy for our bodies; and those small cuts or adjustments in our eating pattern at a healthy way can mean changes for good, especially losing weight. Indeed, they are for good, so you must know that diets which require a person to eat less than 1000 calories a day- a limit that is way below than our bodies need to survive function well- don't work. <br>  <br>  Take care of your body physically and mentally as well. I'm happy that you're physically active everyday, but be conscious in what your mind tells you in making that "diet". Don't go overboard if you feel you are not having improvements; be patient, and asses your diet plan in a way that you will not get fatigued, deprived, or less motivated.|`|47709eec385b5b119dcbc625ec950168aa	Try the Ultimate Weight Loss Solution by Dr. Phil <br>  here is free info on my blog.Hope it helps.<br>  <a href="http://losestomachfatfastburnfat.blogspot.com/2009/02/ultimate-weight-loss-solution.html" rel="nofollow">http://losestomachfatfastburnfat.blogspo...</a>|`|2eW4z4Hmaa	the best info is from here
bjcjQ4zfaa	Move over to dumbbell bench instead of barbell to fix that symmetry problem.<br>  <br>  Also the key to muscle growth is variation. So if you workout three times per week, for example, the first day do 3 sets of 5 reps with very heavy weight. Second workout day do 3 sets of 10 reps with lighter weight. Third workout day do 3 sets of 15 reps with even lighter weight.<br>  <br>  If your bench goes incline and decline make sure you mix your elevation up as much as possible too.<br>  <br>  Chest and shoulder workouts you should do:<br>  Barbell bench<br>  Dumbbell bench<br>  Dumbbell fly<br>  Dips<br>  Push ups<br>  Military press<br>  Lateral raises<br>  Front raises<br>  <br>  Be sure that you are eating a lot (especially with your young metabolism). If you dont eat a lot you won't put any muscle on. Take your bodyweight and multiply it by 20. That is the number of calories you have to eat per day. Never eat less than 15Xyour bodyweight in a day and be sure to get a lot of protein.<br>  <br>  The more different your workout is everytime the better results you'll get. Pushups aren't as effective as bench press, but that doesn't mean you shouldnt do them because anything that your body isn't use to will shock more muscle growth.

To further reduce your risk, focus on healthy eating with a menu that is low in saturated fat, and rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains, as well as staying active for life.
1vaqtRI2aa	Do cardio and weights, starting with 2 or 3 times a week.<br>  Start with 20 minutes cardio, on a treadmill or an eliptical.<br>  <br>  For weights and home exercises, try and do squats and lunges for the lower body, lifting weights for your arms, and bicycles for your abs. If you don't know what some of these are, I added links below to show you a video on how to do it.<br>  <br>  For your food, start cutting back on your intake and eat smaller portions. Six small meals a day are healthier than 3 big meals a day.<br>  <br>  Subbing bad foods for a healthy alternative is great too. Instead of regular ice cream, try Edys Slow Churned Ice cream. Instead of regular sliced American cheese, try Land O Lakes Slenderized Cheese. Instead of eating chips with a meal, eat celery with hot sauce or hummus.<br>  <br>  Once you start making slight changes, you'll notice a HUGE difference! And consider getting a personal trainer or bringing a friend to the gym. They are so motivational and help you stick to it, as do always looking at your dream body pictures.<br>  <br>  Good luck and take care!

OgQ8opeAaa	I am unsure of California's requirements for short-term disability.<br>  <br>  As far as your recovery time, I doubt it will take a couple of months.  This, of course, depends on how advanced your cancer is and the operation that you are going to undergo.  A right hemicolectomy or extended hemicolectomy is very well tolerated.  Most left colectomies and low anterior resections are well tolerated as well.  Abdominoperineal resections are much bigger procedures, though.  Also, if you have to have an ostomy your recovery will be prolonged in that you will have to undergo a second procedure for takedown of you ostomy.  <br>  <br>  Also, if your surgeon performs the procedure open, pure laparoscopic, or hand-assisted will influence your recovery time as well.<br>  <br>  The average time off of work for our patients is two to three weeks.  Those with more complex surgeries, advanced cancers, and those who experience post operative complications obviously are out of work longer.<br>  <br>  Good luck with everything.|`|AA12247459	Unemployment : you must be available to work.<br>  If you was employed then the company may have a plan for sick employees.<br>  <br>  Social Security Disability Insurance:Under the law, your payments cannot begin until you have been disabled for at least five full months.

You should see a career guidance person or even a life coach if you can get one that does not cost the earth.  You need some guidance.  Math is not everything in life.  Look at the things you are good at that are worthwhile and do those things.  Look at the things you like doing to help you to find the things you could do.  Watch 'pursuit of happyness'.  It is a good motivator.  You don't need to do the same but you need direction.<br>  <br>  Also lets be honest.  Masturbating 10 times a day is excessive.

fAFXkikAaa	Your body's immune system can indeed kill some viruses.   The flu, for example, is a virus that most people's immune systems will eventually kill.<br>  <br>  But there are other viruses that your body can not kill.   In the case of herpes, most people's immune systems get better and better at fighting the virus over time - which means that most people experience fewer and fewer outbreaks as time goes on.   But your body never completely wins the fight.<br>  <br>  HIV is another virus that your body's immune system can not kill.|`|hOxOoAFpaa	Herpes is a lifelong infection that cannot be "cured".  Think of it like the cold sores you've seen people get on their lips...it is essentially the same virus.  Unlike the common cold, influenza, or measles, once infected, we humans harbor "dormant" HSV in our nerve roots forever after.  When one nerve root awakens (for reasons that are not clear), the virus particles migrate down to the skin site that the "awakened" nerve root supplies.  Lesions (and symptoms) happen in the zone that the awakened nerve controls.|`|CHlxBbkHaa	Herpes can not be cured.  It will be with you forever.

qfSKgxDsaa	Ya this is normal :).  Just change when ever you feel uncomfortable which is usually 3 -4 hours.  Wear a big one at night as not to leak.  And then go down in absorbancy as your period comes to an end.  My periods usually last 5 days but when I first started it lasted like 8 days...so it'll change.  Also for the first year, they say you are irregular, I was always at the end of the month, but it's not un normal to get it randomly for a  while.  You might have some cramping, take tylenol and advil for that, if that's not working, call your doctor for something a little stronger or for advice on a different medication.  But these pain relievers should work.  Possibly some tylenol pm at night to help you sleep if they are keeping you up or have been pretty bad during the day.  THat should be about it.  Keep panty liners and pads in your purse at all times because you don't know when you'll start.

It was weird, but i was fine.|`|68ec1862d208420cc84a2bec07b1e67daa	Don't worry about it,it could be late for many reasons. It has a lot to do with your diet and hormones. Once my period didn't come for almost a year because I wanted to starve myself. Usually teenagers get really stressed out too and this delays your period.|`|tWEqQJ7caa	Hey,<br>  Its normal to be a week late sometimes........last month i had a REALLY heavy flow...... but then i was 2 weeks late. You shouldn't be worried if you were raped in your sleep.... it would be VERY hard! <br>  Don't worry!<br>  H<br>  PS. Good for you for not having sex! Abstince is the best choice

grKtTRYtaa	I just went to Wikipedia.<br>  <br>  Another good source is Mayoclinic.com.<br>  Both will give you much information.<br>  You seem to be very young to have MS.  If you type in your symptoms in the Mayo website or WebMD, you will have much info.<br>  It sounds as if you are getting all the tests so Dr. will be up on everything. You do sound very mature and smart for any age.  Panic attacks are serious problems.  People with MS live as long as the rest of us;  I hope that makes you feel better.|`|2stBV6XBaa	No, this doesn't sound like MS.  That is usually characterized by numbness, vision problems, problems with gait, problems with balance, serious fatigue, and an intolerance to heat.  Those are the most common big ones anyway.<br>  <br>  "I was feeling weak, I was stumbling and I felt like I was gonna faint."  That is the only part that sounds remotely like MS, but that's not enough.<br>  <br>  The MRI is so they can see if anything is going on in your body.  I assume they are going to do your brain.  If they really suspect MS, you would be getting a spinal tap as well.  Don't freak if they give you one or have.  They use them for all sorts of things, but an MRI and spinal tap are the biggies for MS.<br>  <br>  You're lucky, by the way, to have a doctor who isn't telling you it's all in your head.  That's a favorite one for doctors, especially if you're a woman, and they can't identify what is wrong.<br>  <br>  Oh, and here's a little something to read about EEGs.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eeg" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eeg</a>
9i1r2VBHaa	They do exist. You would think that nobody would be that shallow as to be turned off by them. Hell if you get to see them you should be thankful you got that far. I have them too.|`|44BEm1Uhaa	I haven't seen a Female Human tit/nipple that I didn't enjoy looking at..|`|Vj13f7zmaa	They are not terribly uncommon.

She's not a freak or anything.|`|p08021V8aa	sounds kinky... i would definitely stick my wang in the inverted nipples
HPPVtn8Maa	Well...to be straight forward, its not that your eating to little, its the diet its self.<br>  The Special K diet is a low calorie diet. But as a result you loose energy because you need calories for energy. Thus your fainting. In order for your body to have energy is to take it from your body's "emergency system"...your FAT. That would explain your loss in weight. But the lack of calories is dangerous and will lead to fainting (as you can see) <br>  <br>  The diet may be working for some people but overall, I think its just a marketing ploy to get you to eat their cereal for a period of time. Some parts of the diet is good for you, such as snacking on healthy things throughout the day, but the main thing is they want you to starve your body of food energy and eat their cereal.|`|0tenMcUmaa	well im 14 and im not one of the skinnest ppl... u know lyk those ppl hu dont EVER gain a pound? but im SUPER athletic so i burn fat of that way so i need to eat a lot or i will die... like seirously. so i suggest if you want to lose weight just do more athletic stuff and you can throw away that diet idea so ur mom wont pester u anymore about stopping and you'll still lose weight|`|r9OQcEENaa	don't diet, just eat good foods to make sure that you get the vitamins that you need!|`|xEovmKfvaa	that diet is not healthy. i was on it for a long time, only lost about 10 pounds which all came back right away. it also ends up taking away vital nutrients from your body, especially for breakfast when you need it most. i found i was always tired on that diet because the cereals had no substance, considering the serving size is only 1/4 of a cup! thats crazy! im 19 and ill tell you right you that you are way too young to be concerned about something like that. live it up a little, just remember to lose wieght and keep it off eat smaller portions and exercise more!|`|nhfaPN0Iaa	eat|`|8SRjELNBaa	eat 300 more calories at breakfast.|`|OpoETyfoaa	if u faint your body is telling u that u arnt fat and need to eat more<br>  eat full course meals that are healthy like salads and fruits<br>  an exersize. also make sure u drink lots of water. you also have 2 have your daily selection of meat like a small 6 oz. stake along with a salad or something. u need to build muscle instead of fat. or else u will just wither away.|`|DJOEV2TDaa	Doesn't seem that harmful to me, doesn't sound like you're starving yourself or anything. Just be sure to drink lots of water, you may be dehydrated.|`|gS651gq8aa	i think you should listen to your mom<br>  you should eat<br>  then again, it can't hurt to eat right<br>  try some fruits and vegetables|`|92HR06J2aa	eat more dont diet exercise. trust me. hope i helped
tBUG9DEfaa	I had a horrible time getting my wisdom teeth removed however, all 4 were growing in sideways and extremely impacted.  My dentist said that my wisdom teeth were a real piece of work but, he was up for the challenge.  I had this done when I was 15.<br>  <br>  If you can, take the happy needle and go under.  I've had lots of teeth pulled and feeling the dentist tug at a tooth in the back of your mouth while you can't feel your cheek is CREEPY.  You know it should be painful but, you can't feel anything.  If you can't feel anything, it doesn't feel RIGHT.  The hardest part was watching the needle go in my arm.  The next thing I know, the dentist was gone and the assistants were cleaning up the tools (and they were messy!).  Absolutely no memory of the surgery whatsoever.<br>  <br>  Recovery - the tough part.  Bite down on that gauze hard and make sure you change it often!  I tried to sleep off the anesthesia and in my sleep, I didn't clamp down on the gauze hard enough.  The blood in the incision area didn't clot and I kept bleeding.  I ended up swallowing so much blood that I couldn't keep any liquids, let alone mushy foods, down.  I couldn't hold down water and I vomited everything.  This was the first, and only, time I've ever passed out due to lack of water.<br>  <br>  All in all, the surgery was a cake walk and the recovery was wretched.  I wasn't fully able to yawn without pain until a month after surgery.  The recovery was the part that made it difficult.<br>  <br>  Whatever you do, remember to clamp down on that gauze to get your blood to clot and try not to swallow any blood.  Otherwise, you'll do just fine.|`|MxIdtFZcaa	that was exactly my situation but i was 17 when i did it. hated it the whole procedure wasnt bad because i was knocked out but after it was pretty bad cant eat hardly anything like soups are good but just hated it afterr but the vicodin they gave me was koool haha|`|Bpf1Z6J5aa	I just had 14 pulled out.  My dentist prescribed Valium.  It took the anxiety away.  I was aware and could follow commands.  My suggestion is to listen to music that keeps you calm and takes you to a peaceful place on your ipod.  That helped me get through my experience.  I raised my left hand as they instructed if I felt any pain.  Really the only pain I felt during the procedure was them getting me numb.  Like any other shot.  You'll be fine.  Just keep in your mind that its a normal procedure and it will be done before you know it.  Healing of 7-14 days and you'll be back to normal with out the pain of the wisdom teeth.|`|aqLcsFqIaa	I was 18 when i got mine cut out. I was knocked out to be honest and you wont remember a thing, you're still pretty high after the surgery..lol. And it does only take about 30-45 mins, very fast procedure!!! And the medicine was pretty good. They will tell you this- DON'T DRINK ANYTHING THRU A STRAW!!! You will get an empty socket and this will be much more painful than the surgery. It didn't happen to me b/c i listened, but alot of ppl told me a/b it.So don't do that. You will have to change your gauze a lot until the bleeding slows down. When you start cleaning your sockets with warm salty water, it will feel so good!! So enjoy that. I hope i helped. (^_^).<br>  <br>  *Good Luck.|`|zWBYxMvWaa	I'm getting my wisdom teeth pulled this summer but my teeth are still underneath the gum. So they will have to open my gums, pull out the teeth, then stitch me back up. I'm hoping to be unconscious, lol.<br>  <br>  <br>  But if its anything like getting my other permanent molars pulled out, the it shouldn't be to bad. Don't worry about feeling pain, at the beginning they completely numb you until you tell them to stop, then they gas you. My dentist also had headphones in my ears so I couldn't hear anything. I was sore for a few days and then I was fine.<br>  <br>  <br>  I had my molars pulled at 12 and I'm getting my wisdom teeth pulled at 15.|`|0835d5aaaff88c49c30c004c7854c920aa	I didn't get my wisdom teeth out - instead they yanked some molars so that the wisdom teeth could come in. What I remember is "Count down from 10 backwards." "10, 9"|`|2da81cc85aeb7179918ba4daff446df3aa	Don't worry so much, it won't be that bad.  The easiest part is the procedure and yes you should be put under.  The hardest part is the next day, your face will be a little swollen and sore.  Eating will be difficult the first few days but you'll recover quickly since they're just a bit impacted and since you are pretty young.  Just get it over with, it'll be over before you know it, I promise.|`|It7neypSaa	dont worry,the thing that will hurt the most is the pinch when they give you a shot,and that doesnt hurt at all,the only thing is tell them to cover your eyes so you cant see the pliars going in your mouth,thats what they did to me!!!|`|2JDCng3Uaa	my wisdom tooth hurt soo much that when it was pulled out it was such a relief|`|Shs9ditcaa	I can tell that the deal with not remembering is awesome, Ive been given that kind of treatment for procedures of my own(not teeth related mind you) and yes while you will be awake, you really could care less, ive had minor procedures done on me that i would of howled in pain if it wasn't for forgetful medicines. But what ends up happening is you either forget the whole thing or you remember it in a kind of haze like a bad dream. Be careful though under those kind of pain relief you might say things you wouldn't otherwise wanna say. I would be more worried about saying something stupid than the actual pain involved.
2LflHv23aa	My personal favorite is the playtex gentle glide. It has a plastic applicator so it is very easy to insert. You should also use a lower absorbency such as a regular instead of a super or super plus. remember when you use them for the first time to be relaxed. It is much easier to insert it. You also might want to use a panty liner to avoid a leaks.|`|31faac01721214eb794c4aeec80604b5aa	i use tampax pearl because they are so easy to use but playtex gentle glide is another good one to use too<br>  <br>  but use super on your really heavy days and regular on moderate days|`|EDjCLWccaa	They have tampons that are just for teens. Remember that there is a right and wrong way to put them in. If you feel pain then it is wrong. There are instructions on the box or you can ask mom to show you, not literally but to explain it to you. So use the teen slim ones and then a pad also if your bleeding is to heavy.|`|sGhEl7YSaa	tampons can also leak. just so you are aware of that. You don't specify your age, but as a mom, I agree with your mom. I would suggest getting always longs with wings if your having a leaking problem, If your flow is too heavy you could also add a pantyliner to the top of your pad. Or you could also as you gyn. hope this helps.|`|yJ31VS79aa	Ob are the smallest tampons, they also hold quite a bit.<br>  They also conform to your body.

rb2XqC7daa	To gain weight and be healthy you need to consume more calories than you burn them every day from healthy, protein enriched, and nutritious foods and choose the right types of exercise. <br>  Exercise a little like mild weightlifting to develop muscle. <br>  Take tuna, salmon, flax and walnuts. They contain healthy fats like omega-3. <br>  Take meat, fish, poultry, nuts, and legumes. They contain protein. <br>  Take fruits, vegetables and whole grains.

tIldpr7vaa	its a form of cardio, its for losing fat
ECLgs44Uaa	you kind of answered your own question by posting in the "diet and fitness" section.<br>  <br>  You need to eat a healthy diet.  Firstly, eat small portions more often (split your 3 big meals into 6 small meals), this will keep your metabolism flowing through out the day.<br>  <br>  For muscle eat / drink pleny of protein, this is what muscle needs.  Make sure you have protein in the morning otherwise your body will potentially use your muscle as an energy source.<br>  <br>  Eat carbs, but no in excess.  Try and have a pasta dish around lunch. <br>  <br>  Go the gym 3+ times a week!  Do weights (dont push  yourself to far too fast, build your muscle there is no quick fix for this!).<br>  <br>  Do plenty of cardio, this will increase your speed and stamina as well as loosing your fat.  <br>  <br>  You need to keep a balance between doing weights and cardio.  You want to build muscle but at the same time burn fat.  To burn fat you need to do cardio and ensure you have carbs (carbs are burnt first and help burn fat).  You then need to build muscle (protein comes in handy here).<br>  <br>  This is just a rough guide, I would seek advice from a personal trainer if you are wanting to take this further.<br>  <br>  Just remember, getting back into fitness is a slow and steady process.  Dont over do anything otherwise you will either A - Give up due to tiredness or B - Get an injury!<br>  <br>  Also remember diet is more important than the gym.  Keep your body happy!!  Drink 0 alcohol or as close to 0 as you can.  Eat less sugary food.  Eat when your hungry, but only until your full and not to excess and keep your metabolism ticking over.  Eat a balanced diet, and cut out junk food!  Keep your muscles happy with protein.  Get to the gym!<br>  <br>  Make this a lifestyle change and not a quick fix.  Anything you do that sees quick results will end up doing you more damage in long term.  Get into a routine your happy with and you can sustain!!<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|S7DmmIwraa	get off your butt  and start being athletic again.

I worked off twenty pounds, it definitely does produce success!|`|9oYdGmmiaa	well how old are you? this tells alot...if your just enter your adolescent age then this is very normal and do not worry about it. <br>  <br>  Though working out isn't bad so here are some tips:<br>  1-Your arms and legs cannot grow muscle just by moving, they need weight or friction. Arms-do alot of weights. Legs-run, jog or even swim, swimming is better for you so that you dont get archritus or anything like that.<br>  2-your torso doesn't need weights to gain muscle. Cruches or even just flexing for long periods of time over and over even help. <br>  3-if you do a little big here and there with your arms legs and torso that will shape your body. but to also be either. more fast [as you were conserned about] try doing work that will make your heart pump and breathe fast. This works your entire body. and makes your heart and lungs alot healthier.|`|qCtCsGtbaa	Find a Judo club near your residence and attend at least twice a week.

83205fb34700949ba53315bffc459748aa	well, you may not like to hear it, but it does take more than a month to see results- it took me 2 months. if you are really active every day, you might simply not be eating enough calories. there is such a thing as too few calories and too much working out.. so try having one 'bad for you' meal a week. go eat a greasy hamburger or whatever. i used to workout hard core 6 days a week, and wasn't really loosing weight- i got sick and couldn't workout like that, and i lost 10 pounds. i maintained my healthy diet, but only did light workouts and saw results that way.. so now that i'm back to hitting the gym hard, i just boost up my calories.. have some cake or ice cream or whatever i want. a fad diet really isn't going to help you. you may loose some weight doing slim fast, but it won't be lasting weight, and it doesn't teach you how to get your metabolism working, and making your body work for you. just stick with the healthy diet and working out.. it'll pay off.. add in some weights, switch up your routine.. our bodies get accustomed to what we do, so changing it up will keep your body guessing, and keep the calorie burn going strong. just think about it... it really is the best way...|`|niZBsn9Qaa	ok... I know what you're going through. It sucks, I was in the same boat, I'm on my second month now (started right after christmas) and just now seeing results.<br>  <br>  use an online calorie journal. I use www.my-calorie-counter.com  It is amazing for watching what you eat. If I were you, I would limit your calories to 1200 a day. Not less than that because if you do that, you're body will go into starvation mode and you dont want that.<br>  <br>  Up the cardio to a solid hour a day. If you cant do it all at once, do two sessions of 30 minutes<br>  <br>  make sure you are drinking about 2 liters of water a day (like a half a gallon). That is imperative.<br>  <br>  dont pay too much atention to the scale and get a tape measure. Muscle weighs more than fat so you are most likely gaining muscle under the fat, which is good because the more muscle you have, the faster you will blast away the fat.<br>  <br>  you need about two solid months to start seeing results, any weight lost quickly at first is normally just water weight. BE PATIENT. You didnt gain it over night and you definately wont lose it that fast either.<br>  <br>  stay away from fad diets, once you start eating "normally" again, even one or two days (like a free weekend) you'll gain back twice what you lost. I have that experience and it sucks worse.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|nWjnuYDUaa	Whatever you eat now, eat half of it. If you still can't lose weight go to the doctor because it could be your thyroid.|`|MnewrjTAaa	Have you tried counting calories?  Count calories and see what your daily average is.  If it's 2000 calories or less, and you still haven't lost weight, then take your food diaries in to a dietician and get her thoughts on your problem.<br>  <br>  I've known people who thought they were eating healthy, but were consuming between 3000 and 4000 calories/day!  Very, very few women would lose weight with that kind of food intake.|`|sZOiNdD5aa	well, maybe your body metabolism is too slow to burn all the carbohydrate that you take, have you heard of crevax? well, if you don't, it think you really need to check it out, i've been using that for almost a month and it really works.|`|tZLtCfA4aa	your doing for well.

But it guess you could go back to no sex. that way you would at least be<br>   close to being a virgin|`|f937adff5f3c4cccb61efe94f84f8a09aa	no. once your not a virgin you wont ever be one again. the term virgin refers to someone who hasnt had sex yet. once you have sex, your not.  theres no way to go back in time and take back having sex, so once you do have sex, your not a virgin. <br>  <br>  some people say your not a virgin when your hymen breaks, but this isnt true. a hymen is a little thin flap of skin that partially covers the entrance of a vagina. ussually when you have sex, that has to be broken or strectched in order for the penis to get in, and thats why it hurts for girls, most of the time, not always. but  a hymen can also be broken other ways, such as using a tampon, or strecthing or riding horses or any physical damage or force such as falling. this doesnt happen alot but how is it fair to say someone who hasnt had sex isnt a virgin when their hymen broke because of something esle and they havent had sex? its not :]<br>  <br>  after sex, you never be a virgin. so make sure its what you want and with you you want. and i dont think your ready, expecially after this quetion. you need to be educated about everything about it and the possible consequences.|`|MOcAhQXcaa	Honey u will never be a virgin again !!!

9ko5WUFkaa	You release an egg on one day (your ovulation day).  However, sperm can live inside of you for up to 72 hours.  If you have sex a day or two before you ovulate there can still be live sperm to fertilise the egg when it is released.  It takes a couple of days for the egg to  make it's way out of your body so you can still get pregnant those few days after your ovulation day.  So from the 2-3 days before and after ovulation you can get pregnant.<br>  <br>  Hope that makes sense.|`|BRDqfAy3aa	see below - "Ovulation" and "Fertile Days"|`|1gnNDagMaa	ovulation is when the egg begin its jounrey through the fallopian tube, than fertile is just a term to describe ur best day to get pregnant, the best day  for the sperm to easily make it to th egg.|`|TiX5Z4Zbaa	<a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=ovulation+days+and+fertile+days&fr=ush-ans">http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=ovulati...</a>
AA10789965	no it is not harmful...|`|TsjqzanQaa	Masturbation is good for you, it's natural and normal, and I never heard of it causing back pain.<br>  <br>  It will cause testicular pain if you stop, which is "blue balls."      Becoming aroused without ejaculation is the cause of "blue balls."<br>  <br>  Retention of semen without regular release irritates the prostate gland.      That's why regular ejaculation is healthier for this essential male organ.      The irritation over the course of months and years causes prostatic problems and can lead to prostate cancer.<br>  <br>  Masturbation also relieves sexual tension and stress.<br>  It can't give you an STD, and can't make anyone pregnant.       <br>  <br>  It's only harmful when if interferes with normal activities and relationships.<br>  <br>  It's not as good as sex, but it's a darned good substitute.<br>  <br>  It feels good, and I masturbate regularly when I don't have sex.

VtqdeSQ8aa	That's only about 1000cal. You should eat about 1250 a day to keep your metabolism from slowing down.|`|TODzjTczaa	No, you didn't.  You're not getting enough amino acids, essential fatty acids, vitamins, minerals, or even calories. <br>  <br>  That's right -- you're not getting enough calories.  You need at least 2100 calories every day.  Eating fewer calories than that will not lose you a single ounce of weight -- all it does is put your body in 'starvation mode' and make you tired and cranky.<br>  <br>  What you should be doing if you want to lose weight quickly is eat more, smaller meals (to keep your metabolism up), and eat ABSOLUTELY NO sugar, flour, or soy products.  The first two put your body in "burn carbs, store fat" mode -- the last disrupts your endocrine system and tells your body to put on hip, butt, and thigh fat.  Finally, shoot for 2000 calories -- 800 from protein, 600 from fat, and 600 from carbohydrates (which should ALL come from fruit and vegetables).|`|Jz0GtOUjaa	The most effective way to burn fat is to consume less food and move more often, the issues arise when we really try to put that into operation! There are plenty of stumbling blocks in the big wide world don't you think?! The only diet which definitely showed results for me was wu-yi tea, it can be viewed in the resource box underneath, they have a limited number of free trials remaining, it has been reported in Fox News and USA Today. I lost 25 pounds, it definitely does produce success!|`|91eGsbvmaa	Please be careful about restrictive eating and calorie counting. Your weight sounds to low if anything.

Exercise is a good mood enhancer, go out with a good friend, read a good book do things that make you happy. If you can figure out the stresses in your life and work on dealing with them to be more manageable.

It was very difficult for everyone, but Mayo was wonderful.  <br>  You don't want to go through that.<br>  Not drinking really isn't hard because many people don't drink;  we keep no alcohol in the house.  I just have to remember not to buy any!<br>  I wish you well.  I tried AA,  which is great for some people.  I had some counseling, but I just needed to quit.

I wish you the best.  <br>  If I can be of any help, come back on here by editing your question, and I will come back here tomorrow.|`|Sozc3MyFaa	The other answers are totally correct.  What is over 1 million is probably one of your liver enzymes (or LFTs--liver function tests) (?).  In any of your liver enzymes are elevated that means profound liver damage & drinking will triple or more the damage.|`|hfigZbx5aa	If ANY liver result were over 1 million, you'd be dead. PARTS PER MILLION is what you're reading. And there's probably a much smaller number close by. And considering drinking is hard on the liver, only a complete moron would drink with liver disease to begin with.

mqXyDTwwaa	They're not protein powders. They're weight gainers. Besides protein, they contain a lot of carbs and fats. Weight gainers are just food, so it's ok to mix them, because you mix food all the time when you eat regular food. Mixing them won't make your muscles any bigger, because, like I said, it's just food.
rhHgrohdaa	I am sorry to say this, but i think you are wanting to be pregnant so bad, you are tricking yourself. If you were pregnant, and as you said you would be three months, you would show on a test.

Sj9Z8jJKaa	i don't understand why you'd be self conscious about trying to lose weight in front of your family?? uhm, that's the healthy good thing to do!! i say you should just do it, who cares what they say? they're the stupid ones for not following along with you? just eat less, and if they ask why say you're trying to lose weight, if they poke fun then tell them they can eat your left overs and get fatter while you lose the weight lol..<br>  <br>  well, you should also try to exercise, even if it's in your room by yourself (if you don't wanna go outside and run) you can do lots of stationary exercises.. do jumping jacks, sit ups, push ups, squats, lunges, run in place lol..<br>  <br>  you should really be open about this to your family, i commend you on wanting to get healthier, but it's a real downer when you don't have the support.. make the food yourself then that way you know what goes into your cooking and eventually your body|`|ZLt8TwOiaa	you could always volunteer to cook healthy meals for the family , try new things make them healthy .|`|tZLtCfA4aa	i think your family should support you trying to lose weight. it's not the easiest thing to do. you got to commit yourself. i think it's actaully better for your family to eat healthy. i've lost 33 pounds in 6 weeks and my self esteem has gone up,my blood pressure is down,i've lowered my risk for heart diese and diatbeites. I can fit into clothes. and i fell great but i still got 47 pounds to lose....so yeah
grKtTRYtaa	Definition<br>  Addison's disease is a disorder that results when your body produces insufficient amounts of certain hormones produced by your adrenal glands. In Addison's disease, your adrenal glands produce too little cortisol, and often insufficient levels of aldosterone as well.<br>  <br>  Also called adrenal insufficiency or hypocortisolism, Addison's disease can occur at any age, but is most common in people ages 30 to 50. Addison's disease can be life-threatening.<br>  <br>  Treatment for Addison's disease involves your taking hormones to replace the insufficient amounts being made by your adrenal glands, in order to mimic the beneficial effects those naturally made hormones would normally produce.<br>  <br>  (For the record, JFK suffered from it.)
a5MzSF5qaa	Yes it works your core because you're trying to balance yourself all the time. It's good add-on ab exercise in conjunction with crunches and other ab exercises.|`|h21PoIcraa	It is good for the abdomen. You tighten your abdomen when squatting to keep your balance, therefore working out your muscles every time you squat.
y5CsUK0uaa	it generally affects the hypothalamus, which is one area of the brain that regulates sleep function...although that's not the cause of this disorder, just the part affected by it. the current line of thinking with narcolepsy is that we are missing a certain amino acid called hypocretins (orexins), which is found in the hypothalamus. theory is that it is an auto-immune problem, with our immune system mistakingly destroying those hypocretins in utero...potentially by the mom getting something as simple as a cold while in their second trimester of pregnancy when the hypothalamus is being formed.<br>  <br>  interestingly enough, babies born in march have a higher incidence of narcolepsy, while those born in september have the lowest. no other months play any role as they are all about the same. reasoning (they believe) is because pregnant moms are more prone to picking up colds in the late fall...and those in their second trimester at that prime time are more likely to be due for delivering their babies in march.<br>  <br>  probably more info than you really wanted, but it's a pretty fascinating thing. :-)
h7igZipgaa	I think you need to see a doctor on this one!<br>  If you only poo once a week thats really bad....<br>  You supposed to poo like once a day if im not mistaken,<br>  But yes you should really go see a doctor and eat alot of fiber until your appointment.<br>  Here are some things I reccomend you to eat :]<br>  <br>  whole-grain breads and cereals (which have more fiber than white bread and white rice) <br>  apples <br>  oranges <br>  bananas <br>  berries <br>  prunes <br>  pears <br>  green peas <br>  legumes (split peas, soy, lentils, etc.) <br>  artichokes <br>  almonds <br>  <br>  Also see if you can go to the supermarket real fast and buy some Fiber One (Yogurt, Cereal, etc...)<br>  <br>  Good Luck Hun and get pooing!|`|ziVtTtObaa	we all have bowel movements differently but once a week is worrisome. Try increasing your water intact. eat fresh fruit and increase your fiber intact. All of these help stool form more softly which moves thru your colon more easily. Also buy a stool softener (NOT a laxative) this will soften the stool so it can pass more easily. if none of this helps you should see your MD to make sure you don't have a peristalsis problem. Good luck|`|AA11703652	YIKES! I "poo" at least twice a day, and only when I feel like I need to, too!  It's weird to poop once a week!!!  If you are eating ANY fiber at all, you should have a BM at least once a day.  Think of all that STUFF fermenting inside your body.....|`|ZIC9c4h7aa	take lacksidifs and get your goal blatter checked|`|bStEdyqEaa	your supposed to poo every day. go see your doctor, and there are some medicine for that you can get without a perscription|`|usgKQuS1aa	um you wouldn't live for too long if you didn't poo.  Go see your doc|`|xCfsGI0Kaa	My aunt has this problem and she usually takes laxatives except your not supposed to take the that often. You should take one and see if that works. I think oranges are supposed to work for that too. There is also this yogurt thats supposed to help your stomach and metabolism and all that. it is called Activia and that should work too. if those things don't work, then i think it might be good to go see a doctor because that might be hurting you even if you don't realize it. I hope this helps.|`|1y3UjoHraa	you should see your doctor because you should 'poo' like everyday to be healthy. And yes eating once a day doesnt help- try eating three square meals a day with healthy snacks:)|`|jxYiY42Eaa	eat some apples|`|vPI1hVGUaa	My girlfriend had the exact same problem.I basically told her to change her diet.This is what you need to do. <br>  <br>  Water keeps you away from dehydration. This is one cause and the other is it allows the passing of stool in an easier manner. When the amount of water is less in the body, it compensates the quantity by drawing water from the colon region where the fecal substance is formed. As a result, your stool gets hardened and you face the constipation problem. <br>  <br>  Most important thing is to starting adding fibre to it. You can begin with a bowl of oatmeal, and along the way can add several pieces of fruit, and a bran muffin together with the nutritious oatmeal. Pears, papaya, prunes, figs, blackberries and raspberries are some of the fruits that have high amount of fiber. Most people will find that increasing your intake of fiber will serve as a healthy and natural way of putting a stop to constipation.<br>  <br>  Another great thing to try is Salba fibre. This works like a charm and you can buy it from the health store. Salba has more dietary fibre than any other food.  It helps improve your digestion, end constipation, maintain healthy blood sugar and cholesterol levels, fight disease even promote a healthy weight.<br>  Studies suggest they provide remarkable protection against free radical damage while also helping your body protect against allergens, viruses and other age-causing toxins. They’re most potent in food sources such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains like Salba.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!
3b43628da17fa39fdf0695aa42cc5afdaa	To lose weight (fat), include more fibrous slow digesting carbs, as opp. to the fast digesting ones. <br>  <br>  No white breads, fast foods, sodas (not even diet) no ketchups, sugar, only skim milk, not 2%, skim and whole grain non sweet (sugary) cereal, whole wheat bread, maybe buy some soy or whey protein.<br>  <br>  Include lean meats like ham, and other sources of protein. Avoid red meats. Take a multivitamin, calcium and vitamin d every 2 days, one or two V8s a day (or every other day). <br>  <br>  Don't starve, eat small healthy meals. A lot of small meals opposed to a few bigger ones-- make sure is has at least 8-10 or more g of protein, not too much protein because the body can only digest a certain amount at a time; and avoid too many fruits, carbs and sugars. Fibrous veggies, greens (no starches or potatoes) are good, and no BBQ sauce (unless used sparingly) and not too much (if any) salad dressing. <br>  <br>  Before bed (2 hrs), eat something with protein, don't<br>  eat many carbs before bed. Eat some of that good cereal in the morning, you need quality carbs, just not too much, and the slow digesting ones.<br>  <br>  Do slow crunches until you can not do anymore, jog stairs (be safe though), warm up first and do sprints, short bursts of intense activity is very effective compared to long weak activity, just don't over do it. Also include some slow but long endurance jogging. Be active!<br>  <br>  Jog stairs ;and also do some lunges until it burns, do this every day or 2 days, keep going and don't give up, same with eating, you need some fat, so one or two fish oils daily.<br>  <br>  Eat fish (not fried, be careful, very careful for bones) Peanut butter on whole wheat (no jelly), which has protein, and don’t worry about the fat in that. Avocados, has fat, good fat; eat it when your hunger cravings get you. <br>  <br>  When you do crunches, also twist on some to work your sides, keep tension on your abs. <br>  <br>  <br>  Need more info, go to <a href="http://www.bodybuilding.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bodybuilding.com</a>|`|5nfqY9T7aa	There's no such thing as losing weight fast.

jHOo1D3Zaa	I'm sure it's just temporary. I was also on a diet before my birthday, and I went out to eat twice over my birthday weekend, and on the Monday morning I weighed three pounds more. A few days later those three pounds had gone. <br>  <br>  When you're on a strict diet your metabolism gets a little messed up and then when you indulge, your body wants to hold on to every extra calorie. A lot of women also gain two or three pounds right before their period, so it could be that. I'll bet after a few days you're back to normal, providing you don't continue to eat loads. If your bmi is 19.2 you don't need to worry about it though, just eat healthy and exercise, and ignore the scales!|`|Eg1G2mvVaa	Try not weighing yourself every day, it will only get you stressed out and then you may eat more because of it.

They have spent years studying and will be more knowledgeable than you on this subject.|`|jO3rt1bTaa	yeah you can ask him to calculate your body fat perhaps and then give you an estimate on what the average for your age is.|`|raqQPkwyaa	Your doctor can do this and if there is a serious problem your doctor will give you instructions and maybe hook you up with a nutritionist. You can check your Body mass index online. This will tell you what category you fall into: underweight/normal weight/overweight/obese. It is a gauge and doctors use this all the time. That's why you always get height and weight measured when you visit the doctor.|`|03g0WSvZaa	Yes <br>  <br>  try the Lil Jack workout <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKCGe2Ezris" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKCGe2Ezr...</a>

Your body can't tell the difference.<br>  <br>  Edit: Sure I did. I answered your last question. I'm helping you out by saving you about $40 on a bottle of vitamins, since there's no difference between "organic" vitamins and Centrum Multivitamins.

There is a known condition called Argyria  caused by the ingestion of elemental silver, silver dust or silver compounds.  The most dramatic symptom of argyria is that the skin becomes blue or bluish-grey. Argyria may be generalized or local. Argyrosis is the corresponding condition related to the eye. The condition is believed to be permanent, but laser therapy has been Since at least the early part of the 20th century, doctors have known that silver or silver compounds can cause some areas of the skin and other body tissues to turn gray or blue-gray. Argyria occurs in people who eat or breathe in silver over a long period (several months to many years). A single exposure to a silver compound may also cause silver to be deposited in the skin and in other parts of the body; however, this is not known to be harmful. It is likely that many exposures to silver are necessary to develop argyria. Once argyria develops, it is generally believed to be permanent. The condition is not merely a "cosmetic problem".   Reports of cases of argyria and a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency? statement suggest that 1 to 4 grams of silver or a silver compound taken in medication in small doses over several months may cause argyria in some humans. People who work in factories that manufacture silver can also breathe in silver or its compounds. However, the level of silver in the air and the length of exposure that caused argyria in these workers is not known. It is also not known what level of silver causes breathing problems, lung and throat irritation, or stomach pain in people.  Argyria that covers the entire body is not seen following skin contact with silver compounds, although the skin may change color where it touches the silver. However, many people who have used skin creams containing silver compounds such as silver nitrate and silver sulfadiazine have not reported health problems from the silver in the medicine. <br>  <br>  On December 20, 2007 the world press published stories about Paul Karason, a California man whose entire skin gradually turned blue after consuming colloidal silver made by himself with distilled water, salt and silver, and using a silver salve on his face in an attempt to treat problems with his sinus, dermatitis, acid reflux, and other issues|`|lPO4D8PLaa	The only 2 that i can think of that really cause gray color (really gray) is Ingesting silver and certain antibiotics (chloramphenicol).<br>  <br>  Poor circulation (present in diseases like diabetes) can also make the skin look kinda gray.

lPO4D8PLaa	try wikipedia.  its great for info like this.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thallassemia" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thallassemi...</a><br>  <br>  Firstly, you have to understand the basic structure of hemoglobin:<br>  Its made up of a total of 4 polypeptide chains:  heterotetramer, (αβ)2<br>  so, each hemoglobin has 2 alpha and 2 beta chain polypeptides.<br>  <br>  Thalassemia:<br>  Basically, the excess of a certain polypeptide causes the thallasemia.  An excess of Beta chain causes alpha thalassemia (there is a problem in making enough alpha chain polypetide).<br>  An excess of Alpha chain causes Beta thalassemia (there is a problem in making enough beta chain polypeptide).<br>  <br>  So, there is nothing wrong with the polypeptide chains but there is a differency the amount of the polypeptide chains.<br>  <br>  This is different from something like sickle cell disease in which the polypeptide chains themselves are screwed up.|`|AA11846603	Basically all you need to know that with Thalassemias, these globin chains are missing, which cause the anemia to occur.  These anemias are called microcytic hypochromic anemias, causing your red cells to be small and hollow.  When you are missing these chains, you cannot make hemoglobin correctly, causing abnormal molecules to form.  These abnormal molecules are the reason that the anemia forms.  Hope this helps!

I am not sorry I did it, at least my first time was because I wanted it and not because some randy 16 year old had nagged me or got me drunk.  I have never had sex outside a relationship, and whilst I do not condemn it - if you decide to do that you will have to be prepared for the reputation you will get.<br>  <br>  Whenever you do decide to have sex just make sure that you are protected and that you are sure you are really ready, you can't take it back.|`|oPJ3vBxEaa	how long have you guys been together? make sure he is the one for sure and that you guys have been in a relationship for a few months before you do it, otherwise you will regret it. Trust me.|`|C8Djjxqkaa	Sounds like you have made your decision.|`|JmD0oq2Naa	why dont you actually go out with him, like be in a relationship and wait a few years before you have sex.|`|vmzIYlEAaa	Don't disrespect yourself by giving into his ways. He said that he wants you not loves you so why put yourself in such a situation. You will regret it and he wants to sneak out tonight that just shows he can not wait to have sex with you. Lose your virginity to someone you actually love not someone that wants to lash and leave. Many boys of today will sweet talk you into believing that they love you but the reality is that they don't and girls fall for it time and time again. If I were you I'd seriously think about it - is it worth the pain and emotions. You may really like him but you don't know how much he likes you and you will never know. Boys should work hard to get the girl they like not just say one or two words to make things lovey dovey.|`|eka2laLfaa	well......if u dont really know him then dont  do it, lose ur virginity to some1 that u have been in a relationship with for a while and actually truly love, not just havea crush on! because remember u can only lose ur virginity once, u dont want to regret it!<br>  Also ur under age! if hes 16 or over, he can get prosicuted! think about that<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|TF7gdNPvaa	DOn't do it.If you do it.Next thing you'll know that you'll be pregnant with your boyfriend leaving you.Wait till you get married.Or at least use protection.He just wants to get into your pants.SO don't do it.That's what all boys want.BUt he wants it right away>JUst don't doit.Get to know him as much as possible.He just wanna have sex with you.The once you end up pregnant.He'll leave you.|`|djnE97PAaa	FIRST OF ALL, get to know this guy before you run <br>  off and do anything with him. The last thing you want<br>  is to do it with a guy and then have him leave you after<br>  because you were "easy" so I would get to know him<br>  first. Your virginity can wait until you know who this<br>  guy is and know that he will respect you. After all you're<br>  only 15, imagine what your parents would say if you got<br>  pregnant. BECAUSE protection doesn't always work.|`|3VRLJamXaa	I wouldn't. FULL STOP<br>  He sounds a bit of a 'player' he may say he doesn't have a disease or anything and I know you have said about protection but if it splits or is careless you could catch HIV and other STD's<br>  I know you think everyone is loosing their viginity around you, but wouldn't you rather be in a stable relationsip and loose it to someone you really love!?<br>  Hope this helps.|`|EgoGwz4paa	i dont think u should do it. u shouldn't even go cuz (sorry) but he might rape u if u say no. so just stay inside and be safe. sex should be based on love not like. so wait til u're sure. also wouldnt u wanna know if he has any diseadses b4 u do it with him? i would<br>  so just dont do it!!<br>  Hope I helped!!|`|QSF6FF2Yaa	sha g whatever and whenever you want., i do.<br>  <br>  just dont sha g him then runaway or they with think your a sket.<br>  <br>  sex is sex it hardly matters to anyone now|`|eCKNRcIVaa	I know you say you know how to stay protected but do you?  Have you had all of your guardisil shots yet?  What about cervirex shots?  Did you know that condoms do not protect you from HPV and Herpes?  Do you know you can get just about any STD from oral?<br>  Also the fact that you are talking about "sneaking out" scares me.  This means no one will know where you are?  What if something awful or unforeseen happens to you?  No one will even know where to look for you or that you are even gone.  So for these reasons I think it is a bad idea right now<br>  I personally have never believed in the whole "virginity" thing...  I don't think virginity is some special prize or gift or what-ever these right wing people are preaching these days... However I do believe in being mature and personally responsible.  I know sex is an immense responsibility and the younger you are the harder it is to shoulder.  Do you know about UTI's and how common they are for young sexually active women to get?  Do you have a doctor or planned parenthood you can go to?  o you have money in case you need medical help or something unforeseen happens?<br>  Also if the boy is older he could be charged with statutory rape.  Aside from all of that, you do have to worry about how much people talk...  If that matters to you at all.  At your age this is quite big news and likely to spread quickly and sadly girls are still labeled as "sluts" in this country, there is still a horrible double standard.|`|MYABesO1aa	you really shouldn't have said that you're 15 because then people just tell you not to do it and don't give you proper advice.<br>  i think that if you think you're ready then you should. i wouldn't have sex at 15 but tbh it's your decision, not anyone on YA! talk to the guy about it, if you're comfortable enough to talk to him about it with him then i would say you're close enough. make sure that he won't just leave you after you've had sex. <br>  <br>  i hope this helped you make a decision.|`|c2415d71b96d211b01cd85ea7ebe2899aa	DO NOT DO IT!!!!! I am fifteen and lost my virginity about a month a go and I don't regret it at all. <br>  but I have been going out with my boyfriend for a while<br>  and I really love him. We didn't do it just because we wanted to lose our virginity.<br>  We talked about it first about if we were mature enough to handle the consequences.<br>  and you know what? a week ago the protection ripped and I'm freaked out.<br>  you do not want these stresses on you with a guy you hardly even know.<br>  If I am pregnant, my boyfriend will be there and I know that.<br>  with a guy you just met I highly doubt it.<br>  Hun, seriously consider this before you do it, you do not want to be worried and all that stuff especially with him.<br>  =D good luck.|`|ortUnxFtaa	I say you wait, its just your hormones kicking in.

80aDsO21aa	I feel your pain, sometimes mine get so bad I have to go to the hospital. But, the best things I've done to help them is you can go to any drug store(CVS, Walgreens) and buy those heat patches that people use for their backs and knees and stuff and they last for 8 hours usually and put them on your actual skin where it hurts that usually helps it for me or whenever you're home get a heating pad and just place it where it hurts, also soaking in a warm bath helps too and even though you don't want to take medicine Advil works also, although I have to take 6 of them for it to do anything. Hope you feel better!|`|tmGRe2Jraa	An over-the-counter pain medication like ibuprofen or Tylenol can help, but if you're unwilling to take any medication at all there isn't a whole heck of a lot you can do.

Some stretching can also help -- it hurts a lot at the time but can help you feel better.

To be able to lay down and have them clear put a couple pillows up at a slight incline, and put a humidifier near your head.

RGKdb0wHaa	I was diagnosed with papillary thyroid carcinoma with lymph node spread when I was 26 and what they did for me was remove my thyroid and the lymph nodes that were effected and a few more just to make sure and then 6 months after surgery I did a round of radiation with is just a iodine pill that you take and a full body scan to make sure there was no uptake but in my case there was so they gave me a higher dose and now I do the RAI body scan every 6 months a so far all is perfect.  From everything that my doctors told me and I went to Mayo Hospital is that if you had to choose a cancer to have just because you would want thyroid cancer because it is very slow growing with close to 100% cure rate even with lymph node spread and recurrence  hope I was able to help
IDgSVPBxaa	First of all you need to find a way to get the ecstasy out of their system so way of purging it.  You need to get them in the shower; however do not let water enter their mouth or nose they can drown.  Never submerge a person in water that's overdosed.  You can call 911 anomalously and say someone has had a drug overdose or give an AKA if your really worried about your parents.  Remember the key here is to keep the person calm as well don't let them get over excited that can make it worse.  I lost a family friend to Oxycontin overdose.  And I've lost a friend to Barbiturates overdose.<br>  <br>  <br>  This is instructions on what to do:<br>  <a href="http://www.gmhc.org/health/gay/drug_overdose.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gmhc.org/health/gay/drug_over...</a>|`|1KqknaUHaa	You never get in trouble for going to the hospital for overdoses so no matter what, take that person to the hospital or call 911.<br>  <br>  If you would get in trouble [with the law, your parents would get mad obviously] because you called 911 for overdoses then a lot of people would die because they wouldn't want to get in trouble so don't be stupid and let the person die.<br>  <br>  <br>  :]|`|pA2hYm7Aaa	dont take more than 5 and you wont overdose... problem solved. haha  and dont get sketchy pills. make sure they have clean designs and look legit, and look it up on pillreports.com just to be safe... its a site where a bunch of people test the pills and tell people about their experience with it... but make sure you look at the ones posted around your area or the area they came from so you know they are talking about pills from the same batch as yours<br>  <br>  but yes there are dangers and near overdoses can happen, but ive never really heard or been with anyone that was to the point where they needed to go to the hospital... i could tell you some stories about taking too much... haha but you would have to email me for thosee...
805d5aa14fdca671ed6b65dfbb2b1962aa	Three things work:  Water, vitamin C, and time. Drinnk lots of water, like two gallons a day to flush out toxins from your system, take to help the process, and even so it will still take anywhere from a week to a month depeending on how much you took in. A doctor can help you monitor your levels (in private) so go get tested so you'll know for sure.|`|29iRZqkdaa	I'm not sure. but if u smoke weed. you should stop it!<br>  <br>  Not cool!|`|FKR45WLPaa	There is a tea that you used to be able to get at GNC that supposedly will give you a negative urine test.

Weed can be detected for months after use, especially if you have more body fat, since it will have more places to hide.<br>  The only way to do it, really, is to flush the damn stuff out. Get diuretics--try creatnine and uva ursi, and drink tons and tons of water. You will piss like a racehorse with prostate cancer while this is going on.<br>  <br>  ALTERNATELY, you could always do what a friend of mine used to do when he was coked up and had to submit to urinalysis at his place of employment:<br>  --Take a small bottle or vial and fill it with saline contact solution<br>  --The morning you have to take the test, take a bunch of vitamins so your urine will be a bright, radioactive yellow<br>  --Put the small vial of saline in your undershorts and keep it there so it will be body temperature<br>  --When you go in the bathroom to give the test, pour the saline into the testing container they give you, then put three or four drops of urine into the saline solution and shake it up. <br>  It will turn a pale yellow that will look exactly like urine and it will definitely pass a urinalysis test. <br>  He pulled that trick every week for four years and they never caught on.<br>  <br>  Caveat emptor: if you try that and it doesn't work, you can't sue me. ^_^|`|BNrQSYwhaa	Don't listen to the Uneducated.For a Urine test it's 14-30 days depends on your metabolism For a Blood test it's around 90 days.Drink Cranberry juice it speeds up the process.Pee before the test so it's less concentrated  when you pee in the cup|`|JMnu0rBiaa	I knew a guy who took a cap of bleach, came up clean the next day on his drug test..

At the most use acne soap, drink lots of water, see a dermatologist and pray! BUT NEVER POPE A PIMPLE!   Just let the pimple go away by itself. Toothpaste won't help... JUST LEAVE IT ALONE! That way it wont' scar!|`|iB22RWkGaa	overnight.
yezbmlaKaa	There are a couple of things you can try. <br>  <br>  You can heat up some water, take a towel, dip it in the water, and then apply it to the pimple. Make sure the water won't burn you. Do this for a few minutes (keep re-dipping the towel in the hot water, applying cold water won't do anything). <br>  <br>  Buy an over-the-counter zit remover. I use Burt's Bee's Doctor Burt's Blemish Stick. It's natural and dries out any underground zit I've had. <br>  <br>  The last thing I would recommend is using some toothpaste. Apply the toothpaste to the blemish, leave on for fifteen minutes, then wash off. Be sure to wash it off or else it will cause you more problems.|`|eQZYW6BPaa	i would keep putting the benzaclin on but most of all just stop touching it. i would say thats the biggest problem most people have.|`|UVwRSpDjaa	I don't think there is anything you can do for an in grown pimple.

dl1yuCoFaa	It could be that you just have dry skin. Try rubbing yourself down with a good quality lotion that contains dimethicone. Massage lotion into your skin after a bath or shower to help retain moisture in the skin. <br>  <br>  If you do indeed have body lice (scabies), as another answerer referred to, it will show up as a red itchy rash, with tiny red bumps in a group or a line. Scabies tend to appear in body creases and areas that are warm and moist, such as armpits, groin, backs of knees, etc. They also tend to show up in between fingers and toes, and places where clothing is tight against skin, such as waistbands, tops of socks, etc.|`|MzOmEFQNaa	Use Aveeno (oatmeal) bath. See if that works. Also if that doesn't work, get a small tube of the psoriasis ointment and rub that on the itch. That's two I know and they work. But depends of course on your special case. You are healthy like the doctor said, just itchy. Try those two things.|`|n0tde6Ifaa	My younger brother once had a similar case like this, he was fine one day and the next he was itching EEEEEVERYWHERE!!!<br>  <br>  it took several trips to a specialist to finally realize that he actually had an uncommon skin louse disease with close relations to crab louse, the STD. he ended up having to take these special chemical detox-type baths for several weeks to get rid of the horrible louse all over his body.<br>  <br>  do you have lots of body hair?? that could have a lot to do with it...
74e542f00dc27cdbe7595f52050a58a7aa	First of all it is safe, but probably not effective. You can also try ORAJEL. It really depends on what is causing the pain. If it is a surface problem then you should get some relief. If it is the lower part of the tooth you could be hurting yourself. You don't want to hide or mask the problem.

So even if you were to walk for an hour a day it will take you almost 3 months just too loose 1 kg of fat. Also you can not take of fat from a certain body part by working out that part particularly. I am telling you all this from my own personal experience i was a little over 100 kgs , and trust me at that time in desperation i have bought anything and every thing that claims to make you loose weight. Non of them really did what they promised. I then learn t from my own research that then only way to loose fat quickly and permanently is by working out and eat healthy, that when i came across the X - MELT program from X attack its a in home based training program , with tons of fun workouts to do at home itself with out any equipment and also custom made nutrition plans by some hot shot nutritionist. Its highly effective healthy weight loss program. I came down to 78 kgs in 3 months of this program. The best thing i liked about this program is the amount of knowledge their staff has to offer, also how they weren't just interested in having to loose weight but also give my body a great shape for the first time in my life. I as a happy client of theirs will totally recommend this program to anyone looking forward to loosing weight. Here is their URL if you want to have a look at their website for more info.

hjViDMAEaa	The reason for all this is the lack of social interaction and social and academic goals. You are avoiding phone calls and your parents and probably everyone else because you want to hide your problems and attract attention to people. Unfortunately, continuation like this will further cause more problems. <br>  <br>  You need to go and socialize. Have fun and find an interest in socializing and academics. Seek out friends directly. Before you do that though, be calm and be yourself. Do not try too hard to form a good impression. Join clubs that interest you. Be active in organizations. In general, people do not always introduce themselves first when you first go to a club meeting or similar. In this case, you must introduce yourself first. Be confident and be yourself (most important). Have no fear of messing up. You got nothing to lose after all; failing multiple times will not stop a future victory.<br>  <br>  It is going to be hard and long and you may have feelings of giving. Things take time to solve and do not give up. You may have thoughts that you suck at socializing but that may not be the case except for the lack of confidence and too hard an attempt at forcing an conversation. Basically be normal and do not avoid and try too hard. <br>  <br>  As for your academics, you may want to speak to your advisor/professors about your problems. <br>  <br>  I strongly suggest you to see a psychologist if you continued having problems. Most colleges provide this service for free.|`|5179a1324042a48534d847e9c5593c69aa	tell yourself your out of shape and weak. remember all the times you were pushed around, then force your self to go outside and run, and exercise and get into better shape.<br>  <br>  hey it worked for me.  <br>  <br>  or you can get a part time job.|`|AoTXk53Daa	Just turn it off and do some homework. Or go outside and do something athletic. Go to a game at your high school or something social.|`|ISHIDwawaa	sounds like you may have depression. Depression is caused by a biochemical imbalance, and don't be alarmed its about as common as the common cold, and its not a big deal. <br>  <br>  I recommend taking l-tryptophan, 1000 mg 3 hours before bed time, or get alteral at GNC. this will help you sleep. Get yellow colored lens sun glasses and wear while on the computer. The blue light given off by a computer screen actually makes it addictive (it prevents serotonin conversion into melatonin which prevents sleep and makes you feel happy) The yellow shades will block the blue light.<br>  <br>  The l-tryptophan (found in alteral as well), actually works better as an anti depressant than the prescription drugs. Its safer, and its naturally found in food. Think of depression as the modern version of scurvy, when sailors lacked vitamin C they got sick. Tryptophan, like vitamin C, is an essential nutrient to life. Instead of scurvy symptoms, a tryptophan deficiency causes OCD, depression, migraines, and insomnia. A likely cause of this deficiency is that its very scarce in diets.<br>  <br>  Tryptophan is an amino acid that will raise your serotonin levels and help you sleep, and feel more confident. The confidence boost will help you socialize more, feel happier and this happiness will make you more likable around other people and help you meet new friends. <br>  <br>  You will also need to take a multi vitamin B everyday, make sure it has ALL vitamin Bs, b1,b3,b6,b12 etc...<br>  <br>  Get magnesium,zinc,calcium vitamin too. <br>  <br>  Eat salmon, its got all this in it that you need. Salmon is like an anti depressant in of itself. <br>  <br>  I'd also recommend getting a job in a social setting, this will allow you to waste time making money, building up a resume, and help you meet new people. I'd highly recommend going away to college as this will help make you make friends. Request to live in a freshmen dorm with a lot of activities. DO NOT LIVE IN AN HONORS DORM, or other non social dorm. The social activity will make you feel satisfied and content with life, and not make you feel driven to waste time on a computer. This social activity will actually help you with school as you will feel content with your social needs and won't require the computer, you will also do your homework as you will be in a more positive mood. <br>  <br>  Avoid alcohol as this will worsen the problem. Also consider joining a gym to waste time working out, besides there are a lot of people you can meet at the gym.
74e542f00dc27cdbe7595f52050a58a7aa	First of all, did your doctor do any tests, XRays or any other diagnostic tools to reach his conclusion? If not why did he reach this conclusion? Are you a hypochondriac, or complainer? If not you should get a new doctor. A diagnosis should be based on fact, not opinions.pp
KZCQWkfQaa	Fingernail clippers. its not a scratching post.
SQLSOeHcaa	My daughter is the same age as you and also is experiencing the same thing. Started as lower back pain that eventually radiated to the hip and groin area.<br>  She was diagnosed with having a tilted pelvis, and the MRI shows a tear at the level of L5 (lumbar spine)... <br>  <br>  From what you said it seems to me that you probably pulled something, especially if it happened all of the sudden... have you try taken motrim or an antiinflammatory medication?, cold and heat pads also might help to alleviate the pain...I think you should try to sleep on you back with a pillow under your knees, get some good pair of tennis that offer support, also support for your back, maybe trade the stool for a chair... <br>  Sounds like it could be sciatica, do you have pain down your leg as well?... It could also be bursitis of the hip.<br>  The best treatment for hip bursitis, or any form of bursitis, is aimed at controlling the inflammation caused by this condition. As with any treatment program, always talk with your doctor before initiating any specific treatments. The general treatment of hip bursitis consists of: <br>  Rest<br>  This usually means a period of time not participating in sports or activities that aggravate your symptoms. As a general rule of thumb, any activity that causes hip bursitis pain should be avoided--this only contributes to inflammation of the bursa. <br>  <br>  Best of luck|`|5PIgZ7tFaa	Sounds like sciatica, an inflammation of the nerve that controls the leg. There are medicinal and non-medicinal treatments. <br>  Google "sciatica."<br>  I've had it myself on a couple of occasions, and it's not pleasant. A doctor can prescribe some inexpensive medication that can lessen or even eliminate the pain. It may be you just overdid the workouts and irritated the nerve with the lack of back support.|`|7nDVrxsDaa	Hey, what's up? I've got the antidote, just what you need. Come on, I've got society, whipped.
muHctmaGaa	My mother is a nurse and comes home to warn my two sisters and me about these cases. Usually you can feel resistance when trying to insert another tampon (even if it fits). Sometimes you'll notice a smell. This would also put you at risk for toxic shock syndrome.<br>  <br>  Technically you still have your period because menstruation doesn't happen in the vaginal canal.|`|hxvjeApFaa	theres one where for the tampon to go in your vagina|`|EN7LrJZRaa	When you pull out the second tampon, the first might come out. If not you'd have to put your fingers inside and try to feel for the string. It CANNOT get lost inside of you. You will feel the string and be able to pull it out.<br>  <br>  If you do forget you have a tampon in, you can be at risk for TSS. Toxic Shock Syndrome. Most of the time you'll have a fever and muscle aches before you actually develop the syndrome. After getting it, you'll have a fever and a rash. Along with other symptoms such as a headache, abdominal pain, and dizzyness. The rash will be sunburn like and cover most of the body.<br>  <br>  And have a tampon in you will not effect the regular days of your cycle. If you have a heavy period, you may bleed out even though there's a tampon in (this is probably how 2 tampons would be in at once.) And your period will last the usual amount of days.|`|rhuhp6KCaa	you will still have your period but its dangerous to forget the tampon inside of you, alway check to make sure that you take out one tampon before putting in another. After your period is done make sure you clean down there properly then you wont have a problem with leaving the tampon there. after 4-8 hours you have to take the tampon out it can cause and infection because the old rotted blood will still be inside your vagina. <br>  <br>  It will have a very bad smell too!|`|1UD6eEvwaa	Haha, ive totally done that before. I just space out sometimes. Or ill just forget i left one in and am like.. wow that period was really really short. lol. But no. What happened when i did that, i put a second one in and then later, when i took it out, two came out. I gotta admit, it hurt alot though. But yeah, they both came out. And then ive done that another time too actually. But it didnt hurt hte second time. <br>  <br>  But if you just put one in and forget it. I think that the string will eventualy come down again. Or you will start to have an uncomforable stinging kind of pain.  YOu'll notice it if it is still in there for a long time.|`|1Lzin0w0aa	lol u siily goose. the symtom is a big bloody tampon up ur vagoo lol
M3sVQm2Maa	My NP tells me that it's much more accurate to count from ovulation than from your last period. In fact, to record the date of ovulation, she counts back 14 days from the start of a period. <br>  So if you can track when you're ovulating, it should be fairly predictable from there.|`|qfSKgxDsaa	that's what i've heard...when you are expecting your period, where a panty liner so you aren't freaking thinking you've started, because if you do, it's okay you have a bit cause you are covered :)
CTVkz71aaa	The stool is made up of a large percentage of shed cells from the walls of your small intestines. These cells are constantly renewing themselves. If you are not eating this is mostly what your stool consists of. Also don't forget that there are solids in most drinks such as juice and milk etc. Only water and minerals and vitamins are absorbed from those liquids and the rest is fecal matter.<br>  Your stool sounds normal for what you are going through, but you do need to digest some fibre. Try some oatmeal ground fine in the food processor or blender and cooked in milk to the consistancy of pudding. Add a bit of vanilla and sugar to make it taste good. It's easy to get past a sore mouth and will not irritate your ulcers.<br>  If your stool is an abnormal colour such as yellow green black or red call your doctor immediately.|`|DJXW96d0aa	BMs are actually not my major concern here.  I'd suspect most MDs/Nutritionists would be more concerned with the fact that you haven't eaten in so long.  Diarrhea is never a *good* sign, but I would recommend that you visit a doctor and mention your symptoms in this order: 1) Haven't eaten in 4 days, 2) d/t painful mouth sores, and 3) only BMs have been small amount of watery stool.
qKe39aAMaa	well, undergrad= 4years + Med School= at least 4years, not counting internships, etc. I think your looking at 9+ years at the minimum.

DJXW96d0aa	1.  Possibly, but it's extremely unlikely that you'd catch a genital strain from oral contact.<br>  <br>  2. There's always a chance that you didn't catch HPV, but the odds are not in your favor.  If you caught the virus, there isn't any reliable way to test you for it (females can be tested, but not men... yet).  You'll probably never show symptoms, and if you do, it will likely only be warts (which are NOT painful or deadly and are easily removed).  BUT (and this is a big but!), you could be a carrier of a strain of the virus that can cause cervical cancer in a future female partner, so you owe it to these (potential) girls to be honest, tell them the truth and USE PROTECTION until both of you have been tested for other diseases and are totally monogamous.<br>  <br>  3. Yes.  And you *can* be tested for herpes.  I'd recommended getting tested for gonorrhea and chlamydia as well (two other super common ailments).<br>  <br>  The following link is from the CDC and may answer more of your HPV questions.  Good luck!|`|V8fLpQpQaa	1. It's possible to get any STD from oral sex, but unless it's something like herpes in the mouth, it's very unlikely.<br>  <br>  2. You aren't guaranteed to get HPV just because you had sex without protection. It's possible and you put yourself at risk, but it's harder for males to get STD's than women.<br>  <br>  3. It is also possible that she could have contracted herpes from the guy she cheated on you will and passed it to you. Go get a blood test if you don't have any other symptoms for herpes, but keep in mind, but blood tests for herpes are not 100% accurate.|`|hOxOoAFpaa	1) Probably can't get HPV from oral sex, but most people (yourself included?) don't ONLY have oral sex. Many, many people have HPV and don't know it.  In fact, more than half of people with HERPES SIMPLEX don't know they have it...no wonder it spreads so easily.<br>  <br>  2.) The best answer here is: if you KNOW someone has HPV, the only way to be sure you don't get it is to not have sex with her/him.  Condoms decrease the chance...they do not provide complete protection.  That goes for HSV, chlamydia, gonnorrhea, HIV, hepatitis, or any other infection that can be transmitted this way.<br>  <br>  3.) Chances are that she had sex with the guy more than once.  It takes awhile for an infection to occur (think of your "colds" every winter...they "develop"...they don't just go "bang", like popping a balloon).  Anyway, IF (even though it's unlikely) she only had sex with this guy once, and it was JUST the day before you had sex with her...you MIGHT be safe, because it MIGHT have been too early.  But there are no guarantees.  I understand WHY you want guarantees...but that just isn't the real world.
4yzxXO1haa	If you're at school, you can speak to the school nurse and psych/counselor. Also, look up your local kids helpline or depression line. (I'd find it for you, but I don't know where you live. If you want to message me, I'd be more than happy to find it for you.)<br>  <br>  If you can manage it, get an appointment with a GP. Your family doctor, or another one if you like. You don't have to worry about them telling your parents - if you ask them not to, they are bound by law to follow your wishes. The only way they can speak to your family without your consent is if they have reason to believe you are planning to commit suicide, or are likely to harm others.<br>  <br>  Also, try searching Google for online depression support sites and chatrooms.<br>  <br>  You're welcome to message me if you like.<br>  <br>  All the best.|`|ISHIDwawaa	Take multi vitamin b(all the vitamin bs, b1-b12, tryptophan 500-1000mg a day, vitamin c, and eat some salmon.<br>  <br>  Depression in most cases is a deficiency of part or all of those essential nutrients mentioned above. <br>  <br>  If this doesn't work after 2 weeks of constant use, then go see a psychiatrist. Your depression is not a psychological thing, its a nutrient deficiency. <br>  <br>  Let me guess you have or had migraine head aches often in your life, and insomnia? <br>  <br>  You parents love you by the way, I'd highly recommend you tell them eventually. This is not your fault, its simply a vitamin and nutrient deficiency that effects 1/5 of americans to some extent.|`|pR2hy0bjaa	Woooahh.. Your just like me. What i did was did positive things. Watch movies/ Shows, play games, Hang out with friends. Do stuff that makes you happy. You could wait until you can get Anti-Depressant But that requires you to tell your parents. Good luck buddy!|`|cuVP1Afraa	Yes ur right about that u definetely are going through depression and eventhogh u don't want to tell ur parents u need to soon tell the one that u trust the most first if u don't have one that u trust more then think of of who u would probably trust more the reason u need to tell ur parents is because u need someone to support u I know this because I'm going throught the same or at least I was until it finally got so bad that i was being completely rude to my and saying bad things about them behind there back which they din't find out about for a while but after a couple of really ingorant weaks of me being mean to my parents my mom started saying u need help u need to go to boot camp I was like no and finally about after a month or so she called the doctor and they gave me meds for depression it took a couple of days but omg did it help trust me when i say i know what im talking about you don't want it to go that far I felt horrible about what I did oh yeah about me talking behind there back that was to the friends at church it got so bad that they stopped talking to me and im still picking up where i left off b4 that happened things are alot better for me now please don't tell my story to anyone if u talk to anyone if u have a counselor at ur school go to them first see what they have to say they will probably tell u that u need to tell ur parents just tell them how u feel and whats going on its a start un til u feel comfortable with talking to ur parents I didn't tell my parents eithier but they found out and things got worse fast from there I just don't want the same thing to happen to u trust it s not worth it that just makes things worse.I hope this helps u if u ever want to ask anymore questions ask here i will always be looking for questions to answer I'm sure I will find yours.|`|vhVZFmGWaa	Hey honey<br>  <br>  I had the same problem at school. It felt like i fell into a huge time trap and it wouldnt ever end. You make 'friendships' but know that if push comes to shove, they'll run for the hills if you get into trouble. Its completely terrible and degrading, but thats highschool.<br>  <br>  The best you can do is take it with a grain of salt. Not many people make any sort of friendship with substance in high school. People are too interested in boyfriends and girlfriends. <br>  Dont expect much from them. Learn to rely on yourself and your family. Control your life. If someone does something bad, you stop it. Dont rely on your friends. <br>  <br>  See the school counseller or a professional counseller outside of school. They give you strategies on how to  deal socially and emotionally and they really do help. Its not mumbo Jumbo. They help you realize your power. <br>  <br>  Look into other forms of education like college courses, nightschool, studying through a job (ie you get a job and they put you through a part time course for training for the job)<br>  There are so many other forms of education these days, its fantastic!<br>  <br>  Make yourself do things outside of school. Push yourself. Sport is EXCELLENT! You meet new people, your body releases mood enhancing endorphins and you get fit. You wont feel like it or enjoy it at first, but you must push on because it will get to the point where you look forward to it again. Eventually you'll be glad you done it.<br>  <br>  And lastly, focus your energy on something you love. You probably spend so much time thinking about school it gets ontop of you. <br>  If you love to paint or love cars, take a night course. If you love building things, start a project you can work on over time. <br>  <br>  Remember highschool doesnt last forever, and when you get into the workforce, all that sh*t and backstabbing is erased. <br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  x

1Sdacs28aa	The only way I know of to check your "tightness" yourself, without the aid of a professional, is to get these vaginal dilators that are made for a problem called vaginismus, which makes sex extremely painful because you're so clenched up and tight. They come in a set and are measured so you can see which one you can...er...fit inside you and it'll tell you how tight you are in centimeters.<br>  <br>  But honestly if you've never had a baby and you've not had TONS AND TONS of sex then you're probably very tight.

To be 'loose' just means you have streached out your vaginal area making contact during sex less intense.  It is not good to be to loose or tight.  However if you feel you are loose or just want to strenthen those muscles you can stop and start urinating for a few seconds.  You can check by seeing how many fingers can be inserted natrally.  1 is tight, 4 and more are loose, and inbetween is average.|`|UJnzVNcSaa	wow weird question but good way to know is if your a virgin.

AFqZEOlRaa	A lot depends on how long you have been working on it.  The first 5 or 10 pounds are always water weight, so if you've been doing it for less than a week or two, this wouldn't be unusual.  And some of it depends on how overweight you are.  While you are heavier, it is a little easier to lose weight than later when you only have ten pounds to lose.  You didn't mention breakfast, so it's also possible you are eating too few calories.  If you keep this up, you will find yourself reaching a point where you can't lose weight unless you drop to extremely unhealthy calorie levels or excessive exercise.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, if this is the way you have been living for some time, there may be something wrong.  You might need to get your thyroid checked.|`|Bp7Yfsqyaa	3500 calories is one pound of FAT.

Even natural drugs can end your life pretty quickly.  Hope I helped.|`|jqXL4JDCaa	LSD is definitely not natural.
EYrdHJQeaa	not so sure that is a good idea.  sometimes things you eat have way way more calories than you think.  i would count all calories.|`|kdXTunqgaa	My friends and I are following weightlosssecret.info. I have lost 8 kilos now since December. It is three meals a day with absolutely no snacking. Loads of water between meals, water or herbal tea or black coffee only between meals. Each meal is well balanced and I am not hungry at all. My other friend has a bit more weight to lose than me and she has lost 11 kilos since she started. All info is at the site. You should consider it. It was recommended to me by a natropath friend

v0596BTeaa	The problem with the super size ones is that they feel ok going in, but they swell, and can be a pain (literally) to pull out!  They really are only recommended for older ladies who have had kids.  You would probably be more comfortable going down a size and changing more often.|`|LrBYeb6Aaa	try using smaller ones that are also super, ur cervix opening may be smaller, i had the same problem|`|lc9nus8taa	get the mini ones|`|bw2izUoraa	get a smaller size|`|CkdSTD1Baa	Thats very normal if you are just starting to use them, it will get better with time. You should use a smaller size though, thats probably too big for you. Just use a smaller sized tampon and change it more frequently. Make sure you are totally relaxed when you remove your tampon, and dont tense any of your pelvic muscles, because they will make it harder to remove.|`|nV7XBzGAaa	you'll get used to the feeling... it takes a while. silly as it might sound, try pushing the stomach muscles down as you remove it. the muscles can help expel the tampon for you. maybe take a step back to wearing smaller ones for awhile, and just wear a pantyliner with it... hope that helps at all.|`|pTzm38Aqaa	Smaller size you don't want to hurt your V. because if this is the first time you are using it than that's the problem.|`|QhLpr1Ibaa	i feel tha same way|`|YjtwpyQYaa	that happens to me to<br>  its normal|`|Rlm7VjeEaa	You're just not use to the size. Keep using them and you'll get use to it. When you are off, why not try stretching yourself slowly with your fingers so that you can fit it better? I did that for this reason and now I can fit 4 fingers in there. You'll get use to it.|`|0UYJkSuZaa	Are you sure you are not getting it caught on your hymen on the way out? A lot of girls have that problem. To tell you the truth that was the reason why I didn't use tampons til after I lost my virginity. If you aren't having that problem, maybe you should just stick to regulars instead of supers and just change them more often. You may be trying to use too large of ones when your body is not used to it.
XoRkPaa1aa	Yes. Our brains actually reflect actions...er... when you reach to grab a pencil, your brain is sending millions of neurons that go through the precise actions of reaching, grasping, and lifting. Now, if you watch someone else grab a pencil, (and you're not lost in another thought, really watching them preform the act) your brain will send off mirror neurons. It is simple, and like many other examples, we know without being aware that we know. (as we act without being aware of the millions of mini-actions going on in our brain). Just like when you see someone laugh, you might laugh just because, and the same when we see someone cry. This is based on individuality then (my opinion) because some people are less emotionally attached than others; so no such thing as sympathy pains in someone who isn't aware of even their own feelings. I'm pretty sure this is controversial, but I believe it based on this. Now I also believe that when you feel connected with someone, these pains are stronger. Who hasn't felt pain when a loved one is hurting in front of you? That's why sympathy pains are more commonly referred to with pregnant women, because that's the closest relationship between any two people: Mother and fetus. ...well I hope that answered your question.|`|VfsUVeotaa	yes, pity pains are real. I have one, it is that i can't eat wheat or i get the hives.Pity pains are like a disease other people feel bad for.Like if a person was sick with strep throat, you might call that a pity pain.
74e542f00dc27cdbe7595f52050a58a7aa	It sounds like the only thing that was shady was you. I think you had some wierd notion that all masssage parlors are not the same. I think you were looking for anything out of the normal. It also sounds like your disappointment was your proof that this was a shady operation. I really think you have too much time on your hands and that you are reading too many cheap romance novels.pp|`|mgH7iFjeaa	Taking a shower prior to receiving a massage helps warm up the tissue and muscles.  The steam helps open up your breathing, and the shower itself tends to help you relax and center.  All of this allows your 'regular' massage to accomplish more for your body and health as the shower has aided the therapist's work.|`|62cf745b22f4e8647a1ae0245414635caa	no it does not sound shady.
ga9dgpJ6aa	Well, for all we know it could be a w.i.l.d. lucid dream. If you have slept many hours, then fell asleep just a bit later, than it could be. Some syptoms are vibrations.

She had to wait twelve years before she was allowed to start any medical treatment; and this treatment is more effective the earlier it's started.<br>  Why should she wait any longer to complete it?<br>  <br>  Perhaps you're not aware of the strict criteria that the medical profession apply before agreeing to proceed with this treatment; for her to have surgery before 18, she, and more importantly her doctors, would have to have been 110% convinced that this was the correct thing to do.|`|65QqZBnjaa	If you knew all the facts NO.<br>  <br>  Most doctors and therapists follow the Standards of Care (SOC).  The SOC were written by an international group of gender experts back in 1979.  They have been revised 6 times since, the last time in 2001.  You can download a copy of the SOC here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.WPATH.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.WPATH.org</a><br>  <br>  The point is nobody transitions willy-nilly, it is in fact a highly regimented process.  Per the SOC 18 is generally the age requirement for surgery and for the most part everyone follows those guidelines.<br>  <br>  A bigger problem is public perception of transsexuality.  Just the language you're using indicates you believe it to be a choice.  Well you are WRONG.  People are born transsexual.  It is a brain-body mismatch that occurs in less than 1% of the population.  Their bodies got mixed signals as to how to from and as a result the brain went one way and the body the other.  You can read much more here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/TS/TS.html#anchor107763" rel="nofollow">http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/T...</a><br>  <br>  People are born transsexual and transition (what you call "sex change") is appropriate medical treatment for them.  It even says so in the SOC:<br>  <br>  Sex Reassignment is Effective and Medically Indicated in Severe GID. In persons diagnosed with transsexualism or profound GID, sex reassignment surgery, along with hormone therapy and real-life experience, is a treatment that has proven to be effective. Such a therapeutic regimen, when prescribed or recommended by qualified practitioners, is medically indicated and medically necessary. Sex reassignment is not "experimental," "investigational," "elective," <br>  "cosmetic," or optional in any meaningful sense. It constitutes very effective and appropriate treatment for transsexualism or profound GID.<br>  <br>  I think that makes it pretty clear, don't you?<br>  <br>  Okay.  So now you know people are born transsexual.  You also know that there is a rigid medical process that most doctors follow.  How about listening to the kids themselves?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Utpam0IGYac" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Utpam0IGY...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8F9CaPyQz8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8F9CaPyQ...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W17z6KeiNY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W17z6Kei...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSkQlWUX_eI" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSkQlWUX_...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ib_yE5WILJc&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ib_yE5WIL...</a><br>  <br>  Listen to the children!  They know who they are!<br>  <br>  Over the last century we have learned gender identity is inborn and unchangeable.  That's why transsexual people transition, to bring the body into alignment with their brain.  Without treatment many/most transsexual people will commit suicide.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|Vj13f7zmaa	If the person had just 'found out' they were transgendered, yes, too young.  But in the case of someone who has been expressing themselves as the other gender for their whole life, it seems appropriate.  It will be easier.. no school records to change, not really much past to have to deal with in a legal way.  Gets off to a good start in life with a sense of self esteem they wouldn't have had otherwise.  So all in all, not a bad move.  Now if the person in question had decided only months before.. then I would say very bad move.  I don't think we should concern ourselves with the genitals or any body parts of others and make a judgement about it.|`|ximWtKVuaa	Gender identity is a tricky issue for people who are not sure of theirs or are feeling troubled by the gender that their body is ... honestly I don't think anybody can say 'you're too young' any more than 'you're too old' unless they've been in that person's shoes.  I mean think about it ... how terrible would it be to be a stranger in your own body?|`|Xa9wiUnXaa	most people who have transgender issues have grown up taking some sort of hormones in order for their body to react the "proper" way. Also they have usually had a few operations so one more is not a big issue and if it will help them truly identify with themselves then I think everyone should be supportive. And transgenders usually do not go through "phases" where they feel like being one sex and then later on feel like being another. You know what makes you feel comfortable. Also Europe and the US have very different medical systems - Germany is not like the US and just try to make money out of everything. And now a days kids at 16 are making decisions like having sex, having kids etc so why is something that will make them comfortable with themselves and identify with themselves too young to make this decision. I say good for her.|`|3YLTBfzzaa	No not too early, but I have wrestled with that thought before. On the one hand being not mature in the mind, abut on the other hand if a transition is started early the results are generally better overall while the body is still growing. The biggest hassle for a trans woman is passing and I don't think she'll have any issues. She's totally passable!<br>  <br>  I wonder if things were more enlightened in my teen years if I would've transitioned back then.|`|YFmtHNkiaa	It really depends. I personally believe it is too young to make such a decision but most people who have gone public about being a transsexual have admitted that they started to realize that they felt like they should be the opposite gender during their early teen years. i have even heard one story of a man who knew he wanted to be a girl since he was 6 years old!!!|`|V5lxDoIRaa	Even though at age five I had a boys body I knew I was a girl.  At the age of twelve a psychiatrist finally diagnosed me with Gender Identity Disorder(GID), shortly after that at age thirteen I started my transition. At age twenty eight years seventy one days I had Sexual Reassignment Surgery (SRS).<br>  <br>  <br>   If I could have had it done I would have had my surgery way back at the age of five. <br>  <br>  I do not think sixteen is to young that girl is gorgeous. she and her parents should be applauded for transitioning at that age.  <br>  <br>  WAY TO GO GIRL.|`|BRd0G6lCaa	not if you know what you want, shes so adorable!<br>  <br>  why bother yourself with other peoples happiness, if you aren't getting a sex change, who cares!<br>  <br>  everyone is different.|`|iSvDvFneaa	She's gorgeous.<br>  If I was transgender, I would get my body changed as soon as possible, it kind of feels like you're trapped after a while.|`|AA11485682	Not really. If you spent your entire life knowing that you were in the wrong body, it's perfectly fine.|`|T588vfJDaa	I think so, until I was 14 I wanted to be a boy, now there's no way I ever would|`|FCVgJ8vBaa	ya, u have to be 18 for the sex change, n most people make the decision before then, i found out when i was 7 that i wanted to be a girl|`|yzgS5KiQaa	If sex changes where choices yes. But they aren't. Transsexual people are people with intersex birth defects. Their sex is a birth defect, an as obvious to them, as waking up with a penis tomorrow would be to you. I applaud the parents of these girls. I think it would be worse for testosterone to masculinize them, for them just to do it anyway. When you've lived in the wrong body for a decade an a half, you know you want a sex change.|`|lYQDCJgeaa	Looking at the photo, I think this was probably the right decision.<br>  Not being her doctor, I can't say for sure--and neither can anyone else.

AtjlmByAaa	HI, I think Crim is right, try concentrating on counts and its repetitions rather than length of time you are doing one workout.|`|N9nJWYa5aa	My own routines tend to be full body, but I would question the point of a 10min run, it's not long enough to do anything useful IMHO.<br>  <br>  -edit-<br>  Regards your comment on relaxing via the sauna.  It's fine so long as you are sensible, still do a cool down routine, rehydrate, don't use it as a weight loss aid (you only lose water)...|`|vEGkSHMsaa	Crim has the right idea. Full body workouts are the way to go for gaining strength and muscle. Also, what is the point of the running? To cool down? If your trying to gain muscle, too much cardio will hinder your gains. <br>  <br>  Perhaps read up on the starting strength routine.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://startingstrength.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ" rel="nofollow">http://startingstrength.wikia.com/wiki/F...</a>|`|gnYs5vlCaa	resting sounds good to me:) lol do it more often :)<br>  <br>  <br>  yes this is a good workout. i like it.....:)<br>  and add variations to your routine. because if you do the same thing over and over your body gets used to it and you dont get jack out of it babe.

gS651gq8aa	four days without food...<br>  that would be about 20 pounds<br>  <br>  i had to go on a 5 day fast and lost about 35<br>  <br>  be careful though|`|H9J7dCpAaa	It is a possibility to lose weight quickly but you should be realistic and accept that if you lose weight fast then you will probably put it all back on again just as fast. The one diet which definitely worked for me was wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box below, they have a small number of free trials left, it has been highlighted in Reader's Digest and CNN. I lost thrity pounds, it definitely does produce results!|`|Ftm0nNGMaa	I think the question is how much will you eat after these 4 days?<br>  The best diet is one that involves you eating normal quantites of food around noon, not to skip breakfast and take a walk or visit the gym. These will get you much better results.|`|jT1mPev9aa	Well, my sister pretty much fasted for about ten days, she lost about eleven pounds.  I would probably so almost a pound a day... <br>  <br>  the problem is that she gained it all back because her body puts on a starvation mode because it thinks it is in an environment where food is running low and therefore, her body stores much more fat.  I lose weight super slow but once off the weight I tend not to gain it back.<br>  <br>  If you want to lose weight quickly, I suggested maybe a semi-fast.  So on day one, I would eat an apple and a granola bar, and a pita stuffed with your favorite vegetables and meats.    eat an egg.  And I wouldn't eat anything else.    If you completely fast, you won't be able to jumpstart your metabolism since you won't have breakfast. <br>  <br>  And that's it.  But keep hydrated.  Your stomach will automatically shrink, I tried this and I weighed three pounds less the next day ( I also gave a pint of blood the day before mind you).  I would try this for two days.    I started to feel less hungry, and then slowly increase just enough calories so that you eat three meals that are super low in calories. I eat about a 600-900 calorie diet.  Or at least try, i have pcos so I am allowed the right to have a high calorie deficiency.  I have forty pounds to lose. <br>  <br>  Eat lots of fibre (celery has negative calories, and eat whole wheat bread).|`|iDScOWBIaa	to lose weight in four days, you can gain it back in four days. losing weight over a much longer time is a much better idea. fasting is not very productive for losing weight. you need to burn it. sauna's are AWSOME for it.|`|EuKGCrzkaa	i would say approximately 3-4 pounds of waterweight, but you as soon as you eat again, you will gain more weight than what you started off with.

No, seriously, I won't lecture, but obviously...cut back for a few days.  <br>  <br>  And even a non smoker can get a cough with a cold.  At college, you will get exposed to a wider variety of germs, and get sick in ways you've been lucky enough to avoid so far.  Just part of the college experience.  That doesn't make it bronchitis.  So don't "overreact" in the short term.  Long term...you know the drill.|`|OpwMuboqaa	A dry cough is bad.  Especially if it started out with mucous and now you are suddenly hacking all the time with no production and your chest hurts.  Then you worry that you have pneumonia.

It's an over the counter pill.   Ask the pharmacist.  It helps a lot.|`|ltMbMIPlaa	100% of smokers, i mean every single smoker without exception, has a higher level of neutrophile in their lungs. slowly you are killing your "strong" immune system. bronchitis is a definition not a disease. when you cough for more than 3 months in two years you are labeled to have bronchitis.|`|AA12159925	if you choose to smoke you will   cough for ever      very simple|`|kwEjL68haa	You may already do.|`|ELlgTuEyaa	Well smoking is bad for your health, not preaching but sitting in the pew beside you with a lit cigarette. With bronchitis or pneumonia you will suffer flu like symptoms and have difficulty breathing.  You will also have a terrible cough which will produce brown thick phelgm.  If you are worried about it, go see a doctor so they can listen to your lungs to see if there is any fluid build up there.  Normally they will prescribe anti-boitics, inhaler, and maybe steriods depending on the serverity of it. But if it takes you a week to finish a pack, you are doing good, just don't let it increase to 1 to 2 packs a day. You're actually closer to quitting than most people out there lol.

ymqL0Zeoaa	yes it can. its possible that theres a puss build up making your cheek bone soft. Puss is acidic so this needs to be drained. what you really need to do is to visit your dentist so he/she can take an x-ray and really see what it is before we jump into conclusions. Some antibiotics that 'id recommend are Tetracyclin and Amoxicillin for infections and Dexamethasone to reduce the swelling. All these meds can be obtained only when prescribed.

Theres also acid peels and stuff but i don't know how well they work.
jg1pbV5Xaa	It is simply that you have to accept yourself as you are. There may be plastic surgery for really bad ones, if you can afford it, if it is available, if your health allows such.  Life gives us these challenges, no one asks if your going to like it or not nor do they really care, sorry. You are as you are, your stuck until your next life, short or tall, fat or skinny. All things can be changed but not easily. Accept it and learn ways to deal with it. Make up can be used to cover some, check it out they make special make up for people with burn scars so if your scars are really bad that may be a thing to try. Love yourself and that is the best thing, if you can accept your looks others will be less likely to notice or forget about them after the initial sight. There will always be a few that make you feel bad about how you look, even if you looked like a super modle, laugh.|`|hdyexryKaa	its perfectly normal everybody gets them well atleast pimples but don't worry your fine hun:)

Then go to the graph for girls to see where you fit.  Your BMI is at the slim end of the healthy/safe range for adults, but kids' BMI ranges are a bit different.  I would say that you are at a very healthy weight right now and should not be even considering losing any weight, but the graph will tell you for sure.  Focus on the inner person (your personality, character, social contacts), not on outward appearance.  You can get a flat stomach by exercising your abdominal muscles.  Most skinny models are not very healthy, and risk getting into eating disorders like anorexia and bulimia, and you don't want that.

AA12266052	Most tonsillectomies are performed on children, although many are also performed on teenagers and adults. The number of tonsillectomies in the United States has dropped significantly from several million in the 1970s to approximately 600,000 in the late 1990s. This has been due in part to more stringent guidelines for tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. Still, debate about the usefulness of tonsillectomies continues. Not surprisingly, the otolaryngology literature is usually pro-tonsillectomy, whereas the pediatric literature has the opposing view. Enlarged tonsils are removed more often among adults and children for sleep apnea (airway obstruction while sleeping), snoring, and upper airway obstruction. Children who have sleep apnea can do poorly in school, are tired during the day, may be bedwetters beyond what is normal, and have some links to ADHD.<br>  Using a humidifier at home can also bring some comfort. Your child may experience alternating good and bad days for 2 weeks after surgery. It is a good idea to keep your child away from crowds or ill people for 7 days, since the throat is highly susceptible to infections during this period.|`|1cec78892e2912eecfe0874cf01092afaa	I do ont know. ask ur dr.

You will have had your "worry time" for the day, and can just write down any more thoughts that come to mind, and say to yourself: "Well, I'll just have to worry about that tomorrow, won't I?". It's important to regularly monitor, and deal with a negative internal monologue (self talk), or mental process, such as disturbing thoughts, images, impulses, or emotions, by the process of (a): recognising it, and (b): challenging it immediately. Technique For Re-Programming Negative Thoughts: When you notice something negative, such as: "I can't do this/ am never going to get over this!" or: "Why am I always so pathetic/useless/such a loser?" or even an image, emotion, or a memory; recognise that it is being generated from the negative part of your mind. Having identified and labelled it, visualise a large, red, flashing, "STOP!" sign, and/or possibly a stern faced person wagging an index finger at you in a negative manner, then say to yourself as forcefully as you can, even aloud in a big voice, if alone: "I know this tactic: GO AWAY FOR A WHILE !!!" You may want to use either: "ruse", "ploy", "game", or "trick". In the case of an image, visualise a large "STOP" sign, or your preferred version. <br>  <br>  Some people go so far as to keep a wide rubber band in their pocket, then put it around their wrist, when they catch themselves backsliding, stretch and release it, as a method of reprogramming their mind sooner, but I don't regard it as being strictly necessary. Remember to remove it, afterwards, if you use this method. Try replacing a negative thought with a positive affirmation of your choice, like: "I am a unique individual, with my own set of skills, and good points", or "I may not be perfect, but I'm doing the best I can, right now". Practice one of the relaxation methods in sections 2, 11, 2c, or 2i, daily, and when needed. Tai Chi, or yoga suits others better. Give the EFT a good tryout, to see if it helps you. There is a version for use in public places, (you can claim to have a headache, as you massage/lightly tap your temples, but you would then be restricted to subvocalising: saying it to yourself in your mind). Section 53, at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> refers: "Even though I sometimes suffer from anxiety, I deeply and completely accept myself." Or Google: "neurofeedback; therapists" Herbal remedies, such as chamomile, passionflower, or St.John's wort, are often effective, but the idea is (as with anxiolytic medication) to use them like water wings, or training wheels on a bicycle, providing initial support, and giving time for other treatments, such as therapy, and relaxation techniques, to take effect.|`|spXPpyP0aa	I have been feeling the same way latley =[|`|0bjQfb01aa	You can't control what other people think, so you shouldn't let it bring you down. By worrying so much you are missing out on all the fun things in life. First you have to work on your self-confidence and it might be helpful to talk to a counselor, trusted adult, or doctor.

pzLDXL6gaa	Yes, the pill can be pretty effective for acne but doesn't work for all women. It can also take a while to start working. There are many different pills available and some are more effective against acne than others, some have side effects (in some women) and others don't. You might have to try a few to find the right one for you, or you may get the right one first time. Definitely I would recommend it for your acne though if you've tried antibiotics, and instead of/before Roaccutane.<br>  <br>  There is one pill Diane 35 aka Dianette and Juliette which is specifically designed to treat acne, it is not available in the US though. I have also heard of Yasmin and Ortho Tri-Cyclin Lo being used.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|BYHmKxpdaa	Some pills will, some pills won't. It all depends on the person. I have actually found help with Differin, but I think you might be too young to use that. Also Benzclin in the daytime, and using Cetaphil face wash twice daily. I have been on some bc pills that have actually caused acne. You could try them, and if you don't like it or see no improvement then stop. Hope this helped! Good luck from one acne sufferer to another!|`|fZgwb1rqaa	I started birth control at 14 to help clear up acne too. It did help a lot! Make sure you talk to your doctor so you are prescribed the right kind of pill. Just make sure you take it when you are supposed to or your period can start unexpectedly. Also, if you are on any kind of penicillin or antibiotics along with your birth control it lowers the effectiveness of birth control (as a contraceptive), but won't stop it from clearing up your skin. Just be aware! <br>  <br>  Now I'm 21 and stopped taking birth control about 3 months ago, and my face still breaks out a little bit more than when I'm on it. <br>  <br>  It won't necessarily 'cure' your acne, but it helps control your hormones which is the usually the reason for acne in the first place. <br>  <br>  I would definitely recommend it! Besides, what do you have to lose besides the acne?<br>  <br>  Also, I used Yasmin all through high school and it was great but I started using the Nuva Ring in college because I kept forgetting to take my pills. ALL birth control pills have side effects, but your doctor won't prescribe you on them they think you are at risk.|`|2LNNY4Pgaa	yes.. its a good choice.. <br>  there is many different pills for many reasons and thats one of the reasons so you will be going on the right one..<br>  it does clear up acne but you also have to be careful what you eat and how much you exercise like normal..<br>  its a good option to as you will now be on it for life and you have a contraceptive for when your older and are to embarrassed to ask your parents..
vRJRT0QAaa	To build better muscle, you need better proteins. I suggest you check out www.sdevkumar.qhealthzone.com for health supplements. U need to weight train ur self for 2 hours 5 days a week. Do 3 sets of each excercise where the weight increases in every set. Work out 2 body parts a day such as<br>  1. Sunday-Shoulders and legs<br>  2. Monday- Back-bicep<br>  3. Tuesday- Chest Tricep<br>  4. Wednesday- Bicep and legs<br>  5.Thursday- Shoulder and Chest<br>  6.Friday- Streching exercises. This is crucial. Muscles build up only when they are at rest. Streching them ensures that u dont leave any knots and they function to their full capacity. Drink ur protein before you workout and immediately after you work out.<br>  Make sure u rest one day of the week. That allows ur muscles to build. If the body ever feels sore. Do not over do it as it locks ur muscles. Do ab routines every alternate days NOT everyday.<br>  Stick to this cycle and u shud c some difference in as little as a week. By summer, even if u dont get as big as u plan to. u will definetely get in perfect shape.|`|fTJMI05oaa	Change your workouts to 6 days a week.3 of those days cardio in the morning then cardio about 10 hrs later when possible.On weight training the other 3,do whole body circuit workouts-meaning pick about 1-2 works per large muscle and do it.
kK4GG6Z2aa	Possibly an allergy of sorts - some people are sensitive to any form of 'smellies' especially in the home where there are plug in air fresheners, using powerful smelling washing powder and fabric conditioner for example. Could be central heating coming on too early in morning before you wake up - always wise to have some fresh air in the bedroom if pos.  Old foam pillows that disintegrate with use over time and cause you to breath in the dreadful stuff.  Could also be blocked sinuses. Many reasons for a blocked/stuffy nose. If any of the above don't 'ring a bell' so to speak.  Talk to doctor and ask if you can have an allergy test.  A blocked nose can affect your sleep as you can only breath through you mouth..causing dry mouth and a bad nights sleep...even if you aren't actually aware of it..Are you feeling tired for example. Hope you get it sorted soon - it can be so uncomfortable. Good Luck|`|4V2Odsygaa	you may have a deviated septum or a sinus cyst.|`|bTfR8OnDaa	I suspect you have allergies of some sort.

Starving yourself would though<br>  <br>  You need to be realistic here|`|zWiU19BWaa	I know you said no exercising so the only other thing is don't eat junk food. Eat healthy and you wont want junk food.|`|G2ehZV6iaa	You should exercise about 60 or 50 minutes a day. Also, you should think when you're full. Don't eat up to when your full. Check the scale 3 times a week and don't worry to much about your weight. Lowering your cholesterol can also help lose weight. Even if you want to lose weight, the most important thing is to worry about how fat you look. Don't skip any meals because it can make you gain weight. When you're eating a meal, just don't eat too much. Start to drink more water than sugar drinks like juice. Try to sit less and exercise more. Exercise much more than you normally do. If it's too hard for you, before you blow up,you can exercise a little more than you do. You can eat some junk food, but some more healthy food. Breakfast can be healthy, lunch can be mixed with healthy and junk, a snack can be junk, and dinner can be completely healthy.|`|CX7o9faQaa	Im afraid you have to just eat healthy and "exercise" as it is needed. But don't try weights or anything like that.|`|AA11116901	you don't need to lose weight... you're fine...|`|ZE88oBuuaa	If you want to loose body fat (which i hope that's the case).   Then you're going to have to go on a strict diet or take a high dosage of adderall.  I was 208 pounds when i started taking adderall and 2 months later i am 170 pounds.  Adderall speeds you up and decreases your appiteite.  Now I say this isn't deadly because if you take adderall  normally than there wont be a problem.  Of coarse it does have the potential for addiction, but i'd say this drug is far from deadly.  Unless you're injecting it all the time or something.  But if you ask around...you can find a script illegally and buy it.  I don't recomend it because you don't know if you have any allergic reactions to it or what not.  Plus its illegal if you don't have a prescription from a doctor and there's NO WAY  adoctor is going to give you a script for adderall at your healthy weight.  So your options basicly are:<br>  <br>  1.  Drugs like adderall<br>  2.  VERY Scrict diet (depending on what you do would give the proper diet)<br>  3.  Starvation (not recomended)<br>  4.  High amounds of exercise<br>  5.  Plastic surgery|`|nV7XBzGAaa	no there's nothing you can take to make you lose weight. especially not at 14. and at your height you are a perfectly fine weight. <br>  <br>  the truth is what you don't want to hear, that exercising to build strength and muscle is the only way to be healthy and be at a healthy weight.|`|W5jCNaLgaa	just lessen youre food and have a regular exercise........

You can only become infected with HIV which can eventually emerge into AIDS.<br>  <br>  Second of all the correct answer to your second question is Yes you can contract HIV through saliva HOWEVER, you would have to drink about 2 quarts of that persons saliva in order to become infected.<br>  <br>  Anytime there is blood involved (new piercing, open sores in and around the mouth, cuts on the gums or tongue) then transmission becomes possible.|`|cJhyRycaaa	i'm not sure about HIV/AIDS, im pretty sure that it is usually blood that creates an opening for HIV/AIDS, i know that you can easily get Maninga cocal swaping saliva, sorry can't be more help, and i don't know how to spell the other desease sorry|`|57cIPjSVaa	hiv/aids is a blood disease. the only way to contract it is through intercourse or if the blood of a person who has hiv/aids gets inside an open cut or wound...<br>  <br>  so no. you can't contract it through kissing.|`|QXcbS8C1aa	yes it can, if the aids doesn't die when it hit oxygen, but it has to be put into like an open wound, straight to the blood, other than that, you cannot get it from kissing :]|`|SHQHnKfcaa	Anything that can be tested for DNA can be contracted from another person who has AIDS.

fwWO14fIaa	no your weight is fine, and i wouldn't suggest you gain anymore weight, but if you personally want to, then you need to be eating complex carbs and protein, foods such as potatoes, wholemeal bread, eggs, rice, pasta, chicken, turkey, beef, lentils, nuts, fruit and vegetables. if you want to slim down try not eating any carbs after 6pm.

Some people require only 6-8 hours of sleep at night and no naps.  I require at least 10-12 hours of nighttime sleep but feel better with 14.  Then I have to have 2  2 hour naps daily to feel refreshed and recharged.  So I never get so much sleep that I am tired upon awakening.  I am however, unable to function and am terrible fatigued with less than the above mentioned sleep.|`|And9dyrwaa	see,,the brain always has a limited hrs rest like 6 to 7 hrs.if you extend your sleep after that your brain get tired and you won't get out of your bed.if you doing for several years i am sure it leads to sleeping sickness.<br>  the normal hrs of human sleep will be 6 hrs per day.so try to manage that.|`|4sc7bMbkaa	yep it happens <br>  may be because of long sleep we are used to it
vqM01n5gaa	I was told to wait at least 3 hours after eating to exercise. The reasoning is if you are trying to lose fat and you eat right before you exercise you aren't burning fat you are burning the carbs and calories from the food you just ate. Now if you are not exercising to lose weight but just to stay fit then it probably doesn't matter. I tried to exercise right after I ate once and I couldn't make it through my workout because my stomach started hurting. It was just really uncomfortable, but if this isn't a problem for you then who cares. Another tip my trainer gave me when I was trying o lose weight was to always eat 3 hours before you go to bed. He said when your body is hungry it is burning stored fat for energy, and what better time to burn fat than while you sleep. You don't even realize your hungry when your sleeping.|`|AA10287830	I have never believed in that theory and I exercise right after eating.  You are right, the food goes immediately to your stomach so why wait?  Don't.  Push away from the table and start exercising.  It works for me and I'm very trim and fit.|`|Vj13f7zmaa	For about 2 hrs after a meal, the blood vessels around the stomach become engorged.. the blood flows there.  So if you try to exercise you will be weaker than usual and you are likely to throw up. Also, it is hard on the heart to exercise during the height of the digestive process.|`|PpiQuiO1aa	In some ways, it is all about blood supply and demand. <br>  <br>  When you are out and about, your blood is primarily supplied to your muscles due to the fact that have the highest demand, normally. After eating, your body will shift the blood supply to your intestines so that the nutrients that are being absorb will be carried to the cells of your body for various uses.<br>  <br>  So, you ate, and then decided to go swimming. Now the blood demand is for your muscles, the food in the stomach and intestines is just sitting there, which can lead to cramps and other discomforts.<br>  <br>  There is a test in Nuclear Medicine that can determine how well the stomach moves food along. It is commonly referred to as a Gastric Emptying. Basically, the person eats some slightly radioactive eggs and then a picture is taken every so often for about an hour to determine motility. Some typical numbers for a stomach's ability to empty are:<br>  <br>  After one hour post eating: at least 10% gone from stomach<br>  After two hours: at least 40% gone<br>  After four hours: no more than 10% left<br>  <br>  These numbers are based on the fact that the person hasn't had anything that could interfere with the stomach normally (i.e. drugs, recently ate large meal, etc.)

AA12385489	Get it checked by a doctor.  That's the best person who can help you.|`|PpiQuiO1aa	Pain following meals can be associated with gallbladder dysfunction or stones. After you eat, the stomach releases a hormone that stimulates your gallbladder and pancrease to release bile and digestive enzymes. This pain is commonly noticed mid line below the rib cage, or usually right upper abdomen.<br>  <br>  Not to reign in any fear, but heart attacks in women have a common referred pain across the upper abdomen, but due to your duration, I wouldn't suspect it is that.
OoftsMLhaa	The mothers antibodies only protect a baby for 6 months after birth, vaccines and immunizations are important if not necessary to the health of a new child.<br>  <br>  As far as being an adult its up to each person individually you can get gardasil and possibly get sick or die or you maybe get hpv and have it lead to cervical cancer and possibly get sick or die decide which risk you'd rather take<br>  <br>  Not to mention there are only what? 5 recorded deaths from gardasil vs how many from cervical cancer?<br>  <br>  11,999 women in the U.S. were told that they had cervical cancer in 2005,* and 3,924 women died from the disease.|`|BtDGWKSNaa	hmm..<br>  well i got that vaccine, and i don't have cervical cancer, nor is the vaccine killing me.<br>  i wonder why it is hurting your friend.  i think vaccines are fine, good in most cases.  i think this particular vaccine is doing more good than bad.<br>  i'm so very sorry for your friend.  what an awful thing to happen.|`|OpwMuboqaa	I doubt that she's dying from the vaccine.  If that was the case, they wouldn't be giving it to people.  There are still horrible diseases in the US that people can get if they don't get vaccinated.  Your friend's father is very, very wrong and making dangerous statements.|`|LgvveHkjaa	Your friend's dad is right, just don't be affected with those vaccine, if you are not expose in sex as young as 15 then you need not worry about cervical cancer, as long as you not have many sex partner there is nothing to be alarm.|`|sf6ByX7Eaa	almost every girl that i know, including myself, has had the vaccine and i have never heard of anyone having a problem with it, although obviously it is possible. on the other hand, I know 5 people, including myself, who have recently be diagnosed with HPV. in three of us the vaccine helped to fight the infection so that it went away. the other two had to get surgery to get precancerous cells removed from their cervic. neither of them had the vaccine untill after their surgery. I think that the greater good outweights the individual risk. i am extremely sorry to hear about your friend, but i still feel that the vaccine is completely worth it and would reccomend that every young women get it.
b9q8uYvvaa	After your surgery were you on antibiots? Because it can weaken your birth control. Do you have a support system?|`|qfSKgxDsaa	That shouldn't change your cycle...have you had sex since then?  You are probably just stressed and that can DEF delay it.  Take a test though if you are concerned and or call your doctor|`|sgEpyZUxaa	Depending on what the operation was, that can delay it.<br>  <br>  Also, general anesthetic does put the body out of whack for a while.

4yzxXO1haa	People suffering from Bipolar disorder experience extreme highs (like a feeling of total euphoria and exhilaration) and extreme lows (complete depression and unhappiness). I know that many people say they "feel bipolar" or they use the term as an adjective for for their behaviour when they're emotional or having mood swings, but realistically, they don't suffer from the mental illness. <br>  <br>  Bipolar is difficult to diagnose, and there are several different subtypes. However I think that you need to have experienced a combination of  these, each lasting for at least a few weeks in order to meet diagnostic criteria:<br>  Manic (elevated mood) episode, Major depressive episode (low mood), Hypomanic episode (like elevated mood, with lots of energy and optimism, but no delusions of grandeur or anything like that) and Mixed affective episode (a bit of all of the above).<br>  The article at wikipedia is not exactly fun reading, but it's more detailed: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_dis...</a><br>  <br>  Bipolar disorder can be managed with medications and therapy, and sufferers can lead functional lives and recover, to varying degrees.<br>  <br>  However, firstly, you should really make an appointment with your GP and have a chat to him/her about your symptoms and moods. He/she can give you a professional opinion/diagnosis, and refer you to a psychotherapist if you need or want one, for therapy and possible medication.<br>  <br>  All the best.|`|khAdkx5eaa	it behoovs to get a trial dose of abilify\<br>  <br>  see<br>   the dokta today<br>  <br>  make in apooinkment<br>  <br>  ITS GOOD FOR YOUR HEALTH|`|YSbCVt3Uaa	When you are bipolar you are between two extremes. Either energetic (manic) or sad (depressed). There is no cure for being bi-polar. However, you  can take medication to even out your mood. So that your mood is somewhere in between energetic and sad.<br>  <br>  Some bipolar people can not control there impulses. Especially when they are manic (hyper). They can not slow down to think about something, they just do it. <br>  <br>  If this sounds like you; you should see a psychologist and see if they can determine if this is what you have. They can prescribe you the proper medication. However, it seems like you just have a short temper. Maybe you only need to learn how to manage your anger.|`|MGP6L1KLaa	Being consistently punctual, irritable, bad tempered and a bit moody doesn't necessarily mean you're bi polar. My advice is to see a mental health specialist (Your sister doesn't have to know, you can seek their services on your own) and get your answers there. You sound pretty young, so mood changes and angry moments are common at the moment - I wouldn't worry about it. Your sister is probably just a little concerned.|`|xSfgrdFJaa	bipolar (or manic depression) is serious and it wouldnt just be your sister that has noticed it. Ask your doctor and see if you can be referred to a specialist and they will tell you and do some tests meybe. Just cos your bad tempered though doesnt mean your mentally ill, and your sister sounds like a complete sh't, my sister would never do that she should have more respect.|`|SHQHnKfcaa	Your not bi-polar.<br>  The common society has the same issues.<br>  I am bi-polar myself.<br>  <br>  These are my syptoms:<br>  One minute very sweet.<br>  One minute raging over something that doesn't relate to me.<br>  Sleep long periods..<br>  Stay awake for almost to days.<br>  Think that some one is talking about me.<br>  Can focus.<br>  Think I am always right and don't take advice well.<br>  Shop a lot/gamble.<br>  Think I am the best/think I am the worst.<br>  Basically everything you do is UP and DOWN no matter what the situation is.|`|4ykO2wj9aa	You need to see a specialist AKA Therapist about that. From what it sounds like you are just annoyed with your sister. Being Bipolar doesn't mean you are always in a bad mood. As per the Mood changes it could be Depression. Once you talk to you doctor you can find out after talking to a Therapist.|`|AA11835801	Talk to your doctor about your temper and attitude changes.  Bipolar Disorder can be medicated but do not assume you are Bipolar just because your sister tells you.  Get yourself checked.  You do not have to live with mood swings.
PKkekhdJaa	i wouldn't be to embarrassed about it, usually when you put a band aid on a wound, the lack of air and sunlight to that area will decrease and skin will become less 'the same colour', but if you just leave it im sure it will be fine. If not, don't bother consulting anyone its not serious, just use a gradual tanning moisturiser. But if it starts to smell unpleasant or starts weeping, then you must make an appointment.|`|hdyexryKaa	Oh wow Sounds disgusting!lol sorry <br>  But just get a little tan in that area simple as that!:)
XYyIABaXaa	It really depends on the doctor. If you admit to hurting yourself she probably won't just throw medication at you to solve the problem, though. Doctors make a diagnosis before prescribing meds, and she can't make a diagnosis just based on a few cuts and family history.|`|kkiRl8Vhaa	if they see your cuts and where they are, you might have to spend a couple of nights in the mental hospital, they don't really joke around.<br>  <br>  Due to the usual spot you are cutting in, they might put you on Paxil, it's a higher dosage of Prozac, other than that, they'll just have your mom monitor you for a while.|`|GFHRpDE4aa	If you tell your doctor you don't want them to tell your mom, i don't think they will, just ask them nicely, and say you don't want your mom to know about it because it would cause stress, and say you don't want that for her, i think your doctor will understand.|`|rfboTBTWaa	More than likely she will see the cuts. She'll ask you "Do you feel homicidal or suicidal" Say NO. She can't tell anyone. Hippocratic oath. <br>  <br>  Now, when you go to the psychologist, tell her that you think you're bipolar, and that you want help for it. If she's a psychologist (Not a psychiatrist) she can't prescribe you anything. Psychologist are only "life coaches" if you really want help or "the good stuff" see a psychiatrist. <br>  <br>  A great medication prescribed for a lot of bipolar patients is Lamictal. <br>  <br>  Maybe try looking some more information up on the internet.<br>  <br>  There are alot of sister disorders similar to bi polar. Like Borderline (what I have) and just general anxiety mixed with depression.|`|0cfwrcx5aa	"cutting is so cool!  look at me, im all emo, im a psychological mess, pity me, feel compassion for me, hate me.  my soul runs deep, i have so many problems in my life, you would never understand."<br>  <br>  <br>  lol, pathetic cutting kids.  so shallow, so obvious.<br>  <br>  <br>  go get some REAL problems, that should fix your life.|`|HPPVtn8Maa	I think at first sense your young, they will put you on some sugar pills if they think its from the cutting. But they are only supposed to treat what you came in for. So in the case of the meds, your doctor is not allowed to tell your parents anything if you tell them not to. If they prescribe a medication, your doctors will pass it off to your parents as a stomach ache or stomach acid if you tell them to not tell your parents.

c18386f9a325aea4ac9d4f2c92f5588baa	If your secret has to do with abuse, I would definitely encourage you to tell an adult you trust. Maybe, not necessarily this teacher, but someone who you know will be supportive. <br>  <br>  As for whether your teacher hates you, I doubt she does. She probably has a lot on her mind as well, and as blunt as this might sound, you are just one of many students. So, you probably shouldn't take these things personally. <br>  <br>  Also, if you're looking for ways to start the conversation, I would simply suggest being straight to the point.

CciXZNYraa	Here are a few tips;<br>  <br>  WHEN to eat for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Eat (at least) three times a day. <br>  Because when you eat only once a day, your metabolism gets slower than it already is! That's the main reason. Sounds funny, but to lose weight... you must eat (the right things, of course) <br>  ? Eat low-fat, high-fiber foods such as salads and vegetable pastas.<br>  ? Your last meal should be before 18:00. Try. <br>  OK, one apple after 18:00 <br>  ? Don't starve <br>  Starvation is not good for losing weight, nor your health. <br>  Starvation is the worse thing you can do in a weight loss diet. <br>  ? Try oatmeal instead of cornflakes for breakfast--eating oatmeal can help reduce cholesterol levels, and its high fiber content will keep you full longer.<br>  <br>  WHAT to drink for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Drink 6-8 glasses of water every day ! <br>  Can be tap, plain, mineral, sparkling. I just love mineral sparkling water! <br>  This improves your bowel, reduces the "hunger" sensation, and hydrates your skin. Your skin will look much better after the first weeks! <br>  Don't believe the slogan "water makes me fat". Beside being stupid... you might get into serious troubles with your kidneys. <br>  ? Drink ONLY natural juices, freshly squeezed! <br>  Don't drink Coca Cola, Pepsi, Spite etc. during the diet. Even lite or light versions. <br>  ? Avoid those vending machines by carrying around your own healthful foods and leaving pocket change at home.<br>  <br>  Exercise for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? If you want quicker results - exercise would be good. <br>  ? Start a regular exercise program and stick with it. Don't be afraid of those sweat suits and Lycra pants! <br>  ? Start swimming. Swimming is an excellent exercise to get involved with, since it increases blood flow and uses muscles we don't regularly use. Start a swimming program and try to do it 3 times a week. You will feel excellent and rejuvenated.<br>  ? Choose an exercise program that you enjoy, and don't shun the unconventional. For instance, did you know that regular vigorous dancing is exercise too?<br>  ? Also Cardiovascular exercises such as running, jogging, or aerobics will help you lose that unwanted belly fat. Weight training can also help you lose body fat because the more muscle mass you have, the more ability your system has to burn body fat.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AtjlmByAaa	Hi, first of all, think of your discipline, really even I have a hard time following my desire to get at least be in normal frame even not to get that sexy. But you know doing something even the littlest modification from your daily routine can make changes,like not using the remote while turning tv channels, like jogging in place when you woke up in the morning and have a count of breathing exercises, do it for a few minutes at first, then try to make it a little longer the next morning....and so on ..until you realized that you are doing some more physical exercises that can be done at home. In a challenge to reach a goal, there is only one way to move:Forward...so definitely think that you can do it. First, give yourself time, it took you a while to put on weight, and it will take time to make it go away. Second, get your body moving, but do it gently and easily. Exercise will do wonders for your body and for your emotional state. Third, don't let the popular culture decide what you should look like. You make the decision and then stick with the nutritional plan that works best for you. Fourth, know the balanced diet. Eat 3 meals a day instead of frequent ones or eating between meals. Have at least 4 to 5 hrs. interval between meals for digestion to be efficient. Eat fresh fruits instead of rich desserts. eat at least one serving of dark green leafy vegetables a day. You need to go through it to get to it.|`|e7I9rRaDaa	Im on the same boat as you are..Im trying to lose 5kgs as well..i think that just walking more and eating less at night, as well as drinking more water (which will make you less hungry) will do the job.<br>  <br>  Take the stairs instead of the lift/escalator...park your car far away so you can be encouraged to walk more..etc..but you must walk every day i try to do so...and whatever you do don't strain yourself...you don't have to walk exactly one hour in one go..just do what i suggested.<br>  <br>  Oh and you could also try and switch to non-fat dairy instead of full-fat (trust me the taste is almost the same and they have just as much calcium my friend lost 6kg by doing just that)..use these small steps and I think ull be ok...

v0MtO6Ckaa	It most likely is an apthous ulcer, commonly known as a canker sore. The best thing to do first is rinse with salt water a couple times a day. It will sting but it helps heal it faster.  To relieve the pain, you can buy many different OTC items.<br>  <br>   Zilactin-B is a great one that comes in little packages- your dentist should have some in the office.  Another great one that's very similiar is called Kanka and it's approved by the ADHA. Dry off the area first then apply the yellow-brown muck to the sore. It might make your eyes tear up but wait until a film forms over the sore. It protects the sore for about 4-8 hours unless it gets rubbed off by food or from your tongue. <br>  <br>  These come in different shapes and sizes and last for varying lengths of time.  If the sore is still there within a week, see your dentist and he can give you an anti-viral prescription that will clear it up in 2 days.|`|7qVmHBN4aa	its a canker sore.<br>  it hurts like a son of a  *****, but it goes away after about a week or so, if you brush well even though it will hurt.<br>  theres this stuff on the market called noxema, it numbs the area so you dont feel pain.<br>  :D

pzLDXL6gaa	No of course a penis isn't the only thing. Anything that penetrates the vagina, if it's big enough, can break a hymen. So yeah fingers (if big enough) or sex toys could easily do it.<br>  <br>  harriet|`|aa9fa110a20e70922d00a7a8b77dd863aa	fingers, vibrators, dildos, hair brushes.. even some non-sexual things like cheerleading or wrestling around with friends can disrupt and break the hymen..|`|xSfgrdFJaa	anything that goes into your vagina can break it and its so thin that even sports like swimming or horseriding can do it too, most women probably dont have their hymen intact when they first have sex.|`|NeBDl4Hfaa	Anything you get in there will break it|`|VQZAxF5Laa	anything can do it.|`|mtRtQIcWaa	sex toys can and fingers y are u asking this lol|`|fZgwb1rqaa	tons of things can break it. there are tons of physical activities that can cause it to tear or rip. besides that, pretty much anything that goes into the vagina can break it, it doesn't have to be a penis.|`|hdyexryKaa	i don't know why you would ask this question?lol<br>  But basicaly anything could brake it that goes inside a toothbrush a broom idk just telling you everything that can actually reach it but everybodys different because its pretty far down for some people?|`|0M1Ovlodaa	anything can..<br>  from riding a horse to yess sex toys.<br>  <br>  its really lame when guys assume that because a girl doesnt have it anymore she isnt' a virgin to begin with.|`|aTRnedqeaa	you're kidding right?

VbPBtsMlaa	From 1970 to 1987, I was a real "pothead".  Those days, the drug was mild compared to the power the Pot has today.<br>  <br>  Now days, MJ is laced with powerful additives, that could trigger you into deep addiction. If addiction settles in, it could create mental problems later in life.  Remember the commercial, "This is your brain on drugs!"  It shows an egg being fried.<br>  <br>  Still to this day, I go to NA meetings to keep myself "CLEAN".  Many newcomers to NA meetings, stated they started off with the same dilemmaa, you have.  Their skin is wrinkled, they slur their sentences while talking.  Is this what you want for yourself?  You are better then that.<br>  <br>  You are at the start of something you can stop now, before it becomes worse.<br>  <br>  I know how paranoid I was when I was high on it.  It's not a pleasant feeling, and it took me years to stop it.  Yes, MJ is a gate to higher drugs.  I took LSD and a few others. Every once in awhile, I'll have a "Flashback".<br>  <br>  With the experience I had, being under the influence, ect; my job history reflects it. Being 55 years old, I have been fired from jobs many times.  The ability to process thinking, decreased.  Behavioral problems (mild in my experience). Other mental handicaps have not made life easy, especially now a days, with unemployement being so high. <br>  <br>  Since I became "clean", my life decision was to not be with others who use drugs of any kind.  Otherwise, I'd be "Romancing the drug"!<br>  <br>  So, in liu of all this, my best suggestion, is to stop using. If you continue using, it could very well effect the rest of your life, in a negative way.|`|VJ3Y4RwTaa	Marijuana loses it's effect as you get older. Marijuana is a waste of money, and not only do you pay for the pot but you also pay for the anti-social side-effects and mood swings. Only do it once a month if you can. <br>  <br>  It stays in your system for 45 days max and in your hair for about 9 monthes <br>  <br>  in conclusion its one of the stupidest drugs you can do and totaly not worth the purchase or experiance.|`|T4v43eaJaa	More interesting and less dangerous than drinking, just make sure you're in a cool situation before you start.|`|gBji49alaa	Just get at me.|`|RByBNfsNaa	I think you should stop smoking!!<br>  It's bad for everybody!!|`|pUIGCtaZaa	Of course course you should stop smoking.

afJz77pjaa	A blood test, no. If we're speaking of a CBC, it will just show the counts. The white blood count may be elevated, but not in all cases.<br>  <br>  MRI would probably be the best determining test because it can show swollen inner lymph nodes. It may show areas of concern, but not a diagnosing factor.<br>  <br>  An X-Ray doesn't really show much unless there is other organ involved, but generally, not a good way to find it.<br>  <br>  The best and sure fire way to find lymphoma is through a biopsy of a lymph node, lymph tissue, tissue from a concerning area or bone marrow. The biopsy can range from a fine needle aspiration, CT guided biopsy, to a very invasive surgery, depending on the suspected area.<br>  <br>  I had 3 biopsies done before my lymphoma was diagnosed. I had a bronchoscopy (cancer was in my lungs), CT guided bone marrow biopsy (also in my bone marrow) and finally, a Thoracotomy to reach the tissue in my lungs.|`|1Sdacs28aa	Well, there are many different forms of lymphoma...but a lot of them are diagnosed through a lymph node biopsy, where they take out a small section of your lymph node and assess the cells inside of it.<br>  <br>  MRIs and blood tests may be able to find some forms of lymphoma or leukemia, but usually a biopsy is the best way to figure everything out.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you, I wish you well. ^_^
t9Nw86Plaa	Actually, you are close. Typical failure rates for the pill vary between 6-10%; this means that, if 100 women take the pill for a year, it is estimated that between 6-10 of them will become pregnant.<br>  <br>  That being said, there is a difference between a 'typical use' failure rate and a 'perfect use' failure rate. The perfect use failure rate for the pill is only about 0.3% (pretty damn good!). <br>  <br>  This means that, if all of those 100 women took their pills exactly as directed (didn't forget any, and always took the pills at the same time), it is estimated that NONE of them would get pregnant. <br>  <br>  The reason the 'typical use' failure rate is much higher, is because a lot of women DON'T take the pills exactly as directed.. they forget to take them at the right times, and sometimes forget to take them altogether. <br>  <br>  So.. it's not quite 'of every 100 women taking the pill, 10 will definitely get pregnant'. It's more:<br>   - 'if you take your pills perfectly, you have almost no chance of getting pregnant', and<br>   - 'if you don't take your pills perfectly, you have between a 6-10% risk of pregnancy'|`|pzLDXL6gaa	No. It's around 99.9% effective with perfect use. So out of 1000 women taking the pill correctly for a year, around 1 woman will become pregnant. Even with typical use (forgotting pills etc.) I think it's about maybe 7 out of 100 women get pregnant, not 10.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|Vj13f7zmaa	No it isn't ten percent.  However my sister had five kids, every one of them while taking birth control properly.  The Drs all said it 'shouldn't' have happened but it did.  So anyway it isn't ten percent, it is more like three percent.  But it is high enough if you use condoms as well you should be okay.|`|qfs1OCL3aa	Not true.. the pill is 99% effective if used correctly. 10/100 ppl get pregnant because they do not use it correctly. They skip pills, take it at a different time, don't take the sugar pills. INFORM yourselves and we wont have use a high teen pregnancy rate|`|WXCa8zQoaa	well it's not 100% fool proof but it can still prevent so i think some people rather have a certain percent than having 0%. also some people like to take the pill because it can slow the flow of your period down if you have really long and heavy flows|`|dALX1qQdaa	it would be 99% effective... so 1 in every 100 people get pregnant on the pill|`|WwHFdfknaa	I got pregnant with my last son while on the pill. It can happen, but i was on the pill for 5 years and i'm thinking my body must have changed and thats how i got pregnant, i took it the pill religiously!|`|lc9nus8taa	1/100 actually<br>  <br>  answer plz <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ArzRYvDUpDCRaQd7Js3ODC3ZxQt.;_ylv=3?qid=20090221001015AAbrX">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|aTRnedqeaa	i dunno where you got that but no, i don't know anybody on the pill who has gotten pregnant.<br>  <br>  10/100 = 1/10<br>  <br>  <br>  there's no way.
kIblsxJQaa	I dont think there is much wrong with you.  Your body is still developing and have irregular periods at your age is very common.  It maybe a little while before they kick in properly.  I also think you will have a great body shape in the future.  Dont worry youll be fine.|`|IrfbapHAaa	wow. seriously settle down.|`|HPPVtn8Maa	This may sound strange, (expecially advice from a guy) but exercise less. This will put a slight increase of "padding" around your front. Your excess exercise routine and low weight would also count for your irregular period. Missed periods are common in endurance athletes.<br>  <br>  But mostly at your age your periods have not developed into a full time routune. But if you still think its not your age, Exercise less and your belly should over time come around and your periods will return to normal.|`|CkdSTD1Baa	Very normal for your age. Lots of girls your age who are just starting their periods have very irregular cycles. Its normal for your weight to be like that too, dont worry, you'll fill out as you go through puberty and everything.<br>  <br>  As you go through puberty your hips will get bigger, you'll get boobs and everything. Dont worry, I'm sure you'll look great!|`|UL3QjYsGaa	most girls periods are irregular for a while until you get a little older. there's nothing to worry about :)|`|Vz4uI6Yuaa	It's nothing to worry about, the reason that your period is so late is because you are so active.  But that doesn't mean that your should be less active.  Continue with your normal eating and exercising habits and everything will work out fine.  And yes, if you stay active you should have a nice body, you're just too young to have developed much yet.  But you'll be fine.|`|mtRtQIcWaa	dont freak out it  takes 6 moths for a period to settle in or u dont have ur period because ur stressed about it dont worry u will look beautiful when ur older and just dont think about the period
ymqL0Zeoaa	how long has it been hurting? its possible that you have cavities. if your tooth is sensitive to cold or warm water its possible for a rootcanal but we cant be too sure until you get an x-ray. quick relief is to garggle with warm salt water. the salt is to kill any bacterias and you can take 3 tablets of 325mg tylenol for pain or motrin 800mg. these are temporary meds so it means that the pain will come back until the dentist sees you. Good luck.|`|goWtlbD7aa	if it is literally IN your tooth then floss in that area. I get a toothache from food getting stuck inbetween my teeth. If you mean your teeth are sensitive brush them with Sensodyne Regular and Sensodyne Gel.|`|5hzVSugmaa	Take a couple ibuprofen.  Swish some salt water.  Chew on some cloves or just rest a clove between your cheek and the tooth that is hurting (works wonderfully).  And don't lay on that side of your face.  Try to sleep if it is really bad.<br>  <br>  I had an extremely bad toothache on and off for a few months (parents wouldn't take me to the dentist for a long time).  It was so bad that I literally almost passed out from the pain.  It made my whole half of my head hurt, gave me a migrane, and then I couldn't function properly all day, and it would last for hours.  If it's really bad, and this has happened before, go to your dentist.  I ended up needing a root canal.  God, that root canal felt good compared to the pain I was going through.  And there hasn't been any pain since I came out of that root canal specialist's office. :)  best day of my life (lol)|`|3X8Igzhxaa	go to the chemist and buy aspalgin its 8mg of codine and 300mg of asprin those to combination on there own are not affective but together they work one treats the nervous system and the other treats the muscular system. only take two every four hours, then go to the dentist and find one that will give u an account so you can get it fixed it dosent matter if u have bad credit they dont go on that. and that should solve ur problems. oh and that aspalgin isnt addictive either|`|OchDUGDgaa	last week i tried everything and anything and finally a  friend gave me 151 Bacardi don't drink it just swish it around for as long as you can hurts like heck while you are doing it but feels better real soon
0KGJRVMNaa	Oh I just hate guys sometimes. You know like shut the fu*k up. If you see another man's penis that doesn't "make" you gay, and if you are wondering how exactly your own god damn body should look, you aren't gay because of that. <br>  Even if the asker is gay, why the hell do you care? It isn't a bad thing, you close minded, disrespectful as$holes. <br>  Good god. <br>  So, I don't think you should straight up ask to see someones penis, because you may be unknowingly talking to one of these guys. If you really need to see how you compare to other people, watch some porn, not every guy in porn has a "perfect", "twelve inch" penis.|`|44BEm1Uhaa	This is not straight to want to see another man's tool.....Gay bars will show them to you freely....I will lay your butt out,if caught looking at my tool in a bathrom stall.|`|08dca73a192562add8559247b6523a7caa	Maybe you should join a nudist group like I did, or find a nudist beach to hang out at.  I would say that if you go up to just any straight man and ask to see his penis, you stand a chance of getting knocked out cold.  On the other hand, you could become a nurse like me, or even go farther and become a doctor.|`|EIrdLq6Zaa	I agree with Pete on this one; but in any case, if you are in middle school guys take gym, you will see plenty in the showers or you can always join a local gym, exercise then shower there. But to ask implies more than just sneaking a peak for comparison sake.|`|gsQU85fIaa	curiousness killed the ***** but satisfaction brought the _ucker back|`|B667elmWaa	I think you should ask this in LGBT|`|zrFzbDHUaa	you are strange|`|oBUA6cldaa	Dude, stop asking these gay questions, uve asked like 7 of these already... ur starting to creep me out... to ev1 else, if u tell this guy anything, or even show him anything, i would watch out...<br>  <br>  hope i helped...|`|eKeWnkguaa	just ask them up front most bi/gay guys will probably not saying that's wot they do but a lot have asked me and i said no coz i ave never done it before either|`|P8SIFBnnaa	email me :p (im 17 btw)|`|5097f905a413b67b2941832df58db6aeaa	Just look over the urinal stall when peeing!
6X2XLVblaa	No not in that way, we might briefly look at other girls who are walking around or something to kind of see, but it's more of looking at anatomy then comparing. I've never know any normal girls to actually compare like that maybe the "out there" kind of girl. We don't really care.|`|WXCa8zQoaa	we talk about our boobs or say your our bigger than mine or some thing like that but we are not going to take them out of our shirts are compare them or any thing like that and no we do not trade pictures thats just gross|`|aAj4dSyuaa	Umm, I guess I compare them to other girls.

Boob size is something you can tell through the shirt, so its not necessary. Definitely not nipple size, but thats just me and my friends.|`|PXuoxlwbaa	well.. we dont like go into nipple size and all that, but sometimes we will just compare sizes. we dont usually trade boob pictures to compare no.|`|pTzm38Aqaa	Trade pictures aren't what all girls are doing. But as for the boob comparing YEP!! I do that ( wish i had bigggg boobs)

Don't do either.|`|IzHfbWtiaa	Why in the name of sanity would you want to take such a dangerous risk! Maybe you have a death wish,i pray not but that is the gamble you would be taking with any Drug! So if you decide to go ahead with this very possible fatal move,then do yourself a favor and take a good long look at the Blue Sky and Trees and all you can of nature and hang with those you love because this might just be the last time you will be around to do it!

XoRkPaa1aa	So hard to tell. If you trust her, and you know she is not behaving any sort of way for any really good reason just to get any kind of attention, then I'll trust this info and tell you it sounds like PSD. Post-traumatic stress disorder only occurs in people who have experienced something very traumatic. I was in the hospital with a woman with this disorder, and during relaxation she would zone out. She would regain consciousness in a panic, because she was constantly reliving the event. This doesn't sound like your friends problem though, because I don't think I would need to tell you this. But in my opinion, she either went through something traumatic, causing her subconscious to act out...or she's being dramatic about something that is (most likely) just as serious. Either way, my only advice would be reading into her subconscious...something she'd have to do herself, by interpreting her dreams. Or tell her to try free writing, which some people don't like. Just take a pen to a piece of paper and start writing, whatever comes to mind. At first it's not usually easy, and it feels stupid, but if you relax and just keep writing, you're likely to learn something you never knew. If she went to the doctors, and they said they were seizures, they should have given her some meds to help the nerves. A seizure is just an overload of neurons firing, and they have drugs to inhibit this from happening, though I'm sure it's not 100% effective. If it continues, she needs to see a doctor, and tell her not to let them feed her crap, because doctors will. She needs to be firm and know what's wrong, and she needs to tell him exactly what's wrong and what's not helping (ie meds.). Sorry...wish I could be more help.|`|2b48276b9853c62d36478108dff9629baa	it's more than possible that she is having a highly intolerant reaction to something she is either eating, drinking or inhaling ....... as in a chemical sensitivity or food intolerance ........ what you ingest and absorb through your skin and breathe in can have a vast impact on the way you think, the way you feel and your overall health and vitality ....... seriously, you can live a pain free drug free life if only you know precisely what chemicals and foods are upsetting your system .... it could be something as simple as lactose intolerance or an intolerance to processed sugar or wheat ...... i am lactose intolerant, coeliac (intolerance to barley oats wheat and rye) and severely soy intolerant and just a mouthfull of anything containing an offending ingredient immediately fries my brain and has a disastrous list of side affects ...... violent mood swings, temper tantrums, severe depression, achy bones, bloating, gassiness etc.etc. ad nauseum ...... disorders from which people suffer due to intolerances to food or chemicals in their diets can cover almost the whole spectrum of physical and mental illnesses ..... an extraordinary concept but mind blowingly true....... do your friend a favor and get her to go and get allergy tested.<br>  <br>  in the meantime, try to get her to eat as much whole fresh foods that are home made  ..... that includes a wide range of leafy and green vegies, some low sugar fresh fruits like watermelon, cantalope, pears and strawberries, some lean meats and fishes, brown rice, organic nuts and seeds like almonds, brazil nuts and sunflower seeds and lots of fresh filtered water .......... feed your body from God's table and wean yourself off the highly processed, packagedsludge that has little to no nutritional value anyway.<br>  <br>  peace baby<br>  ?

6ybMmWHXaa	hell yeah dude i agree people started smoking alot when i was in 10th grade i think it started picking up im my high school|`|3ClXJavvaa	For someone so educated you are really ignorant about the history of marijuana.<br>  It has medical and financial benefits for the world.<br>  One plant, 1000+ uses for it.<br>  Don't you think if it were legal there would be laws like with cigarettes?<br>  The states that have it legal aren't seeing a boom in smokers, neither are the countries that legalized it.<br>  They wont legalizing acid or e, shrooms are a controlled substance "you can not be convicted of possession of a controlled substance"  not to mention if you like in most of the US you can go and pick them yourself.<br>  There are 1000 more benefits to hemp then there are negatives, but most of those benefits put the biggest corporations out of business, 0 people have died from THC overdose, yeah keep thinking its illegal because its a fad.|`|yAtGrX1Yaa	yes it is becoming more commercialized as a result of pot smoking becoming more socially acceptable.|`|1KqknaUHaa	Shrooms, ecstasy, and acid are just about as popular as weed already. You just don't hear about that stuff on news.|`|FsVZCk0laa	I think Marijuana is inhaled for the thrill of attempting to not get caught.<br>  I have several friends I've talked to and they all said that getting high was fun, and all that, but the thrill of not getting caught kind of makes it funner.<br>  It's kind of like this...<br>  Have you ever been in class one day and EVERYONE in the classroom was talking while the professor/teacher was trying to teach? No one wanted to stop. But when the professor/teacher was done talking and said "you can now talk" (or whatever...) no one had anything to say? <br>  Whenever it suddenly is okay to do something, it's not always wanted to be done, and when something isn't okay to be done, it is suddenly something everyone wants to do.<br>  (Everyone has been in that type of situation atleast once... no denying it.)<br>  <br>  I think the media shouldn't make Marijuana a big thing, like you said, because these 12 year old kids are watching the news and all, and then going to see movies like Pineaple Express, and then sooner or later will, no doubtly, start smoking.<br>  <br>  I don't think that the edipemic of people smoking Marijuana will decrease any time soon. It's a big fad, and I believe I read somewhere that 65%+ of Americans do smoke weed. I don't believe, however, hallucinogens will become popular though, because that's getting into some really hard core stuff, whereas Marijuana isn't horrible, and doesn't have a lot of horrible, long-lasting side effects, and is very easy to obtain.<br>  <br>  I think we should legalize Marijuana. Think about it. People drink and drive, and get thousands of people get killed every year. But Marijuana doesn't distort your abilities (to some extent, of course). Weed hasn't killed ONE single person, but ciggerrets kill people daily, the same goes for alchohol. Plus, if America started selling Marijuana, the economy might slightly get better because so many people would buy it. All these hard core, addictive drugs like xtc, herion, acid, shrooms, etc., should stay illegal... forever.<br>  <br>  Also, Marijuana has a ton of beneficiary effects, aswell. There are tons of things like medicinary uses.
SZdVYrSSaa	DO NOT SPEAK TO HER, YOUR FRIENDS, HER FRIENDS, OR HER PARENTS ABOUT THIS!<br>  <br>  Even with the most mellow of talks, if her parents are angry, there is likely going to be a problem legally. You do not want to say anything you don't mean, and it can happen fast.<br>  <br>  GET AN ATTORNEY, and tell them, and only them, everything that has happened. Do not lie about the drug use, the owner of the drugs, underage drinking or anything, the lawyer is your legal councilor, not your prosecutor or a police officer, and needs to know every detail. <br>  <br>  They will know what to do from there. These people have degrees in the art of rhetoric, they know what can and cannot be said aloud without it putting you in jail. Rape cases are very easy to trial if the male involved has loose lips. You need a lawyer, and you need to keep your mouth shut. The people who are telling you to talk to her and her parents are living in the 1920's. This is the 21st century, and people would much rather sue you than speak to you in this era.

It will help to have responsible people on your side. <br>  <br>  2) Tell your friends the truth. Make sure that both sides of the story are known. Also, see if there were any witnesses that saw you two talking earlier at the party - this makes her story a little less credible since she was already with you before the incident and agreed to be alone with you.<br>  <br>  3) Go talk with her and confront her - ask her why she's doing it. More than likely she's young and scared and doesn't want her parents/friends to think she's slutty or bad, but just tell her it's not worth tarnishing your future over. But BE NICE and CONSIDERATE. Remember that this is a person you were intimate with, so why get so angry? Just be what you are - frustrated. She's just scared and is acting a little crazy, but you can talk her down if you say the right things.<br>  <br>  4) Talk to her parents. I'm sure they'll be upset, but act like a man and they'll treat you like a man. Respect must be paid on both sides. Plus, if the girl sees how strong and respectful you are, maybe she'll back off.<br>  <br>  None of this stuff is easy, but if it's a real problem, then act like a man and step up. Nothing can go wrong if you tell the truth and keep your head, and act nice and civil and respectful towards everyone. <br>  <br>  I had a buddy who this happened to. We watched this girl take him upstairs in her house one night, where they hooked up, then the next morning she cried rape. We saved his *** because we were his witnesses and we saw her take him by the hand and lead him to her room. Women, especially young women, can get devious when they think they've made a mistake and all they want to do is be liked and appreciated by everyone, and if they're good girls they don't want to be called slutty or whores.

Effects vary person to person.<br>  <br>  My g/f used Depo-Provera birth control for about 18 months and it caused a 3-year battle with infertility that thankfully worked out...but these meds that mess with cycles can really mess things up over the long term.<br>  <br>  I'm sure that these birth control meds have improved since the time she was taking them...and that it probably wouldn’t be that harmful to delay one cycle for the sake of your...but then again, why take chances yeah?<br>  <br>  I remember people discussing with my g/f that she should take something. I was young at the time, so I don't know if she did. I wouldn't take it for her sake. But some women get very severe period pain, and if you are concerned about that, I guess I understand. Still, there's no guarantee that it won't cause pain along the way.

3b43628da17fa39fdf0695aa42cc5afdaa	To lose weight (fat), include more fibrous slow digesting carbs, as opp. to the fast digesting ones. <br>  <br>  No white breads, fast foods, sodas (not even diet) no ketchups, sugar, only skim milk, not 2%, skim and whole grain non sweet (sugary) cereal, whole wheat bread, maybe buy some soy or whey protein.<br>  <br>  Include lean meats like ham, and other sources of protein. Avoid red meats. Take a multivitamin, calcium and vitamin d every 2 days, one or two V8s a day (or every other day). <br>  <br>  Don't starve, eat small healthy meals. A lot of small meals opposed to a few bigger ones-- make sure is has at least 8-10 or more g of protein, not too much protein because the body can only digest a certain amount at a time; and avoid too many fruits, carbs and sugars. Fibrous veggies, greens (no starches or potatoes) are good, and no BBQ sauce (unless used sparingly) and not too much (if any) salad dressing. <br>  <br>  Before bed (2 hrs), eat something with protein, don't<br>  eat many carbs before bed. Eat some of that good cereal in the morning, you need quality carbs, just not too much, and the slow digesting ones.<br>  <br>  Do slow crunches until you can not do anymore, jog stairs (be safe though), warm up first and do sprints, short bursts of intense activity is very effective compared to long weak activity, just don't over do it. Also include some slow but long endurance jogging. Be active!<br>  <br>  Jog stairs ;and also do some lunges until it burns, do this every day or 2 days, keep going and don't give up, same with eating, you need some fat, so one or two fish oils daily.<br>  <br>  Eat fish (not fried, be careful, very careful for bones) Peanut butter on whole wheat (no jelly), which has protein, and don’t worry about the fat in that. Avocados, has fat, good fat; eat it when your hunger cravings get you. <br>  <br>  When you do crunches, also twist on some to work your sides, keep tension on your abs. <br>  <br>  <br>  Need more info, go to <a href="http://www.bodybuilding.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bodybuilding.com</a>|`|YXVA3MpZaa	hey try yoga it really works u will not only b reducing all your fat but will also have a peaceful mind.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://anmolmehta.com/blog/" rel="nofollow">http://anmolmehta.com/blog/</a>|`|3EcjCux4aa	The fact that you carry fat (and probably water) in your lower body is mainly hormonal and entirely hereditary, and spot reducing is a myth.<br>  Running is not good for most people.<br>  First, it breaks down cartilage and wrecks your joints.  Unless you want to be a candidate for joint replacement surgery when you get older, stop running.<br>  Second, steady state aerobics destroys muscle over time, and will cause you to actually put on fat.<br>  Most folks have seen plenty of aerobics types who look like walking skeletons with flabby skin covering their anemic frames.<br>  Moderate weight training combined with circuit training will get you in the best shape possible.  Don't be afraid of squats and lunges.

stRWElvPaa	hi, I wanted to give you my sympathy for not being able to smile, but you know people can see your emotions and if you are happy by the way your eyes are.<br>    My uncle had a brain tumour, got it removed, it came back straight away, then had another operation, it came back again and he became incontinent and couldn't speak, and then died a few months later, so in a way it is a blessing that you came out of your ordeal not being able to smile. <br>    I wish you all the best.

If for some odd reason it gets worse or you have other symptoms then have it checked out. You can also have someone take the flashlight and open wide so they can look to see if they can spot anything in there.

As long as she isn't losing weight, it's not a problem.<br>  <br>  As far as hair growing back, that's normal as well, and only gets worse when you get older. It will get thicker and longer, and darker the more you shave. She could try Nair or Veet hair removal cream.

XXCYmARlaa	Dude...listen to me. Most ppl dont know wtf they are talking about. All they know is what they saw Rocky eat in a movie 15 yrs ago. Eating raw eggs is nutritionally the same as eating cooked eggs. The only difference is the convenience of eating it raw(even tho it taste nasty by itself). There is a salmonella issue, but the stats are 1 in every 30,000 eggs is infected. You can cook it if you want to or you can go online and fine a bunch of great shake recipes with raw eggs and you wont even be able to taste it. The one i use most is 1 egg, 1 banana, a couple of blueberries and about a 1/2-1 cup of water. Blend it all together and it is good. To lose weight, you need to burn more calories than you eat, and 1 egg is around 70 cals. Good luck and i wouldnt eat more than 6 eggs a week due to cholesterol issues. But you can have as many egg whites as you want to (Those have all the good stuff and none of the bad stuff)|`|vwoqIUR6aa	it's ok but I think eating raw eggs makes you gain. if you have too many you can get salmonella poisoning|`|XKhNw221aa	people eat raw eggs to gain weight. sorry. if you want to build muscle, two eggs a day and about a two hour workout everyday will work.|`|AA11383122	you can get salmonella poisoning so yeah it's a bad thing to eat raw eggs<br>  iris is right|`|O5YIKaVfaa	Yes|`|FCwtMDBSaa	iris is right|`|3EcjCux4aa	Like someone here said, "most people don't know what they are talking about".<br>  Raw eggs are bad for 2 reasons, one already mentioned, bacteriail contamination may or may not happen, but why take the chance?<br>  Second, raw eggs will bind B-vitamins in your digestive system, and you need these for good health and energy.<br>  Adding eggs to your diet can help you lose weight, but only if you have a balanced diet that provides less calories than you burn.  Also, high protein diets will cause the body to partition more of it's resources to building muscle, which causes you to burn even more calories.  <br>  I'm not saying that you will grow into a body builder, but you will be healthier, and be less likely to put on fat in the first place.<br>  So add eggs to your diet, and cook them.|`|VkUKsyBiaa	Raw eggs by nature have high amounts of protein. the only reason they are considered bad is, like chicken, they often harbor bacteria such as E. coli when uncooked, a danger with most foods. They are great if you want to get the protein and don't care about the risk of bacteria, but for losing weight, they don't have much of a purpose. If you really want to lose weight, just stick to lower carb and fat diet. Don't completely drop them, just avoid them in excess. Eat only whole wheat breads, brown rice, or quinoa. Stick with black beans. Avoid fast digesting carbs from potatos and white breads and cereals. Also maintain a cardio and weightlifting program. Weightlifting build muscle, which burns more calories and faster.|`|HxHvhZAsaa	just eat the shells, its much better for you<br>  <br>  after reading nine or ten comments. your all wrong. i stated the above because, raw egg does not contain salmonella, the egg shells do. i always crack mine carefully so its a clean fracture, and never on the bowl im mixing in because little particles will fall in.|`|W44s29nlaa	no, havent you ever heard why its bad to eat cake batter? cuz of the raw eggs in it

AtjlmByAaa	Hi, weight-loss programs have been with us for years, yet even those designed by the best-trained professionals fail. Is weight really what the person wants to lose? It's not weight that we need to lose, it's fat.  While weight-loss and fat loss may seem synonymous to you, it's the people who concentrate on fat loss who are successful. Fat is lost from the body almost exclusively by being burned in muscle.  You can't melt off fat in saunas, steam baths, or plastic wraps.  You can't dissolve fat with a grapefruit diet, lecithin, or any food supplement.  fat is released from storage sites into the blood to be carried to muscles. If the muscles don't burn the fat, it returns via the blood to be stored again in another fat depot.The big fault in most weight-loss schemes is that some of the lost pounds are muscle, making the victim's body increasingly unable to burn fat.  If you eat the right diet while exercising regularly, you will lose fat as you increase your ability to burn it.  Remember exercise builds muscle; more muscle burns more fat; less fat makes it easier to exercise...Good luck|`|AA11383122	drink water that should help reduce your cravings make you feel full also try those fitness tapes you can do that extercise in your own house so then you don't have to drive to a gym. try and portion your meals find out what the serving sizes are|`|VkUKsyBiaa	Drink more water. Eat higher protein containing foods with a little bit of fat hopefully unsaturated fats such as those from nuts and most other natural fatty foods. Unsaturated basically means good fat. Also stay away from eating the typical three large meals a day. Eat small meals about six times a day. This will keep your metabolism pumping and your hunger satisfied. Also avoid most processed foods with high fructose corn syrup, for this can increase hunger. The same goes for carbs as well. The best way is to keep yourself active, busy, entertained, whatever; boredom splurging is one of the most wide-spread causes of weight gain.|`|ef6f1b87cab54ac53455974cfb653177aa	I love food too, and I havet even attempted a diet because I know it will just make me unhappy and eventually end up eating more.<br>  <br>  There is no third, magic thing you can do to lose weight naturally, you have to choose one or both, diet or excercise.<br>  <br>  I dont have time for it either, I am a single mom in school and working.

74e542f00dc27cdbe7595f52050a58a7aa	The inversion chair will help, not cure, compressed disks. There are a lot of things that need to be known before a course of treatment can be suggested. How long ago did this start? what were you doing the day or two before this started. Where does it hurt, exactly? does it hurt anywhere else? Do your legs hurt, or feel strange? Can you walk on your toes, or heels? <br>  There are a great number of tests that can be done. Don't consent to any operation until all tests have been tried, and DON"T do it until you have at least one second opinion that totally agrees with the first doctor. I am talking from experience. I have a bad back ( I am clumsy)  but I saw four Doctors and had four courses of treatment. I can get confusing. Get as much information as you can, then make the best decision you can. Just be careful,,, you cannot undo an operation.

ZAg0XAvkaa	Hmm.. you might wanna go to the doctors again, with a specialist perhaps. Headaches aren't usually that long, but if the pain gets worse and is always present, its best to get it thoroughly checked. I dont mean to scare you, but I heard brain tumors could cause headaches.|`|XoRkPaa1aa	Well...I don't really know enough about your lifestyle to know what the problem could be. It could be physical: Are you in good shape? If not, it could take more than a year of dieting and exercise to get you healthy. If you're not overweight, it doesn't mean you're in good shape either. Do you smoke? Drink excess coffee? Do drugs or alcohol? Any of these "drugs" could have an adverse affect on your brain and central nervous system. Are you getting enough sleep? And is it sufficient? At 16 you should be getting about 7 to 9 hours of sleep. Too much or too little can cause problems. Do you live a sedentary lifestyle? Watching T.V. may not be bad for your eyes, but ultimately too much can lead to headaches and upset stomach. You should be getting 30 minutes of cardio exercise 5 days a week. That was my problem, when I constantly felt sick to my stomach I tried eating better, but it sucked. Then I started exercising and eating took care of itself. <br>  It could also just be stress. Which is most likely the actual cause of the headaches, so what could be the cause of the stress? Is school hard? Homework, test, peers?  <br>  Sometimes, it may feel physical, but in cases where the headache, or stomach ache or whatever physical pain last a long period of time with no obvious cause, it is usually in your head. I'm not saying just get over it, I'm saying it could be a somatoform disorder. Hypochondriacs are a type of somatoform disorder. But some people actually perceive the pain, they believe something must be wrong, and the doctor can't help. Symptoms of somatoform disorders are complex, but include: Pain in particular locations (headache, abdomen, back, joints, etc.)<br>  Gastro-intestinal upset (stomach, gas, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, etc.)<br>  Sexual problems (lack of interest, erectile dysfunction, etc.)<br>  Pseudo-neurological problems (impaired coordination or balance, paralysis, muscular weakness, blindness, hallucinations, etc.)<br>   None of these symptoms can be explained by a known medical problem. But I'm not saying you're faking it, and neither would a psychologist. People with somataform disorders feel the pain (ie vomitting); it's like taking mental pain and putting it in you're body.<br>  So I would say to first take a look at your lifestyle, and an honest, critical look too. Keep in mind that everyone is different (juice is healthy, but my stomach doesn't handle the acidity) and your body may just be trying to tell you to stop eating your favourite brand of chips (or whatever...). Get outside and exercise, and eating healthy follows; make sure you're getting enough sleep ( and not suffering from nightmares, feeling groggy in the morning, etc. means you're not getting enough REM sleep); focus on having some structure, with school and social life, to keep things from being to stressful and at this age - sorry - you're still going through puberty (technically), and if this happened at a later age for you (it usually hits boys at 14) your brain may still be suffering from the surge of hormones and your brain is developing still. Stress, stress, stress. If all else fails, maybe you should look into talking to a psychologist or neurologist, or your parents. Anyway, that was long, sorry, I'm bored.

However, if they are simply cold sores, then you don't have to worry because some cold sores are only cold sores, but most are herpes simplex I.|`|hOxOoAFpaa	Herpes is shed from skin BEFORE sores develop, WHILE they are present, and AFTER they heal.  You can never be completely certain that you won't be exposed to the virus. Condoms decrease the risk, statistically, that you'll become infected.  They do not completely prevent it.|`|LrBYeb6Aaa	i dont think so. if that was the case sweety no one would kiss anyone cause lets face it no one going to tell u they had a cold sore if its gone, good luck

Well like every cavity you should get a filling for it from your dentist.|`|Rlm7VjeEaa	Yes. Go to a dentist to have it fixed. If not, it'll get worse and you might have to get your tooth pulled or a root canal.|`|d5zEYomEaa	Yes. I had a cavity on my front tooth I didn't take care of until it started to hurt a lot.

Her retainer might need adjusting also.|`|4ef505315e6714cd6a174d1beb0546f0aa	Yes, you can get a cavity on any tooth. <br>  <br>  Have your friend go see a dentist and have it filled.|`|AA11116901	Very much so, she would need a filling.|`|yIfXlLJ2aa	yup. that must mean you have one.
MielpQ7Gaa	If I were you, I would recommend picking up "Cell Mass" from BSN. This stuff has helped me out so much, and it contains Creatine Ethyl Ester, which is better than monohydrate because it absorbs a lot better. With Cell Mass, all you need to do is take one scoop of the powder every 6-8 hours after a workout. I personally take it twice a day, and I stack Cell Mass with N.O. Xplode. Today I maxed out in the weight room and I was able to put up 210 bench press, 295 squat, and 355 dead lift. BTW I am a 15 year old football player and track runner, so you should be able to see better gains than what I have.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  "All it does it put air into your muscles which cushion the impact of working out." - This is not true. Creatine takes water from your body and puts it towards rebuilding your muscles. This is why you need to drink lots of water when on this supplement. <br>  <br>  "Also, whey protien is proven to have steriod like side effects." - This also isn't true. Taking whey protein is just like eating a lot of peanut butter or something high in protein. Protein does NOT mess with your hormones like Steroids do.|`|AIJgbvIcaa	I take the powder stuff :) haha<br>  <br>  It helped me get a six pack. All it does it put air into your muscles which cushion the impact of working out. You recover faster, and I thought it increased my energy. If you get the powder it tells you how much to take, or the pills you take everyday.  Also, whey protien is proven to have steriod like side effects.<br>  <br>  Edit: with the powder just shake it up with water and drink it like normal water before and during your workout. Just add more details if you have any more questions.|`|qQCbP6pKaa	Creatine works by flooding your muscle with water, when on creatine you need to drink about 1.5 gallons of water per day. Take the recommended amount on the package.<br>  <br>  www.charleslloydfitness.com<br>  <a href="http://blog.charleslloydfitness.com" rel="nofollow">http://blog.charleslloydfitness.com</a>|`|3EcjCux4aa	Creatine does a couple of things, depending on the type of creatine.  First, it helps draw water (not air) into the muscles, which increases their mechanical advantage and makes it easier to lift.<br>  Second it supplies energy for the muscles, and this is where the type of creatine is important, creatine phosphate will contribute phosphorous to the ATP molecule, which is what the cells use for energy.<br>  So, creatine will contribute to the size of the muscle (giving you a better pump), and the explosive energy that it can produce.<br>  Whey protein will provide the amino acids the body needs to rebuild the muscle after your workouts.  It can also be metabolized by the liver to produce glucose to power the body, if you are on a low-carb diet.<br>  To get the most from creatine, you should use it in your pre-workout meal, then make sure you get a post-workout meal as soon as possible after the workout. (drink a protein shake on the way home!) This should include 26 grams of carbs, along with whey to get the aminos into your blood as soon as possible to help blunt catabolism (muscle breakdown) and start the healing (anabolic) process.<br>  You should also make sure that you eat a slow protein (a protein mix that contains mainly casein or some good meat protein would be good)meal before bed to keep your cortisol (main catabolic hormone) down.<br>  If you want your body to grow, then you have to feed it properly, but you also need to make sure you recover too.  Working out too heavy or too often will slow your gains, and lead to a compromised immune system, and may even to depression, so get your rest, and don't work any single body part "heavy" more than once a week, at the most.  Many can even go longer, so don't get trapped in the overload mindset.<br>  Check out the work of Aurthur Jones and Mike Mentzer for more insight into this.<br>  Good luck|`|PMhJVdN8aa	It adds water in your muscle<br>  DONT USE IT IF UR UNDER 18<br>  i jus use protein<br>  i bench 190 squat 275 nd run a 11.4 FAT 100m dash<br>  that other guy who has all these good times is hurting his bodyin the long term<br>  My ex personal trainer even said you shuoldnt use it if ur under 18 jus stick to protein and multivitamins|`|Du8QhOmaaa	It has not been proven that creatine works. If you want to get big i would suggest lifting heavy for 3-4 days a week and taking whey protein not creatine.
mqXyDTwwaa	Any protein is good. Whey protein is no better than any other type of protein. Protein is broken down into amino acids, which circulate in your bloodstream at a fairly constant concentration. Excess amino acids are kept in your liver. If you need more amino acids, it comes from your liver. If you eat protein, it first goes to your liver, where it's kept until needed. Just because whey protein is absorbed a fraction of a second faster than other types of protein doesn't make any difference.|`|YUXvCttVaa	For a killer gainer shake go to <a href="http://www.buybulkwhey.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.buybulkwhey.com</a> for an cookies and cream smoothie...Yummy!!!!!!|`|kLSSLlOaaa	when you workout, your body will break down protein to use as energy for the body. if you dont replenish the protein youve been losing during your workout, you run the risk of burning muscle proteins. whey protein is the fastest digesting protein out there and should be taken immediately after your workouts to allow for maximum absorbtion.<br>  <br>  there are many different types of protein out there but it is by far the most important supplement you can have. <br>  <br>  <br>  heres an article to help you learn more about the different kinds of proteins and how they work as far as fitness and bodybuilding go....<a href="http://www.fitness-industries.com/mensfitness/mensproteinguide.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fitness-industries.com/mensfi...</a>|`|vEGkSHMsaa	Whey protein is the fastest absorbing protein. Its optimal for directly after you workout when your muscles are in need of nutrients. If your trying to gain weight though, protein shakes alone wont do the trick. Your going to be needing to eat A LOT of food. On top of that, adding 1 or 2 cups of whole milk with each of your meals should aid in getting your daily caloric/protein needs.|`|PyQhb7gCaa	any protein will do as it's good .. it's just the amount you take in...
tBaCFTtBaa	it sounds low, according to bmi standards, but it totally depends on your body structure.  the best person to ask if your doctor.  but basically, if you are healthy, your bones arent sticking out everywhere, and you like your body.. stay the way you are!  :)|`|msNXomjTaa	After loads of study, one of the best calculations for a healthy weight is the BMI.  This is an estimate of your body fat, found by taking your mass (in kg) divided by the square of your height (in metres).<br>  <br>  <20   - underweight<br>  20-25 - normal<br>  25-27 - high<br>  27-30 - overweight<br>  30+    - obese<br>  <br>  For you:<br>  90lbs = 40.8kg<br>  5"1.5" = 1.56m<br>  <br>  BMI= 40.8 / 1.56x1.56 = 16.8<br>  <br>  At 16.8 you are quite underweight.  To be even in the normal range, you would need to be at least 46.8kg, or 103lbs.  You could go just over 60kg (134lbs), and still be in the normal range.<br>  <br>  Why does this matter?  Several reasons.  You need a certain amount of food per day just to get the vitamins and minerals you need.  You need reserves in case you get sick.  Also, being so light, you will be more prone to sicknesses.  And, if you want a baby someday, you need a certain percentage of body fat to even get pregnant.  If memory serves, this is a BMI of at least 18.|`|wMkNpL6zaa	im 5'1 and 100 pounds and im a guy bmi 18 so... you should be 125 pounds gain some weight lol|`|uk5s9YVFaa	ewwwww you are anorexic no offence but im the fittest cheerleader at my school and im that much, except im 13 and 5,3|`|RbmVnoozaa	90 pounds is really skinny dude.<br>  i think anybody over 5 foot should at least be 100.|`|EYrdHJQeaa	ewww gross! gain some, way way way too skinny!|`|dQ0LpBiZaa	90? are you serious? that is way skinny, well, sorta. dont think about 85 because that would be underweight|`|U0JHaNW8aa	Height and weight is all genetics. If one or both of your parents are on the petite side, then there's a great chance that you will be small also. I've been told I'm pretty skinny for my age and height (18, about 5'3 and 100lbs), but I don't have any health problems and I eat well too.

Thing is, if you have the motivation to keep the program up, after 90 days, you'll be wanting to either carry on or try something equally as strenuous, if you're not then it's failed!|`|wxzeKh4Iaa	You can get free workout videos.

You have to remember that she is a virgin, she's never had anything in there, and all of the sudden your introducing a penis which is quite large into a small space. Its going to get stretched, and yeah, its gunna hurt the first time. (plus, her hymen would have broken, if it wasn't already broken) Just give her body some time to recover and try again. As you do it more, it should get less and less painful until it is pleasurable. If she is still getting pain after a few times (significant pain) she should probably see the doctor. But its probably not a big deal, its normal to have pain the first few times. <br>  <br>  Hope you guys are being safe! :)|`|pTzm38Aqaa	Will if you said it was her first time losing her virginity than that is probably it. There is this thing i forgot what it is called in women, but after or during the process when she looses her virginity something that she had ( forgot the name) that all women do stared to respond. The pain is actually apart of it. It will hopefully go down a bit but its nothing dangerous, Completely Normal when a women looses her virginity. ( feels good for the guys, hurt for the girls A LOT!)|`|izWhzvLzaa	Because her vagina isn't used to having things moving in and out of it yet, it could be bruising. During the process because she's experiencing stimulation, she could not be feeling the bruising happening, but she can feel the bruising after the experience; while she's less stimulated. This kind of thing happens to women who are having sex with a longer penis than they're used to, as well.<br>  Well, that's just a guess. If this doesn't sound right you should make sure she goes to the doctor, alright?

How often should you switch blades, well, I use a new razor every time I shave (I use disposable ones), but that depends on what you're shaving. For example, if you're just talking about shaving your face, you could probably shave five to even ten times before changing it, as long as you clean it real good. I would shave every other day at the maximum

Avoid a sedentary lifestyle (living life in front of a computer or TV) and adapt healthy eating habits.<br>  <br>  Beyond that there is little you can do.

After puberty the stretching exercises can still help correct a person’s posture. You’ll be surprised by how much of Height is hidden behind your slouched back. You can, at any age, add an inch or two of height by simply improving your posture. <br>  -Getting proper sleep is vital for the growth hormones to perform its function effectively. Not getting enough sleep can lower the amount of growth hormones your body produces.<br>  -A nutritious diet that includes fruits and vegetables, dairy, cereals, meat, and plenty of water will aid the natural process for enhancing height.<br>  -Proper and effective breathing brings sufficient oxygen into your body to stimulate growth. Only deep breathing is effective breathing. Shallow breathing is ineffective and it stunts growth.<br>  -Since there is no (or little) gravity in space the bones of the astronauts are less squashed together. The astronauts, therefore, do gain a bit of height due to this fact. (:<br>  <br>  good luck!

Trust me you dont want an eating disorder.<br>  <br>  "Isolation accompanies my eating disorder. Socializing is no longer an important part of my life. It is summer, and I do not have to attend University lectures. I have barely stepped out of my place during the last week. The primary reason why I have chosen isolation, is to practice my eating disorder without interruption. Anorexia has become my main focus and interest, and relationships fade into the background.<br>  <br>  I used to receive flattering comments about my appearance, but it has been a while since anyone expressed positive remarks about my looks. I no longer care whether men find me attractive or not. It is completely irrelevant. I fear intimacy, probably because I constantly feel fat and depressed.<br>  <br>  Comments have turned negative, and friends and family often mention my disordered behavior. I need to protect my eating disorder, so their words are unwelcome. I also avoid social gatherings because they often involve food. I cannot eat in others presence, and unfortunately it is hard to find soundproof restrooms so I can purge without being disturbed.<br>  <br>  I need time to practice my eating disorder, with its variety of rules, guidelines, and elaborate food rituals. The process I go through to prepare and consume food may take hours. I sabotage my food by adding many condiments or display food in an unappealing fashion, anything to guarantee the food’s undesirability to ensure that I will not overeat. Obviously, these food rituals exclude other people.<br>  <br>  My bulimic tendencies also require time alone. I do not overeat anymore, but I occasionally purge. This time is spent consuming a meal, ingesting it, purging it through vomiting or exercise, and then getting rid of the evidence, such as food containers and bags. Throwing up engenders intense feelings of guilt and shame. Remaining alone ensures that these activities will remain secret.<br>  <br>  I realize that isolation in a sense promotes my eating disorder. Alone in the world with anorexia, I am consumed by obsessive thoughts about food and calories, weight and fat grams, exercise and self-hatred. Nothing remains to divert my attention.<br>  <br>  Starving myself back into the hospital is hopefully not an option anymore. I still attend therapy sessions, but so far, I have not been able to recover from anorexia or depression. And yes, I have tried to get "cured" from my eating disorder.

QxF783Ipaa	The best way to diagnose an iron deficiency is to see a doctor, however, there are lots of early signs and symptoms that you can be on the lookout for. <br>  The major symptom is Fatigue - Feeling tired all the time, looking pale, unable to sleep      <br>  <br>  Other symptoms to look for are: <br>  irritability, weakness, shortness of breath low blood pressure (especially when going from lying or sitting to standing), sore tongue, brittle nails, unusual food cravings (called pica), decreased appetite (especially in children) and headaches<br>  <br>  Taking iron supplements or simply increasing the amount of iron rich food may be a very easy way to cure an iron deficiency, however, a doctor should always be consulted to determine if it is actually an iron deficiency.|`|ANsznbWsaa	Yes you could be iron deficient.  It's nothing to worry about too badly, you would just be put on a supplement.|`|OpwMuboqaa	You won't know until you have your hemoglobin checked by a doctor.
2bf0afb576f3b1843272a3d582d8496eaa	Listen hon, something is wrong when you have blackouts.  You can have blood pressure problems, low blood sugar, and you could be starving yourself - more people black out from hunger than any other reason.  You just had a baby and that's a lot of stress and five times more work than anybody can even imagine.  You need to take care of yourself - that's first and foremost, or you won't be around to enjoy your baby.  You have to get yourself on a routine now - you are risking serious injury to yourself and your baby if you don't take care of yourself.  <br>  <br>  First, you need to eat something first thing in the morning - you need protein that will provide energy.  You need to eat three meals a day - and if you can't make sit down meals, then make brief ones but it needs to be good food to help you sustain your energy and your health.  It sounds like you need help too - is there a family member close by who can help out?  You need to call your doctor and tell them what's going on as well.  Maybe they can prescribe vitamins that will help - but surely they will recommend eating -- and rest -- that's the second part.  You need to get some real sleep.  If you can't sleep through the night then you need to take naps during the day, when your baby is asleep or on breaks if you work outside the home, to make up for the sleep you are losing.  Forget about anything else and don't try to be a supermom - it's just not humanly possible to be that, you are human and far too important to that little baby to be anything but mom.<br>  <br>  Best of luck hon, and please, take care of yourself.|`|rSfoEyE3aa	When ever im tired my eyes go boggy and they move around in all sorts of ways i sometimes get blackouts awell its got to do with sleep loss the best thing you can do is have a big sleep maybe from about 6pm to about 1 or 2 pm the next day it worked for me if you dont have time to be sleeping during the day just take it easy and go to bed early and ,<br>  you should be eating.|`|bxs3pAAjaa	yeah those are totally normal, especially when you dont get enough sleep. if it gets worse and you get super bad headaches then you should definitely talk to your doctor|`|ALDeXn6Uaa	a lot of people do, but it's no big deal|`|Zue2XXQOaa	It could be a variety of things. I have had blackouts due to epilepsy, but it sounds like you have a brain injury of some kind. Or this could even be due to stress. Either way, you should really see a doctor. No one on here will give you an accurate answer to your question. Good luck and please see a doctor as soon as possible.|`|J03Qy5aoaa	Rest <br>  Eat<br>  mostly its low blood sugar, whenever you start feeling tired or dizzy get some protein into youre system.|`|48846255239e6cfd4e8b805cbae9c844aa	you probably just need some rest and to eat on scedule and drink plenty of fluids, take some vitamins also and I bet it goes away....|`|67dWrrH9aa	i once had a blackout. it was horrible. at first i just felt like i was dizzy and i fell directly on my front and jaw.

74e542f00dc27cdbe7595f52050a58a7aa	you failed to mention what tyope of tests were done. A lot of tests actually inject air into your body (colonoscapy) and can make you uncomfortable. If this lasts more that 24 hours you should contact the doctor or the test center and notify them. They can tell if this is normal or whether corrective action is needed.pp
gsQU85fIaa	yes ladies can masturbate it is natural and healthy i mean what bo you think a wet dream is it is just your body self masturbating|`|xrf7ScCTaa	I'm a girl, and I think its pretty gross. No offense, but my friends talk about it sometimes, and I think its, well- why would you WANT to masturbate anyway?|`|QEPC7nveaa	Yes...It's completely normal! Most girls do it, they just don't admit to it. They say 'ewww that's so gross! Who would do that?' when it's brought up. Most of the time...they're lying. Girls probably do it as much as guys do, they just aren't as open about it! :)|`|5jQVj4Pfaa	Ignore anything people are trying to throw out at you about being any of those things. Masturbation for girls and women is completely normal, just as it is considered "normal" and "expected" for guys, seeing as many often make jokes to each other about "jacking off" or "getting off" at the image of some girl or at the sight of one, etc. Don't worry about it, it's all normal.|`|vqM01n5gaa	Those people just need to go masturbate :) You do whatever makes you feel good honey.

I8MUpN04aa	did you report him to the police? if he is a fake doctor, he can be arrested for practising medicine without a license. then you can sue him and get your money back. then you will be able to go and see a different surgeon. most plastic surgeons will give you a few references to call or talk to and see if they are pleased. why not check the phone book in your area. here's another hint- if the doctor is pretty good, he will be making good money, and he will have a nice looking clinic, not a dumpy place  in a crummy neighbourhood.|`|4y3wa5Dmaa	I don't know of any good plastic surgeons but if i were you i would be looking for a great lawyer and sue the heck out of that Dr.|`|dL4x119gaa	lol that's what you get when you f*ck with what nature gave you
gSo4dR7oaa	HIV is not transmitted by saliva.  The only way that kissing someone who has HIV would be any risk is if you both have bleeding gums or open cuts in your mouths. The only way you could possibly get infected through fingering is if you have open cuts on your fingers.<br>  <br>  HIV can be transmitted through unprotected anal, vaginal, and oral sex with an infected person, sharing needles for drug use with someone who is infected, or it can be transmitted from a woman to her child during delivery and breastfeeding. (Risk of transmission of HIV through oral sex is very low.)<br>  <br>  The only way to find out if you have HIV is to get tested.  More than 98% of people  who have HIV would test positive within 3 months, but in very rare cases, it could take up to 6 months for someone to test positive.|`|1rNVgEDIaa	Extremely unlikely.|`|pUIGCtaZaa	Regarding the kissing, no, HIV is not spread through kissing unless you both have cuts/sores in your mouth that are bleeding and there is an exchange of blood. Regarding the fingering, this is possible but EXTREMELY unlikely. Unless she was bleeding in the vaginal area or you somehow transmitted her fluids through an orifice or cut on yourself, I would not be too concerned. However, you need to be safer next time you engage in sexual activity!|`|9lBe1JGAaa	Um...Unless both of you have cuts exposing blood, there is no chance of getting HIV from that kind of thing. <br>  <br>  If however you had a cut down there, and he had a sore in his mouth or somthing weird like that, it is possible to spread it. <br>  <br>  Just be careful and you guys have nothing to worry about.|`|5jQVj4Pfaa	HIV is spread through genital to genital contact through genital fluids. If you finger the vag and then go and wack off, well... there's possibility of maybe. Kissing it... I don't think so.<br>  <br>  It doesn't matter whether or not the girl was on her period or not. Fluids are fluids and are there all the time, otherwise... we females wouldn't have very nice ******* to our names, now, would we?|`|YAS3mwD8aa	Nope, it isn't possible to get HIV from kissing, nor from fingering.

17b088d67647626fb8f52e0b628f36f1aa	After you or someone you love receives a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, you're likely to experience many emotions, including anger, concern, guilt and fear. These issues are especially common in teens. All are normal responses. Talking openly about how you feel can help. It may also help to talk with others who are dealing with the same issues. <br>  <br>  That might mean joining a support group for parents of children with cystic fibrosis. Older children with the disorder may want to join a cystic fibrosis group to meet and talk with others who have the disease. Psychologists are often an important part of the care team as the child approaches the teen years. <br>  <br>  Support groups aren't for everyone. But often members of these groups can share information, experiences and solutions about the unique challenges associated with cystic fibrosis. If a support group isn't available in your area, you might consider Cystic-L, an e-mail support group for people with cystic fibrosis. Or, you may want to talk with another family who is dealing with the disease. Learning how others meet certain challenges may help you find solutions that work for you. <br>  <br>  Helping a child live normally <br>  It's natural for parents to want to protect their children, especially when the child has a chronic illness. But the best gift you can give a child with cystic fibrosis is a sense of normalcy. Most children with cystic fibrosis go to school, participate in sports and have active social lives. In time they may graduate from college and embark on careers, and many marry and raise families. Encouraging your child to be independent and self-reliant can help him or her have the fullest life possible. <br>  <br>  Preparing for the future also is key. Parents of a child with cystic fibrosis need to plan for their child's education and financial future, just as they would for any other child. <br>  <br>  Still, no matter how hard parents try to make life normal, children with cystic fibrosis often feel different. Even young children soon learn that not everyone has chest physical therapy or takes a handful of pills before each meal. But teenagers, who can be agonizingly self-conscious anyway, may feel their difference the most. <br>  <br>  You can help your child by talking about cystic fibrosis as soon as possible. Just what you say will depend on your child's age and personality. In general, help your child understand what cystic fibrosis is and why eating a healthy diet, taking enzymes and having chest physical therapy are important. Also teach your child to talk to others about cystic fibrosis in a straightforward way. Have your child explain that coughing helps clear the lungs and enzymes help digest food. <br>  <br>  Concerns of teenagers <br>  Teenagers, especially, may feel embarrassed about their cough, their slenderness and their medications. Most of all, they may worry that their illness will keep them from having a normal social life. And in fact, all the turbulence and difficulty of adolescence is compounded for teenagers with cystic fibrosis. Yet many teens find that being frank and open about cystic fibrosis can ease some of their concerns. <br>  <br>  Still, adolescents understandably may want to pretend they don't have cystic fibrosis. They may rebel against dietary restrictions, treatments and medications. And like other teenagers they may start to smoke. But normal rebelliousness can be life-threatening for young people with cystic fibrosis. If your teen is resisting treatment, a counselor, psychologist or social worker may be able to help. <br>  <br>  At the same time, you can boost your child's confidence and sense of normalcy by not being overly rigid. Don't be concerned if your child misses a chest therapy session now and then in order to participate in some activity. The goal is to help your child learn to live with cystic fibrosis, not to make it a way of life. <br>  <br>  Marriage and family <br>  Young adults with cystic fibrosis can't always be as carefree and spontaneous in their relationships as other young people can. But many resources are available that can make dealing with issues of marriage and intimacy easier. These include genetic counseling, fertility evaluation and financial counseling. Be sure to discuss your concerns with your doctor or a cystic fibrosis social worker. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Risk factors<br>  The greatest risk factor for cystic fibrosis is a family history of the disease. If both you and your partner come from families with cystic fibrosis, then each of your children has a one in four chance of having cystic fibrosis. <br>  <br>  Your risk is also greater if you're of Northern European ancestry. In that case, you have a one in 29 chance of carrying the gene. Among other ethnic groups in the United States, Hispanics have a one in 46 chance of carrying the gene, blacks have a one in 65 chance and Asian-Americans a one in 90 chance.
XoRkPaa1aa	First of all... Woop! YoU rOcK!!! Quitting smoking is harder than quitting meth, so congratulations to you. And so you know... Just 20 minutes after you took that last drag, your heart rate and blood pressure went back to a healthy low; 12 hours after, the carbon monoxide level in your blood drops to normal (driving you crazy); 2 weeks to 3 months after quitting, your circulation improves. This made you much healthier, but there's more to come for you. 1-9 months after that last deathly puff, coughing and shortness of breath decrease, lungs function normally, growing back cilia (tiny hairs inside you- good). After one year of no smoke, the excess risk of heart disease is half that of a smoker's. 4 years and 4 months from today, your risk of stroke is reduced to that of a non-smoker (5 -15 years after quitting). Not done. 10 years after quitting, your chance of getting lung (mouth, throat, esophagus, bladder, cervix and pancreas too) cancer is half that of a habitual smoker. 15 years after quitting your risk of heart disease is that of a non smoker. So your breath smells better, your teeth are whiter, food tastes and smells better...and you'll most likely live a hell of a lot longer. But like I said, it's harder than meth. You will always crave a cigarette, or at least some people do. Just be strong, and the craving will have to get weaker. Like all things it just takes time...and if it takes up to 15 years to undo the damage you have caused yourself, then when do you think you won't want a cigarette again? Again, good for you.|`|ZE88oBuuaa	You are problably craving them more because you are around people who are smoking/chewing/dipping tobacco.  If i was you i would go invest in something like nicotine gum.  Or those pills that help stop nicotine craving.  But GREAT job on not smoking for so long.  I myself am trying to quit dip tobacco.  and i'm down to 1 dip a day....rather than 4-5.  So when i do finaly quit...i'm going to make sure i limit the people i am around who smoke or do any tobacco products and probably invest in some nicotine gum|`|44BEm1Uhaa	10 years without...Still crave them|`|8ftQzDzxaa	I have been trying to quit for ages, i have tried everything read books ,taken pills, patches, i have been trying smoke deter it says it replaces some of the needs rather than cold turkey,its a spray,you use a couple of times a day,it really has been helping, this is the longest i have gone without, at the moment they are doing an offer with two free bottles,it costs but it really is working|`|SHQHnKfcaa	Cravings will always be there, my dad hasn't smoked in 12 years and he still doesn't want the smell around him because it gives him carvings.<br>  <br>  Try not be exposed to people that smoke, even bars and eating out.<br>  <br>  Now, how long this will last, I guess it is mind over matter and hopefully you can control that crave because I smoke and wish I could quit too.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|3c69b107d5ca339c6b1746ad0f2379f4aa	Its good , do keep it up !

L1FC2nKQaa	It may be infected. Because of this, you need to call whoever took them out. They should let you come back for a consult for free- almost all dentists/oral surgeons do not charge for post-operative care- it's usually included in the cost of  surgery. <br>  It could be a dry socket, which is less serious but equally or more painful. But since I can't diagnose anything since I haven't seen it, I recommend you go back to whoever extracted them to begin with. Just call, tell them you just had them out, tell them you're in pain and want to come back in. They should let you.|`|zAXlJpqcaa	It's possible that you have some root exposure in that tooth.  It can occur in an adjacent tooth if the extracted one was butting up against it (not uncommon when you have a horizontal impaction).

Donating blood has nothing to do with this, I doubt it. Your body will a new supply of blood every 48 seconds, so I guess 5 - 10 minutes is enough rest and it shouldn't effect the way you function normally. I'm guessing you could be scare of blood?<br>  <br>  Before you could donate any blood, they do an overall check to see if you have enough iron and all those white and blood cells, they wont't give you a chance if you are low on any of your essentials.|`|4UcHI5voaa	There is definately a problem here, so I would reccomend going to see a doctor. You may be anemic, it depends on when you gave blood, if it is near or around your period this could be responsible. Go see a doctor, and/or the people you gave blood through.|`|rfboTBTWaa	Hypoglycemia? Diabetes? <br>  <br>  Maybe just fainting spells. <br>  <br>  Carry come type of snack with you.

I would go to the doctor if I were you .|`|mpiwO5p9aa	The only thing that you can do is not worry yourself because if you are pregnant it won't be good for the baby. You'll need to go to the doctor to find out if you really are pregnant. And tell them that you had the shot and you want to know what the risks are if you find out that you are pregnant. Just dont worry yourself too much but do make sure you go see a doctor and voice your concerns with them....:)
6810e02779e654863b71475b91405d0aaa	Be sure that it is the tooth that hurts,  not just  a sore gums as an after effect of the dental work. Sometimes it is done in stages  so the nerve  might not be completely dead. If they put in a temporary filling  and made an appointment for you to return that might be the problem. However if  they put in a permeate filling, it should no longer cause pain, so if it is still hurting it means something went wrong. If it hurts more when you eat something hot,  it is probably and infection and you should treat it like an emergency|`|JJ1qjygyaa	your back teeth have four different nerve endings.  i know i had a root canal done on a molar and they had to drill into all four channels of the four roots and remove nerves from each.  i had two root canals done, and i didn't get them capped cause it was $1000 each, and i lost both of the teeth that i paid $700 to have canalled within a year.  apparently once root canalled they become brittle sometimes grayish in colored so just to offer some advice...if you get nerves removed or root canals, cap the tooth. otherwise you will lose it in a matter of a year or so. i learned the hard way.  now i am pricing dental implants. good luck with your tooth.  theres no pain worse than a tooth ache.  any pain that radiates from the head is unbearable.
JV8HfDb4aa	No it is not a technical term for growing pains, but don't worry, you aren't going to have it forever. lol<br>  Osgood Schlatters is pretty common in young athletes.  All it is is an inflammation of your tibial tuberosity (bony protrusion below the knee - everyone has this protrusion) generally caused by overuse.  The injury requires rest!  It will clear up when you are done growing and your tendons are stronger.  It is going to hurt when you go to do a lay-up or dunk b/c weight-bearing exercise makes it worse.  Only do as much as you can without it hurting.  You're better off doing a smaller amount of exercise/practice, but of higher quality, than many hours of practice.  <br>  In the mean time you could use ice to help alleviate pain and inflammation (apply ice for only 10-15 min at a time maybe 3 times a day).  Supportive knee braces can also be used.  You're best off to go to a sports physician to get proper treatment.  <br>  Here's a website I found with some extra info that would be of help.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sportsinjuryclinic.net/cybertherapist/front/knee/osgood.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sportsinjuryclinic.net/cybert...</a><br>  <br>  good luck
aOUjMhUmaa	Okay, I have an ectothermic metabolism as well, so I'll weigh in on this.<br>  <br>  I am 24 years old, and I have the same problem. In high school, when I was your age, I joined a weight-lifting class, and I was able to gain like 10 pounds, but after that, I plateaued and now I can't.<br>  <br>  I hate to say it, but you're fighting a losing battle. I know how you must feel--the subject of "skinny guy" jokes and everybody treating you like you're weak, even if you're more physically fit and strong than they are. It really pisses me off, but I'm starting to realize I can't get my body to stop processing food so quickly.<br>  <br>  My only advice to you is that you just continue working out and doing weight-training. The difference between you and I is that I stopped working out regularly after high school, but you have the opportunity to keep it up.<br>  <br>  Remember that IT WILL TAKE TIME.<br>  <br>  Just put your best effort into it, don't give up, and you will see results. Remember, YOU ARE YOUNG, so your potential is greater and your recovery time is much better.<br>  I remember being able to run several miles, work out for an hour, and I would be sore for like a day at the most, and then BAM, I was back to the gym.<br>  <br>  Now I get sore for like a week, and it makes me not want to work out, and I see very little results.<br>  <br>  You have the potential... just keep it up for another 6 months, and increase the weight you are lifting. If you're body doesn't need to use all the protein you're ingesting, it just won't use it, and so you will be wasting your time.<br>  <br>  Also remember, your body can only process so much protein per day... that's the number one reason the Atkins diet makes people lose weight, because it is so high in protein, so the body is forced to shed pounds to get energy.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  God bless.|`|vEGkSHMsaa	Your hockey would be the cause. Thats going to be A LOT of exercise. It is burning lots of calories that could be going toward muscle growth. Muscles need a lot of calories to grow. And with your diet, I doubt very seriously that is 4-5k cals. More like 3000, if that. Drink more milk, drinking 2 cups of WHOLE milk with each meal will add 900+ calories to your diet. <br>  <br>  Eat more than 3 meals a day. Try throwing in peanut butter and banana sandwiches with a couple more glasses of milk. You need the extra calories to make up for all the exercising your doing in hockey. If your body fat is lowering, you are not having enough calories to build muscle.|`|KkvyQLvfaa	Nothing is wrong.  You actually answered your own question in your opening statement.  You may begin gaining weight as you get older.  You will need to adjust your eating habits as your body changes.  As for now, the weight gaining may not happen.  Enjoy the advantages of a high metabolism.  Your high metabolism will burn everything.|`|FySsEWGWaa	My idea about this is that you may not be getting enough replenishment after your ice hockey sessions. Its essential that you have a high protein meal and protein shake less than 30 minutes after a highly intense event like a hockey session.|`|y3I1qSHEaa	Try and concentrate more on doing weight training exercises rather than cardio.  This will give wear and tear to your muscles, and then when you eat it will help you to put on weight.|`|3EcjCux4aa	You need to eat more.  Make sure your protein shakes are good quality.  Beverly is a top product and so are a few others, but most use inferior grade products that are nothing but a waste of your money. <br>  Have whole milk every meal, and make sure you're getting a recovery meal after every workout and a protein meal every night before you go to bed.  <br>  Your body does most of it's remodeling while you sleep, and cortisol levels skyrocket during this time.  Eating a slow acting protein (casein or meat) will lower your cortisol, meaning less muscle breakdown and greater accumulation over time.<br>  You also need to make sure you're getting enough rest.  8 hours minimum per night.

AA10246871	It's most likely hemorrhoids. If you were bleeding in your intestinal tract, there's be blood in the water, and it would be dark. You're only bleeding on the paper when you wipe.<br>  <br>  They form when the little vessels at the end of your rectum (internal) or in your anus (external) swell and bleed because of pressure. When you are constipated, you exert a lot of pressure trying to go to the bathroom, and that can make those vessels bleed. I am surprised you didn't get them when you were pregnant--nearly every woman I know who has been pregnant got them during that time.<br>  <br>  You can help the pain by applying a topical anesthetic, like Preparation H. You can also take brief warm baths in the tub to help soothe the area. For the time being, it's probably also a good idea to use moist wipes to clean yourself instead of toilet paper, which is very rough. <br>  <br>  I am sure you have a visit scheduled with your doc to make sure you are doing fine postpartum. Mention it to him or her when you go in, and they may tell you something else to do to help the problem.<br>  <br>  And one more thing--it isn't terribly serious. Hurts like crazy from what I have been told, but I've never heard of anyone dying from it.<br>  <br>  Take care, and congratulations on the new baby.

AA12266052	The heart has an internal electrical system that controls the rhythm of the heartbeat. Problems can cause abnormal heart rhythms, called arrhythmias. There are many types of arrhythmia. During an arrhythmia, the heart can beat too fast, too slow, or it can stop beating. Sudden cardiac arrest occurs when the heart develops an arrhythmia that causes it to stop beating. This is different than a heart attack, where the heart usually continues to beat but blood flow to the heart is blocked.<br>  There are many possible causes of cardiac arrest. They include coronary heart disease, heart attack, electrocution, drowning, or choking. There may not be a known cause to the cardiac arrest.|`|oBwbbmiVaa	hmm let me think!!! I think if a person has Cardiac Arrest he wont be able to live anymore.

Y4ogWjHOaa	Do you mean during cardiac arrest or post cardiac arrest?<br>  <br>  Love Mel.X|`|2sycPf8Daa	The immediate cause of sudden cardiac arrest is usually an abnormality in your heart rhythm (arrhythmia), the result of a malfunction in your heart's electrical system. <br>  <br>  Unlike other muscles in your body, which rely on nerve connections to receive the electrical stimulation they need to function, your heart has its own electrical stimulator — a specialized group of cells called the sinus node, located in the upper right chamber (right atrium) of your heart. The sinus node generates electrical impulses that flow in an orderly manner through your heart to synchronize heart rate and coordinate the pumping of blood from your heart to the rest of your body. <br>  <br>  If something goes wrong with the sinus node or the flow of electric impulses through your heart, an arrhythmia can result, causing your heart to beat too fast, too slow or in an irregular fashion. Often, these interruptions in rhythm are momentary and harmless. But some types of arrhythmia can be serious and lead to a sudden stop in heart function (sudden cardiac arrest). <br>  <br>  The most common cause of cardiac arrest is an arrhythmia called ventricular fibrillation — when rapid, erratic electrical impulses cause your ventricles to quiver uselessly instead of pumping blood. Without an effective heartbeat, your blood pressure plummets, cutting off blood supply to your vital organs. <br>  <br>  Most of the time, cardiac-arrest-inducing arrhythmias don't occur on their own. In a person with a normal, healthy heart, a sustained arrhythmia is unlikely to develop without some outside trigger, such as an electrical shock, the use of illegal drugs, or trauma to the chest at just the wrong time of the heart's cycle (commotio cordis). <br>  More details? Ask your doctor.<br>  <br>  Take care as always.

xTm5hK4vaa	It definitely depends how old you are.  For younger teenagers it sometimes takes a while to get regular.  I have a 16 year old cousin who has had only 3 periods since she started menstruating which was a couples years ago.  <br>  However, if you are, say beyond 19, it's something to see a doctor about.  My sister stopped having her period when she was about 20, and by that time it's not healthy and you should see a doctor.  Her doctor gave her a prescription to make sure menstruate and it worked.  She doesn't have to have it every month, but when it stops for that long and you aren't pregnant, it is a issue for your health.<br>  <br>  So really this depends on your age.|`|IrfbapHAaa	you might be having a kid in a couple daysss...|`|AA12131791	Well how old are you.<br>  If you are young it may be normal as your hormones are taking time to straighten out<br>  If you are worried speak to your doctor|`|CkdSTD1Baa	Well, it could be a numebr of things.

JV8HfDb4aa	First you have to realize that there really isn't an "easy" way to lose weight, but there are plenty of manageable ways to lose it.  Eating 5 to 6 smaller meals a day combined with exercise is the best way.  The smaller/healthy meals throughout the day helps to jump-start your metabolism and keep it up all day more than just 3 larger meals.  The exercise will help you build muscle which eats away at your fat cells.  A combination of weight-lifting (low weight/high rep) and cardio should do the trick for exercise.|`|41519dcd613e198147ae134a0f6e6e78aa	Pranayam and Yoga, Drink atleast eight glasses of water every day.<br>  don't eat junk food|`|F9Ll7oLJaa	do kapalbhati pranayam as suggetsed by baba Ramdev in Aastha channel|`|X9QOHRLFaa	well lets put it this way walking for an hour burns no more than 220 calories, where as a kilogram of fat has over 7000 calories.

tB7GkTi5aa	If you're happy with what you are doing and still are losing weight, go with it. But the best exercise for weight loss is actually interval training - very short intense periods of exercise followed by "rest" periods. <br>  <br>  You may actually be doing something like this since you mention you are both walking and running during your hour sessions. But, if your exercise period is intense enough, you don't have to work out for an hour. In fact, 10 minutes a day may suffice. <br>  <br>  I have a lot of information on this on my website if you are interested. If you find you stop losing weight, I would definitely consider starting an interval training program. <br>  <br>  B Schibly MD<br>  <a href="http://www.physicians-weight-loss-tips.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.physicians-weight-loss-tips.c...</a>|`|vPWOlX03aa	for having fit body the only thing is that you should have sweating once in a day.while doing exercise or going for morning walk.|`|r2gonS44aa	You may not stop losing weight FOREVER, but it WILL be harder to take the weight off, you will have to run harder and faster, longer to take the weight off.<br>  <br>  Your body will pleateu and it will become harder to lose weight then,  What you want to do is every 6-8 weeks change up to a different work out regiem,  It will also keep things fresh and new for you so that you don't give up on working out and you will also start to lose weight in specific areas and tone a bit more then usual.<br>  <br>  I would consider speaking with a personal trainer just once and have this person help you set up 3-4 different routines that you can do over and over. Just to switch things up.|`|jg1pbV5Xaa	You will reach a place where you stop for a while, or loose less. If you change the way you do your running, add weights, go faster or slower, then your less likely to. Lifting your arms changes your center point which changes the stresses on the body so exercises more muscles yet your still running is an example.
XYyIABaXaa	1) Get some exercise if you're not. This can be HUGE for the "tossing and turning" problems. Even just get outside for some fresh air during the day.<br>  <br>  2) Make sure you're having no caffeine in the afternoon/evening. Not just soda, but also coffee, etc. If your bedtime snacks are sugar-filled, that can also cause sleep problems.<br>  <br>  3) If you're having racing thoughts / stressers, you can try putting a notepad next to your bed and writing down things that come to your head. This can be really good for clearing and calming your active mind.<br>  <br>  4) If all these fail, it could be possible you have sleep apnea. This means getting a CPAP or similar device could help you a lot.

XoRkPaa1aa	I'd love to say nothing is wrong with you but there's something wrong with everyone. How long is ages? If you've been feeling bad since about 9 years and started your menstrual cycle early, it could just be puberty. I know, that sounds lame. But most 14 year olds are fleeting between happiness, sorrow and anger. And every 14 feels that as the strongest feelings. Because, biologically, these are the strongest feelings you will feel in your life. Your brain is surging hormones because your body needs to grow. And in the next few years (if not already) your hips and breast will grow, hair will pop up in places it never was, and you're bleeding on a monthly basis. All of this is very stressful because not only are you dealing with these changes, but you're realizing that other people can think about you (just remember, they're realizing the same thing, and they're just as worried as you) But it's what you don't notice that's causing the most stress. Your emotion processing center in your brain is developing slowly... so you have all these new hormones and an immature processing center....overload. Also, your frontal lobe will not be done developing til you're 25, so until then, you will not be able to think as clearly as you ever will. As for acne meds, I don't know much about it, but if it has an effect on your emotions it is only adding to all the stress you're going through. Which is tough, because you want to take the meds, it will help your skin now like it couldn't later in life. So my advice, stay strong. You will, like the rest of us, undergo an amazing amount of stress while being incredible confused about absolutely everything life has to offer, and you will come out of it and independent, sure and able adult. Try to enjoy your youth, but keep in mind better years are ahead. And YOU'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING WRONG. That's a normal feeling too...but if you don't handle this transition well you could end up confused and down on yourself. Just take everything lightly... There's no way you could be doing something so wrong, that you don't deserve the best of life. Maybe you could take some time to introvert. Starting a dream journal is my favourite self discovering advice. Just write your dreams each morning right when you wake up, and analyze it to try to determine what the inner you wants. Just an idea. Find a tallent, because you have tons, and build on it. Before you know it, you'll have your confidence and more.|`|ulYTAfXtaa	if it is not a constant down feeling that you are having, you probably aren't depressed or bipolar or crazy or anything, just a normal teenage girl with normal teenage moodswings. i have them, my friends have them, everyone has them.  it's okay. don't feel bad, just try to calm yourself down if you feel too overwhelmed with something. <br>  :)|`|6TVAut8naa	You are changing from child to adult.<br>  It is almoust as menopause is for many women.<br>  <br>  But your changes are even bigger.<br>  <br>  Trye physical exercise.<br>  <br>  But moust of all, just let it happend.<br>  <br>  Be skeptic to medication at such a young age.<br>  <br>  It can make you apathic.<br>  <br>  People shouldn`t medicate tenagers for tenage rebellion.<br>  Or for just being tenagers.<br>  <br>  Tenagers need a lot of sleep. Big changes go on.
6e0PG4YWaa	I would say that is most likely normal that you are getting dark bags and circles under your eyes.  I am not sure how long it lasts, but I'm pretty sure that can be an affect of lack of alcohol in your system.

I'm sure you're beautiful.<br>   <br>  If you lose weight at a fast pace, you're also really likely to gain it (and more) back. Just walk or jog for twenty minutes a day, or thirty four or so days a week, and aim for a lose of 1.3kg every two weeks. Still, you're already healthy... you're at a BMI of 22.1, which is healthy.<br>   <br>  A BMI of 18.5 is underweight.
fbolJsrIaa	The problem that see is definitely not your work ethic.  It's your work out that you need to tweak.  Start doing some push ups or lighting weights if you have access to some.  Once your body starts putting on muscle the weight will start dropping pretty fast.  Keep doing what you are doing as far as the running goes.<br>  <br>  If you want to join a fitness community that's free I'm putting the link below.  It's sort of like a myspace for fitness though. It's full of great information from pro athlete and trainers.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you|`|FcqOie0zaa	You can't lose 20 pounds in a month, it's too fast. If you somehow manage to do it, it will be gained back.  Try losing 20 pounds over the next 2 to 3 months if you want to be realistic. Cardio is good, but you should also do toning exercise to get firm muscles (like a six pack). Do situps, squats, and other toners.|`|HxHvhZAsaa	your an idiot. first of all, its more than likely impossible because all the hard work your doing will turn into muscle mass. which is a lot heavier than fat. second, weighing that little at your height and age is dangerous and not healthy. but if you must, wrap yourself in trash bags or anything like it (seran wrap) and sweat like crazy doing cardio stuff. staying away from protein. eat empty carb meals with water, tons and tons of water, you will be unhealthy in no time|`|VwaZwFUGaa	Yea, no matter how many people tell you that you can lose the jiggle, it's still not likely.

The people in the gym should tell you what exercises you should do cause they are supposed to help and they are more experienced then people on the internet. <br>  <br>  But I do not think 20 pounds is a healthy to lose in a month...more like 8 - 13 pounds. But I do not really know so the best thing to do is go to the gym before school (if you go to school) wait an hour after schools finished then go swimming or if you do not know how to swim learn. Swimming is really good and one of the easiest sports to do. I like going to the gym because once im there i have to exercise and don't put it off. U could also try a low card diet....or a diet with it as this will be really effective. Just join a leisuire centre and go...or if you don't have the money you could go to the leisuire centre and ask if you could talk to a fitness instructor, if they help then good if they don't then go to the doctors and ask them. Then just exercise all you can your already doing a great job. Keep it up.<br>  Hope this helped.

Artificial sweeteners contain chemicals that are toxic to your body, drinking things loaded with real sugar is bad enough.<br>  <br>  2. The breakfast is perhaps too high in sugar also, and lacking in protein. Try swapping the jam for some protein like a poached, boiled or scrambled egg. If you don't like egg, then hummus and avocado or grilled tomato is nice too.<br>  <br>  3. For lunch or dinner you could add some complex carb like whole wheat bread, rice or pasta.

(It ALWAYS works for me)<br>  <br>  Another thing that might work, is to massage your lower stomach, you might actually feel the gassiness moving around, but that ususally gets me to fart. lol  (Its also helps me to lower the bloat in my tummy)<br>  <br>  Drink milk for the heartburn, that soothes pain.  <br>  <br>  I wouldn't drink much water, you might be bloated from some water retention... And if you drink more, it might start to hurt.  (I've had that too...) <br>  A meditive way that will help the digestion and the gas is to do this meditative position...<br>  Sit on the floor on your knees, lean a bit forward and place your hands on the ground in front of you. <br>  Pant, like a dog. Tongue out and everything.<br>  When you pant, pant with your stomach -NOT your chest.

Lets look at this from outside of the picture. You were together one month before she left for australia. (my home). In this One month you generated a love that has you in a major depression and using drugs and alcohol to cope. MY personal experience of this made me relate to you. <br>  <br>  You need help. I am guessing your childhood was not the greatest and that you mostly feel uncomfortable around people. I did. But what is going on here has absolutely nothing to do with love. Sure it feels like it, but you probably don't have a true understanding of love. <br>  <br>  To be this attached to someone after 1 month together is an obsession. You are seeking to find happiness through this girl. <br>  <br>  Well you can have all the happiness you desire but you will need to learn a thing or three about yourself. I would suggest going to either Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous or alcoholics anonymous. There are hundreds of valid reasons for this just far too many to type.<br>  <br>  But what you really need here is a true understanding of yourself, your life, and your emotional responses. SLAA will be able to help you through all of it. If you feel uncomfortable about going there, go to AA where the same program can be found, and because you have "a desire to stop drinking"(which is the only requirement for AA membership) you qualify. Just go there and tell the truth. You will get the help you need and find people just like you who can distract you from your LOVE long enough to get you the help you need.<br>  <br>  Believe me. 9 years after Rachel went back to England I am extremely happy in a Love filled contented relationship that has lasted 5 years and is growing stronger every day.

I know you have the inner strength to move on.|`|zhh35hyaaa	Oh dear you've had a really hard time of it, it sounds like you fell in love with her a lot harder than she with you, which I'm sure you realise.<br>  <br>  You seem like such a loving, amazing guy, basically no matter how much you still feel for her you have to realise that part of your life is over and its time to move on. It's hard, painful to a debilitating degree but this phase is 'normal'. Don't put yourself down or think badly of yourself- you're greiving for her so these thoughts and feeling you are going through are to be expected. <br>  <br>  In the short term, get outdoors, go to a zoo, go to the beach or forest. Nature has a way of cleansing I always rely on for my own sanity.<br>  And you know what, every relationship that ends means that actually there is something else waiting for you. It may not be a girlfriend, it might be a new job, an opportunity, travel- something that wouldn't have happened previously. You may not feel like doing much now but I say this: keep your options open! keep your eyes peeled for opportunity!<br>  <br>  You're an actor? Well- this experience can only make you better at your work! It's all part of the human experience.<br>  <br>  I've been through about 3 extremely painful break ups (I'm not a spring chicken!), and looking back, they led to new chapters in my life.

7IjGzvqTaa	Often times, when people stand up too quickly, the blood rushes away from your head faster than it can circulate back, and the sudden dip in oxygen often causes a mild "black out."  This is more or less a very temporary loss of consciousness; I remember in second grade, I stood up very quickly and stretched (a powerful combination), and I just remember my vision fading away and a very slight sensation of falling backwards.  Well, it turned out that I had fallen over backwards because the next thing I knew, I was looking up at a whole bunch of classmates staring at me going "WHOA! COOL!"  Ah, second graders...<br>  <br>  Anyway, blackouts aren't much to worry about, as long as they don't occur too often, or for too long.  Usually you don't have to worry about this, as when you black out, you generally fall down, over, etc., and the pressure in your body is returned to normal.  The tingly sensation comes from the pressurization of the blood rushing around in your body faster than it normally would.  Nothing to worry about!  You'll be fine.|`|0bjQfb01aa	You probably just stand up too fast and get a little dizzy/disoriented. Just try to get up slower and you'll be fine.|`|DXV0A1haaa	No, getting a blackout from just standing up is NOT normal.  It's a sign that your brain is not getting as much oxygen as it needs, and is most likely an early indicator that your health is extremely poor.  If it happens regularly just from normal activities like standing up or walking a flight of stairs, then chances are you are either anemic, morbidly obese, or suffering some form of cardiac or respiratory distress.  Especially at 14!  The tingling sensation is another sign of oxygen debt - it's your nerves being starved for oxygen just like your brain has been when it goes dark.  <br>  <br>  Now, getting a headrush or blackout after working out hard, especially doing exercises on the floor then standing up immediately after stopping, that's pretty normal because the body tends to "crash" when you stop exercising, and a period of oxygen debt is to be expected.|`|E31lHgYIaa	Its totally normal.

EIrdLq6Zaa	The left arm and shoulder are direct links to the heart. Was it shooting pain or discomfort? Find out if heart disease is prevalent in your family history. This is a strong indication for heart problems. If it continues you really need to speak with your doctor. Another option is if you really feel pain there take a baby aspirin 81mg chewable. This can prevent heart attacks. it might have just been a pulled muscle too.

fwWO14fIaa	bodyweight exercises are best if youdon't want to go to the gym, such as press ups, sit ups, crunches, tricep dips, squats, pull ups. try purchasing a cheap set of dumbells, as this will help you better than bodyweight exercises. as for diet you need to be eating lots of protein such as chicken, beef, turkey, eggs, yogurts, protein shakes, fish and unsalted nuts. you also need to consume 1g of protein for every pound of bodyweight, so if you weigh 120 pounds then 120 grams of protein you need to comsume daily to build muscle.
CciXZNYraa	Work the entire area of the thigh when working out. Work the inner, side, front, back and buttocks. Exercises such as the bicycle, leg lifts, leg slides, squeezing a stability ball and leg raises help slim the thighs. <br>  <br>  Reduce the amounts of carbohydrates and fats in your diet. If you notice that your thighs store fat, then any excess fat from food and drink will go straight to your thighs.

I had mine done in June and ever since I have almost no feeling at the point of ejaculation (climax).  A few times I didn't even know I had ejaculated  until I started losing my erection afterwards.  On a scale of 1-10 I think only twice in the past 9 months I reached a 4-5.  I did however end up with chronic testicular pain that required surgery last week and am still recovering from that.<br>  <br>  Look here<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.revolutionhealth.com/forums/mens-health/bedroom/102817?page=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.revolutionhealth.com/forums/m...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://vasectomypain.org" rel="nofollow">http://vasectomypain.org</a>|`|XKhNw221aa	he still would "shoot" out seminal fluid, just not semen. everything would be the same.|`|1PXkhhzQaa	Vasectomy blocks the flow of sperm from the testes to the ejaculatory ducts as the operation cuts or blocks the vas deferens (tubes from the testes that carry sperm to the ejaculatory ducts).<br>  <br>  Ejaculation has two phases: emission and ejaculation proper. The emission phase of the ejaculatory reflex is under control of the sympathetic nervous system, while the ejaculatory phase is under control of a spinal reflex at the level of the spinal nerves S2-4 via the pudendal nerve. <br>  <br>  The beginning of emission is typically experienced as a "point of no return," also known as point of ejaculatory inevitability. The sperm then passes through the ejaculatory ducts and is mixed with fluids from the seminal vesicles, the prostate, and the bulbourethral glands to form the semen, or ejaculate. During ejaculation proper, the semen is ejected through the urethra with rhythmic contractions.<br>  <br>  Men are told that vasectomy has no effect on orgasm or ejaculation and for many men this turns out to be true. It is possible to injure the sympathetic nerves that travel with the vas deferens during vasectomy. In addition, prostatic secretory function is changed by vasectomy. The secretory function of both the prostate and the epididymis are changed as a result of vasectomy. Both prostatic secretions and epididymal secretions decrease after vasectomy. 1 group of 12 men vasectomized for 1 week to 8 years were reanastomized (had a vasectomy reversal) and followed up for 12 months. Semen volume, seminal critic acid, maltase, glycerophosphorylcholine, prolactin, zinc, and magnesium returned to normal levels within 6 months, some within 1 month. (so vasectomy reversal corrects the situation)<br>  <br>  Some men do complain of:<br>  1) decreased ejaculatory volume<br>  2) decreased sensation of orgasm<br>  3) decreased expulsive force (becomes a semen "dribbler" instead of a "shooter")<br>  4) pain on ejaculation<br>  <br>  Number 1 above has been proven by studies on semen from vasectomized men and normal men. The reduction in volume averaged 40%. (Judging this subjectively would be difficult - could you tell the difference between 4.0 ml and 3.0 ml?) <br>  <br>  Number 2 and 3  are hard to study but have been reported.<br>  <br>  Number four is simply another reported side effect. It has been confirmed in surveys after vasectomy. Pain on ejaculation affects about 4 to 5% of men after vasectomy according to these post-vasectomy surveys.<br>  <br>  So the answer is that most men don't notice a difference in orgasm or climax, but some men do. this information belongs in the informed consent for vasectomy even if the percentages are low. If you are in the 4 to 5%, vasectomy can become a big regret in life. The most common vasectomy outcome that can affect quality of life is chronic pain, yet it is not featured on the consent. Seems unfair to me.|`|khgwEYfQaa	he would climax exactly the same way as a guy who hasn't had a vasectomy.<br>  <br>  there will be no difference in his libido, ejaculation, colour or quantity of semen. the only difference will the semen will not contain sperm.<br>  ?|`|jeDExMWBaa	He will shoot blanks and yes he will climax the same!

jreBiPcGaa	As far as your levels are concerned they are considered "normal". I have been going through getting diagnosed with hypothyroidism also.  I suggest first of all go to stopthethyroidmadness.com and learn all you can about the disease, I am still researching.  As of 2003 they changed the levels for diagnosis, but most labs and doctors still go by the old levels.  The new levels are TSH 0.3-3.0, free T4 0.7-2.0 and free T-3 should be 2.3-4.2.  I would suggest that you have your free T4 and free T3 checked along with your TSH.  Also ask to have your ferritin levels checked.  I was low on ferritin which is the protein in your blood and can lead to anemia if not corrected. Low ferritin levels can also make you very tired and experience hair loss. My ferritin was at 11 and most people feel good at 70-90 range.  Make sure and find a doctor who does not just treat you by what the lab reports say, but will also treat you for your symptoms, because a thyroid problem can be hard to discover and many go left untreated because of so called "Normal" lab results.  <br>  <br>  Wish you all the luck and hope this helps.

EIrdLq6Zaa	Strange answer but I'll give it a shot. Are you able to masturbate? If you can and successfully then you will be able to have intercourse. By any chance are you on any anti-depressants. Many of this class of drugs unfortunately decreases the  ability to reach an orgasm and even keep an erection. Diabetes as you know decreases the blood flow through the body including "down there." Any of these medical issues can reduce your ability and stamina. If your girlfriend truly loves you then you will need to find another way to give her pleasure. Also- are you giving yourself enough foreplay to get extremely aroused? Lots of things to think about here. Good luck.|`|tjTbkxkzaa	Try a vacuum pump prescribed from a doctor or buy online.

VHVkgzKmaa	You wouldn't ovulate if you miss a pill. The thing about the birth control pill is that you DON'T ovulate. The pill makes your body think you're pregnant and an egg does not come down. The period that you get when you're on the pill is the lining coming out that has naturally built up in that month's time.<br>  <br>  However, if you are inconsistent with your pills, it does increase your chance of getting pregnant. You need to make sure you take it everyday at the same time everyday (don't worry you can give or take a couple hours), and as soon as you realize you missed a pill, TAKE ONE!<br>  <br>    <br>   <br>  "The main function of this type of oral contraceptive is to suppress ovulation, or the release of an egg from your ovaries. This is done through the increased levels of estrogen your body receives from the Pill. However, today's birth control pills contain far lesser amounts of estrogen than their predecessors. As a result, ovulation may still occur anywhere from 2 to 10% of the time. <br>  <br>  Although preventing ovulation is the primary method though which the Pill attempts to prevent pregnancy, the extra estrogen and progesterone in your system also work to thicken your cervical mucus. This makes it more difficult for sperm to reach an egg. <br>  <br>  The Pill also causes the lining of the uterus to thin, possibly preventing the implantation of a fertilized egg. Because it is not known how often the pill works in this manner, if at all, most health centers will not cite the thinning of the endometrial lining as a function of the pill."

Make sure you are in a comfortable position and your tailbone does not have undue pressure on it. Next, slowly move your knees up to your chest and 'hug' them for a count of 5 seconds.

Do this at least 10 times a set.<br>  <br>  Get on your hands and knees, with your knees together. Slowly ease your rear end down to your heels, so that your thighs are touching your calves.

DpA72sXzaa	I've had to stop and re-start due to lapses in income or insurance, and it was fine for me. The key is to start again on the Sunday after you've gotten your next period. So, say you get your period today, start your pack on Sunday, if you start on Monday take your pill next weekend, etc. If you start after your period like that, it minimizes your chances of spotting or feeling hormonally out-of-whack. You might feel like you have to readjust to the pill, but it won't hurt your body if you start the pill again.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your new promotion!
CciXZNYraa	Try these exercises;<br>  <br>  Sit ups: Please note that sit-ups can be a strenuous activity on the lower back. Understanding how to get a six pack and not damage yourself in the process is critical. Do not strain yourself; build up this type of exercise slowly. Twisting during this exercise (left elbow to right knee) is NOT effective and put the lower back under tremendous stress. If you feel even the slightest twinge, then stop. <br>  In order to strengthen your abs, care and technique are necessary. Effective sit-ups need to pull the torso towards the knees from a lying position only using the abdominal group of muscles. If you have your legs straight on the floor then more powerful muscles in the legs will do most of the work.<br>  To counteract this you should bend your knees while sitting up and so make the abdominal muscles feel the burn. If you gather a momentum you will not be working the muscles effectively. Only by slowly raising and lowering will you achieve the best results. <br>  <br>  Leg lifts: The challenge with this exercise is to keep your legs straight and not to let your feet touch the floor. <br>  Lie of the floor with your hands by your sides. Keeping your legs straight lift them to 90 Degree and back down but to do allow then to touch the ground, repeat back to the 90 degrees position. <br>  <br>  Jacknife Sit-ups: Discover how to get a six pack the hard way with this intense workout.<br>  Start as you would in the position to do sit-ups with your hands at your sides. <br>  Without bending your knees, simultaneously lift you legs in the air and your head and shoulder so that your whole body makes a V-shape. If you can manage it the try to touch your toes. <br>  Then relax and go back to the starting position. <br>  <br>  V-ups: This exercise requires good balance and strong core muscles. It can be performed on a bench but can also be carried out on a mat on the floor(but don't let those legs touch the floor).<br>  Bending your knees, simultaneously lift your legs and your torso so they form a V as you can see from the photo. Then go back to the relax position, during this exercise you arms should remain horizontal. <br>  <br>  The Static hold: Get into the push-up position but with your forearms touching the ground. Make sure your body is a straight line from your shoulders down to your toes and hold that position for a minimum of 1 minute. <br>  This exercise strengthen your core abdominal muscles. Repeat this exercise more and more as you strengthen the core muscles. <br>  <br>  Understanding how to get a six pack through strengthening your core muscles is key to achieving great abs!|`|fwWO14fIaa	you need to stop snacking on the junk and start stopping yourself before you do it, because it's all mental resistance, and if you need to snack on some food, try eating fruit or nuts and raisins instead of junk food that has no nutritional value, and drink lots of water a day (about 2 -3 litres) this will help flush out the toxins in the body which contribute to your body fat.

Rectal bleeding refers to passage of bright red blood from the anus that is mixed with stool. Most episodes of rectal bleeding are mild and stop on their own. However, it can also be moderate or severe. Patients with moderate bleeding will repeatedly pass larger quantities of bright or dark red blood. Most rectal bleeding comes from the colon, rectum, or anus and the color of the blood often depends on the location of the bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract. There are many diseases and conditions that can cause rectal bleeding. Common causes include anal fissures, hemorrhoids, cancers and polyps of the rectum and colon, abnormal blood vessels etc. I hope that you will take my advice and go to doctor.|`|V9LpKPrYaa	I've experienced that one. That's what they called "ALMORANAS" you can avoid that if you drink 8 glasses of water in one day. Then avoid eating junk foods. Eat fruits with an FIBER, such as Pineapple. Or eat Papaya and Banna. Don't abuse yourself, and by the way, when you have ALMORANAS, it can cause COLON CANCER.|`|cQ6UFMmyaa	Go to a doctor, there are thousands of things that could be wrong, and if not treated can be fatal.<br>  <br>  A few common things that they test for are infections of your bladder, gut and colon. At the very least, you are likely to be treated for colitis|`|VN0Wb9WCaa	I agree completely with Bosna Koljem Srbe.|`|diLZQRUNaa	You mean it hurts when you poop?<br>  You should see with a doctor right away. It can be the first sine of a bawl  problem.
9Zsu2JoBaa	More likely than not. It's meant to be used externally and because it's a petroleum based product, once it mixes with water it can become looser and thus stay in your vagina for a while. This is an open invitation for bacteria to develop. Plus if you're using condoms, it can break down the latex and cause potential problems.<br>  <br>  KY jelly might be a better option for you, you can get it anywhere and it's only around $6. It does the job, doesn't irritate (well shouldn't) and doesn't have a thick greasy residue like vaseline does.<br>  <br>  I'd stop using the vas, drink water to flush out the bacteria, maybe use some of those urinary tract sachets that have alkanisers in them and see a doc if it doesn't clear up.|`|emNCaAq7aa	Possible. Vaseline is a petroleum by product and can cause irritation all by itself.<br>  Pick up a tube of KY or the house brand personnel lubricant at any drug store. It is made of water and glycerin works well and does not cause anyone problems.|`|IHDVQs3kaa	Vaseline is purely a lubricant when used during intercourse.  If you are having some discomfort during sex and when urinating, you shoud seek professional advice .
gSo4dR7oaa	The only way for you to get a diagnosis and appropriate treatment is to see a doctor.  It may not be anything serious, but you should not wait 4-5 months before seeing a doctor.
5rJ6nf2oaa	300-500 calories per day??? This is starvation and your body will have already dropped its metabolic rate in order to keep you alive and going.<br>  <br>  Therefore in the beginning, yes, you will probably gain a little by increasing to 1200 (nobody should be eating less than this).<br>  <br>  But your body will soon realise the famine is over and raise metabolism to normal especially if you exercise as well. Then weight gain will stop. <br>  <br>  Eating 1200 cal a day you will lose weight (if you need to) but only if your diet is properly balanced and you are eating the right kind of foods.<br>  <br>  Read the info in the articles attached for an example of a good diet.
AA10561400	could have a prostate problem go to doctors|`|emNCaAq7aa	yep, most men get enlarged prostate as they grow older, it does not clear up by itself and can cause other problems like infections. It is not a big deal and can usually be treated with over the counter supplements or sometimes a drug like proscar.  <br>  He should see a doc for manuel check anyway every 5 years. Real prostate cancer, not likely what your husband has but a minor chance, is more prevalent than breast or any other type of cancer except skin cancer. Early detection and treatment solves the problem.|`|PeE2y9hdaa	Don't worry. First a trip to the doctors for a feel around and a chat. He will probably be sent to the urology department where they will put a camera into his bladder to have a look. They use an anesthetic cream while they put an instrument in to clean out the tubes. It is a common problem, more embarrassing than anything. Apparently he will pee like a teenager when he gets it sorted out. Good luck and don't worry.|`|a6j7Bu9daa	i had the same problem :S, i went to the doctors and was meant to go for a test. I never did go as i had a holiday booked at the same date. I have to go again soon, i was told to do kegal excersies in the mean time to see if it helps. It is a pain because i also dont want it to go thru my jeans etc.<br>  <br>  He shud go to a doctor and he will most likley send him for a "flow rate test". I was told its to do with the tubes when you pee being too narrow etc. There is a medical procedure that can be done but my doc said its best to stray away from that if possible.<br>  <br>  <br>  Im 26 and reading from  the other answers they are saying it could be his prostate, i had mine examined and it was fine, also had blood tests, urine tests came back all normal.|`|AA12129792	This could indicate prostate trouble.  One of the signs is a lot of stopping and starting when urinating.  Could this be what he is having trouble with as he may have stopped without fully emptying his bladder and is then having problems emptying the last bits?|`|EIrdLq6Zaa	Why isn't he squeezing the tip more to get the last drop out? If he has a prostate problem he should be on either Avodart or Proscar to reduce the swelling. He should mention this to his doctor.
UUtTDAJraa	The first thing you need to do is figure out why your sex drive is low and try to help get it back.  I was in your situation and it's not fun without being horny and feeling in the mood when needed.  I also felt like my orgasms (if I would even get one) were really weak.  Probably because of my sex drive.<br>  <br>  However, I tried exercising and dieting but nothing seemed to be working.  I thought I was screwed.  I then found something just as amazing as the vibrator.<br>  <br>  My friend at work told me about this stuff she took to raise her sex drive.  It was a natural herbal supplement and was I lucky to of found it.  Theres no side effects and the sex drive is just tremendous along with orgasms that are blasting.  The stuff is called Hersolution pills.  At the time I saved money on them at herenhancement.com<br>  <br>  What I did was tried out for 3 months and that was really it.  I found taking them every other day or so was the best to stretch it out. After the months were up, I was back to normal with a beating sex drive and my orgasm strength in increased so much.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and I hope this helps.|`|9pLdhuBnaa	Yes, you might get your period sooner by taking out the Nuva Ring earlier.  However, I would recommend checking with your doctor as well to see what they say.
og2zUpa4aa	Yes, definitely its possible to get the braces on the inside aspect of your teeth which will not show off to others. We call it lingual orthodontics. Not too many dentist practices it. Ask your dentist for that. Well, the duration of the treatment varies depending on the cases. So can't be sure about that. And the cost is usually pretty high but again it varies. Good luck.
ry7K0BMAaa	Depression.<br>  Now we won't know if it's mild, moderate or severe until you see a shrink. But before deciding to go visit a doctor, try spending more time with people you're comfortable with. Maybe friends or family. Sometimes we only have feelings we can't express, or hurts and worries we're not aware of or we don't know how to handle. Improving your social life will help you a lot. AND, hey, laugh more. Watch funny shows or movies. It's scientifically proven that laughing does something good in the body, releasing some hormones or something, not sure of what, but it's a fact. Do you believe in God? Pray. Talk to Him. When no one understands you, He does. Be reflective in your present situation. It's just a season, I'm sure. This too shall pass.<br>  <br>  You take care now.|`|XoRkPaa1aa	Ok well at 26, I wouldn't think it would be a hormone imbalance. Depression? Maybe, but it's over rated. If you think medication will help, go to a doctor. But prozac just regulates your seratonin, so your lows aren't so low, but your highs won't be as high. I think that at this age, relationships are important. So you need to improve this area of your life, if it's what you crave. If you have problems with relationships, you usually have problems with yourself. So I would do some soul searching, try to find your confidence. Because you have a life, wether you like it or not, and it's up to you what to do with it. Once you know you like and love yourself, you can attempt to be liked and loved by others, which may seem more difficult than loving yourself. Don't settle for someone because they're there. Know what you want and go for it, guys love this. Also, forming girl friend relationships first is a smart choice, as they are feeling some of the same feelings you are and they can relate. And they actually enjoy talking for the sake of being close, where as guys (biologically) talk to share information or provide advice.|`|Ajjjs3uLaa	You're not alone.<br>  I'm not good at anything either.  I have no life.<br>  Seems like I'm just an observer of other peoples' lives.<br>  <br>  But luckily, we live in a world,where all types of people, have the right to live.  Never forget that.|`|w1iHxDL1aa	hormone imbalance|`|And9dyrwaa	oh first get easy on you.your negative thoughts may lead u to this terrible conditions.if you has any friends which are very closer to you then try to put your feelings and thoughts to him or her,so if you do this then your mind will be free and you will get a hope to live in this world.don't be in alone always,try spend some time on others,attend some meetings or parties,try to get mingle with others,search for a job until you get comfortable with that,that's all i want to give.<br>  it's your life you only have to make a decision.<br>  think twice or thrice to make a right decision.|`|ca2539c525ddc6c1e54324614f643771aa	Honey life is what you make of it.  If you feel like you have no life or a rotten life then that is just what you will be.  Self pity is what it sounds like you are doing to yourself.  Have you turned to a church for some guidance since you feel so worthless?????  Maybe you should it certainly can't hurt and it may give you some feeling of self worth again.  God Bless and Good Luck|`|96b1b355d08c721076e9540b69416845aa	If you ever feel down, worthless, not good at anything, remember that once you were the fastest spermatozoid of the gang!|`|r7uGMC29aa	It's either you're just PMS-ing, it happens to me all the time, once a month.

aHvJcb0uaa	dont worry thats totally natural, they are just blood clots. no need to worry most women have them.|`|g6pqGjrkaa	You have not specified weather the period comes on every or with in a month  or on 28th day. if so you need not worry, if your period is irregular that time of lumps coming has tobe corected withutrine tonics.|`|QRbCnBgFaa	Don't worry, i think you have irregular periods which will soon sort out when your grown.|`|HvbIE03saa	It could be perfectly normal, it might not be. Since this is all new to you, I would suggest asking your Mom or another older female relative what they think. It's always better to be safe than sorry.<br>  <br>  As for it coming out faster when you cough or use your bowel muscles, that IS common. You're contracting your muscles, and your uterus in the middle of it all, so when you squeeze the muscles, you squeeze the uterus, therefore squeezing the blood out.|`|hdO6CNQ1aa	Period blood always flows faster for me when I cough, or use my bowel mucles so dont worry bout that. It could also be that your just irregular, So thats not too worrying either. Also, I get clotts too, Periods tand to clott when they are heavy.<br>  Dont worry, Its all normal :)<br>  <br>  Hope I Helped :)
Y1LTzXataa	Don't just ask. Do something. You can't just expect him to initiate it all the time. Seduce him|`|zNPGaZRHaa	Tell him how you're feeling. Good relationships are built on communication. It will most likely be a pleasant surprise for him.|`|E64juLwJaa	Ever heard of communicating?<br>  Think you both are not good at that.<br>  Sit him down and tell what you expect.<br>  He can react then.<br>  Planets|`|YO1w7gpiaa	Wisdom dictates that you will both lose interest from time to time,<br>  that is where commitment, caring and love will display themselves, and whether this relationship is going to last through the years.   Knowing each other deeply and being able to weather the highs and lows of personal desires, being able to truly relax within the safety of your relationship will come within the context of marriage.  Before that, you're "just playing house".   Hold onto your heart and your body for your lifelong commitment.  That is respect.   Sex is only temporary before that.|`|72iZuDjeaa	whatever,,, at least that's what he's thinking... you must not be very good in the sack dear... most dudes would jump on that...|`|zPwT7VYSaa	just feel him up while watching tv together...that may get him moving|`|zMzuR9SQaa	i'd say just invite him round. and just be all over him. there isn't such thing as a lad not wanting to have sex. so just show him you want sex, dont have to tell him.|`|XUWflgn8aa	it depends on how old you r. you shoul probably settle down, you don't want him to be board of you, so  surprise him sometimes....|`|braAV7lxaa	tell him how you feel...Maybe he is having difficulty in work or college at the moment...Maybe he has lost a friend...Simply he might no longer be into you|`|40Ow9B1maa	oo im still a virgin ;/ so i say if you want it then just kinda wen your making out feel on his thing n i think hell get the hint

ZjhQ6PL8aa	A TIA is not actually a stroke.  To answer the original question yes you can as the side effects of the stroke depends on where the bleed/occlusion is at in the brain.|`|LfjhD9ytaa	Check out TIA attacks. (Google it). These are mini strokes. If you or someone else is having problems, seek immediate medical attention.

That's what they mean by "cracked out". It's that jittery, nervous energy that occurs when your nervous system is overstimulated. Caffeine is a stimulant. For appetite suppression, there is a great product called "Hoodia" that is natural from an African plant. Proper use of caffeine in a fat loss program is to take 100mg. first thing in the morning, and 100mg. right before your workout. Do not take more than that or you may suffer the "cracked out" feeling.|`|cuFePknIaa	<a href="http://guideforu.kaohsiung.tv" rel="nofollow">http://guideforu.kaohsiung.tv</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website

I certainly would go...or see another GP to get a serious opinion from another doctor who takes a genuine interest in your health.|`|braAV7lxaa	did you like in the yellow page and look for an endocrinologist number and call them...Also ask they is it covered by the NHS|`|3gPLONagaa	Visit a doctor and ask for a referral to the specialist
jS6Qkj0faa	ok for starters its physically impossible to hold your breath long enough to kill yourself. when your brain doesnt get enough oxygen it becomes hypoxic (hypo= low, oxic= oxygen). so you pass out- when you pass out your brain takes over and you breathe properly. one of the early signs of hypoxia is sleepiness so what you are in fact doing is making your brain hypoxic and making yourself tired. Brain damage generally happens after about minutes of absolutely no oxygen. so no it shouldnt damage your brain however i would be looking into why you couldnt sleep- is it stress or too much caffeine/stimulants? is your bedroom dark and comfy and are you warm/ cool enough?|`|gtr3CGU5aa	I hold my breath for as long a time as possible to keep from having a panic attack........ it seems to GET oxygen to the brain.  And when I took singing lessons, my teacher told me yawning is just your body or whatever relaxing itself.  Check out Greer Childers Body Flex breathing technique.......... you hold your breath as long as you can and it gets you in the aerobic state within seconds.......... she says "oxygen to the brain'!  <br>  And I've heard advice from doctors about children who hold their breath until they pass out and the doctor says it does no harm - once passed, out the child will resume breathing normally.<br>  But if you're concerned about it, just take long deep beaths until you fall asleep - I knowvit's helped me before and I have insomnia.

If you get a "false" positive because of it, request a 2nd test.|`|7oF2o4q5aa	If it's a diet pill and you can show that you have a prescription you should be fine but you should have shown that to them before you did the test.|`|biknsMtGaa	Maybe its better if you read some testimonials from the customers first. Try www.bestdietpillreviews.org|`|F1VXXMrOaa	If it is a legal diet pill, there is nothing they can do to fire you over that. Diet pills don't work in the long term. Only a healthy diet and exercise will do it. I know it must be difficult for you since you are on the road a lot. If you can walk briskly for 15 minutes a day it will benefit you greatly.
w8oe19udaa	what do you mean infects? 'cause if it's just a lil red then it's prolly just irritated and will feel better after you get some sleep by your boo ;) try rubbing some skin cream on it. if it's actually infected you should get help for it. i dunno tho my belly feels fine every time my bf and i have sex :]|`|9xpFsVJSaa	All I can say is you need to make sure you and your boyfriend are both clean when you do it.

xCizCIVjaa	i was on those insulins and my bsl was all over the place. perhaps your "equation" needs fine tuning. and carb counting a little closer. (as in size, not how many u have)   i'm not sure about the dieing or coma bit but its definately not healthy. not doing your liver etc any good. you need to talk to your parents...or even better your diabetes educator.  after ages i managed to get onto the insulin pump. its so good. perhaps that could be another goal for u (http://www.medtronic.com/your-health/dia...  in the mean time drink water and watch what u eat. snack on free food.|`|apXIw0ZJaa	You mention nothing about your taking insulin? Are you taking the correct doesage that your doctor gave you? You NEED to talk to your parents right now. And then you need to go see your doctor. Something is not right and needs to be taken care of. Only God knows when you are going to die. NO ONE here can tell you how long you have to live. I know that if you take care of  yourself then you can live just as long as a non-diabetic. You need to get your sugars under control. Good Luck! I will be praying for you! Talk to your parents!|`|k1zMsWxOaa	Increase your insulin dosage NOW. Yes this is causing problems with your body. as you have some insulin you probably are not going to die just yet.   you could be sick, or your insulin could be off, get a fresh perscription and keep it in the fridge.   up your lantus dose a lot, and increase your fast acting insulin carefully, then take extra blood readings and do extra injections as needed  also see an endocrinologist quickly, don't bother with a GP|`|BaxwbIk8aa	I have type one diabetes too, so I know what you're talking about. You need to take a correction for your high blood sugar, drink lots of water or at least diet soda for the ketones, and if things don't get better quickly, you need to visit your endocrinologist or diabetes educator.    You could possibly go into a coma if your blood sugar keeps going up, not to scare you, but that's just motivation to try to get things under control. Don't worry so much, just keep a close eye on your blood sugar. You will have complications if you don't get your blood sugar under control, but don't worry about that just yet. The immediate danger is now.|`|AA11235389	My son is type 1 ... You have an infection somewhere ... you need to get to the Dr and have some blood work done do you have any bumps or knots that hurt?

Let mom and dad know your sugars if they dont already and get a dr app set up soon or just go to your ER ... That may be better so they can get your sugars down if you have to wait more then 2 days to see your Dr|`|1wFMGizXaa	I'm not as knowledgeable about insulin as I should be, but you can correct for high blood sugar with fast-acting insulin, can you not? If you can't figure out the ratio on your own, then ask your parents to take you to the emergency room. You'll be given insulin there to bring down your numbers into a more normal range quickly. If your insulin doesn't work for you sometimes, then either you need a dosage increase, insulin change or you need to be taught what you're doing wrong by a doctor or qualified diabetes care worker. So, I beg of you, please tell your parents right now that you have ketones and that your blood sugar is really high and that you can't figure out how to fix this problem on your own.
