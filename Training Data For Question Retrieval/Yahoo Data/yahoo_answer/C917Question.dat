20090308091507AA4oAfI	Business & Finance;Other - Business & Finance	1. Draw up a table of the fixed costs for this flight, and hence find the total fixed cost for the flight.?	The budget airline, FastJet, runs a fleet of Boebus 937 aircraft, each of which has 150 seats. The Boebus 937 cost ￡10M when new, a cost that is depreciated over 20 years. Finance costs are taken at 8% pa of original capital cost. A typical aircraft performs two thousand 2-hour flights per year.   FastJet makes 2000 flights annually between Stanrow and Nice on this route, outward and return. Each flight takes 2 hours. The airport charge per passenger is ￡5.50 at either end. The annual salary cost of the crew for this route is ￡800,000. Fuel costs ￡350 per flying hour. The annual maintenance cost for this route is ￡900,000. Ground handling (check-in, baggage handling and refuelling work) are bought from AeroServe at a cost of ￡500 per flight. Air traffic control costs for take-off, over-flight and landing come to ￡440 per flight.   Advertising and administration costs are charged equally to all the 50 routes covered by FastJet. FastJet's advertising budget is ￡20M per year, while administration comes to ￡90M per year.   Booking is solely via the Internet using a credit card. The average price of a ticket for the Nice flight is ￡45. A 2% credit-card charge is incurred by FastJet on each booking.   Consider a single flight from Stanrow to Nice.   1. Draw up a table of the fixed costs for this flight, and hence find the total fixed cost for the flight.   2.Draw up a table of the variable costs for this flight, and hence find the total variable cost.   3. Draw a graph of the break-even number of passengers against ticket price for the range ￡30 to ￡60 pounds. Mark on your graph the area where a profit will be made and the area where a loss will be made. What level of seat occupancy is needed to avoid a loss at an average ticket price of ￡45?

I know the meaning of securities come from bonds, where people can invest x quantity of money and have a 3,5% profit in 1,2,3 years etc, so that is why its called and investmentt that scuritized because there is no risk or there is minimum risk. but what about equities? or fx? there is always a risk, you never know if the price is going to go up or down, and also some percentage of the investment can be lost.... is not like with bonds, derivatives, quants where the risk is much more less....

We went to the attorney and gave him all of our financial information. We were over 50k in unsecured debt. He told us he could get our monthly payments down to four to five hundred a month. We found this hard to believe but he said this is what he does for a living and to trust him. Two more times during this process he told us the same thing. He also told us to stop paying all of the unsecured creditors. Now we owe 20 more thousand and the lady e-mailing us who is filing the paperwork on what we will pay says it will be $1,000 a month. During the process we also had to give the same information several times, I guess they lost it. He also did not tell us that Ford Credit could stop taking out automatic payments on the car that we were keeping. We found out that they had not taken out two payments and had to make them at once. Then he was insulted when we told him that was not right. He also never informed when he filed for us and we just received paperwork from the court saying a lot of the required paperwork was not filed. He was not happy we called him about that and said he told us the court would do things like that and not to worry about it. We are at a loss of what to do now. Do we stop the process and try something else, sue him, pay him for what he has done and try another attorney, work with the creditors ourselves, go credit consolidation? Help? We feel he has not been honest or professional.

If you go to a Regal cinema or likely any other cinema you get this weird "ad" before the movie. It asks you to turn off your cell phone but the way it's made up with the relaxing music, monotone voice and what appears to be a voice that you can't quite make out in the background I think it's subliminal hypnosis. Has anyone else noticed this? Seeing that I hate being manipulated I now leave my phone on during the show.

I just turned 16 this year, and there are quite a few things I want to buy (including a cosplay costume, I just want to see what THOSE kids think when I go to church dressed as Sora from Kingdom Hearts, wig and all!!)   So this Summer, I'm looking for a job for the Summer months. I'm hoping to get over $250 before October, because I'm going to be using the money I get a cosplay costume...I can't sew, so I'll just have to BUY all the different things, and the costume costs about 100-110 bucks, the wig, 50 bucks (which includes shipping) and the keyblade costs about 30 bucks. And that's just if I'm lucky and can manage to find these good deals @_@  (the job can not be a life-guard or baby-sitter, because I'm not good at baby-sitting and I hate swimming.)      So anyway, I live in North Carolina and could probably start a job now during the week (not on Fridays or on Tuesday mornings or Thursday afternoons cause I"m busy then) but I'm home-schooled, so I'm willing to get a job anywhere (if I don't have to work until after 11 on Saturdays that'd also be great)

There is really anything else we can do.. there is no managing money because all of the money goes directly to bills.. there is nothing we can sell to gain money for all our debt.. it just seems like its getting worse and worse and we thought about bankruptcy. Yes, I agree it's a horrible thing and it stays on your credit for 10 years YES THAT IS RIDICULOUS bad.. but really what is there else to do.. the interest rates on the credit cards are so high that because of 1 month not paying the minimum  jumped up 700.00 so i don't even want to check what it is now!! We don't have much options besides that.      If we decide to do it how will it effect his current job? Does his current job have to know we filed bankruptcy?   How would it effect our car loan?   How would it effect us paying RENT to our landlords..      Thanks a lot of the help in advanced                =/ ohhhhhh

Hi there, you know when you just know you need a change and feel like life isn't going in the right direction. I keep waiting for this flash of inspiration that will be the answer i am looking for.   I need a new career and wondered what my options are.   I will have to be quick as i need to get ready for work... i am a singer, in pubs and clubs, and have been for ten years, and i really want to quit now. It has served me well but i have never really loved doing it. The main benifit has been that I don't have to work through the week, just weekends and sometimes i do week nights. But ten yrs on, it has a detrimental effect on my relationships with my partner and friends. It is costly for me to take a night off to go out as I don't get paid, and my partner is off work when i am at work.So anyway i want to stop doing it. I am a fully qualified teacher, and i did teach full time for a year and then i left ( i am not a quitter by nature, i gave it my all, and more but was going through a year of bereavement during my first year of teaching, so i think i did well to do it) but i realised life is too short to be working 24/7 which it was. I also have a drama Degree and i have art and design qualifications and am very artistic. I love gardening, i like working with children, i like working with people in a creative environment. I like thinking up ideas, I am energetic and bubbly, and oh I also have a little face painting business, i love doingit, but again it is anti-social (mostly weekend work) I would like to be my own boss and am currently working on developing art and drama workshops for schools, but how would i make money during the holidays? oh i don't know what i should be doing. i am 32 and thought by now i'd have a fantastic career and i haven't. I've done a lot and am intelligent and able, but i just feel like a bit of a faliure...    Any advice would be really appreciated.    thank you ( sorry for the long long message!)

My question is what figures do I use to arrive at the risk free rate? I've gone to the U.S. treasury website to find rates, but there are different types and I'm not sure which one's to use.

Hello, I live in Arizona and I do not have an Accountant/CPA working with me at all.  Recently I bought a franchise with Vanguard and manage a cleaning company that goes around cleaning offices form contracts offered by Vanguard as part of the deal.  I am paid once a month based on the contracts completed and when I am paid Vanguard does not take taxes out.  What taxes am I liable for, who do I pay it to and where do I find the forms associated with it?  I am very unfamiliar with the tax system and would appreciate any help.      Thank you

It was not an educational fund it was a (UTMA) from his grandmother that we cashed out last year.  We thought he'd be enrolled in school, but is not and I guess it's not seen as educational anyway.  We'll lead him to believe it is strictly for that though, even though it is completely in his name.

The other card's APR has risen to a whopping (and unacceptable 27.24%). I asked for a lower %, they wouldn't budge, so I told them I'd transfer the balance elsewhere.       What is the best way to find a card to transfer this balance to? Do I have to look for special offers? Will this affect my credit in any way if I close the one account after transferring the money to another?       Thanks.

So I am going to be going to school for Physical Therapist Assistance and I wanted to learn sign language since I was little. I've known people when I was younger that needed signing. So I was wondering how often do you really use sign language? I thought it would be something really good for me but people keep telling me and asking me "how many times are you going to need signing as a PTA"? So  was wondering how much do you use signing as a PT and/or PTA? Thanks everyone for your time!

What is considered?

When making an offer, especially if someone else is making it, is there a rule of thumb? Say for example, I will offer you 20% or 10% less than the asking price?
