20090223112926AAm1SqX	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How can I put him in my past and move on?	I had been dating this guy for the past 2 and a half months and decided to end it. During that time we got pretty close. My reasoning for ending it is that I wasn't sure that it was the right time for us to be having any kind of dating relationship. He told me from the beginning that he is going through a divorce and is trying to uphold his business. Both of which were putting him under a lot of stress and that he's not ready to be emotionally involved. I became concerned when we were sleeping in the same bed together almost every night and nothing physical was happening and I never felt like he wanted to be affectionate. The other problem is that while I was contemplating ending things I went out with another guy for dinner, nothing happened but I figured it would be a way for me to see what else is out there before I decided anything. I never told him about this but did mention the next day that I wanted to keep things open to see other people. During our breakup conversation I slipped and told him about the other guy. He was livid!! He said he is upset that I didn't tell him before I went out with the other guy but after. Since then we have been fighting and he doesn't want to even talk about it! I apologized to him in an email and he txted back saying he accepted it but to not bring it up again. I am really regretting that I did this. Now that almost 3 weeks have passed since this I feel like if I had never gone out with that guy and had been more patient things could have worked. I told him I made a mistake but I don't know if he will forgive me. Do I stand a chance here? If so how should I go about this ?? He hasnt called or anything since last week.I txted again a few days ago apologizing but no response. I dont know if he'll ever want to talk to me again. I really just feel like I screwed this up. I'm finding it hard to get motivated to move on again. What can I do to forget this and move on?

20090223112916AAoWyue	Family & Relationships;Friends	I have a bully..How do I deal with her without being a tattle-tail?	There is this girl in my English class, her name is Jessa, and nobody in the whole school likes her except another girl Tanya. Jessa calls everyone names, shoves people in the hallway, teases people about their looks, and puts people below her in the "food chain." She is just a mean girl overall. She thinks she is popular, not really, people just pretend to be her friend. She was putting a piece of a bag on my toe one day (don't ask why, i don't even know) and she saw a tiny little planters wart, its gone now! Jessa screams in the gym "EW! Fungus foot!!" I turned bright red and people started laughing at me, except my friend Delzie. Another time, I was talking with a bunch of my friends and we were talking about a guy that I used to like, Josh. Then, Jessa came over and joined in the conversation. Then she heard Josh's name. And of course, right then, he walks into the gym. Jessa hops up and walks over to him. She asked him out for me!! I didn't say anything about going out with him or anything! I was so mad! I hid my face, he kept looking over at me. Jessa came back over and told me that he said "Yes!" I didn't believe her so, i got two of my friends, Jessica and Lara,  to ask him what happened. They did and came back over. They said that he turned me down but said that I'm cute! I was happy with the cute thing. But I was really mad at Jessa. She laughed at me, and shoved me off of the gym bleachers. I was even more mad and embarressed. So, these are only two of the many things that Jessa has done to me. I want to do somthing to get her to stop, but I don't want Tattle-Tail added to my list of names that she has for me. Help please!!

Neither me nor my fiance are religious or belong to a church. But I would really like to get married in a church because its traditional. I would do it in a chapel but there's none near us that are big enough. Can I have a church ceremony that is simple and basic without a lot of preaching? We basically just want to get down the aisle and say our "I do's" and be done. What type of church would I look for? Any tips or suggestions would be so helpful. Thank you.

20090223113345AAQeqW1	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My husband wants to move again?	He got a very good job offer in a town about an hour's drive away. We moved away from that very same city 5 years ago, and now he just wants to go back. Since we've started living together (9 including the five we've been married), we've moved 3 times. The last two times weren't needed, he just wanted to move.      In the past it didn't bother me - I enjoyed moving to new houses and new towns, but now we have a child and I crave stability. I lived in the same house until I moved in with him - as a child his parents moved around a lot, so I can obviously see where his restlessness came from.      Anyway, there's no reason for us to move. The city's only an hour away, so he can commute - but he's adamant he wants to move. I've made a life here now... I have good friends, my family's close-by, I have dance classes, I found my son an awesome preschool (he's already enrolled), and now he wants to move again.      He says if I don't want to move, then he'll get a bachelor's flat over there, and come home on weekends. I don't like that idea either. We need a compromise, I can't keep going back and forth like this. My child also deserves something more stable.      I need to communicate all this to him, without upsetting him or making him feel like I don't support him. I have done for 9 years, and I'm a little tired of being uprooted every time. I have no one left in the city, so it's going to be lonely and I'll have to start all over again.

That he wanted to show me that not all guys are going to screw me then leave me! That it would be ok for me to let him in my heart cause he would never break it. ok i do love this guy, but i'm not sure how i love him now... i mean he was there for me when i got raped, when my mom kicked me out, when well everything fell apart and i believe after all that he deserves a chance but i no everything about him...i just well i'll put it this way we've NEVER done ANYTHING sexual or even close to it. i just don't want things to be different between us i mean i'd love to date him cause he is a really great guy...but it just seems like it would be wired? so what should i do??
20090223113636AADKGmD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What would you do if you were not invited on this trip?	My boyfriend and I got back together about a month ago after being broken up for about 6 months.  He had cheated on me at the end of our relationship, but swears that he is faithful now.  I don't have reason to doubt him as he has been great since we got back together.        Now, comes something I am concerned about.  He is going on a business related cruise.  He had the option of taking someone, but he chose not to stating that the price was too high.  I just found out from someone else that the price he told me was not true and that it was very affordable for me to go.  Since the trip is a cruise, I am questioning his motives.  He says that he is telling the truth about the price and that is what he was told.  I said that I would pay the fee that I found out about myself, but he said that he still didn't want me to go stating that he would be in meetings all day.  I am now wondering what he is hiding, such as maybe he is taking someone else or maybe wants to play around on the cruise.  What is your opinion?  I am wondering if maybe I am just overreating, but since I was cheated on before, I am concerned about it happening again.

My cousin (male 21) has been staying over my house while in college since last year. hes real quiet and shy and never goes out. last weekend as I woke up i felt something at my feet and it was him caressing my feet and also I felt something wet possibly his tongue or his ****. i just stayed still pretending to be asleep i was freaked out but at the same time it just felt sooo good but i know its wrong.  i dont know what to do should i tell him or just ignore it and let him have his fun? i guess this explains why some of my heels are missing sometimes or have stains. if i tell him he would be devistated since hes really shy and inexperienced with girls.

20090223114639AAhBCP5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What can I do to sort this out?	My Fiance and I have been together nearly 3 years and were supposed to be getting married on April 3rd of this year. However, his parents called it off saying we were stupid to even think about it.      Today we had a huge argument and it turned physical. He grabbed my wrists and threw me onto the bed. Trouble is, when he threw me over, i put my arm out to grab hold of something and ended up slapping him. So now he thinks I threw the 1st punch.       He's told me he doesn't want me in the flat when he gets home from work and has given me his engagement rings back. What can i do? I'm worried that if I'm in the flat when he gets home, he'll blow up again, but i need to talk and sort this out. I don't want to loose him and will do anything to get him back. But I don't know what to do.      Another thing is that in the past week or so, he has really changed. His temper has gotten much shorter and he goes out a lot more. I was in my friends flat when he went to work and I saw him lighting a cigarette. He never smokes and he knows I dont like it because my nan died from lung cancer not that long ago.       I just don't know what to do! How can i sort this out???

20090223114426AADgZHx	Family & Relationships;Family	I dont know what to do with my 8 year old daughter?	my daughter is 8 years old, very cute and smart, however, she acts as if she is out of this world, some times to do a simple dictation it takes her 3 hours to spell 10 words and memorize them, in other times it takes her 3 minutes to do 10 words.      It doesn’t stop here, she is always having fights with her brother 11 years old and she is constantly annoying her younger sister 3 years old, we talk to her , we take her out, we even did a reward program for good behavior, nothing is working.   she only quits when we start to yell at her and gets back to her behaviors 10 minutes after, I am against hitting and don’t believe its the way to raise a child, i am feeling helpless with my daughter especially that she is very nervous and shouts at the smallest things.      her grades are dropping from A+ to B       Please help me with any ideas on this subject

20090223114444AAamnUa	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is my online friend safe?	I met a two teen-aged guys online through a game. The first ones name is Daniel. He is my older brother's friend, and soon became my friend. He told us everything - last name, his age, birthday, how he was homeschooled, how he doesn't want to give his phone number out (for so many reasons), he told us about his friends, and he even showed us a picture of him through msn messenger. He seems like a normal teenager, he doesn't seem "perfect" or "made up". My mom even talked to him before.      The second guy is Ryan. He was my older brother's friend, until he met me. Then he started talking to me and not my brother. He already knew our names because of  my brother. So I decided to be safe and ask his last name. He never told me. He said he doesn't like his last name and that he isn't allowed to say it. Later on he messages me on msn. We talk for months about that game that we met on. He then tells me my phone number and address. I ask him how he got it and he says he found it on his msn "call" device. He calls me a little bit later and my caller ID says he is from New Hampshire, where he said he was from before. I answer it and we talk for a few minutes. He sounded like he was 20 years old or so, when he said he was 15. It made me wonder and it got me scared. I told him my mom was home, and I had to get off the phone because I was grounded. It wasn't true, it was an excuse to get off the phone 'cause he was scaring me. Now, everytime I log onto msn messenger, he talks about wanting to call me. I tell him not to, as to I'll get in trouble. Then, this morning (2-23-09) I search on how to know if my online friend is real. After all of that searching, I found some questions to ask. I asked him why he was always so secretive about his last name and why he never tells me anything. He just used the excuse he used before: I don't like my last name. That's when I started to egnore him a little bit. He then got mad at me and asked me what's going on. I told him I'm just curious. He said: well if that's the way it is, then I'll just talk to Jason (my brother). Then he said: thanks for the trust. And: Hope you're happy. Then he logged off.      Ryan seems nothing like Daniel (which I trust). And Ryan is scaring me. What should I do? Is he safe?       Thanks for the help!

He like to rip my clothes off litterally.  Sometimes I think its sexy but I've had to buy like 10 news bras & bottoms in the last few months.  I don't want to ask him to stop because I know he likes it.  What should I do?
20090223114655AAiNLH0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My friends told me to leave him a long time ago... (mature)?	First of all, my boyfriend is thousands of miles away from me... It has been two months since he left for deployment.      Four months ago my boyfriend and i went on a little trip and we got into a stupid argument and I ended up getting out of the car and I took a walk just to get away from the tension. He drove around to find me and when he did, he grabbed me by the arm to the car and he drove dangerously, he didn't care about the pedestrians who were about to cross the street, and he was driving fast in the parking lot. When he stopped the car, i took the keys from him and he tried to take it back from me by tightening his grip on my wrists and when i didn't give up, he grabbed me by my jaw and tried to squeeze it so i finally gave the keys back. of course i started crying my eyes out and we got out of the car and he hugged me. After that, i felt emotionally traumatized but i still loved him very much.      Two days later, we got into a huge fight. Then he told me he didn't love me and that he never did, so I slapped him and since I had long nails, I left a scratch on his face. When we were continuously shouting at each other he pinned me on the ground and yelled in my face. He had a grip on my arms and he left me bruises on my left arm when he shook me on the ground. We broke up that day.      Then I didn't talk to him for 2 weeks until one day he called me sobbing and saying that he loved me and he regret everything that he did. He could not stand the fact that I was free to date whoever I want... Since I'm an idiot, I took him back and held onto his word that he is going to try to change.      My boyfriend had a bad childhood... I really don't want to post what he went through here, but it's not something a normal pre-schooler should have to go through. Things have gone better for us for the past two months but I can't help but wonder sometimes if I made the right decision to stay with someone who had physically hurt me. I'm trying to understand him and see if he really could change. He had been sending me a lot of flowers lately and he gets paranoid that I would leave him whenever I don't message him back.       If you were me, what would you do? I need advice. I'm not ugly at all, in the months we were dating, I had guys trying to do things for me so I would like them... But I kept rejecting them for the asshole of a boyfriend that I have. Help me, I think I'm in the Rihanna-Chris situation.

20090223115127AAH0ldb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Religion in Relationships?	My boyfriend is Christian and I am not religious. We have been getting very close (not sexually, emotionally) and things were going great. We were planning on moving in together and talking about marriage. Then he went away for a few days and when he came back he said that God had told him to slow things down so we should hold off on the moving in. I asked what had changed and he said that "fleshly needs" were no longer a big part of his life b/c he had removed all his sins. I told him I didn't know that that's all I was. He said nooo, I'm not just a fleshly sin but he's too tired to talk about it. We haven't broken up or anything but I just don't get it. Everything was going great and now we talk much less and things seem awkward. It's not like I was pressuring him to do things sexually I said I was fine without stuff like that. What's his problem? And maybe it's b/c I'm not religious, but I think that the reason he wants to slow things down isn t just b/c God "told him".

I talked to him a couple of times when i got my medication filled there. Well I went to the bar on saturday and i saw him there. We met and hit it off. Well we were both real drunk and made out at the end of the night.  I got his number and called him when i got home. We talked for a bit and then he was texting me for alittle after. the next day  He was texting me all for alittle and then i told him to give me a call later that night if he wanted to. He text me back "k..." Well he never called last night. :( what's up with that. You think he'll call me?  I got a little crush on him. I don't' want to call him cause that's just being a little forward, i'd feel like a fool ( chasing him). I'm not that kind of girl.

20090223115727AAUDsKG	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Need a mans opinon on sex...or lack of.?	I've been dating this guy for about 3 months now. We were best friends for about 8 years. Now that we're together things are a little shaky. We never had the "honeymoon" period, which makes sense since we've known eachother for so long, but it seems like he never wants to have sex. The first time was incredibly awkward and anything that could go wrong  did. Now the sex is great for the most part, but he never wants to have it.I have a very high sex drive and I know he did. I've had to endure 8 years of listening to who,where,when and how often with everyone else. He was quite promiscuous and even in past relationships always wanted sex. They would do it 2-3 times daily. I'm lucky if I get once a week. I've tried initiating it when I know he's most in the mood even though I hate morning sex. I've tried pawing at him throughout the day and night and he just moves away from me. At night he always has the excuse that he's tired. He is a hard worker so I started going to bed when he went even though I wasn't tired yet, or invite him to bed before he's ready to go to sleep. I lay there waiting for him to come to bed and he just plays on the computer for a while and then comes to bed when he's exhasted. I've talked to him about it and he acknowledges there's a problem and says he doesn't know why he doesn't want to. I mean, I'm not an unattractive girl (granted his last girlfriend was a model) but I can't help but feel that it's the way I look, caus I'm a stupid girl and that's always our first conclusion. He doesn't seem like he wants the relationship to end. He's very affetionate during the day with general touching/kissing/hugging. So what the hell is wrong?

Im so worried help!!?	today I was in school  in my 7th period studyhall and I had to use the restroom.well anyway I went to the restroom and before I left I was about ready to wash my hands my friend lacole comes in.   I said hi to her and asked her why she was in here.   I asked her if she had to use the restroom.   and she said no and smiled.   and then she told me she was in the restroom so she can lock all the restroom stalls as a prank   then she went on the floor and went into each stall and locked it.   I didnt lock any stalls but I was just standing there laughing.   then me and her left the restroom. when I went to my 8th period class my science teacher got a note from the office worker saying that no one cant use the girls restroom because someone locked the restroom stalls.   When I first found out about that then I started to worry because lacole had locked the restroom stalls,but I didnt do anything and Im afraid that me and her are going to get in trouble.   then on the annoncements the principle said in the morning all 7th and 8th grade girls have to go in the cafeteria and have a talk about the restroom issue.   Im so worried that me and lacole are going to get in trouble,well she was the one that locked the stalls not me.   and theres cameras in front of the enterance of the restroom door.   Im so afaid the principal is going to find out it was me and lacole and me and her get in trouble for it when I didnt even lock the stalls.   Im so worried about tomorrow,I dont know what to do?   I was thinking about skipping school but then my parents wouldnt beleive Im sick.

20090223072052AAGfBYF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My boyfriend is not as into sex as I am?	Background: he hasn't had many relationships and the two he had ended badly with him being hurt. I know he doesn't like kissing because he has fake teeth. We have only had sex after drinking a handful of times. We have already told each other we are in love. He tells me I am beautiful all of the time and has taken me to meet his parents. He has told me though that he is not ready for kids until a couple years. This is really the man I feel like I want to marry, but the sex is not as satisfying as I hope for it to be. I feel that we should be having more and I want him to try oral sex (maybe he doesn't want to because of his teeth?). I am thinking he is not as comfortable having sex as I am, and I want to make him comfortable without acting like I have so much more experience. Thoughts?

20090223120846AAZFw81	Family & Relationships;Family	Spring break idea for Young moms (or MILFs in general)..?	I'm a college student who lives about an hour from Panama City beach (in Florida). Clearly, Spring Break is on the horizon.      My idea is to host  a MILF Bikini Contest.      The purpose of the contest would be to show that (a) just because women become MOMS doesn't mean they have to lose their hotness.........and (b) it would give moms a chance to participate in some spring break activities again, and prove that they can still hang with the youngsters effectively!      I also think it would be a great opportunity for those moms who never got to experience spring break before, due to being too busy with school.....having kids really young...or whatever the case may have been in college.      Thoughts?

I have a collection of some cool things   like my glow in the dark watch which I think is pretty cool   my badge which my little 5 year old cousin gave me- well its cool to me at least and means a lot to me   i got a lot more but thats a few items
20090222221132AABdJKh	Family & Relationships;Family	My daughter has an odd obsession with Nazis?	My 14 year old daughter has an obsession reading about the Nazis and and the Third Reich, she actually said she would have liked to have been a Nazi, and for some strange reason seems to be in awe with them. We are actually Jewish though and are religious Jews, so I'm not sure why she's been acting like this. She's recently been saying that she needs to get a nose job and dye her hair so she can look more "Aryan", I don't know why she thinks like this but I think some people at her school have said some bad things about Jews to her in the past.  What should I do about her and the way she's been thinking lately?
20090223011914AAfLnPA	Family & Relationships;Family	Girls are you taller than your father?	Recently I noticed that I'm taller than my father ('m 16 and he's 41). He didn't believe it so my mom measured us and I'm like 1 inch taller barefoot. I was already clearly taller in heels and I know he finds it annoying even if he doesn't say anything. I can see it in his face lol!      Are you taller than your father? And if so does he care?
20090223071559AANqXhQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Are we friends or a little more than that? everyone please?	Wow this is a long story but answer if you can and don't be rude please.      Ok so this girl I've been friends with for the last 10 years and myself have been a lil more than friends, if you know what I mean. We both agreed to seeing each other discreetly. She was going through the divorce and I was separated at the time and now getting divorced myself.    Ok so we went out as friends a couple of times at first, drinks, movies, whatever. When we went to do the deed the first time, I had a problem down there. I couldn't perform as I should. lol I know. Don't judge me. Idk what happened. Anyway, we stopped talking for a month and started talking again. We finally went out again after three months of the "incident", that was this weekend. We went for drinks, and for coffee at the end. When we were talking, she was telling me that she had been going out with friends. She kept talking about this one guy and how nice he treats her. He takes her out a lot and buys her things, like a Prada bag, cell phone and some perfumes, people we are not talking about cheap things here. Anyway, they go out by themselves and with other co-workers. I told her that if he was her beau, I would understand and go on about my business. I kind of told her that guys like that don't come around that often and she should think about that. I've always been a good friend to her, she would come to me for advice back in the day. She still said they were just friends, well are they? She talked a lot about him. Later that night, when we went back to her house, she didn't even want to kiss me. I asked her if what happened last time was a mistake and she said it wasn't. She texted me after I went home and told me she wanted to do it again and we should do that more often. What does that mean, what is going on? I'm a confused. she understand me and I do her but now things are weird, and I don't know what is going on.

20090223070920AAdO0TO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ladies: Are these women showing attraction.... or.....?	I really don’t know what to assume on this: I was at a store. From a distance, about 50-100 feet, I spotted 3 women walking my way. At first, there was eye contact but nothing serious. Then as we were about to walk pass each other (5-10 ft)….I saw two of them initiating eye contact. I looked at them and smiled a bit but then they went on about their business.       Another woman (with her husband) did the same thing but as we were passing each other, she maintained eye contact for longer than 2-3 seconds. I smiled back. Again, nothing serious.       Finally as I was about to leave a store, another woman looked my way, I looked back, she held eye contact for 2 seconds… then blinked once and looked to her left.       Any clues to what these women were thinking? Should I assume anything positive or negative. Also, not to sound conceited but I have received compliments from other women (but NOT these women). Thoughts?

20090223064852AAEztaq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	GUYS PLEASE HELP! I know it's long :)?	The guy I've been dating did a few small things that upset me this weekend when he met my mother. I didn't say anything until he asked me if I was angry with him yesterday, so I confessed that "I wasn't his biggest fan today."       He begged to know why and I told him I didn't want to talk about it over texting and that I would tell him when he came over Monday (today.)       This morning, he called and again wanted to know. I told him I was on my way to work and I would again tell him when he came over. He was texting me very upset and asking if it was important and I kept assuring him it wasn't a big deal, just something I wanted to say. He wouldn't drop it, so I finally told him. It's been an hour, and he has yet to text me back.      Granted, he just got into work, so he might be busy. But do you think he might be ignoring me on purpose because I upset him? I didn't think what I said was all that bad.       If you need to know the story, he was supposed to come over Saturday to hang out with my mother and sister, who he hadn't met yet (my sister). We made plans the night before, and then 7 pm Saturday night, only after I asked, did he say he wasn't coming. Obviously, after telling my mother and sister all day that he was coming, I felt incredibly stupid. I told him that I felt kinda stupid in front of my family when he didn't let me know until last minute he wasn't coming.      FYI, meeting my family was entirely his idea and he kept insisting - adding to my disappointment when he didn't show. And I'm almost positive it's simply because he made other plans, not because he couldn't.      I kinda see that I made it into a bigger deal just by waiting it out, I'm just always sick of talking about serious things over texts, it seems so immature and a way of avoiding things.

20090223072503AAbF0xb	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Get married without her parents approval?	My girl and I love eachother and we are both 20 years old..sd have gone through quite a bit together and want to get married...both of our parents dont agree with it though because they feel she isnt ready and she's too young.. my parents dont like it either but dont feel as strong about it as hers..heres the issue: we broke up recently but still want it to work. Her parents threatened that if she wanted to be with me after that, then they will kick her out of the house. We agreed that we will give it some time and if necessary, will get married without our parents approval, which would mean that she would leave California to Arizona to be with me after we go get married...We really want this regardless of approval or not..need advice.
20090223072730AA7KXBR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please help me with this situation, its such a turn-off (non-sexual!)?	I have asked a few questions on here before about this, and I would really like some more views. My partner is extremely mean when it comes to money. I've seen it almost from the beginning, but chose to ignore it because we got along so well. I come from a generous family, we are by no means millionaires, but the money we do have, we have no problem sharing/treating our loved ones, etc. I have always thought that my partner saw this as a gain for him, which makes me so angry, as he would never be so eager to put his hand in his pocket for anyone. Its such a turn-off.  We've been together two years, and I've discussed this with a few close friends who have told me that although he will probably never change, if I'm happy with him thats all that matters. We are happy in a lot of ways, but sometimes I feel such anger and resentment towards him when I see what he is capable of doing to save a penny here and there. To me, theres being thrifty (which can be good) or just being plain cheapskate (which is what he is). Part of me wants to end it for this reason alone. The other part of me wants to keep it going because there are so many other good things about our relationship. I'm so torn about what to do. Any advice?

20090223054647AA72od6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does an ex realize he is following you around?	My ex boyfriend of many years has been driving by my apartments and jobs (there have been a few of both) over the last couple years and driving to match my schedule and leaning over to look at me.      Not enough for me to be scared but enough for me to notice. And enough not to be coincidental although it would be easier to think so. He knows that I know he does this. I ignore and then try to talk to him about it - which he denies. He has a new family.      Does he realize he is doing this?

20090223001722AAPd4oB	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is this weird? what does it mean?	i've been dating my bf for 4 years. we have a great relationship and are extremely close (just for reference, we are both 30 so we're not in high school).       ever since the beginning, we've "shared" emotions. Meaning we can both spiritually feel what the other is feeling. for example, if he's upset at work, I can tell long before he tells me-I'll get uptight and upset so I know something is wrong with him and vice versa. if he's stressed out,depressed,etc-I am too (same with him if i'm upset).       it happened again today-he's had a really bad headache all night (we both work the same shift) and I've had one too!!       we are able to finish each other's sentences and hate being away from each other while at work.       is this normal for couples who are really close?

How do you communicate with someone that has been so hurt in the past by others that she can't express her true feelings? My friend has had sooo much pain in her life, that she just shuts everyone out when she is faced with an emotional issue. I know she feels very deeply, She has cried in my arms over someone else that upset her. But when it comes to talking to me about us she clams up and won't say anything and acts like she has no feelings at all that everything is just fine when I know it isn't.      I can see it in her eyes when I try to talk to her that she wants to say something, she even started to try to get it out then just shut down again.      What can I do? She knows in not going to get upset and scream at her or anything like that. So why can't she open up to me about things that have to do with our friendship?

20090223061335AAOYZIn	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How does he feel about this?	Okay so i went out with my friends, my guy, and his friends to the movies and after my friends left one guy asked if his friend could have my friends number and i kept saying no and so he offered to do push ups and i didn't believe he could so i said if he did so many i would. Then he did that amount and i said okay i will ask but she said no so i said i couldnt. Would my bf think bad of me for this? Or what about his guys?      If my bf doesn't mention it should i bring it up?
20090223072329AAtoGlL	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Are you divorced? Did you have a hard time leaving even though you knew it was the right thing?	I know I have to leave my husband, but I keep stalling.  I have two young kids and one on the way.  He's an alcoholic.  He's a jerk. He keeps putting the kids in bad situations.  I feel like an idiot for sticking around, but can't seem to get out.  Please help me see the light.
20090223075411AAtppRv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I talk to my ex about his engagement?	Ok. So about eight months ago my ex-boyfriend and I broke up. We had been dating for two years and it ended pretty badly. I do not want him back or anything because I realize that we would have never worked out and that I am better off without him, but I still care about him and do not want him to make a big mistake. I have heard through a mutual friend that he is engaged to the girl that he cheated on me with several months ago. Although they seem to have a lot in common, there are a lot of problems that will cause a lot of trouble later on. For example, huge difference in religion, family problems, trust issues. Although he and I have not kept in close contact for months I still feel like I should say something to him. I don't want to come across as jealous or that I am trying to break them up if I do talk to him, I just want talk to him think about this a little more.    Oh and he is almost 21 and she is 19, I think. Its not the age difference that I am concerned about or anything, it's the age period.    What should I do? Should I talk to him?
20090223082320AAt64hA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He said he doesn't like me but he keeps pulling me closer...?	ok so there's this guy and he is kinda my best friend right now but i also kinda like him more than that. well somehow he found out and idk instead of acting differently like he's trying to push me away more, he is instead getting closer to me, like now he leaves his math book at home all the time and so we have to share and we have to push our desks together and get really close, usually our faces are only inches apart, or he is always helping me with stuff and instead of just showing me how to do something, he will lean in and get as close to touching me, if not touching me, as possible.       another thing is that he knows that i like it when guys wear skinny jeans and play guitar and all that, and before he would never wear skinny jeans, he said he hated them, well now he wears skinny jeans like all the time and he is learning to play guitar. and not just any music, he's learning songs that i love to play (i play guitar, bass, and sing).       i just really need to know why he is doing this, it's just making me like him more! Oh and he had told me about 4 months ago that he liked me as a friend. I'm so confused!       oh and he said about 6 months ago that there was a possibility that he was going to move back with his mom (he lives with his dad and step mom, and the choice is up to him cause his step mom is really mean to him and his sister), but everytime i ask him about it, he puts the time he'll be gone less and less, and just recently, he said he probably won't go. oh and i've told him that i would be kinda upset if he left      so why is he acting like this? he did say, quite clearly that he like me as a friend.

20090223074554AAwwXLz	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is this a girl who's not interested ?	I went to a bar club last night cos it was my friend's birthday. Keep in mind this club is over 21's & i'm 18yrs old. Anyways i'm usually shy with girls but decided to give it a go. I saw these 2 girls sitting down who knew my mate so i introduced myself to them. Sometime later when i went to speak to them about all sorts, age occupation and at times i felt they weren't interested. When i said i was 18 they thought aww i'm a baby & cute (they are 25). As time went on, i felt it was me trying to continue the conversation, so they both went to dance. (At least i tried). Later on as we passed to go toilets, 1 of them playfully poked me on the chest & said "hey there you are, you alright ?" I said i'm fine & had to go - they both looked surprised...   What do you think ?

20090223043239AA96GvM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What does this guy want from me, advice please?	I met this guy twice in a club, the first time he followed me around the club but I took no notice, the second time he kept an eye on every guy that was trying it on with me and started on them sayingthat I was the girl he would spend the rest of his life with. He even took me to one corner and told me that I was too drunk and that he didnt like it when men tried to take advantage, every time he see's me he just grabs my cheeks as if I'm a baby, so weird! He managed to get my number from his mate and would call me day and night, I told him that I couldnt be with him since I was not ready for a relationship as I've just come out of a violent marriage but he keeps saying that he wont give up till he gets me and that he is in love with me, he is only 20 and I'm 24, its ridiculous! Anyway I felt that maybe he was desperate for sex since he has a bit of reputation with girls, I decided to invite him round mine and had sex with him hoping that he would get up and leave but he didnt! He stayed the night hugging me, stroking my hair saying he loves me. The following morning he cooked for me, even painted my nails and dried my hair after I came out of the shower. I don't understand what he wants from me!! Then when he left, he just kept calling me and speaking to me. How can he be in love with me??

[given that our relationship was like we were already married but living in two different houses].. yes or no????

20090223065420AAxdNHz	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Help me how do I dispose of this swimwear?	Hi I am a 33 year-old woman and I have a large collection of swimwear bikinis and swimsuits of various colours styles etc most of which has been bought by my husband for me over the 10 years we have been together. the thing is I don't think that I have the figure to wear these anymore nor do I have the desire to do so.      There is a lot and at a guess about a 150 maybe a bit more. I have twice tried to throw them out in the dustbin but each time my husband has found and rescued the swimwear. On each of these occasions there has also been rather heated discussions about it       I have also tried to donate to local charity shops but they don’t take underwear or swimwear for hygene reasons.      Any ideas on how i can get rid of these bikinis and swimsuits or  how can i do to stop my husband rescuing them from the dustbin. I will need to do it in one hit as I know he checks the drawers they are kept in, and also the garbage for them I actually don’t care if he finds them in it just what do I need to do to stop him from retrieving this swimwear.      I know I have posted before this will be the last please help me thanks.
20090223015837AA4fe5l	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think she likes me?	(sorry if this ends up getting a little long)   ok so i feel stupid asking this question but i have a tendancy to look too far into something...so i wanna get some outside opinions on this.      so i've always been the one to just be the usual shy timid me and hope for something to happen. then this girl came along and ive pretty much fallen head over heels for this girl. shes simply amazing. i didn't want to miss this chance so i have sorta been a little more aggressive than i usually am. it may not seem like alot to you but it is to me.lol. i sent her a txt the other day that read like this   "In all seriousness, my favorite days to work are the ones when you are there as well. i just cant help but smile when im around you. and i may make a fool of myself by saying this but i feel i need to say it anyway. i think you are the most gorgeous girl i know, and not just in looks. how you hold yourself, how nice you are, how smart you are and just how amazing you are all adds even more to how beautiful you are"      since i sent that txt shes been a little more...idk, flirty. she has started to txt me more often, she started using names like hun and sweetie, and the other day when i got to work one of the first things she said to me was come over here and give me a hug. and it wasnt just a little friendly side hug but a wrap her arms around me and hold for a little hug. then she asked me to walk her out to her car and wanted another hug there too.      i asked her if she would like to come to my little birthday get together on tuesday and she said she had a term paper to work on but that she would try her best for me.      i dont want to get my hopes up like i always do...but i just feel like maybe she does like me. what do you think?   thank you for your help
20090223042408AAtL0xd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do???NEED YOUR OPINIONS..URGENT?	okay, here's the thing..   I had gone for a coffee yesterday with about 20 girls(lesbians) and I met someone who had caught my attention   Of course, I've spoken to her online before and it was because of her that I had gone yesterday..   Well,we didnt talk much yesterday as she was at one end of the table,and I was at the other end   But she kept smiling at me though   And, she sms-ed me saying "Hey, I'm sorry I didnt speak to you much today. Gabrielle did warn us not to talk to the people we already knew"   Then I said "It's okay, prolly you and me could hang out sometime?"   She replied saying "Youre free tomorrow?Wanna hang out?   And I said "yea,lets hang out"      And today she canceled on me saying she was sick   I've also cancel-ed on her once before because my school had ended late   Before yesterday,we never used to talk much on msn coz she was pissed at me for cancel-ing on her the other time   But now, after the coffee meeting..She never fails to make it a point to talk to me on msn.   Sometimes, she doesnt talk much though..Not like before I cancel-ed on her.   I dont know anymore..   Should I move on?   She's always on my mind.   Do you think she likes me?      Im a girl btw      Yes, I do belive she was sick coz she told me the night before that she had a flu..and I could see frm her face that she was really not feeling well.      Sometimes, We run outta topics to talk about.   We dont talk like we used to talk before though..before I cancel-ed on her..      Before I cancel-ed on her, we were talking for hours and we didnt even realise the time      I guess, Its all my fault..Im a fool for cancel-ing on her..Now she doesnt talk to me like we did before

20090223041810AAb4hg5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I was dating a guy from work but we broke up because I found out he was engaged the whole time... how could he?	I was seeing a guy from work (who's one of the managers) but we broke up because he was engaged to his girlfriend the whole seven months we were together!!!   On friday, I found out he told a girl who sits next to me that... I knew he was engaged but still decided to go after him and the reason I'm so upset is because he turned me down to be with his fiance and he's also told her about texts and phone calls I made to him begging him to be with me and let me be his bit on the side... that's a complete lie!! I had a feeling he was seeing someone else and finished the relationship but I had no idea that it was actually his fiance or even that he was engaged!!    He's also spoken to my manager about me (I don't know what he's said) but when I asked her, she said it was none of her business and she wasn't going to get involved.       Now I feel like everyone at work knows things about us that aren't true and they think I'm a t@rt but I don't even know what they are...   I feel miserable and working here is becoming really hard. I hate the fact I have to see him everyday and that he's getting married in 2 weeks and I'm left with nothing... It makes me so sad and I'm crying all the time...

He was with only one girl before me, and he experienced all of his "firsts" with her. They were even trying for a baby at one time in their relationship. I think about the kind of first time we *could* have had together, and it breaks my heart... I didn't have anyone before him, and if he had been a virgin when I met him, our first time would have been so much more special, we could have both been awkward together... it hurts so bad but I can't stop thinking about it. He says he cared about the girl he lost his virginity to, and I just can't help but feel awful knowing that he cared and loved someone else... that he got that intimate with someone else before me, and that he will always have that little piece of her with him for the rest of his life, and vice versa. She's such a mean, hateful person, she didn't deserve him at all, I wish he hadn't given himself to her like that. I also can't seem to stop asking him questions about it either. I know all the details of their sex because I pry at him, and it only ends up making me feel worse... how can I stop, and move on? I'm so sick of thinking about it all the time...

20090223093135AARRgNC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this girl give credible dating advice?	This girl i know says that girls dont really go for blond guys and usually tall ones with dark hair. And she said i wont have a chance with girls cause i have thinning hair. Yes i do have thinning hair, but it isnt bad, i had other girls tell me its not bad. So yea, according to her, looks are 100 percent important and all she talks about how "hot" a guy is. Anyway this is a person that had a child with a guy that wont pay child support, she contracted 3 STDS! (HPV, Herpes, and trichinomoses)  Yet... she claims to know what girls want.. What do you think?  And no this is not a joke! Im dead serious haha

He was trying to date both of us and other women that we know (at different times). Then things didn't work out between him and the women. When I was dating him, he told me bad things about my best friend. Now he is telling my best friend bad things about me because things didn't work out between him and me. He also told my best friend bad things about other women whom she knows. Why did he do that? I personally hold nothing against him because I think he is just lost and immature but my best friend is really angry at him because we have been best friends for more than 20 years and she cannot stand other people talking **** about me. I feel like he needs to learn a lesson but what should I do?

I don't really think anybody in my grade likes me. Those few friends are beginning to realize that I have no other friends besides them while they have tons of others. I depend on them but they don't need me at all. I almost never hang out with anybody, mostly just stay at home and do nothing.  On top of that I get sub-par grades (mostly B's and C's and the occasional A or D) and I have no idea what my interests are and what I want to do with my life. Let's face it, my life sucks. Is there any way to help myself regain control of my life, or cope with this horrible reality?
20090223000852AAo0iO6	Family & Relationships;Family	Pleas help my mother is driving me crazy!!! I'm 13...?	My mother is such a negative person. She seems to only want to talk to me about all the negative in her life. Even though this isn't easy for me to do, I tried to be nice to her tell her everything is ok and that there is always a tomorrow. She wont even listen to me! It's like she just wants to argue with me instead of taking my advice and appreciating me for trying to be nice to her. I can't show affection well, and she wants me to constantly be with her and always tell her I love her. And I can't do that!! It's not easy for me. I had an argument with her a minute ago. It was because she wanted to know something about what someone was talking to me about. I told her that I didn't want to tell anything any more. Not because it was anything bad but I just like keeping things to myself. Immediately she said that I just wanted to shut her out of my life, and to remember this someday when that i'll miss her, because she wont always be around. And now she's crying...uhhh she makes everything into like she's living tragedy movie. Her life isn't so bad. I'm her only child, but still I can't handel this everyday....help me pleas?
20090223045233AApjM7Y	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do you think about this?	Ok so theres this girl I kno jackie who ive known for about five years now. We met in high school and always have been good friends but recently we have gotten closer alot closer like we hangout atleast oonce a week I hangout with her and her family she hangs out with mine we always go out togther on dates or road trips and i always have a great time and never had any complaints really. Except that she has practactly played games with me forever and idk wat to do anymore. Now lets get into our past like i said we went to school together well senior year me and her went to prom together and then i really didnt see her much after that or all summer the reason was cause i had a new girlfriend and now the girl that i had been chasing around and wanted to b with in the first place (jackie) seemed to b calling me ya kno tryin to make an effort like i was givin her b4 but only now shes callin me... go figure. So needless to say my new realtionship didnt last and i started talkin to jackie again a lil after that was over and we were still on good terms in fact the first night i had hung out with her after our "break" from not seeing each other me and her hooked up and the night after had sex so all that waiting in high school and me chasing her finaaly paid off but weirdly enough happened right after i had been with someone else and ignoring her. But ever since then we have not done anything sexuall like that again. i still hung out with her and still do. we had talked about bein together too but she says she doesnt want a relationship cause shes no ok with her self she says but this coming from the girl who wants me to b there only when she wants. So as of now im just goin with the flow cause i do like hanging out with her so i mine as well. Now i am just wondering if maybe i should make another move on her like b4 cause i was thinkin about it and i have made one since the last time we hooked up and if we are friends still then wat can it hurt. So EVERYONE please tell me what u think about my situation dont hold back ... Thank You

He's from a different state, but he's in my town for his job.  He's only here for a couple more weeks.  Things went really fast between us.  It's only been a month and we've already exchanged 'I love you's.  He wants me to move back to his state with him and I said I would, but now that I'm getting to know him a little better, I'm not so sure about moving with him.  I still want to see other guys and he wants to be exclusive.  He thinks I'm 'the one'.  I feel really bad.  Has anyone else been in this situation before?
20090223064247AAp3kdp	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Question about sexuality (or lack of)?	Well I have an interesting dilemma well here it is      I am not sexually attracted to girls I tried to force myself into being attracted but had no luck so I assumed I was gay but the strange thing about that is that I am not sexually attracted to guys either.      I have Absolutely no interest in sex at all but have forced myself to do so just for a chance at being with someone and afterwords I feel disgusted and miserable the same thing happens right after I masturbate. I do however enjoy basic types of affection kissing,hugging,cuddling,hand holding etc.      I told my mom how I felt and she responded by saying that I have just not found the right person yet and give it time.      I feel like some sort of an outcast especially in a Society that has sex on the brain practically 24/7      I am attracted to both males and females but in a purely non sexual way. Could it be a hormone problem,genetics or something else? I don't see a problem with it and don't feel that it needs to be fixed but I do need to know why do I feel this way. Why can't I have sex or masturbate or think of sexual things without feeling disgusted with myself and why am I not sexually attracted to either gender?
20090223070152AAIROuD	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Why am I so weird and inept at controlling my jealousy?	When my boyfriend and I are in public places, if I spot someone that I think he would be attracted to I completely close off to him. I assume because his body's pointing in a certain direction that he's admiring that person. I can't even look at him through fear of confirmation that that's what he's doing.  This causes me to feel rejected and then have this massive desire to escape from the situation. I'm not even sure if this is an attempt by him to make me jealous as it seems to happen hours before we part (we live a long distance apart and see each other at weekends/stolen moments in the week).      The really silly thing is that I then retaliate by going completely quiet, leading my boyfriend to think I'm completely bored by him.  I then go and seek out alternative conversation, generally with other guys. So it's as though I sub consciously want him to feel how I felt.      He's a really good communicator and openly tells me how he's feeling...and he tells me that I then make him feel rejected...any ideas how we can work around this issue??

20090223070824AAO5A4o	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How honest is too honest? when do u keep it to yourself?	Me and my girls were talking the other day, and a question came up:   "If two persons who had chemistry from b4, but they didnt work out based on circumstances (like distance) and they begin to talk again, and one realizes feelings are still there should that person tell the other how he or she feels?" (circumstances are better now)      One side argued to just let it go and leave the person, the time past for them, and they can just be friends and move on individually      and the other said, that you should always be honest with your feelings; be honest with yourself and the person. dont drag on a friendship if you know thats not what u want, it will only cause problems later.      what do you think?

20090223080425AAgvbFv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Boyfriend needs space?	My boyfriend and I have been having a hard time because of his schedual. He is a cop who works the nighshift, and also is a DJ who usually works fri and saturday nights. We had a fight about not spending enough time together last wednesday and I flew way off the handle. I said somethings that I didn't mean and honestly sounded a little psycho/stalker-ish :( I appologized but now he says that he needs more space and hasnt talked to me at all the past day. I textd him in the morning and he didn't respond at all today. He posted in a place that he knew I would see that he's DJing at my fav hangout for fat tuesday, so I am wondering if i should retain from texting him anymore until I hear from him first, and also if him posting the DJ message is his way of telling me to come up there that night? Also, do you think that this space thing is legit or should I be worried?
20090223083250AAWPL2w	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Who is right in this situation?	Okay, so I've asked my boyfriend to please not cuss in front of me.  I think it's disrespectful to me because I am a lady, and I should be treated as such.   On Friday, he lost a game and said "Oh my F-ing God" in front of me.  That's disrespectful to me in TWO ways, the cussing and the God part.   On Saturday, he drops his phone and yells the F-word.      So, I, of course, got very upset because it was disrespectful.   HE got angry at me for being upset.  Saying "It's JUST a cussword, it's not a respect thing!"      Who is right in this situation?   Am I right for being upset or is he right for thinking I shouldn't be upset?
20090223083349AAbvZHC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My BF jerks off at night, even though we're sexually very active...?	Alright, so I understand guys need some solo time alone and what not.   But this is my situation:      My BF & I tend to have sex a lot (we've been together over 2 years, living with each other about 1.5 years). Almost every night, sometimes when we're alone, it might be a couple times a day. And we try different things & what not, so it's not like we have a routine.      But, as a result, sometimes I get a little sore down there and just enjoy cuddling for a night (or give each other a massage), or if I am in the mood but I can't handle it down there, I'll give him a good BJ (rather than just leaving him hang there). But there have been times when I'll be lying next to him in bed, about half way asleep and I feel him start jerking off...      I've told him that if he needs to do it at night like that when we have a down night, that he needs to go to somewhere besides the bed, because I get upset that he has to do this next to me.   I've confronted him about it & he says that it's because he can't sleep (and I've told him he should practice breathing exercises which release tension, which probably keeps him awake)... Yet, he does it. So I feel like at night when do have sex, it's only so he can fall asleep..      Do I have a right to be upset about this?

He still calls/texts me everyday, but we talk about sports, or laugh about the things we did in college.....nothing really romantic or anything. Which leaves me confused. He spends a lot of time talking to me so sometimes I wonder if he likes me, or is he just bored?         thanks!

20090223091153AALX2jO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How long should I wait for a proposal?	My bf and I have been together for 3.5 years, and living together the last year or so. We are both divorced with children from our previous marriages. I have fully committed myself by quiting my good job to help him run his business ( at his insistence!), moved a state away from my family, and gave up the possibility of having more children (he's had a vasectomy). He led me to believe he felt the same because he would talk about "when we get married" and "where we will honeymoon" and talk about other long term goals. Recently he confessed that he's too terrified to get married again because women just leave and divorce is expensive! I don't know what to do. Marriage and commitment are very important to me and I don't want to give up the things I already have if he's never going to commit! How long do I wait or do I?

Just last night he said that he had a crush on this girl he has known since he was little. Which i totally understand and it is not that that is bothering me. The reason i am pissed is because prom is coming up soon and i really wanted to go with a date but all the guys that like me at school (not to be mean) are special needs kids.

20090223105555AAHyss1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	QUESTION FOR THE SHY GIRLS, would you act like this around a guy you like?	There's a girl that I have a crush on right now. I've never spoken to her, but we've had some of the same classes at college and I'm pretty sure she's shy and I think that she's never had a boyfriend(even though she's gorgeous). But anyways, whenever I've seen her when we workout at the same place on campus, in class, or in a store I've noticed that she seems to try to avoid looking at me when I'm looking in her direction, but only when I pass do I catch her looking quickly at me. So if your a shy girl do you purposely look away from a guy that you find attractive if you think he's gonna notice you checking him out?

In my case, a good friend of mine is terrified of wrists.  yes I know it's weird.  She almost screamed when I had grabbed her wrist to stop her from playfully hitting me soon after we first met.      Yet 2 years later now she grabbed mine to pull out my hand to hold it when I mentioned it was cold on a walk.      Am I just overreacting here?  This seems pretty big to me... I don't know if I'd go through a vaccination round even if I could have held her hand during it...

20090223122519AAn1Wrs	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Why does he keep putting his hands on my butt?	I met a group of guys and we all partied together one night. I was drunk and ended up kissing one of them. He wanted to have sex but I said no. I found out he was a major player so I think I will stay away from him. We partied again some time later and he kept putting his hand on my butt, but I kept taking it off. Like everytime I was standing next to him, he would put his arm around my hip and then move it down to my butt. Why does he keep doing this? I already told him I wont have sex with him and I dont see him doing this to anyone else but me!

20090223120401AAvKqzR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ladies: Why does committment matter?	Should I assume both girls and women are always looking for a solid, safe, and secure relationship as opposed to a short term (short fling, one night stand) relationship? I have this feeling that most girls (teens/early 20’s) and women (20’s-40’s) are always serious about relationships. As for those girls/women who want to only have fun… I often feel they’re not looking for a physical relationship but just something to do while in the relationship (go out, go shopping, play sports, having someone to talk to, etc).       Do they often avoid any physical intimacy and usually hope to build a longer lasting serious relationship… one that is emotional? Thoughts?

20090223115603AATQM5y	Family & Relationships;Family	What do you think about a 16 year old drinking with the parents approval?	My sister was at a party with her son, who is only 16.  He called my daughter that night obviously drunk off his butt.  I thought my sister was going to be at the party as well.  So, today I ask her.. "were you with you son Saturday" and she said "yes" I said.. "was he drinking" and she said "yes, I let him have a few drinks, he's a good kid, it didn't hurt him."  Now, to me.. I think it's dead wrong!  As a parent you need to show them right from wrong and drinking to get drunk at 16 is too young.  She went on to say.. .all kids drink at this age.  Most likely a lot of teens drink, but not with their parents condoning it.  What do you think.. I think it's totally irresponsible on her part.  Also, her and my brother in law still party hard and they are in their 40's.

Mainly because I love him, but I just feel we are stuck in this void and I am tired of it not going anywhere. I want to end it or at least have a break away from him, but I don't know what to say or how to say it. I have never really broken up with anyone in a civil manner...I have been with him since I was 15 and I want to be mature about it. I just don't know what to do, we have 7 years invested in this relationship. He also got laid off from his job and I don't know if this is the wrong time to to do this, and I may be wanting to do it now because of his jobless situation, because I do feel angry about it and I am mad at him. I just want to know if anyone has ever been in this situation or if anyone has some advice...I can go to my friends, but I just want an unbiased opinon. Thank you

20090223101745AAXwhqI	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is this guy a JERK? Should I regret this?	Long story short. I was casually seeing someone for 6 months. Things were great until his ex moved to the city. I had a hunch he still had feelings for her but gave him a chance. He began contacting me less. The next time we hung out, he called me her name while in bed. Closed his eyes, humiliated. I handled it reasonably, asked him to be honest. He confessed his feelings but said she didn't feel the same. said I deserve so much better, I'm awesome, he'd never do it again.      He IGNORED me for over a month.....until the other night. I got a text. Said he felt awful and was trying to keep his distance. thought he saw me out somewhere, was scared to say hi. that i must hate him/think he's horrible.  i dont know WHY i texted back but said a) im not a scary person b) i dont think hes horrible c) i dont hold grudges and d) if it was me and i saw him i wouldve said hi anyway.      He's NOT worth dating again, I know this. Im just a forgiving person and like to be on good terms with people. BUT after I responded, he never texted back. again, i feel dumb for being nice. My friend said I was foolish to respond. Do you think it was a bad idea? any advice??
20090223114816AAvOnUB	Family & Relationships;Friends	Best way to tell in-laws that they are unbelievably rude?	I married into a family whose siblings are all very close. My husband has two older brothers and a younger sister who is a year younger than I am. My sister in law is one of my favorite people in the world, she and I have become true sisters. It is a rare day when my husband and his brothers do not see each other or talk to each other. I am totally fine with this as I love both those guys like my own brothers. The thing is, I can't handle one of the brother's wife anymore and don't know what to do about it. I have held my tongue every time she has said something to offend or hurt me. Example: You have to let ME have kids first so MY kid's don't wear YOUR kid's hand me downs. I am totally over holding my tongue as this goes against my personal morals. I recently invited them all over for a BBQ at my house, she is the only one who didn't offer to bring anything. I told them that I had several bottles of wine, but if they wanted anything else to drink that they had to bring it. They brought beer, drank the beer I bought for MY husband and then took the rest of their beer home. She also drank a whole bottle of vodka that I did not offer to anyone, it was even hidden in the freezer. I spent over $150 on food and drinks and they didn't even THANK me. I have had her and her husband over for dinner once, they didn't offer to bring anything (am I wrong in thinking that is totally rude?) and didn't even thank me by the end of the evening. They, well she, has not been invited to dinner since. The thing is, we all hang out in the same crowd so it is tough to do things without her. This chick has cheated on my brother in law with one of his best friends and he still took her back. She recently told a stranger, who asked how long they had been married, that they have been married for "too long." I am convinced that they will not be married in 10 years as he will eventually see that she is no good for him (please God, I hope!). So, what do I do, until he leaves her sorry ***, in the mean time? I am Irish and have a pretty hot and quick temper, should I just lay into her next time she says something? She has a tendency to do and say things without actually thinking of them first (i.e. sending MY husband's phone a sexy picture of her to show HER husband). She knows this and this is always her excuse, yet she doesn't do anything to change herself. The only thing I am worried about is my relationship with my husband's family if I do say something. I love everyone dearly, except for her. What to do, what to do?!      Oh, by the way, my younger sister in law is in complete agreement with me and is ready for her to exit the family. Everyone else just brushes what she says/does off and this drives me crazy. No one will make her hold herself accountable for anything.       There are way more examples of her self serving, rude, skanky, ect.. ways, but this is already too long. Thanks for listening/reading!

I'm a personal trainer at powerhouse gym and I see a variety of clients everyday from weak to fat to ugly, etc.  I usually can find some way to motivate them to get in the gym.        However, I don't know how to tell my wife she needs to get in the gym.  She has plenty of time, she only works 30 hours a week and I do spend a few hours a week taking care of the kids.  She's balooned up to about 135 pounds, which sounds bad, but she is 5-9 so she's not that fat.  I just don't know how to tell her.  Should I tell her that one of my clients if feelin me so she needs to get in the gym to keep me?  Should I tell her that if she's in better shape, that she'll look better next to me?  I've already hidden some of her sweats so thats a start, lol.

20090223102838AATzcN0	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do you think cheaters need a second chance?	First of all, I know I asked the same question b4, but i have some more info now. thanx.      Hey guys. This is gonna be a long one, but I really need your advice. I wouldn't be asking if I wasn't totally confused. Ill try to be brief thou.   (you can refer to my previous questions if you wish, since this is not new)      Last week Me & my (9 months together) boyfriend decided to move in together. After a lot of whining, two months ago I decided (new year resolution) to start focusing on the good stuff and saying thank you for all the sweet things he does, and I found out they outweighed the bad stuff, and also I decided not to listen to third parties anymore. And surprisingly things got better, and better and then he surprised me saying I love you let's make another step.       But the thing is, my best buddy Larry, (who, BTW is NOT into me since he's dating my best gfriend and they're moving fwd also). Larry told me he was a jerk from the beginning, even before we started dating. Actually he has a pretty bad reputation here (we are all co-workers). And LArry's always telling me to be careful with him coz he's a cheater.      There were times in which he used to NOT answer the phone, and be mysterious, but we TALKED and he said HE WASN'T CAPABLE TO CHEAT ON ME. so we went past it. I trusted him better than rumors. ANd it's been a while that he's not mysterious anymore and he changed his attitude a lot.      But then, yesterday when i told Larry that we were moving fwd, he told me HE'S BEEN CHEATING ON YOU!. Btw my boyfriend is larry's boss. Larry said: Everyday he came in and told me about his "girls", told me I slept with X and Y and blablabla. I couldn't stand his cinisism, but also I never had more proof than his words so I didn't tell you all of it. Tried to help you open your eyes thou!!.      WHAT TO DO?   Im over the top confused.       Sorry it was long, but I feel completely broken.      We are on our late twenties      Also Larry said it's been a while since my bf doesn't tell him anything. At least two months.    I talked to my bf, he said he did cheat on the beginning of our relationship, but he doesn't do it anymore.       I am a mess. I don't know if he deserves a second chance, based on how much he has changed.. bcoz he has changed.      Advice??

20090223105633AAoQM19	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Like, Lust, Love, difference?	How do you know its love.   I think it is, and we both say it is in our relationship, but its a defined term that is objective to every person who says it and uses it.    I think i do, it would make sense, I cannot function without them, they are always on my mind, and when we are together we just click, i can stare into their eyes for hours. I get goosebumps when i think of us together, and the fact its a long distance relationship where we only see eachother every week or 2 weeks makes it so hard to keep my feet on the ground, my work is suffering, my sleep, i haven't sent so many texts ever.    Am i just excited because its my first real relationship, the first time i have felt like this about someone, and the feeling is completely and entirely recipricated.   Man this is mental!   please help :/

20090223113135AACrZUy	Family & Relationships;Family	Question about child support?	My ex left my and my 2 children. He was supporting all of us,I was not working at the time. I applied for food stamps,moved into my mothers,and started working. This was 6 months ago,I am in the process of waiting on a court order from child support. I know he has to pay back child support,but does he have to pay the food stamp money back as well?? Thanks

Now he saw his nephew having their second, he wants another one. His nephew's wife is not working, I work, his nephew's wife doesn't care about the way she look, I do. It took me almost 2 years to slim down, and picked up my career once again. He said I'm selfish not to have a sibling for our son, I said I have a good reason. What do you think?
20090223103200AAv5XAe	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Im trying to give her space but im scared she'll forget about me (Really need help)?	Ive been dating this girl for a couple months now. I really like her and she says she really likes me, that she likes how things are going with me, and that she's lucky I didnt give up on her when I could have (ive liked her for awhile). Coming off a romantic valentines day evening at the beach we have been less communicative this week. It made me kind of come off as needy, but she said she didnt get sick of me but she has just been really busy. I decided to back off and give her space and haven't spoken to her in 2 days now. I'm afraid she'll forget about me or something, but dont want to be clingy.      Do you think she's just been busy like she says? Am I at risk of her forgetting about me and how I make her feel? Its like I want to give her space, but I'm paranoid that I'm doing damage to what we have going (which seemed really good). What should I do?      She hasn't texted me first since thursday morning, but I texted her friday night to tell her have a good night and that we should get together next week sometime if she was free... to which she said yea we definitely should.

20090223102103AA6neQo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why Me? I just don't understand this.?	Okay so heres the long story short. I went out with this girl for about 2 weeks + everything was fine then i had to leave town for a week because my dad was in the hospital with a heart attack. Some how I knew I was loosing her. So I asked and she yes you are. So then I change my thing on myspace to singe. I was so worried about my dad my mind was in another place I couldn't deal with it all. Then I get a message wow its over? Okay. That was it. Shouldn't she of been there for me??       Then life goes on I guess. Now its the year after she gives me back rubs, hugs. Then out of the blue on night we kissed. The thing is I still love her. Even though all what happened.       I was a long in the hotel room with not knowing if my dad would see tomorrow and things just end. I'm so confused I haven't got one good night sleep in over a year because of this. Each night I run over and over it again. I loved her. Things always feel right when I am around her. I'm a nice guy I'm outgoing, friends with everyone, ill always be by your side, the guy that just wants to be with you and talk about nothing. Why did this have to happen to me? Ever since we broke up my life has when down hill. I still love her. And I don't know what to do. If we didn't kiss maybe things would be different. She was my first kiss at 17. Advise and anything that would help me out would be great.         Additional Details   In the time we never went out I keep asking if she wanted to doing things or hang out. It was always Im too busy. have this to do. Thats why none of this makes sense why did we go out and why did we kiss a year later. why all the hugs why just why?

We have been together for 5 years is it normal for me to be a bit worried about her still having his number and txting normal friendly txts once and a while? Am i being paranoid and it is normal to be friends with an ex that you were friends with before?

20090223104833AArN0lD	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I caused serious damage to my bfs sisters engagement!?	i've known them for 4 years now, my bfs sister and her fiancee. when ur with people alot u notice their faults ( not saying i'm prefect). but what i've noticed was that her fiancee tells her to shhh, and cuts her off when she wants to say something. my relationship with them is formal. i dont go out with her unless my boyfriend is around ( her brother). but ive seen her many times and shared alot of occasions together. last night we were dinning, all four of us, and the subject was womans rights. u know how it is, the girls get defensive.    shortly after this subject i  heard him tell her once again to ' shhhh, dont talk about stupid things, just give it up'. she then says ' i'm not gunna be a scared little kitten and shutup'.    me still in my defence gear said to him ' yeh, dont shhhoushh her. u do that alot, its very dissrespectful, and if my bf were to do that to me, i'd get up and leave immediatley, everyone has a right to their own opinion. thank god that she tolerates it when u say that. but as a friend i advice u not to show that kind of behavior infront of strangers, they will seriously get the wrong impression'.    OMG. here, he went RED IN THE FACE. she shuts up.   then he starts shouting all these negative things about her, and how she embaresses him infront of his friends and how she acts all powerfull and how his friends notice that etc....   she seriously was hurt and i could tell that they went off that night to have a BIG BIG fight. i sent them a text, apologizing and how i was only speaking as a friend and out of love....    seriously i was, i care about this girl so much and she is so sweet. so i thought i was helping her out. now they are in a big mess.    it wasnt my place to say what i said. i dont know how to reverse the damage i caused.    they are much older than i. my bf is 29 and i'm 21, his sister is in her late 20s. mayb i was childish, let my emotions get to me... so confused. talk about bad impressions. what would my bfs mother think about me now! interfering in her daughters relationship!
20090223103553AAvwZX0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	GIRLS ONLY! Boy problems!!!?	I have a major crush on this guy at my school. I'm in eighth grade and have never had a boyfriend! The guy I like is a major troublemaker, he got a warning to go to a school for bad kids only! (Not usually my type.) My mom doesn't approve him, neither does my sister or friends. I talk to him all the time! I text him after school and I hung out with him at the park after school. He likes me too, he told me. I told him that my mom doesn't like him and he is okay with being friends but we really like each other. One of my friends said that I should go out with him. I even cried my eyes out in the bathroom one day! (Long story..don't ask.) What should I do?!? I don't want to disapoint my mom and want to be with Michael...HELP PLEASE!!!
20090223111756AAUgRpX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why am I so bothered that my bf continues to meet people after we're together 4 yrs?	We live together and share a lot of bills and projects, pets, etc. My daughter is very close to him also of course which he seems to enjoy. But anytime the phone bill comes I see he still texts girls he met after me or that he dated before me, hardly calls, but some days there's 25+ texts to one of them or another. He's in the service and i'm sure he gets bored when he's away for a couple weeks or months, but he knows i'm not comfortable with it when it's been discussed in the past. Also, he totally shuts down if the tables are turned. If an old (male) friend or an ex contacts me and he learns of it he doesn't want to hear anything about it and assumes it means I replied or am up to something. I end up defending myself and explaining A-Z what the deal is so he knows there's no need to worry. Then I realize I'm still left in the dark as to why he talks to these girls, and about what, whether they know we are still together, or that I exist at all. I know we're not married, but really what are the differences between what I can expect now as opposed to if we were married? It's still a long-term committed relationship. Men, what drives you to still "hunt" if that's what it is? Is it just wondering if women will still find you attractive? I keep myself from saying a word about it anymore as my fear is I drove him to it in the past, that somehow unsure if he wanted out he was testing the waters, but now it's been a long time without nagging and I see he still does it and quite regularly. If I ask how his day was, all he says is he slept or was working (not that he was texting every 2 mins back and forth for hours with a woman he just met). Why don't these women wonder why he won't just call? I love him and he invariably ends his day saying he loves me and super sweet to me. Not sure how much harm just the texting could do unless he meets up with them before or after this goes on (I'm not gonna track him 24/7!) but part of me wishes to know. I realize Isound incredibly insecure and untrusting - frustrates me because I do love him and I don't want to be some nag invading every facet of his life and keeping him from any privacy or socializing with anybody of the opposite sex!
20090223110011AA9sST9	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Relationship problem - move in or move out?	My boyfriend and I have been together for almost three and a half years and we are planning to get married. Everything is perfect between us except for one thing: My boyfriend lives in rural area and loves it. His family and friends are all there as well as his workplace. As for me I was born as an urban girl and loves the town. I love the atmosphere, the busy place and people.      The problem is in one year we're getting married and the problem of "moving in - moving out" took place. My boyfriend is very stubborn and refuses to move in town. We've been discussing about it for sometimes now but apparently he is not the one willing to yield. Hence as i love him and don't want to lose him, i'm the one who is taking the decision of moving to his village. Unfortunately, everyday i keep thinking of the facilities i'll be missing after my marriage, such as the bus station, the shopping mall and arcades. Even my work place (which is in town) will be far as everyday i'll have to travel for more than one and half hour to reach there. I have told my boyfriend about these things but he told me that he sure i'll be okay with that with time. I cannot bring myself to argue because we always end up fighting.      I am afraid that i might not be able to adapt to that situation of moving to the rural. Please help me take a decision. I really don't know what to do.

Okay so I started liking this guy in September as soon as school started, but he liked someone else so I did what anyone else would do and then moved on and found someone else. A month later I found out that the guy I was with was cheating on me so it didn't last. The guy I started liking when school started got screwed over by the girl he wanted so we were just kinda there for each other. Mean while my BEST FRIEND started liking him, so I had to put him out of the picture because of her. I met someone else and we have been dating for a little over a month, my friend doesn't like this guy anymore and he's been talking to me a lot and I can't get him out of my head. Theres a four year age difference between me and my current boyfriend, no body really agrees with it. His ex girlfriend called him the other night and they talked for two hours, I started talking to the guy I liked in September, I still do have feelings for him. I've just never been so confussed about anything. Can someone give me some advice, please?

20090223102413AAv9LTB	Family & Relationships;Family	Respect between generations?	My wife and i recently had a family outing (which my wife organized)that turned out horrible. An altercation took place between a family member and a random person that my wife could have possibly worked with. As it turns out, some words were exchanged between a couple of the family members and the other person and my father-in-law became infuriated. My wife and I happened to miss the altercation and walked up to our family huddled together, where my wife asked the question, " What happened because I may work with that person?". My father-in-law flipped out and screamed at my wife, (who happens to be pregnant and very emmotional) at the top of his lungs in front of all family members. Well, my wife walked away because she was humiliated and knew that a response would only make the situation worse. I noticed my father-in-law sneak a grin to my sister-in-law as my wife walked away so I decided, in a polite manner, to tell him "Mr. soso, that's not funny you just upset her". At that, he jumped in my face yelling at me that he wasn't laughing. My question is, did I overstep my bounds and disrespect my father-in-law by essentially calling him out in front of his family (albeit in a respectful manner) or is he the one who owes me an apology?

20090223102820AAPXQwq	Family & Relationships;Family	Help! My parents don't trust me!?	My parents are always really strict, like they refuse to let me out for an hour on a school evening, even if all my homework is done and I clear up after dinner. All my other friends are let out, but I have to tell them I can't come. It is really making me sad, as my mum goes through my bag and tries to look on my facebook, jumping to conclusions on everything she comes across. Recently I have met a boy who I am dating, and she immediately distrusts him and myself. My younger sister always makes my mum angry of her behaviour and I get shouted at as a result. I try making my mum cups of tea to make her more nice but all I get is nasty comments back. I  really try my best to get her to trust me, but even if I get her in a good mood my sister does something stupid and reverses the whole thing. She has a boyfriend and my mum doesnt get suspicious. I really need a way to make home life happier, as I have recently felt the need to rebel, like smoking, which I really like, but don't pursue due to health reasons. (like it kills you and stuff) I dont want to smoke or other stuff but if I get even more frustrated, I fear I may, just for the heck of it. Any suggestions are welcome. :)

She cooks for me and always lets me kiss her and put my hand around her. Now when I text her, and say something sweet on there,  like ''I miss ya'' she never says i miss you back, she always responds to my text though. I have not been on a third date yet, all of the above took place on are first and sec date at her house, also  Im just wondering why is she so shy on the mobile phone, she was like that before I met her too.

OK so this is a pretty straight-forward q.... in a relationship, what are the cost/benefits of being the first to say I Love You?      I know, this sounds like a silly question, but think about it. What are the social consequences of being the first to take the step, aside from rejection.       Does it give the other person more control?      If you feel that way, is there an appropriate time limit for dating in which it becomes more appropriate to wait to say it?      Is it better for the girl to wait for the guy to say it first?      Based on your experiences, which strategy seems to work most effectively, if you truely care for the person, and have the lonjevity of the relationship in mind.
20090223113410AAMB1mD	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How to obtain marriage certificate when married under Hindu Marriage Act?	My wife and I got married in Gujarat, India under Hindu marriage act. We had a lawyer to register our marriage in local Marriage Registrar office using non-judicial document (memorandum of marriage) on the same of day of our marriage. However, I never received the certificate of registration of marriage but instead all I have is photocopies of memorandum. When queried to the lawyer, he said that the marriage is now registered and original memorandum is submitted and all I would get is the copies of memorandum and no other documents. Now, my understanding from existing forums on internet is that memorandum is used to register marriage and once register, the certificate is issued. However, I am now in need for my marriage certificate for various purposes and I do not know how to obtain it. I would appreciate if any one could please advice me. Many thanks.

20090223115742AAbskg9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I give up or will I give it one last go?	ok so i have this mate that iv had a crush on for a while now but iv already told her that i like her and she shot me down.       here is a bit more detail before i ask my question. we have been friends for about 2 years now but we have gotten much closer over the last few months as she moved (temporarily) closer to where i live. i waited about 2 weeks after she moved to allow her to settle before i told her how i felt but she said she did like me she just didn't want to get into anything at the moment and left it at that no more explanation.       iv tried to leave it and move on but iv got it pretty bad for her. i have a feeling shes just saying no cause she will be moving away in 6months.   i think this way cause we are constantly flirting by text and suggesting that we hook up is not uncommon in our conversations (she suggests it too). when i stay over in her house we always share a bed but just talk and sleep. and she regularly asks me for massages?       so here's my question: should i just give up and just think of her as a friend or should i try again to win her over?      oh and sorry all i didn't mean for this to get so long its just a bit of a complicated situation and i wanted to give enough info.

20090223122344AApyjM7	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I just discovered that my father is having an affair.  How should I approach this?	My father and mother, both in their late 50's, have been married for 32 years.  However, today I just discovered a stash of love letters and pictures and even a lock of hair from a woman my father has been seeing in secret while helping clean the garage while my parents are out of town.  They ARE recent, as one letter is postmarked 2/8/09.  I am shocked and appalled by this.  My father never seemed unhappy and is a devout Christian (almost to the "bible beater" point).  He has four adult children and two grandchildren (my kids) and this news would break everyone apart.  But having been divorced for a cheating spouse, I feel devastated and disgusted.  How should I approach this?  Should I confront him, or tell my mother?
20090223121709AA3Hi8J	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Dating advice for a Teen boy?	Okay this question might be long so bear with me please lol. Okay so theres a girl I like in my English class and I'm a shy person in recovery lol, meaning I'm gaining more self-confidence and becoming braver step by step. So, I guess you could say that I'm charismatic. I guess I should describe myself a little bit so you guys can get an idea of what I'm kinda like. So, I'm a teen boy and I'm asian, if that matters (don't get me wrong, I'm proud of that). I get compliments that I'm good looking and girls seem to like my hair? lol. (its not a bowlcut xP haha). I'm not extremely popular or anything but i guess you can say that I'm popular among people, like I have a lot of friends and people say hi to me. I talk a lot to my friends but I tend to shy away from new people. So, the girl I like is a blonde girl, who seems to be pretty nice, and has a good sense of humor. So, the problem is, I can't seem to get the courage to walk up to her in person and just even say hi or something. I'm wondering if its okay or a dumb idea to talk to her on facebook? For the ladies, what would you think if a guy just like randomly says "hi :]" on facebook? Wierded out? or okay with that?

20090223122417AAIiO71	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I move on? or wait?	My GF and I met randomly, after 9 years of separation and change of countries, about 1.5 years ago. She was going through a divorce at the time and we fell in love with again, despite the very hard experience I had when she left me to leave the country with her family 9 years ago. We had this long distance relationship for about a year when she moved to my city in Canada to live with me. Things got ugly when she decided she doesn't want to study in the field she had in mind and went back to CA to pursue flight school. She keeps saying that I never made her feel like home in her stay! I admit I got very scared of losing her again and showed anger and frustration. Anyhow, she started to get busier and busier and gradually decreased her contact with me, saying that she is too busy with her program and too frustrated with the problems she has in her life, including family, school, financial, etc. She also says that she has got out of a bad marriage and she is scared to make the same mistake with me. She needs time to know me better and to make a decision. She gets upset when I ask her to find some time for me or when I ask her why she spends time with her new friends/roommates and do not even try to contact me. I decided to stop the relationship but its very hard for me. One time she send me a text after a few days and said she doesn't want to lose our special relationship and if we give it time we might learn more about each other and things can work out. Recently I wrote to her that we should take a break as she doesn't seem to find any time for me and she can find me when she is ready. She wrote back that she is not going anywhere and she will always be my friend and will always love me! and that we will meet soon. I am moving to the States in a few months to start school in a place far from her and will be very busy with studying. but she has told me before that she plans to come to visit me often. I am having a very hard time seeing how she is going to do that when she doesn't even buy a telephone card to call me. I can see that she is afraid to hear my reactions and constant questionings but I have tried to talk to her many times and tell her that it is need both of us trying to change, she should find time for me and I should calm down. I have a hard time stopping myself to think about her and what will happen in the future. What do you suggest I should do? Move on or wait and see how things turn out?

20090223122409AAY1vco	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should i do???????/?	Okay so I’m fifteen year old girl and I’m going out with this guy who is five years older then me. We’ve been dating for two months and things are going great. There’s just a lot of problems! I’m not allowed to date and so I have to hang out with a friend  and secretly go meet up with him with out getting caught and a lot of times my friends can’t hang out and he doesn’t have a car (cuz he crashed it) and has to depend on someone else getting him there and that person’s schedule often clashes with my schedule so I never get to see him that often maybe once or twice a week if I’m lucky because he also doesn’t live in the same city as me because he lives with his aunt and uncle. And he’s also really really clingy . he literally calls me about fifteen twenty times a day and wants me to text him 24/7 and he gets really mad if I don’t text back right away and will call me “shady” and “scandalous” and at 9 I have to put my phone on the charger and can’t use it til the next day so he will tell me to go on aim (aol instant messanger) and talk to him from there til I go to bed at 10 …..but he’s a really nice guy and I’ve never met anyone like him before and no one seems to understand that everyone thinks “oh he’s taking advantage of you and wants you for sex” well if he wanted me for sex and didn’t care why would he want to talk to me all the time??? I don’t really mind because I really like him it just annoys me that he gets mad when I don’t text him right away im not doing it to dis him. he doesn’t understand that I have things to do like school, hang out with my family and friends and I cant dedicate my entire life to him. he doesn’t live with his family and he doesn’t have a job so I don’t know if that has anything to do with it but yea I’m really stuck and I don’t know what to do and plus my parents are CRAZY strict so if they were to ever find out I’d be dead.

I can't help it. Its just who I am. so do you think bein too picky can actually hold  person back from meeting new ppl and new friendships. whats your imput??

20090223131847AAuO3jP	Family & Relationships;Family	Should I Tell My Parents OF My Uncles Assclownery?	My uncle is an idiot.      My uncle was a huge druggie from the time he was eighteen till about fifteen years ago. Coke, pot, alcohol etc.      It comes out three years ago that my uncle was in debt 250,000 to credit cards. This makes no sense because he made a hundred thousand dollars a year from our business and lived an apartment owned by my dad who charged him much less than what normal rent should be. He has no family, no wife, no kids etc. He never purchased expensive cars or anything. I have no idea where the money went.      My parents get the credit card company to settle with him for sixty thousand. They loan him sixty thousand to pay this cause he doesn't have any money. He is apparently paying them off.      My dad just sold his piece of property partially owned by my uncle. My dad owns like eighty percent and my uncle twenty percent. My dad basically sold the building because he wanted to get out of the business with my uncle and give him a second chance in life after he lost his money. My uncle got around a half a million. This is his last chance.      My uncle has a stupid friend who owned a business that made money for the last thirty years but in the last five it has been loosing money and he is going out of business. The idiot is putting his own money into the failing business. My parents have always worried that my uncle would loan money to his stupid friend. I just found out that he loaned at least fifty grand to the guy.      I don't think that my parents know. Should I tell them?

20090223130845AAXSsMI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Think my boyfriend is embarrased of me?	I think my boyfriend is embarrased of me. When we are alone, or together at his house or mine, or wherever that is not in public just the two of us He's sweet and 'loving' and not ashamed at all. But when it comes to being with his friends or just in public where no one can hear or is around, i'll say 'i love you' but he wont say it back like he's enthusiastic like he will mim or or say it really quietly and quickly while looking around. Sometimes i feel as if he never want me there when he's with his friends or in public as if i embarrass him...      I know this is minor but i feel he is and it kind of hurt when im standing in front of him and he doesnt say it the way he does when were alone.      I'm not at all embarrased and will say i love you all the time and tell him he's amazing in public and hug him when another boy comes along  just to let him know that i only want him.      Why would he feel this way?      Do you think hes embarrased of me?      Thank you

Someone suggested that I put a note on our website, stating the date.      Someone else suggested I email everyone and tell them the cut-off.

Our wedding is pretty informal, so we don't need to tell any suppliers guest numbers until the week of the wedding, and we still have 4 months until the big day.       Our cut-off is April 1st, meaning I then have 3 months to chase people, which is plenty.
20090223123526AAmgeH2	Family & Relationships;Family	My daughter is very sad and depressed, what can I do?	I adopted my daughter, I had her as a foster child first and recently adopted her. She is 13 but is very frail and petite and has Cerebral Palsy and is confined to a wheelchair. Her birth mother was recently killed in a terrible accident, and although my daughter was and not with her when it happened, when she found out about her death she totally broke down. When she's awake she's very clingy with me and I hold her, and she hates when I let her go for even a few minutes. She cries so much and she will often cry herself to sleep then she will suck her thumb all night. Even though her birth mother wasn't able to take good enough care of her she obviously she still loved her and felt attached to her and hoped someday she could be able to take care of her. (I don't have any other children and I'm all she has now)   I brought a therapist to see her but she hasn't said hardly a word to the therapist so far, she won't really even speak to anyone now besides me for that matter. What should I do to make her feel better and improve her mindset?   (also, please only serious answers)

I am 23 and my man is 30... he has been fighting his divorce for about 2 years, because when she left she took everything and all he had was a tv that didn't work and a old mattress, and she took all his money out of their bank account. So anyways he was trying to get her to agree on things that were his and she finally just now agreed. They have 2 children and I am living with him, at first just to help pay bills now we have fallen in love. We used to sleep in different rooms and now we sleep in the same bed. So for the last year and a half it has been "Us" and I am happier than ever. I just found out I am pregnant. Six weeks along, so nobody knows yet. And now he has to go to court to fight over custody of his children, I am supposed to go, his lawyer told me it would be best interest if I did go for the court has already done a background check on me (needed for court giving him 50/50 joint custody). Every other week the kids will be here. So while he is at work I will be here watching the kids. 8 year old boy and 5 year old girl. Should I go for his "wife" will be there????

20090223125452AAEUbIz	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What does marriage entail when it's pass the 10 years mark?	How do you know you can fully trust someone to love you and feel the same for you for the rest of your life when there's so many cheating, divorces and dysfunctional marriages out there? If you are financially independent and don't need someone to share your bills, will you marry? How do you stand seeing the same person day in and day out when you are together for more than 13 years? Married men, don't you loose attraction as you watch your wife aged and wrinkled and put on the pounds? Do wives turn into mothers with time? Englighten me people! Please.

He always tries to make a move but I just push him away. I don't want him to think that something is wrong with him. I'm just scared.   Is that weird of me to be scared? Or what should I tell him. I would be too embarassed to say that I never kissed anyone before.

20090223122648AAhU55T	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do I bring up my feelings to my husband?	We have been married a year, been together 5 years.  We were good for 4 years and then i left him.  We got back together a month later and got married.  I love him, but i am not sure if i am in love with him.  I know it's sad, but i don't know.  He has 3 kids.  two that we see every other weekend and one that is in foster care that he is trying to get custody of because he just found out he was the father about 3 months ago.  I am not sure if I am ready to be a mother.  I am 23 years old.  I am only 8 years older than his youngest.  It's hard on me because i don't have kids for a reason.  I am not ready.  And now i have to be the parent.  He works 6 days a week 10am to 10 pm and when we get his two kids every other weekend, i am in charge and it's hard because they are teenagers.  I'm stressed out because i feel that i shouldn't have to be responsible for his kids, but at the same time i married him, so that does put responsibility on me.  I just don't know how to bring it up to him.  He have been fighting on and off over issues that happened a year ago when i left him and things that i have said.  He has even brought up divorce a few times and said that would be best for me so i can go on with my life.  blah blah blah.  it just gets tiring. I tell him i love him and that i am not going anywhere ever, but in the back of my mind, i think, i have no idea when i would and will leave.  I think about it alot. Also there is one of our friends that i have a major crush on, but he is out of state so nothing could happen.  But it's still a lingering thought in my head.  Any advice would be much appreciated.

20090223125845AAcrsZC	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Would You tell Your hubby?!?!?	Ok... backround info. When we were teenagers, me and my step brother did "it" a few times, on and off till we were in our 20s, There was no blood between us, and we never met each other till we were 17 and crammed in one room over the summer months.   So here we are in our 30s now, im married kids ect, and so is he. Lately he has been hitting on me everytimme my hub is out of the area. Even my sisters are noticing this activity. My problem is should I tell on him? Or what? Should i talk to him and risk total humiliation,  , but i would still be embarrassed. Or should i just blow it off as harmless flirting? Keeping in mind, that he is a total cheater, been cheating on his ol lady for years. So should i even involve my old man or should i just ignore the skeeze? i hate starting **** with in the family because were all a bunch of hot heads. so whats the opinion of the masses? 10 points to the one who moves me to a decision!

20090223123157AA6FGa3	Family & Relationships;Family	How can my sister learn?? What can I do to help?	I have my 16 year old sister, she's like the black sheep of the family I can't seem to understand why she acts the way she does.... I mean she has been locked up many times for stealing, not attending school, and always behaving bad! Not enough to mention she also sells drugs. I honestly don't know what to do I wish I could help her and my mother! Because my mom doesn't know what to do anymore! OOO one big detail I forgot to mention is that she's a lesbian! I don't have anything againts her sexual preferences I just don't think it's right that she feels the right to do whatever pleases her to get what she wants.Always putting as an excuse that no one understand her because she's a lesbian. She has also stolen my identity once and I reported her but nothing was done, she also stole my mothers identity to get a brand new phone that costed $300.00 plus ran up the bill to $500.00~~ my mom thinking she was doing my sister good didn't let the police know and paid for the bill.. I know my mom does all this because she loves her and I do to but I just think by covering up the stupid stuff she does she's not helping her but instead making her worst!!   Please if anyone can suggest anything!!      Thanks   XOXO
20090223124519AAgNIHf	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How can I make the best of a bad situation?	A few months ago, my boss gave my job to her daughter (who was a close friend), and I was transferred to a lower position within the same company.  Even though I believe I have never been nasty to the person who has replaced me, I can't shake this feeling that I am overqualified for my current position and I am entitled to something better.  That attitude has made me very bitter, but I don't know how to get over it and it doesn't look like I'll be getting a different job any time soon (I have sent out many, many, many resumes and I can't seem to get an interview.)

20090223124123AAIxQ91	Family & Relationships;Friends	GIRLS: I really need help!?	So I'm re-posting this question,   Here's my dilemma, my best friend is a girl (which is not the problem). Recently she had her period and was acting all weird, and I had no idea what to do or say. I didn't want to hurt her emotionally and she wouldn't tell me what was wrong (understandably seeing as how it's not exactly something you we discuss every day.) Our moms talked, and my mother told me what was going on, so that's how I know what it was. My question (mainly for girls) is how should I act around her when she is going through this? What should I say or do? What should I not say or do? Honest answers are welcome, please don't make any rude or stupid comments.    Just some more info, we are very close friends. So much so that we call each other brother and sister. We have a great friendship and I don't want to hurt her feelings or anything by saying or doing something that would upset her. Thank you all so much for posting and helping me out, I really appreciate your help. Thanks.

I don't work, and my hubby works full time and we only see him for a few hours in the evenings and on sundays.       how do you spend your days? my boys get me up by 6am at the latest and my youngest keeps me up til 11pm. there's only so much cleaning, playing, etc that can be done!      we're stuck at home almost all the time, as I don't have any form of transportation for both kids, through all this snow. I go out sometimes on my own with the youngest, but otherwise I have to stay at home with the boys (my oldest gets out often, cuz he visits his dad regularly).      so what do I do? the only things I've found to keep me busy are TV, y!Answers, and playing with the boys. even they get fussy and restless because there's nothing going on around here. I don't want to use the TV as a babysitter or a primary source of entertainment.      Oh, also. there are no friends or family near me. I am wanting to join a few mommy groups but due to other circumstances, my schedule is very inflexible and doesn't allow for those things. I hope to have this issue sorted out by sometime this summer. (involving custody and access).      We're bored!! please help!!      (p.s. none of us are into arts and crafts)

20090223123400AAgn1i7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	(10 points for best answer) Is my girlfriend pregnant?	Alright shes 16 we have been dating for a month now, we been having sex for lets say three weeks, will whatever weekend the Superbowl was. And since then we have done it tons of times.      Anyway shes on birth control so we don't use condoms, and I pull out when I'm ready to go anyway. I am confident I have never went in her, but often times we go right back at it after were done, without cleaning up or anyway I guess haha.      She has always been paranoid about getting pregnant but we get to the point where she just wants it so bad she doesn't even think about it, shes just really wants to make sure that I don't go in her.      So anyway yesterday was quite weird, everything was going fine and I was on top of her and we were just kissing and holding each other. Then she felt discomfort and I moved off her, and shes like omg I feel like I have a baby inside me or something. And I'm like what... she then looked at me and we kind of changed the subject.      She then asked me hey if I was to get pregnant your over 18 you could take me to get an abortion right. And I'm like I think so, I don't really know though why. And she didn't answer the why part, and shes like well then my mom would never know and she smiled and kissed me.      So today at school she texted me during class. Complaining about pains in her stomach like cramps, and I asked if it happens a lot she says no. So I was telling her I hope she feels better, try to take it easy. And then she flat out said ok if I don't get my period soon I'm taking a pregnancy test. And I'm like ok...      Our last conversation she was asking if I would wear condoms, and I told her I would so. This is where we are, I honestly think shes concerned about being pregnant. It just so happens that her mom is pregnant right now so she spends a lot of time looking after her and learning about it. So she would know the early stages...      Are these sings can someone please help me out, sorry for the length but I'm in a bad place here. First I don't want to get her pregnant it would mess up our lives. And second if she is I really don't want her to get abortion. Although I might have to, because its her decision.

None of her grandparents showed up. My husband's parents say they "forgot" and still hasn't called or tried to come see her...my mother said she wanted to do something with her that was special just between them two and told her she would come see her today and spend time with her. Well, she called a few minutes ago and said she just didn't feel like coming today. What the hell? If this was you would you be mad or am I just over reacting? This is not the first time this has happened. They do it to my kids all the time. Is this bad grand parenting? What should I do. Should I tell my kids no they can't see their grandparents because they are a**holes? I;m tired of babies getting their feelings hurt. I am so mad at them I can't even begin to try to talk to them. I have always been good to them. Anytime they needed help or had any sort of problem or anything I have always been there for them. My husband too. We haven't done anything to make them mad at us for any reason. Sorry it's long but got to get some frustration out.

20090223123736AAEDt5W	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Will my wife ever change from being a slob around the house/car?	Married a little over a year. We both work during the day, and have a 4yr old daughter (step father). Besides other minor issues we have run into early in this marriage, I did not know when I married her that she was such a slob, and I mean big time. And when she does feel like cleaning, its only bathroom, kitchen, living area. Never the bedroom. EVER. She tells me that if you want it clean, then I should clean it!  I mean from clothes, to crumbs in the bed, to sometimes snack wrappers on the floor and couch, plates on counter and not sink, just to name a few. And I help out with the entire home and do the work outside as well so I don't expect her to be a maid by no means.       I've read many post about the issue, but I want to know for those that have been with this type of person for a while, will they EVER change their ways? Or is this something I have to deal with for the rest of my life? If so, I'm out because I can't seem to get over it and trust me I've been trying for a year now and it bothers me daily. Yes, I've told her and she knows. I've tried all types of gimmicks, tricks, incentives to clean,  but to no avail. I don't mean to knit-pick as marriage is compromise, and I'm no neat freak at all, but damn yall this is ridiculous! What yall think?

20090223123651AAiNzkf	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	My bf is insecure, and not nice about it!?	When we met he was more worked out, and didn't have as much acne.   This was over a year and a half ago, we are in our early 20's.   NOW he has a LOT of acne, and has obviously gained some weight. no more "possible" muscles (They could have been there if he sucked in, and lost 20lbs) on his chest, the shirts he used to be too small for are now WAY to small for him, and he can puff his tummy like Santa.   I still love him, and have problems of my own, but I feel bad, and want to help him.   Every day he TELLS me to lie to him "Say I have a six pack" and "Say I have a smooth face" (He has actually asked me to lick his face before!!!) The last problem is, he has what HE calls "Man boobs" Meaning his chest is not flat, and has not gotten flatter (obviously) But I have started making changes in my life, and I want to HELP him, and not feel like I will get bitched at if I tell him the truth, since he yells me, and calls me out when I say things like "are you going to use our work out Machine" (I asked this because his mother asked me to since it is at her house collecting dust) he yelled at me, told me he works out sometimes when I am sleeping (which I KNOW is a lie because he is sleeping with me!) and called me mean names, and then asked me to tell him how sexy he was....   I once tried to help him with his acne by buying him stuff and he was soooo pissed! I did this because he is n the sales business, and some days he won't leave the house because he feels bad.   He also eats the WORST food, even when we have NO money to spend he goes out and buys hot cheetos, and cheese burgers, gobbling them down in less than 30 seconds, and goes out to get more (that is NO joke, or exaggeration)   He will NOT eat my food because "it is gross and Vegan fruits, veggies, soups, puffed millet cereal)   HOW do I nicely go about telling him the truth? It is hard because most of our relationship is based on lies that he ASKS me to make, because he gets pissed about the truth!   He never tells me the truth, and always makes me feel bad, I try and make him feel good about himself...   HELP!!!

I have a older brother so its not like there is a younger sibling who they don't won't to blame. Aswell as this me and my dad always argue and i always get blamed for starting it but normally it is the other way round and he will shout at me for spilling juice or something silly like that and thats how it starts.   This is making me really furstarted and I don't know what to do, I have tried talking about it to them but it didnt work.
20090223125756AAcVTvr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can this relationship work or is it doomed?	I met this guy... we haven't known each other that long but we already love each other.       Trouble is - he's VERY not expressive. He's on this medication for anxiety disorders that flattens him out emotionally. I know he loves me because he's always there for me and he puts up with a lot of my issues. He says thing flatly in overly simple language (like if I called him crying about something he'd say, "that sucks,") and it really hurts me.    It makes me want to put myself in dangerous situations, maybe drink too much or walk alone at night, etc. just to try to get a reaction out of him. I know that this is not healthy. I want to learn to just deal with his flatness but I have a history of being abused by guys who are very flat right before they strike, so it makes it really hard to get used to.      What do you think? Can he change? Can I? Or should I call this thing off before it hurts either one of us more??

Sure, we don't have as much experience as our elders, but I, for one, KNOW what love is. I know how it feels. Why do adults try to tell me that I don't? I understand that there are different types of love and different views of love, but just because my view may be different than an adults does NOT mean I don't know what it is. I just don't understand why adults think teenagers don't know anything..... even about love.

A girlfriend that I have had for 20+++ years and I are going on a trip together next week (along with one other mutual friend).  This one friend can't be bothered to return a phone call, email or text for almost a month now.  She has left me one message saying she is excited about the trip and that she wants to make "carpool" arrangements to the airport.      I am a bit peeved that she hasn't been returning my calls or answering my messages.  Am I supposed to just go on this trip with her and act like the best of friends?  Personally (and I know this is immature) I would like to see her find her own way to the airport and once we get to where we are going I would like to be short with her.  I know this is unreasonable and will not really be the way I act, but how can I just let her standofishness just go and act like nothing ever happened?

20090223123822AAFfnYh	Family & Relationships;Family	Disrespectful sister in law - Husband continues to communicate w/her - How do I deal w/ the resulting anger?	I hate my sister in law. She is a extremely disrespectful and keeps up unnecessary drama w/in the family... My husband is VERY aware. She has ran his name through the mud numerous times with family and friends only to make herself appear squeaking clean when in actuality she has the major issues. She's a manipulative con artist who will stop at nothing to get her way even if it makes someone else look bad. The cards have been laid on the table several times for my husband to see. He has even had 100% verification of her betrayal but still continues to communicate with her. I believe that she is jealous of her little brother's accomplishments because they have by far exceeded her own. At any given chance she will try to break him down and minimize his success. This makes me angry because she has painted a very ugly and false picture for extended family and friends that my husband is not as close to as she may be. I've never trusted her. It only took one time for her to directly disrespect me and all ties were cut except for the one I love, My Husband of 15 years... I don't deal with her anymore but it makes me extremely angry (to the point of tears) when my other half does. I try not to make my husband feel like he has to choose between us, but I cant stand her and I want him to realize that she is only out to hurt him/us... What can I do to get over the anger?

20090223125928AA3BsbW	Family & Relationships;Family	My dad hasn't spoken to me since July- I'm 26 years old!?	After a "family" trip this summer, my dad has not bothered to talk to me. While on the trip, an incident occurred with my sister and her daughter (and lack of discipline). My dad blamed me for the situation, and treated me like garbage. I have to admit my dad and sister are completely lazy. We stayed with my aunt, and without asking I cleaned up the kitchen after them, did everyone's laundry. I stayed out of people's way, babysat the kids while we were in the pool every day while everyone else socialized completely ignoring the four young ones in the pool under the age of 6.      Anyway, my dad said some really nasty things while on the trip. I am one of those people who will stand for what I believe in, but also be respectful. My dad is not one of those people, mostly he will play the pity-party game and have everyone feel sorry for him. Where we went, the only things people would talk about are gossip about others. I prefer to talk about things or ideas, such as news events, anything health related, heck anything really. My dad told me the first day that "no one wanted to hear about that health crap." However, my sister, who is older and I never thought of her as "the favorite" went on and on for 7 days about her jewelry sales, and how much money she would make, and what bracket it would put her on. At first I was supportive, but it got old fast.      Anyways, the day we got back, my dad has not called me once. Out of three siblings, my brother and I are doing well, never in debt, trying to live our life as best as we can. I went to college and am a grad student, am a full time teacher, and never ask for ANYTHING from my dad. My sister, however, doesn't work, stays at home in a pig stye (my dad's words), and always is asking my dad for favors. She is upside down in debt, and is always needing to be bailed out.      I don't understand how my dad can simply ignore his own child. He's done this before (we've gone years without speaking), and he apologizes but does it again! My heart is broken. I'm 26- old enough to know he'll never change, but wondering what else can I do in my life to make him proud?!? Doing well in school, being self-sufficient, none of that matters. My sister keeps getting support, help, and love from him and she never helps him out.      What can I do? Should I just let it go? It's a habitual cycle that he does. Heck, my brother got in a serious motorcycle accident and my dad NEVER called him to see how he was doing!!! (By the way, my brother and I are "real", and my sister is "half"- she has a different mom).      HELP!

But while we were together my ex of the past 4 years kept following me and making promises of things that he would change...   Well, i wanted to believe him and so i broke up with the ex to get back with him...   Now, 9 months later we moved in together and i still can't get my ex out of my head... What do i do??

20090223130115AAuJjON	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	So confused...how can I positively change my current situation?	I've been married for the second time for approximately 6 years. Just like all marriages, the "Honeymoon Period" followed for some time after our nuptials. But as time passed and our children were born, my Wife's focus shifted from being my Wife, to simply being a Mom.       Over time, she began to show less interest in everything except our children. As a result, our intimacy suffered. Long talks with each other followed, as I outlined my worries, needs and desires for a better dynamic. Overall, she continue to ignored my needs in our relationship and I became resentful. She became the perfect "housewife" and I became the stereotypical "working Dad." Our worlds continued to move farther and farther apart, even though I had warned her of such a possibility.       I am now disillusioned with our marriage and do not feel the same special feeling I once felt for her. I have two beautiful children by her and two by a previous marriage. I hate the thought of divorcing for a second time and separating from my children again. I don't even know if want to make it work anymore. My trust in her ability to be the type of partner I need her to be, has eroded over time. I'm so depressed and confused...can't eat or sleep. What should I do?

There is a boy that use to have a pretty girlfriend...They broke up and about a month later we went out. I was kind of scared that i was the rebound cause she had a boyfriend already.

20090223141853AAHweKJ	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Why do many people feel that you are not engaged unless you have a ring?	I keep reading/hearing this and I don't get the logic of it so can anyone explain it? A ring is not what makes you engaged. It is the declaration of intent to get married that makes you engaged. The ring is just an outward symbol. So by the above logic, even women who were married during the Depression or any other time when their husbands didn't have money for a ring, they aren't really married even though the law says otherwise. Why are people so materialistic that if they don't have a ring to announce the engagement to the rest of the world, that they are supposedly living in a fantasy world where the engagement never really took place? Does anyone else agree this makes no sense whatsoever?

My boyfriend hates when I smoke it. I never do it in front of him. I only smoke with my younger brother (20 yrs old and I'm 26 yrs old). I guess my boyfriend hates that I smoke it because his father used to make him sell it when he was a teenager.

20090223133435AA93lRb	Family & Relationships;Friends	Sort of embarrassing question involving friends and "growing up"?	Okay... Now, soon I'll be entering high school, and a lot of the people around me keep saying how they've had sexual experiences, and trying to make me look weird because I haven't.       I'm not saying I want to, because I honestly think it's funny that they're making themselves look like idiots, confessing (if they really have) to having sex. I don't want to have sex, not that I'd be able to, but it's really annoying me how they keep bragging me and making me feel uncomfortable. It makes me feel weird because it feels like I'm being excluded...      And, don't tell me I need new friends, because they're cool... For the most part. Plus, this is during school, so it's pretty much inevitable to hang out with them because I sort of have to sit by them..      Again, I DON'T want to have sex, and I REALLY don't want to be like them; it just makes me feel weird to be around them when they go bragging and saying I'm weird for not, and not wanting to, have sex. What do I do?

20090223133019AADQ7VW	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Why do I feel guilty for wanting a nice dress?  Wedding?	I haven't gotten my dress yet.  But the more I look at dresses, and all the ones I like, I feel guilty for wanting them.  Like people would think I was stuck up or conceded because I had a nice big dress.  (Even though I refuse to pay over a few hundred for it).         I'm really pushing to stay under my budget but I still want things like a professional photographer etc.         I think the reason I feel guilty is because the last few weddings in my family "I" was the photographer, they usually got a somewhat casual dress (no train, no frills etc), EVERY reception was held in my aunts backyard.  Which I will probably do too, but sorta don't want to.        Is it normal to feel so guilty about your wedding?

I'd love him but i'm getting tired of putting up with him. I know he loves me and cares about me but maybe he is just not the right guy for me..we barely talk and see each other. I always text him and call him and it takes a day or two for him to answer me back! I'm a girl and i need more attention from my boyfriend, now i'm starting to think he is cheating on me. But i don't know i could be wrong. I asked him if he wants me to break up with him he said to be honest no i don't want you to break up with me. Then the other day i freaked out on him because i'm getting tired of him being all immature. So i text him and told him how i felt he told me that we're not connecting like he thought we would and he doesn't think we should be together. So i got mad and i told him he could've told me that when i went to see him he said he likes us being together!!! I think he is confused just like i am. But i'm not sure.       IF YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS OF WHAT'S GOING ON PLEASE HIT ME UP!!      THANK YOU GUYS <3

20090223143505AAigM2T	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do I have a chance of really dating him or not?	Last semester I lead this guy to believing that we would fool around together because i told him how i'd just like to have a  guy that i can just do that with. He suggested himself....i also asked him what happens if i start to develop feelings for him and he said we would cross that bridge when that time comes. Well, at that time i already had a guy that i was just fooling around with,  but i was hoping i could change his mind, which never happend. So i called this other guy and told him no i cant just fool around because i would get attached so i called it off and said i was sorry for doing that. Well, last Thursday we hang out at his house, and things got pretty steamy...but i told him i wont do anything else cause i want a RELATIONSHIP so he said i know...   I had a lot of fun that night, but i want him as a bf...how can i help him that way? I know i ruined his mind and made him think i was easy...im not...   Do you think he will want a real relationship with me or no? He invited me over to his house tomorrow...should i go?

20090223133647AA1iOrH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I need your opinion please?	This is kind of long.   I've been talking on the internet to this guy since 95 just as friends. There's been a huge amount of time that we haven't talked (I didn't have internet) and we lost touch. Well, about 2 and a half years ago, he looks me up on myspace and he's smokin hot. He was in college for IT (we always talked about scifi and nerdy stuff when we were kids) and he's really smart. The problem is I live in Ga and he lives in Pa.       A few years ago, we told each other we liked each other but lost touch for a while. We're talking again, mainly text and we both admitted to being in love with each other. Is that weird to not be able to get someone you've never met out of your head? Since he graduated college in Dec, we will probably get a chance to finally meet up.       The actual question though is: What is your opinion on the situation?

And surpringly enough, he can drive my 1973 Volkswagen Beetle (with a 4 speed manual) without too many flaws. He does stall sometimes, but he is amazing for a 5 year old. He is impressive at starting on hills too. He is tall for his age, so with the seat all the way up he is able to reach the pedals without much of a problem. He does not drive on the road, only in my driveway (750ft long and has a very large parking lot type open area by the house). I simply can't believe how good he is.

20090223143554AAsIEvB	Family & Relationships;Family	What should I do about this?	My mother has been married to this man for about 10 years and he has always been very verbally abusive. Almost every time I go over to her house he is yelling at her calling her bad names and basically blaming her for everything. He also makes her pay all the bills and keeps her broke but he makes twice as much money as she dose. He is nice to her some of the time but mostly he is just evil to be around. I want her to leave him but she thinks that since she is 56 yrs old she will have a hard time making it on her own she makes plenty of money and wouldn't struggle if she just lived within her means. She is also a little scared of leaving him. I am trying to convince her to leave him, she says she wants to but then she always loses courage. any advice?
20090223133137AABOWyP	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Need some advice on how to work things out?	To start....my boyfriend and I have been growing apart for some time now. Friday he had decided that it was more important to him to go to vegas with his friend then to stay home with me and my son (he goes out EVERY weekend). I told him that if partying was more important to him then i wouldnt be there when he got back. He decided to go anyway. Everything started to go downhill when i got pregnant. It really made me realize that he's not who i thought he was. Since then he's been verbally and emotionally abusive. We had a long talk last night and i ended up telling him I'll give him another chance.....before i talked to him I was ready to move out this weekend. Anyone have any advice on how to work things out? Or if I even should try to work things out? I lost alot of the love and respect I had for him and I'm not sure if I can get it back. I want it to work out....mostly because of my son....but I also don't want my son growing up thinking that the way his dad acts is ok. Help! Neither one of us is very good at communicating but I'm trying. He usually just brushes off anything serious I tell him so he's very difficult to talk to

20090223141109AA5kEv4	Family & Relationships;Friends	How can i be more positive?	arhh i feel so depressed. and it worries me that i am not motivated at all for my gcses which are in a couple of months. i have stopped doing work unless its in for like the next day, and i just really can't be bothered. i just watch tv and go on the internet, and i'm always just so bored. i don't pay attention in class and i'm lacking behind. i think it might be cos i have a really low self esteem, i hate going out because i'm so fat (my bmi is like 27/28) and i have sensitive skin so can't wear make up as much. i have some good friends, but i have recently drifted apart from one of them, which is also sad cos i used to tell her anything. i have a really bad social life, i rarely go out at weekends etc. and i prefere to stay in anyway because of the way i look, i get really stressed before i go out. i only feel comfortable in school uniform really. but yeah i worry a lot, but recently i just lack motivation about anything in my life. perhaps also the realisation that no one will ever fancy me beacause of how i look. so the only way i think things could get better is if i get thin? but i keep trying then it just all goes wrong after a couple of days... but anyway please help, i really don't want to fail my gcses, and be so depressed that my life is just a complete waste of time like i feel like now. i feel i can't tell anyone at home  or friends, the one who is supposed to be my bestt friend just makes fun of me and tells everyone anything anyway.

I haven’t gone to see him because I cant stand the sight of my sister in law. She has been very disrespectful to my family and especially to my mom (long story). My nephew has hospitalized on Friday, and I asked my brother to give me info and let me know when I can go visit I did say preferably when his wife isnt there.. well he never returned my calls even when I asked him for the room #. he told my mom he hasn’t called me because I said I wouldn’t visit if his wife was there!!  I didn’t say those exact words and if I had no other option, I would still visit my nephew. Im so upset at my brother for not making the effort to call me and the wife has also made it hard for my brother to let us see the other kids... she's really evil and this is why Im so upset at him for allowing this behavior. Well, now my nephew is in the hospital (more for evaluation) and although i know he's ok, I feel obligated to go see him.. and I cant stand the sight of my sister in law.. Because of the recent things she has done to my mom and family. what should I do?

I just found out that my ex was so depressed he skipped lunch. Now i feel like a jerk.      Anyways to get over this???? I feel really bad.
20090223134745AAbXDDt	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why would my friend act like this?	Well, let's start off with a story: My friend is only 3 days older than me, and our parents have known each other since before we were born. She also lives right across the street from my grandma! (You can see how we met). I've LITERALLY known this girl all my life! We're 14 now.   I used to live with my grandma in kindergarten and we'd play after school almost every day. We were the best of best friends could get.      Well, I moved away since then, only about an hour away. It's also the closest major town, so we go there often, especially to visit my grandma. Well, last summer I spent 2 weeks at my grandma's house and at this point in time I hadn't seen my friend in 6 months. So, her mom has her run an errand over here and she comes in, gives my grandma something, and leaves. She doesn't say "hi" to me or anything. She didn't even LOOK at me directly (like acknowledge I was there) , but I'm sure she saw me, it's not possible she didn't. And no, she wasn't in a hurry, she has no excuses there. When she left she kinda skipped down the driveway a little.    Then the next day her and her mom were cooking dinner. She likes to cook. Well anyway, they were out of corn and my grandma had me run some over there for them. My friend was acting all silly around me now. Talking in a slightly silly tone of voice, and acting goofy. Then when she went to go back inside (we met halfway in her driveway) she kinda did more of a skip then a walk. By now I'm just confused.      We hardly ever hang out anymore because we don't live close by and she's never at home. Between school, homework, sports, after-school stuff, church, church activities, this, that, and more. She's always busy. We used to hang out more than this shortly after I moved, but now it's starting to get were we don't hang out as much... And whenever we do have the chance to hang out we never end up doing it. I really miss my friend and I'm wondering why she's acting like this. When we actually do get to hang out, it's just like the old days when we were best friends. We can talk about anything, but after that we usually don't see each other for long periods of time. We're still friends technically I guess, but it's definitely not like it was.      Now it's been over a year since I've hung out with her, yet we've had a chance to do so last summer, and a few times after that. (By hanging out I mean that I was out of coke to drink, and me and my grandma were outside. Then my friend and her mom were outside, and they were going to the convenience store to get some things. So my grandma sent me with them. When we got back home I grabbed a seat on their front porch and watched her and her mom strip the finish off of a dresser because they were redoing my friend's room. We hardly talked at all, it was pretty awkward.) If you call that "hanging out" then you're pretty lame. I haven't "hung out" with my friend since.      I even asked her if she had a boyfriend while her mom walked away for a second, and she replied, "No." in a VERY quiet voice, not saying anything after that. I did notice she was smiling a little, but NOT out of embarrassment, she was smiling more out of enjoyment. Don't ask me why, I have no idea.       What really gets me is that we've never had a fight. EVER! I can remember only one time in like, 1st. grade. We were playing hide-n-seek. I counted to 20 and she hadn't found a place to hide yet, and I instantly tagged her. So she got mad and we started arguing about what number to count to. When that's your biggest fight, you know you're good friends. That's why I don't understand all of this.         Also, one time when we were like 9 or 10 she came over to play and we went into the playroom. After hanging out for a while she grabs a stuffed toy and starts hitting me with it. It had hard-plastic eyes and I told her it hurt. And all the did was giggle and kept on hitting me.      I know that's like, 100% flirting, but we were only 10 at the most!      So the most recent time I saw her my grandma goes in the laundry room which is were she now keeps the toy chest. I saw the stuffed toy she "beat me up with" and it jogged my memory. So I grab it and confront her about it. I said, "Do you remember this? You beat me up with this!"      She said, "Did I? Are you sure? I don't remember it."      I reply, "Yeah I'm sure! You don't remember? Seriously?"      Then she's like, "Nope! I do a lot of things I don't remember."      She had the same smile and the same silly tone of voice as before, like she was happy I brought it up. I thought this was really weird. (but that could be a good thing...)      When we do hang out every now and then we're still good friends and get along fine. She's never said anything about not wanting to be friends, and she's always nice. That's why I don't get it.

Im in a situation where I feel that my father doesn't want a relationship with me, even though that's what I always wanted. There was an incident where one of my ex friends played around on the phone and tried to ruin my dad's relationship based on some false rumors, but he believed the rumors and lashed out on me! He felt dumb becuz he realized that it wasn't true. Since the incident, he acts funny towards me, Doesn't speak to me until he's spoken to. He even tries to show my other brothers and sisters attention in order to make me feel left out and jealous. He also never had my back in anything, and even feels that no one else should because I am an adult. He seems cold hearted and very selfish as well. I thought we solved our issues, so whatever it is he should be over it. Should i still bother worrying about our relationship, or just give up?

20090223133846AAveoTU	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My wife wants a job, is she being ridiculous?	My wife has informed me that she is sick and tired of living a life of leasure., and wants to get a job, such as working in a supermarket (whatever that is) or an office.   We basically live off the profits of my forbears, to put it frankly, I've never worked a day and naturally my wife spends her time going out to her clubs and shopping etc, leaving me to my own pursuits. Now, she wants to join the gutter classes and earn some paltry wage. Is she sick in the head? Has the world lost it's kilter? I feel the comfortable dynamic of our relationship will be thrown if she becomes a common worker.

20090223134305AAJFvNJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I like this guy....a lot?	Okay so there is this guy in my grade(we are in 9th grade) I like a lot. He is in my bio class 4th period and gym class 5th period. These are the only classes we have together. I really like him. I like him more than I have ever liked a crush before. I don't think he knows that I like him but I would never tell him that or ask him out. He has shown signs that he likes me. The other day, the day before valentine's day, I had a key chain that made a whistling noise when you clicked it. I kept doing it and he was getting annoyed and he took it. Know, he is a lot taller than me so he put it on this shelf that I couldn't reach on top of. Then he took it down a few minutes later and still wouldn't give it back not matter how many times I asked for it. Then these two girls and these 2 guys that he is sort of a little friends with all were saying stuff like "Wow, (his name) you need to get a new tactic for flirting" and "Your failing at flirting." Then he gave it back to me and didn't talk to me for the rest of class. What do you think I should do. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

He was unemployed for the most part of 2 years, causing foreclosure on the home that I bought on my credit.  Not that he couldn't get a job, just that he WOULDN'T.  He drinks whenever he is home alone, and sometimes when he has our son with him.  I hate him for that.  He spends NO time with our son, and we have lived in a new apartment (that I rented) since December.  We have slept together ONCE since then - he won't even come to bed!  I spend most nights with my son, other times alone, wishing I could get the guts up to give him the papers already!  I have them, have paid for them, I just can't get myself to give them to him.  I guess I'm afraid that my son won't see his father anymore.  He has other children, and they had no father, either.  Please kick me in the butt!

20090223133825AAvN9XE	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is this guy interested in me or not? I am confused. Please help.?	Hi. I have been talking to this guy and I wanted to know if he was interested in me or not. We were supposed to meet up this past Saturday, but unfortunately I had to cancel on him. The reason was my aunt passed away recently and my whole family was going to visit her at the grave and I was going to spend time with the family after. I told the guy the reason and he understood.       At night on saturday, around 11:30pm, the guy texts me asking "hey did you have a good time with your family?"      We texted back and forth a few times, and he said he was out drinking because it was one of his friend's birthday. In one text he sent me, he said something like "i was just thinking of you.."      after the last text, he calls me. it's loud in the background so i had a hard time hearing him so he steps outside where it's all quiet. he asks me how my day was and how understands how hard it must be about my aunt. I asked him if he was drunk, and he said he was just a little buzzed. He didn't sound drunk at all. He sounded normal like how we usually talked. We talked briefly and we hung up.      The next day, at night, we talked briefly online. But he says he's sorry for the "drunk call." He says he remembers calling me but he doesnt remember anything he said. So I said it was okay. We talked briefly and the conversation turned to how long ago he broke up with his ex gf. He said they broke up a month ago. I said the breakup is pretty fresh then. He replies saying this was like their 5th breakup so it's not that fresh.      This is where I am confused. He says hes sorry for drunk calling me and doesnt remember what he said. So him calling me was just drunk calling? I felt a little disappointed because i thought he actually called in his normal state of mind, but he doesnt remember the conversation. Also, the breakup is pretty fresh meaning, he may not have any interest in me? they were together for 4 months though. he told me the physical attraction may be there, but there was no chemistry between them. what does that mean? i'm already interested in him, but i dont want to invest my heart in someone who is not interested and who is fresh off from a breakup. please help.      **   He texts me this morning saying good morning and how the traffic is so bad and how he hopes i have a great monday.
20090223133857AADS8jV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Me and my bf had been going out for 1yr and 8months. Everything had been going so well and were always...?	...enjoying each others company. No fights! Until after our 1yr anniversary. Our relationship went upside down and most of the time it was my fault. He used to be very arrogant but he had changed. Instead. I would start making arguments out of something small and blame him even if it was my fault and always would be the first to break up with him. He would always take the blame and try to resolve and end the fight and get back with me. He always tells me he loves me. This kept happening until we reached our ‘peak’. At this point, he had enough of my behavior and became arrogant again. He would start showing attitude, talk over me all the time, especially when we are arguing and it was my turn to speak, he always assumed, and HUNG UP on me nearly every time we were arguing on the phone. This had been going on for about 4 and half months after our 1 yr anniversary. After all our break ups and make ups we finally sat down and had a long discussion. We both knew we wanted each other really badly, but didn’t have a clue why we both behaved so badly. Anyway, we resolved everything and agreed on a few things. My action plan was to not make big fights out of small issues, to respect him, to be calm when an argument arises. His was to put his arrogance aside, don’t blame anyone, don’t talk over when the other is speaking, and DON’T hang up the phone when arguing ‘just like that’! we promised we would work realyy hard and he said he would never hang up on me again, or end the relationship. it worked for me. Ever since then iv been working on my self and I do try to see things from a broader picture. I must admit, he has also tried to work it out, but his arrogance is still there. And that was shown today.    We were talking and having a discussion when he suddenly started to assume that I was being moody towards him :S that was totally out of the blue. He suddenly stated that my mood has changed and that im becoming uptight. I had no intentions though!! Anyway the argument then dragged as I got heated that hes assuming for no reason. Every time I spoke and tried to explain myself he talked over me, and even on the phone he hung up on me numerous times AGAIN!!!! He broke he darn promise AGAIN! Then after calming down, when we decided to speak again, I was still a little heated from before, but every time I spoke he just laughed at me. I told him to stop and he continued and said ‘am not laughing at you, it’s the situation im laughing at’. But he kept laughing arrogantly, and just so disrespectfully. I had enough of what he playing at so I just said to him that I don’t want to be with him anymore. His reaction, he said: ‘its your call’!!!! although he did follow me around for a while telling me to stop and talk but at that point I had no intentions to. I don’t know what to do. I love this guy but his arrogant and jerky behaviour is getting too much. He also texted me twice quite disrespectfully and carelessly. From inside I know hes still angry-but at what???? Does he still love me? I want him in my life but I don’t know if he change :’( hes promised so many times and I just don’t know what to do. We were planning to get married in the future, and I know wel be so happy :’( but I don’t know what to do. Please help me someone and I apologise for writing a long essay ? thank you..i appreciate it ? x (btw he does do a lot for me though. hes sacrificed so much for me, including time to spend with his freinds and family. i never encouraged him to but he always said he wants to as he enjoy spening time with me. he comes from a v.respectful family and can be v. caring and loving and is v. different in some way-in a good way).

I am dating this guy I like and he really likes me too (although sometimes he is so extrovert I'd actually wonder if he isn't faking it), although I know for sure he's playing hard to get and I don't want to 'satisfy' his ego straight away by telling him my true feelings.   He often asks me if I think of him, and I do, but I always got away with saying stuff like 'Maybe', 'Most Probably', 'Sometimes'. Are there any ways to reply in a witty way, make him understand he is actually on my mind but without exposing myself too much?   Thanks in advance.

There's this girl that I know and usually it's obvious if girls like me but she's a stunner, good personality and generally a very nice person and when I see here I literally get mega nervous, I've never been like this around any girl I've ever met and I just find it very strange but funny how I feel in a way scared to approach her. I get along with her friends and I hardly know her but we text alot, basically every day, but I am finding it extremely hard to figure out whether she likes me or not. She always seems very quiet when I've come into contact with her but I've seen her out with her friends and she's the opposite.      Shal we say I need some ADVANCED pointers to be able to tell if she wants to be friends or more because I'm really confused!

20090223134359AA7P1SD	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is my fiance being unreasonable or am i ?	Recently my fiance has met up with some old friends and started taking drugs with them, just pot at first but then speed too. He started smoking pot more and more until he couldnt seem to go a day without it.  When he wasnt stoned he began treating me very badly, getting quite agressive and intimidating me.  It got to the point where we nearly split up several times but i always took him back because he promised he would stop.  But he kept doing it behind my back and when i ask him to stop he calls me a control freak and says i am completely wrong to expect him to stop taking drugs when its what he wants to do.      On top of this, hes now spending  pretty much all his time with his mates, he sees them literally every day for hours on end, and when i say i dont want them in the house any more he says he wil just go out with them instead then.  For the last couple of weeks we have been arguing a lot about the amount of time he spends with them and how little time we now spend together.  Today i was at work all day and he was out with his mates drinking all afternoon in a park like a couple of 14 yr olds in my opinion.  When i got home he told me after half an hour he was going back out with his mates and when i got upset about this he again started callin me a control freak and saying im not goin to stop him seein his mates.      I dont expect him to not see them, just to not se them so often because i dont feel that you can be in a serious relationship with someone and act this way.  He left anyway and told me he didnt care how upset he had made me.      I think hes being selfish and unreasonable but he thinks its me that is a controlling *****, so i was just wondering what some unbiased opinions would be about this ?

He is divorced and has 2 kids who are 4 and 7. I know it is impractical because of age but is it impossible? I like him a lot and I know he feels the same way. He is a great person and a great father. I was wondering what your reactions are about this relationship. I know people get weirded out by the age difference and I have no idea how I'll break it to my parents but it feels like the right thing despite all the negativity towards it. Is anyone else in a similar situation as mine? Did it work out for them?

20090223135716AA1hSrp	Family & Relationships;Friends	I'm sixteen & moving to Ohio...?	I've lived in New Jersey ever since i was seven, and it's been my home for such a long time that I can't imagine living anywhere else. I live in a town in Bergen County, and it's very pleasant, safe, and there is a lot of suburban types of things to do (malls, movies, ect). Plus, I've known the kids I go to school with for many years and have established some very close friendships.       My mom got remarried and my stepdad lives in Ohio with his kids. I am an only child and just turned sixteen. Currently, I am in the middle of my sophomore year at my high school and when will move in the summer.       The pros that I can thing of are that a)I can drive earlier as Ohio doesn't have the GDL restrictions that NJ has, 2) the house is beautiful and I love my room, 3)I get to start over & meet new people.       Unfortuenelty, I am so so so nervous. I was there this past weekend and all the kids are alot different than I assumed. It might sound stereotypical, but mostly all of them were white, blonde, and wore hollister. I am Indian, although I always get comments about how I really dont seem indian. Plus, I have already grown out of my Hollister phase and now prefer stores like Forever 21.       I would be a junior in my new school (which is HUGE; twice the size of my old school) and I really dont want my junior/senior year to suck. How do I make new friends? What should I do to make this a successful move? What are some do and donts as the new kid? How do I essentially restart my life, in a place so different than mine? (I'd like to add that the town I'd live in [Strongsville] is very suburban and is not at all like what people think of when they think of Ohio).       Ahh. So many dilemmas.

20090223140012AALiOJz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Question about relationships...?	Ok so I have realized I have a slight problem...when I am in a relationship, no matter what happens, it seems I always worry about them wanting to break up with me.  My previous relationship, I was in for nearly 2 years and I would ask him all the time if he wanted to break up with me.  Now I have a new boyfriend, and we have been dating about a week...how do I keep from thinking and worrying that he wants to break up with me?  I don't know why I always think that..I mean me and my new boyfriend have a really good time together...but no matter what, with any boyfriend I have I always have a feeling that they want to break up with me...for any given reason....how do I stop that?  I just want to enjoy myself...thanks for your help

So I have been friends with this kid for about 6 years and he is not the coolest he's poor and dirty but he as a nice kid, i am rich and nice and caring, i met a new group of friends throughout 5th and came rreally close with them in 6th and so did he but the bad thing is they changed me a bit but he changed to, so one day i send him an email with a funny APPROPRITA pic. he said "Stop or i will report you to spam" and then i said what is wrong with you lately? then he replied that i was a terrible friend ( which i never was i was his only best friend and so nice to him) so he was friends with this really other gross kid that is to nasty for words which he would sit with us at lunch then scare my friends away so i asked him not to let him sit there so he also menchined that to and he also said none of my friends will ever stay my friends then i told him he was crazy, then the teacher found out and then he was lieing to her but i just let it go, then one day i went up to him and told him and said this " hey um i would really appriciate if you would stop talking beihide my back its rude!" and he said well i just want to punch you right now (hes scrawny so i wasn'tt scared) i said WELL GO AHEAD YOU DON't THINK I WANT TO, then my friends saved me hahaha then a week later i handed out b-day invites and got pissed off that i didn't give him one so he told the teacher then i pooled him and the teacher both outside and i said, " i did not giv you an invite because were not friends why would i do that?" then at the last week of school, he told the teacher for a stupid reason which was a lie and made my best friend cry over it. so yea now were  not friends anymore and i don't mind it... and for some reason hes scared on me, but now i have the best friends ever i could even ask, so i think i took it pretty good, how would you have done or handled this?

20090223140407AAeY3ij	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I lied to my boyfriend and now I feel bad what do I do?	My boyfriend and I were broken up for a couple of months and during that time I had sex with this guy he didn't like. I didn't think it was a big deal since we were broken up at the time and I didn't think he would ever find out about it since it happened like last summer but today him and the other guy got into an arguement and it came up. Then they got into a fist fight because my boyfriend thought he was lying but later on he asked me about it and I told him it didn't happen. Now, I feel like I shouldn't have done that. Should I go back and tell the truth or just let it go?

20090223140447AA1zg13	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Help me people, Who is best for me?	Okay, so I know this guy at my scout unit called Harry. He is really cute and the nicest guy ever he's a year younger then me, but he is really nice. I have liked him now for about 3 months. but only until the previous saturday, did he start to show an interest and start flirting with me. Don't get me wrong I like that, but there's a complication. There's another boy I like too. This guy goes to my school, Alex, but tbh we only ever speak on msn, becuase we are both quite shy. But he really does flirt a lot over msn and he keeps looking at me and stuff at school. So there both really nice guys and I like them both, but tbh, I honestly cannot decide which one I would be better off with and who I like most, which do you think is best for me?      Please help   thanks   xx

You have their number and want to call them but you are busy.  When does 'busy' become 'rude'?      What about an email?  Again, from someone you know and want to talk to.      Just curious to hear the opinions of those I don't know as this causes tension between myself and someone I care about.      They live in another city so email and phone are our main forms of communication.      Thanks
20090223140656AAiMpUC	Family & Relationships;Family	Two week ultimatum for a 17 yr old. What ideas do you have?	My brother in-law is 17 and has lived with us for 2 years now. I am  25 my partner is 32 and we have 3 small children. My brother in-law goes college 3 half days a week and for the rest of the week he plays computer games, eats and sleeps. No matter how much we try he will not help around the house, help with the children or help out financially. Two weeks ago we had a long talk with him and explained how hard we're finding it to make the mortgage payments and feed and clothe everyone is this house.  We gave him a two week ultimatum to provide us with physical evidence i.e a letter of refusal, acceptance or acknowledgment of a job application. The two weeks is over tomorrow, we already know he has made no effort and has already said he'll be happy to accept the consequence. 1 problem we don't know what the consequence should be. I think we need something drastic. We've tried taking the computer away but he gets mean to our 3 young children, we've tried giving specific computer time but again that didn't work. He needs to learn the value of money and how hard it is to earn money in the first place.   Whilst I was writing this he just asked for a new monitor because he's one has just blown up!!!! Even though I told him  we only just made the mortgage payment  this month.       Please help! Any suggestions?

20090223141511AAdzwOo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am i reacting normally to her?	Recently my gf has started asking far more intimate questions such as what do my friends and i discuss about girls and say about them such as for example "boobs" and things such as that and also asking thing like who would i sleep with if i had to out of three of her friends. Our relationship is a complete secret so i dont get shy about coming out on which of her friends i would like if i had to, even though i never would of course!          i get quite shy and resistant to tell her on the phone and she always says "oh come on" "open up!" even though if i was to ask her the same questions she would never dream of telling me!    is she just trying to tease me because she knows i'm shy about these things?

20090223142042AAJGwfJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	HELP WITH THIS PLEASE> ITS ABOUT A GIRL...?	So i met this girl when i was about 14 and we would always flirted and kiss but nithing more. she wanted me to take her virginity but i wouldnt do it becouse everytime we had the oppertunity she was drunk and i liked her and wanted it to be a good experience and not just a drunken lay. so we never had sex and eventually lost contact with eachother. its 8 years later now and i see her in a bar. didnt say anything but noticed she kept looking over. about an hour later she comes up to the table and asks me to dance. right away we seemed to hit it off again so we exchanged numbers and went out again the next night. We ended up having sex that night and the next day i hungout with her and had lunch. she called me that night and i went out with her and her friends. she got so wasted she was hittin on me and at the last second took another dude home. i got pissed off and told her not to call me anymore. she called me the next day and apologized and said she didnt do anything with him and didnt even remember like hitting on him. so again we hungout that night. just sat at my place and watched movies and then no sex just cuddled. the next morning we had sex in the shower and i wasnt giving my best performance. about ten minutes after we finnished she left. she told me that she would call me and hasnt yet. Ive always been in relationships so i guess i dont really remember how this works but i dont want to come off as desperate because im not but i do like her and do want her to know that i dont just want sex out of this deal. I really do enjoy her company and her beauty. had i not know her before i wouldnt tell her yet but since I knew her and had feelings for her is it to early to tell her still or would it be ok and not make me look like a loser? and from what i told you do you think that she likes me or just wants sex? she is also very pretty and could probably get any guy she wanted.
20090223142247AAvpHkO	Family & Relationships;Friends	My friend dosen't know that I can't stand her?	I deleted her from my myspace several months ago and she didn't know why      I never got up the nerve to tell how how I really feel about her because it will hurt her      But I think she's lazy, dumb, and all she cares about is guys and partying. She lives with her mom she's almost 26 and isn't working. When I came to visit in August all she cared about was herself and didn't care I missed my flight because she was too lazy to get out of bed.      Was I totally wrong for what I did?

20090223143323AAxestU	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How bad is my situation?	I fell in love with an alcoholic/drug addict with whom i had a relationship with for (1 month). Then he suddenly started avoiding me. In the meantime I found out I am pregnant with his baby.       It took me 2 weeks before I could get in contact with him to tell him. He claims he will be there for the baby but now another week has gone by and I have not heard from him again.      I am a 22 year old college graduate with a bachelor's degree. I have a decent job (I make $15/hr), a car, and an apartment. I still love this guy and therefore feel some type of way for the little embryo inside me.       However, logic is telling me that my best option is to abort since the baby's father obviously has no intrest in me or the baby. I fear that having this child will compromise both my job and future relationships as I will not be able to devote the time needed to thoes areas of my life once I am a single mother.      Please advise!

20090223143832AA99mlx	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How to tell a guy you just aren't that into him?	Ok, I dated a guy for about 5 months and honestly, I dragged it out too long.  He was the nicest, sweetest guy and that's why I stayed so long...I kept waiting for the feelings to show up.  They never did. I really wanted to like him, but we just didn't click - or I guess I didn't feel the click.  Part of me thinks he had some feminine qualities and this is partly the reason I couldn't get into him I suppose.  He wants to talk tonight about why I want to end things...we only chatted very briefly about it before.  How do you let a man down gently that you just weren't into him without really hurting his feelings?  By the way...I am in my 30's so didn't want to post in singles and dating...it's all teens over there.  Thank you!

20090223122204AAAu1kv	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Men: Would you confess if there was no hard proof?	Last week I found text messages on my husbands phone by accident from a girl that works for the same company. The message said "u coming to the fights" and was signed with her name. He was supposed to be going to a 'meeting' out of town on the night she was referring to.       It has been obvious to me for a long time that there was an attraction between my husband and this other woman but I trusted him and didn't suspect anything (until now). But I did tell him that I was uncomfortable with it. When I asked him about the text he said he didn't know why she sent it to him and he also said that they don't text any other time. I let it go. But still suspicious I pulled up our cell records and found out that they text very often and have been for as far back as I could look (October). Last month there were 24 exchanges between the two of them. When I confronted him with that he apologized and said that they were only exchanging jokes and nothing more. He said he didn't tell me when I asked him because I would be mad. (great defense!) I don't believe him. I left for a few days to think things over and I still don't believe him even though he swears up and down that there is nothing going on. I even called the "other woman" from his phone when he was sitting there and confronted her. She denied any involvement.      My question to men is would you confess cheating if your wife didn't have solid proof?

Imagine a conversation between a father ,Sylvester and son,Harry,   Sylvester : “Harry, I always wanted to give you quality education so that you stand on your own feet.”   Harry : “ Am I not standing on my own feet ? Do you see me carrying any crutches ?”   Sylvester : “ Jokes apart Harry, I meant I wanted to see you doing a decent job .”   Harry : “ Oh come on Dad! don’t start over that crab all over again”   Sylvester : “ Harry ! how can you call my talk crab ? Just look at yourself, you are a commerce graduate but you still have not learnt any manners of talking to your parents”   Harry : “ Huh! I grew up watching you talking to my grandparents in that manner. Can’t help it.”   Sylvester : “ Harry ! I warn you to stay in your limits. Talk to me with respect ”   Harry : “ Limits! Oh no Dad I think you have crossed all limits, see how obese you have grown and according to me your obesity has begun to affect your thinking ability.”   At this the Sylvester slaps Harry and silently leaves the room. Harry remains in his room in a state of anger and after a hour or so he goes out to visit his friend Alfred.   Harry : “ That was so selfish of my parents to treat my grand parents that way”   Alfred : “ I agree with you Harry on that one”   Harry : “ My Dad was never grateful to his parents for having given him such good education. It bites me from inside when I think of this.”   Alfred : “ Do you go to visit your grandparents ?”   Harry : “ Yeah ! I do. I carry with me some roses and some fruits when I go to visit them on their weekends.”   Alfred: “ That’s nice. What do they tell you when you go there ?”   Harry: “ They tell me that I should not become like my father and that I should see that I always remain grateful for whatever my parents have done for me.”      Is harry a responsible youngster or psychologically affected ?
20090223124831AA8VOP1	Family & Relationships;Family	I'm a little concerned about this.....I don't know whats going on?	Okay my Grandfather called me today and he was upset.      He asked for a movie back that I borrowed when I lived back home (well for one he told me to hold onto it as long as I want and two I thought I gave it back to him)      I borrowed this movie like when I was like 18.   I have moved 3 times since.   And back before i moved away from home that is the last time I remember anything about it.      So now he is mad....(keep in mind I'm 23 now so a few years have passed) because he went to watch it the other day and it wasn't there.  And he said I have it.      And he said my grandmother thought she saw it at my last apartment.   Well even if she did I don't have it now.    I went through all my movies.  And I told him I don't have it and he got even more mad.      I don't understand why he is getting mad...he used to never get angry.   He had a mild stroke 2 years ago and that changed him a bit but not like this.      If I can't find this movie what can I do (its not a movie that I can just go to the store to pick up a copy....it was a special thing that he ordered a long time ago)      And why would he be so upset.....especially now.      What can I do....and is he okay?

The problem is that I'm starting to get late notices and twice I already skipped school with them. My dad told me that I should start to get my head straight because that is not a way to behave.   I know that, but doesn't make it any easy..    I DON'T WANT TO BECOME IRRESPONSABLE,   but when they [my group of friends] ask me if I wanna hang out with them at my house/ skip school, etc. I don't want to get left out and I end always agreeing with them...   I need help on speaking myself out without worrying what the others might do or think and concentrate on school.. how??   Help, I'm really stressing out ;__;

20090223143935AA7XEvo	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	We keep having the same fights..Am I staying around for something that is domed to end?	My boyfriend and I argue all the time. I mean all the time about the same things. He do not like the fact that I dated other people in the past ( weird I know). The other night he brought up my "past" and said something to the effect of " If you were raised in another country you would not be the way you are" (I'm assuming he means out spoken and having dated other people before he came into my life.) After listening to him rant on about how I am and how I'm no different them any other woman in America.   I proceeded to tell him to ,"shut up." Needless to say we got off the phone and haven't really spoken to each other since last night.   So I guess my question is, we have been together for about 2 1/2 years and we keep having the same arguments, why?    We have tried talking and just when I think we have resolved these issues, they come up again.    Obviously this relationship is not all bad all the time, there are very good aspects to the relationship, hence why we have been together for 2 1/2 years ( on and off)  and by no means am I alleviating myself of fault. I have things I need to work on but I want to know if I am trying too hard for something that will inevitably end anyway.

20090223123832AAMazgc	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do I get back the love of my life? Any advice?	About 9 months ago, an almost too good to be true man fell head over heals in love with me. He really pursued me, laying it on very heavy. I got so many things like weekly corny postcards exclaiming his love with me, daily emails, wonderful trips around France and Europe. We had many, many long walks around Paris, kissing constantly while walking down the street. So heavenly. He was calling me daily on the phone for the first few months. This happened while I was spending some time in France living in the countryside while he lives in Paris. (I'm an American who lives in London, England usually.) At some point he asked that I come to Paris for a few months. At first, I was hesitant and this really made him upset! You see at this point I was on a year career break from my job in London and I was volunteering at a Buddhist meditation centre in France, and I needed to leave the meditation centre for a few months. I was planning to go back to London, but he really pursued that I come to Paris with him. He couldn't bear the thought I would leave France. At this time he would say he wanted nothing but having me by his side for as long as possible. He told me he never felt both a "heart connection" with feelings of passion to a woman before. We share the same Buddhist teacher, so this gives us a lot in common, too. And this is one reason why I let my guard down so early and made a crazy leap. Otherwise, I tend to run far away from men who are overly passionate, too soon. It's a little nauseating for me.  And I have been in a couple other passionate relationships that last only a couple months and fizzle after the passion goes.  So I don't trust passion at all!  But he was just so incredible and seductive. He's rich, smart, suave, chic, charming, sexy, cheerful, and he become so gorgeous to me. The love-making was the best I had ever experienced. It was just incredible when we first met. I have never felt that way in my whole life of 34 years! We even met at an "auspicious" (meaningful coincidence) abhisheka (Tibetan Buddhist initiation ceremony) and this supposedly gave a lot of meaning and instant connection between the both of us. He was ready to say "I love you" just a month after we met. But I couldn't bear to hear this so early, so instead because I told him not to say those words, he kept repeating "I like you", maybe thinking it was the equivalent of the French "Je t'aime." So after 4 months of knowing each other, and convincing me, seducing me to come to Paris, he paid for an expensive French language course for me (and while paying he said what a bargain, only 3,000 euros to have the love of his life by his side for a few months). And I agreed to live with him temporarily in Paris.       Four months after living with him... well things have changed. It was difficult to say the least. But even up until the last day I was living with him, he was still saying I love you and talking about spending his life with me. And now I have moved out and going back to London, it's almost like he wants nothing to do with me right now. But it happened so suddenly and he has only voiced his feelings of not wanting me back in his life after I left. He's Buddhist and more conscious of his relationship patterns... so when I was pushing his buttons... he even mentioned this and he mentioned how he wanted to work on his relationship patterns with me.       But it seems like it is over.      He's 43 years old. Twice divorced with one daughter who lives very far away.       I'm 34 and never married, no children.      I guess I should let go. But I am still very much hurting from this. I don't want to let go. I thought it was the man of my life after everything he said. I never before wanted to marry someone and have their children so intensely. He even spoke about this.  I feel so betrayed.  Sometimes it feels as if my life is over. And then I try to remember that I am an independent woman who didn't need a man before him and still doesn't need one. But my heart is severely broken and I would do anything to get back the love we once had, or another version of it.       Advice?

I'm looking to secure a couple of blocks of rooms at local hotels (San Francisco) for my May wedding.  Does anyone know what kind of discounted rates you can get by doing this?  Is it worth doing, or is it better to give guests 3 or 4 hotel options and have them book through a site like Expedia, Orbitz, etc?
20090223124247AALUueo	Family & Relationships;Friends	I CAN'T TRUST MY BF ON  FACEBOOK!!! WHAT SHOULD I  DO?	My bf and I have been together for 10 months now and recently him and I had a discussion about a girl that I knew from high school. Not only that, but I have opened up to him about my past and what happened to me in high school. After I opened up to him about my past and told him about this girl from high school, he started to search  for her and other people that I went to high school with on face book just so he can make sure that what I told him is the truth and he does this every time I'm not around. Every time I discuss with him the things he does wrong behind my back on face book, all he says is " I don't want to talk about it" and  I told him so many times that I don't like it when he does that behind my back and I've also told him how I truly felt when he does things like that. I even wrote him a lil letter letting him know that he should stop because he's hurting me with what he's doing. There was a time when he added the girl I knew on his friends list on face book and I had to ask her to remove him from her list so that this problem is resolved. But, sadly enough, though she did remove him from her list, he continue to look for her on face book and it is really beginning to affect our relationship.      I just want my boyfriend to realize that if he has uncertainty about what I've told him about my past, he should come to me and talk to me not to my friends or the people that I went to high school with. This was not the first time he's done this and I'm running out of ideas on what to tell him because no matter what I say to him, he will continue to do what he does anyway.      CAN SOMEBODY PLEASE HELP ME WITH MY PROBLEM???       PLEASE GIVE ME A SUGGESTION ON WHAT I CAN DO OR SAY TO MY BOYFRIEND FOR HIM TO STOP LOOKING FOR PEOPLE I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL WITH AND ASKING THEM ABOUT MY PAST IN HIGH SCHOOL.....      I would really appreciate it....thx!!!
