No soy lesbiana en absoluto, pero mi mejor amiga es Rusa y pues en su pais es muy natural besarse en la boca, un beso normal, nada de LENGUAS y pues en el mio TAMBIEN!!   Aqui no es nada del otro mundo darse un besito en la boca, entre amigas para saludar, tambien a los BUENOS amigos se les da un beso en la boca, o sea, no a todos !! solo a los BUENOS, MEJORES amigos, yo tambien siempre saludo a Mis 2 MEJORES amigos con un beso en la boca, igual que a mi amiga, ya es costumbre y algo muy natural para nosotros.      Claro cuando una chica besa a un chico, nadie lo ve mal, pero cuando tambien besa a su amiga en la boca, en algunos Paises ya te ponen la etiqueta de Lesbiana!!      Pero la verdad es que, eso no tiene nada que ver, es parte de la cultura, de cada Pais.      Yo no me escandaliso, es parte de mis raices.   pero y Ustedes? lo hacen? lo han hecho?Que opinan al    respecto?

20090222124540AA3SDqI	Entertainment & Music;Music;Blues	Derek Trucks is arguably the greatest guitarist of his generation.What do you think of his future, his legacy?	Derek Trucks is one of the best guitarists out there, and arguably the greatest guitarist of his generation, and he's still very young, still has a long career ahead of him. What do you think his future will bring?      What do you think his chances of making a big impact on the rock scene are? Do you think he may be inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame when all is said and done? To do that, you usually have to be mainstream. Which brings up another thing to consider.      Do you think Derek Trucks has a chance of going mainstream at all? Or of breaking the top 10? (Which would give him a better chance of the Hall of Fame)      I personally think his chances of going mainstream are very slim. Hopefully he will at the very least keep on progressing with the music he's doing, maybe bring something new to blues-rock, and live to be a legendary blues man.

20090222140338AAmWDvM	Entertainment & Music;Television;Comedy	Teen's experience during the Great Depression!?	Hi! I have to write a narrative fictional essay of The Great Depression, however, I don't want to write about the Stock Market Crash, or the presidential election, I want to write about a teenagers experience of the time. I have chosen my main character to be a young teen, named Kate. I have done some research, but have not gotten a lot of results. I want to story to center around the hardships that she experiences.    This is what I learned from my research:       -Black tuesday      -Roaring twenties      -"flappers"      -apple stands on the street corners      -men leaving home in search of jobs      -hobos/Hoovervilles      -bread lines/soup kitchens      I want part of it to be her comparing her present life to her former priveleged life, but I still need some research, and I am completely clueless as to what the events throughout the story will be, because it can't just be her sulking about being poor. So if you have any ideas as to what the events throughout this story should be, please answer! Also, if you happen to have lived through that time, please share your experience as a child or teen!    Thank you for your time!

20090222151815AAEEDL4	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Why is astrology so popular?	I've been following astrology for years out of sheer fascination. How can a psychological/relationship analysis tool so accurately yet inaccurately describe my love life?      I'm a guy, born in late June (a cancer), and my gf was born in late november (a sagittarius), both within about a week of the beginning of the zodiac sign. I've been perusing articles on astrological predictions concerning relationship strength and durability, as well as checking out personal profiles. Although I find the positive descriptions of both of our signs to be very flattering, they really don't seem to be on the mark.       For starters, people tend to write that Sagittarius is a "free-spirited" zodiac sign that can't be tied down. They make them out to be philosophical party animals that hint at having developed intellects and an insatiable urge to travel. They tend to write that Cancer is a sign that loves to cook, garden and bear/rear their children in a private, shut-in home environment that sounds more like a fortified castle. Cancers are supposed to be jealous in relationships, and Sagittarians are supposed to be indifferent and highly likely to provoke it in their partner. Sagittarians are wild, fun and bouncy cutting-edge people while Cancers are probably better suited to ritualized courtship in medieval Japan given their romantic tendencies, their doting natures and their fiery possessiveness that, surprisingly enough, applies to water signs (like Cancer and Scorpio, but yet not to Pisces) instead of fire signs.       So, the consistencies: We resemble our signs in the following ways:      Me: I love to dote, send flowers and poems, write her songs, dance with her, cook for her, travel and make her laugh. I love taking care of her and massaging her. I love our connection, admire her and think she's the most special person. I would happily work as a cook or nurse if I had the patience, but find new experiences more interesting. I'm very spiritual, intuitive, and feel emotionally/mystically connected to God.      Her: She loves to travel, debate, learn new things, is vivacious, funny, witty, physically active, well read, intelligent, reflective, thoughtful, seeks truth and justice, works in the legal profession, is hard to lie to, loves going out and has many, many friends.       The inconsistencies:      Me: I prefer to be outside, working, studying or traveling, or going out to staying at home alone or in bed. I'm terrible at investing and budgeting, find financial jobs boring and like spending money doing fun things while I'm still young. High-maintenance partners or friends with problems move me to compassion but wear me out in the end. I can't establish a pattern for which signs make me happier: I just like people, or I don't. My friends and partners span the elemental triplicity.      Her: although Sagittarians are noted for being romantically flighty, uncertain, risky and/or unfaithful, she is one of the MOST faithful, devoted, loving, nurturing, caring and doting partners with a clear idea of what she wants. For instance, her first relationship lasted over 7 consecutive years. She really has a way with money, makes it easily and can stretch a penny further than anyone I know. Instead of finding courtship boring she thrives in it. Ours lasted four and a half months. She is a true romantic at heart (like me) and instead of flitting around she holds out for something worthwhile. Otherwise, she's happy to be busy working, studying or hanging out with friends and family. She's independant, but not overly: her biggest fear is probably being rejected and she hates to feel isolated or misunderstood. She's not blunt; she's direct and honest.      We are magnetically attracted, and from the very first second I laid eyes on her I knew she was really special. We are both flexible and adapt to each other's differences, quirks, moods and desires. The more patient we are, the better it gets. We seem to complement each other and understand each other without having to communicate. Why than, I ask, is sun sign astrology so popular? Our profiles don't really match, and we are happy, even if our signs are zodiac "opposites". Easy answer: astrology is bs. But why is it popular? Is there something I'm missing?      Important additional information: My venus and mercury are in gemini, mars in libra, moon in virgo and my ascendant taurus. Her venus and gemini are in sagitarius, mars in libra, her moon capricorn, her ascendant uncertain. Both of our north nodes are in Cancer.      Astrology geniuses: please solve this mystery for me!

20090222154207AAfeJVQ	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Mainstream: State or Sound?	State:     Say a band makes very progressive or long not so radio-friendly songs, but they get lots of play on radio anyway and they are on MTV and the likes. Also they don't give interviews and the like to keep personal, so they aren't going out of their way for more publicity or anything like that, they are just making music. Take Tool for example, they make songs that are around 6-8 minutes on average (radio likes their songs around 3), they stay out of the public eye, and they release albums very spread apart (unlike mainstream bands which release their albums very close and very short).      Sound:    Bands that have a particularly samey sound compared to the rest of what's popular around that time, have high production value, and try as hard as possible for publicity. I'm not sure who to give for an example as I am not a fan of the mainstream sound.... but I guess I'll say Default in the hopes that not many of you have heard them on radio. They have a particularly samey sound when compared to the other post-grunge bands that where everywhere and have a high production value.      So basically I am asking this question to better understand what people consider mainstream to be. So please everyone try to give an answer that reads this :)      Anyway, the main question is, is mainstream to you a       State: being widely known by everyone (no matter how different your sound is)      Sound: sounding like all of the popular bands (no matter your public status)      This took a longgggggggggg time to think out and type, so if I don't get some answers I'm gonna be pissed. And this is for your opinions...... Please mention whether you pick state or sound in your answer.

The rabbit looks at her and says, 'Giraffe my friend, why do you do this? Come with me running through the forest, you'll see, you'll feel so much better!' The giraffe looks at him, looks at the joint, tosses it and goes off running with the rabbit.

Come running with us through the pretty forest, you'll see, you'll feel so good!'

'Lion my friend, why do you do this? Think about your health! Come running with us through the sunny forest, you will feel so good!' The lion looks at him, puts down his needle, and starts to beat the **** out of the little rabbit.   As the giraffe and elephant watch in horror, they look at him and ask, 'Lion, why did you do this? He was merely trying to help us all!'   The lion answers, 'That little ****** makes me run around the forest like an idiot for hours every time he's on ecstasy!'

Hi,      I was just watching the most recent episode of High Altitude on BBC2 (dated 22nd February 2009, 11:00PM-11:30PM), and about halfway through I heard some music I really liked on it. I had a quick look on the BBC website but within the FAQ sections, they said that for most programmes, it is impossible to find the music for their shows, and the BBC forums are hopeless.      Is there a way I can find out what this music was? Would it be worth sending the BBC an email about this? It really frustrates me when I hear something then never hearing it again!      Thanks.      TL;DR - What music was used in High Altitude (22nd February 09, BBC2)?

20090222110908AA2WE8t	Entertainment & Music;Other - Entertainment	Will there ever be new musical instruments?	I know it may sound stupid but I have always wondered this: why do musical instruments basically stay the same in their basic design throughout time? Guitars, drums, keyboards, etc. I am NOT talking about the performance of each instrument (it is pretty much clear that instruments become more and more efficient throughout time). I am talking about the design, the shape. Have we reached the summit of musical instrument design? is that why guitars (for example) will always be shaped the way they are? Are the instruments fully ergonomic and so they are now destined to stay unchanged until our human body changes? Will we see rock bands in the year 2500 still playing the same kind of drums and guitars that ALL bands still play (guitars hanging from their necks with one hand on the "neck" and the other on the "bridge", or banging circular drums with sticks)? Will instruments ever change their shape significantly? Have we invented all musical instruments there can ever be invented?

It has been a long while since I have heard any songs by country singer, Jack Ingram. Did he quit singing after he made the deadly country song that was meant to be rock only "Lips of an angel?"       I know he made an appearance on CMT with Miranda Lambert's "Gunpowder and Lead" live video, but have not heard any songs lately by himself.      I used to like him a lot back before he made "Lips of An Angel." My favorite songs were "Love You" and "Wherever You Are"       I am not really trying to come back as a fan or anything to him as one former fan of his, I am still yet disgraced at him making "Lips of an angel." Darn guy should have just let that song be to Hinder. Alls I want to know is if he is still making it into concerts, selling albums, etc.      Thanks for any good information.

20090222121955AAmVNsH	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	What are some musicians that are known for being fun and goofy on stage?	People always talk about musicians like Axl Rose who constantly get mad and throw hissy fits on stage but who are some musicians who look like they are actually having lots of fun on stage.      My example of this would be Adam D from Killswitch Engage.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlfCaJR_0...    Just look at this video, hes wearing a cape, short shorts, and a tank top! XD Also you can just see the looks on his face and body movements that just tell how much fun he's having.      Oh and a little side info about that video, that was actually filmed at a place I see pretty much all the shows I see at. I just thought I would say that cause it's kind of cool. haha         MQ: What are your thoughts on Killswitch Engage?    I hear mixed things so I want to see what everyone thinks. I myself am a big fan of them.

Eri and Harima ( I think they fit each other, but sometimes harima and yakumo is somehow good with each other too. )      3. Mikoto and Hannai ( I think it is ok since yakumo doesn't like hannai, and mikoto's senpai already had a girlfriend...besides, they are childhood friends)      4. Karen and Imadori ( I don't know, i just think they fit with each other.)      5.

20090222120955AABEh71	Entertainment & Music;Radio	Why does Yahoo Radio take away from the listening experience with 5 minutes of ads every 10 minutes?	I used to enjoy Yahoo radio while I worked - streaming audio with current music to inspire me with creativity. Now, I'm interrupted every 10 minutes with commercial after commercial. I honestly thought that big companies were learning how to use the Internet as a new medium and eliminating the old captive audience form of advertising. It's too bad a company with such a wide range of consumer data can use it to hold its audience hostage!      Wake up Yahoo! It's 2009 and we don't want to be forced to hear/see ads anymore!

In the story duo is the son of Hiei and Kurama, while heero is the son of Yusuke and Keiko.  Both sons are kidnapped by doctor J when they are young and turned into experiments/hitmen for the cruel doctor.  The sons and their fathers meet up again at the new Dark Tournament, along with teh other three pilots.

Lyrics:      [Robin Thicke talking]   We are at war with the universe, the sky is falling   And the only thing that can save us now   Is sensitivity and compassion      [Singing]   Daa da da, da da da daa da da   Daa da da, da da da daa da da      [Talking]   But I know one thing's for sure   I'm gonna get my kicks before it all burns down      [Lil Wayne]   Yeah   Some say tragedy's hard to get over   But sometimes that tragedy means it's over   Soldier, from the academy league of rollers   I deny being down though they seem to hold us   My, shoulders are strong I prove 'em wrong   I ain't doing nothing but moving on   Let the truth be known   But they talked that freedom at us   And didn't even leave a ladder, damn      [Robin Thicke]   I work at the corner store   We all got problems, problems   No one's gonna fly down low   No one's gonna save us now    How you feel you're not alone   We're all just jealous, jealous   We don't reach the sky no more   We just can't overcome, no      [Chorus: Robin Thicke]   You tie my hands what am I gonna be?   What have I done so bad?   What is my destiny?   You tie my hands what I am I suppose to see?   What have I done so bad?   What am I gonna be?      [Lil Wayne]   I, knock on the door, hope isn't home   Fate's not around the lucks all gone   Don't ask me what's wrong ask me what's right   And I'ma tell you what's life, and did you know?   I lost everything, but I ain't the only the one   First came the hurricane, then the morning sun   Excuse me if I'm on one   And don't trip if I light one, I walk a tight one   They try tell me keep my eyes open   My whole city underwater, some people still floatin'   And they wonder why black people still voting   'Cause your president still choking   Take away the football team, the basketball team   And all we got is me to represent New Orleans, ----   No governor, no help from the mayor   Just a steady beating heart and a wish and a prayer      [Robin Thicke]   These friends they come and go   But I got family, family   These kids so fast they grow   They learn so quickly now   That there's nowhere to go   That there's no future, future   Don't make this here so low   And we can't overcome, no      [Chorus]      [Lil Wayne]   And if you come from under that water then there's fresh air   Just breathe baby God's got a blessing to spare   Yes I know the process is so much stress   But it's the progress that feels the best   'Cause I came from the projects straight to success and you're next   So try they can't steal your pride it's inside   Then find it and keep on grinding   'Cause in every dark cloud there's a silver lining   I know...      [Lil Wayne talking outro]   Yeah, yeah, yeah   See right now we just riding on love   A shot in the dark   We ain't tryin to do nothing but hit the heart   We need love   That's all y'all, that's all      [Chorus x2]      Yeah, Born right here in the USA   But, due to tragedy looked on by the whole world as a refugee   So accept my emotion   Do not take it as an offensive gesture   It's just the epitome of my soul   And I must be me   We got spirit y'all, we got spirit   We got soul y'all, we got soul   They don't want us to see, but we already know

20090222142251AAe5Cxj	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	What will you be doing on March 28 this year? EARTH HOUR 2009?	Many countries are participating this year, on March 28, to combat power demand and climate change. Basically, everyone who wants to join in is supposed to TURN OFF ALL OF THE LIGHTS in their house on March 28, for one hour -- from 8:00pm - 9:00pm. Use candles for lighting..      The goal is to show how much we can conserve and save AS A PLANET if we all work together to make this place better for everyone. One hour of no lights around the world will save TONS of electricity, and help others become aware of the demand and find alternative sources of energy (such as wind, solar, hybrid, etc) to power our world.      Even though I don't believe in global warming, (which is one of their main goals), I DO believe in working together and saving energy -- as well as using alternative power sources.      I'm in.. are you?      SPREAD THE WORD!!!      www.earthhour.org
