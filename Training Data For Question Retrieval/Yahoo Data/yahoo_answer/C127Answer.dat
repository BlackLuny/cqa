vue9NOhYaa	If your period is due in 10 days, you are PROBABLY past ovulation, so the odds of pregnancy would be fairly low  (esp. if there was no ejaculation) -- but there's no way to know for sure.    (BTW, you CAN take PlanB. You just can't get it OTC.  Go NOW to Planned Parenthood, or call your doctor for a prescription.  If this was 2 days ago, you don't have much time. )    EDIT: Wanted to add that there is NOT a '50-50' chance of getting pregnant. Even if you were actively 'trying' to get pregnant, and had sex (completed) right at your most fertile time, you only have about a 25% chance of pregnancy.|`|6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	You can still take the plan b even if you are under the age of 18.  You will just need to have a parent with you to get it.|`|Xt1LxiWAaa	first of all, just because you are 16 doesn't mean you can't take plan b. you can go to planned parenthood or a clinic and get it. however, the incident happened two days ago and its too late for you to get the pill just in case.    there is a slight chance that you could be pregnant from the condom breaking...there is still sperm in precum.     however, this happened to me a couple of times when i wasn't on birth control, and i was fine. so hopefully you'll be lucky to. :o)|`|uuHPneEcaa	well u have to wait and see if u missed ur period. and if u have missed it then wait a few days before u go and take a test. Don't get stressed out. U aren't to young to get on birth control. I you want to have sex u have to be more careful u are only 16. I wouldn't worry about being pregnant right now. Just wait and see if u have ur period if not then u need to talk to ur parent or gardian about so things. I wouldn't take the test right after ur missed period. if u are late on ur period it could be because of stress also. so don't stress urself out and just wait and see about ur period|`|Z3pQ0Teuaa	Well first off, you really should wait to have sex until you can accept ALL of the consequences from sex...believe me, I was a teen mother and it's not easy.    Secondly, you should know all the facts about Plan B before you take it. If the egg was fertilized, and has already implanted, then no it doesn't cause abortion BUT if the egg was fertilized ( and many believe this is the point of conception, and since I dont know your beliefs, I will share anyway) and hasn't implanted, your body WILL reject it and make it impossible to implant in your uterus, thus causing an abortion.    Not everyone believe this to be true, but being that you're 16, I want you to hear both sides before you make such a decision.    The first poster was correct about it PROBABLY being after you ovulated however, it is possible to become pregnant about 3 days before and after ovulation for the simple fact that sperm can live for up to 5 days in ideal condition s(ie, the time right before and right after you ovulate).    I hope my answer has helped you.|`|JXXZIsBvaa	ANYtime you have sex you can get pregnant.  Condom or not.|`|eEK3m1aXaa	The condom broke in me when I was 18. We didn't know it broke until after we were finished, which meant he ejaculated in me, without the protection of the condom. I didn't get pregnant. Just be aware of any changes in your body if your period doesn't come. Talk to your mother. She will probably be disappointed but she'd rather hear it from you than someone else.      ~_~
597a6f7f30469758200a6561ac8cdc6faa	first of all, congratulations and good luck if she is the be pregnant!  the fact that she had two miscarriages is a big concern indeed, but do you know what caused them? did the body reject the fetus, did the placenta not fix itself to the uterus wall? if you guys were able to find out exactly what happened, that would make it easier to prevent in the future. also, how far along was she? did both miscarriages occur around the same period of the pregnancy?  I know i'm not doing a lot of answering, i'm more like asking questions, but it's complicated and it depends on a lot of variables. your best bet would be to see a gynecologist as soon as possible after taking a pregnancy test, and then having regular consults to see how the pregnancy is evolving and, if anything is to go wrong again, to do whatever possible to prevent it evolving in a miscarriage.   Best of luck to you both, and feel free to e-mail me for any help and advice you might further need. (I'm not a gynecologist, a very good friend of mine is, and i've also done a lot of research on the subject of pregnancies)|`|vmWEm4Jzaa	i think that until you have 3mc in a row, drs dont even consider that anything is wrong and it sounds like you both already went through a bunch of testing and everything is fine. try to relax although its hard! each pregnancy is different-with our first son,there was no way i could have not known i was pregnant-i had a ton of symptoms but with our second son i had no symptoms, including missing my period and didnt find out till i was almost 2 1/2 months along! so just because she is having different or not as severe symptoms doesnt mean anything. congratulations! and remember it is all  in Gods hands!|`|euUZZcM3aa	Aww, the worrying is inevitable. That's just a sign of you being great future parents =) I think that the more miscarriages a woman has, the chances of her having more are higher, but not significantly higher. I'm not too sure, but that's what I've heard/read. Just because she doesn't have any symptoms yet is no reason to worry. She's still very early in her pregnancy, give it a week or two. And even if she doesn't get symptoms, remember that not all women get symptoms in the first place, hence why some women don't even know they're pregnant til they give birth!!    Anyways I hope you and your wife the best of luck, I really hope it works out for you two this time around =) congrats and good luck!!!!!!!!|`|nAOlBmzDaa	Congrats! I hope this one sticks for you guys! Time will tell. Wait on her hand and foot until about 10/12 weeks... lol  :)|`|4lHJEq5Haa	It is very early. She should be taking it easy, taking prenatal vitamins and get to the doctor. only a doctor can guide her through this. wishing you both a healthy baby!|`|FkwhREyCaa	I wouldn't count no symptoms as a bad thing really.  I never really had morning sickness.  Besides it is still pretty early :)  So good luck and go to the doctor :D|`|pqZAhBLvaa	It's way to early for symptoms. Don't worry if there are none yet! You should get a positive test result on the day the eriod should start. Good luck!|`|39pl2Dotaa	all i can say is the bible says with faith the size of a mustard seed we can move mtns   just pray|`|SIKOBm6Eaa	Honestly there is always going to be that worry, but you have to just wait until the end of the first trimester. My aunt and uncle had this problem but they made it through just fine this time. Usually you just wait and not tell anyone until after the first trimester, kind of so you don't get everyone's hopes up and so you don't jinx yourselves.|`|GdSzrtmAaa	Congrats! She should make an appt ASAP relax as much as possible, keep her feet up and do not lift up anything heavy. Good LUCK! Think positive you never know 3rd time might be the charm.|`|jToi0zjJaa	Not sure on the stats for the miscarriages, but every pregnancy is different, and where she may have had a really hard time the first time, the next time she may or may not feel any symptoms at all. Just keep her as relaxed and still as possibly is allowed and take extra precautions only because of her history.     Good Luck!|`|GfphOIdOaa	2 days late is no reason to start celebrating. Still, I wish you the happiness of parenthood. I speak out of my own experience! Often a miscarriage is caused by an "incompatible" DNA between man and woman, which tends to decrease after several pregnancies. So yes, this time it _could_ go better, but considering the history, make sure you have a weekly, or bi-weekly appointment with your gynecologist. As of 22 weeks they can save the child! Still, stay cool, stay relaxed and whatever happens, make sure to support the wife.|`|7921694c73bccf51b31b69bff1045dd6aa	CONGRATS*.....and don't worry until there's something to worry about. I know how frightening it is to have had 2 miscarriages..I also had 2...and then got pregnant and delivered a healthy baby boy...who will be 18 soon*(wow time flys).........Really it's in Gods hands...your wife should definately keep her feet up and elevated under pillows when she can....don't be over doing things (running up and down stairs, lifting laundry, or groceries etc.., just be extra careful especially the first 3months)...be under strict care with her doctor, taking the vitamins etc..eat well. Try not to worry...it will only make things more stressful for you both...which you don't need.( i know it's easier said than done...but Keep the Faith*- Best WIshes to You Both*|`|CuCrGDuRaa	I've had three miscarriages and am now 16 weeks pregnant with twins.  Don't worry about her not having pregnancy symptoms yet.  I didn't even start noticing any changes until I was 6 weeks pregnant, and didn't have morning sickness or headaches until 8 weeks.  And some women never have symptoms!  The best thing you can do is keep her calm and relaxed.  Maybe surprise her with dinner and candles and prepare a nice warm lavender bath (NOT hot).  My husband has been a huge help during this pregnancy and as a result I think things are going much better!    My doctor said about one in three pregnancies results in a miscarriage, and since you were both deemed healthy your odds are good that everything will go well!  Good luck!|`|zfhMzK9Kaa	Best of luck brother.|`|AA11002089	if your blood groups are causing no problem then relaxe.|`|Q3x0yfmtaa	There is no increased chance on miscarriage in an pregnancy unless there is a reason to cause it. You were both deemed healthy, but it may take awhile for the right sperm to meet the perfect egg. Some people conceive quickly, others a little longer. Symptoms can come and go through out pregnancy as well, especially early pregnancy. Good luck and congrats. Get her to the doctor ASAP to get some blood work done.|`|ihjEAoKRaa	I don't think the likelyhood is higher after having 2 miscarriages.  I've never heard that before.  A lot of prenancies do not go to term.  I spoke to a woman last week who had 2 children and had 8 missacariages before and after her first child.  With you and she being healthy there is no reason to assume it will happen again.  I wish you and your wife well.|`|BuE1rhGoaa	Way to go DAD. Think positive and keep her spirits safe. Just remember that mother nature has her own ways of letting you know when it is your time. As for myself I am now 34 and have had a set of twins that were joined at the head.They did not survive after birth. I then had several miscarriages after them. Then I did not get pregnant for the longest time after the last one . When I met my husband  the Dr's said we cold not have children(either of us) so we gave up and just enjoyed the playtime between us. Now we have a 6yr old boy and a 2yr old girl, very healthy and Very active. So just try to relax a little and follow the Dr's advise .If you have questions don't hesitate to ASK. Hope All Goes Well.|`|qHAgbuHkaa	I'm sorry about your prior losses. Did they ever do pathology tests on the babies she miscarried to see if they had anything wrong with them? Maybe your wife has a weak cervix or something? If your sperm count is slightly low, that obviously isn't affecting your fertility much since she's pregnant for the third time already and that of course has nothing to do with miscarrying. It is true that if you have 2 or more miscarriages, that your chance of having another is slightly higher, but it does not mean in any way that she can't carry a baby to term. My maternal grandma had 3 miscarriages, but also went on to have 5 full term healthy babies. She had my mom and her twin brother, then had my aunt, had a miscarriage, had my other aunt, had another miscarriage, had my other aunt and again had another miscarriage. My mom also had one miscarriage inbetween me and my younger brother and I had one as well 15 months ago. I had 2 full term pregnancies before my miscarriage and my mom had 5 kids total. Miscarriages are very common, and although having more than 2 can slightly raise your chances for another, that doesn't mean it will happen again. And about the pregnancy symptoms..do not base how her pregnancy is going off of the symptoms she does or does not have. Everyone is different with symptoms and not having symptoms is not an indicator that something is wrong. I never had any symptoms with mine. With both my full term pregnancies, I never had any morning sickness at all, no fatigue, no heart burn, no sore breasts..nothing at all. I didn't even feel like I was pregnant. With my 3rd pregnancy that I miscarried, I also had no symptoms that time either except for some mild cramping that I had off and on for about a week before I began bleeding. But even cramps in early pregnancy are very common. I had bleeding with both my boys too but nothing ended up being wrong those times. Sometimes a woman can have 2 miscarriages and end up having full term pregnancies every time after that with nothing wrong. On average, 1 out of every 4-5 pregnancies ends in miscarriage so its possible that your wife just coincidentally happened to fall into that 1 out of 4-5 category twice. The most she can do is make sure she's taking her prenatals, drinking lots of water, eating really healthy, getting plenty of rest, no heavy lifting and make sure she gets really good prenatal care. Since she had 2 previous miscarriages, they may be willing to see her more often and do frequent ultrasounds to keep a close eye on the baby. Good luck this time, and don't let your wife stress about it! That won't help anything.|`|9P26sacKaa	Because you've been tested and everything was normal, there is no higher likelihood that you will have a miscarriage now than anyone else or as you did before.  One in five pregnancies end in natual miscarriage.  Knowing you are both normal and have no high risk factors means that your chances are still 1/5.    I had two miscarriages before I got pregnant with my now-2-year-old son.  They didn't even suggest doing tests because two is normal and three in a row could indicate a problem but could still be normal.      There is the possibility that your wife's hormones don't handle early pregnancy well.  There are herbal remedies she can take to avoid miscarriage for this reason and to stop a miscarriage that is hormonally related.  You could call a homebirth midwife or herbalist or an herb shop to find out what they are and where to get them.  I don't mention calling your doctor because they usually don't learn the first thing about natural remedies like these.      Good luck with this pregnancy!  I know it can be hard to get excited or be positive or even hope that this pregnancy will continue.  With my son, we didn't tell anyone we were pregnant until the second trimester, except our immediate support system - ie the people we would want to help us grieve if another miscarriage happened.      Also, you should talk with your wife about it.  She is probably just as worried about it as you are and it's always helpful to stay on the same page and share your emotions and thoughts throughout pregnancy and your relationship.  It just opens so many doors and avoids a lot of problems and misunderstandings.
5d6ac5016d8e7904fd28943ad38bde0faa	We didnt started getting anything until i was 6 months...and i agree 100% with your mom. imagine if anything happened? what would you do with all the things you bought?    i cant believe all these ppl say "oh we started buying as soon as we found out..." i think thats ridiculous, u have to at least, on the back of your mind, have the thought that something out of your control could happen! but anyways that is a total personal choice between u and ur partner...    i just found out my friend miscarried at 4 months so there's a thought. she had an ectopic pregnancy which is 100% out of anyone's control.|`|ook6cPMPaa	As soon as I was pregnant with both of my kids, I went out and bought one little sleeper. Most people end up having baby showers between 24-28 weeks. I think your mother is just trying to protect you, because she sees both sides of things. If you are not having any problems, there will be no harm done buying a few things. You have so much to get with a new baby, waiting until the last second will really drain the pockets. You should be buying diapers when you see them on sale (Don't bother with too many packs of newborn size!), blankets, tshirts..etc. The everyday stuff. I did alot of this shopping at about 20 weeks.|`|b3CwObBdaa	hey - i started shopping before i even got pregnant.  i saw the cutest little things once in awhile and would just sock them away for 'later'.  worst case scenerio i would gift them away to new mom's.  i started buying my own stuff at 16 weeks.  the chances of having a miscarriage now are soooo slim.  your mom might as well tell you to wait until the baby is born because things can happen during childbirth and you'll still be stuck with all that baby stuff.|`|e0xpYnv1aa	Anytime you want. If you're having a shower I would wait til after that to buy anything on your own though, otherwise you might end up with doubles of stuff. But you for sure want to have everything on hand incase the baby is born early.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	We bought our crib when I was 3 months along... buy when you want; but don't go overboard because you'll get a lot of what you need (and don't need!) at your baby shower!.  Congrats and good luck!|`|Xt1LxiWAaa	what??!?!? im sorry, but i think thats awful about what your mom thinks...even if she does have a slight point.     after you see a heartbeat, hear a heartbeat, find out the sex, and keep hearing a heartbeat...its fine!!     you're 21 weeks and you should go buy baby stuff! i started getting little things after i found out i was pregnant, then after i was 12 weeks and heard both of my twins heartbeats..then at 20 weeks when i found out the sexes, i went to go buy more. around 25 weeks or later i started buying the big stuff. and im so glad i did because im exhausted and im on bed rest now so i cant do anything!  good luck and have fun!|`|MtC3CWZraa	I say wait until after your baby shower(s). You never know what people will get you and sometimes what they get you can't be returned so you're stuck with duplicates.     Prior to my third trimester, I bought and outfit here or there, but very little otherwise unless I knew it was something that I wouldn't be given (like a changing table). We did our biggest shopping blitz at about 35 weeks.|`|YMcidP50aa	I think that if you feel comfortable buying now than go for it. I have two kids and am now pregnant with my 3rd and with both my boys I waited until I was out of the woods for a miscarriage n wen I found out @ 20sumthng weeks I went crazy on shopping but don't do to much because you will get a lot of stuff at your baby shower|`|dFOcEmWMaa	start now! i started as soon as i found out, it is so much easyer to colect everything you need over time than trying to get it all together at once|`|R4dSJbtQaa	I waited after 28 weeks before I started buying baby things.  I had a difficult pregnancy and the dr couldn't guarantee that the baby would make it.  But everything turned out fine I had a healthy baby girl.  I would definitely wait until 28 weeks again to get the stuff around.|`|t6OGh0Edaa	I started shopping for our baby after week 20 when I found out he is a boy! I was too excited to wait.  Although I only bought smaller items - clothes, diapers, etc.  I waited to buy big ticket items such as the crib and stuff like that until the last few weeks.  That way you can be excited but not go overboard just in case.  Plus, I don't know if this one is your first but ours is and we are having 3 showers starting with the first this weekend so you don't want to buy too much ahead in case friends and family get it for you!  So, I say do what you feel is right! :) Good luck!|`|4lHJEq5Haa	honestly, I started buying things when I found out I was having a girl. Why think of the worst? Buying baby clothes is so much fun! If your pregnancy is going well, allow yourself to be excited about it and buy away :)|`|10mOwk0Taa	Start whenever you feel you're ready.  I'm only 8 weeks and have already picked up some cute onesies I found at Costco with Dr. Seuss characters on them.  I figure, even if I don't make it to full term, I'm planning to keep trying to have children and one day it'll work out, so I'll just put the stuff in storage and keep it there until viability.  If you lose a baby its hard no matter what, you just have to think about what kind of person you are.  I'm the kind of person that handles loss very well and know that having that stuff wouldn't significantly contribute to my despair.  However, if you're more sensitive, you may want to wait.|`|7HzfgRmwaa	with my first pregnancy i bought as soon as i found out! LIke 5 weeks and then miscarried around 12 weeks. It was kind of heartbreaking to have to have the stuff around and not my babies    The second time (this time) I learned my lesson and bought very very little after 12 weeks and  then at 17 weeks I learned the gender and that everything would be fine and began buying everything I needed between then and 28 weeks or so. I think you are fine to go ahead and start buying now! ... or wait. Its up to you and its whenever you feel comfortable about it really. Maybe though if you don't want to begin now you can start saving now so you won't go broke at the end of your pregnancy :)     Good Luck! Sounds like you are in for a healthy child in 20 more weeks!|`|3qI1oyFaaa	I'm 24 weeks and started buying things FOREVER ago... If you were to lose your little one now it would be just as heartbreaking without any baby stuff around, so you might as well start preparing for the more likely chance that you'll have a big, healthy baby!!    Congrats and good luck!!!|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	i started recieving gifts at 20 weeks,    i havent bought anything myself    we are getting the crib this week|`|AA12127418	i bought as soon as i found out what i was having|`|W0d6NsGBaa	I started right around 20 weeks when I found out it was a girl! We had TONS to buy and we were doing it all ourselves so I really wanted to stretch it all out over as much time as possible. Technically a baby can survive outside the womb anytime around and after 24 weeks right? I dont think 3 weeks is that big of a deal! Start shopping just keep receipts if it would make you feel better.    Congrats!|`|GdSzrtmAaa	We usually start buying when we found out the sex of the baby.|`|98WKYtfwaa	I'm in the same boat, my mother and rest of family believe that too but i want to buy buy buy.     I bought my pram, moses basket and car seat a few days ago, although i've not got them in my house the shop is holding them till the week before my due date.    I've bought some baby clothes too, but i'm also keeping them in a relatives house, not because i believe in superstition but i just wouldn't be able to face them if anything were to happen!     Just buy when you want, if you're scared then get someone else to keep them for you.|`|Q3x0yfmtaa	You buy whenever you want. If you feel you're ready now, then buy the things you like or need. I was 26 weeks before I received or bought anything for my baby. I got Christmas gifts for the baby, and then I bought a few clothing items for him with money I got as a gift. Shortly after that I bought my crib because I couldn't pass up the deal I was given. I haven't bought much because I'm waiting on my baby shower to buy whatever is left. I've also been given a lot of clothing.     I was told to go light on buying clothes because EVERYONE will mostly gift clothes to you. :)|`|LiPoEBenaa	Babies R Us has a 90 day return policy. I'm 35wks and I have everything I need. We bought the crib, bedding, and started doing our major shopping around 22wks after I knew the sex of the baby. It made things a lot easier to budget when we spent a little at a time instead of spending this huge amount all at once. Also, I was high risk and didn't know if the baby was going to make it either and I spoke to the managers at a few stores we were shopping at (target, sears, babies r us) and they said they have NEVER turned away a return to someone who had lost a baby. That's just cruel. If you're worried I would ask to speak to the store manager and have him sign off on the receipt - that's what I did.    edit: I don't advise waiting till the last minute on furniture... some of the things we looked at were back-ordered 3-6 months! I would get that out of the way asap!|`|aRxcYr41aa	I think you should wait till you know if it's boy or girl, but you can start buying stuff, and if you wanna buy some clothes, just buy them in color that boys and girls can wear, such as white, yellow, green. Congratulations! God bless you ;)|`|KHbqfLRUaa	With both of my pregnancies, I waited until after I learned the sex of the baby (21 weeks and 18 weeks).  I wouldn't wait too long, though, because you will be amazed at how much stuff you need and how expensive it can all be.  If you are having baby showers, just make sure that you keep your registry updated with the items you buy so there is less of a chance of receiving doubles!  Congrats, and have fun shopping - it is addicting!|`|wx32VQSWaa	you can start buying whenever you feel like it. It's up to you! As for me, I only bought one or two things once I found out what I was having. Then now that I'm 30 weeks far along, I'm just buying the IMPORTANT stuff baby needs the first couple days/week home. I'm buying a travel system in a couple weeks.
hSTNMnFPaa	Lila 10/10~ Used to be my all-time favorite girl name, but I replaced it with the more practical Delilah, nickname Lila. Very beautiful, elegant and classy. Lovely choice.    Violet 10/10~ Stunning! My favorite flower name, so gorgeous and sophisticated.    Zoey 6/10~ I prefer the spelling Zo?, Zo or at least Zoe. The "y" seems unnecessary. Spelled Zo? this name would be an 8/10. Pretty name. A little cutesy, but I think it would work on an adult.    Ella 6/10~ Cute but common, dull and overused. Also, it's a bit "nicknamey" and I much prefer Ariella, nickname Ella. It just seems classier.    Chloe 6/10~ Pretty, but still popular. I don't really love it but it's okay.    Olivia 4/10~ Popular and not very pretty-sounding to me. And it's too close to the boy name Oliver, which I adore.    Caroline 7/10~ Actually, I kind of like this one. It's one of the few "80s" names that I think is still usable today. I like it best as a middle name, though.    Jacqueline 8/10~ Lovely name and lovely spelling- I can't stand when this pretty, classy name is made trashy by spelling it "Jacklin/Jaclyne/Jakklyn/etc". But, again, I like it best as a middle name.    Belle 5/10~ Reminds me of Belle from Beauty and the Best, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. I just think it's a bit too close to Bella, which reminds me of Twilight, which is /definitely/ a bad thing.    Elizabeth 5/10~ A little common and overused, even though I do like it. I prefer it as a middle name.    Ariel 7/10~ Pretty, but Ariella would get a 10/10. Ariel sounds incomplete and reminds me of the word "arial".    Emmeline --~ My rating depends on how this is pronounced. "em-ah-LEEN" gets 4/10, "EM-ah-lin" gets a 6/10, "em-ah-LINE" gets 4/10.

The time that you can hear the heart beat can vary person to person, but if you are getting an early ultrasound done you will be able to see it fluttering even if you can't hear it yet.|`|98WKYtfwaa	On an ultrasound usually about 6 weeks.

If you're belly is hanging over your pants, I'm sorry but that's chub, not baby.|`|FkwhREyCaa	Yep, it depends are how lose your stomach muscles were before you were pregnant.  I am 14 weeks and in maternity pants.  I feel as though I look more chubby than pregnant at the moment.  My reg. pants were uncomfortable but the maternity pants are too big.  I say buy some yoga pants or get one of those pregnancy bands so you can still wear you old pants.

aba81bf0dd1e368904161a0c15faf44caa	I've had these tests... they normally do them between 13 and 15 weeks, so you should still be okay.    The test is easy.  It is an ultrasound, but they look at different things than your standard ultrasound.  They look for the length of the leg and arm bones, presences of a nasal bone, the nuchal fold, etc.  (There are nine markers total that they look at).  It only takes minutes, and they can tell you a world of information about your child.  Most doctors will also looks at the chambers of the heart, the bowels, etc so that if there are any anomalies you can be prepared for them at birth.    They also do some blood tests which go along with the ultrasounds.  You usually end up having at least three of these "high-def" ultrasounds if you are considered to be high-risk.  My doctor mentioned once that all multiples are considered high0risk, so that may be the reason for all the pressure on you to have the tests done...    Good luck and email me if you need more info!|`|Xt1LxiWAaa	first of all congrats with the twins! i am 32 1/2 weeks with twins!!! :o)    typically they do the first test 11-13 weeks. they do a blood test. and then they do an ultrasound and just measure your babies neck and stuff. with twins, they like to give an hour for both baby, so expect two hours total. for me, it was longer because of my babies didn't want to cooperate! they have to have the babies laying down on their back. they just measure and stuff like that. and to you, it will just be like an ultrasound...a really long ultrasound! be ready to have to pee...a lot!!!! by the end of mine i was in pain because i had to pee so bad!    i also got the second test at 20 weeks...which was another ultrasound and bloodwork.      its just testing for down syndrome and some other things. didn't your doctor talk to you about it? i got paperwork and stuff to read about it.    good luck!|`|rOFteEdlaa	well i think its 13 weeks 6 days you need to do it by so do it asap, congrats on the twins i had twins to but they wouldn't let me do those tests they said they weren't accurate at my age( i was 18)|`|W0d6NsGBaa	I did it at 12 weeks 2 days. Its an ultrasound and blood test. I couldnt care less if my baby had downs but I LOVE getting ultrasounds! It was neat to see the baby at that stage.     It was about 30 minute ultrasound where they just look at the baby and measure the heart and also measure behind the babies neck. Then they took a quick blood sample and that was it.|`|5deb28fe9fecaef7f55e1f593df11203aa	i just had it done, all they do is do an ultrasound and measure something on the babies neck, the only tricky thing is the baby has to be laying in a certain position  for them to do the test, i had to come back a second time cuz my lil shrimp kept moving
yOyg3gnJaa	I have heard that obesity can cause trouble when trying to conceive, but honestly, your weight shouldn't even be an issue!  I wouldn't consider you overweight, and when they say that obesity or being overweight can cause fertility issues, it's most certainly now 140 and 5'6.  The only thing I would suggest is make sure you aren't TTC during a stressful time in your life, since stress can cause complications if it is an active part of your daily life.  Just take it easy!  Best of luck to you!|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	Overweight at 140 lbs? Sweetie, that's not overweight. But if you're stressed out that will definitely interfere.     People don't have problems conceiving because of weight issues unless they are pretty obese.|`|t6OGh0Edaa	Hi, you sound like you are not really "overweight".  I am a bigger framed farmgal who works on the farm for a living and I am what you would consider overweight - healthy but still a little chubby!  I was on BC for 5 years and went off waited the 3 months before trying and my husband and I conceived the first try! We are now awaiting a little boy in 7-8 weeks!  So, in answer to your question as long as you are healthy and not overstressed I think you should be fine.  Of course assuming everything else is normal!  Good luck and have fun! :)|`|CuCrGDuRaa	According to the BMI chart, you are at a healthy weight!  You shouldn't have a problem at all conceiving.  Just try to relax and enjoy it.  Good luck!|`|b3CwObBdaa	fat people can get pregnant too, you know.  and with no issues.|`|8ZEqAwJ7aa	The rule of thumb is if you have normal regular periods you should be able to get pregnant. I am more than 50lbs overweight, but very healthy and active. I have 2 children and a third on the way. I got pregnant with all 3 without even trying. Very quickly. So, don't let anyone tell you that you will have problems. Besides, you are not overweight!!|`|eU5Eth2aaa	You should be totally fine!  I wouldn't even consider your weight to be in the overweight category...I'm over weight and my husband and I got pregnant on the first try!
7KjxpGZtaa	As far as the twinges - it's just your body slowly gearing up for the big show.  I've had them so bad before that it would literally stop my in my tracts.    There is a good chance he has dropped if you can feel the "grinding" movements on your cervix if he moves.    As far as the contractions go.  The best way I can describe them is like a gas pain and a period cramp together at the same time if that makes any sense.|`|aRxcYr41aa	It's normal, sometimes babies go down and up. =)|`|dFOcEmWMaa	I am totaly having the same thing, doc says thats just him moving around pushing on stuff, real contractions make your tummy hard a s a rock... i havent had any pain from my contractions yet... i know how ya feel|`|qld2ajufaa	hi...i've been there!! i always felt so stupid for asking questions, but until you've been through it, you just don't know, so don't worry about that:) sounds like the baby has dropped, especially is you're feeling a lot of added pressure down there recently...and contractions feel like really bad menstrual cramps...at least for me they did...good luck:)|`|Bs8sllD9aa	I would say that he is dropping and getting in place for the big adventure. As for contractions well they are different for everyone. With me it just felt like my belly was getting tight and than letting loose. I was really uncomfortable in am way shape or form. But I will say that if you are having bad pain and can't even stand to walk your in labor. Best of luck|`|AA12107422	I had this with my last pregnancy - sharp jolts that sometimes would make me 'jump'.  Anyways, I had this too -- it was really new for me also because I didn't have it with my first pregnancy. I asked my doctor & she said its contractions. It could mean that the baby has dropped, though, she didn't tell me that when I asked - futhermore, it does make sense. She said that these contractions are the only ones that some women feel when they go into labor. Everyone is different. I would time them to be on the safe side. They could also be braxton hicks - change position, walk to sitting still, vise versa. If they don't stop or get stronger, call your doctor!! If I had to explain contractions -- I'd have to say they are really powerful poo cramps. Haaa. Sorry, that's what they felt like to me. You will know when you have them. Good Luck & Congrats ?|`|Xt1LxiWAaa	there is no stupid question!! (other than people asking if they are pregnant when we have no idea. haha)     sounds like your baby has dropped. and the feeling you are feeling is the pressure from the baby. its completely normal.
Jswomud7aa	To me it felt like the tips of butterfly wings fluttering against the inside of my belly. It was really light at first, but every day it got stronger and stronger until I was complaining about how he would kick me under the ribs or down at my bladder... haha fun times!|`|WihX11Gmaa	It feels like little bubbles in your stomach. It's hard to explain but if you think you feel something, most likely you are right. I felt my baby move around when i was 18 weeks and everyone told me it was too early but once I felt it more later I knew it had been her that I felt.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	Pubic bone, dear.  The first time I felt my son, it felt like popcorn popping.  Some women describe it as butterfly wings, some say they couldn't tell the difference between gas bubbles and baby moving.  It's different for everyone.  You'll know when it's your baby moving...|`|b3CwObBdaa	mine felt a little like gas.  it took a little while for me to notice that it was a little bit too regular.|`|8KjPGiH7aa	I am 37 weeks along in my pregnancy and really, it's sort of like your stomach is twitching. That, or like bubbles are being blown inside your stomach. It's a pretty cool feeling actually. :) I hope I've helped.|`|faPKwClPaa	I thought I was feeling little pops and bubbles for a while, then one night, I felt a 'swoop' in my stomach, much like when you are on the down-slope of a roller-coaster.  That's when I definitely felt my baby move without a doubt.|`|dFOcEmWMaa	like a bubble in your tummy, or a butterfly|`|R4dSJbtQaa	You most likely will not feel the baby kick until sometime between 16 and 22 weeks.  Even though the baby starts moving at the seven or e|`|276cac1afa2a1fe687f543c22f3e1e3caa	bubbles poping in you tummy|`|WmzFCSO5aa	That might be it. I thought it was kind of hard to notice at first. It kind of felt like bubbles thats the only way I can describe it. But when the baby gets bigger you will definitely know it is!
IKtAm28gaa	Iv had a similar problem before. I thought i was pregnant, i had all the signs BUT i read somewhere if you believe you are pregnant your body will go through all the signs (ect boobs getting bigger,  putting on weight, missing period) but your not actually pregnant. I suggest you see your doctor or tell someone you trust. Hope this helped|`|e732a7dcc9106f6e3a83f101368fbeacaa	Possibly since your fertile days are three days before and on the date of fertilization. Keep in mind that sperm can live up to 5 days. I would take a test if you don't get your period. I took one the night before it was due and it was negative. I didn't get my period and tested the day after it should have came and it was positive. Good luck!|`|Amkmles0aa	100%|`|047IPSovaa	shure can|`|5afa5bd19226d3326c9f6bc410b563e1aa	50/50|`|pqZAhBLvaa	Absolutely you could, but symptoms won't start (aside from implantation bleeding which is rust coloured usually) until about 3 weeks pregnant.|`|6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	If you have unprotected sex than there is a chance that you could be pregnant, but you will have to wait until you miss your period for the pregnancy test to be accurate.|`|cPIYUWxyaa	may be u r or may be u r not. i wouldn't worry until the test results.|`|dFOcEmWMaa	it is very possible|`|xMt0gktCaa	There is a 6 out of 10 chance that you are pregnant and why did you sleep with your ex?|`|R4dSJbtQaa	It could be implantation bleeding but only time will tell.  If you don't get your period by the end of this week test.|`|AA12127418	50/50 goodluck|`|NSFuIeZYaa	It is possible but not very likely. Give it a couple days to see if you're period turns normal. If not see a doctor or buy a test.|`|HWcLc82Saa	You could be, since sperm lives in your body for up to 3 days - and you ovulated 2 days after having sex. Brown discharge, however, sounds weird. Maybe an STD or you're just making it sound all the wrong lol. But I think you could be pregnant, but its kind of early for signs to show...signs usually don't show for weeks after getting pregnant.   Good luck!  ~Anna~|`|Z3pQ0Teuaa	Yes you could. If you ovulated on the 25th and had sex on the 23rd, conditions could have been ideal for sperm to live for days. They can live for up to 5 days if the conditions are ideal.    Btw, how do you know you were ovulation?|`|ndwmn6Z4aa	DEPENDS WHAT SEX U HAD IT MIGHT JUST BE U THINKING THAT YOUR STOMACH HURTS AND THEN THERE IS A ILLUSION THAT MAKES U THINK YOUR STOMACH HURTS AND THE light brown discharge type thing can be of anything  But it is a 70% chance you are|`|hOGAgVASaa	maybe you are myabe not no one really knows take a test?|`|jTtOUcwMaa	that brown stuff also often happens at the end of a menstrial cycle.|`|7KjxpGZtaa	"If" what you saw was actually implantation bleeding then you should be able to take an early home test in the next couple of days.  Once implantation happens the body starts producing HcG which is the hormone that pregnancy tests detect.    It is definately possible that you could have gotten pregnant since sperm can live as long as 5 days inside the body (typically it's a little less time though).      I would be more apt to think that the brown discharge you saw was either 1. old blood that was just coming out or 2. your period slowly trying to jump start (I've had that happen before - and then 4 or 5 days later my period actually start).
vue9NOhYaa	If you have fertile mucus, the sperm can usually live 3-5 days, sometimes longer.  If you have hostile mucus, the sperm would be killed at the cervix.    But if you had sex on the 25th, and ovulated on the 27th, that IS your fertile time (you dont' have to try right on the day OF ovulation), so you have a good chance.|`|dFOcEmWMaa	3 to 5 days|`|pX9DDdOEaa	will if it was on the 25 you have a better chance, cause it can stay alive around 3 days , but its better if you do it when you are ovualting
98WKYtfwaa	Erin - You talk absolute crap!     I had that before i knew i was pregnant, i had unusual discharge and twinges/light cramps in my abdomen.|`|rOFteEdlaa	possibly braxton hicks... it depends how far along your are but if your really worried call the nurse line or the hospital and ask what to do.|`|7AYnWg3paa	wait till u miss a period...u wont know for sure until then anyway....

However, my younger brother & I are 15 months apart and are different genders.|`|4kX61Y97aa	my mom had me 15 months after my brother so no it just how the dna is formed|`|J3TRJPIwaa	My sisters girls are 13 months apart.

It's nothing to do with that, it's about the sperm, that determines the sex of the child, depending on which sperm (x or y) gets to the egg first.     I done every "for fun" gender prediction test, they all told me boy! I think one or 2 told me girl, it turned out i was expecting a boy :-)|`|1h9DYByQaa	not true hun,     i had 3 children very close together, i had a daughter to start with, then when she was about 5-6 months i got pregnant with my 2nd child and had a boy and then when he reached about 6 months i had fell with my 3rd and had another daughter, i have another friend who also had 2 children close together and she had a girl and a boy.. so no its not true that they are usually the same sex, it is to do with when you ovulated when you concieved and when you had sex that determinds the sex of your baby, so if you ovulated first and then concived then you are more likely to have a boy, but if you had sex and then ovulated a few days later then you are more likely to have a girl as the male sperm die really quickly and the female live longer..    good luck..     mum of 4|`|QAEQqgzyaa	My boyfriend is less than 2 years older than his brother (obviously both the same sex) and my older sisters were born really close together and there is 3 of them so yeah maybe theres something in it, but really the sex is determined by the sperm which isnt predictable|`|KHbqfLRUaa	I am currently pregnant with my second little boy, and he will be almost exactly 24 months younger than his big brother.

P3e2kJtwaa	adoption is the best option.  I doubt that your parents would honestly kick you out, especially at your age, but either way, please do not have an abortion.  You will regret it :(.  If your parents do kick you out, find out if there are other ppl you can stay with.  Good luck! I wish you the best at this time!|`|Jswomud7aa	Go to your local church and talk to the leadership there. They will have resources for you if your parents do kick you out.    Email me your city and I can try to help you if you'd like.    I hope your parents don't kick you out. Because you are only 14 I doubt they would kick you out being pregnant. They will be pissed off and disappointed for sure, but tell them what's going on so you can get a plan together on your future and the future of your baby.    Good luck and email me if you'd like me to help you. :)|`|J3TRJPIwaa	you pray that your boyfriend has a safe environment to live in and raise  your child in.|`|AA10186411	Well ok?  Then you need to find somewhere else to go.  You should have thought about all that before you open your legs.  You are a CHILD and you shouldn't have been having sex.  But if you are pregnant, this is no excuse to have an abortion.  There are plenty of homes for pregnant teens and they will gladly take you and your soon to be child in.|`|6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	First you need to find out if you are pregnant.  Then if you are you will have no chose but to tell your father.  You are only 14 so hopefully he would really kick you out of the house.  If he does you need to do some research online to find housing for teen mothers.|`|ZpIW9v1Baa	Start researching community programs. We have non profit organizations in my hometown that sponsor mothers to be in your situation. They help you get an apartment, clothing for you and the baby, food etc.     And tell your parents the truth sometimes they'll surprise you and be supportive. Remember no matter what you are still their daughter.|`|03n14OLLaa	Know how you feel|`|dFOcEmWMaa	do what you think is right... but i would keep the baby, and i would tell your parents... if you are pregnant you need to go to the hospital, your child will love you no matter what|`|vRneaVgVaa	ah.. im 17 and i think im pregnant.. life is good eh>? right.. ughh this sucks lol|`|rOFteEdlaa	Ummm well all i can say is i hope your not and hopefully you are gonna use more precautions next time, its not fun being a young mom and its not fun being kicked out of your house, so just be careful, if you are pregnant just talk to you mom(its harder on dads) and see what she says maybe consider adoption or abortion|`|DaeE2aMhaa	jc ur an idiot bc hes black he might not live n a safe enviorment ugh i cant stand people like you.      im in a mixed relationship in had the same problem with my bfs mom but we love each other and made it thru bc of that. if ur dad luvs you enuff he will come around. just pray about it.|`|bKxtDztSaa	ok well first off. are you sure your pregnant? and if so how far in...  cos at your age, your periods may come at different intervals owed to stress or other factors. so if ur basing ur answer based off the fatc that you are late then there is no issue.  If you are really pregnant and your parents are gonna kick you out of the house then u ahev the foloowing options:  1. you can enlist your soon to be child for adoption, where you know it will be raisd by a family who is ready for a child and not a premature mother.  2. abortion. i know how many people say that abortion is immoral \and all that stuff. well guess what you dont have to listen to them. this is your child and if you do not wish to keep it then take abortion. this one you might want to tell your parents about so that they can be there for you.  3.keep the child and search for housing for teenage mothers. although i am not too familiar in this section.  4. Talk to you parents about it and tell them the options you have and say that you will ether give the baby for adoption or smthn. (dont midn to sound cruel here but you know what i want to say)    i do not sreriously believe that your parents will kick you out of the house. you are their daughter adn they must care for you, even if your pregnant. So i personally do not believe they will.  my recommendation? abortion or enlist for adoption of your baby.  you do not want to raise a child at the tender age of 14. You still ahev alot of life ahead fo you adn it would be a shame to be held back by a mistakje such as this.
69DjSUVAaa	I had the same problem with my little Alfie, I am breastfeeding and i tried gripe water, infacol and dentinox all of these worked for a little while. I found if i drank mint tea and laid him down on his side this seemed to help ease it for him. I also completely changed my diet and introduced 4-5 pieces of fruit at lunchtime then white meat and veg for dinner.    Keep a food diary and see what foods affect her. I found it very useful with Alfie i have learnt what to stay away from.     Calpol will not help with colic.   And please do not give your baby honey as someone suggested, you must not give them honey until they are at least a year old due to the bacteria.    Email me if you like as my little one is now  6 months old and i have been through the ups and downs of breastfeeding.    I hope you find something that helps. x|`|eG5W05Pbaa	infocol works, also special teats for colic, they help alot, colic is horrible my son had it as its more common for boy... good luck|`|WnMrgSg4aa	Try Gripe Water|`|IkkYOehSaa	get in the bath with her. I swear this works. She will probably relax and calm down. the skin to skin contact will help alot and the water is nice and warm. Might just put her to sleep. My friend did this and her baby slept for 5 hours straight afterwords.|`|tQw6EDspaa	you shouldn't use medication. just comfort him & nurse him constantly|`|iZDsMCghaa	When my son was colic I wasnt offered any medicines for him. Hmm, wonder why?!  I went through several options and still, my little guy was hysterical day and night, whether I held him or not. I tried mylicon which helped MILDLY and then wa-la! I tried the air vent bottle(they are all good but I used playtex brand) and that did thr trick! I couldnt believe something so simple and affordable was all I needed. He still got a little gassy but I used mylicon as well as the bottle. All things may not work for all baby's but worth a shot!    I have heard good things about gripe water|`|G1ZgTqNcaa	My daughter had colic starting at 6 weeks and it lasted until she was about 3 months.      I would highly recommend buying the book "the happiest baby on the block" by Dr Karp.  It teaches you techniques on how to calm your baby when they are crying due to colic, and it really works!      I would swaddle her really tight, put on the hair dryer and give her a pacifier while rocking her in my arms.  After a minute or so, she would stop crying.  It took me a little while to perfect it, but it really works to control colic.    Good luck!|`|598fac7b695aab3b03ad03f66442a74eaa	Maybe this link will have some info you can use: http://www.coliccalm.com/baby_infant_new...|`|BW7Nrqjzaa	Just wanted to actually comment on another posters answer! NEVER GIVE A BABY UNDER ONE HONEY! It can contain botulism which will is deadly and at the very least will make your baby seriously sick.    My daughter was very colicky so I understand were you're coming from. We tried Tylenol but it's didn't work. She's now two and is still "sassy"...lol We love it though. She thinks she's the boss and has from the day she was born...|`|ocScMQqlaa	Oh, what memories!!!   I completely empathise with you. We tried everthing with our son, who's now thirteen. It was always at night and like you I was breastfeeding.    "Woodwards Gripewater" was the only thing that worked. I'm not sure if it's still available or the age it can be taken. Any chemist should be able to help though.|`|JmM8xCbLaa	My nephew has colic, and my health visitor recommended "colief".   Its expensive but I heard its good!   Its worth a try. Good Luck.   P.S, you can get it from boots.|`|WlTlYMJxaa	i heard that if you give babies honey when they have colic it helps    for some reason i am unaware.  but warm milk and honey should help    not only that but it will also put the baby to sleep as well :)      you could also try giving them a teething tablet  only one though  because they are strong it will help your baby to sleep..
Qfq4lpe7aa	Let the nurses tell her how to hold the baby.  maybe before she gets there or if she goes out of the room talk to your nurses to coach her how to hold the baby that way it is not coming from you and they know how to handle stuff like that I am sure they have to correct lots of people! :) Good luck to you!|`|6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	For the first couple of months just do not let anyone hold him.  Say you would rather him not get spoiled by everyone picking him up until he gets a little older.  Since you do not want to hurt anyone's feelings say that to everyone.  If you are alone with a person you trust to hold your baby let them hold him.|`|uuHPneEcaa	That is totally understandable. that is ur child u do what u need to do to protect him even if u have to tell people to support his lil head. and have to supervise them to hold him I would probably do that samething. There isn't anything wrong with that. Tell ur step mother "HEY U NEED TO HOLD HIS HEAD OR DON'T HOLD HIM AT ALL.." that is what I would do. I think when I have my son I will have to do that to my grandmother who loves children cause she wants to pick them up while standing and her balance isn't that great. u don't want to hurt them but u have to do what u have to do to protect ur child.|`|ecBx744aaa	just nicely tell her if she would mind holding him while you stand or sit next to her, or let her hold him and tell her how to do it, and just make sure your standing right there holding him too =)|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	stay in the room with her and when she gose to hold the baby say "why dont you sit down first"|`|rOFteEdlaa	just tell them you don't want people holding the baby because of illnesses, like a cold or the flu that they may not have but can carry germs lol i didn't that with my kids too|`|75l2smfCaa	Give her some credit. She might actually hold the baby right. She's not 5, im sure she will support the head. As for others holding the baby, Im totally with you. After my baby is born, Im not going to let anyone in for a few hours so my husband and I can have bonding time with eachother and the baby.|`|pUvEmPrCaa	Women that just give birth are expected to be overprotective, so telling her to 'make sure you hold their head' and things like that aren't really going to come off as that offensive because it's normal mother paranoia.    But, I'm sure that she has the common sense to know that you need to hold a child a certain way.  Did she raise children?|`|W0d6NsGBaa	Toughy....just be honest with her! Laugh at yourself and say you are really overprotective so you want EVERYBODY to sit when they hold her. I was the same with my son. I made everybody wash their hands....use germ-x...and then sit down (except the grandparents)|`|3qI1oyFaaa	You can ask a nurse to show "everyone" the proper techniques before they hold him, and if she still holds your little one incorrectly, then just don't let her after that. Same with everyone else. It's your child and you have the right to say what's best for him.    Congrats and good luck :)|`|BuE1rhGoaa	just politely tell her if she wants to hold the baby she will have to sit down on the couch and Support his head because he can't do it for himself yet.if she doesn't want to comply  then just say sorry NO. She might get her feelings hurt but they can heal a broken baby can't.|`|52U22fiAaa	Believe me, once your baby is born you will have such a natural instinct to protect him that you won't be afraid to tell people what you prefer, don't like, etc.  There is a tactful way to say it, but don't be afraid.  If she holds the baby and doesn't support the head, just say "Oh, hold the head please!"  Simple and to the point.  If she gets upset then she will have to get over it, you have to protect your baby!  As far as other people go, they will have to respect your wishes as a mom.  It gets easier, I had problems at first but now I have no shame in making clear what I like/don't like people to do around my kids.  Best of luck!|`|2mhLJl11aa	The most important factor here is your baby. Everyone else comes second from the moment he's born. I think the only way to go here is to be very upfront, and in the most polite way as possible. You could always try something like, "I've been doing a lot of reading, and the best way to hold a baby is (insert way here)", and also "Since I'm a first-time mother, I want to wait until the baby is older before I let others hold him". If anyone tries to argue with you or change your mind, just simply ask them to please respect your wishes. You're the mother and in charge; don't let anyone else try to convince you otherwise. All you can do is be upfront and respectable, and expect the same in return. If not, stand your ground - you're baby is relying on you to be his voice. People who have a problem with your maternal instinct will get over it in time, and if not, that's their problem - not yours. This is how I would handle it, not to say that it's the ONLY way to handle it... it's just how I would personally. People are just SO entitled these days and I have zero tolerance for it, ESPECIALLY when it comes to ones own baby/child.    Good luck, and CONGRATULATIONS!!! He will be such a joy for you. :o)|`|iiUJHYNeaa	cancer or not you have to be honest with her. personally i can understand why u are worried. i would take her with u to some baby care classes where they teach u how to hold the baby and all that, u have every right to be protective of your little one u are after all the mom and want to make sure the baby is safe|`|AA11607166	Have the nurses give instruction - You know the whole drill - hand washing, supporting the head , etc.  I am sure they have had that request before|`|o7wGYLZ5aa	When you are with her and two more people if possible tell them that the doctor or nurse did a mini class to teach you how to hold the baby and that they told you everyone around the baby needed to know this that it is a must.  If she still does not get it, take him away.  If you let her take him just tell her remember you have to do this and that.|`|Jswomud7aa	1 Be sensitive to her. This will be her grand-child and she will obviously want to hold him and love on him.     2 Show her the right way to hold him. Most people are afraid of holding babies when they're not used to being around them, more than likely she will be just as nervous as you when she holds him the first time.     3 Be patient. It may take her some time to get used to holding a new infant, but babies are pretty resilient and tough, unless she drops him or purposely abuses I doubt he'll be in danger.      4 If you feel that she is a danger to your son, do not in any circumstance let him be with her. ever. period. Trust your instincts. If she has hostile feelings or has said inappropriate things to you are about your baby then do not let her hold him. Just because she is your step-mom, doesn't mean she has a right to your baby. (I didn't get the feeling that she is hostile to you, but just in case...)     5 You are the mom. Don't be afraid to ask people to wash their hands or use hand sanitizer or sit down while holding your baby. I got scoffed at a lot because I was a freak about that stuff with my first. While other people may have already had children this is YOUR first and you can be over-protective if you want. I thinks it's much better to be over-protective than under-protective.
EAeffKqSaa	Well I'm 16 weeks now and I feel great. I was lucky and had no morning sickness and few food cravings, nothing really strange just love frito lay chips and different types of cheese.     My baby bump, well let's just say I was showing at 8 weeks and now it looks like I have one of those kids bounce balls that you get at Walmart for $2. You can tell that I'm pregnant but I am smart, I love to wear Gap body work out clothes because they are SOO comfortable. My boobie are big that I can not even find a tank top that holds them In safely.   I think I have only gained maybe 5 or 6 pounds the hole time and that is because I eat a lot of meats, veggies, fruits and drink lots of water, juice and milk.   With a few treats here and there. I also take my 2 year old and pit bull out for walks just about every day as long it's not to cold or raining.     Well good luck to you and lots of baby dust.  Just remember every one is different.|`|JQcIwPXJaa	I still felt very very sick with both my lasting pregnancies. I was able to feel my uterus completely when pressing on my stomach. I was also able to feel my babies movements. Energy definitely starts to come back by 4 months and hopefully the sickness is subsiding. My four month mark usually brings on headaches.|`|W0d6NsGBaa	My morning sickness went away at 14 weeks and from then until about 28 weeks or so I felt GREAT. My stomach felt fine and I started feeling movement around 18 weeks (this is my second baby)  I was very lucky to have no cravings, no mood swings and not a lot of weight gain. Around week 28 is when I started to get quite uncomfortable......|`|dFo0k3zDaa	I felt GREAT!! My stomach was starting to get harder, more 'baby' less belly... In general I felt really good, my energy started coming back and I just felt better, probably because of the prenatal vitamins, never took vitamins before I got pregnant. I did start having some back pain around 4 months, but it soon went away when the baby moved into a new position... I started feeling the baby move at 17 weeks, I knew what it was the first time I felt it! I was amazing. Best of luck to you!!|`|iiUJHYNeaa	i was feeling some cramping, and i was getting bigger and craving almost everything in site|`|ebM6CxRQaa	Been there twice... and I feel TIRED. Both my pregnancies I never got sick but by the time I was 13 weeks I was getting awful headaches! I have had a headache for over two days and I take Tylenol but it never goes away. This pregnancy I am more tired because I have an 11 month old to chase around...    My stomach well... I feel bloated and chubby. Sometimes I get braxton hicks already with this baby... but my first pregnancy I felt nothing for many months (like sometimes women usterus stretches but I never had that feeling...)     Congrats and good luck!|`|eMwIh50Qaa	I'm coming to an end on my 4th month. I have YET to encounter morning sickness. I have been told that if I haven't had it by now I won't at all. This is my first pregnancy so I'm still adjusting to the differences. I honestly can say I don't feel pregnant. If it wasn't for my at-home doppler, ultrasounds at my doctor, and constant EATING...I wouldn't think I was pregnant. I starting getting a pooch around weeks 11 believe it or not. It's fairly big right now for only being 15 weeks. I guess I just feel "fat". I'm not meaning that in a rude way by any means, but my pre-pregnancy weight was 105...now I have this huge belly and weigh 116 pounds! LOL|`|aba81bf0dd1e368904161a0c15faf44caa	I can actually look back at my journal and tell you EXACTLY how I was feeling!    Hang on:  I'll get them!    My first pregnancy with my daughter, who is now almost 3 years old was kind of traumatic.  I had cholestasis of pregnancy, so I was itchy all the time.  But, I never had any morning sickness or anything.  I had just had a sophisticated ultrasound to look for genetic defects, so I got to see ALL the details of my baby down to her little fingers, etc.  I also ordered my first maternity clothes about that time, and some of my buddies at work started planning my baby shower.  My belly wasn't super big, but it was hard and if I laid on my stomach I could feel the mass of baby really well.    My second pregnancy was a lot easier.  I was showing more at that point, and felt a lot better with the second than the first.  I also knew we were having a boy... he cooperated more, lol.  I was a lot more emotional though, because I was pretty sure that he was probably going to be my last, so every little thing was "I'll never feel this way again", ya know?  Nostalgia.|`|zcujH5XDaa	OMG this is when i felt the best, my morning sickness had just went away and my stomach wasnt even starting to show yet which means it wasnt TOO BIG!!! i am now 30 weeks and it is impossible to get a decent nights sleep cuz i cant get comfortable!! I started to feel fluttery feelings in my belly around this time too, which were the baby's first movements that i could feel.....and it was completely amazing......these are the best months!!!!|`|12e623ece8e2076f52ee7aa40b058322aa	3 months I was still sick n nauseous. and at about 13 weeks I felt my baby move 4 da 1st time. My 4th month mayb about the 2nd week of my 4th month I stopped throwing up. And my baby was moving but I couldnt feel all da movements. So since then I got my energy back and I can actually get out the bed. And I actually wanna go out now. I can do daily activitied like cleaning n cooking. Around your 4th month your just relaxing. Well at least I am I don't have back pains or ne thing no sickness. Now that im 22 weeks I feel my baby move everyday all day. Its wonderful|`|32l02NtDaa	i have 2 boys. at 3/4 months i was tierd but felt fine.. i didnt get sick with either. and i didnt really have a lot of cravings. my boobs were tender and i had gained just a little weight. but i was mostly just tierd. hope i helped.|`|E8k3sERAaa	didnt feel too much think i was almost 5 months when i felt the first bit of movement. just felt a bit bloated and my stomach felt a bit hard. i mostly felt sick, smells that are normal like food,or window washer made me throw up. i couldnt eat crumpets for sum reason dont know why, you will start to get your craving about now asuming ur going to get one not everyone does mine was ice cubes just loved crunching them ate them everywhere, if i asked for a drink my boyfriend brought me a full glass if ice too.  good luck and enjoy!!!|`|em8A42Bqaa	3/4 months pregnant was 12-16 weeks and I think I felt okay, the morning sickness was going away and I started  to get a little more energy!|`|ZpIW9v1Baa	I still had a morning sickness routine.... Wake up... line the bathroom trash can with a garbage bag (because i always had to throw-up while i was peeing) pee & throw-up. Brush my teeth, gag, throw-up.. Take a shower, get dress, drink some oj or milk. (Oh yes the milk.... i would go through about a gallon a day once i hit 5 to 6 mo). Complain to someone about something, stop and get breakfast on my way to work. Listen to other coworker's pregnancy experiences everytime i turned the corner... and emails and phone calls. come home immediately go to sleep. wake up stuff my face... cuddle and complain go back to sleep :)
7gde2DRraa	Travel systems are way to bulky!  I got the Citi Mini by Babyjogger.  Its a 3 wheel stroller with bigger wheels and yet it is not a jogging stroller.  Its meant for everyday use on concrete and gravel terrain.  Its also pretty lightweight and collapses in half by simply pulling on the handle located on the seat.  You can literally collapse it with 1 finger while holding the baby!  I think this is the most awesome stroller and its fairly well priced at $219.99|`|b0c36350d835d81614a99e05c0418bf5aa	ugh, I couldn't stand that gigantic stroller (the travel system). I would go with the jogging stroller, especially considering you will be on gravel.|`|wURg3jBcaa	Ditto above.  I skipped the travel system and went straight for a BOB- it's the best and can go anywhere- through snow, gravel or just out on the streets.|`|nCKdkYSyaa	I HATED my evenflo travel system also I think anything is better than that! I think a jogger would be a great idea for what you want to use it for.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	only thing i know to tell u is take it somewhere that has gravel and try it out...|`|Jswomud7aa	I hated my evenflo travel system. When I had my 2nd baby I got a B.O.B. dual jogging stroller and it's friggin awesome!! I would totally recommend to anyone to get a B.O.B.
H7TqK6N1aa	byo baby bottles??    so strange!!!|`|p2Njf5gBaa	I am guessing they mean bring your own beverage.  And by bring your own beverage that means pretty much anything you want to bring.  If you want beer bring it, if you want liqueur bring it, if you want wine or soda, bring it.    With unisex baby showers, its pretty normal to serve an alcoholic beverage or two, or at least allow it.  I know at my baby shower they had some beer and spiked punch.  Then at the baby welcoming party I was thrown there was a slushy alcoholic drink.    I personally wouldn't show up with some bottles of booze, lol, but in that case I may bring a bottle of non alcoholic and a bottle of alcoholic Champagne to share with the ladies.      when people suggest BYOB, they usually do it to save money, and also to ensure that everyone has a beverage of choice.  That being the case, I am sure it would be okay to bring as you wish.  But.... tip to your friends husband,  the mother to be isn't going to be too happy if someone comes over and gets her hubby **** faced during the shower.    And, if they didn't want drinking at the shower, I don't think they would write BYOB.  They would probably write bring your own beverage, and in honor of the mother to be, we will be liquer free, or something like that.   I know I didn't mind if someone had a drink or two at my showers.  I didn't drink obviously, but some people enjoy an adult beverage at parties to celebrate.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	Typically there is no drinking at a baby shower since mom can't drink. The only way I can think that alcohol would be appropriate is if the guys are doing there own guy shower while the girls do one separately. Most likely you are right though.|`|phWUBtviaa	well byob does mean bring your own beverage.  but why not call the person who sent the invitation and ask them what it means?|`|wURg3jBcaa	I think he's right.  Typically BYOB is to tell you to bring your own alcohol.|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	It's kinda weird to have a "bring your own beer" type baby shower, but if men are invited too, I beleive that is what it means.  But I'd feel a little dumb walking in with a bottle of booze, if it was meant baby.  I would call if I was him!|`|dUNKIA6baa	i tink that doesnt mean that cuz how about f u dont  have a baby so it probably means bring your own beverage....|`|4ksa4lhWaa	LOL, NO It means bring your own liquor.  There will be no liquor at this party at all.    Im sorry boose     "Bring your own Boose"|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	Well technically BYOB does mean bring your own beer/liquor. But since this is a shower the host might be trying to be cute with the phrase that children can come as well. To be on the safe side, I would contact the host and ask to be sure.|`|MIgxkmIqaa	LOL!!! I dont know! Thats a good question! I would call and ask what it means! Could mean both. I have no idea!|`|tdHIR9cLaa	i did that on my invitation... and i was making a funny... BRING YOUR OWN BOTTLE.... baby bottle lol.... but it can mean different things
AA10196172	Normally diets are just to maintain your already-developed body. When you are pregnant, you are growing an entire body - brain, bones, heart, blood, liver and kidneys, muscles, etc - all from scratch, from one cell.     Each of these body parts need certain vitamins and minerals, as well as basic nutrients. Bones are calcium; the redi in blood is iron; also,  the majority of spinal development problems (i.s. spina bifida)  are preventable with appropriate doses of folic acid. Proteins, fats and carbs are the basic building blocks the body uses to grow.    All these nutrient have their uses. Shortages could lead to stunted or underdeveloped children. Fortunately in the modern world, even a bad diet has a lot of good nutrients. (Pizza has cheese and carbs and tomatoes. Hamburgers are actually real food.)      An adult can tolerate or recover from a bad diet with vitamin and nutrient shortages - like the one month banana and grapefruit diet - much better than a rapidly developing fetus can. If the nutrients aren't there the first few weeks the brain starts developing, for example, it may be difficult to make up for lost time and the child may be permanently handicapped.    As long as the baby gets a decent level and selection of nutrients, good diet - as in "eat your lean meat and organic vegetables, not ice cream  and pickles" - doesn't really matter.     One of the other things is that in the last few decades, due to the negative body image most women see from advertising, what's considered a good diet is too little. The starvation diet to keep yourself into a size 4 or 8 is nowhere near what is needed to grow an extra 10 or more pounds of fetus and placenta in months. Fortunately, women get wierd cravings to take care of that problem.|`|Jswomud7aa	Nutrition is important for not only your health but for the proper health and development of the baby.|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	First of all for the health of your baby...And it doesn't hurt to continue a healthy diet when you are not pregnant cause it will help you feel better.  But it keeps off unnecessary pounds that would come if you ate junk all the time and it just keeps you feeling good cause the baby takes a lot out of you...|`|faPKwClPaa	What the first poster said, and because pregnancy takes a lot out of you -- the best way to try to regain any of your strength and energy is to eat as healthy as possible.|`|e0xpYnv1aa	Don't know. Every single friend I have that has recently had a baby has eaten junk food their entire pregnancy and their babies turned out perfectly healthy.|`|vcNvEIOwaa	actually its because your baby is taking everything from you to nourish itself so it can grow properly.....if you don't replace those nutrients, your body won't function right and you become more prone to diesease and sickness.   This is actually good reason to eat healthy all the time....so your body can function right.|`|vue9NOhYaa	For the same reason it's important for ANYONE to follow a healthy diet.  We need to eat reasonably well in order to get all the nutrients our body requires.  When a woman is pregnant she also has to provide nutrients for the growing fetus.  And her body will supply the fetus first, so if the woman is malnourished, SHE is the one who will suffer.|`|6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	Because whatever you eat the baby will eat as well.  You need to make sure that you are giving your baby healthy foods so he will grow.|`|N6XTcGejaa	so that they have an easy pregnancy and an healthy baby; there are tips on a healthy diet here http://www.easyninemonths.com/pregnancy_...|`|98WKYtfwaa	So that the child growing inside them gets all the good nutrients from the food you eat.     A growing baby needs certain amounts of each vitamin and mineral out there, if you don't eat enough food containing those vitamins then the baby takes it from your system, which can leave you feeling tired and sick.|`|rOFteEdlaa	so you don't over gain weight and so the baby is healthy, if you drink Espresso the baby does to if you do drugs or drink beer the baby does to so that is why you need to eat properly|`|gG8oyymiaa	Because if you are not getting the vitamins and everything else that the baby needs.

em8A42Bqaa	Yeah, the bigger I get the more loving he becomes...my husband is being so nice that I am getting a little suspicious!  It's sweet though when he talks to her and he says he cant wait for her to come!  Cause he's a big kid and he needs someone to play with!|`|fbe600962a1348933b552a6e772b27b2aa	Yes, but only the nice guys do it. He's a keeper!|`|zoyw8CRKaa	My husband is away with the army at the moment and wont be back till the 31st of March before he left i was 12weeks and he spoke to my tummy a few times and kissed it etc he was still understanding the baby was there lol, now he is away he asks me to put the phone to my tummy so he can talk to it lol he tells it to look after its mummy whilst he is away and kisses etc its so amusing to hear him talk down a phone to my bump lol i will be 25 weeks when he gets back and huge (he will notice such a huge change) and i cannot wait till he can physically touch it etc again, i also cant wait till it responds to him it moves when my hand touches it etc and it kicked him once the biggest boot so far the day before he left and his face lit up bless him! so when he gets home and its moving in response to its daddy i cant wait.    BTW! that's soooo! sweet what your man did its gonna be such a daddy's baby by the sound of it. =)|`|ArtZwIbvaa	Yes, my husband often talked to my bump.  It's very sweet and not at all wierd!  In fact, it's a great way of him bonding with the baby and making sure baby recognises his voice when it is born.    You're lucky, you have a nice man!|`|633f92af55d6f55a6fb69f2a082b3f61aa	Be happy that he is just as excited about the baby as you are.  Some men couldn't care less until the baby arrives, and some even continue that behavior after the baby has arrived.    Don't let it freak you out at all, sounds like you are a lucky girl to have a man that is sharing in the joy of being a parent soon.    I'm envious LOL!    Congrats!|`|XG0EljaKaa	my boyfriend does  that. not when im sleeping well not that ive noticed. i quiet like it. its meant to make the baby use to the sound of his voice and will regnoise it when the baby is born. i think its pretty normal. good luck|`|gG8oyymiaa	Yes my boyfriend does this also. But lately my daughter has been getting a thrill out of kicking him in the head also. I find it....amusing to say the least.|`|3qI1oyFaaa	Aww that's adorable!!!    My boyfriend still feels a little funny talking to my tummy, I can tell, but he'll lay his head on it all the time and wait to feel/hear the baby. He talks to him once in a while, but he's not secure enough yet to just sit and start a conversation--instead he literally knocks lightly on my tummy and asks if anyone's in there... it's pretty hilarious...    Congrats and good luck!!!|`|MsYUpwI2aa	my hubby holds my bump a lot and he'll kiss my stomach, and talk to it, so i don't think it's weird it's actually sweet to see him do tht, because at first he was a little dissapointed about having a boy, but now he's as happy as i am about it.|`|qvLJorXeaa	AWW!!! that's so sweet my husband did the same thing to my bump, it is actually is very good he does that he is bonding with the baby and that way the baby will recognize his voice when the baby is born and he could give you a brake once in a while and you don't have to worry about the baby crying.|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	That is the sweetest thing ever!!  I am tearing up seriously!  That is awesome!  You will be able to tell your baby this story! :)  My hubby hasn't done that but he kisses my belly I will walk up to him and pull up my shirt and he will kiss it LOL!! :)|`|4kX61Y97aa	aww that really sweet, you know from that he's going to be a good dad. my boyfriend asnt done that but he does sing and hold bump alot.    all  the best|`|dnG7fhnbaa	Yeah, my hubby's always talking to our bump! I love it that he does...shows that  he'll be a good dad, and less likely to suffer from "baby envy" lol.    You're lucky to have a bloke like that! :o) x
be5IoBEmaa	For a boy, I think Sean is the best spelling.  It sounds like you're Irish, and so there's no reason to avoid the more authentic spelling.    Some of it depends on your surname, but Sean Mattius intrigues me.  I'd rank Sean Elijah  2 and Sean Jagger  3.    For a girl, I think you'd need a pretty good reason to use Murphy.  It just sounds so masculine, and maybe a bit ugly.  (But then, I knew one of those guys in college - big guy, big drinker.  It's hard for me to see Murphy and not hear someone bellow Murph!  Not pretty - or really appropriate for a child of EITHER gender!)    But then, Kennedy feels a little blah and Chasey seems awkward.  I can imagine her saying "Casey with an h" or "Like Chase with a y" every time she introduces herself.    So if Murphy Claire has meaning, I might risk it - and hope she turns out to be petite and graceful.  :)    Alternately, if you do have a boy, then Sean Murphy would be a stellar combo.    Best wishes!|`|BOJEbnCtaa	Shawn Michael is best and I like Kennedy Grace best.|`|3ea345aeac09b62e0de45c06218d2058aa	Sean Caden.  And  Kennedy Grace,  or,  Chasey Noelle      If i can make a suggestion,  Aiden's a cute name =]]|`|4jOaN0WIaa	Sean, definitely. Sean Michael. My nephew is Sean Patrick.  I don't like Murphy for a girl at all. Murphy is a last name. I love Claire though. Actually I like the middle names better than the first names. I think of Kennedy as a last name and I have never heard of Chasey.|`|AA11138222	I like Shawn the best.    Shawn Michael    I don't like Murphy or Chasey, but Kennedy is one of my favorite names for a girl.|`|0bZ6j0aSaa	I prefer the spelling Sean, i don't like any of the others.    I like Sean James,  Sean Michael (or Michael Sean so he doesn't sound too much like a wrestler!), Sean Elijah or Elijah Sean.    Elijah Sean is probably my favourite.    To be honest, i'm not so keen on any of the girls first names.  Murphy and Kennedy are surnames to me and i really dislike surnames being used as first names.  I just don't like Chasey at all.  The second names, however, are lovely.  I really like Noelle.|`|pLowAMeTaa	Shaun looks the cutest spelled out. Jagger and Caden are interesting names, but neither flow with Shaun as nicely as Elijah or Tyler. Chasey Noelle is a nice combination. I've never heard it before. Murphy Claire is different. Maybe you could spell Murphy with an "f" or "ie" to make it more feminine.|`|h57t7FAjaa	Hmm, i like all of the spellings of Sean... but I think I like Shawn the best!  Simple, straight-forward, a little different, & easy to pronounce!    Out of the mn's you have given, my favorites in order are:  Shawn Michael  Shawn Tyler  Shawn James    Some of the other names aren't bad, but I don't think they flow that well.    For your girls names...  I really like a lot of boys names on girls, & I think Kennedy Grace is beautiful!  I don't think the others are right for a girl though...  Although I really like Claire Noelle :)    Hope this helps, and good luck!|`|i53N81vXaa	Sean Caden|`|Elxuvon8aa	I like Shaun or Shawn but defiantly not Sean   James Mattius and Michael are all great   elijah for a middle name Like Noelle but really do not care for any of the girls names|`|uCnmYEPBaa	Shawn, that's my husbands name.    Shawn James    Kennedy Grace|`|484fd75888bbb282b3da584ad880893aaa	Shawn Elijah is a great name.  Kennedi Grace is cute for a girl.     Murphy is better for a boy. :-)|`|zbjaBgyEaa	I like the spelling SEAN best.  Like Sean Connery (who is a total bamf).  It's the original spelling, and to me, the most aesthetically pleasing.  I think Sean Michael works best.  It's my favourite combination.    I don't really LOVE any of the girls names - they're just not my style.  I dislike unisex names.  I suppose Murphy Claire is the best.  It's got a nice flow.  Even though I think Claire Murphy would be preferable.|`|glGVuKAEaa	I like Sean.     Sean Michael sounds best. I like the name James, but two one-syllable names together doesn't sound great.    Claire and Noelle are alright, but I'm not really fond of any of them.|`|NWEJdpocaa	Sean Jagger  Sean Mattius     Kennedy Grace is my favorite of the 3...however I love the name Claire, just not fond of Murphy.|`|MW1yrHbOaa	I LIKE SEAN, BIY IT WOULD BE BETTER AS A MIDDLE NAME  CADEN SEAN IS CUTE, KENNEDY GRACE IS BEAUTIFUL|`|7J9wLeYVaa	shawn eli  kennedy grace|`|c3CVY87caa	Kennedy Grace is my favorite girl name    Shaun Michael and Shaun Tyler are great names... although I personally would choose Shaun Michael over S.T. because Tyler is my name LoL :)    hope this helps|`|VGij9p0Taa	Hope i helped!   My favourite spelling is Sean!   Out of the following names i love Elijah, James, Caden and Michael.   Jude is good two - i agree with your little brother i lol like Shawn Michaels without the s lol.   Out of the girl names i like Claire Murphy not Murphy Claire love the spelling of Claire is so pretty and elegant. I dislike Kennedy but Grace is beautiful i like Noelle too. Maybe Grace Noelle that would be really pretty.  Good luck i hope i was useful.|`|5DB6nOXkaa	Sean Caden and I really like Murphy Claire (I love using traditionally boy names for girls) if she doesn't like it later in life she can always go by Claire.  Kennedy has been one of the most commonly used names in the last 10 years, and if you name her Chasey, she'll have to deal with her name being pronounced incorrectley for the rest of her life.|`|DdjpQr0Gaa	I like Shaun Caden by far.  I love Caden.  I also think Murphy is great but I like it with either Noellle or Grace.  Not a big fan of Claire, sorry|`|9kdUmttPaa	I have always preferred Sean. James is good. Michael, also. Caden is different but, I like it. I don't mind the first and second girls' names but, I don't like the third at all.|`|uS07WAwcaa	I like the spelling " Shawn  For the middle name, I think that James sounds the best.  However, Shawn (or whichever way you end up spelling it) is hard to pair with a middle name and to me in most cases is better as a middle name. For example i think that these sound better:  Elijah Shawn  Tyler Shawn  Michael Shawn instead of  Shawn Elijah  Shawn Tyler  or Shawn Michael ( i actually like that one)    Out of the girl names, my favorite one is Kennedy Grace. It is a very pretty name.  :)

Amelia Morgan  Amelia Aura  Amelia Elise|`|i2V17yi4aa	most def. Amelia...the other one is ugly|`|c3CVY87caa	Amaya... it is less common.  As far as Amelia goes, I prefer Amelie (kinda like Emily), but out of the two I definately prefer Amaya.|`|MW1yrHbOaa	AMAYA|`|7J9wLeYVaa	amelia all the way|`|bUcWxQqpaa	kalia kacy|`|VGij9p0Taa	Both are nice with good meanings Amaya meaning dark rain and Amelia meaning nobel. The japanese name Amaya is really interesting and unique, furthermore if you name your child this she would probably be the only one with this name. Amelia the origin German is very classy and i adore it with the name Jane. The name would never go out of fashion and is a timeless classic, she would probably share this name with others however it wouldn't be that popular. Amelia ages well where as i struggle to see an eighty year old with a name like Amaya. So because of this i would go with Amelia.  Hope i helped....|`|a48b8f799e030a044da781ffac6f94cdaa	Definitely Amelia - lovely name|`|fk7ZA9b8aa	Amelia|`|1TPGdaXJaa	Amelia|`|9tMT4SQUaa	Amelia.

bc70ab753e4a475fa0acef22552ded1caa	You need to hit the library and get you a expectant parent book this will help you out alot or check out alot of these online websites like pregnancyabout.com. No there is never a dumb question if you don't know the answer how you going to get it if you don't ask.   1.) Normally around 18-20 weeks you get an ultrasound and can give you the gender. You should hear the heart beat at the doctors office around 10-14 weeks  2.) No not everyone's stomach gets hard at 3 months depends are how slim you are and the size of the baby. A lot of ladies can feel for the hard spot in there stomach to find the baby by the 3rd month though and your doctor can show you where the top of your uterus is and how to feel for this.   3.) Do not take on any strenous activities that you are not normally involved and of course don't be climbing ladders and try to avoid falls. As far as food is concerned, you need to avoid soft cheeses like brie or feta, and deep sea fish like muscles, oysters, clams and even limit your tuna intake. At your first Dr. appt your doctor will often give you a list of these things if not just ask they normally have them around the office.   4.) You should stay on your pre-natal vitamins your whole pregnancy and at least 6 weeks post -partum they are helpful to stay on longer if you are breastfeeding .    As far as you mom not being to into answering your questions that could be a blessing for you, she could be all in your business and giving you way to much advice. Good Luck and congrats.|`|Bs8sllD9aa	1) Around 20 weeks     2) Yes your belly will get hard at what month I don't remember    3) Raw seafood, hot dogs, cat box , drugs, alcohol, over the counter drugs without doctors ok    4) Until after baby is born and if you are going to breast feed than you want then you want to take them until you are done|`|AykczQleaa	1. Anywhere around 17+ weeks is generally a good time to try to find out.    2. no not everyones will get hard.    3. avoid anything that makes you uncomfortable or uneasy    4. you should take a prenatal vitamin daily unitl you give birth unless you are going to breast feed then you need to continue to take it until you are done breast feeding.     No question is dumb if you really don't know the answer.    :)|`|t6OGh0Edaa	1) 18-20 weeks depending on the doctor they have to do an ultrasound.    2) I think everyone's stomach does get hard as far as if you push on it you can feel the uterus but depending on how you are built and since this is your first you might not get the cute beach ball look.  I am a taller, framier girl and I didn't start showing at all until 20 weeks or 5 months.    3)The basics to avoid would be the obvious alcohol, drugs, smoking but other then that a lot of people including myself stay away from sugar, caffeine, anything that really isn't healthy for isn't healthy for baby.    4) I think you are refering to your prenatal pills and you will take those through the end of pregnancy and possibly after if you choose to breastfeed.    No question is dumb! Hope this helps! Have fun and good luck!|`|7KjxpGZtaa	1.  Gender can be determined as early as 14 weeks, but I personally don't feel that u/s gender determination is accurate until at least 18 weeks (take it from someone who has been told the wrong gender w/ 2 different babies at about 16 weeks only to find out at 20 weeks they were the opposite sex).    2.  It's different for each person.  I would say in general at 3 months your stomach should still be pretty normal feeling/looking.    3.  Of course things like nicotine and alcohol.  You also want to avoid fish that are high in mercury.  You can have tuna, but limit it to about 1 can a week.  You definately want to avoid unpasturized cheeses (like feta, gorganzola, and brie) or anything made with raw eggs - like merienge on top of pies - because it can cause a condition called listeriosis (pardon the spelling if that isn't quite right).  You can still have caffine you should just make sure you are only having minimal amounts - like a soda or tea with dinner.  If you normally drink a lot of soda you don't want to cut it out completely because all that will do is make you miserable.    4.  You should take the prenatals as long as possible - even for a few months after you have the baby.  Once you have the baby your body will need some time to get back to only taking care of you.  And if you are planning to breastfeed then you will definately need the extra vitamins.|`|AA12107422	1] The most common month that will be most efficient to find out the gender of your little one is around 20 weeks. After 18 weeks will be most accurate to tell if its a he/she. Anything earlier than that is too risky to start painting pinks & blues in the room =]    2] Not every ones stomach gets hard in the third month. I think it just depends on how your body is built & how big/fat the baby is. Just look more towards the 4-5 month to really start feeling a difference.    3] I think some of the main things to avoid are certain fish & NO sushi. I can't put my finger on very many foods NOT to eat, but if you look online, I am pretty sure you can find a few sites that tell you what not to eat at all.    4] Prenatal vitamins. I took them as soon as I found out I was pregnant & didn't stop taking them until about a month AFTER I had the baby. Your body is still missing some of those essential nutrients/vitamins that were depleted when you were pregnant & I also breastfeed for the first 8 weeks. Remember that the baby will get what it needs from you -- so you taking these vitamins, will help you [& the baby of course] in the long run!!    No question is really a dumb question, especially when you are expecting a tiny miracle!!    Good Luck & Congrats ?|`|7KEW7fxxaa	1)depends what kind of test you get done because I had the blood test at right around 10-12 weeks and that told me what it was. They did do an ultrasound later to confirm.  2)My stomach didnt but I am a lil overweight  3)Try to avoid tons of caffine and lots of sugar because you could get gestational diabetes  4)I believe you take it up till the very end as I am only 28wks 5 days and still taking mine    You can look at babycenter.com and see week by week stuff and go through and ready different things to avoid and what you can expect. Hope this helps you. My best tool has been the internet and asking friends.|`|iiUJHYNeaa	1. They say u can tell as early as 16 weeks HOWEVER they wont perform an ultrasound to tell the gender until your 18th-24th week.    2. No, everyones pregnancy is different though when i was in my 3rd month my stomach was very hard    3. They say u should avoid tuna cause of the mercury content, raw cookie dough (because the raw eggs might contain bacteria) and different types of fish besides tuna again because of mercury content, they also tell u to take it easy on the chocolate and coffee because too much caffiene isnt good for the little one    4. You have to take the vitamins everyday till the baby is born. after the baby is born u can stop taking them

But most liely they will be asking the person that has your power of attorney because you will most likely be unable to speak for yourself.|`|rNmJT0ntaa	save the baby!!!!|`|RPszYGXkaa	Well since I am a mother to my baby girl, and a wife to my husband, I would say "save me".  I know it sounds harsh, but I think of the impact it would have on my child to grow up motherless and my husband to parent our daughter alone, and the choice is clear (not easy, but clear).  I hope you don't have to make that choice.|`|J4W68owgaa	Save the baby.|`|c2kopbo6aa	i'd tell him save the baby first.      I wouldnt care about him not having a mom because i know his dad would be great and find someone wonderful to love and someone who would love Jonah just as much...i know his dad would make it clear to him that i loved him enough to make that choice and never to be sad about it...and to be grateful for what he has|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	the baby although in reality mums always come b4 baby  ( i was sad enough to ask )|`|44OH7Si6aa	I would say my baby, however my husband and I discussed this and he feels the opposite. In fact, he wouldn't speak to me for the rest of the day when I said I wouldn't change my mind. Chances are the doctor will save the mom though|`|gx4s68s8aa	Since I have a daughter at home then no question - save me.|`|Lpsx8qUfaa	Save your baby first
0wjn0d22aa	Well since you already have a child, you know that it IS possible. You really never know though. Even though you miscalculated, you might not be pregnant but wait a few days or weeks and get yourself a test either at home or at the Doctor. The deed is done so don't freak out, just relax and wait for the outcome.|`|ffAmoqFTaa	Just go get the morning after pill! Everything will be alright!|`|jLLkSWyiaa	just chillax... i doubt  your prego
7KjxpGZtaa	Wow that was a teensy bit confusing lol.      If you haven't had sex since Dec. 9 then that of course is the absolute last chance you could have gotten pregnant.  If that is the case then you will be due around Sept. 1 (because we would have to assume that you ovulated within a couple of days of that date).  So at least you know you have to be due before September :)    In your situation I would just wait till you have an ultrasound done because that is probably going to be the only accurate way to date your pregnancy.  Based on all the information you gave I would give it a range of about Aug 17 - Sept 1 if I had to guess.|`|4lKc0gCfaa	The best way to know is have an ultrasound.  Good luck.
niX6gIZHaa	I took a tip from Supernanny and I started letting my daughter know when time was winding down.  I let her know we're leaving in 10mins, then 5mins, then 1min so it wasnt a shock to her when it was time to go.  It usually works.    If all else fails, I am a firm believer in spanking (on occasion) and when my kids behaved this way I always asked them if they wanted me to take them to the bathroom.  They knew what that meant and they promptly straighted up.      Good Luck!|`|J4W68owgaa	I agree with the first poster, she's trying to get attention and by giving her attention and trying to reason with her, you're entering into a power struggle with her.    The next time she does this, say to her, "I will be right over there." Then walk away. Don't try to reason with her, don't try to bribe her, don't even attempt to calm her down. Children have tantrums and I know it's embarrassing and you'll deal with a few dirty looks, it's really the best thing you can do. Just ignore the tantrum.    If it happens at home, pick her up, put her in her room and shut the door.     After the tantrum, carry on as if nothing happened, don't try to talk to her about it, punish her, apologize---nothing. Just continue like nothing happened.    She's trying to assert her Independence. She isn't trying to be naughty, she's just trying to get her way and be heard. You need to teach her that is not the way to do it.    It's normal, but hang in there, this stage doesn't last too terribly long.|`|1oJtJCaWaa	For a child of that age, temper tantrums are usually to get your attention.  As embarrassing as it sounds, I believe the best way to dissolve this behavior right away is to not give her the attention that she seeks with the bad behavior.  Ignore it.  Instead, give her the attention when she is well behaved.  You could also try to reinforce this by punishing bad behavior (taking away things she likes) or rewarding good behavior.    The only way to beat this, regardless of the tactic you try is consistency.      Hope this helped!
AA10196172	I suspect troll, but here goes...    You play, you pay. No way out of it. you can try to hide your money, or spend it. But you're killing your own life to spite her.    Most states aren't into alimony nowadays. The ex-wife or whatever is on her own. But every state will make you pay child support, and the government probably has reciprocal agreements with a number of other countries too. If you're smart enough to get that rich, you're smart enough to Google which countries have reciprocal support enforcemetn agreements.    Besides, where would you go to hide? You could tell everyone you're going to Israel and buzz off to Thailand for example, but sooner or later someone will find you; and what are you going to do for money? Is your job that portable? Or buy a sailboat, put all your cash in the Bahamas, and sail around the world so she can't find you. But, when you do settle somewhere, you can still be slapped with a suit for back payments.     If you're that rich, in the millionaire category, hire a good lawyer to dig up the dirt on her past, and sue for child custody. Then she pays you support.     All of which boils down to - nope, there's no way out of it. The only way out of it is to have slick lawyers that would cost you twice as much as child support payments in the first place.    Think of it this way - the debt you owe is to your child, not some ex. Think outside the box; for example, buy her a house, let her live in it, keep title, but sell it when the kid's 21 and off to college. The judge will think "wow, what a devoted father" she won't need money for rent, so your support payments should be lower.    But in the end, I think this is a troll.|`|1bcYl6SKaa	Wow I really feel sorry for the kid.  Knowing that one day this child will grow up and see what kind of man you are....the shame this child will feel....|`|ugvgt6rMaa	Grow up and take care of your baby. Hello its yours and yes she could look for you and get child support for your baby.|`|8d89b255ad0cc448257f013c1fb8f3a8aa	Are you for real? Sorry, it's not your decision.|`|uuceuyRyaa	Get a life and grow up!    Your retarted!|`|dPULl5hjaa	Yep, she can get you anywhere in this world!  Just face it you'll be paying child support for 18 yrs.  Leave the country, very mature of you.    You say you're 30.......you're not a man...........you're an immature boy.  Why didn't you insist on wearing a condom?     You say you're desperate - you're pathetic piece of work.|`|euUZZcM3aa	It's not your decision. You should have doubled up on contraceptives if you're so against having children at this point in time. If you don't want to be part of it, the best thing you can do is leave and pay for child support. There's no way around it. If you left the country, you'd still owe for child support. Lets say you left for 10 years, and came back, you could be owing her huge!!! It adds up. I know because my mother left my family when I was young and now resides somewhere in korea, and if she ever came back, she'd still owe my dad tons of child support $.    Just owe up to your responsibilities.|`|s1utniuvaa	I truly hope that you are full of crap and just trying to get some laughs... if not, you are a jerk.|`|em8A42Bqaa	LOL are you serious?  This is funny (I needed that) you wont have to be tied down if you leave her...coward maybe, tied down, no!  You      should leave the country b/c I think she will be better off!|`|zSABr7praa	So THIIIIIS is what the guys who can't actually find girlfriends do!  You're hilarious.|`|AA10390690	this gave me a good laugh. as we see men still can't mature as fast as women and in this case you have a lot of maturing left to do. if you leave the country your just being a big whimp! do what's right and separate and unfortunately if she pushes for it you WILL have to pay for child support. and guess what, you CHOSE to have unprotected sex with her, moron! i'm so glad my daughter's father is a helluva lot better of a father than what you probably will be... and she's NOT going to abort the baby at 6mths that's just MURDER|`|kebzJDkJaa	you are an asshole who shouldve wrapped ur little dick up and accepted the fact that even with a condom, she could get pregnant. u need to die if you are going to leave the country you dick. next time make sure that u wrapped it up dumbass!!!|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	Yup she can get you for child support no matter what. "she got herself pregnant" Dumbass! You had sex with her so like it or not your gonna be a daddy! your 30 years old for god sakes your not a young kid, you dont have that much living left to do you old bag. And what the F*ck is your problem, you DO NOT EVER put you hands on a pregnant woman, and just for your info she is 6months its illegal to get an abortion now, you seem like a horrible person and I when the baby's born give up your parental rights to the child, so you cant be near it or have anything to do with it, but your still gonna be paying child support.      IF YOU DIDNT WANT A BABY THEN YOU SHOULDNT HAVE HAD SEX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|cj7sSPZEaa	Yes she can go after you you idiot!  Why are you being a coward?  YOU HAD SEX WITH HER- NOW TAKE SOME RESPONSIBILITY- BE A MAN AND TAKE CARE OF YOUR CHILD!  People like you make me sick.  GOOD FOR HER for not getting an abortion.  You should have wrapped it up if you weren't ready.  Get a vasectomy if you don't want more kids.  I hope she goes after you for everything you have.|`|QWpTBM8jaa	EPIC FAIL!!!    You're screwed.|`|pp9RzHvDaa	Oh I didn't know women could get themselves pregnant.  Please explain.  Douche bag.  Its's not some kid, it's your kid.  I'm glad she's not having an abortion.  Man up and quit being a little boy.  Act your age.  Guess what?  She will come after you for money, for child support for that baby.  It's your job to provide and I hope she leaves your abusive *** and takes you for all you're worth.|`|Oa27YThhaa	You can't force her to get an abortion, that's a fact.  You can either try to make it work with her or leave her, but there's always a possiblity that she may ask for child support.  My best answer is to prepare to be a father.  There were ways to prevent this, so you have to live with your actions.  You cannot completely blame her because you can force the use of condoms (or supply your own if she put pin holes in them).|`|zRvGIN8Zaa	Sorry, but your answers are not going to help anyone talking like this.    This guy needs help, and if you guys haven't realised.. this website is called yahoo ANSWERS  GIVE HIM ANSWERS!  (i'm just saying this, because with all these stupid answers, nobody is going anywhere.. i couldn't help you if i tried, i'm only 17 :P)|`|8EwwSlZ6aa	You should have kept it in your pants then.    If you posted for laughs, here it is:    Sex creates babys, babys create responsibility, if you want neither...KEEP UR WILLY IN UR CALVINS.|`|iiUJHYNeaa	of for ***** sake thats what u get when u dont use protection idiot! its the womans choice to have the baby or not it is in her body therefore its her choice, and its too late for her to have an abortion. and how do u know she just wants ur money? she could just be very deeply in love with u. it doesnt matter what u want, u got her pregnant so take responsibility grow up and be a damn father to your child. no matter where u go, u will have to pay child support because it is your baby. running away and hiding wont solve the problem, and if u dont wanna go to jail keep your ****** hands off her and u wont have to worry about going to jail. its your fault u would be taken to jail not hers. ur 30 years old for ***** sake grow up, grow some balls, be a man and take care of your son/daughter|`|4Uuehq2Faa	6 months pregnant, and you want her to terminate, THIS LATE?  I can understand you ASKING her under 12 weeks, but 6 months!  Your messed up.  How dare you force a women to try and end a pregnancy  It has always been her decision, and you should know by now shes MADE her decision and thats the way it goes, get used to it!  I hope she leaves you, runs away with the baby and DOES get you for child support, because you dont deserve this beautiful baby  You get physical with her? shes 6 months pregnant!!  Why even be in a relationship with someone who wants children if you dont want any, your an idiot plan and simple  your 30 and you are acting like this? grow up!|`|fE5zMOfJaa	Whether or not your asking this question for laughs...you really are messed up in the head & I think you need to get some help.  I feel bad for you 'cause either way, you're a loser.  And it seems like you're proud of that which is even sadder.  You definitely need to get a life!|`|CbGkQklXaa	If you didn't want this baby you should of have protected sex. It takes TWO to do a baby.if you make so much money I don't see what's the problem on giving your baby couple of hundreds. If you are 30 act like one not like a 15 year old|`|80Zlwifsaa	She is already six months pregnant genius, maybe you should have thought of the possiblility of pregnancy before having sex. She didn't get herself pregnant.     Sounds like her and the baby would be better off without you anyway, and I hope that she files for support and you have to pay the maximum. If you aren't going to be there physically and emotionally for your child then the least you can do is support it financially since you have a TON of money. If you have so much then you won't miss a little.    Leaving the country will just make it more difficult to find you, but when they do as long as you are working they can attach your wages.     You suck|`|CgGIbExVaa	omg ur a real asshole . why dont u be a man and take care of your child ? Btw it takes 2 to make a baby and u say ur 30 then act like it and help her with this child and be in the childs life .|`|dzbyaN20aa	Ok...    first off, stop with the physical. That WILL land you in jail, and your life will be much more ****** than having a kid, trust me.    Second, go talk to a lawyer. If you think she's only after you for your money, she probably is. Offer to help her put the child up for adoption. If she refuses, tell her you want her to sign something saying she won't ask you for money, and leave her.    If she refuses, I think you're just screwed. Your lawyer might be able to offer some more help, but with the way the legal system is set up, girls like her can work it so they don't have to worry about money ever.    Oh, and you might want to leave her anyway. Even if you end up paying her child support, its still less than supporting her in a relationship.     Good luck|`|AA10843092	First off, I hope that you've learned condoms and spermicides are  men's best friend and not an enemy,and should be used at all times. Second If you really would like to avoid fatherhood either celibacy, or vasectomy.      Now, enough of avoidance and on too the present, I suggest you get council both legal and psychological cause that baby is on the way and the only way out is if the blood test reads you are not the father.     Bottom line: You are possibly someones father and they don't need to know the drama between you and their mama be a man and step up and it doesn't mean you have to be with mama to be that child's papa.|`|a4NVYIwyaa	I got a tip for ya!  Keep your Mr. Peter zipped up and don't let him out!  This what happens when you let him out.  He does bad things like getting girls you don't want to be married to knocked up.    Just a bit of advice don't hump someone unless you want to spend the rest of your life with them because stuff like this happens. And a poor child is the product of your just wanting to get some.  How much more freggin self-centered can you be!  You let Mr. Peter out to PLAY now its time to PAY!|`|7dMWNh9aaa	wtf!!!  a baby is a beautiful thing and i can't believe you wouldn't want one. your girlfriend is going to have this baby whether you like it or not and you should be giving her the best respect and love a person can give. she probably did this for you, so you guys can improve your relationship. children normally bring couples together.  If you didn't want the child then why the f*** did u have sex with her.  SOME KID??? that is your kid and you should love him/her. How would you feel if you would have to grow up and not have a father. have your mom tell you the story of your father and tell you that HE DIDN'T WANT YOU. There must be something wrong if you don't want that child and make her/him and your girlfriend live a miserable life because you left and didn't want anything to do with them. imagine how hard it's going to be for YOUR girlfriend who you used to love and still should. you loved her enough to have a child. love doesn't just go away. it's still there but your afraid of her having a baby. which makes you a wimp. be a man and stay with your girlfriend and raise the child. you said you were 30. it's time to settle down and raise a family. you should have already had that done long ago.sorry for writing so much but you made me so mad. just think about what i said and take the advice.
uQAZEzq2aa	All babies are blessings....God does not make misteaks and he has a  plan for you and for that baby. It might not be apparent right now but everything happens for a reason. Dont get an abortion, thats not the answer. Trust that everything is gonna be okay and just be happy that you get to experience the miracle of life again. Some people never get that opportunity. Good Luck and God Bless!!|`|4f99f7c67b8e7876c11d72aefec784f9aa	I will not tell you either way.  I am not in your position.  I do not know you, your child, your mother, the father, etc.    That said, I believe you should do what you believe is best in your situation.  You know this better than anyone posting on here.    Best wishes.|`|t3eJ0Y3caa	I think you should keep the baby.Yeah, its going to be hectic at times, but if you are living at home with mom, my guess is you have a supportive family and that's a plus.  Stick with getting that degree, its for you and your children s  future!  If you wait until you can afford kids, you may never have one!|`|J4W68owgaa	If it was me, I would keep the baby. Like you said, it won't end your dreams or goals, it will just slow it down a bit. Yes, money will be tight, but that's always the case. I know it's scary, but you CAN do it. It does take a bit of an adjustment to go from 1 kid to 2, but women do it all the time and you can too!!    Good luck mama.|`|21Wk2mu5aa	You are the only one who can decide this answer.    Since you are already pregnant it's a little too late for making smart decisions and thinking things through.     All you can do now is follow your heart.|`|uuceuyRyaa	Put it up for adoption would be the best way :)|`|Ij6JMY4Xaa	Have the baby. Everything happens for a reason! Congrats on the new baby!|`|zSABr7praa	If you don't feel this child is right for you right now, I would google adoption in your state.  There's SO many great couples who are unable to have children of their own, your situation could be someone else's greatest gift.|`|dPULl5hjaa	Adoption is your best option!|`|em8A42Bqaa	Well you sound like you are okay with it all and you seem to have a good plan.  I would be a little hurt that my bf or whatever has another baby on the way, but you seem to be a pretty strong gal!   Congrats!|`|90zcKChJaa	This is a question that only you are able to answer. It sounds like you have a whole lot going on, and with your man having a baby with another woman, that discourages me to think he's worth being a good father.    Keep going at your education though! I'm a nursing student with a 2 year old and I am pregnant. Scared of what the future holds, but everything seems to work itself out. ;)|`|a169a0735b83b7ed12f616a7190a2202aa	Keep the baby or you will only regret it.  My heart goes out to you!  But really, keep the baby!|`|Vvp4x9Mlaa	Have an abortion. I'll even help you pay for it.|`|lFlapW8maa	then what are you going to do with the child? ugh?  keep your baby.  ugh?  how could you not.  you are a mother.  look at your  2 year old and consider giving him/her up, killing him/her.  how could you.  ugh.  wow.      a mother- sacrifice thats what we do.  woman up and just do it.  by the way.  stop having sex.  i know it sounds rude.  but hey it keeps getting you in trouble.  and you are pretty fertile.  ugh.  just do what you gotta do and consider who your baby will be in the future.  ugh.
2132783ce4174cf5fcb9d3bc217c0981aa	Genetics are about odds.  As long as the gene is present, it's possible for it to become the dominant gene.  It's most likely that the most common gene prevails, but it's a roll of the dice every time.  No way to tell for sure.  Out of the 4 grandparents, the the 3 white genes have the higher percentage.|`|8d89b255ad0cc448257f013c1fb8f3a8aa	I have no idea. Neither will anyone else. I didn't know there were albino black people! :)|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	What does the father look like?  The baby will probably be a mix between mom and dad, but with three out of four grandparents being white, the baby is probably going to be fair complected.|`|dPULl5hjaa	Your baby will be lighter skin - 1/2 white & 1/2 black|`|AA10693194	the baby has a chance of being any color at all! It all depends on the genetics! a white child(white mother and white father) can be born black! if there is black in the family anywhere there is a chance of the baby being black.    the child you aretalking about will most likely be born half black/white. not albino like the father

It tells you optimal times to have sex, what things to look for in our body.. there is so much info.    Good luck trying to conceive, I hope God blesses you with a little miracle :)
RPszYGXkaa	I lost mine before 36 weeks (didn't notice it at the time, just thought it was more discharge then normal).  I was induced at 38 1/2 weeks b/c I was 4 cms dilated and 95% effaced.  Hope it happens soon!|`|J4W68owgaa	I lost mine 3 weeks before I had my son.|`|a169a0735b83b7ed12f616a7190a2202aa	I lost part of mine 3 days before and the rest came out the night before.  That is one nasty little ball of mucous, isn't it?|`|mJm6VuwGaa	I lost mine around 8am and had my baby at 4pm.  Everyone is different.
LiPoEBenaa	Absolutely! You inhale 2nd hand smoke! Since the marijuana is unfiltered it can lead to a lot more THC being absorbed in your system and in your babies. Also, it's important to not even let the baby be around it after he/she is born since 3rd hand smoke (what the baby can pick up from touching a smoker or breathing it in off the fabric of clothes) has been linked to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome in babies (SIDS)|`|jSBtdhf0aa	yes it does affect the sperm.|`|3ea345aeac09b62e0de45c06218d2058aa	Yes|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	As long as he's not around you, it won't hurt you or the baby.  But, it's expensive and he should be saving all of the money he can right now.|`|Ij6JMY4Xaa	yes it can effect the sperm. but as far as i know it doesn't cause anything serious.|`|bedYivaWaa	dude you should be smoking it to its really good for the baby|`|a169a0735b83b7ed12f616a7190a2202aa	As long as he doesn't smoke it around you, the baby should be fine.  I would strongly encourage him to quit now though.  That's not something you want around your child when he/she is born.  I would guess it could affect the sperm mobility and count, but really as far as the actual baby, there's little risk.  But I stress that he quit NOW.|`|s1utniuvaa	Does he smoke around you? Yes it could. Hopefully he has the sense to stop before the baby is born.|`|4Uuehq2Faa	Yes it can, anything in the air can affect the unborn  You have the be careful of the people around you  sneezing,coughing etc.. alcohol,smoking etc..  You need to tell your spouse its not ok to smoke around you  Tell him to go out somewhere or go outside to smoke it  He should do it to protect his baby  If he doesnt he obviously doesnt care much|`|h7McguHGaa	I've actually tried to research this and unfortunately there is not a lot of evidence whether or not marijuana has an effect on pregnancy.  I know a few people that where around it or smoked during pregnancy and everything was fine.  I wouldn't over-do it though.  A friend of mine used to wear one of those paper masks that doctors wear whenever she was around it.  As far as the sperm goes, I doubt it would have any effect on the baby considering that the baby doesn't even begin developing until it's inside of you and gets its resources from you.
XVe2Jkbsaa	Yeah, it has happened before. My teacher's grandma had her period throughout all her pregnancies, it's quite rare though.|`|dPULl5hjaa	it's possible|`|koAaPXKQaa	It is possible. Very rare, but possible. If you think that you are in the early stages of pregnancy and are experiencing bleeding, then you should contact your GP as this generally isn't the norm.|`|7KjxpGZtaa	Yes it is possible.  It's not common but definately possible.      Usually if you do the period is lighter and will not last as long but that isn't always a guarentee either.
yT3ZNEROaa	Your son isn't obsessed with the movie, he just really likes it.  There are cars talking, with bright colors, and there's lots of action in that movie.  My children are 3 and almost 5 and both have their favorite movies.  Finding Nemo for instance my three year old son could watch two times a day if I let him.  I don't think your son has speech delays because of the movie.  I do think limiting the time to the tv watching all together was a good idea though.  You and your husband should compromise.  Like do the 20 min's before bed 7 days a week, and on Sunday afternoon watch a movie together. Make it a family time.  As far as the speech, talk and explain things to your son.  Make him say the word for things he's asking for.  If he can point at the tv and say ugh and you turn it on for him, there's no reason for him to ask you to turn it on.  When your doing something ask him to say what it is.  Like are you hungry for a snack.  Now can you say snack?  Your snack is an apple, I wonder if you can say apple.  Give lots of praise.  Well good luck, I hope this helps a little.  Feel free to email me with any more thoughts or questions.  -Lisa|`|VwMkiLFPaa	At this age, they like repetition. My 2 yr old son went through a phase of watching Monsters, Inc. Obsessed also. Then it was Shrek, then Space Chimps (ughhhh!) and now our latest is Cars.     The benefit to repetition? He spits out new words ALL THE TIME. I think its great that he can learn new words, new characters, and comes up with new interests. My son has always been into sports and of course he loves dogs too. So when he was into Cars, it didnt surprise me. And when he got into Air Buddies with puppies, since he loves dogs, it didnt surprise me about that either. My son watches a bit of TV, but we also spend LOTS of time playing, interacting, and enjoying time outdoors. The key here is MODERATION.     Since our current move is Cars, we look out for Cars workbooks to do. Whether its painting, or a counting workbook, or an ABC workbook.we use the theme to help teach. And it works great! We count the racecars go around the track, we count the number of laps, etc. It is what you make of it.    Also, my son watched Baby Einstein as a newborn and right now, at age 2, if you put on a Classical CD, hell probably sit and listen to the entire CD. Everyone has their opinions on the television and what kids should watch and how much. But as a parent, you know your child best. If you feel hes watching too much TV, then limit what he can watch. And try to do other activities. Spend time outdoors, do artwork online, etc.|`|aWckGacbaa	most kids that age are obsessed with something...my 2 yo is obsessed with little einsteins show..  he will watch the same episode over and over for days.    congrats on getting the tv watching under control but i would let him pick what he wants...he will move on in his own time... my 9 yo did the same thing..|`|qPrMM2r6aa	First and foremost: It is normal. And I do agree about the speech delay (but it could also be from other reasons, you should contact your local Parents As Teachers program, they are WONDERFUL!)     Watching TV shouldn't be used just before bed time, I think. I think it gets them a little bit too riled up.    My son was also obsessed with Cars and Toy Story. He will be 3 in March and is still obsessed with Cars. He would "freak" if I didn't let him watch it over and over and over.     How did I break the habit?     Easy. I bought "Cars" cars, the ones with the launchers. I bought a remote control Mater (super 2-year old friendly even though the box says 3+). I bought a Cars race track. I also bought all the Cars books I could find (coloring books, Little Golden Books, etc.). This took a few months to aquire everything (those darn cars are so expensive, and I thought Hot Wheels were getting up there!). You can get the Cars cars cheaply on eBay and sometimes on Craigslist. They're approx. $3.50 at Wal-Mart, Target, and Toys R Us (about $9 with the launcher). This directed his attention to Cars from the television set to real-life playing. I also bought him a Buzz Lightyear toy, and a Woody doll.     We also pretend play with his Cars pit crew costume from Halloween, and his Buzz costume. We use paper grocery bags to make "houses/buildings" like in the beginning of Toy Story, and we also use the bags for making make-shift costumes. You'd be surprised how well you can recreate a Buzz Lightyear, or even a Mater.     He now only watches Cars about once a week, and the same with Toy Story. He is a LOT more active, and is still obsessed with the things he loves - Cars and Buzz! He rarely watched the TV anymore because he is pretending things with the characters.     I also buy things like TIgger Tails pasta, Cars Pasta, etc. and let him "help me" cook dinner while incorporating the characters into the food. He loves it! It took my husband a few "Cars pasta" meals to get "into it" but our son loves it! And he is actually eating healthy things again, too.     Just know that it is completely normal for your son to be obsessed with something like Cars and/or Toy Story. I swear by getting the character toys. Another thing your son might like is a ViewMaster. You can buy Cars reels and Toy Story reels for it as well. I have cut out bedtime-tv by putting the character books in his bed along with other bedtime books like Goodnight Moon, Llamas in Pajamas, and Where Oh Where is Huggle Buggle Bear?. We read one character book, and then 1-2, sometimes 3 bedtime books.     Good luck with your son, and I wish you all the best! You seem like you have it under control already, I just wanted to tell you what worked for us.|`|vwuMTm7Saa	I think the obsession is normal because kids find things that they love and attach to them, however, no amount of television is "good" for your child before age 3...not even baby Einstein, sorry!  But maybe 2 or 3 times a week won't hurt them|`|44OH7Si6aa	It's normal for him to watch the same show or movie over and over. Kids love repetition, they like to be read the same book over and over again, play the same game, etc.  Congrats on cutting it down to 20 mins right before bed, many toddlers watch way more tv than that and it's an appropriate movie for a kid. He'll get tired of it eventually and want to see something else.|`|PFO1jxZGaa	My 3 and 5 year olds are obsessed with things too. Not for too long periods of time but for like a week or so and then they move on to a different show.   They dont watch a lot of movies but they do watch a lot of tv, but only the 'educational' shows like shows on noggin and nick jur. Like blues clues, dora, wonderpets etc. They learn counting, and shapes and colors and manners etc from them so I dont feel too bad that they watch as much as they do. Maybe you can try some of those. they are actually really entertaining so I'm sure he would like them.   My 3 year old also had speech delay, maybe because he watched so much tv or maybe because he was 9 mos when I got pregnant with number three and just lost all interest in anything but laying on the couch so I didnt exactly nurture his mind those months :)   Hes doing good now, partly because of speech therapy, partly because I spend more time with him but also because I switched the movies to shows with educational stuff and he really does learn a lot.   You can still let him watch the movie he likes but introduce other stuff too and also of course spend time with him teaching him yourself|`|iyL6dyMyaa	My son is the same way with his Nick Jr. DVD's.  Just let him watch Toy Story, but eventually put in other shows that you think he may like.  He may not like them at first but he will eventually after about a thousand times of watching Toy Story get into the movie that he didn't like at first.  That's how my son was.  He loved Dora and Backyardigans, and Veggie Tales.  Then he got sick of all of them and Now it's Wonder Pets, Max and Ruby and I've been having Word World for several months, but he is just now getting into that. This is probably the reason why my son's speech is delayed as well.|`|3qGdN6xMaa	Monomania and obsession is somewhat normal around that age.  It may be possible for you to intervene an distract him with something else and try and get him interested in something else, but Toy Story seems like a fairly harmless obsession.    What is more troublesome is when driving age teens become obsessed with Fast and Furious and want to do all sorts of car modifications, when they are already expensive to insure and I might wish when my kids were young like yours I had worked toward more environmentally aware obsessions.    When I was young, I was obsessed with hiking and hunting with my BB gun.  Daisy Red Ryder (no, you'll shoot your eye out!).  And riding bikes and skateboards all over town without a helmet.  Now our kids suffer much safer obsessions that mostly involve sitting in a chair watching TV and playing video and computer, and getting fat little butts prematurely doomed toward heart disease.    Anyway, I'd say do whatever you can to stimulate more physical activity and less passive mini-couch potato activity.

vue9NOhYaa	You could be counting differently.  If YOU are counting from conception, and the doctor is counting from the first day of your last menstrual period, then you are in complete agreement. (Pregnancy is dated from the LMP .. so you're 2 weeks along before you even conceive.)|`|J4W68owgaa	You could be measuring large, your baby could be big, or your dates could simply be off.     Have you had an ultrasound? They will measure your babies growth during the ultrasound and that's the most reliable indicator of how far along you are. Believe me sweetie, once you get to the 35-36 week mark, you'll be glad your doc thinks your farther along than you think ;)    Good luck and don't stress about it.

AA12254559	LOL!!!! Sorry, but you are just starting into the getting big phase. You will get bigger. A lot of women are in maternity clothes by this point, so it's nothing to be upset about. If this is your first baby, you will probably get bigger slowly. If it isn't your first, you will get bigger faster. With my first, I didn't need maternity clothes until almost 20 weeks. With my second, it was around 12 weeks. With this one (due in aug), I was in them the week after I found out I was expecting.     Every women is different, and will show different at different stages. I'm short, so the baby has nowhere to go but out. On some women, their torsos are shorter then others, so they show more out front. Some women are big all the way around, some you can't tell they are pregnant if they are facing away from you. It all just depends on your body. It isn't anything that's "wrong" with you, just the way you are going to carry.     You may just think you are big because you aren't used to seeing your belly in such a new fashion. But don't worry!! It's a normal part of pregnancy!! Just be happy with your belly, it means that your baby is growing and that your body is doing what it's supposed to do. Also, because you "show" the way you are, more people will know you are pregnant and not just getting fat. AHHH.. the benefits of showing soon!!! Good luck to you!! Don't worry!! Just know your belly is growing for a very good cause!!|`|430e91db100ad72479d62a786f902924aa	Yea, you've got more than 20 weeks to go...you're gonna get bigger.|`|AA11610212	i know i have went through phases of weight gain    i gained like 3 lbs one month then 10 the next then back down to 4 or 5, so dont worry i'm sure as long as you dont go crazy on the eating and get a little activitiy daily you will be fine.    i'm now 32 weeks and have gained 28 lbs, not too bad|`|AA10171313	everybody is different u'll just have to wait and see good luck!|`|0776bfe763db5814f6d3ea868b0d2560aa	You might have gestational diabetes.  Your doctor will probably check you for it around 20 wks.  If he/she doesn't meantion being checked, make sure you are.  G.D. causes your baby to grow rather large.  If you have it, your doc will probably put you on a stricter diet.  It isn't abnormal to have this at all, it's just a common complication of pregnancy.  Other than that, I don't think it is that uncommon to be in maternity clothes by then.  Especially if you were small to start with.|`|17cd02c243ad95cd0a7ac5eee0305905aa	Could just be the position your baby is in or you could be having a big baby.

It's hard to say if it's normal but usually woman are in maternity clothes around when you are and they just keep getting bigger.  You may hit a plateau at some point but there is no telling.  Also, expect to grow more after you hit 30wks.    I am almost 36wks and nothing fits anymore which is a complete 360 because a few wks ago everything had room!    Congrats and try not to stress about it - you are growing a beautiful baby and it takes lots of room to do that!!!|`|e9d8975329841b1d5422afa4f70afe94aa	It happens. It did with me, and yes darling, you will get bigger. The baby is not done growing yet. Be patient.|`|GEtxG7ksaa	Yes, you will continue to get bigger. Welcome to a whole new world! With my first child it was really hard because my body had never stretched like that before. I would buy some lotion and Vitamin E and rub it on your tummy really good every night. It won't prevent stretch marks (nothing does, no matter how much they say it does!), but it will help to ease the itching that comes along with stretching. It works great on your breast, too. If they haven't grown any yet, they will!|`|xZjYdHBOaa	Watch out or you'll explode!! J/K, Don't worry, But you probably will get bigger. That's just what your body does.

Best of luck !!!!!!!|`|AA10085211	somebody likes you...tell on him and get him in troble.|`|57a199e25d67f2bd3d376d8d06e48e7baa	yes he likes you. Just don't throw it in his face when he keeps bothering you. If he starts annoying you more than usual, then start pranking him back. If someday you guys are together with a group of friends, and a friend of yours knows that you wouldn't mind going out with him, tell her/him to play Dare and dare you guys to kiss or something. That usually works with me....lol|`|Ay9NuCWzaa	Maybe he does like you but boys have a weird way of showing it.

Boys are hard to read.|`|3165cdcf4a7c435db9b094cff3e96220aa	Yes seems like he likes you to me ,Why would he be doing this for no reason in middle school?, There is obvious a connection there.|`|P1HOop6Raa	he defiantly likes you|`|f78e209f3f6fb66c63dc42cbc02651beaa	He wouldn't be paying so much attention to you and teasing you if he wasn't interested in you.

Yes, he likes you girlie!|`|qQcw2O4Oaa	It sounds to me that either he is a bully or really does like you. But you should confront about all the stuff he does to you and tell him to stop (if it bothers you).|`|LwgNWGZuaa	he likes you i had a guy like that when i was in middle school and now hes still in my life hes my future husband :D|`|430e91db100ad72479d62a786f902924aa	He likes you...boys are stupid like that.

They understand people make decisions that others won't be happy with.  Just be honest about what your plans are regarding the baby.  If they didn't mind you moving in together, this shouldn't be that much of a shock to them.  I'm mom to 3.|`|ZA5FJg1Jaa	You need to tell them and quickly....the longer you wait the harder that it will be for you and for them....They deserve to know the truth about you, and since you live together and are not married then I am sure that they know that you are having sex....they should not be shocked.   Being pregnant is very wonderful time and they will be upset if you dont let them share this experience with you.  Pregnancy can also be difficult and believe me there will be times when you want your mommy.    Good luck and enjoy.

Everyone told me to jump start labor, to walk around.  When I did, it did start some contractions, but didn't put me into labor.  That might work for you, though.  According to my doctor, when I told him I was having pressure, similar to what you are having, he said that means the baby is moving down and getting ready.  I would say it shouldn't be too teribly long before you went into labor. People also say to eat spicy food, but that didn't work either.|`|942a708204289df3b7927c55a8ecd741aa	it is your begining signs of labor...but it can still be a little while...when pain starts radiating to your back, then you know your in labor...beleive me, you can't accidently mistake the back pain...|`|430e91db100ad72479d62a786f902924aa	Walk up and down some stairs or walk around in general.

e63052db9e9b25c99b677c003ed25e28aa	This is why people use a thing called birth control.  Anytime you are engaging in unprotected sexual activity there is always a possibility of getting pregnant.  If you insist on fooling around without using a condom then your girlfriend needs to be on the pill.  If you don't use protection you need to be ready to deal with the consequences of your actions...it's called acting responsibly.  Hopefully this scare will teach you to be more careful in the future.|`|842e7245d92a9eaaf5883492a9c11008aa	it's always a chance but i doubt it. just watch for signs and if she does start showing signs then get her tested. if you didn't get her pregnant and don't want to then use condoms or some other type of birth control with her.|`|9aaeeeba7ae46203c22fcb6f62349934aa	No she's not pregnant.|`|gLQVJVE8aa	she's not pregnant you need to do more than that to get her pregnant, before assuming she's ever pregnant you should watch for signs|`|fJeI3bOwaa	a womens cycle is about 10 - 14 days before next period to get pregnant.

e63052db9e9b25c99b677c003ed25e28aa	First Response makes a home pregnancy test which you can take as early as 4 days before you expect the start of your period.  The test (as most all HP tests) measures levels of hCG hormone in your urine.  The tests get more accurate the longer you wait to take the test as the hCG in your system gets stronger and more easily detected.  According to the First Response info I have here, this brand of test detected hCG in 69% of pregnant women 4 days before, 83% 3 days before, 93% 2 days before and 93% 1 day before expected periods.  These statistics are for women who actually were pregnant - which means it is easier to get a false negative the earlier you test.  Also, your hormone levels may be lower or higher, making the test less effective.  The most accurate test is a blood test performed by your doctor or at a clinic.|`|fee1739a266f057a19e6238acaf69cbaaa	i took my pregnancy test well in the hospital i fell off the ladder nice way to find out im pregnant  well i had the same symptoms as you .. i get really hungry and im always sleeping! i feel like if i havent slept in days!!|`|AA11885437	It different for different people.

e63052db9e9b25c99b677c003ed25e28aa	Don't worry so much.  You really would have known if there was something to worry about...If your ultrasound was done by a technician in the radiology dept (as mine was), the actual radiologist would have come in if there was anything to be concerned about.  You would have been given reason to feel scared at that time and/or you would have heard from your OB by now.  They check EVERYTHING possible during the ultrasound, especially spinal development.  Yes, it's normal to worry but it sounds like you have nothing to worry about.  Just relax and take care!|`|2QhHsJn4aa	If there had been anything wrong then they would have let you know there and then.  The fact that they didn't say anything when you were suggests that everything is perfect.    Stop worrying and start enjoying your pregnancy!!|`|ea1f92bded785c6af899926c9ca477c8aa	With an ultra sound, doctors check the length and circumference of bones, spine and head. They can tell if anything looks abnormal and if so, will send you to another specialist to have a second ultra sound to check the baby more completely. You can also at that time request an amniocenteses, which consists of taking a needle and inserting it into your belly button, then taking a bit of fluid from your womb to analyze. They can then tell if the baby has down syndrome. I was very anxious myself with all my pregnancies-all seven of them. I guess that is what being a Mommy is all about. Just listen to your body. if you feel unwarranted pain, go to your doctor. Listen to him after your check-up. He will check your baby  and your body to see that he is safe and sound. Then, tell yourself that you can rest easy.|`|1fe7548a38e463d0ef61dedc26dcf9c4aa	They would have told you if there was a problem.  They wouldn't just do the u/s, find something and let you go on with a normal pregnancy like nothing happened, only for you to be suprised at birth.  The purpose of the u/s is to detect problems and deal with them before birth.  If there was a problem, you would know it.    Good luck!|`|f10ebdaf0188ca166507aae70c628222aa	if they saw anything they would have told you so, cool it, thank god there was no such thing as ultrasound when i was pregnant, the kid came out and whatever it was, you had it.|`|CNZ9dsZdaa	yes i was really worried because i was wondering if i was gonna have an healthy baby. but lucky iam. a healthy babygurl.

Se il preservativo viene usato correttamente offre un livello di protezione molto alto, per deve essere utilizzato dall'inizio alla fine del rapporto, preliminari compresi se questi comportano lo strusciarsi degli organi sessuali. Se hai rapporti con partner diversi  un obbligo verso te stessa e verso di loro. Se hai un compagno stabile secondo me niente di meglio della pillola. Assumila regolarmente, con puntualit, evita l'iterazione di farmaci e se li devi assumere e vuoi essere tranquilla consulta anche semplicemente il tuo medico di base.

In questi casi cercare di calmarsi e di riflettere sul fatto che non  oggettivamente possibile che tu sia incinta non sosrtisce alcun effetto in quanto la fobia  irrazionale.    Se questa paura ti condiziona effettivamente molto ti consiglierei di rivolgerti ad un/a psicologo/a, anche presso un consultorio, in modo che tu possa comprendere da dove origina questo tuo disagio ed eventualmente concordare con lo specialista una terapia breve. Tieni conto che quando si instaura una fobia o un'ossessione su qualche cosa il nostro corpo pu reagire in modo strano (molte donne che attraversano momenti di malessere psicologico possono soffrire di amenorrea temporanea - e per te non sarebbe certo un aiuto).     In bocca al lupo!

Tg6drPIHaa	Sou estudante de tcnico em enfermagem e fiz um trabalho a respeito disso. Vou te passar todas as informa??es que eu tive:    Motivos que causaram o descolamento:    Fatores Traumticos: Cord?o umbilical curto, press?o alta, acidentes de carro    Fatores n?o traumticos: Idade, cigarro, lcool, drogas.    - A nica coisa que deve ser feita  repouso mesmo.  - Caso perceba qualquer sinal de sangramento ou dor, procure seu mdico imediatamente.  - Voc deve realizar exames de pr-natal com mais frequencia do que outras grvidas, para ver se t tudo bem.    N?o se espante, com a devida aten??o e cuidado, sua gesta??o vai ser boa.    Se cuide e fique atenta.    Boa sorte

O mdico acredita que foi devido a um pulo que eu dei quando trocava uma lampada e n?o sabia que estava grvida.  Eu me senti tonta e ao invs de descer da escadinha eu pulei direto com os ps no ch?o com um forte impacto.  Enfim, tendo isso,  necessrio cuidados especiais, mas nada de panico!  Fa?a seu repouso e fique antenada se em algum momento sentir perda de lquido. Apenas isso.  No meu caso, o descolamento proporcionou o nascimento prematuro, minha baby nasceu de pouco mais de 7 meses e perfeita.  Fiz cesareana porque minha placenta n?o estava muito boa para o bebe grande.  Os mdicos pedem ecografias mensais, por elas eles sabem se a placenta est em ordem.  Ent?o n?o se aflija.  Converse com o beb.  No mximo ele ou ela poder?o nascer antes do prazo.

De qualquer forma deve fazer repouso e ZERO de rela??es sexuais.    De resto,  aguardar mesmo a evolu??o da gravidez.    De repente nada mais acontece e a gravidez vai muito bem at ao termo.    S o evoluir da gravidez  que vai dizer o que poder ocorrer.    Espero que tudo corra bem.    Boa sorte.

Muitas vezes vemos uma barriguinha aparentemente pequena, mas aps o parto tm-se um grande beb e vice-versa.  Claro que existem medi??es precisas ou prximas da realidade.    Na fase de gravidez, sim, a barriga pode tomar forma e volume diferenciados, claro, n?o muito diferentes do era observado.  Dependendo do movimento do beb, pode estar mais dura ou n?o, mais apontada para um lado ou para o outro.    A preocupa??o maior  com o movimento do beb, mas ele ora dorme, ora se espregui?a etc... E nem todos os bebs se comportam da mesma forma, mas h uma mdia...    Se tiver qualquer dvida, n?o fique assim, procure logo seu mdico(a) que acompanha sua gravidez, um (a) ginecologista/obstreta.

b5YwGgRpaa	Na realidade as duas maternidades s?o "tops" e dos mesmos administradores e donos.  Eu tive meu filho no Santa Joana e n?o tenho absolutamente nada para me arrepender o tratamento  timo, as enfermeiras s?o super atenciosas, eu adorei! Meu filho est com um ano.  A maioria das pessoas que conhe?o e tiveram seus bebes l tb dizem a mesma coisa. Uma conhecida minha me disse que agora cada quarto tem um TV que filma o ber?o que esta o seu bebe no ber?ario 24hs ent?o qdo o seu bebe n?o estiver no quarto vc poder ficar observando-o no ber?ario.  A Pro Matre tb  uma excelente maternidade, minha prima teve o bebe dela l em agosto, ela gostou a unica coisa que ela ficou um pouco aborrecida  que apos o parto o bebe demora de 6 a 8 horas para ser liberado e ir para o quarto.  As duas maternidades seguem a mesma linha, a Pro Matre tem um pouco mais de "frescurinha".  Converse com o seu medico e ele poder dizer qual maternidade prefere. O meu medico prefere o Santa Joana pq ja tem uma equipe l por mais de 30 anos.

fe35f8ef5680eaad17889a4ff0a6a2f5aa	Some toddlers go through that "it's my poop, i'll do what i want with it" phase.  You can try, the next time he has a BM, take his dirty diaper or pull up to the toilet and put the poop in it.  To show him where his poop belongs.  And then just try to get him on the potty with in half hour to an hour after eating... supposedly that's when a BM is most likely to happen.      If all else fails... lay down the law.  Tell him that his poop isn't a toy, and doesn't go on the walls.  Then punish him the next time he does it.  He'll get it eventually.     If all else fails... remember that he'll grow out of it one of these days!!!|`|PoK2uOS0aa	This is going to sound funny, but they say a lot of kids have trouble with this because they feel that the BM is a piece of them and that a piece of them is being flushed down the toilet.  I haven't gotten to this stage of potty training yet, but this is what my sister did with both my niece and nephew to get past this stage fear.  When they were wearing their diaper and had a BM my sister would walk them to the toilet and shake the BM in the toilet and flush it, which showed my niece and nephew there was nothing to be afraid of because they were still standing next to my sister after the BM went down the drain.  Sounds crazy, I know, but I hope it helps.|`|6dNFSFY1aa	Make sure he is sleeping during nap times.  If he is not sleeping and not wanting to be in the crib, then this could be an expression of his wanting to be out of the crib.  At night, sleep him in an outfit that cannot be removed easily like bib overalls, onesies, or shorts.    When he is sleeping, keep a monitor nearby so you can hear when he awakens.  I think this has alot more to do with him being angry rather than his stage of potty training.    For potty training, my son did really well using the Potty Stool.  He was excited to use what Mommy and Daddy use and he had no fear or difficulty getting right to the toilet on his own.  It really reduces the stress in our house.    Hang in there!  I am sure this is just a phase.|`|p22r3miqaa	thank god i'm not the only one.  my 2 year old daughter does the same thing.  and i am sick of cleaning up poop.  i don't really know what to tell you.  but thanks for asking the question!  the only advice i can give you is to continuously ask him if he has to go and keep a good eye on him so he doesn't smear it everywhere.|`|Ei5Ls6MPaa	I would personally try time-out and taking away a favorite toy for the mis-behavior. Regardless, if you are potty training or not you want to make sure he understands what is acceptable behavior and not. Clearly, smearing poop on the walls is not. =) He will understand then come around to pooping in the potty. He sounds very intelligent and will get the hang of what you mean soon enough.|`|AA10457170	he's angry about something?He wants something?He wants more attention?|`|1udoiFIDaa	I would just tell your son that when he goes poop he needs to go in the potty, and not wipe it on the walls. If he wants to go in the diaper when he goes poop then that's fine but he needs to keep it in his pants till you can clean it up. That is what I have been doing with my son, and he's been telling me when he's gone poopy or when he needs to go, so i can put him on the potty.

Y nunca debes darle a un bebe te de manzanilla ni ninguna otra infusion ya que son toxicas para ellos, no hagas cosas de las cuales despues terminan con dolores de panza, y lo unico que hacen despues es decir estan empachados!!!  Otra tonteria mas, que se inventa, es todo psicologico.  Porque creen en esas cosas, que le es mas facil o que?

Lo q si s q es muy bueno es la lavanda y manzanilla en el agua, eso si tiene efectos sedantes y los bebes duermen como angelitos.  Se venden en las farmacias unos ba?os liquidos con esencias q quedan muy lindas en la piel del bb cuando lo secas.  salu2.-|`|ef11aea9ad41cbfd669f058bacdc64ebaa	Es la primera ves que escucho que la lechuga tiene efectos sedativos.  S que la lavanda y la manzanilla y el tilo son sedativos.    S que a los bebs no se les debe dar  infusiones.    Pero parece que lo tuyo es ba?arlo en una infusin sedativa.    Te sugiero, que hagas lo siguiente: Tomate vos, un t sedativo, cambia le los pa?ales, prepara le  la mama de la madre,  un buen bibern, baj las luces, propicia el silencio, y a descansar....vos y el bebe.    La leche de la madre,  la leche sustituta ya tienen propiedades sedativas para los bebes, por eso son lactantes. Toman Leche.    Los bebes son personas, parecidas entre s pero no iguales.    Hay personas que un ba?o las seda y por eso prefieren ba?arse de noche y acostarse a dormir tranquilas.    Otras personas, en este caso el bebe, puede ser que el ba?o lo llene de energa y lo estimule, por eso se despierta mas an, s lo ba?as de noche.    S tu bebe est hiper activo despus del ba?o, es conveniente que cambies el horario de la noche por el de la ma?ana.    Lo primero para conocer a tu bebe es observarlo, y no salir corriendo a buscar polvos mgicos, porque vas a perder muchsimo dinero.  Mucha suerte en tus observaciones.
d8cddd77a64ecf734a055d9f313b6248aa	for me clear blue digital worked.... I tested a few days before my period was due, and I got a positive.. With my first pregnancy I used an ept like a week after my missed period, and got a negative! (I was infact pregnant) I really do think that clear blue is worth the couple extra bucks. And I love that it is digital (no trying to figure out those stupid lines, or if they are dark enough ect..) Just a simple pregnant or not pregnant....Good Luck!|`|Vgf2fdChaa	first response|`|e63052db9e9b25c99b677c003ed25e28aa	I used First Response.  If you are testing earlier than your expected period be aware of 2 things.  First, make sure that the test you are buying can be used early (some still make you wait til your missed period, so read the box).  Second, be aware that even the so-called "early tests" are not as accurate the earlier you take them.  Every day makes a difference.  For example (if I remember correctly),  the First Response test was only 60-something percent accurate in detecting pregnany (in women who were actually pregnant) 4 days before their periods were due and it increased up to 90-something percent by 1 day before they were due.  If I were you (and I was!) I would buy a two pack.  Take one test as early as the test allows for and if it's negative, wait a few days and take the other one.  Don't be tempted to take more than one test in a day, tho - within one day your results won't change.  Good luck.|`|3bfd334b01c72eccb313bc33f8f639d9aa	The dollar store one works just fine.     The digital can be tricky, since it always has two lines if you are ovulating or have just ovulated. (I was fooled by that once!)    Buy dollar store tests, and test every day. It's not like they are expensive!|`|yWUHnskAaa	"first response"|`|P83BdyTNaa	Call me crazy, but the only pregnancy test I have ever gotten to turn positive is the EPT brand.  Also, I was able to use it like 5 or 6 days before my expected period.  I will never use another brand again....unless of course I'm hoping to not be pregnant.  :) Good luck!!!  I know the waiting can be HORRIBLE!!!
QkLrhgA4aa	Better late than never. Plus, if it was too late your OB would have told you and probably wouldn't have set it up. So, next Friday should be fine. In addition, the further along you are when you have it done, the more detail you can see.|`|AYkXU8n4aa	Your original plan is fine don't worry the longer you wait to get the 4d or 3d done the better pictures will be of your baby. Congrats|`|8ba6772411ce2fa9565b98ebe96d6a0aaa	i hear a lot that you cannot see as much if you are too far allong because the baby is all scrunched up in there and most likely has turned head down and such. good luck though and congrats|`|e63052db9e9b25c99b677c003ed25e28aa	you should call and ask the 4d ultraound office what they think...when i went at 29 weeks, they told me the ideal time was between 28 and 32 weeks (otherwise baby can be too big to get a good picture due to less room to move around).  if i were you, i'd reschedule as soon as possible.  congrats and good luck!|`|1e671b0731e329f9cce89d55a1be07beaa	you will probably end up with some really good pics by now. good luck, I wish I could have done that!!
4d5481f08433b8e9d4468ca13224305baa	Probably not.  Take another test and/or bet to your GYN for confirmation.  Please don't ask us here; we have no way of telling.|`|2413022aea1d85c414ea628ae4906818aa	Give it another week and if it still doesn't show up, take another test or go see the gyno, they can do a blood test to determine if you are or not, a blood test shows it earlier than a pee test.|`|AA11787590	Being that you had sex on the day you were supposed to start i dont think your pregnant from that. But since you are still late i would go into your dr on monday and have them do a blood test. That is the most reliable form of testing to tell weather you are pregnant or not. many factors could lead to no period such as stress, rapid weight loss or gain, illness, drugs (certain tranquilizers) may have disrupted cycle. good luck.|`|e63052db9e9b25c99b677c003ed25e28aa	In the average woman's cycle, ovulation occurs at the midway point between the start of each period - the start of your period would count as day 1 and ovulation would happen around day 14 if your cycle is 28 days.  The presence of sperm on or around your ovulation time (plus or minus a few days) is necessary for you to become pregnant.  It sounds like you had sex on day 28 of your previous cycle or day 1 of the next.  If you did not have sex any other time between the start of your last period and seven days ago, it is very unlikely you are pregnant.  If you still do not get your period, take another test in a day or two.  If the test is still negative (or even if it is positive), make an appointment with your OB/GYN.  There could be any number of medical reasons for not getting your period besides pregnancy.|`|svtHMGiDaa	Dear friend,   You may be pregnant. and you will get pregnant or a disease like aids if you continue to be alone with someone you are not married to.  Please contact a pregnancy resource center through optionline on the net, or call 1800 a family.  Take good care  of yourself and your baby if you are pregnant.  -Sincerly Runner.
tiCB7As2aa	Spesso mia figlia torna da scuola con i vestitini con segni di colori o altro e penso che mi piacerebbe di pi se potesse indossare il grembiulino, ma qui non sanno neanche cos'.  Nell' ultima scuola doveva andare vestita da maschietto polo, senza disegni, che poteva essere blu scuro, arancione o bianca e i pantaloni, lunghi o corti (che coprivano il ginocchio) blu scuro o marrone.  Non mi piaceva molto che andasse vestita da maschietto, ma secondo loro e' una forma di proteggere le bambine, vestite cosi dovrebbero attirare meno l' attenzione di "malintenzionati, se e' cosi... va be'.  In quest' ultima scuola non possono indossare orecchini, braccialetti o simili (permesso solo un orologio da polso).  Uniche scarpe permesse: da tennis o simili.  Lo zainetto deve essere trasparente in modo da far vedere il contenuto.    Per quanto riguarda il materiale didattico tutti l' hanno uguale (all' inizio dell' anno la maestra da un elencodelle cose da comprare, in questa maniera tutti hanno lo stesso, e si lasciano a scuola).|`|bTfY0Z1zaa	Si,perch una divisa deve pur esserci fino ad una certa et.. in America,in altre parti del mondo medie,e superiori le frequentano con la divisa scolastica:gonna,camicia e cravatta per le donne.. sarebbe bellissimo anke in italia.|`|6pLAOlGwaa	secondo me si... perch siamo tutti uguali senza nessuna distinzione non si vede il pi ricco e il pi povero... qndo andavo a scuola c' stato uno stupido litigio per una maglietta firmata e  stato reso obbligatorio... risultato tutti sullo stesso piano|`|8e40d45d7004f69e8e534197eebcf9bbaa	io sono contraria! ai bambini non serve la divisa!!!!! (anke se sono tenerissimi!)|`|sNrnnwMAaa	il grembiulino alle elementari proprio no,una divisa modello inglese costa,lo s che fa rabbia mandare il proprio figlio vestito con una tuta da 10 presa al mercato e vedere il suo compagno con vestiti firmati,ma sino alla terza elementare i bambini non ci fanno caso ma solo noi.   Non possiamo vestirli uguali per evitare gli impatti economici perch se non  il vestito, la cartella o l'astuccio.|`|8ba5ae72fd6c5d4d38450983cbf96801aa	credo che il grembiule sia giusto solo xk cosi i bambini sono tutti uguali.    Mi ricordo k in 5 elem da me hanno tolto il grembiule e le differenze si notavano...    Io avevo tutte robe della barbie etc (allora andava di moda cosi) mentre una bambina che aveva una famiglia un po disastrata aveva magliette rovinate e i bambini la prendevano in giro.    Vi sta dicendo i ai grembiuli una che li ha odiati per tutto il periodo delle elementari!!    Ciao a tutti...|`|fzlmZlNNaa	ma, la domanda reale  a cosa serve il grembiulino? non di certo a non sporcare il vestito, sarebbe l'ultimo dei problemi, il problema non  nemmeno di far vedere che i bambini sono tutti uguali, perch tanto i bambini, vengono lo stesso derisi, per la grossezza, colore dei capelli, occhi, altezza, colore della pelle, lingua e tutti i difetti inimmaginabili...  il grembiule  solo un modo di far "apparire" i bambini "in modo similare" ma non  cos... nessuno  uguale ad un altro, ma nemmeno diverso ;)|`|9c8824a8ab1a5e5e18bab88daccecb8caa	Si|`|HkNVDXMLaa	sapete, anche io, alle elementari per 3 anni ho do vuto metterlo.  voi nn sapete che cosa si prova a starci dentro.  ti senti imbarazzatissima!  almeno adesso nn lo metto...|`|uSfVYTahaa	Assolutamente favorevole: tra i bambini non devono esserci distinzioni di "classe sociale", bambini che arrivano firmati dalla testa ai piedi....  Secondariamente, meno rilevante, i grembiulini rendono pi libero il bimbo nei giochi e nelle attivit scolastiche... se il grembiule si sporca, si lava e non si rovina!|`|O34g0Yxuaa	Certo che si, anzi, sarebbe meglio se facessero anche come faceva il maestro di mio fratello (20 anni fa):  Comprava quaderni e materiale vario in modo che i bambini avessero le stesse cose ed in pi dovevano essere gestite da loro. Con questo insegnava loro il rispetto per le cose e non creava invidie a chi non si poteva permettere materiale firmato|`|7b76013c6b5a9614b4cef05c044d2b96aa	concordo pienamente con Dome!!!!! visti poi i bambini delle elementari di adesso!!!!!!|`|wK3GHkbjaa	Favorevole! A scuola non si va per fare sfilate di moda!|`|E51HMVViaa	favorevolissima, io lo adoravo!  Che bello poter fare tutto senza il pensiero di sporcare i vestiti... stato l'unico periodo della mia vita in cui non ci sia stato da preoccuparsi per le cose da indossare, peccato sia durato tanto poco!!!|`|GWpkvaTPaa	Grembiule alle elementari e divisa dalle medie in avanti,  molto pi semplice che imporre regole di abbigliamento e annulla le differenze fra i bambini ricchi e griffati e quelli meno ricchi vestiti ai grandi magazzini.

Tutto andava a cazzo, lacrime, delusioni; mi sentivo una bimba piccola, una fott.utissima bimba piccola che piangeva x qualsiasi cosa.   Mi sentivo sola, anche se avevo tanti amici e due genitori che mi amano, mi sentivo persa in un oceano, ero innamorata ma non riuscivo a dirlo, avevo tre ragazzi che mi venivano dietro ma io non ero innamorata di nessuno dei tre, passavo pomeriggi interi sul letto, con la musica a palla, da sola, a piangere, a lasciare che il tempo fottutis.simamente scorresse e mi lasciasse dietro un ricordo brutto, che per si potesse cancellare facilmente. Quel periodo s, fu il pi brutto della mia vita, fino ad adesso. Pensai di buttarmi dal balcone ed esser dimenticata da tutti per quella che non sono mai stata, ma ho 13 anni, cazzo, 13 anni non si posso confrontare a una vita intera, alle amicizie, alle gioie, alle emozioni che ho provato, tornai indietro, impaurita da questo mondo, l'adolescenza...ah, l'adolescenza, quante ne combina. Pian piano sono uscita, con l'aiuto di una mia amica, la mia migliore amica, che anche se a 1000 km da me in un'altra realt, un'amica che non vedevo da 5 mesi, trasferitasi in Sicilia dalla SUA roma, mi aiut a superare tutto quel periodo, ora sono qui con una voglia di vivere pazzesca.

tjSHELSlaa	Amiga, as chances de vc ter engravidado sao ENORMES. Voce teve rela?ao no dia 05  e 06, seus dias mais ferteis. Pode acontecer que tenha ovulado dia 08, mesmo assim, o espermatozoide sobrevive ate 72 horas. Aguarde o dia 19/02 e fa?a o teste dia 20 se atrasar e tiver sintomas de gravidez. Eu tbem menstruei dia 23/01 e tive rela?oes dia 07 e 08/02, meu ciclo  de 30 dias. To na expectativa. Boa sorte pra nos.|`|iEPcnNuraa	Esse tambm  meu problema eu n?o sei quando estou ovulando mas sinto essa dorzinha. Para ns que estamos tentando realmente  fica dificil amiga espero muito saber isso tambm ....|`|8CJv96wJaa	Olhe encontrei esse jeito simplez de saber o periodo fertil,espero te ajudar       ? ? ? ? ?Como calcular o perodo frtil ? ? ? ? ?    * Verifique a dura??o dos seus seis ltimos ciclos menstruais, determine o mais longo e o mais curto.  Calcule quando ocorrem os dias frteis, seguindo as instru??es a seguir:    Do nmero total de dias no seu ciclo mais curto, subtraia 18. isto identifica o primeiro dia frtil do seu ciclo.   Do nmero total de dias no seu ciclo mais longo, subtraia 11. isto identifica o ltimo dia frtil do seu ciclo.    Exemplo: Ciclo mais curto: 26 dias menos 18 dias = 8 dias  Ciclo mais longo: 30 dias menos 11 dias = 19 dias    Seu perodo frtil  calculado como come?ando no oitavo dia do ciclo e terminando no dcimo nono dia do seu ciclo (12 dias de abstinncia s?o necessrios para evitar a gravidez).    Vantagens: Pode ser usado para evitar ou alcan?ar uma gravidez; n?o apresenta efeitos colaterais fsicos; grtis; aumenta o conhecimento da mulher sobre o seu sistema reprodutivo; retorno imediato da fertilidade.    Desvantagens: Alta incidncia de falha; difcil para algumas mulheres detectar o perodo frtil; n?o protege contra DST/AIDS.|`|BagCMECEaa	Rose, vc n?o deve ter ovulado todos esses dias, na verdade o corpo vai se preparando para ovular e o pico da ovula??o  qdo sai a tal clarinha de ovo... esse foi o dia da sua ovula??o!!    Existe sim ovula??o tardia e pode ter acontecido com vc, mas acho dificil j que vc relatou ter visto a secre??o clara de ovo no dia 05. E mesmo que a ovula?ao tenha sido no dia 7 e 9 vc pode engravidar, uma vez que os espermatozides ficam vivos dentro do corpo da mulher at 72 horas depois da rela??o!    Boa sorte!!|`|BsHLPfyCaa	 dificil distinguir oque  essa dor. Ela pode ser tando da ovula??o como a menstrua??o que pode est por vir...  Tive isso 3 ciclos seguidos e era s a monstra chegando...   Pode ser amiga no seu caso a ovula??o mesmo...  O melhor  esperar at dia 20/02 e ver se a menstrua??o vai vir e se n?o vir fa?a o Beta HCG...  Sorte pra vc.|`|k1kJodFwaa	a ovula?ao nao ocorre nesses dias todos...a ovula?ao ocorre apenas num dia, os outros srao dias ferteis em que esse ovo estar mais "disponivel" para ser fecundado. se voce tem um ciclo regular entao vai ovular exactamente 14 dias apos o 1o dia da  ultima menstrua?ao, penso que isso de ovula?ao precoce nao existe. passe a utilizar sempre camisinha!!/|`|AA11808736	Querida, com certeza vc n?o ovulou todos esses dias.  que muitas vezes os sintomas, confundem a gente! O melhor mesmo  vc fazer um acompanhamento da sua temperatura...  medindo a temperatura corporal basal (TCB) ou usando um kit para previs?o de ovula??o para medir os nveis de Horm?nio Luteinizante na urina.A  certeza!!!!!  Veja mais informa??es:  http://www.fertilidadeonline.com.br/lata...
AA11808736	Querida se sua menstrua??o desceu, j indica que vc n?o est grvida!  Os seios inchados e os enjoos tambm s?o sintomas da  menstrua??o ou TPM. Muitas mulheres sentem estes sintomas e os confundem com os sintomas de gravidez, j que s?o parecidos. A dica  n?o se prender aos sintomas e sim ao que o seu corpo indica. O sangramento  um sinal claro de que n?o ocorreu a  concep??o!  Bjs!|`|eff138f904eb0438c5ce8434a821fe0faa	Pode acontecer sim...  Menstruar n?o quer dizer necessariamente q n?o esteje grvida...

Beij?o^^|`|AA11808736	As caracteristicas que apontam a gravidez , primeiro seria a ausencia da menstrua??o, seguido de pequenas clicas na regi?o do baixo ventre, dor nos seios, vontade de fazer xixi intensa, saliva??o intensa e gosto amargo na boca, etc... N?o h como sentir o beb ainda pois no incio da gesta??o o embri?o  menor que um gr?o de arroz!  Se sua menstrua??o desceu, esta hiptese de gravidez est descartada!

ztviuqLyaa	S, se puede, todo depende de la duracin de tu ciclo, sumado a que los espermatozoides viven en el cuerpo de la mujer hasta 3 das  ms. Con lo cual podra darse un embarazo.  No hagas caso de los das que te indican ac, todos los ciclos no son iguales, si tu ciclo dura por ejemplo 32 das, los das frtiles tuyos no van a ser iguales a los de otras chicas. Entonces no es regla lo del da 10 no aplica a todas!!!|`|cd850d1011d787fd39274d3100926b0daa	no creo.

Ent?o os membros tendem a formigar, ficar gelados algumas vezes e at sentir caimbras.  Use meia elstica para ajudar na circula??o!  Beijos!|`|DanMeBszaa	Fale com os eu medico , ele e pode te orientar melhor|`|b1dc8c36f3535ce83ad8e1be06fb18ccaa	Muito comum na gravidez a circula??o ficar mais lenta, apesar de dentro do normal, tudo que voc sente deve contar ao seu mdico durante o pr natal, s ele vai avaliar se alguma coisa est fugindo do esperado, felicidades com seu baby!|`|ogESH1Saaa	pode ser alguma altera??o de circulacao    o melhor  conversar com o ginecologista|`|RAYkCqstaa	Como todos recomendaram anteriormente, n?o esque?a de contar isso ao seu mdico.  primeira impress?o de algum, que n?o fez medicina,  a circula??o sanginea, que na gravidez fica mais devagar, afinal o sangue tem que se concentrar bastante no tero.  Eu tive muitas caimbras e o que me ajudou muito foi manter os ps para cima e tomar muuuita gua de coco, comer banana pois o potssio neste alimentos auxilia na circula??o e evita caimbras e formigamento.  bijn|`|ymCsdfbiaa	Isso pode ser m circula??o sanguinea procure seu mdico logo pra resolver pois pode piorar...|`|GNHlHbA4aa	Oi Preta...     Olha, sempre eh bom pedir a orientacao de seu medico, mas eu tambem vez por outra sinto um formigamento nas maos e meus pes ficam dormentes... sei que minha pressao e minhas taxas estao todas normais, mas agora dia 2o de maio tenho consulta e vou confirmar com minha medica se eh normal...  Uma coisa boa eh colocar as pernas para cima, deita de costas e coloca as pernas para cima, se for problema de circulacao, isso ajudara...   Vai dar tudo certo... Boa sorte!! Beijos...|`|NON97grpaa	 a circula??o sangnea que na gravidez fica mais deficitria!

AA11808736	Calma querida, estes sintomas que vc descreve s?o os mesmos de uma TPM tbm. Muitas vezes os sintomas da gravidez s?o confundidos com os da menstrua??o que est por vir.

Preste atencao na intensidade dessa ansiedade porque a cabeca manda no corpo, entao quanto mais ansiosa fica, maior a possibilidade de se ter sintomas de uma gestacao sem estar gravida. Relaxe, procure fazer coisas que te deem prazer, procure uma valvula de escape porque tudo o que e demais sobra e viver assim no limite e muito perigoso. Essas coisas nao dependem da vontade da gente, pois o tempo da gente nao e o tempo de Deus. Espero ter ajudado, boa sorte!

AA11808736	Fique tranquila Luiza, isso s?o apenas gases.  Os sintomas da gravidez como enjoo, tonturas, muitas vezes s?o confundidos com os sintomas da TPM.  O fato de estar sentindo uma movimenta??o no abdome n?o significa que tenha um ser vivo dentro de vc. Nossas al?as intestinais se movem, conforme o transito intestinal e ainda produzimos gases.  N?o poderia ser um beb, pois as grvidas s sentem o beb  partir do quinto ms de gesta??o ( antes ele  minsculo).

nGafpEwoaa	Hubby needs to get well real soon.  I know that can't happen, but it's part of the problem you're having.  The house hold routine has been turned up side down with hubby being on sick leave.    It's not only going to effect you, but will also effect your son.  He's used to the same routine as you, when hubby was working.  Changes in routines is not easy on anyone.      You have nothing to feel guilty or horrible about.  You life/routine has been thrown through the hoop.  I don't know what condition your hubby is in, but is it possible for him to watch your son for a short time while you go somewhere by your self, even if it's for a cup of coffee, to get the break you need?   Would it be possible for you and your son to go somewhere together so the two of you can try to have a little fun together, even if it's for a walk together?  This could relieve some of the tension you're going through by being all together in the house for 24/7.    Maybe a friend or family member could stay with your hubby while you cut out for awhile.    When you loose your space everything becomes over whelming.  I've been there and back.  It's not easy at all, so no guilt or feeling horrible.    Try to keep the same routine you had before hubby's sick leave.  If he's laying on the sofa watching TV get the vac out if that's been your routine before all the changes.  Keep doing what you used to do.  Get back into your routine.  It just may bring back order into the house hold again.  Your private space may have to become your bedroom with no disturbances.  Put a sign on the door "DO NOT ENTER UNLESS ASKED."  Sometimes we have to get a little creative in order to survive.      With tension usually comes depression.  That's why it's important to get back your space, routine and sanity.  You son will be much happier for it.      This is all I can offer you, now that I've taken up enough of your time.   Some times we have to work around our obsticauls.  |`|9f178b78d1df3d5b00c072925dbeddc0aa	u can see a counsellor, if not effective can see psychiatrist and take pills,yes signs of depression, but pills are hard lot of them cause addiction   in the long run     :)|`|7QuuVx9naa	Hey there, relax and take a deep breath, you are not a horrible person!  I am sure that situation is stressful.  Your son is being whiney because he is not getting all of your attention (and I bet your husband is a little bit too?), which is totally normal.  I also know first hand how hard it is to have both a kid and a husband home at the same time and get anything done!  It is enough to make anyone frustrated, and then to top it off, you don't even get any down time where no-one  is watching you.  If I were you I would enlist in a baby sitter or a friends help to get an afternoon off!  A little time to myself always energizes me and allows me to come back and be both a better wife and mother. Good luck : )|`|AA11298562	Sounds like stress that may be turning into depression.  Remember, in order to take care of your boys, you need to take care of yourself.  How old is your son?  Can he possibly entertain himself for an hour while you relax?  If he's too young to be by himself, use naptime as an excuse to get some peace and quiet (don't be surprised if he screams when you put him down, that's normal.  ignore it and let him cry himself to sleep, it's good for him).  If he's old enough to take care of himself for a while and is still bugging you, lay down the law.  Tell him that he is a big boy and can solve some problems without whining to mommy.  Tell him he needs to play quietly for a while so you can take a break.  It might be hard at first, but be firm and follow through on discipline.  Now, on to hubby.  He's hurt, but you haven't mentioned how.  Is it possible HE can watch the kid for a while?  And how's he been acting?  Being injured and out of work can bring out the baby in a man, and he may be feeling depressed himself.  Is this something you can discuss with him?  Or is he a 'don't ask, don't tell' kind of guy?  If you can talk it over with him, you'll feel better for getting it off your chest, and may get some help from him.  It sounds like you ALL need a break.  Do you have insurance?  Find out if they'll cover someone to come in and help you, or if they'll spring for a couple of sessions with a counselor (either alone or with your husband).  Do you belong to a church?  If so, is there a women's group that can give you a hand?  A clergyman or church leader who can give you and your husband some sage advice and help you work through some problems?  What about friends or family members?  Maybe one of them could watch your son for a few hours, or give you a hand around the house.  I suspect you're feeling extremely alone and overwhelmed right now, and this is perfectly normal for the situation you're in.  Take a deep breath, pull out a pen and paper, and start making a list of your resources.  Friends, family, church, work, social groups, and anyone else you can think of.  Call out the cavalry, it's time to let yourself be rescued!|`|AwvWBROlaa	you are not a horrible person... my mom always said not to bottle feelings and just let it peak everytime it needs to.. if you are upset maybe crying is not a bad idea, if you feel like your two sons are not behaving than telling them that you are too tired to handle them isnt a bad idea either.. try to ask your husband and your kids what you need out of them. just dont keep hiding your feelings and talk to your family. instead of having your " own time" maybe what you need is a good " family time" go out with your family on the weekend and get something good to eat and have a movie night at home with some snacks.     i hope you feel better =)|`|PipAzETraa	I just think it's stressful not getting time to yourself. Go out ... get some air. Watch a movie alone ... take a walk .... |`|JvA3qyzJaa	i am not a proffesional and im young but i think that as hard as it may be, you need to find time for yourself, get a babysitter and have a girls night out or something. i go to an independant study and i am cooped up all day in my house and i get moody and everything also, i just find time to go out and exersise or hangout with my friends.|`|hiY7CCc7aa	Stress - early depression  My mom said that when you first have a baby you do tend to get weepy and soft - due to new emotions.  Also your husband is home and you not getting anytime for yourself  I would read a book or try get out....  just for a little, I know it's not easy with your husband being hurt and home
Ihfq3Ih5aa	I too agree with the sentiment that if you always question your finances, then you really never will decide to have a baby!    Having said that, 21 is still young, I'd personally finish your years of schooling first.  A newborn is a tough responsibility, and although it sounds like it would be easy to complete your course online, on time while the baby is sleeping, it's not!    Your biological clock is not ticking loud enough just yet! I personally would wait until you finished schooling.    Since you asked for our opinions, I think the idea of people thumbs downing others is a little juvenile.    Of course ultimately it's your choice.|`|ed45267264b8e14db51a0d554e40d2a3aa	Hun, no one will ever tell you when you are ready. Remember it's YOUR & your husband's life so talk with him ask him when he is ready with you, you and him can have baby any time by now because you and him are married so no one will ever tell you should wait. If you and your husband is ready THEN GO FOR IT! I am 21, I am also married to my husband who's 26 we got a house then got a baby who is almost 17 months old baby boy, We are also expecting again due in march we are so happy with our choice. I wish you and your husband best of luck, remember you are married and it's your life! don't let any one Judge you.|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	I'm going to insert what I responded to the last person that asked this question -> (Honestly if you keep questioning your finances you will never have children. Of course we all would like to be most comfortable in our financial situations so we can procreate without any stress, but realistically money has no meaning or does not equivalate to being ready for baby. When it happens, it happens. When I became pregnant with my daughter, my husband and I weren't in the best financial state but we made do with what we had. Now look almost 3 years later we are currently better off than before.    But yes it is normal to contemplate your future and the future of children, if you're bank account isn't mega large. That is every family's back thought.)    -Now if you feel comfortable and you want to be a mother. Go for it! Nothing is stopping and you are so true when you say life is too short these days. You guys sound very stable and responsible and I'm sure a child or children will only add on to your happiness.    Good Luck    xx    Edit- Do not listen to those people that are trying to quell your happiness. Only you and your husband know what is best for each other, and age has nothing to do with it. Usually the one's judging harshly are the same one's that's never been pregnant before or has children. Listen to your heart.|`|FxAD44Moaa	you are so not ready for a child....      |`|Yn6pM2Xyaa	honestly i would wait until finishing school.  21 is really young.. i liked being footloose and fancy free at that age..  around 25 i felt more settled, had been working for a few years and just felt like i was who i was.  with the economic downturn i'd also want to wait and see how things go once Obama gets in power (im so assuming you are in the usa)  (Im in canada)  and also what does your husbands career hold for him?  i've always heard that the military doesnt pay all that well in the usa (my hubby is in the canadian military) and many don't stay in for all that long.  you've got lots of time to have babies.. wait like 2-3 years and then start popping them out|`|bf2b826fb186efa4963970654d24ac34aa	There's no such thing as the "perfect time" to have kids. People use the excuse of finances and such, but I guess they don't realize that once you have that worked out and baby comes, it's possible to lose your job and everything else too. I believe in being able to take care of your kids, don't get me wrong about that. But what if someday never comes? Also think of this: the chances of health risks to mother & baby go up as women grow older. Don't interfere with nature (meaning no B/C) and let nature take it's course. When it happens for you, that's the right time.|`|Drze0cUXaa	your right.. life is too short and I think highly of young mothers-being that I am one. It's the most amazing feeling ever to be a mother, you will be surprised at how much you can love another human being. Good luck!|`|rBNANXzNaa	Go for it honey....ive found its never the "perfect" time to have ababy. lol, buut no matter what things always work out...best of luck with your decsion|`|StGVnXukaa	if you want to be around when your first is still a baby, i would say yes.  seeing how you are going to be at home taking classes for the next two years|`|TAbAWJSFaa	I'll tell you what someone told me.. you're never "ready" to have kids... So why put it off... If both of you think you're capable of being a loving parent and taking care of a child then get to it!! You definitely seem to be in a much better condition than a lot of people who are having kids!! Good luck!|`|AA11155768	Honestly, I wish I'd started having kids at a young age because of the same reason. Truthfully, sometimes it's better to wait. Lots of people wait until they are 25 or older to have kids now. You'll have a lot more patience and you'll have more time to enjoy your husband. With him being deployed, I definitely say wait until he's been home for a year because returning home will be stressful. Not to mention, you are in school. Even classes online will be a little more difficult with a crying baby. And, $3,000 is not as much as you think. What happens to that extra $1,000/month if you, your husband, or the baby gets ill?    Have patience and wait a couple years. After that, spacing your children 2-3 years apart, you'll be done having children by the age of 35 (your husband, 38) and you'll both be patient, loving parents with lots of experience.|`|3LyxezBqaa	Congrats on your mature relationship. I think that you are still very young. I think even if you have your first at 24, you will have plenty of years ahead for three more. I think the pregnancy process is a time when you want to have your hubby with you. I think you should follow your heart though. You sound like you have a great head on your shoulders and you have your stuff together. I just know if it was me, I would want my husband to go through all the emotions and aches with me. |`|4917bb54185a6e0ce588c170c8db1bc9aa	 I don't think anyone is ever "ready". Having a baby completely changes your life and doing it as a military mom sometimes feels like your doing it alone. I don't regret our decision to have our little one at all but there are things people don't tell you.     Anytime, Anywhere... aint gonna happen anymore. Not with sex, going out, drinking, vacations.... NOTHING. Everything takes a backseat to your family for at least a few years. IF you still want to go on vacations, take a cruise, romantic getaway go to the amusement park... whatever, DO IT NOW!    Have a plan. What do you want your roles in this family to be, what are your feelings on discipline, etc. Work it out now, before the baby comes.    What if you can't have children? What would you want to do. Discuss it. It could happen.   Have those answers? You know what you want. Do it. I think you guys are in a great place to do whatever you decide is best. |`|IJNDTZ2Faa	I THINK THAT YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND NEED TO MAKE THAT DECISION AND NO ONE ELSE|`|espu6h8Eaa	If you feel like you need to ask someone, and explain your financial situation, your own doubts probably mean you are not ready.  I didn't have kids until I was 27, both mine, and my husbands mothers had kids at 17.  It was much better older, we lived our lives, then without trying it just happened - they chose their time to come, we weren't trying.  We have two now, at the worst point financially, as soon as we took over a restaurant we got pregnant.  But they are the best part of our lives.  Live your life, finish school and party a little while you still can!!!  Wait until your husbands not out to sea also, it is hard enough to deal with him being gone, imagine trying to raise a newborn with him gone on his next deployment!  |`|jHHMSTmEaa	well first there is never a perfect time to have a baby. if you have a good marriage and a stable income and lots of love thats all you need. My husband and i just had our first. We waited 7 years because i was not ready. I am glad we did but to me it seems like you are ready. My only advice is the school thing....my daughter just turned 3 months and she is so so time consuming! i love her to death and would not trade her for anything..but i dont think you will have the energy to finish school at least in the beginning. When babies are small they dont sleep much at night and when they are about 2 to 3 months they want to be held or entertained pretty much all the time. By the time my husband gets home i use that time to eat, take a shower and maybe do some house work. So just know that a baby will change everything and as long as you are ready do it! She is the best thing that has ever happened to me! And the hardest!lol 
s7UZ8kD9aa	So, you went the prescription drug route.  Now, go the natural route.  Crazy but true...my 6 year old step son has a bad case of ADHD.  A couple months ago, me and my husband put him on an all natural product called BrightSpark.  We also put him on another product that was supposed to work well with the BrightSpark, called Focus Formula.  Since then, it has worked wonders!  Although he isn't perfectly quiet and subdoed, his mannerisms have changed for the better.  He focusses more at school and his work has gotten much better.  You should really try this stuff out!  Remember, though, she's still a kid.  You'll have your good days and bad days, but she's only a first grader!  Good luck!|`|e3xxes6zaa	Physicians who are paid kick-backs from pharmaceutical companies will happily dole out meds, but are usually reluctant to tell you what a huge factor diet plays into ADD, ADHD and symptoms of Autism.   Try a gluten and refined-sugar free diet.  It isn't an unpleasant sentance, i assure you!  Gluten-free foods are very simple to come by now, and most are a usual part in a healthy diet, anyway.  As far as the refined sugar goes, start small, and just banish High Fructose Corn syrup from your home, which is found in everything from fruit juice, to breakfast cereal, to frozen dinners.  Also, consider a vegetable/flax derived Omega 3,6,9 suppliment for your daughter, and anyone else in your house.  These powerful nutrients found in fish and plants regulate every brain function from attention span to our tempers, memory  and propensity for depression!  Have at least 1,000mg a day.    With a little bit of planning, and a couple weeks of detox, you will probably see an amazing difference.|`|J8ZVcKEAaa	Meds can be a pain if they don't work for your child.    Try a change in diet, nothing too sugary or something that will make her agitated.    Also sit her down, and try to talk with her, and say she needs to pay attention the best she can.    Set up a reward cycle if she does good. Talk with the teacher and tell her to write a note to you on how she did that day. Keep reminding your daughter as well, about what she will get if she does good.    Do not spoil her, but eventually she will naturally start being good.    This worked with my young brother.|`|UrrRgmDwaa	How long did you try the meds? They take awhile to get adjusted in your system like several months. I might talk to her doctor again.|`|AA11155768	All of the provided answers are great suggestions! Whatever you decide to do, be consistent! If you decide to try the change in diet, make sure it's an every day change and stick to it for 6 months before giving up. If you decide to try prescription meds, again, be consistent. Try it daily for 6 months. I've seen many children with ADD or ADHD only receive medication during the school week and then lapse on the weekends or during school breaks.  This does not allow for a constant flow of medication and knocks the body into a neverending cycle. Also, check out support groups and research online. There are always new methods for dealing with ADD popping up!    Good luck and God bless!|`|Z19lxWKOaa	Try a non-processed, natural diet free from refined foods, especially sugars and food additives.    Sometimes children can be child like at school because they haven't worked out for themselves what fun learning can be.|`|35144678fb001cc0cb431dfa33d578c4aa	I wasn't a fan of the medicine either and tried the other alternatives and they didn't work.  Have you tried Focalin XR.  It really works for my son.  It really helps him focus and after years of trouble in school, he is a much better student...and more calm at home.  |`|QrKRPwZgaa	I'm 14 and I have A.D.D too.  I took Ritalin and stuff began to get better.  Just don't do what my mom did and make her feel like she's mentally retarded.  It makes you feel alone, and idiotic.    Hmmm, I'm sorry. I don't know what else to tell you...  Tell her she needs to try her best, and encourage her.

8f9653f5840edd9ccccd5d05f0b3ecc6aa	O    Raika  O Santa Joana  muito bom|`|b5YwGgRpaa	As duas maternidades s?o referencias e possuem a mesma administra??o (s?o dos mesmos proprietrios).  Eu tive meu bebe no Santa Joana e do inicio ao fim fui muito bem tratada, o atendimento  excelente fiquei num quarto bem em frente ao ber?ario, ent?o qdo meu filhote n?o estava comigo bastava eu abrir a porta que o via no ber?ario. Meu filho esta com um ano e quatro meses, uma amiga minha me disse que agora em cada quarto tem uma TV que filma 24hs o bebe no be?ario.  Meus familiares disseram ser emocionante qdo o bebe aparece no tel?o apos o nascimento, isso  muito legal pq mesmo antes de ir para o quarto todos ja podem ver o bebe.  A minha prima teve o bebe dela no Pro Matre em agosto, ela gostou do atendimento mas l  uma maternidade mais cheia de "frescurinhas", mais VIP mesmo, ent?o algumas coisas ela achou exagero, e sem contar que o bebe demora de 6 a 8 horas para poder ir para o quarto apos o nascimento, ent?o os pais s podem ver o bebe na hora do parto e depois qdo for liberado para o quarto, nem no ber?ario eles ficam!  Sobre o barulho da reforma converse com o atendimento da maternidade e fale q gostaria de ter seu bebe l mas que esta reciosa devido ao barulho, eles tomar?o as devidas providencias.  Antes de escolher qual maternidade tera seu bebe, converse com o seu medico ele poder te orientar alguns medico tm preferencias por determinadas maternidades, o meu por exemplo, possui uma equipe dentro do Santa Joana pelo menos uns 30 anos e por isso prefere fazer seus partos l, o que nos passa muito mais seguran?a.  Espero ter ajudado! Boa Sorte e que Deus aben??e a hora do seu parto, saude para seu bebe.|`|EGKkx6QCaa	O bercario do Santa Joana fica no mesmo andar, mais facil ver o nenem! .

AA11155768	Well, you've shown great maturity but looking for help. Kudos! You don't have to change your personality to please everyone else but since you know you've behaved irrationally, a change does need to be made. You sound a lot like me and I hate the idea of having to kiss butt but the truth is, if you don't kiss a little, you aren't going to get very far. Don't just react when people confront you. Learn to keep your cool and respond calmly. Get a job, open a bank account, and enroll in college to show you are responsible and ready for adulthood. Live on campus or save your money and get an apartment with a roommate. Make sure you plan a budget beforehand.     Some people are prone to making bad decisions and it's very hard to move forward when someone is making all the decisions for you. I've been there. I hope you have someone to confide it because you will need an ear while you are on the road to independence. Just make sure it's someone who listens more than gives advice.     Good luck and God bless!|`|C3WlLuYoaa	Wisdom comes with age. Try to think about the words you will say before you say them and the choices you will make before you make them.

AA11808736	Oi Nina!! Eu tambm sinto! Quando a barriga endurece, significa que o tero est se contrando. Essas contra??es s?o chamadas de Braxton Hicks. Normalmente come?am a aparecer por volta da vigsima semana de gesta??o. Essas contra??es podem ser sentidas mais cedo ou com maior intensidade se for a segunda ou terceira gesta??o. Voc perceber os msculos do seu tero contraindo-se por 30 a 60 segundos. Entende-se que o tero est exercitando-se, preparando-se para as contra??es verdadeiras de trabalho de parto que ajudar?o a empurrar o beb quando chegar a hora de nascer.  Nem todas mulheres sentem essas contra??es espordicas e normalmente indolores, que ganharam esse nome de John Braxton Hicks, um doutor ingls que foi o primeiro a descrev-las em 1872.  Ent?o fique tranquila porque isso  super normal! Voc s deve se preocupar caso sinta contra??o acompanhada de:  * Dor na parte inferior das costas  * As contra??es forem regulares e seu intervalo estiver diminuindo  * Perda de lquidos atravs da vagina    Eu estou com 7 meses agora!

AA11808736	Minha nutricionista diz que o consumo de protena como o leite precisa ser aumentado, pois ela participa da forma??o enzimtica, hormonal e ainda atua na produ??o de anticorpos e no desenvolvimento dos tecidos, incluindo a Placenta, o sangue da mam?e e do beb.   O leite tambm  uma boa fonte de clcio   Durante a gesta??o em torno de 25g a 30g de clcio s?o transferidos para o feto, principalmente no terceiro trimestre.Este mineral  necessrio para o desenvolvimento dos ossos do beb e tambm ajuda a previnir que a m?e venha a ter problemas de fraqueza nos ossos depois da gravidez. A necessidade do Calcio  crucial durante o terceiro trimestre, quando a forma??o dos ossos  finalizada. Se a m?e n?o est ingerindo Clcio suficiente para o beb, ele por sua vez vai se utilizar das reservas maternas para satisfazer as suas necessidades de desenvolvimento deixando a m?e em condi??es inapropriadas para a sua sade futura. A falta deste mineral pode trazer prejuzo ao crescimento e desenvolvimento fetal podendo prejudicar a press?o sangunea, propiciando contra??es uterinas prematuras e consequentemente, parto prematuro.    O clcio est presente no leite pasteurizado e derivados, sardinha, salm?o e soja.  Portanto o mais importante n?o  a quantidade de copos de leite e sim uma alimenta??o equilibrada, rica em diversos nutrientes como vitaminas, sais minerais(clcio) , protenas e cido flico !

O espermatozide  muito sensvel fora do organismo ele vive s uns minutos e depois eles morrem ficando s o lquido espermtico sem espermatozides vivos.  E eles tb n?o passam atravs de roupas.  O que te falaram sobre o beta hcg  mentira,pois este exame j d positivo logo que sua menstrua??o atrasa.  Voc  muito novinha por isto seu ciclo menstrual ainda  desregulado,com o passar do tempo ele vai regulando.  Luz no seu cora??o.Abra?os.|`|AA11808736	Querida, acho difcil, praticamente impossvel. Principalmente porque o ato sexual em si n?o existiu ( penetra??o) e sim apenas uns amassos. Pelo seu histrico parece que sua menstrua??o sempre atrasa! Outra coisa, sint?mas de gravidez s aparecem aps um mes de atraso da menstrua??o.  Outro detalhe importante  o beta....Se deu menor que 25 ent?o vc n?o est grvida!!!  Oque vc deve fazer  se acalmar e esperar a menstrua??o chegar. N?o sei a sua idade , mas se for menor de 20 anos  muito comum ocorrer altera??es hormonais que causem atrasos. Ficar ansiosa s vai fazer a menstrua??o atrasar mais ainda! Ent?o relaxe, vc n?o est grvida!!! Se engravidar fosse t?o fcil assim, n?o existiriam tantas mulheres tentando durante anos um filho .  Bjs!  PS: Caso sua dvida seja incessante, fa?a um teste de urina, vc pode comprar em farmcia,  bem baratinho ou procure um laboratrio e fa?a o exame de sangue "BETA HCG QUALITATIVO"  Fique tranquilinha!

Zy07f0Zwaa	Well if you had unprotected sex it could very well mean you are pregnant. Take an Early Pregnancy Test (these can be used up to 5 days before a missed period) and only use your first morning urine!!    Good luck xx |`|AA11155768	You'll have to wait a little longer to get an accurate reading on a pregnancy test but it could just be symptoms of ovulation. Are you on birth control? Do you perform monthly breast exams?|`|Nrdo4vPPaa	pregnancy is a possibility, but it is unlikely that you were fertile just before or just after your period (assuming you have a normal 28 day cycle).   it is most likely that you have just finished ovulating and are experiencing a common symptom of post-ovulation.  my breasts are almost always tender about two weeks before my period starts.  if you miss your period this month, definitely test for pregnancy.. otherwise, chalk the tender breasts up to ovulation and the hormonal changes that go along with that.  (if you had unprotected sex with someone other than a monogamous partner, its a good idea to get checked for STDs too, pregnant or not!)
uVX0crKQaa	Yes. It happens to everyone.|`|AA11155768	It's perfectly normal. Now would be a good time to talk to your parents or guardian about those feelings and what they mean. Also, don't be afraid to set boundaries on how far someone should go when touching your body. You only have the one and you should treat it with the utmost respect!|`|YPuVx2Niaa	I don't think anything is wrong with it.  He is your guy friend.  You like him.  What kind of "weird" are you referring to anyway?  |`|ecrUWUfPaa	Yeah no biggy.  im 14 too and i've had sex...i did when i was 12.  im not telling you to go have sex with him, im just   saying its totally normal|`|7mU1Uz7faa	i think its normal im 13 so i feel like that alot i have ALOT of guy friends that do that they even slap my butt you will get use to it|`|rwHfH6rGaa	aw..  yeah you should, he isnt your boyfriend but he jumped on you lol, but it was probably nice. lucky =P    im 13 too. no exprience with guys =/|`|1c9b05db70015f6bfcc9ec59efd40caaaa	ya i think its perfectly normal to ahve feelings like tht!!lol|`|dIRrn5c0aa	You answer the question :D|`|zDQIKDNoaa	awwwuuuuhhhhh u like himmmmmmm....|`|nPBGjWGuaa	yah. |`|Qky4RR2Caa	I think he wants some milk :)
7IkciUtUaa	Sounds like a yeast/vaginal infection.  Douching does not help, and often makes it worse by getting rid of all the good bacteria.  Since you aren't 100% positive, I would see your doctor just so he can make sure, but usually it takes a little monistat for a few days and you're back to normal.|`|eY0MhGfmaa	You probably just have a simple bacterial or yeast infection. They don't always itch.    You should see your doc and get it cleared up.|`|5vU73VLuaa	The easiest thing to do would be to go to the drugstore and buy one of those Monistat kits, that include the test strips. It will let you know if, and what kind of infection you may have. The odor might imply that there is an infection deeper inside, which is why it doesn't itch. Good luck. |`|YJ3UJWwKaa	I'd suffered something similar years ago and I put it down to my form of contraception and diet.  Also, if you've only just had a baby your hormone levels will be so out of wack it may be a number of different things but you should go to your Doctor (or family planning if you are too embarrassed)     Also, bite the bullet and tell your husband, it probably smells really bad to you but to them....like a bed of roses!|`|AA11155768	First of all, don't ever douche! Women should never douche. Our vaginae have a naturally built in cleaning mechanism and douching will only make things much much worse. Second, don't be ashamed to speak to your husband and don't keep waiting around hoping it will clear up! It's probably just an infection but you should not attempt to diagnose yourself, even with a store bought kit. Also, you do want to make sure if you have sex with your husband that you use a condom to keep from spreading it to him and if it's anything contagious, make sure your doctor prescribes something to clear your husband so that it doesn't return.     Good luck and God bless!|`|lZ40hi7gaa	it couldn't hurt to get some good flora in your system by eating yogurt with live cultures or taking a probiotic supplement (I like the refrigerated powdered kind myself)  Look at health food store or Whole Foods.  If it is yeast that will help clear it up (have you had anitbiotics recently?), and if not it is still good for  you.|`|vorphSsraa	even though there's no pain or itching, it could be a vaginal infection. I was diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis after having a regular pap smear. I had no symptoms or anything! So, i'd just make an appointment.|`|W1l6OP8Maa	I think u might have a std. u might want to go get checked out. when was ur last pap? sorry to tell u, but i wouldnt let ur husband know ur goin to get checked out and if it comes back that u have somethin and u say u havent been with anyone else, than u know ur husband has.|`|SQpTLo6Eaa	maybe you should go see your doc,it could be just hormones but i wouldn't suggest to douche it pushes the discharge back up in you and could lead to bacteria.
AA11155768	I would stick to bubble baths made for babies. But, be careful of using bubble baths too often...especially for girls. They can be damaging with long term use.|`|H4OlfmOaaa	i use johnsons baby saop for my daughters bubble bath... its tear free and if you use your hand to mix it in the water real good it will make a lot of bubbles... or try ordering something from avon|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	I was told to really steer away from Bubble baths till kids are older. They eat the bubbles and if your child is a girl it greatly increases the risks of Bladder Infections. IF you want a few bubble just use the baby wash and put it in the cap and run it under the tub water.|`|nLNge18haa	Mr Bubble for sensitive skin (white bottle)|`|AA10244380	I use Johnson & Johnson's baby wash in Oatmeal and Vanilla scent and LOVE it.  It smells wonderful, we get lots of bubbles and it's tear-free. 
s7UZ8kD9aa	You need to find out if the kick to your son's "privates" was an accident or an intentional assault.  Either way, you can inform the principal that you feel the yard duty was in the wrong and should be chastised.  You don't want people watching your children that "don't care" and neither do other parents!  If the attack on your son was malicious, then you can ask the principal to take further actions against the child involved.  This could be something like a formal apology letter or community service at the school (you know, helping to clean up the classrooms).  Unfortunately, my 6-year-old stepson has gotten into some trouble.  He hurt another child at school.  Not only did he get punished at home, but he was suspended from the after care program at school.  He got community service, and he had to write an apology letter to the boy and his parents.  Make sure that you are asserting your rights as a parent.  No one has the right to hurt your child.  If they do, it is the school's responsibility to take the proper actions.  They are responsible for your child when he is at the school.  They shouldn't have people there that aren't in your child's best interest!!!|`|a8IRxC4raa	Your son is the victim of assault.  He is protected by the same laws that apply when he is not in school.  Unfortunately, the school is not going to enforce these laws for you.      Teachers belong to extremely powerful unions and their jobs are protected unless they, themselves break a law.  Not caring about this assault is not against the law.    If the principal does not take action, the best thing for you would be to file assault charges against the perpetrator.    All the best.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	the laws vary by district.  talk to your principal and file a police report, but remember that kids are still kids.|`|BRT2teSqaa	Well what happened?  Was it another child?  Maybe the person on duty just figured it was kids being kids and didn't think it was a big deal.  Was your son in obvious pain?|`|5LBwP3MFaa	Its something that happens. Its the life of being a male. The person on yard duty should have made sure your son was alright and sent the kicker to the office.|`|AA11155768	Please report this to your principal immediately. There are laws protecting our children in school just as in other areas of society and action should be taken against the adult on duty who said she didn't care. There is a reason she's on yard duty and it's not just to improve the curb appeal.    Good luck and God bless.
AA11155768	You may want to try posting this in the legal section but I'll try to help. Laws vary from state-to-state though. First, do not let him off the hook for child support, no matter how well off he is. You never know what your financial or medical outlook will be like in the future and you can always put it away for a college fund for your child if you don't need it right away. Second, contact your local social services or Department of Family and Children Services. You will need assistance with this battle and you don't want to be caught with your panties down! Third, unless he can prove you are an unfit mother or live in an unhealthy situation, you don't have much to worry about. You don't want to miss that court date without having some time of representation. Even if you don't get served the papers, a judge could still rule against you.    Also, you need a new doctor. I don't know of any doctor that would put a patient on bed rest less than 2 months into the pregnancy. Most doctors won't take preventive measures to prevent miscarriage until you are at least 13 weeks unless your health is in serious danger. |`|02afccc3abbd7877c182c4b1daa8d2a9aa	You need to get what your doctor states your condition is in writing and then type your own letter to the Judge.  Send your letter and the letter from the doc (keep a copy for yourself) to the Judge.  You must have received something to know a court hearing is in two weeks.  They can find you one way or the other.  If you don't have time to mail this info then you need call the Courthouse ask for this Judge's secretary and ask if you can fax the info.  The other thing that is going against you is the fact that you won't let the ex-boyfriend know your address.  If he's paying child support then it's being sent somewhere and the other thing, he has every legal right to know the address and phone number of where his child is unless harm has been done to you and the child.  Even if he wasn't paying child support, he still has that right.
C3WlLuYoaa	Lets first stop and take a breath and think about the situations calmly.   1. You don't feel loved,etc, etc right?    Here's some advice: You've got to stop worrying about boys so much. Don't look for a boyfriend, just let the good times roll, enjoy your friends while you aren't dating anyone because that time becomes limited when you start to date someone. I also would stop randomly making out with guys. You've got to value yourself enough before you can value someone else.  Be glad you don't have a lot of "ex" drama, because that's not as fun as it sounds.    2. You don't like the school you attend?    If you really want to change schools, you need to have some really good reasons. For example, the new school offers a better educational advantage or program that you are interested in. When you go to your mom, you have to sound well informed about the school you want to move to and make sure this is really what you want to do. |`|QN2plIhdaa	no matter what school you go to its all going to be the same, and as for guys, do not try so hard, the right one will come to you, believe me, |`|msF8mTT5aa	hey, if you do convince your mom to let you switch, the school that you go to then might have better guys for you.  i'd work on the convincing part first, before you worry about guys.|`|kuvwYBGMaa	First of all, the guys you are making out with just want sex. You need to wait for somebody who will respect you. And also, lots of girls brag about their exes, but honestly, they lie so they look more experienced. They probably are making out with guys like you are but have no real relationships, which involve a lot more than sex and kissing. Also, the more secure you feel about yourself, the more attractive you are to guys. You are most likely not ugly, every adolescent girl thinks this. I used to, and now I have a very loving boyfriend and we are planning a family. I just had to get past that I hate me phase and be me and it worked out.    Suck it up for the school thing. You won't be in high school forever.|`|AA10724994	We all need to be Loved but we sometimes find it in the most unusual  ways, As we grow we have the tendency to compare to past experience's, especially relationships. think about what you really want in life and grow towards that.  Cheers|`|OBZ71sn3aa	you seem normal to me. Just ask a guy to be your bf, if you can get a guy to make out with you, you will have NO problem gettin a bf      http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...|`|VSzF36Ywaa	Guys probably think you're a bit easy coz you make out with lots of guys and go out with none.  And yeah I don't think a day counts as a relationship.  |`|2JymDhgdaa	Toadstools|`|AA11155768	Let me start with the second question. First, you have to be able to present a well thought out, mature argument if you want your mother to seriously consider changing your schools. Present her with the reasons you feel you should be allowed to change and also consider the reasons why she would not want you to change schools.     As for your first question, I have no idea what having a boyfriend for a day means to you but it certainly doesn't sound like he was worth a thought. Making out with a lot of guys shows your immaturity and is probably why you want to change schools. You really sound as if you could use a self-esteem boost and guidance. Please get involved in some activities with other girls your age and stop trying to force a relationship. Consider volunteering or joining a Big Sister program (as a little sister). Also, I think it's time you discuss the birds and the bees with your mother or another responsible adult.    Please find other constructive ways to spend your time so you can build your self-esteem and learn to respect your body. You only get one and you don't want everyone to have at it.     Good luck and God bless.|`|TkT2oKAfaa	Yeah whats up with all these rude answers on Y!A lately? Dont those people have anything better to do.     I dont know if having a boy friend for a day actually qualifies as a boy friend. Sounds more like a one night stand to me.|`|HpWCjBv6aa	Don't try to hard to get a boyfriend, else you will seem desperate.  Guys don't go for desperate girls, unless they're trying to get in the pants.  It's true.  Don't worry about not having one, or finding The One.  Trust me, it'll all come in its own time.    Why do you hate the school you go to?  Is it the people, the curriculum, what do you hate about it?  Chances are, if it's something like being teased or not being liked, it'll be the same at every school.  I'm not saying you won't fit in, but that's general school-age crap that everyone has to go through.  Builds character and all that nonsense.|`|iqlRyXD0aa	this may be a shock but the majority of teens are like you, thats how i am. what ive learned is that were all just trying to fit in. Why do you need to have a boyfriend anyways? Just to make you feel better about yourself right? Arent we all a little selfish for thinking that way?    school sucks everywhere mind as well stay! :)    good luck with life!
AA11155768	It is very possible for a 19 month old to lash out. My now 13 year old was very manipulative at that age. She would cry and throw temper tantrums when her grandmother was around to make it seem like I was hurting her in order to get her way. When I put her in time out, she would throw herself to the floor knowing I would run in and pick her up and coddle her.     Acknowledge her feelings and speak firmly during these tantrums. Make sure you get to her level and look her in the eye and let her know that the behavior is NOT ok and then put her in time out. (1 minute per year of age.) Also, make sure you are showing her things she CAN do in place of the things she's isn't allowed to do. Sometimes kids get frustrated from hearing all the NOs and not being shown any YES's.    Good luck and God bless.|`|sbedPdLDaa	You have to keep firm and tell her NO over and over again until she learns. She's going through terrible 2's now, not fun for you but the more you teach her what the work NO means, the easier it will be. |`|1Q0ZnVdaaa	It seems as though she is old enough to go to her room.  My little girl learned quick that way.  My 11 month old actually laid in the floor once and pitched a fit.  Some people say, they are born with it.  Your child sounds very spirited, which is healthy.  Just let her know you are boss and hopefully it's just a phase.|`|fovMmVBYaa	Please look up Dr. Dobson's website and get a few books on parenting.  Your child is having a temper tantrum and trying to control you.  Each child is different so what works for one will not work for another.  Time out may work with time spent in a particular spot.  Maybe taking her to her bedroom and closing the door - telling her she can come out when she is ready to behave may help.    Dr. Dobson's website is Focus on the Family and he is a well known psychologist who specializes in parenting and child care.
JUXAK0euaa	When did you have the miscarriage? If you haven't had the bleeding yet then it's probably cramping now to expel the pregnancy.|`|AA11155768	How long have you been feeling the pain? On a scale of 1-10 with 10 being the absolute worst pain you've ever felt in your life, how would you rate it? (Obviously not a 10 or you wouldn't be at the computer.) If you can wait another hour, then it could possibly be gas. If your insurance company has a nurse hotline to call for advice, then do so. If you can reach your doctor for advice, do so. Otherwise, go to the hospital if the pain does not start to let up or you experience more symptoms.|`|pqqDS4sfaa	i would go to the ER just to be sure, ectopic pregnancies can be dangerous to you so just be safe i'd go in. good luck, sorry to hear for your loss.    God Bless|`|j2XImuUhaa	Honestly I do think you should go to the ER! Better be safe than sorry... it could be nothing at all or it could be something! I would feel better if you go and get check out! I hope you the best if you decided to go!|`|HKEywfRkaa	Sorry to hear about your loss. I had a miscarriage at 12 weeks, about 8 months ago and bled REALLY badly. I had to go back to the hospital because I was in so much pain and I was losing alot of blood. They ended up doing a d&c just in case it hadn't all come away properly and that could've been what was causing the pain. Afterwards the pain was heaps better.  I suggest getting to the ER now rather than later. Even if it is just gas, better to have it checked and be on the safe side than to get sick.
aRDWH8Qraa	yes you are|`|b17cb0e70d1cd57271e4ba763c7fbc30aa	You might be. Take a clear blue easy test that allows you to test 5 days earlier than  when your period is due. Or wait until after your period is late.|`|AA11155768	Sounds like menstrual cramps and lack of a proper diet. How long had it been since you had a meal when you experienced the dizziness? If you aren't pregnant, please get some birth control AND condoms. You aren't married yet and by the way you described your boyfriend, I'm guessing you aren't out of school or financially secure enough to bring a child into the world.     Good luck.|`|VG5nmdr1aa	all you can do is wait and see if ur period comes, and then test|`|sj7WeGG2aa	what you have mentioned are all symptoms of pregnancy that many others had experienced, but unless you test it, that's the only way you can confirmed if you really are pregnant...your situation maybe psychological or co-incidence...what i can advice is test..test...test..|`|JUXAK0euaa	You didn't say if you used a condom. If you didn't then you're probably pregnant. That's what you wanted, isn't it?|`|WxQFe0GYaa	The only person who can help you is the cashier at the drug store when you buy a test!  Sorry, but there's no way for anyone to know if you're pregnant.  It's possible, of course!|`|AA12089381	U already know the answer to this question. U just want to hear other ppl tell u that yes, it is always possible for u to be pregnant if u've had sex with a "boy".|`|YDkKzAUPaa	take a test and ask a doctor or find info on it! good luck!|`|YaxCsxpQaa	I think you're not... maybe you're just delayed ...|`|i3zNhcPtaa	Are you having strong cravings for anything?  like food,fun,the fresh smell of gain? jk.    If you have that then it's a strong yes!!!  If not you should really think of seeing a doctor.    Hope you feel better.
AA11155768	Sounds like a light period. Not too much to be concerned about. Oh, and there was no need for the post above me to be posted in all caps. (It's considered yelling and how would she know whether or not you are pregnant.) A light period is nothing to freak out about.|`|7KCsSTrTaa	there's many things it could be, if you don't have at least a light period soon i would go to the doctor.
4b045bed7aeb597819a17cafdaf98978aa	Because you're not an adult yet and she is your mother.  You'll think differently once your child is born....and especially when he/she grows up.  She's worried about you and loves you.  She has every right to say things like that.  And stop protecting your child's father.  I think his parents SHOULD know what a jerk they have raised.|`|1ASc1Is7aa	Um maybe because her daughter just got herself pregnant, that is why. Obviously now she knows you are having sex and not responsible sex. She is worried about you and also mad about your ex leaving you with just the baby, when he should take responsibility too. |`|XjLmgPIoaa	How old are you?    EDIT:     Because you're 16 years old and have already gotten yourself into a pretty bad predicament where youre pregnant with a boys child that doesn't want anything to do with you or your baby.     He by the way, had just as much sex as you did to make this pregnancy happen, so just because he doesn't Want to take responsability, doesn't exempt him of his responsability.     She is worried about her baby having a baby and probably thinks you can't handle as much freedom responsibly as you had before. Your mom will get used to it eventually but if I was her, AND if I was you, I'd tell Mr. Happypants' parents.|`|4U8VW1YAaa	First of all CONGRATULATIONS!!  its sounds like your in high school and she is just mad that u are pregnant. but she will get over it, as soon as the baby is born. and ur mom is doing the right thing about telling the boy's folks b/c why does he need to get away from taking responsibly. and im assuming that he's ur ex after u telling him that ur pregnant. if u don't want ur mom telling the ex's parents then u need to do so.   |`|AA11155768	Your mother had to work through the shock of her 'baby' having a baby. The only way you could have stopped your mother from 'being on your back' was by making responsible decisions in the first place. You're a pregnant teenager, still dependent on your mother. The last thing you need to worry about is going out. I agree, you've played enough already. You are about to be a parent so you might as well start to get use to it now.     As for your mother telling your Ex's parents, she's doing exactly what she should be doing to ensure her grandchild's future. Even if the 2 of you are no longer together, he should still be there through the pregnancy and experience as much inconvenience as what your mom is about to experience. If you don't want her to tell them, you should tell them and then all grandparents should get together to discuss what's going to happen next.    Give your mom a break and be grateful she's there for you. Have you apologized?    Good luck. |`|zKHKs3Auaa	she won't 'leave you alone' because 'leaving you alone' was what caused this mess in the 1st place.     you're 16, knocked up, the father is out of the picture, his parents don't know. what part of this sounds like it's a good situation?    you are lucky she is your mom instead of me, cause the dads parents would ALREADY know and you would either do as i say or be out of my house.    count your blessings to be her daughter... and be nice to your mom who is supporting you during all this!|`|LnaujxN7aa	sit down with her and comely explain how u feel. also tell her if she was ur age what would she want to do.|`|jnnl060daa	She loves you and cares about you a lot. btw, she thinks u'll get into a lot more trouble! u need to stop, slow down and get help! if ur under 20 i am very disapointed in u! jk hope i help! =)|`|GG0t1oSkaa	She should let you go out. You can't get anymore pregnant.  |`|PZPlArzraa	Tell her please can i relax for a second.And just stand up and say stop i don't have thing to do with this im pregnant i don't need stress and etc.|`|WawG5G1xaa	i think your mom is right. doesnt sound like your making the best decisions, i mean look at you. your young and pregnant by some loser who wont take resposibilty.   you should listen to your mom. sounds like you got a lot of growing up to do or that kid is going to be in trouble with you raising her or him. im not trying to be a asshole. just being real|`|d2aV5NTdaa	Well you're pregnant DING DONG! I'd be pretty pissed too!|`|1DLBzO1paa	Well if you're 16 and pregnant, then she's probably a little freaked out. She might have just been pretending to be okay with it, and she is probably really worried, although I don't think you can get pregnant when you are already, so maybe if you told her that.
AA11155768	If you are close to your sister, then try talking to her. She may have some things that she wants to get off her chest that she can't speak to your parents about. If she won't talk to you, the only thing you can do is pray for the best and to continue to be a good role model. If you find there's something going on that your parents aren't aware of that could be harmful to your sister, don't be afraid to let someone know.     Good luck!|`|9acXPi8gaa	Oh my gosh. OK, your sister is a kid. A preteen is more like ages 11-12. Revealing clothes and credit cards?! She's 10 for crying out loud! Gossip Girl is not appropriate at all for her. Talk to your sis about her friend and tell her that she shouldn't hang out with her because she's a bad influence. Tell her she needs to act her age and to hang out with good kids. Help her make new friends. |`|DhZ5smpWaa	She's 10, you can't suspect much of her. I think we all can blame the media for messing with innocence of kids. You parents need to get on board with this, and do something. First of all, I think their getting all their ideas from Gossip Girl. So first thing to do, is have them stop watching it. Than your parents should have talk to her. Also, since your the older sister you should set a good example, I'm not saying your not, but also have a talk with her. Who knows, even that can make a difference.|`|ao4r5aPuaa	if you are concerned about her, spend more time with her, talking to her about things, setting the example. hopefully your parents wont give in to her begging.  |`|7eV6SM5Naa	You should ask her what's going on.. Maybe she sees you as a role-model and wants to be older than she is. Or maybe she wants to fit in your "older friends" group, so she can spend more time with you. She just misses her older sister. How cute? Hope I helped :)|`|PbLuxnzdaa	  anyways shes obviously seeing this from somewhere.  ive noticed girls younger than me that i used to know as nice little girls are not wearing push up bras, low cut tops, too much makeup and trying to look way older than they are.  try talking to her, its normal for her wanting to fit in but theres a point when its just too much. NO 10 year old should be watching gossip girl, im a teen but im just saying they constantly talk about sex, bribe people with sex and a lot of them dont have morals.   10 year olds shouldnt be wearing revealing clothes.. i dont even think at 10 i knew what a bra was!    tell your mom, try to talk to her, i had a friend like her when i was younger too, and she wasnt a happy person as much as she liked to fake that she was.    good luck!|`|qfKkpd8vaa	You should just guide your sister to do the right things.

Dfeemjagaa	i say if the guy does not want the child and never did, he needs to give up his rights, or pay child support. why is it the women's body and choice when it come to an Abortion, but the man's responsibility when it comes to child support? |`|sBHhnDwaaa	I told my child's father that if he couldn't clean up his act and show some support, don't let the door hit his a$$ on the way out... You have to put bio father or unknown or it can turn into a huge legal mess. If you put his name, you can file for support BUT he has to sign over rights to get him/her adopted later on and can file for visitation. If you put unkown, you can NOT file for support, but new bf can adopt (and its a lot easier) and of course no visitation.    I personally am leaving him alone and putting unknown. He isn't a good influence for my son so... We have a few "uncles" to help us out.  |`|omfxPGyraa	When the father pays child support, he generally retains rights to the baby (i.e. mandatory visitation).  If you don't want him around, I would let him go!  But on the other hand, every child has a right to know and spend time with their bio father if he is reasonable, and it is a safe situation.  I would allow the bio father to be a father if he wants to, if he doesn't there is nothing wrong with asking him to help you financially even if he does not spend time with the baby.    I would not by any means allow this new guy to sign the certificate, cause honestly, only God knows how long he'll be around.  There is nothing wrong with having only one parent (you) on the certificate.  If you don't end up being with your new boyfriend forever, that will be even more detrimental on the behalf of the child, and more explaining down the line.  I would let the bio father decide what he wants to do, but I would not have the new man sign, because it's just too iffy!  I would accept him as a new boyfriend, but I would not allow him the permanence of being on the certificate unless I was married to him!  You don't have to put "unknown" on the certificate, you can just leave the fathers area blank.|`|i7TSNcvfaa	PUT CHILD SUPPORT ON HIM FOR BEING AN *** HOLE|`|AA11298562	Get his information just in case you need child support at some point, but if your boyfriend is willing to support the kid, let the father stay out of the picture.  But if your boyfriend signs the birth certificate and you need child support later, you'll have to have a DNA test to prove he's the real father.|`|pHbVh9kIaa	i think he has to pay some and you can pay some too so he won't be willing to come into your life again but if the child grows up he should know his/her real father indeed.|`|ostF23Omaa	I know this prolly wont help much but really you have to make up in your mind if you want him in your life or not. my husband and I split up for a while and we had a 10 month old lil boy. the truth of the matter is this is his child if you don't wont him in your life then you maybe he shouldn't be around. but if you and him can come to an agreement then that's between you two. I had a big problem with the fact that I would be away from my son a whole weekend for vistitaion rights, and holidaies we had to share and on his birthday. so really it just depends on what you want and how you feel about those things.  hope you make the right choice!!|`|l1SEeBuFaa	it's really not up to you...think about the baby when he/she grows up they will want to know the real daddy an wonder why their mom chose not to have anything to do with him...you should let the real dad have a part an he should want to no matter if he knew you that well or not...as for child support he knew what he was doing everyone knows how babys are born so he should know that taking care of a child requires money..also love which hopefully he wants to give...its great that your new boyfriend wants to help...but you guys just hooked up i dont mean to be rude but he could just be saying this...dont get too excited until he actually shows hes serious...raising a baby is a big responsibility which some guys just arent ready for!...Good luck and congrats on your lil one!!|`|b31af8314187604c5e012db675f766afaa	Putting another mans name on the birth certificate does not make him the father.  Sooner or later your kid's going to want to know who that person is. (It may be a necessary to know the medical history on the fathers side)    The real Father should pay child support. If the new guy marries you and wants to adopt the child then the child would be his legal son and the support would stop, but I would HIGHLY recommend waiting awhile to see if this new guy sticks around. it will prevent even more difficulties for you down the road, and when the time comes, your child will be able to understand that the new guy is adopting him (or her) because he loves them.    Good Luck.
gEfcIVzTaa	It's too early to take a test, there's not alot you can do, just wait and see if you miss your period.  There are some tests that say you can take them up to 5 days before your missed period, if you can't wait until your period maybe you should at least wait until 5 days before and take one of those.  Good luck.|`|DcLiW4bbaa	It sounds like you are just about to start your period. It's way too early for you to be getting signs of being pregnant like that. |`|lnRWjOFeaa	Its a possibility you are pregnant sometimes those tests are off, but you're probably not, i had those problems before and  it turned out i had a kidney infection, if it doesnt clear up (adn you've had your period) in two weeks go see a doctor.|`|AA11155768	Your symptoms could quite simply be from the anxiety of believing you are pregnant. It is possible to make your body exhibit signs of a pregnancy or illness through thought.

I'd suggest rules of nothing illegal, honor roll(or all B's, or whatnot), and a limit on the number of nights out a week. Or maybe to be respectful to aldults. Tell him that if he ever breaks any of these rules he'll be grounded for a year.    This way, you get what you want and he gets what he wants.|`|aa19d2e055dd84a1bbdbb32717b8c214aa	NO NO NO!

Praise her always, never tell a child she did not do good at dance.  Stop looking for bad things that she does, and look for the good things.  If you constantly give your attention on the bad things, she will continue to do bad things to seek your attention.  If I said your a bad mother, does that make you feel bad?  Probably, so imagine how she feels when have negative comments about her.  Don't rush things, shes young, enjoy her, and did I mention stop pushing her, stop forcing her to grow up so fast.

You could possibly have an incompetent cervix which means that you dilate earlier than you should.  You could have had an infection in your last pregnancy that brought on the miscarriage. Either way, the doctor should have found out why you lost your baby at 5 months so that it wouldn't happen again.|`|UaKeW6bCaa	I lost my first baby at 22 weeks so I know exactly what you felt then and are feeling now.  I lost my second baby at one day short of 28 weeks so I went through it twice.  Here's what I am going to tell you...first of all know that you are not alone.  Second of all i know this is going to sound easier than you doing it but you DO need to relax.  Pray girl..pray that whatever happens is your Higher Powers Will for you, your life and your baby.  After losing my first 2 babies I had blood tests done on them and me and found out I have a blood clotting condition that causes my babies to die in my womb....however there is treatment for me and I now 10 years later have 4 beautiful children and  5 is on the way!  Please please do NOT give up hope!  I will certainly pray for you!  Remember you are not alone and there are people out here that feel your pain and anxiety and know what you are going through.  I can't tell you your chances of losing this baby sweetie but I can tell you everything will be okay and you will get through this hard time and come out stronger.

Unfortunately every ones chances differ. some people will lose several babies before having a successful pregnancy, but for it to happen while they are that far along is not as common. However, with today's technological advances and the knowledge the Dr's. have I don't think it is likely you will have another. Please take care.                           My heart is with you.

PzW1kUhNaa	sometimes i would not get my periods for years. i'm currently 23. been married for three years and finally my husband and i started trying. of course i had to see the doc and take some medication to induce my periods to come on a regular basis, and also took some clomid to help ovulation, and an hcg shot to help even more to conceive. well, i am just about 5 weeks pregnant. although lately my pregnancy symptoms just seemed to disappear. i was able to conceive, and you should have no problems. just check out with your doc about any other hidden conditions that may prevent you from having. good luck.|`|AA11768723	The most common problem is infertility due to anovulation.

ja2UD973aa	That is really confusing.    First, $10.00 per hour is too much to be paying unless your babysitter is an adult.  I would never pay $10 an hour for teens to babysit my kids when there are adult professionals that will work for the same price.    The whole thing with discounts is strange.  It should be an affordable flat rate.  Make it easy or people will be confused and not use your service.    What's up with the meal thing?  My babysitter is always welcome to eat our food or bring their own if they have special diet needs.  I have meals prepared for my kids with instructions on how to heat it up for them.  I would never pay for a babysitter's meals.  Does your boss pay for your lunch?    I understand about the parent providing phone numbers, necessary medical info, ect.  That's just common sense.      I also understand that teens have time restrictions, but understand that it should be flexable within reason.  I cannot control the traffic and may be a few minuets past 10, and this should not be cause for concern.    As a parent, I understand the sitters in pairs thing, but it also worries me.  Two teens can distract eachother and actually cause a safety concern for the children they are supposed to be watching.      Why no kids under 18 months?  I don't get that.       You must not be a parent, because you would know that there is no way to guarentee a kid will be well behaved.  Even the best kids have bad days and a babysitter must deal with that from time to time.      And the animal thing...if you don't like the person's pet, don't babysit for them.  You can never guarentee a pet will be friendly to you, and you can't just put them out.  In many places, this can be considered animal abuse.|`|6c24bd09d5554084f9dcc2b1547b01d3aa	None of this made any sense.   Do you mean that you require 2 sitters for safety and each will be paid 5.00 an hour? If the person has only 1 or 2 children that is pretty expensive and in terms of practicality only one sitter would need to be there. I don't think it would be fair for you to require them to pay a second one simply because you don't trust the person employing you.    They shouldn't pay for your meal, although in my experience they usually provide one if you will be watching them for longer than 3 or 4 hours and a mealtime falls in that span. It shouldn't be required though.     The discount is completely confusing.     Medical Info and Emergency contacts are common sense.     Your hours are restrictive, but if you are in school, sensible. But you could extend the hours on weekends since this is most likely when you will get the most jobs anyway.     The pair thing makes no sense at all for both the previously stated reasons about cost and also because if some one was going to try to over power a young girl, he could easily over power the second just as easily. I don't really see what sort of protection it would really offer. Furthermore, it would not even be necessary if you choose your clients carefully. Stick with people you know or people who have been referred by friends.     What do you have against newborns and toddlers?   Safe is one thing, clean is another and depending on your definition have nothing to do with each other. Safety is important, and so is cleanliness. But if you are talking about there not being a reasonable household mess like toys and dishes in the sink, you may be asking too much. Also, just becasue the environment is safe and child proofed it does not mean you can ignore the kids and talk on the phone the whole time. They would still need to be closely supervised and you would need to give them your undivided attention.     I am sure people wouldn't leave you alone in the house with a viscious dog, or worse have that kind of animal around their children. It is not your place to decide whether they should be put outside. Kids act up and will be kids. It is what they do, and demanding that they be well behaved is asking way too much. Besides, that is why the parents are paying you in the first place, to make sure that they are well behaved while they aren't at home.       Personally, based on your requirements so far, I wouldn't hire you and I don't think many others would either.|`|quZGgMxZaa	It sounds pretty good to me except for the children must be well behaved.  No child is guarenteed to be well behaved esspecially when being left with a new person.  Also is that discount per sitter...meaning instead of $10 an hour it would be $6, and how honest do you plan on being.  From experience depending on the age of the child most babysitters don't have to run around much, so if you are there for more than 2 hours I would think they would get the discount.   Also if your wanting to make good money go with per kid rather than per sitter, because $10 an hour sounds like a lot for someone who isn't CPR certified or anything, also the time restriction is a little tight.   Something like $3 a child/per hour could rack up easily if your babysitting for someone with lots of kids.|`|90QhzE8haa	yeah those terms are good.. if your babysitting an elderly person in a coma.. kids dont behave.. the house will never stay clean.. and since when do sitters make five dollars an hour.. good luck with that|`|NZQ9UleVaa	When i babysat I was paid 6 dollars and hour. I was able to eat anything in their house. For example, if they ordered Pizza I was allowed to eat that because three small kids can't finish a large pizza. lol I don't understand the discount or two hour thing. I usually babysat for 4 to 6 hours at a time and I watched three kids. If an asthma attack would have occurred I would have called 911 then the parents or if the kid had medication I would have just given it to him. Usually parent's provide a number in case something goes wrong. Like the cell phone number or the number of the restaurant.    Lots of times kids don't behave especially if its a new babysitter that they don't know. They like to test her to see what she will let them get away with.|`|Hhk78c5Gaa	1. Babysitting prices have gone up since I babysat. Except for New Years Eve, I got about $3 an hour, regardless of how many kids there were.  2. I took a class when I was 10, and started babysitting after that.  3. I don't see why 2 14 year olds couldn't handle a baby together. One might be a concern, but not 2.  4. I wouldn't give those rules to the parents. They seem pretty demanding.They won't have you babysit again. They just want someone to watch their kids while they're gone.
CZsjZCzVaa	You should call your dr. and let him/her know whats going on. You can take Robitussin (not sure if spelled right) plain which might help, I had the same thing in my 34th week and nothing was wrong but the dr was concerned about me being able to rest up. Hope you feel better.|`|mYp3SSxkaa	It does not sound silly at all! If you are coughing up blood, even a tiny bit, don't wait until Thursday to see your doctor - go now!!
9kPPmazoaa	I work at a academy that is  K-12 (although I am on maternity leave right now). My daughter will be attending there. Its a college prep school and its very hard to get into.... but since I work there she will be able to get in without having to go on a waiting list, thank goodness. She's only 9 weeks now. But that's "one" of my main reasons for keeping my job is because it will get her in the door. If at some point in time I quit my job and become a SAHM (very possible)before she starts school. Then I guess I'll just put her on the waiting list (since I worked there 9 times out 10 she'll still get in). But as of "right now" thats where we plan on her going. If we change our minds in future (possible),or we end up selling the house and moving... We still will more than likely put her in a academy.Or at least a small(er) school of some sort.    ***I've always attended small schools either Private Christian Schools or Academy's. I'm not a huge fan of public schools.For no major reason I just like smaller schools...with a better student-teacher ratio.|`|nfzQkvqraa	We live in a very good school district.

That may be a public school or may not be.  I like the public schools where I am and my kids have done well, so there's no problem.  I don't think that just because a school is "private" that it is necessarily better.  Also, I think homeschooling is a great option for some families.  We actually tried it for a short while and even though it didn't work out for us, I can see how some families may find it the perfect choice.|`|B9KwqnuDaa	My children will be either community unschooled or be going to a waldorf, montessori or sudbury school.|`|1L1AxWoXaa	I would as long it was not a religious affiliated school. I like the idea of the Military School. I think it teaches discipline as long as they didn't take it too far. My daughter is in a good school district now but public schools do have limitations.    Juicy, I grew up in PG County. DC and PG schools are horrible! I moved from the area mainly because I did not want my kids going to school there.|`|PFO1jxZGaa	Mine are going to public but if I could I most likely would put them in a private school for middle and high school.. I wouldnt pick a religious school or even a military school.  My husband went to military school in elementary but was actually kicked out due to behavioral problems in the fifth grade :)  His brother who also went has been in the navy for 15 years and his cousin in jail for 10.. so anything can happen :)|`|IngripgMaa	Public school for Elementary.  Middle and Highschool...I'm going to do Private most likely.|`|HzkRpjhEaa	If money were not an issue, I would let my kids pick betwen private school and homeschooling.  There are very few public schools that I have seen that I thought actually taught the kids anything at all, so unless I just got really lucky and found a very unique public school, I would hate to send my kids to one.  I've been considering military school, though I don't feel that I know enough about it yet.  And if I did private school, I would send them to a religious one.  Homeschooling I know from experience to be excellent.  Many colleges are now realizing that kids who were homeschooled often get better grades, and so they're beginning to specifically seak them out.|`|dp7VR8BJaa	The public schools in my area are really good comparitvely, but I still am umimpressed by the public school system in general.  I am planning on homeschooling Aaron for through 3rd grade and maybe possbily till he enters middle school.  I don't think I will know for sure until we start.|`|AA11707745	I'm still kind of undecided on this. I've come across a few really good options as of late, but what I've come up with so far is   un-schooling until at least 6th grade. Then homeschooled through a hands-on type school(so they still have the option of going). High school seems too far off to think about...she's only 3! lol.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	I would choose Private school.No school in the town I live in is good.We have public,Private and military school but that's more for troubled kids and teens.But the Private ones would be the best choose.I might move before my kids start real school.|`|eF6HTt0gaa	When I was in School it was pretty decent but now that I have graduation its majorly changed from the small school it was. I have no problems with the schools my girls are in now, but from working with local kids in the area and go to the HS around here I honestly dont know what to think. I say if your not happy look in to sending him to a private school other wise we gotta deal with what we can afford.|`|AA11481889	Every school is different and it is possible to find public school that are great...but the fact of the matter is...since the public education system is not a priority of our government as of late...the public school system is suffering.    I think each and every school needs to be ranked for it's own quality...rather than lumped up just because it's "private" or "public"...that being said...so do private schools.    The two perks I see with Private school...is since it's private, they don't have to stick strictly to the guidelines that state funded public schools do...So I would tend to opt for a religious private school since I'm a little more on the conservative side than most.    AND since they are private they are not governed by the public, they have a broader range of what they can offer.  And since they have access to funding from private parties, they have access to more than public schools do....from raw materials like computers all the way up to what kind of educational field trips they can take.      So if it were me, and money was no object, I'd have to research all the schools in the area...but I'd probably side with private simply for the freedoms and funding that private ownership provides.|`|VwMkiLFPaa	I dont know..    I went to a public school my entire childhood. My sister went to a both public and private school. She went off to public first and HATED IT. She said she wasnt challenged enough and all the kids around her were idiots. LOL. So for high school, she went to a very expensive private school. However, we BOTH went off to college because our parents raised us that way. Not because of the high schools we went too.  I got good grades in high school (As and Bs) and same for college. I have an Associates degree and Im just a wee bit away from my Bachelors. (Money has held me back because I cant afford my student loan as it is). But honestly, if money WERE no object, Id be in college forever. I love it! My sister has gone on and worked up to her Masters Degree. She always made honor roll and shes like a genius. But her debt from student loans is unreal. And she often wonders if she made the right choice in going for her Masters.     I have a decent paying job. I do well for myself, for my age. I know I could make more money, possibly elsewhere, but I tay here due to the flexibility with my son and because right now the economy sucks. There is room for me to grow in this company but Im thankful for what Ive already learned from them. So I use them as my stepping stone for now.    My sister has changed jobs more than I can even count. Shes done very well for herself at each of these jobs but its like nothing is ever good enough for her. She makes a decent salary but everything in life has been work, work, work. Starting back in high school. Which is great, but she almost regrets being close to 30 with no boyfriend, none in sight, and no children.     I went to a great high school. I learned a lot and let a lot of good people. And the teachers at this school genuinely care for the students as opposed to collecting a paycheck. And at her high school, it was a boarding school, they had tons of international students. Teachers would come and go.     So I guess its all in the experience youre looking for. Either way, whatever school you go to, YOU as the parent have to push your child to be their best. Im sure it helps if the school of choice is a great one, but in my high school, it wasnt the school I went to that made me who I am but the teachers that taught lifelong lessons.    Just my takesorry its a novel.|`|TQW5E6olaa	Since money doesn't matter, Private. They are educationally superior. I'm looking to send Bella to the same one I went to.

If money were not an object, I would absolutely enroll my kids in private school. I'm not too crazy about the idea of military school - while I highly respect the military I'm definitely concerned about my child later on becoming an adult and going to war. But my husband is an Afghanistan vet, his brother is a Desert Storm vet, and his father is a Vietnam vet - so in their family it's very honorable to join the military. If my son chose to do that, I'm sure my husband and I would be at odds but I'd try to understand.|`|AA11210211	I think public schools are good at least were we live and I have also thought about a military academy if they decide they want to go to one,I think my son may want to there is a long line of military men on both sides of the family so he may want to continue the tradition.|`|AkFag8tNaa	We moved for our school basically.

Everybody I graduated with went into a university some where or into the local R.N. program. Others did drugs and dropped out.         I do think that if you aren't impressed with your public school, that private schools are great. You child still gets interaction with other children like a public school. It is a smaller school so there is more one-on-one time for learning too. May be expensive but worth it if you don't wanna go public.  Im doing public but only because the schools here are awesome. So glad that is years down the road.|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	I went to an inner city school and managed to get a really good education.  I was always in the 90th percentile and up in testing, I did well on my ACTs and I graduated with Honors.  At the same time, my husband went to a different inner city school and had his shoes stolen, guns fired in the middle of class, bricks thrown at him and his brothers.  It was bad.  So, really, I guess it just depends on the school, but I say go with public.

That way he'll be a little older and enjoy all the different animals!     Whatever you decide to do, I'm sure it'll be adorable. BTW, I think its cute that you're doing a party for his first bday. Everyone in my family laughs because I'm already thinking about Chloe's bday (she's only 5 months old) They tell me she won't remember... But I will! :) Best of luck!|`|nCKdkYSyaa	My daughters was flowers and butterflies, So I don't think that would work for your little man :) lol but here are some suggestions on themes maybe they will spark some ideas for you! Good luck and have fun :)    Themes:  Construction/Tonka trucks  Sports  Sesame street  Blues Clues  Instead of princess you could do a "Prince"  Race cars  Winnie the pooh  Dinosaurs  Finding nemo  Jungle animals  Action figures, like spiderman ect ect (might be too old for a 1 yr old party though)    And Noahs ark isnt too cheesy, It is a little "iffy though" It would like me doing a Hannah montanna party LOL NO THANKS!|`|jTM6Upm5aa	Winnie the Pooh, ( first child). Thomas the Tank Engine, ( second child)|`|6gLSicSaaa	I used carebears and then just ballons and color cordenatided streames and I got banners and I got palce mats and paltes ect, I thought it was cute, Noahs ark is cute!

Let me know what u choose!|`|qymhoXInaa	I did Elmo for my daughter because she was obbessed and did a water theme for my son because my Mom got him a water table and we got him a big blow up pool (the kind with all the toys attached and sections to it...shallow but had lots of accessorys)    Pokka dots sounds cute!|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	We are having a jungle animal theme for Connor.     Aidan's was Elmo (he was obsessed w/ Elmo at the time).|`|AA11210211	We did rainbow colored polka dots,my inspiration for it was from one of my daughters dresses that is rainbow polka dots which she wore that day,I got the funfetti cake mix and icing,and then did random colored plates,bowls,spoons,balloons ETC it was cute she turned 1yr on saturday.    Oh and my son's first was Spiderman,he is obsessed with Spiderman!! lol|`|aJLx0nhNaa	He's not one yet, but I think the theme is going to be "baby gets his own cake, mama gets her own bottle of wine."  It's been a big year for me too!    If you think Noah's Ark is too cheesy, why not have a theme of "baby animals."  Everybody loves baby animals.|`|WlU3NFu6aa	noahs ark would be cute!  here are some theme ideas that arent the usual character ones.  http://www.birthdaydirect.com/shop-1st-b...    my daugher's was butterflies and daisies. not the normal winnie the pooh, princess or precious moments but it wont work for Noah!|`|xXnFx6qLaa	Decorations...  http://i40.tinypic.com/2dqkhnd.jpg    Eating his cake......  http://i44.tinypic.com/jv4rpv.jpg    His birthday hat........  http://i41.tinypic.com/24gm1s3.jpg|`|mjlhZAVxaa	He isn't one yet, but since Elijah was born on St. Patrick's Day we have to do the St. Paddy's Day theme ;)  I just ordered his shamrock invitations and we are getting a leprechaun to preform tricks and dances, hahaha!!!!

Just invited grandma and grandpa and one aunt (the rest of the family lived too far away) for cake and ice cream and a few gifts.

We had a good time though and next year I will make sure to have it look more themeish. I had his party at the local park. IT was very nice out that day. I also took an extra outfit and a bunch of wash clothes to clean him off and change him after the cake.     He is just too cute here to not add it too.  http://i254.photobucket.com/albums/hh105...|`|1270a2c558de1c5ce444bf6f3447f4beaa	My son will be one in June.  I plan to do a prince theme!  I already found a little crown for him to wear from carters, and the theme kind of built out of that.  Here's where I found the theme supplies.....    http://www.1stwishes.com/Lil-Prince-1st-...    I won't be buying a kit, or everything available....but I plan to buy enough to make it work for me.  I LOVE their personalized banners, which I'm getting as well.  The banner will be just a plain balloons theme though so I can use it multiple years, with just his name on it.    Good luck!!|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	My son LOVES giraffes, so we did a jungle theme.  It was pretty simple, party hats, banners, plates and napkins.  But, it made it special because he was excited and kept saying, "Giraffe?  Giraffe!  Giraffe?"|`|DNygQdmVaa	I didn really have  a theme, he wont know the difference anyways.

Q5Ub5LBGaa	usually it is about a month. you may want to replace your box of cereal, because the vitamins etc may have degraded, as well as the food quality from humidity/light or what not.|`|pvH3oHRfaa	Most cereal I've had says that it stays fresh for 3-4 weeks, or 28 days. It should tell you on the back of the packet. If in doubt, just buy some fresh.|`|iOYCCaoYaa	I would say after 30 days unless it was in a Ziploc bag.
be5076c0b98b495ffe00aade08f96b65aa	Are you trying to get pregnant or are you pregnant. If your trying, then I would say feeling bloated has nothing to do with conception. If your pregnant, it's nothing unusual. Some women hurt or burn, others may feel bloated. If your pregnant, and you begin to experience severe pain or bleeding with the bloating, I would definitely give my doc a call.     If you are pregnant I wouldn't make a special call or visit to my doc, but I would bring it up at the next appointment for peace of mind.|`|7AYnWg3paa	well since u cant get pregnant in a day..um the answer is no...if u are saying if u might already be preggo and get bloated after sex.....well no thats not a symptom either....being bloated is a symptom of pregnancy....but not just after sex..usually mostly everyday 70% of the day|`|uuceuyRyaa	It's prolly normal...

xZWP2mqjaa	Well. I thought my m-i-l was bad. She was similar to yours in the way she expects me to leave my son with her or she can have him anytime she wants but thats only because her own daughter did that. SHe didn't like it when I stood up to her and refused to leave my child with her.  You're in a bit of a no-win situation. If you refuse to go then your husband feels torn between you and his mother (and I know EXACTLY what that's like) or your f-i-l, who you do get on with (same here) misses ou on seeing his son and potentially his new grandchild.  I know its not easy but I think you have to stand your ground and tell your husband that until his mother treats you with an ounce of respect then you will not be visiting with them. And whycan't his ex-wife drop the kids off and then leave instead of filling her head with stories. it's obviously jealousy on her part.  You really have to be strong and take the high road. Spell it out for hubby and stick to your guns. Don't do what I did though and end up in a massive argument with her in front of the rest of the family and then walk out, because you will always then be the ***** - and it's not worth the hassle.  You look after number one and your soon to be baby. You don't need the stress.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	honestly, if she were that mean i wold say something with a laugh like " oh, i'm sorry you thought i would trust YOU with MY children" no thanks i don't need someone poisoning their mind.     Just prove her wrong|`|koENUKhFaa	The difficult mother in law... What can I say. I suggest that you learn to ignore her and let your husband deal with her. And spend more time with your father in law who u think is a wonderful man. Remember to do this for your hubby. COz' he will appreciate you more. He wants to visit his father who is ill. So I suggest that since his father is ill, visiting his father takes precedence over you being angry with your MIL.     Just learn to smile and ignore your MIL. And if u need to vent your frustrations, just ***** about her to your friends and your family members. And be happy. you are pregnant. So don't let your MIL make you upset. Its not worth it.|`|AA10390690	i understand how you feel to a certain extent. my boyfriend's mother && i sure have had our differences. we would argue a lot over STUPID crap && the majority was during pregnancy. it eventually got to the point of where i just cut off communication && when i did that she didn't see my daughter for a good chunk of her life. i have "made" mends with her but still don't trust her but for the sake of my boyfriend i have made things civil again. best thing i did was just stop talking and lived my own life. goodluck =]|`|j083iujcaa	maybe you can encourage him to do Saturday morning breakfasts with his dad and sisters. while you stay home and rest. he must know that you don't get along very well with the MIL, so just tell him you are tired of putting up with her and you will be happy to go with him to visit again once she can be civil.  she also may not realize that if she is rude to the mommy, that will probably have an effect on how often she gets to see her grandson|`|28fNd725aa	Wow... I can really relate to your problem.  My 1st MIL was the same way with the comments only when it was she and I but if I would call her on it,,, well that's not how she meant it, or whatever!  You are really in a bad place with your DH dad being in such poor condition health wise.... I think the sisters could come out with you all, like pick em up and go do something to spend time with each other.  But with dad's poor health that's hard.  If he's comfortable with you staying home that is def what I would do... And Im sure if he explains it to his dad he would understand.  Remember dad's been dealing with the crazy lady for a lot of years!!  Good Luck!!!|`|AA12107422	Ah, the infamous evil mother in law. Seems as though she is really just unhappy with herself & she is pushing her crappiness onto everyone around her. I can't agree, that she may still be bitter to the fact that the ex-wife is very irresponsible for your step-children, but that is beyond your control. She shouldn't go around putting you in the same category as the ex & saying harsh things, like you will not be able to 'handle' being a mother. Maybe she can't handle being a good mother in law!  If she is treating you like crap, I don't blame you one bit for standing up for yourself! Somethings got to give. I would let her know now - if she wants anything to do with this grandson, that she will start treating with you some respect!! If she has any sense, she will quit being so ugly! Just because she is your husbands mother, doesn't give her ANY right to be so dang mean! I mean, shes pretty ballsy to get a hormonal pregnant woman worked up, lol. My mother in law is slightly like this, just not as bad, & I finally got the nerve to speak up & now things have simmered down & she knows when to pipe down when around me! Congrats on the baby & Good Luck ?|`|h7McguHGaa	I'm very glad you don't just sit there when your mother-in-law makes nasty remarks.  At least you have the guts to say something back to her.  With that in mind, maybe you should straight up ask her why she feels the need to speak to you that way and what you have done to deserve it.  Maybe she just needs to get something off her chest.  If that doesn't help, your husband should definitely put a stop to it.|`|a3MSSvdcaa	Well here's what I would do:    Obviously the Father in Law is much better to deal with and if he's in poor health, I can understand why you'd want to spend time with him.  Stick it out until he gets better or, not to sound grim, but passes away.  He should be a part of this new baby's life even if the MIL is evil.  And discuss ahead of time what will be going on with your husband.  Try to never let him leave your side while your there.  If he knows he's going to be doing something else and can't be by your side, stay home.  If the MIL starts making nasty comments, say things like "Your entitled to your opinion" or things like that.  She knows she's getting a rise out of you and that's why she antagonizes probably.|`|tu7aqUoxaa	when he goes to visit, stay home rather than being stressed out with that lady. My mother in law is the same, but she is stressing me about rent and her son is not working. I'm 16 weeks and still working trying to pay rent and bills. I'm thinking about leaving him|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	Maybe you should try talking to her when you are not angry. When she isn't making hurtful comments. Just pick a day to go over there and sit down and tell her that what she says hurts your feelings. That you are not like his ex wife and you don't appreciate her saying those things to you. But you need to do it when you aren't angry. You both takgin "shots" at each other, will never get anything resolved. Just tell her that you want a good relationship with her and things are not going the way you had hoped. Be the bigger person, even if you feel it is all her fault, take some of the blame so it isn't like you are accusing her of anything. If she still refuses to be nice and makes these nasty comments, then I would just stop going over there. Let your husband go anytime he wants (dont give him any greif about wanting to go, it is his mother) just stay at home. Or go but avoid her as much as you can. She obviously has a chip on her shoulder about the ex and she needs to move on. Good Luck!!!|`|PFO1jxZGaa	My mil told my husband when I was pregnant with number two that either I need to get my tubes tied or he needs a vasectomy. That we have no business having any more kids. She doent care about me too much either ( that was not the only comment she has made over the years) . I was really upset at first but in time I just learn to let it go. If she wants to be that bitter then I'll just raise above it, what ever.   I know its hard but just ignore her, dont get into a big fight with her because she will only drag your husband in the middle and trust me he does not want that position ( happened to me...) and its not really even fair for him. Of course he should say something to her too, like what my husband said that she just needs to learn to deal with the fact that i'm his wife and even if for some reason we would ever brake up I was still the mother of her grandkids and for that reason only she needs to be respectful to me ( and me to her too) She has backed off a little but I still wont visit her. Maybe you should just stay home for a while when he goes to see them.   Oh, and we have three kids now :)|`|CY8jAXPDaa	I know exactly what you mean. My MIL is an absolute .. well..  Shes done some horrid things, shes had me in tears whilst pregnant, shes even been willing to keep me in danger just for her own sake whilst i was pregnant, on a horrid holiday and there was a risk of my pregnancy, yet she refused to help "because i was ungrateful"   Shes evil.   Shes proper interfering, never leaves us alone.    To be honest, all i did was stuck up for myself and after that she shut up. I've told her to stop interfering and to keep her mouth shut.  We now visit again and she sucks up to me big time.   Esp because at one point i stopped my son from seeing her as all her crap had made me feel she just didn't care about anyone but herself, i didn't want my son around her.   She was practically begging in the end.   You just need to let her know what she is doing is wrong, and you will blow one day, and she will end up missing out.     Sorry you also have to put up with one.|`|bAp35x7uaa	I'm so sorry that you appear to have the mother-in-law from hell.    There could be a couple of reasons for her behaviour:    One is that she's an old bag and she's liable to stay an old bag.     Two is that she may be very unsettled by her husband's ill health?  Which may make her grumpy and irritable?      Your hubby seems to see exactly what is going on - which is one very positive step in the right direction.  So, my advice is to take a deep breath and be the bigger person.     Take your mother in law to one side and tell her you really want her to be part of this child's life and where exactly does her problem with you lie.  Be calm, be rational but pin her down.  What exactly is her problem.  You may just find she's a very scared woman, terrified about a future without her husband and taking it out on you.    Then you can very gently reassure her that you and your hubby - and the child to be - very much want her to be a part of your family and that if she is worried at all about anything she can come and talk to you - but she needs to drop the attitude as it makes it very difficult.    I hope this works for you.  Sometimes people need to be spoken to calmly about their bad behaviour in order to recognise whatt hey're doing.    Alternatively, she may just be a rotten old bag, in which case there isn't a lot you can do, other than bite your tongue, smile sweetly and only see her when absolutely necessary.    Good luck xxx|`|9P26sacKaa	Yep.  My step-mother-in-law was very much like this up until I actually had a kid and apparently "proved" myself.  It was odd.  She was a totally horrible person until that happened.  Then she (mostly) changed her tune.  That didn't change the fact that I had to deal with her horrible comments and attitude and letters for 5 years.  My situation was slightly different here because the only person who could have stood up for me beside myself was my father-in-law, who had no spine whatsoever and lied to her all the time.  This only exacerbated everything, and my husband never got along with her either, so it was pretty messy.    What I ended up doing was not taking any crap at all.  I replied to all of her negative comments in kind and replied to her letters without backing down in the slightest.  My FIL was pretty upset about the whole ordeal because we couldn't even be in the same room with each other unless it was a big family gathering and we could easily ignore each other.  I wouldn't recommend this particular path unless you're really ready to be one of two instigators that are looked at as stubborn and unwilling to cooperate and are always causing problems and negativity.  This really isn't a good way to go about handling such a situation and I wouldn't do it like this if I were still dealing with her like this.    If I were you, with my husband being biologically related to the MIL and with him being a good enough husband to stand up for me, I'd do what you've done already... I'd have him tell her flat out that she will respect his wife.  If she can't, then she won't be seeing said wife or the new baby until said wife approves.  After all, wife and husband will not deal with abuse and new baby will be with wife for a long time after birth... maybe a few years.  Then go through with it.  Don't let her weasle her way into seeing the baby or you until she can literally apologize for her behavior and be civil.      If you must see her or talk with her, do not tolerate her negative comments at all.  When she says something negative or insulting, simply leave.  End the conversation or leave the house right then.  No if's, and's, or but's about it.  End of visit/conversation.  Don't give her the pleasure of showing her your negative side by playing tit-for-tat or even defending yourself... after all, she's likely to use it against you or judge you based on seeing it.  You do not need to prove yourself to her, and she probably would not be easily shown your worth.  The trick about this is that you need to physically leave, with the car, with or without your husband.  After all, if he leaves you in the car after you've left an abusive situation, he is supporting the abuse.  He needs to be 100% supportive of you, and if you have to leave, he should leave too.  This doesn't mean he can't go visit without you sometimes, but if you're going with and something abusive happens to you, he needs to take you away from there.      He and his family would quickly become upset with your MIL for ruining all the family gatherings and would try to change her behavior or arrange something more positive.  It's important if you are going to do this - leaving her home or family gatherings with your husband when she is abusive, that you build a certain level of tolerance.  After all, she is probably negative all the time and you can't just leave every time she says something negative towards you or anyone else.  You would have to work out a certain level at which you cannot simply change the subject, ignore her completely and peacefully, or reply with something the addresses her concerns but doesn't escalate the situation.  It sounds like you're already doing this to some extent.      When she says something directly insulting to you like her"you're not the kind of person that will be able to handle being a mother," that's when you go tell your husband that his mother just told you xyz and you're now leaving and won't be back until she apologizes for it.  Make her apologize.  Make sure everyone knows what she said and what she needs to do to make it better.  You didn't do anything wrong and you do not need to make ammends for her abuse.  She might be able to abuse her husband or her children, but you're not going to allow it to happen to you or to your children.      I guess I don't understand why you can't avoid going over there.  Your husband can certainly go without you and you can certainly do things by yourself or with your friends or family.  Not going with him is perfectly fine and acceptable, but sitting in the care, in my opinion, is not.  I would not put up with my husband making me sit in the car.  He would have to drop me off at home or at a book store or some other place I wanted to be.  I wouldn't let his family think I was moping around in the car while they hang out.  I would have my husband tell his family that I can't come over until his mother apologizes for her abusive behavior (using those words) and that I wi|`|uugMjx9yaa	i think that she just wants to get to you  you shouldnt let those things matter to you i know is hard  but the more meaner she is to you the nicer you should be to here  that is the best revenge for an enemy    once she sees her grandson hopefully things would be better\  good luck|`|axR8BOdpaa	It sounds like she has issues with the ex wife...and she is projecting them on to you. The last thing you need now is stress. Tell you hubby to spend time with his dad without you. Maybe his dad can come to your house and leave the bat at home.
aba81bf0dd1e368904161a0c15faf44caa	My son is 8 months old, and has been eating solids since he was six months (he's still breastfed too).  Since we started him on solids, they have been pasty (like play-dough consistency, maybe a little less thick) and mostly orangy to brown in color - he eats lots of carrots and sweet potatoes though, so that may account for the color.    Smell wise, it smells like grown-up poo.    Hope this helps!!!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Wow, that's really tough.  It's not that I'm adverse to taking a picture of my baby's poop for you, I'd totally do it if I thought it would help.  It's just that his poop is *always different.*  Sometimes yellow and runny, sometimes a big green ball, a few times it's even been blue.  I'm not sure how you're supposed to treat your baby using this as an indicator.|`|X6as2nOAaa	well I have a 6 month old and she is on formula and eats solids so her poo varies but normally it looks like paste like it is thicker and dark in color and is not runny anymore.|`|3MelQFxOaa	Usually a regular bowel movement is suppose to be a mustrad yellow color if he is on formula, and generally no smell to it. It's texture reminds me a little of wet sand, I dont know if that helps, and I can not give you a picture because my baby is eating foods, so the color is always different. If you still wanted on, though, let me know, and I can take a picture for you tonight. I am sorry about all of this trouble and I wish you and your child the best of luck!|`|HXfHkoSHaa	I don't have a photo, but my bottle fed son is 4 months.  His poos are usually a green/yellow/brown color.  The brown just started after I introduced some solids.  They smell as ripe as they look, and are usually a thick pasty consistency.  Hope this helps a little.|`|OHq5gSjJaa	Well...  my 7 month old already did her poopoo today so I don't have a pic...  But I have changed a lot of diapers since I have a daycare.      Normal has a lot of varriance to it.  Consistency is still fairly soft at this age...  peanut butter ish, or looser, usually.  But sometimes there is a bit of a firmer turd (sorry to be gross) surrounded by looser stuff.  I would never really describe them as greasy though, which it sounds like might have been do to the pancreas condition.  Color can be anywhere from pale yellow to dark greenish.  Sometimes even orange depending on what they ate.|`|b3892e48ce1ff2d86e671ceef5fd7a83aa	I apologize in advance. These are pictures of poopy diapers, not for the squeamish. You didn't mention whether your son is breastfed or formula fed? This is a breastfed baby:    http://images.google.ca/imgres?imgurl=ht...|`|lGrcLQ49aa	That is a tough one because babies differ. A baby that is breastfed will have different bowel movements depending on what mom is eating. It can also differ at this age because they are starting to try new foods. And differences appear depending on if a child is not feeling well.      You should ask your doctor for more clarification on this.      PS - My husband was born with an underdeveloped pancreas and was on insulin for 18 months - but that was almost 40 years ago.|`|WIdhBSimaa	UMMMM NO I DONT HAVE 1|`|y6Knp2elaa	When baby is breast fed  Consistency: Soft or runny.  Color: Yellow mustard to orange with little white flecks that look like seeds.    When baby is formula fed  Consistency: Soft paste.  Color: Grayish green, yellow, tan or brown, depending on the type of formula.    When baby is eating solid food   Cosistency: Paste to formed stools. Often contains undigested food.  Color: Can vary depending on what is eaten.
SlBsJ3NRaa	Can you maybe go walk around the mall or somewhere warm? If you can't, and he's bundled, like think onesie, sleeper, regular long outfit, then snowsuit, plus a blanket shielding the wind from his face, I say yeah. My kids get cabin fever and start bouncing off the walls if they are cooped up too long. We try to go somwhere at least once or twice a week, even if it's just a short walk up and down the street a few times.|`|215dfe0c283eb141a2ed0b4dcb32274caa	If it even reached 20 degrees outside we are out immediately. 20 degrees is a very mild day where I am from, so we take advantage of these days and play outside for a half hour at time, go in and warm up and then head back out for another half an hour. If you are not used to the cold then it will probably be too uncomfortable for him to be out in the cold. Maybe do something else to get out of the house, go to a museum or a indoor play area for awhile.|`|mbh3eex7aa	I don't think you should have a kid out when it is that cold. Maybe take them to a mall (especially if they have a play area) and just let them play or walk around the mall to get them out of the house and to get them some excerise.|`|3S0WRhWCaa	I would find an indoor area to go.|`|xue72D76aa	I think you can go either way on this.  You can either bundle him up really well and go for a short walk or you can find some physical activities you can do.  You can do some activities in the house or you can head out to the shopping center and get some activity there.  I'd say to do what you're comfortable with.|`|kv8ZFPP1aa	i wouldn't because most likely they'll start complaining about the cold as soon as you get around the block. just occupy his time inside the house with games and books.|`|hJoB7VR1aa	25 degrees is way to cold for a 1 year old to be outside for an extended period of time. My daughter is 4 and I won't let her go out. I just make sure that we play physical games in the house.    We toss a ball back and forth. She has a rubber hop scotch pad we play with. And we dance and jump around. If you and your baby are just getting cabin fever go out to the store and out to eat.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	no i wouldn't. i feel bad because my daughter and i are shut up in the house.. this winter has been horrible and has not given us much chances to get out and play so i have been talking her to the mall and walking around for a little while there.|`|7bTOY5vHaa	Take him to the mall and walk around, our mall has a little playground in it.|`|DNygQdmVaa	bundle them up and go for it.  just a short walk though.
AQkfW704aa	I suppose your body is preparing to give birth as you would technically be considered to be almost term. Tightening of your abdomen could be the beginnings of labour there is a term used for it called Braxton Hicks named after the doctor who first described them. They are not real labour pains but call them practice. I think you need to speak with your midwife about the swollen feet and the vaginal discharge.
sBHhnDwaaa	You'll know when you're having contractions. (Evidently early labor ones aren't near as bad as active labor ones..... Who knows? Who cares? Just get him out or up off my hips PLEASE...)    I love the "morning' sickness, and that its gone around 12 weeks (WRONG, all day for almost 1/2 the second trimester!!)|`|lQOO36j4aa	my ex boyfriend told me that when his mum was giving birth naturally he bump is head on the way out and had a little lump on his head.|`|qKPyalg6aa	My karate instructor told me, as he was doing a kata, that, "Morning sickness lasts 3 months, minimum." I was a little shocked, but I had to laugh, because he was doing these punches, and kicks while he was telling me.|`|KWJ7ju6qaa	That the first couple months you don't even know you're pregnant...boy I knew!!!
bxlYleZkaa	Yes, there is a slim chance you could get pregnant that way and yes you could, more easily, also get a transmittable disease.|`|4PK0hiWeaa	You could if he still has sperm on his hands.  But if he just cleans it off with a towel or tissue then i REALLY doubt you could get pregnant and such a slim chance of catching std. Tell him to wash hands of you want to be sure, or use an untainted hand.|`|2zU7MS4raa	Yes, but only if HE has an STD as well. I learned that in my Health class a few months back. I am in 8th grade.|`|EvRIwz4Laa	you could get pregnant and you could get an STD. However it is very unlikely that you would get pregnant BUT many STDs are easily passed and penetration is not necessary like HPV and herpes. Its probably best that you and your boyfriend get tested, then you would not have to worry about STDs|`|mhSjwuntaa	you could get pregnant...but very unlikely. You could get an STD from him touching himself then touching you only if he has an STD. Sometimes people don't even know they have a STD's so I wouldn't just take his word for it.|`|4yGGjs7zaa	yes to geting an std, unlikely pregnant
XG0EljaKaa	thats common during pregnancy! im 11weeks pregnant and ive has simlar things happen. good luck!|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	I had bleeding when I was 12 weeks after exercising and went to the ER. They saw that my placenta was laying on my cervix (placenta previa). I couldn't have sex for a month, no orgasm (it causes your uterus to contract), no lifting, or exercise. My placenta eventually moved up to the baby and everything is fine. Go to your doctor and say you have spotting after sex and they will give you an ultrasound to make sure everything is fine.
kTXJD0Gfaa	Even though I'm pretty sure everyone thinks that she shouldn't keep the baby, I think that even if she doesn't have the custody she should at least have contact with him/her (under supervision, obviously!). The reason why I say this, its because everyone deserves to know who they came from and the only way for this kid to be emotionally stable is by knowing that his mom didn't give up on him.|`|ev8ZZYx2aa	If she has been doing drugs during the pregnancy the likelihood that her baby is going to come out perfect and happy is very slim. Personally I don't think that mothers who do drugs when pregnant should be able to keep their children. Most people do drugs to help them escape from reality. Let me tell you if you have ever heard a baby cry who is going through detox - it is not pleasant and could lead the mother to keep doing drugs. These babies are very hard to care for and need a lot of attention and patience's|`|C8wvNKKKaa	I just saw at10:45 p.m. on a show with Martin Beecher and she stated that she was going to give the child up.     Social workers are aware because her 4 year old daughter had been heroin addicted due to being introduced to heroin while in her mothers womb.    The lady does not have custody of her 4 year old daughter.  The 4 year old girls grandma is her guardian.    Heroine, crack, meth, cocaine, prescribed medication are all highly addictive.    People get grossed out if hair is in their food or the worker did not properly wash their hands before handling the food, etc.....    But a heroin, cocaine or meth addicted  person will shoot up a drug, and they have no clue who, when, where and what that drug has in it.      Pharmacy's in the USA  are about the best chance we have of getting the actual drug that was prescribed.    Buying medication in Mexico or online is another risk.    Addicts break down pills by cutting and smashing them into powder. After that water is added to make it a liquid.  The addicts don't realize that pharmaceutical drugs have fillers in them and when that gets to their lungs and into their bloodstream, it is a tragedy.|`|sAbah6dTaa	no... i don't think most people could/can come clean, it would be best to take the baby now so that she can't do any damage or worse kill the baby while it's young... terrible thing i know, but i'm sure it happens a lot now days!!|`|xGHqfTUoaa	"You have beautiful eyes young lady would you like to go out on a date sometime?  I can promise you the moon and the stars you know I just got this new leather jacket and I got my ear pierced- Piercing Pagoda does a good job you gotta eat Smith's hotdogs with the skin, it's got that bit to it.  I got Pall Malls, Marlboro's, Camels...I go to Dees Cigar Store man they got good BOGOs, you know BOGOs?  Smokin' and jokin' man, everyone's having a good time..."    I have very mixed feelings on this topic.  Honestly, if addicted/alcoholic mothers were forced to have abortions, I would not be alive today.  My mom drank like a fish while pregnant with me, and I turned out just fine ::groan::    I think a more sensible option would be to have more funding available to help pregnant mothers get clean throughout their pregnancy, and abolish their fear of asking for help.      Sensible, but probably not realistic.    The sad thing is, even if her baby was taken away, she would probably get pregnant again.    I dunno.  Messed up situation, but I've seen babies in crackhouses screaming for food while their moms hit that pipe.  I'm sure my own son has spent time wondering if he'd ever see his mom again.  I have to wonder...    Oh f*ck it, shutting up now.    How'd ya like my online Brak impression?    EDIT- realizing now that nobody except Fleur de lis and I would have any clue what I'm talking about.    Sorry.|`|nxg5drvNaa	pardon me for my answer as i may receive some thumbs down, but I am very opinionated when it comes to the welfare of a child or unborn child... To me, when one becomes pregnant she should begin putting her child first. She made the decision to get pregnant whether it was accidental or purposely, regardless she obviously wasnt doing everything she could to prevent the situation. So being that she made this baby, she should begin taking care of it properly even before the baby is born. Every child has the right to live a fulfilling life, and every mother in my opinion should do what they can to provide that for their child. I believe this child should be taken away because of the selfish acts of the mother. A baby is not asked to be brough into this world, but it happens...that being said, a mother (this one and ones like it inparticular) should take care of their responsiblities and grow up! I hate stories like this....To me, its horrible what these poor children have to go through because some mothers cant become responsible and do the right thing! The baby belongs with a family who can take care of him/her properly and at this point, I dont think the mother is up to that challenge as she is currently still addicted. NOW, if the mother can prove to be a fit responsible mature clean woman when her baby is born, then I believe she should be at least considered to keep her baby, but whats to say she will stay clean?    As i said, i am ready for thumbs down, BUT I hate to see these things... its just awful to me!    edit- I do feel bad for all drug addicts and what they have to go through while they are addicted, and trying to stop using, BUT i also do still hold them accountable for their actions. They werent born addicted and continue using, they made a choice to use, and in turn became addicted which is something almost everyone is aware of before using a drug regardless of experience or knowledge...So I do feel bad, but I dont feel as tho they shouldnt be held accountable for their actions and decisions!|`|Ar80Ri8eaa	Drug addicts should be sterilized forcibly, sorry, that's unfair to allow them to reproduce. |`|NZNWaC1Faa	She don't deserve to be a mom, cause she's killing her baby before it's born. And will be born with a bbirth defect.|`|3Hm5eJfVaa	No she shouldn't be allowed to keep the baby until she cleans her act up. If you think that is bad the same family was on Oprah today and the entire family exept her toddler is addicted and she even shoots up her older kids. 
AjqO1aJgaa	Welcome to the wonderful world of parenting :)    I think the main thing to remember is that after a week, the person who is looking after your baby would no longer be a stranger. And you should pick someone to look after who you don't feel unhappy about leaving him with.    A good childcarer will understand your concerns, and will want to get to know you and your child so it's not miserable leaving him the first few times. Your child will gain from the new and different experience of being with a different trusted adult. And you will be a better parent if you have some time following yor own dreams.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	Many mother experience this tug of war, whether they have to return to work or school.    I would strongly suggest that if you can afford it, stay home with your baby and plan to go back to school next year. I know a couple of mothers who finished school for their child's sake when their child was under 1 years old. They deeply regret it now and wish they would have just stayed home to work on the major bonding and development time that takes place in the 1st year. Your baby is only a baby for so long, try to enjoy it as much as you can.     Good luck!|`|kwMA5I1iaa	That would be so hard for me too! You are doing the right thing though. Have you ever thought about hiring someone to help with things around the house? I've seen a lot of ads on craigslist and other papers where stay at home mom's are looking for help around the house while they spend time with their little one. You don't have to hire a professional either. Just some responsible teen that wants to make a couple extra bucks. That way you can go to college and when you're home, the laundry and cleaning is done and you can stay at home with your baby.|`|pVuNxfBZaa	I know exactly how you're feeling. I have a 4 month and this is my first child as well. However, I must point out that you're very fortunate to be able to take your child with you to class as well as still receiving maternity benefits 5 months after giving birth. If you don't mind me asking, which country do you live in? I need to move there!     As difficult as it is, every mother faces this decision at one point or another. The best thing you can do for your family is to finish school. With time, you'll get used to leaving your child with someone else. Just make sure that this person is someone you can trust and is great with children. You'll be fine! Good luck!|`|0vLU2GGGaa	I went thru the same thing as you.  I went back to college 5 years ago and decided i want to get a degree, and right after i registered, i found out i was pregnant.  I didn't want to give up so i continue the school, i also have a full time job, and need to keep the house while I was pregnant.  It was tough after the baby is here, basically during baby's wake hour, i couldn't get anything done, so all my studies are done between the hours from 9pm - 2am during weekdays and weekends, for the past 5 years.    I think you should just take small step, like taking less class each semester (in my most crazy period i can only manage 1 class).  It is some scrafice you need to make, if you absolutely cannot juggle everything, i would recommend daycare, maybe just a few hours a day.  To be honest, it wouldn't hurt, it might even benefit your baby (to intereact with someone else besides you).      Time management is the key.|`|2SZuyzL0aa	It would be very hard but first off--He isn't even going to remember that you weren't around when he was little.  Both of my parents worked long hour jobs and I am an only child.  I have no ill feelings about them working (it allowed me to be a little bit spoiled) it also showed me what hard work is all about.  I had a great childhood, I think the family vacations that we took (once again-thanks to them both working so hard) are my really big memories.  You can always make time on weekends, nights, mornings.  Once again, it would be hard--but until they get older I would work my butt off and then you would have more of an income/savings to stay home.  Or maybe get a job that allows you to work from home.|`|hl5WdXnbaa	I strongly believe you should finish your education. It will only benefit you and your family latter.     Don't get me wrong, I am a huge fan of stay home mommies but I believe a woman should have an education so she can stand on her own too feet if needed. Divorces happen, death and illnesses happen, and even in today's tough economy more and more SAHM are being forced back to the work place.   school will not last forever but the good from it will. It is a short time sacrifice for a long term gain.    Can Daddy help around the house more too?|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	Well you only get to parent your baby ONCE.....you can never recapture that time, and I believe it is important to be with them.  Like you said, you went through a lot of heartache and trouble to have him in the first place, why would you now hand him over to virtual strangers all day long?  I think there is some room here for compromise....is there anyway you can stretch out your courses for a couple more semesters?  Take a lighter course load, spend more time with him and hand him over to strangers less....and just graduate a little later than you had originally planned.    Then you can figure out the whole working thing.  I stayed at home with the kids while they were babies and toddlers and worked out of the house until they started school, then I started working outside the home but only during school hours.      It's important to me that I am with them before school and after school....I want to make sure they are eating nutritious foods and not being exposed to age-inappropriate things, etc.|`|cUCtK4zCaa	Hun just find some one you trust and finish school..Trust me you're little one will be off to school in a few years and you will have all day long to work and make a nice income for you're hole family..     school know does not mean you have to work know..Just means you are just one step closer in the event you may have to work..At any time life could change and you're better half may no longer be able to work a good paying Job..    Good Luck   Tonya|`|hY0cb2xRaa	5 hours per week is manageable time. I would not send him to child care but still take help of family and friends to take care of him .. also when you want to read rigorously for exam.. read when he is sleeping and do that everyday ( not only on during exam time)..|`|add1238669d46216eb94b39fb19e0553aa	i think this is a dilema every mother faces. you know you need to go to work/school but the thought of your child being with someone else really hurts. i have to work due to our financial situation. dont be like me and my husband neither one of us finished college and now we both have decent jobs but with a college degree chances are we would have some breathing room. finish school and get your degree for your son.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	Sounds normal.    Also start thinking more seriously about what you will do when you graduate.  Take a look at working mother magazine, online, at what kinds of jobs and companies, offer flexibility and benefits for working mothers.|`|WxoZrTPlaa	Yes, this is something all mothers face.  Just make sure you find good, quality care, someone/someplace you can trust.  Make sure the time you have with your son is quality time.  You'll be surprised that spending so much time away from you won't hurt him at all.  You'll still be the Mama, which means you will always be his  1!  :)    Best wishes to you and baby Lukas!

At 14 teens do want a lot of attention and lash out when they dint get it. You should spend more time with him as well. I wish i had an older sister who i could have relied on when i was going through that stage.

r39EDGhPaa	Ugh, that sickens me to be honest.  Teens shouldn't have children(but it happens, so I can understand one time.)  But 7 kids by the time she's 16?  That's just messed up.  After having triplets at the age of 15, she should have gotten on birth control or something.  Why would you even keep having sex after that?  I think it's that girls fault and she is just dumb.    Yes she should get more assistance, because that is for her children.  I do think that she should have given the children to more deserving parents who can actually afford them on their own.  That is just pathetic and really gets me heated.  I can't believe some people actually feel bad for her.  I feel bad for her children.    Some women can't even have children, but can afford them.. and this immature little girl keeps getting multiples and has no money of her own to support them.  UGHH.|`|b2ZwhOqsaa	i agree with you. yea shes really dumb and obvsly never heard of a thing called BIRTH CONTROL, but none the less, theres 7 beautiful little babies that need to be taken care of.|`|POHWTDPRaa	It doesn't matter that her goal wasn't to have 7 kids. Her goal should have been to have 0 kids. She shouldn't have been having sex at only 13, 14 years old. There's no reason she should have gotten pregnant even once, but it happened twice more? I think it's pretty obvious that nothing was being done to prevent a pregnancy which means that not only is this girl is an irresponsible knucklehead, everyone around her is totally unconscious. So how many of her daughters are going to get pregnant far too young and far too many times?    No, the kids don't deserve to go without. They deserve to be raised by people who are going to love them enough to give them just a little damn guidance so they don't end up totally ruining their lives or having a bunch of kids of their own whose lives they will end up wrecking.

Here is that story.     Teenage Argentinean girl gives birth to female triplets for second time  2008/02/23  A 16-year-old Argentine girl gave birth to female triplets for the second time in her life on Wednesday, local media reported.    Doctors said the three newborns and their mother were well and are puzzled by the two consecutive multiple births. Teenage mother Pamela had the first baby, a boy, at 14. A year later she gave birth to the first set of female triplets.    Pamela grew up in the remote town of Leones in the central Argentine province of Cordoba. After her first set of triplets were born in July 2006, she asked doctors to tie her tubes, in order to prevent any possibility of getting pregnant.    The doctors refused as, according to Argentinean law, the procedure cannot be performed to women under 21. All seven children were born prematurely. Pamela receives help from the local and provincial authorities, who built her a house when the first set of triplets was born.    However, she told local media she's overwhelmed. She has been abandoned by the fathers of all of the children, was forced to leave school to take care of them and is currently unemployed.    Pamela's mother, the children's grandmother, is the only source of income for the family. "We will have to use a program of non-permanent contraceptive methods, what we call barrier methods such as intrauterine devices or hormonal methods, something with a high security so this girl can plan her family, said another doctor.|`|jtjISk6qaa	wtf???|`|DNygQdmVaa	if they need it then yes.|`|AiLcSxcBaa	HOLY S***... yeah she needs more help.|`|5b5af5996541cb6415e25d42b3bce9d0aa	Holy sh*t!

So yes, I think they should get assistance, but like food, shelter and a job for this woman so she can support her own kids instead of having to look to her mother for help.|`|feoxRAUDaa	we are responsible for our own actions|`|8ENRWmoMaa	well this is the problem that is world wide, people having kids which they can not support.  all it does is hurt the children and hurt the tax payers.  I dont think people should get any assitence to raise there kids.  even if it is just one kids.  I feel people need to be held accountable for their actions, and need to be more resposible.|`|mAPSl0DZaa	The question isnt should she, its should they?They did not ask to be created, but here they are. They need to be cared for and if the parent/s can not provide for thier needs then we as a society should take care of them|`|YeFt3IEUaa	Her mother should have made her give up her first baby for adoption and told the daughter that she WILL NEVER do anything like that again! If the behavior continued, the mother should have put the kid in a foster home or told her she is not allowed to live with her. It may seem "harsh" but it shouldn't be the taxpayers' money that supports her actions. Imagine the life those children will lead.     I'm 14 and would NEVER do that. Nor would I expect anyone to take care of me.|`|AA11437439	i would have thought after getting pregnant the first time she would have worked out what caused it    typical of people not taking responsibility for their own actions and expecting everyone else to pick up the tab|`|HI6fx8nYaa	of course she shold get more help is it even legal in her country to use contaception.. or will her religon allow it if she is from a remote part of her country then maybe she just thoght it could not happen again is the girl even educated is sex a taboo subject you just dont no but she deserves help and her children do at the end of the day she is still a child herself.. i live in dublin and i no loads of youg girls with 4and five at the age of 17 18 19,,and they get help  and we are supposed to be e civiliced country i think a girls of pamelas age are doing the same thing only poor pamela had multiple pregnancies god love her|`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	no the kids should be taken away and she should be sterilized

NQ2sDQMRaa	my sister-in-law throughout her whole pregnancy could only eat a small amount at a time otherwise she would throw up right after, but she would eat several times a day, it was really the only way her and the baby could get any nutrition|`|UAunAKdtaa	Yup...my baby starved me all day long. i had to have a fan blowing on my face if someone was cooking because the mere smell of food would make me sick. after about 8 PM i would be able to eat something small and fat free, like a piece of toast. i had to eat a lot on the evening to replace the lost calories of the whole day. but dont worry, after about 3 months you will be able to eat just fine. its perfectly normal to lose weight instead of gaining it in the first trimester. at the end of my first 3 months, i threw up 6 times one night, and after that the barfiness and nausea went away as if they never existed. you will be totally fine. just try eating vegetable-originated stuff instead of animal. its lighter on your stomach, doesnt make you as nauseous, and is healthier for baby..try eating peanut butter sandwiches. or any other type of nuts. stay away from fried foods. good luck and congrats!|`|a169a0735b83b7ed12f616a7190a2202aa	Could be early pregnancy.  Get to the drug store and take a test girl!|`|g7gvzhkpaa	you could be take a test maybe it's the flu ?|`|41750b9e94be3f10bf789863a1a3a228aa	Don't stress.  Often times we freak out and we take little things and make them out to be more than they are.  Wait and then take a home test when you are actually late.
vXFpzKRaaa	"...please remember that this chart is for entertainment purposes only."    With that being said, the gender of a baby has nothing to do with the mom or her age since the mom only produces an egg that has the "x" chromosome.  The man's sperm is what actually decides the gender of the baby.  Each sperm contains either an "x" or a "y" chromosome.  If the "x" makes it to the egg, it combines with the "x" of the woman to make a girl.  And if the "y" makes it, it'll combine with the "x" of the lady to make the baby a boy.      Also take this into consideration.  If this chart was found in a tomb 700 years ago where their life span is significantly shorter than ours today, that means that they would of married and had kids earlier.  Why then is there not any information before 18?  And I'm sure there are some ladies that can still give birth after 45 though they might be rare.  I don't take this chart too seriously since like I said before, it's basically by chance that the gender is determined.  If this chart is true, there would be no need for expensive fertilization techniques that can give you a baby with the gender of your choice.  Like the chart says, I consider this "for entertainment purposes only."|`|d3c30c997a493d45035b45c61e8d3827aa	not sure, but it was accurate for me when I was pregnant with my son.  I think you have to change your age or something.  I just plug my numbers in the website with the one that changes your age for you.|`|AA12107422	Not that accurate. It was 50/50 for both of my pregnancies. Said I was having a girl for my first & I did. Said I was having a boy for my second, I had a girl. Its a 50/50 chance, but still fun to do!! =]
MQ34YW28aa	This will be my son's first valentine's day. We plan on going to Wells Fargo Bank because they are doing this thing with children if you open up a savings account with them (it's free) you get to grab a handful of change and that change gets deposited into his account. I thought that was pretty neat. So we'll do that then probably go out to eat and just hang out at home and my hubby and I will watch a movie while our little guy is sleeping. (he's 9 weeks so he sleeps a lot) Have fun packing!!! It's always exciting to move i think and move into a new home. Happy Valentine's Day to you!!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	When's Valentine's Day again? ;)|`|IFDfpbFJaa	My boyfriend bought me a puppy....I'd been wanting it for a while. I'm not sure what I'm going to do for him yet, I'm still at a loss. I don't think were going to go out to dinner or anything because were trying to save money.|`|rjVALevtaa	Nothing extravagant. We will most likely take the kids to his parents' house for the weekend. It will just be nice to spend some time alone!|`|Ra8cdjbDaa	Let's see... I have to work until 5, my husband works until 10... and we both have to be up early the next day.    Sucks because it's our first Valentines Day together since getting married.|`|QZ2XeGtwaa	I have hundreds of ideas for Valentine's Day gifts and thing to do at my blog!  http://maryannsvalentinesdaygiftideas.bl...|`|SaRDq9iLaa	We haven't really talked about it yet.  My husband is working until 6 and then we will probably go out to eat with our 5 month old.|`|DNygQdmVaa	good luck with moving!  me and my husband are going shopping for some new clothes, we sure need it! lol.  then were goin out to dinner.|`|WirFwirLaa	My husband doesn't get to come home that weekend so it's me & my 1 yr. old hanging out with grandma & grandpa. I think my sister has a high school basketball tournament so I think we might go to that Saturday! Fun, fun!!!|`|4Bgw5xs8aa	My hubby always surprises me with something special. The first year it was a surprise night time picnic on a cliff by the ocean...the second he bought me a huge teddy and cooked me my fave dinner, and last year he set up a treasure hunt for me and built a cherry lock box with red velvet inside and put a sappy note and a coach bag I had been wanting inside. I can't wait to see what he does this year!
SaRDq9iLaa	I don't put my daughter's cereal in her bottle because I am afraid of her choking and I also want to associate that food like cereal should be eaten with a spoon.  I also have her sit in her highchair or booster-seat to eat all her solid food, that way she learns to associate she needs to be sitting nicely to eat.  My MIL does that same thing (loves to voice her opinion when it is not asked or needed!)  Good luck to you!|`|qXIBxiataa	To me the cereal just seems to thick to go in the bottle|`|WGTRBYepaa	because the baby needs to learn to eat it off of a spoon|`|4ksa4lhWaa	I don't know I did, When my son was about 4 months.      Only did couple of times, no problems.    Note: yes it should be put in a bowl and fed by spoon.|`|1469145fbc54553729532a83a0ba1985aa	You have a stupid doctor!!    1) Choking  2) Isn't teaching your child how to eat  3) Liquid calories instead of calories being eaten  4) No reason to put it into the bottle - it's cereal. Cereal is meant to be mixed in a bowl.|`|eya1WDS4aa	Just tell her its your choice. I put it in my sons bottle. The dr. told me it couldnt chock him. The dr actually told me i needed to because my son had very bad acid reflux and cereal in his bottle would help plus it kept him full longer. It blends right in with the formula. But just tell your MIL that its your choice what you do with your son and that she had her chance at raising her kids and now its your turn so juts back off.    im also gonna add that my son was very health and all the way untill he was a year and a half he was big for his age.|`|TqOdbhNAaa	The reason why babies have cereal is to get used to solid foods and their tastes/textures.  Babies don't have cereal for nutrition or to get them to sleep through the night.  If you put it in their bottle, they're not learning how to eat real food so there's no point really.  My mother and my MIL put cereal in mine and my husband's bottle, but it's just different now.  Tell your MIL that you would prefer to follow the doctor's advice and that she can bring it up with him if she has a problem with it.|`|a6103b5448a81b3f2d761f035154c522aa	No solids before 4 months, even cereal.  A baby is born with an underdeveloped intestine called an 'open gut' that allows bacteria to freely pass between intestine and bloodstream and solids can harm a developing intestine.  Second, its your baby, not hers.|`|B4dJINsbaa	Putting cereal in with formula is a out dated practice. A baby does not start simple cereal such as Rice or Barley till they are about 4 months. As long as a baby is thriving they only need breast milk or formula in the early months.|`|EMt11Qfzaa	Cereal in a bottle is a big "no-no" from doctors these days.   Your MIL must be old school. My grandmother always pushed me to do this and I never did. My kids are fine.   Cereal is for a spoon and if you have to change the size and flow of a nipple...well, that just tells you something right there.   Good Luck!|`|CmxJdPh2aa	many of our mothers still believe that cereal in the formula/breastmilk and poking a bigger hole in the nipple of the bottle will lead to a longer sleep and happier/more content child. this is just not true. and there are many risks including choking and obesity. babies shouldn't get ANYthing but breastmilk or formula until they are at the minimum 4 months old.  they don't need the calories and their tummies are just not ready for that kind of food yet.     i'm sure when our babies have babies we will tout off our baby-wisdom and some of it will likely be outdated as well. sometimes its easier just to grin and nod and know that you aren't going to take their advice on the inside...thats what i do. lol  rather not fight over it, honestly.    OH and my main reason for believing whole-heartedly the harm in cereal in bottles is my friends child did this and had other foods WAY too young and she is very large. she is probably the size of a child a year older than her or more. its sad that she will have to deal with that her whole life and it was her mommys fault, not hers.|`|iFAlZfVMaa	an infant is meant to swallow "milk."  it's instincts are NOT to swallow thick mucous- ish liquid.  he may gag.  he may learn to LIKE the thick milk and then refuse cow's milk at 1 year and then what do you do? mix in cereal until he turns 16 and drives off to score his own box of gerber rice cereal?  either way, it's not necessary unles your child NEEDS the thicker milk due to reflux, but then that AGAIN is done with a doctor's supervision.    We've learned MUCH about infants since her sons were little... we were all put down on our tummies, now WE KNOW babies go "back to sleep"... your peditrician says no cereal.  that should put an end to it, if not, she can learn to NOT care for her grandson until she can be trusted to respect you as his mother.|`|ED81fQVnaa	My son loved his baby cereal, but I'd put it in a bowl and just feed him with a spoon.  My doctor told me not to put cereal in his bottles because it comes out thick and makes baby's want to suck on the nipple harder, which can later cause seriously bad gum problems for them.. so that's my experience.|`|z2mpC5NDaa	i raised 3 boys and i always put cereal in their bottles with absolutely no problems.....   now the docs say not to... due to the baby possible choking on the cereal/formula mix if you lay the baby down with the bottle unattended.......  any time i fed my babies i never left them unattended but, some people will lay the baby down and prop the bottle up and leave the baby unattended which of course the baby could choke.....    use your mother instincts and raise your baby the way you feel you should........ i did and i have 3 grown sons, married with children......    my children were not obese....  they still learned to eat when they could sit in a highchair from a spoon with no problem.....  they did not learn bad eating habits.......    to each their own..........|`|bd22ca32eb55bc06eaa923b22bd0e54aaa	We put it in our son's because he has very bad reflux. He was spitting up so bad it was coming out of his nose. To me, that's a bigger choking hazard than cereal in the bottle. I wouldn't have done it if the Dr. didn't recommend it though, if it's not used to help relux, it does seem pointless in a bottle. Tell you MIL that you appreciate her concern but that you and your dr. have decided it's not what's best for YOUR son.|`|ctUG4BXfaa	OMGosh! I have the exact same problem.. Is it no the most frustrating thing ever. But to answer your question, if you don't feel comfy giving your child cereal.. DON'T. It can cause choking, gas problems, digestion problems and so much more. A newborns stomach isn't ready for cereal until at least 4months old. EVERY doctor will recommend this. There are some cases however, that doctors suggest cereal for newborns when they have colic. But I just read that your son is 4months old. So therefore, he can be given cereal according to doctors. But talk it over with your doctor and spouse.. its always good to take the hubby to the doctor so the MIL will here it from him as well and not think you are just being spiteful! lol. Don't let her walk over you. Stand for yourself. If you ever need to talk you can email me!|`|ZXhpEuGpaa	I started feeding my daughter in one of those feeders at 4 months and when i took her in for her shots i asked my pedi about it and she about freaked,said not to feed her with one my first reaction was OH Really (just to be nice)when i told my hubby about it he said to feed her however i wanted to i was really offended at first,However there must be a reason for it or she would'nt be so against it,so i stopped feeding her with one i feed her with a spoon now she's 5 mths and i enjoy watching her learn to eat as well as how messy she gets.    I agree with you on the not giving him ceral as a newborn their little tummy's arent tough enough,i know they use to do it(in the old days)but this is 2009 and times change.He is YOUR baby,and you make the decisions no matter what advice others give you,so dont let it get to ya when it's all said and done you make the final decision.     oops! i re-read you question and realized i may have been tyalking about something kind of different,but my paragheph above pertains to your question.|`|gU2WeT55aa	cereal in a bottle, not a bad idea|`|tsRhqi0Daa	never heard of that|`|p2Njf5gBaa	Because its filling them without something less nutritious, denying them nutrition.      Young infants aren't suppose to or ready to digest complex carbohydrates.     Solids should be feed off a spoon and not in a bottle.      It is unnecessary.     Baby can choke on it.      Promotes bad eating habits.     Its gross, ask her why she doesn;t drink her oatmeal in her morning coffee?    Also justt tell her that your the mommy and you say no.      If he is able to be spoon feed, you would rather do it that way!|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	I read that they are getting more calories, but eating the same amount.  This causing confusion on how much they need to eat to be full, and how much they eat to have enough calories.    Although, I still don't really get it, I am choosing also to not put it in my daughters bottle, but that's more because I want to feed her on a spoon, and if I'm gonna start cereal, why not on a spoon?  I'm just anxious!    Also, my daughter will be 4 months on the 7th, but I'm still gonna wait a while longer.  She has a sensitive tummy, and I don't wanna upset it!|`|MuK6HIKoaa	Woah. I've never even heard of that before.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Because it's stupid, unnecessary and dangerous.  And my doctor told me not to.|`|wENdWT5kaa	I made that choice with my daughter to put rice cereal in her bottles. (bring on the thumbs down)  She did not choke, she isn't over weight, (not even close, i think she's too skinny myself) she has no allergies and she never had a tummy ache from it.     I never gave it too her once she was able to feed herself as i did leave the room for a bathroom break or just had to go into the kitchen for a second. But when i did, i fed her so i was there to make sure she did not choke. I didn't even make it thick, just one teaspoon per bottle (she was at 6 ounces when i started doing it)    With my son, he just turned 2 months, and i haven't even thought about doing it. And if i do decide, that will be my choice.|`|fHjSonssaa	Cereal can be too thick to put into bottle.  That's if your putting A TON of cereal in the bottle.  My son doesn't even like thick cerealon the soon right now and he's 10 months.  But I do put cereal in my son's bottles- at the night feeding.  If I make a 6 oz bottle (he never eats 8) , I'll put 1-2 formula scoops of cereal in the bottle.  It doesn' t change the consistancy.  If I didn't tell you I put it in there, I don't think you'd even know.  But it is a little more substance- and tides him over in the evening.    I don't think you HAVE to put cereal in there if you don't want to, but if you want to, go right ahead.  Perfect bottles/nipples to use that are really reasonable in price....Sassy MAM Ultivent bottle.  The size 3 nipple is NOT that fast, but has the perfect open so you can put cereal in the bottle and it actually flows without getting clogged.  My son was NOT a very strong feeder for quit some time and he did VERY well with these bottles and nipples.  They are just perfect bottle without the cereal too- I love them!!!|`|AA10186411	I put cereal in an infant feeder for my daughter, due to severe reflux.  I only did it at night since she was going to be laying down for a longer period of time.  I think if its not necessary then it shouldn't be used.  All MIL are bossy little hussys, so I wouldn't take it personally lol|`|DNygQdmVaa	the choking thing, and cereal is used to teach abbies how to eat solids so if your putting it in his bottle your defaetng the purpose.|`|1dueLOdvaa	Chocking hazard.     And it just adds empty calories.    And there is NO evidence it helps babies sleep longer at night.|`|SwvCb2Bfaa	I always put cereal in my son's bottle, it kept him fuller and helped his body adjust to solids.|`|Hm7MtmYPaa	I do put cereal in his bottle.  It helps with his reflux.    The only reason my mom didn't was because she would keep getting the nipples mixed up, and she'd put the cereal nipple on a regular bottle and it would go everywhere.|`|jTM6Upm5aa	Do what you feel is right for your child..Do not condemn what others do. I have never put cereal in my baby`s bottles, I always thought it was messy and they could choke. Not to mention it can cause obesity.This is what my child`s paediatrician told me.It`s old school advice...It`s kind of like putting honey on a soother|`|xcPghcw9aa	Babies can choke from eating cereal from a bottle. its to thick.
WlU3NFu6aa	at her 9 mo appt her dr said she's ready to walk and should be by hernext appt in a month. He was right! He said that she's doing everything she should be doing maybe more. Oh and he said she has a huge personality. Cause at her visit she was talking loudly, crawling around and having dad carry her to turn the light switch off and on|`|AA11210211	Yep I've gotten that one too my daughter was about  two weeks old and could hold her head up for about a minute without help.Also my son rolled over the night he was born,the nurses where shocked that he could do that.    EDIT:  I found a picture of her at 1 month holding her head up:    http://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o197/...    Here is the ones form 2 weeks old!! she is so tiny!! lol    http://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o197/...    http://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o197/...|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	my baby rolled over the day she was her while her dr was there too see he said she is tiny but wow is she strong and healthy!!|`|AA10186411	4 month olds should definitely be able to hold their head up well.  Maybe she doesn't have experience with children?|`|M5E3mDBJaa	Yes, I get this all the time because my daughter was adopted out of a very bad situation and I guess people assume that a child born into a bad situation is doomed to amount to nothing.      She was a month premature and from day one was still hitting all her milestones at the expected time (without age adjustment) or even early.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Your 4 month old SHOULD be able to hold his head up well, that's not advanced, that's a normal development.    Anyway, at my son's last appointment(9 months) the doctor was surprised he was self feeding. I don't know why, many babies do it at his age, maybe she just hasn't run into any that do.|`|ogdm7RLYaa	A lot of people do not know the stages of when babies develop. When my sister-in-law and brother come to visit-they still try to carry my 9 month old like a newborn! He doesn't have any of it!     I am sure your baby is doing great!|`|upvch2BRaa	my ten month old walked into his visit, the doctor was very surprised.|`|df378c28318ff6097f7f272b0367e6cbaa	Yeah, I think they do that a lot, lol.  They like to comment on your baby and make you feel good about him (also looks good on the doctor!)|`|X7erIjDdaa	Wow he has hit puberty already? That's amazing!|`|NxawUYVaaa	Yes, the doc commented that it was advanced for my 4 month old to roll over both ways and pull himself around. He could also hold his head up from birth which surprised the nurses, but I've heard of other people's babies doing that.|`|wKYdIaZVaa	Yes, many people are usually suprised how advanced Chloe is. Since she was born 5 weeks early, they think she's a lot younger than she actually is. I usually just laugh and tell them she was a preemie and that's why she's "small"    Although I still think that at 5 months 14lbs and 24 inches isn't that small...|`|CmxJdPh2aa	i honestly just thought they try to pick out something excellent about every kid that comes in to assure the parent and make them feel all warm and fuzzy. :)  i'm sure the compliments are all honest, but its hard not to compliment on something about amazing little babies.    with my son he did hold his head up since he came out...the nurse actually didn't believe me until she pulled him up by his arms into a sitting position and she said, "they aren't supposed to do that..." in defense of her doubting me. so i guess thats the most undeniably genuine complement about my son's development i've gotten. everyone comments on his verbal skills also, and his manners.   i try to enjoy all the compliments on my kids now, because i remember how i was and the trouble i got into as i got older. :)|`|4ksa4lhWaa	Sure but all babies are special in every way.  Some develop later and some early.  As long as there healthy I dint' care how my baby is developing.      Oh and he rolls all over the floor back and forth at 4.5 month.  And can sit unassisted for about 2 seconds now to.  I think that pretty great.  :)))    Good luck and congrats

Just my opinion though.|`|X7u8DbV0aa	Austin Tyler      congrats!|`|D5gj2h7Jaa	To have something that is not overused I would go with Austin Conley!

Z9360MMxaa	Business suit for formal meetings. Darker colors but with a flare of personality. Make sure that all your buttons are done up and your hygiene is on par. Looking formal is the easy part portraying yourself is the hard part. Make sure you do research on these potential clients and their business needs. Try to have a "schedule" of what message your trying to convey. Always bring along something to show your credibility and remember to be friendly. No one wants to do business with a cranky, snooty, know it all.|`|41750b9e94be3f10bf789863a1a3a228aa	A nice dress.  Simple & Sophisticated.  Nothing clingy or low cut.    Wear shoes with a bit of a heel, this will also give you confidence.  Keep them closed toe.    Simple jewelry.  Something you would wear to church.      Perhaps a nice sweater tied around your shoulders.    Good Luck!
q4EXFhV7aa	respite??    I USED to think it was a good idea, but a former foster kid in this forum taught me otherwise. Now I think the BEST idea is to give respite care to actual mothers, so that they can be the best possible moms and so that their children are more likely to remain within the home....versus being placed in foster care. You should try being a Big Brother/Big Sister to a poor child or one in need of an adult mentor. I am sure there are other similar programs as well. While foster parents are a necessary and vital resource, the POINT is to have these children remain in their natural homes. The way we do that is by supporting natural families....so that they can be great parents to their children.
be5076c0b98b495ffe00aade08f96b65aa	Honey, why would you pay that much money to find out what you already know? If your not missing periods and your testing negative 5 times, you ARE NOT pregnant. I'm sorry if your trying to conceive, I know how hard this is. I have no idea how they would've detected the HCG hormone by the pap smear. But I do know upon examination of the cervix during a pap, your doc would be able to tell if you were secreting HCG by the look and feel of your cervix. A pregnant woman's cervix changes immediately upon conception.    Good luck!|`|AA10390690	i never knew they could test thro a pap but it's good little info now to know =]|`|jgtfWjE4aa	you're not pregnant.    and yes pap smears can detect hcg levels.|`|LiPoEBenaa	I don't know if the pap would have detected the Hcg, but the doctor would have been able to tell if you were pregnant by looking at your cervix.When you're pregnant the cervix lowers and has a purplish hue to it. I doubt you're pregnant, but good luck!
8WRnqs08aa	My last delivery was predetermined to be a c-section. My baby was transverse & stayed transverse, so I would've ended up with a c-section regardless. While most babies will turn, some stay put. I had a friend whose baby stayed breech until 2 days before delivery. There are tactics you can do to try to get the baby to move.|`|AA10358531	oh gosh!! I'm mother of 5 children.... I hope your baby turn around by due date... well, if your baby it not turn around might have C-sections.  remember you want your baby healthy come first than anything else!!  good luck and god bless!|`|mc6YtaRbaa	My sister was breech in week 39 and then the baby flipped.|`|l6dOPCWoaa	Ii dint know but i would say about the last 4 weeks of pregnancy but i had a breech with my second child and was born feet first sometimes they try and turn before  there born i hpoe this helps|`|2ZOkyoSJaa	My son was breech until about 35 weeks, then he flipped. He did have a loose loop of umbilical cord around his neck though so watch out for that.
Q76cDCgAaa	365 days of the year and she picks it to be on YOUR birthday?  If anything I find the older sister being a bit selfish.  I mean seriously she couldn't pick the day after or before, or even a week before or after?  OK - so if it's your aunt, cousin, whatever, but your sister?  She obviously knows  when her sisters birthday is......    The only thing I can say is don't dress like a skank you have more respect for yourself.  Just find a basic dress, go to the wedding, and than later make plans for yourself......    Best advice I can give...sorry|`|E6T9DPT9aa	Dress as you wish. To be honest, no-one will even notice you. I mean this in the sense of you are a jealous 15 year old. Your family does not hate you, you are JEALOUS of your sister. It's her big day. Be happy for her. Get over it!    All my best (:  E-mail me if you want to know anything else (:|`|Bw18seFqaa	I find most of what you are saying hard to beleive.    Its her wedding, and her day..  you have a birthday every year..  many people dont even celebrate birthdays..  Most people only get married once.    You can out do your sister on YOUR wedding day.|`|CWfGCYYTaa	NO it's her wedding day for god's sake!  the best day of her life  if you do that you are a selfish *****  im sorry but it had to be said!|`|aLAmvX5Naa	If you aren't in the wedding party and you have to buy the dress with your own money you should be free to buy what you want. I wouldn't dress skanky though, have some respect for yourself.|`|VS8mactUaa	Dress up as a dirty w*ore, with the words "My Birthday written across your boobs lol lol|`|rFMRgHTdaa	Don't dress like a skank, its her wedding and just try to enjoy it. Dress nice but not like a skank.|`|89eacaf706726be6ca9f259d599c0f27aa	dont dress like a whore because then they can say "see she is a whore" to everyone who doesn't believe them    still outdress your sister though but make it nice and not whore-like    be really social with all the guests that arent your family and be really nice so they thnik your family is evil instead|`|s1h5MDz0aa	don't dress like a whore cuz then your giving them what they want but do out do everybody else since you have to pay for it.
vrj80Totaa	During my senior year of high school my girlfriend calls me at 5 a.m. and asks if I can let her in the auditorium door first period because she doesn't have class until second. I say sure. So I do and she has a pregnancy test in her hand. I am terrified. She goes into the bathroom and I'm waiting for what feels like a hundred years for the results. There are a thousand thoughts going through my head. I start thinking about the future and how I now can't go to college, I would have to get a better job, I would be viewed as the dumb *** who knocked up his girlfriend, I would have to face my parents, I would have to face her parents(her father is a cop!), and how my life is going to be a living hell with screaming and fighting. I even thought about ending it all in that 1 minute time frame. Then, she came out of the bathroom with the results. It was negative. She took one two days later and then a week later to be sure. Still negative. I recently asked her what she was going through. She said the first thing she thought of was suicide because she didn't want to live with the reputation at school, didn't want to face her family, and didn't want to abort. She didn't get any sleep the night she called me. I'm just glad we had that wake up call before it actually happened. I hope this was helpful.|`|3oGRNQKyaa	i was 14 when i gotten pregnant,and 15 when i had my son.  Jack(my sons dad and also my best friend.We were never together though,just curious) was amazing with it,still is.  well at first he had no idea,bcoz we did use a condom.But it just did not work somehow.  So i told him everything and he asked what i wanted to do,and i said adoption bcoz o was too young for a child,so was he.      It was a every long story,going through abortion(i run away from the clinic before i even told anyone)....then adoption was the ''best option'' until i needed to deal with it and keep my son.    if u need anymore questions answered,email me.  xoxo|`|HOdblqIkaa	i am not a boy but my boyfriend was able to answer this question. He had his 1st child with his x when he was 16 and when he found out he was overjoyed. He was young and in love and when he found out he was going to be a dad he said his heart swelled and he almost cried. His son will be 9 this year and unfortunatly he is not able to see him because his x left him saying their son wasn't his and she wanted nothing to do with him. He hates that he is not able to see his 1st born but has come to terms with it. I am currently 24 weeks pregnant with our child and when he found out he was terrified thinking I would leave him like his x did. After he realized I'm not the same as she is he became really happy about it and wanted to tell the world. He still loves to brag about it to his friends. I guess overall he was excited and nervous but he always took responsiblity for his actions. He realized that he did something and needed to be there to support us during this time in our lives.|`|kEVrRzv8aa	I am sixteen and when my girlfriend said she was pregnant it pretty much felt like my heart died, and my life falshed infront of me. I hung up emediately, she called back and I called her some names, I was in denial and thought it wasnt mine until I thought about it some more. Just some advice, dont tell him until you are unless your absolutely sure. Cause turns out she wasnt and we're back together:)|`|RPpXarDDaa	actually elder...that was a reasonable reaction for someone who is 16. pregnancy is life changing for everyone even married couples.|`|nZVmkZSBaa	The first answerer can go eat sh*t. Lmao... So, if she was pregnant you would have abandoned her? IDIOT!!!  Anyways, I'm not a guy, but I just turned 15 and I'm 17 weeks pregnant. My EX-bf's reaction was like, pretty much shocked. At first he was saying he'd help out, then he managed to convince himself that he's not the father. He wants nothing to do with her, and that's fine with me. He just calls every 5 minutes to remind me the baby could be anybodys, I'm a wh0re, and how he never slept with me. So, he doesn't really love the idea just yet. But imo, guys are diks when they are in a tough situation; nothing will change that.   Violet  x x
zdlLVB1Kaa	My husband and I are on month 10 of trying.  I can't say for sure that we are both healthy but prior to trying, I had gone for my annual physical and my doctor said that she didn't see any reason I would have problems.  She wants to see me if I get to a year without any luck.  I'm saying my prayers that I am pregnant this month though so that I don't have to go through any testing.  I'll know in less than two weeks.
B9KwqnuDaa	Normal clothes.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	Wellll... considering there are TONS of clothes for girls for Valentine's day and almost nothing for boys......  J/K.... I actually did manage to find a few things.  (Still jealous over the options that those w/ girls have though.)    My oldest has a Valentine's shirt that says "official heart breaker" on it and will be wearing that.  My youngest is wearing a "baby's first Valentine's day" outfit I bought at Target.|`|xXnFx6qLaa	That's what he wore for Valentine's Day last year.  I was at work, my aunt was watching him and they surprised me with going to get his pics professionally taken.  :)    This year... I'm not sure yet.|`|j2mRop0laa	This thought never crossed my mind.    Although, they have a V-Day dance on the 13th (which I totally forgot about until just now!!! Omg.. I made plans.. ok I'll deal with that later).   Uhm, for the V-Day dance they are both wearing a black dress. My youngest is a spaghetti strap black empire dress with a short black shrug for the shoulders and I'll pin a rose in her hair. My oldest is a halter black sparkly dress and she has silver shoes that go with it.    I cannot believe I made plans on that night and forgot about this. I'm an idiot.|`|JP2h62qiaa	Ive gotta take a picture and then I will post it up!! BRB    Okay LOVASAURUS    Valentines day express.  He made it hard to take the picture. He was trying to jump :) He keeps me laughing.  http://i254.photobucket.com/albums/hh105...    http://i254.photobucket.com/albums/hh105...    It is a hand me down. I got it before he was born from my cousin and I have been waiting for so long to put it on him!! Almost the day!    *thanks Johnnys mommy!  He hates his hair cut! IT is almost time for another too. He is waking up with bed head again. He has curly hair so I cant keep it long:) He cried so hard when I cut it..Poor lil guy!|`|4gZYucHMaa	my daughter will be wearing her Birthday dress! Because It's her Birthday, the lucky girl will be turning 7!    My son will be wearing a little suit (same thing as Christmas) but both will look darling.    If we didn't have our dd being born on this day, we'd be doing the red or pink thing tho (aside from hubby who just isn't into that stuff)|`|pXSKSS3daa	It's hard to find cute, non-girly, clothing for boys!    Anyway, we(more like me, my husband wanted nothing to do with it!) found a cute Snoopy shirt at Target that says "Call me". I'll put him in that, some jeans, and some red socks.     A cute red sleeper would be fine.|`|JsqMSU9Haa	My kids are small and wouldnt go for the idea to wear anything special on valentines day - though my 4 year old did put heart stickers on his valentines for school (but thats just because it came with the batman and power ranger cards).  A baby is different I guess.  I try to be practical/conservative with funds and I think all the 'cutesy' outfits for the holidays are a waste of money - they only wear them once.|`|da0bd1389f2c6ba2fe645d6d1c4be705aa	the only holidays my mom made us dress up for was Christmas and Easter but i dressed up on school dances for v-day tho    and to answer ur question he will be wearing mommy because im not due till june and dying to get him out|`|f4zHMZ1iaa	The girls wear nipple tassels and thongs now a days.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	Not sure there is really nothing  for baby and toddler boys.I found  a lot for teen boys.If I can not find anything then they will be wearing red shirts.Evan has a red polo and maybe blue jeans.And David has a plain red shirt  and blue jeans.Not really into the spirit but as I said I can not find anything.    That is really cute Johnny's mommy.|`|0e88c2210c8510ae47dbd15b433d18a8aa	Congrats!  Well I would say find a red sleeper .I hope all goes well.
eGpOIV12aa	sounds like a rip-off big time    here in illinois we have The All Kids program offers Illinois uninsured children comprehensive healthcare that includes doctors visits, hospital stays, prescription drugs, vision care, dental care and medical devices like eyeglasses and asthma inhalers. Parents pay monthly premiums for the coverage, but rates for middle-income families are significantly lower than they are on the private market. For instance, a family of four that earns between $42,000 and $63,000 a year pays a $40 monthly premium per child, and a $10 co-pay per physician visit.     i'm surprised that New York doesnt have some kind of program like illinois.
T48smu01aa	well first congrats your prego, second it will not get that dark mine was so light even when I was 3 days passed my period but a line is a line and that means your prego :) Congrats!  Just to verify no it wont get that dark!!! it can be light light and your still prego doesn't mean anything!|`|be5076c0b98b495ffe00aade08f96b65aa	Completely normal! The line just has to appear, the color or intensity of the color has nothing to do with the answer.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	It doesn't have to be.  Mine wasn't and I'm totally preggers.|`|44OH7Si6aa	If you are consistently getting a line in the test area you are pregnant, congratulations  Sometimes the lines just don't get as dark as the control, you can try another brand but you already know you are pregnant, go call your OB and make your first appointment
AA10624857	You actually will have the law on your side when it comes to your patient privacy. Your pregnancy and medical condition is only between you and your doctor. If another person wants to know what is going on with you medically than you will have to give the permission for information to be shared. Until the baby is born, he will have no legal rights to the baby. Being a husband doesn't give you any rights over your wife. Your body is your personal business and you don't have to tell him anything. If he has walked out on you, the tiny rights he does have are gone now. Even morally, you don't need to share what is going on with him. If he feels so strongly about the baby being unwanted, I'd look into seeing what needs to be done to offer him the opportunity to sign off his parental rights as soon as the baby is born. If the marriage seems over, I'd move forward with a divorce before the baby comes and see if he'll give up his parental rights. Contact a lawyer for all the legal steps needed since each state has different laws. I'm generally all for trying to work out marriages, but I think with this one, you're better off without him and your child probably is too.|`|do0zt5xWaa	honey, he sounds like an a s s hole and to be honest its your body you do NOT have to tell him about it. He doesn't own your body.|`|DYJOpfvraa	I'd say, don't tell him anything! If he doesn't care about your emotional well-being and your baby then he has no right to no anything about your pregnancy. As a matter of fact, I feel that some of your complications that are occuring are due to the stress he's putting on your.  Take care of yourself and kick him to the curb. Your health and your baby's are the most important thing right now.|`|AA11604319	Morally, yes, you should keep him informed.  Legally, I don't believe you have any obligation to do so.  Follow your heart and take good care of yourself and your unborn baby.|`|AA10390690	honestly i wouldn't think he legally has to know. i would just worry about you && that baby and forget him.|`|KvUJZa1Paa	Yes legally you still need to tell him if something is wrong with child,If it is his child. You are still legally married to him and he is responsible for you till the divorce is final. But if you are smart you will let him file then you can say he has cheated on you and abandoned you when you was in a difficult pregnancy.  Sorry but he does have all legal right to know what is happening with baby IF it is his.|`|Hm1DHpJ8aa	dear,being a father he has the right to get informed about his baby ,but as you told that he is not only good with you and even  doesn't want you to give birth to the baby, ...i think so he has lost this right.. if he is not interested in his own baby then y should not worry about him, you should not care about him ,morally or legally, whatever.  avoid stress it will be good for you and the baby as well, good luck|`|BxrU8kUJaa	You only have to tell him if you want to.  Legally your medical condition is private and protected.  No doctor can divulge information, so logically you get to make that call.      IF there is some legal ground he can stand on that forces you to tell him your medical condition let him go to court to get the order to force you to do so.  If he's just ranting and threatening just turn a deaf ear to the nonsense.    Morally, it's your call.  Men that can abandon pregnant women are a different breed of jerk than most and I don't think he deserves any more than the woman he's screwed over wishes to give him.|`|VHHis05Naa	You don't have to tell him anything about your body or the pregnancy.  Call him after the baby is born.  He sounds like a controlling jerkface.|`|3d1a3c4a191ed64a8f94a10e834bb850aa	All he needs to know is when and where to send the check when you have this baby.  He can divorce you, but he can't divorce his soon to be born child.  If he wishes to be an *** and throw away his relationship with his son/daughter, that's his choice, but he will still owe child support.  Make sure you get it from him.|`|a169a0735b83b7ed12f616a7190a2202aa	Depending on the state you live in.  I live in Oregon and here you would be legally obligated to tell him|`|uuceuyRyaa	No, you don't have to, it's your baby..your the one that has to hold it for 9 months! not him!!!!|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	I WOULDNt tell him a thing at least for as long as you can He is a mean selfish man dont you dare take him back as he will jsut get worse and do it again and again
AA10056181	Trust me....      You look really really good!!!!|`|4uqj8Nf1aa	u look just normal to me!  btw that 4d scan picture is amazing! i had one but the little bugger had her hands over her face!!|`|4lKc0gCfaa	I think you look perfect, not too small and not too big.|`|f9d25be9a86bcb470e6b157992207144aa	You look fine for 36 weeks. And you shouldn't worry if you LOOK big or small, as long as the doctor says baby is fine, then why does it matter what your belly looks like?|`|AYx7BnfZaa	Aww, I think you look spot on hun, you're pics are so cute :)|`|MPcnocYJaa	you look great, first of all. congrats, and im jealous! lol    you look average for 36wks. i was a fair amount bigger than you but my baby was huge. lol so i'd say you look average.    it's normal for you to have not dropped yet. i didn't drop til about 38wks. good luck! and congrats again!
VGij9p0Taa	I disagree with most people I really like the name and I like it the English spelling with the U is wonderful also why spell it the American way Honor when you are British. I also think this makes the name unique and ultra cute. The name didn't make me think of Jessica Alba daughter their are a few Honor/Honour's I know and heard of. So I don't think it makes the name less original its still really adorable.   Middle name suggestions:-  Elizabeth meaning god is my vow   Isabelle meaning god's gift   Katherine meaning pure maiden   Penelope meaning weaver  Hope this helps and stick with what you think is best!|`|NZKiSfVOaa	Personally I think its okay, lovely infact.  But you see a lot of chavs walking round these days with gold big hoop ear rings with there names in and Honour, Jade, Faith, Sky, ect... like that, very chaverish now =/  but it is a lovely name.|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	Not all to much and even worse for a little girl. Sorry, just not going to lie to you|`|U3prt8tlaa	I think it sounds ridiculous.|`|POHWTDPRaa	I like it. My wife and I considered that for our daughter but ultimately had to throw it out. We just couldn't set her up for a lifetime of stupid 'On her' jokes.|`|ijh4ycL2aa	Yuck.  I don't like those sort of..."Word names" if you know what I mean.  Like, I don't like:    Honour  Charity  Destiny  Hope  Faith  Chastity    Felicity, Verity, and Grace are all right...But I'd NEVER name a girl Honour.  No way.  Bye:) xxxxx|`|OHfZFR31aa	I don't like it, but I don't like names like Faith, Hope, Patience, Charity, Chastity, Grace, etc either.|`|GKJEgidzaa	I don't think it sounds right for a girl, or for a name at all.|`|KXmcx8sRaa	i hate it.  what about meghan? emily? olivia? shannon? Ashley? Kendyl? ANYTHING BUT THAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|jgtfWjE4aa	personally,i don't like it, that's what jessica alba named her daughter so therefore people wont find your choice original.     and if you DID name her honour...take out the u and make it honor.|`|viwq8ldvaa	Cheesy.|`|BomQzrT1aa	It's very nice.    Faith, Hope, Trinity, Rain, Charity and Willow are nice for a girl too.    And spell it like "Honor" it looks more feminine that way.    Lots of love, Nikki,,xo|`|cn2rvsdOaa	I don't like it sorry!|`|tkWBinDhaa	I really like it AND I MOST DEF like it spelled that was its different !!|`|c67a2f77ab7471bed4b2f279ff05e2e1aa	As a name it's usually spelled "Honor"|`|JO3j4fpXaa	I like it.    I like Verity Honour|`|qfsVYQMraa	It's not bad.    But get rid of the 'U'    I'm English too, i just think it looks better spelt 'Honor'|`|HlOmfQBQaa	I like bob    call your girl bob :P|`|6uRWoIjJaa	I like it as a middle name but not the first...makes me think of the police|`|ae9fc9a3eab22a6443df9b44ecb52d00aa	its beautiful but like it spelled Honor :-)|`|d6e11chxaa	I like names with strong meaning, but I prefer virtue names that mean the virtue, not the actual word. So, Anna instead of Grace, Verity instead of Truth, etc. It's a decent choice, although not one I would use. It could make a nifty middle name choice instead of trendy Grace and Faith!|`|8mQVfDRqaa	I don't like it.    But as a name, isn't it spelt "Honor"?    But I'm English, so I go crazy if I see it spelt without the "u"!|`|4ilM2hCwaa	There is also Honora and Honoria|`|2LwPUoOvaa	Great name, thats the name of Jessica Alba's daughter.  Honor Marie Alba.  Good luck with the baby!|`|qUS9Zwl6aa	Normally I'd say no. But ever since Jessica Alba named her daughter that, it's been kinda catchy to me. I prefer it as Honor though.|`|a7yQGSX6aa	Terrible.I think you should have common names such as Lucy ,Alice or Susan.|`|AA11265535	It's a good name. But if your child ever comes to the United States then her name would be spelled without the U.      EDIT: When I think of the name Honor I don't think of Alba. I think of some other "famous" people. There is this one family who owns an online/catalogue magazine buisness that is pretty popular where I live. They sell books, dolls, tapes, and stuff.|`|Vf6SJPcqaa	I like it. But you need to consider it as a middle name. Cause nicknames would be rough on her. But I prefer it spelled with a "u" better. It makes it more unique. But maybe something sweet for the first name. Like Storm Honour. or River. or Lynn.|`|T0CTrqNhaa	I dont mind it as a middle name spelt 'Honor', but im afraid not as a first name. It just dosent sound right to me.
33h5R8nTaa	My daughter has really dry legs and we use baby oil after bath time and it works great they dont look dry anymore just feel and thats a big improvment because they looked like her skin was peeling and i think the lotion burns cause she would scream every time we put on it. maybe you daughter has eggsama, thats common in children.|`|rUPjr7hjaa	My midwife suggested olive oil to me.  I haven't tried it yet, but I will.|`|IngripgMaa	You could try Olive Oil.  Also, The Body Shop has a baby line....they have worked great for us.|`|wHVx9HZVaa	Try chamomile in her bath water. It is the best for all dry skin conditions including eczema. Brew the teabags (just a couple) and  tip in the bath water. Do this with every bath she has.  The only other thing I would suggest is to make sure the water is not too warm.|`|u0mZAPuDaa	Cut back on bath time  Slather on the moisturizer  Don't let salt or chlorine dry on his skin  Keep your child well hydrated  Run a humidifier  Protect your child from the elements  http://www.babycenter.com/0_dry-skin_685...    :)|`|WI5KmVRdaa	your baby might have ezema my son has it and it have the same symptoms as your baby is having they sell ezema baby wash and lotion at walmart and other places and if that doesnt work go see the pediatricion|`|UIS8Wll1aa	Its probably exsma i don't know how to spell it but, that what it sounds like you can get cream from doctor discuss it with your doctor good luck|`|tR68GcI6aa	Eczema could be the cause, but it could just be dry skin. Try Eucerin cream. It's expensive, but it's the best. I have suffered with chronic dry skin and Eczema since childhood and that stuff works wonders. When you get her out of the bath pat her dry, don't rub away all the water. Immediately put lots of lotion on. Throughout the day you should continue to lather her with lotion as well. Hope this helps!|`|9ebe04169d04d9c952a946440b3ad139aa	Olive oil is really good for dry skin in babies, don't use any baby products on her, she could have an allergy to one of the ingredients, however "natural" they say they are. Hydrocortisone cream is only used on such young children if they have been formally diagnosed with a skin condition such as eczema, if this was the case, your doctor should have told you. Just use plain cooking olive oil, the cheapest will do, and massage her gently all over. Be careful though, it will make her very slippery to hold! If the dry skin starts to crack or she is in distress because it is itching or painful, go back to your doctor. If he gives her any creams, ask him or the pharmacist exactly what they are and what results you can expect.|`|g0xjN9E6aa	My cousin's son had terrible dry skin and was told by the doctor to put Aquafor on it. It seemed to help. I also have been told to use this (by my Dr.) around my daughter's nose because it was getting very dry - it went away after I used it.|`|WdW1ga14aa	Have you tried Johnson & Johnson Melt Away Stress, I have dry skin especially in the winter months and that works well for me and it is not to expensive.    Good luck to you!
d6e11chxaa	I love it! Cecilia is so pretty and feminine. It sounds similar to trendy names, like Amelia, Olivia, and Sophia, but stands out. I think Jade is a bit trendy for my taste, but it does sound nice. June might make a more unusual, sweet sounding middle name choice. If you want something a bit wilder, Cecilia Juniper or Cecilia Juno are kind of cool. For nicknames, I knew a Cecilia that went by Ceci (said seh-SEE).    Have you thought about Cecily as a first name, too? It's a bit more modern sounding, if you like that sort of thing.|`|3paE1E9Xaa	i personally don't like it|`|KYyP8Dtraa	I love Cecelia!!    Cecelia Whitney is my favorite    Cecelia Jade is cute as well|`|qUS9Zwl6aa	It's cute and not a name you hear that often.    Cecilia Jane is adorable|`|ZvASEWHPaa	I love it. I think it's a beautiful name. It also has some nickname options, like Lia, Cissa, Cis, Cecil, Cee, Ceil, Ceila, Celia, Celie, Silke, Cissie and Cici (Lia is my favorite out of them).|`|b4J5jE7naa	cecilia jade is really cute|`|3c51ba3982b4a0fa984f838020963690aa	It can be pretty, it's an old name, usually the nickname would be CeCe or CC.  CJ makes me think of a guy/boy.  And though Cecilia's an old name, it's one of those that does make me think of Celiac disease or something biological.  I know, associations!
cbfb39e3aab3b803822e39f849209291aa	Im having the same as you at the moment i was due last friday after a 26 day cycle as yet nothing although i been feeling like i was going to come on all week and been having cramps on and off for over two weeks now.  Getting a lot of discharge too but i have done tests and all say negative so not sure what to say really. Also had a really bad face break out too, i going to wait a few days see what happens it may just be a late AF.  Good luck though|`|1CryEnb3aa	Have you taken a hpt?  You can at this point.  If neg wait and retest.  Or just go to the dr and get a blood test.  Sounds like you very well may be pregnant.  Or, could be a urinary tract infection.  Does your urine smell?  Hurt to pee?  If, no, go with the first part of my answer.  Good luck and hope you get a BFP!!!:)|`|aB2zSt6Vaa	It sounds like AF was due by now. Have you tested? The months when I swore we were successful in conceiving, I had tons of symptoms like spotting and sore BBS. But finally when we got our BFP, I felt fine the whole time! Only a little tired. So don't read too much into your symptoms, it's amazing how much you pay attention to your body when you're in tune with it and trying to make a baby. Also between Jan 14th and 18th you had sex 3 times, which is good chances for baby!
be5076c0b98b495ffe00aade08f96b65aa	Why are you waiting? Just because your nervous isn't going to change the outcome of the test. Better to take it, find out, and know for sure, then wait and be nervous. No your breasts do not have to be sore. Mine weren't for my second pregnancy, and with my first they didn't start getting sore until about 5 or 6 weeks. Your period may be just delayed, but if your two days late, I would just take a test. The more you stress, the more you can delay your period.|`|koENUKhFaa	nope. your breasts does not have to be sore. But there is a good chance that you might be pregnant since u are late. Actually why don't u take the pregnancy test now. So u will know for sure if u are pregnant?|`|LyatdgVZaa	Ok, your breasts don't have to be sore for you to be pregnant. Best advice?    Wait. Breathe. Go to the nearest free clinic and get a pregnancy test done.     Best of luck to you either way|`|uugMjx9yaa	true true  just because you're 2 days late dont mean you're pregnant  maybe ur body is adapting to you being sexually active now and   that is why your period hasnt started
GWQwsH1Baa	It's the same...except make sure you point "it" down while changing the diaper. And if he is circumcised you have to put some jelly stuff on "it" when changing for the first week...but that's about it!|`|tQw6EDspaa	I'd think it would be easier taking care of a boy. Make sure you wipe front to back like a girl so he doesn't get a urinary tract infection.  Also, don't circumcise him and never pull back the foreskin ever!    I also think boys are less fussy than girls.    You'll be fine, relax! :)|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I have a son but I spent a lot of time taking care of my niece when she was an infant.  Basically the only difference is that you need to just accept in advance with a boy that:  You will get peed on.|`|nmu6coapaa	Its really not that different apart from the fact that you will definitely get peed on, but you wont mind!
LiPoEBenaa	It's a waste of money. You're better off just using a free chinese gender calendar online. Intelligender is said to be right 50% of the time... well that would make since since you have a 50/50 shot of having a boy or a girl. I would just wait for your 20wk ultrasound and go from there :)  Good luck and congrats on the pregnancy!|`|a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	I actually never heard of it so I looked it up. I thought it would be a good idea until I saw the price! $34.95 plus shipping! Wow, just wait until your ultrasound. Plus with it being only 82% accurate, you might not want to try it just in case it is wrong.|`|jC1Mdsefaa	Depends...   Do you want to do it for FUN? Would you get made if it came up wrong?  It says 90% if you have the money, and its just something to do for fun then sure..    I did mine a week ago, said girl... I find out the 17th what im having    The problem with all these ppl getting false boys, is because they arent mixing it right.  You HAVE GOT TO follow the directions COMPLETLY to get the right answer!!!  Good luck!      Check Ebay, I hear they are on there cheap..
B4t1ayV7aa	I found out on a regular sonogram at 15wks 5days I was having a boy with my first one.Let me know how it turns out I was wanting to get one at 16wks because I really want to know too.And I have never had a 4D sonogram.Hope this helps..Good Luck|`|T48smu01aa	IS LONG AS SHE/HE SPREADS THERE LEGS YOU CAN TELL THAT EARLY!|`|phwivaqNaa	I havent heard of private places doing a 4D ultrasound that early.  I would wait a bit, especially how expensive they are.    They can tell the sex at 15 weeks, but it is not a sure thing yet due to development.  Anyone who says they were correct at that stage had a 50/50 shot anyways.  My doctor wouldnt even do my ultrasound before 21-22 weeks because everything is more developed and accurate at that point.  Of course, the 4D is for fun but you still want it to be as accurate as possible.      It is much more common for you to be wrongly told it is a girl because of "parts" hiding.      I feel you anticipation!!!!!  But, you dont want to get your hopes up if they tell you its a girl than later a boy.    Good Luck|`|PLK1p8cUaa	If you clearly saw last time at 16 wks then you already know the answer to your question, there maybe a possibility you will be able to tell this time.  With a girl there will be three lines visible.  Most private places will offer you a free return visit if you are not able to see the gender, ask before you pay.   Gender visibility is best after 28 weeks.   Good luck.|`|LiPoEBenaa	It's a little early to tell and from experience the 4Du/s work best between 28-32 weeks because of the volume of amniotic fluid. I really hope you aren't paying out of pocket for that! As those can be quite pricey! I had a 4d done at 17wks and it didn't turn out well. Luckily my doctor got a new machine and was trying it out on me so I didn't have to pay.|`|eDnWMm3maa	they MIGHT be able to tell the gender.    Is this a privately done ultrasound or one through your doctor? If you're paying out of pocket for a private one, the ideal time is between 29 and 31 weeks.    4D is simply a motion picture of a 3D ultrasound.|`|OmdrwDcjaa	No, it's very possible to tell that early.
Zgs4RncIaa	No NOT unusal at all. To each their own.    You might change your mind down the road, don't let anyone convince you that its "a natural thing for all women to have children" because that isn't true.     Stick to your guns!|`|AjFA8qIxaa	Of course it is and don't let anybody tell you otherwise or make you feel bad about it.  It's your decision and who are they to tell you what to do with your life. You don't go running around telling them not to have kids,right? Just tell them hey i respect your decision, so please respect mine.     And yes you can be sure at the age of 25. However if you ever change your mind ( lets say someone comes along and you might feel different about it then) you can, no one says hey you need to make up your mind right now!    At last everyone knows that there are a lot of mothers out there who shouldn't have kids. At least you know what you want.  And a dealbreaker? Well yeah if you are with a guy that really wants to have kids then yeah you are not meant to be. There are enough men out there who feel like you though.    Either way you are perfectly normal...lol|`|hY0cb2xRaa	I think it is too early ti make decision like that.. I am not sure what makes you think the same .. I have 2 and they are wonderful and very loving.. Their smiles and laugh make my day :)     Be around kids would make you realise how fun they are. .and kids are lving if you "handle with care" and give them lot of love :)|`|WxoZrTPlaa	It may be little unusual, but not abnormal.  I know a women who don't plan to have children.  I always wanted to have children and know that if I didn't have them, it would have been a terrible regret.  However, now that I do have them (and love them dearly and wouldn't trade any of them for the world), I can see how you could have a very rewarding life without them.|`|pS02JGTUaa	i think thats normal, some people just dont want kids.  its fine (:    i think that you can be sure at twenty five, cause you are an adult and junk.  and it might be with some people, but theres people out there just liek you that dont want kids (:|`|VHHis05Naa	It is normal and you can lead a very happy life without children if this is the life you want.  There are many books out there on the subject.  It definitely could be a relationship breaker if you are with someone who wants children.  I would never judge someone for choosing not to have children, just the people who have them and don't want them.   Good luck to you and I'm glad you are being honest with yourself.|`|EpCuEvvdaa	i dont know   im 14 and crazy about it i would have kids tomorow but its not hapending    if u had a kid and did not love it after the first week  i would adopt it|`|4TNavgDuaa	Its normal not to want them and sometimes its good for some people not to have them. I have a friends who is all about her self and is into her body, works out all the time she is 30 and been married for 7 years and her and her husband dont want any and we cant picture her having any.  Give it sometime you might change or mind if not than it doesnt make you not normal.|`|2SZuyzL0aa	I think it is normal.  In this day and age it is not a bad thing to not have kids.  Would the child have a good life if it was looked at as a burden? It wouldn't be good for either one of you....    Sadly it probably would be a relationship breaker, but then that person isn't for you. You will find someone who wants the same thing as you and you will be happy.|`|ltfeYdr5aa	I was NEVER having kids....right up until I met my husband. We were engaged in 2 weeks married in 6 mths and pregnant in 8 and now  2 on the way.     I never trusted anyone with my future until I met my husabnd so I think you have to take in to consideration if your situation will change.|`|AA11481889	I think it's perfectly normal to "THINK" you don't want kids...because I was you about 5 years ago...    I never thought I wanted kids, I would talk about how the world is such a crappy place and we're over populated already and blah blah blah...all the while purchasing small lap dogs and treating them like surrogate children.    As it turns out...I did want kids...I just didn't know it.    I don't think anyone can be "sure" of anything at ANY age...much less at age 25.  I was an idiot when I was 25...no offense...it's just true...you're young, and you have very little life experience to work with...so I wouldn't carve anything in stone just yet.    I had my son when I was 33 and up until I was about 31 I swore I didn't want kids...and now that he's here...I wonder why I waited so long.      He's the best thing that ever happened to me.    So long story short...You may think you don't want kids, you may actually even feel in your heart that you're not built for it, but never say never....    And as for your last question...of course it's a relationship breaker.  Children are a HUGE deal.  And they are life altering.  And they are a life long commitment....of course they would have a huge impact on any relationship.|`|JOPdlbMBaa	u can say i dont want now but i may change my idea later. thats what i always say because at different ages peaple have different ideas about what they want...
auUeI2Vnaa	There is a good chance you could be pregnant.  Sometimes, when your "prego" hormones aren't real strong yet, they'll cause a light line, instead of a bold line.    You'll have to take another.|`|GtFJVg0oaa	It means go to the free clinic-|`|E2h4QuxKaa	You're pregnant.  Even if it's light, it's a sign of the horomone being detected, though it may not be much of it yet.  The box should tell you that....yes honey, you are 100% positively pregnant!  Congratualtions I hope!|`|1bcYl6SKaa	Spend the extra 5 bucks and get Clearblue Easy.  I had the same problems, the line that made a + was very light.  Clearblue easy is so simple to read, it is digital.  it will say 'Pregnant' or 'Not Pregnant'  Just like that    No mistake in reading there|`|Oon31342aa	If the plus is showing up even just a little bit you may be barely pregnant. Wait a few days and take another test.|`|IqDVt4ZFaa	If they were both minus thats a negative result.|`|5oiwo0Btaa	Pregnancy tests can be very confusing, I would go back to the store and get another (possibly multiple others?) and do it again.|`|OKzGWQRPaa	It's probably best to call their help line which is usually on the box.  They know their product best.|`|NdrO7u79aa	It means that you may or may not be pregnant. Congratulations!|`|7VfWz7zyaa	Read the instructions.    If you still don't understand buy a new one.|`|AA11607385	Make another test.|`|vwuMTm7Saa	You're pregnant!|`|qOBYfdlBaa	If the other minus was light it doesn't matter....2 minus = negative|`|mYhuGonfaa	Is it THAT hard to take another test? Take it with first-morning urine so it will come up with stronger results. And if it is unclear, coming to YA to ask what it means is not going to solve the problem. You need to either take another one or go to a doc. Or you could just always wait until your belly starts popping out.|`|90zcKChJaa	Didn'y the test come with instructions?|`|AA10390690	tad confusing on the wording...|`|VN8kBnuRaa	Well, my first pregnancy I had a EPT test and it did that.   So my fiancee went and bought me another one and I took it and sure enough I was pregnant.  You might want to buy a different brand and try again.  It's also best to take the pregnancy test FIRST thing in the morning.|`|505c28ffab4b949ab353bc9f3870e311aa	whether faint or dark... what it is showing it what it is.|`|a280cc1b0751df0fe9a3f19e7c0be347aa	retake it or just go to your doctor|`|6juYbfUVaa	you are not pregnant cause the minus sign was bold|`|A8k9NHigaa	definatley take another test, try clearblue digital|`|d76b933acafc2fee8fc3c072d2e15141aa	take another test-pee on it longer|`|tjbXw3p8aa	It means you arent pregnent  You had two minus'|`|lsODR7A0aa	That has happened to me before and I wasn't pregnant. If you look at the test before you take it you can see both lines faintly. The bold line is the one to go by.|`|g7gvzhkpaa	a pregnancy test can only tell you if your pregnant or not ,not okay or not take another test a better one or go to a clinic/doctor|`|tlRsaq8Kaa	Take another test, i suggest the electronic EPT ones, they are blunt and just say yes or no, its a little bit more expensive but way worth it|`|Ty6vGEj9aa	Drink lots of Sunny D- and take another. It ain't an etch-a-sketch, you know.|`|ffAmoqFTaa	Well it could mean a lot of things, I would go buy another test just so that you aren't confused.  The digital ones work the best, then you don't have to question if you read it right.  Good luck!
JP2h62qiaa	Infantino makes some pretty simple ones. I see them at walmart.  I picked out the fabric for mine at walmart and just made it. So much cheaper than buying one.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	There are none with a 3 or 5 point harness because there is no way to safely attach such a harness to the cart.  The sole purpose of the belt on the cart is to try to prevent a child from standing.  It is not there to protect the child if they fall.    You can get shopping cart covers at second hand shops, freecycle, and craigslist because many parents get them and find them completely useless.|`|DaeE2aMhaa	walmart does........... go to walmart.com click on baby  then on health and safety and theres one for 20 bucks its cute too and they have free shipping to a walmart near you|`|Ph3sh6Goaa	If shopping cart covers are so much "a waste of money", then how come they sell so great? DUH. Just because YOUR kid didn't do well in them doesn't mean they are a waste of money. To each his own. If you want your kid sitting in some nasty, dirty, drooled-on shopping cart seat, go ahead. I prefer that my child be in a cart cover.     Walmart has a great one for only $20.00. They are well worth the money.     And I have NEVER seen a cart cover for sale on craigslist (for my city/state).|`|aLAmvX5Naa	They sell basic cart covers for under $20 in most grocery stores. All of the ones I shop at do. Just go to Target or Walmart and look at the ones they have. Take them out of the package and try them on the cart.    A shopping cart cover won't entertain your child for long. My daughter is 14 months old and has no interest in things like that. She's busy reaching for stuff on the shelf, playing with food in the basket, and waving to people like she's in a pageant.|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	I bought one..i thought..oh boy,  i dont have to put little man in that nasty cart now...ha,,i found it MUCh easier to just wipe the buggy down wit h a disinfectant wipe (supplied by our wal mart, but you can take some in your purse if they dont have them there)  and pop him in the seat. he never paid attention to the colors, or the toys attached to it, it was a BIG headache getting it in there so he fit in it and i could snap him in, that was almost impossible, i highly recommend saving your money and just  buying the  small packs of wipes for your purse.    thats right louise,,,to each their own, so answer your own and move along. i guess youre one of those who think only  your OPINION is the correct  one.|`|54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	I know they sell them at Wal Mart but I am unsure of the details on them.|`|gyYXV3Bxaa	I just bought this one today:    http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...
7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	Depends on how long its been in the condom, and if it is still on his penis or not?  Read the box of condoms to see if there is spermicide.  Not all have them|`|tu7aqUoxaa	outside/no, if the condom bust, the spermicide would meet with your eggs because it kills the sperm cells
3URupc7caa	Best thing to do is wait till you have your ultrasound done because they can tell you how far along you are.|`|YnzCyaWuaa	I get Sep 29th so I am not sure.  COngrats|`|QCVzUC1baa	I just did a search on askamum.co.uk and it came back with a due date of 26.09.09.  You will find out your due date at your first scan.  Good Luck|`|ba11762437a3276bc8acfec56128a271aa	I would say the 26th of September. When you have your first prenatal appt they should be able to tell you. Especially since you found out so early in your pregnancy. They usually like to see you around 8-12 weeks for the first appt. Have you scheduled yet? Also.. the growth of the baby can always vary during your nine months so they say that anywhere from 38 to 42 weeks is full term. Good Luck and Congrats!|`|FTW82Wumaa	Your doctor should give you a more accurate date based not only on your LMP but also on your first ultrasound (how big the baby and the gestational sac measures).     I would be 9 weeks based on my LMP but I am actually only 8 weeks 1 day because of the size of the baby and the sac. Also, my blood work lined up with 8 weeks not 9.|`|tZfkPQF6aa	I used this site http://pregnancy.about.com/cs/pregnancyc...  and got the 26th.    Congratulations|`|215dfe0c283eb141a2ed0b4dcb32274caa	Due to having a longer cycle than average your due date will be a little later than those calendars that base it off 28 day cycles.

AA11612508	yes. i really think he should do this. he would mostlikely be out of bootcamp before babys born. if you are planning on getting married, do it before hand. then the minute he gets to his base that he will work at, you will apply for housing and you will get free house, free medical, food allowance.  I am promilitary for families. they take care of you.  what are you thinking, let him go now while the babys in your tummy and then once hes outta boot camp and babys here you lifes will be much much much better than before.  oh yea, and the signing bonuses. you get money for signing up, you get money for college, you get free housing, (i had awesome housing!!!!) food allowance, we got about 250 month, commissary (cheap grocery store for only military members, free medical. that baby would be completely 100% free to have!! you and him both would lhave free medical until the day he gets out! plus you get to travel. he gets to travel much more than the other parent. but you see places you would have never seen.    i cant say this more, dont tell him not to!!!!!!!!!!|`|2TMbpYWnaa	I am not a mom or expecting, but a friend of mine did go into the marines expecting to get a lot of financial help with his family and help with school after he was done with his service.  A lot of empty promises were made and he did not get any help with school and is now dealing with psychological issues that are very possibly related to his service and gets no medical help through the marines for that, so all of that money he got is really just going towards therapy.  Was it worth it, i don't know.  its just the story i have heard from him.|`|ba11762437a3276bc8acfec56128a271aa	I can completely understand where you are coming from here. I have 2 daughters, and am getting married in just 2 weeks. My soon to be husband has been in the military for 7 years now. I will tell you a few pros and cons. First of all... I don't know about the marines. Its almost like they are brain washed. My fiances brother was a marine, and he is completely military... marines come before anything, including his family. Now my fiance.. is in the National Guard, and it has been a great experience for him. He is actually considering going active army and moving us to a base. On base, you would be surprised how many other young couples there are. It seems as if all of them are between 19 and 23, and if he ever had to be deployed, you would have all those other wives to help you out and to understand what you're going through. Its like a close family. Also... military benefits are something you can't beat... they are great, and you get good pay. My fiance is being deployed for his second time in April, and I am having a really hard time with it because we have two very young girls. I almost wish he would have gone active, so that I could be on base with other people that are going through the same things. Anyway, we're getting married so that I can have the military benefits as well, which is something that you might consider. Otherwise, they will only provide benefits for the baby once it is born. I'm sure he's just thinking of you and that baby, and he is trying to do right by you guys in getting you into a better situation before the baby arrives. I would however talk to him about what branch of the military he goes in to. The marines are pretty hardcore and it will mean being away from you quite a bit... and you will probably end up taking a back seat to his career. Army is very family oriented, and I've had positive experiences with the national guard. Its just that one weekend a month, two weeks a year. He can go active and have a career with them, or he can have a civilian job and only be a weekend warrior. Its extra money every month, and the benefits that you can't really get at any other job, especially with todays problems. I could go on and on about this, if you would like to know more about it you can email me, spoiled_lovell_brat@yahoo.com I would be happy to answer any more questions or anything. Don't try to talk him out of it, but make sure he understands what he's getting into, and that he researches the different branches to see what fits him best. Other than that, I think military is one of the most respectible jobs someone can do. Be proud of him.. .and make sure he knows you're behind him no matter what! Good luck!|`|rdpZrBc9aa	I think you should talk to the recruiter together, then talk it over by yourselves, and think about it for a little while.  You also need to talk to someone who's been in a while, besides the recruiter.  If he does go, you don't want to wait too long.  You don't want him to be in boot camp when the baby's due.  It's not necessarily true, like someone said, that you wouldn't be together after that.  It depends on where he's stationed.      The military does have good benefits.  Would the two of you be prepared to move to wherever he's stationed?  How well do both of you cope with new experiences?  How independent can you be if he is sent to a combat zone or hardship station where they don't allow dependents?      My husband was in the Navy while we were dating, and since then has been in the Navy Reserve and the Air National Guard.  We're beginning to look forward to his retirement.  We have many military friends, also.  If you have more questions, feel free to contact me through Yahoo Answers.  I'm not comfortable with posting my email address for all to see.|`|AA11210211	Well first and foremost you have to think of the baby,The marines or any branch of the military isn't really very family oriented if they wanted you to have a family the would have issued you one,Granted yes there is always pay,housing and insurance but on the other hand he may be gone all the time,I say if he really wants to do this then let him do it you should support him in what he wants to do as long as it isn't life threatening,The military does have good things about it as I stated above also you get money for college,so it is good in ways.|`|MtC3CWZraa	I have no way to tell you whats right for your relationship. The two of you will have to sit down and talk this all out.     Something youll really want to consider is marriage if he does enlist. Otherwise, once hes stationed somewhere, you wont be able to live with him.|`|PN7ELn3aaa	Let him do it. It is a scary, hard decision but GOOD FOR HIM for being so mature and supportive. With the economy the way it is and for how young you two are the military will offer you the best possible situation for setting up your future.     You will have great benefits for the baby (insurance!!!) and he will have the training and experience necessary to get a good job.     You will be so grateful five years down the road. Trust me! :)|`|vcxdTXbraa	Being a marine wife myself I understand your feelings. It is scarey. My hubby joined out of highschool.His family and I tried to talk him out of it but his mind was made up and now I am glad he he joined. If you have questions about anything go to talk to the local recruiter. The Marine Corp is a differnt lifestyle but it is so worth it. Being a military family can be very rewarding. And you will not get rich with the military but there will always be a roof over your head and a steady paycheck.|`|94464c65a3cf331abd994f1207860d7eaa	If it's what he wants, it can be INCREDIBLY beneficial - but I would urge a compromise.    If he truly wants to go into the military - consider a US-stationed branch, like the Coast Guard. My best friend's fiance is in the process of enlisting in the USCG - all the benefits, discipline and rewards of being in the military, but he will be stationed INSIDE the US, and tours of duty at sea are rarely if ever over 3 months long.     It could be a wonderful compromise and the best of both worlds for you.|`|nzgZR6onaa	My father was an officer in the Navy and he missed a lot.My moms pregnancy and the first few years of my childhood. Unless your bf is enlisting because he really wants to serve his country and is very into country first then I would say he needs to think this through more.If at all possible having 2 loving supportive parents that are there is more important than all the money in the world.|`|eO4y3m1maa	Thats actually a REALLY good idea, medicial benefits are great...the money is secure....day care is cheap.....he doesn't have to stay in it for the rest of his life either.    With the economy being the way it is, its a good idea.  Since you guys have a kid together, you can go where he goes (except iraq)|`|DutTBV3caa	when my husband (well was fiance at the time) enlisted he only got $2,000. not really a lot these days. anyways if you're married you'll get separation pay.  but i know a few guys whose relationships were ruined because they enlisted but then again some relationships lasted it just takes work.  make sure hes enlisting because thats what he wants not just for the money! its a lot of hard work and a lot of time apart. my husband had been dreaming about being a marine since he was a little boy and i really dont think its how he thought itd be.    also his recruiter screwed him out of a lot of money and lied to him about a lot of things.   just make sure you talk it out, its what he really wants, and you research it really really well!|`|Mzu9bHbmaa	All you have to do is ask him one question:  -Is he fine with the idea that he might die in action? Is he OK with leaving the baby without a father and a mother that doesn't make enough to support her? That is a very real possibility in the arm forces at times like these.|`|F0kjf1j8aa	When it comes down to it only he can decide to join the marines, of course no one wants anyone they care about to leave and go to a place where they can get hurt or even worse never see them again, he sounds like a great guy willing to risk everything for you and your baby, but know this even if he stays you will get by and it may be very financially hard, but with faith and love you will make it  there is alot of ways to help you such as financial aid /public aid food stamps and wic that may help him understand that even if he stays you will make it together, I know I have 4 children and not alot of money at all and we always get by, so just talk to him about how you feel and ways to make it without him leaving

2d281c378a62cabf9789c151186cae74aa	First, make sure you talk to your son's doctor.  Some boys have physical or psychological barriers to potty training.  If you push it and he has one of these disorders it can delay potty training even more.  My son had a disorder that made it so hard to get to the  2 potty training and the more we pushed the worse it got until I got over my embarrassment and talked to the doc about it!  He was almost 6 before we solved the problem.  I can tell you from experience that getting upset-DOES NOT HELP at all.      So try to relax, talk to the doctor and make sure he or she takes your concerns seriously and gives you solutions- its their job- so if they don't find a doctor who will.  If i would've had this advice I would've had a much easier time of it.      One last thing, DO NOT let anyone make you feel badly that your son isn't potty trained yet.  Every child moves at their own pace and good for you for not forcing the issue.  People who think they are the potty training police make me nauseous!|`|NwTggQ2Baa	I am in the middle of potty training my 2 year old twins. When they do this, I do not yell or get totally upset, i just let them know that I am sad they didn't use the potty. I say, " It is okay that you had an accident, but you need to try to use the potty because that makes me very happy! And it makes me sad when you pee/poop on the floor/in underwear." And when I have to use the bathroom I take my girls in the bathroom with me and show them how easy and "fun" it is to use the potty. For your son, have your husband take him in the bathroom when your husband is home.  Potty Training is hard! I hope everything works out    Stacey|`|d43e96506445ef1b6b4ace4380a9a5b4aa	try Cheerios as targets for him to sink. at 4 he should be able to stand up at the big potty with a stool. then again at 4 he should be trained unless there is something slowing his progress.|`|i7oGjwJBaa	it sounds like he just isn't ready or interested.  if you wait until the child really wants to do it - they won't have accidents at all really.  we let my daughter wear panties when she felt like it, at home, and she'd use the potty.. but if she had an accident she would ask for diapers.  we praised her for pottying, but never tried to talk her into doin it when she wasnt comfortable doing it that day.  we talked her up for a few weeks before turning 3 - we told her they dont make diapers for 3 year olds  ;)   on her 3rd birthday - we threw out all diapers and went straight to all panties.  she was so excited about turning 3 and being in panties for good - we only had probably 5 accidents total, and they were all at night.|`|weE5FxCfaa	is he developmentally delayed?  if not why is he still not trained?  i would have this looked into.  4 is  getting to the age where you might be concerned about his progress.  if all of this checks out then could be that he is not interested for some other reason that you are not aware of.  ask him why he doesn't want to go on the potty.  at 4 he should understand what he is supposed to do and be able to tell you why he doesn't want to.|`|Fy9S6hjIaa	I have two answers for you.    If your son is developmentaly delayed they your definatly doing right.  Keep on track with the positive reinforcement.  Try putting a bowl of candy in the bathroom counter and letting him take his pick each time he goes in the toilet.  Always do lotsof cheering and clapping and dancing when he does go.  Let him watch his dad go potty and encourage your son to cheer and clap for him.  Make sure he know that its a GOOD thing to go pee pee in the potty.  I would also suggest getting a seat that sits on top of the potty.  A 4 year old might be a litle big for a potty chair.  It also might make him understand going on the potty better if he's going on the same potty that you do.  Good Luck!    Now, my second answer is for if your son is not developmentally delayed.  In this case the child really needs some tough love.  Make him stay on the toilet until he goes.  With my son the longest he's sat on the toilet was 1 hour and 43 minutes, but he's a very stubborn one-year-old.  Once he sat there that one time for that long, he understood that I was serious and more stubborn than he was and the process has been alot easier since.  You also should reprimand him when he wets his pants.  I'm not talking spankings and time outs yet, just let him know that he is NOT to pee pee in his undies.  Make him understand that that is a big no no. In a month if your still having accidents you probably need to start diciplining him for them.  Make him have a time out everytime he potties in his pants.  It may be extra motivation for you to remember that under most circumstance kids cannot start school unless they are potty trained, and it is required that children start school when they are five.  If he isn't potty trained fully by then you will have to home school him and possibly face CPS investigaitons if the reason's you are not sending him to public school come to light.
n3PE2lvDaa	hes a big boy. My daughter was last weighed about a month ago (7 months at the time) and she was 16pounds. Shes a chubby girl but I was suprised to find her weight is pretty average. I wouldnt worry about it though. Hes a baby hes allowed to be chubby. Once he gets more active he will burn if off. Some babies are just bigger then others. Maybe he has big bones? or is tall for his age?  EDIT. I might have that wrong maybe my daughter was 18 pounds at her last weigh in. She was 8kgs anyway what ever that is. Either 16 pounds or 18.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	nope- he's probably the right size for him. it also depends on birthweight too. my son was 18 pounds at 10 months but he's always been little since birth|`|wphLaVs6aa	No, it doesn't mean he's fat at all. The weight ranges on clothing vary from brand to brand. And babies vary widely in size. It sounds like your baby is healthy, which is great!|`|f5yUbagpaa	your baby is fine he is not over wait he is just bigger than normal but it's okay that means nothing he's a baby which means he is allowed to be chubby he is very much healthy don't worry!!|`|0bX3uZ3Baa	he's not fat at all. my older daughter hit 20 lbs at one month. it all depends on the baby. don't ever go by the months size...go by the lbs size.

WPI0Z47saa	My son had this done. He was put under because he was a year old. The dr said they usually put them under after a month old since they have to stay still. He had it done in the hospital only because he needed anesthesia if none is used it can be done in the Dr's office. He came home a little sleepy, took a np and then woke up like nothing happened at all. I was scared that he would be in pain. I gave him tylenol just in case but honestly I don't think he even needed that. And finally yes his eye is better. No more yellow discharge and his eye doesn't look more closed than the other one now. My son was under general anesthesia 3 times and he just turned 3. he has never had any problems. I was terrified. He was a trooper. No complications at all. Hope this helps.  Good luck and it really will be ok.|`|ReQ4mUpdaa	A friend at church had to take her child to have this done. The child was put under. It was an out-patient procedure. The child was tired and that was pretty much it. I saw them the next day and he was fine. This is a pretty typical procedure so I wouldn't be scared. There was a video on the hospital website about it that you could watch. I'll see if I can find it for you.|`|AA10546011	Two of my grandchildren had this surgery and they were both put under general anesthesia.    The surgery was quick and effective.
GxlkhRfoaa	Well here's my opinion...  They say you shouldn't eat deli meat unless it is heated until the point of steam coming off of it.  Why?  Because you might get sick.  But how many times have you gotten sick from deli meat?  When you are pregnant everyone want you to be EXTREMELY careful.  Just use common sense.  If the cookie dough has not made you sick before then I wouldn't worry about it.  As long as it doesn't have any ingredients in it your not aloud to have I'd say dig in.|`|6juYbfUVaa	Its fine, you can eat many things|`|coFWlptOaa	If it has eggs in it, you are risking salmonella. And bacteria can grown on flower.     It would be safer to cook it untill you give birth.|`|f2ae56134c701bec40583a856d15ba10aa	Many of the canned products, rolls, pizza dough and cookie dough, are made from pasteurized eggs. This would me them safe. It is the raw or unpasteurized eggs that would make them unsafe. So read the labels. :)|`|a169a0735b83b7ed12f616a7190a2202aa	The only reason I would say it's not okay is because of the raw eggs.  That can be harmful to the baby.    But ask your doc just in case.|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	The concern is the raw eggs. Raw eggs are potentially hazardous because they can serve as sources of harmful bacteria, including Salmonella, which can cause serious illness.    However, dough that is made safely with pasteurized eggs or pasteurized liquid egg products can be consumed raw safely. Many commercially available cookie dough products are made with these ingredients.    ADDED: the reason they have you take extra precautions when you are pregnant is bc IF you were to get sick, you could yourself could beat the illness but it can also cause your body to miscarry or go into preterm labor.  Sure, it is rare that people get sick from eating deli meats or raw eggs, but if they do, they take some medicine, spend some time near the toilet and get over it. But if you are pregnant, you could lose your baby. That is why they want pregnant women to be more careful.|`|LiPoEBenaa	I wouldn't suggest eating it because of the raw eggs that's in it. It's a hazard due to salmonella poisoning which can be nasty and not good for you or the baby. Things you may also want to also steer clear from are sushi or lunch meat due to being raw or poorly processed. You can hold out for just a few months right??|`|f0e6bb08f78bda5965b94f88de6064f6aa	No it's not a good thing.  All the dough's you have mentioned all contain raw eggs, which at some point could give you salmonella whether your pregnant or not.  This can be especially dangerous when your pregnant.
GxlkhRfoaa	I pretty much had to get new pants as soon as I found out I was pregnant.  I don't know if it was mental or what.  But the pressure on my abdomen made me have to pee and it hurt.

(detta Roberta), ho trentanni ed abito ad Angri (SA), ho tre figli , due femmine di 6 e 4 anni ed un maschietto di due anni. Quando  nato Francesco, cos si chiama il bambino, non avevo nemmeno il coraggio di guardarlo in faccia per il rimorso, perch per ben due volte avevo tentato di abortirlo. Nel dicembre del 2002, pur prendendo la pillola, mi accorsi di essere rimasta incinta. Allora andai a parlare con il mio medico di base, perch avevo fatto una cura per la bronchite a base di Rocefin e Bentelan, lui mi disse che il bambino poteva avere problemi e che la mia era una gravidanza a rischio. Tanto poteva andare bene, tanto poteva andare male, stava a me decidere: portare avanti la gravidanza oppure no. Se volevo fare laborto lo dovevo fare subito, perch il bambino non era formato. Allora io mi decisi per laborto e lui mi fece il certificato per lospedale. Cos io andai a prenotarmi e feci tutti gli accertamenti per poter interrompere la gravidanza. In quei giorni non facevo che piangere al pensiero che uccidevo un bambino, che comunque non aveva colpa. Il medico mi aveva detto che era un grumo di sangue, ma una signora mi fece vedere un foglietto, dove si vedeva che il bambino a due mesi era tutto formato. Cercai consiglio da una mia parente e da unamica, ma invece del conforto sperato, mi dissero che ero una pazza a non fare laborto, perch avrei avuto per tutta la vita un figlio handicappato.      Cos il giorno dellintervento, con la morte nel cuore, mi presentai allospedale. Arrivai che stavano facendo laborto e vidi uscire da una stessa porta i bambini appena nati e le donne che avevano gi abortito. Vidi anche quella specie di aspirapolvere che faceva un rumore infernale con il tubo trasparente da dove passavano i residui dei bambini abortiti e gli stivali dei medici schizzati di sangue.      Pensai allora dentro di me (e che ammazzano un animale!) e quando linfermiera mi disse: Preparati, io senza dire niente me ne andai. A casa non dissi che me ne ero andata di mia spontanea volont, ma che cerano molte donne, sperando che mio marito, i miei parenti e le mie amiche fossero stati comprensivi e mi avessero fatto portare avanti la gravidanza tranquillamente senza torturarmi e colpevolizzarmi, perch volevo far nascere un bambino handicappato.      Invece non fu cos! Anche il medico mi diede della pazza, perch gli dissi che avevo preso pure cinque pillole anticoncezionali tutte una volta, per farmi venire le mestruazioni che non arrivavano! Allora mi presentai di nuovo allo stesso ospedale per prenotarmi di nuovo per laborto.      Proprio in quei giorni, per, venni a conoscenza del Telefono Rosso. Me ne parl una sera una persona che occasionalmente era venuta a conoscenza del mio dramma e mi invit a chiamare, perch avrei avuto chiarito i miei dubbi e le mie paure. Una mia amica presente allincontro invece continuava a dire che era inutile, che era meglio per me fare laborto subito invece che a quattro mesi, perch allora s che era omicidio. Io ero molto incerta, non credevo di poter risolvere i miei problemi, alla fine per acconsentii a chiamare una dottoressa di Roma, che aveva lavorato al Telefono Rosso, la quale mi disse che il bambino non correva particolari rischi. Ma io non ero convinta ed il giorno dopo sono andata dal mio ginecologo per riferirgli quello che mi aveva detto quella dottoressa, allora lui chiam davanti a me il Telefono Rosso, ma era sempre occupato. Molto frustata ed indispettita, perch il dottore non aveva parlato con il Telefono Rosso me ne andai, decisa definitivamente a fare laborto. Mi ero stancata di soffrire e di lottare con i miei dubbi atroci. Ma la persona che me ne aveva parlato fece in modo di farmi chiamare dal Telefono Rosso e la dottoressa con cui parlai mi conferm che non cerano rischi particolari.      Rilascio questa testimonianza sia per far capire quanto soffre una donna al pensiero che il suo bambino pu nascere malformato e sia perch sia finanziato e fatto conoscere il Telefono Rosso, perch tante altre donne non abbiano a soffrire come me e nascano tanti bambini sani e belli come il mio Francesco.

NI1YSh23aa	Au backe...Sex haben aber keine Ahnung vom eigenen K?rper!    Du bist NICHT schwanger.    Der erste Tag des Zyklus wird mit dem 1. Tag der Regelblutung gleichgesetzt. Die Blutung dauert normalerweise 4 bis 5 Tage. Danach beginnt ein neuer Aufbauprozess, eine Eizelle wird von einem der beiden Eierst?cke ausgesto?en und wandert langsam Richtung "Ausgang". In der Phase des Eisprungs ist die Eizelle befruchtungsf?hig und zwar fr etwa 1 Tag. Wird die Eizelle nicht befruchtet, beginnt der Abbauprozess, der auch Sekretionsphase genannt wird.|`|b1fd4f813979f2f418f9acc06e2cd285aa	ja, du bist schwanger.  das kann ich von meinem monitor aus vollkommen klar online erkennen, ohne jeden test.|`|48c5c7666a9cbf15b4f54d9a7307719faa	Wenn es die vorgeschriebene Pause war, dann wirkt die Pille auch in der Zeit, in der sie nicht eingenommen wird. Zu 100% sicher ist sie allerdings nie. Hast du aus anderen Grnden eine Pause gemacht, oder es handelt sich um eine Pille, die kontinuirlich eingenommen werden muss, dann besteht die Chance einer Schwangerschaft. Dein Frauenarzt wird dir im Zweifelfall weiterhelfen k?nnen. Aber bitte wieso wei?t du nicht, welche Medikamente du da einnimmst? Dein Frauenarzt sollte dich davor informiert haben.

Wenn du im Monat vor der Pause keinen Fehler gemacht hast, oder wenigstens die letzten 7 Tage vor der Pause, bist du w?hrend der Pause ebenso sicher vor einer Schwangerschaft geschtzt, wie in der Zeit in der du die Pille nimmst!

AA10092898	I delivered in a hospital that had a sleeper sofa in the room, and my son slept through the whole thing.  He woke up a big brother. |`|t1mSmBbtaa	This is my first so I can't comment about my own experience.    When my sister had her 2nd child I looked after her 1st son.  Mum and I decided to take him in with us but before we could get to the hospital my sister had delivered her 2nd bub... in the carpark!    If you have time I would suggest letting your 1st child spend some time with either a grandparent or one of your siblings.  Someone he knows already.  Most likely you'll go into labour at night so he will be fast asleep in bed so you can just have someone come over and stay at your place when he's sleeping.  I'd suggest letting that person get him up out of bed a few times first though cos that can be kinda weird for the child.|`|Kh0utbR0aa	Well i had no choice but to have her with us! We were living in the country, no family around, hubby dropped me off early in labour, went home with daughter and had a nap, i called him about 45 mins before i knew i was going to pop bubz no2 out and he brought daughter into the room with us when my son was born.|`|b3brAlP3aa	when my sister and my bro were born i was at my grandparents (mothers side)  i beleive i was home with my grandfather, and my grandmother was at the hospital.|`|X8wlxT75aa	As a mother of 3, my older ones always stayed with grandparents during delivery.  Depending on the age, they may get a little freaked/upset seeing you "not as your usual self." Be Blessed!|`|Tm1Rpfq4aa	I hope a mom of 5 is okay:)  I was soooo worried about this too when I transitioned form 1 to 2 kids.  None of my kids stay anywhere but with us 95% of the time and only with my husbands parents when their not with us.  My MIL keeps my kids when I have been in labor and the hospital a day or 2 after wards.  Honestly, she has been sad she hasn't been able to be there for some of the births but I have told her, to me, she has the most important job because this way I don't have to worry about my other babies as I am bringing another one into the world.  I would suggest a grandparent.  If you have time before your baby comes, choose someone you feel the most comfortable with and start letting your kiddo stay there now.  Maybe start with an afternoon here and there, maybe once or twice a week if possible.  Then aim for a night and see how it goes.  Don't be discouraged if the 1st night away doesn't go that great and try again.  Good luck.|`|cX3VJNaPaa	At Grandma's house.  I didn't want anyone at the hospital, even though I had a planned c-section.  They came the next day to visit us.|`|OxFV92hJaa	We had my husbands aunt fly cross country the day before. So our daughter was at home with her asleep. She woke up, my husband picked them up and then she stayed at the hospital with me (hubby too).    We're doing the same thing this time. His aunt will fly in a day or two before, and be home with the kids while they sleep. Then they will be at the hospital come morning!    I was induced both times @ midnight....and delivered quick. So we're opting for the same this time too. We don't have any family other than his aunt...so that is our only option or they will be in the delivery room, which my doc doesn't allow. lol |`|TcR4EJjHaa	Well, since I had my second son at home, I cannot really give you an answer you want lol.    My sister on the other hand, has four kids...the first one stayed with her mother in law while she had the second, the first and second stayed with her sister in law, and the first, second and third stayed with his mom while she had the fourth.|`|5t4PCSNuaa	My mum - but he was in the corridor of the hospital and I spent most of my time out there with him!|`|ae4ecca9b319e1194dce1771566de4b5aa	Her grandma....

3meIiIsmaa	An 8-month old should be sleeping through the night pretty much --I'm thinking that you have gotten her on this routine - and she's stuck -- You need to make some changes -Is she really hungry 3-6 times a night? or just needs to be cuddled? Does she sleep in her own bed? If she is with you- it is a convenience/habit thing. 3-6 feedings per night is even too much for most little babies-- So let's try changing the behavior. In the morning - nurse her and then after you get the other one to school- you need to feed her breakfast -cereal and fruit. And have play time and errands or whatever. And then lunch -veggies  and nurse her, then naptime. (I'm going to assume you pick your son up from school) -so get her up from nap and have playtime when your son gets home-nurse her and fix supper(dinner).  The feed her dinner -cereal and veggies and/or fruit. (about 1 to 2 hours before her bed time.) Nurse her well before putting her down for the night-in her own bed. She needs a "lovey" -a blanket, stuffed animal, whatever (my grandson has a pillow case-don't ask, it's easy!) When she wakes up during the night- just pat her behind and "Shush" her-don't talk to her and get her awake. If she cries, offer her water in a bottle- If she is thristy, she will take it. Since she has had solid food at dinner, she should not really be hungry.  And give her her "lovey" for comfort. You will have to do this several times, until she adjusts to a different schedule. If she becomes really upset, nurse her, don't talk or play with her - and put her back in her bed. The idea is to make night feedings "not fun".Don't let her take long naps during the day -because then she's not tired at night. Get her up even if she's fussy. Then she'll be ready to go down at night. I'm not gonna tell you that this will be a quick and easy thing-but within a week you should see results- and then, just think of the nice long sleep you can have. One reason you are not sleeping well now-is that you are anticipating her waking up-and hate to go to sleep just to be woken up in a few minutes. And don't jump up and go to her at the first whimper- she needs to learn to "self-comfort" and drift back to sleep.  Good luck --|`|NZNWaC1Faa	Hello, Breastfeed Babies are the healthiest children in the world.  If she's waking up all the time just maybe she's not getting enough .

It is frustrating, but it makes you appreciate a full night's sleep. Good luck. Here are some things you might try:     (1) Pump some extra for a day, and plan a night off. Convince someone you trust to watch your children, and get a full night of sleep. That will put things in perspective, and make it easier for you to see the big picture and come up with solutions that work for your family.     (2) See if she will take a pacifier some of the times she wakes up. If there is another adult in the house, have him/her offer the binky instead of you. (With my husband, I wake him up, and tell him to plug the baby in because if she sees me, she wants food, but with him, she doesn't think about it so much!)     (3) At the next appointment, ask the pediatrician. Your daughter could just have gas pains or something that wake them up. My daughter will eat more when her tummy hurts for some reason. If this is the case, your daughter is not hungry but wants to suck for comfort. You could try burping her more thoroughly, or other methods to keep her tummy happy.     (4) Just keep plugging away. In a few months, you will be done nursing, and you will miss that time with your daughter. (Sometimes). Good luck. You can do this. |`|AA11587065	I am so sorry!  I feel really luck, because my son slept through the night at 6 weeks.  Try feeding/offering more throughout the day, and get a good bedtime routine going. |`|zs7FRJHNaa	Do you dream feed her? Dream feed is just before you go to sleep latch your baby on, and let her feed while she is sleeping. This should help tap her tank a little bit longer for you at night. If she is gaining weight and is healthy the next time she wakes up if its only been a couple of hrs I would give her a paci, and see if she can soothe herself to sleep. She might be waking up so often at night to comfort nurse. The paci just might help her skip that middle feeding, and make it tell 6 or so.

If she chooses to breast feed until they are 30 then so be it.  It is her body and her children.  I think its rather disgusting myself, especially since she decides the front porch is the best place!      I am all about breast feeding, even up to 24 months, but when you begin tacking on years and years... not so good...|`|NZNWaC1Faa	Sounds like you have personal issues
lLOVMxFFaa	If you were 5 months along you would probably know by now.

If you are five months pregnant you have a lot of catching up to do...|`|6mwtZ20Kaa	you should definately take a pregnancy test!|`|64R0q42faa	The only way to know for sure is to take a pregnancy test.  |`|zD27vFE2aa	Some people dont even know they are pregnant till they are 5 or 6 months preggo. I dont know how but it does happen. Take a test asap.

Maris Dior is horrible. Naming your children after high-end designers is tacky and ghetto sounding, even if you're a millionaire. Maris doesn't sound like a real name. Marley is a fat girl name, Rae is my dogs name. Delaney Grace. Can you say cowgirl? Michelle is normal, but paired with Ryley, there you go again, going South on us.      These are just my impressions of the names. I don't like you're choices, but your choices are better than some. At least your child won't hate you. I mean, you're names aren't horrible in a way that I feel sorry for your child. |`|uvOYNogpaa	Marley is a pretty cute name...theyre not really my style but it is going to be your kid lol!

dc2a4d97feeb4ccf03ea5438ec4df481aa	Well if you're going to sneak in, then buy a ticket to another movie so that even if you get caught at least  you paid to some movie and the worst they can do is kick you out. But if they sell you the ticket then you can't get in trouble. When I was 14 I went to the theater to see Superbad I think and the guy was all "are you 17" and I like "sure" and he gave me the ticket I was like alright. |`|tJB0kb5Kaa	well that happened to me and my friends and they do ask for your age and they caught us because my idiot friend screamed out "i cant belive we snuck in an R rated movie" and they gave us our refund they didnt kick us out or anything|`|jY31JaCeaa	nothing happens but if you get caught they will kick you out|`|TA7BoWNLaa	just buy tickets for a lesser rated movie and walk in to the r rated movie...at all the theaters here, there arent guards standing by every show room, so u wont get caught...people do it all the time|`|AA11348344	yes they ask your age  if they catch you then the take you out then call parents then they fine you like 200$|`|6L9jJnchaa	Yeah, they'll arrest you.  It's illegal.|`|e1cf5a783f548627eba8be4d2c8409caaa	Eh.....    Don't get caught?  Lol.  Most likely you'd  just get told to leave.     Chances are the kids working at the theatre won't care.  A girl sold me a child's ticket once because she said I could get away with it and I know people who sneak into movies all the time.  I have friends who work in theatres and they're all like "Whatever".      Obviously it's against the law - you're breaking a rule - but the penalties aren't as harsh as the ones for taking a camera and filming the movie would be.    Nah, never tried.  I like my clean conscience.|`|r9vT2RYXaa	I bought movie tickets for another movie  then snuck into an R.  if it's really busy then they won't notice really.  If it's not busy they'll count all the people in the theater and count the tickets and you can get kicked out.|`|lEjoxYTKaa	My little sister got deported, she lives somewhere south of France now because she snuck into Blair Witch Project...    I am lying about that.    Of Course Its not against the Law, the worst they can do is kick you out with out a refund.

be5076c0b98b495ffe00aade08f96b65aa	That was how my "period" was right before I got pregnant. I didn't even have to use pads/tampons, because I only bled when I wiped.    BABY DUST TO YOU!|`|bAKbAKdzaa	the exact same thing happened to me. there's a good chance that you are pregnant. i was. pay close attention to what's going on. good luck conceiving!!    [xoxo]    jessica mae|`|r5oL56xCaa	could be, go visit your doctor though, just to make sure everything is going normally
AA10196172	I don't think there's much correlation between your pregnancy experience and how healthy your baby will be.  What I do see is that if you are as healthy as a horse (and the father also doesn't have a lot of health problems)  then it's a good bet the child will inherit the same genes for good health. The people who have health problems - bad liver, bad digestive system, skin problems, hormone problems - a lot of these are hereditary to some extent -but you never know! Every baby is a  gamble!    As for the drinks and such... If weed were really that bad for you, there would be an epidemic of problem children since the 60's. There is no real link between minor drug use and birth deformities. SO it's probably something like your odds go from 1 in 10 million to 1.1 in1 0 million.    Similarly, until 20 years ago everyone smoked or had alcohol during pregnancy. What was frowned upon was getting drunk. Problems like FAS happen to  children whose mother would get falling-down drunk more than weekly during the pregnancy - alcoholics. A drink or two won't have much effect. In fact, some thinking is that is the evolutionary purpose of morning sickness. If you body has the least bit of doubt about what you ate, better to upchuck than risk hurting the child.    Also, years ago half the population smoked. I bet if you lined up an office full of people, you couldn't tell whose mothers were the smokers...    So the risks to the baby are overblown. This doesn't mean go out and live it up now, it just means don't stress too much if you were just being pretty normal before you found out.     What you should do is make sure you take the tests available. For example, the risk of Downs syndrome is extremely low for under-30 mothers (what, 1 in 10,000?), but they account for 80% of such babies. Why? Because over-35's (a) have a lot fewer babies, even if the risk is higher and (b) most over-35's have the tests and can decide if they want a Downs baby. Often under-30's skip that test.     Congrats, good luck, and everything will be fine!|`|ZNhP3mpUaa	No difference, Some are just lucky when it comes to symptoms... (pregnancy related problems are a different story) but just because you haven't had morning sickness ro things like that, doesn't mean your child would be any healthier than a mother that experienced morning sickness. It's just all about how well you take care of yourself! good luck!|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	STOP! I'm jealous! I have heartburn that can burn houses!!! Sounds like you and the baby are very healthy. Congrats!|`|8854875af3db879d59f88f4cc5d1d682aa	It only means you've had a good pregnancy.  Regardless of the modern technologies and advances in prenatal care, there is no way to tell how healthy a child is until it has been delivered.  Of course, maintaining a healthy diet and routine during pregnancy increases the chances of the child being healthy, but there are no guarantees either way.|`|Qt4UIC8iaa	I really dont think it matters. Every woman has different things happen during each pregnancy then the next|`|9P26sacKaa	Actually, having morning sickness is a sign of your baby being healthy.  Not having any symptoms, however, doesn't mean anything about your baby's health.    If anything, your drinking, smoking, drugs, and not eating optimally could result in a baby that is less healthy, but that doesn't mean your baby is guaranteed to be less healthy than average or even less healthy than he/she would have been if you had done everything as currently recommended.  Doing those things makes your baby more likely to be unhealthy, but it's not a guarantee.  Just like doing everything you're "supposed to do" during pregnancy is no guarantee that your baby will be healthy and have less illness than average.      Some of it is just genetic.  There have been connection drawn between unhealthy behavior and unhealthy babies, but it's not a 100% guarantee that if you do these "bad" things that you will have these specific problems.      You could have a really healthy baby just like anyone else.  Good luck!
OM1zJPFtaa	I don't know anything about the charts or how to read them, because I've never had to use them, but i can tell you that I did experience the light spotting when I first found out I was pregnant with my daughter. It was sort of a brown color, and I had a little bit of cramping when I first had the spotting. It was a very light spotting, and I wore a pad for two days thinking my period would come on, but it didn't. I later found out that the spotting was implantation bleeding, and that was a sign of pregnancy. I was actually able to calculate my due date accurately, based on the day the sex had occured and also the day the spotting occurred.  I hope this helps. Good Luck!!!
467be00aa9eff8cd86b019690cc79aa4aa	I am so sorry! I understand that you are in a lot of pain right now. Don't be scared everything works out for the best.|`|lnUrm4sGaa	im sorry sweet for your loss i really am|`|eG5W05Pbaa	im so sorry, i hope your ok.. you have to be strong headed..its guna be hard but u must havr sum1 to stand by u...i hope it works out 4 ya. good luck|`|AA10390690	i'm sorry for your loss but just know every thing happens for a reason. once you heal up && are ready emotionally && physically maybe you can try again.|`|TljXiSNnaa	i am really sorry hun i will have you in my prayers|`|UAunAKdtaa	its a sad thing that happens to many women. you are not alone and most important of all, its NOT your fault. for some reason, this pregnancy wasnt meant to be. its ok to grieve. its alright to be upset. dont blame yourself for anything. maybe there was something very wrong with your pregnancy, and its the nature's way of telling you that you should try again later...after you have miscarried, if you want to try again some time later, try first eating healthy, doing a bit of exercise and taking folic acid. maybe this time you just werent ready for a baby.  take it easy and welcome the support of those around you  we wish you the best.|`|XHweMNNkaa	There's really nothing that can help you feel better. My best friend was raped when she was 14, and had a miscarriage. The worse part was that she hid the whole thing, and had the miscarriage in the bedroom, and had a funeral for the fetus in the rose garden.   I can tell you that You're going to be ohkay, you're not going to get hurt, you won't be physically harmed from any of this. You probably feel bad the most because it mean the fetus isn't going to live. You need to look at that literally- the fetus isn't going to live. It's not that it's going to die. You are not killing it. More than likely it hasn't even developed enough for it to feel anything. Or it could already be stillborn, which means it's there, but its not actually alive. You just need to remember that you are not killing the fetus, you have done nothing wrong.|`|6nW0eSQ7aa	Everything will be okay.|`|fd1ca97678efbda5438c859bb7cfdfccaa	if you were not scared and upset there would be something wrong with you.  your reality at this time seems very difficult indeed, and I just hope that you are going to be well.|`|C4ibOR7Laa	havent they done a blood test to check your HCG levels? then checked them again 48 hours later to see if they doubled?|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	Those feelings are completely natural. There is a 1 in 4 chance you would have had a miscarriage. I had 2 miscarriages before this healthy pregnancy. It's not your fault and you are going to continue to be very upset. Talk about it with your boyfriend if that jelps you. Sometimes men just don't talk about things that bother them. It doesn't mean that it doesn't upset him, he just has a different dealing tactic.|`|wMrR4gqYaa	I am so sorry to hear about your situation, no one can fully understand how you feel unless they have been thru it. I had the same thing happen to me I found out I was pregnant in march of last year, went to the doctors like normal, had a couple of ultrasounds done because the tech thought I was earlier than I thought cause she couldnt locate a heartbeat, about 2 more ultrasounds later the ob told me that the babies(yes twins, they werent even going to tell me, which made it worse) werent where they should have been by whatever week I was at apparently. I was crushed, staring into oblivion and there was my smug ob telling me she was going to schedule me for a d&c and that she would have the surgeon come talk to me. I freaked out on this woman who just pretty much seen me as a 1 in 4 statistic, I had just found out I was expecting twins and that I was suppose to miscarry in a week and just wanted to let everything sink in and she wanted me to decide the rest of my life right then. They wanted to give me the medicine to make you miscarry but I thought what if they were wrong, well not wrong but miracles happen ya know so I told them no I would go home and if it happened it happened, I sat there day by day until right past the next week I started having really bad cramps and started to bleed. It was horrific, I was so upset. I would just tell you that they cant tell you to take the medicine or get a d&c I just told them if it happened I wanted it to happen naturally and was told if I didnt think I expelled everything to call them to get checked out. I ended up doing everything naturally and felt alot better than I think I would have had I ended up aborting(which in essence is exactly what they ask you to do) It was the worst experience of my life and I needed alot of time to recover, the day I released myself from the hospital to do this in the privacy of my own home I just sat on my couch and me and my boyfriend bawled, I probaby cried everyday for awhile. The only advice I can give you is do what you think is right for you and if you do go the natural route and want to do it at home I just suggest maybe stopping in at the hospital(they will do a scan and see if you have expelled nething) and ask for pain  meds, I litterally felt like I was going to die phsyically--it could be totally different for you I am just saying. If you need to talk anymore please dont hesitate to email or ask any questions. You are in my prayers, good luck hun.
AQkfW704aa	It depends on which pill number you have missed. Usually the last pills are ok if missed but the middle bits are at the time of ovulation so the chances of you getting pregnant are quite high. you might need to consider using another method of protection when you miss a pill, like condom's or the morning after pill. A pregnancy test is a sure way of finding out if you really are or not. Good luck.|`|AA10390690	i'd say a 50/50. it depends i guess. wait && find out. every ladies body is different. some ladies are more fertile than others. etc.|`|CgGIbExVaa	i missed one pill and got pg on bc my son is now 5 years old so yes there is a chance .
dgRTkccBaa	I made it to 38 weeks with my twins, they were 6 and 7 lbs when they were born and had no problems, both came home with me.  I know how difficult it is, but I urge you to do your best to hold out as long as possible.  The longer you keep those babies in the better off they will be.  I know how uncomfortable you are, I was there too (I was carrying 13 lbs of baby around and I'm 5'2" so I'm pretty small).  37 weeks is considered full term for twins, you'll want to try your hardest to make it another 2 weeks.  Good luck!!  You're almost there!|`|Xt1LxiWAaa	im 32 1/2 weeks with fraternal twins. i'm so ready for this to be over. i can relate with you! i can't breathe, i'm not sleeping, i'm on bed rest, im in so much pain and im so uncomfortable. don't you just love those contractions??  hang in there....we're almost there!!! :o)|`|G5g6PSXTaa	My sis are preggo with triplets and is the same eway|`|vlMd2vHxaa	First congrats on your twins! I'm a mommy to 4-month-old twin girls. They were born at 39 weeks 5 days. They were 5 lb 14 oz and 6 lb 8 oz, spent no time in the NICU and came home with me 2 days later on my original due date. I have no idea how I survived that long!     I felt the same things you are feeling when I was pregnant, I was ready to rip them out myself it was so terrible. I had contractions for weeks and never went into labor, I had to be induced. Try to stick it out for as long as you can. The longer you can keep them cooking the better off they will be! Best of luck to you!
fvNVtRDNaa	may be you are just late!! are you taking any multivitamines, sometimes, esp folic acid, delays your period by few days. since you have cramps and no pregnancy symptoms, you shouldn't worry too much.. it's just dragging!|`|wV1xDq1yaa	congratulation you are pregnant with an alien|`|oeCIzoF9aa	Well... I am mean so...    If ur slim:  1.)  Learn to keep ur legs closed  2.)  Stay off ur back  3.)  What's ur  ?  4.)  Do it in a pool, you can't get pregnant in a pool (somebody told me to say that)  5.)  Suck it more  6.)  Take it more in the @$$  7.)  Fly solo from now on    If ur fat:   1.)  GO DIE!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|b1a7294223f3b0fc270be52d3ed1fbc5aa	I would definetely take another test.  IMHO, you had sex when you were the most fertile.  Take a test in a few days. If you are preggo, it should most defintely be detected by then|`|wfbr4b5baa	the stress could be it. if you also do sports or run everyday things like that periods could get off track. u have nothing to worry about.|`|FaUNLyUraa	okay. so you might have a problem with your system(period).. and that can make some big problems, so if it doesnt come soon, u should go to the doctor.. if you rather not see the doctor(which you should if it still doesnt come) then you should drink a lot of liquid and then take the pregnacy test.. it may change some things  hope this helped and good luck (:|`|I5x1Tupfaa	Stress could definitely delay a period or make you skip one. I think to be sure, you should go to the doctor on campus and ask for a blood test to see if you're pregnant. Blood tests are more accurate. Good luck!|`|lhMpqDS3aa	Yes.
PA5iBQZAaa	honestly i would just act as if it was a period because if you do all that finding out  will make you feel so depressed and why beat yourself up if there is nothing you can do :) sometimes its best to just start over and if it was you are more fertile after a misscarrige then before good luck and God bless      p.s i have 2 beautiful blessings 12,5 and have had 4 misscarriges God has seen me through it all:)|`|eS68lGulaa	did it hurt alot??? doesnt make a diffrence now anyway|`|oMna3EOnaa	definately go to the doctor it could be a miscarriage.|`|e3fa2fb97cbca43e2c3086607351d4caaa	if it had clots in it it probably was a miscarriage i would go to the doctor and make sure everything is ok if i was you|`|MPcnocYJaa	the exact same thing happened to me.... i really hope that is not what it is... but, FOR ME anyways, i'm pretty positive it was. i am going to check it out today.
467be00aa9eff8cd86b019690cc79aa4aa	You could be pregnant. I would retest in about a week. Your body may have not been creating enough HCG hormone for the test to pick up. Try not to stress over it because stress can delay your menstrual cycle as well.
claUGpVRaa	I am almost 37 weeks and have had protein in my urine sample twice now but it's nothing to worry about I was told by my midwifes. Just think - one more week and you will have your baby xx|`|4uqj8Nf1aa	dont worry!!!  in one week time u will have a baby!!! yes a real live baby and no bump!  seriously chill enjoy to time left xx|`|AA10780655	Im 36 weeks and about a month ago I had protein in my urine(did a 24 hour urine collection). I got sent to Labor and Delivery to be monitored and have my blood pressure checked every 15 minutes. But everything was fine. They never really told me why there was protein in my urine either, but things must be going good.|`|M5fRd5v5aa	Seriously its only a little bit of protein, if it was anything serious then you'd have had an emergency c-section, good luck for the next week and soon you'll have your little one, good luck =Dx x|`|BWLIaOBEaa	If your midwife said that you were fine, you should believe her. A little protein can be ok. If you had a lot of protein they would be checking your blood pressure. High blood pressure in pregnancy, usually higher than 140/90 with protein in the urine can be a condition called Preeclampsia. This is very common but very serious if not caught and treated. If you develop a headache that will not go away with Tylenol, blurry vision, or pain under your right breast, these could be signs of preclampsia and you should call your health care provider. They might draw some blood to check your platelets and liver function tests. Try not to worry, you are almost there, but if you develop any of those symptoms, call your midwife..
be5076c0b98b495ffe00aade08f96b65aa	I would say you most definitely did NOT have a miscarriage. First of all, your period was just probably delayed. Also a "gentle" fall would not harm an implanted egg. Second, I had a miscarriage, and typically blood associated with a miscarriage isn't brown, it's bright red. Brown blood is usually a sign of "old" blood that maybe wasn't discarded with your last period. That happened to me too. Also with a miscarriage, I anyways, cramped the whole time I bled, and it came out of the vagina like a period, and not just upon wiping. Third, if you were pregnant, the pregnancy test would've come up positive even if you miscarried. Your body can continue to release the HCG hormone for up to a month after a miscarriage. And in order for you to skip a period, the egg obviously would've implanted and began to release HCG, so again, it would've came up positive. Finally, with my miscarriage I was in terrible pain. I had contractions for about 2 hours, and then I had a huge gush of water, and then clumps of gray-which is fetal tissue. Don't worry. I would be willing to bet money you didn't have a miscarriage.|`|rHAiO9Ghaa	If you miscarried, it usually comes out in clumps and is visable. You would also have been in a remarkable about of pain if you had suffered a miscarrage. You said you took a HPT it would have shown as positive if you had a miscarrage, because the hormone would still have been in your body. When you go to the doctors he will explain it to you in more deatail.|`|tu7aqUoxaa	YOU SHOULD HAVE BLOOD CLOTS|`|f9d25be9a86bcb470e6b157992207144aa	It sounds to me as if your period was just late this month. The baby is well protected in there and it you did fall, you should have been ok. Sometimes when you think about it too hard, your body can play tricks on you. Good luck w/ everything. Are you and hubby trying?? If so, lots of baby dust!|`|OM1zJPFtaa	I had a miscarriage once, and I can tell you that from my personal experience, you will know if it is a miscarriage because it will look like clots during your period. They are larger than what I normally have during a regular period. Also, if your doctor does a blood test and you have miscarried it could show up as a positive for pregnancy on a regular blood test, but if they do a quantitative blood test, they can determine if you truly were pregnant.
T48smu01aa	I asked my midwife if this is true and can it be done...and no it isn't because no matter what your cervix will change high and closed to low and open throughout your cycles...it not accurate at all and all you can do is wait and test good luck sweeteie and tons of baby dust!!!|`|467be00aa9eff8cd86b019690cc79aa4aa	The only way to tell if you are actually pregnant is by taking a HPT or going to the doctor.|`|ZfWdmAZXaa	cervical position is not a accurate way of telling whether or not your pregnant.|`|Ze7oFNHBaa	You should probably use a pregnancy test.

154146d98d9dbb211223b05af3f8c0d5aa	Talk your case worker at SRS about a "spend down". This is where the cost attributed to your illness (or pregnancy) will be deducted from your income and you will qualify for Medicaid.  http://www.dhs.dc.gov/dhs/cwp/view,a,3,Q...|`|yB5go5wbaa	Here's info on maternity insurance; you definitely will qualify for something through this page.  Try calling your state's Department of Social Services, too.  They're helpful - even if they can't help you they'll give you other numbers to call.  Good luck.    http://www.pregnancyinsurance.org/matern...    Also, look up info on your state's Family Health Plus program.  It works on a sliding scale based on income.|`|28fNd725aa	this is  a sad sitution and one I to find my self in although Im not preggers.... my hubby was laid off and we lost our insurance and even with the kids make to much $$.  Anyways... I would contact the hospital and see what your options are... but don't freet they can not turn you away when you go into labor!!      Good luck!|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	Hospitols are willing to work with people that have no health insurance. But I think you can still qualify for Medicaid, but you will have to pay a small amount instead of having everything free. They have a sliding scale. You can also check out planned parenthood and see if they have anything to offer.|`|3iXBQaRHaa	I have met this sort of situation before,here http://www.HealthInsuranceIdeas.info/fre...  is the resource I found helpful.|`|SYAakSe1aa	healthplans.bebto.com - try this one. My wife had no problem with her insurance coverage while being pregnant.
TdF6QLawaa	You took a test 5 days after which means that you are on day 19 now.  Generally speaking, you are probably most fertile during the days you had intercourse. This is only a guide though and every woman ovulates at different times. This is not to say that you are pregnant but you didn't choose the best time to get amorous if you want to avoid pregnancy.    The test you took was probably too early. It is best to wait out a missed period first. However you sound quite frantic and time goes so slow when you worry.    It's not easy to relax when you have such a great weight on your mind but you only have a few days until you will find out so hang in there, you are in Gods hands!    Good luck.x|`|bxlYleZkaa	YES! You can get pregnant at any time.|`|1TuIuuXdaa	In short, yes. Five days after isn't enough time for a pregnancy test to come back positive, really, and I think there's a very real chance that you are pregnant.
Xi5Jno6haa	I had the triple screen done while I was pregnant with my 8yr old. It came back positive for Down's, the dr offered to do the amnio. I too had concerns about getting that done and opted not to do it because even if he had Down's I would still love him no matter what. He was born with Down Syndrome and I'm glad that I did not get that done and put him at risk.|`|TN3Sthbwaa	Honestly, if you are planning to have the baby no matter what the test shows then there is no reason to have it done.  It is your decision no matter what the doctor recommends.|`|8iYVHA1raa	I had one when I was pregnant with my daughter - It was a bit uncomfortable, but everything went fine.    High risk doesn't mean your baby will definitely have Downs - Just that there is a higher than normal chance of it.    Good Luck!|`|tu7aqUoxaa	if you have it early or too late, it'll come back with high risks. They told me that about my 5 year old and she is perfectly fine
E7ViD8EWaa	Sure!    Just send a message!  =]|`|s1h5MDz0aa	sure i can understand that|`|YqLHUNrvaa	You can trust me I dont have the slightest clue who your bf is so yh you can ask me|`|E6T9DPT9aa	I'll be happy to help!    All my best (:  E-mail me if you want to know anything else (:
dbafItLvaa	Yes it is possible that you could be pregnant, but you may not get an accurate pregnancy test until you miss your period. Take another if your period doesn't come when it's supposed to.  Good luck.|`|Lz4wXr6paa	yes and  very likely|`|3X0t8JrXaa	Its possible but a lot of the symptoms you described you wouldn't have this early on.  Like the eating a lot...you usually lose your apetite and don't regain a normal apetite till after 12 weeks and the constipation is pretty early on.  Still I'd wait at least a week until after your period is missed and then test.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	If it's 11 days till your period a pregnancy test won't give you a result. You would have to had missed your period by at least a day.     I took medication for bronchitis for 3 weeks and it caused a yeast infection (my first one ever). So it could be the medicine causing it.
TN3Sthbwaa	A line is a line is a line when it comes to pregnancy tests.  False negatives are more common then false positives.    Congratulations.
LiPoEBenaa	I had one at 17wks pregnant and it was nothing to worry about. The doctor won't test the cells from inside your cervix, but will take them from the outside. Yes, the biopsy is painful, but I had no complications after. The doctor wouldn't make you do anything he/she didn't feel was in your best interest! Good luck and congrats on your pregnancy!|`|eFB2jLVbaa	i had one at 22 weeks and i wouldn't worry, they told me they weren't going to take a biopsy either but they did in the end and i didn't even feel it or bleed so honestly i wouldn't worry they wouldn't do it if they didn't feel it in your best interest or if they knew it would hurt the baby in the end|`|e3fa2fb97cbca43e2c3086607351d4caaa	i had one but i was further along...i don't think the colposcopy will do anything... My doctor told me that they don't do biopsy will pregnant cause of the bleeding. i think the baby will be ok though for the colposcopy though.|`|EUdpSXQWaa	I had a colposcopy done at 36 weeks, doctor didn't want to wait for some reason. They didn't do a biopsy or even touch my cervix, just had a look. They didn't touch anything because they didn't want to irritate anything and push me into labour. Now I'll just have to go back for a more thorough one after 6 weeks PP
DdjpQr0Gaa	I love Briah, Braelyn and Brielle.  I recently had a baby girl and I wanted to name her after her dad, Brian.  I had some of those same names in mind, but I named her Brylan Faith.  I had never heard Briah before and I like it alot.  I also loved the name Addison, but she already had a cousin named that.  Best of luck!|`|laVH1Bz3aa	i don't like any of them, to be honest. they all seem made up. i think a name starting with b goes with the last name though, so i agree with you there.    why not use some real names? instead of brielle, use Gabrielle, or Belle, Laina or Leigh? if you do some research i'm sure you can find some others that actually sound like names that you'd like.|`|AA10325228	I like Brielle Addison or Addison Brielle the best!|`|D4zZFhNJaa	Liana Rain Arnold is awesome!|`|5ZbFdcwdaa	Liana Rain Arnold is Beautiful and I LOVE it si much!  I also like Keelin but not really jade|`|3zh3AbkQaa	I like Ashleigh Nicole Arnold, I also like the name Akayla because it means beautiful in hawaiian.|`|YrHwZw6zaa	I like the name of   Keelin Jade :]|`|c3CVY87caa	Liana Rayne Arnold is beautiful! I love that name!
RPpXarDDaa	he may not be getting enough liquids. and plenty of fibrous foods like fruits and veggies. fiber absorbs water so if your not getting enough it can make it difficult and painful to use the bathroom|`|BypjotRpaa	feed him fruits.. raisins and cantalop is good to help with constipation|`|Irdj2KAFaa	Yes, your 18th month old is experiencing constipation.    I have a 3 year old who once had a difficult time with constipation around the same age as yours. It got so bad, that he was afraid to go due to his previous experiences with painful bowel movements.    We tried the fruits and veggies, but it didn't seem to solve his constipation problem, or, it seemed to work some of the times, and other times his stools were still hard. Since then, we began mixing MiraLAX into his juice or milk. http://www.miralax.com/miralax/consumer/... It works wonders for his digestive track.    We mixed MiraLAX in liquids for him until he was regular with his stools. Careful not to mix-in too much as it could be too harsh on his intestines. Check with your doctor and ask about MiraLAX. You'll be surprised at it's amazing reputation. Google MiraLAX and constipation for toddlers.    Hope this helps.|`|B4Cz1vUEaa	He probably doesn't have enough fruit in his diet.  I give my son pears, cantaloupe, or peaches and it helps.  It also helped when he went from  mostly formula to  eating more food than milk.
PLK1p8cUaa	If you had otherwise unprotected sex (no condom) then there is always a chance of getting pregnant.  Give your doctor a call and see what he/she suggests.  It could be a symptom of the endometriosis and requires further treatment.  Good luck.|`|R7vwxGMmaa	Changes in your diet, weight gain, exercising, stress can all effect your cycle. I would call a DR if you are that concerned.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	Stress, change in diet, weight gain or loss can all cause a missed period.  I don't see why you would UNLESS you haven't taken them correctly.
UZS2Phpiaa	There is no good way to tell your parent you are pregnant.  Remember, there is nothing sinful or wrong about being pregnant.  You do not need to be ashamed of the life inside of you.  You shouldn't have had sex but that is in the past.  It is over and done with.  And i promise you, you are still higher in the eyes of God than those who would judge you.     Tonight, sit down with your mother and say, "mom, do you love me?"  She will say. "yes, you are my daughter, of course i love you." and then you'll ask, "and you'll stand by me, no matter what, right?"  Your mom will answer, "Yes, i'm your mother that is what moms do."  Her positive answers will help give you courage to press forwards and she will be thinking you're on drugs or you've killed someone.  When you say, "Mom, i'm pregnant" she may even be a little relieved it isn't something worse.  There will probably be a moment of stunned silence during which you should say, "It was stupid and it was wrong and i need you."    And remember, you are by no means the first 14 year old to get pregnant.  In ages past girls would get married as young as 12, in some countries they still do.  Some scholars think that Mary the mother of Christ was only 15 or 16 when she become pregnant.    I'm almost done, but i want to encourage you in one more thing.  Don't abort.  Morally it is a far greater sin to have an abortion than it is to have sex and at 4 months it will be far safer to carry the child to term than to have an abortion.    I pray that Mary watch over you and Christ be with you.    And God Bless|`|H2IqzG12aa	Have your aunt with you for moral support (pardon the expression).  It's good that you've been to a doctor.  You also need on-going care, so the sooner mom knows, the better.|`|3oGRNQKyaa	come out with it.  before u do,say that ur NOT sorry,i love the baby and want to ______(what ur gooing to do,keep it/adoption/abortion)....  say what u need from her, i.e support,love,care and most of all understanding.  say it was a mistake,(if it was) but listen to her afterwards.  she might scream and shout,probably will but its mistake and she needs to take it in.  i am 15 now with a baby boy whom is a month and a week old(Elliot Lukas was born on the 24th December 08)..  i know what its like,  school,a baby,ur work after school and activities for you and the baby...  i understand all of it..  email me about anything u'd like to know|`|dkTAZmKSaa	telll herr tonight.  make her a nice dinnerrr, sit down with her and just explain to her how much you need her and that you couldnt be anywhere without her.|`|AA11173475	It's hard but tell her as soon as possible.    If you think your responsible enough to have sex then you are also responsible to deal with all the consequences that comes with sex, and pregnancy is one of them. You're not even considered an adult. You still need your parents approval for many things. How sad.   When you have sex even with protection or birth control pills there is always a possibility that you could get pregnant. And if you can't take care of yourself you definitely shouldn't be having sex period.|`|QSodlfMraa	wow that would me you are 5 months honey, well make sure you aunt is there when you tell her for support.|`|k9VvIG3gaa	Just come out any say it.   She will be VERY disappointed.. And mad..   Why did you wait so long to tell her??    Just tell her ASAP!!|`|pJeFpC7qaa	Um....I really hope you're just bored and made this story up.    I guess write it down, explaining who's the dad, and when it happened. Leave it for her to read.|`|AA10390690	you go straight to her and tell her the friggin' truth! if your "old" enough to have sex and do it UNPROTECTED your old enough to be an adult and tell your mom. i highly suggest you look into adoption. you are soooooo young.|`|xyrSl2nSaa	Just say it really fast. You need to tell her soon. You need prenatal care and the doctors need to check you. She will probably be mad but you messed up and you will have to deal with consequences. It's time for you to be an adult, you need to tell her right away|`|G9sd4Nlkaa	One piece of advice. Do not write her a letter, note or any alternatives of the sort. She will read it and only be more shocked and when she wants to talk about it face to face, it will simply be very awkward for you. What you need to do is confront her and be direct and straight-forward. Sit her down and tell her that you need her support and love. Tell her who the father is and how far along you are and most likely she will be there for you, seeing as you're her daughter.|`|nwe4mWBaaa	Woah you got a problem there.  Say Mom I pregnant Im sorry and I hope you understand.|`|bfP8tjPKaa	You are soooooo young! A child yourself! Well EVERYTHING happens for a REASON... You really do need to tell your mom. I lost my mom when I was just six, and I won't ever be able to tell her she will be having grandkids, Your mom might be REAL upset at first, hell she might even yell,but you cannot change what has been done, and abortion is out of the picture because you are to far a long I really wish you all the best, I see your username is somethin with "happily taken" I hope this means the father is involved? Good Luck girl, and just tell her, thats all you can do!    Good Luck =)|`|hstwNjNaaa	"Mum, I need to tell you something. I'm pregnant, I've know for (however many months) and I didn't know how to tell you."    You just have to tell her directly, she needs to know so she can help you out.|`|8cLLhDrfaa	tell her straight up.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	Tell her today. Just be direct. There's no way to sugar coat it.|`|E6T9DPT9aa	Write her a letter. Emphasise on the fact that you NEED her love and support. And that it was a mistake.    All my best (:  E-mail me if you want to know anything else (:|`|YmLIirIqaa	well because you are so young you need to tell your mom ASAP. How do you know your almost 4 months pregnant? have you been to a doctor? all these things are really important. if you dont see a doctor soon and get on vitamins and check everything out to make sure the babys ok you could be harming yourself and the baby. I am sure your mom might be disappointed at first but shes your mother, she will stand by you more than likely. Hope everything turns out okay.|`|gu3GAFC9aa	That's tough but you have to just do it. In a few months she will know anyway and you need her support.|`|0dbwA1dVaa	Yeah, everyone else is right. You just need to be straightforward with her and tell her. There's no way to make it a good thing, not now at least. She'll probably get mad or yell, or be utterly dissapointed...and if she does, make sure you give her sometime to cool down... but in the end she's your mother and she loves you. She'll support you and help you - that's what moms are for.     Good luck and God bless!|`|0Kw2yVp4aa	tell her!|`|akHYRh5Raa	bake her a cake|`|yz6G7jfXaa	aammm, if i'm not wrong, isn't pregnancy at your age kind of life threatening?  i hope 4 months isn't too late to abort!|`|IdJKXFDPaa	WHO A UH I HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM. JUST TELL HER UP FRONT AND GET IT OVER WITH|`|ZWUBlIfoaa	sit her down and tell her in a calm voice that ur pregnant. also do it while shes calm, not when shes busy and frustrated|`|bppI7Pxzaa	Congratulations, if its the news you wanted.  You will have to tell your Mom sooner or later, when its just you are her ask to to sit down and then tell her, or leave a letter explaining your pregnant but you have to tell her what you want to do when the baby has arrived.    Good luck xx|`|Q7hZGym1aa	Sit with your mom and tell her that your pregnant. Tell her that you need her love and all the support :) hope everythings well.|`|76hNV3iqaa	Well you might want to tell her, because you are now 5 months(20 weeks) and I promise you you will not be able to hide it much longer. Plus you are not past the point of being able to have an abortion (so your mom can not ask you to have one.) Plus 90% of the time your mom will end up being very excited to know that she will soon be a grandma. However I promise she WILL be very upset at first. But once your mom holds her grand baby in her arms she will melt. All you can do now is be an adult and sit her down and explain to her that you are pregnant and tell her what your plans are for your future and for your baby. Are you planning on keeping the baby? If not then tell your mom that you are wanting to look into adoption(and because you are under 18 most states require that you have your mom involved with the adoption process.) Sweetie you did an adult act ( you had sex) therefore all you can do now is be an adult and tell your mom straight up about the pregnancy.  God Bless    and   Good Luck  PS. If you need anymore advice about what to say WORD FOR WORD please e-mail me and I will help you through this.
TCqrS8Vqaa	HIYA T4T, any bleeding in pregnancy, must be seen by a doctor.it could save you from having a miscarriage.you need to see a doctor asap,leaving it for a few days can be very harm-full to the baby.

Even though it seems counter-intuitive, more naps during the day and an earlier bedtime can help some babies sleep through the night.|`|vue9NOhYaa	When my daughter was a baby, we enjoyed spending the evening as a family, so she went to bed when we did -- usually around 10-11 p.m. Then, until she was about 7 months, she woke for a feeding during the night.|`|xIF2lShpaa	I think that is a little too early. I put my daughter to bed around 9 pm, and I go to bed at 10 pm. She usually sleeps all night, until I get my other daughter off to school, which is about 7 am.

He does sleep through the night, and started when he was about 4 months old.    Sleeping through the night, though, is not solely dependent on bedtime.  Babies also need to have no physical need to wake (hunger, thirst, pain, temperature, light), and have been taught how to calm themselves to sleep.  All babies, until they are nearly 2, will wake several times a night.  That's what their sleep cycles are designed to do.  The ones that "sleep through the night" are the ones that have learned how to calm themselves to sleep and don't need mom.  They still wake a bit, but they "sleep through the night" because they don't completely wake up and can go back to sleep.|`|4YIUxSlYaa	She goes to bed around 9pm.|`|cpLW8ra0aa	Depends on the age. My guy didn't sleep through until about 8 months.  After that, we stopped giving the bottle during the night.    Another factor is naps.

AA10624857	The statistics are actually based on 100 people using a method for one year.  So, when it is said that oral contraceptives have a 92-99.7% rate of effectiveness, this means that if 100 women take birth control pills for 1 year, less than 1 - 8 women will get pregnant.  The difference in rate is based on perfect use to typical use.  Many rates of failure are due to human error, but not always.  The rate of success is not based on just one person, so this does not mean that if you take birth control pills and have sex 100 times that you will get pregnant sometime between the 92-99 time.  It's not based on times a person has sex.|`|a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	I believe you have a 99% chance of not getting pregnant each time you have sex. It isn't cumulative like you are thinking.|`|CuCrGDuRaa	I asked my doctor this question a few years ago.  She said that if 100 women use birth control throughout their lifetime, only one will become pregnant.  I was on birth control for 5 years and had sex on average once a day and never got pregnant.  I got pregnant on the first try when I quit, so I am pretty fertile too.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	That means each time you have sex you have a 99% chance that you will not get pregnant. It's not 99 of 100 people don't get pregnant using this type of birth control or 1 time out of 100 tries, it's each and every time you have sex there is a 1% chance you can get pregnant.|`|EXhVHMAlaa	1% chance of getting pregnant means that 1 out of every 100 women who use birth-control get pregnant every year.  That is including women who miss pills or don't take them regularly.  These statistics do NOT depend on how many times you have sex.  You can have as much or as little sex as you'd like and still have the same chances.  Hope this helps.

RmaU5LEjaa	Tell her she's crazy. Tell her about all the crazy and fun things you want to do with her before you bring kids into your life.  If she doesn't like that go and hang out a few days in a row at Chuck E Cheese.  She'll change her mind until she's a bit older.|`|osDQVLqNaa	Tell her to stop being stupid and have some fun before thinking about having children. Oh, and definitely handle the 'protection' issues yourself from now on, if she's serious, all it takes is a pin through a condom or 'forgetting' to take her pill -and you're a daddy!|`|8xTt4mZ2aa	Definitely go with the you are insane reply. 17 is way to young to be having a planned baby. Trust me if you're not ready for a marriage commitment, you're not ready for a baby.     Also, if she does want to get pregnant and you don't be aware that some women are crazy. If you don't use a condom b/c she is on birth control, start wearing one, because if she wants a baby that bad she might stop taking her pills and not tell you. She could be getting nervous about you two getting older and the fact that you might move on and this is a way to definitely keep you around. Just be careful, lots of women are very crazy when it comes to guys at that age.|`|bxGpzec9aa	17? You tell her hell no, and then do one of two things:  1)Wear a condom EVERY SINGLE TIME! Even if she swears up and down that she's on birth control. Even if she shows you the pack with pills missing from the appropriate slot.

Getting a little safe nookie is one thing but getting her pregnant and being responsible for a baby is another thing entirely.    Don't do it!!!  If she wants a baby, let some other sucker take care of it, you don't need the hastle of being a father at 17 years of age.  Sure, she is the only one for you right now because you may think you are in love.  Actually, you may just be in lust.  Anyway, if she leaves you for another guy to get her preggie, there are plenty of other girls out there.  Don't tie yourself down now.  You've got too much living to do before you settle down.|`|CApnEZ83aa	NO!!  You are too young.  Wait until you are in your 20's and married.
aba81bf0dd1e368904161a0c15faf44caa	You have to tough it out past that pain.  Once your milk comes in, the pain goes away.  My son was nursing so hard and often at first that I had literal blisters on my nipples.  I used loads of Lansinoh, and just gritted my teeth.  Once he was latched on, I found the pain became more bearable.    Like I said though, if you can get to the point where your milk comes in, it gets MUCH, MUCH better!    A nipple shield is also something you might think about... it will protect your nipples somewhat, but just be aware that once you start using one, it's hard to get your baby to latch on to your naked nipple after that... just like if you started him on a bottle and then tried to go back to the breast.    Good luck, and kudos for you for thinking of trying after such bad experiences!|`|2arZOZWgaa	It does hurt at first because baby is learning how to get milk out.  I remember being in pain for the first week or so, but I was determined to make it work. You have to remember during those tough times why it is that you want to breast feed (don't have to clean and make bottles, don't have to buy formula, your mother-in-law pressuring you to give up, etc...). Do everything you can to help soothe the pain. Take a warm shower. Ice pack or heat pack yourself before and after you nurse. Use the lanolin cream. Make sure you are switching sides. Try different positions.    If you can get through the first two weeks (mostly the first week) then you should be set to go. Don't give in or be tempted to use formula until then. By then, you milk has come in, baby has started to get the hang of things, you start recognizing when baby is hungry, and lastly, the pain goes away. Then you feel very proud of yourself for doing what you always wanted to do.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Some soreness is normal -- your breasts aren't used to used in that way, and baby too is learning a new skill.    Was the LC you worked with a board certified lactation consultant? Anyone can hang out a shingle and call herself an LC or 'lactation nurse' ... and many of them dont' know squat.    My best guess, based on what you've written is that baby never latched correctly (do you have flat or inverted nipples?), which caused you pain AND kept you from getting the stimulation your body needed to keep making milk. So you dried up.    I would contact a board certified LC now.  Tell her about your past experiences, and be sure you get the help you need to get a good start. If, for example, you have flat nipples, she might recommend breast shells or exercises to help the nipple protrude.|`|iMULlxdgaa	Nursing shouldn't hurt at all, I would consult a lactation consultant ASAP.|`|X6as2nOAaa	I only have one baby and it didn't hurt at all. Sorry I wish I could help.|`|PYSMK0JBaa	I had pain nursing each of my children but it did subside after some time (like a month or more). I don't have any advise except that you do get used to it and the pain dulls. I saw a lactation consultant with each of my children and the only thing she could tell me was that some women have very sensitive nipples because I had the latch correct. Good luck!|`|weE5FxCfaa	everyone says if you do it right it doesn't hurt, but that is not true for everyone.  i have had 4 children and nursed them for over a year.  with each one it hurt.  the best thing i have found is lasinoh lanolin.  it is in a purple tube and can be found in the baby section at walmart and other stores like that.  lasinoh brand is the only brand that doesn't need to be washed off in order to breastfeed.  try putting this on after each feeding and it should really help.  other than that you have got to keep trying and just get through it if you want to breast feed.  eventually it will get better.  with my 2nd i had mastitis and had to nurse her exclusively on the infected side until it broke up.  now that was excruciating for about a week and i just had to gear my self up and do it.|`|WIdhBSimaa	IDK|`|cezWu0Wnaa	it hurt pretty bad for the first couple of weeks and then gradually the pain subsided. However I just had my first baby so I guess my nipples had to get used to the process. You should talk to a doctor. Good luck!|`|fOOfLVoKaa	YOUR NIPPLE HAS SALIVA DEPOSITS FROM YOUR HUSBAND|`|C4doHgnHaa	Does tongue-tie run in your family?  It primarily occurs in males.    Nursing was excruciating for me-- I screamed in pain, though not a peep during labor.  About a week later, my husband mentioned tongue-tie, as he had it when he was born.  Sure enough, my little guy couldn't stick his tongue out, which meant when he was trying to suckle, he was clamping my nipple down in a virtual vice.  He also wasn't really getting milk out, which made him frustrated and my supply dwindle.    Few doctors check for tongue tie at birth anymore.  Mine didn't and we wouldn't have known had it not been for our own discovery.    (BTW, tongue tie is when the frenulum (the little flap of tissue underneath the tongue) extends to the end of the tongue.)  It can be corrected with minor surgery.  once my little one's was corrected, I was able to go back to nursing, without the pain.  Best of luck.|`|AA10893102	I had the same issue but I toughed it out...it was really really hard, but trust me, you can do it. Soreness is normal. Make sure you are breaking the latch correctly when you take the baby off the breast. Also, if you use nursing pads, you MUST change your nursing pad with each feeding. Having the wetness on your nipples contributes to the soreness. Lansinoh helps also. I used it BEFORE feedings to help with the soreness (which would generally go away after about a minute of feeding). Also, tylenol helps. It seems like the pain is so bad that something over the counter couldn't possibly make a difference, but it does. Those are the things that helped me. Most importantly, don't give up! It WILL get better. One day your baby will latch on and you wont' feel any pain at all, trust me. : )    ETA: Oh yeah, another barbaric thing that helped me deal with the pain was to bite down on a burp rag as I was putting the baby to the breast. lol. Also, make sure you are bringing the baby to your breast and not bringing your breast to the baby. It can be kind of scary, especially if you are sore, because you think that the baby will chomp down like a piranha, but it actually diminishes the pain.
UpuFY0HQaa	I have breastfed my baby for the last 7 months. I believe it is normal that one breast produce more milk than the other. It happened to me too. My personal experience is to feed or pump more often and drink lots of liquids to increase the milk supply.  There are many expert's articles regarding this online and books in the library. You can also talk to the lactation consultant of the hospital you gave bith.|`|SNVauR3laa	Does your son favor your right over your left? I know that my daughter prefers the left side. I think it is heartbeat related.   Breastfeeding is supply and demand. You can up your supply by pumping right after your son eats. It is a pain, but works. Also, you should be sure to drink a ton of water.   Anyway, 4 ounces in a session is really good. I have been pumping for eight months now. Another explanation if you are using a double pump could be the suction on one side. You may try switching sides. My milk supply goes down just before my period.    I also have started manually manipulating milk ducts while pumping, which sometimes taps into some milk that otherwise wouldn't express.     Good luck to you.|`|4uTg1mWPaa	Im the same way, I pump twice at work and my right breast produce more than the left...thats normal. And I eat Oatmeal everyday (to produce more milk) and i take Fenugreek herb tablets (get them at GNC or Rite Aide) and I also drink Organic Mothers Milk tea to keep my milk flowing! :)|`|vue9NOhYaa	Most women dont' produce perfectly evenly.  Maybe you are holding the pump at a slightly different angle on the left?  Or maybe you pump one side first, so the letdown is better?    It doesnt' really matter. You're getting 4 ounces at a time, which is great for any pumping mom.  You could try pumping in a different order, but if it doesn't help, don't worry about it.|`|yPNvecc7aa	My mom always told me that beer helps your breastmilk.    Sure enough, my sister-in-law was just prescribed "a beer a day" by her physician because she is not producing enough. On the first night, she drank 1/2 a bottle of beer and her boobs started leaking like crazy.    Try it!|`|aba81bf0dd1e368904161a0c15faf44caa	I am the same.  I get 3 from my left, and about 1 and 1/2 from the right.  My left has always been the high production boob, the right the lazy boob.  Is one of your bigger?  I know they say that has nothing to do with it, but my bigger one always produces more...    You might try having your baby nurse from the left more frequently to even things out, but honestly I wouldn't worry about it.  I stressed out about it forever, until I figured out that my baby is absolutely fine and he is getting what he needs from both.    Good luck!|`|G1ZgTqNcaa	You should pump both sides at the same time.  This will significantly increase your supply.  I would only get about 4 oz each time I pumped, but when I started pumping both at the same time, after about a week, I started getting between 5-7 on average and sometimes as much as 9 oz.  It is normal to get more out of one then the other.  Good luck|`|cezWu0Wnaa	Let your baby do the job. Breasts always respond better to a baby's suck than a breast pump.|`|hGqQIusSaa	Generally one side produces more than the other, but not always (I produce the same on both sides.)    You can try supplements to increase supply, but be careful. A few months back I tried Mother's Milk Tea to increase my supply and yes it worked, but my daughter refused the milk.  I drank as directed, but it must have affected the taste of my milk.      Pump as often as possible. The more demand you put on your breasts the more you will make.  I'm currently battling a head cold and experiencing a low supply.  I have to pump every hour for the next few days to get it back up.    It's not easy, but can be done.|`|03GQ637Raa	See the source area below to direct u to some ideas to help increase your breast milk for feeding baby.  Also, consult WEBMD.COM

Have you ever heard that children can be cruel? Be careful that the new baby name you choose doesnt set your child up for a lifetime of teasing. Celebrities may get away with ridiculous names for their babies because of their wealth and fame, but your children will be thankful to you for passing, on having named them anything too zany.     Even if you have not chosen a first name that is out there, be careful of what a childs initials spell out. Theresa Irene Thompson sounds fine when you speak it out loud, but when you write her initials down it could cause some prefuse blushing. So make sure that all the new baby names you pick dont spell something slightly obscene.     When selecting a new baby name it is wise to think of the actual meaning of the name. Whether a name means the name of flowers or a particular characteristic you need to take the meaning into consideration as well when choosing a new baby name. Choosing a name that represents your original ethnicity is also a highly popular option. Check with both parents or grandparents if you are not sure what names reflect your ethnic background and try to find out if they would be acceptable.The middle name of a child is a great opportunity to choose something both creative and or unusual    You can also use a family members surname, if suitable, as the middle name. If you are close to someone in your family and would like to use their name then the middle name is the perfect way to honor that special person in your life.    In the end, as long as you and your partner are in agreement and have carefully considered all the factors discussed here before arriving at that perfect new baby name, you will have many years of joy and pleasure with your new offspring|`|r5UfVeYbaa	Adalyn  Adda   Adria   Ailene    Alani   Albertina    Aldona  Aleen  Amberly   Amirah  Anais  Angeles   Angella  Annamarie    Anneliese  Antonina  Ariane  Arietta  Arletta  Ayesha  Brinda  Brynn  Chanelle  Celesta  Corrina  Demertra  Dominique  Diandra  Dylan  Ethelene  Evalyn  Felicitias  Hortensia  Isadora  Jolanda (YO-LAWN-DA)  Jovita  Jacinta  Kaylana (KA-LANE-A or KAY-LANE-A)  Layne  Linette  Leonie  Lilia  Livia  Miesha  Mira  Mara  Naima  Naomi  Parthenia  Reatha  Rena  Regan  Reegan  Rhonda  Rayne  Rosaria  Shaneka  Shenelle  Shawnda  Shira  Sky(lar)  Tanisha  Tianna  Tawny  Tressa  Ula  Valeria (Val)  Zandra|`|2qyqIXlRaa	I love different names and adore that fact that your daring to be original which other people don't like! its your choice!

d6e11chxaa	I would suggest cutting out Kyler, Maverick, Xander, and Zyler. Maverick just sounds like a joke after the election. Kyler and Zyler sound made up. Xander would make a refreshing nickname for Alexander, but not a great given name. I think Jack, Chase, Taylor, Zachary, and Jason sound dated or too common right now. Aaron would be my pick from the list because it's strong, classic, in line with current trends, but not common right now. If you're looking for something a bit funkier and modern, how about Grayson, Owen, Zeke/Ezekiel, Jonas, or Gavin?|`|NWEJdpocaa	I like:  Aaron Chase  Xander Maverick  Zachary Aaron    Suggestions:  Seth  Wesley  Heath  Kellen  Troy  Wyatt  Blaine|`|hCSLPz9Uaa	Jason, Chase, maverick...|`|mZi7R0Enaa	Aaron Jack, AJ is awesome!|`|6h0eCVwpaa	Aaron and Chase....the other are ok also but these 2 are my personal favorites :)|`|KXmcx8sRaa	Travis  Dylan  Josh  Anthony  Timothy  Joseph  Personally, my favorite is travis. but out of yours, i like ZACHARY|`|OHfZFR31aa	Aaron, Jack, Jason, Zachary, Alexander (Xander as a nickname)    Zachary Alexander sounds great|`|dRd5d6Bgaa	I love the name Aaron. What about Alexander?|`|sknSVTGnaa	i like zyler =D its very unique|`|tWKZVDG2aa	I love Chase, Xander and Zachary.  I don't think you should call your child Maverick as it means either:  An unbranded range animal, especially a calf that has become separated from its mother, traditionally considered the property of the first person who brands it.   Or one that refuses to abide by the dictates of or resists adherence to a group; a dissenter.|`|2QFe7onpaa	Jack is cute and not that popular. A name I love is Harrison. Or Colby.    Don't do Aaron or Jason, those are way too popular and I've never met either one that I've liked. They are all jerks. Lol.    Kyler is cute and unique. I tend to look at people's last names and go with that. Harrison, Remington or Remy, Kennedy.    Are you definitely having a boy? Raegan is cute for a girl.|`|8mQVfDRqaa	the best of those are Aaron, Chase, Jack, Jason, and Taylor.    how about combining those names so you have one as a first name and one as a middle name? like: Chase Taylor|`|XHZtwfuIaa	I LOVE Jack!!|`|Q8wDjvZ1aa	k  these are my thoughts on these names...    aaron- means exalted/strong, i mean how cool is that!  although it's a common name, who cares with a meaning like that!    Chase- my brothers name.he's 18 and when he was little there were almost no other kids around with his name... now there seems to be a ton.  i like it though.      Jack- i always thought of it as an old mans name    Jason- i just picture a middle aged guy named jason... as those are all the people i know by that name.    kyler- meh.  there is just something about it that doesn't strike my fancy.    Maverick- top gun anyone?   it sounds like something you'd name your dog not your son. although i've heard worse    Taylor- I love love love it. it's totally under used as a guys name.      Xander- means defender of mankind.   talk about setting your kid up for greatness!  although the name seems very greek god like (it is greek in origin)    Zyler - meh... doesn't have any meaning. and i for some reason here people mistaking it for tyler.    Zachary- i like this name! it's very strong sounding.  it it cute for babies, and will be great as the kid get older.  just how i feel about it.      whatever ou choose will be the right choice for your family... and really when it comes down to it it doesn't matter one bit what someone stranger like me thinks it's what you feel is the right name for your baby!   congrats.  good luck|`|twyjXSVuaa	Jason Chase  Jack Kyler  Aaron Chase  Taylor Maverick    my personal favourite is Jack Kyler|`|rQDwKZVpaa	Kyler and Maverick are pretty cool. how about Kyler Maverick "last name goes there" i think that would be a pretty awesome name.|`|jUqjg0ytaa	Xander is a great name but what would have more meaning is giveing the baby his name and calling it Jr|`|f273c7cdaf25cd05579783d5d164f701aa	I like:    Chase  Kyler  Maverick|`|qUV0xKu9aa	I like:    Aaron, Chase, Kyler, Maverick, Zyler|`|jkgl9WMgaa	For our children, my husband and I each made a list of at least 20 first names that we liked.

LiPoEBenaa	It's a warning sign for pre-eclampsia. Your doctors will monitor you more closely and make sure your blood pressure is staying down. Pre-eclampsia can lead to premature birth in babies, so it's important to follow doctors orders and take good care of yourself!|`|vue9NOhYaa	Proteinuria is a symptom, not a disease.  You need to determine what's causing it, and treat the underlying cause.  (If, for example, you have a kidney problem, you'd definitely want to get it under control before trying to get pregannt.)    Proteinuria that develops DURING pregnancy is a symptom of pre-eclampsia, but it doesn't sound like that's what you're asking about.  A woman can't develop pre-eclampsia unless she's pregnant.
iZDsMCghaa	When my first was 7months I conceived my second. When my second(a boy) was born my daughter was 16 months. My daughter was an incredible big sister. She would hold his baba for me, showed him loads of affection and loved being my littlest helper.  When he was about one and walking they started playing more and more together and just grew up close in age and close in heart. I didnt have to be their single source of entertainment because they played with each other,like having two cats,lol. Now they are 5 1/2 and 7 and quite close. Occasional battles but overall very close and considerate to each other. I wouldnt have had it any other way and I would reccomend having kids close like this. No jealousy. My older brother was 4 1/2 when I came along and he hated me from day 1, soooo jealous because he was "it" for so long.  I also strongly feel that how YOU handle it plays the biggest role in how your oldest handles it.    ADD:: I just noticed your daughter's name is Emma. Our first was Emily(we call her Emmie).|`|mZlPj8Guaa	My boys ar 14 months apart. We did not plan that. It just happened.    The sooner that you do this, the easier it will be on the first. My oldest never really knew about the special attention his brother got. So for my wife and I, we did not have the attention problems.    But today.... Well that is a different story.    If I were you, I would 'Get busy' and try and conceive sooner than that dreaded 35 years old. Doctors then order a slew of tests to test for downs syndrome and other birth defects. They also say thatthe older you get, the harder to conceive it will be.    Good Luck. Sounds like you have a plan. just a little nudge to start it up.|`|tu7aqUoxaa	try to keep them 2 years apart, to try to have the baby by July of 2009 is too late, you will have to try around October of 2009 to give birth by July 2010.Good Luck!!! My baby is due July 2009 and I conceived around October of 2008|`|8gI2WPpbaa	1) Of course your body will be able to support pregnancy. Do not worry.    2) I have some relatives with such an age difference. This is very nice since your son will find somebody to play with.. do not give more attention to the younger, and it will go on well    Best luck..|`|oBk8NbNdaa	My brother & I are  2  and a half years apart.|`|MoUtk7cUaa	i am a second child that fits your description of 'less than 2 years' difference in age.  it really depends on the parenting skills and the parents in general.  i was really lucky to have parents that really cared and never put one child above the other in terms of attention, needs, love, etc., using individual needs as a Gage for what kind of attention.  if you're not cut out for it, or not ready, the rest is moot.|`|zLyAh0qvaa	I really think it is a personal preference.  Me, personally, I have always said that I wanted the first child potty trained before I tried for a second child.  I didn't want to have 2 children running around in diapers.  Double the diaper changes and double the expense of diapers.  Every women's body is different but I don't see why you would not be able to support a healthy pregnancy after 11 months.|`|lN9jcKYhaa	hold the baby in until the same exact day as the other one was born.|`|Dhsyroekaa	My brother and I are only 13 months apart.

Then to answer your quesiton, No she cannot stop taking birth control with your sperm in her and become pregnant the next day.|`|3XFZHhWgaa	First of all, she should not stop the pill until her next period, and then she should not be pregnant.  Also, why are you hurting this girl? Your having sex with her, but no feelings? Your just using her for your pleasures and thats not fair. Leave her now before she gets even more attached because its no fair to her.|`|EtwDYTC2aa	It's a rare possibility.

pZg05uygaa	This site has a bunch of great info on using herbs and fertility awareness:  http://sisterzeus.com/infergen.html     Fertility awareness will help you determine when you're most fertile and can help you figure out why you haven't gotten pregnant yet.   I used vitex/chasteberry to regulate my menstrual cycle and accidentally got pregnant...it made me ovulate more frequently. I would really recommend taking it if something is weird with your cycle, especially if you used to take the pill or other hormonal birth control.  I would also recommend the book "Taking Charge of Your Fertility."|`|gwuTKiNXaa	I drink this herbal tea it called herb lore a lot of people have conceived on this that have been trying for years.

I've been TTC  2 for 2yrs+, so I'm starting to explore natural remedies - acupuncture worked for me to help with breastfeeding problems (no let-down) so I'll probably try that.  I'm also just about to start using Blackmores Pre-Conception Conceive Well Gold (cost me NZ$47.50 for one month's supply (about US$25) - so it's going to be expensive if I keep using it) - big list of ingredients so I won't bore you with them.  I'd talk to a natural therapist to make sure you're taking the best things for you.  BABY DUST|`|5805bf3a9bb2e4808ef2d73593aaab11aa	I don't know if anyone has told you about the Billings Ovulation Method. This thing is legit. This is how my husband and I got pregnant, and it's totally natural. It teaches you to pay attention to your body and the natural signs. It sounds crazy, but it's actually very logical. It's scientific- not the basal temp thing or an ovulation test, but since every woman is different you learn when your body is fertile. It doesn't cost anything, it's just a method and it's amazing. Here's the website where you can learn about it if you're interested. www.woomb.org  The best of luck to you!|`|dum9pRHFaa	Try fertility acupuncture, that's what I'm currently doing.

6bwhrZUsaa	ABSOLUTELY NOT. I'm assuming that everyone who answered this question so far is NOT inflicted with the burden of actually having to deal with one of these disorders...? The only reason I have been bulimic for years is because I learned about it. I didn't learn it in school, but if you teach girls that are at their most malleable and insecure stage of their lives about these extreme ways of losing weight, I guarantee all you do is teach them how. Does showing kids pictures of STD's, or warning them what the affects AIDS has keep them from having sex? Of course not, so showing girls that are desperate to be thin and accepted by their society/peers pictures of rotten teeth and girls with their ribs showing WON'T stop them from doing it. If anything, it will start it earlier. But that's just the opinion of someone who actually knows how these girls feel....    Take it or leave it|`|cj7sSPZEaa	I think that kids need to be made aware of it so that they can recognize if they or their friends have a problem.  And I actually think that I did learn about it in health class in 7th grade.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	it is in the states!! reasons why: it's a true disease and it can be prevented...girls need to be aware of what they are doing to their bodies...|`|L9zUQbKJaa	definately! I think that anorexic thoughts start at that time. I was anorexic at age 14.........It is really a very important message and your body image seems to be everything at that age!! You just got your period, you are getting curves sometimes and boobs!! You are starting to like boys and really want attention, and you cant be FAT! I was very insecure at that age.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	Definately.  That's about the age that all kids start feeling self-concious about themselves and unfortunately they don't know enough about the diseases to know how to avoid them or even how to recognize they have them.  I had a friend who was sick from 13 to about 21...maybe longer.  I didn't realize she had the problem till maybe her teens and had no clue how bad it really was.|`|tnhF5Gaiaa	I think it should be for sure, it is a very serious issue that many people, mostly girls, deal with. I have had issues with it in the past and it never fully goes away, one of my good friends is having issues with it right now, and a bunch of my other friends have had issues with it in the past. It needs to be taught in schools.|`|dkR5XPwpaa	I think i should be taught in school, most importantly i think they should tech us where to go and what to do if we are anorexic or bulimic|`|7IHMjy2caa	If you are asking about teaching the risks and dangers, I definately think they should.    Eating disorders are a quickly growing problem for teenagers and women today. Everyone should know the danger they are doing to their body by not taking care of it properly.|`|qWkItmO4aa	yes cause that way they know what damages it does to the human body|`|KtczrXoqaa	YES it should be. Teachers need to go more in depth about how this is a serious mental disease. so many people dont really get that that person cant control it.  And more and more kids are developing them. they should be taught about positive body image and healthy eating habits and ways to prevent these disorders.

Do you realize that an adult in 50 degree water, only lasts a few minutes... You put a baby in that and they will get hypothermia immediately. It should only be a few degrees cooler than what an adult likes. You people might want to research things before offering advise on them...

4YfehneDaa	My daughter is 13 months and only weighs about 18 lbs.  i don't know how different it is for boys, but her MD doesn't see a problem with it.  She probably weighed about that at 10 months also, or less. She also was breastfed and on solids.  What does his MD say?  I dont think you need to worry about the percentile as long as the MD thinks hes healthy.|`|9kPPmazoaa	As long as your doctor is happy with his weight & health, than there's nothing to worry about.    Every baby is different and they all grow at different speeds. If he's happy/ healthy... than that's all that matters :-)|`|7Raehh4daa	Don't worry, my children did the same thing.  Always remember; someone has to be in the lower percentiles!  That's how they come up with them in the first place!  My two very healthy sons didn't even appear on the charts at one point before their first birthdays.  I breastfed exclusively, also.  This is all anecdotal, but I hope it helps!|`|heDtLdz5aa	as long as your baby is healthy and is gaining weight on his own curve..my niece was 7 ibs 5 oz at birth and at 12 months only weighed 18 ibs..but was gaining on her own curve..my sister would laugh because my son is exactly a year and a day younger than my niece and at 4 months he weighed 18 ibs...every baby is different..as long as the ped has no concerns on his development everything is okay..|`|6e1884100ea01ca5c165183590f92363aa	My children are all in the lower percentiles (i.e. 5th to 10th and sometimes less). But they are healthy and they grow steadily. That's what's important.    Genetics plays a big role. Do you have some shorter or smaller people in your family or your husband's family?|`|9AuGW9Q2aa	When babies become more active, (rolling, crawling, cruising, walking) their weight gain drops off. He'll pick up again soon. bring up your concern to your ped at your next appointment for peace of mind.
39c2446b919f263832a80ca402b9f06eaa	Actually, it's not recommended after 36 weeks, but if you are having a normal, healthy pregnancy, it should be fine. Check with your doctor to make sure that it's okay. Some airlines have restrictions too so you'll also need to check with them. At your stage of pregnancy, the risk isn't TOO high, but it may make your morning sickness worse.     I found a site that has a little more information, including possible risks.    http://www.pregnancy-info.net/wellbeing_...|`|e8HCEZDpaa	It's not really that good for you at any point in your pregnancy because of the pressure. You aren't supposed to fly after 8 months. However, I know of many women who suffered from pPROM (preterm premature rupture of membranes) or in other words their water broke shortly after a plane flight. A lot of these women were any where from 18-26 weeks. pPROM is a very serious thing as it will likely end you in the hospital on bed rest until your baby comes, which could be at any time after the water breaks.|`|xNSwX7O4aa	i would'nt because it could damage the insides|`|seU9VwIJaa	I fly all the time and nothing has happened to me. My baby is perfectly fine and due Feb. 23rd. My doctor did say that he didn't want me to fly after 7 and a half months though. Your chances of preterm labor are higher. Congrats and good luck!!!|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	no... they say don't fly after 8 months because of the chance of going into labor...anytime before that is okay though.|`|oXFVRYCsaa	i was told not to fly after 7 months, i don't think it is very good before that though really personally because of the presure|`|1Nd4XrjVaa	i didn't know humans could fly :O:O|`|mBeGdFO2aa	If you're a flight attendant and fly everyday the change in air pressure can be an issue, but if you're talking about taking the odd flight, you're fine :)  Dr's recommend not flying in the last month but until then most women are fine.|`|fHgbL046aa	I heard a women can fly but not close to her due date in case she goes into labour. I never been on a plane and never will,but doesn't everyone feel the pressure when flying.|`|AA11220327	as long as you clear it with you dr it should be fine. since everyones case is different, clearing it with the dr 1st is always a good idea. most airlines wont allow women that are 36 weeks or more to fly except in an emergency (family illness or death)|`|AHZLEFEcaa	flying is bad if you crash|`|3505983107c631451310c5009361ae76aa	ive heard that too but i heard that the further along your gone the more dangerous it is. not sure if its true or not tho ....|`|XyAWAoSoaa	You can't fly after 6 months according to most airlines but I have known a lot of people who have traveled by air. It is best to speak with your doctor about it... and see what your risk factors are.|`|ba11762437a3276bc8acfec56128a271aa	I think they say you shouldn't fly in your first trimester, and then most doctors don't want you to fly after about 35 weeks. My doctor said wait to fly until after my 12 week visit, and then I was fine until around 35 weeks and thats just because it can put you into early labor. Some doctors don't care, and others say don't fly at all. Especially if you are already at risk, etc. I would just check with your doctor. You should see him for the first time somewhere between 8 and 12 weeks. Good Luck and Congrats!
2owaSpf0aa	Suggestion: Morgana. If you're really into Arthurian legend, you could go with Morgana Faye, like Morgan le Fay. It might be a bit too much, though. Variants on her name include Morgane or Morgain.     I quite like the girls names. The  boys names are a little out too there for me to appreciate them. I love Arthur.    Dragon-like names:   Draco - Latin for dragon.  Drake - I know it means male duck, but there was a time when it meant dragon.  Elliot - The invisible dragon in Pete's Dragon.  I quite like Draco and Elliot.    Saphira - Dragon from the Eragon book series.  Kaida - It means 'little dragon'.   Pandra - It means 'chief dragon'.  I love Kaida and Saphira. They are unusual, but not too unsual, and sound really pretty.     Female Arthurian names:  Guinevere.  Gwen.  Elaine.  Gwyneth (or Gyneth).  Iblis.  Iseult (or Isolde).  Morvydd.  I absolutely love Guinevere and Isolde. They are just beautiful. I also like Gwen, Gwyneth and Elaine.    Male Arthurian names:  Bran.  Cai.  Daniel.  Tristan (Or Drystan)  Gareth.  Hector.  Gwyn.  Lucan.  Merlin.  Tor.  Ywain.  I love Lucan, Tristan and Tor. Masculine and gorgeous. I like the others, too, those are just my personal favourites :)|`|a7yQGSX6aa	All of these names are outrageous.Your children will be teased.|`|4ilM2hCwaa	Well, Arthur, of course is the top name in that category.    for a girl, Anna was Arthur's sister.

Loraine is beautiful and Lynet is nice as well. Gaheris is very unique, not sure how to pronounce, but Gawain is gorgeous. You could also consider its other spelling forms. Arthur is a great, but I'm not very keen on the middle name.

50iYxQ9Saa	I know that pulling on the ear is a sign of teething, I'm not sure about throwing up though.     My niece pulled on her ear all the time when she was teething. Baby Orajel will work wonders, she might fight you on it while putting it on but she will calm down after she realizes how much better she feels =)|`|M5E3mDBJaa	Vomiting isn't a sign of teething.  Especially if she's throwing up curdled milk or food matter.  It sounds more like a stomach virus.  I would take her to pediatrician for a complete evaluation.|`|Hm7MtmYPaa	No, vomiting is not a sign of teething.  She needs to go to the pediatrician.|`|ostF23Omaa	it's possible just give her oragel that should help, or message her gums with a cold rag.|`|9m2opi6xaa	throwing up is not some times diahreia but not throwing up  my son ran a fever   pulled on his ears  and had diahreia    when I took him to the doctor they said those were all very normal signs of teething. He was around 5 months old|`|9Mr14w6Qaa	Sounds to me that she may have some stomach flu and with her pulling at her ears maybe a bit of ear infection...I would have her pediatrition check her out|`|B5AKcZ5Laa	no your baby has a stomach virus take her to the doctor and make sure to give her pedialite or something like tht to keep her hydrated.... signs of teething are sometimes fever lots of slobbering and chewing on fingers blankys binkys etc. and crying|`|PNwDcxQMaa	yes because the teeth are bothering her she will need to hold on to something to give her comfort|`|rdpZrBc9aa	She may have an ear infection.

2l7lbcJWaa	I have taken Plan B once before and it totally messed up my cycle. And you should be that worried since you said your period comes on the 9th, you haven't even missed it yet. Anyways, you should hurry and get on birth control so that you wont have to go through so much trouble everytime you have sex. But yeah, its completely normal for it to mess up your cycle. It also gave me very bad cramps.|`|AA11294818	Plan B does not do nice things to any of the parties involved. So yes, your body's cycles will be messed up. You're probably not pregnant.    This may be a lecture, but it's mostly just plain fact: retroactive 'birth control' is not responsible.|`|b5e5871eb50190922c53af2a93a57602aa	The plan B makes your body get your period or makes it think it is going to get it-It may make your period messed up this month-I've taken it and gotten my period a week later after taking it-So you may not be back on a regular for a month or two-Your fine.  But if you take the plan B as an extra precaution when you used a condom and it didn't break or anything you are going ot mess up your period because you dont need the plan b.  Only use it when you really need to|`|X9Dpyrg9aa	If you used a condom and used Plan B then I don't know what you are worried about. Calm down, the 5th is before the 9th. This time Plan B just probably didn't effect you in the same way. If it is after the 9th and still no period, then maybe you should take a test but until then don't stress. it sounds like you should be fine.|`|PN7ELn3aaa	Plan B can alter your cycle for a month or two, but I don't think that the pill could cause your period to be irregular for an entire year. Your living conditions and environment have more to do with that. Maybe you are just more/less active than you were or your diet could have changed...you could be under more stress...etc.     Take Plan B for sure if you are worried, I'm sure it isn't going to hurt you.|`|XyAWAoSoaa	First off, the longer you wait to take plan B the less effective it is so there could be a CHANCE you are pregnant even though they say within 3 days.    Second of all.. plan B can mess with your cycles as you've seen before so it could just be off track. If you think you could honestly be pregnant go take a pregnancy test or see your doctor.    Best of luck :)
hKJIDdVqaa	my family eats very little meat, but my son eats none and he is a vegetarian on his own accord.  Eventually you child will form her own opinion, let her.  Tell her the pros and cons on meat, or why you do not like meat.  Generally meat is not good for you yadda yada yadda, however moderation with meat is fine for you.  Use your discretion it is your child, not your families......As for your family calling you a freak, remind them your upbringing by them influenced the decisions you make today.  What was their part in making you a vegan......|`|cAtWxJG1aa	if you want your daughter to eat something different from what everyone else in the house is eating, i'd make sure you've prepared something that just needs to be warmed up.  i wouldn't think it fair that your mom or siblings would have to make an entirely different meal for her.  beyond that, i think the conversation just has to be with the adults, along the lines of 'i'm the mother and this is the choice I've made and I need you to respect it."  if they really won't, and it's that important to you, then you need to hire a babysitter who will listen, instead.    as for whether to occasionally let it slide ... it depends on your reasons for your daughter to be vegan and how important it is to you.  is it a moral issue for you? a religious one? a health one?     also consider your mom's reasons.  does she just have a different belief system, or does she have genuine concerns about your daughter's nutrional intake? kids do have different dietary needs than adults, so if she's worried about whether your daughter is getting everything she needs,  perhaps you could reach agreement better by sitting down and going through what she does eat and how it satisfies her nutrional needs (or, if there's actually a deficiency, how you could fix it while still staying true to your own beliefs) and/or relaying whatever your pediatrician has told you about her diet.|`|AkFag8tNaa	For starters I wouldn't throw in the line that you know better (that's immediately putting you on a pedestal and your diet isn't "better" than any one else's. If you are upset by them feeding her things that contain animal products/by products etc.....make sure you buy and pre-prepare foods for her that can easily be given when you aren't around.|`|B9KwqnuDaa	I am a vegetarian on a slow transition to raw vegan. I eat about 90% vegan and about 50% raw. My parents and family think I'm completely crazy too. I would just present them with all the knowledge regarding your choices. Like the documentary "Raw for 30 days", and there is lots of literature on the subject for example David Wolf and Dr. Gabriel Cousens. Explain to them that she is your child and they should support that you want to raise her as healthy as possible. Hopefully they'll see and respect you for that.   I wouldn't take things away because that would make you out to be the bad guy and even though it's bad for her it's not going to severely harm her. Also I wouldn't tell her that grandma doesn't know better because that would make your mom look bad to your daughter which isn't a very good thing to do. Good luck with this!|`|0I9Fm00Naa	Being a vegetarian is a lifestyle you chose for your self, At her age your daughter is still growing and needs the protein and vitamins she would get by eating foods with meat in them , MILK  an milk products are especially important for her age because she needs the extra calcium for building strong bones and teeth.without it she will be suffering with osteoporosis at a very early age in her life. I have a friend and his wife has raised her child as a vegetarian as well , She has had some serious problems as a result of her vegetarian diet.When she gets older is when you should give her the opportunity to decide on her own weather or not she wants to become a vegetarian  .Your wrong in making that decision for her this early in her life. Before you force this kind of a diet on her you should contact a pediatrician and get the facts first.Find out what complications she could possibly suffer resulting from your diet.Iam sorry but you don't know better , your mother is right in this case and your the one that is going to mix your daughter up and she is the one that's going to suffer in the long run.|`|A7SJT50Kaa	oh i know how you feel. i'm not vegan/vegetarian, but i do try to make sure we eat only organic or at least all natural.   this link shows what i just went through with my MIL. thankfully, my hubby is backing me up or i don't know what i'd do.  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...    tell them if they refuse to respect you as your child's mother, they will not be able to spend time unsupervised anymore. this means you would need to be ready to follow through and have someone else watch dd while you are out. that's how i'd handle it.    ***You are the mama...YOU make the rules for YOUR CHILD.    EDIT: i can't stand ignorant people who *think* they know something...YOU DON'T NEED MILK TO GET CALCIUM! there are PLENTY of other foods that have MORE calcium than milk.    YOU DON'T NEED EGGS OR MEAT EITHER!|`|1L1AxWoXaa	This is really tough because of the lack of a controlled environment. I am not a Vegan but you have a right to raise your daughter to your beliefs. I would have a VERY serious talk with your mother. Tell her that she is your daughter and you plan to raise her to your lifestyle. She can call you a freak all she wants but it doesn't change the fact that she is not this child's mother, you are.    You may want to consider putting your daughter in daycare while you are school should your mother dig her heals in on this. You mother is doing your a favor by watching her but that still does not give her the right to feed her things she is not suppose to have. I would be leary about taking the thing from your daughter once she has it. Or even bringing the issue up in front of your daughter. It would be kind of harsh to take it away from her and she shouldn't see the conflict. Good luck!!!|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	First, understand that this is your personal choice and it doesn't necessarily mean you "know better" than the meat eaters.  You would probably get your mother to understand your side more if you take on a different attitude (trust me, I've been trying to explain to my husband for years why I do not approve of buying meat from the grocery store...being confrontational does NOT help.)  When you talk to your daughter about your choices, one of the last things you want to do is make her grandma out to be a "bad guy."    What I would honestly recommend is that you talk to your mother again but with a "What can we do to remedy this situation?" type attitude.  Maybe she has some suggestions, and if she doesn't, then you can come prepared with some (for example, perhaps you have a vegan meal already prepared for your daughter in a tupperware so that when you are at school, it is not inconvient for her to serve a meal that follows your diet.)|`|weE5FxCfaa	well it is your child, so it should be your decision.  if you make a stand with your mother are you in danger of losing your child care, housing etc?  maybe you could try to have some of the meat free nuggets and such on hand for them to give her.  i am not a vegan so i don't have a lot of knowledge on what all is available in that area, but i have seen a lot of meat free products that are similar to the regular ones.  at 31/2 i think it might be a little hard to explain to her about grandma not knowing better, but you can try.  just don't damage the relationship between her and your family.  other than that i don't know much else you could do other than move and put your child in daycare, but they may not feed her what you want either.  good luck!!  just fyi you daughter may not be a vegan when she grows up either way.  she will make her choice just as you did so i be prepared for that|`|170DwLM5aa	My 5 y/o stepdaughters mom is just like you.  I do disagree with it but I would never (nor her dad) give her meat.  Thats just crazy.  I wouldnt be passive with my mom.  You need to put your foot down and make it clear that she is your child and you dont want her having it.  Yes, I would take it from her.  Nuggets???? Oh no thats just bad...     I dont agree with it but its nobody place except for the parents to decide what to feed a child.|`|U9pnPXnpaa	Are you asking your mother to cook two different meals just to make your daughter something different or is it already prepared and ready to go for her?       Are you paying for the extra food or is your mother paying for it all?       I would have a tough time if my daughter and kids were living in my house and I was paying all the bills and was expected to make different meals and buy different foods for 2 people when it wasn't a life situation such as an allergy.       However, if the foods were payed for and made by the daughter I wouldn't have a problem feeding it to the child     In either situation I wouldn't be disrespectful of her choices like your mother is but I wouldn't be able to make different meals either.|`|QnJvJ67uaa	I am Vegan (ish- with lapses into home produced eggs) and have had this problem with my parents before.  What I will say first of all is that you will soon have control of your own environment and it may be worthwhile gritting your teeth atm.  We eat Vegan at home and when we eat out, but I am firm in my belief that my children should be free to make up their own minds as to what they eat when they are away from me.   Their school dinners are dairy free with occasional fish options and if they go to a party they know they are free to choose what to eat. Often they will ask if something has dairy in it because two of my boys have an intolerance...but its THEIR CHOICE.  On the other hand I make sure that when they ask why we don't eat meat that I tell them the truth about what happens to animals (in as non graphic a way as possible :P ). Its my job to educate them and provide healthy cruelty free food at home so they know they miss out on nothing by being Vegan.  Tough it out, your mum doesn't sound like she will sit down and listen to reason. You will have your own place soon. Talk to your daughter tell her why you don't eat chicken nuggets...tell her how sad the chickens must feel etc.  Give her information but don't force her, she is from you but she is not you...when you are in Your own house you can make sure she eats only vegan at home =D  Good luck and chin up :)|`|twyjXSVuaa	This is your daughter. Your mother has no right interfering. Obviously you have to consider your daughter in this. I know she's too young to fully nuderstand but I would bring her up vegan/vegetarian but give her the choice of eating meat.    At the end of the day though, your mother has no right interfering as she is your child. Your mother brought you and your siblings up eating meat and now you want to bring yur daughter up vegan. Your mother is wrong, you're not a freak you just have different beliefs to them. If you simply didn'tlike a particular food eg you didn't like olives people wouldn't automtically judge you and call you a freak.    No, don't take food from her. If she likes it and is getting some source of goodness from her fine. And as for chocolate etc it's OK to have treats sometimes just not all the time.|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	Let her eat it! She's just a kid! When she gets older she can decide which way she wants to eat. You can't force your diet lifestyle on her. Your mother is right, I'm afraid.|`|1b9536db7eea732e7ad1f3e58cd319f2aa	I have been a vegetarian for the last 11 years and a mother for the last 10 and I have had to deal with this myself. You don't say whether you are a vegan because of religious, health, or just personal preference, all of which are your choice and should be respected. I say should but that doesn't mean that it will be. I am assuming that you were not raised vegan and that you still ended up relatively healthy. If you really feel very strongly about it than yes fight, but know that it will make your and your daughter's life unpleasant. I am going to play devil's advocate for a minute and say that if you can get them to stop feeding her the junk, ie. nuggets and root beer and switch to healthier alternatives to consider it a victory. Your mother and siblings might give in while you're around, but will probably end up feeding it to her when you're not. It will be a don't tell mommy because she just wants you to eat lettuce, secret, which just opens the door to your child thinking it's ok to lie to you. You can give your mother info on the health aspects of eating animal products, but if she's calling you a freak it probably won't make any difference. At 3 1/2 I wouldn't tell your daughter what they do to animals for food products, but you can let hear know what animal she's eating. Show her pictures of actual animals, not cartoons or drawings, not on a feed lot, but in healthier, happier environments. Don't try to guilt trip or lead her into feeling bad about eating, just let her know that they are living creatures, a trip to the petting zoo or fair is great for this. Know that at her age she doesn't really grasp life and death and that pushing that on her will only harm her in the long run, far more than any animal products. And to end this I will let you know that my daughter now greatly prefers the vegetarian alternatives and eats more at my house than at her father's and grandparent's houses, because she doesn't like the way meat tastes. You made the right choice for your diet and if you teach your child to trust you and herself, your daughter will too.
ZbnxGIsnaa	She's probably having problems with her cycles or you have a low sperm count.  I'd suggest going to see an OB doctor to see where the problem is.  =)  Then again.  There may not be a problem.  Sometimes it takes awhile for some couples to get pregnant.|`|gwuTKiNXaa	your just not trying around her ovulation time that is all... If her cycle is off that would really mess things up|`|U3prt8tlaa	Are you sure your not the problem. Have you ever been tested, had a sperm count???|`|9gHVoof2aa	we need to know more information are you having unprotected sex when she is ovulating? Does she know when she is ovulating?
NwTggQ2Baa	so far my kids have not asked me those things yet. But my friend was driving and my sister was with her(I was not but my sister told me this) and this guy was driving and I guess he got in front of her when there wasn't enough space or something, I am not very sure. Anyway, she said, "Uh, Idiot." And her 4 year old son heard her and said "Mommy, What's an Idiot?" And she just tried to explain it in a way for a 4 year old. And my sister said he was just sitting there for a wile thinking and then he asked, "Mommy, do all idiot's have penises?"     lol When my sister told me that I was cracking up.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	LOL!!!  This one will be graphic too........  "Mommy, why is your butt bleeding?"  (3 year old who still follows me to the rest room)  I couldn't keep a straight face, it was impossible!!  I told him that when girls get older they bleed sometimes but it doesn't hurt.|`|0f2deb09ad21a9b193c5c032d99753f9aa	ahh yes I can relate.  My son is also 3, and insists on coming into the washroom with me everytime.  When it's that time of the month, I do try to keep him out, because I thought he might be disturbed seeing blood, but a few weeks ago, he came in and starting asking me all sorts of questions about it.  I tried to keep it brief, and just said that it's something that happens to women and that it was no cause for concern.  Now I'm just waiting until he decides to loudly ask me about it when we're out in public.|`|AkFag8tNaa	My 9 year old son asked me about my period last year (he heard some things on the bus)......he basically said (after the explanation) that he was extremely grateful for being a boy. My 4 year old is always asking me if I have a penis and when I tell him no, he acts like I must feel terrible about it....|`|xXnFx6qLaa	Well, my boy doesn't talk yet... But let's just think about how fun it is to be in the bathroom attending to your monthly and having your toddler standing right between your legs watching you.    *Sigh*  Sometimes I just wish he didn't have to follow me EVERYWHERE.  :)|`|lkhCeAdJaa	When my daughter was born,  my son who was three at the time saw me changing her diaper and said with alarm, "Mommy!!  Sissy has a butt pee pee. It has a big crack!".    I would have laughed at that.  I probably would have said, "you won't get your bleed because you are a boy and only girls get it.  Isn't that lucky?"      Very funny.|`|j2mRop0laa	My 6 year old asked me what puberty was. lol    I just told her the facts and she said it was gross and she wasn't having that ever.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	yes i've had more penis and vagina questions than i care to share.  i've explained what comes out of what hole and why i have a "band aid" and she doesn't.  love being a parent huh?  the strangest was when darling daughter went to touch sons privates - my husband and i both jumped up - no! don't do that!  it was at that opportunity i began the "your body" talk and no one is allowed to touch it.  i try and just be as factual as possible.  i'm one of those that prefers the correct word than a made up kidy word for privates.  but i  try to stick to the facts and be nonchalant as possible.    edit - could you give him a simplified scoop of the period is - gods (or not, depending on religious beliefs) way of helping a lady carry a baby in her belly.  when she doesn't have a baby in her belly she bleeds.  would that be too much for him?|`|170DwLM5aa	I would have burst out laughing.     I would have explained that boys and girls have different parts.  He has a peepee and girls have a peepee but they look different.  He will never get his "bleed" because only girls get that.      My son is 1 so no questions like that yet.  My step daughter is 5 and she is smarter then the avg. 13 year old so no wierd questions for her yet either.|`|twyjXSVuaa	My ten year old brother walked in on me in the bathroom while I had y period . He saw blood (which was brown) and then told everyone that I'd pooped my pants. Delightful.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	My nephew actually asked me why my chest was bigger then his.He was like Auntie why is yours and mommys chest bigger then mine?My sister her boyfriend and I could not stop laughing.My sister and her boyfriend actually explained it to him.He is 4.I think they said something like that's what happen to girls when they get older.He was like oh.Luckily my boys has not asked me anything yet.|`|QnJvJ67uaa	My Friends little girl announced to her mum that when she grew up she would have a willy like Owen (my middle boy) she was soooo upset when we explained that she won't get one when she's a big "boy" LOL|`|263434b6fe9b827cbad3893e796d8d18aa	Ha, torture away.    My daughter has yet to really ask questions. But straight forward and simple is what she gets when she touches something or sees something. I don't laugh though I may smile.    I would have answered, that boys don't get a "bleed" only girls do.  And I would have said that girls don't have a penis because they don't need one, that girls pee from our vagina.|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	My 1 1/2 year old doesn't ask questions yet, but he calls his penis a "pee peep."|`|YBQvzEhGaa	My sons call it a peenie too.  My 10 year old is convinced that I am full of babies and that if I ever go to get my tubes tied they are going to find a baby in there.  He also knows that two people get naked to have sex but can not think of any other time that my husband and I get naked except for when we get in the shower (not together).  So he asked me "If two people get naked to have sex then you and dad must do it in the shower?' when I said no he looked even more confused.|`|1L1AxWoXaa	I would just be honest. Tell him girls and boys have different parts. That only Mommy's bleed.     My daughter asked me why my boobies were so much bigger than hers. When I stopped laughing I told her that hers would get bigger as she grew up.|`|f4zHMZ1iaa	I've not been asked any weird questions by my daughter yet, however she has slipped her hand up my husband's shorts and yanked on his balls unannounced.     That's funny - I would answer him honestly and then turn around and announce it to any one who would listen :). Kids are just funny. Don't forget to write that down so you can bring it up some day when he's a teenager and dating!|`|mAPSl0DZaa	First off I would correct the naming of body parts. Why do parents teach thier children this is your nose, ears, toe, knee, eye and yet when it comes to penis or vagina there is a need to divert from the proper body part name?    And I would also say boys dont have a bleed honey and leave it at that. The simplist answer will be enough.|`|AA10730513	While we are on the subject ... Somehow I have avoided the whole bleeding subject with my daughter. But when I went to pick up some contraceptives one day, she did point to the pads isle and let me know that Grandma said "Those are only for grownup girls. I can't have them until I am older."    There has been the reoccurring question about penises. Until she was about 4, she would occasionally see one and get this idea in her head that they were "milky things." (Like the udder on a cow.) She tried to milk the dog a few times and asked if we could milk a little boy at diaper change time. Every time I just corrected her and said "Only girls can make milk. That is his private part that he pee pees out of." ... She finally started to believe me at some point in pre-k. I think because one of the little boys her babysitter watched went through this phase of getting naked and running around the house every time she had to go to the other room.     We did have a moment last week. I was wrestling over something with my boyfriend and pinched his thigh ... like 1 inch above his knee. Cheyenne was kind of behind us and insisted that I pinched his wiener! That led to a nice long talk about we don't touch each others private parts.    By the way... I do intend on teaching my daughter the right words. It just hasn't come up any more since I got the nerve to do it. (I didn't want to correct her last week when she said wiener. ... And I didn't want to teach her the word penis at a time when someone had lied to CPS and said I let her be alone with a child molester.)|`|7aCH91ISaa	My oldest son (now 19) asked me when his penis would fall off like Mommy's.     I don't know if I could have kept a straight face for your son.|`|jVhWIDRnaa	Okay, this didn't happen to me-but it was something my husband said. When his little sister was born he asked his mom why her "peepie" looked different than his. Well, his mom didn't believe in making up names, so she just told him that boy's have penis's and girls have vaginas.    Well, a few weeks later they were leaving the grocery store and this woman waked past them. My husband grabbed his mom's hand and yelled at the top of his lungs "Look mommy! That lady has a vagina!!"    Yes, they still tell that story. I would have died.
AA11622701	Orange, and other citrus fruits, have too much acid in them.  They can cause upset stomachs and diaper rash.  At that age, apple, cherry, pear and grape are recommended.  If you are talking "whole fruit" and not just juice, you can add banana.|`|ZusC87WBaa	No, it's too acidic and in the very least will probably cause a nasty diaper rash.|`|RzYePezkaa	orange what?|`|4YfehneDaa	There is nothing wrong with giving it to him, for my daughter though, any citrus fruit would give her HORRIBLE diaper rash. i still dont dare feed her any!  so just watch him.|`|50iYxQ9Saa	Not an orange to eat, it's to chewy and it can get caught in their throats. Orange juice is okay, but water it down. Its to acidic for babies bellys.|`|WaYz1swwaa	apples would be better|`|M9ApBTYvaa	No, apple is good for 7 months old.|`|TqOdbhNAaa	Oranges may be too acidic for a 7 month old baby.

It has a lot of acid in it.  I just started giving my son pieces of an orange, and his is 16 months old.  Plus, the baby could choke on the wrine.|`|nsTcCQIQaa	Citrus fruits contain a lot of natural acid in them which can irritate a baby's stomach and their little bottoms.    I have not given my 8 mo old daughter just plain orange juice or anything like that, but she has had some bought baby food that is mixed fruits like banana and orange and she hasn't had a problem.|`|xRiQUZt5aa	No.     And for those who are telling you to feed the baby apples, that's also wrong. The only way you should give a 7-month-old baby apples is if they are thoroughly cooked and mashed to a baby food consistency.|`|qKnE08Rxaa	My doctor said no citrus fruits yet.
Zz1HI5VHaa	After 12 rounds of chlomid I can assure that it does not cause your period to be late. I am not guaranteeing you are pregnant, there could be other factors, ie stress. But I can tell you it is NOT the chlomid.     Good Luck! I hope you are pregnant.|`|XmEqZfjaaa	I was on Clomid and it did not make my period later.  Give it another week or so and test again.|`|Zi6Fr49Laa	When you say that you took your Clomid on days 5-9, you do mean that day 5 was the 5th day of your period, right? Because Clomid is supposed to be taken starting with days 3 or 5 of your period. I haven't heard of Clomid delaying a period. Your HCG levels just may not be high enough for the tests to detect yet. I know with my last pregnancy the first test I got was negative, but only 3 days later I got a positive. Be sure to take your pregnancy tests first thing in the morning as soon as you wake up, so that your urine is less diluted and the HCG hormone will be picked up more easily. If you wind up starting your period I would resume the use of your OPK next month. Also, why are you taking 100 mg? If you ovulate naturally 50 mg is plenty effective and safer.|`|HCmAoNjzaa	It makes you ovulate later. I am also on Clomid 100 mg CD 5-9. I O around CD 17-19. So I have a 30-33 day cycle. ***Baby Dust*** Maybe this is our month!|`|S1gJJHNzaa	it does make mine a couple days late because it makes me O a couple days late.    and the symptoms always mirror early pregnancy symptoms, so don't raed too much into that..  for me anyway.    good luck to you and God bless!
hGY08GjRaa	Okay.. sounds like most answers don't know much about EDs..  I suggest you go to Nova's website and find the video "Dying to be THin" It's a 60  minute informative video on Eatign disorders that will teach  you ALOT (i don't recommend  having your daughter watch it, though.)      Telling your daughter to just "Eat" is like telling a cancer patient to stop making tumors. She  has a disease. She needs treatment. She CAN'T just eat.     Please talk to a doctor that can recommend an Eating Disorder specialist.|`|97998ea5cfab786153b0361648864558aa	NO thats fucked up and she will hate u forever. It is just a phase just chill.

How about seeing a nutritionist?  They can show her how to eat right while maintaining a healthy weight.    Tell her that, if she doesn't eat, after all her fat is gone, her body will start to deplete muscle tissue.  Her organs may fail and she could die.  Tell her about Karen Carpenter, the singer who starved herself to death.    Or look up pictures of the starving people in Africa and show her what happens when people don't have a choice to eat.      The last resort may be to check her into a mental hospital or some other place where she will be force-fed.  Ask her if she would like to have a feeding tube forced down her throat.|`|1ca70b7849e7eae97dddbd3fdbe9e22daa	My mom actually had this problem with me and so when we went to the doctor he recomend that if i did not wanted to eat i should try going for healthy stuff so that why i know im eating but it wont gain me weight. you cant force her or else tahts gonna cause her to vomit and that will be worst.|`|twyjXSVuaa	Don't force her. I know how she feels. I'm 5"3 and 9 stone. I'm average weight but I still feel fat. Give her this bit of information. My mum is a nutrionist and knows her stuff.    If you don't eat your body reacts by releasing fat cells (or something of that sort. Don't know the exact words) which makes you put on weight. When it has run out you start losing weight, which may seem good but it's not. Food has all the protein, vitmains, calciums, carbs and calories that you need to survive. If you don't get these your body eventually shuts down and you die. Simple as that. You need around 2000 calories a day, plenty of protein, iron, calcium, vitamins and carbs to stay healthy and keep a good weight.    Foods to eat to stay healthy and slim     Protein   _____    chicken  eggs  cottage cheese  yogurt  Beans  Soy beans  Almonds  Cashew Nuts  Peanuts  Pumpkin seeds  Sunflower seeds    Vitamin A  ________    Carrot  Sweet Potato  Mango  Milk  Mozzarella cheese    Vitamin B  ________    Bread  Sweetcorn  Peas  Brown rice  Fish  Milk  Eggs      Vitamin C  ________    Fruits and vegetavbles  Esoecially Orange juice    That's just a bit of what you need.    Hope this helps|`|i3pn4jNcaa	show her videos on youtube of the real side of anorexia & how it can kill you    tell her that she cant live like that forever because shell eventually die & if she keeps it up & in the future eats regular again her metabolism is going to be slow because of the pain she put her body thru now.|`|8HnLYjK4aa	how are you going to force her to eat?|`|hdtNLIIwaa	it very well may NOT be "just a phase."  it sounds like she could be developing an eating disorder which is VERY SERIOUS.  it effects all organs of the body and is very hard to deal with.  if she is very determined to not eat anything, and you are growing very worried for her, the best thing you can do is take her to the hospital. if they determine she is at risk for eating disorder, or that she already has one, they may place her in a mental health unit where the health care staff will work with her on advanced levels to slowly help her overcome these issues.  It may seem scary, but it is the best thing you can do if nothing else seems to be working.  remember to be supportive of her but also strict with the rules laid out by the doctors.  good luck and stay strong.|`|L9zUQbKJaa	i was anorexic at age 14! You dont want to push too much, but you dont want to step back too much either! It is difficult! I think there was a point where my mother shook me crying and said, why are you doing this, why do you want to die, dont you know i love you!! and it really opened my eyes that i was hurting her!! Everyone is different and how they overcome it! I didnt until I was 17. My family always made comments about my weight, and that was the underlying issue! I went to a couselor to talk about my problems and it helped to talk to someone because of course at that age parents just dont know) Maybe get with her and say hey, I dont think that you ar efat but if you wanna do healthy stuff thats great.  work out with her and eat healthy foods togther, and try to get her to worry about healthy not fat!

nfzQkvqraa	I started a bit before 2.  He was completely potty trained during the day a couple of months later.  Then he got really sick for a few weeks and it came to an end.  Had I gotten rid of all the diapers I probably wouldn't have had to start the process again.  He ended up being completely potty trained a month before his 3rd birthday.  I stopped buying pull ups all together.  He wears underwear at night and has few accidents.  Just praise,praise,praise and if you are comfortable with it, the naked thing really does help.  (obviously only when he's at home)|`|CrjozlCjaa	You should have started a good while ago.   Boys are much easier to train than girls.

But I do not know why they would do that to a 18 month old??|`|CmxJdPh2aa	the use that for granulomas. when the scar tissue migrates to the outside of the belly button and there is usually a little pink/reddish nub in the belly button. according to my doctor its relatively painless (as far as they know) and its common to have to have this done for your baby. very little risk involved. i wouldn't be too worried. and actually my doctor said they would use it on my daughter (at around a month and a half-2 months) if her belly button developed a granuloma as she was having a bit of trouble with the healing of her button.|`|ba1de16220287f2a6ca02288c1a71636aa	The doctor used it on my son but he was 3 wks old and it was only after his umbilical cord partially came off.  I would wait to see what the doctor says.
mZzQQUABaa	had my lap on 10/31 got pregnant on 11/23...now 15 weeks|`|XmEqZfjaaa	Hi there! I had been TTC for about four years and finally went to a Reproductive Specialist that offered to do lap surgery in December 2007. In doing so, he found that my fallopian tubes were scarred from an infection from many years ago.  They were removed and I was devastated. But, in July 2008, my husband and I went through IVF and we will now have a beautiful boy that is due to make his debut on April 12th. God works miracles!    Good luck to you. If you are trying to figure out why you aren't conceiving, I highly suggest lapo surgery as it rules out anything anatomic.    xoxoxox

4nHrbehraa	You need to see your doctor. Pelvic inflammatory disease can cause the feeling of movements in the abdomen.  PID is not just related to std's, it can happen to all women but you really need to see your doctor to be checked.|`|AA11764194	May be Gas or your imagination|`|nzgZR6onaa	After birth our uterus shrinks back down to its pre-pregnancy state.It can feel like movement when actually our muscles are shrinking and pulling.|`|T1hZG4O3aa	It sounds to me that your uterus is shrinking back down. The same thing happened to me after my miscarriage and D&C. I felt that for a week or so then it went away. If it doesnt go away or you get too worried, go see your doctor and they will be able to tell you completely. Im sorry for your loss. Good Luck|`|TcuL9XOWaa	I had a miscarriage right before Christmas but I didn't need a D&C.  For about a week afterword I had tremors in my lower stomach.  It was just everything adjusting from the loss.  If your D&C was recent this could be the movements you feel.  Even though its been over a month since I lost my baby sometimes I still feel movement.  Just gas and me wishing I was still pregnant.  Its very difficult to get over something like this so you may have phantom symptoms for a while.  Just keep in touch w/your OB and whoever you feel comfortable talking to about your emotions.  It'll get better eventually.
lV8i73unaa	"Pull 'n Pray" doesn't always work.   LOTS of girls get pregnant that way!    Perhaps, you should save your allowance for a pregnancy test!  Meanwhile, don't have sex unless you are using a condom AND another form of birth control.     Also, ask yourself if you make enough of an allowance to pay for a child!!!  If not, then don't have sex!   ANYTIME you have sex, you need to be able to take care of a child, no form of birth control is always 100% effective!!! And, condoms alone have a 20% or higher failure rate! (that means that more than 20 people out of 100 who use condoms only for birth control end up pregnant!)    Good luck at not becoming a daddy right now, AND Good Luck at learning quickly, that some things are worth waiting for! And, there's MANY OTHER WAYS to "have fun" without taking the chance of getting pregnant! ... If you don't know what I mean, then you're way, wayyy too young to have sex!    *smile*|`|WlU3NFu6aa	if you arent ready to have a baby dont have unprotected sex. simple as that. better yet, dont have sex at all|`|xsZfN0JHaa	there are so many sperms that the chances are some might have arrived in her just as you pulled out. Time will tell!   Next time put on a condom for worry free sex!|`|mOayTJDmaa	Yes there is a chance.|`|AA10186411	Yes.  Maybe you should get EDUCATED before you go about sticking your penis into people.|`|39ixfEIraa	yea dude u ****** up, get some condoms, or ceran wrap or something lol, or just let her suck ur dick the mouth cant get preg....but if ur penis is small u should be ok u prob got it on the lips...  we dont need anymore welfare babies so use protection|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	It doesn't matter. It only takes a small amount to go inside and have a baby.|`|dd1c8373d258bab9181f891f88ea8dafaa	Penis in, baby out. Its not rocket science, pal.     precum makes babies just like the full on thing.|`|bVIewZe9aa	ask her to go on the pill or use a condom in future.  there, worry sorted.  and for now you have to just wait for her period.|`|BkMjabPvaa	there is precum and sumtimes you cant tell when it happens but it still can get ppl prego|`|N48qV69daa	Sex does = babies. Dont want a baby? Try condoms and birthcontrol. Pretty obvious.|`|oXFVRYCsaa	Buy her a pregnancy test why does everyone think the pull out method can stop pregnancy|`|Zbn8A7Geaa	Yes, there is a possibility.  The pre-ejaculate (pre-***) has sperm in it as well, so there is a distinct possibility of her getting pregnant.   The pull out method has never been considered a safe birth control method. You should invest in condoms OR not have sex.|`|AZRj3vaLaa	yea you could have . pre c** can get a girl pregnant from just rubbing your genitals together (dry humping)|`|9EkFrApiaa	So you pulled out?  Did you pull out while ejaculation or did you ejaculate after you pulled?  My bf and I use this method and it has never failed us no, probably you are fine.  Even couples who try to make a baby only have a 20% chance.    People will say precum has sperm when in fact the health department and medical journals have disproven this.  Of course, if you partially came in her before you pulled, then she could be preggers.  If you don't want a baby, use protection, if you don't care, don't.|`|yB8djbeNaa	there is always a chance use some form of decent contreceptive the pull out method doesnt count|`|yw0amT5daa	maybe, there is sperm in "precum", that's how my bf's little brother got his gf pregnant!|`|BDPc9P4Faa	Haha. Your screwed.|`|tA8T4QYFaa	Yes - any unprotected sex can result in pregnancy|`|tljc8Axkaa	yes there is still a chance of her geting pregnant|`|Ii5BojSlaa	Why the hell wont you use protection?? Stupid stupid... god you guys...  She's probably okay, if you came on your hand not in her.   Use protection next time or dont do it at all!|`|7xkwE3X9aa	there's a thing called pre-*** or something and you could have gotten her pregnant.   Use a condom next time!|`|gTWgbpNFaa	hiya daddy|`|qQx48XZuaa	yes but it will result in a deformation and retardation of your future child. good luck!|`|WHmTmAb1aa	Dude chill... You pulled out and chances are she wasnt even fertile at the time you did it. For any real chance you must have sex 3-4 days before her period.|`|ZKyqU6RDaa	Why did you bust on your hand? Gross? Should of done it on her Ti*s|`|Y6DUXDfdaa	Yes there is.  Don't have sex if you don't know how it works.  Ignorance is a choice.  Choose wisely.|`|gs4fwiaqaa	Why weren't you using protection. If you ***, there is always a chance of the girl getting pregnant even if you take it out right away. Because if the slightest bit gets in her, it can swim up. Sperm is alive. I suggest you use protection next time. Hope I could help! [: |`|c45f2cc9c9ad19623ffd1487918dea73aa	That's a tough one.    I think this site might help you.    http://www.childbirthsolutions.com/artic...|`|lrnImp9yaa	You should be worried.|`|mrYsltGeaa	well first im surprised that you would ask this question when everyone knows that people who haven't hit puberty cant *** and second that you are lying saying it was your gf when its ok that it was your bf. So its ok just come out of the closet like we all know that's where you are hiding and stop banging your blow up ben affleck doll and face the real world.|`|LzZtdlc8aa	na not really|`|n8Db77zbaa	yes, because pre-*** counts too. The pull out method is not a contraceptive you should depend on.|`|SX7mOZMDaa	you can get a girl pregnant weither u *** in her or not there is still sperm comming out even if u dont orgasm|`|NEA9bsbdaa	no, but you probably still gave her herpes|`|hfqUp1IBaa	There is a very good possibility.  There is semen in the pre-ejaculate also.  WRAP IT!!!!|`|M2T0UAEEaa	you definately got that chick pregnant your best bet is to skip town|`|EHAzC6c2aa	Of course theres a possibility if your not protected you ever hear of pre *** it comes out during intercourse in small amounts and you can't feel it coming out.|`|HrSnooIGaa	from pre-mature *** their is a chance. that is when *** comes out before you feel it coming out. if i was you i would have her take the pill if you were very worried. if not just from personal experiance i have full cumed inside ex-gfs and they did not get pregnant.|`|FndjFPPaaa	you always need to take precaution, precum could have gotten your girlfriend pregnant. if she isn't already or plan an simple you could just be shooting blanks..LOL|`|BbwesIcyaa	there is a pill out that prevent pregnancy before the semen starts to settle Google it and ask questions about and give it to her just in case and i don't think she is pregnant any ways u said u came on your hand after the fact|`|kI2VDaivaa	honestly, there is a slight chance you got her pregnant. When having sex...a male will ejaculate prematurely a small amount of semen. This ejaculation prematurely is thought to clean out the urethra of any bacteria and urine that might still be lingering around. Technically, you did *** a bit inside her and it has been known to get someone pregnant.     As for now,  if she doesn't have her period when its time, wait two weeks after the time she was suppose to start and buy a pregnancy test. If she is late, don't freak out...there is still a chance she isn't pregnant, sometimes stress can cause a girl to run late.    Good luck...and PLEASE next time...use protection!|`|xC30yD9Saa	Yeah, it is possible. Pre-*** has sperm that can get her pregnant.|`|1biqNzzAaa	only if your semen got into her or near her vaginal area...and if you touched her after with that hand|`|ZkcdUyCUaa	I've been pulling out for years, never had as much as a scare.|`|LYQM0lKgaa	yes, there is a huge chance. i don't mean to scare you, but pulling out it one of the stupidest things anyone has ever thought of and it doesn't work those sperm can get in through clothes even. so you could be dry humping and get her prego if you aren't using a condom.  ALSO!! if you want to not get her prego, take her to planned parenthood and get her the pill. they will supply insurance for their office as well as some plan B  also, even when she is on the pill, there is still a slight chance of her getting pregnant, so you should still use a condom.    don't take chances that can ruin your future|`|VArUXbeoaa	there is a chance that you got her pregnant because pulling out is not always full proof because of precum which comes out and you can't feel it.  Did your gf even say that there was even a possibility she was pregnant or are you just worried period because of your conscience.|`|AjmwAjroaa	dude....on your hand??
UySiU0LSaa	I love the letter z in a name. You don't get many of them in names. Go for it girl!|`|Qp79sBF7aa	I think it is an older name, not used much any more (at least in the US I don't hear it often).  I know a few pet animals named Hazel, and one lady named Hazel, but she is from another country.  Overall, I think it is really cute name!  It is not my personal first choice, but it is a good name.|`|X7u8DbV0aa	oh mi gosh..that is so cute!  haha..and i have hazel eyes.lol|`|TCpPdqcBaa	It's a very pretty name, but I have a hard time picturing it as a person's name...    It's my kitty cat's name :)|`|y4Uliyq3aa	Adorable!|`|WSziasfMaa	Its pretty cool and unique.|`|ePPSBb5Daa	Its prettyful|`|vOYyFqxRaa	Hazel is a nut and or a Maid.|`|cSOkd7Umaa	it Ok but not that nice|`|d6e11chxaa	Love it!

Oh, it makes me think of hazelnut.|`|b4J5jE7naa	like it but would probably use it as a middle name so its not to unreal|`|ZvASEWHPaa	hmmmm well it's pretty good. not my fav, but if you like it go for it!|`|ostF23Omaa	i dont like it|`|ae9fc9a3eab22a6443df9b44ecb52d00aa	I love it, its very pretty go for it :-)|`|7X0zAd9kaa	Very, very beautiful!|`|4ilM2hCwaa	http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054545/|`|dGBrlJvgaa	I love it!|`|D5gj2h7Jaa	I think it's pretty!|`|yJW00L9Haa	very sophisticated and pretty. I think Hazel is nice along with Gretel.
4CMQuJgOaa	Yes put him on child support and have it garnished from his check. You can go through the courts prose (meaning no attorney) call your court house and ask them how to proceed. Get everything in writing.     They will take in your income, his income, child care, insurance.|`|VwMkiLFPaa	LOL...so you knew he wasn't exactly the ideal Daddy but you kept sleeping with him anyways. Now how does that work??    Of course you need to put him on child support.  But if you two are civil, why not try to do mediation first for a fraction of the cost. Court is just always an expensive process and it takes forever. If you two can agree amicably, then put it on paper, sign away, and submit it to the courts yourself.     If not, then to court you go. And stop sleeping with the man....|`|ft8t98Pnaa	hell yea!!!!!!! if you arent together with the childs father then yes you should... if he goes down there with you they will work with him better than if you go by yourself|`|xXnFx6qLaa	Either take him for support or don't ask him for any money at all.  It's your choice, not ours.|`|7X0zAd9kaa	Heck yes!  You need to get child support from him!  Unless he is giving you a lot more money and helping with her food, clothes, etc.|`|mAPSl0DZaa	At 22 he has a lot to learn. One of those lessons is when you are old enough to father a child you are old enough to be responsible as one. Yes you owe it to your child to get child support. Its not a choice.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	I would take him for the child support.|`|k2PyXP4saa	i think u should. because if u dont then like what if he stops showing up to see the kid or if he stops supporting u guys. if hes on child support ull get half the amnt he puts in but if he stops supporting then u can get him arrested..but if he agree to work n give money without all the govt and tax cuts that means more for u guys
1G3XPiq3aa	How frustrating. =/ It seems odd the doctors wrote it off like that. Perhaps as well as his sensitive gag reflex he likes the attention he gets from you about not eating. My step brother is much older but he's an absolute nightmare to get to eat more than about 3 foods, and gets a lot of attention from people trying to encourage him to eat, which I think is a big part of why he does it. He's also the youngest in the family. If the doctors say he's getting enough nutrition from the milk at the moment, perhaps you could just stop giving him attention about it for a while. When he realizes it's not something that's going to get him special attention anymore he might want to start joining in with what you're eating.|`|ft8t98Pnaa	your job is to offer it to him.. if he doesnt eat it then he doesnt eat it.. he will eat it when he is hungry enough...|`|ENANtueuaa	I can't believe the doctors were not concerned! By what you've written, it seems like he wont chew, or doesn't know how to chew. Chewing is natural, and you don't need teeth to do it. Babies can "gum" foods before they even get teeth. I'd be demanding some answers from someone if i were you! I've worked in daycare for 4 years and i've never heard of a child having this problem. I advise you to get a second opinion.     You could always cut the baby food, and mussy food altogether, as well as the bottle. I know you said he gags on the sippy cup, but try a "slow-flow" sippy cup, playtex and avent are excellent, i used them both with my daughter since she was 6 months old. I'd stay away from the Nuby or Munchin brand with the silicone nipples, because they leak, and he he might be getting too much at once. Only offer him what an average one year old would eat. I say a one year old, beacuse you will want to cut his pieces very small, since he's just now learning. Start with some Gerber snacks, and bits of fruit, or even some Gerber meals. Only offer these solids to him, no mussy food that he can just swallow without chewing. He will not let himself starve, trust me! Just watch him closly, and you could even show him by eating it at the same, and chew with your front teeth to demonstrate. I'm just offering suggestions that might help you, but if nothing works i'd definatly get a second opinion. Like you said, he's never really had solid food, so he's probably not being picky, but to rule out the pickyness, try what i mentioned above, and see if if works for you. Good luck :)|`|AAgX0SDcaa	Is he underweight for his age? Have you ever let him get hungry enough that he will want to start eating foods appropriate for his age and feeding himself? I got crackers caught in my throat a few times (still remember it) but it didn't stop me from eating other foods.|`|263434b6fe9b827cbad3893e796d8d18aa	Your babe won't starve that is for sure and him seeing other children his age eating he'll be more likely to try it. Just keep offering. Have you tried soft foods like mashed potatoes or anything else mushy. What type of sippy cups are you using? Walmart has a brand that sucks like a bottle, my daughter loved them. Start with that, then eventually give him more solid foods. Those bottles need to be taken away, plain and simple. I don't know of a daycare that will let a 3 year old have a bottle, my daughter's daycare won't even let them have sippy cups past 18 months. They'll certainly work with your child to teach him to eat, but if they don't have any success, they may tell you he needs to be in a special school.|`|9hggEdf1aa	I agree with Amber.  The best time to try t get him to eat more food is first thing in the morning, cuz that is when he is the most hungry.  If he does not take it in the first try let him play for a while and then try again, do no give him any milk.  But then again you are a mother of 5 and you know what is best. Good luck! Try your best to stay cool!|`|CrjozlCjaa	Cut out the milk, start him at Daycare and see how he goes there.    Do not feed anything between meal times and he must eventually eat or starve.   Who is the strongest - you or him??????|`|cJLVPyAFaa	My oldest son was very much like this when he was young. He is now in his 30's and is still a very "picky" eater. You may see a big change when he starts day care cause children learn best from other children. Be assured, he will not starve to death.|`|AA10144532	I know children who have problems with food textures. They had to be trained to eat. Kaiser cannot just close your case. They have an obligation to continue to find the proper way to care for the difficulties your child is having. My suggestion is this...stop the bottle. Do not even offer it to him and keep it out of sight. Offer every kind of food imaginable or take him to the store and have him choose what he wants to eat. I don't care what it is, unless you know he is choosing jalapeno pepper, allow him to decide. Let him eat what he wants but do not give him the bottle. Now, file a grievance with Kaiser Perm. and take him first to a dietitian. Sorry to say this but you have to be tough. When he his hungry...he will eat. The bottles keep him full, and allow him to be lazy. Think about it. No effort in sucking a bottle and he does not have to eat his veggies? Smart kid. Get tough Mom and Dad.|`|5CwWM1t4aa	Has he been to a speech/language pathologist?  There are ones who specialize in feeding and swallowing issues and this seems to be a textbook case!    My other suggestion would be to see an ENT and/or a pediatric neurologist.  If he can use his oral motor skills to speak so well, he should be able to chew and swallow. (I'm assuming his teeth are fine, nothing looks abnormal in his mouth)    Some of this seems behavioral: not eating from other adults (he's almost three and he should be feeding himself, but my 3-yr-old is pretty lousy with a fork and spoon, so I know how that is!), eating things some times but not others, etc.  It may be that he likes the attention he gets from you around this.  He's the fifth child and maybe it makes him feel special...    It's unusual for a child to not want any food item (not even cake?!), but I do think that something is going on that makes desirable food undesireable for your son.  Maybe it's a sensory issue, like textures, maybe it's a motor issue, maybe it's gastro-intestinal like the GERD you suspected.    GL getting the answers you need!  And, keeping your patience!!!  I'd be worried, too! (my 3-yr-old gags on certain textures, stuffs his mouth at times, and is picky too - but far less than your little guy & I still get frustrated.)|`|IgEbbLcyaa	I am going to sound so cruel but it's not intended he is not eating as you still have him on the bottle. When you take the bottle away he will have no other choice but to eat as he won't be getting any milk so he will be hungry. It will take some time but keep it up and it will turn out good in the long run. He knows that he does not need to eat as Mammy will give him his bottle. I am very surprised that the doctor has not told you to take the bottle away. I hope you get him to eat soon just put your mind at rest because while he has his milk in the bottle there is no danger with him getting sick.|`|aSKsDtwLaa	If he gags on solid food then he is not "picky", he needs help.  As usual the Mom knows best but Doctors are dismissive.    You are going to have to get nasty with the doctors to get to see the right doctor.    On the off chance that your concern is fueling the behavior, I suggest that it not be noticed in any way while he is around.

Lots of women don't start having children until they are in their 30's, so you have plenty of time.|`|EtwDYTC2aa	get an opk and use that to pinpoint your ovulation.  at 24, it's doubtful you need pills...  you are too focused and stressed and it's preventing it, plus you don't know when the right time is...  use some tests for a few months and see what happens first.|`|ED81fQVnaa	Unless you have a fertility problem that you have been diagnosed with, I'd suggest you just NOT worry about getting pregnant and have fun with the whole sex process.  I've noticed that most women who want to get pregnant so badly- don't.. because it becomes a job and stress to them.  So relax.. have fun with the intimate part, it will come.  Before you know it, you'll be pregnant.|`|b97ab27d62fac407e8f40fe52edd9ae1aa	you can try fertilty blend. they make it for men and women. I have heard great stories about it. I started taking it this month.|`|4m15kCywaa	making use of the SE such as google or yahoo to generate some ideas first if you would like to get the massive information,nonetheless if you would not  want to put so much time,here  http://www.healthinsurance-onlinetips.in...  is a direct and useful resource for your questions.|`|xwsS0ITJaa	Call for help............me      It will happen when you least expect it.
rUPjr7hjaa	I had mine natural.  Being as you're so small, I think maybe an epi might be the way to go again.  I don't think the tearing was because of the epi.  Congrats on your second!|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	nothing wrong with either... I needed the epidural and was so much more comfortable and more able to focus after having one.|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	I am a proponent for natural birthing in general, but it's a woman's personal choice and I am all for supporting whatever she wants to have happen, as long as she's doing it from a completely educated standpoint.    Epidurals do bring with it risks for fetal distress, the inability of the mother to push effectively which can increase pushing time, increase the likelihood of needing vacuum or forceps assisted delivery, and can lead to c-section as well. Having said that, the majority of women who choose epidurals don't have all those things happen and it works great for them.     It's possible your epidural lead to ineffective pushing, but it's also possible the baby was in a poor position to descend. If the baby's heart rate was showing signs of distress the doctor would appear hurried to deliver the baby and get that vacuum on to get it done as quickly as possible, otherwise you could have ended up with a c-section.    I think it would be wise to discuss with your doctor your delivery records and the exact series of events which led to the vacuum so you know for your own piece of mind.    As for a natural labor, I would encourage you to go for it. Women are so much stronger than we give ourselves credit for. There really honestly is something different about giving birth naturally, the hormonal rush of endorphins is not blocked by the interference of epidurals or other pain medications and you physically and emotionally feel a completely different way about your birth. The pain is managable if you take it one contraction at a time, don't view labor as "x" many hours in length, view each contraction on it's own, you can endure pain for 60 seconds at a time with rest in between. Hire a doula, who are very skilled in laboring women and know all the relaxation tricks and massage and positions to keep you comfortable.    Best of luck in your decision, and know that there is no wrong way to do it.|`|DNygQdmVaa	i am all for epidural.  i doubt that had anything to do with the epi.|`|AA11220327	I have never had a medicated birth. I went completely natural with both of my older kids, with the oldest I had to have an episiotomy, but in my opinion that is better than tearing. With my 2nd, I had no tearing, and no episiotomy. But I have never had an epidural or any meds, and dont intend to with this one either, unless medically necessary (if i had to have a c-section) I just never wanted to miss out on any part of the experience|`|weE5FxCfaa	tearing had nothing to do with the epi, that just happens with really fast deliveries sometimes because you didn't have time for your perineum to stretch.  i would have the epi again.|`|nzgZR6onaa	I had five all natural births 4 at home and my husband and I deleivered one of them. We took classes of course and were well prepared.My daughter had 2 in the hospital with the epidural and could not push as well and ended up with vacuum assistance.I beleive in letting nature takes its course and not doing anything that is unessasary.I am 5'5 and normal weight is about 120-125.I only had tiny tears.There are ways to prepare your vaginal opening with olive oil and stretching starting six weeks before the birth.It works.So my answer is NATURAL,NATURAL,NATURAL...|`|GjuRYsITaa	i had exactly the same with my first didn't have epidural with any of others and they were all non assisted im a bit taller and heavier than you i don't think i would go down the epidural route again its quicker with out, my sister had her baby nearly 3 weeks ago and i talked her out of an epidural as well and shes glad i did|`|oNzCYGFHaa	I had a horrible experience with my epidural - my doctor was not in a rush and I also had 3rd degree tearing.  My problem with the epidural was that my right leg did not work (was knumb) for almost 24 hours.  I was also not able to urinate on my own and had to be placed on a catheter for 2 days because some nerve damage happened..  I don't plan on having one this time I am 5 weeks pregnant..|`|1EwbKkKCaa	I had the same thing and the tearing resulted in a surgery, but I did not have an epidural I had a spinal tap.|`|Z4IwPsrHaa	I say go for the epidural! You'll wish you had if you don't. I'm sure what happened was due to the fact that you are so small, nothing to do with the epi. So go for the epi girl! Thats what I'm gona do( And i'm small to cuz i'm 16 y/o)|`|9ebe04169d04d9c952a946440b3ad139aa	Epidurals can be fantastic for pain relief, but the downside is that you can't feel to push and this can lead to having an instrumental birth. It was possibly having the vacuum that lead to the tear, especially if they wanted to get the baby out in a hurry because he was in distress. There's no reason why you won't have a natural birth this time if you can manage the pain. Second babies are usually quicker and if he's not too big you may be fine. I'm only 5'2" and I had a natural birth and only a very small tear. You can't really plan these things but good luck anyway!
uMIvRRjoaa	Here are some links you can check out for comprehensive lists of benefits. They are also very helpful for learning how to breastfeed, and how to deal with any issues that may arise.  http://www.kellymom.com/bf/start/prepare...  http://www.promom.org/101/  http://www.askdrsears.com/html/2/T020100...    hth|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	You're giving your baby the best start to life by giving him/her antibodies, plus it helps you lose weight.|`|vue9NOhYaa	For you:  breastfeeding reduces your risk of breast cancer.                  breastfeeding usually delays the return of periods.                breastfeeding saves a LOT of money.                diaper changes are more pleasant, since breastmilk stools  don't smell bad.     For baby:     breastfeeding reduces the risk of MANY different illnesses, both common, usually mild ones (like ear infections and colds) and rare, dangerous ones (like meningitis and certain childhood cancers.)  It also reduces the risk/severity of longer term health issues like diabetes, crohns disease, and allergies.   Studies have found that breastfed babies are, on average, slightly more intelligent (higher IQ scores) than their formula fed peers.   Breastfeeding also enhances bonding, reduces the risk of tooth decay and crooked teeth, provides comfort and is ... quite simply, the perfect food for any baby.|`|xcPghcw9aa	You can lose the extra baby weight faster if you don't eat a whole more than you need. it also reduces your chances of getting breast cancer later, you can bond with your child more and babies do digests breastmilk faster than regular formula|`|33h5R8nTaa	for u gives u big boobs, it great, they are fuller and just bigger, for the baby its the best form of nutricion.|`|nKXTjqQWaa	Army Bride said it all! But to add, it also creates the strongest bond you could possibly have with your child. When you are frustrated to no end you can sit down and nurse your baby and immediately feel like the weight has been lifted off your shoulders. When baby is fussy you can offer the breast and he's calmed. When baby is fighting sleep the breast will let him drift off peacefully.. It's truly amazing and something every mom should get to experience.      TO ADD.. I was back to pre baby weight within 2 months of giving birth (of course it all needs toned again but hey!) It really burns the fat quickly.|`|a6103b5448a81b3f2d761f035154c522aa	Breastmilk is filled with living cultures (millions that we don't yet understand).  They can do everything from treat a cold, give your child immunities even when they don't get sick, kill cancer cells, help the intestine and brain develop, ect.    BREASTFEEDING DOES NOT CAUSE SAGGY BREASTS!!!  Pregnancy, weight gain, and age do.  It will also help mom relax (thank you hormones), lose weight, and will delay the onset of her first post-pregnancy menstrual cycle.    The food is never contaminated, unlike tap water and formula can be, is eco-friendly since there is no shipping, storing, or manufacturing.  It also makes baby's poop smell better.  Breastmilk is species specific and contains the perfect balance for your baby at his exact stage of development and even during sickness there is no need to supplement because breastmilk contains everything the baby needs, including the breast's ability to give extra antibodies to boost baby's immune system before he/she even starts showing symptoms!    Other studies also point to the possibility that a breastfeeding baby benefits more from their childhood vaccines than a formula fed baby.  It also contains powerful natural painkillers that can ease a teething baby or a scraped knee.|`|hTQg5tgPaa	All good.  The best choice for your child... good for the immune system etc.  just very nutritious.  You burn more calories than if you were pregnant. Decreased chance of breast cancer in the future.  (Plus for those of us with smaller breasts - up a cup size :o) !!)|`|CmxJdPh2aa	baby:  better/more effective immunity the whole time you breastfeed.  also, if you've ever had measles or another childhood disease we now vaccinate for (naturally, not that you were immunized) you can pass this natural immunity on through your breastmilk. however, with vaccinations thats unlikely.    better brain development for baby, of course.  avoid allergic reactions or tummy problems associated with formula  ALL natural, baby. everything your baby needs, nothing more, nothing less. its natures PERFECT food for baby and there are over 100 nutrients and compounds that cannot be reproduced in a lab.     for you:  helps with weight loss. i was 200 lbs when i delivered my son, less than 6 months later i was back to my prepregnancy weight at 110. (of course i exercised and ate healthier as well)   can help prevent certain kinds of cancers  can possibly prevent other diseases that are common among women  keep your period at bay for longer than 6 weeks! yay!  great bonding with your baby...  UNsmelly poops!!! gotta love that.   its FREEEEEE!!!  and in these economic times, every little bit of savings helps.   you don't have to make it, as soon as baby is making a fuss there is relief...no waiting for the formula to heat up and no worry of overheating/underheating.   no bottles=less dishes!!!  and believe me, paper plates are worth the money to save on dishes so anything free that will assist housework is a FRIEND.     good luck, breastfeeding is one of the easiest, cheapest and best decisions a mommy can make for their child.     **i mean no offense to formula feeding mommies. you are great mommies too, i just really do love breastfeeding. whatever choice you make it best for you and your baby. 
Zi6Fr49Laa	Yes, the theory is that certain diets will make you vaginal environment more alkaline (favoring boy sperm) or acidic (favoring girl sperm). I think this tactic isn't a straight shot and would take longer to work. A douche made of baking soda and water (for a boy) or vinegar and water (for a girl) would be more effective, however all douches have a small chance of causing infection so be aware of that possibility. You can also buy testing strips (that use saliva or urine) that can tell you if your existing pH levels are already alkaline or acidic. Combine your pH matching the desired sex with a cycle day that favors that particular sex and your chances should be pretty good. There are ovulation calendars online that can tell you what days are good for conceiving a boy or a girl if you provide them with the first day of your last period. You could also read about the Shettles method, which I think these online ovulating calendars are based on anyway when it comes to sex selection.|`|7AYnWg3paa	NO not really...besides its the guys sperm that determines sex..ure diet has nothing to do with it|`|XLsnuAqmaa	i think this is an old wives tale.  the gender depends on the male anyway....|`|jgtfWjE4aa	no. you will have a girl, if you are meant to have a girl. and you will have a boy if you're meant to have a boy :)    just be happy you've concieved...|`|5805bf3a9bb2e4808ef2d73593aaab11aa	Go with me on this. There's this thing called the Billings Ovulation Method. To make a long story short, it helps you figure out when you're ovulating based on your observation of cervical mucus. Anyhow, once you figure that out (I'll give you the website to read about it) this is the science to it. Mind you, you cannot ultimatly control what the sex will be, but you can give one or the other a better chance. Sperm is either male or female. It is a fact that male sperm swim faster but die sooner. Female sperm swim slower, but live longer. Once you know when your ovulation will occur, be with your partner the two days before ovulation. The hope is (when the egg is released during ovulation) The male sperm will die off before the egg is released, and the female sperm will survive long enough to fertilized the egg. I hope this all makes sense. Here is the website- www.woomb.org    Best of luck! :)|`|u6fXoeNVaa	well eat healthy food. Thats it.
gtggEn4oaa	Sometimes it's fun for a little kid to see their parents made. ha yeah i know it sounds messed up. so maybe when he does these things you should act maybe more disappointed??  sometimes it works.. sometimes it doesn't. it's probably worth a try though.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	A good swat on the azz would do wonders.|`|lDqn5KICaa	It's pretty obvious that if you're telling him off, you're out of control. I'll bet it is pretty funny to see you get red in the face. He knows that he's gotten you really mad, and you have lost your cool all because of a 5 year-old. Haven't you ever heard the expression, "Never let 'em see you sweat?" Not until you are able to be really, really scary without saying a word will you have him in your grasp. As a teacher and a parent, I assure you, it's possible.|`|cJLVPyAFaa	BUT, you know he really does like that toy. Persistence and consistence is the secret but remember in raising kids we must learn to pick our battles
fWAzJIEkaa	I really feel for u sweetie.. its soo frustrating for people like us who really want a baby, and it seems to take forever - and then there is people who's not even trying and dont even want a baby, who fall pregnant soo quick!  What i have done this month is really keeping count on my dates. I do this on http://www.MyMonthlyCycles.com and that has really helped with dates and any advice you need! And from your information you should be ovulating within the next few days, so keep up what you are doing.. But i really advice visiting that site!  Best wishes to you & please dont stress about it, try to enjoy it as much as possible and relax!    Lots Of Baby dust to you & Keep us informed =) xx|`|oOBg9hshaa	it takes time, me and my husband have been trying for 7 months with no luck so just wait it out but don't stress about it because that could delay it from happening|`|AA10186411	Why are you taking baby aspirin?  Anyways.  If you have sex, you can get pregnant.  But why don't you wait until this guy marries you until you get pregnant?  Trust me, things go alot smoother that way.|`|uF28jKqZaa	you should go and take a pregnancy test to make shure and try to tell him|`|LYhKeN40aa	maybe you're not taking enough baby asprin. as everyone knows, if it has the word "baby" in it it must help make a baby! amirite?!!
ZYlr9TSBaa	I'd go by your ultrasound. It's more accurate because it goes by how big your baby is, rather than just by your LMP. As for measuring ahead, I always measured ahead when I was pregnant. It either means your dates are mixed up or your baby *might* be bigger. Nothing major :) as for the weight..... i'll say your baby will weigh around the same as your first two children :)  Congrats!|`|pXSKSS3daa	It means you're measuring 2 and a half weeks further along. I was the same way in my pregnancy. You could A) have a big baby, B) be further along, or C) have your baby in a weird position. Whatever the case may be it's not a huge deal.     When was the ultrasound done? Usually, if done early on, they are pretty accurate. But it's still just a guess either way.    If your first two were around 7 and 8 lbs. I'd guess this one would be too.|`|DNygQdmVaa	3 pounds 2 ounces is normal.  id go by the date the doc gives you.    Id say your having an 8.5 pound baby.|`|9X09kM4oaa	Just go with your first ultrasounds due date- thats the most accurate.
IgEbbLcyaa	When a baby is born the mother and baby get all the attention and some men get depressed with this. There is nothing wrong with you most men get this way so don't be so hard on yourself have you tried taking to your partner about this. You should see your doctor too as men do get post natal depression my partner had it and he didn't even know until it was gone. It is like there is something blocking you and your baby but is is normal it should sort itself out but get some help as you are missing the best bits even though you don't mean too. I hope you get some good answers here good luck Daddy.|`|ReHd1IlYaa	There's something wrong ...   you should get professional help|`|xNkmK0SHaa	Professional help.    In additio to learning why you have those feelings about the baby, you may learn why you and the mother remain unmarried.|`|XBYiHaWIaa	Noooo that's awful, maybe you have post-natal depression? I dunno if men can have that though...so maybe you're just a terrible father cause noone should feel like that about their NEW BORN BABY! Next time USE A CONDOM you brought this on yourself.|`|9hggEdf1aa	Maybe you feel this way because you gained a baby but kinda lost a partner.  You should share your feelings with your partner and have a date night once a week.  It would be best for the both of you.|`|BDPc9P4Faa	Show your baby this question in 10 years.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	really get some help and now!!! my dad was a lot like i coudl tell as a kid Now he is pld and retired and wants my time Trully and honestly I cant stand him and if he calls i dont answer and never want to see him he lives 10 miles from me  His lose huh and his mistake|`|2flqUgcDaa	Maybe make an appointment with your doctor.  The first months are hard, always will be. It will get calmer though.|`|7RhXX7qfaa	men can get postnatal depression having a baby is a big upheaval and it is hard work, have you spoken to your partner about how you are feeling? maybe that will help you could sit and talk about what is bringing you down and discuss any possible solutions eg. going out together without baby now and again to feel like a human again and don't talk about baby. also I would seek help from the doctor and see if there is any thing he can suggest counciling etc.|`|h2FQVtziaa	woww..i'v heard of this..but not bein able to even look at your bby.is really sad...do u realize you are responsible for this baby's life..and future...yet... you are resenting him..u need to get professional help before you  end up ruining your family..|`|N0sKHmy2aa	I would go and talk to your doctor. And when the baby is asleep find some time to talk to your partner about all of this. She should understand
jaAolejUaa	i sure did!|`|67QVKHQ3aa	yes i had no appetite in the begining of my pregnancy, i had acctually lost 15 lbs bkuz of this...evreyone (mom) was worried but doc said its completely normal, so dont worry in a month or so you will be eating everything in sight!!!|`|TcuL9XOWaa	I had no interest in food for the first 4 mths.  But I also threw up every 15min so that could be why.

You're not alone! : )|`|5GPDrBPLaa	It can be...it just depends on the person.  I ate like a pig until I got morning sickness and was nauseated.  Then the mere thought of food made me want to hurl.  Not sure that I was ever really "not hungry" but then again my girlfriend was like this.  She lost weight due to loss of appetite and was actually thinner during pregnancy than she was before conceiving.|`|2Gve5Xigaa	yesssssssssss|`|63499b9aac8c6b496fd06a307e032485aa	YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!! i did|`|zWB3jHHPaa	nope never been preggers(=
AA11327039	With my first my pre-pregnancy weight was 95 pounds  Just before delivery I weighed 135 pounds  I didn't really get morning sickness...but craved ice water and kool aid and milk all the time.  If I didn't drink those things I got sick.    The weight takes FOREVER to take off...at least it did for me. I only lost about 15 pounds after delivery the rest took more than a year (but I got pregnant with baby number 2 and I'm dealing with losing that weight as well now)    With my first I didn't start really showing until I was around 7 months pregnant, even then people just thought I was gaining weight or just a little big.  With my second, I started showing around 4 months.    There is no place cheap to do ultrasounds.  Good Luck|`|MVaIw9fjaa	u are pregnant for the first time obviously  the first 5 month pass slowly  u don t notice the baby s moves untill 5 or 6 month   because it s your first child  u have to visit the doctor each month   to have ultra sound  and to make sure that u and the baby are o k  i don t know any clinics in your area  and it seemed to me that u are worried and maybe alone with no help  it s not your weight what u have to be worried about   it s how to prepare all the needs of the baby  the morning sickness last for 3 months   and retern inthe last 3 months in some women  the normal is to have an extra 13 kg all over the pregnancy  people don t notice the pregnancy  on u untill the 5th month  but u notice the mass in your abdomen in the 3d month when the baby go from the pelvic cavity to the abdomen  good luck|`|rUPjr7hjaa	Everyone is different as far as weight gain during pregnancy, as well as weight loss after pregnancy.  I gained 25 lbs while pregnant, and I'm already back to where I was before.  I had my baby on Jan 23.  My weight gain wasn't noticeable at all - it must have been all baby and water.  My baby was 9.4 :)  As for the insurance part of your question, I have no idea!  I live in Canada, so basic health insurance doesn't apply to me.

a3MSSvdcaa	I'm 5'4" and I was 170 last year (I'm a naturally thick girl).  This past year my PCOS really got me and I gained a ton of weight and got up to 205.  The doctor gave me Metformin to help me lose some of the weight, but it also made me ovulate (he didn't warn me about that!!!) and I got pregnant.  I'm going on 15 weeks and I'm up to 210, which I think is good because honestly, I'm an endless pit!  I'm really hoping I can get back down to that 170 fast after the baby is here!  My sister's friend is giving me a TON of baby furniture and stuff for free because her she's getting her 2 year old twins new stuff this month.  My boyfriend said since we're saving so much money on baby stuff he'll buy an eliptical machine or a treadmill to help lose the weight.  I love him!|`|3XFZHhWgaa	Well Im tiny.

My next appointment was at 19.5 weeks on 2/3 only 2 weeks after my last and I lost 5 lbs. I will say that I wasn't small to start with but so far being pregnant has been the best diet for me ever! I am not starving myself, I eat whatever I want whenever I am hungry, I just feel full faster so I'm not eating as big of a portion as I used to but I am eating more meals per day. I also know that I will pack on the pounds later in pregnancy so I'm sure I'll make up for it!|`|8am8ExsKaa	I am 12 weeks 4 days and I have gained around 8 lbs so far. To me every pound and every stretch mark is well worth it!!!|`|X3zl9hZCaa	Pre pregnancy was 154 I am now 23 weeks and at 180!!

I've actually lost 18 pounds.  Since my weight before pregnancy was roughly the weight of a baby heifer, losing weight hasn't been too difficult.  LOL    My doctor wants me to gain about 15 pounds total.  I'd have to gain a pound a week for the next 15 weeks, and I can't see that happening.      My next goal:  Lose about 70 pounds after the baby's born!  (crosses fingers)|`|Kz5Fb0mPaa	I am 17.5 weeks and have gained 9.5 lbs.!!!

It seems to keep going up and down. I am trying so hard to stay under 200 but I am thinking I still have alot to go and might not be able to do it.     BTW I keep saying it is all worth it!

I have gained 36 pounds, Just one over where I was hopeing to be and one over what I should have weighed according to my BMI!!! Darn!!!!! But he can come any day and the doc said he is probably a good 8 pounder! It's my first so I hope he is not too big.|`|4cehW3S9aa	I am 5'11" and prepregnancy I was about 132 lbs.  I am just going into 12 weeks and I am 138lbs.      I had an appt Jan 15th and another one Feb 3rd and I gained two pounds during that short time span.    I just hope I don't gain too much weight :(|`|TNHwJXo0aa	I am a chunky Monkey, my pre-pregnancy weight was 207 I am now 221 and 27 weeks pregnant.

But I am almost 32 weeks and I think I weigh about 125.  For me that is a lot.  I am normally 106 or 108.  And I have about 6 more weeks to go (will unfortunately have to have a c-section at 38 weeks).|`|256cVXsmaa	Heyy=]  I'm 5'2 and I weighed 112 b4 pregnancy.

First, I'm 5'9. I like to be around 145, but I was about 153 when I got pregnant. As of last monday (37 weeks), I'm at 195. I pray to god that I'm retaining some serious fluid at this point and I'm seriously hoping not to hit the 200 lb mark.|`|54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	My pre-pregnancy weight was 115lbs and my last appointment I weighed in at 139lbs at 33 weeks.
h57t7FAjaa	I know how she feels, it drives me nuts too!  But it's usually the people who aren't trying or have never had a problem trying that say this!    When you really want a baby, and have been trying for so long, it's hard not to think about it!!  it's always there in the back of your mind...    Lots of baby dust to your wife!|`|z6BtwSE8aa	I know exactly how she feels. I try not to stress, but I can't just stop trying and see if it happens. I have been trying way to long to leave it to chance. If I don't do everything that I feel I can do I will always feel like I'm no doing enough. I want a baby more than anything so I can't just say, oh well, it'll happen whenever.|`|eemmWU0Haa	Ya its annoying for f&&k sakes..ha-ha|`|4uqj8Nf1aa	I  keep reading that! what is ttc!!|`|373b04f6dbf649a6ef357e85b32df3e4aa	Yes very much!!!    My Doctor has told me to stop TTC for a while and I went mad! I can't possibly do that! :(     Although - in all honestly, the times I stopped TTC, I got pregnant instantly!! Weird!     Good luck to you and your wife!!! xx|`|c7f419243c5a31e1118c95c6e72ce929aa	It drives me nuts because I feel like people just don't understand how BADLY I want to have a baby. I lost a baby at 20 weeks pregnant and I suppose it makes me want it even more so after losing my first. It's mostly people who have children that tell me those things like "just stop trying" and it will happen. Well, the thing about it, normally those people weren't trying to begin with, it was always a surprise.     I drive myself crazy enough worrying about ovulation and when to have sex and whether or not spotting is implantation bleeding or really my period. Is my tummy upset because of something I ate or is it morning sickness? Things like that. Like I said, people just don't understand. If they were in your shoes, they would have a better perspective of it.|`|shKc7lZcaa	YES!!  Drives me crazy!  My mom constantly says:  "well, it may not happen for you, there's always that chance that it won't" or she'll say "stop stressing so much about it, it'll happen".   URGH!!!  I WON'T STOP STRESSING!!!!!|`|PQw92IGHaa	It drives me crazy.  When you are feeling so negative about it, it's really hard to hear that "it will happen when it suppose to happen"  It seems to magnify the problem, when in all actuality they are just trying to be positive for you in a time where you don't!!|`|yiThiSaGaa	yes that drives me nuts too...  what drives me nuts and sad is that everyone around me is pregnant, and I've been trying for over 2 years and nothing happens.   2 days ago I did a pregnancy test and came out negative and today my brother called me to say he is going to be a daddy.  I'm happy for my brother and for my friends but its a really bad feeling not being able to get pregnant.
0QYIbn1saa	My son, from birth until about 9 months, was obsessed with the soothie pacifiers.  He would refuse any other kind.  But just after this, we went to my mom's house and forgot the paci's at home and had to buy some different ones (nuks) and ever since then, he uses both.    I don't like paci's, i'm hoping to have him weaned by 18 months or so.....that gives me 2 months, yikes!  This is going to be a hard habit to break, I'm thinking.|`|veO1RXrCaa	Kept rotating them.  And when I did find one that I thought was a good one I bought a ton of them.  There was one gerber one that made him not be all gassy.  He gave it up when he was about 17 months.  Same with the bottle.  Now potty training, that was another story.  He was almost not able to start j.k bc he was still in diapers.  He got trained the summer leading into school.  He started school when he was 3 turning 4.|`|Fy9S6hjIaa	We were on a road trip to grandma's house and some how we lost the binky.  He wasn't addicted to a certain one (about 8 weeks old), so we just bought the only kind this little quick stop in the middle of nowhere had in stock.  Well, he was instantly addicted to it and wouldn't ever use a different kind of binky.  We could only find that particular kind at a little grocery store in the area.  They didn't have them at wal-mart, target, k-mart, wal-greens....no where!  I just found them at that store because my friend was a manager there and she kept them in stock for me.  He had his binky at all times.  He only sucked on it when he was falling asleep, but he carried it around with him in his hand or turned backwards between his teeth.  We got rid of the binky about a month after we weaned from the bottle.  He was about 10 months old.|`|toqMrT25aa	Gosh , my daughter is obsessed with her Avent pacifier . she used the Gerber one when she was a baby then i switched to Avent ( i like it better cause it has a cover ) At 20 months she is still using the 12 months one because Avent for some reasons doesnt make 18 month old paci ( or maybe stores here dont carry it idk) one . We are trying to break the habit though so now thank god she is only taking it at night|`|BypjotRpaa	we have always bought the MAM paci's..in the beginning they were MAM latex and that was all he would take, when he was 2 or 3 months old i accidentally grabbed the MAM silicone. he hated them, he would spit them out as soon as they went in.  when he was 7 months old i only had a silicone paci...since then that's all he will take now, MAM silicone..  i'm thinking 2 is a good age to give it up.|`|jdRKZe18aa	All my kids took & soothed themselves thankfully with pacifiers! GOD'S GIFT TO MOTHERS in my opinion!  LOL  I think having a tool that helps them SOOTH themselves is never a bad thing regardless of what dentists or orthodontists say about it harming teeth or some such nonsense.  MY kids all have great teeth and NONE suffered from using one when they were babies.     Taking it AWAY before they are TOO OLD is certainly key and before 2 years old I think is certainly SOON enough.  Past that they are just TOO OLD I think.  Taking it away COLD TURKEY is sometimes needed, but by then they SHOULD Be able to sooth themselves at night without one.  JUST don't let them walk around all day with it in their mouths and make it for only those occasions when they are going to sleep and then it is taken away any other time.  OTHERWISE they do become TOO attached and it just becomes nasty, pathetic looking and just WRONG in my opinion.|`|AA11210211	My son was attached to the Gerber round center silicone one and they actually changed the look of them from blue and red to blue and white and he refused to take the new one it started at about 1 yr,but my daughter will take any and she is 1 yr.|`|0vLU2GGGaa	They will get attached to it, but my suggestion to you is plan on a date that you will want him to stop using it, and stick to it.  I took away my daughter's cold turkey when she turns 2, she cried for 3 days but afterward she forgets about it totally.  Kids adjust fast.    My daughter only liked one type of paci, so we have a whole bunch of the same type, she will be happy with anyone of those, not any particular.|`|77b2610047fd4e5f740d75e96c9a88a2aa	Not really.  I tried to just have the same kind for each kid so that they wouldn't have a preference.  My oldest and youngest had their pacis taken away when they were about 12 months.  My middle child took longer.  She was almost 3 by the time we got rid of it.  But she was so cute.  We called her our "paci aficionado".  She would line up her pacis and then just gaze at them lovingly.    BTW, hardly any kids just grow out of their pacis.  You will have to take them all away.  If you do it cold turkey, it just takes a day or two before they're over it.  The younger you take it away, the sooner they forget about it.|`|44OH7Si6aa	My daughter had a particular "nu-nu" she liked, we just bought more of them in the same color and she could never tell the difference. It started when she was really little, a few weeks, we had two of her "type" and some others but she would only use the one brand. I kind of liked that she had her specific type because when she got a little bigger she wouldn't pick up other children's pacifiers and try to use them.  As far as him growing out of it, sometimes you just have to take it away. But it doesn't affect their teeth permanently until age 3 so 2 is a great time to make them give it up.|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	my son would never use anything except a newborn size soothies. those green rubber ones...|`|uoKXojguaa	I Never let my kids use "the plug" its a waste & there is no need for it & I Really suggest if your gona give it to your kid take em off before age one Its really bad for there teeth That are barely starting to grow & its not good for a kid to be so dependent on such a ridiculous thing!!    But My mom did baby sit a lil girl who used to throw tantrums if her Special pacifire was taken away (& she was 3)  Finally after weeks of trying they finally were able to take her off|`|dtHjJah5aa	My granddaughter only liked this one pacifier that I bought for her from Maam.  We have bought others that are the exact same, but she will not take them.  So the good news is that we won't have to break her from it later.
rqOIqO7Raa	They are awful and its a good thing you caught it when you did! Take your meds when and they way you are instructed to and it will go away in about a week. Then sex should return to normal, if not try the lube. Sometimes sex during pregnancy is completely uncomfortable and other times its the best sex ever.|`|OU9xnW86aa	It feels uncomfortable for me too. My doctor said to try using some KY or other kind of lube to keeps things moist.|`|2cstdEkIaa	I am in your same boat at 29 weeks, I went to the hospital for too many contractions and they found i had a bacterial infection. they gave me metronidazole and gave me another sono, that was it..im sure we will both be fine. infections are common in pregnancy so expect the unexpected|`|UjKmgZVeaa	I'm confused about why the doctor would tell you to wait to fill a prescription, that doesn't make any sense - are you leaving anything out?    Vaginal infections are very common during pregnancy due to your changing hormones.  Discomfort during sex also happens frequently.
rqOIqO7Raa	Yeast infection? I really have no idea,sorry! I would give your obgyn a call just to make sure everything is ok!|`|yrDqtazLaa	The plug should be odorless, you need to talk to your doctor about this, as foul odor can mean a sign of infection. Call your doctor asap.    The vomiting and upset stomach could just be a regular pregnancy thing, but make sure you tell your doctor about that as well.    Edit: No, smelly is not normal, it's very possible that you may have an infection up there somewhere, and therefore, you should get it checked out very soon so it doesn't harm you or your baby.|`|Ohsqy2xoaa	are you sure its mucus plug?  I have been losing mine over teh last week or two and no smell from it at all, you may have an infection or something going on....|`|JvsFHyw4aa	Summers Eve?|`|jNYEi0CTaa	Wow.  Im sorry, I have no idea.  I just wanted to post this to say maybe you should google it, or call your doctor.|`|JMDQr0tqaa	The mucus plug shouldn't be smelly. It could mean you have an infection. I'd call my doctor.|`|DRb4Qlypaa	A warning sign of infection is any type of odor. Nausea may be related to the infection if it exists. I recommend going to the doctor or at least calling, they will want you to come in to check you for infection. And I am sure you know this by now, as you are far enough along to lose your mucous plug, but just in case, please do not use any type of feminine cleanser like Summer's Eve. Just in case you thought it sounded like a good idea, I am sure you are not that stupid though.   Good luck!
DKvhvVsBaa	I asnwered the opther one, but here is what I said: Austin Ray I like, but I also think Austin Joseph would be cute =)  Owen Joseph would also be cute.|`|BnJRwJiEaa	I love Austin Ray!|`|iLfnhmEcaa	Austin Ray|`|HurPmgSaaa	Joseph Owen|`|1e7f68ee6a0d79eda6c821e9a33f6438aa	Joseph Owen|`|uS07WAwcaa	Joseph Owen |`|NZKiSfVOaa	austin ray  cute, for all age groups, unique|`|hCSLPz9Uaa	i like Austin Ray|`|bf6c8c12038a0925b13989b7791d0d0caa	Austin Ray|`|rUPjr7hjaa	I answered in the last one, but I'll answer again anyway :)  I like Joseph Owen :)|`|Kkxl8jchaa	Austin Ray is really cute and unique|`|FvYqKZSMaa	That's ok.I have done that before.    To answer your question I like both names.But I like Austin Ray a little bit better then joseph owen.|`|d6e11chxaa	I think Joseph Owen is nicer of the two. If I could mix and match, Owen Ray is nifty sounding.|`|yv94euDBaa	I remember this question.    Anyway.  I said Joseph Owen,  but I suggested Owen Ray.    Also, I like your name.  |`|b4J5jE7naa	Joseph Owen and about what you said on my question..  im not having a kid or do i have kids this is me and my boyfriends outlook on life we plan on getting married and want a big family.don't worry i probably would have said the same thing if i saw it on someone elses question to :)|`|GpY2SF0oaa	Austin Ray   But Austin Owen would make it perfect to me !|`|nQ7ZcUI3aa	Austin Ray
LKIhUMCgaa	don't worry bout it too much, babies tend to lay in weird positions while in the womb, so it might have looked like he'll have it, but he might not. there is no test other than u/s that can be done to tell whether he'll have clubbed feet or not for sure, and the reason why she didn't order another u/s is bc it's kind of pointless at this point, u'll have another u/s when the baby is more developed, in ur 3rd trimester, then they'll be able to tell for sure.    other than that, even if ur baby has clubbed feet, it's fixable. they'll fix it while he's a baby and he won't even know wut's going on, and when he grows up, he won't even know he had it unless u'll tell him. so don't stress out too much, ur baby boy will be perfectly fine :)|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	it is very curable ! if it is the give Shrines Hospital a call please do I was a shriners kid i had severve scolisis at 100% was told a 50% chance of death and well here i am ! fat and preggo with baby 2   it will be ok!!|`|vKvNDPbDaa	this is a common condition in babies, especially in first borns.  your baby will be fine he may need a splint or brace for his feet for a little while.  but it will correct.|`|T6nmD3X9aa	That is not something your OB should have said. Was it the tech that said it or the doctor? If it was the tech, I would not worry about it. If there is concern about this, your doctor should have scheduled another ultrasound at some point. I would call her. Tell her you are stressing out about this. Believe me, doctors get these kind of calls all the time, they are expected!!! More than likely you baby is fine. He is still developing and growing into his little body. If you have another appointment soon, take some time to discuss this with her there too. bring the pictures you have and let her go over your charts.     I still think you should call her so you can relax. TRUST ME, she will not mind one bit.|`|aba81bf0dd1e368904161a0c15faf44caa	Club foot is no big deal these days!    My son was born with very, very turned in feet.  My pediatrician told me that as he got older and started to put weight on them, that they would straighten out, and sure enough they have.    Even if they are clubbed, there are braces and all kinds of things they can do now!    Honestly, love your baby and love yourself and stop worrying :-)    Hugs to you...|`|WPI0Z47saa	You just have to realize that what ever it is it is. You still got 50% odds that it is not. The baby could just be sitting weird when they checked. They are very flexible so it may mean nothing yet. They just have to report what they saw at the time. I would just hold on to the 50% chance that the baby is fine for now instead of trying to deal with something that may not be. Just also remind yourself that if this is the case try to be thankful that it is only a foot problem (which can be helped) and not something serious that could threaten their health. Good luck sweetie.|`|NroZQN5vaa	First of all, you shouldn't worry too much because it causes undue stress for you and your baby. Also, one of my best friends had clubbed feet when she was a baby and really, you can't even tell. I've even seen her barefooted and wouldn't have known if she didn't tell me. So, don't worry too much about it.|`|0QbAiQwhaa	I think its when your babies feet are turned inward, my friend I know has it. Dont be too alarmed it may work out but if not, doctors are able to fix it immediately and they have a little scar but it adds character just be calm about it for now :)|`|Im4x06Qhaa	Well I don't want to scare you, but clubbed feet are a little bit disturbing. Go to the site I found this info at... you can always trust google.com to find the info you need.|`|75zggy81aa	i understand how scary it can be, i would let your doctor know your next visit how scared you are and ask he to give you another ultrasound to see if she can clarify what is going on. Also ask of any tests that are availible to you so that you may ease your mind and know for sure what is going on with you baby. You will love him no matter what, try to stay calm for him!|`|rjac15O0aa	Do some research.  Sounds like it might be fixable with surgery.  And get your doc to explain more in depth.  I would get a different one if he/she didn't give me any info.|`|98WKYtfwaa	I wouldn't rely on the ultrasound, my mum was told that me and my brother looked as though we'd have downs syndrome, we didn't, we're perfectly normal.    Plus, clubbed feet isn't a big deal, it can be fixed at birth with surgery. I wouldn't worry too much about it and the more you cry etc the more it'll effect your baby.

viwq8ldvaa	Lillian Taylor Brown is very pretty !!   My daughters name is Lillian :) I remember you asked me on an old account what her middle name was ... it's Eve :)  Good luck with everything !!     I also like Lillian Kate & Lillian Belle|`|oVkeP1lvaa	Lillan Kyre?|`|OHfZFR31aa	I think it's a beautiful name!|`|rdGQMSyjaa	Lillian Taylor Brown ~ I've been thinking...and the "thing" I have with the name Taylor is a personal thing. I knew a really mean girl named Taylor and I just haven't been able to get that out of my mind when I see the name. Now, all thoughts aside of this girl, I don't think Taylor is a bad name. It's still not my taste, but it's not bad. Lillian Taylor Brown flows quite nicely. It's cute. I still prefer Lillian Annabelle Brown I think though. Good luck! =)    P.S. ~ I've voted on your name list.|`|BnJRwJiEaa	Lillian Peyton Brown    Lillian Madison Brown|`|bgnHRESjaa	lillian marie or rose|`|AttXoXsTaa	Lillian Tayolr Brown...sounds great!  You might want to consider Jenna as either the forst or the middle name though.|`|IOQshyGMaa	From your list I LOVE Lillian Annabelle Brown, and the nick name you have chosen for her: Lilly-Belle. It sounds like a unique flower.     I also like Lillian Taylor, but I like the alternative name Annabelle better than Taylor.|`|VGij9p0Taa	Congrats!   Lillian meaning a lily is one of my favourite girl names it flows well with Taylor which goes so well with Lillian and your surname Brown. Lillian Taylor Brown is a great name.   A middle name suggestion which would go with Lillian and Brown is Elaina. Elaina meaning light goes really well with Lillian and Brown. Lillian Elaina Brown is really classy i feel.   I've voted on your namelist  Hope this helps.|`|th45yP4Xaa	I dont like Lillian- it sounds too.... preppy. I think Taylor is just overused. It sounds better Taylor Lillian.
ZYlr9TSBaa	You can't really see the three lines on your ultrasound pictures, your little girl isn't in the best position! The 3 lines is the labia :) congrats on your baby girl, you've got a lovely name picked out for her :)|`|ZNhP3mpUaa	3 lines generally means girl... your baby must give you a pretty good shot of her taint to see all three clearly! :) our baby pretty much gave us a full moon at 20 weeks and saw all 3 lines clear as day.. don't know what they are, but it means girl!|`|Ohsqy2xoaa	the lines need to be seen in the genital area, i wouldnt assume that 3 lines means girl either|`|Xnr5Y7Coaa	I can't tell a thing by looking at your pics hehe, sorry.  I'm having a boy and while having my ultrasound we actually got a bottom view of our baby with his legs wide open and we saw a penis :P|`|VT24zOomaa	all these pictures are of the face/profile.  if you look at a picture between the legs, girls have 3 distinct lines. and those are the girlie parts!    congrats by the way|`|FgAPXhVRaa	I honestly don't see the three line thing on your either, it looks like they were all side body shots or something... Now the ultrasound pictures of my little girl I wish that I could send you those... I would if I had them on my computer because you see three little white lines, it was crazy how clear it was! She is due in June and I had the pictures takes at 18 weeks.|`|PfLg9B6aaa	I never understood that either I am curious as well.|`|OU9xnW86aa	When the baby is showing it's goods you will either see a penis or 3 lines which represent the labias (looks like: I I I ). You can only see this when the baby has its legs apart and you get a butt shot.|`|75zggy81aa	there are three little white lines when you look at the vagina area. I looked at your pictures but they aren't clear enough for me to see anything to point out. Congrats!! Girls are the best. If you really want to see the three lines just take the "its a girl" ultrasound with you to your next appointment and your doctor can point it out!|`|7IHMjy2caa	They are talking about the genitals.     If it is a boy, generally by the time they are looking, you will be able to see the shape of the penis.    If it is a girl you will generally see 3 lines. The lines are the dividing the tissues that will become the labia and the clitoris. They are not really lines on the child's body, but the way the shadows between the labis and clitoris appear as lines.

Kenneth works well with traditional names and the new more trendy names. My self I like Braydon Kenneth and Bryan Kenneth. Thomas Kenneth also sounds nice. Since you have some time to think about the new name, I would play around with different names to see which one best suited your family. www.babynamegenie. com Is a website I have found that is very helpful.

Where the partner uses there tongue and other parts of the body to pleasantly stimulate the female.  there are many techniques but a gentle massage of the region usually leads to more than she is thinking about anyways.  its called fellatio.  Hope this is appropriate.|`|AA11840910	oral sex
ac0a2ea16ccc48e27045d2ec76114069aa	From what I know a birth and death certificate can sometimes be produced for the parents.     I think it is up to the parents whichever way they decided to go, as everyone has a different way of dealing with a loss. If it helps them with the grieving process, then by all means get the certificate! On the flip side though, it may stop them from moving on and in this case I would not recommend it.     Not that I am saying parents of a stillborn child should be looking at moving on or trying to forget their child or anything remotely close to that!     I hope I was of some help!|`|617918b90ecadbac9239fb6b950664d8aa	I think if the child is *stillborn*, that answers the question.  The baby died before or just during labor and birth.  Therefore, it wasn't alive when it was born, and thus shouldn't get a birth certificate.    I'm sure if it happened to me, I would want something like that, though.  Thankfully it never has.    I also thought about it this way:  Do miscarried babies get birth certificates?  Death occurring during labor is not so different from death occurring in the womb BEFORE labor ... so why would stillborn babies get them if miscarried babies don't?  You know, if the pregnancy had been confirmed and everything?    It just doesn't make sense logically.  Even if you believe a baby is alive the entire pregnancy and so think it was a person even if stillborn, then why don't miscarried children get certificates?  Say someone miscarried at like 9 weeks but had already had an ultrasound and everything.  She would not be given a birth certificate.|`|AA11226053	Here  in michigan they are given a birth & death certificate, but not for hope or even healing .  It is for medical insurance companies.  One of my best friends had a still born 3 years ago, her mother has the few photos the hospital took, as well as the clothes they put on the baby and blanket (I am still unsure why they dress a baby that is not alive)  and the certificates in a "safe Place" her mother also paid for the burrial... my friend has yet to visit the site.  She has since had another child, but for now it is still extremlly sensitve.|`|AA11119118	Well, I think that they should get one. I mean the child was born, why not have a birth certificate.    I don't understand the "giving them hope" part.     Was it to give them hope that the child was going to come back or something?    I know if something like that was to happen to me, I would want one.     Not for hope, for remembrance.|`|6c24bd09d5554084f9dcc2b1547b01d3aa	I think the parents should be allowed to obtain one. A still born baby had a chance of survival outside the womb had things gone differently for the parents. I as a parent could not imagine the devastation of carrying a baby almost to term only to give birth to a dead baby and leave the hospital empty handed. I think it probably helps in the healing process by acknowledging that the baby existed and they have a record of it. Furthermore, the government is so quick to call the termination of an early pregnancy murder, because they believe a fertilized egg is a life. I am not saying I agree or disagree with that stance, but if that is the case, then I don't see how they can say that a fertilized egg is a life, but a stillborn baby isn't. They can't have it both ways.
GqsLNUE8aa	I'm not even going to read the other answers because I get the feeling there are some ignorant ones.    We do exactly the same thing. (Her crib has the side rail taken off and is jammed against the wall ~ our bed is pushed up beside it. Most of the time she ends up right beside me though.) When it's the standard morning sex we go at it in bed and when it's more we head to the bathroom ~ we have an 8 year old so the living room is a scary idea heheheheh.|`|Ot8lxaMEaa	Confessions...yes while he was in the room. Sound asleep in his bassinet across the room. He was only 2 or 3 months old. Never while cosleeping though. It would have just felt too wierd. You could try putting your baby in a crib/bassinet until he first awakening and then taking him in bed with you giving you a few hours of alone time wiht your partner.|`|hXoUFWL1aa	Ok, that is disgusting. How can people have sex with their baby in the bed with them??!! I think it's just wrong.|`|f4zg7LHLaa	we haven't had sex while he was in the same bed as us, i wouldn't feel comfortable with that, but we have when he was asleep in his cot. his cot is in our room, and he is 10mos old. i don't feel comfortable having him in his own room (plus it is like a dumping ground right now!)  i don't see anything wrong with it, isn't it how he came to be in the first place? he doesn't know anything, and we wouldn't do it if he was awake. he has stirred a couple of times.... such a mood killer! :)|`|942758fd1ed500339f1a1e8db65b2d27aa	I'm with you, I don't see the big deal. We have a very big King sized bed, the few times we did do it our child was sleeping against the wall & we were on the other side of the bed. She never woke or knew anything happened. This time around the baby bed is attatched to our bed & I'm sure we'll have sex while the baby is in the room, since we live in a 2 bedroom with almost 3 kids, we wouldn't have sex otherwise.|`|f298053ebd42df4c5da5f85a6ead96d4aa	WOW you got some heated answers.    We've never had sex with her in the bed with us (queen-sized bed, not big enough), but in the same room, sure. She's asleep, what's the big deal? Usually we just go to another room, but if we have houseguests or are at someone else's house, yeah, sure we have sex with her in the same room.    Bring on the thumbs down....|`|pTG1JuDbaa	wow  we must have been real bad cuz we have done it with the kids watching tv in the same room. we were at least under covers though.|`|auNUWQo7aa	Completely inappropriate. If the parent's can't behave themselves then they shouldn't co sleep...One or the other. Pick one. You can't have your cake and eat it too.    I'm still scarred for life remembering my childhood. I stayed at a cousin's house once and they shared a bedroom with their parents who decided to go ahead and do the deed while they thought we were all sleeping...Will never EVER forget that...Disgusting.|`|DvrpBX4saa	Yeah I did. It's not like my son was awake. Perhaps the rhythmic thumping and rocking of the bed helped him go even more soundly to sleep. I remember he woke up once to grab my boob and then fell right back asleep. It was the closest thing to a threesome I've ever had.    Also, the benefits to co sleeping far outweigh the "What if my 20 month old wakes up and sees me having sex?" issue. Do you think he's going to be traumatized? It's not like Mommy and Daddy are both in leather with whips and chains. Good lordy, people.|`|jdRKZe18aa	NEVER did I ever do this.   and kids only slept in my bed when I was nursing a baby from bed and for a short time when they were toddlers and wanted to sleep with us - but I made them sleep BESIDE OUR bed in their own little sleeping bags not WITH US .  i just don't like "family beds"|`|ANHsv4ENaa	People did this for centuries. I don't see anything wrong if the baby is sound asleep and still a baby. Obviously it wouldn't really be ok in our culture if the child understood what was going on if it woke up. It's less traumatic to a baby to be in bed asleep while it's parents are having sex than be alone in a room to CRY to sleep because the parents are so selfish about their precious "us" time.|`|AA11210211	I have wondered about this too!! lol We have never had sex while one of our children was in the room even when they were in a bedside sleeper.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	we don't co-sleep as a general rule but our toddlers and infants have ended up in our bed on occasion, and our firstborn slept with us quite a bit in her first year or so.    i would never even dream of having sex with my child of any age in the room, and i can't remotely imagine why anyone would want to.  presumably even co-sleepers don't have to be in the same room as their child every minute the child is sleeping, and there are other rooms in the house.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	Never while in the bed, but a few times when he was     I'm pretty sure it hasn't twisted him too much overall.|`|VwMkiLFPaa	I personally find that disgusting. I let my son sleep in my bed, we didnt cosleep persay but he slept in my bed from time to time. But to have sex while my newborn baby is sleeping peacefully IN THAT SAME BED.thats sick!    I mean, how can you focus on sex while your baby is RIGHT there??     It may work for other people but it sure as heck wont work for me!|`|F6lZHRkVaa	That's one of the biggest reasons I'm against co-sleeping. My husband and I need our 'us' time.    Having sex with the baby right in bed with us... I can't even begin to imagine...|`|lkhCeAdJaa	I agree with the first answer.  The marriage bed should have no place for children.   My husband and I have too great of a relationship to have kids in our bed with us.  Having sex while a child is in the bed is just plain disgusting!!..............go in another room!  Good grief.  *disclaimer....a nursing newborn is exempt since he wakes up several times a night.  But then again sex ain't happening at the time the baby is so young anyway, right?            ***Max's mommy....why should it surprise you that people don't agree with having sex in the same bed a child is sleeping in?   I am surprised someone would actually be surprised at that.  But in any case~~ to each his own.|`|lzivF4Idaa	my sons father and i have had sex with our son in the bed. only while he was sleeping, and he was under 6 months though.    what do i think? if you have a big bed, your child is asleep, you can be quiet enough not to wake them, its their biological parents, and the child is young enough then there really is no harm no foul. its a natural thing. im sure i'll get thumbs down though.|`|iMULlxdgaa	technically the baby won't knwo anything..but if you continue to co-sleep iot can get wierd and/or the baby will turn into a toddler that will not want to sleep in their own bed and the mom and dad will lose their alone time which could put a strain on the relationship.|`|r39EDGhPaa	That would be horribly disrespectful to the child.  Even if they don't understand.|`|WlU3NFu6aa	Honestly we have had sex when she was sound asleep in the same room, but in her crib. I would never have sex with her sleeping in the bed. Thats just wrong|`|7rCeCVl2aa	I'm just going to admit it. We have had sex while he was sleeping in his bassinet.    I mean really... when they are that young you get so little time to be with your husband... sleeping is about it!    He is in his own room now though so it isn't an issue anymore.    I have seen a question like this before and pretty much all of the answerer's said yes... I think it just depends on the night you ask.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	when me son was tiny i had sex in the room but we get too rowdy- we just move into another room- shower couch hallway kitchecn wherever;p.. the baby doesn't know what's going on. it's not like they'll remember     yes i had sex while my son was on my bed- but fiance and i were not on the bed- we have a great imagination. people who assume all co-sleeping mother lack a  sex life obivously don't have a  good one. sex can happen all over a hosue and nto jsut lying down. but i even get creeped out ebcause our cat likes to watch us  :$ that is creppy and she'll meow at us|`|JnLoHaoAaa	I don't co-sleep but to be honest that's just a little weird. I know I couldn't do that|`|s1utniuvaa	For a while due to space constrictions My daughter had to share a room with us and unless she was at a sleep over we would have sex in the living room on a sheet on the floor lol... never while she was sleeping in the room or bed with us. That is just ewwwww...    Oh sorry I got a thumbs down cause I think it is gross to have sex while your kid is in the bed... so much for having an opinion lol...|`|B9KwqnuDaa	If they are sleeping and under the age of like one then don't think it's a big deal.|`|Ud871v3paa	lol no, I co-slept with my son until about 10 months and I never had sex with him in the bed...thats just weird to me.  I usually put him in his bouncy and turn on aladdin or in his swing or something so he doesn't see us, but never within view.|`|s30Duwdraa	Well, horny hubby would do it in front of anyone, anytime and any place and has tried on more than one occasion to get me to do it with my son in the bed.      Just not gonna happen... talk about a turn off!   Not to mention the trauma the child could suffer if he woke up!|`|prqrQcd1aa	I don't agree with co sleeping past a certain age..in fact the only time i've ever did anything like this was when i was single and was breastfeeding... i wasn't having sex!  I couldn't imagine trying to have sex with your child laying in the same bed with you.. that would be a very bad turn off to me.. and my bf as well !|`|qUH9q4Kcaa	I think co-sleeping would be fine for the first month or so. You can't have sex for at least the first 6 weeks anyway, plus it's easier on mommy if she's breastfeeding. The first month or so is the hardest on mommy's sleep, and those frequent night feedings are easier on her if the baby is right beside her.    I think that once the parents are ready to resume sex, there is no longer a need to co-sleep. I too believe that children should not interrupt the marriage bed.    If my baby were in a crib in the same room, I wouldn't mind having sex with my husband. Once the baby was old enough to sit up or stand up in his crib, then it's time to get baby his own room.|`|JP2h62qiaa	my friend did. She called me hysterical at 3 am too, because her baby managed to fall off the bed onto the concrete floor.  The baby stopped breathing for a while and then started screaming. I don't know why she didn't call 911 to Begin with...She was alright, she just had a HUGE knot on her forehead for about 2 weeks. Poor thing. I am lucky to have my Lil one go right into his crib. Then I have the freedom of any spot in the house.    I agree with maybe baby's extension..The thumbs down fairy is jealous she is too uncomfortable to do it on the kitchen counter. Lol|`|K1xNKSYxaa	I don't have children of my own but if I did, I just couldn't even begin to fathom it...  I turned the situation around in my head and wondered how I would feel if I found out my mom and dad were bumping uglies while I was next to them rocking in rhythm to their love making.  Gross and unacceptable.    I read on here just the other day, that some couples have sex to induce labor.  Really?  What's the difference between the two and why do women think it's definitely ok to do one and not the other?|`|gJrHBtp1aa	Were not big on co-sleeping, only used to do it in the mornings. when he was still young we had his crib in our room as it's much easier to breastfeed. Up until he was 5 months old we had sex in our bed with our son sleeping in his crib in the same room. I wouldn't do it in the same bed as him. To all the people that say leave the room, would you want me to go in the living room to have sex and say my 4 year old daughter woke up to go pee and becomes traumatized by the sight of her parents having sex?    I would rather a 3 or 4 month old to see me then my 4 year old. At least the 4 month old has no idea whats going on.|`|qygYwdRpaa	No Definitely NOT i would never have sex while my baby was in the same bed its just so wrong.|`|z0Ynd4zRaa	I would never have sex with my baby in the room. I just can't do it. If you want to, then that's your business. I just wouldn't be able to get past the fact that my baby was right next to me. I don't co sleep though.|`|vOomJtbsaa	I really don't think it's a huge deal.  A baby generally doesn't have any comprehension as to whats going on anyways.   I'm pretty sure I'll get a few thumbs down but oh well.... we've been intimate with the baby in the room a few times, generally if he's in bed with us we just transfer him to his bassinet and do our thing and then put him back in bed when we're finished and as long as we're relatively quiet he doesn't even wake up.  If he's wide awake we put him in his bouncer or swing & have a quickie in the other room.  Honestly, you have to find time for each other but I don't think that means not having your child in bed with you.  "The Marraige bed" isn't just for you and your hubby, I really believe that having your children in your bed is a natural and loving experience.  *Edit:  Bring on the thumbs down.... good grief people are so uptight!!  I'm not talking about filming pornos while your child watches.... I'm talking about discreetly making love to your spouse (under the covers so they don't see anything if they do wake up) while the baby is asleep.  Grow up people, big freakin deal!!|`|43a27c0e1eef30eef2164c4c15242ab3aa	We've done it, what's the big deal??? I totally agree with everything Calebs Mommy said.  It's not like the baby is taking part in anything, they're sleeping, my word people are ridiculous.|`|UghJ0XROaa	Never in the bed with us, but we don't cosleep much. We have had sex with our youngest daughter in her bassinet next to bed. She was about six weeks old. Just think about it, in 2-3 years they will be walking in on you with more comprehension than they have at that young of an age.    In the same room is one thing, eh, little unsure about same bed though.
b1cadb0a532d14b8d0c5de644fc08318aa	I was always under the impression that sleeping on the side is the natural and preferred way for a child and anybody to rest. I'm no doctor though|`|59e248de5ce06bac2a212d6ebdd8b390aa	When she turns him over to his back, gentle jostle his tummy to help him back to sleep. Make sure his room is warm and that he is wearing warmer clothing too.    PS There isn't anything wrong with a baby in the bed!! Its good for baby and parents - and less getting up for mom to check on the baby|`|AA11358359	they do have things that help them sleep on their back and from rolling over to their tummys..just keep using it intil he gets older|`|f4ffac4b7c227a3c324d4b0ade65ab22aa	I can not stress enough how dangerous it is for you 2 month old to sleep in bed with you. Try to stop that ASAP. You can get a positioner for the baby to lay in. It has two pads on either side of the baby that keep them from rolling. He might like this since it will give him a snuggling feel. I know you can buy them at Babies R Us. Also you can have your wife sleep with a blanket a few nights then give it to him. It will have her scent and it may be calming to him. Good Luck and Congrats on the new baby boy!|`|AA12230325	prob your son on his back with a little pillow.  Like Under is shoulder.  I did this for my son...because he needed to fell something under him.   However, back is best in preventing SIDS.  Remember, just put the pillow under one of his shoulders.   Try it out and let me know.|`|f2a0cc8413920ff847ead5aa33e69041aa	If you want to prop your baby in a side-sleeping position, use a rolled-up recieving blanket rather than a pillow.  The sleep positioners you can buy won't really keep a motivated baby from rolling over.  They make a baby monitor that has a mat that goes under the baby.  I think it's called angel care.  If there is no motion for a certain length of time, the monitor will sound an alarm.  I've known some people whose babies would only sleep on their stomachs, who bought the monitor because they were worried about SIDS and stomach-sleeping.

Get active, Walk in the Mall and see if that will either bring on your labor or stop your contractions.  It might just be your body getting ready for your labor.  Like Pelvic pain.

If you are worried about it and every 5 mnutes wondering, am I in labor?  then it wouldn't hurt to just go in let them check your cervix and watch your contractions for a moment.  I was having contractions for over 24 hours, none of them consistent.  They kept telling me to wait.  I went in, they told me they were sending me home.  The baby's heart rate dropped and they checked me one more time I was dilated to a 6 an hour later I was a 10 and ready to push.  My contractions never changed had they sent me home I wouldn't have gone back in and we would had a situation at home!  LOL  It's hard to be at home just wondering.  I wish we could check our own cervix just to stop ourselves from worrying.  Chances are as you get closer to real labor, you will be in pain.  Especially if this is your first baby you should have plenty of time.  You don't want to go in they keep you and you be there hours in no real pain just waiting on something to happen.  It's so tough to know.   Either way, it sounds like you're getting close.  Best of Luck!  Congratulations!

Generalmente es gentico (viene ya por default en los genes).  Si se puede producir en el cervix por tener muchas parejas o por el virus del papiloma, si mal no me recuerdo, tambin se puede producir cncer por fumar en exceso (en los pulmones) y tambin por exceso de sol o rayos UV. Si mal no estoy, son las nicas tres circunstancias que pueden generar cancer en nuestro organismo. (Habria que confirmarlo con un onclogo). El sexo oral lo que si puede darte es: un bajo porcentaje (pero existe) de contraer sida o cualquier ETS, hongos o una infeccion!

9X09kM4oaa	As long as shes gaining weight- shes doing fine. Do not worry.  And when people say she's tiny, well your baby is tiny. Everyones baby that age at 12 weeks is tiny- thats why they call them little bundles of joy.|`|AA11210211	Well considering my 1 yr old weighs about 14-16 lbs that is pretty big to me but she was 4.5 at birth so she was tiny.I wouldn't worry about it too much.|`|0wTzlG2haa	She's fine. She is eating the way she should be and wetting and dirtying diapers the way she should be. She is fine. My doctor told us to ignore percentiles (one of our twins was then and still is tiny - but perfectly healthy). He said the only time doctor's get overly concerned about percentiles is if there is no movement at all or if there is a significant jump in one direction or the other.    Ignore what people in public say to you. They don't know her history, your history, your family sizes etc etc etc. The important pieces is that she is happy, healthy and growing.|`|0bX3uZ3Baa	she sounds just fine. trust me...being in the lower percentiles isn't a bad thing. my little one is still tiny and started out very small. just make sure that she's healthy and that's all that matters.     when people would say something...i used to say...yep...she's my peanut...and move on.     congrats on your baby girl. :)|`|Fy9S6hjIaa	If your doctor says she's fine, she eats well and seems all together healthy, he probably just fine :)|`|wKYdIaZVaa	You're not alone. My daughter is 5 months old and only weighs close to 14lbs and is 24 inches long. But it all depends on how much they weighed at birth. My daughter weighed 5.13 and was 18.5 inches long. People tell me all the time.. "omg she's so tiny" it gets annoying but I just ignore them.     Point it.. if your doctor isn't worried, you shouldn't worry either! All babies grow differently!|`|vue9NOhYaa	Yes, she is small. But there's nothing wrong with being small if that's where she's meant to be.      She's about 3 1/2 pounds over her birthweight, which is just a bit above the 'minimum' expected weight gain of a pound a month.     The only thing I might suggest is offering more food. If I'm counting right, she's only eating 5 times a day, so that's only 20 ounces a day. Which is a bit less than you'd expect her to need based on her weight. (Average intake is about 2 1/2 ounces per pound... so she probably needs around 25 ounces a day ... or at least one more bottle over the course of the day.)    It's usually fine to feed babies on demand, but some babies DON'T demand as often as is good for them, so in that situation, there's no harm in offering more often.  The worst that will happen is that she won't eat.  So maybe pick her up at your bedtime for a feed, or try offering no more than 3 hours after her last daytime feed.  Or, if she's always draining her bottles, try offering 5 or 6 ounces each time. She may take more if you make it available.     But if she won't eat more and is happy .. then trust that she knows what she needs.|`|DNygQdmVaa	No shes not too little at all,  that sounds average to me!|`|5d1b02ab1bdd8a707c44ed1acdcec31daa	Piper sounds normal to me. You shouldn't worry but, you will your a mom.    God Bless you and your new daughter.|`|K3FuGAdOaa	there is nothing wrong with her weight. my baby girl was born 11/2/08 and she only weight 12lbs. she is very long but very petite. as long as she is eating well pooping/peeing like you said she is then is sounds perfect.|`|7XuzRloXaa	...Sounds normal. As long as your doctor is not worrying, then really you shouldn't either. She has gained 3 pounds since birth, so that's about a pound a month. That's good!  She is pretty tiny, but that doesn't mean she's not healthy. Really, is there a right, or wrong amount of weight that she should be at? I don't think so! I have a Piper too! She's 5 months, and she's about 18lbs. Little piggly wiggly. (:|`|NLxCpn8iaa	Not to worry!  Sounds like she's doing great.  I have a couple of small-ish kids myself, and it does get discouraging when people tell me how small they are... BUT if you are not concerned and your doctor is not concerned, and your baby seems to be healthy... well... just enjoy her!     (my 9.5 year old daughter is the size of an average 7.5 year old, and my 8 y.o. son is the size of a 6.5 year old, so I get it!)
AA12324049	Yes, I do think people make too big a deal of it!  I found out through experience that kids really potty train themselves when they are ready - all we have to do is provide them the guidance and tools to do it.  Boys in my family (including my brother and son) tend to wait until right before their 3'rd birthday and then voila! it clicks and they are done!  The girls in my family tend to be ready earlier.  After my mom told me that I trained myself at 18 months, I wasn't surprised when my daughter started showing signs she was ready at that age.  Unfortunately, I put her in the pull ups (which were new at the time) and she regressed and used them as diapers for the next few months.  My mom came for a visit and after noticing she suggested we get her some "big girl pants" with the plastic ones over it.  After 3 days, she was successfully trained!      The two things I think are most important when potty training is to use positive reinforcement and never pressure them (and don't let anyone else pressure you either!)  Good luck!|`|AA11981363	yes I fully agree with you! what is the big deal, some learn ealier some later, it's not like they will be going to school in diapers.    I think that each sign will shoe clear signs of readiness. When parents push the kids is when the problems begin, cause the child doesn't fully grasp the concept, the parents get frustrated, and the child ends have having anyways multiple accidents a week.     I have a daughter that just turned 2 and sometimes she will use the potty (only for  1) and sometimes she won't, I'm not in a rush, I will know when she's ready ;)|`|NIEt2CEZaa	Well they say its normal for some kids to have problems in that department to the age of 11. Some kids wet the bed sometimes up to that age. Im sure its different for all kids.    I feel if you start potty training just be consistent and don't just ask the kid if they have to go just be aware like after they have drank liquid about 15 or 20 mins later just say okay lets go potty and put the kid on the pot for about 4 mins and see if they go.    If they go just be like good job! wow your a big boy aren't you and just make it positive and show them that you are proud they are going potty like an adult.    If there are any accidents just say that's okay but just tell mommy next time if you feel like you have to go and just be cool about it so they are comfortable and not traumatized so that way its a learning process that isn't stressful.    I wouldn't worry too much about what the textbooks say its basically just a guideline to go by.     Some moms do stress over the age they learn and what other ppl might think but that really isn't important. What's important is that they are learning and they will succeed when they are capable.    One more tip that is difficult to be consistent with is around 2am i would always set my alarm to go get the kid out of bed and sort of hold them up and help them along to the bathroom even if the child is still half asleep just say its time to potty and put them on the pot to let them go.    This really does help them to not have problems at night about waking up when feeling the urge to pee and potty trains them completely without so many night time accidents.
fWAzJIEkaa	Hey, I found this Info...    *The herb, Vitex (chasteberry), supports good hormone balance and normal ovulation.   *The amino acid, L-arginine, helps maintain healthy uterine lining.   *Antioxidants, green tea, vitamin E, and selenium, help enhance reproductive health by repairing oxidative damage due to aging and environmental toxins.   *The ingredient folic acid assists in the reduction of neural tube defects in children, as part of a healthy diet.   *The vitamins B6 and B12, and the minerals, iron, zinc and magnesium also promote fertility health.

I think it sounds very masuline and is a bit harsh sounding for a girl.

I wouldn't name a boy Peyton because I'd be worried about him being teased too much or hating the fact that there are more girl Peytons than boy Peytons. Then again, I wouldn't name a girl Peyton because to me, it's still very much a boy's name.|`|nJtJvL7Naa	Peyton Shane.  Or Peyton Grace.  I don't like Peyton for a girl though!|`|iLfnhmEcaa	I have friends who named their kids Payton and Peyton, different sexes.     Payton Marie  Peyton Michael|`|VTwirbhUaa	peyton is referred to as more of a girls name, i have never heard if it being used for a boy. but as for a girl it would go nicely with Peyton Joy, or Peyton Sophia. but if you would like a unisex name. I would use Jayden, it works with a girl for middle names, like Jayden Annabelle, Jayden Sophia, and for a boy you could use it like Jayden Adam, or Jayden Christopher. And there are spelling variations also like Jaiden, Jaden, Jayden.|`|6CPqSXXxaa	I'm actually not a fan of Peyton, I think it sounds really feminine on a boy and I don't love it on a girl. If you're looking for unisex names, I like Rory. But, in my opinion, unisex names are just kind of lazy (no offense). Boys should have male names and girls should have girl names. No switcheroos!    But...a traditional name would be the best fit for a middle name  Peyton James  Peyton John  Petyon Michael  Petyon George  Petyon Christopher  Pick a male in your family that is really important to you and give your son that middle name    Peyton Louise  Peyton Elizabeth  Peyton Jane  Peyton Maura  Peyton Gabrielle  Peyton Anne  Again, choose a strong female figure and give your daughter her name.|`|MWrwnHM2aa	What a beautiful name!

GGH0HVdvaa	you need help. go see a psychologist.|`|dPULl5hjaa	too much drama|`|qsPyi6Mhaa	Oh honey...    I understand completely how you feel!! I too was the cute kid, then I hit my teenage years and holy crap! I turned into a monster over night. BUT just to give you some good news, I now know that I am not ugly at all. I think i am much more attractive then I was even 5 years ago. And the depressed felling I had was because of the stopping of the compliments I was receiving at a young age. I never realized until until recently. What I think helped me was changing my inner self first. I know it wounds cliche, but it helped out so much. I too planned what my funeral and death would be like. And I had some sick excitement about it. But that is never an option. Just give your self more time to get to know who you are more. Do you like art or anything like that??? Get involved in something that allows your confidence to grow, and started discovering more things about who you really are. Who gives a crap if your not prince charming!! That means nothing. And I think once you hit a certain age, you will see that this is true. If you give me your email or something, I can help you! I want to! And I am not this crazy woman online trying to kick it. I understand exactly how you feel and if I can help you out, I will okay?? So let me know!|`|VbUpMxrvaa	I can gaurantee you, that you're not hideous.   I used to have really bad skin, and I would sometimes not even go to school cause I was so embarrased.  But you know what, people really don't even care.   The only one making it hard for you, is you.  Get some confidence.  There are people who have it so much worse than you.  Do you have a deformity, ir some kind of mental disease?  If not, then go get yourself a makeover, and try to start feeling good about yourself.  & be thankful for what you do have.    p.s, just open up & be yourself, and you'll have friends in no time.    p.p.s  don't kill yourself.|`|Mh8uTZkwaa	You know your options...
yjXUE8bWaa	First of all, stay calm.     I need to know what you felt first of all. Like movement inside you like butterflies? What? It could be only gas. You might want to first of all, take a pregnancy test. They are inexpensive and pretty accurate. Second off, if you are indeed pregnant, please , please talk to a trusting adult. I know it might not sound like a good idea to you, but really think about this ok? Being as young as you are you are going to need a support team not only for your well being, but the unborn child you might be carrying. I don't know your situation or what you and your bf did, so I don't know if you had complete unprotected sex or just were fooling around. So only you know what happened exactly.      But this is the best advice that you could possibly get. Please, please if you are pregnant, don't keep it to yourself. There is people that love you in your life and will help you. Please don't worry about your parents or guardian getting mad at you, they would much rather you be honest so they can help you in your time of need. OK? You are loved, don't forget that.|`|uGNJK5zKaa	first of all learn how to spell and what do you mean by you felt something if you had sex and he came inside you then it is a possibility|`|HpCmmlMFaa	All i understood from that was that you're 13 and you don't want to be pregnant because you'll get kicked off the cheer-leading squad..?|`|DRb4Qlypaa	Ok so if you don't know what protection is then you need to stop having sex and not have it anymore until you do.

IT IS TIME TO TRADE IN YOUR POM POMS FOR SOME DIAPERS. (if you take a test and find out you are not pregnant--dont let this happen again---learn from your mistakes)|`|AA10371609	Condom = protection    God!! What were you doing having sex anyway???  You can't even spell!    The cheerleading squad is the least of your worries right now.      Typical pregnancy symptoms:    1. Missed/Late period  2. Sore breasts  3. Nausea  4. Fatigue  5. Frequent urination i.e. you pee a lot  6. A positive pregnancy test    So, until you miss your period, you won't be able to tell if you're pregnant.  Grow up and if you must be "messin arund" use your head you dip!  If you're grown up enough to have sex, you're grown up enough to face the concequences.  Start using condoms!|`|Im4x06Qhaa	Do you know what a condom is? Ever heard of them? Protected sex is when the guy puts the condom on his penis and rather than cumming (putting his sperm/mini babies) in you, it just goes into the condom. When it's unprotected, well obviously he's not wearing a condom and the sperm just goes right into u. First thing I'd do if I were you is get some money ($15) go to Walgreens and buy 2 pregnancy tests... use both of them... and if they say ure pregnant THEN you do need to go to an adult because there's no way you'll get an abortion at ure age... and abortions aren't free anyhow.    PS... I'm 17 years old and 4 months pregnant. Good luck.|`|e9m6Y4bfaa	If you are having sex, you need to use some kind of birth control (something that prevents you from getting pregnant or sexually transmitted diseases) like condoms. Is there an adult you can talk to that can help? You have to go to the doctor to find out. If you are not pregnant you should ask the doctor about birth control methods. If you are pregnant there are options to choose from.    You're very young. Sex should be the last thing on your mind.|`|wWGNvMIQaa	13??????? Wow, if you do not even know the difference between protected sex and unprotected sex, how are you even sure what sex is? Let's say this in simple terms so you do not have a little life running around. This is why our world is heading where it is heading, because kids are having kids.  First, if his penis entered your vagina with out any barrier or prevention (condom, or you being on birth control) then you can be pregnant. Even if he did not ejaculate (or "go" or squirt out, or orgasm, what ever you want to say) you can still get pregnant. This is unprotected sex. Protected would be with some sort of prevention method like those previously stated (condom/ birth control)  Second, you would not feel anything inside you like a baby if that is what you are thinking it was. You would have to miss a period (if you have it yet) and symptoms would not really arrive until you are about 6 weeks pregnant, even then you would not feel a baby move till you are about 5 months. If you did miss a period, get a home pregnancy test (where you pee on a stick) and see if it is positive. It comes with instructions, and you may have to tell your mom unless you have a way to get to a store and buy a home pregnancy test with your own money all by yourself. You could ask the school nurse, but at that age she might call your mom any way. You should tell your mom any way so she can crack the whip on you, or teach you a little about this topic so accidents don't happen and you know what you should and should not do.  But my advice stop "messin around" until you know what does what, an you get a little more schooling. Be smart, take charge and keep your cloths on, then you really can't get pregnant.|`|iEApUHyFaa	Well have you had unprotected sex with him?

NqEZ120iaa	Sounds pretty much like my son when he was 1, I had to have a drink and food with me all the time. He was just a hungry baby and at that age couldn't control himself. He never got fat though, I never forced food on him if he didn't want it and I made sure the choices he had were healthy and food was never used as bribery.     Now he is a well adjusted 3 year old, still eats more than most, but manages to eat at intervals, so it isn't constant anymore. We are also fortunate that he eats nearly anything you put in front of him, except broccolli, which he constantly remonds me.     At 1, as long he is getting healthy food, he isn't beening overfed, especially if he asks for the food.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	At one a child will only eat what they need. Unless the child has been conditioned to accept food for comfort. If that's the case someone needs parenting classes. Quick|`|AA11920812	Absolutely normal.    My youngest was like this. While my first son was not a big eater and still isn`t. My youngest is 19 months now and still a big eater. He will even eat what his older brother left on his plate...    At my mom`s house he started whining to her. And, she says whats wrong honey? And he pouted and hung his head down and pointed at his brothers plate and said are you hungry? He said, *eat* and my mom laughed and gave him his brother`s plate..which he promptly ate.|`|I97QU5Mkaa	He's more than likely going through a growth spurt.  Children usually fill out side ways by eating and eating and eating and then calm down and sprout up in length.  Fat then thin.  Fat then thin.  Between the ages of 0 and 2 a child grows in length faster than at any other time in his life.  This requires a large amount of energy, therefore a large calorie in take.  This especially applies to boys, and even more so in winter as their little bodies need even more energy to keep them warm and fuel their immune system.I think his mom allowing him to get food if and when he wants will prevent him from having issues about food later on in life.  At this age I really think a psychological link to his eating habits is highly unlikely.
AwrtwIpIaa	I find this 1 in 12 statistic difficult to believe.  Is it possible that the definition of a bi-paternal twin could mean that the woman ovulates twice, and gets pregnant twice, but not necessarily by different fathers?  I guess I have a hard time believing that 1 in 12 sets of fraternal twins have different fathers.    Nonetheless, if I were a woman and in this situation, I would look forward to my shameful day on Maury.  I would want my situation to be one where I was positive that the two babies had different fathers, and each baby would have at least two independent possibilities of potential fathers.  So I would have at least four, or possibly more men on the show with me, and two of the lucky guys would presumably learn of their fatherhood.    Anyone who defied those statistical odds would be revered by many and would be looked upon as a role model.    I respect Maury for his honorable career as a journalist.|`|83dc622a9447fc8c5ffba386894737ceaa	I think that if you are going to be Maury-worthy, you might as well do it right.     If I were to live such a colorful lifestyle, I would aim big, and hope for quadruplets with four different fathers. Or perhaps have the DNA tests show I am not even the mother. That would be blockbuster.    :)|`|xNkmK0SHaa	I would consider myself an immature, unstable slut.|`|a3MSSvdcaa	I'd be ashamed.    And Maury is horribly addicting.  I live in a very small town and a local girl was on Maury 3 times for DNA tests and even made a "Best of " episode...I keep randomly checking youtube to see if it ever makes it on there!|`|2de422e579b099a457e9236ca0a2b210aa	Sorry, but if this happened, you know everyone would think you're a s**t. No one would see you as having "beat the statistical odds."|`|rqOIqO7Raa	I think it is disgusting! That means within a 3 day period you had unprotected sex with multiple men...Think what else they pick up besides a extra baby!|`|DNygQdmVaa	I would never be in the situaton.    its sad, but i like maury.|`|dOkw3xhcaa	Wow. that would be embarrassing and not something to be proud of. "Getting around"....|`|1EwbKkKCaa	I would feel ashamed.  And maury is very addicting.|`|bTzw1JDwaa	kinda of interesting information, but I would be ashamed.
rqOIqO7Raa	Are you late? There could be a few reason why you having that taste. I had 12 negatives and knew for certain I pregnant and low and behold test 13 came out positive! Some times you just know.|`|3XFZHhWgaa	Maybe wait a few more days to a week and test again. Being tired is a sign and so is a metallic taste in the mouth. I had that in the beginning of my pregnancy and I hated it.|`|23MPcnNqaa	There are many causes of the metallic taste in your mouth.  Check out the following site:|`|LsEyhvOtaa	FFS... Why, whenever I see this question, do I feel the need to ask why have you posted it?|`|Ohsqy2xoaa	doesnt sound like a pregnancy symptom but perhaps a side effect of a drug.  have you started any new meds lately??? you should speak with a dr about that.|`|jNYEi0CTaa	Try another test.  It could have been wrong.  Not sure about the taste thing,  I haven't heard its a symptom.   But your intuition is strong.|`|4KHDjq62aa	its more than likely nothing|`|MNY5gMGBaa	If the test says negative then i would say your arent pregnant. It is reliable and tells the truth around 99.9% of the time. However if you keep feeling like this i would go to the doctor.     Hope this Helped :)|`|6yy0jtzDaa	u said it NEG! why do ask us like we can change a pregnancy test???|`|75zggy81aa	take another test, however my OB has told me that HPT are extremely accurate when taken correctly and during the right time period. Wait a little while longer and take another test, i wouldn't believe a taste in my mouth over a negative test result.
rqOIqO7Raa	I had mine start at 5 months with my third child and let me tell ya, they did not feel like braxton hicks! Everything was ok, and I never went into early labor but they are a pain in the *** to deal with. Try moving around or taking a nap. Not much you really can do for them|`|256cVXsmaa	Ehh just starting dealing with those at 19 weeks  Thought I was about ready to die about 2 nights ago lol...  I just had to lay down in my bed with my legs up and deal with it =[  There's not much else to do|`|vKEYa8aeaa	im 30 weeks and none as of yet lol. but my mother never felt any of hers either so i may just turn out like her =]|`|ZNhP3mpUaa	A class i took said it's not uncommon to feel them as EARLY (but not common) as 20 weeks... They also said they pretty much go away by doing the exact opposite of what you were doing at the time they started.. ie if your walking sit down, if your sitting down, take a walk... hope this helps! good luck!|`|mc6YtaRbaa	I've read that you can take a warm bath with nothing in it, no bubbles, salts, and it should ease them. If your water breaks though you shouldn't take a bath for risk of infection, but I'm guessing by your question you're probably not that far along yet.|`|nCKdkYSyaa	I had them at 20 weeks, the doctor said it was a little early but it was still normal the more water i drank and more walks i took they seemed to go away and get better|`|xTbailtvaa	this is my 5th pregnancy and I started braxton hicks at 15 weeks. Doctor said that is really early but I am high risk and have a history of preterm labor.  Mine aren't enough to be bothersome that I would want to take something to deal with it.  It's just kinda an annoyance. If it's bothering you lay down and rest for a bit when you have one. Some of them can be uncomfortable but nothing compared to real labor contractions.  The norm for braxton hicks is in the late 2nd trimester to 3rd trimester|`|a732cc20369212fe385773a398cdf5b8aa	i am 29 weeks and still havent had any..|`|1EwbKkKCaa	I had braxton hicks at 34 weeks and went into labor the next week.|`|TxYcs9H9aa	I've been having them since about 15 weeks and I usually just wait them out.  I asked my doctor and she said that it was nothing to worry about.  Most women don't feel them until after 20 weeks but they can be felt earlier (obviously!).  They don't last for very long and aren't painful, they're just uncomfortable.
kv8ZFPP1aa	they probably think that you are easy because you've been pregnant at a young age.|`|WlU3NFu6aa	I think it depends on how young the girl is. Society in general look down on really young mothers (I personally dont care as long as they take care of their baby but come on there is a stigma). I think guys look down on them cause its proof that they had sex. I mean there are lots of girls out there running around doing every guy, but when they get pregnant, theres no way of hiding the fact taht you have had sex|`|U4V6TkZEaa	I haven't met many guys who have children.  For some reason, most of my guy friends never got pregnant.|`|52otNiElaa	I guess it's because it makes us think that you were kinda skanky which resulted in a baby.|`|C0GeEv7kaa	Honestly, children shouldn't be conceived when the mother is young. It's still considered taboo and of course the boys will look at you differently. Just the way the world is.|`|r39EDGhPaa	In this question, is the girl still young or is she grown now?    If she's still young, what kind of teenage boy is going to want to take that kind of responsibility..especially when the kid isn't his?     And if she's grown up, I doubt anyone would care a whole lot.  And yes they would still be looking at an irresponsible person.  Having a baby doesn't make you any more responsible.|`|AnW3dzQfaa	They look at them more out of stupidity.|`|T9bCVRzVaa	Because they might think you are easy or if they are real jerks they might look at the weight difference.|`|9l3qnrUxaa	because it looks irresponsible to men who didnt knock someone up at an early age.
de02d257744cc724351d2138ed1af6c0aa	This will only answer part of your question, but "a baby's milk", as in formula, is so expensive because it's a mass-marketed, widely advertised consumer product that is in no way, shape or form necessary for feeding babies.  Formula is expensive because people think they need it, and they are willing to pay for it.  Price goes up, people think they need it, are brainwashed into buying it, price goes up again due to market demand.      Breast milk is by far the best, safest and most nutritious food source for babies.  Sadly, a lot of people think that they "can't" nurse for a variety of reasons, mainly due to inadequate support such as lactation consultants, or people in the family who have breastfed.  Also, many people are just not educated enough to know that breast milk is the best choice.    Did you know that breast milk poo doesn't have an unpleasant odour? (it has a smell enough that you know it's there, but it's more like sour milk than a poo smell)  And the pee is completely odourless!    This isn't meant to be a personal attack--I know that lots of people choose not to breastfeed for whatever reason.  This is just information--I saw a chance to educate some strangers about breastfeeding, and because I'm a breastfeeding advocate, I couldn't resist!|`|46ed2f6850d4c9650ffadabf993b7477aa	Too bad your not breastfeeding!  You wouldn't have any of these problems.  I'd just buy a can of similac till you can get to the doctors.  But if you don't have the money,  there's a couple different options on WIC for formula.  You might want to try one of the other ones if the one your giving your baby isn't agreeing with him.|`|6434173572be15e4d7e0e493bd557fb5aa	the best way is to slowly introduce the enfamil, for an 8oz bottle use 3 scoops similac and one enfamil for a week then 2 scoops sim. & 2 enf. the next week keep adding more enfamil every week until you no longer use the other kind. its easier on the baby's tummy that way because they slowly get used to the new stuff. you should do that every time you change brands.    and for all of you that say breastfeeding is better i agree, but some people just cant do it, i breast fed both of my kids when they were born. but they werent gaining enough weight and were always hungry, 20 min after i would be done with a feeding they would be hungry again, i just couldnt produce enough.|`|3ec46056a68b9d99f758b4d28ce7d823aa	It is ok to switch formula but talk to your ped first. You can buy a small bottle similac to last you until Monday then you can talk to the doc. Probably the baby needs to get used to Enfamil and he had better get used to it because I know that formula is crazy expensive. I feel you.|`|5632de3a9ae32031948ef9954704e6eeaa	If it is the enfamil giving him an upset stomach there are options with WIC. My niece had to have soy and as long as you get a doctors note WIC will give you special vouchers to use at the store. I would give him what he can handle... but maybe try doing half and half and see if that is easier for him to get used to. I don't understand the cost of infant formula either, that is why I breastfeed. But I also know that is a VERY personal choice so... no preaching here. Good luck. I hope you get this all resolved.|`|65fe686992526154bcf3fe763304567faa	When my son was three weeks old he had the same issues with the gas and such.  The bowel movements sound normal, since most babies have greenish color bowel movements for the first several months. Once the baby eats solid, they become firmer.    Anyway,  the hospital that my son was born at also used Similac w/Iron.  Three weeks later, he would scream all day and night, have terrible gas and would not have any bowel movements.  I switched formulas several times (under doctor's care) until it was determined that he had a milk allergy, which might be what your son can have.  My son ended up on Enfamil prosobee w/Lipil, which has been a miracle.    My son's Peditrican said that milk can be hard for infants to digest, so the soy is the alternative after all else has failed.  I will try to place my son on regular milk when he is two to see if he can then digest.     Good Luck.|`|9cd9383a997bf65ebbab2109e8128616aa	First time mom I take it?  My son had that nasty green poop for quite awhile after he was born.  I dont think anything is wrong but just to ease your mind you can call the ped.  Better have your mind at ease than worry all the time!|`|AA11970211	with wic you can use ur coupons at a regular store like jewels or dominck, etc but not walmart and k-mart|`|90fa3da66aec4db5007b5f2ccb28f367aa	Weird- but our WIC has Similac Advanced with Iron... that would be similar.....try asking them if they have that one.|`|c2aafc2e39622a8eb5720c1a73cc0c00aa	He sounds quite normal to me. Green poo and a stink is very normal. And believe me as he gets older it will get worse. LOL

YFPMcHCbaa	None of the people on here will be able to tell you if you're pregnant. All the symptoms you get during pregnancy can also be associated with something else.    Go to the doctor, take a test, or do some research. There are so many different places to get great information on the web.    babycenter.com  pregnancy.org  pregnancy.com  americanpregnancy.org  webmd.com/baby  pregnancy360.com  fitpregnancy.com  surebaby.com  pregnancytoday.com  pregnancy-calendars.org|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Those things don't automatically mean pregnancy. They can also mean growth spurt cause you are so young. Take a pregnancy test to assuage your fears because that's the only way to know for sure but you are probably just having a growth spurt.|`|b47fe4a0b1c7337ece7bbbffa4c65d6baa	It could be a number of things. If you have had unprotected sex in the previous two weeks then you may want to take a home pregnacy test after your missed period. If you  get your period then it probably is just a change in diet or sleep habits that have led to these things.|`|eemmWU0Haa	take a test then you'll know for sure.  Good Luck|`|kOtwimhlaa	You might want to get a test. Have you missed a cycle?|`|Im4x06Qhaa	I am also only 17 and presently I am pregnant. The first thing that told me I was pregnant was my missed period. But I was very sleepy towards the beginning. If there's no baby bump yet... then your hunger probably wouldn't relate to being pregnant. The baby doesn't need too much food in the beginning so like what others said, it could just be a growth spurt. But yeah, take a few pregnancy tests and go from there.|`|FwpIVRxTaa	i had the same problem, sorta. it turns out that i was lacking iron, but i am only 13.
145RUNQHaa	Hi!no 15 months is not too early for tantrums!it's funny you should say that my son had had some pretty long drawn out tantrums at 15 months i though it was going to be like that all the time but he has not had any major ones since so i strongly believe it is in how you handle it.this is the age of frustations time outs and punishments will not work set a good example stay calm.if your toddler sees you acting in a calm manner that teaches them plenty and it also help them maintain a feeling of security that at least one of you is in control of their emotions.try to lessen your sons daily frustrations by making him feel he has a little control over what happens.give him minor choices like which cup would he like to drink out of or what let him choose out of a choice of clothes.try to include a choice wherever you can and get him involved with whatever you are doing if he can help you with the housework it will give him a sense of importance even if he isn't actually doing the jobs right give him plenty of praise.he will be less inclined to tantrum if he feels like he has some freedom,choice and he feels helpful.toddlers do get upset over the strangest things though but they will be very real issues to him when you see him throwing a tantrum empathise with the fact your son does not enjoy them he is suffering.the best way forward with a toddler is distraction if you see a tantrum is on it's way put on a cheery voice and pick him up and point to some birds out of the window.it may take several attempts to redirect him but keep trying and this may well stop the tantrum in it's tracks but i do know that sometimes toddlers can be impossible to calm in that case sit nearby and let your little one know that a hug is waiting when he is ready then let him have his tantrum.when he seems like he is coming out of it he will either come for the hug or you can try distraction again.support him through his feelings toddlers can become overwhelmed with the strong emotions that come over them and it very much frightens them even|`|OGCSiRXMaa	Oh no my son was doing the same thing about that age if not earlier. What we do is just let him cry it out in his crib. Take everything out of his crib like blankets, toys, and pillows. It works on my son now as soon as we put him in there a min. later he will stop throwing tantrums and he is good from then on. It may seem a little harsh but they gotta learn some way and spankings don't always work.  **Hope this Helps**|`|AA10120592	Both my girls. It was as soon as i started giving them boundaries on what they could and couldn't do. He wants to do something, you won't let him, he's mad and is gonna let you know. in my opinion, its normal. Make sure he doesn't hurt himself, let him scream it out, then pick him up and redirect his attention to something else.|`|ubf26k2Oaa	My eldest son started at 12 months and i have a photo of him red-faced and screaming...it makes me laugh now when i look at it (but he is 12 yrs old now!)  I always find the best way is to deprive them of their audience when they have a tantrum...simply ignore them and carry on, if possible walk away into another room, but stay close-by to make sure they're safe.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	Oh, no, not too early at all!!!!!      My oldest started around 15-16 months.  My youngest started at "11" months.  Depending on the situation, ignoring them is your best bet.|`|zQQd2wPRaa	GET HIM MENTAL HELP|`|Fy9S6hjIaa	My son started the tantrums at about 18 months.  I found there was nothing I could do to stop.  Spanking, time outs, nothing worked so I just started picking him up and moving him to his room.  I tell him if he wants to throw a fit he can do it in his own space.  He stays in his room until he calms down a bit and then he comes out.  I don't know if this is the best way to deal with tantrums, but thats what we do.  Good luck!|`|AA11920812	No, unfortunately these start pretty early. My 19 month old does this. I find it amusing because he isn`t very coordinated yet so him getting down to the floor is hilarious to watch.    I`ve learned to just ignore it. The bigger deal you make out of it the bigger deal they make out of it...and it becomes a power struggle. If you act like you don`t care eventually they loose interest. I never acknowledged my youngest`s tantrums and he hardly does it anymore.|`|iFmKcRl0aa	I don't think any age is too young for temper tantrums, unfortunately.    Time outs seem to get things under control pretty fast for us if we can't just talk our son out of being upset. When we need to remove him from a situation, however, we send him to a chair where he sits for three to five minutes. We find that the faster we respond to a tantrum, the quicker he gets his emotions under control.     I did a quick search on temper tantrums on this web site: www.sweetsearch.com, and pulled up some information that you might find helpful.

jJLc6uG1aa	The sleepiness is part of the first and third trimesters (for me).  The second trimester gave me a little energy bump.  Have you tried the old standbys like a warm bath and a light snack?|`|MtC3CWZraa	I've had that on and off for my whole pregnancy.  There's not much you can do about it. I learned to use those hours I was awake at night to take care of housework that was getting pushed aside. I'd unload and reload the dishwasher or just generally pick up around the house.     It won't make you any less tired, but putting those sleepless hours to use made me less frustrated.|`|eU5Eth2aaa	You sound just like me!  I'm almost 14 weeks and I have been having trouble sleeping as well!    I have found a few things to do at night to help me sleep better.    - Take your prenatal vitamin right before bed. Since our digestive systems are more sluggish because of hormones, the vitamin takes longer to process.  For me, I would get a burst of energy in the evening from the vitamin I would take in the morning and then I couldn't sleep.  Now when I take them at night I end up being more energetic during the day!    - Take a warm shower right before bed and use some lavender body wash (it's supposed to help calm you down and relax you)    - Read a chapter or two in an easy reading book.  I like to read biographies, they aren't as heavy on the brain. (Like a mystery thriller would be)    Another thing to try is sipping some warm decaf tea before bed..    Hope this helps!  :)  Good luck and congrats!|`|B6Mfx5fUaa	I feel ya, sister! =)  I'll be 14 wks on Saturday and I know just what your going through, although I have no problem falling asleep, it's just the waking up all throughout the night part and I just lay there for hours until I can fall back asleep!

I started having trouble sleeping because I couldn't get quite comfortable starting about that same time.  I'd wake up sore and uncomfortable and then had a hard time getting back to sleep.

The one I have is shaped like a giant candy cane and lets me sleep with a portion behind me, between my knees/under my legs, under my head and in front of me.  I like to wrap it completely around me.  I sleep through the night without any soreness the next morning.|`|82023d32c67aacffdd25314a33b1ea50aa	Every woman is different.  Your baby is just growing and taking all of your energy.  Try taking prenatal vitamins (if you haven't been) and also B6, and peppermint tea, it helped me, but your body does have to run the course of the baby draining you.  Also, I did take Tylenol PM a few times throughout the course of my pregnancy. It will not harm your baby.|`|ZjiEQ3CGaa	Well You should not take pills so go to your local grocery store & go to the tea section and buy sleep time tea theres a teddy bear on it and then go home and get a coffee mug and fill it with water microwave it for 20 seconds then take 2 tea bags and let it soak for 2 minutes and it wont harm the baby|`|teK6BHgzaa	have this problem too i think about stuff to much and it stops me sleeping but lately iv noticed what helps me sleep is having a glass of warm milk and getting really comfy and warm in bed, snuggle into your quilt and put music on that you fluently know the words to that way your to busy singing the words in your head and cant think about all the shyt in ur life  hope this helps xxxxxxxx
rFwGnZIJaa	I have been reading this book called Parenting with Love and Logic. In there it emphasis on letting the child make decisions for themselves and think about the consequences. First of all, if your kids are crying you don't take them to McDonald's to cheer them up. You are spoiling your kids and making things worse for yourself. In this book I'm reading it gives examples on what to do if your kids act up. Lets say your daughter won't get in the car. Instead of bribing her or pleading with her you tell her she can either get in the car by herself or you will put her there your self. If she continues to not get in the car you pick her up and tell her she decided to be carried. Another example is at home if she does something bad, you say "uh-oh mommy doesn't like that. You can walk to your room or I can carry you there. " She then acts out again, you say " Looks like you decided to be carried" Carry her to her room and say " Do you want the door open or closed?" Of course she will say open but as soon as she leaves her room you say "Looks like you decided you want your door closed." And continue this to the point if you have to of locking the door (but don't leave her in there for more than 5 mins.) These are just a few examples and the book goes into more detail. I would suggest reading it.|`|jgjgd4JPaa	first get your 9 & 7year old some help there are free programs out there ask the school councilor for help and your children  need some discipline even the 3 yr watch the super nanny really and ask for help from your friends and put you children  in big brothers and sisters program they  need a good roll modal the ymca has good programs for at risk kids|`|cfkgnbCNaa	Watch Super Nanny.

From now on, no matter how they react or how they behave, tell them that they are no longer getting their way and that it is your way that everyone is going to follow.  You have to say this to them firmly and you have to mean it.  If they try to manipulate you (throwing tantrums is trying to manipulate you), ignore it.  Stop taking them into public, if you can manage it, and keep them at home.  Then, when they do misbehave (and they will because they will be testing the boundaries of your new method), either force them to go to time out (or to their rooms) or spank them.  I wouldn't ordinarily advocate spanking but if your children are seriously out of control, it may be the shock of being spanked that helps snap them out of it.      No matter what they do, remain firm about what you have said.  If you told them to go to their rooms and they left their rooms, follow through with whatever punishment you told them they would get and then do it twice as harsh as you told them.  They will eventually come to understand that you mean what you say and they will then know that when they misbehave, they are going to be punished for it.      For example, if you tell your daughter to pick up the toy she threw at you and if she does not, you're going to throw her toy away, follow through with what you say.  If she refuses to pick up her toy, pick it up yourself and throw it away in a trashcan where she can see you do it.  Then tell her that you will continue throwing her toys away if she does not pick up the rest.  If she refuses, continue picking them up and throwing them away, one by one.  Ignore her if she screams and pitches a fit.  If she stops and starts picking up her toys, then you can reward her with a "thank you for doing what I asked you to do, now help pick up the rest."  Do NOT give her back the toys from the trash bag.  They will be thrown away as punishment for her misbehavior and they will not be replaced with new toys.      The bottom line is that YOU have to say what you mean and mean what you say.  YOU have to be tough with them, firm, and you have to follow through 100% of the time.  If you tell them that you're going to do something if they do not behave and then you don't follow through with it, it shows them that they can walk all over you.    You also have to get some help.  See if there are any single parent support groups where you live, make friends with other parents of the kids your children play with, etc.  They can help you when you need to take a break.      Best of luck!  Stay FIRM!  Peace,  Jenn|`|7S47b6YGaa	I am going to firs say that no way should a seven year old be sneaking out at night... it sounds like these kids have never had any discipline, therefore it will be hard. It may be too late for your seven year old.   Your first problem is you give into her.. that is a no no in parenting  The second thing is, you can not reason with a three year old.   A three year old knows what No means but you can not reason with them. You have to give them a quick consequence when they do wrong. When my children were three, I used the quick swat on the butt a good bit just to get their attention and let them know I meant business. A spanking is sometimes the only thing that gets through to a 3 year old.   Do not do things like counting to three, they need to learn to obey you the first time and if they do not, then they need to be punished. Whatever discipline method you choose, be consistent and do not give into them. Your ok, just take a chill pill, set rules and consequences, and stick to them. Your the Mom, they are the children. When they understand that, things will go much smoother  Good Luck|`|256VZMDJaa	um if you have never spanked them there is the problem there......i say call nanny 911 to|`|japK36Pnaa	The problem is that you always give in to her! Tell her you are done with the tantrums, and it's YOUR way now because YOU are the mother. Try timeouts and take away things that she loves (T.V. time, bathtime , ect). She'll get the message and knock it off, she has to learn and you "being nice" is just spoiling her rotten- literally! Oh, and send the 7 and 9 year olds to boot amp (or omething similar) no joke, if a 7 year old is sneeking ou and a 9 year old is trying to SLIT THROATS (all caps because normal 9 year old don't even know what sliting a throat is), honestly boot camp is their only hope, and it would help to get that behavior away from your three year old. You need a serious intervention with all of your children's behavior, or (sorry but the truth) they will end up just like their dad.    EDIT: After even more carefully considering your question  would also suggest investing in plasticware and paper cups, treat them all like the just started walking and EVERTHING is dangerous, lock all silverware (especially knives) away or get rid of them, this 9 year old sounds like he may even be a danger to you. This is very serious, your 3 year old still has a chance, you really needed to be asking about the older ones. I really want to help you through this and if you need anymore advise, feel free to e-mail me anytime at wowwubzzy@live.com. This is not a joke, please, you need to save your children.|`|ZXDKEe5laa	Wow your kids are running you cuz you give them everything they want and you must never discipline them. First off if my 9 year old tried to cut someones throat I would of called the police on my own Son and scared his tail straight. You need to get control of your kids or they will be stealing from you, beating you up when they are teenagers, and trying to kill you, You need to whip that tail and show them who is boss, take there toys also be stern, firm, and stick to your guns things will change when you start punishing them.|`|7xGWh3Isaa	Hey mayby we should be pin pails i am going threw terrible threes myself and am about to commit myself i am assuming by your question it is a normal a phase but i do agree with the other parent not to give her everything she wants but i do the same thing i would rather satisfy her now then have a headache in 3 minutes. I have started enforcing time out more i sit my three year old on the couch and basically threatin her to an inch of her life that if she moves shes done for it. (I have never hit my kids but when i yell i am loud) i too am a single mom (newly single mom) i am learning just like you and have had breakdowns practically every other day for the past month but the more i have enforced time out the more she starts to  calm. My old boss told me to put her on a no surger diet none at all. So i tried it and the 1st day was hell pure hell though the second day was great she was so tired becuase she had no sugar in her that all she wanted to do was lay arround the house. though i gave in shortley after that becuase she has a 1 year old sister and if her sister gets something and she doesn't its world war three in my house. but mayby you could try that. I also read that if you tell them things like "We don't hit in this house or We don't cry like that they grasp that concept more i have tried that and it works sometimes. I do bring them to the park and she enjoys that but for what she's back to her normal self in a few minutes of returning home. so i usually only bring her if she takes a nap or lies down for about 30 minutes that way while she is at the park she has enough energy to run arround and wear of mroe energy. I hope some of this helped but i feel for you like i said same thing is happening to me there like 3 going on 19 good luck
Y72I5q0maa	Tell her I'll call later.|`|F0kjf1j8aa	first of all pretending to be someone you are not is wrong and newsflash, teenagers do have sex and the school can't do anything about that, I suggest you have a talk with your daughter about safe sex, so that you don't become a grandmother, but teenagers will do what they are going to do, be strong because there is more to come|`|5hSf85BNaa	Sneaking answers out of her?  Low....    But you SHOULD tell her you know she lost her virginity, and ground her until she is the state's age of consent.  No lie, do that.|`|S83UQ2zaaa	Confront her privately in your room and if she gives you any trouble, talk to her mom.|`|sARlFNHSaa	Well, this is really a complicated situation.  If you confront her at all, with just the facebook evidence, you loose your way of learning things about her secretly.  If you had some other evidence or just told her you know because that is your job to know things as her step mom.    If she has a good relationship with her mom, you might want to tell her mom and let her mom deal with it.  If not, if you think you will be more understanding and reasonable (attacking won't do any good in the situation) then, i would confront her privately.    If the sex is happening AT school, yes I would involve the principal, otherwise no.    This can be a devasting thing to find out as we want what is best for our daughters and step daughters.  Certainly having mulitiple sexual encounters and talking about it so openly is not good for her physically (STDs) or emotionally.  I encourage you to take some time to cool down from the shock and let yourself grieve over the loss of your step daughters virginity because it is a loss and as a step parent, you are going to feel it.    I wish you all the best in this challenging situation.  Oh yes, and pray, lots.|`|xnByjDLraa	First of all its disgusting that you would do that to your daughter, for two reasons..the first being that you are 'dating' her via facebook like a pedophile (you know people go to jail for **** like that), plus when you 'break up' with her she'll be upset and I can't understand why you would want to do that to her.     Obviously you cant tell her what you did because she'll never trust you again and she'll be embarrassed that she told you all that stuff. Maybe just confront her mother about it and tell her you suspect that she's sexually active and ask for her to have a talk with her about it.     I cannot even express in words how disgusted I am. You're pathetic.|`|5z7JH3Fyaa	First talk to her mom because you have to explain why you went on a chat site and pretended to be a boy your step daughter's age. To a cop that says child predator so you have to make sure your significant other knows the truth before someone distorts it. Then if you have to show her mom the conversations that you had with her daughter and then the two of you as parents can come up with a solution to your newfound problem. Since she has already had sex you could get her that five year birth control and take the time to educate her on STD's, pregnancy, and other dangers that could arise such as rape and prostitution. Be understanding and let her know that you both are on her side and she should have come to you before any of it took place. Then create a trust bond where she can come to the both of you with questions abouty everything else.|`|2GvMRkmEaa	You misrepresented yourself to a minor, and therefore broke the law. Also it is possible that she is lying to you just as you were lying to her over the internet.|`|a1SWQpgLaa	dude, get a life. that is just low, that is just being sneaky|`|JhYR6RCIaa	She will actually hate you for that, and most likely never speak to you again. Be really really careful, you may lose her trust completely!|`|IxGa7mnGaa	Don't tell the school principle. It's not their business to know. I think you, her mother and her should all talk about it.|`|k9VvIG3gaa	You again?    Good God, we all know your full of it!|`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	ur an idiot!|`|g3lzcUzCaa	Why would you do something like that...it is so deceptive...what did you think you would find out by doing something like that? If she ever knew what you did, she would never trust you...trust is far more important than embarrassing her over something that cannot be changed. I would definitely discontinue "your" facebook account and just focus on developing a more supportive and loving relationship with her.   "Children," aka 14 years old, often do things like that because something is missing, not being accusatory to you or your family. But, many times they engage in behavior such as that to please, to get attention, and to "feel" loved (even though they can find it at home)...it is just a reality that parents must work extra hard to provide.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	time to turn off the computer and start having real family conversations.|`|VXcp8hvHaa	Yes break up with your step daughter and tell her mom|`|fIDWcViHaa	Be very careful in reporting this to the school, they could report you to the authorities based on inappropriate discussion with a minor on the internet regardless of the fact that she is your step-child.     I believe you need to speak with your wife, and the two of you need to decide how you best want to handle this.|`|o4uIfR6Gaa	you need to tell her that it was you on facebook.    do not contact the school, there is no need for that.  teenagers have premarital sex. that's just a fact. it doesn't matter if you go to the biggest public school or the smallest private school, there is no way to stop them except for themselves.     confront her about it.  don't get mad at her, but let her know that you are worried.  make sure she took precautions and how she is now.|`|z7lPeZ5jaa	i would not tell the school ..its not their fault and it seems like kids are having sex at younger and younger ages these days so they cant really do anything about it. Instead of confronting her since you are the step parent i would tell her mom and talk about it with her and see how all the parents will handle it because i mean everyone needs to be on the same page with what is going on and that way the mom knows whats going on too.|`|Gqs6H0Z0aa	Sounds like you got what you wanted...you were snooping. First of all, there is no need to involve the school principal. I am sure she knows there are teenagers having sex, it is going on everywhere, every day...unless of course they are actually doing it at school. Then maybe you should address it. Anyway, you need to talk to her mom/dad and see how they want to handle it. You went about it all wrong, and totally betrayed any trust she may have had in you.|`|7w5Mhaegaa	Well you practically are the mom and you should probably tell her real mom and confront her that you no. Don't tell her how you no though cuz she might get mad and say your invading her privacy. But the good thing is that she isn't pregnant.Also find out who it was that she had sex with and tell her father to have a talk with him. Most importantly that she had sex at the age of 13yrs old.|`|DRb4Qlypaa	Do you realize that impersonating a minor over the internet is illegal and you could also be charged as a sex offender with there being sexual conversations between the two of you?   Just thought I would throw that out there.    I think you should mind your own business, unless if you are in a position to tell her mom privately that you have reason to believe that it might be time to have a talk with her. That is all you should feel obligated to do, and anything else would probably be way overstepping the line given your odd parenting technique and need to impersonate a minor, which like I said, is illegal.
C4AUC5vGaa	You went at the same time each day. Perhaps the man has the same schedule. Try to mix up your schedule amd go at different times and see if the man is really following you. Document it. Take pictures, make notes, etc. Then, when you go to police you sort of have evidence so you don't sound too crazy.|`|z7lPeZ5jaa	yeah ..but could you not see what he looked like or who he was i mean he was sitting in a chair right next to your daughter you should have said something|`|p6rbmkehaa	You have no evidence he is stalking you but if you seriously feel in danger do something. Try going to a lot of places and see how often he is there. It could be a coincidence. If he shows up to a majority of places you go on a daily basis call the police or go there. Try to get his profile to so they can be aware.|`|HXZDVROLaa	why dont you say ..."hello"   Do you really feel youre so significant ..people are stalking you? Really pfft|`|zK2kPbL7aa	Umm let me think YES! Your 7 year old might be in danger.|`|AA10296028	do you see him at other places?    try going to diffrent places and pay attention to see if you are being followed.    if you are then report it.
SnQvsOPwaa	I try to reason with her and I give her everything she wants   That's the cause of all the behavior right there. Who's the parent? Who's in charge? Tell her whats going to happen and tell her what to do and then do it. You don't need to scream, yell, hit, or go crazy. Just do what you said and make her do what you tell her.|`|HXZDVROLaa	youre severely screwed up and shouldnt have children|`|OIDfYzASaa	take it away|`|ZAlXIyQeaa	With the 3-year old, give her time-outs that are long and take a toy away every time she throws it.     With the 7 year old, lock her window?    With the 9 year old, sounds like this is the best behaved one, but explain to him how to be careful with things like scissors.    In general, don't give them everything they want. Now they've learned that by throwing tantrums they'll get what they want so that's why they do it. Also a good idea would be to enroll them in a variety of activities (swim class, martial arts, etc) to occupy them. If you don't have a lot of money, there are church/other religious and non-religious organizations that have youth groups for free.|`|qR3vlQ3Paa	ok I'm not a mom but i have a sister like that. ok so like i usually get down to her/his size look them in the eyes sound serious and say knock it off put them in the corner for 3 min and if they don't listen sorry you might have to spank them and put them in the corner again. if you have more questions about this tell me. P.S. I'm becoming a baby sitter in the summer and I'm strict. if you search my name up on google i think you could find me.|`|zK2kPbL7aa	Stop spoiling her you are only making it worse by giving her what she wants. Maybe spank her and tell her that you will be taking all the spoiledness away and she wont be getting anything she wants anymore. If she says that you hit here tell them that you have spanked her once and that would be the last time ever.
AA11597332	I think you should be straight up with her and tell her exactly what you just said. That you love her, feel terrible that she has had such a hard time and don't want to say something insensitive to her and hurt her any more than she already is. If she says that would be very difficult for her to hear about then just be very quiet about things. However she may want to know how you are doing and try to help you, and you can add that too, that you would like her help, psychological support since she is so close to you.  Even with that said though, I wouldn't talk about it all the time, no matter if she says she can handle it...that could be too much. Gradually she may be able to handle more and more but as the baby comes she may be even more resentful and back away. You're going to have to play it by feel. And you may consider making her a Godmother.   You sound like a dear friend, just hope she can have one of her own someday, my wife had hers at 39. Maybe there will be a miracle of some kind and her body will let her have one someday.  Best Wishes:)|`|AA11485975	This isn't a man made thing, remember? If it's meant to happen, it will. It isn't all THAT automatic.|`|AA12362851	I will probably not tell her about my plans, and let her know when I am already pregnant. I know its something girls want to share with one another but in her case is something that makes her really sad, so you have to respect that.|`|AA12342501	Don't talk to her about it!  Simply because most likely you will get pregnant, and in the process she'll be thinking that same exact thing!  It will only make her feel worst!  Anyway, take joy in the hopes of a pregnancy!  When u finally do get pregnant tell her with a big smile, but don't rub it in!  Just be gentle.  Say to her, "I know you have been trying, and me telling you this probably makes you fell upset, but I wanted to tell you so we can share in the hopes that one day you too will conceive."  Ok that's a little too scripted, but you get the point.  When the time comes be compassionate, but in the mean time stay quiet about your trying to get pregnant!   Good Luck!|`|0844443c1ec589c2e4899fd625041668aa	Don't talk with her about your fears, excitement, emotions, etc.  Don't you have another friend whom you can confide in?  Obviously when you do get pregnant, this friend will notice.  If she doesn't bring it up, don't mention it...just pretend you're not pregnant.  If she resents you for being pregnant, then she's not a good friend.  It's not your fault she's infertile.|`|c73c7fb41cb2baee3e822fa514b20bd7aa	If she is really your friend, then she will be happy for you and want to be apart of it she won't be mad at you.|`|AA12089586	I would suggest not talking to her about it!  If you are a good friend, and you know it hurts her feelings, try and avoid it!  If you do get pregnant, she may wish you congrats and all that stuff, but i wouldn't talk about anything baby unless she brings it up!  Yes it may be hard but you need to keep her feelings in mind!  Think of this in the reverse!  If you were your friend who cannot have kids and it brings you to tears everytime you talk about it?  Would you want to talk about it?  Plus there are plenty of people you can talk to, other friends, family?!  I would try and avoid it to not hurt her feelings!|`|c8ee2e0f99778772c90040e4b8dccd19aa	Well all I can say is, I'm sorry.|`|6c6c067156681b0642144cdf4fc56771aa	Unfortunately, until you do get pregnant you should just try to stay away from the subject when you are around her. I'm sure you have other friends to talk to who will be able to get excited with you. This doesn't mean you can't talk to her at all - just don't bring up pregnancy.    When you DO get pregnant you should wait for her to bring it up. When she's asking you about your pregnancy it will be a sign that she is ready to talk about it  with you.    That is the best advice I can give. I hope it helps! :)|`|6791c7619353f60d90fd37113dd2990aaa	It's hard for some people to accept cuz of their "problem" she should be happy for you.I have a 9 year old and I'm 28,been married for 6 years and haven't gotten pregent and it is very hard.|`|3d87f30465d04209a16f7c29815f4c0baa	simple DON'T.     I'm serious. if you know this is hard for your friend then avoid this topic at all cost. talk to your other friends about this if you must. I wouldn't bring baby pictures to a friend that had a misscarriage.     and when you do get pregnant she'll deal. she has to see the pregnant people on tv and at work. next time she brings up the topic. you might mention that your trying to have a baby too.|`|608825b15a0e154019fce4906121ff31aa	I would wait until you ARE pregnant to tell her...like around the time you tell your boss.  Then go into details when she asks about it.|`|AA10586201	well I personally would tell her how I feel, now if shes your friend she will understand, that does not mean that she wont get upset or be disappointed but if shes a true friend she will be happy for you.Oh I forgot to say that is in the event that you do come up pregnant. But it depends on how long its been since she's tried it might be a little too much for her. I had (2) best friends that couldn't get pregnant I tried not to gloat about it but just keep them informed on what was going on besides they were about to be god parents. What I'm saying is keep her informed and be sensitive at the same time. But in the initial conversation she may have mixed feelings. But if she's a friend be sensitive to her needs as well. I hope this helps : )

If it's kind of clumpy like cottage cheese and/or have a smell to it that could mean that you have a vaginal yeast infection. yeast infections are normal. most women develop a yeast infection for many of reasons. so if  clumpy or has a smell to it then get seen by a doctor. also if it turns yellow-ish go to a doctor.|`|33170f0a7ecde00f244b4470b1e1b204aa	IT IS A VAGINAL DISCHARGE  Normal vaginal discharge has several purposes: cleaning and moistening the vagina and helping to prevent and fight infections. Although it's normal for the color, texture, and amount of vaginal fluids to vary throughout a girl's menstrual cycle, some changes in discharge may indicate a problem.    If you think you may have a problem, you should see a doctor as soon as possible. First, though, it helps to learn some of the differences between normal and abnormal vaginal discharge. This will help you to recognize changes that may occur.    Normal vaginal fluids can vary somewhat in texture and color. They can be somewhat thin, sticky, and elastic or thick and gooey. Vaginal fluids should be clear, white, or off-white in color.    It's important to keep an eye out for changes in vaginal fluids. The following changes may indicate a problem:        * change in odor (especially an unpleasant odor)      * change in color or texture (especially greenish, grayish, or anything looking like pus)      * vaginal itching, burning, swelling, or redness      * change in color that is caused by vaginal bleeding or spotting that is not a menstrual period    Vaginal infections, such as bacterial vaginosis, candidiasis (yeast infection), and trichomoniasis are common causes of abnormal vaginal discharge. Some infections are transmitted by having sex, such as gonorrhea. Other infections can occur with or without having sex, such as bacterial vaginosis or yeast infection.     Although the symptoms of these infections can be very similar, there are some differences to look for:        * Yeast infections may cause your discharge to become very white and thick, resembling cottage cheese. A yeast infection usually does not cause a strong odor, but it may cause severe itching and burning.      * Bacterial vaginosis (BV) may cause your discharge to be heavier than usual. The fluids may become foamy or frothy and grayish in color. BV often causes vaginal fluids to have an unpleasant, fishy odor.      * Trichomoniasis, a common sexually transmitted disease (STD), may cause a musty, stale odor. Discharge may become grayish or yellow-green and may become thicker. Trichomoniasis also often causes vaginal itching and pain during urination.    It's very important to see a doctor or go to a teen clinic if you have any of the symptoms of abnormal vaginal discharge. This is really important for girls who have had sex, especially those who have had sex without using a condom. Many STDs cause changes in vaginal discharge or cause other infections that affect discharge as well.|`|0ece33e597ee68008a36eeda3a76a672aa	my best friend had this problem...

In other words, you are being a lady!  You so far are smarter than the average teen out there. My advice is this: you kiss him when and only when you are ready and feel comfortable doing so. Don't rush things. If he pressures you into doing something that you don't want to do and you give in, you will feel terrible! If he really likes you then he will understand that you need more time before you are ready and he will stay with you. If he does not respect you, then he will leave and you don't need him anyway! You are your own person and are responsible for your actions. Always respect yourself. You are off to a great start!

AA12381247	http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/symptom...  http://www.4woman.gov/pregnancy/index.cf...    Best site ever for pregnancy!     Early signs and symptoms of pregnancy: Things you might notice before you start prenatal care  Could you be pregnant? Before you test, read this list of classic clues.   Are you pregnant? The proof is really in the pregnancy test. But you may suspect  or hope  that you're expecting, even before you miss a period, if you experience one or more of the following signs and symptoms of pregnancy. These early clues may begin in the first few weeks after conception.  Tender, swollen breasts or nipples  One of the first physical changes of pregnancy is a change in the way your breasts feel. They may feel tender, tingly or sore. Or they may feel fuller and heavier. As early as two weeks after conception, your breasts start to grow and change in preparation for producing milk. The primary cause of these changes is increased production of the hormones estrogen and progesterone. Changes in your breasts are often most dramatic when you're pregnant for the first time.  Fatigue  Many women feel wiped out during pregnancy, especially in the early stages. This may be nature's way of persuading moms-to-be to take extra naps, in preparation for the sleepless nights ahead. But there's also a physical reason for fatigue.  During the early weeks of pregnancy, your body is working hard  pumping out hormones and producing more blood to carry nutrients to your baby. To accommodate this increased blood flow, your heart pumps harder and faster. Plus, progesterone is a natural central nervous system depressant, so high levels of this hormone may make you sleepy. In addition, the possibility of pregnancy can bring about a range of feelings and concerns that may sap your energy and disturb sleep.  Slight bleeding or cramping  Some women experience a small amount of spotting or bleeding very early in pregnancy, about 10 to 14 days after fertilization. Known as implantation bleeding, it happens when the fertilized egg first attaches to the lining of the uterus. This type of bleeding is usually a bit earlier, spottier and lighter in color than a usual period and doesn't last long.  Many women also experience cramping very early in pregnancy as the uterus begins to enlarge. These cramps are similar to menstrual cramps.  Nausea with or without vomiting  Morning sickness is one of the telltale signs of early pregnancy. Most women feel some sickness around four to eight weeks of pregnancy, but the queasiness can begin as early as two weeks after conception.  Although nausea and vomiting during pregnancy is commonly called morning sickness, it can occur at any time of the day. It seems to stem from the rapidly rising levels of estrogen produced by the placenta and the fetus. These hormones cause the stomach to empty somewhat more slowly, which could be part of the problem. Pregnant women also have a heightened sense of smell, so a variety of odors  such as foods cooking, coffee, perfume or cigarette smoke  can trigger nausea.  Food aversions or cravings  Turning up your nose at certain foods is often the first hint that you're pregnant. Even the smell of some foods may cause a wave of nausea in early pregnancy. One study suggests that pregnant women experience a unique aversion to coffee in the early weeks of pregnancy. Meat, dairy products and spicy foods are other common objects of repulsion.  Food cravings are common, too. Like most other symptoms of pregnancy, these food preferences can be chalked up to hormonal changes. Pregnant women typically find that their food tastes change somewhat, especially in the first trimester, when hormones have the strongest impact.  Frequent urination  Many pregnant women find themselves running to the bathroom more often than usual. During the first trimester of pregnancy, this is caused by the enlarging uterus pushing on your bladder.  Headaches  If you're pregnant, you may be troubled by frequent, mild headaches. Early in pregnancy, headaches may be the result of increased blood circulation caused by hormonal changes.  Constipation  Constipation is another common early indication of pregnancy. An increase in progesterone causes digestion to slow down, so food passes more slowly through the gastrointestinal tract, which can lead to constipation.  Mood swings  You're a no-nonsense kind of woman  so what's with this crying over Hallmark commercials? The flood of hormones in your body in early pregnancy can make you unusually emotional and weepy. Swings in your mood, from bliss to deep gloom, also are common, especially in the first trimester.  Faintness and dizziness  It's common for pregnant women to be lightheaded or dizzy. These sensations usually result from circulatory changes as your blood vessels dilate and your blood pressure drops. Early in pregnancy, faint feelings may also be triggered by low blood sugar.  Raised basal body temperature  Your basal body temperature (BBT) is your oral temperature when you first wake up in the morning. This temperature spikes slightly soon after ovulation and remains at that level until your next period. If you've been charting your BBT to determine when you ovulate, its continued elevation for more than two weeks may mean you're pregnant. In fact, BBT stays elevated throughout your pregnancy.  Are you really pregnant?  Unfortunately, these signs and symptoms aren't unique to pregnancy. Some can indicate that you're getting sick or that your period is about to start. And, conversely, you can be pregnant without ever experiencing these symptoms.  Still, if you notice any of the tip-offs on this list, make plans |`|906a6ae6f41dff1d6d4759c7c004ce4aaa	Not always.....  Get a pregnancy test and find out for sure...    Same thing happened to me..

At mid-cycle, when the egg is ready, the ovary releases the egg. This stage is called ovulation, and is the optimum time for fertilization to take place. The egg enters the Fallopian tube on its way to the uterus. In the last phase of the menstrual cycle, one of two things happens: If the egg is fertilized, it continues on to the uterus, attaches to the lining and pregnancy begins; if the egg is not fertilized, the uterus sheds its lining (and the now-dead egg), menses begins and another menstrual cycle ensues.     Menses (approx. Day 0 to 5)  Typically, the menstrual cycle begins with the onset of menses, bleeding and loss of the tissue lining of the uterus, which lasts from 5 to 7 days (variable among women). During menses:   The levels of estrogen and progesterone in the blood from the previous cycle begin to drop to their lowest levels.   Small episodic pulses of GnRH from the hypothalamus lead to small pulses of LH and FSH from the pituitary. LH and FSH stimulate several follicles (each containing an egg cell) to develop in the ovaries.   The follicles secrete estrogen. The follicle that develops first (dominant follicle) secretes greater amounts of estrogen than the others, and this hormones suppresses the development of the other follicles. The dominant follicle develops outer layers of cells, called granulosa cells, and a fluid-filled space called the antrum. It also continues to secrete estrogen.     Follicular Phase: Part I (approx. Day 6 to 10)   The primary follicle continues to develop and grow larger. The antrum gets bigger, and pressure develops inside the follicle. The follicle secretes estrogen at a faster rate.   Estrogen levels in the blood rise. The rising estrogen levels will eventually signal the brain that the egg is ready to be released.   The rising estrogen levels stimulate growth in the tissue and blood vessels that line the uterus. The uterus lining gets thicker in preparation to receive a fertilized egg.   LH and FSH levels remain low but steady, supporting the development of the follicle.     Follicular Phase: Part II (approx. Day 11 to 14 )   The primary follicle continues to develop, grow larger and is about ready to be released. The antrum grows, and pressure is near its highest level inside the follicle. The follicle continues to secrete estrogen at a faster rate.   Estrogen levels are at their highest, signaling that the egg is ready to be released.   LH and FSH levels remain low but steady, supporting the development of the follicle.   The uterine lining continues to grow in response to stimulation by estrogen. The mucus plug in the cervix becomes thin and watery.     Ovulation (approx. Day 15)  The high estrogen levels have signaled the brain that it is time to ovulate.   The hypothalamus secretes massive amounts of GnRH, stimulating the anterior pituitary to secrete massive amounts of LH and FSH (mid-cycle LH/FSH peak). This surge lasts only 24 hours.   The LH and FSH stimulate enzymes in the follicle. The enzymatic reactions, along with the pressure of the antrum, release the egg from the follicle. The egg travels into the Fallopian tube, where fertilization can take place. The egg can survive for about 12 to 24 hours after ovulation. The remainder of the follicle, the corpus luteum, stays in the ovary. The corpus luteum secretes estrogen and progesterone.   The lining of the uterus approaches its thickest and is ready to receive a fertilized egg.   The cervical mucus is at its thinnest.   This is the optimum time for fertilization to occur.     Luteal Phase (approx. Day 16 to 28)  The corpus luteum degenerates.   The egg gets swept along by gradual wave-like motions of the finger-like projections in the walls of the Fallopian tube.   LH and FSH levels fall back to their low, steady levels.   Estrogen levels fall somewhat after the LH/FSH surge, but rebound due to continued secretion of estrogen and progesterone by the corpus luteum.   The uterine lining remains thick and ready to host a fertilized egg or growing embryo.   The corpus luteum shrinks and begins to die. It is programmed to die in 14 days unless it receives stimulation from human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a hormone secreted from a growing embryo.   If fertilization occurs, and the embryo implants in the lining of the uterus, hCG rescues the corpus luteum and it continues to secrete estrogen and progesterone throughout the pregnancy.   If fertilization does not occur, the corpus luteum dies at the end of the luteal phase. The unfertilized egg also dies and passes out of the uterus when menses begins. Estrogen and progesterone levels fall, menses starts and the uterine lining is shed. A new cycle begins.
AA10982962	u are pregnant for 40 weeks (including the time of ur last period until conception) on average, which is 9 months and 1 week.    there are 4.4 weeks in a months (not 4, otherwise there would be 48 weeks in a year, not 52. there are more than 28 days in a month, except Feb).    the average pregnancy is not 10 months (44 weeks), however, u can be pregnant for more than the 40 weeks, meaning the baby is late. i doubt a doctor would let the pregnancy go on that long since the baby grows rapidly at the end of the pregnancy and might get too big too be delivered naturally.    from ur dates, it seems ur sister was pregnant for 40 weeks only.    to work out when she conceived, u need to know the length of her cycle. if she has a normal 28 day cycle, she would have ovulated around 5 jan 06, and probably fell preg between 2 jan and 6 jan. if her cycle is longer or shorter than 28 days then her ovulation (and conception) dates would be that many days later or earlier.     (u ovulate 14 days BEFORE ur next period is due. if u hav sex b4 ovulation u can still fall pregnant since the sperm can stay alive inside the woman for up to 5 days. the woman ovulates for 24 hrs approx)     if the dates still dont help ur sister, then maybe u shud find out the blood types of ur sis, baby and men involves. find out if there either could have been the father. even a 25% chance means that that guy cud be the dad, but if the possibility of 1 guy is eliminated then u know that the other is dad and sis wont have to get a dna test done.|`|AA11588427	I heard it was about 40 weeks.|`|edfa6dbff508a9aa879611b5420c8422aa	A normal pregnancy goes from 38 to 42 weeks.

The only way to determine paternity is dna, but counting back 40 weeks from her delivery day may give her a good window of when she conceived.|`|38d894c80c6c49cdc507dde1b5848396aa	40 weeks.  36-37 weeks is considered full term.  A quick calculator for a due date is date of last period + 9 months and one week to get a due date.

Her ovulation would be roughly two weeks after the period. That really confused me and my husband at first too.  Also, I got pregnant on January 11, 2005 (it was the only time I had sex in about a 5 month period so I know it's dead on lol) and my daughter was born Sept. 27, 2005.  She she was pretty much on the same frame.  I would say the guy she had sex with on 01-08-2006 is the lucky one!  Good Luck!|`|7d431b8434a547c409d69d5cdc73d539aa	9 MONTHS!!!!! thats how long.. wow!!|`|7e38971602aa7920055efbe2403d7d32aa	40 weeks, so if you say each month has 4 weeks, then yes that is 10 months. However, some months have more than 4 weeks in them. There is really no way to pinpoint the conception date, that is why pregnancy due dates are guesstimated, about 40 weeks after the first day of your last period. If she went to the doc regularly, then they should have been able to tell how far along she was by the baby's measurements on the ultrasound. Did she deliver on or close to her due date? Or was she late or early? These may factor in on finding the father. Also, if that was the last time she had sex, when was the time before that? If it was within a week, there is no way to tell just by the dates, she will have to get a DNA test. By the dates that you gave she would have been about 38 weeks pregnant. If she got pregnant from the last time that she had sex, than she would have been two weeks early, but they would not have stopped her labor, because the baby's lungs would have been fully developed. If she had sex two weeks before, then it is possible that the man she had sex with then could be the father.  I hope this helps. As for everyone else saying she shouldn't sleep around, I'm sure she knows that now! It's not like you have never made a mistake in your life!|`|AA11096432	Yes, pregnancy lasts 40 weeks or ten months|`|32a259f59d3088d2227a70c4bed9c8e6aa	pregnancy usually lasts 40 weeks...and they start counting from the first day of your last period...|`|2b44afc48ee95f1131d1061673758b07aa	So when you are pregnant you are full term for 40 weeks. SO that means you are pregnant for 10 months! BUT a normal pregnancy is only 36 weeks. So it would be who she had sex with on the 01 08 06 because that is the full 40 weeks because the doc told her her due date would be the 9 29 06. So therefore if she had sex before that, the baby would be like 11 or 12 months old. Hope I helped! lol|`|053b7920ee98338e4b91aacb4e5aa966aa	40 weeks or 10 months is a full term pregnancy. Count backwards from when she had the baby and give a 2 week bending way for each way because babies usually come 2 weeks earlier or late.  If she had sex on the 8th of January it would really just depend on the date of who she slept with before that person.

Until it finally dissolved, I did my best not to sit for long periods.    If your stitches are hanging on this long, it's probably because you had some type of difficulty during birth. Maybe you had an episiotomy, a large baby or a rather deep tear. In that case, it's quite normal for stitches to hang on for up to 6 weeks.    Until they dissolve, the best you can do is to soak the area (in the bathtub or a Sitz bath) as often as you can. Do your Kegel exercises to help the perineum area heal faster.     Also, avoid activities that put pressure on your stitches. Unfortunately, it looks like that includes jogging. Maybe you can take brisk walks in the meantime?    If your stitches are still hanging around after 6 weeks, call your OB/GYN and make an appointment to have them removed.|`|5cec10544948ff705e3bb74af4a663daaa	YES, THEY ARE DISSOLVING, THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS, EASIER THAN HAVING THE DOCTOR TAKE THEM OUT, SHE SHOULD HAVE EXPLAINED THAT TO YOU...DON'T WORRY.|`|782ed88860ff1ccfc6a0624951d21d20aa	Mine took 4-5 weeks to come out!

In dieser Zeit sind Sie psychisch und emotional besonders gefordert. Im Yoga lernen sie Ihren K?rper mit dem wachsenden Kind kennen und entwickeln dadurch ein positives K?rperbewusstsein. Sie erleben dadurch die Schwangerschaft und die Geburt bewusster und aktiver.  Mit Yoga beugen Sie typischen Haltungsfehlern vor und k?nnen Schwangerschaftsbeschwerden lindern. Yoga hilft Ihnen Ihr Selbstvertrauen zu st?rken und dadurch die Angst vor Neuem und Ver?nderung zu berwinden.    Ziele:  v     Steigerung des k?rperlichen Wohlbefindens    v     L?sen von Verspannungen    v     St?rkung der inneren Stabilit?t    v     Aufmerksamkeit nach innen richten    v     Einklang von K?rper, Geist und Seele herstellen    Aufbau der Stunde:    v     Atmungen    v     Hatha - Yoga (K?rperbewegungen und -haltungen)    v     Pranayama (Kraft durch bewusste Atmung)    v     Entspannung|`|0d88392b05082c1b02e7429ab0e0672faa	Bitte nicht auf jedes Gramm achten !!

Auch mal einfach nur einen Teller Rohkost (Gemse) statt Pommes mit Bratwurst.     Natrlich MUSST Du in der Schwangerschaft zunehmen!!!  zwar nicht direkt fr 2 essen, wie viele immer so sch?n sagen, denn ein Baby ist kein erwachsener Mensch und braucht also auch nicht soviele Kalorien, wie ein Erwachsener. Sehr wichtig ist aber, das Du genug ntzliche N?hrstoffe und Mineralien, zu Dir nimmst wie   z.B. Eisen, Fols?ure (ganz wichtig), Calzium, Magnesium,  Vitamine (alle).  Fols?ure ist viel in Salat, Tomaten, Orangen, Avocados und Honigsmaks (Kellock's) enthalten. Dabei nur beachten, je mehr Du etwas kochst, desto weniger werden Die N?hrstoffe in der Nahrung.  Mit Dieser Art nimmst Du zwar zu, weil n?tig, aber Du ern?hrst Dich und Dein Kind dabei gesund. Und das ist doch das Wichtigste!!!  Nach der Schwangerschaft kannst Du dann mit Sport und wiederrum gesunder Ern?hrung, Dein Gewicht wieder auf normal Stand bringen.  Noch ein Tip: Wenn Du, wie ich auch, versuchen m?chtest, Schwangerschaftsstreifen so gering wie m?glich zu halten, da hilft nur T?GLICH eincremen/ ?len/ Massieren. Am besten soll da habe ich geh?rt, ein Produkt von Wileda (oder so) aus der Apotheke sein. Ich werde mir das auch in den n?chsten Tagen holen.   Habe vor ein paar Tagen selber erst erfahren, dass ich nun endlich Schwanger bin und habe mich daraufhin non-stop erkundigt, was alles zu beachten ist.  Hoffe Dir geholfen zu haben.  Herzlichen Glckwunsch zur Schwangerschaft und mache Dir nicht so viele Sorgen um Dein Gewicht. Das wird schon nicht ins extreme gehen.

Some babies are born with straight hair and then it becomes curly after a year and some babies are opposite. This is also true for skin color.

Also when she was born she was very dark skinned but now she just looks like she has a good tan and her skin has lightened too and her cheeks are even pink!

AA10836898	I've tutored kids with milder degrees of autism (Asperger's or just high-functioning autistics).  Though I'm no expert, my conversations with the kids and their parents have convinced me that "autism" is an umbrella term for a bunch of conditions that appear similar in general but have so many manifestations that it's hard to know how to treat.  Experts say as much, too.    What I think can be the case for some is that they can learn to manage it (with parental help, of course), and what seems like extreme "differentness" in a youngster might be moderated as the child grows up.  It depends on the degree of the condition, of course.  I do know an autistic adult - she's very definitely autistic but is also an intelligent woman, a student, in fact, studying the pre-med curriculum so she can apply to med school (and go on to do research on autism).    Your concern and anxiety are absolutely reasonable and understandable, but good things can still be a part of life for you and your family.  However, regardless of what anyone here says (including me), your best bet is to get the evaluation you have in process.    Good luck!|`|AA11348985	My nephew has high-functioning autism. He was just diagnosed this past summer. He's 4 y/o and knows spanish fluently, basic times tables, and basic algebra. However, his social skills are lacking and he has very precise routines he needs to go through in order to get through the day. My advice to you is to take him to a specialist. Ask around in your community. Find other parents who have autistic children and ask for recommendations for specialists. Don't jump the gun, becuase there are other reasons for that behavior as well. There's also something called asburger's syndrome, which is basically the step between normal and autism. However, it SOUNDS like autism. You described my nephew perfectly! Good luck!|`|03fcd1d48a4b618603c4a0eaf3eb6716aa	Before you go down the autism road look into something called SLI or Specific Language Impairment.  See if it fits your boy more than Autism.  Five year olds are quirky - and EVERYTHING they do will look "weird" if it's coupled with low speech and language.  Sometimes it's just a kid being a kid and nothing more to read into sometimes it's more.  Get second and third opinions on everything.

From what it sounds like to me, your son has Autism or Asperger's, though if it were Asperger's his speech would likely be more advanced than what it is. People with Asperger's usually don't have the speech delays that people with Autism do.  I can tell you from experience that many people will say to you "Your son can't be autistic, he doesn't line up his toys "or But your son is able to talk. Autistic people don' t talk". Never listen to this nonsense. There is no one characteristic that is present in every single autistic person. Though my son hasn't been officially diagnosed, ( he has been diagnosed with PDD pending further eval. That basically means he is autistic they just haven't narrowed down the exact disorder.) I have never doubted for a second that my son is autistic. He has way too many symptoms. But to prove my point, my son does make eye contact and he does interact thoughit is on a limited basis. We have a wonderful bond and he is very affectionate with my husband and I and a few other people. All things that people say Autistics DON"T do. Dealing with this will be hard, but remember that your son is the same child as he was before you knew he was autistic and that this is doesn't have to be bad or scary. My son is my entire life and whether you believe it or not there will be things about his disorder that you will come to cherish and appreciate. It is a part of who he is, but there is so much more to him than his disorder. My son will most likely never be an average kid, but that's okay. We will find a way to manage this because my love for my son is so much stronger than his autism. If you find the same strength, you and your son will be okay. Just remember not to lose hope, because you can't beat this if you do. Whether it is a year or ten years from now, don't give up. Good luck and best wishes to you and your son|`|AA12112224	My son is not quite 2 and they say if he isnt talking by the time of his 2 year check up they are going to test him for it. He only says about 3 words, and most people cant understand him. From what I understand from my doctor they are trying to catch it as early as possiable so they can get help. I truly hope everything works out for you.

Kinder, die sich selbst vertrauen und an sich glauben, gehen mit offenen Augen durch das Leben und machen uns zuversichtlich, dass sie in unserer komplizierten Welt gut zurechtkommen.    Selbstbewusste Kinder besitzen eine Reihe von F?higkeiten, die mit Vertrauen und Selbstvertrauen, innerer Sicherheit und St?rke, aber auch mit Mut und Entschlusskraft zu tun haben. Es ist noch gar nicht so lange her, als die Wissenschaftler noch glaubten, dass solche Eigenschaften angeboren sind und sie ein Leben lang fortbestehen.    Heute wissen wir, dass Kinder erst allm?hlich zu kleinen Pers?nlichkeiten heranreifen und dass diese Entwicklung sehr leicht zu st?ren ist. Damit aus einem hilflosen S?ugling eine selbstbewusste und starke Pers?nlichkeit wird, braucht jedes Kind ganz ganz viel W?rme und Geborgenheit, Aufmerksamkeit und Zuwendung, aber auch F?rderung und Ansporn.    Um dieses Ziel zu erreichen, werden von uns Eltern gro?e Anstrengungen abverlangt, Anstrengungen aber, die sich lohnen.

Wenn das Kind sieht, dass es akzeptiert wird, dann steigert das automatisch das Selbstwertgefhl. So frh wie m?glich als gleichwertig behandeln, auch wenn das natrlich in euren Augen unsinnig ist, aber lieber das kind etwas berfordern, als es in zu dicke Watte einzupacken. Und es soll sich ja nur gleichwertig fhlen und nicht wirklich ein Entscheidungsrecht ber zB den n?chsten Autokauf bekommen.

a298446e0bf2f2f5cefd59de3c347549aa	Depends on the test. I work for the lab in a hospital if it is normal blood test like a CBC or CMP, it will be done within an hour or so.

15e5786baaf7d40b1fc6955511fbaa1caa	10. Tender, swollen breasts  One of the early signs of pregnancy is sensitive, sore breasts caused by increasing levels of hormones. The soreness may feel like an exaggerated version of how your breasts feel before your period. Your discomfort should diminish significantly after the first trimester, as your body adjusts to the hormonal changes.     9. Fatigue  Feeling tired all of a sudden? No, make that exhausted. No one knows for sure what causes early pregnancy fatigue, but it's possible that rapidly increasing levels of the hormone progesterone are contributing to your sleepiness.    You should start to feel more energetic once you hit your second trimester, although fatigue usually returns late in pregnancy when you're carrying around a lot more weight and some of the common discomforts of pregnancy make it more difficult to get a good night's sleep.     8. Implantation bleeding  Some women have a small amount of vaginal bleeding around 11 or 12 days after conception (close to the time you might notice a missed period). The bleeding may be caused by the fertilized egg burrowing into the blood-rich lining of your uterus  a process that starts just six days after fertilization  but no one knows for sure.    The bleeding is very light (appearing as red spotting or pink or reddish-brown staining) and lasts only a day or two. (Let your practitioner know if you notice any bleeding or spotting, particularly if it's accompanied by pain, since this can be a sign of an ectopic pregnancy.)   7. Nausea or vomiting  If you're like most women, morning sickness won't hit until about a month after conception. (A lucky few escape it altogether.) But some women do start to feel queasy a bit earlier. And not just in the morning, either  pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting can be a problem morning, noon, or night.    About half of women with nausea feel complete relief by the beginning of the second trimester. For most others it takes another month or so for the queasiness to ease up.     6. Increased sensitivity to odors  If you're newly pregnant, it's not uncommon to feel repelled by the smell of a bologna sandwich or cup of coffee and for certain aromas to trigger your gag reflex. Though no one knows for sure, this may be a side effect of rapidly increasing amounts of estrogen in your system. You may also find that certain foods you used to enjoy are suddenly completely repulsive to you.     5. Abdominal bloating  Hormonal changes in early pregnancy may leave you feeling bloated, similar to the feeling some women have just before their period arrives. That's why your clothes may feel snugger than usual at the waistline, even early on when your uterus is still quite small.     4. Frequent urination  Shortly after you become pregnant, you may find yourself hurrying to the bathroom all the time. Why? Mostly because during pregnancy the amount of blood and other fluids in your body increases, which leads to extra fluid being processed by your kidneys and ending up in your bladder.    This symptom may start as early as six weeks into your first trimester and continue or worsen as your pregnancy progresses and your growing baby exerts more pressure on your bladder.     3. A missed period  If you're usually pretty regular and your period doesn't arrive on time, you'll probably take a pregnancy test long before you notice any of the above symptoms. But if you're not regular or you're not keeping track of your cycle, nausea and breast tenderness and extra trips to the bathroom may signal pregnancy before you realize you didn't get your period.     2. Your basal body temperature stays high  If you've been charting your basal body temperature and you see that your temperature has stayed elevated for 18 days in a row, you're probably pregnant.    And finally...     1. The proof: A positive home pregnancy test  In spite of what you might read on the box, many home pregnancy tests are not sensitive enough to detect most pregnancies until about a week after a missed period. So if you decide to take one earlier than that and get a negative result, try again in a few days.|`|7373fcb77ea8e721b1c8c84871da360daa	I think Avery summed it up for everyone.

As long as your child does not suffer in that you provide him with a sibling if you can and that he feels welcome to have his friends to play whenever he wants then I doubt that it matters. Besides we all love the kids that we raise the most whether we admit it or not.|`|ae7622ff556408acc77ced6e5b986cf6aa	A lot of people I know are like that. Actually, almost all people I know are like that. Don't worry, it's perfectly normal.|`|fc75d67a96a8f10963c9a8a6781e0faeaa	thats ok. i feel the same way.|`|611fe3d2f958513aa8786e785cbce021aa	Don't feel bad, I feel the same way.  Other people's kids annoy me to no end.  I'm always thinking to myself "thank goodness they are not my kids..."|`|7f2ed7c0384889c143034e22500c3dbeaa	I agree wiht you. Not all people love other children. I love my kids and I have some friends kids I really love, but some kids can really get on my nerves. Most of my friends have the same beliefs in raising children as I do so that helps.|`|3bd2c3c1f18be095e24002205b2c6400aa	no you sound really self centered and evil|`|258e111d9f41b74795cfc21f74849106aa	Yes...I love my daughter to death, but I can hardly stand other people's kids.  I can tolerate my neices for so long, but my patience wears thin with them.  I think that it is normal.  I know other people like that, too.  I find myself bothered by the way other people's kids act in public.  I think, yes, that it may get better as your son gets older, and starts having personal friends, and such...but it may not go away completely.  It may just be a personality trait!!    But, you are not alone....I know that I am that way, too.|`|2fd851d562996110f4397231f16ef07aaa	Don't feel bad. My entire life revolved around kids. I started volunteering at a daycare when I was 12. I went on to work for pay at other daycares, be a nanny, a Sunday school teacher, an infant care manager at a child development center, a pre-school teacher, the lead caregiver at an after school center, and a substitute elementary school teacher.    Guess what? I cannot stand being around other people's kids. I used to love kids but then I had my own. I love my own but I cannot be bothered to deal with those of other people. Don't get me wrong. I adore my nieces and nephews. My oldest has some friends that I think are great kids. I'm not against all kids or anything. But for the most part other people's children annoy the heck out of me and I no longer have the desire to make a living by working with them. I'd rather be home with my own. I don't know if it is a result of just being busy with my own or the fact that terrible parenting trends are creating some terrible children.

Or when your temperature is higher. Eg Take it daily, first thing when you get out of bed.|`|AA11416432	Best results come when you are ovulating - that is when the egg is released from the ovary.  This varies from woman to woman but is generally half way between two periods (eg 14 days after it starts if you have a 28 day cycle).  You can buy test kits that tell you when you are ovulating.|`|73ac48b9c2c8f3f4ba509b820e5815f7aa	try to check this link which gives you tips to be pregnant.
