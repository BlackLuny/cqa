20090310024450AAG0Anj	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Was that really remedial classes?	i just remembered something from sixth grade.      i had been tried in the advance class as i was incredibly smart and bored in class.. but i didn't have the attention span and managed straight 20's or 30's the whole time. i just never could pay attention or get the homework in (i forgot to do it/lost it on the way).       so they decided to put me back in regular.. or what they called regular anyway.  it was a class with only 4 other kids in it.  we started each day by practicing drawing our shapes on little chalkboards (triangle, square, circle....).  when we got it right as we did it all together out loud we were given lots of praise and a sucker.  she kept lots of blow pops for us!      after that we worked on negatives and positives but were given these little plastic thingies with 2 colored sides to represent negative/positive and we used these to count on!        then we would get to the assignment which was done as a group on the chalk board all except for 3 problems.  she saved those 6 for us to do on our own.  then we would grade it together the next day by going over it.  you always started with a 70 to make sure you would pass.  if you just attempted the problem, you still got 5 points for trying.  that way, if you tried on them all, you still got a B+.  and no one would have low grades.        and no one ever had the same assignment. if a kid had trouble on something,  the teacher gave them extra attention and didn't make them grade their homework so long as they tried.        they claimed it was regular level classes and the teacher said she was a regular level teacher.. but i have my doubts.  we were counting to 10 and learning shapes at 12 years old!  and every class ended in a Popsicle and outside playtime.        were my suspicions correct that this was special ed?  even if they insisted it was just a regular class?

I posted last night under a different name because I had used my maximum questions for the day yesterday. My husband and I have not been on good terms lately, and I think I may have PPD. We have a 2 year old and a 3 month old. I'm too afraid to speak with him about anything because I always get blown off and told my feelings are ridiculous. After days of tears, I finally approached him and asked him for his help. Granted, it was midnight, but I couldn't sleep. I asked if he was still awake, and I told him I think I need help. I told him I think I may be suffering from PPD and I don't know who to turn to without being judged. All he said was "I know the feeling". When I told him I guess what I was doing was reaching out to him for help, he told me to roll over and go to sleep...that just made me feel worse, and I cried the whole night.      What else should I/could I do? I need my husband's support..not just the support of a doctors prescription pad.

Family wll be there and im sure a few friends will be able to make it to the one my mom  is going to throw. So Im just curious what are good items to ask for, I know clothes are of all sizes since someone told me there baby was born 9lbs and somethin and didnt even fit into any of the newborn stuff, so that would be bad and i didnt even think about that at all.

20090310034652AAlQrpT	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	How do I get my son to use fewer diapers?	My 10 year old son wears diapers because of an injury he had. He can't control his urine. Thank God that he's very healthy aside from this and will be able to live a full and happy life!   There is a constant trickle. My son, who is responsible for changing himself, would change himself as soon as his diaper got the slightest bit wet. He was using 12 to 15 diapers a day, and they're not cheap. Our baby daughter only goes through 6 or 7 a day. I told our son that he couldn't use more than that. He promised to do that, but he kept doing as before. We still let him change himself, but now we control the diaper supply. When he wants a new one, he has to come to us. And he's only given two spares to take to school. I know it's embarrassing for him to have to tell his parents every time he needs a diaper change, but he just isn't being responsible when we leave him in charge. And the diapers he uses are bigger and therefore twice as expensive as baby diapers. How can we make our son responsible. I really want him to feel independant about this.

20090310040410AAlAM3G	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	How old is 'too old for an abortion', i.e. average age one should be ready to raise a child? Survey?	I hold the theory that by a certain age, one SHOULD be financially + emotionally ready to have a baby if they happened to fall pregnant.  So although it is perfectly legal to get an abortion at an older age, I personally believe that some people are essentially "too old" to have an abortion, i.e. they are at an age where they 'should' be mature enough to take responsibility for the child.      From what I've read on Yahoo Answers, I'm not the only girl who believes there's such a thing as essentially being "too old" for an abortion.      So, I ask all of you:  Just curious, what age do you think a girl SHOULD be established + mature enough to take responsibility and have the child(as opposed to abortion), i.e. what age is "too old" to choose abortion?

I am in the process of setting up my sons room and have created a chart for the wall that has all his milestones on it, I thought I had them all in my phone, but cannot locate them, I have his first tooth, his first commando crawl, his first real crawl, his first word and when he first sat on his own but that is about all I can remember.      I would also like to know some other milestones that he will reach in the future so I can continue on with his chart.      Thanx for your help.

Just wondering if any one had any advice for me as I will be taking my son away in september to Spain. He will be 8 months old by then.

20090310051859AASJZwv	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Would you suggest using OPKs?	Hi,       I am back with my partner following the loss of our baby - we found out on Thursday that our little one had no heartbeat.      I had a D&C on Friday but have experienced no bleeding just cramps that I am taking paracetamol and dicloflex tablets for.        We both been talking and would like to try for a baby.      I been speaking to my doctor who says there is no reason to wait other than to be emotionally ready and for dating purposes...      HOWEVER, the questions I have is, seeing as I have had 2 missed miscarriages, is the chances of a third miscarriage increased if I fall pregnant again straight away - as some mate has told me?!       Also, last time I am 100% sure i concieved on my ovulating dates - didn't need the use of OPKs but I wondering if this time it is best to use OPKS as will my cycle be a bit messed up due to having the D&C.      I been through a missed miscarriage and a D&C before but at that time I was not really ready to try again so didn't need to worry about things like increase in miscarriage and OPKs.      Please can you offer me some advice and also any hopeful stories.      I am 26 and 27 this year.      Thanks!      Lx
20090310051242AACrnYx	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Anybody else's toddler short for his/her age?	Ok - so I took Austin for his 18 month well visit on Friday and he was 31 inches tall.  Apparently this is only the 13th percentile.  The doctor made some comment like "I'd like to see him in at least the 25th%".  In my head I was thinking "how the heck am I supposed to make him grow taller??".  Anyway - I'm not asking how to make my kid get taller (hahaha) - I'm just wondering if anybody else had "short" toddlers that eventually became "average" height or should I just assume that he's always gonna be short....      By the way, I'm only 5'5" and my husband is 5'10".

20090310052430AAoGjBN	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What should I do? Very confused!?	I know how strange this must sound, but I really need some advice.      I have babysat for a family 3 times now and they have an 8 year old boy. Last weekend I went down to their tv room to see what he was up to, and I found him sitting on the floor with his pants and underwear off, and their new puppy between his legs. He was letting the dog lick his dink. He was actually erect.      I wasn't sure what to do! I probably made a mistake but I just went back upstairs. I guess I should have went in and stopped him, but I didn't know what to say.   Later I thought about what would have happened if the dog bit him!      Should I have gone in and stopped him? I guess I should tell his mom, but not sure how to.      I've never babysat a boy before him. I was even surprised that his dink was hard. Why would he do this?.

20090310041214AA0T9PI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Appendicitis, Ectopic Pregnancy or Ovarian Cysts?	I'm going to start from the beginning with this one as it confuses me never mind anyone else! It is quite a few questions really! I'll understand if you can't be bothered to read it all - I'm just stressing a bit!      My period was due 6 days ago but the day before I was in agony - I had a stitch like pain all over my abdomen (from under my breasts to the top of my legs). It was a constant pain for about 24 hours then it started to ease off. During this 24 hours I called my doctor and made an appointment. I got one for the next day.      When I went in the next day the pain had subsided but it was still pretty painful so the doctor examined me. She prodded around in my stomach and it really hurt when she pressed down on my lower right abdomen. She thought it could be appendicitis or ectopic pregnancy. She did a pregnancy test and that came back negative so she sent me to hospital.      I arrived at the hospital and after the usual 2 and half hour wait I was seen by a surgeon who said because the pain had subsided he thought he may have been an ovarian cyst that burst causing the pain and now my body was reabsorbing the fluid. Which makes sense.      But I'm still worried. My period still hasn't turned up and I'm still waiting for the doctor's to ring to arrange a scan (to check for more ovarian cysts), I'm also still in agony (not as bad as when it started but it still bloody hurts). I'm taking four lots of paracetamol a day (my limit) and it doesn't touch the pain! It's always there!       Also, my friend just found out she was 12 weeks pregnant and she's been getting false negatives for 8 weeks of that pregnancy. She got our other friend to do a pregnancy test (she's 8 months pregnant) and (to her shock) that also came back negative. I've also had the following syptoms;   No period pain - or period - just the weird stitch like pain   Nausea - constantly   Dizzy Spells   Enhanced Smell - I can smell stuff better than anyone around me - been told it's a sign of pregnancy   Tired all the time! I'm sleeping almost 12 hours a night and I'm still knackered!    Crying/Emotional for no reason   Constipation - I haven't been since before period was due   Covered in spots - usually spot free   Headaches - think this is because I'm so tired   Backache - but I do suffer from this sometimes anyway   Sore/Tender Breasts - somedays my nipples are so sore I can't touch them   Dreams of pregnancy - I think this is because I'm hoping I am   Craving sweet things - I'm a savoury kinda girl!      So my questions are;   I've heard that ovarian cysts can effect you fertility. Is this correct?   The test at the doctors was negative but could I still be pregnant?   If I am pregnant could it be ectopic? Is this why I'm in pain?   I'm taking a lot of paracetamol should I cut down until I have a positive or negative pregnancy result?   Will the scan show up the pregnancy? They'll be looking for ovarian cysts not preganancy.   I'm taking folic acid everyday (have been since we started trying) could this be what's causing the pain?      I guess I just want some reassurance really. My partner and I have been trying for a baby but we've said when it happens it happens. I know stressing about it won't help either!       Anyone got any advice to calm my nerves before I get the results of my scan? I'm calling the doctor today to try and sort out my appointment. I think I'm also going to do a home pregnancy test - probably tomorrow morning - to put my mind at ease!      Thanks in advance!

20090310044121AAOccIT	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	How many lives has my daughter got left?	OMG! My daughter is 21 months old So far she has had many bad accidents (these don't inclued all the times she has fallen off the couch, I stopped taking her to the doc for these a long time ago)      *Poured boiling water down her front!   *Fallen over outside and smacked her head on the brick edging of a raised garden bed.   *Jumped from the top bunk!   *My 6yr old dropped a rock on her foot yesterday and it looks like she'll loose two nails because of it. But it's fine other wise.      and tonight she has just been dancing like a ballerina in the lounge. Done a few twirls then she tripped and fell backwards into the TV cabinet glass door. She managed to have her head in the cabinet and body out of it with out a scratch and I get stitches in my hand because I was not careful enough when I pulled her out.      The nurses at the hospital now stop us when we see them at the shops. Well one of them does.      I can't believe it! Has any one else had a very accident prone child?   When do they grow out of it?   When can I expect a solid nights sleep? Because I'm totally plagued with what tomorrow will bring!

20090310050650AA3FzKL	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Girls bikinis please help me with this?	I am 17 yr old lad, in the middle of last summer, I saw mum talking to the woman next door, who she has been friends with for along time. Anyway to cut story shorter, the woman went back in and few minutes later she came out and gave mum carrier bag with something in it.       Mum brought the bag in and then put in old chest of drawers under stairs in our house.   Little while later mum went out and I looked in bag, and I found that it contained woman’s daughter who was 15 at the time 5 bikinis that I had seen her wearing.      I told girl about it and since then we have been seeing each other and I have been taking bikinis whichever one she wanted out of house so she could wear at local pool.      But now there is a problem because she wants to go swimming Thursday and when I went to get the bikini I saw.      All 5 bikinis have these triangle tops and the strings that hold them together are missing, 2 bikinis have side tying pants that had strings that could be pulled out they are also gone.   The other 3 bikinis the bottoms have the legs sewed closed.      I think mum has found out about it and put stop to me helping girl to wear the bikinis. Do you think I am right about this and what do you think in general about it.      What do you think about mum busting and sewing up the girls bikinis like this?

Last week she lost a key and blamed my daughter so she wouldn't get in trouble, her mother yelled and cursed at my daughter.

20090310044836AAUT6YV	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Anyone else have this problem?	Basically im just over 14 weeks pregnant now, and past month or so, keep getting bad back ache and pains down my right hand side, they are on and off, some days aim fine, some days its annoying the hell out of me! Plus i get the pains going down the right hand side of my bum and down my leg.      I know the baby is fine..had first scan last week, and heartbeat was strong etc. I was wondering if it was anything like sciatica as it equals the sort of back pains i usually have had in the past...had back probs since i was 18, so 10 years of bad backs is enough for me to know its not nice to start with.       Also if you have had this problem or are going through same thing, what helps you get through it, as i know that my usual thing of going to the chiropractor is now out of the question, as they are rough on you to start with, so with a little one i cant really do that!      Thanks :0)

Like if I have this picture of my perfect dress in my head and it doesn't come out right. I will get upset.      So,    Should I let her make it?   What would you do?      Thanks :)?

20090309154637AAUisZW	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Question about my cervix?	I have been told by my doctor and my family practitioner that my cervix is 1 to 2 inches away from the average place. it is really hard for me to get checked for being dialated since my cervix is 5 to 6 inches inside of me instead of 4. I dont want to be rude but the nurse who checked me the other day have very short fingers so it hurt really badly. I was wondering if anyone else has ever had this problem and did you ask for someone with very long fingers to do your checks?

20090225085351AAzD8mn	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Question about parental rights?	My sister just had a baby boy this morning, and the guy that she has been dating off and on for the past 2 years, and has been there the whole pregnancy is ready and willing to sign the birth certificate. We know there is a big possibility this baby isn't his, but he doesn't care. He wants to sign the Birth Certificate, and wants 100% responsibility of the baby. My question is once he signs the acknowledgment of paternity, and Certificate does that mean he is the father to this baby. Or if by some chance another guy wants to order a paternity test do they have to agree to it, knowing the birth certificate was already signed, and her boyfriend has take the father figure in the baby's life. And what if something happens to her and the boyfriend. Say they break up. Does my sister have a right to draw child support on the baby through the ex, or will a paternity test be ordered, and another question if something does happen between the 2 of them, and he is on the birth certificate as the father can he fight for custody of this baby? I worry for my little sister, and I don't want her to get herself into a place where she could loose the baby if it came to a custody battle. I want this baby to have a mother and a father, even if that means never knowing who the real father is. I am also concerned that if this guy isn't the father and someone else wants to know if they are or not does that give them rights to a dna test if a signature is already on the birth certificate?
20090309152450AAJjc5G	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	My grandmother has been keeping a baby since she was 8 weeks. Can she take her?	Alright its a long story.   I am 19 and in May of 08 I graduated from high school. My boyfriend of 4 years and I had been looking into moving out and when we found an apartment in June, we left home and moved in together. A week into us living alone one of my best friends from high school called and for the first time in months we just talked. I found out that she was having trouble with her baby living at home with her parents. I asked my bf and he said she could stay with us. She, the baby, and the babys dad moved in. For 2 weeks it was fine...after that they found a trailer to move into and were trying to get it liveable (yes I said LIVEABLE) so they started leaving the baby with me. The place they were moving was utterly disgusting. They kept the baby for one or two nights at a time and I had her 5 or 6 days a week. They couldnt live there long as neither of them work, so they moved in with the babys dad's brother and pregnant wife. They made it clear that when their baby came, they would have to move out. Somewhere in all this chaos, my boyfriend and I moved an hour away from our hometown so I could attend UAB. My grandma had watched the baby a few times for me before (yes I babysat enough to have to get myself a babysitter) and she started keeping her 24/7. I miss her so much right now, even though I still get her a few days a week. Her parents have never even bought diapers, formula, clothes, nothing. I even bought her crib. Her grandparents dont care either. Noone wants this child. She is 11 months now and has her own room at my grandmas. Her parents see her maybe once a week but they will not give up custody. He lost the job he had on thursday and they are moving back in with his mom. they didnt have heat or air in the house. they bought flat screen tvs and rings and cars but couldnt turn on the heat so they could keep their baby. it sickens me. i want to do something. this little girl is my LIFE and i want her. my entire family claims her like shes mine and i would like nothing more than to know she is. how can i fight them? they cant take care of her. and when they could have they didnt. friendships aside, i love her too much to care. money is no object. i want this child...somebody tell me what the best way to go about it would be. we have to do it quick. if they find out they will run with her. everyone in town knows that shes been in mine and my grandmas care for 9 solid months. i have plenty of people to back me up. plz help. im at my wits end. and how am i supposed to know that if i report it, even though she is very stable where she is, that they wont take her away from me??   thanks for any infor you may have.
20090225084329AAta2fQ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	TWW is terrible... do you ever just wish that AF would hurry up and show?	Well, all of my charting efforts went down the tubes this month and I'm growing quite frustrated. I've been TTC for 8 cycles now and this cycle (though we baby danced, of course) since I was not charting I have no idea when I ovulated. I usually ovulated around CD15-16, with only a 10-day luteal phase. But, this past cycle I started taking Vitex (this is my second cycle on Vitex) and I ovulated around CD11 with a 12-day luteal phase. So, now I really have no idea what's going on. I noticed some EWCM on February 13th, that's the best indicator I have. So, right now my best guess is that I'm 12DPO (who knows though) and I'm having NO symptoms, just some slightly tender breasts, which are usual for me. I also have some cramping on and off and I just know stupid AF is going to show any minute now! I wish she'd just hurry up and get it over with so I can try again!       Anyone else SUPER frustrated, like to share any stories and vent?       Good luck ladies! I hope everyone gets their BFP soon and baby dust to all of us TTC!

20090225084004AAnDe62	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	I need your opinions.. Please Help!?	My daughter is going to be 3 months old on March 1. I weighed her the other day caused she is getting rather large lol. But she weighed 16lbs. I am concerned about this. I know that at my her last checkup she weighed 10.5lbs and that was less than a month ago. My mother in law keeps her everyday while my husband and I work because we are trying to move into our new home and money is a little tight. I think she may be giving her cereal without our permission and this worries me. My doctor said no cereal until 4months old. The reason I believe this is because:   1) a few of my bottle nipples were so cut causing my daughter to choke on formula (i know you have to cut the nipples for cereal) when I confronted my MIL with this she said she accidentally did it.    2) when I make a comment about Kylie's (my daughter) weight she says well its not like im giving her cereal.     3) Kylie spit up the day before yesterday and it was not liquidy like her normal spit up.   4) she sleeps too much during the day so when my husband and I get home from work, Kylie keeps us up until 4:00am and we have to get up at 5:30am for work. So needless to say we are sleep deprived.      What do you think. Am I over reacting and jumping to conclusions?

For a school function I am required to go to this store during school hours. However your parents are supposed ot pick you up, and mine will not be available. If I wanted to I could walk back from the store to the school and take the after school bus which would take about an hour. I want to know if I should do this because it would take me an hour to walk. I would be walking on the side of a major highway, and I am unsure if I would make it back in time. However, I have no one else to take me at all. Should I do this? or should I take a public bus home? Or should I speak to the school and ask for some type of alternative and risk being removed from the event.( Fashion show btw) Any better suggestions? Thank you. Oh and i am 14 years old.   It will be 45 degrees outside. Or should I take a bus which I have never taken before so I am unsure of how they work.....but it would get me ot my destination. .and I would get to go home instead not just to the school.

My daughter had her first tantrum as she just turned 11 months. She threw herself around, kicked and screamed and wouldn't listen to me at all.       So I did the only thing I could do - I put her in her play pen where she wouldn't hurt herself. I sat beside her until she stopped then gave her a cuddle.       Now she's started doing it all the time. If she wants something (usually a sweet treat) or doesn't get her way. Is it time I started putting her in her high chair for a time out?

Okay I am so confused this month...I am to get my period on 3/12 or that is when i am expecting it....I took an early detection prego test and i got the BFN....I have been watching my monitor but everything else i kind of said the heck with it this month....Anyway now to the questions...my monitor is still reading high and has been reading high for almost 3 weeks now?  This cant be normal is it?  I have been cramping starting yesterday on my right side sometimes and my left side others?  The cramping is right next to my pelvic bone...Could this be implantation cramping?  I mean would I have implantation 3 weeks after the start of my high days?  Then I have a lotiony CM fluid....I thought you got that when you were prego?  And if and when you start AF it would dry up a little?  Which is it?  I am so dang tired I cant stand it....I am sleeping 10 to 12 hours and when i get up i feel so drained I can barely move and I want to get back in bed, which sometimes I do....What is up with that?  I thought I had it all down but obviously I am wrong.....The only other thing I am having out of the ordinary is this month since about the begining of the week I have been burping and gasy...Gross but when i do burp it is like this fishy taste i guess you can say...it is so gross i want to puke.....What is this?  I do have sore breast but that comes with my period....my boobs get bigger and the nipples get really sore and i have been playing that up to me getting AF......Im bloated too but this is another thing that happens when AF comes.....Just a little confused this month and need so advise from you guys.....Thanks for the answers and lots and lots of baby dust to you guys!!!!

20090309132839AAjSOqW	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	I have a question on day cares?	So i applied for a job at this one daycare and the director is somewhat family so i got the job automatically. I went in to meet with her and for her to show me around and it was absolutely horrid. It was like a jail. There were no lights and no windows and the children just sat there and looked at each other as if they would be slapped if they talked. The walls were all marked up and the rigs were filthy. I don't know how a parent could send their child there. I'm surprised that it passed the health inspection or the building codes. I'm only 17 and she told me i would have to get used to restraining special needs children because she has a few of them and they don't take meds. I think that is a little much to ask from me but i don't know. I'm petrified to start there though. There outside playground is a rusty old fence surrounding a heap of fischer price toys. I'm afraid i'll get tetanus if i open the gate. Should i work there? I'm not sure since she already gave me the job and I don't want to quit without starting even a day. I would call and say I couldn't but her son is marrying my cousin and her wedding's in June so it would be so awkward. I don't know  what to do. Any advice?

With all of my previous pregnancies, I was told that I ovulated and concieved the day after AF left!!!  I believe that I am currently 1DPO but am not really sure.  I do not want to buy those OPK because they tend to stress me out and take the fun out of it (just my opinion).  If I ovulated 1 day after AF left, that would make me 11 DPO.  I am starting to get "the dreaded symptoms" (sore breast, back ache, tired, discharge).  So I am wondering if anyone else that has previously conceived has ever been told that it happened the day after AF left?      I have a 28 day cycle.  LMP Feb. 12.

20090309123602AAGBb8n	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	Son and Nanny(Repost)?	OK. I don't think anyone understood me. Know this before you read:   1. I don't hit my kids.   2. My son does not have ADHD or ADD or anything like that. He does not have an anger problem. He already sees a therapist for a private, family reason.   3. Yes my son is angry-angry about having a nanny!      Now with that in mind, please answer this:I have 8 kids. 7 live at home with me (my oldest is 19, in college and married) and 4 are under the age of 8 (6, 2 and 7 month old twins), so I hired a nanny. My older kids are 11, 13 and almost 15. They all (and my husband) agreed it'd be best if I got a nanny to help me with the younger ones. So my husband and I went to nannys4hire.com and found a great nanny. Everyone likes her.      Except for my 11 year old.      You see, my 11 year old is a trouble maker. So I told him that I have given the nanny permission to send him to his room if he misbehaves. My son agreed. I told the nanny the same thing and she said she was fine with it.      Yesterday I'm at the grocery store and I get a call from my 13 year old. Apparently my son has punched our nanny in the face and pushed her against the wall. I come home and find my nanny with an ice pack on her face and my son is standing there, his face smug and his arms folded over his chest. I ask what happened. Apparently my 6 year old son had misbehaved so the nanny was going to put him in timeout. My 6 year old refused to go to timeout and threw a big fit. So when our nanny picks him up to bring him to time out, my 11 year old grabs the 6 year old out her arms, puts him on the couch and punches her in face and shoves her in the wall and yells "DON'T TOUCH MY BROTHER!".      Nothing was broken and my nanny has agreed to stay-but never wants to be alone with my older son.      My son thinks he can rule the house. He's told me time and time again he feels like he's being babied with having a nanny there and every time I've told him that we need the nanny or I'll lose my mind. When I told him that yesterday he yelled at me: "Well maybe if you could keep your legs shut you wouldn't have so many kids!" That made me cry. When my husband came home just minutes later and saw me sobbing, he grounded my son and my son yelled "Don't tell me what to do!".      But in the end my son was grounded for two months. One month for being disrespectful to the nanny and one month for making me cry and being disrespectful to both me and my husband.      If we get another nanny I know nothing will change, so switching nannies won't work. And as I said, I'll lose my mind if I don't have a nanny.       What should I do with my son? Please help!
20090309154432AAgS82j	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Question about Provera?	Can you ovulate when taking provera, or does it just force a period to happen with no ovulation?

20090225083832AAR8nQB	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	2 month old feeds every 2-6 hours. Will I risk drying up?	Since a few days my daughter no longer feeds every 2-3 hours 15min per session. She now feeds about 5 minutes (which isn't what alarms me) but she doesn't always show hunger signs every 2-3 hours anymore. 2-3 times a day she doesn't show signs for over 5 and half hours (even after the 5 minute feedings)      I did start giving her a pacifier when she can't sleep (about two weeks ago), because I am trying to have her sleep on her own beside me instead of with me. It seems to be working because she's asleep within minutes. (She's a thumb sucker, so I'd rather have her on a pacifier which seems easier to wean from)      She seems content after feedings because she smiles and her tummy feels full. She rarely cries, has several wet diapers and one poo poo diaper p/day and seems to still be gaining weight. Her soft spot is not sunken. It just seems so extreme to not see her hungry for that long all of a sudden. Is this really "normal"?      Also, if I don't pump and only feed once every 2-5 hours (one breast at a time only) could this decrease my milk flow?

My daughter has gotten into the habit of waking at horrible times during the night lol It has become worse than a nightmare — at least you have to be asleep for a nightmare ! She's very restless, and when she's awake, she's awake !!!! She wakes about 12 midnight. I go to bed at 11:30 so it is really effecting me as in my mood, and my concentration at work & school as she does be awake for hours on end once she wakes. When she wakes, it's usually around 2-3am when she gets back to sleep. We are both up at 5:30am, so she's being effected too. When she wakes, I hardly communicate with her. She lies in her bed and sings, and talk to me, talks to her fingers, and tells them stories !    Her routine :   7:30 - Bath time ...   7:45 - she has a plain cracker, and 100 mls of warm milk & we watch t.v till 8:30.    8:30 - she gets into her bed, and we read a few books until she falls asleep. Usually, 9pm   *please, don't criticize the routine, because it is convenient for the of both us*    Is there anything I can do to accomplish this problem? Also, this has only been happening recently, and she is teething at the moment. She has only being like this for 2-3 weeks. She doesn't complain of her teeth, but she is noticeably fussy at times. She naps from 12 midday till 1:30 pm .... is her nap too long?       Thanks for any help & incite you can give ....

20090309122957AA3GefY	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Still dealing with toddler that won't eat. Please help!!?	My baby is 1 year and 5 months old.  He is normally a slim baby, and then.... he got the flu when he was 1 year and 3 months. He was weighing about 21 pounds around that time.  He didnt eat anything and went down to 18 pounds.  After the flu passed and a month passed too, and with a lot of work on my side cause he doesn't like to eat I have to make him eat all the time, he went up to 22 pounds.   Now, he got a cold, he hasn't been eating well for about 5 days. He's back at 20 pounds.  Barely eats anything, I have no idea how he has so much energy still.  I really want him to gain weight, I compare him to my friend's babies and they are all chubbier than him.  I know my husband and I are both skinny and with all my friends, either they are big or their husbands are, so might be just he's meant to be small.  But still I want him to gain a little bit of weight and I don't know how to do it.  I tried to feed him Pediasure but it's so expensive, I can't do that on a daily basis.  I try to put butter in his food, but again it's so hard for me to feed him, he doesn't get much butter in him anyway.       Has anybody had this problem with their babies? Is there anything I can do like give him any kind of vitamins that will make him hungry.  Has somebody had a conversation with a doctor about this and they were helpful?

20090227150114AAyAbdJ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Sounds CRAZY, but read for details: Should I allow my daughter to be hypnotized?	The student government at my daughters' school work hard all year with teachers and administration to bring fun events to the school for a low price to the students. They've hired local bands to play, they've done movie nights, and they've hired a hypnotist to come to school these past two years. It's about a two hour long show in the gym at about 8 o'clock; the place is filled with teachers and the principal for supervision. The students pay five dollars to go watch the show and fifteen volunteer students get hypnotized. My daughter really wants to do it, my other daughters are fine with just watching.      I know it's safe, because otherwise they wouldn't do this, and I'm also very skeptical - I'm not 100% sure hypnotism even works! Should I let my daughter volunteer?

After that we should be in our new place and they can have their own room, due to certain circumstances it couldn't take effect any sooner like we had originally thought.

20090309163522AAZUuZV	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Pregnant Nanny? what would you do?	I just found out yesterday that i am pregnant ( yay for me). I am 4 weeks.    I have worked as a nanny for the same family for almost a year , watching there daughter since she was 4 weeks old. I have very unique hours, i am there a 4 am and leave at  noon, so day care would never be an option for them, they need a nanny, and have no reliable family near by,and  i also do all the baby sitting.    I absolutely love them :) From there daughter( best baby i have ever watched) , to the mother whom i spend a half hour chatting with in the morning while the husband gets ready, to the husband who is good matured and funny, always giving me things to bring home to my husband ( unusual beer mostly). They will not be having anymore children, she is there pride and joy.   I am going to tell them next week that i am pregnant, this week is there daughter birthday and i do not want to take any of the spot light from them.    My plan is to have my mother fill in for me when i am on maternity leave, if that is okay with them. I haven't asked my mother yet ( she does not know i am pregnant) but i am positive she will fill in for me, because she was trying to find a nanny job for the morning like i have to earn some extra cash ( she is a mother of 10, and has always been a house wife, but the youngest is now 8 and she has lots of free time).   I plan on taking my baby ( it sounds so weird to say my baby, lol) to work with me, because that would be the ideal situation.   Well that's my hole story, How should i tell them? when should i tell them? in the morning when me and the mom talk, or when they get home from work. How would you take it if i was your nanny.   Oh i am 22 and married, i do not know if that makes a diffrence to you, but yea.      Thanks!

I go back to my dr. in 2 weeks for my first "lets get serious about this" appt. For the last year I have had a period every 2 weeks like clockwork. I had bloodwork done in Sep. and he told me I had "mild PCOS" because my LH:FSH was slightly off. He put me on BCP for a few months which helped, but hubby and I want to ttc so we were playing the waiting game. Now, we are tired of waiting and ready to take action. Just in your opinion, what direction do you think my Dr. will take? I have read many of your stories about clomid and other tests- I want to be as knowledgable as possible before I go into the appt. Thanks, I'm so nervous!!!      (I asked this this morning, but didn't get many repsonses- just looking for some "expert opinions" lol :)

Ok so get this, I was at the mall right, I was eating at some little place there.  Well sitting next to me was a mom with her son, probably about 4 years old I would say. I didn't know them.  So ok I see the mom pour the kid a big glass of soda, and than I say to her, "are you really gonna let him drink all that soda, it's probably not too healty for a kid his age, you should give him less", seriously that's all I said, and than she raises her voice at me and says "DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO WITH MY SON".  It caused a big scene, everybody turned around and looked at us, I was embarrassed.        So yeah if you were the mom in my situation, would you have yelled at me too?  Would you care if somebody told you what to do with your child?

Ok sorry for that but here goes my story.       3-8-08 BFP approx 5 or 6 wks   4-22-08 spotting, went to E.R. found out I M/C'd   4-24-08 had D&C   41 days later had first period    cycle was every 33 days like clockwork for the next 5 months.last normal cycle was 10-20-08, no  period in Nov or Dec. Had a very light period that started 1-31-09 only last 3 days(my cycles are always 5 or 6) pretty much just spotting except for day 2 there was a little more but not much. Now Im waiting again for AF.I have all kinds of symptoms,just about everyone there is to have, some can be attributed to PMS some can not.If I go by the 33 day cycle pattern, I should have started on the 5th. But I don't know if I should go by that since it hasnt been that way for the last few cycles. I just checked my cervix and it is pretty high up there but I CAN still feel it,and its kinda soft but kinda not. So I suppose my question is should I test or wait or.....what!?!?!?!? Feel free to IM or email me if you want or need anymore info to be able to answer my question. Thanks so much for your time.

My husband and I have received food stamps for about a year now and have not had a problem with it until now. My husband works on and off with my dad, and the welfare office has to know my husband's income at all times. Well my dad wants me to lie to my case worker about my husband working for him. He wants me to tell her that my husband is unemployed, because he's afraid that somehow the labor board will find out that he doesn't have worker's compensation.       I don't want to lie to them, I know that it's illegal and I could end up in jail over it. I don't want to loose my food stamps though. Right now my husband and I need the food stamps because my husband does not make a lot of money. I can't find a job, I have a stack of applications in at all kinds of places but I still haven't received a call back. My husband is looking for another job, but is having the same luck as me. I have told my dad that lying to them is not only illegal but is also wrong considering that those programs are there to help people in need, and the more people lie to them the harder it is for those that really need to receive the assistance.      This situation is cause a lot of strife in my family right now and I honestly don't know what to do. Please any advise would be great.      I know this is the wrong category but I always get the best answers here.

20090309161052AAub3WC	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Am I wrong for disciplining my 8 month old?	My son is 8mo and lately I have noticed he throws fits when he doesn't get what he wants...like being told no when he gets into something he shouldn't have. Anyway, today the puppy was sleeping by us on the floor and he kept grabbing his fur and yanking it. I said no the first few times and he would look at me and kind of smile then do it again. After a while I took both of his hands in mine and firmly said NO. I did this about 2 times and then said if he did it again he would sit in his room for 5 minutes. Of course he did it again so I put him in his room for the five minutes. Is that wrong?? Is it too early to start discipline of that nature?? I want him to grow up well behaved and this is my first child so Im not sure how to handle these fits.

20090227145050AAtowfM	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	No base for baby car seat?	The car seat I have is a 3 in 1 and when it was used for my 1st son I had to remove the base with the cup holder to fit in my car. I was told that was fine and we have sinced bought a minivan where a car seat is built in so he uses that now. My 2nd son is still rear facing in an infant car seat but will be moving to a bigger rear facing car seat soon and that was the one my 1st son used. Now, I can't find the base to this car seat and was wondering if it's okay to use it without the base in a bigger vehicle? Do you think it will fit okay for a 2004 Chevy Venture Minivan?

Every move he makes Alex screams daddy! and clings to him. Literally won't let my husband put him down without him crying and looking heartbroken. I try to entertain him so my husband could take a shower or go the bathroom even or have some time to relax once he gets home but our son just cries even while I'm holding him walking around with him and talking to him. After all day of being good for me he's like a whole new person as soon as daddy's around. This has been this way since he was 8 months old when I went to my mom's house for a week with him, she lives a few hours away.  As soon as we came home he was so glad to see his daddy and now he's like obsessed with him. It's like my husband gave birth to him not me and when he's around Alexander acts as if he doesn't know me. And on weekends it lasts the whole weekend... Was visiting my moms for a week a horrible mistake or is this a phase and if it is how long will this last?? I want my son back!

I have started feeling sick to my stomach(again), I would be about 28 weeks if I am prego.  I was on the pill, which might cause negative hpts, or even doctor urine tests because of hormones.  I have also been having my period, but I have known that in some cases, very rare, but it may happen that someone could get their period and still be pregnant.  I am overweight, and I don't think the "flutters" I am feeling is gas.  I really feel like there is something going on and I really could be prego.  I am extremely exhausted, I have been getting headaches, and I feel sick to my stomach.  I don't think this is a "phantom pregnancy either".  I am in my early 20s, so don't treat me like I don't know what I am talking about.  Just honest opions please.        Also, if I am, pregnant, how do you know the difference between flutters and the babies kicks?
20090309164627AAYFwAq	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	I'm a little worried about her... girls, what could be wrong?	My siblings and I don't have that great of a relationship with our parents, so we're pretty close. My sister (13, almost 14), has been acting weird lately. She went to a party, like 2 or 3 weeks ago? And since then I noticed that she's more quiet than usual. I found her crying in her room once, and sometimes I can hear her cry at night since our rooms are pretty close. She's completely stopped talking to her best friend. She broke up with her boyfriend. She's not eating much either. The time that I found her crying, she told me that she was having a bad dream. She's been staying away from me, my dad and my brothers.  She was in the basement playing a video game a couple days ago and I came up behind her and said boo, lol, and she turned and looked at me and screamed so loud. The look on her face was just pure terror. It's like she's afraid of men or something. I've done it to her before and she's never reacted that way. If I just touch her arm she flinches. I'm afraid something happened to her at the party. Do you have any ideas? I don't want to ask her if it's nothing.

His name is Alijah Jose Martinez (Jose is my husbands name). We just found out we are having another boy in a few months and I don't want the second boy to feel left out because our first child got my husbands first name as his middle name. So, we are putting our fathers middle names as our new son's middle name(s) (we can't decide on who's father and we like the way the initials will look) so he can feel special too.

My dad's name is Craig Allen but I don't like Allen, but I do like Callen (with the C from Craig and the Allen put together) and my husband's dad's middle name is Elias. So our new son's name would be Alonzo Callen Elias Martinez. His initials would be ACE-M. Also, I need to know, what do you think of the name Alonzo???

(I'm Hispanic, and we have long names)      I'm 15, 16 in April 4th. I want to change it to Sierra Lydia Alexander.      My Reason...: My parents didn't name me, a nun did after her sister, and I don't even know her! I hate long names, Luciann is a mess, I try to go by Edith but it's not enough. I hate my dad with passion, and that lastname reminds me every bit of him >:-( and my first name was unheard of practically until Jessica Alba became so well known.      Why I want the new name: I love the name Sierra means mountain, which is my favorite view of nature, and it's originally Spanish but known in the US. Lydia is a gorgeous name and in my opinion flows nicely. Alexander is a last name I can really live with, and I would like to give my baby also when she's born (July1st).      My mom and step dad will say yes, so, How can I change my name if i'm a minor? Some more information:      I'm becoming a US citizen this year, the last name Alexander is NOWHERE in my family and i'm not marry or know anyone who's last name is Alexander.

20090309162505AAerclP	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	My daughter won't take a nap unless I go in there with her.?	My daughter is 8.5 months old, and our daily routine is that, I will breastfeed her, and then she will go take a nap. When I put her down to take a nap I give her a binky, and she will be quiet for a few minutes, but she will start screaming. So I go in there, and sing a lullaby to her, but she won't stop crying. Eventually I have to sit there until she falls asleep, if she wakes up after around 15 minutes, and I'm not there, she will again start screaming. I will have to go in there, and sit there again. She doesn't like music or a teddy because she won't go to sleep with music, and she throws a teddy out of her crib. This is beginning to get out of hand.

20090309162631AAvMoE0	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Ok ladies I need some help ASAP!!?	I'm due for my period on 3-11-09 and it's 2 days before that. For the past few days I have been feeling a little nauseous around the same time in the day. Today i went to the bathroom and when i wiped i have a little brown blood on the tissue, which I really don't recall being normal for me. Also I have really light cramping, and normally when I'm getting my period there a lot worse before I would get it. Then i went to the bathroom a little later, looked in my panties to see if anything was there, and there wasn't, then when i wiped there was a streak of brown and a streak of light pink and in the pink streak there was a little red dot in it. I have been checking every time i use the bathroom if there anything at all in my panties and nothing yet. So I'm just wondering if this is just going to be a different period for me, or if you ladies think I might be pregnant. Me and my partner have been trying now for about 6 months, so anyone please help.

I'm in 8th grade and I have 4 neighbors(2 on each side) and they all go to my school. 1 is a girl in 6th grade and her twin brother is in 7th(they're both really annoying). Then in the other house there's a 7th grade boy and a 9th grade boy. I like the 9th grade guy.    now I'm home alone with my grandma and my evil b*tch of an aunt is coming here all the time. So I didn't want to be around her,so I was standing outside and the guys were riding bikes and I just kept staring at them without really realizing it,until I noticed they were all staring back at me,and I went inside really fast.I'm gonna have to see them tomorrow at the bus stop and I know they're gonna ask me why I was just standing there staring at them. What should I say? Thanks!

Okay, so today in Gym class a good friend of mine was like " Audra, That 6th grader said your legs are to fat for skinny jeans and you copied her shoes. And Theresa ( the girl from the above link ) said hi top converse are gay, so apparently she's gay." Well, i took it to the GC (Guidance counselor) and she settled it. But, that 6th grader has chubby thighs and she wears super-short-shorts that make her private show. I am so fed up with this and the GC did jack ****..and my mom talked to her friend who is a GC in another district and she said from what previously happened-she should have been in a-LOT of trouble. I was thinking to get revenge on her.. someone mentioned steal her most prized possession, her phone. I'd ? to do that,but i'd get in sooo much trouble. What should i do? I hate this school :/ [[don't mention move schools, this is the best school && the teachers and SOME ppl are nice.]]

I'd invite my closest friends, since my birthdays May 1st we'd have it in my house, eat pizza, listen to music, whatever. I'd invite my friends, including me & them there'd be a total of 5 people [[Lol, i'm inviting a small-amount of people.]   Then we'd hang out in my living room,talk,watch a movie. Sounds boring, but for some odd reason people just love my house. It's on a friday, so should i have the party after school that day until around 9 or 110 pm, or the saturday after.   So my two questions are   --Would people have fun   --Should i have it that friday or saturday?   -- Do you think my parents would allow the boys to sleep over? There'll be me, my friend [girl] and the rest are boys.

20090309113219AAIgR42	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Another question about the "leash" (harness)?	I used a harness with my son and I think it is wonderful but others defiantly don't see it that way. How I mean really, wouldn't you rather you child be safe? Do you realize that if someone really wanted to take you child they have it all planned out they know where to run and you might not ever catch them. If your kid is on a harness (not a leash) the chances of them getting away are like none, those things are so strong it's even hard to get them out of it. Me and my husband wanted to see how strong it was so we pulled on it (without my son in it lol) and he is very strong and works out daily and he could not even get one part of the velcro to budge.       Actually cool story once a actually major league baseball player asked me where can I buy that how wonderful we were at an event where the players were. And then you have other who stare and I always said stare all you want I know my baby is safer I hope they heard me and I'm sure they have. We only used ours when we were at malls or really crowed places like that. My son loved being more independent plus it beat wrestling with the stroller. Now that he is 6 years old obviously we don't use that any more but I will be buying another one when this one is old enough to start wanting to walk with mommy.       So so you agree with the harness and who sees it as a "dog" leash? I know I'll get a lot more leashes than people who will say yes I know my child is safe.
20090309122922AABcbyi	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Isn't this just disgusting...kind of long?	Okay so my cousin fosters and adopts dogs and I am not even kidding she has about 25 dogs at her house right now (ewwwww). She confines the little ones to her kitchen (again ewww) the bigger ones out side in her breeze way also there is a door where they can go run in her back yard. But you can't even get into her back yard without being jumped all over plus you have to watch out for land mines (poo). Now you would think these dogs are all up for adoption...haha guess again 14 of them are her own!!!!! Who needs 14 dogs?. Plus it's not even fair the pretty dogs who she clams she rescued from shelters who are pure bread (they could be it's very possible) those ones are the ones that get most of the attention. My thing is if you can't give every one of them equal attention then why have them. Plus it smells so nasty in her back porch and right now being pregnant it makes me really sick. She drove 4 hours to get a dog, FOUR hours!!!!! Why couldn't she just adopt one of the ones she already has? She wants us over more often but I just can't stand the smell in her back yard, plus I can't chance a dog jumping on me and knocking me down. I plan on telling her this when she calls and asks us over, I don't even want my kids there, these dogs are from the pound who knows wither they are okay with kids. Thing is she is a very clean person like her house is very nice and always nice and clean. She does have the ones that are hers fixed and they are up to date on there shots, and that brings me to my next point, my dad has had bad health problems for years and asked her once to burrow money because he had nothing after losing his home and she said she didn't have money to give him but that next day she was picking up her dog at the vet, I know this because I was taking our cat to the vet. I didn't mention anything because I didn't want to start another money war with her.       blah blah blah right? anyhow what to do you think disgusting? How the heck do I tell her I am not coming to your house until the dog population goes down?

20090309171806AAB5qgR	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Do you think i Should tell him how i feel?	Ive known him since we were 10 and I am completley crazy over him, We were sort of close when we were younger but since we entered highschool we heavent spoken at all.. We both liked eachother when we were younger and we still like eachother now.. its just we hang out with different people and every chance we get to be alone we can never find the right words to say to eachother.. cause we went so long without saying anything.. (if that makes any sense)..      I left highschool in 07 (droped out due to personal reasons) and our grade graduated in 08 .. fast forward to now, I see him EVERYWHERE I go.. and ever since I left highschool i cant stop thinking about him.. he was essentially the FIRST guy I have ever really crushed on, hes the first guy who I ever truly wanted.. I dated one guy in highschool and that was only because he begged me and i felt bad... it did not last long (lasted for a week) and my crush thank god did not find out. My crush is the ONLY real guy i wanted and the ONLY guy i still want !       So I havent been with another guy since and i am going crazy for him and I think he is going crazy for me because i literally saw him a few days ago driving by my neighborhood and he stopped his car JUST to watch me.. i didnt know who it was till i got closer to the car and saw him.. as soon as he noticed that I noticed him he drove a way.. Im still in shock that he actually STOPED his car to watch me walk past his car... which took about a good 20 minutes from where i was..       I guess some things never change.. I dont know how to go about contacting him.. I know he probably will never get the guts to tell me how he feels just because of the kind of person he is.. hes the kind of guy who keeps his emotions in and it takes alot for him to open himself up to people..Im like that as well but Im at my breaking point now..       He doesnt have a girlfriend and never dated anyone in highschool for obvious reasons lol.. and I think i might be in love with him..

20090309124302AA01hsm	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	How do I talk to her?	I keep asking along the same line of questions   but Iam compeletly worried and tryin to find all the different ways to approach her.      Iam 23 yrs old ..I was not innocent or the best teenager growing up But   my Little cousin whom Iam close with is 17 yrs old and looked up to me ever since we were little .pretty much is tryin to live up to me ( which I tell her to be herself but she doesnt get it )       She is running wild and I understand she is young which she keeps reminding me. But being young Isnt being stupid.   she's been locked up about 3 times so far ( minor chargers and they have been dropped ) she has a 25 yr old boyfriend who is her older brothers bestfriend and her family does not want her to see.1 because he's 25 . 2 its rumored he deals drugs and I do believe it because he has more wads of cash in his pockets then you could believe . She's sneaks out to meet him , she has sex with him in public places the movies , restrooms , drinking , whatever Im pretty sure she's probly doing drugs also.   She always wants me to cover for her ..I have done it but Iam no longer wanting any part of it. She has dropped out of school at 5th grade  ( she can not read ) she has No job!       I talk to her as much as I can but she just doesnt get anything Iam saying   Her parents either are too stupid to realize what is going on and when they do realize it they come down on her harded than a brick which makes her rebel MORE! she is thinking everything is a joke she cracks up laughing when I bail her out . she says "its ok he's my boyfriend" when I ask her what the hell shes doing F***king in a bathroom ... UGH what do I say to get her back on track ?!! Im so tired of this. and I dont want to cut her out of my life but Im figuring this is the only thing I can do

My wonderful husband leaves on Thursday for a year long deployment to the Middle East. I am currently 33 weeks pregnant, and have a 3 year old son. How do I explain to my son that when we leave him on Thursday, he won't be back for a very long time? Now my husband has gone to train for weeks at a time and my son just said that daddy was at work, but this is different. There won't be any phone calls for awhile, or coming home at night after work. I personally have never experienced this either, so it's new to me as well. I just don't know what to tell him when he asks for his dad, because he isn't coming back for a really long time. Has anyone on here been through this and can help me? I just need advice, because i'm going crazy. My raging pregnancy hormones are making me an emotional wreck =[ Thanks.

I am not a prude by any stretch of the imagination, but I always believed I shouldn't get pregnant unless I meant to get pregnant.

My 10-year-old son and 12-year-old daughter like to rough-house from time to time.  It's never very rough, but my son will occasionally give his sister a “titty twister.”  I know that he doesn’t do it with the intent to hurt her; he just thinks he's teasing her.  I’ve lectured him and have taken away privileges, and I’ve tried to convey to him that a girl's breasts are very sensitive, like his testicles.      Fed up, my daughter asked me today if she can give him a taste of his own medicine (and a lesson in sensitivity).  She wants to hit him in the testicles the next time he gives her a "titty twister."  Since my “nice mom” approach hasn’t worked, I told her that I would think about it.  I may allow her to hit him (not too hard), and I’m wondering what you think?  And what should I say to my son?      Thanks!

My 10-year-old son and 12-year-old daughter like to rough-house from time to time.  It's never very rough, but my son will occasionally give his sister a “titty twister.”  I know that he doesn’t do it with the intent to hurt her; he just thinks he's teasing her.  I’ve lectured him and have taken away privileges, and I’ve tried to convey to him that a girl's breasts are very sensitive, like his testicles.      Fed up, my daughter asked me today if she can give him a taste of his own medicine (and a lesson in sensitivity).  She wants to hit him in the testicles the next time he gives her a "titty twister."  Since my “nice mom” approach hasn’t worked, I told her that I would think about it.  I may allow her to hit him (not too hard), and I’m wondering what you think?  And what should I say to my son?      Thanks!

20090309125042AAkUf7G	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Pregnant or not, I need help, should I continue to take my bc.?	So, last month I switched bc methods from the ring to the pill.  I did forget the pill a couple of times, at night, but I took it in the morning so I was only late taking it.  My period started on the second day of my "reminder pills," feb 28 but it was really light and lasted for less than 2 days.  My period is usually really heavy and at least 5 days.  I took a HPT on the 6th, and it was neg.  I am having some light cramping, but other than that no other pregnancy symptoms.  Youre not supposed to take bc if ur pregnant.  Should I continue to take my bc, or quit? I don't want to hurt the baby if I am pregnant.

20090309124036AA3hS7n	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	I don't want to include my abusive late husband's name in my childs name, his family's upset.  Help!?	My late husband was abusive but I'm against divorce so we were separated.  We were trying to reconcile after he got some help, hence the fact that I'm pregnant.  He became abusive again and sometime after I left he was involved in a drunk driving accident that eventually caused his death.  I'm thinking on the name Taylor Jackson (my middle name and my father's name) but my late husband's family thinks the child should be named after his father.  How do I explain to them that, although I'm sorry he's dead, I don't feel the need to "include his memory" because there wasn't much good attached to it?

It's a 10 hour flight with a 5 hour stop-over and I will be 28 weeks travelling with my husband and a 2yr-old.      My concern is that 1: flight leaves at 6pm and our daughter doesn't go to bed till around 10pm usually so that's 4 hours of entertaining we must do just there.   2: she usually doesn't sleep anywhere but in her crib so I have no idea how we will manage to put her to sleep on the plane.   3: the 5 hour stop over will be at around 3am our time so for the baby that will be the middle of the night. Apparently we have to check in the stroller so I'm wondering how I will get about with a sleeping baby while my husband takes care of the carry-ons and the lap-top bags without a stroller.      Anyone have any ideas for entertaining a toddler on board, putting them to sleep and dealing with a 5hr stop-over in the middle of the night?      Anything will be appreciated. Thanks!

20090309125644AAx7sFC	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	I need help as soon as possible please?	My Mom has been in the hospital for the past two months. We found out she has 3 very dangerous brain tumors. They were inoperable because they touched too many important parts of her brain. They were very bad for a while, she lost use of her left arm (she has feeling in it but can't move it) and can barley move her left leg(she can't stand or sit or get up on her own). They started chemo and radiation with her, then she got worse again. They say she is doing a little better now, so they are going to try to send her home this weekend.      Do you have any suggestions on ways we can make the house more accessible? She will be either in a wheelchair or a hospital bed so she won't be able to go upstairs. We did build a ramp this past weekend so at least she will be able to get into the house now.      Also do you have any suggestions or tips or stories of people that have been through something like this already?       I just want to have as much information as possible, so please if you have anything at all related to this please let me know. I'm scared of what's going to happen and I don't know what to expect. So please tell me anything you know.      Thank you.

My oldest child acts like this sometimes but he has ADHD and is 10 years old so I can beat his butt if needed.       So how do I handle the baby acting like this, I think it's an early sign of her having ADHD like my son but they won't diagnose it till they are around 4 years old. My son acted like this when he was little but not nearly as bad?

20090309131515AAWiCsa	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	My 9 month old gags on chunky food... any suggestions?	My 9 month old son has been eating cereal since 5 months old and baby food since 6 months old.   He gags on chunk foods however (like the baby food 8 months and up). He gags and chokes on baby cookies, soft cooked veggies, etc.   He also has no teeth but people have told me that has nothing to do with it considering baby's get front teeth first and don't use them to chew anyways.   I try different soft foods all the time that other babies his age and even younger are eating but it doesn't help. He just gags and sometimes chokes.   I know all babies will eventually get the hang of it but Im afraid if he doesn't learn soon he won't learn how to chew!   Any suggestions? Any parents in my situation with the chewing and eating?   Thanks in advance!

20090309125451AAl5nUt	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Women Trying to conceive....?	I am trying to conceive now, and It has been really hard. I have been trying for about 7 months. It took me a while to get pregnant with my first child, and now that we are wanting our second, we have found it really difficult.      A friend of mines little sister is 15 years old and got pregnant her first time having sex....      Im wondering if it is just me, or if any of you get discouraged and a little jealous if you hear of a teenage girl 14, 15, 16 years old, unmarried having a baby after like 2 months of knowing a guy, when you yourself (who are married with a stable home environment in which to bring a child) have been trying yourself for 6 months to a year with no results.

His parents have decided they're going to head to a beach for a few days.  Naturally my son wants to go.      But I've got work.  I can't go with him.  I don't know if I should let him go anyway or not.  He's eight, and of course can get into trouble.  I do know these parents but I'm still hesitant.

Has anyone had to deal with their baby taking food into their mouth and then spraying it everywhere? He just started doing this 2 days ago. I'm not even sure if he actually eats any of it. He thinks it is hilarious, me not so much. Does anyone have any tips on getting him to stop, or do i just have to wait it out?

20090309130640AAwvpIy	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I HAVE BEEN SO STRESSED OUT THROUGH MY PREGNANCY....WHAT SHOULD I DO?	Ok. So I am 17yrs old and 6 and a half months pregnant with my first child! I have been stressed out since the day i found out I was pregnant...The father of the baby is black and is 20 yrs. old....thats where the majority of the stress comes from. He doesnt understand what I go through and how I feel even when I tell him in so many ways. He constantly complains about my attitude and anger....which I can admit can get out of hand sometimes....but Hello IM PREGNANT! (I have never felt this way in my whole life). He says I use being pregnant as an excuse. I really want him to be in the babies life....I cant imagine my baby being with out a father...but he really has nothing going for his life. He thinks he is smater than me and knows more than me just because he is older than me but has nothing to show for it. I got my GED back in 2007, I have my own car and license, I am currently am on the merge to get my own place....As for him he has none of the above...I really love him and want the best for him.....we have been together for 2 yrs. He has changed a lot since I met him but it seems like ever since he found out I was pregnant things have been getting worse. He says he wants me to think about his feelings and show him love if I want the same in return....but I do and he denys every thing I do or say...I just dont want to be alone and stressed out anymore because I want to have a healthy baby. IS THIS A STAGE THAT SOME FATHERS GO THROUGH WHEN THEY HAVE A BABY ON THE WAY?? WILL THINGS CHANGE ONCE I HAVE THE BABY?? WHAT SHOULD I DO???(That is only half the story)
