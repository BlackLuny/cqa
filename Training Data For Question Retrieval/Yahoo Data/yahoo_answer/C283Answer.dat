BZJGNFymaa	Be courteous wherever you are!  On the road, make room to allow others to change lanes during high-traffic.  At restaurants, even fast food joints, be patient and polite with your server.  Smile at people on the street.  Open doors for others.  Offer to help if you see someone carrying a heavy load.<br>  <br>  Little things like that can brighten someone's day and remind everyone involved that people CAN be good to strangers.|`|S4W7FojCaa	For me, if I get a compliment, I will have a smile for the rest of the day. Usually people don't talk to me, so when someone says something nice to me, that makes my day. When someone gives me a gift, no matter how small or cheap, that makes me happy. It's the thought that counts.|`|6DtFiA45aa	Help them if they are strugling. I don't know...|`|ppKQEhEMaa	Yesterday an elderly lady was in the supermarket trying to carry an 8kg bag of dog food..she was clearly struggling and about 4 men walked past and didnt even offer help. so i asked if I could carry it for her..went and got her a trolley and then pushed it to the register for her.<br>  <br>  <br>  You should put in some good words to a manager about someone who gives you good service next time you get served or something...that always makes peoples day better when they get told they are doing a good job instead of people complaining.|`|Q2xeHOVSaa	thank your mum & dad and tell them how much you love them<br>  give a kiss to your boyfriend  to show your love<br>  get a surprise gift for your best friend<br>  give someone a nice compliment<br>  smile :)<br>  <br>  happiness doesn't come from big things! it's always around us, we just fail to enjoy it!|`|Y63Q4bnOaa	Something as simple as holding the door open for someone, can make someone's day better!

Didn't realise that could happen very difficult.|`|9Gsx32Skaa	you can pay for somebodys morning coffee. Thats always appreciated. Or tell a woman she is beautiful, triple points if you say it to an elderly lady. I once told an elderly lady at a coffee shop she was looking especially marvelous that morning, she was so happy she said she hasnt heard that in a long time and i made her day.

1PdUecpYaa	pisces and taurus is a good match, but she's already dating someone else. you wouldn't steal someone else's girlfriend, would you? that's just wrong. i know how you feel. i fell in love with a sagittarius guy and even went out on a date with him and later he told me he wasn't single... as much as i love to be with him, i had to let him go... <br>  you can try to be friends... stick around until she's single again... that's what i'm doing...|`|bvwYVGJOaa	Good match but unlikely to win your arguements as Pisces are known for sensitivity. Taurus aren't but you cannot come into a existing relationship and take her away from her Scorpio man like that. i think you need to wait or move on. <br>  <br>  I'm sure you both are a better pair but you don't be lead on or lead her on too.|`|ubHFGHwaaa	dont believe in horoscopes.<br>  <br>  am i messed up?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ai2sXcIYgnvepvHEjLirtursy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090223011126AA0T94X">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|mko359wNaa	I shouldn't base relationship compatibility based on when your respective parents had sex.

91463f09508d15c5de519cf8f3b91843aa	Whats happening to Jade Goody at the moment happens to mothers across the world every day...they don't have cameras following their every move and don't have the floods of money coming in for their children's future... Nothing against Jade AT ALL...I pray that God Bless' her final days with her children...I just hope and pray that those last days ARE spent with those two beautiful boys and not spent seeing how much money she can leave them...Money isn't everything... it's not saving her!!!! <br>  <br>  May her final days be peaceful, joyful and filled with love|`|jl5q6sZpaa	Not really. Anybody's death is a personal and family tragedy, but most people know someone who has gone through a similar ordeal. <br>  I have sympathy for her as an individual, but no more than anyone in the same position.  I can see why she is going back through the media circus as it will give a legacy for her children. I sympathise with her actions, but not the idiots revelling in it. <br>  <br>  Most of my bile is aimed at the media, though. It's not news and definitely shouldn't be leading news broadcasts, as it was at the weekend.<br>  <br>  I'm afraid that the term 'Celebrity' is becoming a contradiction in itself.|`|wsCBo2Zkaa	I feel really dorry for her as she has changed her life around since the whole CBB thing. I've always liked Jade, she is my ultiamate fave to come out of BB an no one will ever be as big as her to come out of BB. I really hope she is around for a long time to come tho its not very hopeful. I'm glad she finally got to marry Jack before she died. She deserves to be happy in her final days. Lisa Michelle x x lol x x|`|speJXeIhaa	I feel so sorry for her,she's so young.But then i feel for anyone whose going through what she is.Every cancer sufferer deserves our thoughts- i watched both my parents die of cancer- i know what it's like.However Jade is for some reason doing this very publicly but she has raised cancer awareness.I hope her last weeks are happy and relatively pain free.|`|0587266e7766c192927b521e361ff69aaa	well im not exactly a fan of her or like her. but i do feel sorry for her and i cant bear to see someone dying of cancer and leaving their children without their mum. its just really sad.<br>  <br>  edit: and also there are some real mean people that are criticising her, i heard one saying she deserves to die, thats just not right.|`|x5GH9A9Gaa	Never been a fan of her …. Never will be …. Having said that I don’t wish anyone to go through what she is going through and with that in mind I hope she gets the most out of the remaining life she has. Peace.|`|khnMoQNoaa	i don't like to see anyone die of cancer its horrible and very sad<br>  but i think she should do it in private or at least not look for so much publicity for it|`|AA11528369	she was always a battler but this battle looks too big to beat|`|kyiUpgrwaa	i feel very sorry for Jade and her 2 boys i mean she has made mistakes especially the whole thing with shilpa shetty but nothing do deserve what she is now going through.<br>  <br>  as for selling photos of her wedding and living tv following her with the cameras i understand why she is doing it, all the money she gets is for her kid's future.<br>  <br>  and the amount of young women getting smear tests have went up by 20% so even though she is dying she is doing some good by the fact that young women now realise the risk of not going for regular smears so by making her suffering so public she is possibly saving lives by getting more people to go for tests.|`|xiYcUd1Yaa	She was never a favourite of mine but the courage she has displayed is amazing. Its one thing knowing you are going to die in a few weeks but a whole other level knowing your kids will lose their mum. I know that would be the hardest part of it for me.<br>  Also think its ridic that people are slagging her off for selling her story/wedding pics etc!! All she is doing is trying to get as much money in the bank for her kids futures, any decent parent would do the same & it will give her a little more peace of mind where they are concerned.<br>  <br>  Phew, i'm written an essay! xx|`|zqyk1VdAaa	She's dying of cancer so why does she NEED all this publicity? I'm sick of hearing about it to ne honest. If I was her I would spend my last days with my family and friends<br>  <br>  I never thought she deserved all that money! (I'm not saying she deserved to die) What did she do? Cover herself in oil so she could get a better tan, make racist comments to Shilpa Shetty and get ALL that MONEY!!!<br>  <br>  I do feel a bit sorry for her though...|`|KSSSYk5aaa	Bottom line is that i feel sorry for her.<br>  <br>  The media made her what she is and the public hate her for it.<br>  <br>  There are some aspects of the whole circus surrounding her at the minute i don't agree with.|`|c9NuCZnaaa	to be quite honest, and i know it sounds harsh...but i really couldn't care any less. from day one she's done my head in. She needs to spend more time with her family and less in the media.|`|iBH7NTl3aa	I think her braveness is an inspiration to all! Its not our job to judge anybody! live and let live!|`|e07c5b2ff539e607c47b3a47d0f956a8aa	god bless her, and may the last moments of her life be wonderful|`|u7vrul2Faa	I know she has offended a lot of people with her big mouth, but I really feel for her, she does not deserve this death sentence that has been given to her.|`|lkNJNnlSaa	She is still a human being and deserves the respect and sympathy you would give anybody else in her position.<br>  <br>  I still think she is a racist, ignorant, insolent idiot.|`|ce7ea7f83a5ba171eb4ef78c629b25a3aa	I never liked her as a person but as a mother myself I would never wish her illness on anyone and I think it is just so sad and I really feel for her and her children right now cos to be honest she is a good mum and now those poor kids are going to be left with her no good husband and even worse her mother|`|Up6ANLQeaa	I always liked her! She's gobby and thick but damn! She's entertaining! I feel really sorry for her now,and can't even imagine what she must be going through....|`|YcGNL9y1aa	I think she is a brave lady.  Plus the fact she has provided for her children when she has gone.|`|PPyMhRJAaa	I do feel sorry for her, but think she should spend her last moments with her family and not in the media spotlight.
NQFV2AdZaa	I love the books that she wrote and always thought that she was very talented, she wouldn't have made over ￡500 million if she was rubbish!|`|wmBK9uASaa	A writter of good stories though she can be rather loathsome at times|`|lFd6zCgxaa	I LOVE her books.<br>  *shakes you*<br>  What is wrong with you?<br>  Her literature is excellent, and everything is linked and follows through so well.<br>  I love Harry Potter so much. <br>  I'll read it over and over and over and over and over again ...|`|9ADVLFOnaa	Well she's written a whole series of books that millions of people rave about, it's made her a household name, made her millions, plus you have the films and she's encouraged lots of children to pick up a book instead of a computer game and done a lot for charity, so her writing can't be that bad.<br>  I have no reason to hate her and Iike the Harry Potter books, so does my son :)|`|8ZxdLiaJaa	LOVER HER!<br>  even though i didn't read all the books. but she's good and her stories are great :D|`|uJskRjP7aa	Love her|`|qsuYKa3naa	My feeling for her isn't that intense but I respect her 'talent'.|`|Q2xeHOVSaa	I love her! For me, she's the best! I've never actually felt for the characters of any book! She takes me to the world of magic- Harry and Hogwarts! I laugh with them, cry with them... Hermione is so close to my heart, as if she's my best friend! I've read the books so many times, but it's as thrilling and exciting as it was in my first read! Harry Potter is a versatile character and will remain in our hearts for more than a century..<br>  JKR is a MASTERMIND!!!|`|dCMi5rjdaa	wow<br>  <br>  can they really be that boring<br>  I have yet to read them<br>  <br>  have seen all movies put out tho,<br>  <br>  and thought they were incredibly done<br>  <br>  Isn't it funny-usually the book is WAY<br>  better than the movie..<br>  <br>  guess I'll have to do some reading<br>  this week<br>  <br>  (must be why it's called 'reading week')<br>  <br>  :):)|`|1Z13L9h2aa	It's not how she writes that I love, but how her imaginative mind made up those characters that will be alive in the hearts and minds of readers even centuries from now. ;)|`|HnccCVlVaa	I have never read harry potter before.The movies were ok.Not the best.My friends started reading it and all of them said the books were really boring.|`|FAr8ALwQaa	indifferent, harry potter was ok but when i read it i was too young to really notice the writing|`|4d2a746b2c406b888ee53ccce2cd95e0aa	never read her books really. am i like the only one? i tried reading the frist harry pothead but didn't find it too cool...|`|eKDYbe9Laa	ya realy love her|`|gLqX7TG0aa	don't know her|`|hdTiNngHaa	no words can express how amazing her imagination is and her writing style is more than wonderful..she takes u to a dream world..come one she is the best writer everr..i have all the books in 3 languages and i ll never stop reading them over and over and over again!! i love harry potter ana harmoine charachters alooooooooooooot. wow!|`|Wuo6qYQMaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeYOdgwByLc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeYOdgwBy...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Harry Potter in 5 seconds<br>  <br>  <br>  ROFLCOPTER right there.|`|6XeXxZ3maa	No reasons to love or hate her.

cLZFexxzaa	Yes in some ways. <br>  <br>  There are many other movies that were better than Slumdog that were made by Indians.  Like Lagaan, and Salaam Bombay.  Slumdog is a feelgood and predictable movie, and that is what made people like it.  It was a good movie, but there were some other good movies that it didn't pass up completely.  Slumdog Millionaire was a great movie, and it had some great cinematic moments, but there were other great movies that deserved Oscar appreciation.  Like The Dark Knight, or Wall E, the only two great movies that people actually heard of, only one 2 and 1 awards each.|`|o3jbPkPRaa	it could be a good movie i havent really watched it but i think it is so very over rated i dont think it could win all those category it just seems imposible i.e. low budget, best underscore, best editing. bec in theory this category cost a lot of money right or am i wrong. maybe winning one catergory you could get away with it but several i dont think so. just my thought anyway|`|fTabbkpnaa	Overrated? Absolutely. It's the type of film that will be completely forgotten in a few months from now.

So are both my parents but they split after 20 years.|`|AA11937656	No, it's not wierd for two Taurus' to be in love.   I once saw two Accords in love, and I have also seen two Camry's in love.|`|QGBYOLIxaa	I'm a Taurus April 30th, it really all depends. At least you would always understand each other, but honestly there's a high chance it might not work out. I have dated 2 Tauruses and it didn't work for long. We are too stubborn. Two taurus together at some point want their ideas to come first, and then there will be the fight about who's idea to go with. Then there is also the habit to over indulge, you will find each other spoiling each other till you might even put on some extra pounds. But then again, if your natal charts or Eastern signs (Chinese Zodiac) are compatible then it just might work. ^_^ I hope this helped.|`|UI6vdCrWaa	no its not weird at all <br>  i had a bf that was born on same day same year and month <br>  a real coincidence :)<br>  <br>  yeh but we lasted for awhile <br>  i dont really  think starsigns a really that important i think the person himself is more important<br>  <br>  go for it hun!|`|4zVi6gvgaa	No. It works fine. Horoscopes don't exist. Don't base what you think of someone on what time of year they were born.

I mean Brenda is nice but they dont seem right as a couple to me for some reason. Maybe its mainly because neither one of them like each other like that but like I said I dont know.

Leda2ha0aa	I have seen both Housewives versions and some of these women are way over the top.  I really don't care for the shows flaunting how much money is spent on gifts, yachts, cars, houses.  We don't need to know this information, they're just flaunting it.<br>  <br>  Many of these women are catty and downright nasty, but there are a few good girls in the bunches.  I like NYC's version because of where they live.  On the OC version, there's way too much plastic surgery and injections going on over there.  It's entertaining to watch when there's nothing else on the tube.|`|GtazNrplaa	Sorry darling.  I haven't seen this show but have watched the Desperate Housewives which I think is just another Hollywood plot on life for some which to me is Meh.|`|12Nou1pvaa	i have to agree, im not feeling the New York Housewives, pretty lame, and not good looking, more mature i think.

kPMxo2MCaa	The Academy Awards was definitely a hit and miss affair. Every time the oscars hit the right note with a montage or guest presenter (mainly Ben Stiller, Will Smith and Jack Black), it then got tedious. The ups and downs in quality were very noticeable. <br>  <br>  For example what the heck went wrong with montage where we remember the people that passed away? It looked like the camera man either was falling asleep or someone just discovered a camera. It left us watching it with wrong angles, and annoying zoom shots.<br>  <br>  In regard to the awards, I think every  winner was well deserved.|`|PRG7OiTJaa	a waste of tv space|`|BkatcMZbaa	The Oscars Show was seen by us in the East on Mon 23/2/09 from 9am to 1 pm while yours was 22/2/09, Sun .....at around the same time of Night & Day with 0ne hour different...... LIVE telecast.<br>  <br>  This show was the BEST in comparison to the last 3 years (Cutting out the details naming).  The new style of presentation in FIVE and the singing & dancing of top artists in a sector are great.  <br>  The personalised talk of winners in waiting with a new setting and the clear sectionalisation give the concentration of feeling & wholesome of each subject matter.   The afford to explain how & what is done in the production is educational for each topic of award. The sector with the full Orchestra on Stage for the first time is impressive.<br>  <br>  Generally, every viewer around the world will learn & know more of something out of it and I am taking it as a great show of USA, like The Slumdog, a great show of India and the Beijing Olympics a Fantastic Show of China.  All are great achievements, one from each country, a great attraction to the World.|`|AA12394465	It was above my expectations the host was not greatest but manage to keep a balance trough the show. there were really funny pairs presenting awards such a Ben Stiller  and Natalie Portman , as well as Steve Martin and Tina fay , but the whole best performers awards presented by 5 previous winners was a bit tiring. As far as the awards itself i was please with the selections and happily surprised by some of then , and slumdog 8 awards made me jump with joy just the same way Boyle did .|`|DOkWTB8baa	I honestly don't remember watching last year's Oscars. <br>  <br>  But this year, Hugh Jackman as host was a great choice.<br>  The opening was great :)<br>  <br>  Ben Stiller - deff had me laughing. My friend didn't understand why he was doing that, so I had to explain to her :)<br>  <br>  I also loved how that told us how a movie was made, and that's how they presented the awards.<br>  <br>  Heath's win made me cry. His family accepting the award was very touching.<br>  <br>  Sean Penn cracked me up :) But his performance was amazing. <br>  <br>  Yeah, I kind of figured Maher would mention his documentary, and go overboard maybe a little, but what can you expect? <br>  <br>  I really enjoyed watching it this year :)|`|6e6fb50d87f07492879715e4526ac64daa	the oscar awards show is nothing but a self congratulating ego fest where  a bunch of hollywood hotshots bus themselves in on their private jets and limos then lecture us about how we need to cut down on energy use to stop global warming. <br>  <br>  they wear designer clothing and jewelry that costs more than the average working man makes a year while they binge on caviar and sip dom perignon and then lecture us of the starving kids in africa.<br>  <br>  every damned "acceptance speech" turns into a political rant about how evil america is or how stupid christians are or how gays should marry or some other liberal BS.<br>  <br>  and i'm pretty sure i'd lose my belly if i had to hear every damned one of them ready to line up and bob obama's knob. <br>  <br>  these spoiled hollywood brats pat each other on the back for making millions to work a whole 3 months remember lines and reading a script while underpaid civil servants like police officers, firefighters, and our military personnel who lay their lives on the line to protect us don't even get a nod. <br>  <br>  and let's face it, the movie that wins the oscar is the one that sings the liberal praises the loudest. <br>  <br>  no thanks. you can have it.|`|PM0wir1Saa	Despite all the promised "surprises," I thought the Oscars this year were basically just as boring as ever. <br>  <br>  Pros:<br>  -Heath Ledger's tribute was done extremely well.<br>  -Ben Stiller was very funny with his Joaquin Phoenix shtick.<br>  -I loved Jack Black during the Best Animated Feature presentation: "I take all the money I make from Dreamworks and I bet it on Pixar."<br>  -Slumdog MIllionaire taking home Best Picture, as well as seven other awards.<br>  -Phillipe (spelling-?) Petit accepting the Best Documentary Oscar and balancing the award on his chin.<br>  <br>  Cons:<br>  -Hugh Jackman was alright, but his style is more suited for the Tonys.<br>  -A LOT of bad jokes tonight.<br>  -That tribute to musicals felt forced, awkward, and just plain random. "The musical is back"? Uh, yeah, it's been back for about eight years now.<br>  -Endless tributes to the acting categories. Come on, tell us who won already!<br>  -Jessical Biel, whilst addressing Ed Catmull: "You've probably never heard of him..." Catmull, are you going to take that sitting down?<br>  -Those genre montages that mixed Space Chimps with Wall-E, Twilight with Slumdog Millionaire, Zohan/Love Guru with Tropic Thunder, etc. Clearly, action was the best thing Hollywood had to offer us this year. What, no Burn After Reading in the comedy montage?<br>  -That 2009 montage at the end of the program, promising us such anticipated hits as Sherlock Holmes, HP 6, and... G-Force. Yippee.<br>  <br>  Yeah, not much to praise this year. I'm seriously thinking of starting a campaign for Ricky Gervais as Oscar host '10.
spo9KBRpaa	depends on what the situation is...<br>  if someone cheated on you..<br>  then i would be easier to hate than forgive.<br>  <br>  but if someone poked you...<br>  then i would be easier to say<br>  oh well.. i forgive you.|`|j6RbKNmjaa	To hate..|`|2xaVpnNNaa	easy to hate, just like its easy to gain weight<br>  <br>  its hard to forgive....because that would mean you would have to let go of a wrong they did to you.|`|8j70Neqeaa	have to hate, before you can forgive|`|Co9I2OMSaa	It's easier to hate but it's better to forgive|`|Zgs4RncIaa	I hate no one, strongly dislike a few.

Yes, i feel some times i get so many deletion notices, perhaps someone is censoring my comments, not the moderators, but within the community here.<br>  But, we must remember:<br>  When a member makes another a contact, you get all their Q's emailed to you, then you answer the ones you like to, want to.  That may seem like stalking, but do you think the term you are using is reasonable?  <br>  Stalking has some really negative connotations, it suggests foul intent, an act of depravity, which it often is, indeed, yet it can also be the innocent actions of a dysfunctional person, and pose little real threat.. So how can that be applicable here?  <br>  If you left a trail which might be followed, and someone did follow it, would you not be better advised to forfeit the trail making, despite all, and ensure adequate security?  I think paranoia is unhealthy, but reasonable steps to protect yourself are wise.<br>  Y/A recommends you always consider the "trail" you leave, and minimise the possibility of breaching your own security.|`|nXxb89LIaa	Yes I had a couple of stalkers but a few people seem to come on only to answer my questions for the most part which is an honor. :)|`|jZr6TqZRaa	Nope.

e63CjxWlaa	All the main characters begin the movie being defined by their social group. Dialogue is the main thread of connection that binds the characters. As they converse during detention, the clich'e walls come down and they discover that, irrespective of where they've come  from and what they've done, they have more in common with each other than they care to think.<br>  <br>  In respect to belonging/not belonging. Almost every character, belongs in some clich'e. The only character who does not belong is Bender, who instigates the majority of dialogue in the film, and acts as a bridge by which all the characters in detention come  together.  In this act of bringing the group together in a pseudo-friendship  Bender finds his belonging, and each character finds a redemption in some way that leads them to question wether or not they really want to go back inside the walls of their clich'es.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|kGdiGxJqaa	<a href="http://getinfo.knows.it" rel="nofollow">http://getinfo.knows.it</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website|`|QmOmbprOaa	I JUST ENJOY THE MOVIE I DON`T CARE ABOUT THE SMALL STUFF.

NY4ectQcaa	After the seventh season, which wrapped up in May 2000, the show was over. For whatever reason, nowadays it seems nearly impossible to find it on any TV channel in the USA, but all practically all the episodes can be found on youtube.com using the "Boy Meets World" episode guide on wikipedia. The first three seasons have been released, and you can get them at fairly good prices at eBay.com. As for seasons 4 through 7, that will be up to Lionsgate (who bought rights to "Boy Meets World" in August 2008).|`|0g2fDpUbaa	He got too old.

dIzVwFMsaa	YOU SAID IT. IF THIS WAS DIRECTED BY ANY INDIAN , THEN THE CHANCES OF GETTING NOMINATED IS VERY VERY LESS. MR. DANNY BOYLE HAS DONE A WONDERFUL JOB, AND THE WHOLE WORLD IS NOW LOOKING AT INDIA. AND NO WORDS TO EXPLAIN THE FEELINGS THAT  A R RAHMAN AND RESUL POOKKUTTY MADE US PROUD.|`|TuGkVqwraa	I dont think Indian Directors have done this kind of thinking.<br>  <br>  A. R. Rehman really shines.|`|3890f326e072192e79ea3f718551dfb8aa	It's difficult to answer because if it has been a Bollywood production it certainly would have been a different movie and it may not have been released in the US. In fact, had Danny Boyle not been attached, Dev Patel would not have been the lead actor.<br>  <br>  Danny Boyle being attached gave an American studio a reason to pickup the film and release it. I don't know if an Indian director would have made the film more or less authentic, but I certainly don't think it would have gone on to gross over $100 million in the US (which it should pass in the next couple days).|`|6HyIkR7Caa	No i don't think if the film was made  by a Bolywoood director, it will get so many Oscars. Other good Bollywood films are no less than Slumdog Millionaire. I saw the movie and i liked but i liked Upcoming movies like Barah Aana more. Barah Aana is more Authentic than Slumdog millionaire. The casting was incredible and It's a must see for movie lovers. Read the reviews here <a href="http://barah-aana-the-film.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://barah-aana-the-film.blogspot.com/</a>|`|aYVVwjBXaa	i think if it had been made by a bollywood director it might have had a chance at winning best foreign film, but i don't think it would've won best picture. bollywood films are so very different from what the mainstream american wants to see, and it wouldn't have been nearly so popular.|`|4715b1b2168ae801a0d235d545847f26aa	So, i think every movie should be made by partnering with hollywood star. Take either director or actor from hollywood (and rest all from hindi film industry) and bang on it. We will win an oscar every year!|`|s3erV38gaa	No..they could'nt have done it as well as Danny|`|RPixbIwdaa	Well if any bollywood director wou;d have directed this film it wouldn't have even entered the nominations.<br>  Ofcourse music was excellent no denying that .|`|k9RrgQy9aa	Difficult to answer...

SHNIlE9Uaa	A person himself makes his life. Not some stupid zodiac sign. Check the zodiac sign of Abraham Lincoln and you will get it.|`|OCzss4xJaa	Point one : All Leos are not the same. <br>  Point two : You need to learn moon sign, ascendant and other planetary aspects. Only sun sign cannot tell your features completely and accurately.<br>  Point three : There must be a zillion leos in this world and if every person has the same qualities, that's like a fantasy. You'd have zillion like-personalities. <br>  <br>  I agree with one half, but its not complete nonsense either.|`|FuR0RpCfaa	Maybe you were born premature or were meant to be born a different time or maybe you are on the cusp of two signs and just don't know it. Go with your strengths, make a list of what you are good at and expand on those. Not everything is an exact science so to speak. <br>  <br>  I am happily married to a Leo and I would not have it any other way. I am a virgo btw. From what I have heard they tend to not get along easily but we are the happiest married couple we know and everyone says it. Be proud!|`|28TJbbNHaa	Because if you're stubborn and your zodiac sign says that you're stubborn, you will be too stubborn to admit that you're stubborn.<br>  <br>  If you're arrogant and your zodiac sign says that you're arrogant, you will be too arrogant to admit that you're arrogant.<br>  <br>  and the list goes on ... j/k|`|AA11868913	as much as i love astrology, it really doesn't have much to do with people's personality's. haha|`|XZ9yP4Jkaa	because it's all effing crap|`|plBXp91Daa	What is your star sign?|`|sPDOMTTjaa	Well, seeing as that you don't tell us your 'sign', it's going to be hard to say. However, I would be willing to bet that one of the traits associated with your sign is that you are very skeptical & closed minded. <br>  <br>  A lot of people get angry when they read the traits of their zodiac sign for a couple of reasons- <br>  -- #1- they realize that the traits are extremely accurate & describe them to a T, they don't like this discovery because they've put down astrology & the like for years, and they sure ain't gonna admit to being wrong now!<br>  <br>  -- #2-- they are somewhat open to astrology, but however, upon reading their signs negative traits, they become outraged because this type of person lives in denial, is a bit narcissistic in that they don't want others to know that they have negative qualities, and they also like to blame others for there problems. So, basically they can't handle the truth. <br>  <br>  -- Both types described above often take their frustration & anger out on those who do believe in astrology. They will 'pick on', harass, 'make fun of', etc. those who are open to astrology. This makes them feel better about themselves. Instead of dealing with their own issues, or admitting that they have negative qualities, they handle it by trying to belittle others. They are in hopes that by trying to make astrology look bad & like a lie, that they will make others believe the same way as they do; therefore hiding their little secret; a bit of 'scapegoating' if you will. Of course, y'all probably know this as this is psychology 101. <br>  <br>  -- Hope this helps!|`|7p3TCz3qaa	I'll tell about your sun sign and you tell me if you still think you are nothing like it! Leos are warm,generous,lively,sweet natured people with hearts of gold and nerves of steel.They're full of fun,soft as butter,sweet as honey and as sharp as lemons.Leos can take anything the world throws at them - anything except advice that is.Offering advice to a Leo is pointless,because they hate to admit they got something wrong or that they can't cope.They like to walk tall and show the world that they have endless self confidence,which is why they often give the impression that they are totally in love with themselves.It's unfair to say that they are arrogant or vain,it's more accurate to say they are proud with a capital P.Leos are lost without Dignity,and if it wasn't for their pride and stubborness,Leos would be perfect.A Leo with a point to prove is a living example of determination,willpower and sheer bloody mindedness,and these qualities are every bit as good as they are bad.When you need someone to stand up for you,when there's plain speaking to be done,when it's necessary to be steadfast and resolute a Leo on your side is the most valuable asset you can have.Leos are loyal they are larger than life and they're also rather lazy,just like their counterparts in the jungle who sleep for up to 20 hours out of 24,the zodiac lion likes to move at a gentle pace.So Leos can be lazy,they can be stubborn but most of all they are proud,it's no accident that a group of lions are called a "pride".Despite their faults Leos are still wonderful people.Leos are ruled by the brightest star in the sky-the Sun- and every Leo potentially is a shining star.There's something very attractive and pleasurable about being in the company of a Leo. So be Proud!|`|4VNFsmanaa	Because there is more to a person than just the sun sign. To get a more accurate look, you need to get a birth chart done. Trust me, it will be extremely more accurate.|`|SdpWsTlQaa	check your sources. and were you born on a cusp? try a progression chart. they are alot more personal.|`|bvwYVGJOaa	probably to do with other planets or moon signs

Jk1AWYXiaa	Its not so much the money cost as the time you will have to spend!if you put in enough practice, you dont need as many lessons as teachers make you believe...<br>  especially, if you are not planning on become a pro, you can get away with buying a few dvd's on learning how to play... then spending time on it..<br>  I find that all lessons really do is show you the right technique,, after that lessons are really just "guided practice" ie they watch you as you practice and tell you if you hit a wrong note etc.<br>  <br>  Lessons are roughly about ￡20-25 per hour lesson.. i dont know what that is any other currency<br>  <br>  Good luck and enjoy your playing!!|`|zfrPmiFtaa	I don't have an exact number, but it would be rather expensive. I was taking guitar lessons but we had to stop them because we were kind of short on money. That was almost a year ago, and I'm going to start them again soon. Every place is going to have different prices, including for other instruments. So you might want to see if you can learn one or even two by yourself. Maybe you could find out if you know anyone that knows how to play one of those already. <br>  ~Good Luck|`|BfKKNqo3aa	the price is going to vary depending on your location and the skill level of the teacher, if i was you i would buy a dvd or something which teaches you on a computer or something so you know the basics and the notes then you should be able to teach your self, that would be best for piano and possibly guitar but for drums try and get lessons. try searching for lessons in your area and go from there =]

f606wARSaa	maybe thats what they may be lacking|`|73Iasdntaa	I don't know,but I can only speak for myself.<br>  I think it might be because we wanna show that we are able to take care of ourselves!<br>  You automatically get more respect when you earn your own money,<br>  it doesn't have to be a big time job,it's about the effort and that you care for yourself!<br>  <br>  When you care for yourself,you automatically become more attractive!<br>  I would say,nothing is more sexy than a brain!<br>  When you are a "go getter" and have a goal,the rest should fall into places by itself.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I think men sing about love more,because they know that women love romance etc.<br>  I'm pretty sure men enjoy being romanced just as much as we do,<br>  men are just not too well at expressing their emotions,but for that to say DOES NOT mean that they don't have feelings as well!<br>  <br>  Whenever you can relate to a song and or an artist,you have accomplished what you should want!<br>  <br>  MORE RECORDS WILL BE SOLD etc.<br>  IT'S ALL ABOUT REACHING YOUR AUDIENCE!

The show didn't go much over 3 hours, so it's likely you'll be able to find the parts you missed on YouTube in a day or two.

ed1fd474ffe907b183e2991c2f9b248daa	Not sure what  you mean - but Cancerians are thought to be home bods, don't like to go out too much, prefer to stay home|`|cuIX13BKaa	The people I know that have a deep seemingly unfounded fear of small confined places are Libra, Gemini & Pisces.<br>  There is not hard and fast rule as to shy this is so...it just is. The Libra I am thinking about is a geologist and this really gets in his way as caves is where he does a lot of his work....Yes I too am scratching my head at this one. The Geminis I speak of have a dreaded fear of elevators and refuse to take them...even if it means climbing 14 flights of stairs! Pisces is always afraid that a confined area such as an elevator or a plane will combust.....I don't laugh at them....any of them....for I have my own flaws....but after you have known someone for 20 years...the problem is surely NOT going to go away.<br>  <br>  Garbo|`|PCAlAoDsaa	Aquarius because they are not very sociable, they do not like to go out too much and they prefer to stay at home.|`|SdpWsTlQaa	I would say virgo. They like to be in control of their own space and to be organized. They tend to be timmid or even hypochondriacs. Very self aware, versus a sagittarius, who have no issues getting their hands dirty and stepping out of the comfort zone. Virgos like routine and Sagittarius like adventure.|`|ucMoxS4laa	i dont know im sorry.. but Im sagittarius and Im the biggest claustrophob ever!! I just hate small spaces and can also feel very suffocated in a relationship.. even if i have loads of freedom.lol dunno what brought it on or why... but small space is evil! hah|`|sPDOMTTjaa	Pisces; probably because they are extremely artistic & free minded & the thought of any kind of 'closed space' makes them very uncomfortable.

AA11111233	Having seen some of his footage on YouTube, I would say that he needs to get some class, and learn to talk a little more assertively to his guests.

Wonder what is said to guests (and for that matter, the audience)? Perhaps all are told there are police in the audience, and if the apes (bouncers) cannot deal with a rowdy family, the police'll take over. It would be interesting to learn how many episodes were too harsh to show.

In 1997, Life is Beautiful was nominated for Best Picture and Best Foreign Language picture. <br>  <br>  But in order for an Indian movie to get nominated, it would have to be released in the US during the eligibility period and it would have to gain popularity among Academy voters by the time that ballots are cast. In order for it to be eligible for the Foreign Language category, it would have to be submitted as India's official selection and then be picked by the Academy as one of the eligible films.<br>  <br>  To the best of my knowledge, the only true Bollywood picture to gain any substantial following in the US was Monsoon Wedding.|`|6HyIkR7Caa	It's because of over publicity and hyped.

All these three have the common element of showing somewhere in them, the living in poverty or with disability or in bad conditions.-May be these are what the Oscar audience like to see or the image of India in their mind.<br>  Another short documentary Born in Brothels (2004) based on sex workers in Sonagachi red-light area of Kolkatta and Gandhi(1982) got the Oscars.|`|AA12397532	You are mixing up your questions<br>  Film like mangal pandey or anyother indian films so far have t compete in FOREIGN FILMS CATEGORY only, in which the whole flm making world competes.<br>  OSCAR is open only for the members of ACADEMY OF MOTIONPICTURE ARTS AND SCIENCES. Indian film producers cannot be members of the Academy. However, NRI's like Ashok Amrithraj, Late Ismail mercant, Deepa mehta, Meera Nair are members and can compete for the main event. Films produced by Indian or any other country are eligible only for foreign category.<br>  This holds god, irrespective of where the film has been shot.

Yes, even the technicians of these films have to be members of the Recognised association of the Academy. like a cameraman has to be a member of ASC or SSC or CSC (American/British/Canadian Cinematographers Asociation) and a screenplay writer of the respective association.<br>  Indian technicians are members of the technical associations approved by IMPPA IIndian Motion Picture producers Association), hence not eligible to work as he main technician there. <br>  So comparison between SlumDog and other flmscaot be done. yes SlumDog can be compared to Monsoon Wedding or Meera Nair's earlier films.|`|x0uuxxzUaa	No its not! slumdog is a nice film but definitely not the best. there have been better Indian films.|`|xv0ovZ63aa	Slumdog Millionaire is not a Hindi movie. I wonder how many people I've said this to. Just because it had some Hindi in it does not mean it is an Indian movie. Clearly it was produced under a Hollywood name. If it was an Indian film, it would have been nominated for "best foreign film." =)|`|v6V11CYCaa	Strongly Nooo.......................,<br>  <br>  Because  oscar is only for Hollywood movies. Simply its Americans National award. So there is no need for Indian Actors like KamalHasan,Amir Kahn,Mohanlal,Vikram to get Oscar. They are Already proved actrors in india. <br>  To get Globel attention we can consider Oscar,for that these actors must act in Hollywood movies.then only they can get oscar very easily.|`|44L5fGWLaa	Slumdog defenitely deserves Oscar. Because it's a memorable movie. But there is many indian movies better than Slumdog. Taare Zameen Par, lagan, Ghajini are examples. But foreigners does't see these movies. What can we do?|`|ePt4qPxNaa	Umm... that's a british movie... <br>  <br>  But still, the best movie of 2008!|`|SKW8awPsaa	no|`|pj1iApN1aa	ya.i think so<br>  i am agree of ur view there r many good movies which have to win oscars <br>  but the r not nominated because r mainly americans awards there people select the movies which has to be nominated so there is very litle hpe for bollywood movies to win oscars. but they can win the forig film award|`|Z9WBVWhqaa	SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE IS NOT AN INDIAN MOVIE!!!!!<br>  It is a british movie...its british idea...<br>  If it was a Bollywood movie i don't think it would even get nominated.<br>  I like indian movies but Hollywood movies are way better.....|`|DwyE4Qvvaa	YES.........<br>  Definately its the best movie of the year. It has awsome music and excellent theme that no other movie has this year.
a2cMxkD8aa	One year ago, when I was fourteen and a half. Started watching Sailor Moon, and I've seen a few animes after that, but I read a lot more manga than watch anime.|`|wdxUb3moaa	I was 12........ eeep that was a while ago *tears*<br>  First serious was DBZ and Escaflowne.|`|sj3HJ5jZaa	i become one at age 13|`|TaMnAi8caa	if you mean literally start watching anime i'd say 7, coz i watched pokemon and yugioh :D<br>  <br>  but if you mean become a fan and watched animes other than pokemon and fangirled over them, i'd say 13.|`|7a2efb9a491bf91f2d2a622649572fdfaa	i first watched gundam wing i guess around 2001 or so which means i was about 17 or 18...shortly after i branched out into other anime and have been addicted ever since!|`|WS1rqp0Gaa	At age of 7.I started watching Pokemon.|`|y2svhaXmaa	I started around the age of 10. It was DBZ that got me into Anime. :)|`|tMY4iTlVaa	Well I watched anime without realizing it for quite a while in elementary school. They used to play Sailor Moon in the early mornings, along with DBZ and pokemon on Sats. And my brother was obsessed with it, so I'd end up watching a few things (Vampire Hunter D, Project A-ko, Vampire Princess Miyu, etc) with him but it never really sank in with me.<br>  <br>  Then I was officially introduced to it by a friend in late middle school. First manga I ever read was Fushigi Yuugi. From then on, that was it.|`|yg493xNkaa	I was around seven or eight- I watched Pokemon and DBZ, then my brother got me watching Gundam Seed when it first came out (can't remember when that was) and I was hooked.

tuATxHsVaa	The Evah Pirazzi are much more bright and brilliant than the Obligatos. Obligatos are not necessarily good for solo work... the Evah Pirazzi can stand up to more bow pressure. The Obligatos might give you more of this warmth that you seek, though. I highly recommend that you try the Obligatos, if you simply must try a new string from this company.<br>  <br>  I don't recommend Violino that much. They have a sweet tone and they will "tame" loud violins... but they tend only to work best on extremely bright instruments. They were marketed as student strings because they were specifically designed to help make el-cheapo violins sound better. If your violin is extremely cheap (less than $700, I guess) then it might be worth a try.<br>  <br>  Most people that try Obligatos agree that they do give a rich, gut-like sound. I wanted to add that they are great for orchestral work. A lot of people agree that they are the closest synthetic string to gut. <br>  <br>  You should definitely try the Obligatos next. I have of course tried all of these strings (not Tonica, though - more on that later), and I can assure you that they are more worth your time than the Violino; however, I have to say that every string is different on every violin. I am merely saying that the odds are much higher for you to be happy with Obligato than Violino. <br>  <br>  Tonicas are a similar string to the ones I use - Dr. Thomastik's Dominants. I don't use the Dominant E string. I use a Jarger Forte E. <br>  <br>  If you haven't tried Dominants then I suggest you try Tonica (if neither Obligatos nor Evah Pirazzi are doing it for you). Dominants are much easier to bow than these other strings.  Getting some Dominants in the future might be a good idea. I absolutely love them. Never use the E string.|`|kbFty6eVaa	Definitely Obligato
3890f326e072192e79ea3f718551dfb8aa	What I would recommend at this point is not trying to argue with your parents over what your future career will or won't be. But, you could try to make a deal with them them to let you participate in a community theatre as long as your grades don't slip. If you live near a big city, maybe you can even convince them to let you audition for a local talent agency to do commercials or something. <br>  <br>  If all else fails, you can try the argument that having extra curricular activities is essential for admission to a good college and that theatrical training could help you as a trial lawyer.<br>  <br>  Once you're old enough to start making your own decisions about your life, you can choose to pursue acting if you still have the passion for it. Just be warned that you may do so at the risk of losing your parent's support.|`|b9wICW1Paa	You really can't do much about your parent's wishes for your future at this time.  They raised you and probably take care of most, if not all, of your living expenses.  So until you become independent, you will just need to make some compromises.<br>  <br>  You should prepare for both the possibility of an acting and a legal career.  You don't need to be a trial lawyer in order to be involved in the legal system.  There are paralegals, court reporters, legal assistants, and a multitude of other careers available for you within the legal system.  Learn about them and I'm sure you would benefit and be able to please your parents at the same time.  And who's to say that preparing for a legal career couldn't help your acting career?  At least if acting doesn't pan out, as your parents probably are assuming, you will have an alternative career to fall back on.<br>  <br>  Take advantage of all the acting opportunities you can while you are young.  Volunteer for community theater, perform in plays at your school or church, even consider volunteering as a character actor at any local historical villages or Renaissance Fairs.  <br>  <br>  If you want to be an actor, then that's great, but remember you will need to work very, very hard and much of it for little or no pay in the beginning.  You must meet as many people as you can in the hopes of connecting with someone in the film or theater industry.  Be very diligent and something will happen.|`|YsDwo7Dqaa	The best and only thing to do is tell your parents you DO NOT want to be a lawer, Tell them they can not make you live there lives becasue if they try you will prob end up being rebelious. Really sit them down and talk to them about it, or wait until you are 18 and then do it with out the permission.<br>  <br>  Parents need to know that they shouldn't make you live the life they want you to live, you are an individual and must make your own choices in like.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and really tell them how you feel that is my best advice.|`|9Ni21lHpaa	How about you sit down and talk with them,since ure only 13,how about u ask them to schedule u doing both??Like do well in school and stuff or take extra lessons in whatever they want u to take IF they let u take acting lessons on the side....??That way you can tell them  you have 2 options always open to you.Not every child actor ends up  being a grownup actor,so you could always go to law school aswell :)|`|PKs0I8f7aa	Can you take theater classes at school? It might make your parents happy... extracirricular activies look really good on college applications. The good news is you have time to be an actress. I think your goals may be a little too high. But just have some fun with it for awhile. If they see you are having a good time, they might back off in the future.|`|JHPHlKenaa	disregard them
jfOSVSQkaa	I've impregnated 2 women and they are both single moms now.

Boy, were my lips sore and chapped, lol.  I also published a cook book, sold over 400 copies and donated $2.00 of every sale to the American Cancer Society.  I also participated in a walk marathon for Juvenile Diabetes and raised over $500.00.

z10vSLxgaa	when it comes to guitar choice's it boils down to personal preference.  most of the time a guitar with humbuckers such as a les paul would sound better for heavier music.  les pauls have that universal sound that many guitarist love.  zakk from black label society uses a custom les paul, b.b. king has his infamous "lucille", and tom from blink/ava has a custom.

A Rose, by any other name, is still a Rose.)<br>  <br>  If your prayer list is still open, I sure could use a little help.  My GrandTwins aren't doing too well.  I will be flying to Tampa with my daughter, for fetal surgery, within the week.  If successful, she will be on complete bed rest, to hopefully postpone delivery.  The trip will be very last minute, so if I disappear for a bit, you know where I'm at---completely stressed out in Florida.  But I will find you all when I get home, whether it be under Rose or Davida.  Thanx, Guys.

The problem is called Twin to Twin Transfusion Syndrome.  Time is of the essence, in determining which procedure to perform--reducing amniotic fluid or laser fetal surgery to seal off blood vessels from the placenta.  We will know Thursday.  If successful, they tell us that they are hoping the pregnancy will continue til' at least mid May.  We have decided, if bed rest is necessary, that she will stay with me.  Her, and hubby, live almost an hour away.  So, this would be easier for all of us.|`|AA10561941	Good Morning for Huntsville, AL<br>  <br>  Before They Were Famous: b) Ballet <br>  Champions: a) guerdon <br>  Conde Nast Portfolio Magazine Trivia: Barney Frank has got your number<br>  Games 'n eCards Trivia: You win<br>  Music Trivia: a) O.A.R. <br>  country)b<br>  This Day In U.S History: c) 42 <br>  Video of the Day: Kathy Bates<br>  You Can Quote Me: a) Mark Twain <br>  sleuth - follow<br>  <br>  90's at nine - Gin<br>  Point Word of the Day - Winner<br>  <br>  It's Cold 21 today|`|HSt3y5yWaa	WWYZ Country 92.5<br>  Normal trivia copy and paste abc<br>  Games &eCards -You win or you<br>  Video of the Day-Kathy Bates or ba<br>  Sleuth-Follow or fol<br>  Conde Nast magazine-Convicts and congressmsn or ma<br>  Best Net Freebies-Gevalia or gev<br>  Bosh and Cory-Jack or j<br>  Town of the Day-Bridgeport or b<br>  Kat's Station-Ebony Clay or e<br>  Kat's Lunch-Green or g<br>  Wendy's Station-Tatarian Honeysuckle or t<br>  Wendy's Drivetime-blueberry or b<br>  Dave's Station-Hello or h<br>  Dave's Nighttime-Money or m<br>  2 surveys Restaurants and your money<br>  Mohegan Sun shops of the day-Puma enter under contests or keyword shops

So, what did you do with the diaper?<br>  <br>  Why don't you slip into something more comfortable...like a coma.<br>  <br>  You started at the bottom...and it's been downhill ever since!<br>  <br>  I heard that you were a Ladykiller.

Well You should see that telephone pole out there.  Now that's what I call being stuck up!    Was a line we used on the crowd we had back when I went to school a long long time ago.  The girls were so snobbish and hung up on themselves.  Thought they were so much better then everybody else.  I came up with that line because in my little group of smarty nerdy girls I was the leader.  We got a few laughs out of it, even from the snobs.|`|s8K1xEGiaa	With calls like that you must be the most comedic and articulate person on the globe!
qpHouLORaa	Hi, I am excited about Hannah Montana the Movie as well as you are.<br>  But I have also seen it on the Internet now. Here is a Hannah Montana movie trailer with a link to watch the whole movie online. This movie was for screener purposes only so you will have to be quick. Just go to www.hannahmontanamovietrailer.co.cc and then follow the instructions. I was really impressed!|`|DOkWTB8baa	imdb says 'April 10' - to be released in America. <br>  <br>  I don't know about the premiere though.|`|4KCaSuAlaa	who cares?
tafxHE7Maa	I think the 1st, 2nd and 3rd... Well,ALL of them basically! lol But if I had to choose I think it would be the 1st. Because it had Leigh Whannell and a good ending. Good writing,too. =)|`|jxPr6dd4aa	the 2nd and 1st are the only Saws i like, they are clever story lines with a Gory drama building up. In a way the saw series reminds me of American pie, American pie was good when it started but it became worse and aworse and now its pointless. <br>  <br>  The original saw is the best, then the second. The rest arent worth it =/ there is nothing clever about trying to make people sick with gore.|`|RPixbIwdaa	FIRST 1 definitely.<br>  The ending is SUPERB + the attitude he has in him when he gets up.<br>  Its mind blowing.<br>  Others weren't upto the mark.|`|DOkWTB8baa	My favorite would be probably the first, because its the original one. Originals are always the best :)|`|WkPFahdLaa	The first one. Everyone after that is predictable non creative crap.|`|Yc6eUIW9aa	Never have watched any of them.  They are sick movies.  The director must be a real wack job.

G3ahqvmqaa	yes and yes<br>  his wifes name is Emelia
6PSnZDhDaa	1. Yea he got back with Kotonoha, reasons are three... <br>     a. He was sick of everyone ignoring him and turned to the only girl who still showed care.<br>     b. He felt sorry for how she had waited for him despite is illtreatment.<br>     c. He simply didn't wanna handle the burden of a commitment and a baby.<br>  <br>  2. Well in this whole series, the one at fault is Makoto himself. He played so many girls and in the end had the guts to kiss Kotonoha in front of Sekai, without regards for her emotions. So obviously the prick deserved to be punished, though killing was too much... But it is also Sekai's own fault for tempting him [offerin herself for his practice] while playing the go between for him and Kotonoha.. It was absolutely slutty of her.. <br>    Killing Kotonoha wouldn't solve anythin, Makoto would only hate her and take off for her beastly act.. So she had to kill him... <br>    Anyway I hate this series... It is by far the worse I've watched.. The character animation were just too cute and cartoonish for such an intense psychological thriller... It didn't suit the puffed up, innocent faces...

gDs87Nchaa	Firefox. I was an Internet Explorer user till I discovered what I was missing.<br>  <br>  Firefox is much faster for me and the add-ons available, well lets just say theirs lots of them. It has also been proven that Internet Explorer has more security flaws than Firefox.<br>  <br>  I remember when Internet Explorer 7 came out and people where bragging about the tabs, oh it's an amazing feature and bla. My friend also went on about it. And I was like it's been in Firefox for years.<br>  <br>  I think Microsoft are kind of trying to change their game now though. I mean I always found they waited too long to bring stuff out. Look at the gap between Internet Explorer 6 and 7 - By the time they bring tabs out Firefox has something new which Internet Explorer will steal for the next version. <br>  <br>  I also found too much change between IE 6 and 7, instead of a gradual change.

80II1Wv1aa	Academy Awards ARE the Oscars. The Oscars are the trophies you get.<br>  The Academy Awards (Oscars) are movie awards<br>  Grammys are music awards.|`|OxS3UVE6aa	The Academy Awards, popularly known as the Oscars, are presented annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS)[1] to recognize excellence of professionals in the film industry, including directors, actors, and writers.<br>  <br>  The official name of the Oscar statuette is the Academy Award of Merit.

CL5kLE2paa	the man can't lose seeing as it won't be a long marriage|`|3qLIRorjaa	I don't doubt he loves Jade, however, i don't think his reasons were quite as genuine as they should have been.|`|lkNJNnlSaa	Abit of Both.|`|U3qTwOOIaa	I think it was 'expected' of him.  Let's be honest would we normally advise a 21 year old man to get married?  What for?  He still is very young and loves the 'single' life.  There has been talk of marriage from Jade for the past 2 years yet he never proposed.  I would hate to be in a position where my on/off partner (which is what he is) only proposed if he knew I was dying|`|8OoqHpbIaa	Well Jade had made it clear all Seven hundred thousand pounds from the wedding at least will go directly to her children<br>  <br>  he wont have the children Jeff brazier there dad will and jack was with Jade before she got ill im sure he loves her|`|aGwjf2y4aa	def money and to be kept in the limelight he must love her but hes so inmature i dont know what she sees in him no doubt jade will have all her finances in place for her boys so he prob wont get much anyways but still alot more before he married i bet eh!!!!|`|G8zAPz8Maa	He has his face in the trough as well|`|376a0b518236d45e27355ee9bd22da43aa	well come on would he look at Jade twice if it was not for the fact of her money.<br>  im sure he has feelings for her but love im not sure but come on who now really gets married for love, i think most get wed coz they fear being on their own and a lot more stay together coz the thought of being on their own is so cold.<br>  what about Wayne Rooney's wife would she love him if he was a roofer from liverpool ?<br>  would she of forgave him for his brothel antics if he had been a warehouse man?<br>  sorry but money can dazzle some folk|`|433165e2c7b432dcd07898d64f6f19c8aa	I don't know to be honest.

Qfxqka5naa	Cara Ninja :<br>  Sou de Guarulhos e cinema por aqui só em Shopping. O pre?o é de R$ 14,00, com meia para estudantes e 10,00 na quarta-feira. Acho até que razoável levando-se em conta que normalmente assistimos bom espetáculos já que, com as críticas diversificadas e sinopses, escolhemos a qualidade do que queremos ver, em uma sala de poltronas confortáveis, ar condicionado e seguran?a. Pior é você pagar R$ 15,00 em uma arquibancada no Pacaembú, sentar no cimento, tomar chuva ou sol, aguentar cheiro de maconha o tempo todo, copada d'agua ou mijo na cabe?a, brigas e estupidez, escutar bobagens o tempo todo e ainda, na maioria das vezes ver um péssimo espetáculo desses pernas-de-pau já que, todo jogadorzinho mais ou menos está fora daqui! Só sendo corinthiano muito fanático pra saber de tudo isso e trocar o cinema pelo Pacaembú!

A64Qr7DMaa	half hour ago wen u went to bed misty, ill be up soon to give you a good cuddle, ok 143xxx|`|ylYvDca9aa	Nice question. Last night. My husband waited for me to come to bed just so he could hold me. We are going through a tough time right now because I just gave birth to our son on September 8. He is still in the NICU since birth and has had 2 seizures. I have been blaming myself because I have seizures also and had to continue to take medication during pregnancy. Even though I know I couldn't do anything about it, I just can't help but think that it wouldn't happened if I hadn't had epilepsy in the first place.

It doesn't host any of the files, the users do. So an unsigned band could host their own songs onto Limewire if they wanted to and you would be downloading a legal file because it would have no copyright.<br>  <br>  However if you download any song that you should be paying for, songs that you can buy on stores both in a shop or online, you would be downloading illegal material.<br>  <br>  So to answer your question. You can't. You can download uncopyrighted material for free yes, but if you wanted lets say Pinks new song, you would have to buy it if you wanted to remain "legal."<br>  <br>  Edit - I would avoid sites like MP3Lingo that a user has mentioned. There are lots of sites out there that charge for p2p software, just the software. The problem is, your paying for the software and not the songs. For example LimeWire Pro costs, but it doesn't mean you can download un-copyrighted stuff from it.|`|inST4SlAaa	limewire.com<br>  <br>  you are sharing files|`|3oBeCBzMaa	Well there isn't really a reliable source for free music downloads and it is illegal since the Artist won't get paid for their work.  The best, and cheapest way to get music downloads is through MP3Lingo.com.  They offer unlimited music downloads for only a few bucks a month.

tJqG2q9uaa	start by humming scales on a piano/keyboard.  ive pasted a link to youtube in sources - she has a whole stack of exercises linked. humming rather than singing places your voice in the right space in your head to sound good *sounds strange but trust me - humming helps you not go flat*. After youve hummed start doing 'ah' to the scales - this will help you to get familiar with the notes so that you you'll hit them more accurately. You need to breathe through your diaphragm - breathing is everything! its the power behind an amazing voice. type in singing breathing exercises on  youtube and heaps come up. you can tell you're breathing right if you are not lifting your shoulders but instead your tummy fills with air *place your hands on the lower half of your stomach as you breathe in* - ask any singer, this is the key to awesome singing.|`|o9i7xxgqaa	Well do the 'sh' exercise.<br>  Say sh as if your telling someone to shush, but to it louder and stronger but don't hurt your throat "SSHHH"<br>  Open your mouth as wide as possible and make a yawning sound (you will look stupid)<br>  <br>  Say the letter 'C' and hold it, start low and keep saying it, getting higher and higher.<br>  <br>  Got a keyboard?

NR4hbYPiaa	Unlikely|`|dSmoB64Yaa	I think his performance was great. He re-created the Joker, as very memorable character, who will eventually be elevated to a very high cult status.Nobody ever turned the Joker into something quite so new and different. Ledger turned him into something absolutely diabolical and still very darkly comical. In terms of bad guys, I'd say he nearly reached the level of Sir Anthony Hopkins as Hanibal Lecter.  He's would be on many people's "top five villains of all time" list. I've been around for quite a while and I've seen a lot of movies and Ledger's Joker is certainly on my top ten list of movie bad guys|`|4472d6c8b8a41746c6129264601312c7aa	I totally agree with you. I feel like he already 'had it in the pocket' when he was nominated. I'm not trying to be disrespectful but I feel like when a celebrity dies, all of a sudden they're so much bigger than they used to be when they were alive. Again, not being disrespectful, Heath was an awesome actor.|`|3890f326e072192e79ea3f718551dfb8aa	I think he would have still been nominated. The only other performance from 2008 that stands out as a Supporting Actor contender was Ralph Fiennes in The Duchess. But I think Ledger would have still been nominated. <br>  <br>  Winning might have been more difficult. Josh Brolin was pretty good in Milk, and I think he could have won if Heath was still alive.|`|zovrJ0yXaa	he would probably have been nominated but he probably wouldnt have won. the fact the dark knight had practically zero nominations goes to show how heavily it was snubbed. even tho his performance and the film itself was probably the best of the year|`|o0CrpEyfaa	I have to agree with you too.  He may have been nominated, but i dont think he would have won.  I also think Josh Brolin should have gotten it.|`|AA11746639	Yes, I think he would. He was the real Joker as the Joker in BatMan is. While watching Dark Knight I have never been aware of Heath Ledger in the movie, on the other hand, when I saw Batman, I can hear myself saying that was Christian Bale! That 's the difference .<br>  The oscar is not only for "good guys in the movies", Just remember Danzel Washing playing a dirty cop in Training Days. He won an oscar too.|`|vhgued1naa	Yes, of course he would have, not any actor would've been able to perform like he did, it was as if he was born to play him. maybe he did get an oscar because he passed away, because afterall we are still humans. but anyway he got it for the acting not the other reason.|`|ofXlyT2Gaa	wouldnt even have been nominated...it wouldve gone to robert downey jr

HZxX9ke8aa	Psychiatrist Dr. Mitchell E. Gibson, M.D., did a study of more than 400 astrological birth charts and through the use of scientific statistical research models, discovered a new technique for predicting mental illness. He discovered that the average person's birth chart contains about three marker aspects of depression. The birth chart of someone with major depression contains an average of ten such markers. Even with no previous astrological experience, a person can spot the indicators for mental illness through the declinations and multiple planet aspects that form the basis of this pioneering work. All of the patients were diagnosed according to the DSM-IV, the gold standard of psychiatric diagnostic criteria. The diagnostic groups represented include major depression, anxiety, addictive disorder, schizophrenia, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. His study is documented in his book <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1567183026/" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1...</a><br>  <br>  ----<br>  who is Dr. Mitchell E. Gibson, M.D. ?<br>  <br>  The author is one of the most well known and highly respected medial doctors in the state of Arizona, where he maintains a successful private practice in psychiatry. Dr. Gibson is a Diplomate of the American Board of Psychiatry & Neurology, the American Board of Forensic Medicine, and the American College of Forensic Examiners. Formerly, he was chief of staff at East Valley Camelback Hospital, as well as chief resident in psychiatry at the Albert Einstein Medical Center in Philadelphia.<br>  <br>  check it out.|`|3WItFAwlaa	Yes.  Gibson's study is fascinating.  The book is a bit dry but worth the effort.  <br>  <br>  There was an article on this topic in The Mountain Astrologer several years ago.  You could search for it on their website.  The author might have been Liz Green.   Maybe not though.  It was awhile ago.|`|Jr5YZ8Qbaa	Astrology is out there with homeopathy and phrenology. Neurology is a medical science. Even if people born at different times of the year have different rates of depression, this is because of varying diets and sunshine levels etc during pregnancy, nothing to do with the positions of the stars or planets.|`|UAW1U3Uoaa	I would hope our Scientists have better things to research such as cures for Cancer than to waste time on nonsense like this|`|Kmo2lufgaa	i cant believe its not butter|`|dd7de1dd375fcb6afffc282f17c117c6aa	Hello Aya,<br>  Other than Dr. Gibson's book on his research between mental illness and Astrology which is all based on clinical symptoms rather than biological and physiological data, I have not seen any such thing you have mentioned.  In the field of medical science, Astrology is still viewed with a lot of skepticism and those who believe and openly try to discuss their beliefs are met with a lot of resistance and often ridicule.

AA12273993	I think it is a good show because it is dramatic and you are never sure what is really happening, its not a predictable show, one day they can be dead and the next there perfectly fine. I also like the characters because they are never simply good or evil, they have there reasons for acting the way they do, oh and the gadgets are aswell.|`|3GPyXYiNaa	Yes! It is very Dramatic. I love that intense feeling. Like you just want to know what's gonna happen next. But then a commercial comes on and that makes me pissed.
cd58585213d00e68cd209294ecc6a3d7aa	Surely you want the 17 17 to make the sweep easier? <br>  <br>  Play both 17s with your pinkie, and it's a piss easy sweep. Second finger on the 15 and index on the 14 - that's how I would do it.|`|N3yfqA3waa	That's why they not it on the 17th, because it is a much easier note when attempting to rake all the notes.<br>  <br>  Bass chords and arpeggios can be tough because of limited amount of strings and  long fret lengths.|`|tY3YxMKIaa	Well, the two 17's on E & A are definately the easiest way to play the arpeggio, however I would personally play the 17 on E with my pinky, the 17 on A with my ring finger, the 15 on D with my middle finger, and the 14 on G with my index finger.<br>  The two on 17 could both be played barred with the pinky, but it would be easier to accidentally mute the D string with the pinky since you have to lay it lower to hit both the E & A strings.

Válido como curiosidade: o filme foi dirigido e roteirizado por uma mulher, Nancy Meyers, que já dirigiu, produziu e roteirizou vários outros filmes. Mas, n?o gostei muito do final, deixou um pouco a desejar, mas como o resto é realmente excelente, está valendo. No mais, um filme perfeito para uma tarde de chuva, para quem realmente gosta do gênero, mas n?o dá para exigir demais do filme, e tem que se prender à proposta dele. O título original é The Holiday, o título traduzido n?o tem muito a ver com o original, mas eu achei que ficou legal. E concordo que, Cameron Diaz, Kate Winslet, Jack Black e Jude Law formam um quarteto perfeito, eu já previa que gostaria deles juntos, mas eu teria mudado um pouquinho o final do filme, sabe?<br>  <br>  Falou!|`|42007d12acda7393df778126002a1dcfaa	ASSISTI  SIM MANINHA 3 VEZES E EH BOM MESMO ENGRA?ADO E O MAIS IMPORTANTE E Q DEIXA UMA MENSAGEM DE AMOR..........PARA QUEM NAO ASSISTIU EU TAMBEM RECOMENDO BJ|`|MGQ7hsTLaa	nunca assisti mas obrigada pela recomenda??o.|`|WU4HoJrTaa	é o melhor filme de comédia romantica desse ano!!!|`|lAdTADphaa	olha eu gostaria mto de ter assistido...<br>  quer uma dica?<br>  procura na internet pra ver se acha uma sinopse do filme!!!<br>  quem sabe vc gosta e loca na locadora?<br>  Bju**|`|3STjbJ04aa	Assisti....<br>  Uma ótima comédia romantica!!!!

WVMpwYQtaa	Well... I guess that only few know the big secret of LOST, You are really asking a huge question, because Lost has as many secrets as episodes... I really think that the upcoming Season Finale will be great but most likely it wont reveal any secret, maybe the oposite.<br>  A good Website to dig into this serie is <a href="http://www.lostpedia.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.lostpedia.com</a> I realy think you should visit this website to at least know what everyone else does. Meaning More questions and secrets. <br>  But you will find, Theories of what the answers may be... Of course there are other websites of LOST, but I think that this one is the most serious and reliable.<br>  I know that I didn't answer your question, but As I said before... Huge Question, dude.|`|AA11461480	i wish i knew

I like the song myself but it's all about taste. It also depends on the mood you're in as well as how the song is being used. By being used I mean like in a movie or commercial and so on.

Sharpay resolve aproveitar as férias para conquistar Troy (Zac Efron), apresentando-o para pessoas influentes, conseguindo uma bolsa de estudos para a universidade de Albuquerque e trazendo jogadores de basquete universitários para praticar com ele.

47UZoc4vaa	Oh, heck yeah.  My main thing isn't so much the spelling and grammer.  It's the rude people who insult other's, or try to get away with posting adult content when they know kid's can read it. We all know a 10 year old can mark that they are 13 and get away with it and use Y!A.

QjIhIFnPaa	I LOVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE PARIS!<br>  <br>  Truly love her & have so for years.<br>  <br>  Its so hard being a Paris fan isn't it.<br>  So many jealous people, haha.<br>  <br>  I have had an obsession with her for years, and just about 2months ago i got the pleasure of meeting her.<br>  <br>  She is an absolute sweetheart.<br>  And has the time for anyone who askes her questions, for autographs, photos. Shes just darling.<br>  <br>  And all her haters are as i said JEALOUS. lol<br>  <br>  Who wouldn't wanna be rich, beautiful and famous.<br>  She's living the life so many people want. So to cover that up, they just complain about her. Pick on anything little thing she does. I mean theres been so many celebrities who have made pornos, seriously, but because PARIS made one, shes just a silly blonde tart. LoL.<br>  <br>  Ahh anyway, have a good day and remember, don't ever let anyone tell you otherwise about Paris, if you love her, then do so! I'm with you there!|`|xGmhDTWwaa	You don't know her either so you're obviously also judging before knowing her.<br>  <br>  I think when the people that know her have sl*gged her off then it's not a good sign. I don't like her but don't hate her. She seems too fake and just acts nice, sweet and dumb cos it sells but inreality she's brash and horrid.<br>  <br>  I remember reading an interview where a singer had been in a club, Paris just stood up and started dancing on the table whilst the singer and her friends were trying to enjoy themselves. They asked her a bunch of times before getting her down when Paris chucked a drink over her called her a f***ing b*tch. Paris is just to full of herself and thinks she's above people. The world does not revolve around her.|`|22HpFLCmaa	No offence but how can you like her? The whole image she has made for herself is obviously for publicity. She isn't talented at anything. I mean, I know judging someone you don't know is bad, but you're doing it too? You like her! That's a judgement! For Pete's sake!|`|cOkUsbleaa	Personally I dont like Paris Hilton she is spoilt and calls everyone she knows names.She is a major whore too.............making porn to get money she is just like totally disgusting!|`|URZeQfQCaa	I think she is amusing, but couldn't stand her personality on a day to day basis.|`|cdgm85A6aa	Her family.

And the body to die for , plus she is loaded what more can a bloke ask for.|`|8OoqHpbIaa	She is a skeleton with a few strands of Fake hair!<br>  <br>  <br>  She is too old to be acting like a dumb blonde she needs to grow up like Nicole|`|HlHB7dfHaa	Well, she flashed her vagina for all to see including me and my 5 year old sister. and we do not even now her.|`|f6OOxJQsaa	She's a tramp.|`|1LlGtiO5aa	She seems fine to me.  It must be hard having your life in the public eye all the time.  Personally I don't think she is that bright, but she seems like a nice person.  I don't know her personally so I can't say.  But she seems like a nice girl.|`|sbmzMVLraa	Hi<br>  <br>  I know people judge other people quickly that they don't even get to know them properly as I think Paris Hilton is cool, pretty, funny and a nice person unlike other celebrities.|`|SxgOy9uPaa	Not that i know..Think she is a total waste of space..She has trouble spelling & talking as well..You & her should get on real well..|`|cwJrCcguaa	I think she is a nice looking girl.|`|uXbl1Zbhaa	No.|`|HEQc83d9aa	Why do you know her? or do you just read about her?|`|0TMOzqX7aa	no|`|xeW6Mvbdaa	You are well suited...she can't spell, either... :-/
j3ntYzssaa	Ok here comes a large load of info. Get Ready!!<br>  <br>  Ash Catches a Pokémon <br>  Ash, willing to continue his journey alone, is followed by Misty. Upon noticing her pursuing him in Viridian Forest, Ash puts her on the spot and asks her, "Why are you still following me?". Misty sweatdrops and unconvincingly stutters back, "M...My bike! I'm holding you responsible for my bike!" in an insincere manner. <br>  Why she is following him is made apparent near the end of the episode where she says, "I've never known anyone like him. He really does love Pokémon." She does so in body language befitting that of an infatuated girl. Also, in her statement, it is pretty much implied that she has some sort of interest in knowing Ash, who, at this point, is someone she barely knows. Furthermore, in this and the next episode, Misty seems very eager to make physical (if not courtly) contact with Ash. <br>  <br>  The Water Flowers of Cerulean City <br>  When Misty tells Daisy that she's back home because of Ash, Daisy thinks that Ash and Misty are a couple, which cause Misty to blush. <br>  <br>  The School of Hard Knocks <br>  In this episode, when Ash and Brock fall in love with Giselle, Misty gets mad. Some say that she was jealous because of Ash, but others say that was because of Brock. <br>  <br>  The Tower of Terror <br>  In the episode, when Misty thought that Ash had died, she is driven to almost tears, but is interrupted by Ash who comes back to life and wipes her nose and blushes. <br>  <br>  Pokémon Fashion Flash <br>  In this episode, when they see the ad for the salon, Misty grabs Ash's arm. <br>  <br>  Poké Ball Peril <br>  Near the end of the episode, with Brock having left Ash and Misty to travel alone, James says "I think we may have captured a pair of romantic creatures in our little cage," after which Jessie swoons and Meowth blurts out, "They're lovebirds!" The idea of Ash and Misty as a couple becomes a sub-theme throughout the subsequent Orange League Season, culminating into events in the 2nd movie. Ash and Misty deny it all. <br>  <br>  Navel Maneuvers <br>  Danny, the Navel Island Gym Leader, quickly picks up on the nature of Ash and Misty's relationship during one of their arguments and says, "I can see the two of you are pretty close." After Misty asks what he meant by that, he replied, "What's that saying? 'You always hurt the one you love'..." <br>  <br>  Wherefore Art Thou, Pokémon <br>  After the Nidoran kiss and evolve, Tracey comments about whether the battle or the kiss made them evolve. The idea of kissing embarrasses Misty and provokes Ash to ask the question, "Do people change when they get kissed?" after which Misty answers to him, "Guess we'll have to find out ourselves..." Earlier in the episode, Tracey compared the interaction between the Nidoran's trainers to the relationship between Misty and Ash (although both vehemently deny it). <br>  <br>  Get Along, Little Pokémon! <br>  Misty yells, "BE CAREFUL ASH!" before he goes to save the Magnemite. Misty has done this on many occasions. <br>  <br>  Misty Meets Her Match <br>  This entire episode alone serves as conclusive evidence that Misty not only likes Ash but possibly has developed a case of young love for him. Rudy, the Trovita Island Gym Leader, has a case of "love at first sight" with Misty after she saves his sister Mahri. After several advances from Rudy, Misty agrees to what is essentially an impromptu date with Rudy, leaving Ash and Tracey to themselves. <br>  According to accounts of the original Japanese version, during the dance after the date, Rudy not only asked Misty to stay on the island, but to marry him. What is significant here is that Misty was actually considering his proposal, evidenced by the fact that she didn't refuse him outright. Throughout Ash's gym battle with Rudy, Misty is clearly torn between deciding which boy meant more to her, finally rooting for Ash in the end as Squirtle is hit by a Thunderbolt from Rudy's Starmie. Rudy, in shock mutters, "She wants him." <br>  The fact that Ash started losing during this battle is probably because of his stress of Rudy liking Misty, but is then inspired by Misty's advice. <br>  <br>  The Stun Spore Detour <br>  Every time that Tracey and Ash need attention Misty comes to Ash first or expresses more concern for Ash. <br>   <br>  Misty's jealous expressionThe Power of One <br>  P2K, otherwise known as 'The Power of One', or 'Revelation Lugia' is the conclusion to everything related to Misty's love for Ash in the Orange Season. In this movie, Misty gets competition in the form of Melody, the Festival Maiden of the Legend Ceremony. Melody, upon greeting our heroes, immediately comes up to Ash and plants a kiss on his cheek, provoking a glare of jealousy from Misty. Also, after Melody's performance at the festival party, she quickly kneels in front of Ash and grabs hold of his arm, provoking Misty to gasp and growl again in subdued jealousy. <br>  Also, upon being called Ash's girlfriend, Misty blushes uncontrollably. <br>  Near the end, Misty openly admits to Melody that Ash is "her burden" and goes off to rescue him in Mel|`|ccc01f9771fce627fe33e93ebda578dcaa	Misty was always more "aware" (for lack of a better term) of Ash whenever Duplica of the House of Imita(tion) and her Ditto were around.<br>  <br>  In one of the later movies before her initial departure from the series, Misty did admit to "caring" about Ash to one of the guest characters.<br>  <br>  And when Misty had to go back home to oversee the Gym when all her sisters won that group trip (a flimsy excuse for her to leave if you ask me) Ash and her did get a little emotional with their goodbyes.<br>  Ash finally even replaced the bicycle destroyed when they first met.<br>  <br>  However neither character has never admitted loving the other to their face. Yet.<br>  <br>  My personal favorite was Duplica's first appearance, when Misty and the viewers start to realize she might have feelings for Ash.<br>  <br>  And unfortunately I've never heard of the Mermaid Chronicles before your question, but it does sound logical since Misty loves water based Pokemon.
ZRERT1MZaa	ooooooooooooohhhh i love anime that contains romance and comedy<br>  so here are some of my recomendations:<br>  <br>  Skip Beat! ( note: this anime may seem annoying at first but really good later on since that is what happened to me sister, so now she is hooked on it)<br>  <br>  Kyoko, a happy and cheerful 16-year-old girl, spends much of her time at the inn run by her childhood friend Shotaro, learning about housekeeping and hospitality. Shotaro, finding his family's business boring and lusting for excitement, decides to pursue a career in music. Shotaro coaxes Kyoko to leave her life behind and join him in his adventure. Arriving in Tokyo, Kyoko devotes her life to Shotaro, spending no money on herself and offering him whatever she can. Just as Shotaro starts climbing the ladder, however, Kyoko overhears him courting a starlet. <br>  <br>  Yes, he has taken advantage of her blind love and simply used her as a free housekeeper from the very beginning. Cruelly betrayed, something inside Kyoko snaps and she vows revenge in a unique way: she will become an idol singer as well. By becoming a big star herself, she hopes to kick him out of the entertainment world, a complex world filled of variety, slander and jealousy. Despite innumerable competitors ready to thwart her at every opportunity, Kyoko gradually finds joy in overcoming hardships, kicking aside all who stand in her way with one word in her mind: REVENGE!<br>  <br>  Pretear:<br>  Himeno Awayuki was a normal sixteen-year old girl until her father married a woman who happens to be rich. Since then, she has been perceived as an outcast by both her new stepsisters and her classmates. Later Himeno finds out from seven men called the Leafe Knights that she is something called Pretear, a girl who has the power to merge with and control the nature of the elemental-oriented powers from the Leafe Knights and stop an evil being called the Princess of Disaster. <br>  <br>  Shugo Chara!<br>  Amu is a 5th grade transfer student. She's fashionably cool, tough and independent. She's a girl who seems unapproachable both at home and school. However, it's just a role she is playing, unconsciously and unwillingly. In fact, like most other girls, Amu is childish, timid and romantic. Desperate to behave the way she really feels, one night she goes to bed praying for a miracle to happen. Next morning, she wakes up and finds three decorated eggs on her bed. Did she produce them herself? From that morning on, Amu is shocked to find herself starting to behave the way she really feels. When each egg hatches, a little Guardian Character emerges to help Amu express her different selves.<br>  <br>  To Amu's further surprise, she is invited to join the school's "student Council,'' the Guardians. Amu discovers that the Guardians, is really a group made up of students who all have eggs similar to hers. What's happening? Amu's adventure has just begun!<br>  <br>  Myself;Yourself<br>  Sana Hikada returns to his hometown after 5 years away living in Tokyo. Although there are some changes to the town, most has remained the same. On a detour to his apartments, he notices a girl in a shrine maiden outfit watching him when he visits the shrine. He finds out, the next day at school, that this girl is actually Nanaka Yatsushiro, his old childhood friend whom he gave a bracelet to before he left, that she still wears, even to this day. Life is what’s ahead of him, so he needs to jump over the gap between his memories and the reality in front of his eyes and move on.<br>  <br>  His and her circumstances (also kare kano but may be hard to hind since it is licensed)<br>  <br>  Yukino Miyazawa is really, really vain, and loves to hear people praise her. She's always been the best at everything, and always tries to look perfect. But when Yukino goes to high school, she's finally upstaged--by Souichiro Arima, who scores better on the entrance exams and instantly snatches the attention of the class. By accident, Arima finds out that Yukino is just pretending, and this starts off a series of events that lead to Yukino and Arima falling in love. They then have to cope with a lot of obstacles in their relationship.<br>  Yukino Miyazawa, the Queen of Vanity, is the 'perfect student' - smart, pretty, athletic and has an overall nice personality. What everyone in her school didn't know was that behind the perfect facade lies a different person. She is always the best in anything - but an obstacle comes her way. The obstacle's name is Souichirou Arima. Souichirou Arima is chosen as the representative of the freshmen, not Miyazawa. Thus, she strives hard to defeat him in all aspects. But a day comes when her most-hated enemy comes to find out her secret. From treating Arima as an enemy, friendship blossoms. Soon love comes. Kare Kano is a story that revolves all around the pangs and beauty of first love.<br>  <br>  lovely complex:<br>  One day, a very tall transfer student shows up and Risa immediately falls for him, as she has had bad luck with boys in the past because she is tall. There is a girl that Otani likes as well, so Risa and Otani decide to put aside their differences and help each other get their love interests. But as they get to know each other better, Risa's feelings for Otani begin to blossom. <br>  <br>  Karin aka chibi vampire ^_^:<br>  In the 21st century, a family of vampires settled down on the grounds of Japan and lived a modest life whilst sucking on the blood of humans discreetly. However, the eldest daughter of the family, Karin Maaka, has an embarassing secret which cannot be revealed to anyone. Even though she is a vampire, she does not lack blood like her family members. Instead, she overproduces blood to the extent that she transfuses the excess into her victims, hence increasing their blood levels. Despite her troubling body characteristic, she attends school like any other high school student, that is until a new transfer student, Kenta Usui, enters her life.<br>  <br>  Kamichama Karin<br>  Kamichama Karin is about a 7th grader named Karin Hanazono. Her parents and beloved cat, Shi-chan recently died, she`s getting horrible grades and is forced to live with her aunt. One day, Karin meets a young, orphaned, 7th grade boy named Kazune Kujyou, and discovers that her mother`s ring has the power to transform her into a goddess. She soon moves in with Kazune and his cousin Himeka. She and Kazune, who has godlike powers of his own, have to fight to protect Karin`s ring and Himeka from the evil intentions of Kirio Karasuma (whom Karin calls Mr. Glasses Man), who is also divine. The trio embark on crazy adventures and go on trips along the way. They also meet new friends and people, such as Micchi, who may know a lot of information not only about the divine transformation of the gods and goddesses, but also about Kazune-kun`s long lost father...<br>  <br>  o.O long answer lol but anyway i have more, so if you want u can email me whenver you want to try out new anime! or manga lol <br>  email;emerald7890@yahoo.com|`|tMY4iTlVaa	If you look at this link, someone asks the same question so the answer they got should apply:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AnNf7ahEqcTi2vscaXk75svty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090215163222AA2gsZm&show=7">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  Also if you're interested in manga:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AiGD5hIuF2vUn83T8qmJNA3ty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090215163113AAdbXCc&show=7">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  I'd copy and paste what's in each question, but I figure that might be a bit much :)<br>  <br>  Edit: Gravitation isn't a yaoi series, it's shonen-ai.

24UPDIBTaa	Sure, in theory, and (if you read the first link below) in practice.<br>  <br>  I don't think it's a good idea though. Taking away race (especially when it comes to non-fiction historical pieces or fiction depicting historical racial issues) makes it inaccurate. Best if a professional outfit avoid this. Maybe some people don't care. I prefer real things be portrayed that way.<br>  <br>  For all other works, let every racial group try out for any part they like and make note of which individuals were among the best. Then I'd like each role to be carefully considered. Rather than "can't take into account race" I would prefer taking all aspects into account when casting. <br>  <br>  The writer(s) wrote it as this. Is that a necessity for the role to succeed? Would changing the race of that role influence whether another role's race be changed? If a huge portion of a story is about racial conflict, you have to be confident the overall project will still work if you swap one race in for another. Sometimes you'll find characters in a piece that could be any race and still work perfectly. Producers should also go through these questions for gender.<br>  <br>  I'm thinking of all of this as a professional environment though. If it's amateur, I guess you take it less seriously, be happy you have anyone tryout, and hope no one in the cast literally breaks a leg.

En otras ocasiones simplemente se busca simplificar la conversación, como resumen de los distintos elementos que intervienen.<br>  <br>  En otras ocasiones se habla del statu quo en el sentido de una situación profundamente estancada, cuya enorme inercia hace muy difícil cambiarla. Peter Senge (1999) dijo: "...la colaboración es vital para mantener los cambios realmente profundos, ya que sin ella, las organizaciones son abrumadas por las fuerzas del statu quo".<br>  <br>  En forma más sarcástica, Laurence J. Peter, el autor del Principio de Peter, dijo en una ocasión: "La burocracia defiende el statu quo mucho tiempo después de que el quo haya perdido su statu".|`|cfb1eba9cced2c127d83103f086d485faa	Status Quo es una banba britanica|`|e36e4e00a086918781b9c5aa68ffc05aaa	quietito|`|e712c79b4aeb28d3bc01947ced647b26aa	Hola...<br>  es un grupo que suena desde fines de los 60...si viviste en los 80, seguro que lo conociste por In the army now...un clasico..<br>  te dejo un link para mas informacion...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.statusquo.co.uk/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.statusquo.co.uk/index.html</a> (en ingles)<br>  <a href="http://www.alohacriticon.com/alohapoprock/article1529.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.alohacriticon.com/alohapoproc...</a> (en espaniol)<br>  <br>  Saludos|`|0e647d31685f6eeaac8a473eaa905063aa	un grupo de rock de los a?os 60, términos latinos en castellano significa estado de las cosas.<br>  <br>  un saludo guapa|`|bd8bb84dc6d4518041afe0c4b6ff93b6aa	El status quo es el primer estado en q se encontraba la cosa, situacion, o persona ... es el principio, como estaba desde el primer momento|`|501d955f8b0f6639747a1ab02653746faa	"status quo" es una palabra de origen latina ( se entiende por latín), que se refiere entre otras cosas a una posibilidad de mediación entre dos partes por eso se utiliza mucho en la diplomacia, seria algo asi como un" estado de cosa" o como se equilibria esa cosa. bueno creo que hay una conjunto de musica británica que usa este nombre|`|690b9e02d0f36d146533f6f5821c9d1faa	que permanece igual... en la misma posicion o sin movimiento.|`|c898faeeb07a93886ff641920d241984aa	Proviene del romano.. es el juez de primera instancia para resolver controversias judiciales... y el ad quem.. es el de segunda instancia..|`|dc1414a35aae62437766e3cdcfe20ee7aa	un grupo de los 60|`|06e73f7dcc474e635cf09bbf6cf1de9baa	Statu quo es una frase latina, que se traduce como "estado de las cosas", que hace referencia al estado global de un asunto en un momento dado.

Los avatares de las modas, que hacen que súbitamente aparezcan y desaparezcan canciones, grupos e incluso estilos musicales (o al menos etiquetas de la industria para éstos) no han conseguido que Status Quo haya modificado ni un ápice su discurso, su estilo ni su espíritu. El registro de la propia banda indica que a partir de su primer gran éxito en 1968, se inició una carrera que hasta la fecha contabiliza 50 éxitos, más que ningún otro grupo. Los Rolling Stones y Los Beatles lo intentaron, pero sólo Status Quo puede decir que ha conquistado esta meta, haciendo que sus singles hayan permanecido semanas completas en las listas británicas|`|25409c38bf55dae477cd12cd1aa8ca8caa	El estado actual de las cosas.

La palabra statu procede de status, pero no va en nominativo, ya que no es sujeto, sino en ablativo, porque hace la función de complemento circunstancial (en la situación). Quo  también es el ablativo del pronombre relativo (en que). La expresión statu quo es  de origen diplomático y se usa para expresar una situación que ha cambiado pero que no se quiere mantener, sino volver a la anterior.<br>  Con motivo del incidente entre Espa?a y Marruecos de mediados de julio de 2002 sobre la ocupación por unos y por otros del islote Perejil, se ha hablado mucho de que lo que pretendía el gobierno espa?ol era que se volviera al statu quo anterior al día 11 de julio. <br>  Se comete el mismo error que en otros términos procedentes del latín, y es que se repite en espa?ol lo que se ha dicho ya en latín. Así en statu quo ya está el en que (quo). Se ha oído estos días: "Hay que volver al statu quo en que se encontraba la isla ..." Esto último indica que no se conoce el origen del término.|`|c88c977059f182dd570b7cc79e4479bdaa	Es latin, significa:"El estado de las cosas"... saludos

Imagine vc: se o Bin Laden ou o Fernandinho Beira Mar fosse de um outro signo qquer q n?o seja o atual signo deles, vc acredita q eles teriam uma personalidade e atitudes diferente da atual??? Fala sério.<br>  <br>  Eu tenho a seguinte opini?o: n?o gosto de horóscopo e nunca acreditei e penso q as pessoas q se preocupam com isso, ficam estáticas na vida. Esque?a esse negócio de horóscopo e viva sua vida na maior normalidade possível. Imagine vc q o planeta terra tem +ou- 7 bilh?es de habitantes se existem 12 signos, seriam aproximadamente 584 milh?es de um mesmo signo, sendo assim, se o horóscopo funcionasse para pelo menos 1% dessa galera, q seriam 5.840.000 pessoas beneficiadas ou aterrorizadas pelo tal horóscopo. Portanto, nunca vi nada dá certo pra um monte de gente q esteja relacionado a horóscopo. Portanto, acho mais viável viver a vida numa normalidade e sem se preocupar com esse negócio, a aparentemente s?o pessoas q ganham a vida escrevendo isso e como quase todo ser humano é curioso, lê e na maioria das vezes ficam impressionados, pensando q tudo aquilo vai acontecer. Se coincidir algo q disse no horóscopo, aí acredita e agarra essa idéia com for?a.|`|ELQLKgNtaa	Aquário <br>  Paquerador de bom papo, o aquário é charmoso e envolvente.

Mas isso é muito pouco para segurar o astral, pois além de querer conduzir a rela??o, Escorpi?o tem a mania de criticar mais do que elogiar. No sexo, as coisas melhoram, pois a sua criatividade vai se dar muito bem com o forte erotismo de Escorpi?o.

Me gusta mucho Debussy, en este momento estoy tocando la petit suite a 4 manos, y aunque es un tanto extra?a, tiene otros colores, otras sonoridades que me gustan por innovadoras en cuanto a la música, ya que como bien has de saber, fue el primer compositor que se acerca a la bitonalidad, a las escalas de tonos enteros, en fin, otras armonias no comunes.<br>  <br>  Considero que es muy buen compositor y una de mis obras favoritas es el preludio no 2 aunque por nada del mundo cambio a Beethoven, jeje!|`|ZlUdFsMdaa	Realmente lo considero uno de los más geniales compositores que han existido. Me encantan su color, frescura, creatividad, expresividad y vitalidad. Esta entre lo mejor que se puede escuchar.<br>  <br>  Sin embargo no creo en Dios. No creo en mitos y leyendas esotéricas o misticas. Solo creo en lo humano, respeto lo humano y valoro lo humano. El ser humano es lo más importante para mi. La inspiración es algo intrinsecamente humano fruto del poder maravilloso de la mente sensible. La obra de Debussy es algo realmente maravilloso, pero es maravillosa no porque provenga de dioses o inspiraciones místicas sino porque es fruto de la más profunda sensibilidad humana.|`|qQ8DBvDlaa	Pues no tanto inspiradas por DIos, pero si tienen una imaginación tremenda, a mi por ejemplo de las que más me gustan es la de: Golligogs Cake-Walk.

ZjaCaM4maa	With my Scorpio girl I can sometimes tell what kind of mood she's in. Most of the time she holds her feelings in until something really bad happens then all of her feelings come out in the form of an emotional explosion. Most Scorpio girls are gorgeous and mine likes alot eye contact. She likes to have freedom and is EXTREMELY loyal to me. She does get possessive and jealous at times but I think that's her way of showing me that she loves me. She also tends to spoil me a bit (lols). Hope this helps :)|`|qnBVKBJIaa	I find the women very attractive.|`|NODH6uXYaa	plus side:<br>  You are an intense sign. You love magic and mystery and people are naturally drawn to you. You love to be the leader and tend to make a great one. You treat your friends as if they are family; however, you only share you secrets with one or two very special people whom you trust completely. A Scorpio will always forgive - but will never forget. Once you break the trust of a Scorpio, things are never the same again.<br>  <br>  negative side<br>  You are often seen as secretive because you don't spill the beans to everyone. Friends want to get to know you, but you won't open up and share things with them until they fully gain your trust. You are often seen as moody and insulting - especially when you are bored.

DsWgAqS8aa	USA Network premiered on September 27, 1977, originally organized as the Madison Square Garden Network (not to be confused with the New York City regional sports network of that name), the channel became one of the first national cable television channels when it chose to use satellite delivery as opposed to microwave relay to cable systems.<br>  <br>  On April 9, 1980, the channel changed its name to USA Network after the ownership structure was reorganized under a joint operating agreement by the UA-Columbia Cablevision cable system (now known as Cablevision Systems Corporation) and MCA Inc./Universal City Studios (whose assets are currently owned largely by NBC Universal and Vivendi SA)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Network" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Network</a>

What happened to separation of church and state?<br>  <br>  The fact of the matter is, no married couple should be receiving tax or other benefits, regardless of whether you are married to the opposite sex, same sex, or your pet, local rapist, or church-goer.  Do you think it is really fair that, as a single person, that I should have to pay for your spouse, your off-spring, and you.  I didn't choose to marry and reproduce (and many of us wish that you would have done the same).<br>  <br>  You are so misinformed, maybe you need to go back and thoroughly study your biblical principals instead of spreading your hatred.  Somehow I think the true principals and teachings of the bible have been forgotten so that you can practice your own political agenda.

XOnSRoR2aa	I've lived in LA for most of my life and have a parent who works in the entertainment industry (not as an actor or celebrity, though) and so I've met several, but my favorites were Angelina Jolie, Will Smith and Brad Pitt. <br>  <br>  I met Angelina when I was 12 at a Barnes & Noble, and she was incredibly sweet and gracious to me, and let me babble on for ages about how I admired her work as a UN Ambassador. <br>  I met Will Smith at a football game, and he was cool because he was just hyper-enthusiastic. <br>  And I met Brad Pitt last spring while hiking with my dog. He said my dog was gorgeous. : )<br>  <br>  I am very envious of Mazzy's experiences! Omg, how freaking insanely awesome it would be to meet U2 or have drinks with REM.

jiZ8WltPaa	Family...and respect for yourself....if you don't respect yourself how can you love...|`|hbVbGHEAaa	Love is patient; love is kind; love is not envious or boastful or arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice in wrongdoing, but rejoices in the truth. It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never ends. But as for prophecies, they will come to an end; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will come to an end... And now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; and the greatest of these is love. (NRSV, 1 Corinthians 13:4-8, 13)|`|SlpnQI02aa	Jesus. But then He is love as well. The most important thing you can ever do is love. Jesus emphasis this over and over. He was once asked what the greatest commandment in the Law was. Jesus replied " 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.' This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: 'Love your neighbour as yourself'.' " You can never do a more greater thing than love someone.|`|Sh13k42qaa	Love is a nice emotion but it is never enough to sustain anything, especially a relationship.<br>  All the love in the world can not replace the pleasure fame, money and power can produce.|`|qr16GzNnaa	nothing, because with out love we are nothing.

10mOHSZTaa	I've never understood why people think there's some sort of battle between technical and emotional ability. I mean, yes, it's possible to have an emotionless but technically perfect performance, or an emotional but technically horrible performance, but it's not like that's a real dichotomy. (I recommend the video on Youtube of Wilhelm Kempff that the second answerer mentioned. It's been in my Youtube favorites forever but it somehow slipped my mind.)<br>  <br>  By improving our technique, we as musicians learn to play with feeling. My teacher has been on my case as long as I've been with him to curve my fingers more and work on differentiating between the dynamics in both hands. Why? Because that's what makes music sound better.<br>  <br>  Music is surrounded by all sorts of shamanistic stuff. People will tell you something cryptic like, "It's too dry at measure 14," or, "You're not letting the voices sing." You know what that means? It means that you either need to play legato or use some pedal at measure 14 because you have some awkward empty space (most likely). To 'let voices sing' what you have to do is pay attention to which hand is playing the melody, and play that hand louder than you play the accompanying hand.<br>  <br>  It takes more than that to be a truly great musician, but what great musicians are really good at is figuring out how to use dynamics, pedaling, and all the other bits of technique that they've learned over the years to wring the most out of the music.<br>  <br>  I'm kind of old-school (like 150 years old-school) in that my focus is more on the music being played than the person playing it. With the rise of rock music we have this cult of the performer, which is why so many people latch on to one performer (Glenn Gould, Martha Argerich, Itzhak Perlman, etc) and then shun everyone else's. Can't listen to Murray Perahia, Evgeny Kissin, or Issac Stern; the only *real* Mozart or Bach or whatever is played by that one performer. (And for the record I like every performer I listed except Gould.)<br>  <br>  Then people start personally identifying with that performer, so if you say, "You know, I actually liked Ton Koopman's performance better," you're saying that you reject them and their of course impeccable good taste.|`|Wi0LBsVbaa	A bad performance is a bad performance. I would think the individual was simply trying to see the glass as half full. My #1 guitar player is one of those who is satisfied with bad music, if people in general are having a good time. In his eyes I'm a crab who is too judgmental, in my eyes he is an enabler of musical malfeasance. <br>  However, that being said, Neil Young would rather play with the people who have the best feeling, rather than the best technical ability, and it really works for him. However, again sufficient musicianship needs to exist to get the feeling expressed.<br>  Bad music is like bad food, but some people will eat anything.<br>  The right notes and the right feeling make music, not everyone has the skills to notice that stuff. You do, thank God. Don't get hung up on it, remember; to the genius everyone else is brainless.|`|9ee25102a7763535588f4a899e88f4dcaa	I think you are being a little unfair about the standard of musicians in pop music; some of them can be very skilled indeed - especially in progressive rock where many of them were/are classically trained.<br>  <br>  I can't answer this question in absolute terms. I would rather hear a musically committed and interesting performance than a note-perfect but sterile one. That's why I can't often enjoy Hilary Hahn, for example. All the technique and the notes are there but there's no passion or soul to my ears.<br>  <br>  Of course, all the passion in the world can't compensate for a technically inept performance so it needs a balance of the two (and, in a rare few instances, bags of both). Have I answered your question?|`|kbFty6eVaa	Typically if someone does not have competent technique, they can't play musically either. Musicality relies upon the ability to carry out the physical subtleties that create musicality in the first place. It would be hard to believe, for me, that someone could give a truly musical performance with bad technique.<br>  <br>  Music requires technique, but technique by itself does not beget music|`|CjPtAEzmaa	It depends on how bad it was technically. Take Wilhelm Kempff's Third Movement of Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata. There are about three times in the YouTube video where you can hear him hit a wrong note. Of course, this is always pointed out in comments, calling it a 'sucky performance'. But he played with such passion and fire, I don't really care if he missed three notes. But if the whole piece is horrible, then I definitely have a problem. XD<br>  <br>  The part about the pop concert made me smile. Thank you :)|`|XkPgw7ZRaa	Rachel,<br>  <br>  I agree with you 100%.  If the music is presented sloppy, it is even an embarrassment on the composer.  I hope you agree.  This especially if you are paying to attend.<br>  <br>  Anthony|`|mMnRmYvNaa	I would like to agree with you with the exception of Annie Fisher. She's a Hungarian who played the Mozart piano concerti, and her recordings are not technically perfect, she makes plenty of mistakes, doesn't really try to hide them or cover them up, just lets them be there. The thing of it is that her understanding of Mozart is so profound and her play is so free and spirited that it is better than Geza Anda and he's technically perfect -- every note in place -- every rubato just so.<br>  <br>  Annie was so good that she could compose and present her own candezas as she played in concert -- ex tempore. She often used Busoni candenzas, but modified them in very original ways. <br>  <br>  She was on the piano what Stephan Grappelli was on the jazz violin, or what Oscar Peterson was on the jazz piano. Genius clears the way for itself the same as beauty is its own passport in this world. We revere it. We adore it.<br>  <br>  So, 99% of me says -- yes of course technical competence is crucial -- and then 1% of me rebels and says -- what about Annie and Stephan and Oscar -- what about the many technical errors they leave in their playing. <br>  <br>  We have two kinds of passports in the USA -- the ordinary green ones, and the diplomatic service black ones. Let's just say some people who play music are so far above the average player that they get a black passport -- which means they can miss notes here and there and nobody cares.<br>  <br>  You seem to me one of the brightest people on Answers, so I hope this answer helps you, even though it doesn't go exactly like you seemed to be going.|`|vsy4QMHMaa	Rachel,<br>  <br>  Thanks for the question. Yes it annoys the crap out of me. Worse, is that I have to work with musicians who do not show up for rehearsal and often times try to re-interpret what was codified in rehearsal. Their excuses range from not having the time (other activities get in the way) to they are so much better than the rest of us that it's a waste of time for them to attend. <br>  <br>  What you get out at the other end is a performance of pap for a now unappreciative audience. It's frustrating as all get out, and no one has put anyone's toes to the fire. "Be there, or leave your instrument at home."<br>  <br>  I won't argue for or against "perfection" because I flub my fair share of notes, but it is as rehearsed and polished as I can make it within production time lines. (And none of this is pro-level).<br>  <br>  On the other hand, a week or so ago, someone had posted a link to a video of a famous French pianist doing the most abysmal rendition of Bach's T & F in Dmin. --- That was tragic and I would either play it far better or not play it at all.

He greatly enjoys standing on stage and listening to the fans scream their heads off for him.<br>  (he usually stands there and motions for them to scream louder between songs XD)<br>  <br>  His style of music stays consistant, even though it changes so much.<br>  From back in Malice Mizer, he still  kept his trademark sound.... (I've not heard anythign from Kain:Feel, so I can't say anything about his frist band)<br>  Mizerable was beautiful, and one of his first songs as a solo artist, and then Vanilla was about the compleat oposite of his usual theme XD<br>  But, it still sounded like him.<br>  <br>  From his rock songs, to his pop, and hell! Even to his electric music that for some reason is starting to come out.... <br>  <br>  (and, I'm trying to find a song that doesn't have "hold me" in it XD<br>  Even in Ghost (written for the TerminatorSCC movie) that was extreamly different in how the lyrics were.... he still managed to throw in "hold me tightly".)<br>  <br>  He isn't full of himself, in an interview he stated he things of himself as an average person, and therefor has to work much harder in order to be better then everyone (see point under this)<br>  And so, he coudn't see how he could work harder, as he didn't have time.<br>  So, he now sleeps THREE hours a day. *bad Gackt...*<br>  <br>  <br>  he's a perfectionist, if someone is better then him at something, he will stop at nothing to fix that. XD<br>  <br>  <br>  He's got the voice of a God.<br>  For someone that sings and talks with such a low voice, he can hit some high pitches amazingly well.<br>  Even his talking voice makes me shiver....<br>  <br>  The lyrics for his songs (that he writes) are beautiful, and are so touching.<br>  Last Song never fails to make my cry, but Vanilla or Pappa Lapped a Pap Lopped (no... I really don't understand how he got that name either...) do the compleat oposite.<br>  Soliel allways puts a smile on my face as well.<br>  <br>  The instermentals:<br>  ahhhhh, he has got THE best players! (okay maybe not...)<br>  fistly YOU (no not you- You!... his name is... You...)<br>  <br>  He was the guitarist back in Feel:Kain, Gackt was the drummer- but they lost their vocalist.<br>  You got him to start singing, and is the only reason Gackt ever tried it out.<br>  <br>  You is the guitarist for Gackt, but also the violinist (one of the best ones I've ever heard, and this is not an understatement. i've listened to plenty of clasicle music, but you's violin skills are just amazing) and the backup vocals.<br>  <br>  Chacha (or Chachamaru) is the lead guitarist. (and backup vocals) <br>  YES! The man can play the guitar!  He is soooooooooooooo good O_O<br>  <br>  <br>  Masa- former bassist... replaced by Ju-ken<br>  ahh, I kinda miss him. :(<br>  It's hard to hear the bass, as usuall... but I really loved him.<br>  I think that Ju-ken is probably a lot better, and i'l get used to him- but masa will be missed.<br>  <br>  Sadly, I don't remember who the drummer is or was.<br>  I just know I get his name and Ju-ken's mixed up alot, as his name is Ju-something too...<br>  <br>  REALLY good drummer.

For my birthday and Christmas (which are close together), my younger sister surprised me with two huge "coffeetable" books I would daydream over each time I went to the bookstore. They are among the best gifts I've ever received, and I still have them. I can't imagine ever letting them go till I'm old enough to perhaps give them as gifts to someone who will appreciate them. I hope they find a good home.<br>  <br>  "Parrish blue" is one of the most beautiful colors I've ever seen, and I love how he uses pastels in such unusual ways. Shadows are his blues, while highlights are golden-orange. His people are especially distinctive, drawing on Art Nouveau somewhat but reminding me of some of my other favorites: the Pre-Raphaelites, especially Dante Gabriel Rossetti. John William Waterhouse is amazing, too. I'm such a pushover for wildly romantic artists. I've always had long, coppery-red hair, and it was comforting to see such haircolor in their paintings when what was popular in the Sixties were blondes and brunettes with absolutely straight hair. I suppose that sounds silly, but it's the truth. Also, these are the artists who influenced my painting style somewhat.<br>  <br>  Here are some of Parrish's images though some do not reproduce his colors accurately:<br>  <a href="http://ww1.prweb.com/prfiles/2006/07/11/410489/daybreak.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://ww1.prweb.com/prfiles/2006/07/11/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.essentialart.com/mh/Maxfield_Parrish_Ectasy.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.essentialart.com/mh/Maxfield_...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/17026805@N08/1825522926/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/17026805@N0...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.linesandcolors.com/images/2007-01/parrish_450.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.linesandcolors.com/images/200...</a><br>  Here are two Waterhouse redheads =}<br>  <a href="http://www.icecastle.org/artwork/images/My%20Sweet%20Rose,%20by%20John%20William%20Waterhouse%20(1849-1917)_jpg.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.icecastle.org/artwork/images/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.essentialart.com/nyg/John_William_Waterhouse_The_Lady_of_Shalott.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.essentialart.com/nyg/John_Wil...</a><br>  <br>  EDIT: Have I misunderstood the question?

(They were in cases and we knew they were always kept unloaded in the house.)  We had no need to keep them, but I wish we would have waited for one of those deals where they give you $100.<br>  <br>  Personally, I think people should be allowed to own guns for self protection.  The police are too busy eating donuts and giving out parking tickets, and I don't think people can really have any confidence that the police will be there to help them when they need it.  I do think that anyone who wants to purchase a gun should be thoroughly investigated, people don't need to have machine guns or 20 guns, they shouldn't be allowed to take them inside government buildings, and private businesses should have the right to prohibit guns on their premises.|`|SpiEasx5aa	I'll keep my guns till I'm too old to hunt with them, and not a day sooner.

BVaCJkxzaa	I do feel for him. I like Mickey Rourke. He's a mans man. Men have special relationships with their dogs sometimes. When a guy gets home from work there is the dog happy to see him while the wife is out running around on him. The dog doesn't get mad when you spend $600 on a designer purse for your 17 year old daughters birthday and forgot to include the $300 matching check book cover. The dog is just happy to lick the tuna can you opened to make yourself a sandwich for dinner and thinks you're the greatest for sharing it with her and being there for her. It hurts to lose a special relationship like the one you should be able to have with a wife and kids but can only seem to find with mans best friend.|`|liJKE5B2aa	....Or should we bow our heads in mourning over the death of acting talent in America ?|`|JGpOTNwLaa	In these days it is not right to judge a person because they are morning there dog.

GRAE6K1iaa	LOL, nice stuff! If he took me to one his metal/rock concerts, I would appreciate it. She would do the same, her happiness will lay in yours. <br>  <br>  Well I shouldn't be taking him anywhere, I should be taken! I don't drive, I have a license, but hate driving. I would make him drive me to Goa, and from there I would take his hand and walk along the beach  as the sun sets and kiss him. Isn't is romantic? Then he can take me out shopping, don't forget to do that after your zoo trip! Shopping is a must. <br>  <br>  It's actually quite sweet and romantic, taking her to a zoo, make sure only cute animals are in the surrounding. Otherwise it might be a bit uncomfy, but at the end of the day, it really depends on a person, their likes and dislikes. Who knows, she might be into snakes as well. Your influence will be great, you will probably influence her into liking lions and snakes. Take Care Buddy, Happy Maha Shivratri.|`|c2N6M6o6aa	Hey, common! I know a story..read on! No adult content or anything.<br>  <br>  A boy had a crush on a girl. About 15 or 16. The boy wanted to impress her very badly. So, one night he called her over to his home, when he was sure that he was alone. He took her to his room. She started sweating! He put off the lights.....and.....he pressed the 'light' button in his watch and asked her<br>  "Isn't this watch bright? My mother gifted me. Very costly you know? Blah...blah..blah.."<br>  Isn't your place better than his? Anyways, I think I would take him to Qatar or Chennai. If it is Chennai, surely the greatest Marina beach! Oooohhh...who is that unlucky fellow going to die with me? :-P|`|yTI5bKAwaa	You should take her to Kenya and show your appreciation for lions :]<br>  <br>  Or the Great Barrier Reef and hunt for Nemo with her. :D<br>  <br>  My place would be on a roadtrip.|`|zn8TzZrJaa	The RIVER! and swing into the water on the ropeswing :D <br>  but >_<<br>  he don't like to swim..sooo<br>  Uh, anywhere!:D <br>  as long as I'm with him|`|Y31Ci8vlaa	I would take my girlfriend to a beach.It seems to be the only good option.|`|k7Rtcqfraa	You're really weird. She might be pissed and push you to a real mamba lol !<br>  <br>  I think beach would be a good idea|`|yB6Vg65Daa	Somewhere quiet and peaceful where we could just relax and talk.|`|eKDYbe9Laa	my home|`|4IC78le4aa	The Zoo is very popular for dates. You are not the only animal lover out there, lol.<br>  <br>  Anywhere you feel most comfortable and you is the best place because that way you are not awkward and the person can get good insight into the real you and not who you are pretending to be.<br>  <br>  I always think sitting on a dock eating fish and chips or ona  cliff having chicken and champagne  is much more romantic and personal than a stupid stuck up restaurant.|`|8044a7bd2bb393b88020b2acea00a3daaa	Dinner and a concert is always great.<br>  Something intimate and quiet is always best though. Like someone said, a quiet place where you can talk and get to know each other better. A picninc is certainly something that will impress either sex, just for the effort that goes into putting one together. I think that's on my list for this summer! I live where there's tons of snow, so we gotta wait til the summer to do anything at all outside. Just takes the fun out of a picnic when it's like 200degrees below zero outside!|`|m2CR7zEnaa	well my fiance usually takes me out and i love it when he takes me to the lake. we can fish or maybe jump in the river for a swim when it's hot and there's nothin better than sittin in his arms under a big shade tree watchin the ducks swim.|`|rXBhCKkeaa	Try a picnic!! That is always a great way to get to know someone. You could feed birds near a pond. Get outside and throw a frisbi.

Great culture, nightlife, food, etc.  It is really expensive though.  I personally hate LA.  I find the people very unfriendly, there's actually not much to do, low job availability, and the cost of living is very high.  If I were going to move to California, I'd definitely go for San Francisco or San Diego.  I'd recommend some other cities like Atlanta, Philadelphia, New Orleans, Minneapolis, Chicago, Boston, Seattle, Austin, or San Antonio.  Texas is actually a really great place as long as you stay near the larger cities.  I don't know too much about Canada.|`|V8sDPf2Eaa	canada<br>  they like hippies like you the US doesnt need anymore<br>  your name fits you perfectly|`|m2PlMByKaa	NYC!!!!|`|6y5wgdmHaa	I think you are in one of the best places in the world - look around!|`|4T9fZzITaa	La with us :]<br>  nyc i heard it's hard to get an apartment<br>  alotta ppl go missing there and crime so ive heard<br>  canada... well idk i wouldn know what to say good or bad<br>  La i think you'll meet some pple you'd actually like and weathers good <br>  though yes we are going through that crisis. why would you want to move though?!

ad7c07e88b671bd6c5e3eb881bf1d65daa	Why would we wish to prevent physical death?  <br>  <br>  Is it premature death we fear?  <br>  <br>  For the most part, physical death comes when we can no longer be good custodians of our bodies. Successful maintenance of our bodies promotes longevity and life itself.  Like Bronwen's car analogy, a body will last as well as we maintain it. The best cure for premature death is prevention.  We are empowered with intelligence to provide self care and prevent premature death.<br>  <br>  If we look deeply enough, the real essence of this question is "why do we *fear* death"?  Perhaps we fear death because we fear life.  <br>  <br>  Too often we turn to outside sources to cure us of all our ailments, and of life and death.  Ailments are fear based.  Perhaps our solution is to change our own views of self-created fears about death and life itself.  <br>  <br>  When we care for our physical and emotional bodies, we support our known states of life.  When we support life, we provide ourselves with time to complete our goals.  When we complete our goals, we can face our fear of death and of life.  When we remove fear, we attain peace within ourselves.  When we achieve peace, we have no fear.  Yet to achieve peace within is to face the fear within.<br>  <br>  Physical death is a part of life.  Yet science, for the most part, has proven that energy cannot be destroyed; it merely changes form.  We are energy.  <br>  <br>  Our fears can be allayed if we empower ourselves from within rather than seeking outside solutions (solutions as suggested in your question that science cannot provide us with answers to).  <br>  <br>  While we cannot change the finite life span of a single cell, we can change ourselves with our thoughts and our actions.  We can support our physical and emotional health.  We can prolong our lives.  We can complete our goals.  We can empower ourselves with choices.  We can make peace with ourselves and leave our physical bodies when we are ready.  <br>  <br>  When we empower ourselves to face what we fear, we grow.  Could it be that life and it's ensuing death are simply "growing pains"?  Could life and death provide us with a portal to another stage, another form?  Can we prove energy cannot be destroyed, that it simply changes form?  Still, scientific advances are unable to conclusively answer this for us.  <br>  <br>  Yet the unanswerable is both a gift and a blessing.  Be grateful that neither science nor any other outside source can take away our power by preventing "death".  Be thankful that no one but us can remove our fears for us, or answer on our behalf.  Be powerful from within, fear neither life nor death and questions such as this will have no power over us.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	Death has nothing to do with medical advances. <br>  <br>  Sooner or later, everyone will die. That is just how it is. It wouldn't be good if people lived forever. Evolution wouldn't ever occur.<br>  <br>  Death is a necessity.|`|1MLIYilNaa	Death is a part of life.<br>  Even if it comes too soon, it has to happen.<br>  It's just the way it is.|`|AA10246871	Well, there are a lot of unnatural causes to death, like disease, starvation, and accidents, but those are sort of self-explanatory. I am going to explain it in the simplest terms, which means looking at someone who simply dies of old age, with no disease, like heart disease, involved.<br>  <br>  All of our life depends on cells and cell reproduction. That's what makes us grow from babies to adults. You might be interested to know that you get an entirely new body about every seven years. Old cells die, and new ones replicate and replace them. Some cells are replaced more quickly, and some more slowly, but by the time you reach a seven-year benchmark, every single cell in your body has died off and been replaced with a new one doing the same job.<br>  <br>  When we are young, our cells replicate fairly quickly, and as they pass on our genetic code (DNA), which tells them what purpose they will serve (i.e. brain cells, blood cells, bone tissue), they tend to pass it with very few mistakes. Starting at about age 30, that cell reproductions begins to slow, and it continues slowing for the rest of your life. That's why it takes a 50 year old a lot longer to heal from a broken bone than it does a 17 year old, and also why there's more of a chance the 50 year old will have problems when the bone heals. Now just as our body's cells start to slow down on how quickly they reproduce and replace each other around age 30, they also start to make mistakes as they pass on coding. Some cells are so "broken" that they cannot function at all. Basically, the whole system starts making mistakes and gradually more and more mistakes are made as cells replicate. So, you're replacing old, dying cells more slowly, and the new cells you are making aren't always good ones. And that's happening everywhere in your body. Every kind of tissue, from bones, to skin, to organs, is made up of cells. And those cells are slowly getting faultier and faultier. Eventually, the cells in your body are replicating very slowly, and the new ones are very "broken" in that they aren't working properly. Eventually the finely tuned machine simply breaks down, and you die. <br>  <br>  The reason we cannot prevent death is because we haven't found a way to keep that cell reproduction going at a quicker pace, as it does when we are young, and because we don't know how to fix the cells which reproduce with faults in them. Since the DNA is inside the cell, it would take intense study of many separate cells to see what is going on with the DNA, and there's just no way to do that right now. A cell may look healthy and normal under a microscope, but we have no way of knowing if it's coded correctly, and we certainly don't have a way to fix it if it's not.<br>  <br>  Think of it this way. Take a brand new car. Drive it for as long as you can. You can fix some parts as they break down, you can change the tires and the paint, but you cannot change the very basic parts like the engine and the transmission. As the engine and transmission work, they develop tiny problems. That's why we take our cars to mechanics--they either fix the part, or replace it entirely. But if you keep the same engine and transmission, sooner or later those little faults and problems are going to make it so the car breaks down for good. It's the same with the body. We can fix some things, and replace others, but we cannot replace the really fundamental stuff, which is the cells. And like the parts of the car, eventually they give out, too, and we die.<br>  <br>  We used to live in another neighborhood, and there was an elderly couple up the street. She died in her sleep one night when she was in her early 80s. Since she hadn't been under the care of a doctor for a specific problem like heart disease or dementia or anything else, her adult children wanted an autopsy done. Her husband, who was about 2 years older than her, as well as the family doctor, told the kids it wasn't worth it, because she just died of old age, but the kids were really adamant about it, so they went ahead and did an autopsy. What did they find? Nothing. Everything was fine and looked normal and should have been in good working order. She hadn't had a stroke or a heart attack in the night. She didn't have clogged arteries or lung problems. She just died because her body basically wore out. And it wore out because of how the cells were behaving.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps explain it for you.|`|R7VjuCT2aa	Preventing death would only cause more death since the Earth only has so much biomass and eventually would reach it's carrying capacity.|`|Pk5NwUY1aa	Death will never be "solved".<br>  Who wants to live forever? Why?<br>  Political problems and ecological problems would kill us.<br>  Don't fear death.

If no one died, there would be no need for babies to be born. No one would stop doing anything because they couldnt be killed. All of societies Morals and values would crumble as some people would go about abusing people, commiting crimes, because they could live forever so nothing could be done to them.<br>  <br>  Death is needed for a functioning society. Without death, you can never appreciate new life<br>  <br>  Hope this helps xx|`|1nVRMObiaa	DEATH is the inevitable end of this world as we know it. Jesus Christ is the door to every person's desired home. Any advancement in science & technology, or use of it, that only serves to drive people away from Christ are exploits in futility.

qLvhoRpsaa	Yes! Definitely I do!<br>  I have a small group of contacts/fans that I am getting to know better everyday and look for them, their questions or answers first.

I am loyal to my contacts and fans. Most of them are loyal right back to me!

4277201b67af194037740747ba2be513aa	She says that she's making all this money for her kids? Well, her kids need love and attention, NOT pots of money. Her kids need stability and a proper family NOT pots of money and her kids need to remember their mother as a dignified person NOT somebody who'd sell her very being! <br>  <br>  I think her kids should be adopted and she should close the door firmly behind her and get on with what's important.|`|00bf7069da8dc56516b179f42730c38faa	I didn't know she was having it filmed, that's sick, it's private and should stay private, I do feel sorry for her of course but i think it's just been far too public, people die from cancer every day unfortunately and I'm pretty sure most people wouldn't want the world to see it..it's time she said farewell to the paparazzi and spend her last few wks or however long she's got left with her loved ones...|`|AFNN6wBeaa	Her death will be filmed if the price is right. I watched my sister die in agony from cancer it is a horrible thing to see someone you love suffering.<br>  Hasn't she made enough money how much will she sell her sons being christened for? No she won't give any of her millions to cancer charities.|`|xCqNTjGLaa	yeah ur right but wot annoys me is dat everybody is goin on about how sad it is... most people nevr liked her in da first place and now they love her (dats just sad) plus der are thousands of people dying due to cancer so just get on with it|`|7fa275a0b219d341645d003c4f5add6baa	She is not getting filmed dying.|`|0UPvxzkxaa	does it matter whether you liked bb or not or even jade goody herself? personally i think what she is doing is to try and get as much money as possible to put away for her sons to have a good life and decent education, personally i think her trying to raise awareness for those people who haven't experienced cancer first hand is a good thing! i went straight to my GP and asked for a smear test(i've always refused one before) this is because of being able to see exactly  what she has been through rather then just hearing about it as i have done so many times, but honestly haven't thought twice about it! those two boys will have a choice whether to watch that video or not, i know i will not be watching that, but am personally grateful for jade on educating me on cervical cancer!|`|433165e2c7b432dcd07898d64f6f19c8aa	She's not going to be filmed dying. Perhaps checking facts before posing questions would help a little? However, if she did, i wouldn't watch it. I've watched enough people die as a Nurse, and it's downright unpleasant and too emotive. She's simply making money for her children whilst she can. She's always been in the public eye for something, so she's simply continuing because it's how she's made her money. The difference between Jade and everyone else is that she's in the public eye so has those means open to her. The rest of us aren't famous so we don't. Doesn't make her wrong for using the means open to her.|`|Ke9cILe6aa	I would only want to see it just so I know it is for real and that she has finally gone! I am fed up of hearing about her, she has done NOTHING good or positive and as soon as the morons out there realise this the better. <br>  <br>  Money, money, money. She is so ignorant and stupid which has made it easier for the likes of Clifford to manipulate her. Yes, she has got lots of money from all this but so has he!<br>  <br>  It is a media circus and a farce!<br>  <br>  Good riddance to bad rubbish!<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT - Tinkerbell, what Max Clifford ACTUALLY said was that he will have nothing to do with the filming of her death for personal reasons, he then said that Jade HAD been contacted by others regarding this and he advised against it. I am sure that at the last minute someone will come in with a few million and she will accept.|`|jxPr6dd4aa	i agree 100% with everything you said.. i can't believe it|`|OcmUW298aa	She didn't win BB. she came fourth i think. Im with you im sick of her being plastered all over the media etc. I can understand she wants security for her kids but i think enough is enough.I never liked her and her attitude when she appeared on the box and now she is dying she still wants to grab the limelight,the whole fiasco makes me want to vomit.  The state Gordon Brown and the country is in, and he has now jumped on the Jade bandwagon,anything to get the public on his side,i thought Blair was slime but this takes the cake.|`|PwHQSAxvaa	She didn't win BB, she came 4th, and was evicted in Celebrity BB. She never won anything. But she somehow rose to fame purely because she is stupid, and thought Cambridge was in London, and that East Anglia (which she called East "Angular") was overseas.<br>  <br>  The mind boggles.<br>  <br>  EDIT - Eddie, she was in Series 3, won by Kate Lawler, Jonny came second, Alex came thrid, and Jade came fourth.|`|57edf00d97af522b314c33475bf1e853aa	i don't know where u got ur information from!<br>  But she's not filming her death on Tv,Max Clifford has already sed on Sky News "That there's noway that she'd ever do that"<br>  As for the "Charity thing"Charity begins at home...her kids come first,i think everything shes doing is perfect,shes thought long and hard about all this and shes very right to do the best for her kids,i'd do the same thing for mine.|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	I feel the same way. Seeing someone die is not pleasant. My uncle died from a Massive Heart attack in the passenger seat of my father's car, I will NEVER Forget it. I would not have the heart to video tape it for anyone to see either! What if she doesn't go peacefully, are they going to cut the film?? Raising awareness for cancer is admirable, but not to film your own death. I couldn't agree with you more.|`|73f4817c9af75121ee93853e03437fc1aa	I didn't even know who this woman was before today (from what i've gathered, she's a British TV star?)   At any rate, perhaps she IS thinking about her kids and their future, which is why she's doing this?  Right or wrong, who cares - she's leaving this earth soon from the sound of it, and those children will be motherless - all because she didn't know about HPV.  What's disgraceful is that her imminent death could have been prevented.|`|3qLIRorjaa	Some things should be kept private and not shared with the world and that, for one is something that shouldn't be shown!|`|HnNJAJeJaa	They are not going to film her dying,Max clifford said it wasent going to happen...

iuwLHT2Taa	For me it has shown us the reality of life in India.I never knew most of the children were like that, and it has touched my heart literally. The movie has opened our eyes in new ways we could've imagined.|`|nKg3mhR8aa	this movie has won eight Oscar awards but film makers has forgot to see there are millions of such kids whose childhood is lost in poverty. filmmakers have only thought of their film they have nothing to do with rest of homeless children. If they had done something for those children then it would have believed that they had won all awards in realty.|`|TWS2E6rxaa	Acutally I feel uncomfortable but I still feel it's a good film. It gives us a unknown life in the world.|`|lqxvFZueaa	how were they exploited?|`|AA10881156	Whether there was a film made or not, the conditions were not created by the film company......they were just reported. The actors working on the film are being paid and I doubt if they will continue to live in the same area(s) as they are getting quite a cult following. The two poorest members of the cast are being placed in school and will have their compensation paid when they turn 18. Here is a comment by Danny Boyle (the director):<br>  <br>  About the child actors he said: "The two kids from the very poor backgrounds, we've put into school. They are in a school now, and they have been in school since June of last year. Because they have never been to school before. It's amazing watching them grow now. Our plan is to keep them in school until they are 18 and when they reach 18 there's quite quite a large sum of money that will be released to them then. Because if we give them a lot of money now you know, which the film could afford to give them it won't do anything it'll just vanish, " said Boyle to a an attentive media audience in Madrid's Ritz Hotel.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.samaa.tv/News5798-Danny_Boyle_says_two_Slumdog_Millionaire_child_actors_will_be_looked_after.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.samaa.tv/News5798-Danny_Boyle...</a><br>  <br>  Imho, this film has provided an opportunity to a group of people who previously had little (or no) opportunity. I think it is/was important for this story to be told.|`|m3jhPllTaa	But dont you also feel that the movie finally opened the worlds eyes to the problems that are facing those people?<br>  The book wasnt written with the intention of making a movie and making money.It was to relay the story of real people.<br>  In seeing the movie you become aware of the horror and might be moved to help within you own personal capacity.|`|R7MD0WByaa	They are calling attention to important issues.  So, no, I don't think they are being "exploited" to make money. <br>  <br>  And for the kids who starred in the movie (little Jamal and his brother), they are paying their way through school for them, and have setup private investments for them that they will have access to when they turn 18 (I read this in an article).

I never have.|`|RFGGBtp5aa	errrr!<br>  <br>  to be fair i am very judgmental sometimes and something like that would make me think they are dirty!!so yeh i see these things all the time.<br>  <br>  the worst is when someone clearly hasn;t brushed there teeth and you can smell dogsh!t on there breath. usually history and geography teachers back when i was at school!<br>  <br>  then of course you have the people who don't wash at all, and ming of b.o!|`|gIitANOkaa	Oh yuck|`|iVC63zypaa	Eeeewww!

zovrJ0yXaa	scarface cos its over the top and way too violent. heat cos its too cool for a bunch of old men, which is what the oscar board basically is. same reason why pulp fiction never won the oscar when its clearly one of the best films of all time (to be fair, so is shawshank redemption from the same year)|`|QsyEZhqwaa	Scarface, probably because it was too graphic for its time.  <br>  <br>  Heat, in my opinion, because it's a very dull film.  I fell asleep watching it.|`|0hSs6CtHaa	Because they are godawful. And all those dumbass MTV douche bag children who thinks Scarface is a good movie is a moron. That man kill a sh!tload of innocent people in his filthy homecountry.|`|9fa8d3d30827d67ed4714147b13a2427aa	Heat was not that bad...... but Scarface was terrible.|`|tuvcxnJXaa	I'd say a lot of it has to do with timing.   Look at the time of year when most Oscar-nominated movies are released : it's almost always after Thanksgiving.   Both of those movies were released earlier in the year ('Heat' was a summer film, if memory serves).<br>  <br>  Some will argue that the movies were too violent for consideration.    That argument doesn't carry any weight, IMO, because they gave 'The Departed' a (well-deserved) Best Picture Oscar, and it was just as violent, if not more so.|`|9bbda51d0fa9171f8b54abcba95b5f95aa	because both were so-so at best. Scarface has become a kind of cult classic but lacks any real value and Heat was just boring.

PyAgEejnaa	Maybe because she was happy her son was fine after all...and she wanted to show her gratitude...I mean she just went thru a big scare, and she wants to be near her son because she almost lost him--or thought she did.|`|9teAbDMJaa	It's most likely that she felt worried for her sons safety, so she wants to be near him to remind herself that he's ok. <br>  And she wants the son to be calm. He doesn't know what happened. So, mommy sitting next to him, hugging him makes him feel good, and know it's not his fault that he was left.<br>  Sign of closeness, really.|`|u2lYbPT2aa	SHE SAT IN THE BACK SEAT WITH HER SON, BECAUSE HE WAS ALREADY THERE, AND THERE WAS MORE ROOM,AND SHE DIDN'T WANT TO GET HER SON MORE RILLED UP THAN HE ALREADY WAS!!!  Sorry...my caps were locked!!<br>                          xoxo agoodgirl_msj|`|0O3JvmE7aa	I think she did it in order to confuse you as to her motives.<br>  <br>  You would have known this already if you knew that there is a camera inside the TV so that the people who live inside there can watch us too.

Wont speak to her Dad because he cheated on her Mother but her man cheated on his wife with her. And all those children that she drags all over the world with her. Hard to say mean things about her when she has saved all those children from a life of poverty but perhaps she should give them a little stability. <br>  Madonna - for about a million years it seems she has given every Italian woman a bad name. Just nasty!<br>  Sarah Jessic Parker - how she ever got on tv is beyond me.<br>  Beyonce is getting annoying now. Ok we get it you have a butt and you are so fine. Please get over yourself.<br>  Danny Bonaduce - Oh my he was bad as a kid but now he is excruciatingly bad. That voice! That gross body he thinks is so ripped.<br>  Tom Jones - sorry Mom I know you loved him back then but he is older than dirt and still pretending he is God's gift to women. And he has a tongue ring! I have nightmares thinking of it.<br>  Hugh Hefner - hilarious little man who actually must think we believe he is getting it on with those 3 women. He can barely walk. Poor Holly I dont blame her for getting out. No fun being an old mans nurse if you arent even the only one. <br>  And speaking of being an old mans nurse. Anna Nicole Smith. Her claim to fame is being a gold digger and not knowing who the father of her daughter is.

It is one of the most over-rated movies - a sheer Public  Relations, advertising and marketing success. It surely did not deseve all the adulation at Oscars.<br>  That besides the point, your point about story not being realistic - you have to come to india to see that it DOES HAPPEN. There are so many rags to riches stories and within the same Slum - Dharavi, shown in the film, there would be atleast 100 cases of boys becoming millionaires - not necessarily through TV shows, but in business or otherwise.<br>  On the acting front - almost all the artistes except two - Anil Kapoor (Who acts as the TV host) and irfaan Khan (Who acts as he Police inspector) all artistes are amateurs and actually live in that particular slum.<br>  SlumDog is a Good piece of Cinema - but not GREAT!|`|76140b1733cd124dbe960a504bc06f8daa	For heaven's sake, get real.

"<br>  The maker was Tootal.<br>  See how memorable that advertisement was  -  it was certainly decades ago, and I've never forgotten it.

t2evcVVEaa	you seem very frusterated with boy bands. simple. they got popular because they were very melodic and charismatic. but once they got older and the fakeness of it all started to show, they died off. they will be  back. history always repeats itself. im assuming you mean bands that just sing and dance. because if you mean the true meaning of boy bands, then it never died. the beatles were a "boy band" and the jonas brothers are a boy band. why did hair metal die out? became cheezy and lame. why is rap and hiop hop dieing out? because it lost all relevancy to our modern culture.|`|68ZN14lpaa	You know, I have no idea. Maybe because little kids are growing up too fast these days so when they're 8 years old they're listening to 50 cent and all those explicit rap artists. The Backstreet Boys made 3 comebacks.

Leda2ha0aa	I have to agree with you.  I like when comedians are the hosts, but they were trying to change it up this year and make it more intimate (hence the audience basically sitting on top of the stage).  I thought Hugh Jackman did a decent job, but by 10:15 I had to turn it off because it was so boring. <br>  <br>  I TIVO'd it and then fast-forwarded to the last 15 minutes for the "big awards".  Barely anyone watched last year and the ratings will probably be down this year also.  I think the general public just gets sick of hearing these "stars" toot their own horn, open their mouths and say things 1/2 the population doesn't agree with, and just make themselves seem so special.  It gets a bit nauseating.  <br>  <br>  About the only thing that caught my interest was when Jennifer Aniston had to stand on stage in front of Angelina Jolie and her ex Brad.  That had to of been uncomfortable.|`|nKxQLZr3aa	they were okay, kind of on the boring side but i loved the opening Hugh did, it was so good and funny :)|`|TUiT6uhpaa	Yawn City!|`|ztllWXy3aa	I lost interest right after it started I 4got what time it came on thats how much I was in 2 it =] but I wanted Taraji P.

I3qmTqa5aa	I believe designers send them clothing & such.  That's why they mention the dress, suit by so and so, shoes by Jimmy Choo, etc, Jewels by Fred Leighton, etc.  Some have stylists, but I guess a lot of them want to go and push the fashion envelope & end up in a fashion "don't " instead of a do!|`|bltgAc9Maa	I agree. I always hate it everytime I see a star receives a "best dressed" nod when we all know that it's all because of their stylists. Separate them away from their stylists and they all are fashion rookies just like any other normal people, only with more money.

We'd talk on msn for ages,there was nothing between us apart from friendship but for the first time ever in my life  i really wanted more.<br>  <br>  To cut a long story short,i eventually told him how i felt, how strange the circumstances were of us meeting and how alike we were in every way.So we fell into a relationship,both of us thinking it probably wouldn't last.We exchanged photo's - finally - i mean his personality had won me over completely - i really didn't care what he looked like but when i saw him- omg he was the man i'd dreamt about- he has the hair,the eyes,the mouth, everything i'd ever wanted.<br>  <br>  It's a long distance relationship,i'm English,he's American - but it works.We get together when we can, and when we can't - thank God for the internet and the phone.We've been together 3 years now,are happily engaged and still madly in love wth each other - so all i say is hold on to your dream - because trust me - he's out there.<br>  <br>  Lol sorry if i bored you =)|`|efvHNxN0aa	girl... i hope i have that kind of guy like that but sadly destiny doesn't  like me <br>  <br>  *sigh* well i guess its just all fantasy|`|tCpBJynXaa	get going with a real person!!!|`|tKTE2xxpaa	want some snort too|`|T6g8O3VNaa	Not sure I totally understand is it like a fantasy guy?<br>  I have a real one who does that to me my husband!|`|ybtOvNs7aa	and im shahrukh khan in ur song... aa gaya :) jk...<br>  <br>  hota hai jab zyada hindi films dekhte hai to aisa hi hota hai.. :D|`|Q2xeHOVSaa	nah!

k03dYskYaa	I like to have a balanced view of money. It will come in handy, but the attaining of it is not my primary objective in life.<br>  "Wisdom is for a protection [the same as] money is for a protection; but the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom itself preserves alive its owners." -Eccl. 7:12<br>  <br>  Money is not the root of evil. The LOVE of money is the problem.<br>  "For the love of money is a root of all sorts of injurious things, and by reaching out for this love some have been led astray from the faith and have stabbed themselves all over with many pains." -1 Timothy 6:10<br>  <br>  Edit: The Bible says the "love of money". Not money. So the Bible is right over you or any other human. How hard is that for you to understand?<br>  Think of the many types of crime that find their roots in human greed and in an inordinate love of money: theft, extortion, blackmail, yes, even murder! <br>  Money can be put to good uses also. It's not evil to give money to a starving person, or help someone.

That hospital had a separate building for mentally disabled patients. One nurse were walking in lawn of the main building with mentally disabled person. He got one ball as children were playing & he never ever ready to return but nurse suddenly pulled & gave to child. I went to that nurse & asked why HE WAS ANGRY & she said for this & that, I went to market & brought new ball & gave to him but after taking he slept me & laughing.<br>  <br>  I was normal & thought that he wants this ball before so he wasn’t angry as he also wants to play.<br>  <br>  We have to respects for those peoples.<br>  <br>  Bye & Tc<br>  Mayank|`|2mlHf7Opaa	Yes.  My mom's friend's daughter.  She was a year or two older than me.  I was acquainted with her younger brother, though we weren't quite friends.  He got into a lot of fights at school, because he had a zero tolerance policy on people making fun of his sister or the mentally disabled.  I found him to be a tad aggressive and confrontational, even on the best of days.  Tragically, she died in her late teens.  I think it had to do with complications associated with her disabilities.

Something as simple a 5.1 sound has massively increased the realism in most of those games you mentioned.<br>  Simulators such as Microsoft Flight Simulator are very popular and realistic and will continue to be.<br>  <br>  I personally already like a good game better than a good movie. <br>  <br>  Plus, Nvidia and ATI will continue to flourish.|`|OYDfF3W9aa	they would probably stop working on graphics and start working on game play like improving the amount of enemies at a time, varieties of maps, weapons, characters, because their graphics are already really realistic<br>  but of course they would improve the graphics a little bit more on the next generation but they would focus more on game play<br>  lots of the classic games like fable, gta san andreas, red alert 2, were better then their sequels mybe cuz the developers wasted too much disk space on graphics engines rather then gameplay<br>  i really had more fun with the games on ps2 more then the ones i had with xbox360<br>  dont ya think|`|MIw3GCJyaa	Unless the terrorist's get us all first! <br>  <br>  I reckon full immersion into the game.

CL5kLE2paa	ok, so Jade Goody is ill. so are millions of other people, but they don't sell their soul of a bit of publicity.  I have never liked Jade Goody and I'm not going to be a hypocrite and suddenly like her because she's ill|`|hBmafVYoaa	Miffed is the right word. Don't get me wrong I feel for her so much. But i do think it's very unfair on the millions of people living with cancer that don't get to raise money for their children because they are not famous. Many of my chemo buddies are struggling to pay their bills let alone be able to provide for their children. One friend in particular is paying privately for a drug to prolong her life which is costing so much, yet in scotland it is free. I just think there should be some perspective here. I don't think the media are portraying this correctly either. It all seems a little two faced too. The papers slated her whenever they could and are now acting so hypocritically. I'm sad for her and everyone else with cancer. Thanks for the thumbs down people. Really nice and supportive|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	Yes, I agree with you. And not for nothing, but nobody wants to watch people die. Have seen someone die before, I can tell you it is NOT Pleasant. So no, I think she's a loony bin for wanting to die on TV.|`|530fc5625af617fef3f442bfdc20f598aa	The media know they can make money for a picture or a story about her...she lives i the spotlight so why not make some money for her boys in the meantime.<br>  We mustn't forget she is also highlighting the need for more women to have cervical smears to prevent cancer so she is doing a service too<br>  I am aware there are thousands of other women out there going through the same dreadful thing and suffering with cancer but unfortunately they would not make a good story in the media as they are not a known face.|`|AA11593134	yup, right... I don't understand why she is getting all the hype and stuff when there are millons more even worse off than her right now. Also, about the guy she is getting married to... I don't understand... So she would die a married woman? What's the difference does that make if she died single or married? Just a paper? And the husband? What does he get? Other women would go after him because he is a widower and he has a sad story? <br>  : (   <--- miffed face|`|aGwjf2y4aa	yeah it is all out of porportion i think it was just the initial shock of learning its now just weeks as for the wedding whats the point eh jack knows what hes doing eh!!!!!!!|`|433165e2c7b432dcd07898d64f6f19c8aa	Fortunately Jade doesn't give a stuff about your opinion.. She's doing what she can to support her childrens future because she has the means. Your mother doesn't have those same means, neither do i along with most people. It doesn't make Jade wrong for doing it if she has the means to. I wouldn't get a wedding dress free from harrods, neither would most of us, but then we're not in the public eye. Jade is. If you don't like it, don't watch her on television, and change the page of your newspaper. I've had cancer, and if i'd had children at the time and those were the only means at my disposal to secure their future, i would have done exactly the same thing and stuck my finger up at anyone who disagreed.. She's also raised awareness, since the number of women going for smears is at it's highest levels. To be honest, i can't criticise her at all. It also shows determination and a smart woman, because she is using the media for her own ends...|`|7b5d7721387ea9716cf48828f5d4cc1caa	I'm in two minds as well; i feel sorry for her having cancer (i would never wish that on anyone!) and i suppose the money will go to her children (as well as her "new" money grabbing husband) but the fact she's selling herself like this is so annoying. What annoys me more is that there are people who want to watch this whole saga! If there weren't weird, "celebrity" obsessed people who sat around the TV watching her lose her hair, cry, have chemo and probably her death, people like Jade wouldn't be so popular|`|692bd02c736c667250356635dd632708aa	if i had cancer i would do everything it took to make money for my  kids like her, its horrible for whoever suffers but that don't mean she should lose out, and lets face it statics now say that more women than ever are going for smear tests, so she has helped, i feel sad for anyone that has this horrible, disease, but all the money in the world cant help her now, but it can help her kids who have to grow up without there mom. THINK OF THIS SHE HAS MILLONS OF POUNDS AND IT STILL CANT HELP HER. nuff said.|`|MWE7rQ4Daa	Prepare for a "yahoo answer violation"<br>  <br>  I dont get it either, one minute shes hated, the next shes the most wonderful person on this earth. Millions die of cancer each year yet she is the one, who has contributed probably the least to this world, who must get paid for doing so. <br>  <br>  No dignity.|`|LOQPfbwBaa	AMEN, i think exactly the same, wow jade got cancer so have millions of ordinary people. i could understand if Jade was saying donate to cancer charities etc but she's not. <br>  All she cares is about herself. <br>  but that the society we live in. the ordinary people get nothing.|`|iBWcAw4Oaa	Jade just wants to make sure her children are well supported when she dies. what is so wrong with that? I sure if we were famous and had cancer i would do the same for my little girl!!|`|sbmzMVLraa	I think it is sad she has cancer but other people get cancer and it is NOT in the news but it is getting braining as we keep on hearing about it.|`|HEQc83d9aa	I understand what you are saying, and I am so very sorry your mum has cancer xx|`|AA11414292	Its one bloody big con to get her back in to the public good books and the stupid mugs are falling hook line and sinker.<br>  They are setting you up so later when they announce a "Miracle cure the mugs will Believe it.<br>  Just goes to show its not just Jade "East Anglia is abroad Goody is not the only thick person around.|`|LF6JaH9Raa	i feel sorry for her my mama had cancer and she was only ill for 2 months so i know how jade feel i would not want to leave my daughter if iwas ill with cancer could not bear to leave her i like jade and i will miss her i feel sorry for her little boys|`|svYiQZUHaa	She is marketing her disease like Taco Bell markets Bean Burritos.|`|n13rCdZtaa	The whole situation sums up how bonkers this country is.|`|Emu6AG6caa	i agree totally|`|4277201b67af194037740747ba2be513aa	I think it's really sad for her kids. Their natural father is unreliable and won't make a good carer for them and their stepfather is a criminal. I think that they should be adopted by a decent couple who'll be able to raise them properly and with some stability in their lives. They don't need pots of money, they need a proper family unit in which to grow and recover from their experiences. Jade should be concentrating on sorting out proper care for them, not worrying about what she looks like in her wedding dress! <br>  <br>  They're the only ones I feel sorry for. I can't stand Jade Goody and I'm not bothered about her situation - plenty of people have to live with life threatening diseases such as cancer, but they just have to get on with it. My friend has a three year old who is currently being treated for a malignant tumour - I feel sorry for her. <br>  <br>  Save Jade's Kids from a fate worse than death I say! (ie, ending up with Jade's mother as their primary carer, or a gold digging stepfather, or a half baked bio father). What a nightmare for them.<br>  <br>  Also, my first husband died of cancer and I couldn't even get a local hairdresser/barber to come out to the house to trim his hair before our wedding. He wasn't able to walk up the bank to the hairdressers and I didn't have a wheelchair for him. Nobody cared or gave a toss. This is the reality for most people. Jade Goody will experience a more comfortable last few weeks than a lot of cancer sufferers.|`|A8bFosCsaa	if you were a parent you wouldnt think about anyone else but your kids.<br>  jade came from nothing, had a cr@p childhood and for the past five years, her way of making money is throught the media, its what comes natural to her, you will make money doing whatever comes natural to you too, this is just her way.<br>  yes people all over the world die from cancer and dont get the attention she does, because they haven't been in the public eye so we dont know them, but even though we dont know her personally, we still know her since she was 21 and to go through this so young and with 2 young kids is even worse.<br>  you hear of stars, suddenly dieing, but in a way this is good for her, she knows she hasent long, she can get married, christen her kids and plan her funeral the way she wants so i support her all the way|`|e8FiZHkRaa	Sorry to hear about your mum. The fact of the matter is though, Jade's famous. If she'd never been on Big Brother, she'd be treated just the same as everyone else. I suppose all this "free stuff" is out of pity really. Harrod's gave her a dress because they felt sorry for her, Sugababes played for free because they felt sorry for her. I understand how she's trying to make as much money as possible in this short space of time so her son's have everything they need but it's beginning to get a bit out of hand now. This is probably the best thing that's happened to her and it's an insult to other cancer sufferers because they don't get a second looking.

3890f326e072192e79ea3f718551dfb8aa	I think many of them prefer to be called film reviewers because 'critic' automatically makes you think they are going to have bad things to say. <br>  <br>  That being said, a 'film critic' is anyone who reviews movies for a publication. If you follow specific publications or tv programs, you'll notice that they usually refer to reviews from one specific person. <br>  <br>  The 'critics' who gain some measure of fame tend to be very knowledgeable about movies, both past and present. And they tend to have a style to their reviews that makes them interesting.|`|dpSTgytfaa	you ever read a movie review?<br>  <br>  thats who does the reviews.<br>  <br>  and they are called that because they can really put a lot of insight into rather or not a movie was done right|`|AA12397532	As the name implies - they critise every movie and rip it to pieces. They are arm-chair commentators, who perhaps would not kow which side a viewfinder of the camera is and which side the lens.<br>  Some critics however, as is the case always - are exceptions.They are highly informed and know the art, craft and science of cinema. rest all are a rag-tag army, trying to bull-doze film-makers and audiences alike - and both ignore their opinions. Mostly films which have been highly criticised by the so-called critics have always been box office successes.<br>  Come what may - let us admit that, Cinema is a commercial art. After all the film maker has to recover the huge investment he has made in producing the film. He cannot not survive on good reviews alone - he needs audiences too - good, bad, indifferent - as long a they pay for ther entry ticket to the cinema hall.

It's the number 1 comedy/romance anime in japan.<br>  <br>  at least that's what the advertiesment on tv says =x<br>  <br>  anyway if you do want to watch this and when your searching for it, be careful not to mistake it for the real-life drama serial based on the anime because it's well, a drama o_o.dont't think you want to watch it|`|pfeGz0PHaa	School Rumble is both funny and romantic :D it's awesome. there are a lot of misunderstandings and it's really hilarious. then there's tokyo mew mew which is also kinda both but I'd say more romantic. it's about a few girls who get powers because of a genetic weapon. the main character loves this guy but is shy and then there's this other guy who tries to win her heart :D Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle is romantic but not so funny. it's a crossover from clamp.  alice academy is both.  hana kimi is also both and it's a genderbender xD you haaave to try orange planet!!  hope you find something!<br>  <br>  p.s. the one anime is called 'azumanga dayo' (you know, from the 'goddess'lady who didn't know how to spell it xD)|`|6qDhXpWfaa	I've watched 6/7 of the ones you listed and they're my favourite =D You'll definately love these:<br>  <br>  Honey and Clover - very sweet and funny<br>  <br>  Nodame Cantabile - it's about this quirky, weird funny girl that falls for the most popular guy at her music college. It's SO funny and cute.<br>  <br>  Aishiteruze Baby - It's about this highschool guy that ends up having to take care of his baby cousin who's about 5. It's so funny how she acts and how he reacts =D There's some romance too.<br>  <br>  Earl and Fairy - guy reminds me a lot of Takashima from Special A<br>  <br>  Skip Beat - very funny and very good <br>  <br>  Gakuen Alice - it's very cute, funny, and sweet at times too<br>  <br>  Peach Girl - more romance, but def. some humour too<br>  <br>  Vampire Knight - definately go for this one! It's not as light, but it's kinda similar to fruits basket since it's a love triangle<br>  <br>  You can also try:<br>  <br>  La Corda D'oro<br>  Nana - loads of romance. probably best romance ever, but not very light<br>  Paradise Kiss - same author as Nana<br>  Natsume Yujincho<br>  Clannad - girl a lot like tohru and it's really funny, except it's more guy oriented|`|1ZWncJviaa	I've found Full Metal Panic! pretty funny and it does have light romance.

VLRkJOOuaa	Disney is a mass-media incorporation that is owned by one of the oldest, most prominent television networks to date. It has had control over the TV industry from its humble origins.<br>  <br>  <br>  The Walt Disney Corporation owns many channels that are all well-known in their field.<br>  <br>  At this point, hardly anything can lead to their general demise.<br>  <br>  However, I think with this overly produced teens coming out, the media will get tired of these little teen boppers and hopefully get very annoyed by them. Disney is investing a lot of their money into kid stars -- particularly with new shows and music singles.<br>  <br>  For more information on the Walt Disney Company:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Di...</a><br>  <br>  They really are huuuge!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I hope their long reign of the entertainment industry soon ends.

ce83aaa18b48dd89e8f2ce5b7f9d7885aa	Who will take over of Buffet? Kind of like who took over for the Beatles, Zeppelin, Clapton, Hendrix, or most other artists of that time. they were, and still are very individual. A lot of the new stuff sounds so much alike that when they are gone, they won't be missed. But the artists for Mr. Buffet's era were so individual that there just won't be another like them. I mean, come on, Jimmy sell out EVERY SHOW, EVERY TIME and only had 2 hits. Can't say that about too many others.|`|t2evcVVEaa	hi. im a record producer and id like to answer your question. Ive worked with jimmy before. and truth it, while i dont listen to him everyday, there is simply noone who can replace him. i mean, there are argueably tons of artists out there that make you just want to chill on a beach. The reason Mr. Buffet has withstood the test of time is that he is timeless. I certainly hope for the sake of the music industry that someone steps up when Jimmy steps down.
ce83aaa18b48dd89e8f2ce5b7f9d7885aa	I love these answers! One has been fixing them since he was 8. And neither one can spell solder. It could be the switch like answer 2 said. Is it just in the position that has the middle and bridge on? Or is it in the middle position that has all 3 pickups on too? If it is just in the one switch position, I'd be inclined to say switch. The 5 way switches are not too expensive and if you have any soldering experience you could try to replace it yourself. The problem with working on a stratocaster is you have to take off the whole pickguard to get to anything. And to do that you almost have to unhook the input jack so you can get the pickguard into a position to be able to work on it. You might be better off to take it in and get it fixed by a qualified tech.|`|LIyqb5Rwaa	It sounds like there is a short somewhere.  Especially if this just started happening out of the blue.<br>  <br>  Since the bridge and mid pickups work fine by themselves, I would lean towards an issue with the 5 way selector switch as the source of the short.<br>  <br>  Maybe a broken solider joint or a corroded contact?<br>  <br>  You can try spraying the switch with a bit of contact spray and flip the switch back and forth a few times.  Otherwise it's time for a trip to the guitar repair shop, and let someone check everything out with a meter.|`|WuHVJQzVaa	rewire it.. and by that i mean really just re salder it

So now, Yoichi must leave the tranquility of his remote rural mountain life and move to city to live with his fathers friend's family to continue his studies.

God refuses to allow this, so he sends his angels to the past to kill Sakura before he can do this. But one angel, Dokuro-chan, decides to try to change the future without killing him. Problem is, Dokuro is very temperamental, and is constantly killing Sakura (and lots of other people too) in incredibly bloody ways with her giant spiked club.

He is not interested in the commotion around a UFO filled with beautiful alien females that crashed on earth a year ago. The aliens, known as DearS, are deciding to take permanent residence on earth. What no one knows is that these aliens are a slave species whose sole purpose is to serve and please their masters. One day, Takeya spots a person shivering behind some bushes. This person, Ren, is one of the DearS, and after being saved by Takeya she chooses him as her master. Takeya, who doesn't know about the master-slave relationship of DearS, tries to learn Ren the normal lifestyle of the people on earth, though he constantly fears that Ren is an evil alien who's trying to brainwash him. But Ren isn't like other DearS. She is in fact malfunctioning and is being tracked down by their leader.

The core meaning here is how God is all-knowing and always bestows His subjects with mercy and prosperity and peace, when they seek His shelter through sincere and heartfelt prayers.<br>  <br>  I think it's one of the best songs ever to come out of the Indian music industry. Simply great!

He grew up in Spain and was in a university there shortly before the Spanish Civil War broke out in the 1930s. While at the school, he became a part of the "Generation of 27," a group of young artists, poets, filmmakers - creative types who would go on to create good works of art.<br>  <br>  One of those artists was the poet Federico Garcia Lorca, who - yes - was gay. He is also one of the most influential poets of the past century - not just of Spain, but overall. When the Civil War broke out, Lorca was killed because he stood against the fascists.<br>  <br>  It is known that Lorca was attracted to Dali. And it is known that Dali was close to him - at least on the friendship level, and quite likely more. However, it is also known that Dali did not have, oh,  how to put this ... a normal sex life. In that, he didn't enjoy physical contact with others. He did go on to get married, but it is believed by many historians that they were not intimate with each other.<br>  <br>  Anyway. A mutual friend of Lorca and Dali, Luis Bu?uel, worked on a movie called "Un Chien Andalou." It was released in 1929 and to this day is considered an important film - not because it has a good plot (haha!) but because, well - maybe because it doesn't. Have a plot. At all. It's random symbols and imagery strung together leaving you to wonder what's it all about.<br>  <br>  Lorca thought he knew. Andalou (or Andalusia in Spanish) was the region he grew up in, and "chien" is French for "dog." He thought the movie was about him, and that his former friends - including one he was in love with! - were publicly ridiculing him. <br>  <br>  Set aside whatever you think about homosexuality - can you imagine what that would feel like? <br>  <br>  Whether that's what "Un Chien Andalou" was about or not, Dali and Lorca grew distant. From accounts I have read, it seems like the painter carried around a lot of regret for what happened between the two - or maybe regret for what did not happen. He talked about Lorca shortly before his death in 1989.<br>  <br>  So, with all that background in mind, I myself cannot wait to see this film (its release has been delayed until May 8).|`|FW0iLLKXaa	These crazy Edward Cullen fan girls...|`|jk7vPB8Laa	WAT?

AA11656797	This song has caused a scandal because it glamorizes pedophilia and incest. Charlotte, who then was twelve, sings ambiguous lyrics seeming to refer to a physical love between an adult and a child. In addition, the relationship between the two singers is the same as the protagonists of the song, which led to suspicions on the autobiographical nature of the work. Serge Gainsbourg denied these allegations in the media.|`|brSfRLspaa	what? add more details in better english

6Fuh3iqIaa	I think DC produced more quality movie compared to Marvel. I mean both Fantastic Four movie is terrible and Spider Man 3 isn't that great compare to the previous two. DC movie is more dark and matured while Marvel is more appeal to the audience. I think DC has a trouble with their exaggerate superheroes because lately they are focusing on more realistic movie instead of coming up with their other popular superheroes. Only Batman gets the spotlight. I'm not sure what will happen with the reboot of Superman. Hopefully it will turns out alright. I think Marvel will tops all DC movie with The Avengers movie. Its very interesting to see they are building up their movie with a hint about The Avengers movie. Blame it on DC because they took a long time to produced JLA movie and keep postponing the idea if they are planning to do the same thing people will accused them copying Marvel.|`|KwpDdKIeaa	I think they'll both do well people will see all those movies so I think both companies will win.<br>  <br>  I sceptical that they will eever find an actress suitable to play wonder woman, and Batman 3 won't recieve the same praise as the Dark Knight and the press will want to tear it apart. I can't see anyone who isn't a comic fan wanting to see Green Lantern or Captain Marvel, and I can't see Teen Titans working because I don't think people will get Teen Titan I'm a comic fan and I think it sounds too comicbooky <br>  <br>  Most of the marvel movies seem like they would work because they are based on stuff people have seen in other movies and DC seem like they are just making stuff to rival marvel.|`|x30Pwy6eaa	Quality over quantity, Marvel will produce lot more, but DC is gonna make masterpieces like "Dark  Knight".|`|xPy6ZePkaa	According to many different sources. The 'experts' are saying Marvel is going to have the bigger year. I'm a hardcore DC fan so this is disappointing to hear.|`|6g1MUG5xaa	USE COMMAS

58UB5lqRaa	Hi this advert i have not heard , but it has been covered by many artists<br>  Robert Goulet is one with a deep voice, Tony Bennet and Frank Sinatra do it and also if it is a female version it possibly is Barbra streisand|`|MVZ6Mpa1aa	La Streisand usually sings that.
wVJ1jAyJaa	I disagree.<br>  First of all, that was just for a movie.<br>  He is an actor, earns his living from making movies and he has to change his appearance from time to time for his role. That's normal. He is not a model.<br>  <br>  Besides, he was looking good while shooting Babel or Ocean's 13 and he also was with Angelina then. That's nothing to do with Angelina.<br>  <br>  However I have to agree that he kind of changed after Angelina, but that's a good change. He's more mature and more real. Therefore I think Angelina contributes positively to his career.<br>  I kind of prefer this Brad Pitt to the previous one. He was too polished and boyish when he was with Jennifer. He was having an isolated and artificial life like most of other celebrities.<br>  But now he is larger than life.|`|48846255239e6cfd4e8b805cbae9c844aa	why do you care how he does his hair, or who he is married to? dont you people have anything better to worry about?<br>  <br>  ***in response to your additional details, I read this because you said "Brad Pitt looks really bad nowadays" I thought maybe he was sick and dieing or something, not that I would lose sleep over that one way or another, but it peeked my interest for a moment  because I do enjoy watching movies that he is in, because they are usually entertaining, and he is a decent actor.  I could give a crap about his personal life or hair color choice....|`|Bi51WJd7aa	Stop talking bullsh!t! Get over it already : he is with ANGELINA now and they have six beautiful children together. They are a happy family, just leave them alone. It sucks that you don't like Angelina and you wish he were still with Aniston but that's not how it is! Get over it! <br>  <br>  He's still hot, he's just maturing and he needed to change his look for a MOVIE ROLE!! Don't blame Angelina, that's just lame!!!|`|DtUpcdXwaa	He looked a lot healthier with Jennifer Aniston .<br>  Over the years Angelina Jolie has had her weight yo-yo up & down even to the point where she is pretty much skin & bones , I think that influences on him .<br>  <br>  Personally , I didn't think he was that good looking before this either , but he does look pretty bad now .|`|AA11218682	you're telling this guy you don't know, who he should be with. my god women need to get lives. celebrity obsession is pathetic. period.|`|2XTkSV4daa	I think he looks good, but maybe that's just my opinion. On the other hand, his wife always looks like she's smirking. Ugh.|`|S5H0NmEWaa	During the four or five minutes it took you to write this pointless question about the appearance of a middle-aged man who has changed his hair colour, seventy children will have died around the world as a result of poverty, hunger, or easily preventable diseases.<br>  <br>  Get over Brad Pitt and find something useful to do with your time which will make the world a better place.|`|76140b1733cd124dbe960a504bc06f8daa	Yeah, but being with Aniston, he was alway being seen with a washed-up tv star. Anjolina is nuts, but she's a hell of a lot prettier, even if she cuts herself and has slept with her brother. I think Brad just likes being around strange people.|`|AA11662490	I've noticed they both look more aged. but think about it . you have a dozen kids in tow and you'll look 20 years older in no time at all. personally I don't think much of either one. they are over rated.|`|qr16GzNnaa	I guess like every one else he is getting older. If he is happy with angie all you can be is happy for him. No one should stay with some one if they are unhappy with them.|`|PFSlyfKXaa	I don't really care about him.<br>  Benjamin Button was an awesome movie,I'll say that. :D|`|zYGJh5Odaa	he does look a little old sometimes maybe because he wwas use to benjamin button.|`|4472d6c8b8a41746c6129264601312c7aa	Don't know what to say, other than I gree with you!

Lqrqrzrvaa	No, he didn't have any feelings for her and never did.<br>  He was just nice to her enough to keep her close, because she was useful to him at the time; the only one who was close to Near and believed that either one of them could catch Kira and bring an end to his reign.<br>  It's possible she may have misinterpreted his willingness to communicate.  <br>  = )|`|1yYPt8tfaa	lol i love near more so i didnt pay much attention to mello sorry|`|k7H9ZUILaa	lol i love death note too<br>  but i dnt really like the anime<br>  and this isnt really answerin ur question but anywayz<br>  i love the Live Action Movies<br>  hve u seen em?<br>  u should theyre much better dan da anime<br>  lol<br>  sry this isnt really answerin ur question =)|`|yg493xNkaa	I got the impression that he was completely uninterested in her.

AYH0RPsjaa	I am drawing the line, enough.  First myspace then Face book, I really do not care what the people i went to Kindergarten are doing every minute of the day or what someone I am a casual acquaintance with did on Friday night and to see pictures of them in some club, WHO CARES, I also am not so desperate for popularity or acceptance that I have to show people and tell people everything about me show them pictures of me every minute of the day etc... I think it is just a way to extend hs.  Well I had a good time in hs but it is over and that is fine w/ me.  I have no need to compete or play "who is the best looking, has the most $, most friends,".  This is a constant aggravation to respond to people I really would have not missed seeing again and now I have to act as though we are best friends.  A complete hassle I have no use for.

First I had to carry a pager for work.  Then I was required to have email at home (which meant buying a computer before I could afford one).  Then I was required to check my email daily, then expected to check it several times a day.  Now I'm expected to carry a cell phone and to keep it turned on 24/7.  Pretty soon I guess I'll be required to get a blackberry.<br>  <br>  Ever read Future Shock by Alvin Toffler (1970)?  He was right.  Since I read the book, I haven't resisted the technology, but I still resent it.<br>  <br>  And like you, I don't want to know if someone is driving their car, watching a movie, or going to the bathroom.

They couldn't be more wrong.|`|y3Yu3DCDaa	nah, i don't think that's true. people say i'm beautiful but i have more femal friends than male ones. more females say that i am beautiful. only older male say i am. <br>  one close male friend says that the guys are kinda scared to be too friendly with me in case i turn them down. =s not true|`|4Q4dZJHpaa	I think this would be a bit more for girls than guys(not always!)cos they get a bit jealous when thier hot friend gets all the attention.they might even smile@each other n exchange a few compliments but really there thinkin I hate that bi**h!most guys are straight up with each other,if they dont like you its cos they dont like you,not cos your better lookin|`|sbmzMVLraa	Because they think they are the best when they are actually not and they can be bit*hs to other people so that is why they have not many friends.|`|pjqoJtlxaa	I disagree with jealousy.

YSdwkhHRaa	There's nothing wrong with that, especially if you're happy with the way things are going for you.<br>  <br>  I'm perfectly fine being reclusive, but I have to admit that having friends and feeling popular or wanted, even just a little bit, feels several times more satisfactory than making strangers on the internet laugh at what I have to say.<br>  <br>  Love, too, is an unbelievable experience. It's something you have to experience. Don't rush it, though. It WILL happen, and you WILL enjoy it. It's like, a requirement for being human or panda :]<br>  <br>  I don't think you're being anti-social or depressing. It's a perfectly normal question to ask. I just seriously recommend living up to the social creature you said we are.|`|sw7kRBSYaa	: (<br>  <br>  things will be okay|`|4SFHGHyfaa	no one ever has.<br>  I don't care tbh. i just fill my time with video games and stuff|`|tIJCQ0XQaa	Okay I added you to my contacts & I love you...I don't even know if you're a boy or girl but whatever...haha...things will get better trust us...|`|JjU6IdnDaa	The love of self is the most significant aspect of the human condition.  prosperity, subsistence, and survival are functions of the capacity for self commitment.<br>  <br>  Love of others is a function of the demonstration of Self Love.  Explore the intellectual potential of the face in the mirror.  There is vast frontier Love rth be discovered.  Develop as sense of personal dedication  Others will mirror what you exhibit.|`|Do310qvTaa	I loves you! thats why i star'd your question!!<br>  <br>  i know how you feels :( i also have not shared in this supposed joy of love, and yet i also am rather content as is.<br>  <br>  But, as it goes... you never know what people are thinking, and by gosh i bet you have been taken notice of before! YOU just didnt notice this eh?<br>  <br>  take care, and stop thinking to much!!|`|XS3PexPIaa	The kind of people I wouldn't love are people who complain and think that their life is worse than it really is.

I don't have too many close ones. I don't need too many close ones, but there is always room for more friendship if it is something real. When it comes to love, that can wait until you're older. Right now, I'm 16 so I can honestly say I don't need a boyfriend right now. Some people feel like they need a relationship. But, I have to say, eventually I think you WILL want others other than your family, around you. If you have no friends, you have to wonder if it's you, or everyone else. If you haven't taken the initiative to make friends, it's a good time to start. Friends are really great to have. trust me!|`|W0ZsuxRTaa	whoever said that humans are social creatures was wrong.  if you say that having no one doesn't bother you, then forget everything else. you're not alone. some people are just fine without anyone and it's not sad or nerdy or defective.|`|tx0k14Xpaa	I would go crazy and commit suicide.<br>  I would jus sit there and think.. about the past.<br>  And end up killing myself.<br>  no joke.|`|hhQURRAoaa	i would feel really lonely.|`|JLrs8bxdaa	D':<br>  <br>  I would die without my friends !<br>  <br>  <br>  I'll be your friend <3|`|XYOYml59aa	maybe someone loves you from a distance but afraid to tell you because they don't want to be hurt?<br>  <br>  I myself would not be happy like that... as independent as I am..

vDGFRACaaa	Jump out of the mainstream for a second and take a hard look at The Dark Knight:<br>  <br>  Cons: <br>  -Most of the hype was generated by an OD actor.<br>  -It's too long. Especially when they stop fighting and start philosophizing about good vs evil for no apparent reason.<br>  -It's definitely not appropriate for kids.<br>  -Batman's voice.<br>  -Katie Holmes replaced by a B-list actress.<br>  <br>  Compared to Back to the future:<br>  -Hype was normal ergo people liked the movie because it was good, and not because some actor died.<br>  -Regular movie length.<br>  -Mostly kid-friendly.<br>  -Time paradox-4-dummies and other shenanigans that everyone can understand.<br>  -And who doesn't love the 50s?<br>  <br>  Also keep in mind: RottenTomatoes takes votes from everyone and reviews from a number of people and averages them out.|`|dc00e6f724cc094e75dc0475843d0e44aa	All movie ratings are based on subjective opinions.  Back to the Future was a good movie.  The best ever made, I do not think so, but it was good. Dark Knight was also good.  I do not think you can compare the two.|`|zovrJ0yXaa	its an exceptional movie, one of my all time favourites. its exciting, funny, sweet, has an incredible story, is very well thought out, its iconic. not many people would disagree with it being one of the best blockbusters ever. same with the dark knight. its not necessarily a better film, even tho i personally prefer it slightly, but it is exceptional. maybe its just cos nowadays movies need to be a bit darker and have some sort of moral struggle, but back to the future is perfect entertainment. dark knight is aiming for sumthing completely different|`|BJIo6twUaa	For the time it came out, yes its a quality movie. It was a great movie. I enjoyed all 3 of them. But if you look at the movies today and compare them, then yea, most likely might not be too thrilled about it. But for the time it came out, its a great movie.|`|vT4eybSyaa	I don't think you can do much better, story-wise, than Back to the Future Parts I and II.  The 3rd one was kind of a throw-away.  It doesn't really contain any moral lessons.|`|hQ95u9OLaa	I wouldn't use rottentomatoes.com as a source for one thing. But any list is subjective. There is no such thing as objective art. What is beautiful is always due to someone or several people's ideas of beauty or quality.<br>  <br>  Back to the Future is a quality movie. I'm not saying it has more quality than The Dark Knight-it is a different kind of quality. Amid the wacky story is a very important lesson about not letting a bully push you around. Michael J. Fox has trouble with his supposedly puritanical mother pursuing him sexually (it's not new but you have to admit, very funny), and with convincing the Doc to help him get back to the future. But the real story reveals itself when Biff is about to rape? Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover says "Hey you, get your hands off her." Biff starts twisting his arm and the look of rage on Glover's face, the look that says I've taken this long enough, is a call to arms for every nerd that ever got picked on by bullies in school. It is the one serious moment in the movie but it's all the better for the movie being so nonsensical.|`|ba52jQHyaa	Some movies are just meant to be fun.  Mind you it is more of a comedy then an action/drama.  Still, the Back to the Future movies do have a great sci-fi aspect with the concept and pitfalls of time travel.|`|EG7fd7oKaa	Back to the Future is a work of genius. IMO it is one of the greatest films ever made.|`|fTuc2rMCaa	It was a great film based on the time it came out.|`|Lv1Exqefaa	yes of course.
GkE1J8kGaa	not me :D|`|mNxm0nb5aa	F*ck you normo
bIouq64Oaa	That would be really smart!<br>  <br>  But the thing is, the teens (like me:D) would probably rather get advice from adults. I mean, if I'm gonna ask a teenager for advice, I might just figure it out myself!|`|XlhBBZPxaa	I don't know I am not a teen but I am a user on here and I like to look back every once in a while to see what the teens of this day and age are talking about|`|o0Jdcev3aa	Yeah and no. That would attract perverts, but it would also mean that adults aren't supposed to post ''silly'' questions. Everyone's different and enjoys different things, we shouldn't have these ideals.|`|kvEmiNjZaa	just as much as there should be an elderly section for all the boring old people questions<br>  <br>  a desperate section for all them desperate people coming on here asking for love advice<br>  <br>  and a stick up your *** section...you know why.|`|8mchLCQhaa	Who says reckon? <br>  <br>  I think all teenagers should be sent to an island and can return to the real world when they reach the age of 18!|`|jwvh48Raaa	Oh god yes, I just can't be myself with all the nippers about, their young minds just itching to be corrupted by my pure filth, oh woe!|`|bymxJfbtaa	I reckon|`|dPNbBd7faa	do not forget that u too was a teenage once upon a time and had had same question what they have . So have some grace for the teens|`|y3Yu3DCDaa	that'd be awesome|`|XJ0Nux6Naa	Yeah I Do, That Would Be F*cking Awesome.|`|g0Hsw2Iqaa	Yes please|`|az9IYqleaa	Nahhh it'll be no fun without the old people!<br>  <br>  lol|`|ge5x9NHxaa	That's a good idea.|`|a1gSZzoyaa	hmm sounds like a good idea to me...|`|eas7tVQxaa	nah|`|QEQmMZycaa	You mean like a little teenage cresh thing (sorry, don't know how youspell cresh!!)

I think teens should look at previously posted questions to try to find answers before asking.|`|xPXUzZiJaa	yurp....hopefully|`|ff8f1f5e6ae77b2318640fce7787a746aa	I'm thinking maybe having some "OLD" people with them might smarten them up?

It works both ways. Why do you think people say, *No good deed goes unpunished.* ? Think about it.|`|TGFc2Z6Caa	Yes, and you certainly picked the right category|`|wmBK9uASaa	I prefer bloomer loafs
lgxE5nUoaa	I found them both boring and awkward so no.|`|9rLi9pSRaa	I thought Hugh did a great job.  A little odd at the beginning when he was trying to talk to the stars but he isn't  comedian.  It was very relaxed and nice and very predictable which is always a shame.  You like a little suspense at these things.  Heath shouldn't have won the award.  That was ridiculous .  He has moved on and there are actors sitting there that would have really appreciated it.  Oh well.  There is always next year.|`|n13rCdZtaa	I always enjoy the Oscars.

L7Q84gBtaa	I would play half and half. People like to hear familiar songs, but of course you also want to get your own stuff heard. I would gauge the crowd as you play. If they look extremely bored switch to a cover or something more upbeat. I listen to a lot of live music and can tell you that most people will stop listening and start talking during less upbeat songs.|`|plhLIIeAaa	Depends how long and what your set will be. If you are playing 6 songs, mix in 4 covers. Don't use up all of your originals in the first performance.

HZxX9ke8aa	opposition is two energies crashing into each other. conjunction two energies working together.<br>  <br>  the house position very important, especially when it comes to watery heavenly bodies like moon and neptune. (like in what area of your life those emotions especially affect you)<br>  <br>  moon rules cancer. neptune rules pisces. moon is emotions, home and instincts. neptune is transcendence, ideals and dreams.<br>  <br>  in any case, such a conjunction should give you intuitive sensitivity. you are a concerned, helpful and understanding person who is very aware to emotional atmosphere around himself. your mother influenced you profoundly and you have a natural talent when it comes to dealing with women, understanding them in depth.<br>  <br>  basically, your feelings and emotional needs in harmony with your ideals and dreams. you dream what you emotionally need or you idealize the things based on your feelings. (again, see in what house they are to understand what you will idealise or need emotionally etc.)|`|g7M1DxFCaa	There are no effects whatsoever except possibly a minute gravitational pull towards Neptune.
9BbV2xqIaa	no, I'm so happy that I was able to survive with some semblance of sanity through some crap that has happened, so that is good. but sometimes I think about the bad times and it makes me sad that things like that could happen again.

Loved the new format.. the stage, the actors speaking of the nominees.|`|diTgoonnaa	I was ecstatic that Slumdog swept the awards and Heath deserved that Oscar.

It was a great show|`|AIhL8wLkaa	I felt that Dark Knight, Wall-E, and The Wrestler were all snubbed for best picture.  Me think Reader didn't really deserve a spot.

Its where alot of mainstream acts go as part of their tours. <br>  However if you prefer smaller, more intimate gigs then the Carling Academys are better (alot-  if not all of which are being bought over by 02 as well now)|`|8j70Neqeaa	if i had been 2 either of them, i could tell you.|`|eiSaaLxUaa	Brixton is better, its smaller and has a real earthy feel to it.<br>  The O2 is fab though, but much more commercial, its ok for pop acts but you don't want to be seeing some rock or indie band at a seated venue.

9rLi9pSRaa	He was a very handsome guy but hey, what a waste of an award.  It should go to one of the very alive actors that deserve it too.  At least they can enjoy the award while Heath has moved on and will never see it or is able to profit from it.  I really think a separate category should be for posthumous awards for people who did a great job and are dead and leave the Academy award for the living.  When the family went up to receive the award I had to put it on mute .  I am so sick and tired of hearing about him.  He died of an overdose.  Lets put it in perspective and not honor that behavior.  'nuff said.|`|MKrNZMVDaa	It's Hollywood!|`|AA11790156	Death involves instant saint hood for some stupid reason|`|2bf7b1928da0ba8574b96d3c8eb7ff68aa	YES...he was good, but we dont need hero worship for this passed away drug addict|`|1X8Kjdilaa	Yes|`|q1GnMRxxaa	Hollywood loves to praise losers and that was what Ledger was. I also liked JackNicholoson better as the joker. Ledger was to scary. Batman should be a family movie and with Ledger in it, made it too scary. The only reason he won the award last night was because he died at a young age. Never mind that he killed himself with too many drugs.|`|oNIIzLwHaa	i agree with your theory. but its not just hollywood. its the general public. whenever someone dies people love to just "RIP" this and that. i think they kind of enjoy being mournful or something, like it makes them feel human|`|DtUpcdXwaa	So ?<br>  Cant an actor win multiple awards ?<br>  It was the 2nd highest grossing film in film history , if the actor/s in the film didn't win awards there is something seriously wrong .|`|svYiQZUHaa	Sometimes but he was a good actor. (couldn't stand him as the Joker though.) Ugghh the constant licking of the lips drove me crazy.|`|TfijWwsYaa	I have never seen any of his movies so, yes...I have to sadly agree.|`|aBtUtnKtaa	No|`|6oHbJznXaa	i think it's a way of keeping peace somewhat (but one part i would remove from that question was when you said why is he the best actor of all time because that was never the matter)<br>  <br>  but i'm just gonna state my point as if that wasn't there because i would never stop talking about how no one said he was<br>  <br>  ok well back to my first key point.  it does keep peace because so many people are mad he got it but also so many people would be mad if he didn't.  now here's the dirty part.  he died because of a pill habbit and addiction to them and depression apparently.  that was probably caused by playing his roles and sinking deep into the dark parts of his mind.  if they just toss him aside it will show that the system doesn't mind people ruining their minds for roles then getting rid of them<br>  <br>  now his story isn't someone who wasn't supported enough so he's dead<br>  <br>  now he died and won best supporting actor<br>  <br>  that's the headline right now right?  ie that's the story people will remember<br>  <br>  here's another part of that.  his family may have felt resentment to the industry.  or the people he knew<br>  <br>  now that's overshadowed by them handing them the best supporting actor<br>  <br>  that would sum it up enough for now.  i feel i'm missing something i planned to write from the start because i was disrupted but what can ya do?<br>  <br>  oh ya i remember that point now.  this got many people who weren't interested in the award show interested.  now you'll have joe shmow who doesn't really know a thing asking about heath ledger and if he won.  or happy he won for no reason<br>  <br>  or just people who just like that kind of movie or liked him in the movie.  liked the movie in general etc.  liked batman.  that's more draw<br>  <br>  oh and also not just asking but watching and maybe starting to see some of the other qualities that they haven't noticed before.  and hey maybe now they're out to see benjamin bunton which they never would have seen before because they saw it represented on the show<br>  <br>  and it's so true.  death sells<br>  <br>  if he didn't die i wonder if jack nicholson would have been the talk.  some people would have been saying he did much better i'm sure<br>  <br>  i heard no one saying that.  i didn't even hear his name mentioned by people saying he did the role better<br>  <br>  but all i heard was see that batman movie it's the best<br>  <br>  and what did you think of heath ledger.  and these were people who had never rated things like that before<br>  <br>  death sells<br>  <br>  they know damn well he's gonna win too so they can say he played it great and know he has the support of the big award pickers.  therefor not look like they don't know what they're doing.  people go for that so much and it makes me mad|`|FClC80XPaa	I honestly think it's his untimely death at 28 years old that has people unable to move beyond this. Actors like Paul Newman and Ronald Reagan lived full lives and therefore were somewhat easier to accept. Anytime someone passes before their time I think the people left behind almost feel an obligatory need to constantly honor them, which is completely understandable.<br>  As Far as the award show goes, Heath Ledger did deserve that award, not because he was a better joker than Jack, But because he brought a different twist to the character. You aren't comparing apples to apples. They are both equally brilliant in their own right. <br>  And they didn't continuously honor him last night. The only time he was really talked about in depth was when his award was being accepted by his family.  If you noticed, when Queen Latifah was singing and they were showing clips of the actors that had passed in 2008/2009, he wasn't even shown.<br>  So I will quit rambling, and in conclusion, let the fans, friends and family of Heath Ledger continue to honor and mourn him in the way they feel necessary. And if they feel he is the GREATEST actor of all time, then good for them.|`|ba52jQHyaa	I thought Ledger's Joker was great, fantastic and awesome.  I think he truly deserved awards for that performance.  I suppose you can't give him an award without paying respects for the dead.  The loss of Ledger is harder to take because we wanted and expected more great performances from him.<br>  <br>  I think I hear what you are saying.  There are news stories that get dragged out over and over and seam to never end.  I think Ledger's Joker performance doesn't fit this category because the "hype" was limited to these award shows. IMHO|`|SpPfs3o9aa	yes,he was a brilliant actor and he played The joker very well and I was amused by it!<br>  He had to win the academy award but at all he has gone away.|`|qlh1lz4Qaa	Yes. If he was still alive he would not be winning these awards.|`|RpzzuaHzaa	can you imagine if he didn't win though?? Then the winner of the best-supporting actor would be hated to no end! his family even flew over from australia<br>  <br>  i'm kind of neutral as to whether or not he deserved the oscar, haven't seen all the other performances yet.

KMASS2Gmaa	My day sucked great big green weenies. My wife of almost 9 years got into a major argument with her parents and then the kids both jumped on her. We moved back to OH because of health issues for in-laws and to try to get the kids to buckle down and do something with their lives. Daughter is 27 and all of a sudden wants her Mom to drop 20,000 on a wedding and the boy  22 is to proud to work at any restaurant or store he wants a fast track with a major company. Personally I begin to think he realized he has a birds nest on the ground and is loathe to give it up. Any way my wife cried herself to sleep and we found out the kids have talked about our personal finances to everyone in town. I have to get along with everyone when what I want is to kick several people in the teeth. Oh well people do not want to hear me complain. Could use a little of your boredom right now though.|`|6eEkxZKZaa	it was really good<br>  <br>  Judas Rabbi came over and we had a few beers, but we got a little drunk and somehow ended up in an orgy with bienrad Tinkerbell and Slutty Pineapple|`|QwKiK85eaa	Ok I guess lol I just sat in front of a computer screen all day and I had to go to church this morning which sucked!! lol|`|F98c1ZMgaa	my day was stressful -|`|hu8o4vomaa	mine was okay|`|Amkmles0aa	sunday was a bad un tall i got a way home out of the icey rain|`|kGCd8ioRaa	it was a good productive day

AA12390047	Thank you for the warning about the spoiler alert.<br>  I heard about Cole's car accident but not that it ends in tragedy.  I also heard there's a big story involving Matthew headed this way so I doubt if he's killed.<br>  Maybe this car wreck will wake Cole up so he sees that what he's doing is so wrong.  The kid needs a therapist he can trust.  He definitely needs someone to talk to on a weekly basis.|`|XRPtuwoTaa	Thanks!  I doubt Matthew will die.  Maybe he will have some kind of physical issues, like injured leg, arm or head.  I've read that Rachel Gannon is returning, so maybe she will be there to comfort her brother.  Hank is also returning|`|mF3PsJUVaa	i dont think they are going to kill off Matthew bc they put the actor on a contract. maybe he just will get very injured.|`|7XM4QJiuaa	I don't think Matthew is going to die.|`|hFVPEkWjaa	were are u getting this?|`|dbKj55akaa	hmm...havent heard about a car wreck. thanks for sharing that, but with matthew i have no idea. maybe! i do, maybe bo thinks he was doing drugs with cole so he sends him to military school!|`|vvgC20BHaa	I hope they don't kill Matthew!<br>  But if they make him seriously ill with consequences, it would open the door for a Bo and Nora storyline!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|NGNeT3rYaa	I hope they don't either, Bo and Nora both have suffered enough! Maybe the person will be a random kid from school! I have not read that any major kid was leaving in fact I believe Eddie Alderson, Matthew just scored a contract with OLTL.
XwacWyy6aa	AC/DC are still incredible despite their age, tickets aren't ridiculously high priced, I payed about ￡45 for my tickets, the prices you are seeing have probably been bought and are being sold second hand at a massive price.

VecVZ15naa	Okay, the hardest part about answering this question is choosing which "Epic Fail" to share, because there are oh so many. But here goes.<br>  There was the time, many years ago, when I was at my favorite night club. I was nursing a beer and trying to work up the nerve to ask this particularly hot young lady to dance. I'm not kidding, she was unearthly beautiful, the kind of woman that makes you go weak in the knees. And, no I'd only had a couple so far so it wasn't "beer goggles" she was gorgeous. Anyhow, my wing-man is giving me the pep talk and encouraging me to go ask her to dance when he utters the immortal cliché "What's the worse that could happen?" "She says No? Big deal!" Well the pep talk works and I go over to this vision of loveliness and my friends watch as I discover exactly "What's the worse that could happen?". She nearly fell out of her chair she was laughing so hard. I swear it seemed like even the band stopped playing to watch as I crawled back to my table. Talk about "Epic Fail".|`|5NsgLFPRaa	Probably|`|ZsKrYCYCaa	*looks up* holy hell, I saw the whole thing! :-O|`|WHcBV7rLaa	Ahahah yes. Me and my friend tried to do a double high five and missed with both our hands by a longshot. It looked hilarious|`|6lJuKKMHaa	OH YEAH!!  So many, I can't count!)  Thank God He is SO Patient with 'me'!  :)|`|5V3K7a8qaa	My mom made pancakes once, and I grabbed the syrup dish and poured it all over my pancakes. Once I took a bite, I realized it wasn't syrup at all... it was used grease from the bacon.<br>  <br>  Another time, my BF was working outside in the sun for a couple hours, he came in the house for a drink and grabbed the jug of "water" off the table and gulped quite a bit of it down before realizing it was mixed with bleach I was using to clean the bathroom.|`|bb2c6db52d268375a8f75ea7c3169389aa	Actually, I have. I used to play World of Warcraft. There are certain instances where the team has different roles to beat the raid boss. <br>  <br>  Sometimes not everyone is prepared when the encounter happens. Everyone wants to finish the job and most people know how to play their characters well. There were special instructions for each boss. In most cases they are led by a team of skilled players.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, accidents happen and some people lose internet connections. Some might not have the plan memorized, or possibly leadership wasn't delegating responsibility well enough. In the end I think some people just didn't understand their roles completely. I think it has to do with meeting halfway and seeing how each one can compliment the other. It's how the game was designed and it does promote a type of organizational atmosphere.<br>  <br>  On occasion, it might seem like one person could have been responsible for the setbacks. I'm sure everyone's ego might get bruised at that moment, but we all have those moments. We actually called those moments "Epic Fail" in the game. It's why I wanted to answer.<br>  <br>  So yes. I was blamed at one time it may seem in the game. There were many factors and I don't know why the teamwork wasn't in tune. Was it just me?<br>  <br>  Lot's of questions come up after I decide and wonder if I wasn't pulling my weight.There is always more to learn and others willing to help if you look for them. It's a fun game but I have been taking a break from it for a while now.<br>  <br>  I still have all my old epic equipment though. lol|`|4ff0538ffb94fce7dbc8ec7b8948f193aa	I'll tell you about an epic fail that happened today!<br>  ...To my step-dad...<br>  He went out fishing and told my mom he wasn't going to come home until he caught at least one fish.<br>  So he came home about four hours later with 20 fish!<br>  They were all in the bucket with ice still alive!<br>  My mom and i were freaking out and filled the sink with water and put them in there to try and save them.<br>  Once they were swimming again, we put them back in the bucket and drove them back to the pond.<br>  My step dad was pissed ;]|`|9BbV2xqIaa	omfg, yes.<br>  in real life, I failed an organic chem course. that was pretty bad.<br>  I was IM-ing someone and I typed ":-" instead of ":->" for the yahoo IM smug emoticon. that was pretty failz.|`|KReWaGFsaa	Yeah, one of my "fail" moments was when I was at the mall with my friends, while we were walking & stuff, I TRIPPED BADLY.. on a completely flat surface.

I do this because I don't have enough information and also want the person to question themselves. It gives them something to think about whether a relationship is good or bad.

rzLGCrlfaa	well i'm a young white male (well not that young) and i love hip hop but it was not a way to rebel against my parents my mom listened to rap and alternative rock and i was drawn to hip hop because that was how i grew up i was the only white kid in limwood and i was establishing my "masculinity" at a much younger age than 12-13 and i started listening to rap when tupac was still alive i was about 5 but i do agree that their is a lot of white kids who think its cool to be from the hood and if your from the hood you know its not cool|`|1Cznz2mkaa	Pardon me, but weren't hip hop's roots in rebelliousness?  Public Enemy?  Grandmaster Flash?  KRS-ONE?  Its that loss of rebelliousness that has led to the downfall of hip hop.<br>  and no, I just like intelligent music, not only hip hop.  It seems your question pertains to mainstream garbage (ie. 50 cent, little wayne, rick ross), where all that matters to those undercover closet gays is "masculinity."<br>  F*** that ignorant ish|`|u8hsZ7claa	Yea I would have to co-sign with most of popular opinion on this subject matter...and why is it hip-hop isn't view as an art form like anything else...next thing you'll be telling me is men whom use canvas and acrylics as a means to express themselves have greater homosexual tendencies|`|KZtSpfSdaa	You might like looking over it, but rap does have potential to be an artistic standpoint. It's not always guns and masculinity.<br>  <br>  Stop trying to write off entire genres of music.|`|LLEhUtxXaa	I just like rap music no need to overanalyze that|`|F6s5kMhmaa	my thoughts are that you're an idiot.. no, really.|`|0DeCKTtbaa	i agree wit you. ur hot btw|`|l72FO4eMaa	Masculinity is usually more dominant in the black community, but I don't see the point of your question. Hip Hop was made to bring everyone together. There is no colour in hip hop music. Rap is NOT rebel music, the point you made about it is stupid, look at the whole Punk Rock scene. This was a type of music made by predominantly white males to stir sh** up in society & with their parents. <br>  <br>  One of the reasons why so many people of other cultures are drawn to hip hop is because of the "cool" imagine which comes out of the black entertainment scene. Black people have more style than the average white person, there is more style within the urban community than there is with the vast majority of suburban white kids. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://hiptics.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/kanye-west-8-15-07.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://hiptics.files.wordpress.com/2008/...</a><br>  &<br>  <a href="http://jandemessemaeker.net/music/bandimages/Kings%20Of%20Leon.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://jandemessemaeker.net/music/bandim...</a><br>  <br>  Now tell me, who looks trendier? Who has more of a "cool" imagine? I believe this is why you have say "white males" as you put it attracted to the urban scene.<br>  <br>  I kinda got off topic but oh well|`|wfZhkZO0aa	I think Cap has a very valid point.  There are several ways that you can look at this and he has highlighted one of the main reasons.  <br>  <br>  As an avid listener of Rap music and someone who also understands the Hip Hop culture (I believe I understand it well) I will go out on a limb and say that some people may listen to Hip Hop music as more of a self discovery stage.  At the age of 13, a lot of males (be it white, black, purple, or green) are looking to find out who they are.  Many studies have shown that the music you listen to says a lot about the kind of person you are.  Now, don't get this wrong and imply that I am saying people who listen to gangster rap are criminals, but in a lot of ways music can help you discover who you are.  So maybe some people find themselves in rap music, maybe some find themselves in Screamo Metal.  Some people are so diversified they listen to everything.  That tells you they are open minded.  When you run into someone who will only listen to hardcore rap and nothing else, that usual means they are trying to put on a front, or they are extremely close minded.  <br>  <br>  Music says a lot about people, and the culture associated with each genre can also say a lot about them.|`|6fxr3VBGaa	i think white kids listen to rap music because rap music is popular. rock' n' roll in the 50s was rebellious. rap is a little less rebellious because are culture has already adapt to it. in a culture where kids have computers and cell phones at 4. their own kids at 16. drinking heavy at 15. smoking at 14. watching outrageously outlandish movies at 8. for some reason rap music seems like the least rebellious thing to do.<br>  <br>  so i just think it is more to try to be cool and popular than anything. rap is kind of like the new pop if you think about it.|`|kL8BzsBNaa	You should specify what kind of hip-hop and to what extent. To associate all of hip-hop with the increase of white males influenced by black culture, when you said "asserting their manhood...masculine culture," is not only biased but it boarders racist. You should know by now that not all of hip-hop/rap advocates the most indulging lifestyle. If you go deep enough underground youll find guys rapping about making a better life for people around them.|`|CDnmuX1Jaa	Don't Agree <br>  <br>  sorry<br>  <br>  It depends on the environment :| <br>  <br>  I think the title of this question is all off.<br>  <br>  So a white man liking hip hop means he's in denial? thats crazy.<br>  <br>  <br>  Nice Question though.|`|21428fc02666515c85c83d64ffb798faaa	Cap is effing smart....<br>  <br>  <br>  I see you Nikki...|`|bribxhsdaa	(NR- You took the title out of context. People have been using Misleading titles to get people to read things since the concept of headlines began....Looks like it worked.)<br>  <br>  Interesting I can see the point you're trying to make. But you could apply that to a number of genres of music/cultures.<br>  <br>  Many straight laced kids period (Be them white, black, asian or green with blue dots) use genres or established culture to rebel(Metal, and "Jock Culture" are good ones). Irony being that the cultures in question are so easily identifiable that they're more of a clone then than when they first began looking for some way to "rebel"<br>  <br>  And to make an interesting reference. In this episode of Family Guy, Chris joins the basketball team and begins to talk differently. And Peter asks Cleveland why..<br>  <br>  Cleveland says something like "The reason you're son is adopting the mannerisms of another culture is because he doesn't know enough about his own". <br>  <br>  Whilst I don't particularly agree (Given the context of the statement)...I see the point that was being made. <br>  <br>  In short, The only reason I think a lot of white kids that age are obsessed with Rap music/hip hop culture is in a lot of cases, Hip Hop is so far from what they've come to know...They're immediately obsessed by it. And in most cases, The obsession is harmless. Although you wouldn't think it given the way some white dudes are hounded for liking hip hop >_<.<br>  <br>  EDIT - Two Dudes below didn't read the Q. The question makes no insinuations to what hip hop culture contains stereotypically. It specified masculininity and nothing else. <br>  <br>  No references to indulgence or guns...Those sounds like your own personal hang ups regarding hip hop culture.  There's nothing remotely racist about it. The question doesn't doubt Rap's artistic merit either.<br>  <br>  Penguin - I think both pictures look pretty ****ing stupid. I think the cool factor people associate with hip hop is beyond aesthetics.

cIPziIdnaa	I would have been very surprised if someone else won.  His family gave a very moving tribute to Heath.  It was my favorite moment from the show last night.|`|9ko5WUFkaa	His performance was outstanding and he certainly deserved to have it recognised.  But if he didn't win it, so what?  It's not like it's really important to anyone but his family... him winning or not winning has no effect on my life.|`|4c329e8408c04b7f8e9af53444110c58aa	I'm glad Heath won for best supporting actor in the Dark Knight.

If he didn't win, I wouldn't have been really disappointed or anything though. Having said that, I would have been stunned if he didn't win the Oscar and it would go down as one of the biggest upsets in the history of the Academy Awards.|`|BJIo6twUaa	If he didnt win...it wouldnt have bother me. I am willing to bet if he hadnt has passed away, he probably wouldnt have won. I do think a lot of the hipe of the movie came because he passed away. Its a shame, i enjoyed his movies.|`|Ta7snyIoaa	Quite honestly, I don't think there was any way he wasn't going to....I mean there were some other good ones but even the guy who was reading the winner didn't even have to take a second glance to see who won.|`|KyHYOKmQaa	I would have been really angry, he really deserved it, he was amazing in Dark Knight., and he's been my favourite actor ever since 'A Knight's Tale'. I miss him.|`|y5DAfNtHaa	I'll be upset if Heath didn't win an award...<br>  He deserve an award for his performance in the Dark Knight..<br>  everyone deserves an acknowledgment, dead or alive...|`|1498434f366a56b1b0b7643757ab51b3aa	I thought the Oscar was well deserved, however, I think he should have won one for Brokeback Mountain.|`|KyGhcrzLaa	he only won cause people felt sorry for him cause he's dead|`|zovrJ0yXaa	i would have gone insane, he deserved it cos he was simply excellent|`|yertXV73aa	Ledger deserved the oscar that he won, and it has nothing to do with him being dead. If there had been another more deserving candidate and he had lost, then there would have been nothing to say and his fans would have understood. But its good to see him get a well deserved oscar for the last outstanding role that he played.|`|5cbILl1caa	I was already upset over the Oscars...but then again the Oscars always love "emo" movies....<br>  <br>  if he didn't win my TV was def going to be shipped out today for a new screen..|`|mhm3oWm6aa	he deserved it, it was a very good job done on his part, regardless if hes dead or not|`|KIOR56r6aa	I will say, "Why so serious?"

"hi," i said. "what are you doing here?" <br>  <br>  he looked at me with a very confused look on his face and said, "you invited me here. you said the three of us were going swimming."<br>  <br>  "three?" i asked. then i saw her. his girlfriend walked in the door, dressed in a really pretty bathing suit. she flipped her hair and smirked at me. "oh, three." <br>  <br>  so we walked out to my pool and i had already been dressed in my bathing suit, so we could jump right in. my crush was the first one to get in the pool. it's not heated, so it was quite refreshing. i was next. i did a fancy flip into the pool, and my crush caught me. his girlfriend scoffed and stuck one of her feet in the pool and squealed. <br>  <br>  "just jump in!" my crushed called to her. i was still in his arms. he sat me down, and i went under. when i came back up after a minute, she was finally in, making her way to my crush. i swam faster than her and got to him first.<br>  <br>  when i got to him, he kissed me. she got out and left. then we spent the rest of the day together.<br>  <br>  then i woke up.<br>  <br>  it was a very strange dream, but i liked it. that's the only dream i've ever had in black and white.<br>  <br>  EDIT: whoops, i totally missunderstood!! never mind!|`|AfQWVlexaa	i dont really get the question.. but yeah ive dremt in black and white before (:|`|U047ZtGnaa	ya if i ate Zebra  before i sleep  that what will happen|`|xvvlYuNtaa	nope

X6rFPI2laa	The over-arching answer is, of course, to practice.  And practice.  And practice some more!<br>  <br>  As a comment to one thing you state, however, you should know that the vast majority of teachers do NOT play a new piece for a student, and there are some good reasons for that.  An important part of learning any music is "cold" reading of music scores -- depending on only what you see in a score rather than having the back-up (or crutch, in many opinions) of what you heard in addition to the score will push a student to read a score more carefully and completely.  Additionally, not hearing "how it's supposed to go" encourages students to learn and develop their interpretive skills.  Sight-reading skills will also have a better chance to develop, and those are really very important!   One thing you can do to assist with cold-reading is to grab a hymnal or songbook and play through it from beginning to end without repeating any of the pieces.  Some you will know, of course, and some you will not, and the ones you do not know will help you with cold-reading and sight-reading.  <br>  <br>  I suggest you give the new teacher a chance.  After all, you are BOTH adjusting at the moment!|`|wxXguyK3aa	The only thing I can say is practice.  I remember when I was in a situation lie the one you are in, just do whatever the teacher says, and eventually, you'll get better.|`|10mOHSZTaa	My teacher used to play pieces for me, but he stopped doing that a little while ago. It's really frustrating because it's a lot harder to figure out how to play it, but it's actually the best thing for your skills as a musician. You have to be able to interpret something yourself, and being forced to sight-read something cold is really vital. I have a lot of trouble with this -I'm a good reader but I end up playing with my ears and my fingers very quickly, neglecting the score to my detriment- but I can already tell that it's improving my skills.<br>  <br>  The thing that most improved my piano playing (and, oddly enough, the speed of my typing) was doing lots of Hanon. I have a truncated one published by the Hal Leonard Student Piano Library, but you can get the real deal published by Schirmer. You play them for the sole purpose of improving your technique, and they're simple patterns so you can focus on strengthening your fingers, keeping them curved enough, keeping them on the keys, et cetera.<br>  <br>  As for bringing up wanting to do more advanced stuff, just come out and say it. Good teachers push you to your limits, but they also respond to you. My teacher was really happy when I asked if I could maybe start playing Shostakovich (too advanced for me so far, but I asked) and if you think about it it makes perfect sense. Teachers are musicians (my teacher actually has CDs out in Europe and used to give concerts; I didn't know that until a month ago though) and musicians like being with other serious musicians. At the end of next lesson, just say, "Do you think I could start on some of the grade seven pieces?"<br>  <br>  The only way to get good is to keep on practicing. Because of my family situation I can go for a week without being able to practice, or only practice for 30 minutes for the whole week- but that 30 minutes makes a huge difference. I'd like to be spending about two hours a day practicing -and I have spent that much time and longer when the situation has allowed it, once or twice in my life- but the difference between no practice and 30 minutes of practice is astounding. <br>  <br>  Maybe try this for your fingers: imagine that your palm and your fingers are made of crystal that's almost as light as air, but you have lead weights in your fingertips. There are guns in your arms which fire bullets down to your hands, which hit the lead weights on your fingertips and make you press the keys.<br>  <br>  I don't know if that makes any sense to you, or if it will help, but it's improved my playing a lot.|`|UwiGwDGdaa	Your teacher may not be playing the 21st century pieces for you for a reason - the 21st century pieces can often lose their emotional impact if you're going off of someone else's interpretation. That's the challenge of these pieces - YOU have to form your own interpretation because they're so widely subjective to the performer. You have more freedom to experiment with them than a standard classical piece where everyone has a certain expectation of what it should sound like. <br>  <br>  Not only that, it will build your own musicianship skills. You've relied on your teacher to give you an interpretation and now you're left with making your own - which is hard to do at first. Once you become more acquainted with a piece the interpretation becomes more "clear" in your mind. Be ready to be frustrated - that's part of the journey of interpretation. <br>  <br>  Your teacher might also be hoping you take the initiative to research the piece yourself - listen to recordings of other performers, research the history of the composition, and again, build your own interpretation. 21st century pieces often have a story behind them, and, if you listen to other performers, you're being exposed to multiple interpretations, giving you the opportunity to decide if something works or if something doesn't, especially in terms of stylistic choices. <br>  <br>  You've only been with this teacher a week -  have you even asked her what goals she has made for you? She might not be giving you these more challenging pieces because she doesn't think you're ready - have you even asked her about it? You've got to communicate what you want out of these lessons and ask her the reasons behind her teaching or you won't get the most out of her lessons. If you can't understand her logic you're just going to be angry all the time and basically be wasting your money. <br>  <br>  Remember - lessons aren't about solely building technical skills, and, don't be afraid to ask your teacher about their goals for you and the reasons behind what they're doing!|`|qswrz268aa	Well the obvious answer is "Practice" which is completely true, but I'll try to give you something more descriptive. But really spending at least an hour a day on that bench will help a lot, 3 hours would be the best...<br>  <br>  Clear is hard... I had great troubles with muddiness until I learned the better way. Watch your pedaling. The pedal dosen't always have to be depressed all the way down. I think of the pedal in 4 different positions.<br>  <br>  1. The pedal is completely up,<br>  2. The pedal is just dipped down<br>  3. The pedal is about half way down<br>  4, The pedal is completely down. <br>  <br>  Most people naturally have the default pedal at 4, wich is a ton of pedal. Try to make your default about 3. When you lift pedal, make sure you go all the way up to 1, and not 2. 2 can be useful for impressionistic, or classical period music. Most pianists don't pay attention to their pedaling. <br>  <br>  Another thing that can make your music more clear, is to be more accurate. And another think is to make sure you don't depress any extra keys down while you play a note. For example if you play an A octave, you might accidentally press the b and the g, not playing the note, but just having it go down slightly. This raises the dampers on those notes, which can cause them to vibrate and produce a mush sound.<br>  <br>  To get a sharper tone, depress the keys faster, and with a more “vertical” finger. You should try some exercises or studies or etudes to get more dexterity or strength. I recommend Cramers studies, and then Chopin's etudes once you've masted the Cramer studes. <br>  <br>  About not having her play the a pieces (remember, a song must have voices, so a piano can't play a song), you should go onto you tube and find several interpretations.<br>  <br>  Well I hope some of these help... Good luck!<br>  <br>  Cheerio

Fo1Gm4Xnaa	Quadraphonic is the forgotten surround sound system of the 1970s. It was never a huge commercial success, in part because the required equipment was expensive, in part because of myriad conflicting formats.The competing formats of quadraphonic sound contrived, like the modern day recordable DVD format war, to have almost identical names - CD-4, UD-4, Q4, Quad-8. Quadraphonic (or quadrophonic) sound – the most-widely-used early term for what is now called 4.0 stereo – uses four channels in which speakers are positioned at the four corners of the listening space, reproducing signals that are (wholly or in part) independent of one another.

Quadraphonic audio was one of the earliest consumer offerings in surround sound. It was a commercial failure due to many technical problems, which were solved too late to save the technology from disaster. The format was more expensive than standard two-channel stereo. It also required extra speakers, and suffered from lack of a standard format for LP records. The rise of home theatre products in the late 1980s and early 1990s brought multi-channel recording formats back to the forefront, although in a completely different form.

Stereo has two (Left channel, Right channel) as compared to Quad (left front, left rear, right front, right rear) It was popular in the 1970's and needed special equipment to reproduce the "proper" sound, so they probably won't be any use to you on a stereo, but maybe you could coax the proper sound from a 5.1 surround system.|`|U3qTwOOIaa	quad means 4 so it means in this case 4 speakers (surround sound)|`|DnWsMhwLaa	mono is where you have one thing coming out, no matter how many spearkers, it is just the same thing coming out of all of them.<br>  <br>  stereo is where you have one thing coming out of one speaker and another thing coming out of another, this alows artists to do things like have the drums in one speaker and the singing in the other or have pans that fade back and forth between speakers, that kind of thing<br>  <br>  quadrophonic is where you have 4 speaker channels and something different is coming out of all of them, this enabels still more variety of expression in how the mix is presented, this is not to be confused with surround sound<br>  <br>  surround sound is generally defined by having at least 3 channels, one of them being a subwoofer channel. surround sound is expressed as being 2.1, 4.1, 5.1, 7.1 etc, the first number is the actual full sound channels and the .1 is to express the subwoofer channel. 2.1 is stereo with a subwoofer, 4.1 is quadrophonic with a subwoofer, 5.1 (which seems to be standard for movies at this point) is quadrophonic with a center channel and a subwoofer.<br>  <br>  having 2 speakers doesnt mean you have stereo and having a 5.1 surround sound doesnt mean you are listening to a 5.1 surround mix. the difference is wheather each speaker is programed to have different sounds coming out or the same sound coming out. there are ways to have simulated surround, in which your amplifier processes its own assumed subwoofer channel, but that doesnt mean it truly is surround.

The nominates are duly audited by a reputed concern like KPMG who reveals just he 5 top contenders in each category. Technical categories are decided by the respective trade associations - like for cinematography, it is decided by the members of ASC (American Cinematographers Association). So, Martin not getting an Oscar so far goes to prove, he has some distance to go before he can achieve the milestone.<br>  However the irony of this system is, let us say a person has performed exceedingly well in 2008, and there is another person who has outperformed him and got the award. The first person's effort has gone down the memory lane, because in subsequent years that performance will never be considered for an award again|`|dCbIHBpGaa	I know there are so many greats overlooked for the best actor..

K86A0hyEaa	Seeing as it's tings tings there certainly won't be any moshing so you'll be safe in that respect. I've been to countless numbers of gigs and always take the bare minimum, if i'm drinking, i drink before to save money as venues really rack up the prices. If the venue is far away take your phone, but if it's near don't bother as it could get stolen. If you buy merch, buy it at the end of the gig as you don't want to be carrying it around for the whole gig. Be prepared to queue a lot for the merch, to get squashed a lot in the crowd and to wait around for a long time before ting tings come on.|`|vBfbwwuDaa	Well, you take enough money for merch, food/drinks..ect anything you wanna buy... smokes if u smoke, depending on the concert.... and anything you normally carry on your person. ( cellphone, pager, I.D, ect...<br>  <br>  Seeing your 16 you might wanna stay with your friends or whom ever your going with, if you get in the mood to Mosh, you can get your adderniline pumping and be phyched<br>  <br>  I prolly didnt help you, but that was my advice...<br>  <br>  :)<br>  concerts are fun iv been to over 100 Rock/Metal Concerts. GOt knocked out in the pits a few times...<br>  <br>  <br>  O! dont forget to drink liquids it gets HOT around all thoes people and you might end up passing out<br>  <br>  Stay hydrated<br>  <br>  HAVE FUN<br>  :)|`|DnWsMhwLaa	"first gig" would be if you were playing. you are going to your first show. <br>  <br>  all you really need to bring is money. unless it is outdoors, which i imagine it isnt, given that it is winter and all.|`|wA8Dyhq7aa	Earplugs.  I'm serious.  Learn at an early age to protect your hearing so you can enjoy concerts when you're 26.  You'll still be able to hear everything.
OvrcKRQzaa	Women has various other ways of expressing.. like the eyes itself are a great way of showing love or respect to anyone .. they dnt need to play with hat!|`|jS4YILT5aa	because women are beyotches and expect to get everything in the world|`|RJyhnT8jaa	Because men are more respectable|`|7uqAS3Ozaa	men take off their hats and women pull wide their bottoms.|`|D9AUzmZRaa	Because "back in the day" when men actually WORE hats to tip, women were actually treated with respect (out in public, anyway.) And of course, once we came out of the kitchen to demand equal pay for equal work, the "respect" pretty much dissipated into juvenile men  bickering over their wounded egos.<br>  <br>  "Back in the day" women probably didn't "tip their hats" because they were too damn pooped from scrubbing your floors and washing your clothes and cooking your meals and cleaning the house and raising your damn rug rats.|`|aTvQAueWaa	Women must gain more respect from men because a man needs a women more that a women needs a man...|`|a37cc61e403f0d20764cd4a57c4b871baa	Because women are disrespectful..... lol, lol, lol|`|QS6hSdZNaa	It is chivalry men show women.....and women gracefully accept it|`|UdoLcwm4aa	Maybe they're hiding something.|`|64cUxJn1aa	Cuz it would mess up their hair? hahaha|`|XpKY04Tnaa	Biblical. I can't remember the book, chapter or verse. <br>  But here goes. <br>  I Man's head is a reflection of God and should be uncovered. <br>  A Woman's head is for the glory of Man and should be covered. <br>  <br>  That's why you'll notice in the Catholic church Priests not wearing head covering and Nuns with Habits covering their heads.|`|bc80b085beb98b92a6819181843ddbbbaa	It's a bit of a double standard, but it falls back to when women would pin their hats to their hair.  You can't easily remove a hat that is "part" of your hairdo.

0e7e2273a98e965ef6963c7287e9faffaa	Can't remember what happened in the last one!!!|`|AA12367392	What coolio said is what we say last year, there were 2 nikkis, one we have known since the beginning and then the new one who turns people to ice and shatters them to pieces, mohinda has morphed during his experiment on trying to become a hero (although his excuse was to save the heroes already empowered), but we only got about 5 or 6 episodes and it went off, I think thats when the writers striked came into it, I got a bit lost in the storyline because one minute you're bad the next your good but the company had claires father and only let him out to get sylar and peters father is back and has sucked the power out of which ever heroes path he crosses and his wife or was a badie and told sylar that he is her child was put under some spell by her husband that she couldnt move to stop him, but he forgot about the power of thought, it really is quite confusing its turning into days of our lives lol! :)  Dead people aren't really dead, and that blonde bloke that nikkis husband killed is back in the form of a ghost, hope they sort it all out cause it was a bit higildy pigildy at the end last year! :)|`|zovrJ0yXaa	strangely, even though i find the show horribly scripted and very repetitive these days, oddly i cant find anything else good to watch on tv these days. only a few years ago we had the sopranos and the wire on at the same time, now the only quality shows left are lost and battlestar galatica. heroes jumped the shark sometime during volume 3, its dead now|`|9JwjT7hlaa	Sylar kiled on the last episode<br>  Peters dad is the bad guy<br>  Hero looses his powers....so does peter<br>  Mohinder is a hedious beast creature<br>  Sylar kills elle|`|vdMUCHDKaa	yes  i cant wait. the entire show is awsome|`|AIuN5Lw9aa	yep, excited!!!!

aWEybdDFaa	Yes, simply because everything we do or say comes from our hearts, and not from our butts. The world needs more aquarius people.|`|e14b1125c91fafed4795c69469f8b509aa	For me, it depends on HOW it's delivered. If a person says it in a mean or insensitive way then yes I do take it personally. It then comes off as condescending and belittling instead of caring. Anything can be taken well as long as it's said with tact and respect.|`|B7WIZdglaa	Hmmm.. it depends how the criticism is being presented to me. If I know it is being said with love and only looking out for me- then i'm cool w/it. If it's done in a way that comes off anything besides sincere, then I do take it personally. And i'll probably beat some @ss.   :)|`|0TX93IsYaa	My birthday is Feb 5th so that makes me an aquarius..lets see.<br>  <br>  playful criticism? no..<br>  <br>  criticism criticism, i kinda learned to deal with it so i dont make it as personal as I used to..<br>  <br>  however, my feelings can be hurt really easily, especially when you take pride and are passionate about the things you do.<br>  <br>  an example would be being in love. if my girlfriend hurts me, i dont dwell on it, but it does stay in the back on my mind. although i love her and put effort in our relationship, sometimes it can hurt. i know this is general so how about..<br>  <br>  im playing games with somebody online, strangers if you will.<br>  my mind is set on defeating my opponent right? i put alot of effort into it and if i lose and they taunt me, it gets to me. ALOT.<br>  <br>  so i guess what im saying is, for me, it depends on the context.<br>  <br>  and i am in no way saying i care more about video games than my girlfriend..|`|fbc2b2e6a6fc02b61e0792cdf1538b9baa	yes i do ....i am sensitive to all comments

16t0eV0Uaa	A hard rain's a gonna fall.|`|48df0ea585c1658be36a46553408d993aa	If I were you... I'd purchase the entire Blood on the Tracks album.<br>  <br>  I understand the the ipod generation just wants to pick and choose individual songs, but in this case, I think the whole album/ all of the songs on it/ and the order they're in will give you a good introduction to Bob Dylan's most popular (IMO) music, and will make you want more.<br>  <br>  After that get Desire (the album) and then his "Essential" two-CD set. The Essential BD only has one song from the "Tracks" album and only one or two from "Desire", so there's very little repetition and it'll turn you onto his older stuff which is SO great. He inspired *everyone* who came after him.|`|S71MT9USaa	Yes, I certainly can! - Dylan spans an extremely wide range of genres and seldom performs his songs the same way - every performance is a one-off - so I'm trying to be specific to you.<br>      v SONG v                   v ALBUM v<br>  "Masters of War" - "Freewheelin' "- Acoustic but most powerful version.<br>  (Check Eddie Vedder/Mike McCready version on "30th Anniv.")<br>  "Desolation Row" - "Highway 61 Revisited"<br>  "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)" - "Bringing It All Back Home"<br>  "Foot Of Pride" - "Biograph" (check out Lou Reed version-"30th Ann")<br>  "Highway 61 Revisited" - "Highway 61 Revisited"<br>  "Maggie's Farm" - "Bringing It All Back Home"<br>  "Like A Rolling Stone" - "Highway 61 Revisited"<br>  "License to Kill" - "Infidels" (check out Petty's version - "30th Ann") <br>  "Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat" - "Blonde On Blonde"<br>  "One More Cup of Coffee" - "Desire"<br>  "Most Likely You Go Your Way (And I'll Go Mine)"-"B.

qThmcR1Aaa	It started as a file-sharing site like Limewire, but then Napster got hauled into court for making it so easy for people to steal music, and the company went legit. Now it's a pay-for-music service just like iTunes. I use it all the time.<br>  <br>  Bee16: Even if the artists don't get much, they're at least getting something. That's the point -- they're being paid for the fruits of their labor, rather than having somebody steal their work. Paying a reasonable, nominal fee is *not* the same as stealing. And you *should* care ... how do you expect artists to make a living if everyone steals their work? If they can't make a living at it, they won't keep making music, and our lives will be much poorer for it. People have to think of the long-term consequences of this stuff, not just the instant gratification.|`|EH7G8voyaa	It's the same as iTunes basically except you can pay a monthly fee and download unlimited music and things like that. iTunes has films and games etc. though also. <br>  You're basically still stealing the music anyway as the artists don't get much from the download from legit websites either. Not that I care.|`|DfDKMMnHaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  this was a platform where you were able to download free mp3 from other users - unfortunatly now closed or no longer free.<br>  <br>  Regards
xplSmeCYaa	Go to local clubs and ask some of the DJs if they know where you can get it done at and the price.|`|msNXomjTaa	I have heard that the cost of a basic CD is about $20,000.  This will depend on how much studio time you need, and so on, but that is the basic starting point.  This is why so many try doing it at home, using their own equipment and computers.

hThvZftvaa	he was involved with beth and when alan found out he gave her the ultamatium to either marry him or a tammy like affect would happen to coop and he would also take away peyton. she decided to marry him to save coop and alan called coop as he was racing to the church to stop the wedding. alan said that he and beth were already married and about to make love. coop was racing and hit ice and was in a reall bad wreck. phillip pulled coop out of the car just before it exploded and took him to cedars where the nurses and doctor just let him lie on a bed and did not to anything because they did not know who he was., finally buzz found out wat was going on and ran over to the hospital and started screaming at the docors and everything because they just let him lie there. then beth, rick, lillian and everyone else that was at the wedding went to cedars and lilian and rick went in and was helping work on coop. coop went into surgery and then we learned that he had internal bleeding and his liver was injured. he was stable. then he told beth and buzz good bye and buzz wouldnt say good bye. later coop asked buzz to tell him a nightime story like he did when he was little. buzz told him the story of how jenna brough coop into his life and how it was the greatest thing he ever recieved when coop came back when buzz had his heart attack. the coop said good bye dad and he crashed. the doctors came in and started working on him and his brain had a lack of oxygen and he was on a ventalator and buzz had to turn it off.<br>  <br>  during the airing of these episodes they showed when buzz and coop first met and when buzz sent coop to england to live after jenna died and when he came back.

I don't know, maybe he will last, maybe he won't.

It was originally called Max Crossett's X-tra Fine Salad Dressing. Crosset sold it to Kraft Foods in 1931 for $300 (approximately $4000 in 2006 dollars)[1][2]<br>  <br>  In 1933, Kraft was a well-established distributor of mayonnaise, yet sales were slipping as a result of the Great Depression.<br>  <br>  As a result, Kraft developed a dressing which possessed a taste and texture similar to mayo, but at a lower price.<br>  <br>  Premiering at the Chicago World's Fair in 1933, Miracle Whip was an instant success, helping make fruit, vegetables and salads better tasting and more appealing to Depression-weary consumers.<br>  <br>  A patented "emulsifying machine," invented by Charles Chapman, helped create a first-of-its-kind product that was a blend of existing mayonnaise products and less expensive salad dressing. The machine, informally called "Miracle Whip" by Chapman, ensured that pre-measured ingredients (including more than 20 different spices) could continuously enter the appliance and become thoroughly whipped and blended.<br>  <br>  Today, there are numerous varieties of Miracle Whip around the world.|`|n00kRXVYaa	MIRACLE whip  contains =mayo|`|JKwogCwoaa	Intervention from above.|`|jKDZlgMiaa	mire<br>  <br>  ace<br>  <br>  lea<br>  <br>  rim<br>  <br>  ale<br>  <br>  ram<br>  <br>  mar<br>  <br>  ire<br>  <br>  lire

8yE2sYGeaa	She felt she had gone as far as she could with the character|`|nFakIvgoaa	I think I read somewhere she was either pregnant or had just had a baby and didn't want to go on location to China to film the movie.

She can't fixed her schedule to do both movie so she choose to dropped The Mummy. I know how you feel.

From being a nerd in the first movie, to a strong woman in the second movie, and I don't feel the new actress nailed the character very well.|`|GQyWlbKfaa	Well its rather conflicting, some people say its because she had her baby and hence didn't want to do the film which would place in her China for 3 months. While others say that it was because she didn't like the script. Anyway, I really felt that it would have been much better if she was in it!

It's like she was The Woman to hire in LA for the longest time.. before Queen Latifah's taken 'zany black woman' in movie roles? I don't get it..<br>  <br>  A whoopie cushion has much more talent.

I do however have a problem with her bad presenting, and that of her co presenter.|`|RQfLKOPQaa	You're right, it's the parents. maybe they should teach the kids that there are people with disabilities all over the world, and it's OK to be like that.

t6k3yoNdaa	First of all, did you even see the movie? Just because the guy is dead does not mean he can't get the oscar. His performance as the joker was amazing! The whole time in the movies I had goosebumps! I mean, I do repect your opinion, and I'm not putting you down because of it, I'm just saying. I'm sick and tired of people saying the win is a sympathy award! It is not! And first of all, for those of you who said he is a druggy, and it doesn't matter. He is still a human being with great talent; leave him alone and suck it up.|`|BEfhBLb9aa	just the insensitive *** hole that can't let the dead guy have the damn award. it was a great performance and he deserved the award what a jerk|`|xplSmeCYaa	Awards shows all ways give people there honors when they are dead and gone but I feel that he deserves it.|`|EC2TSFj3aa	I can't agree with you more. Heath Ledger is a total loser. People should not be praising druggies or suiciders.|`|LPc6En8Qaa	Heath completely gave a whole new view of what the jokers is. He played the "real" joker. Exact same potrayel from the early comic books. He mos def deserved that award.  Btw he was not a druggie or a suicide.  It was a complete accident, poor choice of mixture, but an accident. Do some research, the joker is a big psychological role, even jack nicholson admitted that the character nearly killed him.  Its just a shame that it got the best of heath. At least he did not die in vain.|`|NqcnAnC1aa	No, he didn't get the oscar just because he died.  He got it because he DESERVED it.  His performance of the Joker was amazing, and if you fail to see that, then that's your own problem.|`|rHrr7zmVaa	You are an insensitive *** hole that can't even let the dead guy have the damn award.

wQoDOPbeaa	Nothing else better to do I guess. It's not like they could be at school, learning how to become productive members of society. It's happening over here on this side of the pond as well.

They wear fake gold tacky jewellery and mckenzie tracksuits, listen to the worst music on the planet and are generally rude and disgusting things that don't deserve to be called human.

I think part of it is boredom and peer pressure but kids need to grow up, they need to learn to think for themselves and not follow the crowd. The whole "boredom" thing is tired now, there is plenty to do but people just don't use their minds.<br>  <br>  It's all part the celeb following culture, not real ambition and no independant thinking. If kids read less celeb mags and stopped playing video games they could go to museums and educate themselves or get out and play sports rather than stand outside shops drinking themselves into oblivion and intimidating people.<br>  <br>  There's just no respect these days and it's also down to the parents who need to teach their children before it's too late.|`|qr16GzNnaa	I guess it is what some of the kids grow up seeing, because i have seen it and it is not only the kids do it elders, young adults and even mature ones.|`|XadHhxOSaa	chavs.... there the ones that have nothing better to do because there brought up by teenage kids as young as 13 having kids of their own and not knowing how to raise them because there kids themselves so they let them get away with murder|`|j7fzuDxgaa	chavs as they are called and most of the parents are worse and most likely think its cool for their kid to do that. chavs bringing up chavs i think|`|9TQrtSoiaa	they are chavs or neds just ignore them pretty soon they will just become a part of the background they arent worth anything else|`|pCs1dUKRaa	Generally vodka round here...|`|wmBK9uASaa	Because all the prisons are full and Australia refuses to take any more convicts|`|J9AvKefwaa	Asking you to go in and buy them cigarettes!

zovrJ0yXaa	yeah, its true, marvel studios are funding their own movies now, and their biggest project right now is releasing all the movies of the members of the avengers individually, captain america, ant-man, thor etc, before releasing a team-up movie in 2011. they already released the hulk and iron man obviously, and in those two movies htey talked about the avengers, so they have already started laying the groundwork. personally i cant wait|`|I3CNklLKaa	Well they already had a go at this with Uma Thurman as Emma Peel. Sadly it was really, really bad. I'd be surprised if they tried it again.|`|YYRb6oE3aa	My husband said that it would be out in a year or two and he is going to see on the first day.|`|kfySwy8baa	i dont think they will make one|`|tuvcxnJXaa	I've not heard anything about 'Iron Man 2' being delayed, but yes, they are anticipating a release in 2011 for the Avengers film.   I think their strategy is to release movies for Iron Man, Hulk, and Thor beforehand, so they don't have to waste valuable screen time setting up origins.|`|r9lfDeRmaa	An according to link below, Captain America is actually going to be the first avenger movie since it is so titled The First Avenger: Captain America, and also according to the link below there is going to be a live-action Thor film coming out.<br>  <a href="http://movies.ign.com/articles/911/911170p1.html" rel="nofollow">http://movies.ign.com/articles/911/91117...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  There is an imdb page for The Avengers also<br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0848228/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0848228/</a><br>  <br>  Sounds like the next couple of years is going to be awesome.

k9N6PInEaa	I thought he deserved it. He really did. Sure he died, and there was alot of hype leading up to the movie and the promotion of it BECAUSE of his death, but now as u watch the movie, u can see his amazing acting. Even if he was alive, he wouldve nailed that Oscar. It was just so great to hear him being honored for his Joker role and talk about him and the Joker role and especially his name being called as the winner with his parents and sister accepting the award. Just absolutely amazing. Heath was ALWAYS a great actor and after all his movies he was in, it shined in Dark Knight. He will always be remembered as the psychotic Joker, although to most girls, he will always be remembered as the guy from "10 Things I Hate About You" lol. But i mean the Joker role just defined his acting at 28 years old. That Oscar is Heath's in heaven..i bet u hes smilin down and thanking every single one of his fans for voting for him. Thanks Heath and congratulations, u deserved it.|`|TRrTunqvaa	he deserved it.

27a6064141149e4c067b229800e7b9ffaa	She should teach you what you want to learn, although if you can't read music you may benefit from a little while away from the grade syllabus. If you start learning it straight away you'll either learn by ear (which is a good skill, but not a good one to start with) or you will struggle trying to read and won't get very far.<br>  <br>  Having said that, if you've been teaching yourself for a while it probably won't take you very long to learn to read. Next, I'd say grade one is too easy, I'd go straight for grade two (or possibly three, although there's quite a gap between the two) - it will probably not take you long at all to learn the pieces for grade one, and so it will basically be a waste of money.<br>  <br>  As for theory that's entirely up to you. I only took grade 5 because I had to, and just picked up the theory from A-level and later on in my degree. It is good to learn the theory (and there are a LOT of musicians who don't know anything about it), but going as far as taking the test may be a bit excessive.|`|ziFMYqtoaa	Playing piano a 'bit' isn't going to get you ahead, not usually.  If you knew a 'bit' of math, the teacher wouldn't let you skip to the second grade!  Yes, you need to take Theory and Piano at the same levels.

3k2oIlPWaa	The 'foolishness' was simply her implication of the naive side of Benjamin Barker.  <br>  <br>  As the Judge raped his wife, every guest merely stood by at the masquerade and watched, let alone laughed.  They were getting pleasure out of her humiliation, and were therefore, merciless.|`|STs2ouqRaa	Well, basically, Judge Turpin caught sight of Barker aka Sweeney Todd's wife and wanted her for himself, so he made up a crime and falsley accused Todd of it so that he could get him out of the picture. The foolishness was, from Mrs. Lovett's opinion, not realizing it and either getting the heck out of town or getting rid of his wife. <br>  <br>  The reason Sweeney asks, "would no one have mercy on her?" is because at this party thing, the Judge is taking advantage of and abusing his wife, but nobody at the party would say a word against it. She didn't do anything, it's just that nobody felt badly enough to stop her from being taken advantage of. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|724Lj3TDaa	he was foolish as in like, naivety. you know..? like i dunno how to explain it...but yeah.<br>  and when he says "would no one have mercy on her?" he's referring to the judge or whoever [i havent seen the movie in a couple months, i dont remember all the characters names, sorry] raping his wife and everyone was saying how it was her own fault and stuff.<br>  <br>  hope this helps..? haha. sorry for crappy explanations. :]

4b63df522adcbbe3effabc36048eabe4aa	Never. The Government has already said that they would legalize Marijuana if they could. Although they cannot at this time until a solution is solved as to how they would tax it. They have no means or ways to tax Cannabis, due to the fact that it can be grown in the comfort of your own home.<br>  <br>  Cigarettes and alcohol have already been proven over plenty of times that it is in fact more harmful in it's use then Marijuana. Although, cigarettes and alcohol cannot be grown in the comfort of your own home. The government does not want a product circulating the streets and market, that has such a profitable value and is used by so many people country and worldwide, in which they cannot tax or profit from. The government would ultimately lose money in the production of Marijuana to the average home-seller.<br>  <br>  Yes, the government would make money, because people could purchase Marijuana at the mini-marts and various other locations, like cigarettes, with restrictions such as an age limit of 18-21, although home-growers/sellers would profit more because they can grow large amounts, mass production, harvest and clone, at almost no cost, an sell they're product cheaper.<br>  <br>  The government sells Marijuana through AM/PM for $20.00 a gram, as apposed to Joe Schmoe who harvests his Marijuana in his backyard, processing pounds by the months, selling them at $15-10.00 a gram. Who wins? The home-grower/seller. This is why it will not be legalized, until a solution is reached as to how they can prevent this. Explain to me how it can be prevented, which not even I have a solution for, then submit your idea or theory to the US government and get it legalized. Until then, you, as well as me, as well as the rest of the stoner community, is sh*t out of luck.|`|T2JlDJD7aa	Hopefully never but I hope they make killing marijuana smokers legal.|`|2p55hLjYaa	i have no idea..it mite as well be legal cuz alot of people do it already...|`|Lowgs7hraa	when there a hippie for president|`|sNBmrPW8aa	never and thats a good thing|`|IizPFrELaa	Never|`|04d81c107f433cebb6371d36ae227a9baa	2016|`|OXleDYVQaa	Sadly Never.<br>  <br>  For one thing governments can't really control it, even if they had the farms, there would always be off market.<br>  <br>  Laws governing it are kind of tied into other controlled substance laws so it would have to be a separate amendment.<br>  <br>  Governments are also pretty much "committees" too, which is the poorest way of getting anything accomplished.<br>  <br>  Many states in the USA are starting to allow Medicinal, but cheating still goes on.<br>  <br>  Check out NORML.

6rR7LTl1aa	No, you had it right with the first interpretation.<br>  <br>  She did indeed go beyond the safety limit of her synchro rate, but she faced excruciating repurcussions from having done so.<br>  <br>  Think of it as being somewhat comparable to the synch ratios in Neon Genesis Evangelion:  Shinji's synch rate with his Eva unit once spiked up to 400%, but in so doing he was absorbed into the unit itself and temporarily ceased to exist as an individual, losing his own form.<br>  The mechanics in D.Gray-man are obviously different, but the idea is similar enough.|`|IGu36Iwwaa	Synch rates are usually used in reference to nano-machine use in alot of anime so I'll try to explain it using them, a high synch rate allows greater power and ability whereas a lower synch rate would indicate that the nano-machines are not interfacing as well as they should which causes a loss of power.  The synch rate is basically the determinate of how well the nano-machines are working in tandem with ones body, if they are working in perfect tandem (100% synch rate) the body is not limited by natural muscular strength, agility, or speed, also healing speed is increased and pain receptors are blocked allowing the individual to perform superhuman acts, due to the intervention of the nano-machines.  If the synch rate exceeds specified limits it would cause an immense increase in power but burn out the individual once the synch rate dropped, muscles would tear, bones would break but the individual wouldn't notice.  This can also be applied to magic, chi, or what have you. In the case of D. Grayman the Innocence user is boosting their power with the substance, but if they are not attuned to it, it tries to reject them, if they are fully in tune or exceed attunement then their powers explode. It's really a difficult concept to explain concisely but I hoped this helped.

JAZnQJPHaa	There's a British T.V. series called "Cadfael", about a mediaevil monk who solves crime, as well as the new (British) Robin Hood series. There's a few versions of Joan of Arc which are worth while, (I liked the one with Mila Jovovich). Kingdom of Heaven was by far the best recent film I've seen, directed by Ridley Scott.

h6JJNgoKaa	Do not worry about vibrato or making reeds at the moment.   Just work on your diaphragm and your embouchure control.  As far as fingerings go start with keeping your fingers down and almost in constant contact with the keys.  Next ask an oboe teacher to show you the alternate fingerings that are available on the oboe.  Then practice , practice practice.  All scales, Arpeggios and difficult fingerings until all fingerings are smooth.  You may want to use one fingering one time and a different one another to make it smooth.  Above all have fun and enjoy.|`|X6rFPI2laa	If you get an exercise book of scales, arpeggios, alberti runs, etc., in all keys (not just the easy ones!), and play them a bit every day you will improve quite a bit.  Begin slowly and gradually increase speed.  It's BORING to be sure, but is great for building technique.  In the event you don't find such an exercise book for oboe, one for flute or violin will do, too.  The Czerny exercise book for piano -- School for Velocity -- will do in a pinch if you only read the treble clef.  If you don't happen to have a copy of Czerny, ask your friends who study piano -- piano students generally hate Czerny so much they might be glad to get rid of theirs!  (A music professor in college said that Czerny "hated little children"!)|`|09affeac55dbe7c8b68c339feb29879faa	As you advance in playing you will learn short cut methods on making the same notes with less finger movement. The reeds however are advance type too when you learn not to squeak and develop your lips.|`|eEgyo9rFaa	well, I never squeaked...even when I tried, so go you for managing that!<br>  anyway, if you want to vibrato...ugh, it's hard to explain, and exercise would be to go uuuuuuuuuuuuu, but put emphasis on each of the u's. start out slow and then get faster and faster.  Making reeds is really hard and requires a lot of time.  If you're just starting, buy the reeds and practice without focusing on that.  Get really awesome, get some time, and then learn how to make reeds...maybe learn on summer vacation.  For the fingerings, learn the chromatic scale, starting on the low C, and going up two octaves to the high C.  I warm up on it every morning and I can do it so fast, everyone calls me a show-off.  I don't try to be, but hey, if you can play the oboe good enough to do that, you can show off.  That's how I learned.

cdyqrtdhaa	I think that 3 letters of recommendation is fine. They would be more convinced if you had more people saying good stuff about you.|`|tDU347knaa	That's not too much. You'll appear prepared which shows how much you want the job and demonstrates what kind of employee you would be for the company.<br>  <br>  Best luck to you.|`|mnQXmZbeaa	its better to have too much info about yourself then not enough. its not like you have to give it all to them.|`|8zJy3jeOaa	no are you kidding?

But when clothing is removed, there is only the real person. As a rule, that person as a nudist is friendly, decent and moral.  There are a hundred different body types, and none of them are disgusting, ugly or lewd.<br>  <br>  Do you think the same can be said of clothing?<br>  <br>  Nudists teach their children that there is no shame attached to their bodies or any one elses, to bad everyone doesn't do the same, then signs like this would no longer exist.|`|hu8o4vomaa	I would feel sad because that is mean to women|`|hSDWIslFaa	Protest probably.|`|AA10555973	I would die laughing, and then realize that fat guys are just as disgusting.|`|6847aeb5664de6577d9149f1415677e7aa	keep walking
850a8cecc1f651f64831451297ee3f29aa	For musical theory--you need them for scales. That's really it. For instance You take Db scale...all of the notes Db  > Eb > F > Gb > Ab > Bb > C > Db, but theoretically, F, is the same as E#, but because all scales have to contain all letters, and E was already taken (Eb), you have to move to the next letter...F. Simple complexity is what I call it. I hope I didn't confuse you more.

DtyOITuKaa	I was wondering the same thing.... sooooo I did some research and I found out that he was the final person memorialized during the 80th Oscars. I think its sad that they didn't include him again this year... for two reasons..1. He was nominated this year and 2. It was only weeks since he died when th last Oscars aired and there was still controversy surrounding his death. None the less..... His parents were included into  a very exclusive world and he was honored the way he should have been.... dead or alive!|`|tMY4iTlVaa	I didn't see on. I didn't even see his face in the tribute they have to all those who died that year, though they handled that so stupidly I might have just missed it. Whatever happened to transferring it full screen so the people at home might actually be able to see the names.<br>  <br>  Maybe they felt it was enough that they gave him the Oscar and let his family accept it.

UGupz4Btaa	The TMZ picture of her abused? Are you retarded? Her face is bruised and swollen, she does not look like that. She's famous cause she can sing & appeals to girls and boys all over the world. Five billboard #1 songs is proof of that. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder sweetheart therefore what you find unattractive can be beautiful to someone else.|`|9rLi9pSRaa	She is one stupid female and should know better.  To be so in love and let someone abuse you and bite and beat you up is no love.  She is nuts and I agree with you she is one unattractive woman.  Stupid and ugly.  I hope people stop paying attention to her and  move on to others who are deserving of praise for their work and their way of life.

1ko8AnvTaa	I liked the first book but thats about it everything went downhill after that. I kept waiting for Bella to stop being an annoying brat and that didnt happen. I waited for Edward to show that he was a vampire well...that didnt happen either and I wasnt expecting Jacob and the whole bella/ daughter weirdness..<br>  All in all the books were a waste of my time and it was a big dissapointment from the high expectation I had from the first book...|`|npkLIKPUaa	I liked the Twilight Series but yeah the way she does act with Jacob is ridiculious come on its either one or the other you can't have both.. After the 3rd one i really dont want to read the 4th one.

67cf4e04b90aa5ce4b37f6e59d7de9e1aa	Sarah E. Goode (b.1850s-d. c. 1905) was the first African-American woman to receive a patent from the United States Patent and Trademark Office.<br>  <br>  Born a slave, Goode gained her freedom after the American Civil War and moved to Chicago, Illinois. She soon opened a furniture store that was modestly successful. Due to the limited living spaces of urban life, many of her customers complained about not having enough room to place full-size beds in their apartments. Goode was inspired to design and construct what is known today as the Folding Bed.<br>  <br>  Goode's first model of a bed folded into a cabinet. It additionally served as a roll-top desk and stationery shelf. Her idea was so widely used that Goode applied for and was awarded a patent on July 14, 1885. (Patent #322,177[1], for a cabinet bed).<br>  <br>  A similar style of bed was patented more than thirty years later in 1916 as the Murphy bed. It was concealed behind a closet door or wall, rather than inside a piece of furniture, such as the cabinet bed. Today it is known as a "folding bed" or the "hide away bed".<br>  <br>  Goode's name appears in the Cook County, Illinois US Census for 1880, when she was living with her husband Archibald, her daughter, and several boarders. Her age is listed as 24, giving her a birth date of around 1856. She is listed as Mulatto, as is her daughter; Archibald is listed as White. While other biographical sources agree that Goode was born into slavery, the Census notes she stated she was born in Spain to Spanish parents.<br>  <br>  A 43-year-old woman named Sarah E. Goode died in Chicago on April 8, 1905. If this is the same Sarah E. Goode, there is a three to five year age discrepancy.|`|1ca4ae169dcf50854ac5e6f71f05fa7faa	check this<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_E._Goode" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_E._Go...</a>
N4ZAzxdMaa	They are FUNNY>>>><br>  A blonde goes to an office party and wins a thermos. <br>  The blonde asks a co-worker, "What does it do?" He says it keeps hot things hot and cold things cold. <br>  <br>  The next day the blond goes to work after filling her thermos with ice cream and tea.|`|Y1aAGPURaa	Since most men are attracted to blondes, they get a kick out of them.<br>  Here's one for you:<br>  <br>  A Blonde walks into a bank in New York City and asks for the loan officer. She says She is going to Europe on business for two weeks and needs to borrow $5,000. The bank officer says the bank will need some kind of security for such a loan, so the Blonde hands over the keys to a new Rolls Royce parked in the street in front of the bank. Everything checks out, and the bank agrees to accept the car as collateral for the loan. An employee drives the Rolls into the bank's underground garage and parks it there. <br>  <br>  Two weeks later, the Blonde returns, repays the $5,000 and the interest, which comes to $15.41. <br>  <br>  The loan officer says, "We are very happy to have had your business, and this transaction has worked out very nicely, but we are a little puzzled. While you were away, we checked you out and found that you are a multimillionaire. <br>  <br>  What puzzles us is why would you bother to borrow $5,000?" <br>  <br>  The Blonde replied, "Where else in New York can I park my car for two weeks for 15 bucks?"|`|9BB5H7aJaa	aaaww! lol that is all they understand;D|`|Wpulf29Maa	I think....no offense to anyone.....because some men are perverted and they like to think about blonde's.....some people think blonde's are more attractive.|`|OdovbvSYaa	because blondes are arrogant, fake, shallow, stupid whores who should be wiped from this planet by whatever means necessary.<br>  <br>  VIVA LA BRUNETTE REVOLUCION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|NOIseyASaa	funny|`|mhm3oWm6aa	they are easy to come up with, and men have the mindset that blonde's are whores

I'm gonna hit the big<br>  time, gonna be a big star someday', Yeah.<br>  Mama came to the door with a teardrop in her eye.<br>  Johnny said, 'Don't cry, mama, smile and wave good-bye'.|`|O6FgX9lVaa	thats a line from Superbad, but not ringing a bell for a song.|`|t2jW2gRbaa	I can't think of any Beatles song's with those lyrics.

The Martin Agency, which also claims the Geico commericals. Needless to say I lost my best, the first commerical was the guy living in the basement with girlfriend, 2nd is the used sub-compact, and then there is the pirate commercial.

hJP9y6kjaa	Personally, I think the only difference between the Spider 2's and Spider 3's is that the Spider 3's are a little louder... otherwise the tone sounds exactly the same, from the little practice amp models on up to the 150w head/cab combos. The only sound I like from it is the flange/phaser sound, and I can still get better sounds from my Boss GT-3 multifx or from an MXR Phase 90, etc.<br>  <br>  If I was going to get a Line 6 (which I would rather stab myself with a rusty knife than do at this point) I would at least get a tube preamp... even a cheapo... to try to retain some of that organic feel that I prefer.<br>  <br>  What I've found that I prefer is an Epiphone Valve Jr with a few different pedals into a 2x12 that I found used. All told, the amp and cab were just under 400$.... add a few pedals and I've got the same functionality that you do for the same price, except I'm playing through a real tube amp. You'd think... hey, only 5 watts... get even a halfway decent set of speakers, though, and its as loud as you need it to be. I lose a bit of headroom when I'm cranked (ie my cleans aren't very clean at loud volumes) but I can jam with a full band, so I'm not worried or anything (but these guys also aren't trying to be as loud as possible, either, they're moderately professional about how they play), which also means I've got more than enough volume to gig with, too.<br>  <br>  If I'm really worried about volume I can plug in my Crate Powerblock also, and run it stereo (the cab can run mono or stereo) with the EVJ. That gives me more than enough power and headroom to really crank if I need to. At some point I'd like to just get two EVJ's, I could get a little more headroom vs volume that way, I think. I love those amps, they are so frickin' sweet... oh yeah, did I mention that they are really tube amps, right? Small and with no real options (just a volume control *grin*) but at that price it's really a deal you can't beat!<br>  <br>  Find a good cab (2x12 or 4x12) and they sound killer... it sounds great with my buddy's Marshall 1960a 4x12, which is a 300w cab loaded with the GT75's, the "greenbacks on steroids"... it sounds truly killer through that cab, but I'm tired of lugging a bloody 4x12 around with me!<br>  <br>  Done too many gigs with frickin' heavy equipment (Mesa Boogie Tremoverb head - as heavy as some cabs, 1960a cab - as heavy as some bass cabs!!!)... I want my back to last... going to a 2x12 and a small, lightweight tube amp is truly a wonderful thing. My entire rig can fit into just my backseat now, instead of taking up 2/3rds of my car!<br>  <br>  <br>  Saul|`|hBcMiZDBaa	dont get line 6. they're terrible. I won one and it sucks. there are a bunch of better amps just like it out there.
QGBYOLIxaa	Hey there. I'm sure I know why he is less than usual. I'm a Taurus and I have known quiet a few Sagittarius. They are fun, but they come on too strong. He probably is just intimidated by you. I know a Sagittarius that really likes me and he's a nice guy, but I know deep in my heart he's not the one for me. He likes attention and that makes me feel like my attention is not enough, he always tries to touch me and I don't like it when people I haven't warmed up to yet touch me (it actually bothers me a lot), and he has a young heart, but perhaps he has some habits I could never accept. I like him as a brother and find myself pushing him away in an odd way due to his attempts. But I have those reasons and I'll be leaving the State soon - I don't want to start something that cannot develop into anything, because then it seems like I'm leading him on. And he knows I'm leaving. <br>  <br>  Taurus like stability. You might be doing something that makes him feel insecure about your relationship or makes him feel you are not stable. If you really want him you might want to tone down your hype a bit. But think about it? Do you really want to change who you are for someone else? Is it worth it? You might be better finding someone who will accept you for who you are, dear. Like a fire or air sign. Just saying because I know how he probably feels and I know my Sag friend is hating me right now for not dating him, but I'm thinking about it in the long run. I rather keep a friend than lose one over a relationship that might not work out.|`|LrKCLZF7aa	Sun sign Astrology is Astrology at its worst.

In some ways, you are the  odd couple  with opposite traits. Although it is nice to think that your opposite natures can complement each other, the truth is that you may also need to do many things separately in order to be happy with each other, because Sagittarius is likely to become bored by Taurus 's routine and  Taurus is likely to feel very distracted and unsettled from Sagittarius's wide  ranging interests.

8ftxES2Zaa	That's just silly.  Devil worshiping exists in the smallest of fringes but it is hyped by some religious figures in order to put fear in their base.  Belief in the devil implies belief in God -- typically if you don't believe in one you don't believe in the other.  If you believe in both then you're probably going with the stronger of the two.<br>  <br>  Anyway, there are plenty of reasons to not like these people -- especially Chris Brown -- but no they are not devil worshipers.|`|Gjyd1W5Waa	first of all they are not devil wrosshipers and whoever said that to you need to get sone help and cause somethin is totaly wrong with that person and they must be if they told you that lie and you are crazy if you are listen to what that person told you and don't belive everything someone tell you you are better then that and smarter i hop you are|`|2634a39e9f46ecfeb74be045d4160961aa	No. Where r your white devil worshipers?

AA11892241	Yes, do it...very smart. <br>  <br>  Not to worry. They are not going under. On 2/17/09, they got a $530 million loan from Liberty Media (LM). In exchange, LM gets a controlling 40% equity position. LM would lose the $530 million if Sirius filed for bankruptcy. LM isn't going to let this happen, Howard Stern is connected with the company. He's a valuable asset, and makes them more attractive. Even if they eventually file for bankruptcy, that would be a great way to keep them on the air.<br>  <br>  When companies file for bankruptcy, it doesn't mean they are going out of business, It means they are protected from creditors.

UDEMDcGuaa	I have no idea about his morals but I have never heard anyone call him a saint.  I think his obtuse way of dealing with journalists developed as a defense against questioners who tried to catagorize him ie " Why are you the voice of a generation Bob?", how could he answer that directly  without sounding like a pompous ***.  I remember an inteview where Bob quoted DH Lawrence, he said something like "Trust the tale not the teller", enjoy Bob's music,it means different things to different people (many hate it and his voice), you are never going to know the truth about him any more than the real truth about your mother or spouse,

DnWsMhwLaa	by songwriting do you mean you write lyrics or you write songs? there are a lot of people who think they can write lyrics out there, but if you are not writing songs they really arent much good to anyone. If you are writing songs, there is a book, you can find it in most librarys and book stores, called "the songwriters market" it can help you with where and how to submit your music to publishing companies. <br>  <br>  good luck.|`|FDt7cC8haa	Have ever heard of Holly Knight?<br>  Probably not...but look here you will be amazed on how many songs she has written that you know....<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holly_Knight" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holly_Knigh...</a>|`|ebxwADDcaa	you really dont have a chance unless you play something, otherwise its just poetry|`|ifB3p0pGaa	well seeing that most bands dont write their own material these days you could easily do that|`|ZnLe60ovaa	Find yourself a person who can sing, and play guitar or piano.  Do your best to let the person know how the melody is.  Have the song recorded and copyrighted.  Buy The "2009 Songwriter's Market" book.  In that book, you'll find listings of song publishers along with info on how to submit your material.  Unless you're Diane Warren (BIG successful songwriter) bands and artists don't come looking for songs with the writers themselves.  They go to publishing companies.  Songwriters can make excellent money.  If you have a song and someone wants to record it, they have to purchase a mechanical license from your publisher.  The amount they pay for it depends on how many copies they intend to make of your song.  If they plan to print the CD GOLD, (500,000 copies), that's a huge chunk of change for you.  Now if they want to make a single of your song, that's another mechanical license.  If they want to make a video of your song, they have to purchase ANOTHER mechanical license.  Here's where the REAL money gets made...."every time the CD your song is on gets sold, you get money"  "Every time your song is played on a radio station anywhere in the world (with the exception of college and low frequency radio), you get money".  Songwriting is an excellent career.  Good luck mate!<br>  <br>  Karl Withakay<br>  www.myspace.com/karlwithakayacousticar...

But remember, you are your toughest critic. I recommend that you continue to work on your voice, and record it. Try to find things in the recording that you would like to improve.

AA12390047	OH, No.  I agree with Lauren Ashley.  I love this new changed Kendall.  And love how she's not making it easy for Zach.  Reese just doesn't have "it"!!  She's forgettable....that is to say, if she were to leave, we'd forget all about her in no time.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	NO! I love to hate Kendall! Reese, I am just not sure about. Love the actress, no doubt Tamara Braun is wonderful but the way the presented Reese and then had her betray our beloved Binks, is wrong! They took what could have been a great character and set her up to be hated!|`|D3Fyxj0raa	i don't like kendall and i don't like reese so no i don't think they should  do that|`|GBKaftrJaa	I do like Reese.  I'm looking forward to Bianca finding out in court she can't deny custody of Gabrielle to Reese just because she all of the sudden decided she never loved her.  I can't stand Bianca right now.  And Bianca clearly has no idea of the legalities involved with parenting and marriage.<br>  <br>  As long as Kendall doesn't go back to acting how she did before the accident, when she was up in everyone's business but her own, then I am fine with her staying.|`|zFb022Iiaa	No, she needs to go, she's lame.  Cheaters are so predictable.|`|d5K8wORqaa	oh no!!!<br>  i lovee kendall.<br>  they should kill that bit*h reese<br>  freaking reese peanut butter cup<br>  okay that was stupid lmao|`|7sA8HwTzaa	The real drama of soaps is what goes on behind the scenes.<br>  <br>  Susan Lucci is getting too old to do the sex kitten thing any more and I really think that they would have loved to have had Greenlee a.k.a. Rebecca Buddig take the reins as the central character.  Unfortunately, she is a bit schitzo where matters of her career are concerned and I think she screwed up the opportunity.  Instead, enter Kendall who is now clearly the frontrunner for the central character take-over.  So, Kendall is going nowhere at a highly accelerated rate of speed.<br>  <br>  Reese is a blip on the screen.  She'll be gone in six months.|`|KqQlWbYsaa	The only way THAT would ever work is if Zach were willing to acknowledge genuine feelings as to Reese; and if Reese were willing to give up completely on her marriage to Bianca.<br>  <br>  Reese made a huge mistake; and this new and hopefully improved Kendall might just shake things up a bit and keep things at least somewhat interesting for awhile.|`|OSt9X8puaa	no,reese could never take kendall's place.she don't have what it takes kendall can cover all bases she can be a angel or a devil in the snap of a finger.when she is good she is good but when she is bad she is real bad..i wonder what will happen with kendall when thorsten kaye leaves the show in april.will she end up with ryan again?i love ryan but there will never be a better love story than kendall and zack..|`|czY7K8yKaa	Never!  The character Reese is simple, not interesting and a very confused character at that. If they ever do turn her around and give her a back bone then maybe..but I'm not going to hold my breath. <br>  I can not see Kendall being killed off, she is a fan favorite.  Her character adds depth to the show and makes the other characters interesting.|`|vvgC20BHaa	No way!<br>  <br>  And I disagree with many of these answers!<br>  <br>  Zach and Reese just kissed! Kendall had an affair with Aidan and Zach forgave her! And now she can't forgive a kiss???????? Please! I don't like what they're doing to Kendall.  She's getting just as batty as Ryan.  And I would totally hate to see a Ryan/Kendall reunion! Yuk!!!!!<br>  <br>  Any how, I love Zach and Kendall together. They have "the real thing"!!!!!!!!!!!! They should be AMC's poster children for the everlasting love that everyone secretly wants but wont admit it!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  I would love to see Reese and Bianca work it out. But I think they need another woman in their little love triangle! Not Zach! I'd love it if Maggie came back to throw some fuel into the fire! If Reese sees Bianca with another woman, it would make her realize how much she really loves Bianca and how stupid she was to even look at Zach!|`|jfriQ8pmaa	No, I sure hope it doesn't happen that way.  Don't think it will either, the head writer loves Kendall!!  I'm glad she isn't making it easy for Zach!!  He deserves punishment!!!  Reese will fight for custody of Gabrielle and Zach will not help her!!  GOOD!!!|`|yJCLcFVwaa	I don't like Reese and I did love Kendall but not since she's come back, all she does is whine.  Dixie is coming back, maybe they'll stick Dixie and Zack together.|`|GrE1UM2Saa	oh hell no.  <br>  The writers know the viewers don't like Reese so why have her be the main character and Kendall die|`|XnYkROf3aa	no, i love kendall and i wont her to be around for a long time. but i like reese to. i think if kendall and zach do brake up. then kendell should go with Ryan and that would make for interesting television when greenlee ever comes back.( she will be back) and if reese and Bianca don't patch things up her and zach should get together. but we will see.|`|AA11362302	No way...Kendal is here for the long haul! <br>  I like the way they`re making Reese stand up for herself against Binks (she`s acting like a spoiled child right now),gives the girl a little backbone!|`|VU7YIW5haa	That is the worst idea I have ever heard.I love Kendal. I love Kendal and Zach even more they are the best part of AMC. The only reason I watch. Zach and Kendal 4ever!!!!!

If you've been drinking all night at 12 bars - the next morning you have the blues.<br>  <br>  Just kidding.<br>  <br>  Hun, if you're writing an essay, these questions are the BASIC fundamentals of blues.  The 12 bar form (as detailed) is the most common structure for blues music.  It developed naturally, though tended to have a lot more variation in preWWII blues.|`|FHYjZx1Kaa	Hey, well theres a few vids on youtube, aimed at teaching you to play it on the 'geetar' but should prove useful for your theory...here's one as an example.|`|aQcsrgLCaa	The blues, and the 12 bar blues, is many different things to many different people. Consider the Robert Johnson era and then consider Status Quo.<br>  <br>  The traditional 12 bar blues is 12 bars long per verse and consists of the root chord (lets, for example use the key of C) in this case C. It also uses the 4th chord in the key, in this case F and the 5th chord, in this case G. This 1, 4, 5 rule is the same in all '12' bar blues.<br>  A guitarist might use the key of E in which case the chords would be E, A, B. The 5th chord is usually a 7th chord.<br>  <br>  The root chord would be played for 4 bars, the 4th chord for 2 bars, back to the root chord for 2 bars followed by the 5th chord for 1 bar, the 4th chord for 1 bar, the root chord for 2 bars. Often the final bar is played by the 5th chord and often a 'turnaround' where the instrument plays a series of notes where the 'tune' seems to run down. In the key of E the turn around would be E,E7.A,Am, E, B7.<br>  <br>  The rhythm depends on who plays it, the song, the insruments, the feel of the song and so many other things. Compare Status Quo to Doctor Feelgood and Willie Dixon.<br>  <br>  Traditionally the key that is used for blues uses a flattened 3rd note in the key. So for E the 3rd note G# will be flattened to G.<br>  <br>  You need to know that the blues is a very personal thing and is reinvented everyone picks up an instrument or sings. It can remain very traditional with people playing exact replicas of an old blues song note for note and other people reinterpreting the song each time they play it. It is organic and evolves constantly.<br>  <br>  The 12 bar blues is only a part of blues. Some players like Bo Diddley might only use 1 chord throughout the song. <br>  <br>  Booker White might only use 2 chords. <br>  There are 8 bar blues and blues with more than 3 chords. <br>  <br>  In the olden days, when a blues player might be singing and playing an insrument as a solo performer, they might not even stick to the 12 bar format. They could play a musical phrase that they really liked and might play it again before proceeding with the rest of the verse.|`|1IAlxzzzaa	well no one knows WHO made it<br>  <br>  and use your brain, its called the 12 BAR blues for a reason.  how many bars do you think it has.

BBSRuyNfaa	OMG an interested taurus male in my life does the same thing!!! I learned it's cuz he's so excited to express what he has to say and didnt at all mean to be rude, he would always apologize but go right back and do it again. i didnt bother me much because I know he wasn't doing it to be rude or disrespectful even though it is and I have found a lot of the bull's do this...seems like they just cant help themselves...<br>  <br>  as far as not responding...i've found the best way to engage the bull is simply not by talking about your day but then saying, what do you think of that or how would that make you feel, they dont seem to just naturally engage as one might expect, you have to ask their opinion which trust me they are more than willing to share<br>  <br>  Fellow virgo, so I know you'll adapt:-)|`|AA11791082	It is a sign that you have a Taurus with a disorder. He is the type who is so wrapped up in himself that he doesn't have time to care about you, and honey, this will only get worse with time. All he cares about and all he sees is himself, and I'd watch to see the next time he says, "I love you" if he isn't looking into a mirror instead of at you.<br>  <br>  He doesn't love you so much. You're a thing, a possession, and you'd do well to get yourself free from him sooner, rather than later.|`|OCzss4xJaa	I haven't met Taurus men behaving like that. But I suggest you ask him why isn't he actually listening to you or respond.|`|6NZeItMAaa	Talk with him about your feelings and ask him to listen to you.<br>  <br>  Here is what astrology says about Taurus men:<br>  <br>  This is a very hard sign to overcome.<br>  <br>  Taurus people are exacting, domineer-ing, and very selfish in their physical demands and expectations.<br>  <br>  Those born under this sign should learn silence and patience as a daily exercise. They should never talk of self, and should school the mind to look upon the opposite sex.<br>  <br>  They are selfish, and when permitted to have their own way, become very unyielding and indifferent to the trouble and suffer-ing they inflict upon others.|`|QGBYOLIxaa	Hey exotic. I don't think it's that he doesn't care about you. He does, but maybe he has something on his mind that it bothering him and he really want to get to it, because he cannot focus on anything else until he clears his mind. Virgo and Taurus are usually very compatible. I'm a Taurus and I dated a Virgo and it was bliss, just that they ended up going back to their ex. Hmmm... Do you know what your and his Chinese zodiac are?<br>  <br>  Start with sitting him down and telling him that you are really bothered and that you really need his undivided attention. Say it firmly, but not scolding (in a caring manner). Taurus don't like authority, but we will compromise. You have to get his full attention first though. When you do make sure you are looking him straight in the eyes so he can see how serious you are. Tell him, but don't nag. Taurus tire or nagging and too much boo hooing. We can deal with it more than others, but we have a limit too.
GDf2n7jPaa	well its varies every time you keep reading i often read horoscopes and there so not like me and i think they can be wrong sometimes and right other times there not always right xxx xxx|`|uxwSd0KLaa	YOu are saying birth chart ; correct ? OK Sadly some declare themselves astrologer ; when in reality they   know     almost nothing in astrology ; and its most probably what happen with your mother chart . Ask for a good astrologer and you will recognize your mother really fast|`|OCzss4xJaa	No matter how complexly the study might be, it still cannot beat the complexity of human mind and emotions. <br>  <br>  See, if we could predict future expecting things to happen because of planetary aspects, there wouldn't be much to live anyway!<br>  <br>  Nothing against astrology, but it can't be precise to everyone.
32P3hG0Laa	Have you had your chart done by a professional astrologer, or have you been using web sites that list your stuff paragraph by paragraph? (ie Venus in Leo means...... Saturn in the 7th house means...)<br>  <br>  Because a professional astrologer will blend it all into  complete person, knowing what influences are stronger or weaker, etc etc etc,,,|`|nrTDOs6aaa	Because star signs are just 'cold readings'.

I certainly have bad things happen but my ability to respond has been transformed as well.  This life is full of evil but my heart is full of Christ and I am striving to be more like Christ.  He will work with me and at times that means difficulties in this life sometimes just to remind me to trust in him and not in my own abilities.  My life before Christ was so full of pain and strife I can't imagine it ever being that bad again.  Trust in him and he will see you through.

You fall under Libra 1, "The Perfectionist", which is from September 25-October 2. Libras are the most, without a doubt, sociable of all the signs. They love harmony and balance but tend to go overboard with fashion and perfection. You are very talented, even if others find your talents "weird". You are pretty darn critical and sometimes do not show true emotions. Your best matches are Taurus, Aries and Aquarius. Signs that are most attracted to you are Aquarius, Aries, Taurus ,Gemini and Sagittarius.

They all committed suicide.<br>  I know God exists as I have felt His presence <br>  Sometimes you can't trust the person you love most-people can let you down. <br>  First black president, it is highly likely, but at todays economy, not likely.<br>  I have met many famous people throughout my life and have their pictures and autographs.

But I guess I believe in God. (He smiles and laughs at me every day.) Obama might end up on Mt. Rushmore, he IS the first black President after all, but there might not be enough room. I'm scared if I had a sibling I didn't know about. And I hope I someday end up meeting someone famous (particularly a musician [drummer] of some sort) to ask them questions. Not like Miley Cyrus, she's a sl*t and a b*tch who takes everyone and her career for granted.|`|9yVLKWslaa	? u have a sibling or another one u don't know about? it's possible.<br>  ?

OXSOch9Oaa	There's a simple answer to this and it holds true for all past Oscar shows.  Action movies and fantasy movies never do well at the Oscars.  They win things like special effects, costumes, set design etc, but never anything else.  Star Wars, LotR, etc. never win any of the big awards.  LotR got lucky with Return of the King, but otherwise, it always goes to the drama's.  I am not a 'broad' and I know I'm right.  I watch the Oscars every year hoping my favorite shows (super hero flicks, sci-fi, fantasy etc) will win and they don't.  I don't really like drama's that well.|`|P9S5wlLyaa	Because super-hero movies aren't very good. They are exciting and action-y, but don't have very much depth to them. There's a bad guy. There's a good guy. The good guy wins. Nice special effects, but no human element.|`|eUKapbZbaa	i agree i think they gave heath the oscar as sympathy because he is deceased and to make his family happy. as for ironman it was a great movie and robert downey was great he should of been won best actor he was robbed.|`|4CxlX0s9aa	It was ridiculous, and Batman fans can't even be happy about Heath Ledger winning because all those idiots say he won because he died.|`|9NIqMKojaa	Entertainment-<a href="http://ndtvimagines.info/" rel="nofollow">http://ndtvimagines.info/</a>|`|E1QSHeR1aa	i totaly agree with you there is a descussion in different forums online even in some chat rooms especially messenger check them out to here different views from worldwide.<br>  <br>  p.s answer my question about Evermore by Alyson Noel where are the likns. Gracias|`|Fx4iLzbYaa	Your right, Hollywood has some big Gay Agenda, so all the awards were already set.|`|AIuN5Lw9aa	Memo to idiot above me: she's not a broad and she doesn't need to shut-up. She is absolutely right.<br>  <br>  An Academy Award is the highest honor one can get in the film industry. To give the award away to a comic-book movie just because it entertains a bunch of twelve-year-olds is to do a disservice to the award itself.<br>  <br>  Both TDK and IM were good; it just so happened that other movies surpassed these two in acting, story, and direction. Deal with it.

z9hRuFDiaa	My mom is trying to get me to quit smoking cigarettes. I know it's a bad habit and it smells, but I don't drink excessively or do any sort of drugs and I'm only hurting myself when I do it.<br>  <br>  The way I look at it is, smoking and eating fried foods may be bad for you, but all that means is you die younger. Not a huge deal to me, I don't want to live to not be able to walk, chew my food, see, hear, control my peeing or pooping and my # 1 reason for not wanting to live really old is I don't want to be a burden on my kids. Old age sucks.|`|RhIGsseyaa	goddamit you have found the ultiment truth<br>  that living is bad for us we would be better off if we froze are selfs now. thats why i say screw it i am smoking what ever i want all drink purell if  i feal like it all through my hand through a window if i feal like it all talk to people if i feal like it  who give a **** i want to be happy substances do that living doesn't|`|21g5bHfvaa	I don't things things are really worse for us than before, its just that we now know that they are bad.  An example is cigarettes.  They always were bad but up until the 50's nobody knew; and there are people like George Burns who smoked multiple cigars everyday and lived up to the 100's.|`|C3yE261uaa	they used to eat healthy<br>  <br>  when the power of love overcomes the love of power|`|1lIDm4U8aa	Yes, everything is bad, including the air we breathe.|`|mHwnZM5Eaa	Because their inner world (mind) seems to be very clean.<br>  they believed God.<br>  They followed the rituals|`|zn8TzZrJaa	Yeah, for city people.

qeJKa3TOaa	If a BF or GF has a public account or Blog where you can post this type of stuff, then expect ALL types of comments, questions, suggestions and seduction.  I wouldn't be mad unless my GF was making suggestive remarks or leading on some guys.  Really, if your concerned you need to make the social account private so only "friends" can comment and communicate (e.g. My Space or Face Book).  Otherwise, move on and don't worry about the small stuff.|`|x5GH9A9Gaa	I dont have a gf .... but say if I was in a relationship ....

You can also set it so that anyone who requests friends has to know your last name and / or email address.  You are young so you should not be adding people that you do not know.

To be brutally honest, your posting these comments of others comes across as boasting of a sort, & totally the wrong kind for a Christian...  <br>  16yo is too young to be 'in a relationship', anyway...<br>  A mature Christian has much more important matters to spend their time on than 'opposite sex relationship worries'.<br>  <br>  Have you really asked yourself how what you are doing brings glory to your God...?  <br>  I doubt it.

RQfLKOPQaa	Mostly I don't. Not because I'm afraid someone will steal them, but because I have lots of ideas all the time, lots of projects that go round in round in my mind. Some of them I decide to go ahead, and some of them   I don't. But I've shared ideas with people, that later kept asking how it was coming along. What I'm trying to say is, although to me they are just ideas, because I have a lot of them, I know that 99% of them are to remain ideas forever, but others regard them as something to pursue, and that's not always the case.|`|uiKAI8bWaa	I like to share.<br>  Can you share something & then call it stealing if it used.<br>  I guess so.<br>  Sharing information is the way I reckon.<br>  There are always more ideas & any original thought uses the previous thoughts of others to get there anyway.|`|c3MFIbeUaa	I do and if they take my idea then that's fine.

RQfLKOPQaa	I'd go with child marriage. Child labor is not always a bad thing, if a kid delivers newspapers or finds a job after school, I don't think it's that bad. It's not a lasting decision, and it builds character. I'm excluding of course full time work as a miner or stuff like that. Child marriage is a decision that lasts, you can't exactly go back on that one, maybe you can get a divorce later on ,but I'm assuming that if the marriage was fixed, then the girl will never have the chance of a divorce, the boy might have later on- stress on might. Although this usually happens in countries were there are no divorces. <br>  There is no absolute answer to this, but I'll give two different answers to two different scenarios. If we are talking about working part time after school, I would chose child labor every time, if we are talking about working full time in a debilitating work, like mining, I would chose child marriage every time. The rest of the scenarios are all in a huge gray area, I would have to know the specifics to give an answer.|`|KN36rGMvaa	Labor.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Cheers<br>  -Will|`|c3MFIbeUaa	Either or  as they both lead to the worst thing: Child abuse.<br>   If they are both forced on children.<br>   There are times when kids learn the value of money as they work for it but it must not be a forced agenda.|`|DjbCw7ePaa	Child labor.|`|980cd82a18459010574ced1a4cc818f1aa	Child marriage is much worse.|`|5NsgLFPRaa	wow<br>  <br>  I think child labor is worse|`|H0aIuM5Xaa	BOTH .|`|a577675893457f8844900f790e549222aa	Child marriage|`|ZJmHQdVYaa	child marriage|`|UT2tv5N3aa	child labour|`|zvAfMgf3aa	child labor|`|iwONPromaa	not happy about..either...x|`|h1qCOpFEaa	well i have never given birth so child labor, lol|`|j3nKvmNyaa	hmmm, child labor i guess, but both are terrible|`|wfMF0pbKaa	Oooh.. tough one "-"<br>  <br>  I'd have to say child marriage..

YCXxP43Laa	It would add a binding tie between the couple, it is a good aspect to have if longevity are an important factor. The couple would be loyal and it would denote a tone of responsibility between them.<br>  The Saturn person could be cool at times, or quite conservative and rigid, adn would tend to take the parental role, and feel protective, but at times may see the Venus person as more frivolous and childish. It is good though as the Saturn person would be a restraining on such frivolities by Venus.<br>  Venus can teach Saturn to liven up, to have fun. At times though Venus may feel that Saturn is a wet blanket to have fun.<br>  If other ties of attraction exist between the couple this aspect can give a long lasting tie between the couple|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	The conjunction of Venus and Saturn indicates that you feel you must make concessions to others to get what you want. You are always the one who is expected to adjust to the demands of others in order to have a satisfactory relationship. As a result, you are often dissatisfied with the contacts you make, either because they are not fulfilling enough, or because you feel you are being used. You may become resigned to making the best of a relationship in which you give more than the other person does. On the positive side, however, this shows that you take the relationship seriously. You are loyal and sincere in your affections, but tend to be inhibited in demonstrating them, because you are afraid that others will take advantage of you.<br>  <br>  You have reasonably good judgement, which is reflected in your material affairs. You are self-disciplined in handling money, and prudent enough to always save something regardless of your income. Such prudence is a way to compensate for the disappointments you may have in personal relationships, and you consider it a reasonable substitute. Saving money also gives you security and allows you some material comforts.<br>  <br>  You are temperamentally suited to occupations in which success depends on adhering to rules and regulations. Finance, banking, building trades, insurance, law, real estate, sales, and designing are some endeavors in which you can successfully apply yourself. Ideally, you should have a position that allows you to function independently. You are dutiful and responsible, and would accomplish more without a supervisor breathing down your neck. You are certainly able to work with others, but you prefer working in privacy.<br>  <br>  Your romantic interests are stimulated by individuals who are serious, sincere, honest. You need a person you can respect and who will respect you too. A mature individual represents security to you, in addition to providing social status. Your lover must be tactful and polished, and have a strong and admirable character. You are repulsed by vulgarity and disturbed by disorder. Your objectives are well-defined, and you will expect your mate to co-operate in reaching mutual goals. Because of your deep concern for the integrity of the family, you will unhesitatingly withdraw from any external situation that threatens your family.<br>  <br>  It is important that you look at the bright and positive side of life; negative attitudes can bring about negative effects. Problems in the throat glands may have a similar origin. You can improve your general well-being by adopting a more cheerful outlook, but the optimism must be genuine.

8n3NvYQwaa	girls.......  they think I am a care bear........|`|8vfCRg7Caa	I get along with women better. All my best friends are women. The only guy friend i have lives in Seattle and his ex girlfriend is one of my best friends. i just dont get along with the guys here. They are a little too country from me and all they talk about is girls they have had sex with and how drunk they got. And sometimes those stories dont pan out. At least when my women friends tell stories they arent lying or trying to make themselves sound good.<br>  <br>  And why hang with guys, beautiful women attract more beautiful women. Plus they have no style here of there own. Every guy likes to wear snow mobile jackets to fit in. i like to be different.|`|Asj4Usqkaa	Guys...|`|tizMQKDBaa	I get along with girls and guys NOW, but for the most part I never had a lot of girl friends.

I've known them since 6 years ago when we were still young and didn't care about one-upping each other.<br>  <br>  Now that I've grown up (and become more bitchy, I might add), I feel a little tense when meeting female strangers and making acquaintances. Getting close enough to call them "friends" is just impossible now. I feel there's a wall between us. I think it's natural to feel a little insecure when two females meet each other for the first time. Females tend to judge other females when they first meet them. Then they sum up the victims and throw them a label. And all before they've even spoken.|`|9851deb6f5776ae6834cf0b79571e624aa	Girls|`|aaCMNSB2aa	Guys.

AA12397532	Do we have any directors worth merit left in Hindi Cinema. Those making devdas or Page 3, or Dielhi 6 - can we call them directors. Do they know what lenses a camaera has... film is a proper art and craft and science. What is passing off today in the name of cinema is a joke played on audiences and real artistes.<br>  SlumDog will, though produced in Hollywood, will, hopefully bring back the era of eventful and good cinema back again. SlumDog is no great film, despite its getting 8 Oscars - but a sincere effort...and that is why it has been appreciated - the sincerity towards the art by the makers<br>  In Bollywood, the characters would be made to wear raw silk torn clothes, with lip-sticks and dances and dream sequences|`|4uANF0xyaa	Might of, best foreign film.

b3c054cf8a809cd78b23404a2feecb7daa	I know many many people like this. It doesn't annoy me, but makes me laugh.|`|W8tio90vaa	It doesn't bother me at all.<br>  People are very snobby about music these days. <br>  They are looking down their noses at 'pretend fans' when they are 'real' fans of a band becuase they know all songs by a certain band, or moaning about singers not being credible because they dont play instruments, or write their own music etc etc. <br>  Music I think is quite personal and if you like a song by a band then surely you can say you like that band?<br>  Its like saying you cant be a fan of an artists unless you have seen every single thing they have ever painted. <br>  I think you are being worthy and a bit snobby to be honest.|`|gwevYe3haa	That's just how it goes. I know a lot of people like that myself. Not everyone can "get it".
lPDHMOVZaa	No. Actually I class people, that class people who tell racist jokes as racist, racist. Clearly if they can't understand that it is a joke they are too far to one side. Even if it is a white person who finds a black joke racist...|`|HVY2rqzfaa	I think that people are far too quick in this hypocritical PC world we live in to point the finger of racism at others. <br>  <br>  How you treat people, what opportunities you give them and how you value them is what counts, not which jokes you tell - even if they are a bit off colour.|`|6YZ74lEOaa	Well it's usually not a good idea to tell racist jokes anyway because it can really offend someone of that certain race or culture but you don't have to feel like your racist if you WANT to tell those sort of jokes.|`|v0sdoQy5aa	no i don't but there are some people out there who takes offense at anything..<br>  i myself got my first account suspended because some moron was reporting all my answers and questions ( including resolved one)....|`|NGO7v58haa	Two words: Carlos Mencia<br>  <br>  Shouldn't this be in the philosophy section?|`|MYwyA7jOaa	i agree. they are jus jokes nd i find some really funny. i dont class th ppl who tell racist jokes racist.|`|2e41492627923affb8e7fc267ed04777aa	I don't tell jokes to offend any race.<br>  I think we level-headed people know when a person is telling a race laced joke if he's telling it to incite anger or just to get a good natured laugh.<br>  <br>  I love a good joke, even good ones about us Czech people.<br>  We should find a way to be less uptight about such things. There are more important things to be concerned about.<br>  <br>  But I agree with YellowRoses about hurtful racist jokes - why are they even necessary, even though they are just jokes? There are already enough things to get people riled up, so why add to that list by telling stupid racist jokes?<br>  <br>  On the other hand, as long as the joke doesn't demean, criticize, or belittle any certain race, I see nothing wrong with it.|`|ccEWxExfaa	I form my opinions about a person based on<br>  what actions they display.I am not a mind<br>  reader so I have no idea what motives they have<br>  in mind.So when I hear a racist joke I think that<br>  person is racist.When I hear someone cuss up a<br>  storm I think that person is ignorant and base.<br>  The person telling the joke always says "It's just<br>  a joke." Why are those jokes even necessary?<br>  Try repeatedly listening to jokes about your perceived <br>  shortcomings and then tell me if it's "just a joke"<br>  Would that make it less offensive and demoralizing to<br>  you.<br>  We're all in this together.We should look for ways to<br>  elevate each other instead of knocking each other down.
raV6Rkg4aa	Mars in Gemini favors energetic activity of the mind. You are brilliantly intellectual, with a steel-trap brain that quickly grasps concepts and spins new ideas. You are incisive and practical and arrive at conclusions in a flash. The problem is that you lack force of will. You hesitate, vacillate, and think of yet another delay. In matters of sex, you experience desire in the mind before it becomes a reality. You enjoy the adventure leading up to lovemaking and have passions that are easily aroused. However, as soon as an affair loses zest and becomes ordinary you look for the escape hatch. You tend to have a number of affairs and marriages. Mars-Geminis are able to inspire and to lead others through the power of the spoken and written word. Often you have a magnetic voice and compelling talent to convince others of what you say.|`|XZ9yP4Jkaa	we are more attractive...

dd1ed523a17927679c4955f404f3e139aa	Cliff Burton easily... you have to remember that Cliff Burton was right there when Dave was sent packing and I can't imagine that he did not have some kind of say in the decision to let Mustaine go.<br>  <br>  Burton's death had a profound impact on the direction and the leadership of Metallica. You have remember that when he passed it forever changed the dynamics inside of the band.<br>  <br>  Kirk Hammett is a talented player but not a founding member... Jason Newsted and Bob Trujillo are interchangeable and inevitably replaceable... like the drummer in Spinal Tap. So Lars and James went from having a say in things... to ruling with an iron fist.<br>  <br>  For the most part they have led a successful band... they dragged the mainstream to them kicking and screaming but then got sucked up in the pressure of commercial success... The Black Album and the Load Era made them millions upon millions and they crafted their sound and even their look... to be appealing... even their once menacing logo is now as iconic as Ford or Coca-Cola...<br>  <br>  Death Magnetic is a shift homeward but also a calculated return to credibility... Cliff's death was a tragic loss for his friends and family, and a tragic loss for their sound too...If he had lived who knows what comes after Master of Puppets... God knows that James and Lars bury the bass lines deep in the mix... I don't think they could have done that to Cliff Burton.<br>  <br>  I am glad Dave was free to form Megadeth because I enjoy both bands.|`|5uvTte8Zaa	Cliff.<br>  R.I.P.<br>  They actually were the perfect band after Dave left and before Cliff died.<br>  I think Cliff was more than a great musician, he was the glue that held the band together and kept them "Metal"|`|JXTLpgUoaa	Definitely Cliff.  I love Dave, but lets face it .. by him leaving we got 2 great bands.  It was a win / win for metal fans.|`|Ew7hXGFtaa	Definitely Cliff. I really think he was an essential part to the band.|`|76d0f42b082dd7b4403317013a48817eaa	I agree with Lep that Metallica was at their best with out Dave and with Cliff. <br>  <br>  <br>  However, I will add that they made their first mistake after Cliff died by hiring Jason Newsted instead of me. I was overlooked because of my age age at the time(14) and the minor fact that I couldn't play bass. DAMN YOU LARS!!!!|`|9hCezzwRaa	Cliff by far.  Lep hit it on the head he was the glue that kept the band together.  Plus he could keep Lars' ego in check.  If Dave stayed in the band they may have not been alive to make Master.|`|oUZLZusjaa	Burton. Partly because we wouldn't have Megadeth OR Kirk Hammet if Mustaine had stayed with 'Tallica. Also, Burton was one of the most talented musicians/people of all time, and now he's totally gone forever.|`|YVRPkTqJaa	i'd say cliff burton|`|APNLYQgoaa	Burton by far.|`|AgQForcYaa	Cliff, easy. They were still good when Dave left, and we wouldn't have Megadeth!!!|`|lHzBJA4eaa	You know everyone will say Cliff. Dieing really raises a persons value and if you were exceptional in the first place your value becomes infinite it seems. If Cliff could have stopped Metallica from hooking up with Bob Rock it would be interesting to hear what would have been made .Still , I have to wonder the same with regards to Mustaine. I'll take Megadeth's body of work over Metallica's with Bob Rock .|`|JyxNA1o0aa	Cliff! RIP
SDjrojZXaa	Yes matter of fact bo even surprised hope with a romantic re-inactment of there first wedding in new orleans....however they are having some issues right now because bo is having"visions" and he saw hope shooting Kayla(her and steve are back) but he didnt tell her and she shot her(she is ok) so hope is furious that bo didnt say anything and so she doesnt know if she can forgive him......she could forgive him for cheating with billy and they have gone through so much i think this is just stupid|`|JfZiLwzeaa	Yes - but there's a "rumour" - only a rumour - that Billie is returning to Salem and that it's possible she and Bo never DIVORCED!!!

u2EUom6daa	i loved <br>  "Save the Last Dance" (2001) She's a white ballerina, devastated by the death of her mother and an unsuccessful Juilliard tryout. He's a black scholar from the 'hood, on his way to medical school via Georgetown University. This film is a classic "from different worlds" tale... more starring Julia Stiles and Sean Patrick Thomas, but it has one refreshing twist. Stiles' Sara isn't a rich girl. In fact, she sleeps on her jazzman father's couch. <br>  <br>  Sara and Derek can't resist each other. They're both adorable. But they each have problems to solve. Sara needs to get over her mother's death and rededicate herself to her dancing dreams. Derek needs to break away from his friends, who don't aspire to anything more than street thuggery. It's one of those movies that could have had a tragic "West Side Story" ending, but it doesn't. And i'm glad. <br>  <br>  and<br>  "Dirty Dancing" (1987) No movie since this 1987 hit has come close to knocking "Dirty Dancing" off its pedestal. It stars Patrick Swayze as Johnny Castle, the hunky dance instructor at a resort in the Catskill Mountains. When his dance partner falls ill after a botched abortion, Baby (Jennifer Grey) steps in. She learns to dance in secret with Johnny, knowing her dad and his boss wouldn't approve. She naturally falls in love with him, even though she's a doctor's daughter and he's barely making it in the world. And, of course, he falls for her, too, deflowering her in a rustic cabin. <br>  <br>  But what is it Shakespeare said about love? The course "never did run smooth." There's quite the Shakespearean ending in "Dirty Dancing," culminating in an edgy group dance performance and the classic line, "Nobody puts Baby in the corner."<br>  <br>  others i like are "Honey","Step Up" "Flashdance" and "Make It Happen"|`|fTuc2rMCaa	Step Up is nothing compared to Dirty Dancing! Dirty Dancing is a classic!|`|US33hgbJaa	Strictly Ballroom. Definitely. Because it's got sick dancing, and probably the cutest plot ever.|`|HDFsvJMTaa	STILL Dirty Dancing!

wBVuFu3Baa	I think the whole thing is sick and if Jade Goody really was doing for the good of her family she would have sorted things out properly.  I think that there is no need for her to earn millions of pounds for her children.  And I also think that possibly OK should give some of their profits to a cancer charity.  That is what I would have done if I were in her position I would have had it written into the contract.<br>  <br>  I do feel sorry that she is dying, but I am just fed up with the morbidity of society that wants to read about how much pain someone is in, which is the only reason Jade is making money.  It also annoys me that people can say that they will be sorry to see her go when she dies.  I'm not being nasty but most people don't know what she is like as a person only what they see.  How can you have such a relationship nd care for someone that much in such a one sided relationship it completely baffles me.  I was disappointed when Heath Ledger died as I think he is a great actor.  I'm not upset that he died just I won't see anymore of his films.  I'm sorry if anyone thinks that I'm being harsh just fed up of the fact that other people in her position can't get the same treatment by OK and the press.  Just because she is a non-celebrity they think she deserves money!|`|yuTue84caa	she choose to sell her rights to the wedding to them so they are not exploiting her. It was her choice as she wants the money for her sons.|`|AA12050428	That really does annoy me. I absolutely loathe the press and their practises. They are like vultures feeding off the vulnerable.  But why do people go on buying the rubbish?|`|AfbjU9Guaa	They are exploiting each other, chill.|`|8zXiqIK0aa	yes, its unsavoury. but it works both ways. i understand tht she wants money for her sons, but i dnt think she comprehends the idea of death. im a nurse andi cant help but think death should be private, spent with close ppl, such as family. it should be a private time for her sons. not shared with everyone. it worries me that this society seems so hungry for this story. we seem to obsess over others suffering. though the increase in smear test uptake is amazing. its brave for her to share her story, but i feel it has gone to far.<br>  <br>  also, if it was my mother i would resent the fact that tht time was taken away. i wouldnt want any of the money. its basically blood money.|`|xiYcUd1Yaa	I think its a two-way thing to be honest & she wanted to sell the her story/wedding pics etc to try & get as muc money in the bank as possible for her kids- any good parent would make as much money for their little ones before they go- it will give her more peace of mind where her sons are concerned. xx|`|0SoDvjU7aa	i personally think she isn't being exploited but she's just making sure there's one more pay day left to go towards her two childrens future without her........sad story but there's a major life lesson in there somewhere.........|`|v811KD7raa	OK are not exploiting her, theyre exploiting the millions of celebrity obsessed busy bodies who buy OK to gawp at photos of celebrities|`|3f21c30b3424532b28fd9578258f69d9aa	The whole Jade thing is a Circus... she should just go away and spend her last precious days/months whatever time she has left with her Kids... instead of trying to become a A lister before she snuffs it..|`|AA11349881	She'd securing her kids future,i dont blame her.|`|0v7Msiznaa	I think its a win win situation for both parties|`|If6O5XHlaa	or is she exploiting them?...I think it is mutual.|`|JimKwFMkaa	I think actually it helps her and I would have taken the money in a heartbeat!|`|wmBK9uASaa	I think the whole sordid thing should never have happened, I find it uunpalatable..|`|3qLIRorjaa	Jade is exploiting herself.  They're both making tons of money out of it and OK magazine is a business to make money by whatever means. <br>  <br>  Plus everyone who buys the magazine is exploiting Jade too.

I hope they film breaking dawn but its still up in the air.

edJtHlDiaa	Not to sound "rude" but cancer and libra are a very bad match.Cancer is "water" emotion and very sensitive,and libra is "air" intellectual,social,and light they are just 2 different people .Cancer "feels" libra "thinks",and libra is charming and a bit too flighty for cancer so maybe the reason here is that he might not be able to be on the same wave length as you and the reason why you can't communicate with each other is because cancer people always take offense to everything right away so u might feel like u have to "walk on eggshells" with him a lot and "watch what you say" and maybe thats why it's hard to talk,but you have to realize that any relationship is able to work if you compromise with him,and he is able to open up to you more cause cancer's have a problem with that.|`|AA12215623	Too general of a question.

at4N2890aa	hey i totally agree! I LOVE hugh jackman, but when i heard that he was chosen to host the oscars, i thought it was kind of random because i didn't know what he really had to offer to entertain so many people. well i found out yesterday he sings and dances, but i wasn't really in the mood to watch a musical, really. i thought the first song was sort of corny (lyrics-wise) but he sang it really nicely. and yeah i heard other people today saying that they thought the beyonce thing was too long.<br>  <br>  i was actually thinking the same thing yesterday about Billy Crystal. I still remember his opening video where he placed himself in different segments of different movies =)|`|Ta7snyIoaa	Eh. The opening was kind of cool but it lasted for like ever. My mom and I were watching it and she left for like 7 minutes and came back "He's still singing?" <br>  I couldn't really get into it either. I didn't really like the way they set the theatre up either. I would hate being that close but that's just me.....|`|TUiT6uhpaa	I thought that I was only one who thought this! Thanks for agreeing with me.  I loved it when Billy Crystal was the host!|`|koVk3P9Gaa	There is ALWAYS way too much other crap going on than what the show is really about.|`|ec59e2fe502e4baed06af035a56a77d0aa	i actually thought the dancing and singing at the oscars was so cool! at the same time, it seemed funny to me with all the dramatics and whatnot =)|`|gW0nD5cEaa	I only saw a small part of the beginning and the last hour, but I would say the musical numbers are better than most of the speeches. <br>  <br>  I liked Hugh Jackman and thought he was good; but I agree, Billy Crystal really does the best movie spoofs of any of the hosts. <br>  <br>  The biggest problem with Academy Award nominated songs, often, unless you've seen the movies (I haven't) or really paid attention at the movies, you will not know them. Often they are not hits until after the awards, if then.|`|135587141c574a1880bd4e34dcbdb34caa	I liked it - maybe becuase it was Jackman who was singing.  I also liked that he started to laugh in some of the dance routines (like the techno Reader dance).  The Beyonce thing was okay, a bit disjointed maybe, but still enjoyable.

bribxhsdaa	I disagree about commercial hip hop pailing in comparison to mainstream. That's an extremely general statement that is uber subjective. I'm directly in the middle of the mainstream ------- underground spectrum as both are capable of feats of extreme garbage as well as extreme brilliance. The idea hinges on what underground/mainstream artists you listen to specifically.<br>  <br>  But as far as "Where do radio stations get the idea that all people want to hear is rap&pop type hip hop?"<br>  <br>  I think it's all about market...It's like when people say "Video Games are for children!" But there are just as many if not more adults playing video games than Children. <br>  <br>  The prototypical "Hip Hop head" who's a real purist and doesn't care for Collabo's like "Lollipop" and "Low" doesn't mean a thing to radio stations/record exec's as they don't buy the CD's that are selling millions and  aren't requesting "A Milli" 50x over - That's realistically not who they're selling to.<br>  <br>  I asked my youngest brother who his favourite rappers were last year...and all the artists he named were ear-rapists. It's him and his little friends who beg their parents to buy them "Tha Carter III" and "The Real-ist" that they're aiming for. And there will never be a shortage of them.|`|bLr5Wbmraa	The consumer is, the industry throws out ideas to the public, and whatever is responded to more, they play that kind of music more.

And it's true.  They are working under the impression that the people who really love Hip Hop are poor and poor people will just steal the music.  Rich people will pay for it.  It's wrong but that is what is going on.|`|T3X7Aci4aa	There's probably about a 50/50 split between hip hop listeners that like commercial hip hop and hip hop listeners that hate commercial hip hop. Here's a segment of an answer I gave to another question a few days ago (I don't feel like retyping/rewording it):<br>  <br>  "At any given time there are maybe 25 hip hop artists that are truly mainstream. Those 25 artists get to split the mainstream half of the hip hop audience. In the underground, there are thousands of artists cannibalizing each other's potential to become mainstream and nobody really gets a large piece of the pie. If everybody and their little brother stopped trying to be a hip hop artist, the underground hip hop community would shrink, and instead of selling 2000 copies of an album, underground artists might start selling 50,000 or 100,000 and the big shots would start seeing potential in underground artists, and would have a reason to start giving them radio spins and other forms of advertisement."<br>  <br>  Basically, it's the ridiculous amount of artists that are trying to bring back real hip hop that are keeping commercial hip hop popular. If they're not doing it for the money, they keep doing it when they're not financially successful and nobody gets weeded out and disappears. That's where the aforementioned cannibalism occurs. More people need to just be fans of the art instead of artists. It sounds dumb to say we need less real hip hop artists, but it's true.

euZRbiA2aa	Because they got very popular,and they think green day sold out.I dont understand it myself.|`|16t0eV0Uaa	I like them, I think they went way down hill with American idiot though, that album was overplayed and made alot of people pretty much stop liking them.  I don't get why people don't like them either, I can enjoy 3 chord pop/punk songs every once in awhile like Green day, offspring and the such, I think everyone has their own taste though, and if they don't like Green Day, they don't like them... world would be boring if everyone liked the same thing.|`|DnWsMhwLaa	i remember when i was in middle school and dookie came out and i thought it was the coolest thing since nevermind. i dont think i have listened to that album since middle school. insomniac seemed toothless and when they came out with that "time of your life" song it was clear that they had reached full fledged sell-out. so that isnt really suddenly. that is 10 years ago people started to hate them.|`|qThmcR1Aaa	Oh, who knows why people think what they do. People hate Coldplay, too, and the only reason you usually get is because "they suck." Well, gosh, thanks for the penetrating insight and analysis there.<br>  <br>  Green Day is maturing. I never thought much about their music until "American Idiot," which is a fascinating album because it's so vibrant and diverse. There are lots of ingenious twists and turns in the music ... there's still a raw immediacy to the music, yet it has enough depth to make it more than just another disposable flavor-of-the-day album. They've struck a nice balance, and I hope to hear more of it with their upcoming album.|`|qnjKtXZeaa	they used to be punk but now people think that only emos listen to their music. idk. despite what other people think, i still think they rock!|`|ebxwADDcaa	suddenly? people started hating them after their first couple cds|`|AIhL8wLkaa	Well, some people hate their new stuff, but that's common for a lot of bands, especially those who just want the band to do the same old stuff.<br>  <br>  <br>  But most of the hate come due to basing it off emo scenesters who ransack bands, giving them bad images.  Posting stuff like "OMG, LIEK BILLY IS HAWT! I LUVE HIM".<br>  <br>  <br>  Truth is, Green Day is a great band, and they don't try to repeat themselves on every album.  I'm still waiting for their new album.|`|t2evcVVEaa	green day is getting old enough now to where people can start to hate thier "new stuff" 99% of these people dont have a basis for thier hatred and are probably just angry at the fact that green day has been pumping out quality music since the early 90's. dont worry. people arent anti green day. just people who dont matter. Green day has had astounding success in the last 5 years or so and that just irks some people. and i promise that billy joe and the gang will continue to rock for a very long time.|`|JwnHKTabaa	They've always been crappy. I think I MIGHT have liked A song when I was like, 12, but since then I've realized what real music is. <br>  <br>  They suck, period.|`|SOGkJSN4aa	i dont know why their hating them<br>  green day is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  i love their old stuff.. like "basketcase", "time of your life", and "when i come around"..but their newer stuff is good too =)|`|ld1vh7nHaa	this didn't happen suddenly...green day has sucked from the beginning.|`|AA12093934	Suddenly???? I've been anti-green day for as long as I can remember....|`|aJ9S77fDaa	BRING ON 21ST CENTURY BREAKDOWN BABY!!<br>  haha,<br>  <br>  idc.<br>  because green day went and my chemical romance came.<br>  it was uncool to like green day since they had gotten so big.<br>  look what happened...|`|vidiDXxBaa	They used to be punk. Now they're pop punk which sucks.|`|j8CeFZOvaa	I'm with you. I really don't know why. A lot of people on this page are ignorant by the way. Green Day is an amazing band. They haven't released a bad album yet, and their new one - 21st Century Breakdown is the most anticipated album of the year. American Idiot also one a few Grammy awards so how do they suck? It's simple. They don't. I also think that some people really liked the "Dookie" era of Green Day, so when they heard American Idiot, they were like "Wow, this sounds too political, I automatically hate it!" even though It was one of their best albums. That isn't fair to the band. They are human beings and write music for themselves. And unlike most bands they don't want everything to sound the same. It can get boring writing and doing the same stuff which Is why they are starting to take a different route. I like and respect the band, and I feel that anyone that says they suck is very narrow minded. I hope this helped. Peace :)|`|GC33G1Gtaa	People aren't suddenly anti-Green Day.  They have hardcore fans like you, but when it comes down to it Green Day is a pop band.  They sound like every other pop band.  Ignoring the occasional die-hard fanatic pop listeners are fickle.  They always want 'new' music because they are tired of hearing the same thing all the time.  But they will always hear the same thing all the time as long as they continue to be pop listeners.  Here's how to find out if you're a pop listener or not:  Check out your local pop rock station for a few songs.  Then listen to the pop country station.  Then Listen to a few hours of Saturday morning cartoons.  If they all sound different, then Congratulations!  You are a pop listener - a sheep and the bane of human existence.  I hope to meet you all someday so I can smash your faces in with your own radios.|`|01dExFwDaa	politics, people are suddenly realizing that you cannot get real political advice from rock stars that smoked there childhood away and are now using the fame that MUSIC got them to go political. when a quarter of your concert is used to discuss politics rather then playing music people tend to stop caring.|`|6ZI2Fhgiaa	Perhaps you are looking from a different perspective, and the people who seem "anti-Green Day", were actually that way all along.<br>  And maybe people got sick of waiting for "21st Century Breakdown".<br>  <br>  Also, a lot of people who "loved" Green Day were probably just love-sick teenies who think "billy-jo iz lyk...HAWT!!!!1111".<br>  <br>  But I still love them as well.<br>  <br>  .tf.|`|oUZLZusjaa	It's nto sudden. It's been pretty much forever, their music didn't start out AMAZING but i twas alright, its been in a decline ever since, and I guess you're just noticing it now cuz American Idiot pretty much put the nail in the coffin and shut down the insane theories of anyone who still had even a shadow of a doubt that Green Day might be a half-decent band.|`|cYgxTWDVaa	Because people see them as sellouts.<br>  <br>  And you how it goes, regardless of your older music being good or not they'll still hate you based on your current status.<br>  <br>  I never liked them anyway before so i'm just giving out the reason most people think.|`|gQkPrGAQaa	Suddenly? There has been an anti Green Day sentiment for god knows how long.|`|wAzNCS48aa	I Dont Know ... GREEN DAY ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!

The editing is like that of a drugged-out, hight on meth, frenetic film editor (I've known many film editors and they HATE Bay's cutting; in fact they came up with a name for it several years ago.  They call his style of editing "Frame-*******.")<br>  <br>  He also has a lack of sensitivity in his visuals (again, they reek of MTV cliches), and he has not yet mastered the art of directing a performance out of an actor.  One last thing - the film AND fan communicty gave him a nickname a long time ago, "Mr. Explosion."  (you can  go figure that one out).<br>  <br>  George Lukas? He's a victim of his success with Star Wars. First you must know, all Hollywood hates that kind of gigantic success.  It's a town shot through with envy and hate over others' successes.  Really. <br>  <br>  And generally speaking, Hollywood's science-fiction films took a 40-year step backwards because of Star Wars (to the time of the 1930s and 1940s serials, like Flash Gordon & Buck Rodgers).  Sci-fi movies, about the time Star Wars was relased, were finally catching up with the intellectual works in sci-fi fiction, but with Star Wars, Hollywood abandoned these kind of movies (a prime example of the intellectual science fiction movie is Lucas' own THX1138), and began copying Star Wars, a very simplified kind of fantasy sci-fi. It was actually a leap backward.<br>  <br>  Even Lucas wasn't happy.  He said he never wanted to make another Star Wars film; wanted to go into experimental filmmaking and push the boundries of cinema. Instead, he was literally straightjacketed by his own success; he couldn't escape the worldwide, gigantic success of Star Wars, and eventually came back to it. And he hasn't really ever left it since. <br>  <br>  In the meantime, his most creative years were spent on 6 Star Wars movies, and that other offshoot of the 1940s serials, Indiana Jones, (just a stone's throw away from Buck Rodgers) . . . this when he could have gone off to do more films like American Grafitti and THX1138.

AA10614226	Hueco Mundo is located between the human world and Soul Society, though it is separate from the bordering dimension known as sangai. It can only be accessed by tearing the dimensional fabric separating the worlds, which allows Hollows to travel to any other dimension at will. Depending on the hollow, the effect of this process varies. Regular hollows usually appear from a small black vortex or form out of smoke, while Menos-class Hollows quite literally tear the sky apart to emerge. Arrancar use a more stable variant of the latter technique known as Garganta.<br>  <br>  The landscape of Hueco Mundo is a seemingly never-ending white desert, with dunes like those of the Sahara. The desert is littered with what appear to be boulders and shriveled trees, but these are actually a form of quartz. In Hueco Mundo, the moon is on the opposite lunar phase of that in the human world. Like in Soul Society, the atmosphere is filled with Spiritual Energy in the form of Spiritrons, but it is more concentrated, thus allowing smaller hollows to gain nourishment despite the lack of human souls.<br>  <br>  Like that in real world deserts, active life in Hueco Mundo appears to be few and far between. Hollows generally seem to dwell below the surface or in other areas until something provokes them to leave their shelter, like the intrusion of a foreign entity. According to the Shinigami, all Hollows dwell in Hueco Mundo regardless of their shape, size, or power.<br>  <br>  Hueco Mundo is also the location of Las Noches, the headquarters of Aizen and his recently-acquired army of arrancar.|`|6PSnZDhDaa	The hollow world is called Hueco Mundo, just like the Shinigami world is called Soul Society...<br>  <br>   It is a dark place... with not much life in it, except for spirit particles that hollows in every form feed on... <br>    though i highly doubt it is enough for them since they come to earth to hunt on poor souls|`|ubtXNWFpaa	Simple<br>  It is the world where hollows live i.e hollow world

It will take a little time, but in my experienced opinion, your ear for timing and music is the one most important part of learning to play.

Ow6lKFXiaa	You might want to ask this again in the Mental Health section.<br>  <br>  Just about anyplace you'd go but, of course, geared to that person's mental age.  If their mental age is on a child's level, I suggest a children's museum...they can touch all the exhibits.  A petting zoo or a farm that's open to the public. A local animal shelter (call to arrange a special visit).<br>  <br>  This is not an easy one...there are so many places where the senses can be fulfilled but, unfortunately, are not very welcoming to those with special needs.<br>  <br>  Is this one person or several with varying abilities?<br>  <br>  Anyplace that encourages touch, smell, taste.  <br>  <br>  A park to smell, see, hear, feel nature.<br>  An ice cream shop, sample different flavors.<br>  A store that sells musical instruments: ask if they will allow your friend(s) to touch the instruments...the deaf will feel the vibrations and can enjoy along with those who hear.<br>  A candle store...the aromas and the waxy feel and different candle shapes.<br>  A fabric and craft store...fabric & plastic flowers, candle perfumes, fake stones of varying smoothness, rubber stamps, wood shapes, etc.<br>  <br>  Check with the manager of the stores so they know that you will be handling the items and to avoid trouble.  Many are very receptive and will even direct you to items that involve the senses. <br>  <br>  The local mall...it has many stores to explore: costume jewelry, stuffed animals, music, wind chimes, etc.<br>  <br>  I hope these ideas help.  Thank you for going out of your way to enrich the lives of those who are different.|`|Shp5riE6aa	I don't see why this is in the joke section.

24d30303d7dfdc03b1d6d393f19ad4bcaa	I think luck factor is very important in making us a successful person in our life. Even though we worked out hard everything, we could be deceived by our fate sometimes. But in my opinion, working hard is the primary thing we have to do to depend on the luck. Simply sitting idle and waiting for the luck to change our life is not possible in most cases. In some rarest of the rare cases, everything they handle is turned into gold and luck itself turns their life without any attempt.|`|v0sdoQy5aa	just watch out and you can be next rahman........|`|CrmCHVI0aa	yep|`|kgHBKcbAaa	yes|`|Wjlg0nLZaa	Hmmm.... so wat difference does it make whether u beleive or not i mean whateva has 2 happen will happen so dont think so much n leave evrythin 2 god n i do beleiive n i fell its not luck but DESTINY|`|z5O056Beaa	Yes after I getting the highest marks in maths and then failing in English  ToTaLLy|`|39OVFs5Raa	Luck is wishful thinking come true!

bDaxhA5aaa	Hi, Cinn<br>  Short answer: Maybe. The Aluma P90 is a drop-in replacement for the original P90 (which is a single-coil, not a humbucker), but the P90 is narrower and longer than a humbucker. Lace also makes a straight humbucker Aluma that might be a better fit. Nice-looking, too! Measure before you order. Also measure the depth of the pickup hole. Some bridge pickups will be too deep to fit under your strings because the neck-to-body angle of Strat-family guitars is much flatter than Gibson-style guitars. Same with single-coils; they're not all the same. Look for one that says it's made to fit Strat dimensions.
ba52jQHyaa	No I don't believe that.  While I do think there is stuff on TV that is just wrong, I also think that trying to get rid of it would be as bad as folks that try to burn books. IMHO|`|48846255239e6cfd4e8b805cbae9c844aa	that depends on how you monitor its use, in my household, we dont watch Jerry Springer and Maury Povich, we watch Animal Planet, and the History Channel etc...|`|7YkO9zmOaa	I don't think that's possible. While it is very bad for children and lazy natured people, the news and information it provides is almost unequaled. <br>  Without television, we would lose a main provider of connectivity, between the average person at home and world related events.|`|jz9LW0P0aa	The harm in television depends on what you watch. I watch Natgeo and Discovery Channel a lot. I also LOVE Spongebob so I watch Nick sometimes too. Those shows and channels don't usually have inappropriate content. If let's say you let a small child watch HBO or Oxygen then TV  is very harmful!<br>  <br>  Also most people find out about the world by watching CNN or MSNBC. TV provides a lot of information about current events and even historical information(History Channel-another of my favourites).|`|JYw3hRV8aa	I don't think so. Televison can inspire knowledge as well as violence. There is nothing wrong with enjoying comedies like the Simpsons and the such.

AA12397532	Certainly NOT. Yes, it has an indian theme and lot of idian artistes and technicians, but it is a Holywod film.like earlier genre Richard Attenorough's Gandhi or David Lean's Passage to India. An Indian film is, of which the producer is basically a member of IMPPA and technicians from the approved associations of indian cine workers Federation are used - irrespective of where the money comes from and what nationality the producer or director is. He can be an american, member of Imppa - and make a film in Australia, yet it would be considered a indian film.

9rLi9pSRaa	From what I understand all the members of the Academy which is all the actors are sent the movies and then they vote for the categories.  The results are kept in the envelops and then given out on the night of the awards.  It is a democratic process for the voting but before that the studios give parties and try to convince the members to  vote for their particular movies.  Lots of smoozing goes on.|`|CFZ4ISNNaa	Yep, members of the academy. The academy consists of actors, writers, directors, producers, etc... Academy members vote for their peers...so directors vote for directors, actors for actors, cinematography for cinematography..etc...  The votes are tabulated by an independent accounting firm.|`|XNfjaPaSaa	As has already been said, it's a vote by members of the academy...directors vote on directors, writers vote on writers, etc.  The exception is that I think everybody gets to vote for Best Picture.
T5DbLLgQaa	Sorry to say but it looks like the smoking has already done its damage in your throat, it can take a lot of time for your vocal cords to recuperate! Smoking causes swelling in your larynx so that is why your voice sounds lower than what it would be without smoking. Only time will tell how your voice will be shaping up!|`|0wf8Q1Raaa	you might need your tonsils taken out.|`|qsiAMpfvaa	You just need to take a small break from singing.  Just try it for about a week and try not to talk much.  These things take time.  It sucks I know but I've been there.|`|RjDhPvGUaa	Your voice is good stop being negative!!!|`|TUiT6uhpaa	Do you really sound like Janis Joplin? COOL!|`|qVXmSEVGaa	our language therapist has it right.<br>  Smoking is so devastating to the body as a whole.  Look what it's done to your immune system- when you get sick, you immediately lose your voice.  The odds on that happening to a non-smoker are pretty low.<br>  10 years worth of poisons on your vocal cords will not be removed by two months worth of rest.  you're going to need to be patient so that your body can throw off as much of that stuff as it can- at least 4 more months to get the first layer- before you'll feel the effects in your voice.<br>  There are no miracle cures, or quick fixes to speed this up, but if you mind your general health, and make sure you drink your 8 glasses of water a day, you'll be doing your whole organism a favor. If you find, after a couple more weeks, that you still don't feel right about your voice, please consult an Ear-Nose-Throat doctor. S/he can take a look inside your throat, and tell you more about the state of your vocal cords. It's a non-invasive procedure, and is worth the peace of mind.<br>  After you've achieved your six-month mark, think about having some lessons with a qualified teacher.  Let them know this history, and see if you get an honest answer.  If you are promised quick relief, don't fall f or it! Recovering from smoking damage takes time and patience.<br>  Congrats on doing the right thing for yourself, and taking the steps to re-invest n your own health.  Keep up the good work!

Actually, it was Paul Fusco, the creator of ALF, but same difference in my eyes :)<br>  <br>  The entire set of ALF was done on a raised platform with trap doors everywhere.  There were 3 puppeteers:  Paul Fusco was the main one.  He controlled one hand and the mouth.  Another person controlled the other hand and a third person controlled the facial features.  The voice of ALF was Paul Fusco.|`|gW0nD5cEaa	There were different "Alfs' if I remember right. Some scenes used a muppet-like Puppet, those were when he was sitting still or in one place.

The lines were done by another actor, not the guy who was the puppeteer. <br>  <br>  So in a different scene, it might have been a different Alf.|`|nWUJgykxaa	I always thought a dwarf was dressed in an Alf costume....

ghXH7JZRaa	Depending on how often you get rentals and return them, Netflix had this little known practice known as "throttling". This means that their heavy users (people who returned movies more frequently than others) would be put on the bottom of the list to receive new releases, since Netflix makes more money on people who only watch about 4 DVDs per month. This is primarily due to the shipping, which cost them about .85 cents per DVD.<br>  <br>  So if you get more than about 10 DVD's a month, you should expect to be put on the bottom of the list to receive your new release.|`|Pi8MNN0oaa	nope, my brother uses it and he hasn't been complaining...|`|AA11601079	Ooh, that stinks.

YrdUWtSCaa	"We Shall Overcome" is a protest song that became a key anthem of the US civil rights movement. The lyrics of the song are derived from a gospel song by Reverend Charles Tindley. The song was published in 1947 as "We Will Overcome" in the People's Songs Bulletin (a publication of People's Songs, an organization of which Pete Seeger was the director and guiding spirit). It appeared in the bulletin as a contribution of and with an introduction by Zilphia Horton, then music director of the Highlander Folk School of Monteagle, Tennessee, a school that trained union organizers. It was her favorite song and she taught it to Pete Seeger,[1] who included it in his repertoire, as did many other activist singers, such as Frank Hamilton and Joe Glazer, who recorded it in 1950. The song became associated with the Civil Rights movement from 1959, when Guy Carawan stepped in as song leader at Highlander, and the school was the focus of student non-violent activism. It quickly became the movement's unofficial anthem. Seeger and other famous folksingers in the early 1960s, such as Joan Baez, sang the song at rallies, folk festivals, and concerts in the North and helped make it widely known. Since its rise to prominence, the song, and songs based on it, have been used in a variety of protests worldwide.

hJP9y6kjaa	Simply put, you need to have a discussion with her, face to face.<br>  <br>  1) what are her goals with this band - do they match yours?<br>  <br>  Be specific - you want to write enough material to release an album by the end of the year (end of December, give an actual timeline), you want to play 2 gigs a month eventually, and you want to get an audience of at least 100 people each gig so the record companies will take you seriously and you have a better chance at being signed, etc. These are just examples, but if you set a specific goal now, you are more likely to achieve it.<br>  <br>  What are her goals, and do they match yours? If not, perhaps you need a different vocalist, one who matches your aspirations more closely.<br>  <br>  <br>  2) how committed is she in achieving these goals - and do they match the how committed the rest of you are?<br>  <br>  I treat practices and gigs like a job - I show up on time, my gear is in good working order and sounds as good as it can, I've practiced, I'm sober, I dress appropriately, I play like I'm in front of a crowd (whether I am or not), I'm professional, and *focused* on making it successful. It's a good attitude to have - that's the type of dedication that makes a band succeed, or even if it's just for fun - take it seriously, be prepared, and it'll be a lot better for everyone.<br>  <br>  Be specific - you need her to show up on time, she needs to practice the material in her spare time, she needs to get better equipment, she needs to write lyrics or a song (maybe to meet the band goal of a new song every month, or every other month?), she needs to be focused, etc. If you practice twice a week, she needs to be there. Work around schedules, that's hard, but once it's set, it's set in stone except for emergencies. Whatever the level of commitment, she needs to meet it (the same as you guys).<br>  <br>  You don't perform at work, you slack off, you show up late, etc you get fired - and explain that she's on probation, that if she doesn't show the same level of commitment as everyone else you'll need to find a new vocalist *because you want the band to be successful*.<br>  <br>  3) Be specific, be professional, don't let it be personal.<br>  <br>  For a business to succeed you need a plan, and everyone has to be able to do their part. If she can't or won't, then you need to find a better fit.<br>  <br>  She will probably take it personally to some extent - but it doesn't sound like she's all that dedicated at this point, maybe she's just not as in to it as she thought she would be. Some people are more in love with the idea of being in a band than actually being in a band...<br>  <br>  I played with a group of guys, and the singer was like that. Not disciplined, not dedicated, didn't write, just wanted the glory without having to do the work. It ended up not working out - for those reasons.<br>  <br>  If your friendship is strong enough, it'll survive. If she wants to be in the band badly enough, then she'll clean up her act. If she doesn't want it, then she'll be out of the band - and it's nothing personal, it's business.<br>  <br>  I've been kicked out of a band before. It was rough. Still smarts a bit - but at the end of the day, our goals didn't match up, and our personal styles didn't match up. Plus, there were personality conflicts of it - I'm a little alpha, but I wasn't the leader. I got over it, mostly. It's tough, though... but you gotta do what you gotta do if you want to make it.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  <br>  Saul|`|t2evcVVEaa	yes. kick her out. i have been a record producer for Geffen Records for a very long time. and nothing brings down a group faster than a weak link. If she cannot serperate the lines between friendship and business then thats her fault. trust me, the chances of her taking this in a great way are slim to none. the question is, how dedicated are you? just explain to her that the band, as a unit, has agreed that they would like to take the group in a different direction and that she currently doesnt fit the bill for what you guys want. all musicians, especially vocalists have egos. so chances are that it wont end idealy. but no matter what, keep your chin up and be polite, couteous and professional while youre removing her from the band and therafter. ive dealt with this a million times.|`|NP5KV0VNaa	I think you should first tell her what's going on and that she should make an effort if she wants to stay and all that stuff. If after a while she's still the same get a replacement ready before you kick her out!<br>  Hope your band grows better.

I really enjoyed what I saw and am looking forward to renting it.|`|05whH2R2aa	yeah|`|19YfKNpJaa	I think so.  This was an exceptionally well made film from a number of viewpoints.  If you haven't seen it, I think you owe it to yourself to do so.  Easily the best movie I saw this year.<br>  <br>  [minor tangent:<br>  The link Kartik shares above offers an interesting point of view, but mainly claims that the movie is not worth of an Oscar because it (a) does not paint a realistic (or perhaps a good) picture of India and (b) is illogical.<br>  <br>  I'll deal with (b) first.  Yes, the fact that a Slum dog knows Benjamin Franklin is very far-fetched.  That's kind of the point.  Doesn't this guy get it?  This is a movie about fate/destiny.  "It is written," after all.  I thought that was spelled out pretty clearly (in fact, perhaps TOO clearly, if I were to find fault here).  The author of the article also finds it far-fetched that the Slum dog's brother should make the choice he makes at the end of the film (I'm trying not to spoil anything).  His character has changed.  This happens in virtually all good movies.  <br>  <br>  As for (a), I'll simply ask, when has it been a requirement that a movie be realistic to win an Oscar?  I remember the third Lord of the Rings movie winning best picture...does that paint a realistic picture of society?  It's complete fantasy.  A best picture award is essentially an award for best storytelling (involving a wide range of technical aspects)...the award is not for the story being told, but how well the story is told.]|`|P9S5wlLyaa	Yeah, but only because there were very very few good movies this year.
fEBOzWeXaa	As a sci-fi fan since the 60's, I rarely see any sci-fi tv show or movie get the love they deserve.  All the Trek stuff was laughed at, put down, made fun of but still around.  The new movie this spring proves there is an audience.  Same with the Doctor Who series, which is older  than dirt but always great. Torchwood, new, edgy, pushing the envelope with scripts, relationships, etc.  All fabulous.  Farscape, gone now but not forgotten, same with Stargate:SG1.  Sigh....<br>  Sci-fi in general sometimes gets special effects awards but not many others.  Too bad too.<br>  I have been glued to BSG since the first episode and will be sad to see it end but I expect great things for those last few episodes and have never been disappointed so far.  The acting is superb, the direction, special effects, music, all of it off the charts but alas, no love from "official" sources.  Sad.|`|XNfjaPaSaa	Because the Emmy voters apparently believe that if a series has any sci-fi or fantasy element about it, that automatically precludes it from being well-written, well-acted, well-directed, etc.  Genre shows have never gotten any respect from the Emmys.  I would argue Buffy the Vampire Slayer could offer BSG some competition for best series ever, and in seven seasons it got only one nomination that wasn't in a technical category.
kP0JGI1waa	Step 1: Play a death metal-esque riff<br>  Step 2: Slow it down<br>  Step 3: Make it more melancholic<br>  Step 4: Slow it down even more<br>  Step 5: Make it even sadder<br>  Step 6: Slow it down even more if possible<br>  <br>  But seriously just listen to Funeral, Shape of Despair, As Daylight Dies, etc for ideas, really the riffs are not the centerpiece like trad/stoner doom, its more about melodies with heavy chords under them.  I dont really know what to say other than that!|`|ebxwADDcaa	im not gonna tab out a guitar riff if thats what you want. <br>  <br>  my advice, get a 7 string guitar, or tune down a 6 string, and write something very slow and melodic. thats what doom metal tends to be so good luck|`|RJyhnT8jaa	You could get some ideas from this<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJCKKRoQasc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJCKKRoQa...</a>|`|8RtWoVWiaa	thats kinda a vague question <br>  world of lies by At The Gates<br>  Refuse/Resist by Sepultura

JWkd3wTXaa	The first Academy Awards were presented on May 16, 1929 at a private dinner held at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. Less than 250 persons attended and tickets cost $10. Public interest proved to be so high, however, that, in the following year, the event was broadcast live for one hour on a Los Angeles radio station. The Awards ceremonies were held in the Ambassador and Biltmore hotels until 1942, after which the accompanying banquet was discontinued. The war and increased attendance made banquets impractical.<br>  <br>  The first winners were known prior to the Awards banquets. Winners were announced to the press in advance so that the results could be published in the late evening newspapers on the night of the ceremonies. By 1940, however, guests arriving for the Awards were able to read the list of winners in 8:45 p.m. edition of the Los Angeles Times. The sealed-envelope system was adopted in 1941 and continues to be used to date.|`|adXLTt6Jaa	All I know is that it started 82 years ago|`|66TA4TMWaa	Actually Oscar award ceremony was first held at hollywood on 1929.

jR8kyp0Taa	It is Pictures at an Exhibition. It was written for piano by Mussorgsky, and then since has been transcribed for orchestra by many, most notably Ravel. Ravel's transcription is the most widely used orchestration of the piece.<br>  <br>  You got the notes wrong, but you were close. But here they are <br>  G F Bb, C F D, C F D Bb C G F (Those are concert pitches.

uMxl6mNfaa	I agree with the commenter above that it was silly of him to mention Obama in the speech, since the President is not in support of gay marriage.  It was very misleading of him to try and word it that way, like much of the No on 8 propaganda was.  Not all supporters of prop 8 are against gay rights.  It's true that some are hateful against gay people and should be ashamed of themselves, but many just don't see why a religious institution should be opened up to the public.  There is definitely a problem that needs to be solved, in my opinion by Civil Unions.  We need to respect the rights of every lifestyle, but considering something like this is more than I would expect from self-absorbed actors.  I'm sure he just wanted to be remembered as the "hero" that night.|`|P9S5wlLyaa	The guy who won for Documentary said something about how religion is destroying the world. That's more offensive, to me, than 'everyone should have equal rights'.<br>  <br>  When Halle Berry won for Best Actress, a few years ago, there was a big hullaballoo because she was the first black woman. No one complained that that was too political.<br>  <br>  Prop 8 denies basic human right to approximately 10% of Americans. That's not a political issue, it's an issue of morality, to me.<br>  <br>  I loved the speech. I cheered him. I'm so glad I'm Canadian, where everyone is more or less accepted. Prop 8 was disgusting.|`|b8e8a6de149259fd7a51d672221ab4e4aa	No but that's only because I don't like anything to do with Sean Penn.  Unfortunately actors take every opportunity to express their opinions whenever there is a microphone or reporter nearby.  I know it's a free country and all but just because they are a "celebrity" (and for some of 'em I use that term VERY loosely) doesn't make their opinion worth more, or less, than mine.|`|rebWUfLzaa	It was fantastic! <br>  Sometimes going political fits, like in this situation.  Other times, yeah- leave the politics for another time. <br>  <br>  Over all, I think Kate Winslet gave the best acceptance speech.|`|O5KOwhovaa	Yes, they should offer political opinions, particularly if their movies are based on relevant political and social issues. His speech was excellent.|`|80Dyljhdaa	Considering what the movie was about, it would have seemed hollow if he didn't mention it....Like he was just out for the award and didn't care about the issue.|`|1bf575e711cf9403c3bc6e5e84673885aa	It's a free Country so they can exercise their 1st Amendment Rights anytime.<br>  <br>  We can also exercise our right to change the channel.|`|0MZTh034aa	Senn penn is the best for now!<br>  I liked his speech.|`|owyHq86Haa	He has a right to free speech but maybe he shouldnt have praised Obama, an opponent of gay marriage in the same speech where he called opponents of gay marriage hateful. A large portion of people, Obama included, support equal rights for gays, but don't want the word marriage redefined. This would be the legal reality in the UK, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, California ( even after prop 8) and New Jersey.|`|aZXnW6AUaa	no|`|n55igpCUaa	And the Oscar for best acceptance speech of an Oscar goes to... Sean Penn!<br>  <br>  GAY LOVE!!!|`|d2RV8HTmaa	I was actually expecting something way more controversial coming from Sean Penn, so I think his comments were ok.  (I don't know about the "commy homo-loving sons of guns" thing though...).  But yes, if he had witnessed a show of hatred on his way in to the Oscars, I think that was a totally appropriate speech.  And it wasn't long and drawn out.<br>  <br>  But in general, I don't think celebrities should act like they are experts on political issues.  I see nothing wrong with a comment here and there.  We all do that.|`|6CAsx3jaaa	its hard to judge without seeing the protests outside that he was talking about. i give him slack partially because the speech before the award that reminded us about his charity work. i think he cares about people so its coming form the right place. im not gay but i dont care if gay people marry or not. considering the amoutn of money california was set to make with it legal i think they were stupid to vote it down.|`|kPMxo2MCaa	Yes I thought it was very appropriate, considering the film he was in.<br>  <br>  But I did think that Bill Maher's comments were totally out of line.|`|1b91ce32a95b13a1e9f83fdedfcea4f9aa	Sure the first amendment applies to everyone, regardless of when and where.

However, you may have a hard time with what is shown as a part of the movie. <br>  <br>  Dramatized, certainly...overly....maybe yes. Some parts are plain disgusting, but i think that is the director's preference rather than a choice people will usually make, even in India.

vEsSIGfYaa	I agree with you and the early reviewers; his performance in Dark Night certainly was no more than usually expected from a supposedly  professional actor, and I think the Oscar was just a bunch of hype.  This is a good example of a bunch of ignorant clods making hero out of a stupid drug abuser.|`|FBB1tbU4aa	No. He won that award because he did a phenomenal job portraying the Joker. No one will ever be able to match his performance of that character. And since when do mediocre actors get awards. He also won the 2005 New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor and the 2006 "Best Actor" award from the Australian Film Institute and was nominated for the 2005 Academy Award for Best Actor as well as the 2006 Best Actor award from the BAFTA for his performance in Brokeback Mountain<br>  <br>  You make it sound like he was I druggie getting high to forget his life.<br>  Do your research. He died of an overdoes of prescription medication.<br>  He had been taking Ambien because he suffered from bouts of insomnia. He also had a respiratory illness on the set of The Dark Knight. Most of the crew got sick as well and took antibiotics. I'm sure if you had really bad sleeping problems or got sick during work you would take medication for it. So don't look down on him for doing what most people would do.<br>  <br>  Your the one disrespecting someone. Have more respect for the dead.|`|x30Pwy6eaa	There are a lot of Intelectuals wannabe who diminish the value of a movie only because its main theme is superheroes, Benjamin Button is a lot worse movie, but nobody is complaining about his nominations.<br>  <br>  Expand your horizons, Joker it is a HUGE character, and Ledger fill the role quite well.|`|y1Yl6p9Qaa	Hellllooooo, don't you read the papers, it was an ACCIDENTAL overdose.

The only reason I am starring this is because I am hoping some of my contacts will reply to your question.|`|9030d7e77c630401d23f5177b57f3d36aa	I think he was a very good actor.  His other work was not mediocre in my opinion.  <br>  <br>  I think if he was alive he would have won.  I bet it was close between him and Robert Downey Jr (who also has some drug issues). <br>  <br>  I think he should have won an award for Chaplin.  <br>  <br>  The award was for their acting work..good point to keep it in perspective though.  I dont think I would want either one of them to babysit my kids or worship them as heros.|`|JIYKB6eKaa	he was awsome in dark knight especially when he did that "magic" trick in the confrence room and no he got the oscar because he was amazing in that movie|`|b10c5828972384201aa770b9f00357b7aa	no I don't think they sympathised with him, he actually did an amazing role in the Dark Knight<br>  I guess he got the oscar because of his role...|`|U1lmbP7kaa	I thought he was excellent in the dark knight.|`|qdTRWN96aa	I thought his performance was good at best and also wonder if he hadn't of died would he of won?<br>  <br>  I guess we will never know!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|FDt7cC8haa	You cannot make that statement unless you watch ALL the movie entries for that category....<br>  <br>  I think his performance was just shy of legendary...The only problem with his death is that the portrayal of the Joker will never be matched....|`|5lfnpGmUaa	Yes.|`|YB9hxefFaa	Of course, when you listen to all the hype Before you actually watch the movie your expectations are high. The performance generally fails in comparison. That's just how it works. I do believe you have your facts wrong regarding his "abuse" of drugs. "He disrespected himself, family and fans for that matter". Now you're just being disrespectfull, what are you? a doctor? therapist? .. but hey, we're all critics huh.|`|P8gGMlbIaa	Absofragginlutely damn it.<br>  <br>  I wasn't impressed with his performance either. And Hollywood with the way it idolizes drug users, this was a sympathy award.<br>  <br>  I'm more independent in thought, I don't fawn all over a movie or actor just because Hollywood gave it an award and a pat on the back.|`|UBgRugMgaa	No, it kind of attracted more people to see his movie but in my opinion I believe he acted phenomenally in that movie.  So good that no one can play the Joker as unique and scary as he did.<br>  <br>  We all have our opinions but please keep your remarks to yourself, try to have some respect for the dead alright?|`|rGWiOVDIaa	He was excellent in it. But usually that doesn't matter with the awards. I think him being a good actor and dieing just made it more likely people will complain if he didn't win.

29def525b4de3e4f1e95aaabfaa25f77aa	I agree with you to an extent. Mickey Rourke is not 'Hollywood" so he wasn't going to win. Sean Penn is very Hollywood and he played a gay character so PC California wanted him to win to show how progressive they are. Heath Ledger was gonna win no matter what. There would've been an outcry if he hadn't won. I think Slumdog was a good movie but it also stars an Indian cast and was filmed in poverty stricken India. Hollywood loves to honor movies like this, regardless of whether it was the best or not.|`|NqcnAnC1aa	I don't think it's fixed.  I think Slumdog is just a really good movie and everyone loves it, so it won big time last night. Get over it.|`|091ca1bd7e49158f5110601cac84ad3baa	They are not fixed but they are very very PC. That's  why I have stopped watching them. Everyone knew Heath would win because he died and Penn would win because he played a gay character and hollywood loves his activism.<br>  <br>  Slumdog was not garbage , it was a very good movie but I don't think the best but I did not see all the other ones that were nominated so...|`|b8e8a6de149259fd7a51d672221ab4e4aa	I think people get too worked up over this stuff.  You think "Slumdog Millionaire" was garbage but that's your opinion; obviously not everyone shares the same thoughts on it as you do.|`|EC2TSFj3aa	I agree. Scumdog Millionaire was total garbage and nonsense. It didn't deserve any of its awards. I was totally disgusted. A total fixer.|`|xplSmeCYaa	I don't think it was fix the people that won deserved the award.|`|b98399109be318e3b79301e0534af71caa	oh i don't know.. slumdog millionaire is an awesome movie but i was expecting The Reader and The curious case of benjamin button to win more....|`|RbILiqjiaa	The Oscars have been rigged for years. Usually the ones that win are the most liberal or the ones that have the most liberal actors starring in them.|`|iRL3eULWaa	i sort of agree, like mama mia did not win a single award, and like slumdog million air only just came out and has won like loads of awards, like is a bit like, omg thts rigged, but then u never know!|`|00edd366abb2b33249aae666469aaa31aa	No. The """academy""" votes their heart rather than their head.

As long as they're not 21+ clubs, you can generally get booked there if you're actually any good.

Rap is a verb.. It's what you do. To Rap is to spit lyrics (generally speaking).<br>  <br>  Hip Hop is the culture of Rap msuic. (it's actually one of the few genres where the name of the music isn't exactly the same as the name of the culture) It encorporates things such as Turntablism, Graffiiti and breaking.|`|Jwk7Ib2vaa	Rap is what it's called when they curse out your mother and say all of their friend's names in the "music." <br>  Hip-Hop takes more than one joint to come up with. People put time and effort and a lot of soul into producing something that really moves you. It makes you sway your head as you listen to it and will be in your head the whole day. <br>  I've never caught myself humming "Move, *****!", but I have been known to belt out "All My Life" by K-C and JoJo. <br>  hope this helps!|`|F4d89iRMaa	people who raps do it for the $, hip hop is for the soul and the love they have for hip hop!|`|35Lia4TPaa	Rap just sounds like they are talking in the lyrics.

kGkUG0fKaa	$80 isn't really expensive and it depends on the shoe you are looking at. if it is designed by some kind of bball player or athlete then it will cost more. If it is a limited edition, it will cost more. If it has multi colors, it will cost more. If it is for special class, like sprts, jogging, etc, it will cost more. It is NIKE! and they really don't need any other reason than the name to charge a lot...Look at the Jordan/Forces mix...too much for those and they look like normal NIKEs but, the name...it's all in the name!|`|2d798720df19272d2c93262dbfedc5a3aa	I always said I would never buy Nike (or other expensive brands) because you are just paying for the name.  However, I was at a stores "going out of business" sale and they had Nike's there for 30 bucks.  I bought the and they are the best sneakers I have ever had.  The soles are great, they fit my feet perfectly, and they are lasting a long, long time.  So, they really do seem to be better quality.|`|756bcca1e8dd300e8b207123fcb9759eaa	because people will pay the price. tell you the truth people pay way more even. shoes are kind of thing that 100. isn't out of line ...........it all depends and there are alot of shoe people out there. so your stuck. why only nike i get mine real cheap cause they aren't nike . i need my money for rent and keep my car going. that is something you can buy or not. like gas we are stuck unless we walk or ride a bike. but shoes just find another brand. most people like to show off and buy those name brands and i know some who have up to 10 pairs sometimes they sell me a pair cheap why i got.|`|YW74O9aNaa	thats just for the brand name! you can get the same quality for half the price :) or sometimes even cheaper!|`|YQZdBHFpaa	$80 is a lot.....they are half as much in stores....you should check like payless (or any other shoes store) or any other place like target.|`|X5hTmAkBaa	you buy the brand|`|IkWcwsj8aa	Profit..<br>  and greedy people|`|XlhBBZPxaa	brand name that is it|`|AA10281393	Try on a pair of less expensive shoes (like from Payless) then a pair of Nike; I'll bet you'll feel the difference. Brand names tend to be better made then a no name brand which is why you pay more. If you're still confused ask a salesperson in one of those stores you went to, I'm sure they'll have something to say.|`|YEHVu4tdaa	Because they know that kids will buy them so they can look "cool" to their friends.  If they were cheap no one would want them.  Nike exploit people in poor countries to make their products, then senseless people like you pay over the odds just so you can wear the latest style.|`|qtlzdtMVaa	lol It's because Nike are a top manufacturer in style, fashion and reliability.

71dc8b0b34bc9146e70f8ed00ac5dfdbaa	The first episode of the season had Faraday in a Dharma uniform at the Orchid construction site. Now Jin, also in uniform, is driving a brand new VW bus. I think the Island stopped in the time (1960's) when Dharma is building the Orchid Station. The survivors have probably infiltrated Dharma in the 1960's. Remember that Faraday was told by Charlotte that as a child she was warned by him not to return to the island. Faraday looked surprised by this so it probably hasn't happened yet. I think in an upcoming episode, we're going to see Faraday in the 1960's, along with the rest of the survivors, warning a young Charlotte.|`|8uvb3Nroaa	remember in the episode before, that we discovered Jin was alive and with all the time traveling/jumping he had met a young Danielle Rousseau. He then met up with Sawyer, etc.   When the Oceanic 6 got back on the island, they had no idea that Jin was alive. <br>  Why he is in Dharma clothes we don't know yet.|`|QmBIVAs9aa	Dharma Interference ?  Do you mean Dharma Initiative?  I think the question needs some more explanation.|`|cw2KARcPaa	No, the losties did not make the DHARMA Initiative. The Initiative was created off the Island and later moved to the Island because of the special properties the Island holds. This is clearly explained in the creation and use of the Lampost Station, in the basement of the church OFF the Island. Eloise Hawking said as much herself.  <br>  <br>  They, the leftbehinds,  have basically infiltrated the DI. They are stuck in the past since Locke fixed the donkey wheel. Jin, Sawyer, Daniel, Miles, and Juliet all are working for the Initiative in some capacity. They are using the stuff they learn there to figure out how to get back to the future, when all of a sudden the O6 (minus Aaron) have returned to the Island.<br>  <br>  I don't think we will learn too much about it this week, since we are going to learn about Locke and his death and his visits to those off the Island, but next week, we will learn what happened to Sun, Sayid, Ben and the other folks that were on Ajira 316.|`|AA10962298	Got me...I stay LOST with LOST...This non-linear time thing has gotten me way confused.

dSmoB64Yaa	Roots (1977) is the best. It's a TV mini series and is quite long at 573 minutes. It was written by an African American writer who researched his family history all the way back to Africa.<br>  <br>   A lot of people won't like this choice, but I really enjoyed this comedic look at a serious subject. I felt that it did show certain elements of slavery very well. It's called The Skin Game (1971). It's about a white guy and black guy who are basically equals and partners in a different kind of con  game. The white man continuously sells the black man as a slave and then breaks him out and helps him escape. Then they split the profits. It's a funny movie, but things get serious when the white man is unable to free his friend and partner, who is actually a free black man, with the papers to prove it. Not too many people would recommend this movie as a movie about slavery, because it's mostly a comedy. But I think it gets it's message across, without being overly preachy, plus it's well acted.|`|d2RV8HTmaa	The movie "Beloved" starring Oprah Winfrey, Thandie Newton and Danny Glover is not ABOUT slavery, but they were a slave family and it centers around the dysfunction of that family.

wvirUf9caa	ugly and a cheat|`|5p7cQAokaa	I find that Brad Pitt is at his sexiest when he isn't trying to be sexy. I don't like it when he grows his hair out, or bleaches it, or wears big sunglasses and fancy clothes.  Brad Pitt is sexy with a buzz hair cut and maybe a little scruff, just enough that gives him a relaxed look. THAT is when Brad Pitt is "out of this world good looking". <br>  <br>  I don't like it when men try to look "high maintenance".  The sexiest boys can wear relaxed jeans and a T-Shirt.  No hair gel, no spending 45 minutes in the shower, a little scruff for facial hair, just relaxed. Now THAT is sexy!!|`|nXZUOJ20aa	Hi,<br>  <br>  I think that hes 'passed his sell buy date' so to speak, when cheated on Jen with Ange, he went way down in the estimation of lots of women, plus, when i saw him last, he had a beard, whats that all about seriously!!<br>  <br>  Thanks x|`|NweoIIcdaa	I never found him THAT attractive, sure he was cute, but nothing special really...<br>  <br>  But yes he has defiantly passed his sell buy date.|`|Kk3sz1DUaa	Brad is still hot but he's definitely ageing badly ... and i'm not saying it cause i saw curious case|`|IupDRUKnaa	I think Girls can Overrate him.<br>  <br>  EDIT: He was okay in Fight Club, thats about it.<br>  =]|`|hjtCGo1Haa	Hes alright <br>  but alot to old know|`|OuWNzn8jaa	i wouldn't say hes ugly and it has nothing to to with his age, i just don't really think hes super super hot|`|7vuMDR2haa	He is still hot, I wouldn't kick him out my bed :)|`|1UOIoOzKaa	I think when he was younger he was cute.  <33<br>  But now in the Oceans films ect. He is past his date.<br>  He's more of a person older women like, just as my Mum does....|`|qOKFuXfLaa	nope- he was cute while he was with the beautiful Jennifer<br>  <br>  but ever since he became an adulteror the handsomeness was sucked out of him by the homewrecker that is Angelina. He is an ugly disaster now. I'll take Matt Damon or George Clooney over Arm Pitts any day.|`|PK9TjQf4aa	I always thought he was lovely when he was with Jennifer Aniston and then he lost all of his appeal to me when he left her for Angelina. Like when he appeared in Friends- he was HOT then!! <br>  George Clooney might be older but I would still choose him over Brad any day of the week.|`|kJ7mcPLbaa	The only time I ever thought he was handsome is when he did Legends of the Fall.

I have read the first "Harry Potter" book, and it was great! I'm guessing, probably.... better than "Twilight" but I don't know. Now, if it's movies we're talkin' than "HARRY POTTER"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Definitely!!<br>  <br>  "Twilight" SUCKED! It was pretty much just a giant teenage girl, fantasy about vampires piece of ****. It was SO melodramatic, with the acting, and everything. It didn't explain some things either. Like, why the Robert Pattison character couldn't read Bella's mind but he could read others?! WTF!? I will say that the acting was so so. But yeah, "Harry Potter" was MUCH better.<br>  <br>  <br>  PS - Ask Stephen King, and he'll tell you the truth. XD|`|K7n0DY8Faa	Story or moviewise, I'd rather have harry potter than twilight. twilight's story was crap. As for the actors, I'd chose the twilight guy. He's hotter. Daniel radcliffe was cuter when he was younger.|`|WpGROxH8aa	Both are awesome in their own way!<br>  I love them both. <br>  But if I had to pick, I'd say Harry Potter. If nothing else, the series was longer so we got to know the characters and the world better.|`|fzjRlJXWaa	TWILIGHT  XD<br>  Simply because it has hottt vampires ;)  <br>  <br>    TEAM EDWARD! TEAM JACOB! TEAM KAYTEEEEE!!|`|AA11480826	Harry Potter<br>  I like Twilight, but Harry Potter is AMAZING!|`|pFkGJlntaa	Harry Potter - the movies are more adventurous and you don't hear screaming teenagers in the movie house|`|6waltjKMaa	Harry Potter. There's something about that fantasy world that I just love<br>  I like Twilight too though|`|3Csq2nDbaa	Actually I prefer Twilight more because it is really a sensation. Harry Potter is getting old...|`|B2yFG17zaa	Harry Potter<br>  but there making loads of them Twilight films so it will probably turn out as big as Harry potter in the end|`|cegWMeYEaa	I didn't see "Twilight" yet, so I'll have to go with the Harry Potter movies. I love those anyway!|`|mmWlETzdaa	TWILIGHT....to me it seems more realistic than harry potter|`|wGWM2ZmZaa	Harry Potter by a mile!|`|WZZ4mIayaa	YOUR MOM. thats what i prefer.|`|HVKfuhp3aa	Harry Potter. There needs no explanation, it's obvious.<br>  <br>  Well... Overall, the character developement is much better. Also, it feels as if it really could be true, imo, whereas a bunch of bloodthirsty vampires(not the Cullens, in general) running around in the human world seems extremely unrealistic. I know some will say "and a bunch of wizards flinging around magic doesn't?" J.K Rowling explained thoroughly how wizards stay hidden and act normal around humans, and they have several spells to wipe human's memory to forget what happened. S.Meyer says that newborn vampires and even vampires go around chomping on people. Wouldn't someone eventually investigate or figure it out? The FBI don't drop cases that easily... <br>  Also, I've always wondered what happened when chicks were on their period when vampires were around.. eck.<br>  JK Rowling is overall a better writer. She describes scenes better, she makes emotions realistic(unlike Bella who is basically a flippin' zombie when Edward leaves. That was just pathetic. She has extreme mental problems.) and still makes you want to keep reading. Even Stephen King said that S.Meyer is a bad author, and he knows what he is talking about with over 350 million books sold.<br>  <br>  Oh yes, I've read both series and watched all the movies so I can judge. I've read the Harry Potter series 3 times whereas I wouldn't dare pick up the waste of paper, Twilight.|`|GPBRLG2saa	potter idiot<br>  and i love twilight but there is nothing as good as harry potter
vDGFRACaaa	Oh yeah, they kind-of look similar. But no, they're not related. Sorry.
JWkd3wTXaa	The first Academy Awards were presented on May 16, 1929 at a private dinner held at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. Less than 250 persons attended and tickets cost $10. Public interest proved to be so high, however, that, in the following year, the event was broadcast live for one hour on a Los Angeles radio station. The Awards ceremonies were held in the Ambassador and Biltmore hotels until 1942, after which the accompanying banquet was discontinued. The war and increased attendance made banquets impractical.<br>  <br>  The first winners were known prior to the Awards banquets. Winners were announced to the press in advance so that the results could be published in the late evening newspapers on the night of the ceremonies. By 1940, however, guests arriving for the Awards were able to read the list of winners in 8:45 p.m. edition of the Los Angeles Times. The sealed-envelope system was adopted in 1941 and continues to be used to date.|`|O5KOwhovaa	Thursday, May 16, 1929<br>  <br>  Hotel Roosevelt in Hollywood|`|Z0P4ybA5aa	Im assuming you mean the award oscar!<br>  <br>  The 1st Academy Awards ceremony was held on Thursday, May 16, 1929, at the Hotel Roosevelt in Hollywood to honor outstanding film achievements of 1927 and 1928. It was hosted by actor Douglas Fairbanks and director William C. deMille.
LrKCLZF7aa	You have a very powerful Magi Quad in your chart. The planets that are included are Pluto Venus/ Uranus Mercury.<br>  <br>  There are several possible carreers for you to choose from. The first one that comes to mind is something to do with language. Do you speak another tongue? I'd be surprised if you didn't because you have the talent to learn. What about world travel? There's got to be some money in that. Mercury endeavors are very good for your career. You could be very successful at anything that has to do with Mass Media, broadcasting, traveling, transportation especially if it's world transportation.<br>  <br>  These were calculated using the Midpoint conjunction of the two pairs of planets. This kind of conjunction uses 4 planets. And it gives you a lot of choices.<br>  <br>  I am only showing one of the MagiQuads that you have. There are more.

QGBYOLIxaa	He's doing that because you guys were fighting. I'm not a gemini, but I know many. I am a Taurus with lots of gemini in my natal chart and too much fighting would provoke me to become distant. The same goes for all geminis. When there is too much fighting they just walk away and disappear till they get over it. They will act nice when they leave you and then not talk to you or answer you for a WHILE and suddenly out of the blue they will come back like nothing ever happened.<br>  <br>  Basically try to avoid petty fights. If you must fight, chose your battles wisely. If you want him to come to you, act casual. Like you don't even remember fighting. Be happy. Text him casually but not desparately for two days or so and then stop. He'll wonder what happen to you and then start coming to you casually (which will be his way of showing he cares about where you are or what's going on in your life). ;) trust me, been there, done that.|`|cw2qwk9Uaa	There is no real nice way to tell you this,girl...He is an *** and doesn't care about you...Sorry...|`|C27AHHoiaa	my boyfriend is gemini too and that how he was when i 1st met him. but he was always going with his friends, but get use to that cuz he's always gonna want to be with his friends but show him you really like him. he'll come throw.

ebxwADDcaa	well there are a few things to do...<br>  <br>  1) get a better microphone<br>  if you cant do that...<br>  <br>  1)put the mic behind the speaker and cover the speaker with padding, it will be a little less likely to feed back there...<br>  2) do not sing too close to the mic, and do not touch it with your hands, because that causes feedback. <br>  3) my band did this once - put the singer in another room altogether...plug in the pa system in an outlet near a door and run the cable under the door. it actually worked more than we expected. <br>  4) get your drummer an electric drum set for practices, then you can turn him down if need be, and the guitars will not need to be as loud and you might not even need a mic to sing.

vDGFRACaaa	It sounds familiar, but which movie are you talking about? (I know Felix Lighter gets his legs eaten by sharks in License to Kill, but I don't think this is the scene you're talking about.)<br>  <br>  Rules to follow when watching Bond.<br>  1: Never try to make sense of it. It's a movie and almost everything happening is impossible or unlikely.<br>  2: Any films made in the 60s or 70s were made by people on drugs. Lots of drugs. Just because they thought it was a good idea at the time doesn't make it so.<br>  3: James Bond baddies are evil incarnate. Immoral, soulless, just plain nasty. They will laugh at anything, no matter how ridiculous or painful.<br>  4: Or it was just done for the lulz.
0MZTh034aa	Its the best movie of millennium.<br>  SRK(shah rukh khan) is not in it!|`|rnyCDBPpaa	I absolutely loved it.<br>  <br>  But then again, I find those types of stories to be very moving and interesting.|`|rUjqclLYaa	its a gay movie, i bet the actors stink like armpit like the rest of their people, the dark knight should be best movie|`|AA11455646	It is one of those movies that is good but not as great as the world is making it out to be.  Let's look at the facts: first, it was meant for straight to DVD and there was a sighting of how this movie is campy, second, the storyline is way out there and there is a lot of flaws in the storyline, and finally, the concept is something that isn't plausible where a lot of people from India will be offended.<br>  <br>  It is a good movie but I don't think it deserved all the awards.  I think there was "A little engine that could" mentality that overtook the reality of movie making.  It was set-up as the greatest thing since sliced bread and a lot of people in Hollywood have gone to making things happen when in reality it shouldn't have been done.<br>  <br>  Many people will read this and think I'm being mean.  I'm not, I did like the movie but I don't think it deserved all those awards.  I think Hollywood has deemed itself the "Goodwill Ambassadors to the World" and doesn't want to give out an image that they are heartless.<br>  <br>  A lot of times a lot of watchers often go, "I never heard of this movie and it won," but this time Hollywood went on the offensive and pushed this movie like it was gold.  They were at every morning show, every daytime show, and internet superstars.  What Hollywood fails to see, this movie wasn't well done and they made people feel bad about themselves.  A lot of people come out of the theatre thinking the movie is alright but 'God forbid" if they say they did not like this movie.<br>  <br>  When people question the whole premise, Hollywood pushed it to make them feel as if they were inadiquent.  <br>  <br>  So it is a good movie but not great!!!|`|EIG6MYVfaa	yeah i guess its a good entertaining film and offers some insight into mumbai (my hometown)......it appeals to western and Indian sensibilities....though it isnt serious or real cinema .......truth is worse everywhere.....watch it cos the child actors are great ....Its anil Kapoor in the film and not sharukh khan.......it isnt song and dance film o pls beware but it has jai ho in the end to satisfy those needs|`|8fYR9KMLaa	its a really nice movie and no S. Khan is in it|`|m6F8xULhaa	Shahrukh Khan is not in it sadly but the movie was wonderful! I loved it a lot and thought it was a bit like holes when they talked about the present and then went back to Jamal's past. Overall its a terrific movie and recommend that you see it.
RkItyg6iaa	There's a Jpop trio called "Perfume" and they do a lot of Electropop.<br>  <br>  My friend recommended a song of theirs called "Electroworld" and it's pretty catchy ^-^
qOKFuXfLaa	Yeah, I'm sick of her as well. <br>  I didn't watch the performance but everyone who is talking about her is saying that the performance was lip synced.|`|l45tBjTVaa	Yeah. I watched it and I was wondering the same thing. I'm pretty sure she was. I mean, of course, it's her voice...<br>  <br>  But most singers lip sync when they perform with dances...I mean, can you imagine running around and doing all those dance moves? Your voice would be shaky and you'd be out of breath...and proper breathing is one of the most important parts of singing. They just do it so the singing sounds GOOD. lol|`|iVP98E7maa	most definately|`|TUiT6uhpaa	Yes, she is so over rated!|`|KyLPuSoQaa	i dont think so|`|xplSmeCYaa	I'm so sick of her.|`|v6PVlRliaa	Yes, absolutely. It was clear from several angles that she was.  It wasn't a time delay thing either, because at some points she was singing in time with the song and at other points she was not.  Also, did you notice that several times when she started to "sing" that she turned away from the audience (by looking over her shoulder or turning around) so there was no obvious "lyrics starting before her mouth starts moving" moments.
