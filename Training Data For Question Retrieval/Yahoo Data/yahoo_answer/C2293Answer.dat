3ZZFJ2PKaa	I'm feeling the same way, but everyone says that the friends you meet in college will be way better, so let's both just stick it out!|`|e7663cf7226c2b25f5a64eeea04103cfaa	Don't worry.  Once you get into college high school won't even matter anymore.  It seems like a crazy thought now, but I was shocked at how little I talked to any of my friends from high school, and the friends I hang out with now I like a lot better anyways.      And kudos to you for recognizing this so early, a lot of the attitude that you and your friends had goes into college as well for a lot of people and they do not do well there.    ---edit    And also, try focusing on something that you would like to do in college.  A sport, some academics, hobbies etc.  It will give you something to focus on while you wait, and when you get there you will find people that you love with the same focuses as you! =)

Its all a matter of how much you put in.    They say for every hour spent in class you should spend 2 hours out of class doing work. It sucks, but you have to do it. Good luck, and college will get easier because you will get into a routine.
AA12178390	Public speaking is one of my few talents.     It comes natural to me but there are some very easy tips I think everyone could do.    When I see some one do a bad job public speaking 99% of the time I can tell exactly what the problem was when they were prepping.    1) Practice how you are going to say your speech.     It sounds simple but it is amazing how many people do not do it, and how often not doing it leads to them doing a bad job speaking. Even if you are reading from part of your speech, even if you are reading all of it, practice it out load so you know what you are going to say and more importantly HOW you want to say it. What key words you want to hit.     Also a secret tip with practicing, don't always practice starting from the beginning, every now and then practice starting from different places, that way if you mess up during the real thing it is easy for you to just take it from the next part.    2) Think about if YOU think it is boring.    Another big one that I seriously think a lot of people mess up. If the speaker thinks it is boring then the audience is going to think it is super boring. I can not begin to tell you the number of times I have listened to speeches and felt. "There is no way this person really thought we would find this interesting."     This is probably more important than even practice. Just think for a second "If I was in the audenice listening to me talk would I be bored?" if the answer is yes. Change it.    3) People love to be part feel like they are part of your public speaking.     Some people say "open with a joke" that's fine as long as your joke or jokes are on topic people love that. If you are talking about The spotted Owl and just telling knock knock jokes you are come across as silly. A few good on topic jokes spread out is often the difference between a bad speech and a great one.    But anyway to get people interactive with your speech is good. Ask the audience general questions, the phrase "by a show of hands...." is your best friend. Because it forces the audience to think about what you are saying and that's what they want (plus it allows them to move their bodies which humans like to do).     Which is probably the most important thing to remember, people want to like your presentation.    And thats really the most important thing, know that deep down no one wants you to do bad, they want you to be interesting so all you have to do is sprinkle a few bits of "fun stuff" inbetween the "boring stuff."     Practice your speech, see where you think it gets boring, if you think it is too boring, than change some of it, or add something fun to get their attention again.     Good Luck.|`|eQaApazjaa	ok back in middle school we were forced to give at least a 5 minute speech at the end of each year PLUS take speech class...    and im a nervous wreck before speeches. i dont mind talking in class..i raise my hand and talk a lot actually but speechs freak me out.     basically before every speech i would start like shaking, i would have to pee i was so nervous and i would get really hot! but basically...i would stand up in front of the class take a deep breath and start talking...when i would talk fast i would slow down and take a pause....then i would move a little bit (bc if theres not a podium in front of u its much better to move then stand there awkwardly..)    and i would remember to smile..because if ur expression on ur face is freight then thats not good. just keep breathing and the words will just flow right out...my speech i gave 3 years ago in 7th grade i dont evenREMEMBER giving! i like completely blacked out during it hahaha but i remembered everything and i got a 95.     good luck! go slow and speak loud and clear|`|4IJggI7caa	easy,   do what i do. admit your mistakes by telling jokes around them.   If you drop your report say well at least my pants didn't split or is it all too late??  use your arms as that makes it seem like you're really involved in what you're doing and most importantly ask your class!!! ask them questions whether you want them to reply or not and make jokes with your teacher, e.g. whilst laughing say what are they like sir/miss?  If you look interested or passionate about your report the class will believe they are too.  GOOD LUCK|`|xh1Ega5Daa	They seemed nervous because they weren't prepared, or didn't know their material well enough. Remember, when your up in front, YOU are the subject-matter expert, not the audience. Know your material well, almost to the point where you don't need cue cards. As for making it interesting, you NEED to involve the audience. Ask them (by a show of hands) how many of them have had family or friends that have died of a disease, or a rare condition. You might pick from one of those people who raised their hand to elaborate more. Of course, with most diseases there are some preventive measures. Ask the audience what they might be (again, by a show of hands) I stress the hands thing only because you'll want to maintain some control. Lastly, remember to have fun doing it. It's only going to be as boring or fun as YOU make it. Good luck...|`|5k2GI5ZYaa	do not say meaningless words like uh.well or pause too long in between sentences   also quote some sources to back up ypur stuff   loolk people directly in the eye  do not look down or away from them

Ftkr9jqYaa	This is almost certainly a misspelling of SCRAPINGS.  There is also a rare patronym, SCAPPINS ( http://www62.ownskin.com/wap_member_home... ), and a more common surname, SCAPPIN (see, e.g., http://www.ciachef.edu/restaurants/cater... ), in which case the term that you are citing is probably a reference to the Scappins family or a possessive noun (Scappin's).    The most common use of the word scrapings concerns epidermal (i.e., skin) scrapings, which can be surreptitiously obtained in order to perform DNA fingerprinting.    Another possibility is scrappings, which is a slang term for scrap materials.  For example, at an auto yard, there might be scrappings of old cars which can be purchased to repair the body of a vehicle damaged in a collision.    Scrappings is also a slang expression for material in scrapbooks, or for scrapbooking.    There are many verb forms of scrapping, such as:    (1) Fighting or fisticuffs;  (2) Collecting used or discarded materials for salvage or resale;  (3) 4x4 mud-riding; and  (4) Repetitious begging.

AA10023710	First, you need to go to a college and get your bachelors degree. After that, you go to med school to become a doctor.     You can go to any college you'd like for your bachelors degree, so long as it's respected and appropriately accredited. You want to do really well there, so it should be some place you like. You may want to use the college search tool at the Princeton Review website, or the one on www.collegeboard.com, to find colleges that fit your GPA and SATs, your interests, and the regions where you want to go to school. That'll help you find some you may like.

KVkU6WSpaa	The answer is $57.30.    Multiplying the original price by 1.10 would give you the new price, increased by 10%.    If you DIVIDE $57.30 by 1.10 (to get the original price) you would end up with $52.090909090909, which would not be a valid 'original' price.    All of the other answers, when divided by 1.10, end up with valid original prices, and are therefore possible candidates.    Hope this helps!
LAuC27Ciaa	First of all Im very sorry...  And if your in 8th grd you can always try again next year,  Hey you can try asking your guidance cons.  Oh I auditioned also, I dont know my results until a few days  So your guidance cons. told you or what?  God forbid I get rejected id like to know my score too :/
Mx07dTipaa	no it does not. i went to an inner city high school in queens,ny. and it certainly was not the best high school in the country. colleges look at EVERYTHING. your GPA, your SAT score (not both only one), and the type of classes you took. AP classes are a plus, not required, but def. a good advantage. your high school doesnt matter. if it did, then all the kids who attend a bad high school wouldn't make it to a good college. just focus on your grades, take advantage of the programs or clubs your school offers, and make sure you get a great SAT score (its not the only thing colleges will look at but it plays a big factor in your application).     good luck =)|`|tQGRJBYAaa	Very big effect, I go to a school rated about 90th best school in the whole US and going to the school will give you a major boost to college if your grades are okay to good.|`|R75tldc8aa	Colleges shouldn't discriminate over people's background or what school you go to. They'll look at your intelligence so if you have a high GPA and SAT scores they'll accept you. Which school you go to doesn't affect those scores.|`|8uwxNh4Kaa	Yes.|`|V6asuaxuaa	Somewhat. Ask your guidance counselor if when the school sends along your college applications (if they send applications for you) they include a "biography" of your high school - how it compares to other schools in the area and other schools in the country in terms of course difficulty, caliber of student, overall graduation rate and such. The reason is this: if your school does not provide such information to colleges, then your (for example) 3.2 GPA that you worked really hard for and includes two AP classes, is still less than Joe Smith's 3.7 GPA but he went to a school with much lower standards and doesn't offer AP classes. Unfortunately, there's no standardized way that high schools report this information to colleges, but if you're really worried about it, ask your guidance counselor to write a letter about your high school and its standards that you can include with your application. Another option would be to find out if your school has applied for any state/federal grants or had to do any type of reporting in recent years - the administration might be willing to share that document (or parts of it) with you to include with college applications. Good luck!|`|IGbLVBwkaa	I think colleges look at the high school you go to, but they mostly care about your grades and test scores.|`|rGdf04Fkaa	The high school you actually go to does not effect the choice a college makes in choosing you. But, your grades or GPA and SAT scores do matter a lot. AP and honors course can help too, yes.|`|j3M8mVwGaa	Your high school 100% effects which college you go to. If your school is ok and you learn the material that is needed to succeed, it won't matter. If you are smart and go to a school were you are given 2nd hand books and a less-experienced teacher your education will suffer compared to if you were taught in a private school with professors who are experts on the subject matter. Your IQ level will end up effecting you the most because that is what it comes down to, but your school has a deep impact as well. Don't worry though, if you are smart and do good on your SAT, focus on a set of extra-curricular activities (not too many) and get A's and B's you will get into a good college.|`|f57HWgj3aa	yes because the better the school the better the education you will receive.
xWGJHMkuaa	Wharton is not just a grad school. It is also home to the number 1 undergrad buisness program in the world. Julie V is completely wrong.  You don't have to go anywhere before there.    Stack up on APs, make sure you get micro/macro and calc if you can. Prepare for your standardized tests (class or books), and continue in french. You must have good foreign language background. You need 3 SAT subject tests with your application.    Before you go for an MBA, you need an undergrad agree, and it doesnt even have to be in buisness. Go stragiht to school after highschool.

AA10023710	The three are roughly comparable re: reputation and ranking. No worries there. It's not like, if you preferred UConn to UMD, their rep or ranking is so very different that you'd be nuts not to pick UMD or anything. I'm not so worried about that. I consider them roughly comparable.     I'd rule out UMD, because you didn't get right into the business school. There's no guarantee that you will when you reapply to the major, and you may end up being behind because some courses for the finance major may not be open, or as accessible, to non-business majors. I'd rule out UMD based on that.     Which one, if any, is your state school? That'd be a huge influence on my decision. UConn and U Del are pretty much comparable re: reputation and etc. If you're from CT, I'd have you give serious consideration to UConn, as it'd likely be cheaper for you than U Del, with no compromise re: reputation and etc.     In addition, which one gave you the best financial aid? That may also be something you want to pay careful attention to - not just the most, but the best, meaning the fewest loans/the most scholarships and grants, and the overall lowest cost to you.     Finally, consider which one you prefer the most, personally. Which one did you like the best when you visited them? Which one do you think fits you best?|`|g5RS83paaa	Maryland has the best reputation, but there all fine schools|`|auZFHKZTaa	UCONN REPRESENT! but seriously that is an amazing school|`|5ec8bbfbe1090c8ed02383e353fea95eaa	Which ever one is your state schools.    check biz school rakings at usnews.com and businessweek.com|`|D1AFV4ZXaa	University of Maryland- College Park|`|vyVDWIehaa	If I had those 3 choices and only those three choices, and I was out of state for all, I'd go to Maryland.
AA10409832	I taught for 37 years in a Pennsylvania high school and when students would come in to me, some would say, "Do you remember me?"  Well after 37 years, I can't remember them all.  It would be so nice if they would wear a sign.  Since you won't be wearing a sign, it would be fine to go up to the teacher, say hello, and then remind them of your name.  "Hi Mr. Smith, I'm John Doe. I was in your 4th grade class in 1999."  That way neither of you gets embarrassed.  I usually remembered faces, but I couldn't remember all the names.  Go to your teacher and try what I've suggested.  I'm sure you'll both have a great time catching up with each other.  Good luck.|`|juzb8O6Naa	I bet they will remember you - especially if you tell them your name instead of putting them on the spot.

You would take these tests during your junior and senior year of high school.  Your guidance counselor will probably talk to you about that when the time comes. You still have a couple of years.  I would say just do really good in your class's, they dont have to be A.P courses, but it will look well.  And about the clubs, I would say two would look nice.  Also, be friendly with your teachers, so when its time to apply for college, they can write you good recommendations.|`|GHoaKxmdaa	first of all its extremely hard to get into a UC school if your not a resident of california. you need to take as many AP classes/honors classes (id say 5 minimum) as you can handle. You need to join clubs and try to assume leadership positions, also join sports and do alot of community service. Most have an SAT score of over 2000, which is pretty hard to get. UCLA is more likely to look at you if your in the top 10% of your class
Dh0JX2Onaa	No it isn't sufficient for almost all.

8uwxNh4Kaa	Stop asking the same questions twice.|`|V6asuaxuaa	You should talk to your cooperating teacher about how she/he behaves during "your" teaching time. Obviously go about it in a professional way and don't accuse or insult, but if he/she is a professional, he/she will understand. Talk about what you want out of the teaching experience and how you think he/she can help you reach those goals so it's more of a partnership than an hierarchy.    As for the misbehaving students - also talk about that with your cooperative teacher and any other teacher you respect. Teachers have many different strategies for dealing with "too cool" students, so it might help you to talk to more than one person to find something that you feel comfortable with. Once you've decided on a plan of action (preferably with your cooperative teacher), implement the plan and stick to it.    Also, think back to your high school experience - those kids were never as cool as they thought they were, it's mostly an act. ;) Good luck!|`|8rJ9lOz1aa	I would ask that teacher if she could possible wait for you to complete the lesson before she comments on your procedures.  I cannot understand why she would do that knowing that they could possibly under mind you like that.  I know it can be frustrating. I'm 25 and teach 10th graders and anything I say is just not worth their time I suppose.  When I did my student teaching I had a paper that had questions like:    1.  What was my strong point/activity/motivational tool?  2.  What can I do to improve this lesson?    I would answer them and then my teacher would answer them.    I hope this helps.

It should be wise men learn from their mistakes (which is modified from):    the only difference between a wise man and a fool is a wise man learns from his mistakes.    now that we have that done.  It is impossible to say that you will remember all of your mistakes and will thus repeat them.  This is the long standing argument about the value of history.    Why do we need to know out history? Because we will learn from our mistakes. (eh)

7deb425958c53615415ce326bcbf08e0aa	eat something before you go to bed - not a huge thing just something so you have some sugar in your blood in the morning - a slice of toast, glass of milk, something like that.    Don't have alcohol the night before (bot saying you do)    Have a bedtime routine, one that relaxes you so switch off any TV, computer, ds etc 1 hour before bed. Have a warm bath. Relax with a book or talk with your family.    Go to bed at the same time every night.    Pay someone in your family to wake you up with a cup of tea / coffee. The earlier you are out of bed the more you pay them say 7am they get 2, 7.15 am 1.50.|`|yBKwlcdtaa	Put the alarm on your mobile phone on, when it goes off in the morning, press snooze.

My advice, simply add more alarms to go off all at the same time, all on the BEEP function to piss you off. If you are a really heavy sleeper, hook up your stereo and set an alarm on your iPod, and when morning comes, the noise will blare in your ears, but you'll be up nonetheless.

If your not good at hair and make up; than cater parties, clean houses, walk dogs or help people get organized.
hc89tLJcaa	Well the teacher simply said she THINKS your daughter may have a learning disability. That doesn't mean she really does. She wants you to know that there is a problem that should be looked into further. If your daughter does have one, she will still be able to move on to higher grade levels as normal.   Don't stress the disability to your daughter. You don't want her to think something is wrong with her. She simply learns differently. And, actually, all children's learning styles vary. It's not a bad thing. And, some of the smartest, most successful people in the world learned differently than their classmates. :)|`|xpiGWrdMaa	get a second opinion|`|I1josn3saa	A learning disability simply means that your child struggles in one area at school. This could be anything from abstract thinking to algebra to using punctuation. It seems to be pretty common, and should not be something to be scared of by any means.    I am currently studying to be a teacher, so I definitely don't know all there is to know in the teaching business. However, as I understand it, a teacher's goal is to see each student progress to the next grade level by the end of the year. So yes, your child should continue progressing through the grades. :)    Also, if it does turn out that your child has a learning disability, you should talk to her teachers about it so that they can design activities that will most benefit her. Teachers need to know how best they can help their students learn or else they cannot do their job properly.    A learning disability does not have to be something that your child will struggle with for life, either. With help and encouragement at home and at school, it is possible that your child can move beyond the issue.     I would consider talking to your child about how they feel about the subject/area that the teacher feels they are struggling in. She may know she's struggling, but not know what to do about it. Continual praise and encouragement for successes goes a long way!
AA11604732	It depends on the major.    At some schools, women who want ot major in engineering or math may get in with slightly lower qualifications because the department is trying to attract them.    But other programs may be tougher.  For example, it is WAY easier to get into University of Pennsylvania as undeclared than it would be to get into U of P's Wharton School where you declare a major.    It is all about supply and demand.|`|pQ3fzgjBaa	Your acceptance is to the school not the major department.  You apply for that after you first year or two.    Your choice of a major on your application will not effect your chances in any way. Because half the kids who put down a certain major on their application end up doing something different later on.|`|W3UYWpxiaa	I've never heard of a college accepting or not accepting someone because of their lack of major.  Don't pick a major just for the sake of picking something.  I did and it ended up taking me an additional year to graduate because I was placed into several upper level Biology classes.  If you still have questions give the colleges you applied to a call and ask them if they have a policy on accepting or rejecting applicants with undeclared majors.  Don't be nervous or worried about calling because colleges have admissions counselors who handle things like this everyday.|`|AA12021966	In my experience, it is into the school and not the major. 70% of people change their major in college, so that would be really short-sighted for the admissions office to only accept you into the program.

4nQGFY7caa	I take both languages and I love them both! Colleges, in my home state at least, prefer to see one language all four years, however, it's not required. Some kids only take three years of one language or divide it into two years of one language and two years of another. That way, if you were looking to do four years, you may want to start the online class. I don't know much about UCLA or what they're looking for, but if it is one of the best colleges in the US, they'd probably like to see the same language, french or spanish or anything else, for all four years, it's just up to you to decide which one!|`|xbISxnmfaa	Well I was about to French, BUT Spanish would be more beneficial.

W3UYWpxiaa	Remind yourself that if  you miss another day that you will be kicked out of the program.  You can't do a lot right now other than talk to your program director.  Explain your condition, but don't use it as an excuse.  You are required to be there the same as everyone else.  When you are laying in bed not wanting to go to class imagine what you life will be like once you get kicked out.|`|bELqEsdOaa	You just have to bite the bullet and motivate yourself to do that. Now that you're in college you need to take the initiative to be responsible and control your own life. Try looking at the reasons for why you don't want to. Make a list if you have to and figure something out that will please your mind.|`|rtsfPQqMaa	Im really surprised the program director called.. most Universities go by the philosophy, if you skip, you miss information, you do poorly, you go on Academic probation, you get kicked out..they keep your money.    But that is beside the point, If you have a medical condition then you should talk to your program director about it- Metal Health disabilities are just as detramental to learning as physical or learning and most schools are required by law to work with a student's disabilities to get them the best education.  Also since your Director did call this is obviously a program which takes interest in it's students success.    Try not to get too anxious because as of now whats done is done, you can only try to work with your school and health care professional to ameliorate the situation.  The excuse that I slept late or was hung over wont fly, but I'm sure you will be able to work something out - I have seen the effects of Bipolar first hand and I know that can take over a person's ability to function.    So good luck and remember its nothing that cant be fixed
Wwv6qnqNaa	No, it probably wont. Try anyway.  He might be boring, but you likely have to deal with it. I have two teachers currently who exactly match that description.  If you have a good reason to, you could talk to parents and try to get him fired, but don't try to do that unless there is a serious problem.

I am studying to become a teacher and while this tactic might freak me out a little, I definitely wouldn't quit.    Please understand that not every teacher is going to be interesting. Honestly, most of them won't be. It sounds like you're in high school...so remember you've still got years of school ahead.

How can you be so lacking in feeling for another human being?   If you think this is so cool why don't you discuss your plans with your parents and see what they think? If you have not done that, then you know it is wrong. You disgust me.|`|AjFA8qIxaa	How old are you?  So you wanna punish your teacher for doing his job?  Wow.  How would you feel if this was your dad or mom?  Would it be cool then?  He's there to teach you and its not hs fault that you don't wanna sit in school.  If anything you should be impressed by a man who chose such a job/  Putting up with kids like you and your classmates every day.  And i'm sure it takes more than a bunch of kids acting stupid for him to quit. And think about the consequences. You will most likely have to deal with them. Think about it.|`|W3UYWpxiaa	No, acting like idiots will not get your teacher to quit.  It will, however, get you and your classmates in a good deal of trouble.  Chances are this teacher has put up with hundreds of kids like you and your friends.|`|YrxJuStaaa	I hate to say it but I can guarantee you'll have plenty of terrible teachers throughout your years as a student. There's no way to get around them except try to do your best in the class, especially once you get towards the end of your education. I have been in college for only 2 quarters now and already I have had some awful professors but there is nothing us students can do except suffer through the class and hope we pass.|`|MM71EOH6aa	You need to grow up.|`|aqto0hJTaa	Save this post into a Word document.

W3UYWpxiaa	The way block scheduling here works is that you will have four classes during the Fall semester.  You will keep those 4 classes until Christmas Break.  After Christmas Break you'll come back to school and get 4 new classes.  This will give you 8 total credits.  As for taking one class year round it is hard to tell.  It depends on the way your high school counts the credit.  If they decide that is two credits then you'll get two.  I recommend that you go and talk to your guidance counselor at school so you'll know for sure how the classes will be counted.

It is so simple but a life building foundation for success. "If you put your mind to it you can do it". or "You can do anything you put your mind too" Is there a better way for a parent to offer up an Intelligent look at challenge, completion, and success? If your habit becomes giving it your all and trying as hard as you can to do it better than everyone else you are building in a competitive way the foundation for a world that is when broken down to it's simplest form, nothing but a competitive rat race.

When you excel you are congratulated and patted on the back and self esteem means something so much more than a whiny mom or dad always saying how this and that her sweet baby is. Playing games learning card games where skill and not the luck of the dice is realized is so much more important for building strong characters. Self esteem is what allows self confidence to grow and then the need for more takes over and most children with any self esteem at all become athletes. It's true, they can excel on the field and they play at recess practicing their sport and they are every day adding into their bank of confidences and as they grow they continue to want to do good, better and eventually realize the importance of being the best! The best. They become addicted to the attention and then in the winning if any luck comes their way someone along their winning way teaches them to appreciate and learn how to love reading and then they focus on reading all their is about their sport and they become the best in the world and understand the hidden secrets or the nuances that can only be taught by masters those who wore the shoes before you. Self esteem is the swagger one gets knowing very few others if any can compete in your arena. Pick any arena you want, interview any winner in the world, Ask them to go back to where they were when they realized that who they are now was where they were headed way back when. I say always readers are leaders and the mental aspect of the sport or game is as important as the physical. I am talking about Tiger Woods, Kevin Van Dam, Kelley Slater to name a few. everyone else is so far under their league and it is because of their parents instilling the foundation for success by allowing them to realize how to gain confidence and build their own self esteem.

Do you have to write about one particular event or just in general?|`|hRSkHG52aa	"Each fresh crisis we encounter is an opportunity in disguise."    I think it means that every problem can be turned into something good, an opportunity, if you look at it the right way.  For example, if your school field trip was canceled because of rain, you could think of it as being another boring day at school, or you could think of it as a rescheduling of the field trip on another day with better weather.  You can take anything I gave you for your essay.

FZKFLTyLaa	That God  has said it is so, thus I believe it IS so.
AUkuRqP9aa	To eighth graders: Consider the type of person you are before making your decision to go a specialized high school. Are you already an achiever in middle school, or are you middle of the class that got lucky on the SHSAT? Stuyvesant (and I can probably assume the same for the majority of specialized high schools) isn't really that worth going to. The competition is cut-throat and the workload is intense. I'm not trying to discourage you from going to a great school, but do you think you have a chance of being top of the class at a specialized high school? If not, you'll be one of those mediocre students in a specialized h.s. who suffer for 4 years and end up going to a local college, or less than prestigious one (by mediocre I mean low 90 average; only about 30-50 students per grade get above 95 in Stuy w/ a real shot at a prominent college; if you can't make 90, as most in Stuy cannot, then you have almost no chance). Only the top 50 or so students really make it to the prominent colleges. So think deeply about how you want your next 4 years to be. It can be really hard with a really high chance of being outperformed (specialized h.s.) or it can be really easy and you'll probably graduate top of your class with a good shot at a good college (nonspecialized h.s.).|`|2VbgWMzmaa	577 two weks of studying|`|JkUmwa8uaa	Aww I did so bad! =[    A few points away from Tech!|`|DsXRdBt4aa	637! stuy for me!

JOXQrsw0aa	Penn(Wharton) is the only undergraduate business major available in the Ivy League. MIT( Sloan) and NYU(Stern) are not Ivy League.   Most Colleges and Universities don't usually consider Freshman or Senior year grades for purposes of admissions decisions. At most,  1st semester of Senior year grades are available but not for early decision. Strength of Senior schedule is an important factor. Senior year AP Exam scores are not available. Usually only grades earned in academic courses taken in 10th and 11th grades are used to calculate the GPA for purposes of admissions decisions. Some Ivy Leagues will look at Senior year grades for regular admissions and many universities will consider Senior grades on appeals of admissions decisions. This is for Berkeley, UCLA and the rest of the UC's and is typical:  http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/ad...  http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/ad...  The grades seem fine. No one will know what grade you made on a French mid term and if your French III  grade is an A,  the B+ won't really matter since  language is a cumulative subject.  I wouldn't drop French Senior year. Stat without calculus as a pre requisite isn't really that useful for econ/finance course purposes.  Honor's Physics and AP Physics are usually almost equivalent courses.You should be taking AP Econ if it's available considering your intended major.  If these are the highest level classes you can take then you are challenging yourself as much as possible at your school.  It is also possible to take classes at nearby JC's or colleges during the summer.  In California,  UC's  treat UC transferable College courses as AP courses for purposes of weighting the GPA. AP classes are also available on line through Distance Learning. U Missouri is fairly inexpensive:  http://cdis.missouri.edu/high-school.asp...  Ivy League and other highly selective colleges don't only look at grades and test scores but also extracurricular activities. They like depth in a few rather than a large slate of activities barely pursued. They look for signs of leadership potential. A good balance is at least one sport and at least one non athletic extracurricular activity. A certain amount of community service is also necessary. I would not be too concerned with only looking at universities with undergrad business majors. The reality that few of the most prestigious universities offer an undergrad business major should send a signal that an undergrad business major is not that important to financial service, management consulting  and other companies that recruit at Ivy Leagues and other prestigious universities. Most are set to recruit and train Economics majors and most MBA programs prefer an undergraduate Econ. major to an undergrad Business major since much of the course is the same. An undergraduate Econ major supplemented with a few financial accounting courses and maybe a federal income tax course is  outstanding preparation for most of the jobs available to an undergrad business major and for any MBA program. If you are in California, Berkeley's Haas Business school offers  an undergrad Business/Econ.  major. About half  the Haas undergrads pursue  simultaneous degrees. Earning a BS in Business and a BA in one of the other colleges. Typically  the College of Letters and Science.  Economics is a popular choice.  Schedule  SAT 2 subject Exams to coincide with the Final or AP Exam in the course. If  your application indicates that you might be   a possible native speaker don't think that an SAT 2 subject exam in a language is going to impress an Ivy League Admissions Officer if the language has not been studied in High School. If you are studying French, the SAT 2 Subject Exam in a language had better be in French. And take the AP Exams seriously and prepare for them. They are given strong weight in admissions, though you only have one that will be available since you have 4 Senior year AP courses.   Good Luck!|`|pQ3fzgjBaa	Harvard and Yale: Probably not.  Cornell and Dartmouth: You have a shot.  NYU: Looking good.    Be absolutely positive to take an earth science class.  At my school it was required, but I went private so I don't know how it usually is. Don't take an AP physics if you already took honors physics. Take something else, doing the same class over looks like you're trying to take the easy way out even though it's AP. Also extracurriculars are vital. You need quite a few to impress  top schools.  I'd suggest taking a different foreign language senior year. It'll look more well rounded.    Ivy Leagues don't pay much attention to honors classes. It's just considered regular once you hit junior year.|`|AbjEpAXdaa	It is hard for me to make an educated decision in whether I think you would be accepted to a top 10 school without knowing your ACT/SAT scores, extracurriculars, volunteer work, etc.  As of now, your grades look like every other applicant that will be applying.  Get working on your essay, your letter of references (from alumni or another respected individual), volunteer, join a few clubs, start a "Green" club at your high school and be President, etc in order for you to stand out from the other applicants with similar grades as yourself.  Apply to a few "reach" school, a few "maybe" schools, and a few "safe" schools.    I would recommend applying for early decision.  I think that is very important.    In regards to you dropping French, I would look at the universities website to look at the foreign language requirements.  The website will break it down in what classes you need to take in high school.  Stats and 2 years of foreign language may be required.  I would also go speak to your guidance counselor.    I hope this helps.|`|WKqjjWW4aa	depends on where you went to school, public or private, your extra curricular, if you have a connection at that school, and what your overall GPA is. but, as i said, if you have a connection then you have a higher percentage of being accepted. believe it or not alot of people have connections. i know i do. in this day and age, grades arent everything.|`|OYIsRZVQaa	if you are involved in your community and/or participate in extracurriculars, you'll be better off. also, a good application essay is highly important! your GPA only says so much about the kind of student you will be in their school, so you have to prove that you have life skills, not just academic skills. and, if you are from a disadvantaged socioeconomic background, they are likely to provide you with scholarships and the like.  keep working hard and make sure you're involved outside of your classes.  good luck!

Don't walk in secluded areas.  Keep you head up, looking around at all times.  If you see someone coming, then go to the other side of street, turn around or duck into a store.  Take martial arts.  Ride in a tank.    Protection in general is a basic life style, I suppose you could say.   1) Don't do stupid things  Walk alone at night in secluded areas  Eat unhealthy food and not exercise  Leave doors unlocked to house/apartment  Have relations with someone who sleeps with others  Play machette boomarang frisbee.     2) Keep your eyes open and avoid situations that might cause danger     3)  Live in a very protected area and have an active neighborhood watch.

And, all of this will be integrated in such a way as to 'grab the attention' of all learners at once.    When reviewing a concept, a teacher may have those who already completely understand the topic do the teaching/demonstration/"put the answer on the board' to engage them and have them give examples and help to those students who have not yet grasped the topic.

SPD9qqwHaa	High school is hard. Nothing in life worth having is easy.  It is difficult as you would like it to be.  It can be hard depending on you temperament & the conditions of the social life.  Just go each day & do what you are suppose to do & you will do great.  Study each night more than asked.  Learn all you can from the internet.  Keep asking questions. Most of all just have fun working hard.|`|J758mw2Naa	Make sure you get enough sleep every night and make sure you eat right and get all your homework done, don't start copying off people because that will get you missing out on alot of stuff.    And make sure your sleeping patterns are perfect or you'll start oversleeping and skipping school (I'm guilty of that, lol, even today).    But yeah if you have a few friends, and have a good time, get enough sleep and stuff, then it'll be fine, it's not scary after about the first few weeks then it's just like middle school or even elementry, lol.    School is school. Don't worry, it's the same as anything else.|`|Vk1Aj44Waa	freshman year su.cks as so far i hear  it sucks for me so far|`|uydFTAJCaa	It is hard in the beginning. It can be hard to fit in and make friends. The work actually isn't all that hard, but thats just my opinion. Good luck and keep being positive!|`|UP8F6PDMaa	PLEASE keep up your G.P.A It will count in the Future. Your cumulative G.P.A is very important. make sure you do all your work, study alot and do well on tests. Colleges will look at it and programs that you want to join in the summer for education will look at it.    But other than that high school is fun. Enjoy it!|`|0S92MwtJaa	dont worry it doesnt get hard    the maths i think got easier  i took math all the wat up to gr 12   took adv functions and also calculus and vectors  both were easy    they only course i ever thought was hard was gr 11 and 12 physics :(  got like somwhere in the 70's  if i had actually tried and was intersted in it maybe i could have done better    people are always complaining how they get so much homework and blah blah blah  but i personally have never ever gotten any more then an hour of homework    just work at it, pay attention in class, do your homework and DONT SLACK OFF!!    dont care what people think about u too much :P  chances are u'll never see them after high school  dont get into drama***|`|10knD5g0aa	i remember my first day of high school in 1991.. small fish in a big pond.. dont worry about it being too hard, you'll learn alot more than you think.. just remember that it doesnt last forever so have fun and dont take nothing too seriously.. good luck|`|M8fQiTsqaa	hun, if you work at it, itl be a breeze.    dnt mess abwt, its not worth it    u wnt get this tym agen    work hard n ul be fine|`|EYPY87woaa	Yea it get's a little hard but it's worth it.

I usually also have a lot of classwork and homework.  But if you balance it, it shouldn't be that hard.|`|61sOhG5waa	It doesnt get to bad. But make sure when you need help because you dont understand something.. go in and talk to a teacher. If you dont things get harder and harder. everything builds off each other.    hope i helped.      oh. and try to stay out of drama. but everyone gets involved in it. it sucks and sooner or later everyone will know. people talk and things sometimes get bad. just know who your real friends are. people talk.|`|deOxABCGaa	The teachers are nicer in your first year.
Ak9YaBzTaa	Go to the school, and get them to print you out your report card, then hand it in with your intention sheet. It will be fine.|`|RYVKYYnAaa	it takes no time at all for schools to print out another report card, just go to the office and have them do it for you.|`|yyhBVaUwaa	No, should definatly get your report card. Just go to the program office at your school or go to the main office and tell them you lost your report card. They will tell you where to go and they will print it our from the computer. it is really not a big deal. If you can't get the report card for some reason, then just type up all of your grades. it is better to have something then nothing at all and ask the assistant principal or the principal or your parents to sign it.|`|EZ18MI04aa	no u shouldnt hand in the sheet w/o the report card. go to your guidance counselor and ask them for a copy of your report card. of course they will have to have it because its on your school file.

vyVDWIehaa	It's because of $.  Every job that makes over $100,000 has lines of people waiting to apply to the graduate schools to get into those fields.    EMTs hold people's lives in their hands too, but you don't see boatloads of people wanting to do that and make $40,000/yr.  On the other hand, dentistry is very competitive.  Not exactly a life or death profession...|`|AA11039109	As a professor of mine commented, "Would you want a guy who couldn't cut it in old Math 095 to be cutting on you?"    If docs aren't nearly perfect as students, they won't be nearly perfect as doctors, and then patients die.    Of course, there's also the economic argument:  if it were easier to get in med school, then there'd be more doctors without, presumably, greater demand.  And that means the price (i.e. their salary) would go down.|`|3wHRPm0saa	dum|`|W6x5hJlmaa	because a person's life is in their hands. u wouldn't want an idiot taking care of YOU would u?? exactly|`|6f5395773cce7a0187fdf217ce48b5e9aa	Supply and demand.  In this case, supply of physicians is artificially constricted by the AMA.  Despite significant growth in undergraduate education programs, there have been very few new medical schools in the past decade or two.  That simply means competition is very high and even tiny things that lower your chance of admittance can shut you down from ever getting a seat in medical school.
5gH9bobxaa	This is something that will vary a lot from school to school.    Your best bet is to talk to your guidance counselor (or a guidance counselor at the school you're going to next year), and ask to see a syllabus from the course.  You might also ask to talk to someone from your school district who is in that class.    You'll probably get a better answer that way than you can get on yahoo answers.

IHhDMHrGaa	Building questions can be tricky and easy as well. You can start building questions by making use of the following words, what, which, when, where, and how. Questions are normally used to ask information regarding people, places, qualities, etc. While there may be some simple questions like "Do you have money?" which can be answered in yes or no.|`|YcGNL9y1aa	Well, considering you have asked a total of 25, you aren't doing that bad, are you!!?|`|zwsdYR3Vaa	ohh thats nice.. idk how to answer a question...|`|SYkzZtW7aa	You just did. :)    Next question?    |`|OD3FqMaKaa	Good news  you did it!|`|v2ut95Wzaa	I don't know either : (|`|tE2ZHOd6aa	well for somebody who finds it hard you just asked two ^^^^|`|CGd5ZN3yaa	I'd tell you but I don't know how to write an answer.|`|ZAJfdo4qaa	haha good job u did it al by yourself :)
oidfmtnYaa	I have come to the conclusion quite sometime ago that half of my school population belongs in cages. So...I choose my friends very very carefully. I only have three to four good friends at a time. When I am in the presence of normal people, I feel free to associate with them. For example, my track team is mostly normal human beings. My classes are, for the most part, civilized individuals. When I am in the presence of complete morons, I play the anti-social role. When I walk through the hallways of my school I don't pay attention to those banging against lockers and I plow my way through the stuck up little freshman girls who clog up the hall with their groups. The people you have described to me seem to be very stupid downright pathetic children. And the only way you would ever have a problem is is you bother to associate with scummy people like them. So do not even bother. Would you try associating with a cage of wild monkeys? What's the difference here? Keep your distance. If you know that the people who are going to be in the "rapping contest" are utter morons who are expected to be assholes 99% of the time, DO NOT EVEN BOTHER. Don't argue with idiots, because they will only resort to the school yard fight tactic. It's just how monkeys act, get used to it. It someone touches you, don't fool around, punch them straight in the nose with the intent of inflicting serious damage. It's what self defense is about. It lets them know that you are not buying into their game.|`|AaXl3vcCaa	i am really sorry kids can be so mean, i moved schools alot and it was girls were mean, but all you can really do is hold your ground and not let them bother you, i would never let them see me cry, those kind of people get off on knowing that it is affecting you, there is really nothing to say to make it better but just know it will get better, i know at the time its all you can think about and seems like the end of the world but its not, i'm 22 now and have not though about those people in years, just be you and do what makes you happy, if you think they will actually hurt you then ya get help, talk to the school counselor|`|gVCZlEPIaa	Get your friends and beat them up! Stick up for your self! Not to scare you(no offense) even if they do beat you up at least you can prove you can stand up to them!|`|5263914089c28cf48456961afa4a910eaa	Have you tried ignoring them???? When people see that they don't get a rise out of you anymore, they may back down just from pure boredom. People who bully you are very insecure (although they may not seem like it) and you are the pawn that makes them feel powerful. Try to take away that power by outsmarting them and making them look like the idiots they know they are.|`|dNPkZVPTaa	Live through your life as if they were not there. Just walk right past them, and if they physically harm you, get the police involved. They could get charged for assault. If you agree to do activities with them (rap battles for instance) you are just setting yourself up for it, so just stay away.    Stay Strong!

Armstrong was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, and soon became a well-known cornet player in clubs and on riverboats along the Mississippi River. He became world famous for his incredible musical talent, especially his improvised solos. Armstrong also sang "scat," a style in which nonsense words are used in a song.

b0e704f73f551e67847eee7284f0b926aa	En primer lugar, pal, tienes que saber, y decirle a tu esposa, que SE VE MAL, MUY MAL, que una mujer CASADA est a solas con un hombre que no sea su esposo, se ve mal que una mujer casada reciba dentro de la casa a un hombre sin la presencia del esposo. Eso es una falta de respeto a ti como su marido, te est deshonrando, porque t no ests en la casa, y la gente de afuera ya se imagina que, aunque ella diga que no haga nada malo, gente de afuera se cree que ella te pega los cuernos con el vecino. Estoy sumamente segura que ese vecino no visita cuando ests presente, no?? Amigo, eso es que algo ms se trae tu esposa con ese vecino. Habla con ella y s sincero,que se ve mal  que reciba dentro de la casa a un hombre sin tu presencia, y que la prxima vez, si ese vecino quiere venir, que venga, pero CUANDO TU ESTES EN LA CASA. Pregntale si cmo ella se sentira si la situacin fuera al revs, que ella salga de la casa, y t recibas en la casa, y hasta en tu recmara, a otra mujer, a una vecina; verdad que a ella no le gustara????Adems, en tiendas de efectos electrnicos, venden estos tipos de cmaras muy peque?as que las puedes poner dondequiera, y as vers qu es lo que hace ella con ese vecino, sobretodo en tu recmara.

La mente te juega muchas travesuras, no te martirices y habla con ella y con l veras que si te enga?a, l no va a querer hacerse cargo de ella.

Depending on your relationship you could loose points if she doesn't get them from you!  In the least, just one long stemmed rose.  Keep in mind that different colored roses all have different meanings. Red roses mean I love you, Yellow is for friendship, orange is for passion.    If you do decide to order roses and get them online you might be interested in a survey I saw recently that CBS News did to find the best company to order from. It kind of takes the risk out of it. The survey was done to see who offered the best value and who actually came the closest to delivering roses that were the same as in the pictures. The company that won out was FromYouFlowers. You can see the video clip of the survey CBS news did at www.orderrosesonline.net|`|h3rN7snkaa	One of my boyfriends sent me a Beautiful boquet of different colored roses, and had a list of what each on meant.

The Mtis were concerned about the encroachment onto their lands by the Canadian Government, in preparation for future settlement.

EQP8IStIaa	Generally, you have to bring examples for and against the issue, and based on these say which side, if any, outweighs the other (and to what extent it does so, eg. overwhelmingly or by a small margin).  If, for example, one were to write an essay about the extent to which Bush's presidency were a success, you would:  a) bring (significant) examples of successes  b) bring (significant) examples of failures  c) based on the examples you have brought, make a decision as to the "extent" of Bush's success. Sum up the pros and cons and state whether the successes outweigh the failures, the failures outweigh the successes, or neither outweighs the other. (In discussing the extent, it might be useful to talk about the present/future implications of the past successes/failures).|`|SYkzZtW7aa	Give reasons why something MIGHT be true, and also why it MIGHT NOT.

mOBiqxtPaa	It depends on what I require advice about.  If it is of a personal nature, then I would talk to my partner and/or a friend.  If it is something that requires more specialist knowledge,  I might approach someone known to me if I know they work (or have worked) in a related field.  I might call an agency/company/doctors etc if I need specific, detailed advice.    As for trust.  I don't trust easily, hence going to my partner or friends in the first instance.  However, voluntary agencies and charitable organisations have good privacy policies, as do most reputable organisations, so we all have to use our own judgement in each circumstance to evaluate the level of trust we assign to each.    I hope that if you are looking for advice, that you find the right person/group and feel able to trust somebody.  If there was anythign specific you were after advice on, maybe research online if you need anonymous advice.|`|wlgRsZpfaa	i usually go 2 my boyfriend or mom/dad... well i trust them, i guess...|`|Hh9UnAfzaa	It depends on the kind of advice you need.

KVkU6WSpaa	"There has never been one single couple in all of history who only 'made love'."    To "make love" is a romanticized term for having sex.  It implies that the act of lovemaking is grounded in the expression of two people's love for one another.  However, that is not always the case.  Sometimes a couple will have sex out of need or lustful desire, and the romantic "making love" part of it never enters the picture.    This is what the quote means, it doesn't have to always "mean something".  In other words, lovemaking (sex) does not always have to have a deep emotional reason, sometimes it is just a physical action, resulting from a physical need.    Hope this helps!
AA11604732	1.  Take the subject tests a month or two before you apply to schools.  760 is a very good score.    2&3.  Having extracurricular activities is very important -- but the fact is that they are easy to pad and hard to verify.  Therefore, the top schools don't rely on them nearly as much as people think.  Quality is better than quantity -- so try to be an officer in clubs.    4.  In my opinion, the top undergraduate B-Schools are Wharton (Penn), Sloan (MIT), Haas (UC-Berkeley), Michigan (Ross), McIntire (Virginia), Stern (NYU).  Other schools with excellent undergraduate B-Schools are Boston College, Villanova, Maryland, Georgetown, Emory, Notre Dame, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Texas.  Many of the universities with the best B-Schools (Stanford, Northwestern, Duke, Harvard, Dartmouth, Chicago, etc) do not offer business as a degree for undergraduates.  However, an Economics degree from Duke, Harvard, Princeton, Chicago, Stanford, etc may be better than a business degree from any school other than those I mention.    5.  You should make sure that you have four years of science and four years of language.  I guess that means dropping history.|`|9qFBftcpaa	A foreign language could be beneficial in the business world so I'd keep taking French. I'd drop either History or Science if I were you.

955f9ee18842afbefc065104a49e91b5aa	Here is what a couple of my friends said  1) one of the best programs in the nation for political science is Wellesley College. It's the best for liberal arts colleges and universities from my knowledge. I think Yale has a comparable program.  2) Michigan State's James Madison is an excellent small liberal arts college within one of the largest universities in the country. I would definetly recommend anyone interested in political science to consider Michigan State's James Madison.   3) georgetown  4) schools on west coast that have good politcal science programs:     Stanford, Berkeley, UCLA, USC, Pomona College, Claremont McKenna College, Harvey Mudd College, Scripps College   5) George Washington University - home of Crossfire on CNN, and adjunct profs who double as commentators on CNN and MSNBC. Incredibe opportunities to intern in DC at numerous government agencies.   6) Spartan - Are you sure about Harvey Mudd? I thought they were primarily a science, engineering, and math college. I checked their website and the only majors listed were math, science, and engineering. They do have a department of humanities and social sciences but no professors of political science. They may have some good courses in areas related to political science but it appears that all of the social science courses are designed to provide a well-rounded education to engineering-science majors.   7) Harvey Mudd is mostly science. Also, American is crap. Besides the fact that it is in DC, it has nothing going for it. George Washington is better, and Georgetown better still. Personally I think that Georgetown is probably the best school in the country for political science because it has an excellent program (it's called "government" instead of "political science" at Georgetown) AND it's in DC. If you want to study poli sci on a more theoretical or international level (in other words, if experience in Washington isn't that important for you) then obviously schools like Princeton or Stanford would be best.

There gets to be a lot of trouble when a particular student is picked for the best part in my experience. What some teachers have done, is they ask everyone which charactars they would like to be. They put the names of the kids who want a particular part into a hat, and draw one. They ussually start with the most popular part and work thier way down. As for the scripts and things, you can probably find something online that you can print out. Costumes you can find either in your linen closet, a second-hand store, or you might even be able to find a church nearby that could lend you the costumes. With a fourth grade class you might even be able to make the neccesary props as a class project.

The Civil War or War between the states. Who gets to use the central governments' money? The north or the South? Who gets to print money? North or South. Would the federal government release any funds to help the South, they did pay into the system and their money was being held by banks and fed reserves in the north.     As things went the North and Federal Government were aligned together against the south. 2 against one. South did not really have a chance because the sovereignty of the country with respect to all other nations was never changed to the southern states.     Not one foreign power changed it's belief that the Federal government and the north were the political sovereign. Why is this important? Well currency must be issued by a sovereign government. If you are not a sovereign you can print money, but no one will accept it, because you do not have the authority to print legal tender. The south, without access to the North's funds(States), and no access to the Federal Governments powers to print legitimate money, nor the access to any funds of cash or gold that were in the Federal Government's banks left them, well, short on dough.    Only money printed in northern states under Federal or Central Government control could print. If you need to buy things it is handy if you can just print a little more to get by, right?    Yep it is a big relationship between Lincoln and the Fed's powers which are central government powers that he controlled, the south could not.

M4PMGw2Zaa	Okay. I got my scores too! Lol.  You find out about your regular school on March 25. This is not the exact date but it is the ideal date. They will send a letter to your school to be handed out before the end of the day. This is considered the Main Round. It is for people who either didn't take the SHSAT/audition or didn't do so hot on the audition/SHSAT. If you got into one of the specialized, it should say on your specialized high school letter.|`|SJHmv2Qwaa	You find out the regular high schools in march. You're school gets them and then distributes it to you. If you got accepted to a specialized high school then they also tell you what normal public high school you got accepted to on the letter because they want you to pick one, if you don't want the specialized seat someone else is willing to take it.
AUkuRqP9aa	To eighth graders: Consider the type of person you are before making your decision to go a specialized high school. Are you already an achiever in middle school, or are you middle of the class that got lucky on the SHSAT? Stuyvesant (and I can probably assume the same for the majority of specialized high schools) isn't really that worth going to. The competition is cut-throat and the workload is intense. I'm not trying to discourage you from going to a great school, but do you think you have a chance of being top of the class at a specialized high school? If not, you'll be one of those mediocre students in a specialized h.s. who suffer for 4 years and end up going to a local college, or less than prestigious one (by mediocre I mean low 90 average; only about 30-50 students per grade get above 95 in Stuy w/ a real shot at a prominent college; if you can't make 90, as most in Stuy cannot, then you have almost no chance). Only the top 50 or so students really make it to the prominent colleges. So think deeply about how you want your next 4 years to be. It can be really hard with a really high chance of being outperformed (specialized h.s.) or it can be really easy and you'll probably graduate top of your class with a good shot at a good college (nonspecialized h.s.).    Extra things you might want to consider: Chances are you will wake up at 6AM and commute for at least an hour, standing. Homework takes forever, especially when piled on top of extra-curriculars. The majority of good students (94+) stay up really late, past 12AM, sometimes to 2 or 3, and some don't sleep. Those who sleep at 10PM and wake up at 7-8AM have it too good and chances are they have a low 80 average.    Sorry for spamming, but I really want to get my point across.|`|VeJLXLXjaa	I got accepted into Brooklyn Tech.

c2f9617e59062c6f3782e4ecaa4a42b5aa	You'll be fine. High School is great, its tons of fun, and don't believe what everyone tells you...its not that different.  You do have more work, you have more responsibilities, but you also have more freedom (which may or may not be good for you).  But the thing is that you aren't suddenly lost in all this.  You ease into it.  I remember freshman year I was pretty quiet, and then as I got more comfortable, I opened up more...made lots of friends, started doing more, found out what rules I could break ;), just getting more freedom, but its not like they tossed me out somewhere, you know?    1) Another school joining you is great. Sure, you won't be surrounded by only friends, but it's a chance to meet new people. And there will still be some friends, so you won't be totally alone :)    2) The gym clothes...you'll get over it lol.     3) I still don't know what I want to be when I grow up and I'm a senior.  I have friends in college who don't know what they want to be...heck I have friends out of college who still aren't sure. Lol don't worry so much about it, I know you've heard it before, but its true..you have plenty of time to figure it out :)    4) Idk about your school, but in mine, not every upperclassman is that mean lol. Its probably better and more comfortable to ask a teacher, but if you need to, most will be nice enough. Just be careful; there are always the couple @ssholes who will point you in the opposite way lol, but very few. Funny, though, how the "third floor pool" is common no matter where you go lol.    5) Again, may be different in your school, but not common in mine. just lock up your stuff in your gym locker, in case.    6) I took all honors too. It was harder than I was used to, yes. But after the first week, it was fine. More than anything, it was just that I had to learn to do my homework. Before, I'd do fine without it, but for a lot of classes, you need to do it in HS.  But you'll manage.  The leap from middle->high is like the same as elementary->middle.  College is where it gets totally different.    Now, I have one huge piece of advice for you.  This will help no matter where you go to school.  Get outside your comfort zone. It's very easy to get overwhelmed, and hide behind people you've always known.  What you'll find is that soon they will find new friends, and even if they stay friends with you, they will have many more, and won't have as much time to hang with just you.  You'll know like 3 people, and everyone else will know each other.  Don't ditch your friends.  I have friends I've known since elementary school, so I'm not saying that. But find new ones.  If you are in a class where you don't know anyone, don't just sit in a corner txting people you do know (luckily, back in the day 4 years ago lol when I was a freshman, most people didn't have phones, so I was forced to talk lol).  Talk to the people around you.  The thing you find is that at first, no one knows anyone.  The person next to you might seem "too cool" for you, or might seem like they're totally fine in this new school, but chances are, they're as nervous and lost as you, just dealing with it better.  Everyone's eager to make friends, and if they turn out not to be, well, scr3w them.  Just talk.  Complain about the class, make a joke, talk about that shirt they're wearing, anything, just make conversation.  There's this guy at my school that always seemed like he had so many friends, and I was super shy at first (he sat next to me in a few classes freshman year), so I never talked, I was like "why would he want to talk to me, thats awkward."  End of sophomore year, he sat next to me again, and I'd stopped being as shy, so I started talking to him.  We ended up talking all the time in class, and texting and stuff throughout, and now he's one of my best friends.  And that's just one example. There are plenty of really good friends I would never have met if I hadn't just started talking in classes.  Also, take afterschool activites.  It is a great way to meet people, it really is.  And don't just do stuff with friends, cuz then you'll just stick with them. If there's something you're really into but they don't like, do it anyway. It will be lonely at first, but you'll make lots more friends like that.  And if you really can't stand it, you can always quit.    Sorry its long, I just wanted you to know...high school's not that scary. Actually, its lots of fun. Sure, its school, but I've had a great time, and met so many awesome friends.  I can't wait to get out, but I'll miss it like crazy too :)  Just relax, get to know people, have fun. Oh, and don't slack off too much ;)    Good luck :D|`|PdQzZe8Waa	Just try not to worry too much about it. It shouldn't be that different from middle school. You can ask upperclassmen where your classes are, not all of them are jerks, but if you don't want to ask them, just ask a teacher. As for changing clothes in gym, usually students are provided with a locker to store their stuff, just keep it locked. For a schedule that changes every day... don't worry too much about it, it's something you'll get used to after a while. Most teachers won't mind if you got lost and came to class late for the first week or so, as long as you weren't intentionally cutting class. Just try to relax and have fun with it.|`|lcxyOS7uaa	1. Just be yourself. Sophomores, Juniors and Seniors aren't all evil ;). I have actually made friends with a ton of upperclassmen this year. (My freshman year.)  2. With honors classes, make sure you know what you are getting into. If you feel like one is too tough for you, make sure you notice A.S.A.P. so you can get out (I thank god I did this with my Honors English Class.)  3. If you need help, don't be afraid to ask. I could not understand how to open my new locker, and left it unlocked for 2 weeks! But finally, after asking for help, I got it.  4 You will have gym lockers, so as long as you lock your clothes, no one will steal them.  5. Make sure to lock your gym locker too. An acquaintance of mine got her phone, North Face, and Camera all taken because she chose not to put a lock on her gym locker.  6. You  are sure your lunch schedule will change everyday? In most schools it does not. Sounds like a rumor or something blown out of proportion.      I personally don't like high school, partly because I was super- close to a few teachers in middle school who I miss, and partly because my middle school was new, had smart boards in every room, 4 computers per room, air conditioning, etc. and in my high school we are lucky to have one per classroom, and we have none of the other stuff.     It is a matter of personal preference. Have fun and if you need any other advice email me @ pianogoosie@hotmail.com      Jackie
AFXE4cmxaa	60% on your actual transcript?! wow.   well, im a high school senior and im in the same boat.  i hate math...suprised that i'm still passing at this point.I dont expect to get the advanced regent diploma. (I know I wont pass the math B regent lol)    BUT inorder to graduate you need all 6 math credits(3 years of math)...if you dont have those, then colleges will not take you...well not  "fit" ones.    Once you have 6 math credits and all the other needed subject credits and regents, you'll graduate with a regents diploma, not advanced    if your a senior and short credits or are looking for backup math credits, sign up for the college now math courses. if you fail your math B class, you can always get the extra credit from college now..  Good Luck ! :)

3urQfMffaa	it's on par w/ Harvard lol.|`|AA11604732	It is a decent regional school -- but certainly wouldn't be confused with an elite university.    The students they accept tend to have good HS grades and decent (but not spectacular) SAT scores.      You should be able to get a good education there.
Ld1vLH8Kaa	A student loan. You don't have to pay it back until you get a job that pays 15 k when you leave uni.
AA11604732	With that kind of a GPA, you won't get into a great college -- but you can get into college.    I didn't do well in HS -- because I was bored and didn't study.  I graduated in the middle of my class, and even had a few Ds -- though I had As in math.  My first year of college was horrible, because I didn't know how to study.  Once I learned, I was on the Dean's list or VP's list (a higher list) for the next three years.  I was able to go on to graduate school & now have an MBA from Duke and a PhD from Berkeley.    It can be done -- but you have to learn to apply yourself.|`|MeNtbYEpaa	it depends what you want to be. im a sophomore and i have a 2.5 i slacked off last year. but im bad in math and science to. for me i dont try in those classes b/c i want to get into to journalism or broadcasting so i stay focused on english. but it really comes down to what you want to do. my brother had a 4.0 in high school went onto law school and failed the bar exam 6 times so it really comes down to are you commited or not?|`|9qFBftcpaa	Anything is possible if you put the effort in. In college you are in class less hours a day than you are in high school. You have a lot more time in college to study even though you have more work to do.|`|oidfmtnYaa	If you want to, you can.    Textbook mathematics and science are human inventions, and should be no more complex that a human is capable of understanding.    What are you interested in? Learn to love mathematics. Discover the beauty and the real life applications that can be done, and you will find it easier to learn it. Don't treat it as a dreaded task. Don't just make excuses like, "I'm just bad at it". Concentrate and understand. Do not take a test unless you know what will be asked of you and you understand how to answer it. If you were to have a test on chapter five, for example, know, by yourself, that you know everything that is mentioned in chapter five. This will bring you A's on your tests.|`|oLI2SJ08aa	You can definitely turn yourself around in college. I didn't push myself in high school as much as I should have. But while I was applying for colleges, I realized I didn't have as many opportunities because my GPA wasn't high enough and I didn't really do anything that was outstanding. I didn't want to experience this same feeling when I am applying to grad school, so I changed my study habits. Instead of ignoring something I didn't understand and hoping it won't be on the exam, I would figure it out. I also have study groups and tutors and ask questions more frequently. I would study every day, instead of when I know I have an exam coming up.    It always helps that college is structured differently than high school. You (usually) aren't in class for 6 or 7 consecutive hours, you don't have to deal with parents nagging you, everything is much closer by. Part of the reason I have been so successful is because I have more freedom and I get to study when I want to.    Another thing that helped me was to have specific goals. Instead of "doing well" on an exam, I would say I'm aiming for an A. Just having higher standards for yourself can do wonders.
0Mj9b0Aoaa	High school is particularly vague when it comes to subjects.  You are required to take all kinds of classes, maths, english, etc.  When you go to college, as long as you choose a course you like, you will be more interested in the classes you are taking.  They are not all enjoyable but it will be much more focused than high school.    However if you are planning on taking something in college that you are not doing well at in high school already, then you will have a tough time with it in college as well.      Also consider if you are "bored" or "tired" of school and if your marks are not so great because of that.  If this is the case then you can expect to be bored and tired of college quickly and likely to slack on your assignments and classes in college as well.|`|PeAqoy1vaa	Well, you need to just pay attention to what you're being taught.

lkNJNnlSaa	Depends what you want to study at Uni.    Take German, a language is always good.|`|sLEoWYr5aa	I would strongly recommend taking up only three subjects at A-Level, I'm in year 12 and over half of the students in my year who took 4 subjects dropped 1 through the course of the year, including myself, the work-load is difficult to deal with unless you happen to be a very capable student, however that's for you to judge, not me.    If you would like to take 4 I would recommend Psychology as it links well with Chemistry and Biology, if you do Biology, Chemistry, Art and German they are 4 vastly contrasting subjects meaning you will need a range of skills and use them all the time which may become tedious. I initially took Geography, Physics, Maths and English but by Christmas I dropped English, simply to reduce the work-load and as the other 3 linked together quite well, English is completely different.    Of course the choice is entirely yours, you may be a very capable student, but I would heavily recommend 3, most universities ask for 3 A-Levels, a fourth is considered optional.    Hope I helped. :)|`|55MkioABaa	pscyhology would be more useful because if you decide you want to do something at uni which needs 3 science subjects (a lot of degrees want this) then you will have 3 :)|`|GO7tZtPxaa	Here is some advise that I wish I had had given to me when I was choosing my A levels... Think about what you want to do in the future!    Art doesnt really go hand in hand with biology and chemistry, why not go for something like english... and unless you are serious about getting a degree and a masters then do not bother with psychology..    IT is always a helpfull one. Dont just pick what you enjoy, look ahead to what you want to do.. With so many people going to uni now you need to specialise in something!!    I hope this helps you out...|`|b82aEt9Haa	OMD your taking the same as me!!! I went for the phycology because you can get further with 3 sciences that you can with two one language and a creative because lots of the science baised corses at Unis etc would prefer the phycology and plus its fun!

8b006ad2547d67b6ee6de41af44054b9aa	Gravitational levitation of course ! (My idea for a best-selling novel).  A quantum-energy powered engine generates gravity enough to compensate that of Earth or other celestial bodies, causing the vessel that carries it to be weightless. It can then carry a crew at astronomic speeds for a low energy cost, putting the door to outer space within reach of mankind.  The concept of gravitational levitation exists at the particle level. And we are decades away from a quantum-energy engine. It would take massive funding from the governments to top researchers around the world and the NASA for many years to come to turn this scenario into reality. This, without being sure it will work until we try.  Since you probably cannot expand on the scientific facts, I suggest you write your paper as a journalist reporting on the maiden flight or as a commentator describing the journey for the astronauts.  The advantage is that a vessel can travel at near light speed while expanding little fuel. It would become feasible to send a crew to the outer reach of the solar system and back in a matter of 6 months.

WpgEqGrvaa	For a line to be parallel to another the slope value needs to be the same.  -2x-y=4 becomes:  y=-2x-4 so the slope value is -2   Therefore the parallel line needs to be y=-2x         Perpendicular lines are a bit trickier as they need to have slope values that multiply to equal -1.  The easiest way to work out the slope value of a perpendicular line is to flip the slope value and change its sign. (eg, m=5/4 the perpendicular line has m=-4/5)    -7x-2y=-65 becomes  -7x+65=2y  (-7/2)x+65/2=y  Therefore m=-7/2 so for the perpendicular line m=2/7    So we get:  (2/7)x=y  2x=7y     To get 2x-7y=25 you also need to know the y intercept of the line, which should be in the question.  (Solving the equation for y gives (2/7)x-25/7=y which gives the y intercept as 25/7, is this stated in the question? If not its impossible to find that particular perpendicular line)      Hope that explains how the answers in the packet are correct.

When thinking of mains and run offs, think of a tree.  The trunk is the main, and the branches are the run offs.    They're talking about power lines.  They want to take cleaner power from the main line and divert it to places that are now powered by dirtier generators.  They want to stop using so many generators by branching power lines off of the big main line.|`|ziuN9hdzaa	run off means to run away from something and mains is what the current stuffs are

Substitute (1) in (2)    x+ (4x+0)= 60  x+4x+0=60(then simplify)    5x=60 --> divide both sides by 5     x= 12 --> That will be the value for ur x-value.     Then, subsitute 12 for x in any of the two equation. Equation (2) is easier to solve for me.     So, x+y= 60    (12)+ y= 60 (transpose 12 on the right side of 60)      y=60-12    y=  48 --> THis will be ur y-value.     To check if this is right you need to substitute 12 for (x) and 48 for (y) to the equations.     Like this:    (1) y= 4x+ 0       48= 4(12)+ 0        48=48   (NOTE: THis is right because both sides have equal value which is 48.)    (2) x+y= 60       12+ 48= 60        60=60    --> The same with (1), they have the same answers.      Does this make sense for you? I hope I helped you!

I suggest you start looking for work and put as much as you can towards your student loans/interest. You still will be in deferment status, just submit what you can on your student loans.|`|iE2sDxDAaa	You will get a Forbearance (Deferment is only for students attending school at least half time) usually for 2 yrs max. It's the same thing, just different requirements. As long as you meet their requirements (being unemployed it one of them) you will be approved. Once you can afford to start making the payments, do it... even if that's only a month or two down the road.|`|YlLdIPRvaa	They will give you certain financial criteria.  If your income (unemployment or otherwise) is below their criteria, then you qualify for deferment.  If not, then you are required to continue paying your loans.  Also, sometimes even when you are in deferment, they can still charge you the interest.
ymrkxCGdaa	Different amounts of snow in different areas. In the area it was closed, there may have been a changeover to freezing rain, which is absolutely awful to drive home in, especially after it's been on the ground for a bit and it becomes slushy with the snow and freezes solid. Some town can deal with storms better because they have more funding, so more plows, salt, sand, etc., to keep the roads in better condition. Private schools have to take into consideration the fact that many students come from a few towns away, and it would be much more difficult to get home. Elementary schools have to consider the fact that little children don't deal with the cold and whipping snow and being out on their own well at all, while mature high-schoolers or college students would be fine. Lastly, one of the decision-makers might be tough guy, to be blunt, who deals with snow and ice fine, while the other might be a bit of a wimp who hates to deal with snow and ice. Yes, people are, inevitably, selfish.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Normally it depends where their teachers live. A school where most of the teachers live locally or on main routes will be able to open in worse weather than a school where most of the teachers have a long drive on minor roads.

iE2sDxDAaa	4.0 (on a 4.0 scale) is getting an A in every class.    A's are worth 4  A-'s are worth 3.67  B+'s are wrorth 3.33  B's are worth 3  B-'s are worth 2.67  C+'s are worth 2.33  C's are worth 2  C-'s are worth 1.67  D+'s are worth 1.33  D's are worth 1  E's are worth 0    Multiple the number of credits a class is worth (usually 3) by the number of points the grade is worth. Add up the product, and divide by the total number of credits you took. That is your GPA|`|BDWwG2tGaa	This is the GPA system for every   A you get four points  B you get three points  C you get two points   D you get one point  F you get zero points  If you are taking a high school course you get .5 GPA point added and if you are taking a collage course you get 1.0 added to your GPA.  You add all the GPA points and divide by the number of classes and you get your GPA.|`|rov9I4YMaa	Well you would have a 4.0 if you had all 100% in all of your classes, 3.9 if you have all A's except for a A-  and 3.8 if you had all As and one B or Two A-'s  and so on ....|`|JqgCG4Jeaa	Some schools use a different "point system" but 4.0 is most common.  It's basically like saying I have always gotten straight A's in all my courses every year.  So like a 3.6 is someone who gets a's and b+'s.  I don't know how to figure out the exact formula so that you could figure out your GPA but I can tell you that the grades you get in Freshman and Sophomore year are the foundation for your final GPA.  If you mess around too much in the beginning you have almost no chance of ever getting your GPA up close to 4.0  It's very difficult to positively influence your GPA by Senior year.|`|2Bis9Sudaa	Grade point average, or GPA, is the means by which total performance in school, usually from middle school through college, is calculated. The evaluation of performance by number has been a part of education for over 200 years, and was first championed by tutor William Farish at Cambridge University in the late 18th century. However, the way in which GPA is calculated, and the specific ins and outs of assessing performance may be unique to a single school, or a country.

MmYXexAyaa	Well, the be a pediatrician you need to be good with kids, so maybe if you volunteer at a school or day care. So, you can be comfortable with kids and have experience with difficult situations with kids. I know in my school we have a "safe school" club thing so it might look good on a resume if you care around kids/teenagers school environment, etc. Also, take courses on sociology and psychology, and also (although i am sure it is required for a pediatrician) take a parenting course.  Hope that helps and gives you ideas to start brain-storming!|`|DN4pCxXqaa	definitely get involved in some medical volunteering. that looks real good on your application.|`|GfadITyTaa	they look at the extracirricular activities and your sat/act scores as well as yur states yearly graded exam|`|IQfhaLSLaa	definitely try to take extra math and science classes if you can.  volunteer at a hospital, and maybe also somewhere with kids.|`|B37YpGreaa	my anut does this kind of stuff and she said they look at your myspoace and like everything you have ever had on there|`|pOfaFP9Gaa	Try to volunteer at a hospital reading to sick kids or maybe even at a day care or somewhere else with kids. I'm 17 and I volunteer at UCP, United Cerebral Palsy, a preschool for kids with and without disabilities. They are so much fun and you learn a lot everyday just by being in the room with them. It would be a good oppurtunity for you to learn about autism, down syndrome, and other disabilities. Check my source to find one close to you. Good luck!|`|oYSDEWrfaa	You are at a good age to start getting ready for college and planning out your future.     1. I would say plan ahead and be prepared. (Which you seem to be doing by asking these kinds of questions).    2. Start building relationships with your faculty and staff at your high school. Meet with your counselor and let them know about your future plans and how important being prepared is to you. Get some advice from your local counselors since they know you and your grades to help you prepare for college.    3. Start taking "AP" or upper division courses if you feel you can handle the amount of work and pressure your junior and senior year. College prep courses are good to have so you can be better prepared for college and I believe they look nice on your transcripts when you are applying to college so this could be very beneficial. Although it's not a requirement to get into good colleges it certainly is viewed upon as being a plus.    4. Start doing volunteer work, join clubs and be active in your high school. You want to start building a resume of activities so that when you start looking into colleges that suite your needs for your goals such as becoming a doctor you have good "over all" transcripts.    5. Schools look at the over all character of the person, from your entrance essay, your SAT scores, transcripts, activities, clubs, volunteer work ect. They want to accept students that they know can commit and handle the work. Even if a student is imperfect in some of these areas it is still possible to get into a good college.    My best advice comes from my experience and it is that no matter what you can't control what happens in your life. Continue to believe in yourself and your dreams. Do research to plan ahead and see what other students have done. As soon as you get into a college of your choice start preparing your "college" transcripts. Be aware of how "W's" and inconsistent transcripts may make getting into med school more difficult for you.     Once you get to college always talk to your professors and build a relationship with them. Most college professors welcome you coming into their office hours. You must complete your GE (general education) courses first so don't panic there is always time for you to figure out what you want to do indefinitely. You want to pick something that makes you happy and you may in fact change your mind about what you want to do and that is ok.     You may want to pick a "mentor" early on if you feel your counselor's aren't helping. PAY ATTENTION to dates and times for applications, and financial aid. Don't wait until the last minute.    If you have any specific questions feel free to email me.    P.S. Extra curricular activities could also include sports, choir, cheer leading, it doesn't have to be exclusively academics. Build your academic portfolio.     Look into being a member of Honor Societies and if you have to fill out any paperwork to be one do so. When I was in high school we had the National Honor Society, California Scholarship Federation, and other awards for academic excellence. Stay on top of your GPA and make sure you take initiative in getting recognition through things like this.     Good Luck, and don't worry you will be fine. Always learn from your mistakes and do your best and you will be happy and successful in life.     ~Ms. K

Note that MLA recently changed the either underlined or italicized rule such that titles (book titles, play titles, and so on) are now italicized only.    You can easily Google the question and find MLA formatting help from university Web sites.  :-)    EDIT:  This is not a matter of opinion.  I hope that people will obtain a CURRENT MLA handbook.  As I have stated, there have been changes in MLA guidelines and people who work with MLA (teaching and learning) need to know these.

I am currently studying A Levels and from what I have read, I don't think that you can change exam boards in the middle of a course.

You could restart your A Level courses with your new school's exam board though.     Hope this is helpful!|`|AjqO1aJgaa	20 minutes?

wtGLxhYPaa	They look at both, but they care just a little bit more on unweighted.
AA11604732	They look at both -- and care about both.      Consider two situations:    1.  Two individuals have the same unweighted GPA, but one has a higher weighted GPA.  The University of California (and other good universities) will be more impressed with the one who has the higher weighted GPA -- because it means he took harder classes.    2.  Two individuals have the same weighted GPA, but one has a higher unweighted GPA.  Universities will generally look more favorably on the one with the higher unweighted grades.  Even though he didn't take as many hard classes -- he did better in those classes.    Bottom line:  The UCs want students who take hard classes AND do well in them.|`|SAgCy83Oaa	Not sure what UCs are, but it is difficult-to-impossible to judge "weights" and people tend to rely on simple GPA.|`|GHoaKxmdaa	Weighted because it makes them look better.

AA11604732	Right now, your GPA is a little low -- but it is close to what it needs to be.  Bring it up, and you will have a shot.    However, there are two more things you need to do.  You need a very high SAT score -- above 2200 out of 2400.    You will also need to write a killer admissions essay.  You need to pay a lot of attention to spelling and grammar -- something you did not do here.  If this is typical of your writing, you will NEVER get into an elite school.

fAtgSc0iaa	Hey Rach     for an access course in Nursing, and as long as you have level two maths or a good score in standard grade maths you should get a place. Working with children previously in some setting helps ie:nursery, primary school, but is not essential.    They also like you to do a little voluntary work before hand, but its not compulsory.    As for Paediatric doctors they like you to have higher sciences, chemistry, biology and physics, and to have a good grade in all ie:A-C    In the UK paediatric nurses have a choice of doing a diploma or advanced diploma which is 3 years, or a degree which is 4 years.    As for paediatric doctors they study at University for 5-6 years.

3dd7d5bbbab03e9efb5db43a61aba4a9aa	It's called being naturally clever. I'm the same. When you're naturally clever, it doesn't mean you know more stuff than anyone else initially. It means your brain is capable of understanding and picking things up quicker. Thereforeon  the fourth day, you can figure out what's missing and apply your sense of understanding to the missing pieces. Hence, mentally, maybe subconciously, figuring out what you don't know.    It's all fine and dandy until you get into college (well, in the UK). I was exactly the same as you, didn't revise for a single exam and I came top of my school, amongst the best grades. But, I was used to treating work in this way, I got to college and lasted till January. They asked me to leave.    I was fed up of people saying to me, 'Okay, you did well but imagine how good you could have done if you actually worked. You'd be laughing..' So i'm not going to say that to you.    Naturally clever AND hard working? Now there's someone you don't come across often. Why work if it comes to you naturally? There's no need. But you can't sail through life with that attitude, and you will learn that soon enough.     Good luck, I wish you all the best.|`|AlUitd04aa	cuz your asian. duh,       EXACT same situation girrll.

mOBiqxtPaa	My only comment would be that your title spells out a conclusion, as such; if you are to present evidence and show more than one side to a story, maybe your title should be in the form of a question.  For example....    "Do Asian-Americans experience the loss of cultural identity due to an inabiity to cope with both cultural ideologies in both home and host country?"    or...    "Asian-Americans and their experiences of cultural identity"    The go on to present your ideas and use evidence from your source book to back up any arguments you present.  Good luck with your thesis.

PVfV1a8Kaa	First of all:    cultivate |?k?lt??vt|  verb [ trans. ]  1 prepare and use (land) for crops or gardening.  ? break up (soil) in preparation for sowing or planting.  ? raise or grow (plants), esp. on a large scale for commercial purposes.  ? Biology grow or maintain (living cells or tissue) in culture.  2 try to acquire or develop (a quality, sentiment, or skill) : he cultivated an air of indifference.  ? try to win the friendship or favor of (someone) : it helps if you go out of your way to cultivate the local people.  ? [usu. as adj. ] ( cultivated) apply oneself to improving or developing (one's mind or manners) : he was a remarkably cultivated and educated man.    If you want to improve your vocabulary without carrying a thesaurus, the single best thing you can do is read. Any work of literature will help you. Obviously, the more advanced books will improve your vocabulary more than the other ones. If you find a word you don't know while reading, look it up in a dictionary and try to look at the context in the book to discern the definition.    Congratulations on wanting to improve your vocabulary, and I wish you the best of luck!|`|P6NptCz8aa	Hmm... with the cultivate example I see what you mean.    I'm an english major, here's what I did.    I found a group of people to hang out with who I didn't really care about, then I just experimented with using big words around them, and if I said one wrong - they corrected me, and I didn't really care if they lost respect for me. Just make friends to use as "vocabulary practice"|`|S71MT9USaa	I have stumbled across an article that directly addresses your Question. It is titled "A Native-Like Ability to Circumlocute" (speak like a native) and is taken from "The Modern Language Journal" an online publication. It is written in pretty formal language though, which I feel is perhaps the biggest obstacle to "speaking like a native".    BTW: I see nothing wrong with your use of "cultivate", in fact I find it preferable to "ameliorate".    Edit: I left out that I think your usage of Y!A has got to be a good way to improve your linguistic skills.   There is also an on-going discussion about correct grammar on the S.B. which you might find interesting.

That way you get more correct usage of words and a little less slang.    For me I like Science Fiction so reading books by authors such as Heinlein, Asimov, Clarke amongst others.    Those authors use scientific terminology and rephrase much of it for everyday usage.  If you aim at authors from the same era then the quality of writing, and vocabulary will help you.  After all a Dictionary can only define a word in so many ways.  It is better to see a word in use.    To start you off - I'd recommend the Asimov books as he wrote almost every conceivable type of story with a futuristic twist.|`|KTNqah9eaa	Yes, rush to a dictionary straight away because cultivate does not mean improve. But for the long term, I would choose a word out of a Thesaurus write it down on one side of a card and then chose alternatives that you would like to use and write them on the other side of the card. Memorise them and then write them down. Just keep adding to your list as your fancy takes you and you'll soon build up an impressive vocabulary.|`|crnjv96Faa	knowing foreign languges helps you. what languges the wrds came from. most of all is context clues. read sentences carefully see where one word does not match up. elimnate it and keep moving on

AA11694898	Wow. Good question. It depends on the situation.    I would say "yes" when it comes to my parents. My parents used to always make it clear that after high school, I'd go to college. There's no ifs, ands, or buts. College was next. I wasn't even "allowed" a year off. "You're going to college!" This makes it my parents' responsibility. They can't make me go and force me to pay for everything. It doesn't make sense.    Some parents don't have the money or don't make an emphasis. It falls down on to the student to have their own "willpower" to go. It'd be great if the parents could help out - i.e. "You can live with us and pay nothing. We'll help support you." However, the responsibility of the parents' are little as it was their child who made the ultimate choice to go to college.|`|e7f3804dbc3162c5185987fcc0fd2261aa	http://www.kelepiryazlik.com answer is here|`|1f01b2c21f312e99978c6cd1c4ef2ec6aa	well i think they could go half half ? but college and those things are like soo expensive and tehres noway a teenager would be able to pay all the fees and all that. so then they'd need help and probly pay them back after theyve done the course i dont know whats goingto happen but i overheard my mum talking to my neighbour about that and how she wasnt helped and had to pay it all by herself and how she wasnt going to pay for me so.. *sigh* dunno its different for different familys .. others who are supportive and theres otehrs who just dont care  i would help my kids half half and then if its that expensive i'd help but not if i knew they could manage it    whats your opinion ?|`|AA11651128	It was a known fact in my home that unless I got a scholarship, I couldn't afford to go to college.  I think it made me study harder, and it made me value my college experience more.    I think a lot of kids today feel that their parents and the world in general 'owes' them something.  I personally think that if you work for something, it means more to you in the long run.

Ask at campus housing if they have dorms for upperclassmen.  Usually freshmen are in different dorms than older students, but even if that is not the case I think a dorm will help your social life.  I got out of a dorm as soon as I could, but in hindsight I regret that because I would have met a lot more people if I had stayed in campus housing.  Good luck.|`|a40q8hOUaa	I think it would be a good way to meet people. I live in a dorm with someone who is 2 years younger than I am (I'm 20 almost 21) , so age shouldn't be an issue.

When you're in the dorm, you could possible start some random conversation with someone in the elevator or laundry room. Or maybe if you get a meal plan, you could meet people in the dinning commons. But you have to be willing to talk to some people. You could also try to join a club, if you have the time. I belong to a community service organization called Circle K. Maybe your school has one too. By going to a club a couple times, people will start to recognize you and start talking to you.

IWafFSP9aa	1.  The USA were against the submarine warfare at the time.  there was also a lot of anti-german propaganda at the time so that swayed the public's opinion.  The sinking of the lusitania also had something do to with it.      2.  The League wanted to stop aggression,  gradually gain disarmament from countries, it wanted to encourage cooperation and wanted to improve living and working conditions.  most of all it wanted to "keep the peace" and stop another war breaking out.    my answer is short but sweet and by far the best|`|8FeCrK1Zaa	The United States ended up entering WWI because of their anger with Germany over its unrestricted submarine warfare, and how their U-Boats sank cargo ships and ocean liners, notably the Lusitania and the Sussex.    The League of Nations was envisioned by President Woodrow Wilson, and it would help settle disputes among countries, keep peace and transform relations between countries.|`|bf5cDEyZaa	1.  The United States originally pursued a policy of isolationism, avoiding conflict while trying to broker a peace. This resulted in increased tensions with Berlin and London. When a German U-boat sank the British liner Lusitania in 1915, with 128 Americans aboard, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson vowed, "America was too proud to fight" and demanded an end to attacks on passenger ships. Germany complied. Wilson unsuccessfully tried to mediate a settlement. He repeatedly warned the U.S. would not tolerate unrestricted submarine warfare, in violation of international law and U.S. ideas of human rights. Wilson was under pressure from former president Theodore Roosevelt, who denounced German acts as "piracy". Wilson's desire to have a seat at negotiations at war's end to advance the League of Nations also played a significant role. Wilson's Secretary of State, William Jennings Bryan, resigned in protest of the President's decidedly warmongering diplomacy. Other factors contributing to the U.S. entry into the war include the suspected German sabotage of both Black Tom in Jersey City, New Jersey, and the Kingsland Explosion in what is now Lyndhurst, New Jersey.    2.  The League of Nations was an above the state organization founded as a result of the Treaty of Versailles in 19191920. At its greatest extent from 28 September 1934 to the 23 February 1935, it had 58 members. The League's goals included upholding the new found Rights of Man, disarmament, preventing war through collective security, settling disputes between countries through negotiation, diplomacy and improving global quality of life.|`|OSF2WMQeaa	1. i forgot something about a fight with some country idk haha  2. to keep peace in the countries and stop worldwide issues and fights    haha hope i helped :)

Angered at the tax increases, colonists organized a boycott of British goods. In Boston on March 5, 1770, a large mob gathered around a group of British soldiers. The mob grew more and more threatening, throwing snowballs, rocks and debris at the soldiers. One soldier was clubbed and fell. All but one of the soldiers fired into the crowd. Eleven people were hit; Three civilians were killed at the scene of the shooting, and two died after the incident. The event quickly came to be called the Boston Massacre. Although the soldiers were tried and acquitted (defended by John Adams), the widespread descriptions soon became propaganda to turn colonial sentiment against the British. This in turn began a downward spiral in the relationship between Britain and the Province of Massachusetts.  The peace treaty with Britain, known as the Treaty of Paris, gave the U.S. all land east of the Mississippi River and south of the Great Lakes, though not including Florida (On September 3, 1783, Britain entered into a separate agreement with Spain under which Britain ceded Florida back to Spain.). The Native American nations actually living in this region were not a party to this treaty and did not recognize it until they were defeated militarily by the United States. Issues regarding boundaries and debts were not resolved until the Jay Treaty of 1795.In 1764, Parliament enacted the Sugar Act and the Currency Act, further vexing the colonists. Protests led to a powerful new weapon, the systemic boycott of British goods. The British pushed the colonists even further that same year by also enacting the Quartering Act, which stated that British soldiers were to be cared for by residents in certain areas. 1765 the Stamp Act was the first direct tax ever levied by Parliament on the colonies. All newspapers, almanacs, pamphlets, and official documentseven decks of playing cardswere required to have the stamps. All 13 colonies protested vehemently, as popular leaders such as Patrick Henry in Virginia and James Otis in Massachusetts, rallied the people in opposition. A secret group, the "Sons of Liberty" formed in many towns and threatened violence if anyone sold the stamps, and no one did. In Boston, the Sons of Liberty burned the records of the vice-admiralty court and looted the elegant home of the chief justice, Thomas Hutchinson. Several legislatures called for united action, and nine colonies sent delegates to the Stamp Act Congress in New York City in October 1765. Moderates led by John Dickinson drew up a "Declaration of Rights and Grievances" stating that taxes passed without representation violated their Rights of Englishmen. Lending weight to the argument was an economic boycott of British merchandise, as imports into the colonies fell from 2,250,000 in 1764 to 1,944,000 in 1765. In London, the Rockingham government came to power and Parliament debated whether to repeal the stamp tax or send an army to enforce it. Benjamin Franklin made the case for the boycotters, explaining the colonies had spent heavily in manpower, money, and blood in defense of the empire in a series of wars against the French and Indians, and that further taxes to pay for those wars were unjust and might bring about a rebellion. Parliament agreed and repealed the tax, but in a "Declaratory Act" of March 1766 insisted that parliament retained full power to make laws for the colonies "in all cases whatsoever".The British government responded by passing several Acts which came to be known as the Intolerable Acts, which further darkened colonial opinion towards the British. They consisted of four laws enacted by the British parliament. The first was the Massachusetts Government Act, which altered the Massachusetts charter and restricted town meetings. The second Act, the Administration of Justice Act, ordered that all British soldiers to be tried were to be arraigned in Britain, not in the colonies. The third Act was the Boston Port Act, which closed the port of Boston until the British had been compensated for the tea lost in the Boston Tea Party (the British never received such a payment). The fourth Act was the Quartering Act of 1774, which allowed royal governors to house British troops in the homes of citizens without requiring permission of the owner. The First Continental Congress endorsed the Suffolk Resolves, which declared the Intolerable Acts to be unconstitutional, called for the people to form militias, and called for Massachusetts to form a Patriot government.

I'm not familiar with those schools, but you should contact both schools just to make sure.      I have found that any school that is considered private, especially those business schools like DeVry or ITT Tech don't transfer out.

c5UAa65qaa	What do you want to do?  If you're interested in English (particularly writing), I'd advise you to consider Washington College.  For politics, AU definitely has an edge over the others.  I don't know Queens' specialty off the top of my head - nursing, I'd guess from their website - but you get the idea.    Also, where do you want to be?  Living in DC (albeit a suburb-like neighborhood) for four years is going to be very different from the Eastern Shore, which will be different from Charlotte.    In terms of financial aid, you're best off talking to the schools directly and seeing what they can offer you as an individual.  My guess is that you're going to find American pricier than the others, but again, for certain careers, it might be worth it.  It all comes down to your wants and goals, and without more detail, it's hard to offer specific advice.|`|rtsfPQqMaa	This question cannot be answered by anyone but you, and you didn't give enough info for anyone to really evaluate.    I am guessing you are asking in regards to Undergraduate study, and in that case it all depends on what kind of degree you want to pursue, and what kind of environment you want to live in.  I don't know anything about Queens University, but I just applied to American U for Grad school and I think it has excellent professors and a highly respected curriculum. But you can't just look at which school is better ranked, because in many cases while the overall school is ranked higher, your specialization is not.    In one school, the business program might have a better percentage of students who graduate with Jobs (thats the whole point right) where as in another the Journalism school has great connections and internship programs which will give you an advantage when leaving school.  Also if you want to study a specialized major- such as European History one school might have more Professors working in that field than the other- even if it not listed as a "better school"    I think you will be fine with any of those choices, but you need to think long term and what kind of interests YOU have, not what looks better on paper.

You would use it in talking about today or something.  Unless you are taking about something you have not done.    Then it gets a little confusing.  Because in the past, you have not been bungee jumping.    I suppose you just really have to think about what you are going to say and decide if it makes sense with past-tense or present-tense.

a40q8hOUaa	The formula for the area of a rectangle is length (l) times width (w). The problem says that the length is 8 more than the width. That means that l = w + 8. So set up an equation that says, (w+8) x (w) = 380. Multiply the w through, bring the 380 to the other side of the equation so that you have an equation that = 0. Use the quadratic formula to find the value of w. Then substitute w into the length equation to get the length of the rectangle.

xJoMSkI5aa	Montresors confession/brag-fest begins to look suspiciously meta-fictional. Meta-fiction means that a story or a moment in the story comments on the writing process in some way. It tells us how the author feels about writing.    Because Montresor is the guy telling the story, he becomes symbolic of the writer and is likely to have some of the writers habits  and here we mean both the literal writer, in this case Poe, and, in the larger sense, any person who is driven to express themselves by writing. This isnt necessarily true of all first person narratives, but in Montresors case, its abundantly clear  even if we dont know Poes philosophy.    Look at the names. Montresor, and Fortunato. Do those sound like real people to you? Of course not, because Montresor is making it all up and he wants us to know it.     From Shmoop/Narrative Technique

Ftkr9jqYaa	Here is a beautiful song with metaphors galore in its lyrics:    "Stairway to Heaven" by Jimmy Page & Robert Plant (Led Zeppelin):    There's a lady who's sure  All that glitters is gold  And she's buying a stairway to heaven.  When she gets there she knows  If the stores are all closed  With a word she can get what she came for.  Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven.    There's a sign on the wall  But she wants to be sure  'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings.  In a tree by the brook  There's a songbird who sings,  Sometimes all of our thoughts are misleading.  Ooh, it makes me wonder,  Ooh, it makes me wonder.    There's a feeling I get  When I look to the west,  And my spirit is crying for leaving.  In my thoughts I have seen  Rings of smoke through the trees,  And the voices of those who stand looking.  Ooh, it makes me wonder,  Ooh, it really makes me wonder.    And it's whispered that soon  If we all call the tune  Then the piper will lead us to reason.  And a new day will dawn  For those who stand long  And the forests will echo with laughter.    If there's a bustle in your hedgerow  Don't be alarmed now,  It's just a spring clean for the may queen.  Yes, there are two paths you can go by  But in the long run  There's still time to change the road you're on.  And it makes me wonder.    Your head is humming and it won't go  In case you don't know,  The piper's calling you to join him,  Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow,  And did you know  Your stairway lies on the whispering wind.    And as we wind on down the road  Our shadow's taller than our soul.  There walks a lady we all know  Who shines white light and wants to show  How ev'rything still turns to gold.  And if you listen very hard  The tune will come to you at last.  When all are one and one is all  To be a rock and not to roll.    And she's buying a stairway to heaven.

SIhxrxD3aa	They do look at both.  But, they will look mostly at the unweighted GPA to see how you compare to other applicants because not all schools weigh grades and every school weighs them differently.  Your weighted GPA is mostly used to determine your class rank.|`|AXiKJDV9aa	They look at both.  Weighted gives an indication of academic rigor.  Unweighted tells how good you are doing compared to students taking a course load of similar rigor.  Since the best schools expect you to take a rigorous course load anyway your weighted one counts for little as such schools - it is your unweighted that counts there.  If your weighted GPA does not show you took a challenging course load then you wont even be looked at.    Thanks  Bill

mSVXV2gbaa	Definition of Social Contract Theory:    One theory about how political authority can arise is social contract theory. According to social contract theory, consent is the basis of government. It is because people have agreed to be ruled that governments are entitled to rule.    Social contract theorists envisage a transation from a state of nature to a state of government. Individuals come together and form contracts which serve their interests, and these contracts establish rule. Social contract theory has recently been restored to the fore of political philosophy by John Rawls, whose version of the state of nature is the original position.  from http://www.politicalphilosophy.info/soci...    In re Locke:  John Locke (b. 1632, d. 1704) was a British philosopher, Oxford academic and medical researcher, whose association with Anthony Ashley Cooper (later the First Earl of Shaftesbury) led him to become successively a government official charged with collecting information about trade and colonies, economic writer, opposition political activist, and finally a revolutionary whose cause ultimately triumphed in the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Much of Locke's work is characterized by opposition to authoritarianism. This opposition is both on the level of the individual person and on the level of institutions such as government and church.   from http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/locke/    In re Rousseau (I assume you mean him: I am not familiar with a Jacobs)  Jean-Jacques Rousseau is one of the most influential thinkers during the Enlightenment in eighteenth century Europe. His first major philosophical work, A Discourse on the Sciences and Arts, was the winning response to an essay contest conducted by the Academy of Dijon in 1750. In this work, Rousseau argues that the progression of the sciences and arts has caused the corruption of virtue and morality.   from http://www.iep.utm.edu/r/rousseau.htm    In re Hobbes:  Hobbes believed that all phenomena in the universe, including political institutions, could be understood using principles of geometry. In 1651, Hobbes printed his most famous book, Leviathan , in which he argued that all humans are driven by two and only two impulses: fear of death and desire for power. If left unchecked, human beings would act on these impulses and live violent, brutish, inhumane, and solitary lives. In order to keep these impulses in check, human beings, according to Hobbes, drew up a social contract among themselves; the people ceded all authority and sovereignty to a single person in exchange for security from each other and from foreign invaders. The single ruler would control the violent and selfish impulses of individual members in a society through brute force; individuals would lose their liberty, but they would gain security and community. Hobbes did not care what form this single rule might take, whether a monarch or a dicatator, only that absolute power was required to keep society together.   from http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/GLOSSARY/SOCCON....    I have given three different sites so that you can explore; each has a slightly different slant, but all of them cover all three philosophers.    Good luck!

fbaa1f9357237beefd564f7ffe259fa8aa	since you're only a sophomore, you have plenty of time to spend "improving your profile" if you feel the need. i would recommend that you take the most rigorous course load that you can handle, keep your grades up, and choose a few meaningful extra-curriculars that you're willing to really devote some time to.    you haven't provided much information here, but i will say that unc-chapel hill is a competitive school to get into. actually, 82% of students MUST be from the state of north carolina, as mandated by the state constitution, and the percentage hovers usually around that (not as high as 96). this certainly makes it more competitive for out-of-state students, and you will be at a disadvantage when applying. however, it's definitely not impossible. good luck!|`|4yiH5TiQaa	Get a good score on your ACT like a 29 and you might get in if everything else is good!|`|0SLCXs2daa	UNC Chapel Hill is a very popular school, so there is a lot of competition to get in.  It doesn't matter about in state/out of state really, you just need to have good grades, a high SAT score and some extra-curricular activities to be able to compete with all the other applicants.  You can never be certain of whether or not you will be accepted into a university, so don't worry about "getting your hopes up".  Just apply and see what they say.  It always makes sense to apply to more than one college though-you always want to have a backup.
Ftkr9jqYaa	Hester Prynne remains in Boston after her release from the town prison, despite public humiliation and shame, for several reasons.  First, it is very difficult for a single woman to survive on the road in 17th century New England, and travel is difficult.  Secondly, everyone whom she knows lives in Boston, and she is inextricably enmeshed in the community.  Thirdly, the father of her out-of-wedlock infant daughter Pearl, whose identity remains unknown to all but herself and he, can provide her and the child with some support.  Fourthly, and most importantly, her husband, now going by the name Roger Chillingworth and practicing medicine, has recently arrived in Boston, and he will not only comfort and protect her, but plans to wreak revenge on Hester's persecutors, including the ailing Arthur Dimmesdale, a minister who is Pearl's real father, and a patient of Chillingworth.
MWfjfAFYaa	The NW ordinance created laws on how to control and govern the territories in the US. It consisted on education laws, governing laws, taxing laws and more.    The Articles of Confederation were a bad attempt at setting up a centralized government. The Constitution was a successful way of setting up that same centralized government and is still used today. The Articles limited the power of the central government and made it weak in fear of tyranny. The constitution made the central government more powerful and able to govern. It gave the government more freedom to pass laws and elect representative and presidents etc.    Hope this helps|`|AA12361379	Try googlling the questions.

If she is in Grade school, I went to both St. Mel's and St. John's the Evangelist.  The principal at St. Mel's has been there since my brother started there in the late 80's.  St. John's is a really nice school and the teachers are great.  I have gone to church at Our Lady of Assumption and it is a very traditional church.      If you are looking at High Schools I would recommend St. Francis.  I didn't go there but I did a shadow day there and the student were great and the teachers were awesome.  I know Lorretto is shutting down (I went to school there) and I know a few people who went to Christian Brothers and loved it.      As far as who is shutting down, but I believe most of the schools on there have websites you can get information from.

ql61myroaa	You probably will.  It is one of the least selective schools in Boston.|`|AA10023710	Your extra curriculars are fine. Keep going with those. Your grades are really low for Emmanuel, so your SAT/ACT is going to be pretty important to your application. You really want to get your ACT/SAT up into Emmanuel's average range, and ideally, be on the higher side of their averages:    SAT Reading:490 - 590  SAT Math: 480 - 580    ACT: 20 - 24    I want you to actually prep for those exams. Don't take them cold. At a minimum, I want you to do a sample exam before you take it for real, so you get familiar with the format and pacing of the exam. That *will* increase your score. In addition, if you can, get a test prep book from the library or a bookstore and start working through it. That may help increase your score.     Another factor that could make a big difference is if you want to swim or play field hockey for Emmanuel. Do you? If so, get in touch with the coach asap. The coach can sometimes help a bit with the admissions process.     I also want you to pick some fit and some backup schools that you really like, in case you don't get in. I consider Emmanuel to be a reach school for you, so picking other schools that fit you, as well as some backups, is quite important.
AA10023710	You should give NYU a shot. In the city, also look at Juilliard, if you don't mind a conservatory instead of a university. You can look at Fordham as well. They have a good program. If you like NYU, you may also like BU, and they have a good theater program.     For NYU, you want good grades in HS - I'd say maybe around a 3.3 at least, higher ideally. Also strong SATs.     You aren't required to have four years of arts.

Ftkr9jqYaa	The process to which you are referring is most commonly called sentence flow or FLUIDITY, because each sentence follows logically from the preceding one by virtue of the direct relationship between the topics of each of the sentences.    The nearest figure of speech to what you are describing is APPOSITION.  Apposition is a grammatical construction in which two elements, normally noun phrases, are placed side by side, with the second element serving to define or modify the preceding element. When this device is used, the two elements are said to be in apposition.    A related concept pertaining to groups of people who write sentences which are serially linked is CHAIN WRITING.

In college you take the normal pre-med classes, and then you go to a med school. I think a normal salary is an average of 100k. Psychiatrist do almost the same thing as psychologist do, but instead of finding an emotional solution to thier problem, you find the scientific solution, where you figure out what if going on in thier brain, and you can give them medicine.

This is as psychobio graduate coursework is almost entirely biologically driven and you have almost no shot of being admitted unless you have an extensive biological science background.  This may seem ironic, as many think a grad psycho program is best prepared by a psychology undergrad degree but it doesn't always work out that way.    As for high school, just do the basics.  Take a lot of math, never can go wrong there.

l1a7kY4Vaa	We are left to presume that what you mean to ask is: "How do you make a good sentence with the word "exhibition?"    Every complete sentence has a noun and a verb. So in order to make a sentence, we need to include at least one noun and one verb. So let's begin by choosing a noun.    How about "exhibition?"    Okay, and next a verb.    How about the verb "to be?"    Okay, so let's see if we can put the noun and the verb together to make a complete sentence. We may need to conjugate the verb in order to match the subject to the verb properly. In this case we are going to be speaking of the past, so let's see how to conjugate "to be" so that we might say something about the exhibition.    If we liked the exhibition and we thought it was wonderful, then we will need to conjugate "to be" into its past perfect tense, "was."    THE EXHIBITION WAS WONDERFUL.    How's that?    We made a sentence with the word exhibition. In this case, we were referring to an event where things are exhibited, an exhibition is an event where things are exhibited for the viewing pleasure of others.|`|AxkVvgBFaa	am i in 5th grade again doing the take home spelling practice where you have to first define the word and then use it in a totally useless, completely non-realistic way?    if that's the case, then i would say, "I was having cyber sex with this guy for weeks and then he told me that he was into really weird stuff like BDSM and public, exhibition style sex which freaked me out but I gave it a shot and I actually really liked it."    you may want to add some flare to this like you getting caught by the cops since it was in public or that the cop decided to join in or first cuff you and then join in.    make it original.    -Mayor McCheese|`|hRSkHG52aa	Exhibition means large-scale public showing, as of art objects or industrial or agricultural products.

wgFZGMEtaa	It does look bad, sorry.  Good colleges (heard this from countless counselors) separate apps into three piles - APclass + test, AL cLass no test, no AP.  The last is almost always thrown out, and the second really hinders you.    It shows that the AP may be really easy at your school, so you are just looking for a GPA boost rather than college credit.|`|aEGgO5Knaa	At my school, if you don't sit for the AP exam you only receive regents level weighting, not the usual AP weighting of 1.15. If you're worried about the cost of the AP test, ask your guidance counselor for a fee waiver and she'll determine if you're eligible. Good luck!|`|oLI2SJ08aa	You can't get college credit if you don't take the exam, so you'll probably end up taking that class again in college. What's the point of taking an AP class if you already know now you won't be taking the exam? If you don't want to take the exam, at least take a class you're interested in instead.

xbISxnmfaa	As a pharmacist, you'll use your extensive knowledge of how each of hundreds of medications works to fill prescriptions and advise patients on how various drugs ought to be taken.  Pharmacist Job Description    As a pharmacist, your typical duties will likely include the following:            * Dispensing drugs prescribed by physicians and other health practitioners          * Educating and informing consumers and patients about the use and possible effects of medication          * Advising physicians and other health practitioners on the selection, dosages, interactions and effects of medications          * Maintaining confidential records of patients' medications to ensure their safety and monitor their progress          * Providing specialized disease management services for patients with conditions such as diabetes or asthma          * Preparing drug therapies in areas such as oncology and intravenous nutrition support    In addition you might own or manage a pharmacy, adding hiring and supervising personnel to your responsibilities.    Find PharmD Programs  Pharmacist Salary    According to Salary.com, the middle 50 percent of pharmacists earn between $95,384 and $105,719 per year. The top 10 percent earn an annual salary of at least $113,018.  Pharmacist Work Environment    As a pharmacist, you might work in any of the following settings:            * Hospitals          * Drug stores, grocery stores, or department stores          * Pharmaceutical manufacturers          * Health insurance companies          * Government agencies          * Public health care agencies          * Colleges and universities (in teaching and research positions, or in on-campus pharmacies)    Most full-time pharmacists work 40 hours per week. You should plan on being available to work some evenings and weekends, as many pharmacies are open during these hours.  Pharmacist Education & Training    To become a pharmacist, you need to graduate with a Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) degree from an accredited college of pharmacy, serve an internship under a licensed pharmacist and pass a State examination (NAPLEX)all of which enables you to obtain a license to practice.    Find PharmD Programs  Applying to Pharmacy School    In order to apply to pharmacy school, you'll need to complete the following steps:            * Complete pre-pharmacy courses          * Take the Pharmacy College Admissions Test (PCAT), if required by the school          * Complete the application form and gather supplementary materials, which may include an essay, letters of recommendation, transcripts and test scores          * Sit for an interview, if required, by the school    Pharmacy School Prerequisites    Pharmacy schools require at least two years of specific pre-pharmacy college coursework in order to enter a PharmD program. However, the majority of students have three years of college experience or a bachelor's degree upon entering pharmacy school.  Pharmacy Degree Options  Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD)    This four-year professional degree trains students to practice pharmacy after licensure. Acceptance to a program requires completion of two years of undergraduate pre-pharmacy coursework thus equaling a minimum of six years post-secondary education. The PharmD degree can also lead to graduate studies in the areas of pharmaceutical care, pharmaceutical sciences, and pharmaceutical health policy and management.  Non-Traditional PharmD (PharmD)    This degree is designed for practicing pharmacists with a Bachelor of Science in Pharmacy from an accredited pharmacy school who are interested in practicing at an advanced level. Most often these programs are offered with a very flexible schedule and through online learning, to accommodate the needs of working pharmacists. They also take less time to complete compared to a traditional PharmD.  Pharmacy School Accreditation    Accreditation is a system of evaluating and ensuring the quality of educational institutions and professional programs according to standards set by a national accrediting association. For pharmacy schools, that organization is the American Council on Pharmaceutical Education.  Pharmacist Licensing    A license to practice pharmacy is required in all 50 states. To obtain a license, you must successfully complete an accredited PharmD program and pass the North American Pharmacist Licensure Examination (NAPLEX).|`|nCrSOm9vaa	2 years of Pre-Pharm courses, lots of chemistry and stuff. Then you have to get in to Pharm school, which is very competitive since everyone wants the salaries pharmacists get right of school. Pharm school is 4 years, so 6 years overall.
kvLWTTlhaa	I'm assuming you meant y = x - 1 for the first line =]    If 2x + 5y = 9, then 9 - 2x = 5y and (9 - 2x) / 5 = y.  But y also equals x - 1.    Therefore, x - 1 = (9 - 2x) / 5.  5x - 5 = 9 - 2x  7x = 14  x = 2    Plug the x-value (2) back into an equation.  y = x - 1  y = 2 - 1  y = 1    So your point is (2,1), or letter 'a'.

If the line has a positive slope, any point with x less than 5 must also have y less than 3. Also, any point with x bigger than 5 must also have y bigger than 3.  So, let us see which points meet these conditions:  (4,-2) does  (6,-6) does not (would give negative slope)  (0,7) does not  (would give negative slope)  (3,3) does not  (would give line parallel to x-axis, ie slope =0)|`|ENyb91iKaa	you cant tell the slope of a line by one point because any other point on the plane may also be on the same line.|`|MCjHAtdRaa	yes, no, no, yes(?)  the last one has a zero slope, so i'm not sure if that's positive|`|AA11117287	(4,-2) and (0,7)|`|Bo837qXPaa	(4,-2)  Good luck!|`|YPs00PQHaa	whats the Y intercept?|`|y6i9zW1Laa	(4,2)|`|AA11611389	(4, -2) is the only possibility.

JGf3H3Ikaa	You have an equation. Say 2x+3y=4 and -x+2y=3  Multiply one (or both) equations so that either the x or y will cancel. Here, it's easiest to multiply the second equation by 2. So:  2x+3y=4  (-x+2y=3)*2          Then you get:  2x+3y=4  -2x+4y=6              Add to get:  12y=10    Solve like you usually do then plug the Y value you found in to one of the equations to find X value.

AA11174791	sure  Billy the Kid (1930) is a film about the relationship between frontier outlaw Billy the Kid (Johnny Mack Brown, billed as "John Mack Brown") and Pat Garrett (Wallace Beery), the man who later killed him. Directed by King Vidor, the movie was filmed in an early widescreen process, also used for the lavish The Big Trail the same year. While The Big Trail has been restored so that the 1930 widescreen process can be evaluated by modern viewers, no widescreen prints of Billy the Kid are known to currently exist and the movie can only be viewed in a standard-width version that was filmed simultaneously. Widescreen didn't get a foothold until The Robe two decades later.    Billy the Kid is a 1941 color remake of a 1930 movie of the same name. The film features Robert Taylor as Billy and Brian Donlevy as a fictionalized version of Pat Garrett renamed "Jim Sherwood" in the movie. Directed by David Miller and based on the book by Walter Noble Burns, the cast also included Gene Lockhart and Lon Chaney, Jr.. The film was not as well received as the 1930 original, Billy the Kid (1930 film), which had starred Wallace Beery and been shot in an experimental widescreen process.|`|QRzLPL4gaa	http://www.aboutbillythekid.com/ This link will tell you all you need to know about william H Bonney|`|AA10577991	His name was Henry McCarthy, born Nov. 23rd. died July 14Th 1881, he had blue eyes and allot of people said he was a friendly guy, a 19 century gunfighter, bank robber, who is thought to have killed as many as 21 people, one for each year of his life.|`|AScwZSaaaa	go to google, or try wikipedia|`|1vPWu1dOaa	Father died when he was a kid.

The person has dysgraphia--a disability which causes very poor and/or labored handwriting. sometimes the person with dysgraphia complains of pain when he or she writes-either localized pain in the wrist and the hand or pain throughout the body.    3.  The person has not had sufficient practice in writing well.    4.  the person has another disability which causes problems with fine motor skills.    5.  The person is too young to have developed the strength and fine motor skills necessary to develop good grip and good handwriting practices.|`|AA10936282	I'm a preschool teacher, and I can tell you from experience that all those things children do that seem like "just playing" are designed to help them tackle harder tasks like writing in an easier manner.  Without knowing you what I would suggest is to exercise your hand and fingers to gain the fine motor skills needed to write; once you have these it will become less difficult and tiredsome to write.  Some ways in which you can exercise these necessary skills is by using clay or play-doh to model small figures, try doing balls in different sizes, roll it up to make "snakes", etc.  shred tissue paper using your fingers, you can also form little balls with it; if you shred longer strips you can twist it while you pull it in order to make "threads" of paper.  After some time you can move on to exercise on your actual handwriting, start practicing shapes like circles, and lines in different positions; until you feel ready to move on to individual letters and later words.    These are some websites where you can download and print practice worksheets:  http://www.learningpage.com/free_pages/m...  http://www.first-school.ws/theme/alphabe...  http://www.abcteach.com/directory/basics...|`|54f4c27f9596105c21e29cf9d122dec1aa	Many people in general have bad hand writing.

I say, if you want to get better writing, practice slowly and get the hang of it, after a while it will improve.    go to: www.myhandwriting.com
wmKZLTu0aa	Schedule and Routine. You'll do less yelling and correcting of behaviors if the kids know what they should be doing. That doesn't mean that they'll do it... but then instead of running around the room you can ask what they should be doing and direct them to a quieter/more constructive activity. You can still have variety in your day... what is the same is what kind of activity comes next. Ex... free play, snack, circle (book/song), center choices, art, recess, lunch, "quiet reading time" (yeah right...), nap. This works especially well with toddlers that are about to move to a "preschool" (3 yr old) room.   I don't have much experience in young toddler/infant rooms... but I'd say, have a few exciting choices that are going to keep them engaged.

TWKIuTEyaa	Your sentence is not grammatically correct. You have used the wrong verb construction.    'The government asked for more responsibility to be taken by those top executives ' is grammatically correct, but you should only use 'those' if you have already mentioned specific top executives.    If you have not already referred to specific executives, then you should use:    'The government asked for more responsibility to be given to top executives'.    Either 'responsibility' or responsibilities' would be acceptable. 'Responsibility' in itself can cover numerous activities, so it is not essential to use the plural form.|`|Ioc0owmfaa	The verb used is not very clear.     I suggest:    1.

F9Xb0UEJaa	Yeah --- here's one    The song " BETTY DAVIS EYES " by the singer Kin Carnes      In the song, the singer is describing a rival's sneaky personality,  and a face with ''guilt" written all over it,  by comparing that person's eyes to actress Betty Davis........an actress known for her roles of being sly and under-handed.                An allusion is a literary device that stimulates ideas, associations, and extra information in the reader's mind with only a word or two. Allusion means 'reference'. It relies on the reader being able to understand the allusion and being familiar with all of the meaning hidden behind the words.    Here's an example:    "As the cave's roof collapsed, he was swallowed up in the dust like Jonah, and only his frantic scrabbling behind a wall of rock indicated that there was anyone still alive".    The allusion in the sentence above is to Jonah. The reader is expected to recognize the reference to Jonah and the whale, which should evoke an image of being 'swallowed alive' ... in this case, behind a wall of dust and rock.

Los andrgenos son hormonas esteroideas derivados del ciclopentanoperhidrofenantreno, cuya funcin principal es la de estimular el desarrollo de los caracteres sexuales masculinos.    Los andrgenos, bsicamente la testosterona, son segregados por los testculos, pero tambin por los ovarios en la mujer (androstendiona) y por la corteza suprarrenal de las glndulas suprarrenales (principalmente dihidroepiandrosterona). En el hombre solamente el 10% de los andrgenos tiene origen suprarrenal.    Todos los andrgenos naturales son derivados esteroides del androstano (un ncleo tetracclico de hidrocarburo de 19 tomos de carbono). Es tambin el precursor de todos los estrgenos, las hormonas sexuales femeninas.       Efectos de los andrgenos  [editar]Aunque la principal funcin de los andrgenos es andrognica, virilizante o masculinizante, tambin realizan funciones anablicas sobre todo de las protenas. Desde el descubrimiento de la testosterona, se ha intentado separar la funcin andrognica de la anabolizante, mediante la sntesis de anabolizantes andrognicos esteroideos objetivo que an no se ha alcanzado.    Podra decirse que los efectos de los andrgenos son como mucho los de la testosterona.    Los andrgenos son conocidos por promover el crecimiento tanto normal como canceroso de las clulas prostticas y pueden incidir en el desarrollo del cncer de prstata.       Historia de los andrgenos  [editar]1889: Algunos atribuyen el descubrimiento de los andrgenos al fisilogo y neurlogo francs Eduard Brown-Squard, que tras obtener extractos de testculo de mono, se los inyect y obtuvo rapidez mental y mayor potencia fsica.   1935: Ernest Laqueur consigui aislar e identificar qumicamente la testosterona, adems de contribuir al conocimiento de la fisiologa, farmacologa y clnica de las hormonas sexuales masculinas.   A mediados de los a?os 1950 se produjeron muchos anlogos de la testosterona, nandrolona y dihidrotestosterona, en un intento de obtener un frmaco puramente anablico, pero ninguno de ellos lo demostr. Comenz la era del dopaje en el deporte.      Tipos de andrgenos  [editar]Un subgrupo de andrgenos, los andrgenos adrenales, alberga los 19 esteroides de carbono sintetizados por el crtex adrenal, la parte exterior de la glndula suprarrenal, que funciona a modo de esteroides dbiles o esteroides precursores, entre ellos la dehidroepiandrosterona (DHEA), dehidroepiandrosterona sulfato (DHEA-S) y la androstenediona.    Otros andrgenos aparte de la testosterona son los siguientes:    Dehidroepiandrosterona (DHEA): hormona esteroide producida por el colesterol en el crtex adrenal, que es el precursor primario de los estrgenos naturales. La DHEA tambin se denomina dehidroisoandrosterona or dehidroandrosterona.   Androstenediona (andro): esteroide andrognico, producido por los testculos, el crtex adrenal y los ovarios. Durante el proceso de conversin metablica de los androstenediones en testosterona y otros andrgenos, tambin constituyen la estructura padre de la estrona. El empleo de androstenediona como suplemento atltico o de musculacin ha sido prohibido por el Comit Olmpico Internacional as como por otras organizaciones deportivas.   Androstenediol: metabolito esteroide que se considera el principal regulador de la secrecin de gonadotrofina.   Androsterona: producto qumico que se crea durante la descomposicin de los andrgenos o derivado de la progesterona, que tambin ejerce efectos masculinizantes menores, con una intensidad siete veces inferior a la testosterona. Se encuentra en cantidades similares en el plasma y en la orina tanto de machos como de hembras.   Dihidrotestosterona (DHT): un metabolito de la testosterona que, de hecho, resulta un andrgeno muy potente debido a que se enlaza con ms fuerza a los receptores andrgenos.      Funciones de los andrgenos  [editar]   Desarrollo masculino  [editar]Durante el desarrollo de los mamferos, al principio las gnadas pueden transformarse tanto en ovarios como en testculos[1]. En el ser humano, a partir de la 4a semana ya se pueden encontrar unas gnadas rudimentarias en el mesodermo intermedio cerca de los ri?ones en desarrollo. Hacia la 6a semana, se desarrollan los cordones sexuales epiteliales en los testculos en formacin e incorporan las clulas germinales mientras se desplazan hacia las gnadas. En los varones, ciertos genes del cromosoma Y, en especial el gen SRY, controlan el desarrollo del fenotipo masculinio, incluyendo la conversin de la gnada bipotencial primitiva en testculos. En los varones, los cordones sexuales invaden por completo las gnadas en desarrollo.    A partir de la 8a semana de desarrollo fetal humano, aparecen las clulas de Leydig en las gnadas diferenciadas masculinas. Las clulas epiteliales derivadas del mesodermo de las cuerdas sexuales de los testculos en desarrollo se transforman en clulas de Sertoli cuya funcin ser facilitar la formacin de esperma. Entre los tbulos existe una poblacin menor de clulas no epiteliales, las clulas de Leydig encargadas de la produccin de andrgenos. Las clulas de Leydig se pueden considerar las productoras de andrgenos, que funcionan a modo de hormonas paracrinas y son necesarias para que las clulas de Sertoli puedan facilitar la produccin de esperma. Al poco tiempo de diferenciarse, las clulas de Leydig empiezan a producir andrgenos, necesarios para la masculinizacin del feto varn en desarrollo (incluida la formacin del pene y del escroto).

AA10439008	The number of subsets, including the empty set and the set itself, is always 2 to the power of how many elements there are.  So 2^4 = 16 total subsets.  But the set itself is not a proper subset so there are only 15 of them.  So choose d.    You can see why it is 16 if you list them  { }  {1/6} and three other single element subsets  (1/6, 1/7} , {1/6, 1/8}, and four other two element subsets  {1/6, 1/7, 1/8} and three other three element subsets  and the set itself  1 + 4 + 6 + 4 + 1 = 16

NwbgvzfXaa	A periodical index is a type of reference source that lists periodical articles by subject or author. It includes such entries as:  1. Title of the article  2. Author's name or names if there is more than one author (sometimes a shorter article or news item has no named author)  3. Title of the periodical. Some indexes label the periodical title as the "source" (abbreviated as "so") because the periodical is the source for the article.  4. Volume and issue number of the periodical in which the article appears. A volume often covers one year of publication and an issue is an individual copy within a volume. A volume and/or issue may not be included.  5. Date of the periodical issue in which the article appears.  6. Pages on which the article appears.  7. Additional information about the article such as illustrations, maps, charts that appear in the article.

Choice of Uni      1.- - ignore those who tell you that new unis are rubbish . . . they're not, unless you want to stay in academia and become a Prof or dean etc. new and old are equally good. Employers don't actually care what uni you went to. They are more interested in what qualification you've attained and your degree subject. Actually, sometimes there's a reverse snobbery in place so it might not serve you to go to an old established uni. (that's if they've even heard of it!)    2. Campus - I wouldn't worry too much about the quality of campus life . . . only 1st year students are guaranteed accommodation on campus so you may well find yourself having to find accommodation from year 2 onwards. so best find out what the prices are for lodgings.    3. It seems to me that you are rather missing the point of your HE study and the factors you need to weigh up when choosing a university. There are 3 key factors: 1. does it offer the kind of degree you want? 2. will you be able to find accommodation  after the 1st year. 3. Will you be able to support yourself while studying?

rpRzeGN5aa	February: The 2nd month of the year in the Gregorian calender. Comes from Middle English 'Februarie' from Latin Februrius (month) of purification, from februa, expiatory offerings, possibly of Sabine origin.]  February was named after the Latin term februum, which means purification, via the purification ritual Februa held on February 15 in the old Roman calendar (see http://www.answers.com/topic/february Ov... for more)      Daiquiri: An iced cocktail of rum, lime or lemon juice, and sugar. Named after Daiquir, a village of eastern Cuba. The name Daiquir is also the name of a beach near Santiago, Cuba, and an iron mine in that area, and it is a word of Tano origin.[3] The cocktail was supposedly invented about 1905 in a bar named Venus in Santiago, about 23 miles east of the mine, by a group of American mining engineers.  http://www.answers.com/topic/daiquiri    Victuals: Food supplies; provisions (singular form victual means food fit for human consumption). As a verb, it means 'to provide with food.' As an intransitive verb, it means 'to lay in food supplies' or 'to eat' Alteration (influenced by Late Latin vctulia, provisions) of Middle English vitaille, from Old French, from Late Latin vctulia, provisions, from neuter pl. of Latin vctulis, of nourishment, from vctus, nourishment, from past participle of vvere, to live.  http://www.answers.com/topic/victual    Gauge: There are a number of definitions. See: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/g...    Memento: A reminder of the past; a keepsake.

ed05090e60ffb81604e4d4052b697bd6aa	"A winter snow had fallen on the field. The once bright sky that had shone so brightly in the months before were now taken over by the dark clouds that hung deeply low to the ground. Gray hues from the sky spilled on to the bushes on top of the hill. The further in the distance the darker it was, the longer i looked the darker I became. I wished for some warmth in this ever so melancholy day. As I searched for it all I could find was the bright snow beneath my feet, hardly a substitute for real warmth. Yet the brightness of the snow brought me some comfort."    I wrote this very quickly. Hope that I could help you some. Maybe you could use some ideas from it.  Good luck!|`|1N2wBw3Uaa	It's good.  But you know, never keep repeating anything. Make it stand out the first time, i don't want to keep picturing something over and over agian, because then it becomes boring.        You mentioned to me that the clouds were about the snow field about twice. I want to picture everything int he field in a short amount of time. just once.    if you want to keep the "gray, like the clouds that hung above it." disagred "dark" from the clouds. I automatically think, "black or gray." when i see "dark."    "A cluster of dark, clouds sat above the snow padded field, they appeared dull, but nothing could shadow magificent, solid, white around my feet."  Short and sweet. You don't have to say "snow" for me to realize it. But you can confirm with me witht he following:    "I looked towards the house that was standing in the distance. The snow looked gray near the bushes surrounding the gate. " OR SOMETHING.

In stead of saying a cluster of dark clouds, try something along the lines of "a myriad of daunting gray clouds advanced ever closer in the sky above the field."

So next you could talk about the smells, or what memories the smells invoke. Or the taste (e.g. if you are near the sea, the taste of salt in the air). Write about what you are hearing, are the clouds rumbling, do you hear voices in your head, someone running? How do you feel physically? Alive, cold, anxious? What do you sense? I think you have a great start here as far as what you can see, lets see what you can write about what you feel. Please let me know what you decide to write next!|`|JzSu9Bkaaa	lol have it like     A cluster of dark clouds sat above the field, blocking the lush, azure atmosphere.

It hurt my chances at scholarships and caused me not to get accepted at my first choice.    I would think you're better off doing something that you know more about/feel more comfortable doing, than potentially screwing up chances at getting into the school you want because of a bad grade in a class that doesn't really matter.
S5H0NmEWaa	Chronological linear narrative is describing things in the order in which they occur.    A first person narrator tells the story using the pronoun "I" - "I did this" or "I said that." It would be weird if, when telling the story, the narrator knows things that he or she could not know as a character within the story - for instance, if the narrator was the hero chasing down a villain, he or she wouldn't know what the villain was doing or thinking. Third person omniscient narrative is when your characters are all described by the narrator as "he" or "she" and the narrative voice can describe all sorts of things going on at once that individual characters could not - "Little did he know..."

4EesoL2xaa	There are several things you can do.  Keep the cell phone, it works.  As its inside you and vibrating, rub your fingers over your clit, first slowly, then faster, then slow down.  Keep doing that.    Try a small dildo, or small vibrator.  Same thing, start off slow, then work your way up, and slow down again.  Do that with your dominant hand, and use your other hand to massage your clit.  That's the most important thing, its where all your pleasure gets started.      Also try playing with your nipples.  There are as many sensory receptors in your nipples as there are in your clit.      Good luck, hope it works out for you.

For the second phrase, the verb is "would like", so you need the infinitives afterward.  the "ing" form is not appropriate, especially since you already used an infinitive and you are sharing the "to" part between the two verbs ask and explain.    So the first example you presented is about right.  I wouldn't use the semi-colon though (you can, I just wouldn't).  I would make them into two separate sentences instead.

7LOpJW3zaa	I guess you mean US?  But there was this program my dad was watchin on prisons it was quite good actually :p  Anyway the only part I remember is that they have isolation places for the people who cause chaos and trouble/have  mental problems. They have no contact whatsoever in these isolated places - their food is fed through a hole in the door, they can't talk to anyone and they are surrounded by people also isolated. Really it just made it worse and they all became mentally ill - if they weren't already - and more angry. So yeah that was a stupid idea.  Dunno if it really helps but uhh I think they should get rid of the isolation unit.

An ancient Greek determined the earth was round many years before Columbus "sailed the ocean blue"      King James of England wanted to expand the British Empire, so he sent explorers to the "New World" and eventually more and more people moved here.  The most famous of these trips was the voyage of the Mayflower.  The most famous book about this journey was written by John Bunyan and titled, The Pilgrim's Progress.|`|bwx3epFdaa	People got on large ships and sailed across a big body of water known as the Atlantic Ocean. They did not know that America would be there because they thought the world was flat. Then they started a new civilization at Jamestown. These actions would have deep ramifications for the coming generations. Their motives for sailing into the unknown and uncharted waters were to find new routes for trade to India, but instead they made the colossal discovery of the land we now know as America. The sailors were plagued by scurvy, malnutrition, disease, and many other horrific obstacles.      Hope that helps for homework.

I wouldn't include pictures IN the essay, the essay is supposed to explain your intended studies and previous experience IN WORDS. However, in addition the essay, you could send in a CD with your images of your thesis, with perhaps brief captions. Explain how your thesis relates to your grad work in the essay, then provide the visuals as a supplement in a CD.

727db85c0f71b3166d409ebf38b6ee35aa	Judaism itself had little effect one way or the other, but Christianity very much did contribute to the fall of the Empire. In part, it did so by undermining traditional Roman values and virtues. It also had a lot to do with the loss of a common Roman identity. In other words, towards the end, Romans began to lose any shared sense of what it meant to be a Roman.    Start out with this premise:    Christianity was the revenge of the Jews on the Roman Empire.  It's a bit of a jest, but also true in a sense.  See where you can get from there.    The basic skeleton of the idea is that Roman military and political domination of the Jews gave rise to a Jewish messianic movement, which spawned Chrisitanity, which eventually became a powerful corrosive influence in the collapse of the Roman Empire.  The Church eventually supplanted the Roman Empire as the dominant political institution in Europe, but this was only accomplished by the abandonment by the Church of the late Roman tradition of religious tolerance.    I have to disagree with the guy below who thinks that somehow the Jewish revolts changed the "psychology" of the Empire by showing that revolt was possible.  Everybody in the Empire knew that revolt was "possible",  in the sense that it could be done.  What they also knew was the terrible consequence of revolt.  Nothing about the Jewish revolt altered that calculus.      The Empire had already destroyed the Jewish nation by 70 A.D., with the destruction of the temple.  What the rest of the Empire saw after the defeat of the Bar Kochba revolt was that Rome was willing to suffer casualties in order to utterly and ruthlessly crush anyone who stood in her way, and that revolt would be met with annihilation.  Simon Bar Kochba was just another pretender to leadership against the Romans, who was taken as a messiah by a desperate Jewish people, and who led them to their final ruin.    To give as much credit to Bar Kochba as that guy does is to ignore the far greater successes against the Romans that were enjoyed by the likes of Hannibal, Vercingeterix and Boudicca before Rome utterly destroyed them.  Rome understood that failed uprisings don't inspire anybody.  And I can't imagine where he gets that 440,000 casualty figure.  Given that that is about half the entire population of Rome at the time, it seems grossly inflated to me.    80,000 Roman casualties in the Great Rebellion?  Here's the straight skinny.  The Jewish Zealots routed the small Roman garrison in Jerusalem and then defeated a somewhat larger force sent from Syria.  Then Rome got serious and sent in some 60,000 troops who commenced to kill an estimated million Jews over the next two years.    I'd love to know where he gets the idea that suddenly, in the middle of the second century, Roman provinces started rebelling against Roman rule because they were encouraged by the failed Jewish Revolt.  That's a crock.  Roman provinces didn't start rebelling at all.  It wasn't until the barbarian migrations of later centuries, following the establishment of Christianity as a state religion, that Rome began to fracture.    Anyway, the answer is that Roman religious tolerance worked against her.  Alien religions, along with new social norms, foreign philosophies, expansion of citizenship into the provinces, disagreements over what it meant to be a Roman, acted like a solvent that, over time, dissolved traditional Roman values and virtues, and caused the Roman social order to fracture.  The pacifistic and egalitarian nature of early Christianity had a lot to do with that.   I think that early Christianity, as an applied political/military model, was fundamentally incompatible with empire. So, When the barbarians came, Rome was already a shadow of her former glory.|`|AMCuX8XPaa	Hummm - I can't imagine that Judaism had that much to do with the fall of Rome.  Christians were often lumped together with Jews - and as the old gods began to fail everywhere, all around the Mediterranean, they were also failing in Rome - Christianity/Judaism was filling some of that gap.      I know that Rome was stuffed with all sorts of religions in those days.  The Isis cults had come in from Egypt.  There's quite a good looking Isis temple in the ruins of Pompey.  Mithracism - perhaps the Gnostics were active at that point.  Perhaps all this shook the religious foundation of Rome - but the old gods were dying anyway and would have died out without the help of Judaism.      It would seem that if Judaism had anything to do with the fall of Rome that it was just that Judaism contributed to the welter of conflicting religious beliefs.  Mostly empires fall because their money becomes worthless - and that's what happened in Rome - lack of gold coming in debased the currency, money couldn't be trusted - and finally that system failed - foreign armies showed up to exploit the weakness.|`|al8PapTXaa	Here is the answer I think you are looking for... Israel was the first occupied territory to stand up to the Romans.  It happened in three separate revolts.    In the first revolt (The Great Revolt - around the year 66 ad) 80,000 Roman Troops were killed.  It began because of religious tensions between the Greeks and the Jews.  The Jews revolted because they felt the Romans allowed the Greeks to disrespect their land by permitting the Greeks to sacrifice birds to their gods in front of local synagogues.    In the second revolt (The Kitos War 115-117) - around 440,000 Roman and Greek Troops were killed.    In the third revolt (The Bar Kokhba Revolt in 132-135 ad) a whole Roman legion (Legio XXII Deiotariana) was wiped out.  Many many unknown other Romans were also killed.  It was a blood bath.  Bar Kokhba was thought to be the Messiah and he led the revolt... he was able to generate so much trouble because so many Jews believe he was the Messiah.    The importance of these revolts wasn't so much that it hurt the Romans militarily but it demonstrated to the whole Roman Empire that territories could revolt and put up a good fight if they wanted to.  Before these 3 revolts, no one dared revolt.  After these 3 revolts, the other Roman territories were much less afraid of the Romans and began to revolt.      This is how Jews contributed to the Fall of the Roman Empire... they were the crack in the damn.

3OoCiOkAaa	I'm dyslexic so I keep it simple    It has begun to rain =It's begun to rain    It is perfect = It's perfect    These are both right.      HOWEVER:     The possessive form of the pronoun  =  'its'.   It does not have an apostrophe before the s.     The cat is licking its  paws is right    Th cat is licking it's paws is wrong.      It's is a contraction for "it is or it has". It is a shortened version of these two clauses.    You wouldn't write:  The cat has stopped licking it has paws   The cat has stopped licking it is paws.    Therefore you would not write "it's" .    The cat has stopped licking its paws.    That is the easier way to remember     If you can write it has or  it is= it's  If it is a possession  you write = its      The professor is right and simply explained it poorly. There is no apostrophe after its - that wouldn't make sense. I don't know if that was your addition or the college professors.    Apostrophes are only used to replace a  letter or letters.|`|bogfZ6Xsaa	I think the only way you can use it that way is in a sentence like this....    "I hate using all the its' and ours at the beginning of sentences!"    If you notice...spell check doesn't correct it. I wouldn't use it very often at all though!!    Hope this helps!|`|eDL3cnL4aa	its' ?  no such animal|`|bc80b085beb98b92a6819181843ddbbbaa	Its' is not a word, ever:)    Its is the possessive pronoun and it's is a contraction.    The college professor needs a lesson in grammar!|`|hvcjyEmDaa	The expression does exist. Here are guidelines on where to put     the apostrophe:    Brought to you by the Purdue University Online Writing Lab    The apostrophe has three uses:    1) to form possessives of nouns  2) to show the omission of letters  3) to indicate certain plurals of lowercase letters.    Apostrophes are NOT used for possessive pronouns or for noun plurals, including acronyms.    Forming possessives of nouns    To see if you need to make a possessive, turn the phrase around and make it an "of the..." phrase. For example:    the boy's hat = the hat of the boy  three days' journey = journey of three days    If the noun after "of" is a building, an object, or a piece of furniture, then no apostrophe is needed!    room of the hotel = hotel room    door of the car = car door    leg of the table = table leg    Once you've determined whether you need to make a possessive, follow these rules to create one.|`|qPDnxTE0aa	Yes, sometimes it is appropriate to use the word "its".  One of my teacher's actually gave me a good idea for finding out when the appropriate time to use the word "its".   When reading your sentence substitute 'it is" in place of "its". If it does not make sense then use the word its'.  For example:   It's cold outside. - correct use of "it's"  The co-op just lost its land contract. - correct use of "its"    As you can see the use of "it is" in the second statement would not make sense. Thus the use of "its" is appropriate.

AA10023710	SUNY Albany is a good school, and your GPA is good, so I want you to look at the better CUNYs for your transfer: Hunter, Baruch, Lehman. Maybe Queens and Brooklyn. Focus mainly on Hunter, or if your major is business, then on Baruch. Make those your top choices.     When you study, please be sure to gain as much real-world experience for your resume as you can. This includes doing career-related work on campus, and trying to get an internship. This will make you more employable when  you graduate.     I believe you won't have a problem transferring to Hunter or etc., so long as you write a good application. Your GPA is good.     If you want to try to stay at Albany, I'd have you do the following:   - Go speak to the people in financial aid. Tell them your situation, and that you may need to transfer due to finances. Ask if they can rework your financial aid package so that you can stay, because you really do want to. Tell them that. See what they say.   - Speak to the academic advisor for your major. Tell that person that you are thinking of transferring because you can't afford to stay. Tell her you love it there, but you might have to leave. See if she suggests anything. Not that she can, but you never know.   - Apply for private scholarships. Use Fastweb and other scholarship websites - you can ask the guys in financial aid for their recommendations. Also, if you or your parents belong to any groups, or know of any, check there as well. Examples include things like your parent's employer, the Rotary Club, Knights of Columbus, any groups that are based on your ethnicity, etc. All have scholarships you may be able to apply for.   - See if you can speed up your graduation date, so you need less re: loans by the time you graduate. Ask your academic advisor if you can take more classes each term, and not have your tuition increase, then try that for one term and see if it works out. Also ask if you can take classes at your local community college during the summer, and have those transfer back. CC classes in NY are cheaper than those at Albany, and that could possibly help a bit.  - Apply to become an RA (Resident Assistant) at Albany. I don't know if Albany calls them that, but that's the student who serves as staff on your hall/in your dorm. Usually, you get a free room in exchange for the work you do, and that helped me save huge $$$ during school. Some schools give free room, plus a small stipend. Others just give free room, but it all helps.   - Drop the meal plan, buy a microwave and mini fridge, and fix your meals in your room. This may be less fun than eating in the cafeteria with your friends, but it's often cheaper. Or at minimum, drop down a level in the mealplan - drop down to the plan where you only eat 2 meals in the caf, and prepare breakfast in your room. It's often cheaper.

It seems that answer is c( it is hard to understand the way   that answers are written)    3. The answer you selected (b) is not right one.  The set of positive rational  s under the operation of addition   is not a group because it doesn't have identity element.  The identity element could be zero but we have just positive rational.  We also don't have inverse elements.    The correct answer is d:    The set of non-0 real  s under the operation of multiplication  makes a group.    a. it is closed under multiplication.  b. It has property of associativity.  c. Identity element is 1.  d. Every element x  from set has an inverse  element 1/x from the set ( we have just non-0 real numbers).      4. Answer c. Correct.    5. Inverse of (a, b // c , d ) is  inverse matrix    1/(ad-bc) * (d, -b // -c, a )    That's answer c.

DvToP5h7aa	Harriet Tubman  c.1820 - 1913    Harriet Tubman is perhaps the most well-known of all the Underground Railroad's "conductors." During a ten-year span she made 19 trips into the South and escorted over 300 slaves to freedom. And, as she once proudly pointed out to Frederick Douglass, in all of her journeys she "never lost a single passenger."    http://www.harriettubman.com/index.html    http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4p1535...    http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USA...    http://www.americaslibrary.gov/cgi-bin/p...    http://inventors.about.com/library/inven...    http://afroamhistory.about.com/od/harrie...

DxPhRKfHaa	What are your interests? Is there something you're passionate about?

NwbgvzfXaa	Mentioning the person's problem(s) will help confirm you understand it correctly. It also gives the reader the impression that you have listened and understand their problem(s).  I would then follow up with how I understand how they feel. I would then relate a similar problem that I have experienced and how I was able to handle or it turned out to be not as big of a problem than I thought.  Emphasize to the reader how others care about and/or depend on the reader. Mention children, spouses, relatives, friends, etc.   Explain how friends and professionals are available and willing to help the reader if the reader would just ask.  Describe how others are worse off and still persevere.

The individual changes are most often small or gradual and the genetic drift is most often slow. But in the long run it can constitute a large part of the changes in a gene pool.

g5RS83paaa	Appeasement is "the policy of settling international quarrels by admitting and satisfying grievances through rational negotiation and compromise, thereby avoiding the resort to an armed conflict which would be expensive, bloody, and possibly dangerous."[1] The term is most often applied to the foreign policy of British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain towards Nazi Germany between 1937 and 1939.    Appeasement has been the subject of debate for eighty years among academics and politicians. The historian's assessment of Chamberlain has ranged from condemnation to the judgment that he had no alternative and acted in Britain's best interests. The word "appeasement" has been used as a synonym for cowardice since the 1930s and it is still used in that sense today as a justification for firm, often armed, action in international relations.|`|pe69KF3Taa	in simple terms, appeasement means to make peace, especially in war- when a weaker force gives into the demands of a stronger force in order to keep the peace.|`|EtWYOWyOaa	http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/A...

Superior organization and strategy allowed France and its Indian allies to dominate the first two years of the war. But William Pitt, named British secretary of state in 1757, then increased Britain's financial commitment to the war, giving British soldiers and their American colonial allies the resources they needed to defeat the French in battle by 1760.

'De la' is the feminine singular 'of the'.|`|1y1c5QWHaa	'De' is neutral, meaning it isn't masculine or feminine, and it means 'of'.   'Du' is masculine of 'de la', and it means 'of the'.   'Des' is also neutral, and is plural of 'une/un', so it means 'some'.    Hope this helps you!|`|60stp1MNaa	its de la with a feminine word using "of the" or "some" like   du is masculine words with the same "of the" or "some"  des is when you have a plural form of whatever your saying.

VnzakYDCaa	Here you have sample essay questions from the past AP World exams    like     The questions below are not written in actual test format, but rather are meant as a starting point in formulating a question. Most have time frames that are way too broad for a CCOT question, and most need less choice being offered among the regions.       Most questions will probably cover one era and cover one or more of these themes:    1.    Impact of interaction among major societies (trade, systems of international exchange, war, and diplomacy).  2.    Impact of technology and demography on people and the environment (population growth and decline, disease, manufacturing, migrations, agriculture, weaponry).    Read more here:

First equation:  Move stuff around so you get:  5y = 105 - 3x  y = 105/5 - 3/5x    Plug this into second equation:  4(105/5 - 3/5x) - 3z = 33    Simplify:  4(21 - 3/5x) - 3z = 33  84 - 12/5x - 3z = 33  51 - 12/5x = 3z  Solve for z:  z = 51/3 - 12/15x    3rd equation: now plug in what you got above for y and z:  5x - 2(105/5 - 3/5x) = 521 - 2(51/3 - 12/15x)    Simplify:  5x - 210/5 + 6/5x = 521 - 102/3 + 24/15x  5x + 6/5x - 24/15x = 521-34+42  5x + 6/5x-8/5x = 521+8  5x -2/5x = 529  25/5x - 2/5x = 529  23/5x = 529  x = 529*5/23    (When you work back through this, make sure I didn't make any math errors.  But, you should be able to see the process.)    Then, take your answer for x and plug it back into the equations for y and z to get the correct answer.    You can also use linear algebra to figure this out, but I don't know how to do a matrix in this format.

In the essay, you need to include every details and how you develop your conclusions.      There is no fixed rules in a power point presentation.  However, a good one will consider the fonts size, color...etc. to make sure it is an enjoyment for the audience.  Usually, you don't put details there, nor do you put how your conclusion developped.  Instead, those details come directly from you, the speaker.  It is usually more like an index plus important tables, pictures to assist your argument.

Since you must multiply 5 by 20 to get 100, you must multiply 5 by 11 also.  5 x 11 = 55  therefore, the answer is 55/100 or 55%    Here's another example if you don't get the first problem completely.  4/50  *Remember that 100 must ALWAYS be the denominator in a percent.   2 x 50 = 100  Because you multiplied 2 by 50 to get 100 as the denominator, you must also multiply 2 by 4 to get your numerator.  2 x 4 = 8  8/100   The answer is 8%|`|X9LasrVCaa	The answer before me was quite complicated, but this can be done far more simply.    Divide 11 by 20 and times the result by 100 and add a % mark as at the end.|`|jMH0667faa	What you can do is have 11/20, what is that over a 100.         11/20 is ?/100. So it would be 55% by cross multiplication|`|wZloBlGlaa	just convert it to something out of 100    so 11/20 = ?/100  multiply the 20 by 5 to get 100  So then you multiply 11 by 5, which is 55  so 55/100  55%|`|l9a8sFT7aa	There are some really good answers here, but here is a web site that has been a life saver for me on all kinds of Math work, it gives you step by step on multiple examples.|`|AA10439008	One easy way is to make it equal p/100 then cross multiply.  p/100 = 11/20  20p = 1100  so p = 1100 / 20 = 55%|`|cDz6jxxnaa	divide the top number by the bottom to get a decimal example: 11 divided by 20= 0.55 then you move the decimal over 2 spaces to the right or multiply it by 100. example: 0.55 times 100= 55. So your answer would be 55%. Hope I helped! lol i only know this cuz we just finished that unit:)|`|zCHnMeXbaa	divide the denominator into the numerator to arrive at percentage.    11 divided by 20 equals .55   or 55%    some other examples    6 divided by 20 equals .30    or 30%    6 divided by 82 equals .0671  or 6.71%|`|B2VdqdVQaa	if you can use a calculator, divide the numbers, then multiply that number by 100.  If you can't then multiply the denominator to make it 100.  Then multiply the numerator by the same number    ex: 3/10    -calc: 0.3*100=30%  -no calc: 10*10=100, 3*10= 30, put in in regular form: 30/100.  and the numerator is the percent, 30%.|`|Qj2L9flFaa	Step 1: Know what a fraction is. A fraction is an expression of a number. It has a numerator (the number on top) and a denominator (the number on the bottom). They are not by themselves percentages, but can easy be convereted into one with some simlpe mathematical skills.  Step  2:  Multiply the fraction by 100 to get the percentage. For example, take the fraction 1/2. Multiply 1/2 by 100/1 and it equals 100/2. Divide 100 by 2 and it equals 50. The percentage that is equal to 1/2 is 50%.  Step  3:  Find the lowest common denominator. Sometimes you will know the percentage of a fraction but you will not recognize it. For example, what percentage are the fractions 45/60, 96/768 and 140/560? They are the same as 3/4, 1/8 and 1/4: it's just harder to see at first glance. To find the lowest common demoninator, divide each number in the fraction by the same number. Using the 45/60 example, you can see that both numbers can be divided by 15. This reduces the fraction to 3/4 or .75, which equals 75%.  Step  4:  Cross multiply the fractions. If you have a difficult fraction like 9/16, write down x/100 right next to it on a piece of paper and cross multiply (the x is for the percentage that you are trying to find). So multiply 9 times 100 and x times 16). You now have an equation that looks like 16x = 900. Divide both sides by 16 to get the equation x = 900/16. Get out the calculator and we find that the answer is 56.26%.    hope this helped:)   for your example    11/20 so multiply 20 by 5 and 11 by 5    that gives you 55/100    since a percent is a part of a whole    the whole is 100 and part of it is 55   so your percent is 55%|`|zldzCjGraa	Just divide the numerator by the denominator.  11/20=eleven divided by twenty= .55  then multiply by 100  .55 X 100=55%|`|FpMGM0TRaa	Percent is "per cent" or "per hundred".  Do you know how to simplify a fraction? Well, here we are going to do the reverse.     11/20= 55/100 because 20 goes into 100 5 times.     Since percent is per hundred, you want your denominator to be 100. If the denominator is 100, than the numerator is the percentage.     So 55/100= 55%|`|gaEspFcSaa	if you mean that you need to learn how to change a fraction to a percent then an easy way to do this is to get the denominator to 100 and the the numerator would be your percent... so to get 20 to be 100 you multiply it by 5 and if u multiply the denominator you must multiply the numerator by the same amount so you would get 55/100 and 55% would be the answer... for a harder one where the denominator doesnt multiply exactly into 100 like in this fraction: 12/27 you could multiply it by 100 first instead to get 1200/2700 and the divide by what the denominator originally was so you would get 44.4/100 and your percent would be 44.4

AA10847147	Well from what I remember equivalent fractions are like 1/2, 2/4, and 3/6. To me they are different by the number of sections each is divided into like for 1/2 there are two sections, 2/4 there are four, etc. They are also different in the sense of how many sections are needed to have half of them. In 1/2 only one is needed you get the point, other wise i would assume that they would be the same. I hope I helped and actually understand this problem as to not make like a total fool of myself in the math world.

5oAU7S9zaa	On New Year's Day, 1825, at the last of his annual White House receptions, President James Monroe made a pleasing impression upon a Virginia lady who shook his hand:    "He is tall and well formed. His dress plain and in the old style.... His manner was quiet and dignified. From the frank, honest expression of his eye ... I think he well deserves the encomium passed upon him by the great Jefferson, who said, 'Monroe was so honest that if you turned his soul inside out there would not be a spot on it.' "    Born in Westmoreland County, Virginia, in 1758, Monroe attended the College of William and Mary, fought with distinction in the Continental Army, and practiced law in Fredericksburg, Virginia.    As a youthful politician, he joined the anti-Federalists in the Virginia Convention which ratified the Constitution, and in 1790, an advocate of Jeffersonian policies, was elected United States Senator. As Minister to France in 1794-1796, he displayed strong sympathies for the French cause; later, with Robert R. Livingston, he helped negotiate the Louisiana Purchase.    His ambition and energy, together with the backing of President Madison, made him the Republican choice for the Presidency in 1816. With little Federalist opposition, he easily won re-election in 1820.    Monroe made unusually strong Cabinet choices, naming a Southerner, John C. Calhoun, as Secretary of War, and a northerner, John Quincy Adams, as Secretary of State. Only Henry Clay's refusal kept Monroe from adding an outstanding Westerner.    Early in his administration, Monroe undertook a goodwill tour. At Boston, his visit was hailed as the beginning of an "Era of Good Feelings." Unfortunately these "good feelings" did not endure, although Monroe, his popularity undiminished, followed nationalist policies.    Across the facade of nationalism, ugly sectional cracks appeared. A painful economic depression undoubtedly increased the dismay of the people of the Missouri Territory in 1819 when their application for admission to the Union as a slave state failed. An amended bill for gradually eliminating slavery in Missouri precipitated two years of bitter debate in Congress.    The Missouri Compromise bill resolved the struggle, pairing Missouri as a slave state with Maine, a free state, and barring slavery north and west of Missouri forever.    In foreign affairs Monroe proclaimed the fundamental policy that bears his name, responding to the threat that the more conservative governments in Europe might try to aid Spain in winning back her former Latin American colonies. Monroe did not begin formally to recognize the young sister republics until 1822, after ascertaining that Congress would vote appropriations for diplomatic missions. He and Secretary of State John Quincy Adams wished to avoid trouble with Spain until it had ceded the Floridas, as was done in 1821.    Great Britain, with its powerful navy, also opposed reconquest of Latin America and suggested that the United States join in proclaiming "hands off." Ex-Presidents Jefferson and Madison counseled Monroe to accept the offer, but Secretary Adams advised, "It would be more candid ... to avow our principles explicitly to Russia and France, than to come in as a ****-boat in the wake of the British man-of-war."    Monroe accepted Adams's advice. Not only must Latin America be left alone, he warned, but also Russia must not encroach southward on the Pacific coast. ". . . the American continents," he stated, "by the free and independent condition which they have assumed and maintain, are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any European Power." Some 20 years after Monroe died in 1831, this became known as the Monroe Doctrine.|`|JMpFVt2Xaa	James Monroe served one term as governor of Virginia, then was sent to France by Thomas Jefferson to negotiate the Louisiana Purchase. An officer during the American Revolution, Monroe was an all-around statesman whose career included stints as congressman, senator, foreign diplomat and cabinet member. In 1811 he was appointed Secretary of State under President James Madison, and in 1816 Monroe won the presidential election. He was easily re-elected in 1820 (winning 231 of 232 electoral votes), and his administration was termed "The Era of Good Feelings", a time when the United States focused on expansion and ignored the troubles of the European nations. He is famous for the Monroe Doctrine (1823), which proclaimed U.S. hostility toward any European intervention in the Americas.    Monrovia, the capital of Liberia, is named after President Monroe... Monroe's was the first inauguration held outdoors... He was married to Elizabeth Kortright Monroe in 1786. He died less than a year after she died... Monroe died on 4 July 1831, five years to the day after Jefferson and John Adams... He was succeeded by John Quincy Adams.

i6RHI18Paa	Absolute value is never negative as it is always a DISTANCE and technically not a numeric value, but you treat it as one when doing the math.    Reset a vehicle's trip meter and drive to the store. Watch the meter as you go along the way, you will see it is adding up the distance traveled. Let's say you get to the store and it is one mile exactly.    Okay, now you go home. Did you just go home and go "negative one mile?" NO WAY! Absolute value is a distance, which is never 'negative' in value.     Let's add up the trip to the store from your house. We will show going back to the house. Okay :    1 mile to store + | -1 mile back from store |  = 2 miles    Okay, now your problem:    8 - |16-y|, if y=11    Order of operations:    8 - |16-11|    Order of operations:    8 - |5|    Order of operations:    8 - 5 = 3    Good luck!|`|jIk2ttH1aa	Remember that absolute value is the distance away from ZERO.    Solving inequalities can be tricky. First of all, you have to   understand the definition of absolute value to see why there are   always two equations to solve.     The definition of absolute value says that          |x| = x, if x >=0   or        |x| = -x if x     This definition may look very puzzling, but if you think about   it for a while, it makes sense. Remember, the absolute value of   a number can never be negative.    For example, if x = 3, then |x| = 3, because 3 > 0. However,   if x = -3, then |x| = -(-3) = 3, because -3   |x| is not negative.    Here are two examples.    1) 5|x| + 3 > 12       First, isolate |x| by subtracting 3 from both sides. You don't      have to reverse the inequality sign.       5|x| > 9   Divide both sides by 5: again, no need to reverse the      inequality sign.       |x| > 9/5       Now, to drop the absolute value sign, represent the two conditions      of the definition:       x > 9/5, if x >=0, or -x > 9/5, if x        Simplify the second inequality by multiplying both sides by -1,      reversing the inequality sign:       x > 9/5 or x        Examine the two statements. Is there at least one number that      satisfies both conditions at the same time? That is, can you have      a number that is greater than 9/5 AND less than -9/5? If not, then      the solution is two nonintersecting sets on either side of |9/5|.                    x     -9/5           9/5       x    (2) Here's another example. Use the definition to rewrite the absolute       value expression as two equations and solve each equation:        |x + 2|         (x + 2)         x  -5        (multiply both sides by -1                                      and reverse the sign)      x  -7        In this case, x is a number that lies between 3 and -7, so the       solution is the intersection of the two sets.                            -7      x        3    I hope these two examples help you understand how to solve your   equations. Let us know if you need more help.|`|glynFK9haa	Absolute value means the distance a number is from 0.  The absolute value of 3, for example, is 3.
