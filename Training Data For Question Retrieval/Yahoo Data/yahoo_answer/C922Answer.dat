AA10998189	Most principal economic reforms usually revolve around economic liberalism.  Economic liberalism is predicated on the principles of private property and individual contracts. The early theory was based on the assumption that the economic actions of individuals are largely based on self-interest, and that allowing them to do so without any restrictions will produce the best results, provided that at least minimum standards of public information and justice exist, e.g., no-one should be allowed to coerce or steal.<br>  <br>  This implies that the privileges and restrictions should be abolished and everybody should have the freedom to choose a profession, sell and buy, make contracts etc. as long as all participants are voluntary. Every restriction reduces the set of alternatives and thus often forces people to choose less beneficial alternatives.<br>  <br>  The key advantages of economic liberalism is individual freedom and efficient markets.  The key disadvantage is marshalling resources to a common national purpose can be more challenging.|`|AA11485975	If implented in decency and honesty it can me a little more equitable dealing.

3fc21305ef51013654eb8e1a5e03daf3aa	I worked in the food departments at Disneyland Resort, Anahiem, Ca.  I had a great time meeting new people and seeing the other side of Disneyland.  I think it is a great place to start too.  On my 60th day, I received a $0.50 raise.  I didn't even ask for a raise or for a review of my performance.  I thought that was cool.  I only worked there for the summer, but I did have a lot of fun and after working in the legal field for 12 years, I think working at Disneyland is a breeze.  Also, they make you take your breaks and lunch, and the benefits were good too.  I never used them; however, but I at least knew I was covered if I got sick, etc.<br>  <br>  The environment is clean and polished.

e63e0343ae5fa0e37b26eda63a24f8bcaa	Accounting is a profession not fit for the faint of heart. The course might be quite difficult if you don't have the love for it. It is not enough that you love working with numbers but LOGIC plays a good role in accounting. Accounting is basically 75% arithmetic. NO HARD MATH. The problem encountered by most majors lie in the fact that there is a difficulty in grasping the concept and the use of logic in solving the problems. This is the case when you're inside the classroom walls. <br>  <br>  But if you've already passed the board exam and now a licensed CPA, application of Accounting is not that difficult but there's a catch, laws heavily regulate the profession especially when it comes to TAXES and AUDIT and ASSURANCE SERVICES given that FRAUD is very pervasive and prevalent today.<br>  <br>  How it pays?

If you take all the courses at the same time,  it may take a month(lots of study for a month), and then you may apply for the test if you have a broker sponsering you.  Once you get your license, by passing the test, you have to take post-license courses also.  Other states have similar requirements, some states have less or more criteria.

I had a friend that just bought a e-machine pc with 17" monitor, Klipsch 2.1 sound system, and a good mouse and keyboard for around $900 with an extended warranty of 3 years.

AA10671705	REO's and Foreclosures are the same.  Both are already owned by the bank.  Short sales are when the owner is trying to sell for less than they owe on the house.  Their lender must agree to accept less than the amount owed.<br>  Many foreclosre/REO homes are trashed because the former owners are immature and mad at the bank and take it out on the home.  Mature people realize they had a deal and if they can't hold their end of the deal, than the bank is only doing its job when it forecloses.  <br>  I don't believe you can use funds from CalPERS for anything besides a CalPERS loan.  FHA loans are different than CalPERS.  FHA loans require 3.5% down.  If your agent structures the loan offer correctly, you should be able to get the seller to pay most or all of your closing costs.  Don't try to save on the price of the home by offering alot less than the asking price.  Pay closer to the real price they want, and let them pay the closing cost up to 6%.  Getting a lower rate on your loan will save you much more in the long term than cutting $5k to $10k on your purchase price.<br>  Good luck and happy home owning!
r0clhYvmaa	It does sound positive, but then it may have been that way for another candidate too.  I have learnt that you really don't know what is going on in their minds. I have had long interviews where all sides were impressed, then was asked to do another interview for another job, another one and a half hours, and I did not get either job! Ironically, all the interviews I thought I totally stuffed up were the ones where I got the job.  If I heard what you did from the hiring woman she would have to be pretty insensitive to reject you after saying she had been hoping to poach, so I would be hopeful. good luck.

OacSIfSiaa	First of all it is hard to tell you what your monthly payment would be because a mortgage payment takes into consideration what they refer to as the PITI factor (Principle, Interest, Taxes and Insurance) and without knowing your locations tax rate and insurance costs it can not be done.<br>  <br>  Also you must know this, most mortgages are what they call "front loaded" that means that they get their interest first and apply very little to the principle.  This means that after lets say 2 years, you will see that your balance is still around $95,000 and that you paid a lot in interest.<br>  <br>  The interest is factored over a 30 year payment (meaning they charge 5% of the principle balance as interest every year.  I can tell you that a mortgage for $125,000 @ 6.5% comes to about $790.00 a month for 30 years.  (principle only). You wind up paying with the following 30 yrs (360 payments) X $790.00 = $284,400 as the actual cost of the house that you borrowed $125,000 to buy.<br>  <br>  And as I stated the banks get their money first so towards the end most of the payment is applied to the principle.  You should ask if the mortgage is front loaded or spread before you decide on who to finance through.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps explain how mortgages work.|`|MmTe8W8uaa	The amount of interest does decrease as the amount still owed decreases.  (You do NOT keep paying interest on the portion that you have already repaid.)<br>  <br>  However, the TOTAL amount that you pay is constant.  Your earlier payments are most interest.  As the amount of interest goes down, the amount of principal that you repay each month goes up, so the total is constant.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, because you are allowed to deduct the interest, but not the payments of principal, on your taxes, the net amount that the mortgage really costs you (your payments per year minus the value of the tax deduction) goes UP.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	Chris top is correct. You would continue to pay interest on the loan throughout the term of the loan. As the balance on the loan decreases, the principal, the amount  of interest decreases.

Your payment of $536.82 will not change until you paid off the loan. It's only the portion of interest/principal is affect when you pay additional amount.  Like the 1st installment of your example is P=$120.15 and I=$416.67 and the last installment on the 30th year is P=$534.59 and I=$2.23.

The creditor would then have to refile to seize the funds from your bank accounts and that is only if permitted in your state.<br>  <br>  If you are receiving SSDI then they can not touch those funds at all except for back taxes, child support or criminal fines owed.<br>  <br>  You might want to call the court that issued the judgment and speak to them to find out for sure.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps answer your question.|`|ecedd300662492407b4b61dc35388364aa	No, they are not considered earnings.  However, you should have showed up to court at the hearing to garnish your wages and/or bank accounts and notified the judge of your situation.  This would have prevented a lot of headaches.  You need to consult with a lawyer and try to get back into court to settle the situation, possibly.
df2da08c56595fad19dec6529fc73bc0aa	Yeah, if you do it right. I mean, you can't sell something that you can get at a store for a ridiculous price. I mainly use ebay to buy things that I can't find here on this continent, like a UK single I just received in the mail.<br>  <br>  I also have to set up a seller's account there. Going to try to get rid of some things that I don't need or use anymore; it's just taking up space in my house.

I've seen people selling potato chips on there. Things like electronics, dvd collections, sports tickets, and women's high end purses go fast. Another thing that sells on ebay's half.com is college text books. My roomates and I buy a lot of our books from there used because they are too expensive in the store. But pretty much anything will sell on ebay.|`|8c38955888b1fce5d54537ecd4fe3412aa	The "get rich quick on ebay" is a myth.

If you know you are doing your job to the best of your ability and your immediate bosses have no problems with you, than just ignore them. They will have more satisfaction if they know they are bothering you. There are some people whom just try to make another's life miserable and it sounds like they are accomplishing their goal. <br>  <br>  OR maybe they are seeing how you react to consider you to be a part of their team? <br>  <br>  If none of the above fits your situation (and it's hard for us to know as we are not there), perhaps you could turn the table...be as nice to them as you can...ALWAYS say good morning...good night...nice weather we're having...always SOMETHING positive!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and Good luck.   ;)|`|0xZfXJlSaa	Speak to the woman directly. Do not confront her. Be as nice as possible and state your concerns.  Is there a chance you are being a bit paranoid?  If this doesn't work, speak to your superior. If that doesn't work try and ignore her.  She sounds like a very nosey woman.  Why would she bother with you if you don't even work with her?    There has to be someone on your side if you are doing your job properly.

RslLQ1O5aa	Bancos trabalham vendendo seus produtos, Previdência Privada, seguros, consórcios etc s?o a forma com que eles atraem, mantêem e diversificam a sua carteira de produtos. Acho que vc deve avaliar de duas formas:<br>  1) Vc está preocupada com o futuro a longo prazo de seus filhos, ent?o quer procurar garantir uma receita financeira quando esse futuro chegar. ótimo, eu tb tenho o meu, no meu caso, eu busquei um plano que me trazia algumas vantagens, se acontecer algo comigo, minha esposa recebe tudo que investir e quando eu me "aposentar", minha renda é vitalícia até eu morrer. Se eu morrer um dia depois que eu passar a receber, eu perco tudo que investi.<br>  <br>  2) Seus filhos, eu n?o sei a idade, podem conseguir melhores oportunidades de trabalho num futuro próximo. Assim sendo, eles poder?o melhorar a situa??o financeira e com isso poderiam iniciar a própria previdencia.<br>  <br>  Tudo isso é válido porém tenho mais dois comentários. Se n?o me engano, pelo código de defesa do consumidor, bancos n?o podem fazer a venda casada de seus produtos, ou seja, se vc foi ao BB e quer previdência, ele n?o pode atrelar isso a um seguro de vida ou qquer outro produto. Outro ponto é que se vc e sua família tiver disciplina para vcs mesmos fazerem sua poupan?a, ou seja, talvez investir religiosamente o valor da contribui??o da previdência privada em um fundo de investimento de baixo risco, no fim, vcs ver?o que essa op??o é a melhor, sem intermediários, os bancos nesses caso.<br>  <br>  Espero ter ajudado de alguma forma.

But being that the person celebrated is your boss, the gift needs to be much more appropriate than enjoyable. Stuff like, wine glass sets, leather bound journals or perhaps a good ornament. Especially because he is a graphic designer, it would be so much appropriate to buy him a leather journal. Avoid things like photo frames and album, because it is can seem quite personal. <br>  Hope all goes well.  :)|`|52a53a34f44258b5354920e7aa40d19daa	If he's a graphic designer, buy him a USB drink cooler.

i3yztRy3aa	There's a couple of things you can do.  You can say, "shipping costs to be determined after auction" that way you can determine how much.  You can guess at a cost, thats what I do.  I overestimate a little bit.  You can also get ebay to calculate a shipping cost based on the weight of the package.  Therefore the cost will always be somewhat accurate depending on the person's zipcode.  Goodluck.|`|ba61e49db406a01601fe046bc7d3ec5eaa	Most people on Ebay just guess, if you over charge a dollar or two no one will complain and try to get the money back. Remember, when people bid they are agreeing to your terms and conditions on the shipping. If your really concerned go to the post office with the shirts and have them weighed, find a box that fits them, and then you can ask how much it would cost to ship them to anywhere in the US via regular mail, priority, etc.. It should cost the same no matter what state your shipping out to. For your own protection its usually worth spending the extra dollar on package tracking as well so you can make sure it gets there and have the evidence to prove it should there be a problem. <br>  <br>  Something else you can try, find a website that sells t-shirts, put 4 of them in your shopping cart and have the website calculate the shipping on the order for you. This should be pretty close to what you will pay to ship your shirts.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|fqEC6d9daa	don't post the ad yet, go down to the post office with one of the shirts packaged as you would send them, and ask how much it would cost to send to anywhere in the US. Do not post international, it's too much hassle. Use the price you are given at the post office. Or look at other people selling t-shirts within the US and charge what they charge. Good luck!
AeuAigvraa	Collection Agencies just keep selling your debt from one company to another.  If they can not collect from you, they will sell it to another company and so on and so on.  If you are accepting responsibility for the debt, then the best thing to do is talk with the new collection agency and not avoid the situation.  Chances are that they will work with you about setting up a payment plan. If you keep avoiding them then not only will they sell the debt to another agency, but they will be collecting money off of the interest.  Best advice I can give is to talk with the agency, set up a payment plan, and get the debt paid off.  Good Luck|`|YR11l7MSaa	Never declare bankrupcty.  This will ruin your credit rating.  My advice is you need to talk to a supervisior and explain your situation at the orginial credit card place and set up payments with them.  However, your problem is that the collection agency is going to continue to call and many different people will call.<br>  I had a massive credit card problem when I was younger and racked up tons of debt not once but twice. I used a credit counseling service but truthfully I think there a waste of time.  I have learned that you don't use your card(s) unless you have the money to pay it back.  Once you miss a payment they will raise your rates to absurd percentages.  Keep making payments and don't use them or any others.  Doesn't seem like you could take out anymore but def. don't.  Use cash!!  Like the other person said pay the dang thing off.  Why are you only paying 100.00 a month; you will never pay it off at that rate and they will keep calling you.<br>  <br>  Here's a website I just found info on avoiding bankruptcy.<br>  <br>  Will filing bankruptcy affect my credit?<br>  <br>  There is no clear answer to this question. Unfortunately, if you are behind on your bills, your credit may already be bad. Bankruptcy will probably not make things any worse. The fact that you filed bankruptcy, if properly explained, may be less damaging than a history of unpaid accounts. <br>  <br>  The fact that you have filed a bankruptcy will appear on your credit record for ten years. But since bankruptcy wipes out your old debts, you are likely to be in a better position to pay your current bills, and you may be able to get new credit. The best way to restore your credit is to obtain new credit and make the payments on the new debt on time.|`|AA10232591	pay the dang bill|`|AA12180631	#1 Bankruptcy will NOT ruin your credit.  If you have already not paid on this for 5 months and it is in collection then you are already headed in that direction anyway.  Don't get me wrong I do not believe that you should file bankruptcy however I disagree with above that it ruins your credit,<br>  You can pay 100% of your debt through the bankruptcy and save some interest.<br>  <br>  If bankruptcy is where you end up to get back on your feet then so  be it.|`|arTWMQdJaa	I have good experience with a debt consolidation company.

laAOnCOHaa	I signed up with them once before, and they never sent me my check. I spent a lot of time filling out surveys, they approved all of my offers, and they owed me about $120, and they never sent it. I sent letters to the contact info they provide, but they constantly sent me e-mails back saying they apologize and it should show up in the next month's cash out. I waited 2 months, and finally quit, so I don't recommend it. I think other people probably have success at that website,  but I will never do it again.<br>  <br>  I signed up with another website called <a href="http://www.treasuretrooper.com/233795" rel="nofollow">http://www.treasuretrooper.com/233795</a><br>  they basically do the same thing, only they are more reliable. Treasuretrooper sends you a check every 15th-20th of each month. You can make a lot of money based off of how much time you spend filling out the cash offers. I've been with them for about 2 months and average about $40 of extra money per week. I don't fill out that many surveys, so I know if you do it more often, you'll make more money.

There is nothing to be concerned about.|`|3d7034f6f80ccb280be8fcf26d641dbbaa	Lol, I think they think you are not buying the property and they are looking for a back up offer.

It is all ok|`|NC0F2bCTaa	they are looking for back up offers in case your offer falls through. get a loan commitment from your lender and put a good deposit down. this shows good faith on your part. Once they agree to your offer they have to honor the contract unless you breach the contract. As a seller I would always look for back up offers because a good number of deals in real estate fall through as late as the date of closing. Also pay attention to the dates on a contract so you don't miss a deadline. you're always better off with a realtor to assist you.|`|fe793b9e1868406561cf076fffdf9733aa	Your purchase agreement contained contingencies.  Common contingencies are:  (1) the home inspection coming out with no major problems, (2) ability for the buyer to obtain financing, (3) buyer sells their house.  <br>  <br>  A contingency is basically a legal "way out" for you the buyer.  <br>  <br>  Realtors can and do sometimes continue to market a property until all the contingencies are removed (i.e. after you have sold your current house, obtained financing, and signed off on the home inspection contingency).  <br>  <br>  If you are really concerned, ask your realtor or the seller's realtor about it.|`|prv0iuNDaa	If the Seller accepted all terms of your offer then they cannot legally back out of the contract. <br>  <br>  There could be a number of reasons why an open house was in progress.  A REALTOR might have advertised the open house for the home prior to the acceptance of your offer and had to follow through with it - or they want to run an open house to find some Buyers for other properties- or advertise themselves as a "great REALTOR" because they already sold this home - or as mentioned before, to maybe get a back-up offer.<br>  <br>  As mentioned before-diligence in removing subjects before they are due to be removed is important.<br>  <br>  Keep in contact with your REALTOR for answers and if you did not use a REALTOR- well then that's a whole other can of worms and this might be a great learning experience.

88b9a22a5f7007c44994119584692c92aa	An investor who is quite credit-worthy has the ability to establish a margin account with a brokerage firm, as opposed to simply a cash account.  This enables the investor to borrow funds from the broker to use in purchasing investments such as stocks, bonds, etc.  Each brokerage firm sets its own guidelines regarding the margin requirements (the percentage of the value of an account, measured by the cash and securities held in the account, that the investor can borrow.  Margin accounts are usually used by experienced investors who stay in touch frequently with their account balances.<br>  <br>  Example:  You deposit $10,000 into a brokerage account qualified as a margin account that allows you to borrow up to 50% of the cost of securities.  This means the broker will allow you to borrow an equivalent amount.  If you buy a stock on margin that costs $20,000 (ignoring commission costs), your $10,000 of cash will be used to pay for half of the cost of the stock.  The other $10,000 is borrowed from the broker, and you pay interest to that firm as long as that debt is outstanding.  If the stock declines in value to $15,000, such that the broker's margin requirement is violated, you now have an account valued at $15,000 with a $10,000 (plus interest) debt.  You will receive a margin call asking you to bring your equity in the account back up to 50%.  Ignoring interest, half of $15,000 is $7,500, and your equity is only $5,000 ($15,000 less $10,000).  That means you must deposit additional cash or other marginable securities in order to maintain the 50% margin requirement.  If the stock increases in value, you might be able to use the appreciation equity to buy still more stock.  It is quite risky to use as much margin borrowing power as is available, unless you are absolutely sure the investments you buy on margin will increase in value.|`|4DAVj1sIaa	Buying on margin is borrowing money from a broker to purchase stock. <br>  Margin increases your buying power. <br>  An initial investment of at least $2,000 is required (minimum margin). <br>  You can borrow up to 50% of the purchase price of a stock (initial margin). <br>  You are required to keep a minimum amount of equity in your margin account that can range from 25% - 40% (maintenance margin). <br>  Marginable securities act as collateral for the loan. <br>  Like any loan, you have to pay interest on the amount you borrow. <br>  Not all stocks qualify to be bought on margin. <br>  You must read the margin agreement and understand its implications. <br>  If the equity in your account falls below the maintenance margin, the brokerage will issue a margin call. <br>  Margin calls can result in you having to liquidate stocks or add more cash to the account. <br>  Brokers may be able to sell your securities without consulting you. <br>  Margin means leverage. <br>  The advantage of margin is that if you pick right, you win big. <br>  The downside of margin is that you can lose more money than you originally invested. <br>  Buying on margin is definitely not for everybody. <br>  Margin trading is extremely risky.

If this is the only one you have built, or you build so infrequently that your activity cannot be considered a business either in combination with your self employmnent status (you didn't say what you do), or separate and apart from that status, you may be able to treat it as an investment sale.  If it is a capital asset to you (investment), it goes on Schedule D.  If it was ever used for rental, it goes on Form 4797.  If it was part of a business, it should be either with your own Schedule C or a separate Schedule C.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AthgFKwu1Wv9f8Xo2kdfsUOZxQt.?qid=20070411151316AAf03dg">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|AA10275815	If you sold the house in 2006 you should report it in your 2006 return.|`|ffba73b8c443d95894c011d2595ae57daa	You pay taxes on the capital gain.

OSmPcXT5aa	Yeh sure - u can come to mine & use my black mamba for free! Cant send it as its attatched but please have a go!!
OSmPcXT5aa	Yes but maybe not that easily (its dependant on what type of default, with whom, the amount, how long for etc...)! You may need to go to an adverse lender if this is the case (a lender that takes more risk but charges a higher interest rate).<br>  <br>  Also when using a 100% mtg, remember that you should only get a max 3.5x your income from the reputable lenders. If you are offord more be careful! you could run the risk of not being able to afford your payments.<br>  <br>  Go to a local estate agents (Countrywide Group are normally ok) & have a FREE of charge agreement in principle done - try to use someone who is independant or semi independant as they have more mtgs to offer. It should only take an hour & you will have a solid offer of borrowing for the next 3 - 6 months (ish). You will then know exactly how much you are able to borrow & afford! You will then have a better idea of what to look for when searching property or wether you shd stay & build a deposit?!<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|f0423c049434af188b8aae9a68343013aa	That depends on how long ago the default was. Was it a big default - such as an account going to collections? Or was it just a late payment? <br>  If it was a collection account, it must be satisfied or the lender will not loan you the money for the house.<br>  If it was just a late payment, then it should be at least a year old (with no other defaults since). They usually want to see a solid year of on-time payments. <br>  If you defaulted something important like a student loan, the same rule applies. You must get current and stay current for a year...lenders tend to furrow their brows more when they see you default on that as opposed to a cc. <br>  Good luck!|`|3Ol7aut2aa	You should be able to; you really need to get a good loan officer working for you who should be able to get you into a program that's right for you.

The REAL, LEGITIMATE site was copied and had a few minor changes made to it and is being passed off at the LEGIT site and scamming people left and right!!!  So you have to be VERY careful!!!!  Even though the site LOOKS, ACTS and "FEELS" legit -- doesn't mean it really is a legit site!!!<br>  <br>  Example: www.cargo-express.co.uk -- The REAL site; www.cargoexp.info -- The FAKE site!!  Check them out and see for yourself!!!
jDuzBHBaaa	A couple of questions for you: (your #2)Are your auctions set up for PayPal direct payment??  If not, you have to send an invoice to the "winner" of your auction.  If you wait until you're paid and take your item to the Post Office to ship, how do you know how much to charge for shipping???  Or do you ship your item for free???  Why pack the item at the Post Office???  That should already have been done BEFORE taking the package to the Post office!<br>  <br>  Now on to your list: #1 fine, #2 See my first question above; #3 You will receive a payment receipt from PayPal; #s 4, 5,6 and 7 -- Why wait until the end for these -- this should have been done prior to bringing the package to the Post Office. #8 Once the item is paid for is when I would leave my feedback for the Buyer.  There are a lot of Buyers who never leave feedback!!<br>  <br>  Your additional questions - You seem to be contradicting yourself.  Here you want to know how to determine the size of the envelope, yet at the beginning, you say you take the item to the Post Office and pack it there!!  For your second additional question -- if you ship Priority Mail, you can get Priority Mail boxes and envelopes free of charge from the USPS site.  You can also print out shipping labels directly from PayPal and you will have a copy of the receipt.  If you ship via other methods, you can go to an office supply store such as Staples and purchase Tyvek envelopes (the best for shipping, they're tough!!) or padded envelopes, depending on what you sell and ship.<br>  <br>  Postal Scales are relatively inexpensive, good suggestion is to purchase one.  Depending on what you sell, that will determne up to what weight the Postal Scale should be.  You can either pre-package your item(s) on auction, weigh them,  mark down the weight, this way when the item is "won" you can go onto the USPS site, pop in the weight, your zip code, the Buyers zip code and find out the shipping cost.  Also, remember to include insurance (if you insure your packages) and Delivery Confirmation cost (if shipping other than Priority -- it's free when you print a label Priority online).  That way when you send your invoice (if you're not set up for direct payment) you will know the total shipping costs.  If you use a "flat rate" for your shipping, you should weigh your item (if you don't want to pre-package) and add up to 3 ounces to that weight to compensate for the envelope, label, tape (this will give you a good "ballpark" gesstimate on shipping cost.  If you're shipping in a box, add up to 5 ounces to the items weight.  If you wind up overcgarhing for shipping and they have paid -- you could always refund the "overage" paid.  <br>  <br>  Even if you're a "casual" Seller, you should invent in a Postal Scale -- why should the shipping costs come out of your "pocket"!!!???|`|AA10477580	Very good organization.

jDuzBHBaaa	If this place is like the others 1- you pay your fee, they send you a book on how to "market yourself" -- YOU have to go and contact companies listed in their book  for a data entry job -- 2- they MIGHT give you a "money back quarantee" BUT there's a HUGE catch to that!!!  You have to send them about 5 reject letters from the companies you've contacted from their book  as proof -- BTW -- those companies DO NOT respond!!!  So you are out  money and they are laughing all the way to the bank with the money they've gotten from you!!!  You can do all that "leg work" for free, just by writing a well thought out, well planned letter to companies in your local area describing your service, pricing, turn-around (leadtime) time, etc...!!!<br>  <br>  About 25 years ago I fell for that!!  It wasn't data entry, it was another "field"!!!  All they did was send me a book with names of companies in it that I had to contact regarding their "open position"!!  THE ONLY way I could get my money back (from their "money back guarantee") was to provide them with FIVE "reject letters"!!  Guess what???  Yup, NONE of the companies would send one!!  Therefore -- yup again, I was out all that money!!!<br>  <br>  Also, WATCH OUT for those "assemble items at home" scams!!!  You ONLY get paid for the items they APPROVE -- in other words, are done properly -- and they RARELY approve ALL the items you have returned to them assembled!!!  BUT they were actually salable, they DID sell them BUT you were told that they were rejected so they didn't have to pay you for them!!<br>  <br>  Envelope stuffing is another popular scam!!!  Some companies tell you, YOU have to supply the envelopes, stamps AND buy a mailing list from them!!!  9 times out of 10, 9 out of 10 envelopes will come back "undeliverable", so you're out all that money!!!  Then there are the ones that suppliy everything BUT you ONLY get paid when someone buys their product as a result of your mailing -- I believe their fliers/advertizing is coded!!!|`|UyRlB79oaa	I agree, don't ever pay an upfront fee.

jDuzBHBaaa	Basically, it seems you have the equipment necessary.  You need a transcription machine (cassette player -- most likely a mini-cassette player, which is the most popular size) with foot pedal that allows you to back up and go forward, headphones, computer, printer and paper.  From what you've written, it looks as though you have almost all the necessary equipment except for the mini-cassette player and printer.  The transcription unit comes with all components necessary, seems, to me, you are buying each piece individually!!!  Would, more than likely, have been more cost efficient for you to have bought the complete transcription unit!!!  If you purchased the foot pedal and headphone separately, see if you can return them after checking online for stores that sell transcription units (i.e. Staples).

O primeiro agente arrecadador do PIS foi a Caixa Econ?mica Federal. Inicialmente havia 4 (quatro) modalidades de cobran?a do PIS:<br>  <br>  PIS sobre Faturamento (definido posteriormente pelo CMN como as Receitas Brutas definidas pela legisla??o do Imposto de Renda). <br>  PIS sobre Presta??o de Servi?os (que n?o era considerado Faturamento, embora houvesse a duplicata de servi?os). <br>  PIS Repique (que era calculado com base no imposto de renda, devido também pelos prestadores de servi?o). <br>  PIS sobre folha de pagamentos (para as entidades sem fins lucrativos mas que eram empregadoras).O Programa de Integra??o Social, mais conhecido como PIS, é uma contribui??o social de natureza tributária, devida pelas pessoas jurídicas, com objetivo de financiar o pagamento do seguro desemprego e do abono para os trabalhadores que ganham até dois salários mínimos.|`|3bc21fcab38086e51aa177980f9ae97aaa	5 anos de inscri??o e ganhar menos de dois salários míimos e ter sido empregada em 2006 pelo menos dois meses. este ultimo detalhe eu nao sei direito mas acho que é isso...se acha que tem direio vá a ua agencia da cef pis ou bb pasep e leve sua carteira profissional e pe?a para verificarem.<br>  abs|`|b166d8d3427f25adf8f3b431e809215faa	Quem tem direito ao PIS/Pasep?<br>  <br>  O Programa de Integra??o Social (PIS) e o Programa de Forma??o do Patrim?nio do Servidor Público (Pasep) eram fundos formados por contribui??es mensais feitas pelas empresas, calculadas sobre os seus faturamentos. Estes recursos eram destinados ao desenvolvimento social e à melhoria da vida do trabalhador. <br>  <br>  Em 1988, o programa foi substituído pelo Abono Salarial. Mas como o dinheiro ficava depositado no fundo, uma espécie de poupan?a, os trabalhadores cadastrados podem retirar a quantia que lhe pertence. O saque pode ser feito pelo valor total ou, no caso do trabalhador na ativa, pelo rendimento do total da quota. <br>  <br>  Abono do PIS / Pasep <br>  <br>  <br>  Quem tem direito a receber as quotas do PIS/Pasep? <br>  Quem foi cadastrado no PIS até 4 de outubro de 1988, recebeu quotas de participa??o, e encontra-se nas situa??es abaixo, pode ter saldo a receber. O saque das quotas pode ser solicitado a qualquer momento, somente nas agências da Caixa, pelos seguintes motivos: <br>  <br>  Aposentadoria; <br>  Reforma militar; <br>  Invalidez permanente; <br>  Transferência de militar para a reserva remunerada; <br>  Portador do vírus HIV(AIDS/SIDA); <br>  Neoplasia maligna (cancer) do titular ou de seus dependentes; <br>  Morte do trabalhador; <br>  Benefício assistencial a idosos e deficientes. <br>  <br>  O pagamento pode ser realizado, em casos excepcionais, em até cinco dias úteis após a solicita??o. A pessoa cadastrada receberá a atualiza??o monetária e a parcela de rendimentos do PIS n?o retirada no correspondente período de pagamento. <br>  <br>  A atualiza??o do saldo de quotas é efetuada anualmente, ao término do exercício financeiro (1 de julho a 30 de junho do ano seguinte), com base nos índices estabelecidos pelo Conselho Diretor do Fundo de Participa??o PIS/Pasep.<br>  <br>  <br>  Quem come?ou a trabalhar depois de 1989 tem direito a receber as quotas?<br>  N?o. Só os trabalhadores cadastrados até 04/10/1988. <br>  <br>  Existe prazo para a retirada da quota do PIS?<br>  N?o. O saque é feito a qualquer tempo, desde que comprovado  o direito. <br>  <br>  Quem tem direito a receber os rendimentos das quotas do PIS/Pasep?<br>  Todo trabalhador cadastrado no PIS, e que tem saldo de quotas, tem direito aos rendimentos anuais do PIS. Esses rendimentos correspondem aos juros de 3% ao ano, mais o resultado líquido adicional (RLA). <br>  <br>  O dinheiro pode ser retirado em qualquer agência da Caixa.

Again, if the first step is completed successfully, the success of the third step is quite assured. Hence, assuming the success of the first step, the likelihood of raising $30,000 in one year is highly probable.|`|AA11988604	I would buy a house that is in disrepair, but needs mostly cosmetics, fix it up and sell it.

F66hnqlIaa	Well the reason AIG got $85 billion bucks is because the government thought about what would happen if AIG didn't exist, what would happen is that there would be a global collapse of the financial market.  AIG is so deep in many things in business I wouldn't be surprised to know that the core of the earth is owned by AIG.<br>  <br>  Like many financial companies AIG invested in home mortgages, unfortunately when the banks failed, like Washington Mutual, Indy Mac, they got stuck with investments that they where going to lose money on. Other factors like world economy dragged the company down as well, unable to retain business, bad investments etc. The CEO at the time was at first Martin J. Sullivan, who ended up resigning due to the falling of AIG stock. Than comes Willumsted, he inherited a company that was rotting and than the whole thing blew up in his face.  Willumsted didn't cause this problem at all, he was a good CEO for his short period and ended up not taking his bonus of $22 million due to the failure of AIG.<br>  Also there are some executives that used AIG's good name to take money and invested in stuff that wouldn't make money at all, eventually they got caught and will be prosecuted to the extent of the law.<br>  <br>  I'm sure you heard about the spa retreat a few weeks back.  This was planned months ahead before the fall of AIG,  Like many companies AIG has to compete with other insurance company for business, so when brokers, agents who sell AIG insurance and achieve a certain amount of sales they are treated to a retreat from AIG, just like when sales people take you out to dinner, to get that business. It was just bad timing and the press didn't tell you that it was business purposes. That fox hunting trip in Europe, those where idiots. Apparently they didn't know what was going on with the market.<br>  <br>  You have every right to be mad, but I could make the argument that the person who earns $40,000 a year purchases a home that's worth $400,000.  Some where those number don't seem right and they can't afford the home no longer. I can argue that it's the banks fault, the homeowners fault for not thinking clearly and not reading what ARM loans are about. Banks failed because the homes they foreclosed on are no longer worth $400,000, more like worth $250,000.  Who will cover the difference? They would have to, and it will take years to fix.<br>  <br>  The government will do something eventually but they got to interview a lot of people to figure what went wrong. But at the end the government had to save AIG, if they didn't the world might as well blow itself up, thats how big AIG was. |`|e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	NOBODY is in charge of them.  Which is why it was dumb and irresponsible of our elected politicians to give them all this money, with no strings attached.<br>  <br>  Have you even SEEN What the plans are for this money?  NOT what we were told it would be, but hey, no strings attached means, they can just use it to give bonuses to the CEO's if they want to. <br>  <br>  BLAME YOUR CONGRESSMEN.|`|AA10409800	So, you type in ALL CAPS and rant about current events, though you really have no clue what you're talking about.<br>  <br>  You must be one of those people who only skim the headlines without reading the actual story.|`|404a872608bbc05db26c07299e3c75bdaa	...because they can't.  The Securities and Exchange Commision is responsible for making sure they operate within the law.  AIG isn't doing anything in particular that is illegal, but they are bankrupting the company and we as taxpayers are bailing them out.  We are told it is beneficial for everybody to save financial institutions because the economy will suffer for the forseeable future if we don't.  My opinion is that nobody feels vindicated because a few politicians wagged their finger at these guys and yelled at them in a public forum.  Basically, we all lose here because no lessons were learned and the institution will repeat the mistakes given another chance.  This is all about GREED. 
oWLe7TNIaa	Below 600?  You probably won't qualify through most lenders.  I work for a lender and our minium FICO is 640 with a downpayment of 20%.<br>  <br>  You want to put at least 20% ($36,000) down whether or not you have poor or excellent credit.  This has always been the rule of thumb when you buy a house.  It's only been the last 5 years or so that people have been buying houses without a good down payment- and look where it's got us- with a destroyed economy and house values plummeting.<br>  <br>  If you only put $10K down and the value falls you'll owe more than the home is worth.  That is a situation you want to avoid at all costs.  Also make sure you have at least 6-12 months of living expenses in savings on top of the down payment before you buy to protect yourself from troubles. .|`|AA11173563	that depends on how far below 600 you are. 580 and above maybe as little as 3% FHA 3.5% after 1/1/09 but just making a statement like that with out more info gets you no good answers.<br>  I am a mortgage banker in TN & KY|`|8yQYmxVOaa	In today's market you will not be able to get a loan, next question is how many other debts do you have in comparison to your income, in other words it is credit score and affordability. Would take a few years and clean up your credit, or save up 180K for the home|`|AA10409800	Depends on the mortgage company. Because of the current mortgage crisis, it's a little harder than before.  Thank the idiots who got in over their head for that.<br>  <br>  What may end up happening (if you get approved) is that they'll make you pay some sort of additional sum as a sort of penalty (as much as $5000 or more is not uncommon).<br>  <br>  And you CAN get approval with a credit rating of 600 or below.|`|AA10526402	It will be difficult in this market no matter how much you save up, but I would plan on saving at least 20% (so $36,000) plus some money for closing costs; so figure you will need $40,000.  You might have better luck going to a small local bank or credit union since they would have been hit less by the current housing troubles.  Good luck.|`|e9YFTyzZaa	It MAY be different now but, it used to be a 40% Down payment and you don't have to Qualify!<br>  40% of that would be, $72,000.|`|MtC3CWZraa	100%<br>  <br>  You're not going to get financing with a 600 credit score right now. |`|LgJT2Rnfaa	depending on how low your credit scores are below 600 you may or may not be able to get a loan.  Also it depends on why your credit scores are low.  If you have a large downpayment you will be more likely to get approved because the bank will lower its risk in the deal.  If you would like to see if you can get approved send me an email|`|I6vMxEU9aa	Standard down payments are 20%. However, I'd talk to your Realtor or financier to see what kind of rate you can get. Instead of asking how much down payment will you need, you really should look at your finances and say, how much CAN I put down, and how much can I afford for a monthly payment. You don't want to dig yourself into a deeper hole credit-wise than you have now.|`|1w5LQiIoaa	These days, you can expect 25% or more, depending on your income.<br>  <br>  Any lender that requires less of someone with 600 should be very carefully scrutinized as there may be very devious pitfalls buried in the contract.|`|lQWRyaWXaa	You will need 3% or $5,400.00 down to qualify for FHA. It should be noted that you can get approved down to a 500 mid score in some cases on a manual underwrite.<br>  Feel free to contact me if you need help.|`|fs46cgxUaa	Right now with the economy in this crisis, you probably can if you're willing to put down a LARGE downpayment, like 30%.
703bfa269363d7ef4f6cad2bb1f3435caa	Ask yourself,  if you can spend,  why can not you save. It is your habit. Just developed over a period of time and that habit has taken<br>  over your charge. Instead of controlling your habits you allow your habits to control you.<br>  <br>  It is possible to save some amount  if you so desire.<br>  It is initially hard, but in long run it helps. When thought of shopping comes in your mind go to bank and deposit that amount in your savings bank account. If this is not possible ask your employer to put aside such savings in your account giving standing instruction on your pay day.<br>  <br>  Any thing is possible if so sincerely desire and if we are honest in our efforts.|`|5jgpikrtaa	Try buying the basic brands at the supermarket. <br>  <br>  Buying your bread and meat when it is cheaper on certain days, or find a cood butcher who sells value packs. <br>  <br>  Don't take your cashcard with you only take a amount of cash with you when you go out for example $50. <br>  <br>  Try a bank account such as a christmas fund one where you can't make any withdrawls unless its an emergency. <br>  <br>  |`|pndTZcUyaa	Take care of yourself.

In the back of your mind you still know it's there, but you're less tempted to spend it if it isn't in your pocket.|`|CL9zXIA7aa	Very simply you need to spend less than you earn. If you're not saving money now that means earning more or spending less. Get a second part time job and more carefully watch your spending and you will save money.

U7nj9Kg4aa	depends on the fashions I suppose.  IF it's high end designer stuff, right now probalby wouldn't be the best time to start up since money is tightening up.  If it's low ever cheap clothing then sure it would be a good time to start up.<br>  <br>  Either way, make sur that you have a very solid business plan and a way of funding your business.  IF times get tight during this credit crunch it will be tough for you to get a loan to cover expenses.|`|0hgTGSZbaa	This is the time to start from the bottom up.|`|6f8n7ntlaa	I have the same question in my head.  I want to start clothing line someday, right now I am working as an assistant to a clothing designer.  what I can tell you from how things are going with our business is: sales from our rep in LA is really slow  but also because shes a "young designer", and thats what you and I will hopefully be, its harder for buyers to purchase dresses etc that are marked high for wholesale price. we are working with manufactures in china, and its much cheaper than hiring a pattern maker and seamstress here in US, but it is still hard to bring the prices down when they give you a quote of each design, since we havent had a longterm business relationship yet they are charging higher than we'd like. you probably know about wholesaling, when you send your samples to your rep, you put wholesale price on them for buyers and ushually the designer doubles or triples what they paid for. so you can see how it gets difficult with prices if the labor and materials were high price.  negotiate!<br>  I hope i didn't confuse you...  I love this industry but i agree that this poor economic present is disencouraging when opening small business.  I would recommend having another job that funds your line, because of so many things you have to pay for: labor, commission to reps, fabric/embellishments, fabric dying or pleating, pattern making, shipping costs, business tax etc.<br>  So I hope I helped you.  I hope people will be buying into fashion, but i know with this economy you have to have a great product that will attract the customer. so good luck! and same to me!<br>  contact me if you still would like to talk: cottuncande@yahoo.com|`|AA10409800	I think you answered your own question.
