20090505173837AAPO40P	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Collection on Rent...............?	I rented a house with 3 other people last year. Two of the people moved out and someone else took their place. We did not make them sign the lease because then they would have to pay another deposit. Well I was the only one to pay the last month's rent. So we owed $600. Nothing had been said about it until today, I got a phone call from a collection agency saying if we didn't pay it by Friday they would freeze our social security numbers. Is that legal? Also, since 2 people who lived there were not on the lease, they say it's not their responsibility to pay. We had a verbal agreement that they would pay rent until the lease was up. What can I do about it? I don't feel that I should pay their rent for them. I am not their mom, they are all adults. I really don't want my credit to be hurt though. I am so confused.. any advice?
20090307160854AAJXB8Z	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	I need help with a co-worker?	I work with this girl and I DO NOT get along with her. Her communication skills are not good. She acts like she is the manager when for sure she is not. No too friendly. Then when I talk to other co-workers about stuff, she feels left out and she will start crying. ( we are not talking about her) If things do not go her way, she is upset and she feels that she has to do everything because if she does not do it, it is not done correctly. I do not want to say where I work but it is a place where you deal with lots of customers. I just kinda of ignore her. Hmmmmmm....what to do? What do you think?
20090307160826AA4YU8Z	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Florida - husband files BK without wife?	i have a judgement against former landlord for absconding with our security deposit.       took them to court, they didnt show up, we win default judgement.      the husband is threatening to file ch 7, however, the wife cannot (she had a chapter 7 4 years ago), they are both ineligible for a ch 13 (too much secured debt)       if HE files, can i still collect from the wife?      (they may not even file, it might just be a useless threat).       second point.. florida statute says that security deposits must be held in a bank account on our behalf, and they cannot use it or co-mingle it with personal funds unless authorized to use it , which they arent, the judgement poves that) so.... if he DOES file BK, can i file a police complaint?        in my opinion, its like breaking into our house, stealing $2000, and filing BK not to give it back.

20090307120503AALyyf2	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	Should I be honest about why I left my last job?	I left my last job because I needed to start therapy and my employer would not work with me on a schedule change. I didn't tell him that I needed to start therapy and don't feel as though I should have. I did however tell him that I was experiencing a serious personal problem but he didn't seem concerned at all. A few weeks after that I quit with the reason that I needed to focus more on schoolwork. 4 months later I was offered a job at an ice cream shop (a step down, but I'm willing to do whatever it takes to support my family in these times) and I'm worried about what I should say about why I left my last job. If I tell her that I needed to focus more on school, I don't want to give her the impression that it will happen again. Especially since she has already told me she's had several people quit after she paid for training. How should I handle this professionally?

20090307120722AAOZ3Bd	Business & Finance;Credit	A pending judgment against me - Is there anything I can do?	When I was young and not very bright I bought a brand new off the lot car. About 3 weeks into my purchase I was rear-ended and hurt bad enough that I couldn't work. I ended up loosing the car, house, everything.. Okay fine. I go on with my life for a while not able to get any credit for obvious reasons. After about 5 years, the company writes it off and it disappears from my credit report. I have been building my credit up and it isn't that bad now. Well, a collection agency has bought my delinquent loan from 9 years ago and decided it was time for me to pay. I am pretty maxed out right now, but I have enough money to pay my bills each month and have a little left over. The company that purchased my loan wants the amount owed on the car, plus 17% interest on it for the past 9 years.  Is my only option bankruptcy? I mean I hate to do that, but I can't tack on another 600.00 a month bill. I know I made mistakes but this will pretty much finish me.      I got a lawyer, he hasn't been too much help...      The statute of limitations for Iowa is 10 years so it isn't up yet...         I have come down to the conclusion that one of three things are going to happen:       1.) they stick me with the $20,000 bill and I file bankruptcy. Or I drag it out, skimping on bills and eventually owe everyone.      2.) Perhaps they will realize that they are not going to get anything if I file bankruptcy so they lower the interest and try to work this out...      3.) By some miracle the judge or whomever just writes this off. I don't know maybe I can apply for a bail-out.      Once again, is there anything I can do to keep my credit on the right track.

20090227085559AAoWDub	Business & Finance;Other - Business & Finance	Question about receiving unemployment benefits and going to school at night.?	I was just wondering if anyone has ever been through my situation and what the outcome was. I was laid off of my warehouse job last November and I began receiving unemployment soon after. In January of this year since I was unemployed, I decided to enroll in school part time nights. When I did that, unemployment denied me because they said I have to be available around the clock and that me going to school will interfere. I can understand where they are coming from, but it's a shame that a person can't even try to better themselves. They said that the type of school that I'm going to was not "approved" by them. So in other words if I were to go to an approved school it would be ok. What I want to know is should I request an appeal hearing or not. The only thing I can do is tell them that I am willing to change my school hours or even quit to be available if something comes along. Since the rules are black and white to them, do you think I should even bother?  Also everyone is pissed at me because I was honest and told unemployment that I was going to school and they said I should've lied. So I'm trying to be honest, better myself and I end up getting screwed.

He is a cook on a ship, its a month at a time, and I have about ￡200 something pound in my account, not a lot really. If I go away with him I will be getting like a few thousand a month. The only things that are worrying me about this is that i'll become like my dad and i'd rather not. I have become really close with a few people on here, and I won't get to see them, the same goes for my real life friends.       When my dad comes home, he gets 3/4 or four days at home and all he does is go in pub, and sleep. That's it, he doesn't spend the money he works for, it just goes on bills, food etc. He doesn't have much of a life. I don't want to become like him, he's been doing this job since he was in his early 20s.       The other thing is that I have worked everyday on my birthday since I was 17. I didn't do anything for my 17th birthday, my 18th, or my 19th. If I go away I won't be able to do anything for my 20th either.       thank you

I know I have a clear background, and have no drugs in my system. They stated they would not start the check until my drug test came back clear, and two days afterward, they contacted my current employer, so I suppose it wasnt an issue, not that I thought it would be. It was one week and three days ago, the interview. They said it could take up to two weeks for the check, but would it be bad to call them and check and see how the progress is? I really REALLY want this job.   Opinions? Call today? Call Monday? Just wait it out? I don't want to seem desperate... but it is honestly killing me. As Tom Petty so accurately asserted... The waiting is the hardest part.

I don't have any student loans and have a car that's paid off but will probably be buying a better used car (nothing too expensive). I have absolutely no debt (credit card, etc).       I'm trying to figure out how much I'll be able to spend on a house. I googled it and one link said 3x salary with debt or 4x with little or no debt. Could I actually afford a $120,000 house? I found one that I love and the monthly payments would be around $521. My monthly salary will be about $2,500. Is that too much to be spending? I'd like my own home but would it be better to just get a condo (which would be slightly more affordable)?      Also, I may be making more than $30,000 but I'm not sure what my starting salary will be. After 15 years my salary will be at least $50,000 and I plan on buying another permanent house after my first starter home.       Any advice and personal stories would be great. I just don't want to have to pay rent in an apartment and I'd rather not get a condo but I will if I have to. And, of course, I will talk to the bank about what loan I can get but I'm just trying to get ideas now.

20090307162643AA1xtYZ	Business & Finance;Small Business	Can I hire people for a small, temporary job without the goverment being involved (read more for details)?	I'm planning on having a small farming business on my 1 acre land.  But I have a primary job working for a construction company and I don't have enough time to fully work on my farming business.      I was wondering if I could hire a few individuals (only about two or three really) to help me on the field.  I'm growing strawberries so the harvest will probably only last about a month or so.  Then when I'm done I will sell the strawberries to a friend of mines who will then re-sell them in public at a higher price for his own gain.        Alright, now when I mean hiring them without the government being inolved, I'm trying to ask if i could hire them without the whole working check with government taxes and insurance thing.  If possible I would like to simply pay them in cash to make it easier on me and them (by the way, I already know someone who would like to work for me and he agreed with my idea saying it seems much easier this way since the gov. doesn't get a percentage of his income).  Of course, I will pay them fairly by giving them $8.50 an hour, which meets the minimum wage requirements (in fact it's 50 cents higher than minimum wage).      So is this possible?

When my partner and i moved into our little two bed terraced house we compared dual fuel companies according to all comparison sites british gas the energy 6 deal would be best for us. We signed up on the 1st October and handed over all our details and meter readings. Yet we didn't actually start getting supplied until mid December as they were supplying the completely wrong address after telling them 5 or 6 times that was the wrong address. We couldn't and still cant actually enter meter readings online as in the terms & cond of energy 6 deals as it wont let us register for our address.       Now to top it off we have been sent a bill for ￡166.09 which is very very steep for the amount the Gas which is used (20/12/08) - (18/2/09) We have a combi boiler which is barely used, and we are both out the house  the majority of time my partner is at Uni full time, and works evenings and most weekends.  I work near enough full time including weekends. We never really use the heating so it seems very high. We have a metric meter and it has been read as a metric unit.       Again the electric we feel has been over charged We are just wondering if any one else has had issues with billing from them or feels they have been unfairly charged and how they resolved it?       Thanks

20090307161237AA2kRL2	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	I've just been fired from my job as a receptionist / office assistant in a psychology firm.?	I was there for 3 months and didn't pass the probationary period.  I am in my 30's and have been temping as an Admin Assistant for the past 5.  I thought this job would be good as it is close to where I live, like 5 minutes walk away.      The reasons the owner/ senior clinical psychologist gave me were:   (A) Pleased with my admin / business skills - but felt my 'front-line' skills weren't up to scratch.   (B) Other psychologists (there were 5) felt that they were 'walking on eggshells' when speaking to me (they are not employees by the way, they actually all pay to rent office space and admin duties, although they were work for the same company, so it's kind of like owning their own business.  I find this comment remarkable as I was dealing with a lot of angry, stressed out people.  Also, I picked up and used efficiently "ZEDMED", & was given only a week's worth of training by my predecessor, who left due to family reasons.  I feel the squinty-eyed, old guy who owns the company had very bad management skills, although I can take what he says on board.   C) He stated that there were some complaints during the past 3 months.      Obviously, I feel like **** right now, as I have bills to pay.  I know I have a good typing speed (78 wpm), have Word, Excel, Publisher, Power Point but, what can I say re: this job?      Two years ago, I wanted to spend more time with my daughter, so I worked part-time as a retail Assistant at David Jones & only left because the pay is not good, so how can my front-line skills be bad?        I will admit to feeling frustrated in my job at times, but that was due to the lack of support ie - no other person to ask questions to a lot of the time & discrepancies re: MediCare bulk billing (they bulk billed people who had a health care concession card), etc.  Last week, a rather rude customer accused me of not greeting them when they entered the waiting room, although I was on the phone at the time, using a headset and I did turn around & say 'hello' to them.      Any advice would be appreciated.

I work for an employment agency, and one of their clients is a major telecom company. I work in the finance department for that telecom company, where I restore service, take payments and process payment arrangements for customers.       A new requirement they have now is, while assisting customers, listen to what's going on in the background, and proceed to start up a conversation that way. In other words, we are required to get into the business of each and every customer.       My problem is that I don't think it's professional or respectful to initiate a personal conversation unless the customer takes the first step.       I don't understand the purpose, really. Isn't this considered an invasion of privacy? If a customer calls and I start asking them about what's going on in their households?      Also, most of the time, customers are in a hurry and just want to make a payment or restore their service.
