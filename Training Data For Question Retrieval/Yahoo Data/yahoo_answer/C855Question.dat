20090205165744AA3nEO6	Business & Finance;Small Business	What would you do with this employee situation?	One of our longtime employees leaves for 3 months every winter and our normal afternoon guy then takes his morning shifts while he is gone. The agreement has always been when he comes back, he gets his mornings back and then the other guy gets his afternoons back.   (normally i fill in the gaps - im one of the owners)   Well one of our old employees who had quit 2 months ago, comes back temporarily and says he needs a job just until feb. when hes got another one lined up. That works out perfect for us so we agree and he takes the afternoons that are now vacant.    Later on, this temp employee finds out his job doesnt start until may. We told him that when longtime employee comes back from winter break that the schedule has to go back to normal (therefore cutting him down to 2 shifts instead of 4).       Does this "temp" employee really have a right to be mad?    I mean, who gets priority? the guy who plans on working for us for the long haul or the person who is using this job as a filler until their "real" job starts?      because the filler dude is pissed at me. But honestly, why should he get priority when hes leaving us?    AM I WRONG?

I am still working for my boss. I tried to open my own business onced, but it was too difficult to work for myself and my current company at the same time. Working for 6 months on two jobs at the same time almost killed me. Comming back home from the second job at 2-3am and going back to another one by 9am was not a lot of fun. So, after 6 month, I knew that working on my own by that time, I wouldn't be able to support my family, thow I desided to just keep working for my boss and dedicate more time to my family. Now, year later, I feel like I could make much more money and I would enjoy more by having my own business. Custom Audio Video installation is a grate business, but it feels like I am ready to do anything as long as it is mine.

So, I have the expreiance and I have the drive it takes to work towards growing a small business.  My question is how can I get steady business coming in?

I have a harassment lawsuit against my employer and it was recently dismissed because of a filing error on my part. Now the clerk of court has sent me a letter asking me and the opposing attorneys to present discovery to each other. I'm representing myself and the attorneys for them really jerked me around. The amount I'm asking for is miniscule and lawyers are asking more than that to represent me. Anyway, does anyone know of free online advice to help me?

20061003173418AA5OKgN	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	I need help from the folks out there who Approve Mortgage Loans?	I need some advice desparately.  I am trying to get financed for a loan and am running into a problem and am not sure if I am dealing with people who don't know what they are doing.  I purchased a house in 2000.  In 2003 my mortgage company (Bank A) sold my loan to another bank (Bank B).  Bank B had my loan until 2005 - I sold the house.  The finance company that is looking to fiinance me now (Bank C) is asking Bank B to provide them with three years of pay history and are expecting Bank B to give them Bank A's information.  Well, Bank B won't give it to Bank C, but Bank A no longer exists.  This is holding up the approval for my loan, so my questions are (1) do banks expect all banks to divulge other bank's information like this and is is normal practice (2) why would this hold up my approval everything else is a go (3) should I be looking for another bank or is there validity to what Bank C is doing.   Anyone know how this works?

Sería bueno, en mi opinión, como signo de cooperación internacional, unidad, integración regional y para sentir que todos estamos haciendo fuerza para el mismo lado. Digo esto porque por ejemplo en Europa se aplicó en muchos mas paises y fue muy positivo. Dejen su opinión. Si están de acuerdo ?cómo debería llamarse? las monedas de Uruguay y Argentina se llaman pesos, la de Brasil es el Real, la de Paraguay es el Guaraní y la de Venezuela el Bolívar, creo. Pero creo que debería ser como en Europa, con un nombre distinto a todas las monedas ya existentes y que simbolice a Suramérica, no a un solo país.

Angelo recently completed his residency in internal medicine and has decided to open his own practice. In interviewing potential office assistants, Angelo discovered that the best candidate types 25 words per minute. Thanks to an excellent typing course in high school and lots of practice writing for his college newspaper, Angelo can type 50 words per minute himself. Assume the current wage for office assistants is $10 per hour and that doctors can see four patients per hour. Also assume the office assistant has neither the knowledge nor the license necessary to treat patients.                           3.3.

If I file again, will I be penalized or arrested? for tax fraud or something like that. Sorry, I don't know much of this stuff. I got people that do my taxes for me. Thank you.

When I was getting ready to file them 'for real' yesterday, I came across that question and since we don't have any mortgage loans, I just picked the standard deduction, and all of a sudden, to my surprise, the 1600 jumped up to 4400!! What a big difference! So is this normal? How come my husband never got that question on turbotax and I did get the question on FreeTaxUSA? Did I (or him) do something wrong? Is it normal to get that big of an amount for a family with 1 child and VERY low income? We didn't expect to get more than 2000, so we are in a bit of denial.

Although all my state taxes were deducted by my employer, I did not reported them last year because I could not find my health care form before the deadline. In Massachusetts we are required to have health care insurance. It's been a year. What will happen if I dont report them and report this years? How can I report them now?

20090203055941AApK1Q6	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	Unemployment PA owes me money, Please help!..?	I opened my case but owed unemployment. I went and paid off what was owed so my benefits wouldn't be touch, I know that was stupid cause they just could have taken it from my check. After I paid, it was still taken from my check. It's been about almost 3 months waiting for my money and nothing. I called and they said that they have no idea what money I sent. I have all my documents and I sent the money order through certified mail. I wrote Harrisburg and yet they haven't responded. They owe me $750. Can someone please tell me what else I can do to try and get my money back? It's sad how they can just take money you owe them but have a problem of paying people back what they owe..

Tengo un negocio en marcha desde hace tres a?os... la cosa ha crecido al punto que económicamente hablando me ha superado el ritmo de crecimiento a la administración.

Premesso che ho gli interessi passivi del mutuo che ogni anno scarico, questi mi rispondono che, per una legge recente, ora va visto in proporzione alla rendita catastale dell'immobile.       E, dopo una serie di calcoli, mi riduce l'importo in detrazione. Anche di parecchio.  Per farla breve, dunque, essendo la casa di vecchia data (rendita catastale bassa quindi) non posso detrarre l'intera somma... legge recente fatta per evitare le frodi...  Eppure il mutuo pagato l'ho pagato per la casa e non posso scaricarmi quanto fino a qualche anno fa potevo fare? gasp :-(         E' capitato a qualcun altro?  Quasi quasi sto pensando di provare a cambiare CAF....       Grazie e ciao

Ciao a tutti,      qualche tempo fa ho inviato una domanda dove già presentavo il problema. La Gerit (riscossione tributi) m'ha mandato una richiesta di pagamento a mezzo cartella esattoriale per tasse a loro dire non pagate.      La cosa che m'ha sorpreso, nel riceverla, è che contestano il mancato pagamento per l'anno 2000 e 2001.       Gasp!      Sto facendo ricerche su ricerche ma a tutt'oggi ancora niente.       Sul foglio che accompagnava la richiesta di pagamento c'è scritto che devo pagare entro 60 gg. dal 5 giugno (data di notifica). Il tempo corre veloce. Dunque dovrò pagare entro il 5 agosto?       A vostro avviso, qualora ricevessi le prove d'avvenuto pagamento, come devo comportarmi? che fare?       Grazie e ciao,

20070306142929AAxe0hX	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment	Does this sound rude to you?	I filled out an application at this place and I called today to ask to speak to the manager. When he got on the phone I was polite and said "Hi, I filled out an application yesterday and I was wondering if you were hiring" and he goes "No we 're not" then I go "ok" and he goes "ok?...bye" then I said "bye" and he hung up. I think that was f-ing rude. I mean shouldn't he at least have had the courtesy of saying something like "No sir we are not hiring at the moment, but call us in a couple of weeks" or like " Not right now but we'll give you a call if we need any help"? Some people just don't have any manners. I think it was so rude of him. I felt like calling him back and saying a bunch of things but I kept my cool.

These are symbols for commodity futures I've chosen for a Yahoo portfolio.  The prices were being updated properly -- just like prices for stock symbols -- until several weeks ago.  Then the prices stopped being updated.  Since then each time I look at the portfolio I see the August 10th prices.  I've tried various other futures symbols and have the same problem.  All I need is to see the day's prices for Gold, Silver, & Copper.  Spot prices would actually be better than futures.  But I've found no symbols for them.
