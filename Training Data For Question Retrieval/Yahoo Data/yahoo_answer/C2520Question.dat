20090202104549AAJAva0	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	Getting a car loan with really bad credit?	I have really bad credit (probably below 550) and I want to try to get a car loan to help fix that. I'm paying off my debts but have no credit in my name to help build it back up. I gross about $4000 a month and my bills are only about $1000 so my debt to income ratio is good. I have a trade in that I should get about 7000-8000 for (and that's being conservative) and only trying to buy a car that is on the lot for 12500 (and has a kbb value of 15500) So I'll only need to finance about $5000 on a car worth $15000. Will I be able to get approved despite my bad credit?

I followed the fuel line out of the gas tank up to the intake manifold as best I could- couldn't find it.  The replacement filter looks like a standard in-ine filter which goes on a 1/4" line someplace on the body.  I realy don't think its in the gas tank.

20090202105104AAwRKWC	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Good way of screwing a car up?	I need a good way making sure the current car I drive doesn't run this coming summer. I drive a 94 grand prix 3.0L. I'm pretty well mechanically inclined being grown up around the auto field. However, I know that the other men in my family are more advanced than I am. The car has 151,000 which isn't all that bad. But here are all the problems: gas tank has a hole in only fills up near the 3/4 line if that. No A/C, needs all new tires, and needs the steering fixed, intake manifold and gasket along with water pump need replaced. Also, needs new front struts. The car is no where near worth that kind of money to invest into. I need an idea to really screw this car up make it sorta easy to find but a pain in the butt to repair.     I know there are several ways to do it. But making it looking like it wasn't intentional. All suggestions will be greatly appreciated

I've been pretty much sheltered all of my life and I finally just moved out of my parents how. I moved to a different state and I'm living with my boyfriend. I'm currently trying to find a job and I desperately need a car. My boyfriend is going to iraq next month so I need to get a car really soon. The problem is that I have no idea how to go about getting a car. I dont have credit and I dont have a job but I'm hoping that will chance with in the next two to three weeks because I have some interviews. Anyways how do you get loans for cars what do you need ? I'm kind of freaked out because my parents are helping me out in anyway shape or form and i'm kind of new to this dealing with things on my  own. I know that must sound sad but it's true. Does anyone have any advice for me? I'd really appreciate it.

20090202105922AAnHhsd	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	Which car should I buy a 07 standard Toyota Yaris hatchback or 07 automatic AWD Dodge Caliber? Please read! ?	The 2dr 2007 Toyota Yaris has 17,000 miles. It costs $9000.00 It's standard. It is silver. Like new condition. Gets 40 mpg highway/ 34 mpg city. Has what is left of the factory warranty. Not much to it.      The 4dr 2007 Dodge Caliber has 41,000 miles. It costs $10,500.00 It's automatic. It is black. Like new condition. Gets 30 mpg highway/ 26 mpg city. Is loaded with cruise control, sun roof, cd player, leather seats, heated seats, built in cooler, and all wheel drive. VERY NICE!      I have never consistently driven a standard car before and the Yaris is standard. I love both cars, but I can't seem to choose. There are pros and cons to both.       The Yaris has less miles, it's cheaper, has a warranty, is foreign, holds it's price better, and I love Toyota's, but I don't know standard all that well and I live a snowy area. The car is small and is low to the ground and may have a hard time.      The Caliber on the other hand has all those features, is all wheel drive, is a bit bigger and automatic. It's domestic. It is $1,500 more tho with 25,000 more miles.       Any suggestions? I think that is all the details.

By 4x4 car I mean a hatchback or saloon, not a 'truck' such as a Range Rover.     Does 4x4 wheel drive necessarily equate to poor fuel economy- and if not, can you point me in the direction of a car that might fit the bill (my budget is about 5000)?     I am excluding the old 4x4 Panda as too dated and the Quattro as too expensive to run. Thanks!

20090202112939AAwsKke	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	I have a 96 Honda Accord with 105,000 miles on it that needs a costly repair. Is this problem worth fixing?	I own a 96 Honda Accord that recently started overheating when stuck in traffic. I brought it to my mechanic and he told me that my antifreeze is starting to leak through the head gasket. He estimated that it would cost approximately $1200 to fix. He knows I'm tight on money so he also told me that there was no rush in fixing it immediately, but that I should check the antifreeze every few days or so and re-fill if necessary. Another mechanic who inspected it told me that my antifreeze is actually burning AND that my engine oil is also starting to leak through the spark plugs. He estimated that everything would cost about $600 or $700 to fix, with an additional couple hundred on top of that if the head gasket is cracked. I can't really afford to buy a new car right now, but is this problem worth fixing? Also, could someone explain the mechanics of the head gasket and all that? I tried my best to ask questions and understand the problem, but I'm still a bit confused.
20090203163159AA1VgM2	Cars & Transportation;Car Audio	Will my car battery die when I install my subs and speakers? PLEASE HELP!!!!?	I am worried because I drive a 1995 car . Just recently I bought a new deck, 4 kicker ks 5250 speakers, a kicker 300.1 amp, and 2 12" kicker comp subs. The guy in the store said my car will be fine, but I am recently having doubts about this. I get them installed this weekend so I was hoping I could get some answers quick.       I have a new alternator but it just a regular duty one, so I am not planning on getting another new one. Im afraid if I just get a bigger battery it will just last me a little longer but still die, and I really don't want this to happen. I was wondering if I should get capacitor and if it will help that much? Because lots of people are telling me that they don't really do much if your car is having major problems with the energy.      So please help me out guys, what should I do, get a capacitor? get a refund for the soundsystem? or just keep it and will it work fine?      Thanks in advance

20090203165856AA1GDgV	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Are my motor mounts bad?	I am a bit of an amateur when it comes to engine mounts, so I need some advice. I have a 2002 Passat 1.8T with some rough idle problems (only in drive and reverse, goes away in neutral). I also get some vibrations when I'm accelerating at higher speeds. The engine also rocks back and forth considerably when I shift from reverse to drive (and vice versa). I have found that the source of these vibrations is coming from my engine/tranny mounts. A local garage told me that the right tranny mount was missing a bolt and needed to be replaced. The center mount was also in poor condition. However, the mechanic recommended that I replace all mounts (engine right, engine left, engine center, tranny right, tranny left). Is this a bit excessive? The entire job is pretty expensive, so I need some insight. Will my problems be fixed with a new tranny and center mount, or should I replace them all? The car has 100K miles on it.

We want to buy a van, we were denied 6 months ago because of poor credit but we have been cleaning it up and paying our other car payment on time for the last 6 months.

One of the debts we are paying on is in collections, we are paying $300 a month to it but our payments aren't showing up on our credit report, and won't until the debt is paid in full.   Also, is there really much of a difference (to a lender) between a $1500 down payment and a $1000 down payment?

I recently had the alternator and battery replaced after the alternator had died. This was a month ago. I went and started it up tonight, when I did so, the lights flickered a bit, I pulled out of my drive way and it stalled before I even got it in drive. I put the flashers on but after a minute of having them on, they started to dim and stopped flashing.       The battery is almost completely dead with just barely enough to keep the interior lights on for a few minutes. I checked all the ineterior lights thinking somone left them on which drained the battery but none were. I can't figure out why it would die if already started and then result in a dead battery. Any help or suggestions would be appreciated. I can supply more details if needed aswell.

After I pulled off the old cables; I put the new cables on to test; Wouldn't start. I thought bad cables'; so I put the OLD cables on; Won't start. I made sure that the cables were in the right spot. I followed the picture from the distributor cap to the plugs.   5. I put in the new spark plugs and made sure the spark plug holes were clean of any Debris before replacing.    6.

I have never taken a shop or auto class in high school (I graduated last year). Would they help me along the way and learn everything? Or do i just not have a place because i don't already know the basics?
