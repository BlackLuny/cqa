(And I also like to see more than just kissing . . .).<br>  <br>  I suggest you Google "Club Thrust Jenna Jameson", "slash fiction", and "yaoi", which will explain various phenomenons of women, straight, bisexual, and even lesbian, who enjoy male-male intimacy and porn.|`|FL67UPPHaa	If the men are attractive, yes. I still prefer to see two women or a man and woman kissing, but in a way two men together can be even hotter because it's so taboo and you don't see it very often. We see men and women kissing all the time, and it's quite common even just among female friends. So it's a bit more exciting to see two men kissing. :D|`|s3IBrhZCaa	absolutely disgusting|`|IwUpusQiaa	kissing is always hot.|`|jN8duTx2aa	Yes some women find it to be a turn on and I would imagine it will become more common as the media shows it more often.<br>  <br>  Really the issue is socialization.  50 years ago men considered lesbainism threatening, but porn has made it seem like something women do for men to watch so suddenly its a turn on.|`|Olz3goEaaa	I always hear no to that one from chicks (not that I often ask), but I'd guess some bi chicks like it.<br>  <br>  I think even chicks would rather watch two chicks hook-up than two dudes, but if you went back to ancient Greece, you'd probably get the opposite reaction.

Et011ogJaa	I believe in both. There are absolutes. It is our point of view of the truth that is relative. The earth was thought of as flat...but from space we have seen that it is round.

Everyone is different, and your values really depend on how you were raised and what you were taught and your own life experiences. We love our families because they are always going to be there. No matter what, even if you have destroyed the world you still have your last name and a family that is connected to you. They, even if they don't want to; will always be there no matter what.

If you do not have someone who would make a good listener, write down you problems, get them off your chest, and as soon as you write it down, let go of it. dont let it hold you down any longer. it just adds to the stress of everyday life. work on controlling your anger and dont use violence as an outlet. if violence is the only way you can release it, find a productive way to let it out. dont take it out on another person. instead, maybe do some laborous work, like shovelling gravel or something tedious as that. tunnel all that negative energy into doing something productive.
AA10873745	Say or write down your real true feeling about something, esp any anger you still hold about the issue, and say, "I recognize the anger I feel about blankety blank, and I release that anger now." Sounds simple, but our minds listen to and believe what we say. Of course, this may have to be repeated a few times to really take.<br>  Good luck.<br>  P.S.

Apparently when you test it out it just doesn't work. Heh, but if you just happen to be seeing things like the coffin. You saw A coffin in a dream then your grandmother died, does not mean much. unless it is the exact scene that hasn't happened yet.

9961a4fda02d0241974fd4e74d5ad8aeaa	Her reproductive choices are selfish, short-sighted and irresponsible.  She seems to have had all of these children for her own fulfillment and pro-life ideals, while the pragmatic question of how to adequately provide and care for all those children is an afterthought, something she'll just figure out along the way.  She seems to genuinely love her children, but I doubt her mental stability and ability to tackle the enormous challenges of raising 14 kids.  I'm suprised the doctor who did the in virto fertalization didn't have some kind of ethical objection to giving such a large number of children to an unemployed single mother already on public assistance.<br>  <br>  I don't even think what she's doing should be legal. People hoping to adopt children must first demonstrate a stable source of income, adequate home space and sufficient caretaking ability.  But people don't need to meet any such standards before undergoing in vitro fertalization as many times as they want?  That doesn't add up.

k2wPknXlaa	Try just spending your time with the people that you like the most. Don't worry about whether they are men or women.|`|ab595311acfbfd9b16a828da10437178aa	Are you sure your really into men is what you should be asking yourself.  Its not something you can choose its how you feel, and hey if you get your jollys with women go right ahead and do what ever makes you happy.|`|a010b3fdc9589a66c7d2baaf49c3a540aa	It's not a question of the people you meet, just the way you feel about the women is stronger than with men.<br>  It could be a sexuality thing.|`|mGfQapDxaa	no- i don't think you are crazy<br>  yup- you might not have met the right man yet<br>  or maybe you'd just be better off with a woman, which is ok too if that is what would make you happy
oaOZ2wlRaa	You probably like these women because they can understand and connect with you more than any man has. If you haven't ever loved someone (family or like a relationship) then you might be desperate for love or companionship. Since women are often less afraid to show what they are thinking and feeling, it's probably easier to connect with them.<br>  <br>  If you are SURE you are not a lesbian, then you should look for men that are compassionate, you have great chemistry with (easy to talk to, etc), and are interested in you for more than your looks.|`|84gK4XlHaa	I think that it's all about the person, not necessarily their gender.  I wouldn't be so quick to the Freudian route and blame everything on an Electra Complex either.  I think that it's more likely that you need to expand your social circle and start meeting a different kind of man.  We tend to get comfortable with who we hang out with and unintentionally seek out similar personalities to those we're already familiar with.|`|Qk3b5qMxaa	I think you're confused. But, I don't think you are a homosexual. I have had those thoughts before...so you are not alone. A lot of peolple doubt their sexuality these days (especially if they're in their  teens or early 20s). This is mainly due to the increased media attention on homosexuality and glamorization of the homosexual life style.|`|AA10712251	Face the reality of it all.

Sometimes it is people I know, sometimes people I may have just seen. <br>  You should definitely try to get out and meet some new people and see what that does for you. <br>  You can always try to talk to a psychologist or counselor about it and see what they think. <br>  I don't think it's that bad.

GDbTG9oCaa	Well, tell them how sad you would be and how much you love them.  Just keep telling them mushy stuff like that.  Whatever you do, DON'T yell at them.  That will make it worse.  And if they do start cutting themselves, tell their parents (if you're a kid) and they will hopefully be able to help.  <br>  <br>  If you are an adult, keep wearing them down with how uch you love them.  Give them presents, send them email.  And just remember- keep doing it because even if they don't look like they appreciate what you say, on the inside they really do.|`|XhzvFAK2aa	Show unconditional love, empathy, care, well meant concern, comfort and a shoulder to cry on.

533aec411376adde47ba86f66a0aa949aa	Not every bit of sex in our lives has to be romantic and fluffy and sterile as a bunny with no fuzzy carrot.<br>  <br>  The fact that the 'girl' who you suggested going down on really resembled a guy wasn't as 'gross' as you might think. Since you don't sound sexually experienced, the dream girl sounds like a mix between you and your boyfriend. It's difficult to say but her criticizing of your oral skills suggest an inner insecurity, one that might be just within yourself (making it appear as if its a girl criticizing you) or it might be coming from both you and your boyfriend (which is why the girl was so 'boyish') and thus why you were so upset at your 'sweet' innocent boyfriend.<br>  <br>  Sure, you didn't like going down on the girl, but you did like the idea of going down on someone, (and you REALLY like the idea of someone going down on you, which is where the girl/girl action is coming from) of working at it until it gets done (and both of you are satisfied, which you aren't right now.) Notice how your happy time got interrupted by needing to go out and wash the car. That means that only one person got a happy ending, which is really why you are unhappy at your bf.<br>  <br>  As for the dog going down on you, again, just you looking for a little bit of reciprocity, wanting to know what it feels like, strange but not all that strange.|`|5dcARi8Daa	I dont understand what youre saying. sorry|`|k2wPknXlaa	You know your dog loves you no matter how you treat him or her. He or she always will try to please you. It sounds like you are like your dog with your boyfriend, always trying to please him (What a blessing!) Maybe he is not like that with you. You please him but he doesn't care if he necessarily pleases you. He may have other things to do like please himself or other people instead.|`|R0cxoUkDaa	Sounds like you really like your boyfriend but you wish that he was just a little bit more in touch with his sensitive side.
TskZHzZyaa	I agree with you - one should not give out their SSN to ANYONE.  Most government agencies require it even though in my opinion they do not need it.<br>  <br>  I have been very tempted to write a disclaimer that I wouldsend to the agency requesting it.  You've inspired me - I'll write it now:<br>  <br>  In requesting my Social Security Number and pertinent private information, you (hereinafter referred to as "the agency") understand that the agency shall automatically accept all liability and responsibility for assuring that it is not to be used by any individual or company beyond the agency requiring it to allow me (the provider) to conduct business with your agency, or for any other purpose beyond this transaction.  Should a breech in this agency's security allow it to be procured by an outside agency (whether that is through a technological breech, and employee of the agency, or any other entity beyond the solely intended agency), and should it be abused by such person(s) by procuring sensitive information, funds, or other private information from the provider, the agency accepts responsibility in reimbursing the provider for any and all financial losses, legal fees, and any other costs associated in refurbishing the credit history, reestablishment of the security of the provider.  In that the agency has mandated that the provider surrender this personal information as a prerequisite to conduct business with the agency, the agency will accept this responsibility upon receipt of this information. This statement shall additionally apply to any third party agencies that may additionally require this information to similarly conduct business (e.g.: PayPal via eBay).<br>  <br>  Scary enough?  Not bad for an architect, eh? :)|`|zmxMrOO3aa	their idiots or just dont know better.|`|sJC1WAi5aa	cuz there wired like that but dont do that it will make your life hell|`|z7IYhVXzaa	Well, as a consumer, I am taking a leap of faith by trusting that as a representative, you would not violate YOUR company's policy by stealing my social security number even though I provided it. I rarely provide my social security number to strangers however, I try everything before I give it out. Also, those consumers who do provide their social security number most likely have insurane for identity theft and are protected against it. Have you seen that commercial for an insurance company that protects identity theft? I think he was the governor of some state and had a truck driving around with his social security number on a truck because he is so positive that the company will not let his identity be stolen. It's a thought. :)|`|GqTSa85daa	Many people are too trusting.  I don't necessarily believe they they are naive, but believe the best in people.|`|thW6k4zXaa	I only give my social security number to my doctors apt.  and that's it.
JyAUAbsjaa	well it seems to me that if she didn't want someone to look then she shouldn't wear that type of shirt. Just be careful cause sexual harassment suits are only a stare away. If she feels violated in any way, you could lose your job. It's not always fair, but that's the way it happens sometimes. I wouldn't look unless you know her really well.|`|b1NRf4VCaa	yukie gross unless not look|`|AA10510845	Well, it's pretty hard not to notice.  You can catch a glimpse now and then, but staring is out.  What is she thinking?  Probably that she's a provocative sex machine.  I'm really surprised that your workplace doesn't have a dress code.  We were never allowed to wear anything revealing, such as high-cut skirts or low-cut tops.  Even in summer, we couldn't wear capris or see-through blouses.  They did let us wear ankle-length pants.  How sexy was that?  However, there is a method to that madness of dress codes.  It helps poor guys like you keep your mind on your work and not on the scantily-dressed females.  But as long as your boss doesn't seem to mind, you can sneak peeks all you want:)|`|lFzXZQQDaa	She probably doesn't want you to look. I'm sure she has had plenty of guys staring at them her whole life. Just take it easy. <br>  It's work... nothing else.<br>  <br>  Don't look. If you do look it will show her what you're thinking and she'll feel uncomfortable around you.|`|XhzvFAK2aa	Nah, think the best it means fk all, up to her to express her femininity as long as not too obvious and affront to public decency.  Be discrete, in your observations of others.|`|92yiQo7uaa	She should dress according to the situation and boobies hanging out is not appropriate office dress. This will not help her.|`|AA10649722	She's thinking one of a few things.<br>  1. Damn, my boobs look good today.<br>  2. Oh my god, that guy is SO freakin' hot I can't believe it.<br>  3. Augh, why didn't I send the dry-cleaning back last week? I have nothing to wear except this shirt that makes me look like a streetwalker!<br>  <br>  Don't look.|`|yr0UZVZAaa	Well, not look. It isn't hard to not look. She probably just liked the dress and had no real sexual intentions about it. I do know a place you can look that would make her happy. When you talk to women look them in the eye.|`|cHIiwM8yaa	disagree with the person above the person above, maybe she is a dirty lil ho3, maybe shes tryna work it for u becuz she likes u, maybe if u do stare u can get laid<br>  <br>  <br>  it all depends on wut kind of guy u r|`|aMH04aSvaa	Its Kinda like when a guy wears a tight shirt to show off his muscles i mean most guys want you to stare but women dont glance maybe but dont keep your eyes locked|`|FDaBYExwaa	Not all women dress up to give guys the chills in their pants! T.T Lots of women dress sexy because it feels good, you feel more powerful and assertive!|`|YbEQ8Wv5aa	Did it ever occur to you that she wore it because she personally likes it or it makes her feel good about herself, and not just so you could stare at her ****?|`|QM2UqZmuaa	What is there for the man to see in the other man?|`|D1Uf6eKcaa	Just look at her ****.

I do get some financial aid, but my parents aren't really chipping in for my college tuition, and I don't expect them to. He could get a part time job, or do something else in this case.

VJNLkJT0aa	Heroes inspire the citizens of a society. Values of the group and someone exceeding those values is what makes a person a hero. Heroes inspires hope in the dark times and humbleness in the good. Because a hero could be anybody. People like to believe that help is just around the corner. Heroes are good for the morale of a society. Heroes give society role models.|`|rM5Tofhwaa	Heroes are useless among Intelligent groups of people.  Educated people don't need the pride and ownership of looking up to a hero.  Ignorant people, on the other hand, Value a superior individual as a symbol of their strength.  It is true that a lot of hard working people had a lot to contribute for a better society, but these aren't to be looked at as heroes.  Everyone has just as much potential to be able to empower their nation.  This is assuming you are talking about human figures and not "superheroes"
W1xs3vYBaa	I do not think it was from a reliable source. <br>  <br>  117 means that you are above average intelligence, and if you do not see the results as reliable does that mean you think you are slow? <br>  <br>  How would you know if the results were reliable unless you knew whether they were good or bad? <br>  <br>  Therefore, I have to conclude that your reliable IQ test was done online or a simple multiple choice test. This means that your results are invalid. If you are interested in your IQ then get it done by a professional psychologist/psychiatrist. Your local high school will set this up/<br>  <br>  117 is a good score. It means that you have a mental surplus and can solve problems.

YzoLa5Uuaa	This is highly subjective. There are many theories of memory (modal model, Baddley's working memory, schema theory, et cetera).<br>  <br>  The most basic examples of "evidence" for long-term and short-term  memory (now generally considered "working memory) had to do with word list studies. The serial position curve is a good demonstration that shows long-term memory effects and short-term memory effects (specifically alterations on the serial position curve can show how you can repress short-term memory, and how you can disrupt long-term memory). Look up Ebbinghaus or Murdock for information about this). <br>  <br>  For sensory memory, the original studies that were used had people try and recall information after they removed it from a screen and an indicator of what they were supposed to remember occurred AFTER the image disappeared-- people were highly accurate if the buzzer occurred within 0-2 seconds after the disappearance because you can still "see" the image in your mind (sensory store). Look up Sperling for the actual study.<br>  <br>  These are just two examples-- if you make your question clearer I can elucidate on more memory effects and examples. Good luck.|`|E2xG6bpnaa	I was in an accident and damaged my short term memory... what are you asking|`|ruHqOYMDaa	For long term try and think of something that happened more than ten minutes ago, for sensory use youtube for ways to prove it, there are a lot, another alternative is to drawn something in MS-Paint or a similar application, hit invert colours and focus on the picture, then very quickly look at a white sheet of paper, you should see the image on the paper in it's natural colours for a brief period of time, it can actually stay for a little bit if you keep your eyes very still.  It's also worth noting that it can be proven that long term and short term memory are different by looking into anterograde  and retrograde amnesia, which are the loss of short term memory, and the loss of long term memory for things prior to the event respectively, hese also show how two other forms of memory work, these two are know as declarative and implicit, implicit is something such as riding a bike, while explicit on the other hand can be further sub-devided into semantic (factual memory, usually without context), and and episodic (like an episode of your life, or an event you remember.)<br>  <br>  I hope this helped =D
MJijF66Paa	I suppose the best contradiction that sums this economic downturn is: With $10 Trillion worth of debt, we can no longer support our economy of 70% consumer spending; our credit cards are maxed out. This, of course, starts up a new contradicting continuum  with these bail out and stimulus packages. <br>  <br>  Every country that has ever ran this type of reckless expansionary monetary policy has had recessions. The US has even upped the odds with its GDP largely based on consumer spending (US GDP = 70% consumer spending) and an increasing trade deficit to accompany it; our economic footing is accumulating debt from bought imported products. <br>  <br>  Given this, recessions are necessary because, in all the circumstances, debt has to be liquidated and to also offset all MAL investments.

dprURFLxaa	I found this article a long time ago...I think it is really helpful.  Not everyone who is always late is doing it because they value themselves more than others...some people just have a hard time getting where they need to be on time.  I have two little stubborn kids and that alone can sometimes set my clock back and make me late...even when I plan additional time to get somewhere.<br>  <br>  "After a quick shower, grabbing a bagel for breakfast, and fighting your way across town on the jam packed freeway, you arrive at work with 15 minutes to spare, only to notice that your secretary - who always seems to be late - is as usual still not there. While stewing over this problem, you start the coffee pot and turn the lights on through out the office - both of which your secretary should be doing. By the time the coffee is through brewing, it is 15 minutes after 8, and your secretary is already 15 minutes late for work. Why, oh why, are some people ALWAYS late for work?<br>  <br>  If this scenario sounds familiar, you are not alone. Some people are just chronically late to work, appointments, and even parties and celebrations. But why? If you can get to work on time, why can't they? Some people simply are very un-organized in the mornings. Not everyone is a morning person, waking alert and ready to go. Some people have a hard time waking up in the mornings, and an even harder time getting their kids off to school or day-care, their husband off to work, breakfast fixed, lunches fixed, and getting to work on time themselves.<br>  <br>  For others it is a matter of simply refusing to live by the clock, or even set their alarm at night. They insist on simply getting up when they get up, and if they are late to work, so what! At least they are rested...who cares? This is a very bad attitude for them to have, however, and sooner or later, their boss will tire of this undependable trend.<br>  <br>  Being consistently late to work can also be caused by a lack of self-esteem. If someone's self esteem is low, it will take them longer to get ready for an appointment (work included). These people have a hard time deciding what to wear, how to fix their hair, and every other detail. They may also be depressed and this will also cause a person to be much slower and later than someone who is confident and happy in their lives.<br>  <br>  And some people simply don't accurately judge the amount of time needed to complete certain tasks in the mornings, and therefore they are doomed from the start because they already got up too late to get everything done and still arrive at work on time. This sort of person needs a dependable schedule to use when trying to get to work on time, however, there never seems to be enough time for them!<br>  <br>  Although it is very annoying for other employees and employers when someone is consistently late to work, this is a trend that person will probably never break. As the old saying goes, they will probably even be late for their own funeral!"<br>  <br>      ~ by Mary Hale, (found this on Helium.com)|`|KPPScRaHaa	They are procrastinators<br>  or lazy<br>  or rebellious<br>  or self centered.<br>  Wanting to make an entrance.<br>  They think to themselves "I'll be there when I get there and there's nothing you can do about it." <br>  or "My time is more important than your time."|`|NYQhhNbzaa	I wish I knew the answer to that one.

Putting your mom first ahead of your wife or letting your mom butt into your personal relationship with your partner is being a momma's boy. There is a huge difference. An example is my daughter was married to one. He let his mom interfere with everything that concerned their marriage, even handled the money instead of letting his wife pay the bills - his mom did - and she didn't pay bills and got their credit messed up !! she butted into everything and he just went along with it, even when my daughter cried and got upset with him and tried numerous times to talk to him about it. As you can guess, they are no longer married - when you get married you are supposed to make your wife # 1 in your life, it even says it in your wedding vows and in the Bible - there is a part about leaving the parent and becoming one with the wife etc. I hope this helps you to understand. Oh yes, and according to this guy's momma, he could do NO wrong, even when he did stuff wrong ( before they were married) she would blindly stand up for her son, to the point of making a total *** out of herself. Sickening. On more than one occasion, she supported him lying and cheating to get out of trouble too, that we all saw. This is unhealthy to say the least.

He just thinks they should be paying their fair share in taxes instead of shifting the burden to less wealthy people, like what has been going on since the 1980s. Why should someone who makes over a million dollars a year only pay about 17% of their income in taxes while someone who makes about $50,000 has to pay about 30%?<br>  <br>  Not all rich people worked hard or got a good education.

AA10240928	Maybe much worse.  It's not just home foreclosures, it's decades of false prosperity fueled by debt that created an industrial infrastructure than cannot be sustained.  That means that there are a lot of factories, offices, shopping centers and industrial centers that are not needed now that we are faced with the reality of our true demand for goods and services.  That translates to a lot of jobs that are no longer needed, and a ripple effect that is causing what some believe will be an economic crisis that will eclipse the Great Depression and cause mass riots, social upheaval, wars, starvation and rampant crime.|`|P9RauQ7laa	depression.|`|BuvQ8tuuaa	Yes, it will get worse.  This is primarily because Washington, D. C. is treating the *symptoms* of the recession and not the cause--people failing to pay the mortgages they bought, regardless of whether those products were good or bad.<br>  <br>  The stimulus package should have gone directly to people who were either in, or currently in, foreclosure.  For $900 billion and an average house price of $150,000, this would have stopped 6 million foreclosures.  That money would have a) paid off the mortgages, b) put money directly into the banks that sold the products, and c) made those homeowners more secure.  <br>  <br>  Those homeowners would have turned around and taken the money they would have spent on their house and put it back into the economy.  6 million homes * average mortgage payment of $1,000 = $6 billion put into the hands of business as those consumers spend their money...every month.  Now *that* would have stimulated the economy in the correct way!

I'm 5'9 so I'm certainly tall enough without them and all, but things just seem more positive when I wear heels.  I feel more confidant and professional and plus my legs and butt look amazing.

AA10510845	Yes, I think you're an introvert, since you obviously enjoy being alone rather than with crowds of people.  But just because you're an introvert doesn't mean that you don't occasionally like to interact with people.  It's just that you're more selective with whom you associate.  Introverts are not zombies.  Sure, they're deep thinkers, but they do crave a rather limited social life, and seek people who are like themselves, quiet, and like solitude.  Among introverts and extraverts, there are many different personalities, so there isn't just one mold that all introverts or extraverts fit into.  But from what you tell me, you are predominantly an introverted personality.  I'm an introvert myself, and only feel comfortable in the company of friends. I am not extremely outgoing and the life of the party type.  But I do have many friends, and most of them are like me, so we get along great.  I do have friends that are extraverts, and I like them very much, but just hearing about their comings and goings makes me tired.  I wish I had more energy, but I don't.  I definitely crave solitude.  What I'm trying to say is, we are never all one way or the other, but a mixture where one facet of our personality is dominant.  If I could chose whether I'd want to be an introvert or an extravert, I think I would definitely be an introvert.  We are the ones who walk softly and carry a big stick!  Good luck!|`|k2wPknXlaa	Speaking as an introvert myself.....Yes ......... and that will work for you until it doesn't. When it doesn't work for you anymore, you may have to change to obtain something that you realize is missing or just to figure out what it is that may be missing.|`|AA12363819	Be a mime!!!! :D|`|1a4b9f1a1733a31399ee4d98fa86c4d8aa	Judging by the lengthy extension to your question, you are evidently not shy to talk, but like me, only on your own terms.<br>  <br>  I think sometimes that people are not listening to me, so I don't say anything.

C02ASCzpaa	What your teacher is doing is a classic way to monitor class attention.  The idea is that he is trying to shock the people that are trying to just coast through the class.  It sounds like he will call on you less as he gets to know you.  I had a teacher like that who eventually refused to let me answer any more questions.<br>  <br>  As for anxiety, that is natural, especially in high school.  Keep in mind that you are a straight A student and that you understand the material.  A little confidence makes a huge difference with testing.<br>  <br>  Depression, that's a lot tougher.  You really need to talk to someone about that; you and whoever you speak with have to understand the seriousness of the situation.  Depression isn't something to dismiss lightly, and unfortunately, most depression drugs can have reverse effects on teens.<br>  <br>  A couple of things to think about:<br>  1) Most of the kids in your class probably wish they were you (at least in terms of your grades).<br>  2) You can be or do whatever you want... Would anything else make you happy?  If you think of something, GREAT!  But most likely, you need to find out what will make you happy.<br>  3) The way you learn most is by doing.  So go out there are try actually doing things.<br>  4) What is the worst thing that could happen at the presentation.  Is there a chance that you are going to be killed or maimed?  It really isn't that bad, and if you know what you are talking about, then you have nothing to worry about.|`|B27oNdbNaa	I have had similar problems. I resorted to anti-anxiety medications.<br>  Talk to your family doctor.|`|6K0kOv6Naa	I would suggest trying to talk with the teacher if you're comfortable with it.  I had the same type of problems for awhile and teachers are usually pretty understanding.  I found the best way to go about presentations was to know them as best I could.  If you know the information through and through there is less to be nervous about and you will have confidence in yourself.  If the problems become more severe or keep coming back you should really talk to a doctor.  Everybody is really on your side if they see that you need help

What that means is, don't let circumstances affect you to the point that you are frozen in place, but instead tell yourself to do something, no matter what, anything!|`|244858ce8da436fac455dd9c89ebd405aa	learn something new - a language, a dance, read a book, art  <br>  <br>  there are so many things to discover in this world, you could try something new every day and never get bored! <br>  <br>  keep trying until you find your passion!
4B9Ve1LSaa	In our society we do buy things on a daily basis.  We do not go without if we somehow have the funds to provide us with all of our needs.  It could be considered somewhat gluttonous.  If we want a coffee, we buy a coffee.  If we need milk, we buy milk.  We really do not even think about it, we just do.  We are a society that fulfills our every need and most of the time every "want".  Immediate gratification instead of pre thought and financially planning.  In essence, we do not go without if we have the means to afford or sometimes even not afford our every whim.|`|3caq6SFxaa	I disagree with the statement-too many people spend money on a daily basis on everything they want is more accurate.  It reflects a society that is impatient and does think about the future but more interested in instant gratification.|`|viMAqdxxaa	We don't spend money on a daily basis for everything we need . We spend money on essentials like food, shelter ( mortgage / rent ) , energy bills .

AA10392637	Does this person have family?  If you are a friend invite the person out for coffee.  Have people go and visit the person one or two at a time only.  As the person starts feeling more comfortable try to get them involved in something they are interested in book clubs, golf, or anything along that line.  The individual may have been introverted all along but in certain situations appeared liked an extrovert.  Individuals act differently in different social situations or work situations so think about when you considered this individual an extrovert.

Your body shape may not be perfect in their subconscious mind.  So, projecting being pregnant may be triggered by visual effect.<br>  <br>  2.  Heavy responsibilities, if you are the type of person who likes to do things for people, being pregnant to them is a sign of stress, burden and you may be the one who likes to take those challenges.<br>  <br>  3. Jealousy - depending on who are dreaming.  It could be possible that someone is jealous about things you got.<br>  <br>  4. Suspicion - If you have close relationship and do things way over the moral standard, being pregnant is how to project because people may think that you have been having sex.<br>  <br>  Whatever it is, it really depends on individual people|`|3qbD3cDKaa	preagnacy means trouble, and ur carrying it and not willing to get rid of it and let it go only at the rite time<br>  u r carrying a burden or troubles, u want to ignore it to let it resolve itself, its time to face the truth and kick butt|`|IODhng5qaa	hmmm its a dream.

oFR4yvHaaa	They say it out of anger for your refusal to submit to their desires. It IS a "guilt trip" ...nothing more, nothing less. I've had it said to me many times.. its usually followed by crossed arms and breaking of eye contact. <br>  <br>  They want you to think you're hurting them by not doing what they want and they think you will feel guilty and submit. It's a very childish tactic that works like a charm on WEAK men.

But you knew this already.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Freddy got it right.|`|0d183ab8af4fe4c2164d74294bd981adaa	Its kind of like saying "whatever I give up".|`|PwvU3LQBaa	When I say that, it usually means there is no reasoning with him that what he wants to do is probably not a good idea.  I give up so to speak and let him do what he wants.  He usually thinks it through then and agrees with me, but if he doesn't and he goes through with it, then he usually finds out I was right.  This happens about 99% of the time.  I don't know why he still argues with me.|`|fDGPbwdsaa	I remember one particularly bad instance this happened with my hex wife...<br>  <br>  I answered the phone and my ex g/f asked if I'd like the kids over. My (then current) wife could hear the conversation. I gladly accepted the kind offer. <br>  <br>  Until I saw my wife's face.<br>  <br>  So, I backstepped, and said to the ex "well, hold ona moment, I'd best check xxx hasn't anything planned..."<br>  <br>  I muted the phone and asked if that was ok, she frowned & scowled all in one, folded her arms cut a glare - she replied "Fine... yes, have them over."<br>  <br>  I got back to my ex, and said "Yanno, I'd best not take them today... I think xxx has something planned" (trying to not state "well, she looks damn pee'd off so I'd best not else she'll make me pay for eternity")<br>  <br>  So I put the phone down, and didn't take my kids that day...<br>  <br>  Stupid of me, yeah. <br>  <br>  <br>  Anyway, much later we argued about this - I reminded her of the scowl, the glare, the frown, the folded arms, the huffing and puffing... "But I said YES, didn't I?!?!" she reminded me.<br>  <br>  Yep, she had - verbally... Apparently, verbal communications only accounts for about 7% though.<br>  <br>  Her body language did not say yes.|`|AA11077726	It is pure passive-agressive behavior.

See if I care what you do with your dumb decisions!"|`|Olz3goEaaa	Flashback from her porn days?|`|uhchod38aa	What she said: "Fine, do whatever you want." <br>  <br>  What she means: "You are being a bone head but I see you have made up your mind and I want to end the conversation now."<br>  <br>  You wrote: "Do they actually think that we weren't going to do whatever we want in the first place?"<br>  <br>  Now I see by the way you phrased that, you are actually addressing the question only to men and excluding women. But I will answer anyway: No, at the point the woman is saying *whatever* to you, she sees that you are going to do whatever it is you want to do. That's why she's saying *whatever.* It's a dismissive thing to say. Basically, she is telling you to shut up.|`|z2xRXM5Laa	Women usually say that when they know that the man isn't going to be considerate or receptive to her feelings anyway.  Many women find it emotionally depleting when arguing over the SAME issues with a guy who is just clueless about consideration of others. The woman sits back, watching him do it his way and screw everything up.<br>  So there he is getting it his way again, but guess what -<br>   She is getting more miserable at home but she's eyeing the cutie next door.|`|AA11429880	I think I've got to agree with Freddy.  If I say it, I've given up on the issue.  I avoid arguments anyway, I had enough of that when I was married.

8VlDuMFOaa	Dream brother...I am going to go out on a limb here, and take a wild stab in the dark about what I think is going on in your dream...and I am also thinking about your last dream you had too!!<br>  <br>  Ok - here goes.....   ( you know I will be shattered if I am wrong here because I have put a LOT of thought into this!!! )<br>  <br>  Firstly, I believe that a tree in a dream, can represent a person. In this case, the tree is your mum. Like a tree, she has provided food, shelter, roots and stability throughout your life.<br>  <br>  Now I am taking a wild guess here, but I am thinking you are in a very new relationship ( one that you think is going to go somewhere ) and you are in the process of wanting to introduce this person to your mother as " a new person in your life"...you are "branching out as such" and want to start a new cycle in your life....BUT you have some anxieties about this, thus this is where the "falling tree" comes into it. Falling in a dream means there are anxieties within ones self.<br>  <br>  Ultimately you want to protect your mum, and maybe are a little concerned on how she will react, but deep down you know she will be accepting because as a mum, she wants you to be happy, and she trusts your judgement. Maybe this new person is "typically" not someone you think your mum would like, and there could be a few issues to begin with, but it will all work out in the end.<br>  <br>  <br>  Woah!!   I know I am probably completely way off, but if I am even remotely close you need to tell me cos I'm going to get into dream interpretation!!!  Even if i am wrong, it makes for a great bed time story!! lol  please tell me I am right!!!|`|gplfqOEHaa	Something u see as home is about to have a change. That thing could be a person, a house, a family or even a country.

NSKimt1Qaa	Not true for me. I actually prefer the three-dimensional person. Reality is preferable to me over the fantasy. An individual who has real thoughts and feelings, someone with flaws and failings, is much more interesting and appealing to me.  I need someone I can relate to and who wants to relate to me.  I know what you're saying about that veil of mystery and how some women (and men) find that exciting, but that seems juvenile to me and a waste of time.  <br>  I want the real thing!|`|NJVm6dTiaa	No way, not for me, not at all.<br>  It's the fleshing out of that initial, primal attraction by seeing the guy unveiled as a multi-dimensional person that enhances the appeal.<br>  If there are, in fact, women, who lose interest as they get to know you better, they're really not worth your time or energy! Really, no matter how cute they are.|`|IKzd9UCUaa	I prefer five dimensional men, or at least four|`|slHUNl58aa	Maybe with some, I don't know.  <br>  Myself, I like a three dimensional person. What is so great about a good looking caveman without depth.<br>  Some guys look great to me until they open their mouths and I find out there is nothing in there. Then I don't see them the same way anymore.<br>  I find good conversation so attractive they could be mutts and I find myself being very intrigued if they are open and interesting.<br>  I honestly believe the brain is the biggest and best sex organ, beautiful minds make me hot.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	I find this to be very true.|`|WlywfjG1aa	Very true eddie ! Women are deceptive , they initially want to win over you , have a need that you accept them , but stupid men ( Like us ) fall in love with them , reveal heart , soul , guts and then women just manipulate you and then loose interest in you !|`|qdPtCBJeaa	HMMM.......probobly......its all about being mysterious sometimes.....and then....poof......nothing left to the imagination? or the fantasy?<br>  Sigh.......|`|NBDLUOkiaa	I just want a hug!|`|7b27127244ac3ec3fd8e90dd6ba85685aa	i agree i just want a hug
AA10471659	welcome to 8 years of telling you to grow up and do this or that   Take this story and bring it with you, . This is what you need to tell the doctor your not well and this is why I feel like this. print it out and take it with you. you explained yourself really well here . And don't let anyone talk you out of giving this to your doctor. They have to know what you are going through, and this does that extremely well. you will get better if the doctor can get all this information. You are doing exactly the right thing, you know that right?|`|KyAjmaOyaa	Well after reading this, the solution seems a bit more simpler than you would it be. Let's go to the source of the problem you are having. What is the one thing that is causing all of your mental issues?.. You don't have any mental disorder or anything, but you are becoming self-conscious of yourself, and a sign that you will become a bit more mature in the near coming, when all of this is resolved. To go back to what I was saying, the main reason, the one thing that is causing you to be "depressed" is you feeling alone and socially being isolated. The cause of that?.. You know the answer, the smell. If you can fix this, you will be finding yourself talking to a lot of people and people will talk to you. There's many ways you can help yourself with the smell.. to make better of your hygiene you should start from your head. Is your hair normal smelling and is your oral hygiene fine? You should take a shower every day for at least 10 minutes, make sure you bring some body wash and use some shampoo for your hair. Brush your teeth Twice a day all over your teeth and rinse your mouth out every time you eat a meal. You can use some mints or gum to help out if going out. Also, if you have lots of acne, all you need to do is wash your face with cool water every morning and every night, also every time your done working out or doing any physical activities. No need for any creams, but if you don't want your face to become dry I guess you can use moisturizing cream or something. That should be great for the head hygiene. Now for majority of your body, neck to the feet are all taken care of by bathing or showering. Like I said, use some bar soaps or body wash. Take this shower in the morning, right before school, but you might have to wake up a bit earlier to eat breakfast.<br>  At this point you are pretty much done with the majority of the things you need to do. Now for the clothes, always wear clean clothes or iron them so they do not become wrinkly. Now the finishing touch should be some cologne.. Axe doesn't work. All men's cologne are great, and there is no need to buy expensive.. buy a bit cheaper because that's all you need and it'll last maybe 5 months before you buy more. Just like that bro, you are looking fresh and clean and everyone will come to you like a magnet, I'm sure it will work out in time. You can pretty much solve any problem, as complicated as you might think it is.. the solution can be simple. God Bless Friend!.. Keep looking fresh homie.|`|647d5d09dea3015f258c13a34983e878aa	Since you are seeing your doctor on Monday tell him (or her) that you have and odor that cannot be washed away and because of it you are not wanting to be around people. He or she may be able to give you some medication or suggest something to help. It might be a medical problem.|`|WGVX96Zpaa	Sounds serious. Definitely possible that its in your head, or it's some hormonal change in your body. Once you smell like something, your body gets used to the smell. I don't think I'm helping..<br>  <br>  What to tell your doctor? Print your question out and read it to him. Unless there's a psychiatrist on Yahoo! Answers, you're throwing a rock in the darkness.

b937058afbee356089c255590894d7c9aa	Chivalry was about courage, loyalty, honour and high moral standards.  One aspect was looking after those in need and those who required protection.  In those days, women were considered to require such protection. That probably doesn't so much apply any more.  But really, the attitude toward women was just one aspect of chivalry.  There is no reason at all not to adopt a moral code which honours courage, loyalty and service.  In fact, in today's world, it would be a very good thing.|`|He5XWnJtaa	Absolutely, feminism is about empowering women to have control of their destiny and the power to make decisions regarding their own lives.

Sure, it's nice to get a seat, but don't the men deserve their seats as well?<br>  <br>  I believe in basic good manners.

b919231cdc9dcf8edee5a210e4d7a40faa	That's exactly what I have, I'm a psychology student but the year before I got my BA, in psychology ironically enough, I realized I had Attention Deficit Disorder like crazy. I noticed my short attention span and the thought that I had ADD had crossed my mind for years but when I realized how much I spaced out I knew I had it. It feels like everyone is looking at me when I don't take my adderall-xr, it's called imaginary audience, I know this is the biological root of paranoia but what can you do? I'm rather obsessive at times, and I do waste a significant amount of time but I don't have any compulsions or rituals so I'm not technically OCD but these two things occur alongside each other quite frequently.<br>  <br>  When I took the ADD computer test it stopped scoring me and said I probably didn't understand the directions but I did perfectly, it's just that I zone out so much. This might apply to you, I'm doing a lot of research in the field, well mainly a literature crawl aha. Shoot me an email if you have any other questions.<br>  <br>  Do you think you could have ADD?

IF you truly didn't care if would bother you to be around others and you wouldn't be self conscious. A lot of people tell themselves that they don't care about what others think instead of admitting that they care and they don't know how to make the changes that they need to feel comfortable around others. Some times it takes a lot of courage and strength to face our deepest fears and to deal with them. There are times when it's a lot easier to deny our needs than to face them and to make the changes that we need.|`|cHYz36ocaa	I agree. I think the answer lies in the fact that many of the negative thought processes (ANTs) have become so internalized that they automatically pop up whenever you get into contact with people. It's like reflexes: if a car approaches me at high speed hopefully my reflexes will kick in making me jump out of the way in the last second. Same with your self-concious feelings: even if the ANTs aren't present at a conscious level in your mind, they are working sub-consciously on an automatic level.

9EVcTnUWaa	I would think so, the person with the higher intellect would probably get to the place where they wouldn't have much to say to the other or have things in common.  Getting along with someone is great, but you have to have a lot more than that to sustain a long term relationship. You have to be able to talk to each other and to share things together.  You have to be able to share some of the same friends and to want some of the same things in life.  IF your intellectual abilities are to different that might not be the case.  One person might be happy with being a person who does janitorial work and hanging out with friends at bars.  That's great we need people who do those things, but if they are with someone who wants to be an attorney for a large commercial law firm, they won't be working towards the same goals and plans.  They won't want to socialize with the same type of people and you might find the friends of the attorney looking down on the other persons friends.  That it self would cause tension in the relationship. I would think that there are to many differences for the relationship to last long term.

Definitely no little meek thing!|`|NYU37jfGaa	There aren't many characters in ancient literature who I can think of who are 'feminist' in the sense of champions of women's rights.<br>  <br>  Historically, there have been quite a few women who have been leaders, achieved power etc, but hardly any of them ever expressed any interest in women's rights.  One of the few I can think of is Aspasia, the companion of Pericles, who ruled Athens for many years.  Aspasia apparently influenced Plato in the writing of The Republic, in which he expressed the view that the female guardians should have equal rights to the males.<br>  <br>  There are some strong female characters in ancient literature, like the enchantress Circe for example in Homer's Odyssesy, who turns people into pigs, but I don't e xactly see her as feminist.  And Odysseus's wife Penelope is clever, outwitting her suitors by unravelling the tapestry every night etc, but she is famous mainly as a loyal wife, which is not normally considered a feminist attribute.<br>  <br>  I don't think any of the Greek goddesses could be described as feminist, they are nearly all subordinate to men, and the goddess Athena, although a virgin, is shown to be firmly patriarchal in the Orestia, where she announces that she is always on the side of the male.<br>  <br>  A character in Greek mythology who you might describe as feminist is Atalanta, who is a swift runner and can outrun any man.  But even she is in the end beaten by a man, who tricks her into stopping to pick up the golden apples.<br>  <br>  And of course there are folk heroines like the Chinese heroine Mulan for example, who was 'feminist' if you define that as a woman who proves she is as good as man, as Mulan does by becoming a general and saving China etc.<br>  <br>  Bede's 'Ecclesiastical History of th eEnglish People' written in the 8th century Ad, abounds with strong women, Christian Queens who convert their Pagan husbands, sainst who refuse to relinquish their virginity, powerful abbesses like Hilda of Whitby, who ruled double monasteries of monks and nuns.  They were 'feminist' if you define a feminist as a woman who exercises power.<br>  <br>  Elizabeth I was undoubtedly a strong ruler, but whether she could be described as a character in literature I don't know, though plenty of people have written about her.  Joan of Arc likewise is an historical character rather than a literary one I would have said, even though there have been plays written about her.|`|emOhSyY5aa	Cleopatra, Guinevere, Dito, Helen of Troy.|`|bGsXsDhBaa	Elizabeth I|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	Joan of Arc|`|uX4XEXGxaa	Athena, Hera, and other greek goddesses, along with pretty much every other goddess in ancient religion<br>  <br>  oddessyes'(I know i butchered the spelling) wife

Both lead to a termination of a pregnancy but in every day usage people tend to use 'lost the baby' because it didn't happen intentionally.<br>  <br>  Prarie Crone:  Spontaneous abortion is the medical term for a miscarriage.  A miscarriage is technically anything that results in a "failure to attain the just, right, or desired result," but in common usage it usually refers to the unintentional expulsion of a fetus before it is viable.|`|wgE9AhIsaa	Wow! These are seriously the most ignortant, hillbilly  answers I've ever seen in my life. Yes, you're right! A young woman should keep an infant even though she may never graduate from high school, she may be stuck with a bitter young man, she may never get the chance to learn and become an experienced mother fit to raise and love a child the proper way. Look around at our nation! People who are obsessed with images, who treat each other like dirt, and who don't value education.<br>   So since all of you seem to have no idea what the definition of these words mean allow me to provide the proper meaning for you.<br>  Terminate- to occur at or form the conclusion of (didn't see kill anywhere)<br>  Lost- no longer pocessed or retained<br>  ALSO a miscarriage is sometimes called a spontaneous abortion, meaning it happens without the direct decision to end the continuation of a group of cells, and the primary difference between a voluntary abortion. If anyone has taken an advanced anatomy and physiology class you would know what a fetus actually is the first three months of germination. (Another ignorant statement)<br>  Both situations are very sad, and very traumatic for the woman. I've never met someone who had an abortion and was proud or "overjoyed". <br>  By the way, sometimes the right thing is not always the easy thing to do. Mothers today need to spend more time bettering themselves so they may offer a better life for their children. If someone is unprepared to do that, it is the responsible choice to hold off on having children. As you know, fertilization can happen spontaneously, even when one has taken the proper precautions. <br>  I don't expect to change anyone's mind, I just hope if you are going to make statements about killing and such, you should do it in a manner that is intelligent, accurate, and with an open mind, unlike what you have all done.<br>  The choice should be the individual womans, not yours.|`|5bvchm04aa	Paterson, I see where you're going with this but; miscarriage is an accident, and abortion is a purposeful act. Not termination as in the assassination sense of the word, but intentional. Not like something you lost, which is out of your control.|`|B27oNdbNaa	No woman would be willing to talk about an abortion or miscarriage with someone as insensitive as you.<br>  Both are a loss of a child, and both are sensitive subjects to the woman personally experiencing either.|`|AA10192101	Well technically a miscairriage is a termination.  They both are.|`|N35ugaL8aa	because you don't choose a miscarriage.|`|YQOT68xFaa	Not always. There are women who don't really care when they miscarry and don't consider it a baby. And there are women who abort who know it's a baby and grieve over it for life.<br>  <br>  But at the same time...it is called a baby when it's wanted, and a fetus or a clump of cells when it's not. Evidently, the mother's feelings determine whether the baby is a living person or not. Kinda dumb. It is a living human whether it is wanted or not. But abortion is easier to accept when you pretend like there is no baby involved.<br>  <br>  <br>  Prairie Crone - "spontaneous abortion" is the medical term for a miscarriage. Basically your body aborts the baby because it is able to sense that it is nonviable. I don't like the term either though.|`|YwE5kIB8aa	no, an abortion is a triumph of individualism.  Hurray!  Nothing says progress like stabbing a fetus.|`|NYU37jfGaa	Because when she has a miscarriage it was a baby she was carrying.

Medically, there are "abortions." Period.  They are either intentional (induced) or unintentional / spontaneous (commonly called miscarriages...). Medical text books call it all "abortion."  But that tends to upset a woman who's just lost her prenancy via some accident of fate... <br>  <br>  Doctors only use "miscarriage" and "temination" to patients... in medical literature, it's ALL "abortion." Because that's what both are. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  In medical contexts, the word "abortion" refers to any process by which a pregnancy ends with the death and removal or expulsion of the fetus, regardless of whether it is spontaneous or intentionally induced. <br>  <br>  ~ Wikipedia (the med sources I have are probably a bit over YA's head...)|`|cdd57d1b18b8d82168928705079633ecaa	A miscarriage is a naturally occuring loss and tragedy whereas an abortion is a deliberate ending of the life of an unborn child-which is actually a killing. Just because our laws presently allow it does not mean it is ok. God creates life and it is His laws we have to obey.|`|1899aea197e9521ce9a275c00c477c75aa	Years ago when I had my two miscarriages... the Doctor wrote the words "spontaneous abortion" on the papers.

So why would he write that?|`|7LSonIoraa	terminate mean kill. miscarriage and abortion are vastly different. miscarriage happern without choice on the other hand they always a choice with abortion.|`|P1VXjLPOaa	All I know is that the mother of the miscarriage is sad.

NzR25cQAaa	Try making yourself more tired before you fall asleep<br>  <br>  More fatigue, maybe you're mind will keep in sync.|`|7sdK02CBaa	You could possibly be experiencing night terrors.  Generally, night terrors are handled subconsciously when the body relaxes so much that its telling itself that it's dead.  Your mind then responds by telling you to scream and wake up.  The only problem is that you are in stage four sleep, where you are in such a deep sleep that even incessant screaming and shaking will not wake you.  I haven't heard of conscious night terrors, but I presume it wouldn't be impossible.<br>  <br>  Another possible explanation for your inability to move your body is that when you enter into REM sleep, or random eye movement sleep, your body is paralyzed.  This is a natural defense mechanism to prevent you from acting out your dreams while you sleep (the body is easily awoken during REM sleep).  If your body had gone into REM sleep, but your mind was still consciously aware, it would naturally be difficult to wake up.<br>  <br>  As for a solution, go to bed before you get over-tired and stick to a rigid sleep schedule.  Make sure you are getting plenty of sleep each night.|`|KdiW40eIaa	Contact a sleep study center.They will hook you up to monitoring equiptment.Probably only way you will find answers and maybe solution to your problem.|`|AA10471659	Its called sleep paralysis.

IJTcGIG7aa	Directly - you can blame a real estate bubble, which the banks bet everything on through mortgage backed securities.    This all served as the gasoline.....the spark was a cyclical downturn.<br>  <br>  That's what triggered everything, but the true issues go the fundamental flaws with our economy.    Here are the flaws:<br>  <br>  Deregulation run amok.   Call it greed, but you had the banks writing bankruptcy law under Bush (they tried first in 2000, and succeeded in 2005).    Bush also stopped any real investigation into predatory lending laws....basically shady practices by the mortgage industry.   <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/13/AR2008021302783.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/con...</a><br>  <br>  The real problem with deregulation is that the people lost their voice.   Monied interests....corporate interests....have too much say.   They operate on the short term (profits) and could care less about the nation or its people.....yet they have more pull than the people.<br>  <br>  The increasing gulf between the rich and the poor is a major factor.    This started in 1980 with Reagonomics (when the average CEO made 8 times what their employees made....now that number is 400).   It was expedited  by globalization, and the subsequent weakening of Unions.    What it's actually resulting in is a destruction of our middle class.....we are heading towards a Mexico style economy (very rich & very poor, with no one in the middle.....very fast).     The problem here is that we DO NOT HAVE THE JOBS anymore that will let people spend our way out of this downturn.<br>  <br>  Irresponsible debt.....STARVE THE BEAST.    This is the Republican policy in which they run MASSIVE budget deficits in order to bankrupt the country....so that we don't have the money to (as they say) 'waste' it on stuff like health care or education.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starve_the_beast" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starve_the_...</a><br>  <br>  I wish I was making that up, but that's the reason every Republican going back to Reagan has set a new record for budget deficits.    It's the reason the only President to balance the budget (and set record surpluses) was Democrat Bill Clinton.    Clinton also increased discretionary spending slower than anyone since Reagan too.    Reagan AND G W Bush both increased spending faster in 2 years....than Clinton did in ALL 8 he was in office.<br>  <br>  This debt cripples our budget.    Bush ran up 6 TRILLION -- mostly during good economic times.   The interest on this debt doesn't stimulate our economy - it cripples it.

AA12360662	Yes, indeed, every dream means something.  <br>  <br>  First of all, your ex was part of your life and that is a fact.  That may lurk into your subconscious mind and becomes symbol of love and need.  <br>  <br>  Due to the fact that you had some relationship before, the current relationship may not pop into your subconscious mind that quickly.  In your subconscious mind, it may take time to get over the last relationship.  But at the same time, the last relationship may just be a symbol of what you need in your current relationship now.  Love and Trust.
4Wstmk2oaa	The guy is most likley just making it up to see your . If he has a girlfriend he obviously needs to get over you or dump her. Maybe should tell him its not gonna happen. But I do think he made up the dream.|`|533aec411376adde47ba86f66a0aa949aa	Marriage is really a formal way of acknowledging bonds, cementing the relationship. Since he does have feelings for you in some way, the dream was his way of trying to reconcile those feelings while holding onto his girlfriend.<br>  <br>  It doesn't necessarily mean he wants to marry you but he isn't at the point where he is able to give you up and choose his gf. Think about a kid and their blanket. Its THEIR blanket, and they carry it with them, forever and ever and ever. The more someone tries to take their blanket away, the harder they hold onto it, even if the person taking it away is themselves.<br>  <br>  Maybe the level of intimacy he has with you is stronger than the intimacy he has with his gf. In that regard, what he's looking for isn't necessarily to be with you (especially if you don't want to be with him) but a relationship that has that. If column A is great, but doesn't want anything to do with you, and column B wants to be with you, but isn't all that great, you start looking for a column C. Since he can't see a column C yet, he still thinks he needs to hold onto column A for awhile.|`|3qbD3cDKaa	according to what you culture is<br>  if ur superstitious, dreams usually mean the opposite<br>  if ur religious, it seems like u guys hav a shot at being more than jst friends

Generally we are doing what you seem to have in mind: some kind of role play or role reversal in the bedroom.<br>  My wife is always on top. We found out that it is a more intensive intercourse that way. For me, as a crossdresser, I love it to be taken like a girl  (toys included).. Sometimes we are doing it the "traditional" way, sometimes like a Lesbian couple.<br>  Apart from the crossdressing practises, it can be very exciting and enjoyable for a man when the woman is controlling moves and intensity. There may be submissive feelings connected, and being on top in the bedroom can well lead to some power exchange outside the bedroom as well. But it must not come to that, as we know from like-minded friends.  Reversed roles in the bedroom often mean for the woman to experience some hidden inclinations they didn′t know or dare so far.<br>  Give it a try !

AA10779574	If you look at both the participants and the audience of "jazz" over its history, likely some demographic shifts would be observable.  An educated guess is that the early existance of jazz was a comunal activity of people making music for other people who they knew. Skipping much of jazz's origins, looking at the late 19th century performing jazz was an activity that was done live and with people of a nearby community. The technology for recording a performance didn't exist, so your music came from a performer who likely knew you as much as you them. With recording technology in the later early 20th century, jazz could be enjoyed without having to associate with the people who were unjustly outcasted as culturally depraved - thanks to the phonograph.  Jazz creation has became a commercial enterprise rather than a construction between individuals who knew each other. Now performers are rewarded for performing according to commercial criteria created by enterprises who a anticipating demand for a product, rather than performers creating something that that is shared between the performer and a group of people that the performer knows personally.

Kil7sZUSaa	A compulsive liar is someone who lies constantly out of habit.  Another term is a chronic or habitual liar.<br>  <br>  A pathological liar, on the other hand, lies to have his way, to manipulate things.

A compulsive liar is defined as someone who lies out of habit. Lying is their normal and reflexive way of responding to questions. Compulsive liars bend the truth about everything, large and small. For a compulsive liar, telling the truth is very awkward and uncomfortable while lying feels right. Compulsive lying is usually thought to develop in early childhood, due to being placed in an environment where lying was necessary. In other words, your friend keeps lying to seek a humorous reaction from others, and enjoys seeing people laugh. <br>  <br>  Don't mistake this with a pathological liar. A pathological liar is usually defined as someone who lies incessantly to get their way and does so with little concern for others. Pathological lying is often viewed as coping mechanism developed in early childhood and it is often associated with some other type of mental health disorder. A pathological liar is often goal-oriented (i.e., lying is focused - it is done to get one's way). Pathological liars have little regard or respect for the rights and feelings of others. A pathological liar often comes across as being manipulative, cunning and self-centered. His lies don't hurt anyone, right?<br>  <br>  I've also heard the terms habitual liar, and chronic liar as well. Both mean about the same thing as compulsive liar. Hope that helped : )|`|AA10059022	Some ppl think when they lie but r "being funny" they r just "kidding around."

AA10779574	Swearing is interpreted in a variety of ways across individuals. Some see it as a proxy for status or intelligence. Some people also pervieve it as verabl aggressiveness and find it offensive in that the speaker subjects them to a level of conversation in which the listener would rather not be part of. Being a profligate f-bomb dropper myself, and also being a university professor has presented me with many near misses and one instance where the deed was done.<br>    A health care environment is a similar situation where you are dealing with people who are unfamiliar with you, so more readily make assumptions about your intentions by the choice of semantics a speaker chooses. The conflict arises from this misinterpretation (or possibly accurate interpretation) of the swearers intentions.

Ignore such enticements and try to find one, just one thing a day that you like about your wife or some attribute that you appreciate about her. However, if you don't have respect enough for her, and yourself ,to honor your commitment to her, and each other ,you should explain to her why you can't stay married and let her out of your legal and moral agreement you made when you got married and allow her to find a man that can honor her and be true.

The first group to move out of Africa and settle in Europe would likely not have been dalmatian croats, due to sheer geography. The "first" europeans likely came in from the asian steps of the former Soviet republics, according to the most recent genetic testing (see Spencer Wells work with the National Geographic Genome project.) The dalmatian croats may very well be an old group, in the sense that they may have remained in the same area for an extremely long time leading to the genetic isolates you mentioned. Like the Basques, they could have retained their genetic uniqueness due to isolation and endogamy.

X9EqGyENaa	1) I'm very clever and am quite good with words, so people don't usually have too much of a problem understanding me. I do tend to jump around a lot, and one story will remind me of another, and i'll get easily sidetracked. <br>  <br>  2) I don't have any problems understanding others (as long as it's not in another language!) Often times, I'll interrupt people or jump to conclusions about what they're saying. <br>  <br>  3) No I pay attention to my surroundings TOO much. I notice freakish things that no one else does sometimes. However, mundane tasks and things bore me quickly...which is why i direct my attention else where and start noticing little things. <br>  <br>  I'm very forgetful and "absent minded". Yesterday I had an essay due and I actually stapled every page after the first one upside down. I also leave keys everywhere, I'm very disorganized. <br>  <br>  Homework is very frustrating, to say the least.  Sometimes I read things 10 times and I don't comprehend what's being said.  Math problems are the worst. I give up easily when I don't understand things quickly. <br>  <br>  The best way to describe it would be the inability to establish consistency  in my thoughts. I form strange connections and think very randomly. Before I have finished thinking something out, another idea has entered my head. Also, I'm unable to relax or stop thinking sometimes. In addition, I procrastinate in ways that are unthinkable to most people!!

Or on the other hand, stay really good. It seems chaotic and random but its not really. Its all just part of the human goal, to experience all things, to live to see all paths. Suffering is part of the path. It shouldn't be all of it though. On the deepest level we are all human and all humans at their core don't want suffering. Everyone wants to be happy and wants to eliminate suffering. If you wish to suffer less, do good things, live with compassion for others, treat yourself well, your actions will ripple. They don't just effect you, they will spread. In conclusion, life is what you make of it. All things that confront you is a test. Some more challenging than others, they all can be overcome, and keep in mind the secret. The meaning of life is to live, enlighten yourself, and experience. Don't let difficult times and trials harden your heart, let them soften it.|`|BqMurpuKaa	i know how u feel its the same with me but itz ok u will get thru it and gosh math is boring and pointless i get ur point with the money thing thats its just paper but it has value 2 almsot every1 who lives in the US! so just sort it out just let out all ur feelings i write essays about it or just get a mentor they help! grab a friend see there view of life|`|McWAhEOHaa	i feel the EXACT SAME sometimes. it's like we spend years and years going through work getting a well paying job saving up to retire hopefully with someone we love then we die. it all just ends like that. i hate it. i wish we didn't have to die and we could just continue going to work coming home and seeing our loved ones every single day for the rest of forever.|`|FxjC72QVaa	I know exactly where your comin from kid!

I see it as the only point in living is making life better. That's why we get higher educations, to find cures, entertainment, technology, etc.  There is no significant reason, you live then die as newer generations come in. <br>  Money is basically like trading a good for a good. Instead of trading a computer for like 200 video games, you give them money. It's easier and it's just how it works. Oh yes, most money is cotton, not paper.<br>  And stuff happens. You basically have to deal with it. It's just how organisms were made, to survive. Our brains give us pleasure when we fight for survival, like eating and having sex. Our brain expresses pain to keep us from harming our body.  It's just how everything plays out. o.0 It's very odd and complicated after you think about it.|`|4bWUiIVdaa	Life's a b*tch and then you die|`|fc5a2676d0a9ea687d91d44050637158aa	ur perception is your reality? its what you make it?<br>  <br>  <br>  finish school after elementary are you serious?<br>  <br>  if you think that the world is suppose to bow down to you, WAKE UP no one is exempt from hardships in this world.|`|335fe4710acf4688b012e53b7cf8a1bdaa	Join the rest of the population of anti depressants.<br>  Here's the thing kid, either look at life that way or be optimistic.|`|wvrMda78aa	actually <br>  I agree, school is pretty much pointless and we are all slaves to the governmental system which is deisigned to create the facade that if we work hard enuff we can have so much , its all bull crap!|`|Q51be8Opaa	The point of life is to lead people to God, we are ambassadors!

1fruneZ1aa	I'm flattered. I try to give honest, heartfelt advice. I'm 46 years old and I've<br>  been through a lot and I love it when a younger woman seeks and respects my opinions. No, it's not weird- it's smart!|`|NnG5GBGAaa	Why would that be weird?<br>  you're right, young, immature, girls can be mean. and yes... most younger, immature "boys",(not men) have just one thing on their minds, and its not "intelligent conversation".<br>  <br>  So you like having someone mature, and wise to talk with that's not after cybersex, and wont be mean to you.<br>  Whats wrong with that?|`|LR48Rtv2aa	There is nothing weird about that.|`|B27oNdbNaa	Nope not weird.|`|VVyCuEFraa	No its not weird. its not exactly usual but not its not weird and i know exactly what you mean boys are immature perverted and disgusting and young girls are hurtful and vindictive and like to spread rumors and what i like to call "drama wars" so no you're not weird at all you just like someone mature and unbiased who will listen to your feelings and opinions and give an honest opinion about it.|`|80YPHmm7aa	No, not weird at all. I remember talking to the "older folk" when I was young, and I still do. The thing is this... They've been there; done that.<br>  Older women generally have had a lot of life experience, and have a lot of wisdom to share.|`|RE4AaDQBaa	I don't think that it's weird, and it probably isn't all that unusual. You feel more comfortable with them, and you know that experience will be much more for them. I try not to be creepy...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  jk!|`|rWoaRdljaa	im not immature!!

K5IOSGXAaa	I like to compare it to a filing clerk going through the filing cabinets. You know it's there somewhere but it takes time to find it. Meanwhile your clerk is going through the files looking for it. A lot of times you forgot it was there but the clerk finds it and puts it on your desk. LOL So no you aren't weird or yep I'm weird too, but I know what you are talking about.|`|874EAxkfaa	you know it's wrong to do ,but you also know how to get around that.
AA12219135	I think you're confusing the health care field with the health insurance industry.<br>  The health insurance industry, whether they claim to be or not is money/profit driven...<br>  Until a method is proved to be able to save money in the long run, they are inclined to deny it as frivolous or "not cost effective"|`|AwKLdiKdaa	I dont think i understand your question.
QEuhPEb7aa	When a person has a problem, the mind has 4 levels of defense mechanisms.<br>  <br>  They are classified as follows: Level 1 is the least adaptive up to level 4 which is the most adaptive.<br>  <br>  Level I - are the psychotic defenses<br>  <br>  Level 2 - are the immature defenses<br>  <br>  Level 3 - are the neurotic defenses<br>  <br>  Level 4 - are the mature defenses<br>  <br>  Talking to yourself is known as phantasy defense on the 3rd level. Phantasy defense is escaping to an imaginary world, talking to an imaginary being and/or talking to yourself. Talking to yourself is the mildest manifestation of phantasy defense.<br>  <br>  Take note that phantasy defense is a bit normal because you do not lose touch of reality.<br>  <br>  Talking to yourself is known however as delusional projection on the 1st level. This time you do lose touch with reality. You believe that your imaginary world is real. You talk with imaginary beings, you talk with yourself and you believe that these delusions are real. <br>  <br>  This is the time that talking to yourself is a mental illness.|`|K1oOQqqVaa	Because it is one.|`|9mBUqSZhaa	Some assume that because you're talking to yourself, you "hear voices" or "see imaginary people." <br>  <br>  I think it's stupid, honestly. If you want to talk to yourself; well, be my guest. Who could you trust more than yourself?|`|df56ca79f426d12c4a6737af42e04037aa	i think people only jokingly say that people who talk to themselves are crazy.  deep down inside i don't think most people actually believe that.  i know i don't.  i live alone and i talk to myself on occasion.  sometimes i do it to better understand something that's on my mind.  in no way do i consider myself crazy.|`|D6Xfc5Wtaa	Talking to yourself is not a sign of mental illness, talking to imaginary people that you actually think are real is a sign of mental illness.|`|15a091aaac1a8ad452d92f5a93d4c2deaa	It's more, talking to some you think is nearby but actually isn't, hence a hallucination.  And hallucination says crazy bigtime.|`|AA10471659	No. At times it can be the only intelegent conversation you have all day.  Hearing voices is a problem but you are not mentally ill just talking to yourself.|`|QUJ4F5Boaa	Everyone talks to themselves but if you're having full on incomprehensible-can't-stop conversation with yourself there may be some mental health issues.|`|8pG8Y3rJaa	I don't know if it is.  I only know that I do it sometimes because I live alone AND I CAN!
AA12360662	1.  Being attacked physically in dream could mean you are feeling criticized and hurt emotionally in dream.    Projecting not able to move because you were paralyzed symbolizes lack of control and lack of confidence.<br>  <br>  2.  Running for fun in dream without any pain can reflect the control you want to have in reality. The hidden meaning may be about things you can't control and you want to take charge.<br>  <br>  3. Being pregnant with someone else's child may come from burden you have in reality.  You are feeling the need to take some responsibilities in some way.  Whether it is done voluntarily, there is also hint about some control you want to take.<br>  <br>  Putting them together,  you may be feeling lack of control, low in self confidence and that is why you had these dreams vent out.|`|FSCngWa6aa	I have an obsession with dreaming and dreams and the subconscious mind!  I have taken oh so many courses and studied so much of this stuff.<br>  <br>  The one about you running could (and most likely is) you just re-inacting your everyday life through a dream. <br>  <br>  The one about you being attacked could mean you feel as if someone is out to get you.  OR could mean you are afriad you arn't strong enough. OR could mean you are afraid of being paralyzed.<br>  <br>  The alternative to that one is, you are replaying something that has happened in a movie/tv show/book/ commercial you read or saw and just placing yourself in it.<br>  <br>  The one about you being pregnant could mean 1) You don't want a kid but you want to experience having a baby [odd, I know]  2) You feel guilty because you didn't do something right in your relationship with your friend or sister.  or 3) You feel as if in the future you want to help people by doing that.<br>  <br>  The alternative to the attacked one would go the same for the pregnant one.<br>  <br>  That is what I know! Hope I helped! =]

mGfQapDxaa	you might have creeps being drawn to you because you are too nice/friendly. most people won't give creeps the time of day, but if you feel obligated to be polite to they they will latch on to you and suck you dry emotionally. i used to attract creeps too for years because i would allow myself to get sucked into conversations with weird people i'd rather avoid-people others avoided. eventually, i learned that if someone is really freaky you have to distance yourself from them even if it seems rude. don't get into the habit of saying hi to them even. look busy when they pass you and if they try to talk let them know that you have work to do so you have to go or something. it's pretty sad that you have to lie and be rude to get rid of creeps, but it seems to be the only thing that works|`|Q8etYn60aa	This is weird because I'm a 21 y/o female I seriously have that same exact problem!  I get all the creepers, my friends know me for attracting creepy men.  I've been told that I'm too friendly and nice.  I'm a very flirtatious person with pretty much everyone.  I guess you just have to watch yourself around people you don't know well, because you never know who's gonna turn out to be a totaly creep.|`|E6CShQfKaa	I understand totally. When I come out, all the freaks and crackpots of the world follow me around like a puppy dog. It is very creepy! They attract to me and seek ME out. I just try to laugh it off and avoid them. If it gets really bad, get a restraining order. GOOD LUCK! Don't let the abnormal ones get you down!|`|yJRqi20Waa	Hi there,<br>  <br>  yes I have the same issues as you, ( I'm 20 ) <br>  most of the time ignoring them will do the job, <br>  but with the more persistence ones just look at them straight in the eye and say your busy or not interested and move away<br>  <br>  the one I use most is I'm busy. <br>  since saying your not interested might poke them into striking a conversation.|`|vtFbGgTRaa	Where do you meet these creepers? I will come back and elaborate after you give me this info|`|533aec411376adde47ba86f66a0aa949aa	And just exactly who are the creepy unstable guys supposed to be drawn to, 90 year old ladies going to bingo?<br>  <br>  Saying you've gained alot of confidence suggests you weren't always so confident, which means that you are actually still putting out 'vulnerability' vibes, which probably resulted from unresolved childhood issues that are still affecting you.<br>  <br>  Here is something else to think about: why is it you only notice the creepy unstable guys? People who have self-confidence spend more of their time and energy on the positive interactions in their life, not the negative ones. The fact that these are getting to you suggests why they might be drawn towards you; you acknowledge their existence.<br>  <br>  Creepy people instinctively understand human behavior. They know that even if you look your nose down at them, but run away, that you're really more insecure (and wanting them to go away) than secure (and willing to do what is necessary to MAKE them go away.) Wanting someone to go away, but feeling like you can't, is a creepy person's wet dream.<br>  <br>  And attractive people 'attract' more kinds of people: it's kind of the point. The bigger your bucket, the more water you scoop out of the ocean, which means the higher chance you'll likely scoop up things you don't like. Get aggressive and public, make them feel the heat openly, and most will scurry quickly away.|`|L6U1joGAaa	I know exactly what you mean. I think the important thing is NEVER GO OUT ALONE and  be able to separate the good guys from the bad. I know that a couple of years ago my favorite places to go were the bars and the occasional night club and guess what? That's where the bad guys or guys who aren't using there best judgment know they will find you. Drinking is fun but no matter how good of a drinker you think you are, drinking or even being in a place where everybody else is drinking makes them think you are vulnerable. When your looking to settle down defiantly don't go with anybody you meet at one of those places and until then just be careful and pass judgment on EVERYONE.|`|sgjjwXwwaa	Well theres a lot of guys out there around your age that are still trying to figure out how to be comfortable with women... It's not easy for every guy to figure out the Do's and Dont's...<br>  <br>  You're probably not doing anything wrong at all. Just being attractive and friendly is all it takes.<br>  <br>  Don't be afraid to be really up front and clear with Men how you feel. Screw feelings, draw a diagram if you have to if you're really creeped out or put off by a guy.<br>  <br>  ...Maybe get some pepper spray too.|`|AA10471659	You are just open and friendly. This can make some unstable men think you are into them. they read your friendliness as an invitation to get to be romantically involved. You have to adopt a different attitude with them, no smiles no long chats and just keep moving. They see you are like a goddess that is interested in them when you stop and talk to them.|`|15a091aaac1a8ad452d92f5a93d4c2deaa	My immediate reaction is: Get some martial arts training.  Buy some pepper spray for your purse and learn how to use it.  Go out in public but be wise in exactly where you go; in other words, don't go to places where you will be vulnerable to aggression.  Also, develop a set of caustic remarks to discourage advances you don't want. Verbal Judo is quite effective...   <a href="http://www.verbaljudo.org/verbaljudogovernmentcourse.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.verbaljudo.org/verbaljudogove...</a><br>  <br>  Also, if you have a good friend, female or male--male preferred--ask him, this question: "What is it about me that makes me seem vulnerable?"<br>  <br>  This book can help you re-program your thinking and thus increase confidence...<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ten-Days-Self-Esteem-David-Burns/dp/0688094554/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1228412930&sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Ten-Days-Self-Este...</a><br>  If you go to the above website,  be sure to page down and read the reader reviews.

0wBIlxdraa	Actually, "laissez faier" is a French phrase that means "leave it alone".  In economics it describes a philosophy that opposes government intervention in markets.  On the other other hand, a "mixture of the market economy" describes a situation where both market activity and government intervention in markets affect economic activity.  Pretty much all economies are "mixed economies".  For example, in the U.S. there are private markets for health care, but the government also intervenes in this market with programs like Medicare and Medicaid.
0wBIlxdraa	A supply schedule is a table that lists the quantity of a good supplied at different prices.  Since it is a table, price and quantity supplied are variables that take on discrete values.  On the other hand, a supply curve is a graph (or an equation) that shows the quantities of a good supplied at different prices.  So a supply curve treats quantities supplied and prices as continuous variables.

They were not born that way, they learned.|`|MTqimWfEaa	There is no evidence to support that homosexuality is "learnt" or learned.|`|McWAhEOHaa	ok. say for example you're put into foster care, then you get adopted by 2 homosexuals the same gender as you. if you're like 2 or 3 years old, you're going to grow up seeing 2 guys/girls together and you're gonna think that's how you're supposed to do things

7c47435ed764615f7c9efed94837c93faa	Not socializing and preferring your own company does not truly scream SOCIOPATH to me.  It is more that you simply have no conscience about anything.  Not only do you not grieve for your loved one who passed, but when they were alive you would have no problem with hurting them (physically, emotionally etc) if it helped to further your own "happiness".  It means you don't have a conscience and you feel no guilt at all.<br>  A good example is this<br>  If you had a child (I know you are young, let's say a pet)<br>  And you had the choice to either buy your pet food with the last 2 dollars in your pocket, or buy yourself a cup of coffee and your pet got nothing to eat for the day at all: you choose the coffee AND don't even think about it again after the choice is made.<br>  You feel not a moment of "I hope my pet isn't starving" or "I bet fido's tummy hurts since I didn't feed him".<br>  Anyway, if you truly are a Sociopath then I'm sure you will have no trouble finding someone out there like you. (although most prefer to hide it and mimic other people emotion so probably wouldn't admit it to you) You would be shocked at how many there are.  It's something like 1 in 25 people.|`|df56ca79f426d12c4a6737af42e04037aa	the definition of a sociopath is "a person, as a psychopathic personality, whose behavior is antisocial and who lacks a sense of moral responsibility or social conscience."  is this really you?  what makes you fit this definition?|`|MTqimWfEaa	A doctor who diagnosis herself has a fool for a patient.|`|NzR25cQAaa	I'm 17 also and I think I may have a form of antisocial schizophrenia.<br>  <br>  It helps to know there are others like me..
6810e02779e654863b71475b91405d0aaa	Electricity was more important.  We already had efficient transportation (ships, trains, trucks for moving goods and  mass transit in cities) by 1920 and personal cars were still a luxury item. Electricity meant people could do useful work at night and use a variety of labor saving devices. It also made tall building possible because of elevators.
MTqimWfEaa	Bake cookies.  Use those easy ones that come in a tube and you just have to put them in a pan.  Ask your mom for help if needed. Then call her up and invite her over for cookies and milk.  Use her favorite cookies if you can.  If you don't know her favorite cookies, use chocolate chip, it's popular.|`|K5IOSGXAaa	I agree with the answer about the cookies. Just spend as much time with her as possible and do things to take her mind off her problems, think up stuff - ask your mom to help- you are a good friend and she won't forget it.|`|03xi1bToaa	give her something that shes been dying for like one of ur shirts that she wants, i cheered up my friend like that, even though it is kind of like a bribe....
HWT7thUkaa	well the brain is the only one can interpret colors, and since the person is blind, it makes no sense that they could dream in a colorful scenery. if no rods or cones can be used to see "light" and colors, then the brain would have no idea on what to compare them to or how to even classify them. blind people have no scheme for colors.|`|f7PlvV4Baa	good question :)<br>  <br>  idk i wonder if they even "see" things in their dreams or its just all the other senses.|`|PXfUyd5aaa	No, they dream in Game Boy monochrome.|`|S5rX1rX2aa	that's really interesting question!!!!|`|sSUjLhyLaa	whooothat'shats a really good questin; i've never thought that!|`|9KE4dvmkaa	not sure. i starred it so i will know too.
iNtPA7X9aa	Ohmygosh no! <br>  Please, please, please don't feel this way. In this case, it's NOT your fault--it's your therapist's. A therapist should not be talking to you that way, she needs to be there to support you. If you call her quite often, she must know and understand that there is something wrong, and she must have handled the situation in a more appropriate manner. This therapist seems like an a**hole. If you need to, find a new one. <br>  But in NO way is this your fault. At all. Don't blame yourself for something you can't control. It's not fair for you.|`|SouPhkgxaa	Aww,,<br>  Life isnt easy.<br>  <br>  Just face your fears, but dont annoy her. <br>  Talk to your family or teachers.<br>  <br>  Life is full of adventures and disappointments.<br>  <br>  When life gets hard you just gotta try your best and live through it.<br>  <br>  Everybody knows that dying is NEVER the answer.<br>  <br>  One day you will find your true love.<br>  Somebody that will understand you.<br>  <br>  If your a kid, keep going to school, dont give up.<br>  <br>  And nobody is stupid and weak.<br>  Were all special in our own way.<br>  God loves you. And he thinks your special. Dont ever forget that.<br>  <br>  <br>  I WISH YOU THE BEST!! =] =]
1wIek546aa	Prone, yes, though i would think it's not a conscious choice. Much like the submissive person, who may not be searching for abuse but a much needed sense of security.<br>  <br>  A very smart man once told me "be wary of blind attraction". if the pull is damn near Irresistable and unexplainable, there is a pretty good chance that the person is bad for you and is just appealing to your self destructive nature<br>  <br>  EDIT- the obvious "exception to the rule" here is the psychopath...who will most certainly consciously search for a victim. most abusers aren't psychopaths.|`|DQgFOR6Paa	'Dominant' is not the same as 'abusive'; however being "submissive" will accommodate both of these. So I'd argue that it is women's submissiveness (and overall lack of ability) which more allows for men to be dominant or abusive- rather than men being dominant/abusive forcing women to be submissive.|`|NnG5GBGAaa	Well of course abusive men seek out submissive women.<br>  Just like a rapist seeks out his victim.<br>  Personally, I like to keep my love for dominance & submission in the bedroom, or in his office.<br>  I just couldn't live my life being controlled, but there are definitely people who live that lifestyle.|`|NhMfGXmxaa	Of course they do. they "test" their partners early on to determinie how much they will take, applying the thumb screws more and more to see if the abused will break or run.|`|c77cjTOeaa	Yes, of course they do.  They choose their victims carefully, not at random.|`|AuDzLYWjaa	um men just want sex thats it. save that crap for oprah|`|bc34ec59002a028af03455eb88fd84ebaa	i think the men who are aware that they are abusive and seek out submissive females are SICK.<br>  <br>  but personally, i think abusive men somehow are not abusive at first but become abusive - for some reason - during the relationship. i dont know...maybe they keep the monster hidden and it comes out later when they are in difficult circumstances or they are provoked.|`|uxwSd0KLaa	Bill congrats ; its impossible to give a better and more true explanation of those who are abuse|`|15a091aaac1a8ad452d92f5a93d4c2deaa	"Do you believe that abusive men seek out women who have more of a submissive nature or not?" I do believe such men seek out submissive women.  In fact, a lot of non-submissive types will take off with the first sign of violent abuse, some at any type of abuse.  Also, I feel that too many women seek out a "strong man" but fall for a man who is "strong" in a criminal and abusive way.  So the lady's hope for a loving, protective man backfires.  Sad but true.|`|NYU37jfGaa	You seem to be assuming that 'dominant' and 'abusive' automatically go together.  Have you any evidence to back up this claim?|`|sfn6SpbCaa	All I can say is that it is quite worry some; especially after you read this.<br>  <a href="http://wiki.answers.com/Q/How_do_abusive_men_treat_submissive_wives" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.answers.com/Q/How_do_abusive...</a>|`|bEHRh1lgaa	Im a dominant woman who seeks submissive men.<br>  I like to beat them.
AA12360662	Sometimes things may seem religious in the dream may have nothing to do with religion.  It may be there because you had some religious background.<br>  <br>  Projecting yourself digging through tunnels and search for lost book may symbolize support you are seeking. You are feeling the need to find something that may not belong to you in reality.  That reflects how much you want to be recognized in reality.  <br>  <br>  It is more than things you want to find, this book is a symbol of things that is not easy to get.  In other words, you may be feeling stress, helpless sometimes, but you want to take control on things which may be out of your ability in reality and you vent it out in this dream.|`|ZMQLV1t4aa	maybe since its becoming stronger its something that will come true. Not literally but usually dreams symbolize other things. So maybe you are looking for something. It could be small like a job or what you want to be in life. and you feel you have to find it soon. The book could be the symbol for whatever it is you want to find. And the recurring dream could mean you will soon find it. I'm just guessing.|`|e5zOkZqIaa	This to me sounds like the lord telling you to look and find the other religion.  These are the exact kind of dreams I got before joining the Mormon religion.  Not that exact one, but ones where I was looking to find something else.<br>  <br>  This is so weird because your story in your dream is almost exactly what happened to Joseph Smith, the founder of the Mormon Church.<br>  <br>  He was contacted by angel Moroni, then he went to hill camora and dug until he found the gold plates which were soon translated into the Book of Mormon.<br>  <br>  I think you owe it to yourself and the lord to at least look into other religions, including ours with an open heart.  I think what you've heard on the news and from your friends and everyone else about us is probably wrong.|`|533aec411376adde47ba86f66a0aa949aa	You're searching for the reason you are drawn to Hinduism, duh.<br>  <br>  You aren't looking for the 'lost' book of Kali, you are looking for the lost reason inside yourself for being drawn to Kali. But since people have a hard time accepting that the thing they are looking for is so prosaic, they turn it into a great big 'treasure' hunt.<br>  <br>  Do you really think spirituality is contained in a book? Is Kali-ma found beneath the Earth or on it's surface? Spiritual metaphors of being 'buried' and 'rising again' are not just found in Christianity. Many-armed larvae, fight your way out of your cocoon.|`|gplfqOEHaa	U c in dreams its NOT always what u c is waht it is. Kali might not be God like and the book of kali might not be THE book.<br>  <br>  I say MIGHT and the reason is that there are only two reasons for which a human will go underground, one to search and the other is that he is dead.<br>  <br>  There could be hence only one conclusion of your dream. <br>  <br>  Death = being mislead.<br>  Search = search for truth in order to be alive.|`|kxmp3M58aa	maybe you should go to your pastor and see what he thinks|`|rNE7XAmgaa	Go do that, that sounds like a book i read on that , the Shepard or seomthing like that lol.

Raising kids is the hardest thing I've ever done, and I'm just starting out! It won't get easier for a long time. But there isn't anything more important than that.<br>  <br>  I would also add "being a loving wife to my husband" to that list as well. He is no less important to me than our children!|`|0n04tIJ6aa	Getting my mother to quit smoking after 40 years. Myself after 10 yrs. <br>  <br>  After helping my mother, I helped 7 other close friend / family to quit the habit. We all did it together, though I initiated the effort they too put in their own. It wasn't easy but we supported each other.<br>  <br>  Side effect was, we all gained a little weight, but atleast we won't hear ourselves coughing and weezing. ;)|`|AKvLiwB6aa	wow...  i guess id say my bigest acomplishment so far was finishing high school...  i jus barely made it...  lol...  an there was so much bad stuff going on in my life back then...  i thot for sure id have to drop out an go for my ged...  but insted i tuffed it out...  an finly made it...   yeah!!!|`|uXqDYPNVaa	Producing and co-hosting a political affairs program for my college radio station.|`|qPlx1Ejhaa	Surviving the many setbacks that life has thrown me.|`|P1VXjLPOaa	I'm in the processes right now.

kKfmbOzlaa	Insecurities can cause corruption in a person, thus they feel the need to take control of a person the same way insecurities take control of them.|`|iNtPA7X9aa	they don't have self-confidence.<br>  they gain satisfaction from putting others down.|`|juG7X5gyaa	I don't know, but I could ask my ex-husband!  Men try controlling women too much!|`|QbMC1h0gaa	they are probably narcissistic. Something probably happened in their childhood. Probably from his childhood, theres something called the second stage of erikson's psychology theory(Autonomy vs Shame and DOubt). WHen they were young, they probably were shameful that they couldnt make their own choices or control themselves and this behavior developed to adulthood.They want the power to control others and they are blinded by their behavior.|`|aIEJvhkjaa	People right now are fighting somewhere, and it doesnt even matter why they are fighting, because it all comes down to one thing: Control. Why do people want to so desperately control others? What do we have to gain for treating others this way? Maybe a short lived feeling of power over<br>   an individual, but this is only a guise, brought on by intimidation. People don't like to be intimidated, and it only creates feelings of dislike and discord, which can easily turn in to hate, rage and violence if provoked. We can get to the root of this problem, if only people would be more open minded and accepting of the thing that drives us all- Energy.<br>  <br>  To quote perhaps the greatest scientist of our time, Albert Einstein: "It followed from the special theory of relativity that mass and energy are both but different manifestations of the same thing -- a somewhat unfamiliar conception for the average mind. Furthermore, the equation E is equal to m c-squared, in which energy is put equal to mass, multiplied by the square of the velocity of light, showed that very small amounts of mass may be converted into a very large amount of energy and vice versa. The mass and energy were in fact equivalent, according to the formula mentioned above. This was demonstrated by Cockcroft and Walton in 1932, experimentally."<br>  <br>  Basically what this proves is that what we see is the same as what we are. We are one with our environment, We ARE the environment, we create it just by thinking about it every second of every day! We think, we have ideas, they turn into dreams, we nuture them, make them grow, and bring them into reality, and it doesnt matter how big or small or insignificant the idea may seem, everything is a manifestation of our thought process. Once your mind accepts this, and recongnizes the ability to manifest, you can do whatever you want, make your dreams come true.<br>  <br>  Mastering and Being In Control of Other People<br>  <br>  To be a creator of your reality, you have to be in control of your reality. To be in control of your reality, you have to be in control of every aspect of your reality. One of the key aspects of your reality is the people in it. To be a master of your reality requires mastering and being in control of other people. To master other people, you have to first master yourself. You’ll find other people limiting you and being out of your control until you overcome your own self limitations towards controlling and mastering them.<br>  <br>  Those who are masters of their reality are also masters of the people in it. When you can change your limited perceptions about mastering reality to match those who are masters, you will become unlimited in what you can and will do. Masters have no limit and they control the game because they know how it works. They know that the players are very much a part of the game environment as is everything else. There will be proficient players and poor players. A master knows he has to work with all kinds.<br>  <br>  How you handle the world begins from how you see the world. The more deluded you are in the way you see the world, the more ineffective you will be in engaging it. The more clear or enlightened you are in the way you see the world, the more power you have over it. To see with enlightened eyes is to see what is, not what should be. Awareness is knowing how things work and what’s going on. When you can free your mind of the illusions of the world, you will be free to move without being limited by it.<br>  <br>  People tease one another, spread rumors, and pick fights to be mean. Why? For most people, bullying is a way to feel better about themselves, feel important, and control other people. People also think they will be popular if they make fun of others and spread gossip. What they don't know is that bullying is not cool! People bully:<br>  <br>      * To get attention<br>  <br>      * To get what they want<br>  <br>      * To gain respect<br>  <br>      * To become more popular<br>  <br>      * To feel better about themselves<br>  <br>      * To punish people they are jealous of<br>  <br>      * Because they think it's fun to hurt others' feelings<br>  <br>      * Because others are doing it|`|SouPhkgxaa	Those people are just cruel.<br>  <br>  Parents and teachers can control you.<br>  Mainly,because they want whats best for you.<br>  <br>  But friends, shouldnt control you.<br>  <br>  If people other then teachers or family, control you.<br>  Just speak up because thats wrong and rude.<br>  <br>  They dont got more power.<br>  Were all nice people we just gotta change our bad habits.<br>  <br>  Good Luck =]

Al anon and other groups can help you with the person Try them and see if talking to someone who knows addiction helps. you are a recovering drug addict and there is help if you reach out for it. I've been on percocet and all kinds of things and you can go a long time without and one day you want them badly again.
