Are you going to do an in depth study of the heros of the Muslim world who drove two children into an area so they could blow up the car with the children in it?  Will you name names?  Insist upon their being brought to justice?  Dragged thru the streets, hung by their feet and burned so the world will more fully appreciate their devotion to their religion?  Or will they be applauded for such manly acts as running from the car leaving the children behind before the car explodes?

Perhaps the single most common refrain from the White House and the president's allies is that there have been no terrorist attacks on U.S. soil since Sept. 11, 2001. That's incorrect — about a month after 9/11, someone sent weaponized anthrax to two Democratic senators and several news outlets. Five Americans were killed and 17 more suffered serious illnesses.   Where did this story go? The administration stopped talking about it, the media stopped reporting on it, and the public stopped asking about it. Why is that?

20090131133854AAP9mEA	News & Events;Current Events	How can the prevalence of domestic abuse towards men be recognised?	I was reading an article in Friday's Guardian on the inadequacy of the counties of England in providing sufficient care for women who have been raped, abused or stalked ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2009/j...  ) and although I disagree in no way with the article, I started thinking about the other side of the argument.    In a survey undertaken by the National Institute of Justice Centers [sic] for Disease Control and Prevention (NIJCDC) ( http://www.batteredmen.com/nvawsurv.pdf  ) the number of men in the USA who have experienced rape and/or physical assault at least once in their lifetimes was greater than that of women by some 6 million cases.    In a world where the equality of women is silencing men, and where men are expected to hide their feelings, the ability for a man to seek help is next to none. There are very few places where a man may get support or shelter from domestic violence or rape.   What can we, as a society, do to recognise the male victims of domestic abuse, and remove the stigma such victims often suffer?

This question is carried on from my previous question: "Umm am i getting bullied?" if you read that you'll get a little more info plus its still open to answer!   ANYWAY - Me and Becky usually practice gymnastics and cheerleading in the park after school, however there is a girl brat who is like 3 or 4 years younger than us has been hassling us and shes even assaulted me by picking me up and dropping me, scary. Yesterday was completely different though, she was only with two other friends and she only gave us both evil looks and we made a joke about her but she only told us to shut up. However today she visited us with about 15 friends :| they surrounded us, with the main brat girl right in front of us.   She put on a cocky smile and said "Well you know what happened last time" Becky said "Well we don't wanna be hassled by you especially when you're younger than us and we don't even know you so leave us alone" These ***** girls then started talking trash and insulting us, the blonde girl did a standing backtuck again so me and Becky retaliated with us both doing a standing tuck (i think we beat them to be fair lol) so the main brat (i think i heard her name was Kelsey) picked up Becky off the floor this time and dropped her like she did with me, altough Becky is even a bit taller and quite a bit heavier than me too. I couldn't keep my cool and started yelling at those disrespectful bitchy brats then the numbers ganged up on me and they push me to the ground and same with Becky when she got back up again. They walked off laughing and threatening us too.      WHY is this happening? We are getting bullied by kids and i feel a bit embarrased really, why does this girl challenge us? And how the hell does she just pick us up like that?      I hate it, i need help :(

It will make me sicker if TV networks pay her to show up on TV.   Her hospital should hold all her 8 babies till she pays all the medical bills she owes.   Her local and state government should stop providing all her social welfare payment and foodstamps.   Her local community  and "church" should stop providing  her with  any "charitable" items.
