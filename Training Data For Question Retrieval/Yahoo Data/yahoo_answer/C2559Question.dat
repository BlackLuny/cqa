20090203132820AAe0kg8	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	Is it possible to get what the full value of my vehicle is when trading in?	I have received 3 different quotes on the value of my Jeep from Kbb.com, Edmunds.com & Nadaguides.com. All 3 are major websites that are related to cars, dealers tips & trading advice. The lowest is from Kelly Blue Book & the highest is from Nadaguides. Edmunds & Nadaguides both have about the same value which is actually what it really is worth. Kelly Blue Book although popular rips me off by over a $1,000 on the worth of my Jeep. Edmunds is really popular as well. I don't know much about Nadaguides.com.

20090203132906AAYS7mE	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Who has a SBC vacuum diagram?	I have a 78 Camaro. 350 V8 SBC, Edelbrock Performer intake, Holley 650 cfm carb, Flowtech headers by Holley, Cherry bomb glass pack dual exhaust directly bolted onto header collectors, and Comp cam with .470 lift.    The brakes (disc front and drum rear), rotors, and master cylinder / brake booster were recently replaced by a local shop. The car has a HARD break pedal with minimal stopping power which I suspect is due to vacuum lines improperly routed connected. Currently I have 1 vacuum line to the distributor. The other vacuum line is from brake booster to a T fitting, T fitting to PVC valve on valve cover and other hose to carb. What is the correct routing of vacuum lines OR other contributing factors to hard brake pedal and soft stopping power?      Please include experience in your answer. 10 points to best answer. All answers greatly appreciated.

20081107112425AAe6yEO	Cars & Transportation;Other - Cars & Transportation	When you're BOTH running the red light, who's to blame?  The driver turning or the one driving straight?	Let's say the ligth is turning red.  A car driving straight through the light figures the driver trying to turn will not attempt to run the light since he is turning.      The car making the turn doesn't see it this way and turns anyway and strikes the car driving through the red light as well.      Who's to blame when it comes down to it?  Since both are running the red light does it become a no-fault situation?  Or is the driver making the turn at greater blame than the driver going straight through the light.      If your answer has easy-to-read and understand explanation of this, it will help you to score-the-points.  Thanks.      This incident nearly happened to me one morning some months ago, and it was I who was trying to run the light sans turning.  It ended up that there was no incident, and the wife and I got into a very minor argument over who would be blaimed for such an accident.

20081004203417AAWBwq0	Cars & Transportation;Other - Cars & Transportation	How can I drive less than what I am now?	Before I start, I just want to say that anyone who is all "global warming" they can just shut up now.   I'm 19, got my car a few months ago. My first car. It's a 03 honda civic LX. Good gas mileage, etc.   I don't start school for a few more months. (winter term). Means I have the option of doing nothing. I work from home. Since I just got my car, I love driving it. I'm sure a lot of people go through this.   When I say I love driving it.. I LOVE driving. Usually i'll spend anywhere from 1-3 hours just driving around exploring Oregon with a million thoughts racing through my head.   Also, my brother(s) think that the second oldest is a better driver than me. I think not. Course the only way to convince him is to get better at driving. Which requires driving.. I already know that it takes 5-10 years to become a good driver. But he just got a car as well so it's an even playing field atm.   Back on topic, how can I drive less or how can I not want to drive around as much? Basically, how can I make it so I will only want to drive when I have to. i.e. going to the store, school, or work?   I just got back from driving around for 30 minutes and I already want to drive some more.

20081016063022AAlArn1	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Is there something wrong with my transmission?	I just bought a 2006 Explorer xlt 4.0v6 last friday. 5 spd auto      The warranty is 30 days/1000 miles.  Covers transmission, driveline, and engine.  When driving, its a little rough on shifting, but thats no biggy, im used to driving a ram 1500.      But if you are on any sort of incline, and you let off the brake while it gear, it will drift down the incline.   For example, if im on a slight upslope, and in drive, the truck will drift backwards if I left off the brake.  Same for Reverse.      When you put it in drive it takes around 1 second to engage, and jerks slightly when engaged.      Is there anything wrong here, or is it just how the ford transmissions work?  Thanks.      ps I already have driven 500 miles, I only have 500 left before the warranty is out.

I gave them my tag no. and everything. The insurance that i had, didnt have any coverage for theft autos and stuff. So i'm stuck with not having a car. How likely is it that my car is found?? Because i've totally lost hope on it. the way i see it is, in such a big city, there are millions of cars, and still a lot of stolen cars like me. And what if they just replace the tag with their own tags or change the color of the car (mine was black). what if they just dismantle it and sell it. The chances are almost as winning a lotto or something. have any of u had or heard of any experiences as such and gotten the car back??

20081105151738AAjssFV	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Should I fix my Passat or just give up?	I have a 2003 Passat that I bought almost exactly 6 years ago.  It has just over 50,000 miles on it.  It also has some minor body damage.  Last week, I had to get it fixed because the thermostat wasn't working.  That cost me $325.00.  Two days later the check engine light went on again.  This time they say it's vacuum tubes, and there's a leak in a gasket, so it's leaking oil out of the gasket and hydraulic oil out of some other valve.  The cost to get the whole thing fixed will be just over $1,000.  If I can pay the $1,000 and have it run for another year or two, that would be great, but if I have to go back next week or next month for another major repair, then it seems like it might be better just to trade it in for a Honda.

20081106140340AAUPrI2	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Oil leaking out of exhaust port (engine apart)?	So we just took out a 454 out of our Chevy. We put it on an engine stand upside down, took the oil pan off and were planning on taking the crank out to replace the bearings and check the crank out and main bores. But over night we noticed that oil was leaking out of the exhaust port on one cylinder. It wasnt a little, it was alot. When the engine was running it didnt burn oil either. The top end was all redone, block machined only a year ago. Its just we heard and knock and suspect main bearings are shot or crank needs machining or replacement. How come this oil is leaking by the cylinder when it didnt burn oil or anything like that?

20081113163924AA18YUS	Cars & Transportation;Safety	Do you wear your seat belt?	Do you wear your seat belt? If so, please explain.   If you don't, please explain why and take a look at this.         I wear my seat belt everywhere I go. I'm part of my high school’s SADD/MADD program. We work to pass laws and educate people about seat belt safety. In one particular mock car roll, a dummy father, mother, and kid were put into a car. The machine stimulated a roll over at about 15 mph. With the seat belts on, the dummies were not harmed. When the instructor took the seat belts off, the ending was wicked gross. The dummies flew around in the car, ending with the baby in the trunk and the parents in the back seat. Then, the windows were opened. The dummies were thrown from the car.          Seat belts do save lives. Don't care what you say, it's 100% TRUE.      Seat belts focus on areas of the body, like your hips and shoulders.   When put on correctly, they prevent you from smashing forward and being thrown from your seat, during an accident.      Seat belts weren't made to be comfortable. Get over it.             Now, please tell me: Do you wear your seat belt? How come?

I'm looking for similar kick as this sub but i also want much more quality than the current setup.  It has great low end output but the upper sounds seem to lack similar punch to them.      Normally, I listen to rock and rap, so Im not looking only for a subwoofer thats got a quick punch to it but also a good output when playing hiphop.      I'm looking for a pair of ten's, a pair of twelve's, or just one twelve.  I know sensitivity plays a huge role as well but with so many brands out there it's hard to choose.  Budget is around $300-$350 for the subs and box.      Thank you for any suggestions

Now that I'm looking for and old one as a project, I've discovered how hard it is to find basic info on them.      Does anyone know what kind of engines were used in the early ones? (first generation, roughly 1966-1977). I've heard one person say that they were Dodge and one say that they were Chevy. Hoping someone can clear this up for me      Also were they rear wheel drive or front wheel drive?      Thanks...

20090222191351AAk7nzg	Cars & Transportation;Rail	If Kansas City Southern is merged with another Class I railroad, who do you think they will merge with?	I ask because I notice amongst the North American Class I railroads they are the smallest of the US five (Union Pacific, BNSF, Norfolk Southern and CSX are the other four) and only have a few lines in the US that mainly go south to Mexico. I am thinking with all the Railroad Mergers, they could be merged with either Union Pacific or BNSF due to their larger share of that US region's railroads. I am thinking BNSF would be more likely to buy KCS than UP would due to the fact that the headquarters for KCS is dominated by BNSF trains. Is there anyone who can give me some input on this?

I just got my alternator replaced, i went to ford and had a diagnostic check on it (My car was not starting at first try and idling funny with the first start then it would die out, it took two or three tries till it started) and they said my alternator was charging badly. So i bought a new one and had it installed, now at a complete stop my car makes a funny noise and starts to idle really ugly. This happens when the RPMs drop below 6 or 5 hundred. Could this be an engine problem or wire problem? Before the alternator was replaced we ran a different diagnostic and it came up with the camshaft sensor being bad, but we replaced it and thus we seeked advice from Ford. Any help would be much appreciated Thank You.
