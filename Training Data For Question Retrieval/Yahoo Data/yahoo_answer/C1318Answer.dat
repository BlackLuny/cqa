39f3758933add65e2634bbff1b3a9a28aa	When things are hot, they become less dense. The deeper you go into the Earth's interior, the hotter it becomes. Volcanoes are area's where there are area's of molten rock beneath them. (Either from proximity to a subduction zone, or a hot spot tract or whatever else...) Since molten rock is hot, and less dense 'stuff' tends to rise through more dense 'stuff' the molten rock rises towards the surface until it reaches a point where it's buoyancy is balanced or neutral. This rising magma is known as 'dikes' and 'sills' and in some melts, there are swarms of dikes called a 'dike swarm.' (Go figure.) If the dikes continue to be fed, and their composition of volitile gases are right, they may have a good chance of erupting. They do this by remaining hot. When things get hot they also expand and since the uppermost layers of the crust are very cold, they tend to become very brittle and fracture from the force of the expanding magma. These fractures, called joints and faults, sometimes reach all the way from the surface down to the magma where only atmospheric pressure keeps it from erupting. If the composition of volatile gasses in the magma is high enough, then bubbles will begin to form as the magma rises toward the surface and the magma erupts in a volcanoe. The composition of the melt, such as how much silica is present, help determines how the magma will erupt since silica controls viscosity. If silica content is high and volitile gases are present, then the eruption will be explosive and form a stratovolcanoe. If silica content is relatively low and there is less gas content, then the eruption is more effusive and form a shield volcanoe.|`|M3KKhk3Laa	volcanic eruptions are caused by pressure in the earth's mantle. The pressure have no where to go and is forced upward into the earth's crust and and is released or "erupt" out of a volcano.|`|j7Inh0sQaa	Earthquakes can cause a volcano to erupt.

A control for this case would be to expose a group of people to neither hearing or visual stimuli and ask them the same questions about the stimuli as well.

mV1YscV7aa	We don't!     It is just assumed by radio-dating experts alongside a lot of other improbable factors. That is why I don't believe in radioactive dating techniques.    It should be pointed out that there are other reasons why it is unreliable. Firstly that the exact amount of original radioactive matter cannot be known. Secondly that the amount of daughter element that may have originally been in the sample cannot be known. Thirdly, if the sample WERE millions of years old, then contamination and escape of relevant materials, especially where these are gases, would be inevitable.|`|AA6Aq94vaa	every time we measure a particular type of radioactive decay it is always the same. Every time. Unless a situation occurs that would change the rate of radioactive decay, the rate will be considered static|`|MI0MIAfaaa	The rate of radioactive decay for each isotope is constant.  So it wouldn't change over time, but if it did this would have an effect on Carbon dating etc.|`|m3T8IMwhaa	Radioactive decay just means the decay is proportional to the amount, or concentration, of the material.  If it doesn't change now (the decay constant remains constant) then the constant isn't a function of the concentration (which was implied when I called it a constant, but whatever).  So the equation holds, but decay was faster in the past because the concentration, of Carbon-12, for example, was higher.|`|fec9977a5483ec366a466856bafd9b4daa	Nobody quite got it yet, so I'll try.    The rate of radioactive decay depends ultimately on the fundamental physical constants of the universe:? the difference in mass between proton+electron and neutron, the speed of light (which determines the energy that mass would produce), Planck's constant (which determines how probable a decay is in any given interval of time), et cetera.    If the rate of radioactive decay of a given isotope were to change, it would have to be due to a change in one or more of the underlying physical constants.? Such changes would have other, observable effects.? We do not observe these effects, therefore we can take the constancy of the rate of radioactive decay for any particular isotope as a given.    Note that one direct effect of a large increase in the rate of radioactive decay would be an increase in volcanism, on Earth and elsewhere, as the heat given off by decaying uranium and such went up by the same proportion.? At the extreme, this could re-liquefy most of the planet.? This is not something that could happen while preserving ancient rocks.|`|WbVE1cXKaa	we don't.  We do not KNOW that the universe has remained constant in its physical laws through all time (well, at least time since immediately after origin).  However, everything that we do see is very much consistent with that assumption.    There is no evidence whatsoever that the laws of reality have changed with time.  In the absence of any such evidence, it is normally considered reasonable to accept that as the situation (non-changing physical laws), and not imagine that something happened for which no evidence has ever been found.    There are implications to presuming that decay rates would have varied with time.  This variance would only occur if the physical laws governing the atomic nucleus had somehow varied with time.  Since all of the physical laws are interelated, changing the attributes of one requires changing the attributes of all (the other laws would have to change as well, to compensate for the system being thrown out of balance).    And as I said, no one has ever found evidence to suggest such changes have ever occurred.    So, even though we do not KNOW that radioactive decay is a constant process on the grand scale, there is absolutely no reason whatsoever to presume otherwise.

vsN74qHUaa	1) To factor by grouping you group the terms and see if you can pull out a common factor. In this case we'll rewrite the expression like this:    ab + 4a + 3bc + 12c  Now we group them  (ab + 4a) + (3bc + 12c)  Now we take out a common term from both groups. There is a b+4 hidden in both of them.  (b+4)(a) + (b+4)(3c)  Now factoring out the b+4 we get  (b+4)(a+3c)  Factoring by grouping comes with practice. The more you do them the easier it is to see what to group.     2) Difference of squares is one of the easier thing to factor.   (a^2 - b^2) factors into (a-b)(a+b). So in this case    m^2 - 49  (m - 7)(m + 7)    To check, simply multiply them back out. You get:  m^2 + 7m - 7m - 49 = m^2 - 49     3) To factor the last one you have to ask yourself what two numbers multiply to 7 and sum to -8? In this case the answer is -1 and -7. So the answer becomes (x-1)(x-7).

We know it by learning that a2 - b2  = (a-b) (a+b)  In your problem, if m was a and 49 was b, then  (m-7)(m+7) is your answer.    3) You recognize right away that 7 + 1 = 8,   and 7 X 1 = 7, Therefore placing them in the   correct position with the correct signs in your  factor terms,  you get  (x - 7) (x -1)|`|TWzOmqqYaa	First, you have to take some thing common so you end up in same expressions. You can take "b" as a common letter in "ab + 3bc" and similarly you can take "4" as a common number in "4a + 12c". You end up in b(a + 3c) + 4 (a + 3c). Your answer for this question is (b + 4)(a + 3c)  Second, you should know the formula (a^2 - b^2) = (a+b)(a-b)  so it becomes m^2 - 49 = (m + 7)(m - 7)   Third, you have to come up with two numbers which, if multiplied, give you 7x^2 and ,if added, give you -8x.

There is no way to complete med school any faster--the curriculum is ultra-dense as it is.

Paramecium are neither male nor female.  They are completely sexless.    How COULD a sexless creature "develop" the need for sex?  If  a sexless creatures were somehow "born" with a sex, then it's genes would die out, as it could not find another "sexed" creature like itself to reproduce with.    One of the definitions of "species" is that one species canNOT intermate with another and produce a viable (living) infant..    For a "sexless" creature to have developed "sex" would have required a genetic mutation.  That is very odd, as only about one in 10,000 mutatioins proves to be useful to a species.  Now, in order for the "sexed" creatures to have something to mate with would have required a second creature to have a second, exactly opposite, mutation.    This would have ALSO been a 1-in-10,000 chance, but TIMES a 1-in 10,000 chance of being the exact opposite of the first creature.    Therefore, the chances of "sex" developing from "sexless" creatures is 10,000 time 10,000 times 10,000, or 1-in-1,000,000,000,000 -- almost impossible.|`|cK1zUfdTaa	no i can not|`|FRp7lXwKaa	sea sponge|`|ATqWlp8aaa	A sea horse.|`|E8PiYH83aa	i heard giraffes dont have genders|`|nUmiUNklaa	God|`|lKcCSxS4aa	ameoba|`|1NzCH71Haa	Amoebas.|`|QhSSPBLfaa	ahhh sea horses?|`|SEbchthIaa	Plants =]    idk sorry, i tried looking it up but i cant think of any.|`|Z93QD5emaa	clam?|`|7kvTHzj0aa	certain bacteria has no gender. certain frogs and fish can change gender or be both genders at the same time.|`|1qqOzxmBaa	An earthworm is asexual (reproduces by itself)|`|jW1Aziwlaa	Sexless creature?

SvmZlLdaaa	"The definition of a species is a population of like creatures that can mate. So if two species can successfully mate and produce offspring that are viable and can reproduce they ARE all the same species" - this definition is now recognised as being too simplistic. For example, all members of the genus Canis - wolves, dogs, coyotes, jackals and dingoes - can interbreed and produce fertile young. According to the old definition, this would mean they are all the same species. Clearly, this is not the case - physically, behaviourally and genetically, the grey wolf and coyote, for example, are different species. They're just very closely related.    There are many species which can breed with different species and produce young. The most famous hybrid is probably the mule, the offspring of a male donkey and female horse (the offspring of a male horse and female donkey is called a hinny). In order for two different species to breed, they must be closely related - usually within the same genus, and at least within the same family (e.g. horses and donkeys both belong to the genus Equus and the family Equidae). What this basically means is that they shared an ancestor with each other more recently than with other species, and thus share much of the same genetic material. Beyond family level, two species will not share enough genetic material for the egg and sperm to 'recognise' each other, which is why you can't breed animals from different families like, for example, a dog and a cat. A dog sperm simply wouldn't be able to fertilise a cat egg, and vice versa.    Hybrids are usually sterile because the parent species have different numbers of chromosomes, which means the hybrid cannot produce functional sex cells. However, there are occasional fertile female mules and other hybrids such as ligers (offspring of a male lion and female tiger) and tigons (offspring of a male tiger and female lion), but there is no record of fertile males. Where two different species can always produce fertile young of both sexes, as with the members of the genus Canis, it is an indication that they are very closely related.    Some other interesting hybrids include the leopon (leopard-lion hybrid), pumapard (puma-leopard hybrid), cama (camel-llama hybrid), wholphin (false killer whale-dolphin hybrid), zeedonk (zebra-donkey hybrid), Bengal cat (domestic cat-leopard cat hybrid), and grolar or pizzly bear (grizzly bear-polar bear hybrid).|`|SYSCiRhsaa	science_guy is partially correct, the common definition of species is that two individuals which can mate and produce viable offspring are members of the same species.  Viable offspring are able to reproduce and do not have any sort of extreme physical or other abnormality that makes survival impossible.  Horses and donkeys can mate to produce mules which are healthy but sterile, so we can still consider donkeys and horses separate species.  The product of such a mating is a hybrid.  So a mule is a donkey-horse hybrid.      Some other closely related animal species can also produce hybrids, such as members of the big cat genus Panthera.  A liger is the offspring of a male lion and a female tiger and a tigon is the offspring of a female lion and a male tiger.  Why distinguish between the two?  Ligers are much larger than either lions or tigers and tigons are considerably smaller.  There is some sort of genetic growth limitation that is apparently passed to offspring by males of one species and females of the other, so when you mate a male lion which lacks the control with a female tiger that also lacks it, you get a much larger cat as a result, and a smaller than usual one when you do the opposite cross.  Other Panthera hybrids are also possible:    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panthera_hy...    Members of the genus Canis, which includes coyotes, wolves and domestic dogssometimes considered a subspecies of wolfcan also hybridize.      The species definition becomes rather problematic outside of the animal kingdom, where hybridization is more common and apparently easier to achieve.  There are numerous plant examples.  Gardeners, botanists and farmers are continually producing interesting new crosses for aesthetic and industrial use.  Modern molecular biology and genetics have allowed more precise crosses to be performed.  Bacteria are often capable of transferring genetic information in the form of a plasmid to species other species who are not closely related at all.  Plasmids are small DNA or RNA molecules, often circular, that are not incorporated into the main chromosome and can be replicated separately and transferred between cells by a mechanism called conjugation.  Rhizobium, a bacterium, can actually transfer plasmids to plant cells!  This is somewhat different from reproduction but also involves the transfer and mixing of genetic information.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_c...    As for the second part of your question, there are many species which can undergo either sexual or asexual reproduction depending on the conditions.  Flowering plants contain male and female parts and offspring can be produced either by selfing an individual, which involves bringing the male and female parts into contact with each other, or by pollinating them with other individuals.  When pollen is transferred by bees, humming birds and other pollinators hybridization can also take place.  Fungi, prokaryotes and animals are also capable of switching between sexual and asexual reproduction.  The details are rather complex and differ among species so it can be difficult to make generalizations.      See:  - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternation...  - http://biology.about.com/library/weekly/...|`|h1M2Ruq3aa	the definition of a species its a population of like creatures that can mate. So if two species can successfully mate and produce offspring that are viable and can reproduce then are ARE reall the same species.    However a horse and a donkey can create a mule - however a mule is sterile. Only exception to this really is plants.

We know there are certain area's of the crust that are more dense than others, just by the observation that we have subduction and volcanism. Gravity comes into play in some areas where mafic (which are usually more dense) intrusions underlie more felsic (which are less dense) crust. Over time, these intrusions create a "gravity high" zone where a basin begins to form as the dense rock pulls the overlying crust downward.|`|52414242fe3ad4a32e2f2dfe56e02f62aa	Measure the force of gravity over an area of dense rocks, such as a massive sulfide deposit.

AA10927246	I've wondered this too. I don't think you can really figure out the "probability" here because there are too many variables.    Given that there are 4 other people to play, it is likely that somebody is going to change the color.  Plus if you announce the color you need, it makes it more likely people are going to try to change the color.    I think with that many people, I would opt for announcing a different color.  I might get lucky and they would change it to my desired color.  Or if not, at least they don't know what color I truly need.  So if I can't go out this time, I might get another chance for the right color next time, given they don't really know what I need.    I say, choose a different color.    P.S. I might say otherwise if there were only 2 players because it might be that your opponent can't play that color and it then immediately comes back to you and you win.  But with 5 players, I'd opt for a different color.|`|wJoMKfvqaa	hahaa wow this question made me laugh for some reason.  UNO is basically a game of luck, but i would play the color in my hand.  because if someone changed the color, you'd have a 1/4 chance of it being the same color as the card in your hand, whereas if you kept it your color, people may have the same color in their hand, even if it's a different number, so they could put down the same color card. if that makes any sense to you... just play the color in your hand lol

77lIzq4Taa	**For the past four years, Jonathan O'Neill and his colleagues from the McGill University in Canada have been observing a wide portion of an ancient stone layer north of Quebec, called the Nuvvuagittuq greenstone belt. Their method of rock dating (based on the quantity of isotope neodymium-142 found in the rock) is still surrounded by controversy, though.         Neodymium-142 is found in all the rocks in various amounts, depending on their age, but the ones dating from before 4.2 billion years ago should be richer in this respect. This happens as a result of the radioactive decay of the samarium-146, a phenomenon that widely disappeared during that respective period, so the rocks that had formed prior to that would hold larger than normal amounts of neodymium-142. As O'Neil explains, "You can precisely measure the amount of neodymium-142 and calculate a precise age for the rock. In our case it gave us an age of 4.28 billion years," which is far older than any other rock previously found. The next oldest (Acasta gneiss) was also found in North Canada and ages 4.03 billion years. Still, there are some chemical elements like the small zircon crystals that are older than that  4.36 billion years.|`|EDjKCt0baa	"Uranium-lead dating. This technique measures the ratio of two lead isotopes (lead-206 and lead-207) to the amount of uranium in a mineral or rock. Often applied to the trace mineral zircon in igneous rocks, this method is one of the two most commonly used (along with argon-argon dating) for geologic dating. Uranium-lead dating is applied to samples older than about 1 million years."|`|i7HQAGRtaa	CARBON is NOT used in radiometric dating because it has TOO SHORT a half life  scientist use  Uranium 235 or 238|`|oL6FUbshaa	Radiocarbon dating is the first dating method ever invented, invented back in 1949. Yet back in the early 1800's they already made the assumption that dinosaurs were millions of years old, even though no dating methods had been invented yet.    Radiocarbon dating cannot be used on rocks, since there is no carbon in rocks. This method can only be used on organic material such as wood, paper, cloth, skin, bone, etc. So if a bone is fully fossilized, or fully turned into stone, then you cannot carbondate it.    All scientists agree that you cannot carbondate anything beyond 50,000 years because the way that carbon-14 breaks down over time, after about 50,000 years has gone by there won't be a measurable amount of carbon left in the sample in order to carbondate it.    So you see, carbondating is not used on dinosuars, since most of them are fully fossilized, and they are assumed to be millions of years old.    However, some dinosaurs are not fully fossilized and still contain some fresh bone tissue in the thick part of the leg. Creation Scientists have found this part of the dinosaur to contain carbon, and they have carbondated it to be around 3 or 4 thousand years old.    Interesing, because fossilization is caused by flooding, and the Bible talks about a worldwide flood that occurred about 4,400 years ago. Dinosaur remains worldwide are associated with water-laid sediment.    Evolutionists, however, refuse to carbondate dinosaur bones containing carbon, because they know it will give them an age estimate of only a few thousand years. So they'll use another form of radiometric dating like potassium-argon, or uranium-lead, which will give them the million year age estimates that they're looking for, based upon the geological column which was invented out of their imaginations in the early 1800's, long before any dating method had ever been invented.

With Vi and Vf we are limited to only two times -- the initial and final time.    With V1, V2, V3, V4... we can specify velocity at any given time.  But these times don't correspond, in principle, to any specific thing.  V1 and V2 could be seperated by 1 second, but V2 and V3 are seperated by 20 seconds.      It is very common to see these used in summation, where you sum over all Vi (not initial velocities, simply the "i-th" velocity), perhaps to get an average momentum or something.  You can quickly turn a sum into an integral and then you have calculus based physics instead of algebra based!

Kilograms measure mass not weight. Physics teachers can be very picky about these things, even though almost everyone else will understand what you mean.     Assuming that v1 = 4 m/s was the final velocity, then:     The work done on the crate is equal to the change in mechanical energy of the crate.     Initially, the crate was still, and the crate didn't change its height above the ground. So, there is no initial kinetic energy, or change in potential energy.     Thus, the work done is equal to the final kinetic energy of the crate:     W = KEf = (1/2)(m)(v1)^2 = (1/2)(50 kg)(4 m/s)^2 = 400 J

39f3758933add65e2634bbff1b3a9a28aa	"Soon" to a geologist is much different than "soon" to everyone else. (Except maybe astronomers.) Old faithful may run by the clock but most other volcanism has a bit of give. Volcanism in most places is periodic (having the same interval of time between eruptions.) but over time tend to change. Dating of Yellowstone eruptions show that it erupts around ever 600,000 to 800,000 years, and we're somewhere in the range of 600,000 to 650,000 now. However, just because that's the way it has behaved in the past doesn't mean that's what's going on now. There is plenty of evidence that it will erupt again, but not so much that it is getting ready to erupt now. All we can look at is rates of deformation and uplift, and increases in seismicity and hydrothermal activity. In most cases, these rates are pretty high for Yellowstone, but Yellowstone is not most cases. If it did erupt soon there would be geologists who are surprised and some who would not be so surprised. My guess is that there are more of the former than the latter.|`|Gnfc4wRlaa	The USGS doesn't think so.  Although volcanic eruptions can't be predicted with accuracy, it doesn't appear that a major eruption at Yellowstone is going to occur any time soon.    YELLOWSTONE VOLCANO (CAVW 1205-01-)  44.43N 110.67W, Summit Elevation 9203 ft (2805 m)  Volcano Alert Level: NORMAL  Aviation Color Code: GREEN    Is it true that the next caldera-forming eruption of Yellowstone is overdue?    No. First of all, one cannot present recurrence intervals based on only two values. It would be statistically meaningless. But for those who insist... let's do the arithmetic. The three eruptions occurred 2.1 million, 1.3 million and 0.64 million years ago. The two intervals are thus 0.8 and 0.66 million years, averaging to a 0.73 million-year interval. Again, the last eruption was 0.64 million years ago, implying that we are still about 90,000 years away from the time when we might consider calling Yellowstone overdue for another caldera-forming eruption. Nevertheless, we cannot discount the possibility of another such eruption occurring some time in the future, given Yellowstone's volcanic history and the continued presence of magma beneath the Yellowstone caldera.      The most likely type of eruption would not be volcanic but, rather, hydrothermal. This type of small, but still explosive eruption can occur from shallow reservoirs of steam or hot water rather than molten rock. These reservoirs are the sources of Yellowstone's famous geysers, hot springs, and fumaroles. Such explosions could blast out shallow craters more than a kilometer wide; as has occurred in the northern Yellowstone Lake Basin, including Mary Bay and nearby Turbid Lake and Indian Pond, and in western Yellowstone National Park north of Old Faithful. Each of these craters was produced by steam blasts within the past few thousand years.    The most likely type of volcanic eruption at Yellowstone would produce lava flows of either rhyolite or basalt; rhyolitic lava eruptions could also include explosive phases that might produce significant volumes of volcanic ash and pumice. Such eruptions could range in size from smaller than the 1980 eruption of Mt. St. Helens through much larger than the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption.    The least likely but worst-case volcanic eruption at Yellowstone would be another explosive caldera-forming eruption such as those that occurred 2.1 million, 1.3 million, and 640,000 years ago. However, the probability of such an eruption in any given century or millennium is exceedingly low- much lower than the smaller eruptions mentioned above.|`|RkfIPD7Iaa	No, not really.  There have been some minor rumblings, but nobody is suggesting it means a major eruption is due any time soon.    Of course, there are eruptions (geysers, mudpots) on a daily basis in Yellowstone, just nothing important.|`|2181567251632c4e5445096bb9761f26aa	"yellow stone" - you mean like the stone used to make the Yellow Brick Road?    Oh, you mean Yellowstone National Park.    There are always changes in the geology and landscape of any active location, and there have been changes in Yellowstone ever since the park was first established in 1872.    In 2004, 5 dead bison which apparently had inhaled toxic geothermal gases trapped in the Norris Geyser Basin were found.  This was closely followed by an upsurge of earthquake activity.  In 2006, the Mallard Lake Dome and the Sour Creek Dome had risen at a rate of 4 to 6 cm per year from mid2004 through 2006, but by 2007 the rate had decreased.  All these events caused a lot of media attention and speculation about the geologic future of the region.  Experts responded that there was no increased risk of a volcanic eruption in the near future.    Check this out for more info:  http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/yvo/about/|`|AA10222010	Earthquakes occur almost constantly in and around the Yellowstone caldera, but in December they started coming in swarms. That activity has recently tapered off. Geologists who constantly monitor the region have seen no indications of any forthcoming massive eruption, although some relatively minor venting is always possible.    Here's a quote from one of the Yellowstone geologists ==>    Park geologist Hank Heasler said the odds of a cataclysmic eruption at Yellowstone any time soon are astonishingly remote  about the same as a large meteorite hitting the Earth. The last such eruption occurred 640,000 years ago. The last eruption of any kind at Yellowstone was a much smaller lava flow about 70,000 years ago.    "Statistically, it would be surprising to see an eruption the next hundred years," Lowenstern said.    Much more likely, he said, would be a hydrothermal explosion in which underground water encounters a hot spot and blasts through the surface. Small hydrothermal explosions producing craters a few feet wide occur in Yellowstone perhaps once or twice a year. Large hydrothermal explosions leaving craters the size of a football field occur every 200 years or so, according to a 2007 paper co-authored by Heasler, Lowenstern and others.     Lowenstern said new equipment installed deep within bore holes in the park over the past two summers eventually should provide a clear picture of what's causing the earthquake swarm. That data could help scientists make better predictions about Yellowstone's geology.

I took hydroxicut for a year or so and lost about 60 lbs, but it makes you feel very "cracked out" and makes you have no appetite. I think excercise is a better way to loose wieght, especially if you only need to loose a bit. The caffine in the pills will make you happy, just in a different way than anti-dep. pills will. I say, ask your doctor though. It's better to be safe and ask, than have an accident... Good luck.  PS: If you only need/want to loose like 15-20 lbs, Hydroxicut won't work. Trust me.

Might change your perception on our past.|`|iN91UZvdaa	As far as we can see with our scanning instruments and telescopes there is no other planets within our area with life like ours.     It said that life on Mars is possible since there is high evidence that water existed on its surface which was discovered when our telescopes found riverbeds on its surface. Also, over a week ago The Sun newspaper reported that there could be life on mars right now due to there being methane in its atmosphere, which is a crucial chemical needed for creating life, and they say that it might be coming from microscopic lifeforms in the subterranean areas of Mars. But until we gain concrete evidence on this we can not say for sure, but it is highly plausible because it is located in the area of the solar system called the safe zone (an area far from the sun which made it a safe distance for planets life earth to survive.)    Venus could have supported life just like Mars. The reason why is down to the physics behind planets that support life. You see Earth was a fluke to turn out the way it did. Earth had the right chemicals and gases, it was at the right distance from the sun allowing for the exact microwaves and light, and had to luck of being bombarded enough times that it was introduced to needed elements and minerals for life to be able to exist. Because Venus was on the edge of the safe zone it could have at some point in the early days had an atmosphere, but because of the high amounts of carbon dioxide the sun rays became trapped causing what is said to be the greenhouse affect, turning Venus into an acid filled planet which Carl Sagen says is probably what Hell would be like, hot and uninhabitable. But it is believed that if we were to pass through the atmosphere and survive we could if we had to right tech and resourced change Venus's fate, but that is in the future not now.    In the end you would have to be retarded not to believe that there is other life out there. Though the odds are highly rare for life to be born, we are in the end living in a gigantic universe which we will never get the chance to explore in our lifetime. Physics and logic dictate that it is possible though, it all a question of chance and luck since we the human race are lucky to even exist to begin with.

The reason for my thinking is that the laws of physics are the same, or very close to the same, mostly everywhere.     When certain chemicals are applied to a solution, they can spontaneously form lipid bilayers, resembling primitive cellular life forms' membranes / cell walls. Although these large molecular constructions lack the ability to replicate, the seem to be a likely candidate for the precursor of life on Earth...     So, imagine this, these chemicals exist all over the universe (hydrogen, oxygen, carbon...), they will form the same constructions on different planets as they do here.    As for the fine details of our life, such as the ribosome's interpretation of DNA (or dna at all for that matter), there could be much variability in these attributes, since it is a relatively complicated system with thousands (if not millions) of interlinked components all working together.    Regardless of the chemical composition though, cellular life has many advantages. For example, one cell life can approach maximum volume for a given amount of material construction, a useful feature for thermal regulation as well as hundreds of other things I don't have time to mention)... but in support for non-cellular life... I know for a fact that life does not have to be cellular however (by experimental self replicating machines I have developed), but it would seem statistically unlikely for life to not at least first go through some type of cellular stage as it evolves.     -NPolynomial  http://novaconceptions.blogspot.com

X8LNbaKQaa	A simple question, but not a real simple answer.  The voltage sets the excitation current that produces the magnetic field that drags the rotor around.  If there is not enough excitation current for the torque load, the motor slips badly (runs a lot slower than synchronous speed, instead of just a little) and the rotor runs very hot and so does the stator (because of high current during this semi stall) so the efficiency is low.  But assuming your motor is designed to have sufficient torque at 208 volts for this load, that inefficient voltage would be somewhere below 208.    If the line voltage is higher than needed to produce almost synchronous speed, (rated slip) the rotor runs at normal temperature, but the stator has to carry both the normal motor current and additional magnetizing current that is not really needed, so the efficiency falls off more slowly. than when the voltage is below the highest efficiency point.  And, at least, everything operates well.  At sufficient over voltage, the stator magnetization gets so high that the stator starts to saturate twice each cycle and the current goes through the roof two places every cycle.  That point is usually at least rated plus 10%, since line voltage is commonly that far off, some of the time.    So, if the motor is rated to cover 208 to 230 volts, I suspect the best efficiency voltage is closer to 208 than 230 volts, and 248 (almost 8% above highest rated) will waste a measurable power, but not be damaging.  But if it pops up another 10% and stays there for a few hours, you may be in  trouble.      If you can borrow a big enough Variac (variable transformer that lets you adjust voltage on the fly) and a watt meter, you could explore the range and find out the sweet spot.    Is that the sort of information you were wondering about?    By the way, at work they had an expensive piece of lab equipment that required vacuum and had a dedicated pump rated for 200 volts (for Japan).  This thing ran hot as a $2 pistol and I suspect it was saturating.    The correct replacement pump for 240 volts (the U.S standard line voltage) from Japan was very expensive so I ordered a buck boost transformer rated for a little more than name plate current.  One of the winding choices lowered the typical 245 volts (at that plant) to about 205, and the motor  temperature reduction was impressive.  The transformer had some losses, but very much less than the power saved by getting the motor closer to its design optimum.    --   Regards,    John Popelish|`|8Y7LQ6TGaa	248 volts is a bit high. You should check with the manufacturer, or look at the data sheet, to see if it will run at that voltage.    "Would the system be less or more efficient at 230 vs 208"  don't know, probably more efficient, but it depends on the design.    .

AA10335036	What you have given is the force equation, F = kq1q2/r^2.  The corresponding E-field equation is E = kq/r^2.  These apply to the force between two point charges and the field of one, respectively.  An integration is involved in going from the E equation to the voltage equation V = kq/r. (See ref.) But since the integration has been done, there is no need for you to integrate.

Qkf8il7zaa	If you have a normal appendix inflammation i.e. the appendix is filled with pus and bacteria which it might be leaking into the cecum (large intestine) but not anywhere else. The fatality risk is about 0.7% .    Sometimes a hole forms in the inflamed appendix thru which the content of appendix escapes into the abdominal cavity. This is called perforated appendicitis and the risk of death in this case increases to 4%.    Appendectomy is a very simple operation and you don't need to be scared of it.    If you are pregnant:  "The risk of fetal death in the perioperative period after an appendectomy for early acute appendicitis is 3% to 5%. The risk of fetal death is 20% in perforated appendicitis."---wikipedia

rsTB7D1zaa	Light (especially when spelled correctly) is not made of electrons.  It is made of photons, which are truly massless.    Light doesn't obey Newton's laws of gravity.  They obey general relativity.  Einstein theroized that stars would move position in the sky when they have to travel past a massive object.  This is known as gravitational lensing, I suggest you look up the "Einstein Cross" to see just how strong this effect can be.  In that picture, realize there is only ONE light source -- not FOUR.  It is not an optical illusion, it is the warping of space time which have caused the shortest path between the object and the observer to be altered from a traditional straight line.  Truly impressive stuff.|`|AA11148143	They have mass equal to 1/1100 of a hydrogen nucleus, as I recall, but in their world gravity is too weak to have any measurable effect.|`|D5ShDa5naa	Light is made of photons.

Photons are created when an electron in an atom moves from a higher orbit, to lower orbit. Photons do not have mass, but do have energy. Einstein's theory of relativity predicted that light would be bent by gravity, and this was later confirmed by observing the light of a star that would have been behind the sun, being observed beside it in a solar eclipse. So yes, light obeys the laws of gravity thanks to the theory of relativity.

We have to find first impedance/resistance of L which is XL=2 pi f L. XL could not be determined since type of current is unknown (AC or DC). If DC ---> XL=0 . Then after XL gotten, total resistance or impedance is r+XL and I(t)=V(t)/(r+XL).   j is imaginary number. When we try to count circuit with C and L components, lagging and leading events happened. Physically these lagging and leading are process of phase shift. In electronic math,   how many these phase shifts symbolized by real number +- j number,   eg. 2 + 3j Amperes.  Thank you very much Bensdad.

Anyway:    Starting with a gene (a long chain of nucleotides in the DNA), several enzymes work together to assemble a chain of nucleotides that are complementary to the gene's nucleotides (not identical to them), resulting in a sort-of "mirror-image" of the gene.  The result is a new messenger-RNA molecule, which carries the gene's code (in its complementary form) out of the nucleus to a ribosome, where Transcription (the assembly of a protein) can occur.    Of course, this explanation assumes you understand what is meant by "complementary nucleotides" - which you should have learned just before this.
7d84621e89c49bcba037226d3361c90baa	Nothing is going to happen.    The idea that the world is going to end in 2012 is actually based solely on a misunderstanding and misinterpretation of the Mayan calender, which appears to those who don't know how it works to end in the year 2012. In truth, the Mayan calender is a cyclic calender, meaning that the year 2012 is only the end of a cycle. Once it hits the end, it starts over again at the beginning. (Like our year goes January to December, and then starts over again with January.)     Why anyone would attach any meaning to the perceived end of a calendar written by a pagan civilization that was unable to even predict its own downfall is beyond logical comprehension.  (Not that ANY end-time theorists in the whole of history are renowned for their logic or comprehension skills.)    (No...it wasn't Nostradamus.)|`|Gnfc4wRlaa	There is no actual scientific theory or evidence that anything unusual is going to happen in 2012. It is a collection of myths and disproven theories being promulgated by doomsday predictors, who predict a new one every few years.  Nostradamus didn't predict it.  There is absolutely nothing in his predictions mentioning 2012.  Also, he wrote in riddles and anagrams, and even Nostradamus scholars don't agree on the interpretations of his writings.    The 2012 doomsday hoax is based on the end of the current cycle of the Mayan long count calendar. Their calendar was done in ages or cycles and their years ended at the winter solstice.  The current cycle ends December 21, 2012.  They didnt predict the end of the world, it was only the end of that cycle and the beginning of a new one.    Nibiru (Planet X) doesn't exist. Zecharia Sitchin is an author of books promoting the ancient astronaut theory for human origins. He attributes the creation of the ancient Sumerian culture to the Annunaki (or Nephilim) from a hypothetical planet named Nibiru in the solar system. The Doomsayers predicted that it was to hit Earth in 2003. Undaunted when it didn't show up, they just moved it out to 2012 to coincide with the end of the Mayan calendar.     Galactic Alignment  There is no galactic alignment occurring in 2012.  It takes 36 years to precess through galactic equator, and we will be 6 degrees off in 2012.  Even if we did have an alignment, it would have no effect on us.  The vast distances involved outweigh the effects of gravity.    Asteroid Apophis - the 2001 alert was for 2029, and was canceled after additional observations showed it would not hit us.    Polar Shift - the magnetic poles are moving all the time.  Polar reversals have occurred in the past, but we cant predict when they will occur again.      Passage through a "photon belt" has been added. This is also untrue and wouldn't hurt us if it were. Photons are merely units of light.    Solar flares happen all the time and we have more of them at some times than others. They haven't caused any serious problems in the past.  The direct effects of solar flares are mainly related to communications and radio transmissions. We had a major series of solar flares in 2005.|`|DCeAcP7kaa	The Mayan calendar will end.|`|0ac02757252bf3673e5594f1927600faaa	lets wait and see|`|6VUesjxxaa	Please be the first to bury yourself underground with a small food, water and air supply.

XiMQLv8Oaa	The most that anyone can do now is look at the universe as would a detective who came to the scene of a crime later. And not just later as what "later" usually is. It was billions of years later.   All he can do is piece together evidence to guess at the probable motive and  ways or methods by which it was committed.  This seems to be the case with the universe. The scientific mind looks for telltale indications of a process that has occured, fit it into the framework of known and acceptable ideas of the time and speculate as to how it came about.     This is how the Big Bang got formulated. This theory would give us the speculative view of a universe that is bursting radially outwards, with all the stars and the galaxies speeding away from the center of an explosion in order to fill up the vast expanse of space. Occasional findings would fit into the model by which this theory predicted things to be and so has gained quite an acceptability.     Looking at the universe by means of the powerful telescopes of today has, in a way made us look back into the past. You are right in the sense that some of  the lights viewed in these telescopes must necessarily  come from the past, millions of years ago, because that is how long it took these lights to  travel in order to reach us. And yet, these are not the lights due to the "explosion" that the Big Bang was  thought to be. We can't ever know if it still travels towards us. We can't even know where to look for it. We can't know where to point the sight of our telescopes to find the center of the explosion, for instance. We are just in the midst of it and has no means to go out in order to look back in.    Addendum:  My friend Wraxtiorre, "took some of my thunder" when he explained that "there is no There and Here" when the expansion took place. He is right.  And credit goes to him for saying  it directly outright. For, an analogy for our universe would be that some "nano seconds after the start of the Big Bang, the universe was only like a platform stage, then now, we are still in that stage,  but,  the whole venue has expanded into a Coliseum, and everything looked so far away because of the enlarged setting.|`|524f656a521cc9375efb6821b1b2063daa	We can see the Big Bang in that the Big Bang is the expansion of the universe (and that we can see).    You probably mean the initial moment of the expansion, which some people confuse with some kind of explosion.  For that confusion, you can blame Fred Hoyle: he's the one who came up with the awful name Big Bang (which leads some people to think there was an actual explosion).    One reason is the Cosmological Microwave Background radiation which was emitted when the temperature of the universe finally went below 3000 K.  That is when the universe became transparent.  Before that, the universe was not transparent.    Another reason is cosmological red-shift.  Even if we could see, the further back we look, the more the radiation is red-shifted by expansion.  In theory, if we could go back to time = zero, we would only "see" light of infinite wavelength  (meaning that if ever one of those photons reached here, its apparent energy would be zero (it would be invisible, even if you had an instrument for it -- which we don't).    A third reason is inflation.  The only way (so far) we can explain the apparent homogeneity of the early universe is to suppose that there was a period of rapid inflation.  At that moment, the universe was expanding at a speed that, from our frame of reference, would be faster than light.  This did not last long, but it is enough so that much of the light that was emitted before inflation has not reached us yet. (In any event, it is blocked by reason  1: the universe became opaque as soon as the protons and neutrons were formed).|`|GkH5NoFyaa	OK, the infinite mass answer totally lost me.  We cannot see the "big bang" because the light from it is so dim now, we need telescopes to see it; which we then, do!    We learned it was not a "bang" after all, i.e. explosion. More like an 'expansion' where it went from small, to ever-increasing bigger.|`|jR8mclWIaa	We can see it's effects.|`|D5QgyGbXaa	We can and do.  However, since before the Big Bang there was nothing outside of the Singularity, and after the Big Bang, the Singularity became the visible Universe, the Big Bang must be the outer shell of the Universe.  It used to be beyond white hot.  Now it's so thin and cool, it is at only 3 degrees K.  And it has been red-shifted into the infrared.  We use special telescopes and detectors to see it.  And we do.|`|B1mEwSXWaa	Buenas Dias Hector...

It wasn't until the universe had cooled and some stars had formed and had ionized the hydrogen that light could travel freely.|`|AA11323749	Although we are seeing light that started from its source many years ago, so we are sort of "looking at the past", we are not looking nearly that far back.      The original lights of the universe shot past where we are (or more correctly would be) outpacing all matter.  Our solar system condensed much much later, way way behind the big bang lights.    The light hitting our eyes when we look at the universe comes from light sources (stars, galaxies, quasars, etc) that came into being long after the big bang (or whatever was happening at the beginning of the universe -- there is not a big consensus on the origins of the universe and the big bang is just one of the popular theories).|`|joe2auNVaa	We can: look up Cosmic Background Radiation|`|AA10222010	We can't see the Big Bang mainly because for the first 300,000 years after the BB the universe was opaque, meaning that there was no such thing as light. Without light there's really nothing to see.    Also, immediately after the Big Bang the universe underwent a brief period of what's called 'inflation' when universal space expanded *faster* than the speed of light, therefore any information from that era can never reach us. Einstein's relativity isn't violated by inflation because it's *space* expanding faster than the speed of light rather than any mass *in* that space moving through it faster than light.|`|XvO4iLk0aa	G Viewed from one perspective, we are viewing the big band. it just isn't tied up with a pretty ribbon.

I'm sorry, did you say, "I'm not Sarah Palin!!"?    I cannot imagine why you cannot see the White House from your own back yard, it was in the spot you are standing in just a few hours ago.  How can you not see it now?  You are looking at me as though you were standing in front of the Pacific Ocean with the glow of beach sands on the underside of your chin.    Okay, seriously.  The problem is partly caused by the detective-like attitude of astronomers when they talk about pictures they have taken using certain filters (most popularly, X-Ray).  They talk about the "event" shown in the photo with the confident knowledge that they are seeing something that happened millions of years ago, because it took that long for the light of its image to arrive here.  This is a permitted misconception caused by the law of parsimony, or Occam's Razor, which says that the simplest explanation which accurately reflects the evidence given will be accepted as the truth.  So they become drama students and develop their "Here's what really happened" speeches.  We laymen simply listen with fascination because these are scientists who are excited to do their jobs.    The real truth has been spoken here, already in several of the other answers, albeit in overly-technical lectures about light-years and astrophysics.  It's just that the Universe we are in is the universe created by the Big Bang that we are trying to see.  It's kinda like not being able to see the forest for all the trees.    [Added Later:  I have to admit, I feel humbled by your questions lately.  Have you been studying?      It is difficult to completely answer a question like this because there are so many different perspectives to change while answering this one issue.  Like, for example, in Questor's answer, a necessary conclusion is the reminder that before the Big Bang, all physical locations were in one spot, so when we talk of "here" that far in the past, we are talking about the same spot where every other physical location was located at the time.   So, when Questor says "We can't know where to point the sight of our telescopes to find the center of the explosion, for instance. We are just in the midst of it and has no means to go out in order to look back in," he is facing the difficulty of trying to explain a "Where,There?" issue in a time when there was no "Here" and no "There."  All places were in the same spot.  So, now when we talk about the background radiation that is the last remnants of the Big Bang Explosion, it is clear that the "Here-is-where-the-explosion-itself-occu... spot is everwhere all at once.]|`|trfuEiIqaa	there are two possibilities:  first, the big bang is estimated to have happened long enough ago that it is no longer visible. the reason the past is visible is that light only travels so fast, and so the light we see now is the light that was emitted long ago. this is the theory that i am more apt to believe in.  the second is that there was no big bang. its possible. not likely, but possible.     hope this helps!!!!    p.s. mater cannot travel the speed of light, because when it does it reaches infinite mass, which is impossible. therefore, the light from the big bang would actually be int he OPPOSITE direction of earth from the locaiton of the big bang, and it woudl not be detectable, since it is moving away, not towards. we can only get the reflecitns, known as background radiation|`|eYpE4bp2aa	Because it was not some (relatively) small explosion that occurred somewhere out in the universe.

I have the answer.    when you look out into distant space...you are correct, you are looking further and further into the past, the further your vision sees. SO, if you look about 5 lightyears out, you see the light that was emmited in space 5 years ago in that spot....  If you look 14 billion lightyears away, you see nothing. this is (and i do highlight) "SUPPOSEDLY" because the universe is between 13 and 14 billion years old.  .  BUTTTTTTTTTTTTTT  :D IF you look a little bit less far than that, you should be able to see the light that was emitted right after this "Big-Bang" occured!!!! !!! !!!! !!! =D   super cool huh?|`|aBazvBnAaa	http://au.youtube.com/user/Tigerf0x    ^^^^^  GREAT space vids/ science       reconmend|`|qJrTInyBaa	There is no big bang look at the universe and you look at the face of God

It then gets eaten by animals, released back into the air and starts again.    Carbon is taken from the air by plants, eaten by animals which then release it back to the atmosphere.    There are numerous examples.

w2nfvZ0caa	"The limit as x approaches c equals [a constant]." The answer is the constant that "c" is approaching. This is because the function is the constant, and when a function is a constant then the only thing it can be approaching is itself (because the constant is the function).

DphsXWkOaa	Newton never understood what gravity was. He knew how to explain the mathematics of gravity, but he never figured out what made objects orbit and attract. Then, Einstein revolutionized science with the general relativity theory. Einstein postulated that things with mass warp space time. Meaning, if you think of space time as a trampoline, and you place a heavy object, the trampoline/space time warps. This causes other objects to orbit and attract.            Motion does not affect how one views the speed of light. The speed of light is constant, now matter what the speed or the vantage point of the observer is. Time is not absolute because the speed of light is absolute. Time must slow down in order for all motion in the universe to be relative, which it is. What remains the same for all reference frames is the speed of light.|`|D5QgyGbXaa	Newton's space was a firm grid, and  thought gravity was the attractive force between two or more masses.  Einstein thought that mass creates curves in space, and moving bodies and light would follow curved paths in the presence of curved space produced by mass.|`|AA10222010	"...how does Newtons theory of gravity differ from Einsteins theory of gravity?..."  Newton saw gravity as an actual force, while Einstein proved that instead gravity is an actual distortion of space caused by the presence of mass.    "...how does motion affect the speed of light?..."  Motion doesn't affect the speed of light. No matter how fast the source of light is moving, light will always move away from that source at the same velocity.     "...is time absolute?..."  Einstein showed us that time is *not* absolute, like there's no Cosmic Master Clock that ticks off the correct time for the entire universe. Instead, the rate of time will be different between two observers moving at different speeds relative to each other.    "...What remains the same for all reference frames?)..."  The laws of physics are the same in all reference frames throughout the universe.|`|4pw41geQaa	The different between Newton theory of gravity and Einstein theory of gravity is....     Remember that Newton sit down under the apple tree right. And then the apple fell down on his head. And he looked up and he saw the moon. So he realize that not only the apple that fall down because of the gravitational force of the Earth, but also the moon that fall down because of Earth gravitational force. So he said that the Earth gravitational force will attract with the moon and the moon gravitational force will attract with the Earth. But his theory is nearly correct the mistake is that. He said that not only the apple that fall down because of gravitational force, but also the moon. If it likes that the Earth gravitational force will attract to the moon and the moon gravitational force will attract with Earth and it will impact each other because of their gravitational force. Newton know that it was right, but he still don't know how it work need to wait until a great physicist in 20th century come his name was Albert Einstein     Albert Einstein theory said that an object that have mass or energy (Mass and energy are related) will make space and time curve right. An object that has a very high mass will make space-time curve quite deep. It means that this object has a very high gravitational force. And if the object has low mass it will make space-time curve not quite deep. It means that this object has low gravitational force. And if the object has a vey high energy that means it has a very high gravitational force and if the object has low energy that means it has low gravitational force. And the objects that have gravitational force will attract each other, but Einstein consider about that too. If the gravitational force of the objects attract each other that mean it will hit each other right. So he said that there is a force that resist a force of the gravitational force (If I not remember it wrong it a negative energy {Negative energy is an energy that resist the force of gravity})* Straight away Im not sure I need to go back and watch the video again     Gravitational force has an effect on everything in the universe like photon particles. Einstein proved that even photon particles (Light) still can not resist the force of gravity. Even it travel in a speed of light or 300,000km/s. Have you ever see a solar eclipse before that might explain about that a light form the sun travel to the Earth right, but how because that the moon block the light from the sun to the Earth isnt it. So how can it travel to Earth then it because of the gravitational force of the moon that makes the light travel in curve and then that light travel to Earth and you know what this is special and general relativity.

For me, the pros:  interesting work, great ability to take care of patients (you are responsible for their life while they're in your hands in a very visceral way), and the opportunity to direct your career in some very different ways (you don't have to stay solely in the OR; some anesthesiologists work with chronic pain patients, for example).  I happen to like being in the OR, too.  The money is good and in the long run, the lifestyle can be too.    Cons:  usually no continuity of care--you see the patient once before and at surgery and that's generally it.  Hours:  at least during residency, you have to keep surgery hours, and I hate having to get up at 5 AM.  And then there's people who think that all you do is sit around in the OR playing with dials.|`|AA11432707	Are you in your third or fourth year of med school?  If not, it's a moot point.

AA10222010	The Oort Cloud consists of the remains of material that never formed into planets some 4.5- to 5-billion years ago when the solar system was developing within a roughly spherical cloud of nebular material. Today, our sun's gravity and the velocity through space of individual cometary bodies influences the shape of the Oort Cloud.
AA11513203	Embryological similarities refers to structures in common between two species, but disappears in one species and not the other.   This provides  *evidence* of common ancestry.  For example, we know that dolphins and humans are both mammals ... but that dolphins do not have legs but humans do.   Nevertheless, dolphin *embryos* have leg buds just as humans do ... but in dolphins these disappear, while in humans these leg buds develop into legs.   This is *evidence* that dolphins and humans (and all mammals) share a common ancestor that had legs.    Chemical similarities refers to proteins that are similar, *but not identical*, between species.  For example, all primates use a protein called insulin to regulate blood sugar ... but these are not chemically *identical* ... the insulin molecule varies in "spelling" (the unique sequence of amino acids) from species to species.   Those "spelling differences" act like *markers* that point clearly to which primates are more closely related to each other than others.   So these point to clear pattern of common ancestry.

YIW1KIi6aa	Expert systems are widely accepted to support the operators of blast furnaces. Operational savings, improvements in furnace stability and product quality, have been shown in numerous, worldwide installations of the two leading systems, namely the VAiron Closed Loop Expert System and the VAIF  Blast Furnace Expert System (former Rautaruukki BFES).    The focus of the paper is to compare these two systems. Highlights of both systems, such as closed-loop control or neural network applications, are presented and described. Details about these systems have been published at conferences and in different journals extensively.    Experience and operational results achieved in several installations worldwide are presented.    Currently, the advantages of the two systems are combined in an advanced, state-of-the-art system. The main features of the new system, which will be the next step in blast furnace expert system based control, is also described in this paper.    The Finnish steel company Ruukki (formerly Rautaruukki) and the Austrian steelmaker voestalpine Stahl GmbH--experienced early on that automation can play a key role in cost reduction. Therefore, both steelworks installed powerful process models as well as expert systems and other Artificial Intelligence methods.    Ruukki approached the market with three products and has sold 40 installations worldwide since 1979:    --Rautaruukki Blast Furnace Supervision System (BFSS)    --Rautaruukki Blast Furnace Expert System (BFES)    --Rautaruukki Blast Furnace Neural System (BFNS)    VAI entered the market in 1991 with the VAiron Process Optimisation System that has been installed at about 30 furnaces since then.

TDlVhthjaa	This one is actually easier than it looks, although it takes a while to work it out    You need to find the Least Common Multiple between  2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,and 10. Since some of these are already multiples of others, the only way you can find this out is by writing all of these in expoential form. The Math Forum can explain how to do that for you            2          2^1              3          3^1                 4          2^2                  5          5^1                 6          2^1*3^1              7          7^1                 8          2^3                  9          3^2                 10          2^1*5^1        The LCM is the smallest number that includes all of the factors above. Just Take Factors from above with the highest exponents, multiply them, and your result here will be your exponent:    2^3 x 3^2 * 5^1 * 7^1    8 x 9 x 5 x 7 = 2520.    Since you're being asked to provide the smallest integer other than one, your base is going to be the NEXT smallest integer to one, which is 2.    So, 2^2520 is your smallest integer, since    (2^1260)^2 is a square  (2^840)^3 is a cube  (2^630)^4 is a fourth  (2^504)^5 is a fifth  (2^420)^6 is a sixth  (2^360)^7 is a seventh  (2^315)^8 is an eighth  (2^280)^9 is a ninth, and  (2^252)^10 is a tenth.    There you go!|`|RxukJqL5aa	Well, it's pretty easy to see that it'll be 2^{some power}, so we just want to see what power that is.    Well, it'll be a square if the power is a multiple of 2...  it'll be a cube if the power is a multiple of 3...  it'll be a fourth power if the power is a multiple of 4...  and so on.    So we want to find the smallest number which is a multiple of 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, and 10.  This is just the least common multiple.  Whatever way we get the answer, we find that the least common multiple is 2520.    Remembering that this is the exponent, we write the smallest such integer as:  2^2520|`|WZeUrVXFaa	wouldn't it just be 2^10?

Meaning, if a person does worse while listening to Country, how will you know whether it's because Country music is bad for Math, or it's because the person hates Country?    If I'm correct, then I think the best thing to do would be to choose one genre and play different styles.  I would choose a genre least likely to be familiar to the subjects, such as Classical. Then try different tempos, or you know, like bigger vs. smaller orchestras, different composers, etc.    Still kind of subjective, but the more variables you remove, the better the experiment.

DhLIo8nbaa	I know how you feel becuse I am a recovering addict but now I work in a drug and alcohol counselor and I detox people daily.  I do not know how long you were on them for but most doctors know that if you take them for a long time then you are going to have a bit of wiothdrawel because you may not be addicted but you may be physically dependent.  Which are two completely different things.  The main question is this....did you take the pills the way they were prescribed or did you take more than you should.  If you were abusing them and taking more than you should have then yes you probably are an addict.  If you were taking them as prescribed and now are having detox symptons then you were only physically dependent.  Major detox is when you are having the cold sweats having diarrhea, runny nose and alot of sneezing and immense stomach pains and you cant sit still, so if you are not experiencing those feelings then you will be okay.  If you are having those feelings then maybe you should check yourself into a detox but if not then you will be okay in a couple days, at most 3 days...so hang in there.

OXsRXLx1aa	Dirt.    If it is a very large ball it will roll faster on dirt as it would tend to slip (physic term) on grass (meaning part of its energy isn't converted as it overcomes friction forces).    If it is a very small ball it would do better on compacted dirt as grass would tend to oppose its motion (by being larger than it).    The only cases where a ball would "roll" faster on grass than on dirt would be if the dirt was composed of very large particles that incurred a greater coefficient of friction that the grass would. The fact that grass compacts to form a smooth surface for things to pass over for minimal damage (say a very strong wind), means that if compared to a coarse gravel surface something would roll well over it. Otherwise it would "roll" over a dirt surface more easily.    Unless it was muddy dirt.Then the shear forces in the mud would prevent the ball from rolling smoothly as it would adhere to the surface.|`|52414242fe3ad4a32e2f2dfe56e02f62aa	How long is a piece of string?

But since the UV rays come from the sun and since the sun changes upper atmospheric chemistry through photo-dissociation, the ozone would eventually come back. (Barring the aliens who keep coming and mining it from the poles.)|`|X8LNbaKQaa	The ultraviolet part of the solar spectrum would reach the ground a lot stronger than it does.  This has happened over the south pole through the famous ozone hole that was measured from space.    Here are the absorption spectra of some components of the atmosphere. Where the curves go up, the gases absorb strongly, and where down, pass that wavelength with little absorption.     http://www.iitap.iastate.edu/gccourse/fo...    Note that only ozone has high absorption for wavelengths shorter than 0.3 microns (ultraviolet).    --   Regards,    John Popelish|`|2lQ8DJAcaa	More ozone would form immediately below it in the troposphere.

qsdqStBaaa	Well, a consumer is just an organism that has to consume (eat) another organism in order to live. So in a coral reef, a consumer would just be any animal that eats another. Examples would be reef sharks, predatory fish, crabs, etc. Consumers can also be animals that eat plants--not always carnivores. Plants are almost always producers, the opposite of consumers, meaning they obtain energy from the sun.

O3zVn37Eaa	I can give you some useful advice!    To choose a high quality mobile crusher.    First I think you should consider Integrity,as the mobile crusher station is a portable machine that it need a very good integration,if series of crushers equipment can't be connected together, then it is not a very good equipment.    Second,you should pay attention to Operability,then the plant is more conducive to locate in the reasonable region of the crushing sites, which provides more flexible space and reasonable layout for the crushing process flow.     Third,I think you should care the Production and easy maintenance ,for that you can get low cost but high capacity.    As far as I know, I've heard a factroy can provide you best mobile crushers, their crushers have a lot of fetures as I typed. If you're interesed ,you can go to the site :  http://www.zenithcrusher.com/ver2.0/Prod...|`|BO22qiByaa	SO many companies can provide you mobile crusher ,if you want to choose a best one,you can visir:  http://www.zenithcrusher.com|`|9KtpLh8caa	Mobile crusher is also called Portable Crusher.The highlights include:  ?

AA10313886	This is a conservation of momentum problem so    mbird X vbird1+mswing X vswing1 = mbird X vbird2+mswing X vswing2    since both bird and swing are at rest initially, the left side of this equation is zero. this leaves mbird X vbird2 = -(mswing X vswing2)    mbird is 0.052kg  mswing is 0.153kg  vbird2 is 2m/s    fill in these numbers and solve for vswing2    you should get -.6797 m/s which confirms the idea that a bird flying forward off a swing would push the swing backwards. this also confirms the suspicion that the swing should have slower velocity than the bird since the swing is heavier.
2lQ8DJAcaa	GNATS: General term that is given to a variety of smaller flies. Some feed on the blood of animals, including human beings, giving a painful bite. Others do not bite and feed on vegetation or waste. Flies love human waste, not only can they feed on it, they use it as a breeding ground, that and stagnated water are their favourites. The way in which the gnats eat can vary depending on what they feed on, but in most cases they stick their nose like mouth into the food and suck the juices out like sucking liquid through a straw. The following is just one way these insects can and do affect our lives.    One thing is for sure, they are here to stay and unfortunately they are something we shall all have to live with. The Midges are also from the Fly family, and look like tiny mosquitoes which are their distant cousins, but true Midges do not bite. These insects often appear at dusk in large numbers. Some people have not heard of Midges and may call them Gnats - both are correct as Gnats (as previously outlined) is a general term for small flies. Contrary to popular belief, some are not really Midges, they include the Sand Flies which are often called 'biting midges' and found mainly close to water. Their bite can be very painful. Just remember - when having a picnic close to water - beware !|`|AAMlJqUlaa	They have teeth but they don't eat anything.    A gnat's tooth, often referred to as a Axiomatic bicuspid, is similar to the tooth of the Fruit fly.    Gnats teeth are used as a defense mechanism, to bite rival males or predators in self-defese.    Gnats "eat" through respiration. They breathe while flying, and small microbes enter their gut, to be digested for nutrition.|`|KzNoxRwbaa	yes and apple sauce|`|qv0tr0fqaa	everything has teeth even snails big big teeth especially triops if you give them orange juice
NnY1A6P2aa	For a mating like that to be possible and an offspring to be created both species would have to share the same number of chromosomes. For example humans have 46 chromosomes and in THEORY we could mate with certain species of monkey and produce an offspring in which both species have share traits from each other. This is possible because monkeys as well as humans have 46 chromosomes.     A cat and dog would be impossible seeing that they have different number of chromosomes.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	If they successfully cross breed,   they are the same species by definition.  Sometimes the cross may be infertile.  ( ex. Mule - cross between donkey & horse).     Your question could be read to include insect fertilzation of plants,   where the insect is the 'vector' carrying the genetic material, but not contributing any of it's own. Even so, some species have evolved to   such an extent that the two have become inseperable.  Google or wiki 'life cycle of fig & wasp' or 'orchid & moth' eg.s)    These questions are going to lead you into some pretty advanced   biology if you chase them far enough.|`|OHPzInc8aa	a donkey and a horse. they create a mule|`|JhpOpTwMaa	Like cross breeds of animals?

t5Nrj6Txaa	Fossil evidence indicates domestic dogs around the late pleistocene epoch.  Because dogs are social animals, similar to humans, they actually do not need much domestication--they inherently are "man's best friend."  What domestication has done for dogs is remove the tendency for seeking dominance by selectively breeding animals that were less aggressive.  This resulted in an artificial neoteny.  From Russian experiments, the process from wild animal to domestic breed takes about 50 years.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tame_Silver...|`|rkkIyPoQaa	Well over 10,000 years if I'm not mistaken.

AA11432707	We keep patients alive during surgery.  We monitor and control physiologic functions while keeping the patient comfortable for the procedure.  In addition to general anesthesia, we do spinals, epidurals, sedation, nerve blocks, chronic pain management and ICU management.

Some people also just have bad reactions to it so they need to be in the room to make sure they are okay.|`|klmAEcCraa	he/she is only involved if the patient has to be asleep. he/she makes sure that the patient is still alive and not in any pain or discomfort and still asleep.  hope this was helpful!|`|bbwveGggaa	He's a medical doctor who is trained to administer anesthesia and manage the medical care of patients before, during and after surgery.

3af30c08175e2bc96bcd85540e09d175aa	The fact of evolution has been accepted by all but a few scientists, and is really the bedrock of modern biological science. Where the study of evolution is at today is sequencing the genomes of more and more species, to better understand how they are related. The results are causing science to reevaluate the family relationships set up a hundred or more years ago. For instance, the hippo looks like it would be related to pigs and rhinos, but genetic evidence now supports the idea that they are much more closely related to whales and dolphins.    There is also a lot of work being done on epigenetics, which is the study of how genes may be turned on or off. While the genetic code is straightforward, epigenetics is more complex and may play a large role in hereditable traits.    There is really so much more going on in science than is possible to tell you. Every science professor in every research university has a project they are working on.|`|vPqk1SGHaa	I don't think anyone can answer this question.

Do this for all three cities and the circles will meet at one spot, and youve just found where your earthquake happened.  Obviously, its not just used for earthquakes but you get the idea.

39f3758933add65e2634bbff1b3a9a28aa	Granites are "intrusive" rocks, which means they form below the surface where it takes them much longer too cool. Since they take so long to cool, the area's around them experience regional metamorphism where, if they have enough room to grow, minerals in the surrounding rock will begin to grow. The best place for minerals to grow is in fracures where water, heated by the cooling granite, can flow through them. Minerals from the surrounding rock become dissolved in the water where precious metals may also be found. If the concentration of certain minerals (especially sulfides) become high enough, then minerals will precipitate in these fractures, called 'veins.' Metals such as gold, silver and copper are also precipitated out of the water with these minerals. (Unfortunately so is a lot of not so nice stuff like Arsenic and Lead.)|`|bXl12I4Baa	Do to the volcanoes explosions .the extreme heat end the extreme compression create those wonderful metals.|`|52414242fe3ad4a32e2f2dfe56e02f62aa	On a per square kilometer (or mile) basis, granite does not host noticeably more ore deposits than any other rocks type. Some of the world's greatest valuable metal deposits are not related to granite at all, for example the Kupferschiefer copper deposits, Hammersley Range iron deposits and Witwatersrand gold deposits.    Most ore deposits are hydrothermal, and for a hydrothermal ore deposit to be formed, you need the following conditions:    1. a source of metal  2. a source of hydrothermal fluid  3. a pump to drive a hydrothermal convection cell,   4. hydrothermal conduits, and  5. a suitable host for metal deposition    Igneous and volcanic environments provide those conditions, so many hydrothermal ore deposits are found in (or near) igneous rocks, but not all ore deposits are hydrothermal.|`|Ippd6MuPaa	Not in the granite. In veins in the granite. Ground water moving through the rock dissolves silicon and other minerals and deposits them as vein minerals.   Most granites are also in areas of heavy metamorphism or are from deep magma so they have heavier minerals in them but not concentrated..|`|9lzNDwhZaa	Many mineral deposits, specifically ores of valuable metals are associated with granites, many are not.    I can think of two good reasons why valuable metals are often associated with or located near granites.    1) Consider that granites are often found in environments where there has been fractionation of the magma. At destructive plate margins where largely mafic oceanic plate is subducting under continental crust, a magma of the calc alkaline trend is generated. As this magma increasingly fractionates, from dioritic to granodioritic to granitic magma, so more of the ferromagnesian and calcic minerals are left behind, increasing the number of exotic minerals that are incompatible with the mafic minerals. As a result of this, tin, tungsten, uranium, niobium, tantalum (or gold, molybdenum and copper in assoc with porphyry deposits - this depends whether it is a S-type granite or an I-type granite) are commonly found associated with granites or late felsic pegmatites that are derived from the granite.    2) Unlike mafic magmas, felsic magmas have a high proportion of superheated water within them. The water acts as a flux which enables the magma to remain liquid, when it would otherwise have solidified. Being superheated water, it has the ability to pick up into solution metalliferous minerals that once pressure and temperature are reduced, are automatically precipitated. This may explain the radiation of small veins away from many granite apophyses.|`|WbVE1cXKaa	to make an ore, you need a way of collecting the target element from its very diffuse concentration in normal rock, moving it, and dropping it in concentration in a "small" volume.    Although there are numerous ways to do this, a very common mechanism is through the migration of hydrothermal fluids, which are groundwater that gets heated to very high temperatures during its migration through the shallow crust of the earth.    Of course, to heat the water, you need a source of heat.  An intrusion of hot magma provides just such an ideal source - very hot and very localizes in space.  And since we are frequently in continental crust when this occurs, the magma tends to have a granitic composition.    When you heat the water, it rises, and water comes in from the sides to replace it.  So you tend to collect elements from the large volume of rock through which the water migrates and then concentrate it in a local area above (more or less) the heat source.    A second, sometimes very important reason, is that granitic magma contains significant water (a few percent by weight), but this water doesn't incorporate into the earlier formed minerals from the magma.  As a result, the water separates from the magma as it cools and forms minerals, and it is really salty water that is full of metals and other stuff,  When this water squirts into the surrounding rock (or even the outer shell of solid granite at the edges of the magma chamber), the water and rock react and ore minerals form.      Of course, not all ores form this way and there are many variations on the general idea.      The primary reason for the relationship is that granite is the heat that drives the movement of water necessary to make the ores.|`|djmu98oUaa	Ore is basically any rock that contains some metal or mineral in economically viable amounts. While in the case of other metals in Finland, ores are often complex and contain a variety of minerals and metals.  In most granite or schist, gold averages 15 milligrams per ton. To qualify as a gold ore, the gold content must be a thousand times higher.

You may not need any programming at all, but this skill is certainly worth having. Generally speaking you can program most things in a version of C or a version of Basic. This goes for small PIC etc. micro-controllers upwards. Assembly language is fine but too tedious and specialised. I think it is good to have tried it, but not to use it, because productivity is low. It is for masochists only.    Embedded and micro-controllers.  DSPs have only C as far as I know. "C" allows you to get closer to the machine, but is more demanding. Basic makes you more dependent on someone else's kernel. All that I tried have been ok with a few idiosyncrasies that you have to work around. There is no particular speed difference, as you expect to use compiled versions of both. I would make sure any compiler has libraries, at least some device drivers and a kernel. If it provides timer functions, and simple I/O for ADC and digital ports and PWM, maybe a RTC, that is all. This implies you will buy a system with hardware on a PCB and a tailored compiler. The PLC is one approach to this that has evolved into a useful tool. I used assembler in the past when memories were small, and Basic with one or two excursions into C for micro-controllers. The kernel may take 100 Kbytes.    At the PC level a visual language is important, as that provides a better user interface. In engineering you will often want to plot graphs, especially the rolling type like a chart recorder (some call it a real time graph). That is something most of the languages are a bit slack on providing, so you have to make your own, and I recommend you make it into a control or class or whatever, so you can just drag and drop to install one or several on a screen object. You will always want serial ports to talk to hardware (USB ports usually use a virtual serial port). You will use ethernet and TCP/IP to talk to WIFI and other computers and websites.    Devices...  Off the shelf PC hardware (like an ADC device) will almost always have drivers that come with it, providing a variety of interfaces from VXD (virtual device drivers that load at boot time), or DLLs. There is a move towards USB to connect such devices now. The driver package is installed, then the software just calls functions.    I was quite happy with VB6 for a PC, but the .NET framework came along and meant relearning chunks of it. VB6 has been crippled for VISTA, and .NET is now VB8 (which you can get free from Microsoft in a level suitable for engineering). Can't complain about that. I have not made much headway with VB8, no incentive. I have to say that PC languages are focused on the user interface, internet, and databases so that engineering applications are not considered much at all. It means you have to think in terms of doing what PCs do.    Open Source? It is getting better all the time, so this means that systems to program for Linux etc are becoming more and more available. There is an advanced version of Quick Basic, but VB like languages are limited. There are versions of C as this is the Linux home ground. There is a commercial version of Basic (Real Basic) that compiles for various operating systems. I have never tried it. I should also mention Power Basic.|`|yzGsGlPEaa	Embedded-C, Embedded-C++ and Asembly Languages are very useful to you.....pls dont lgnore these languages..  u can gather abut these language usages in ur filed...

Your spending power in India may be a bit higher than a direct currency conversion implies but in any case the decision is made for you - you can't get any non-toy telescope for anywhere near that money, so you are looking at binoculars.  Even then your options are limited by your budget.  The "standard" astro sizes are 7x50 and 10x50 but those binos use quite a lot of glass compared to everyday binos so are not particularly cheap.  You may be able to find some within your price range but if so make sure they are decent quality - suitably robust and preferably BK-7 (or ideally Bak-4) glass, fully coated for better light transmission.  If you can't get one of those sizes 8x42s are are the best everyday size to use for astronomy - you should be able to find at least a usable pair within that budget. <br>  <br>  To answer your question more generally, both telescopes and binos have their uses.  Binos are convenient and need no set up, and provide a wide field of view.  Telescopes have more light grab but need setting up, are less portable, and in any case binos are often useful simply to point your scope in the right direction.  I have a very nice pair of Canon 12x36 image stabilised binos which I wouldn't want to be without even though I have some far more impressive scopes.  However, those cost ￡450 here in the UK.  You can get a perfectly good scope of reasonable aperture for ￡450.|`|MMUGLjsPaa	I have both.<br>  A good pair of binoculars say 10X50 are really a must for any astronomer's toolkit.  If you want to hold off on buying a scope then a good set of binoculars is a great way to get into astronomy without selling out a lot of money (mine were about $150US).<br>  <br>  If you've been out to the Astronomical League (AL) Website they've also go a cool observing challenge for people with binoculars.  If you complete the challenge they'll send you a pin, certificate, and mention your name in their national publication "The reflector"  You will have to be a member of the AL or an astronomy club that has membership in the AL.  See the link below.<br>  <br>  Some other tools you should consider are:<br>  1) a red light flashlight <br>  2) a good set of laminated star maps<br>  3) a coverall garment to keep you warm<br>  4) a warm pair of shoes, gloves and a good observing hat.|`|17d2136cb28b3dcd96bfa98507022f5eaa	If you can manage it, get both. I own a number of telescopes, but I also use my binoculars every night. In fact, I consider binoculars an essential accessory for any telescope, as they help you figure out how to find things in the telescope; a telescope without binoculars is limited to the brightest objects. A good pair of binoculars is a lot less expensive than a telescope, though a telescope will give you high magnifications for planets that binoculars can't match. Tough decision, especially as I know how expensive optical items are in India.|`|D5QgyGbXaa	If you wish to look at star patterns, and learn the constellations and star names, you can use binoculars.  The larger ones can be very expensive, and you need a carrier or frame for their weight.<br>  If you wish good views of Moon and planets, and see faint star clusters and galaxies, you should get a medium size telescope.  A good telescope for a beginner is a six inch Dobsonian telescope.  That size is not heavy or expensive, and gathers plenty of light.  A good eyepiece or two should be bought too.  Low power views will make you happy.  Make star charts for a guide from free computer software like Cartes du Ciel.  <a href="http://www.stargazing.net/astropc/" rel="nofollow">http://www.stargazing.net/astropc/</a><br>  If you can get to one, visit a local astronomy club meeting and star party.  There you will see different telescopes, learn viewing methods.|`|110fda6e94f73c2bbaae8136ca9a20ddaa	What Geoff just said above------

To stop them soldiers need to carry around heavy, bulky, and uncomfortable plates.  These plates are rigid and strong enough to withstand rifles.  It is nearly impossible to cover your entire body in this material and still be able to move efficiently.  There is nothing that will ever make our soldiers completely bulletproof, especially from getting their arms blown off.  Heavy artilery cannot be stopped by buildings or tanks, personal gear has not chance of doing that.
eiim3tJuaa	http://www.amrottclub.org/tale%20of%20ta...  ...Docking at 2 to 4 days old of a puppy whose nervous system is not fully developed is definitely preventative medicine in this case....    http://www.scrottrescue.com/Rottie_tail....   Usually, puppy tails are docked during the first week after birth. At this time, the bones are still soft and the nerve endings are not fully sensitized. Even then, the procedure of cutting through the bone, tissue and nerves is painful and can be temporarily traumatic for the newborn.    After the first week or two, docking the tail, while a relatively simple procedure for a vet, is a very painful and potentially dangerous amputation for the dog. Following many years of study and controversy, the practice of tail docking has been banned in Australia and most European countries.    http://www.therottweilerchronicle.com/ne...  http://www.avma.org/press/releases/08112...    http://www.idausa.org/facts/cossurgery.h...  http://www.britfeld.com/tail-dock/facts....  http://guardianrottweilers.com/tail.aspx  http://www.vomfloodrottweilers.com/artic...  http://rottweilerpuppiesblog.com/  http://www.dogchannel.com/dog-vet-librar...|`|2lQ8DJAcaa	In the United Kingdom, only veterinarians are allowed to perform these procedures. However, few surgeries are done because the Council of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons has ruled these procedures are unethical and inhumane, except for medical reasons. The 39-member Council of Europe Convention opposes docking and cropping, and 14 countries ban these procedures as unjustified mutilation.     If humans want to bob their noses, augment their breasts, or pierce their bodies, it's their decision. But, to subject a dog to butchery because of imperious "breed standards"is nothing less than cruelty, and must be condemned.|`|UvPUopA8aa	It's what the US breed standard calls for. How did this come about?    Originally rottweilers worked hard in very dirty conditions for most of their lives. As cattle drovers, they were in close contact with livestock and their droppings. A tail could become encrusted with cattle droppings, weighing it down. Likewise, the tail could be stepped on or injured by one of the cattle. In such unsanitary conditions, even a minor injury to the tail could become dangerously infected. Lacking veterinary care, it's entirely conceivable that the smallest cut could lead to death.    It was a much safer option for owners back then to dock the tails when the puppies were still in the care of the mother instead of risking the loss of a cattle worker later in life. Now days if a rottweilers tail is docked an it's not being shown it's likely just done for appearance.

gUlY0L5Daa	Your plant is growing in pot or on the ground. Wilting showed symptom of water related problem - either not enough water especially for potting plant, or water transport system, the vascular bundle problems.    For potting plants, check if the soil is too dry. Water your plant slowly with little  amount of water at a time. If your water drained too fast, your soil is either too much sand, the soil portion of your potting compost had been drained during your regular watering or your plant roots' biomass had grown too large and need repotting.     Or otherwise, just check  the root system and look for unusual sigh on the root system. If it is dying, drying or rotting or sign of insect bite or formation of gall, your plant could have been atttacked by some pathogenic fungus, (eg. Fusarium sp., Phytophthora sp., etc) or attack by root feeding insects, or could be by nematodes (eg Meloidogyne sp.). Take a note on this especially if  your plant is growing on ground    Too little light, especially for potting plant, the plant will not show sign of wilting, but will grow slowly  and gradually the stem and leaves become smaller and eventually cease to grow. This is especially true if your plant is growing in pot and placed at a dark corner of your house; your plant is utilizing its storage food rather than developing new food for it's growth.|`|743f401bac126bdc42eda174751e5d3caa	The first thing to do is to take the plant out of the pot and examine the root system (if it is potted).  If the roots look healthy but are very dense, you should increase the size of the pot, loosen the roots that are very tightly bound, and repot the plant in new potting soil.  If the roots are only near the top of the soil in the pot, the plant has been over-watered.  Make sure the pot is draining properly.  If you have the plant indoors, it could be wilting due to excessively dry air from your heating system. If you have a good plant nursery near by, you could take the plant to the store for a possible diagnosis.|`|rHTxDyJjaa	Wilting is always caused by lack of turgor pressure, meaning that insufficient H20 is available to the plant's extremities. This can occur for many reasons. Obvious examples include such things as a rotting root system or insufficient water supply. A less obvious reason is low light level, which causes the plants to halt gas exchange, an important elements in promoting the plant's water column.     In your case, you may want to try to determine the species of the Poinsettia. Some species are not perennial and die shortly after completing their life cycles (i.e., flowering and fruits). Below is the abstract from Dressler (1961, Ann. Miss. Bot. Gard. 4:329-341). The paper is available via JSTOR and includes a key.     "The position of Poinsettia in the tribe Euphorbieae is discussed, and a key is given for the American genera. The name P. heterophylla is found to be applicable to a weedy tropical plant, and the distinctions between this and the North American P. cyathophora are tabulated. Gametic chromosome numbers of 14 and 28 are reported for both P. cyathophora and P. dentata, while P. heterophylla shows only n = 14. The geographic variation of the North American annual species is briefly discussed. A key is given for the 11 species recognized, of which two are described as new: P. coccinea and P. inornata, while new combinations are published in Poinsettia for P. colorata, P. pentadactyla and P. restiacea."|`|3OuIfxbWaa	Most plants, when they wilt, need more water, as their cells are not full enough to support the plant. But, I'd recommend you'd look up the conditions your plant needs in particular to make sure that you're not over feeding it or under-sunning it.

DCQc92Tiaa	The ratio is 3:4, so the answer must be a multiple of 7 because there are three males to every 4 females.  Therefore the answer is 44    Hope that helps!|`|XHSl0wKzaa	44    there are 3x males and 4x females, or 7x total    so the number of people must be a multiple of 7  44 is not!|`|j6dAbXCAaa	Let's see... since you can't have a portion of a person, if you had the least number of people there, how many total would there be?    3:4 would mean 7 total people.    So the number of people at the party would need to be a multiple of 7. I'll let you take it from there. Good luck!|`|kJzIGlTPaa	Well, 3:4 means there has to be 3 males for every 4 females. This means the lowest possible total number of people at the party has to be 7, which is 3 males plus 4 females. So just eliminate the ones that are not multiples of 7. 70, 14, 35, and 63 are all multiples of 7. 44 is not. So the answer is 44.|`|Dcf7FqQwaa	44  Basically the total number of people in the party (males and females) should be a multiple of 3+4 =7.  (14,35,63,70) are all multiples of 7.  But 44 is not.

Stars move across the sky like all objects we see at night due to the Earth's rotation - they appear to rise in the east and set in the west many hours later.    Satellites in orbit around the Earth will reflect sunlight and will move against the background stars - often they will move across the sky in minutes, and they can also twinkle.

vSkqJ813aa	Before briefly discussing Black Holes, I will outline Einstein's General Theory of Relativity.     With the publication of the Special Theory of Relativity in 1905, Einstein removed the Newtonian concepts of instant action at a distance (Universal gravitation) and Newtonian Galilean Relativity (two high velocities simply sum to give an even higher one if they are in the same direction). Within his relativistic mechanics, no signal can travel faster than the speed of light and all observers, whatever their frame of reference, must find the laws of physics to be the same. Furthermore, Einstein imposed an upper limit upon all velocities that of the speed of light, which all observers must agree to be the same!    Over the next ten years, Einstein sought to improve upon his Special Theory of Relativity. In his quest to produce a General Theory of accelerating frames of reference, Einstein used the principle of equivalence between a gravitational force and acceleration - as his 'yard stick' - for his deliberations. Einstein finally found the Theory of General Relativity in 1915.     This geometric theory of gravity is a cause and effect theory. The theory describes the fabric of space-time as a medium that may be distorted by the presence of mass and energy. In an earlier theory (The Special Theory of Relativity (1905)), Einstein had related mass and energy in the famous equation: -    E = mc2    From this concept, he described the curvature or distortion of space-time as due to the total sum of mass-energy present within the region of distorted space. It is the curvature of space-time we call gravity. Thus, our planet follows the 'straightest' path or path of least action whilst it orbits the mutually curved space around the Sun. An object falling to earth, under the pull of gravity, is following the curvature of space in the region around the surface of the Earth. Einstein described the relationship between space-time curvature and the mass-energy causing it, in the tensor field equation: -    G = 8T    Where 'G' is the Einstein tensor representing the 'gravity' or curvature of space-time and 'T' is the total energy tensor representing the mass-energy creating the gravitational curvature of the space-time.       Black Holes are created when heavy stars, above 3 to 4 solar masses, end their final core fusion cycles and collapse under the inexorable inward pull of gravity. Some heavy stars shed much of their outer mass during their final giant stages and or detonate as a type II supernova. Those stars often leave behind a rapidly spinning neutron star. In such stars, the relativistic degeneracy pressure of the neutrons balances the inward pressure of gravity. However, theory suggests that neutron stars cannot have masses in excess of 3 to 4 solar masses, known as the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit. Thus, any stellar remnant with more, than this mass, will collapse into a space-time singularity known as a black hole. A Black Hole has an intense gravitational field and it will 'snack' upon material falling into it from its surrounding accretion disc, if it has one, or from nearby stars that become trapped in its gravity well. Not even light can escape if it reaches the event horizon of the Black Hole where the gravitational fields grip on space-time, itself, results in motion into the singularity only  even for photons with a zero rest mass!    Wikipedia comments that, '... According to the American Astronomical Society, every large galaxy has a supermassive black hole at its center. The black holes mass is proportional to the mass of the host galaxy, suggesting that the two are linked very closely. The Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based telescopes in Hawaii were used in a large survey of galaxies.    For decades, astronomers have used the term "active galaxy" to describe galaxies with unusual characteristics, such as unusual spectral line emission and very strong radio emission. However, theoretical and observational studies have shown that the active galactic nuclei (AGN) in these galaxies may contain supermassive black holes. The models of these AGN consist of a central black hole that may be millions or billions of times more massive than the Sun; a disk of gas and dust called an accretion disk; and two jets that are perpendicular to the accretion disk.    Although supermassive black holes are expected to be found in most AGN, only some galaxies' nuclei have been more carefully studied in attempts to both identify and measure the actual masses of the central supermassive black hole candidates. Some of the most notable galaxies with supermassive black hole candidates include the Andromeda Galaxy, M32, M87, NGC 3115, NGC 3377, NGC 4258, and the Sombrero Galaxy.    Astronomers are confident that our own Milky Way galaxy has a supermassive black hole at its center, in a region called Sagittarius A*:    A star called S2 (star) follows an elliptical orbit with a period of 15.2 years and a pericenter (closest) distance of 17 light hours from the central object.     The first estimates indicated that the central object contains 2.6 million solar masses and has a radius of less than 17 light hours. Only a black hole can contain such a vast mass in such a small volume.   Further observations strengthened the case for a black hole, by showing that the central object's mass is about 3.7 million solar masses and its radius no more than 6.25 light-hours.  ...'|`|8b074cb8de09c54e1e5f13d41706212baa	because they are practically the only thing that can hold all that galactical mass together...and gravity is created by the curvature of spacetime as stated in albert einstiens theory of general relativity.

sZFLtCbdaa	I too have noticed the weather changing. I have been noticing that for over 50 years. What I have noticed is that the weather gods don't follow a script. They do as they please. For example. Snow fall every year is never the same. Some years it only snows 10 times, other years it snow 5 times. Still other years it is snowing at least every other day. I can prove that one. I have back muscles that are bulging.   One winter I went through 2 shovels.   In the fall I notice that oak trees are not always producing acorns. Some years they produce so many acorns, that even squirrels won't pick them up. Other years, zero acorns. That's when the deer come in in winter and eat all my evergreen bushes.  I live far away from large bodies of water. But I bought a boat anyway. Some springs we have so much snow melt, that flooding is a major problem. Other springs it is drought. The boat has bailed me out.  So yes, that weather change you mention is all natural.

The Fahrenheit scale is not exactly linear to the Celcius Scale. For Higher Temperatures, Fahrenheit readings will be higher. HOWEVER, both Scales coincide at -40 degrees(Celcius/Fahrenheit), point after which Celcius readings will be higher than Fahrenheit ones.    i.e: 100 Celcius is 212 Fahrenheit  212 F -32 = 180 * (5/9) = 100 C    but -40.5 Celcius is -41 Fahrenheit, which is a lower value  - 41 - 32 = -73 * (5/9) = - 40.5 C

k5Ece8BTaa	The theory of the world ending in 2012 isn't true, it's just a silly hoax. The world isn't going to end on December 21, 2012, just the Mayan Calendar ends. One of several Mayan calendars is the Long Count calendar, which is reset to day 0 every 1,872,000 days or 7057.5 years. The next reset date, by some calculations, is December 21, 2012. This is not a prediction of the end of the world. The Mayan Calendar has to end sometime. Besides, nobody can't predict when the end of the world is. You shouldn't always believe what you hear from other people. The scientific evidence about 2012 doesn't go together. Those who spread rumors about 2012 should be punished. You know what is sad, people may commit suicide over this thinking its the end of the world. Or maybe some people would get unwise with their money and spend it all like crazy and be in thousands of dollars in debt, just because they thought the world would end. Then they have to pay it off later and deal with the stress of those bills. That's why those who spread rumors about 2012 should be punished. You know what else is false about this 2012 garbage?     ? Planet X (Nibiru) isn't going to hit the Earth it doesn't exist.  ? Poles are switching everyday, this isn't going to happen all in just 1 day. This process takes thousands of years. Throughout geological history there has been may pole switches and life has still survived.  ? Also people are saying these poles will switch in one day due to a black hole. That's NOT true. The nearest black hole to our galaxy is 1600 light years away.  ? Sun will be lined up with a sunspot, but it doesn't mean it will wipe out all life on Earth. One time ago, Earth was lined up with a sunspot and people were on it and everybody didn't just die.  ? There is not going to be catasphoic earthquakes.   ? Just because certain cultures predict it like the Chinese, Japanese and all of them doesn't mean their predictions are correct. As I said, nobody can predict such a thing.  ? No comment will hit Earth.  ? If you have been watching the History Chanel about 2012 or anything like that, all they are just trying to do is scare people so they can make money.  ? We are going to have a rare night sky, nothing more. No asteriods, no comments, etc.    Each time the end the world is predicted. They are always wrong. Here are all the predictions of when the world would end and each time they where wrong. Every year there is a prediction like this. I'm sure that if 2012 doesn't happen, they will think of something else. Through out history the end has been predicted but has never happened.|`|524f656a521cc9375efb6821b1b2063daa	The whole thing began as astrologers noticed that a point called the winter solstice was crossing the Milky Way (and the Galactic equator).    Astrologers being those who believe that the sky runs our lives, decided that this "event" must mean something special. In a way, this is strange as astrologers have generally ignored the Galactic equator (being a recent invention, it was not part of the "classical" astrology).    So they made "New Age"-type predictions (a new chance for humanity, more peace, brotherly love among the nations, etc.).    Still, not much was made of it, because a lot of our Western Civilization "New Age" stuff is normally based on the Spring Equinox moving through the constellations (e.g., we are moving from the age of Pisces to the age of Aquarius).  We (western civilization) had no reason to pay attention to the Winter Solstice.    Until...    Later, someone found that the Mayans had a day-count calendar that reaches a round figure on a date somewhat in the general area of the "event" (even though the "event", described above, does not happen in 2012).    And this date, in the Mayan calendar, had a direct link with the Winter Solstice. On the day we call 2012.12.21, the Mayan calendar reaches the round figure 13.00.00.00.00 in their counting system.    This is not surprising, since the day of Winter solstice was, every year, New Year's Day for the Mayans. If you are setting up a calendar with an important round figure, you fix it so that it falls on New Year's Day. Big celebration. Lots of cake.    "Well", someone thought "this must be an important date that is linked with the event we described earlier". Because of the link to the Winter Solstice. This is where Jos came in to the act.    So the New Age predictions started again. Except, this time, some hoaxers got into it and decided to crank up the scare factor. (Some people just love to scare others, just for the fun of it)    This is when began the lies about the Mayan calendar "ending" (it does not) or the Mayans having predicted the end-of-the-world (they did not).    From that point on, there seemed to be a contest, which I have called the Big 2012 Hoax Off, as to who could come up with the biggest boldfaced lie and still get people to believe it.    All this had begun quite some time ago but we did not hear about it until the year 2000 had passed (Y2k -- the Year 2000 end-of-civilization -- had distracted us from these other lies).    ---    Meanwhile, another group had predicted the end-of-the-world for the year 2003. You see, there was to be this Planet X coming close to us, causing earthquakes, tsunamis, even pole flips.  "Nancy" had been told all this by some aliens from a planet around Zeta Reticuli (some star in the small constellation Reticulum).    Yeah! Right!    Charlatans associated with Nancy had a book for sale on how to survive the end-of-the-world of 2003.    Well, 2003 came and went, and many of us actually managed to survive the end-of-the-world... and we had not even bought their book.    So they revised the book, they changed the date to 2012 (already made popular by astrologers and by Jos). They added Nibiru and Nemesis (two more fictitious bodies) to their Planet X, and they created fake documentaries for YouTube and for television.    The matching 2012 "predictions" by Nostradamus, the Bible, the Egyptians and so on, were also created after 2003 (otherwise, they would have contradicted the 2003 end-of-the-world prediction).    You have to admit that the marketing is far better for 2012 than it was for 2003. A lot more people are talking about the 2012 end-of-the-world than they were about the 2003 end-of-the-world.    But it is still fake.|`|ad08fe27604f983a2b098f5c3a9bdfa5aa	21 December 2012: The Boilerplate Answer    We hear each day "two oh one two"   The kids all ask if it is true.

For some basic information on Mesopotamia, read the Time-Life book of that title.  Any general text on ancient history other than by fake scholars like Sitchin should give you some genuine background on the Sumerians, Babylonians, Assyrians whose civilisations spanned more than 3000 years.

In the north, all signs point to a winter.  Judging by the last 10,000 years or so, it will probably snow, more so above the arctic circle.

The entire rumor about 2012 is based on *nothing* more than a misunderstanding of the Mayan calender, and how it works.    The Mayan calender appears to those who don't know how it works to end in the year 2012. In truth, the Mayan calender is a cyclic calender, meaning that the year 2012 is only the end of a cycle. Once it hits the end, it starts over again at the beginning. (Like our year goes January to December, and then starts over again with January.)    Why anyone would attach any significance to the percieved end of a calendar written by a pagan civilisation that was unable to even predict its own downfall is beyond logical comprehension.

Both weak acids. <br>  I suggest that over a long period of time aspirin is hygroscopic i.e. absorbs water from the atmosphere.  Perhaps there's a chemical reaction due degradation resulting in the production of a small amount of acetic acid over time.  Soluble aspirin doesn't taste vinegary so I suspect that in the presence of water over a long period of time aspirin degrades and is less efficacious.  Keep the top on.  Suggest that you check out degradation products / aspirin metabolism for your reaction.

Continue this process until you get a factor.   The first one I found was x-3.    So, x = 3 is a real zero.    Using long division, the remaining polynomial after factoring out x-3 is x^2 - 2x - 24, which you can easily factor to be (x-6)(x+4).    So, the remaining zeros are x = 6 and x = -4    Your answer in the end is that the zeros are 3, 6 and -4|`|FnEstRiraa	i dont remember if that means you have to factor?    but im pretty sure you group the first two together and the last two together   first set being (x^3-5x^2) second (-18x+72)  take a x^2 out of the first set your left with x-5   so x^2 set = to 0 is =  set x-5 to zero you get five and set -18x+72 to zero and you get 4    real zeros - 0 4 5...      i hope this helps

dhJbBVjyaa	Its best if you think of this as light. When the radiation(light) hits an object, it will either be absorbed or reflected back. Some colors reflect light back better than others, white reflects all light back, others hold certain wavelengths and reflect the rest back. Black absorbs all light.    Now with clouds as they are often white, they will reflect back the light that comes from the Sun and the heat radiation from the ground. That's why its coolest when there are clouds during the day and warmest at night when their are clouds.|`|3f49d1173ab44657705ae3106bb11dc6aa	Yes, albedo is diffuse reflectivity.  Clouds and snow are good reflectors.  They are white because they are reflecting incident radiation at all wavelengths.    The reflected radiation just goes into space and gets lost.  It goes toward the stars.

Centipedes are not generally harmful to (adult) humans. Their bites can be painful but i doubt your mom's in any real danger.

D5ShDa5naa	This is a vector addition problem.    The pilot has set the plane on a course of , which can be written as 0i + 250j where 0i is the component of velocity in the x direction (0) and 250j is the component of velocity in the y direction. (The letters i and j indicate the direction to which the magnitude in front of them is applied.)    Your final vector will be the pilot's indented heading plus the velocity vector of the wind. If the angle isn't given, you're usually supposed to assume it's 45 degrees.    Writing 75 km/h at 45 degrees in component form gives , since South is the opposite of North and North has been defined to be the positive y-direction.    Adding two vectors  and  gives . (In other words, add the x-components together and the y-components together.)    Using the i/j notation, you have (0i + 250j) + (75cos(45)i - 75sin(45)j) = (0 + 75cos(45))i + (250 - 75sin(45))j.

tBO56G4laa	D batteries are only 1.5 volts, you probably wont get much light with that.    2 D-batteries in series will still only be 3 volts.    Try a 9 V battery.  Or a car battery (12 V)|`|N0UUmjDlaa	Change the bulb for a torch bulb. Some small torches have a bulb that runs on just 1 cell, a 1.5V bulb.|`|AA11323749	I think a regular D battery only provides about 1.5 volts.    If you could put 8 of them end to end they would deliver 12 volts and that would allow the 6 watts (if the batteries could discharge that fast)    It is sometimes helpful to think of electricity in wires like water flowing in pipes.    The voltage is like the pressure of the water.    The amperage (which is the wattage divided by the voltage) is like the amount of water that is flowing.    The bulb is like a little pipe that the water has to flow through.    If you have enough pressure (voltage), you can force enough water (electrical current) through the tiny pipe (light bulb) to make it bright.    A 12 volt bulb needs 12 volts across it to light as it is designed.    If you can find 2 large 6-volt batteries and put them ins series (+ to -) then you will get 12 volts.    A 9 volt battery might work well enough for a short time, but 6 watts is kind of a lot.

If there were ETs flying around, why would anyone believe that only thousands of untrained witnesses see them while all the scientists who study the skies never do? How could they be buzzing all around us while not one bit of intelligent radio transmission is being detected in SETI programs? UFO believers realize how this point devastates their claims, so they accuse the government (all the governments of the world, I guess), of covering it up. Well, lots of people just aren't happy unless they believe there is some conspiracy going on -- one which the US has kept under wraps for 11 presidential administrations. Right.         Then there is the fact that virtually all of the BEST UFO cases, when investigated, invariably turn out to be misperceptions, imaginations running wild over a sighting of some ordinary but unrecognized thing, outright fraud, and sensationalist and misleading media coverage. Then, even when the proof is overwhelming that it was nothing extraterrestrial, the story keeps coming back like the Hydra's heads. Roswell is an excellent example of this.          Finally, let's not forget that this kind of sensationalist garbage sells. Books, magazines, and TV "documentaries" will always get attention when they make outrageous claims. The facts debunking this nonsense NEVER get published, except by rare, dedicated investigators like Philip Klass, and even *he* didn't make much money off of his fine books.         There is no reason to believe that ETs are visiting our planet. This is just a modern day version of the delusions that have permeated society for thousands of years.

And some might said what about the saucer that fly around our planet. I think that was a plane more than to be a saucer. In US military they build up a plane that have a round shape. The shape of it is like a saucer. So for anyone who ever see the UFO before that might be a plane. But I'm not disrespect. I'm also think that it really has UFO. Maybe in our galaxy there might have an aliens, but they technology still not advance enough to build vehicle that can fly in the space like us.And maybe some still be a cells, some might be a creature already, some might in a stone age and some might have a tech enough to build up something like space ship already.

JYyOjAqdaa	Think of Jupiter as an unborn star.  It never achieved a mass that was significant enough to start a nuclear reaction, so its basically a star witthout the plasma, composing of about 75% Hydrogen and 25% Helium, with trace elements of stuff like methane and water.      Saturn was following in the footsteps of its older brother by about 30 million years, but also has an atmosphere that composes mainly of hydrogen (its more like 90/10 on Saturn tho) with trace elements of stuff like Ammonia, Phosphine and Methane.  All of this stuff rests on a supposedly "solid hydrogen core", but without evidence to back that up, its simply speculation.    The reason behind Neptune and Uranus' blue atmosphere is the significantly larger amount of Methane in the atmophere (which absorbs the red side of the spectrum much like nitrogen does on Earth), yet theres still much more Hydrogen and Helium on these two planets as well.  I hope that answered your question :]|`|wUNQJWuvaa	SATURN- hydrogen(about 97%), Helium(4%), and tiny amounts of ammonia and methane.  JUPITER-82 % hydrogen, 18 % helium and traces of nearly all other elements.(some say it might be a failed star during the big bang).  URANUS-so cold it's almost entirely methane.  NEPTUNE-methane lol.  PLUTO-not even considered a planet anymore but it's mostly nitrogen and carbon monoxide.

AA6Aq94vaa	The Richter Scale (the scale used for earthquakes) is logarhythmic because each whole number is 10 times the previous number.  For example an earthquake that measures 4.0 on the Richter scale is 10 times as powerful as a 3.0    Also each "point" on the richter scale is twice as powerful as the one before it.    For example: an earthquake that measures 5.3 is twice as powerful as a 5.2.     And two "points" difference on the Richter Scale is 3 times as powerful as two points before it and so on. A 5.7 is 3 times as powerful as a 5.5 and four times as powerful as a 5.4     A logarhithmic scale is used instead of a linear scale because it is easier to use in the long run
i1t4Lc3Aaa	You have the 7 and 5 correct for the last position and one has to be minus because your last term is -35.    You have the 3a and 4a correct for the first position of each because that = 12a2    Now the tricky part is to determine which is minus, the 5 or the 7 and which positions do the 3a and 4a go.    To determine this, we need to find what numbers added together = -13a    3a(-7) = -21a, and 4a(5) = 20a.  Adding these together gives us -a, so that is not correct.    Let's try 4a(-7) = -28a, and 3a(5) = 15a.  Adding these together gives us -13a so bingo, we have the middle term.    Therefore, we have the equation set up as follows so that 4a is multiplied by -7, and 3a is multiplied by 5 so we have:  (4a+5)(3a-7).

0cAuOUmoaa	A positive feedback system in biology (or anatomy in your case), is a pathway (usually controlled by enzymes) in which the output increases exponentially because each individual product from the pathway acts as a precursor to signal the making of more products.  In anatomy, childbirth in an example of a positive feedback system.  During labor, the hormone oxytocin is released to increase the women's uterine contractions.  As these contractions increase, the release of more oxytocin is stimulated as well.  The simplified pathway is oxytocin --> contractions --> more oxytocin.    A negative feedback system in anatomy is just the complete opposite.  That is, in a negative feedback system, the output of a particular pathway does not stimulate more output, BUT instead, it causes less output (or complete cessation).  An example of this is the regulation of blood sugar levels.  As the pathway that releases glucose into the blood recognizes its own level of blood glucose getting too high, it decreases its production of further glucose molecules.|`|n2ukJCP6aa	POSITIVE FEEDBACK: ok like when women are in labor they get uterine contractions, which stimulates the release of oxytocin from pituitary gland..the release of oxytocin stimulates MORE uterine contractions, which stimulates MORE oxytocin release, hence positive feedback :)    NEGATIVE FEEDBACK: uumm ok liike when your blood pressure is high, your body goes through a series of steps to try to lower it..and if it gets too low, your body (negative feedback) goes through a series of steps to raise it.|`|NbaMD4TKaa	Positive feedback continues or enhances the process that triggered it.  Example: simple population growth - people make babies, resulting in more people who can make babies, and so on.  Having more babies positively influences the population's ability to produce babies at an even greater rate in the next generation.    Negative feedback slows or stops the process that triggered it.  Example:  the population grows to the point where there are so many people that it gets harder to find food, so fewer mothers can have healthy babies, thus fewer babies are born, and population growth slows.  Having more babies when resources are scarce, negatively influences further population growth by slowing it down.

ZlOF7pPgaa	Granulocytes are a part of the innate immune system and are the first responders to infection. They have two primary jobs, to control the infection and activate the adaptive immune system. The granules are related to that first function. The granules are filled with a variety of substances the majority of which is reactive oxygen products (Hydrogen peroxide, OH. radicals), along with low pH, and defensins that are released to kill invading cells, usually by disrupting the invading cell's membrane.

gLpi67d8aa	yes they are needed. The name for that compound is aluminum carbonate, made up of two ions--the aluminum ion Al 3+, and the carbonate ion CO3 2-. So, when you want to balance the charges to make aluminum carbonate you need 2 aluminum ions and 3 carbonate ions. So the parentheses tell you that there are 3 carbonate ions. Carbonate is like a unit--you wouldn't call this Al2C3O9, you need the parentheses.|`|X8LNbaKQaa	To show what component clusters of atoms in this molecule are repeated 3 times.  It saves space like any multiplication is smaller than showing repeated addition.  But you could write Al2CO3CO3CO3, I guess.  Also you could write Al2C3O9, but then you loose the information that each CO3  (carbonate ion) is a tightly bound cluster that tends to react as a unit rather than as independent atoms.    --   Regards,    John Popelish|`|KoCI9XuTaa	because the parenthesis tell you that there are three CO3s and not three O3s|`|GgVJzDjDaa	To show that you have 3 CO3 molecules.

Carbonate is a polyatomic ion; it needs to be considered as one unit.|`|pSOQTumdaa	Al2(CO3)3 is aluminum carbonate  this is telling you that you have 3 carbonate atoms attached to 2 aluminum atoms  if you remove the parentheses, you will have Al2CO33.  this tells you that you have 2  Al atoms, 1 C atom and 33 oxygen atoms.  this is not the same compound at all|`|cOkUsbleaa	the () are needed to show that there are 3 CO3 atoms and to make it less confusing! see my answer is short and sweet no need to go on a google page and take answers
0OvZQFwjaa	Based upon the activity series of metals that I have linked below, this reaction will not take place because Magnesium is a more active metal than Nickel.    So, the question I'm left with is, "How do you figure this out from the electronegativities?"    My only guess is based the type of compound formed if the reaction takes place.    In MgCl2, the difference in negativities is 1.85, a very polar covalent bond.    If the reaction occurs, NiCl2 will form where the difference is 1.25, which is still a polar covalent bond, but the dipole is not nearly as strong.    I believe the assumption you are supposed to make is that the strong the intermolecular force, a.k.a. the more ionic in nature, the stronger the attraction between the ions, and thus the higher likihood that the compound will remain in tact.|`|Tng8WuL9aa	Dear,              Actually we don't care electronegativities in such a question. In this question reaction can't occur because of activity series. Here it is:    Li > K > Ba > Ca > Na > Mg > Al > Zn > Cr > Fe > Cd > Co > Ni > Sn > Pb > H2  >Cu  > Ag  > Hg  > Pt  >  Au    To use this series for example:    There is reaction call:    Zn + CuCl2 ---> ZnCl2 + Cu    this can occur because Zn is first in activity series then Cu. So, Zn can displace Cu in this reaction. For any metal use this series.    I hope this will help....!    http://themonster.in|`|TSmbFzDmaa	no

If you are struggling to understand the material and get right answers, then you are best off studying with a tutor who can improve your basic understanding. To be ready for a math test, you want to be able to do problems that are slightly harder than those that will be on the test. This way, the test problems will seem easier and you will be more confident and less panicked. <br>  <br>  Studying for math consists mostly of doing practice problems. Try doing chapter review problems and chapter test problems from the end of the chapters covered. Make sure you only do the problems that correspond to sections that you are required to know, otherwise you might end up confusing yourself. Generally, in math books, the problems go from easiest to hardest. Try to be able to do the hardest problems. <br>  <br>  If there is anything that has to be memorized, such as formulas or pictures, make some flashcards. One of the very best ways of studying anything is to teach it. As a tutor I have learned more by teaching that I ever did by being in a class. Try teaching some of the problems and concepts to a friend that is having trouble or that is in a lower level math class. Or, recruit a family member.

DWBV84NTaa	Sure, I'll help you out.<br>  <br>  When a female cardinal lays her eggs, she'll usually has 3. It will take about 11-13 days before they hatch.<br>  <br>  When they do hatch, the chicks are totally helpless and rely on the parents for food. It takes them roughly 7-13 days to fledge. This means it takes them almost 2 weeks to grow their feathers, become independent and being to learn things on their own. Within 20 days, they can usually begin to fly. But they do still sometimes beg for food from the parent birds, as most recently feldged birds do.<br>  <br>  Once fledged, the birds are then usually referred to as juveniles. They'll look similar to adult females, but the'll have a darker bill. For most song birds, it takes about a year for a juvenile to become an adult. I'm pretty sure that it goes the same for Cardinals. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps. I'll leave you with more links on Cardinals to help as well. Good luck!
d014f113fb3eecfed19b0fbba5d885d9aa	The old adage is that a picture is worth a thousand words!  This has been true for thousands of years.  Before man had a written language, we used pictures.  If you need to communicate something quickly to someone, it is always better to use a picture. That is why we have international driving (as in using a car) signs.  It does not mater what language a person speaks or does not speak – we can communicate with pictures.<br>  <br>  Graphs are a special type of a picture that indicates how groups/number can be displayed in a simple, quick manner.  A run chart, pie charts, histogram, Pareto chart or any number of other graphics can show any amount of data in a very quick illustration.<br>  <br>  So, if an author can use pictures/graphics in the presentation, paper, book, etc. a lot of time and effort can be saved trying to explain the situation at hand.  A simple example could be trying to explain the number of people at different ages who can drive a vehicle safely.  You can explain all of the numbers around what causes unsafe driving, who has what accidents, what constitutes good driving, etc.  Or you can simply show a double circle with the outside one being the total number of drivers (in a given state or country) and the inner circle (divided as a pie chart on some aid groupings) showing all safe drivers.  The graphic will make a much stronger case of what you are trying to describe than it would take to try to explain it.

In my orionino, there cons for dna is: when the murderer has clean record, never been to jail, the police will have a hard time finding him. As for twins, their dna are very identical, but still there is some difference in their dna. Twins' 22 pairs of chromosomes are the same but there is one pair me chromosomes are different. So I am sorry to offend the first answerer. In my opinion, dna is very important for CSI.

Ftkr9jqYaa	There are very few similarities between the bubonic plague and Lowe Syndrome, so I will only list the differences.    Oculocerebrorenal syndrome (also called Lowe syndrome, named after Charles Upton Lowe) is an X-linked recessive disorder characterized by hydrophthalmia (i.e., enlargement of the eyeball due to awatery effusion), cataracts, intellectual disabilities, aminoaciduria, reduced renal ammonia production and vitamin D-resistant rickets.  It is associated with the gene OCRL.  Lowe syndrome can cause Fanconi syndrome (i.e., impairment of renal proximal tubular function).    Bubonic plague is not genetic, and is not a renal disease.  It is caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, which infects the lymphatic system, causing swollen lymph nodes, called buboes.  There is sometimes progression to pneumonic plague (i.e., pneumonia) followed by septicemic plague (i.e., blood poisoning).  Other symptoms include spots on the skin that are red at first then turn black, heavy breathing, continuous blood vomiting, aching limbs and terrible pain. The pain is usually caused by decaying of skin while the infected person is still alive. Death is preceded by spasms.

X0e6p9Ilaa	Yes, you can have hydrogen bonding between the hydrogen of a water molecule and the oxygen of the ether.    C  ..O ---- H-O-H  C    The dimethyl ether is bent and therefore polar.  Oxygen has a slight negative charge and the hydrogen in water is slightly positive, allowing for the attraction between O of ether and H of water.  The attraction is stronger than would by typical of dipole-dipole attraction.|`|gLpi67d8aa	they can form a dipole, but no hydrogen bond. Water hydrogen bonds with itself because it has H-O bonds, but dimethyl ether has no H-O bonds, although it is polar. So, there will be dipole forces.

But here is my previous answer, but I'll modify it for 14 volts and worse case Vf (3.0v)    You need two separate resistors. Each should be about (143.0)/0.25 = 44 ohms, 3 watts (preferably 5 watts).     And you need to be very careful about power dissipation. At 250mA they will be dissipating typically 0.9 watts, max of 1.0 watts.     These seem to be designed for use on a pulse basis, for cameras. To operate them at 250mA DC, you need to mount them on a special metal core PC board, as noted in the datasheet. It also lists lots of special handling precautions.       edit, you can put the two in series, and in that case the resistor will be, worse case, (142*3)/0.25 = 32 ohms 3 watts.      .|`|eef0fd7a18ed1e8ac453b6086f666edfaa	Use Ohm's Law.|`|zj10tl3Uaa	no

So, f(k) = k^2 - 1 is a number divisible by 8.    The next odd number after k is k + 2.    If this holds true for k+2, then it is true for all odd numbers.    To test if k+2 is also divisible by 8, f(k+2) - f(k) must be a multiple of 8.    f(k+2) = (k+2)^2 - 1 = k^2 + 4k + 4 - 1 = k^2 + 4k + 3    f(k) = k^2 - 1    f(k+2) - f(k) = k^2 + 4k + 3 - (k^2 - 1) = 4k + 4) = 4(k+1)    Since k is an odd number, k + 1 must be an even number    The simplest even number is 2, and any other even number is a multiple of 2    Therefore, k+1 = 2x where x is any positive integer.    4(2x) = 8x.  8x is always divisible by 8 since x must be a positive integer.

39f3758933add65e2634bbff1b3a9a28aa	Nearly all of earths atmosphere including the nitrogen, came from when the earth was fairly new and the outer layers were beginning to cool. Some of the less dense elements such as oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen rose near the surface and where constantly being expelled by volcanoes. This is what formed the early atmosphere, which was mostly superheated water (hydrogen and oxygen) carbon dioxide, and ammonia (nitrogen and hydrogen). Over time these gases began to precipitate and, in earths case, recycle themselves and constantly resupply the atmosphere through plate tectonics. (For example, sea floor spreading in the early oceans hydrated the see floor, the sea floor over time gets subducted and the rock is recycled through volcanism where the gasses are once again put into the atmosphere where they precipitate back down into the oceans and back into the sea floor.) The exact composition of the atmosphere has changed over time, such as when the first forms of life, such as algae, took more and more of the carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and produced more and more oxygen. Most of the hydrogen was then tied up in the oceans freeing up more and more nitrogen.|`|Y6FhzwoAaa	outer space. (:

f1beDbKIaa	So this is a 70 mm refractor with a 900 mm focal length.  Your 20 mm eyepiece gives you 900 / 20 = 45x magnification.  Your 10 mm eyepiece gives you 900 / 10 = 90x magnification.  While you could get a 2x barlow, it would probably be pushing it for your 70 mm.  One rule of thumb is 2x magnification per mm of aperture.  You have 70 mm aperture, suggesting 140x.  But in my experience, 1x per mm is about what to expect.  This isn't a high end APO refractor.    Barlows are fairly cheap.  While Celestron isn't saying so, it looks as if you might have 1.25" eyepieces.  In that case, a barlow like this one might to it for you.    http://www.telescope.com/control/product...    Or, you could get a 6.3 mm eyepiece (giving you 143x), like this one:    http://www.telescope.com/control/product...    I'd be curious to learn if you think your mount is stable.  Does it bounce around alot, or does it settle quickly after you touch it?  I mean, it's not a tracking scope, so you have to keep moving it.  So it's not like you can leave it be.  You have to keep touching it.  I have no direct experience with this model.|`|D5QgyGbXaa	By "refractor" you mean eyepiece lens.  You could get a Barlow lens, which would give you 2x to 3x more magnification with same lenses.  But at some point you will be asking for more than what the 70AZ scope can deliver.  I think you would be close to it with a Barlow lens, if not beyond.  The 70 should give you no more than about 150x.  Since your scope is 900mm FL, and the 10mm eypiece gives you (900/10) or 90x now, you would get 180x with a barlow lens added.  But the image will move out of view very fast, will be dimmer, and the air currents will make it fuzzy.|`|aNlT1NRqaa	I hope you mean cm (or better yet, inches) not mm, as that means your looking @ planets with something you won @ the carnival.

A bigger scope is always better, but the eyepiece is as important.|`|UptQ1JFZaa	I'm going to assume you mean you own a 20mm and 10mm eyepieces.    Tow get more magnification you can either use an eyepiece that has a shorter focal length, such as a 5mm, or you can use a barlow lens which will double the magnification of the eyepiece you are using.    There is a third option but it is kinda pricey, buy a telescope that has a longer focal length.

The first is what a melting curve for DNA looks like, the second is what about the samples.  1) See examples of DNA melting curves in the source below.  The first one is the fraction of DNA in its normal state.  The second one is based on the specific heat of the sample which will increase upon melting.  2) As to the samples.

Thus, recapitulate one of the graphs in the link below with sample B melting at a higher temperature than sample A.

Then you would go back the other way almost (but not quite) as far, and this would repeat over and over again for smaller and smaller distances until you settled in the center.    If you wanted to shoot out the other side, there would have to be something to propel you to do so.

If all other things remain constant, then as gas is evolved, the volume will increase (the amount of a gas produced is usually measured by a manometer, and the level of the liquid would go up as the gas was produced).      2.  If the process is occurring in a plant, yeast, or ectothermic (cold-blooded) animal, then one would expect the rate of gas production to be higher in the warmer room temperature than in the cold water bath.  That is because the rate at which enzymatic processes occur increases with temperature (at least until it gets too hot, and the enzymes are denatured.)
PhUmUJIDaa	The photosynthetic prokaryotes often contain chlorphyll (just not in an organelle) and this helps them use light to make food.    As for the non-photosynthetic prokaryotes, firstly you have to remember that they are much smaller then eukaryotes and so do not require as much energy. They can oxidize high-energy compounds. Also, if you remember, you can make small amounts of ATP outside of/without the help of the mitochondria.     Then there are a lot of prokaryotes that are parasitic or decomposers and get their nutrients directly from these sources and have the pathways that can break them down into usable forms through the use of enzymes.|`|YYLybWHSaa	The Cyanobacteria are the prokaryotes that photosynthesize.

Most things in the universe are electrically neutral. This means that they have a charge of zero. When two objects are electrically neutral they won't exert a force on each other electrically.

One mile = 5,280 feet. So, if you converted "2.5 miles per hour" into feet, it would be:    2.5 * 5280 = 13,200 feet per hour.    So, we need to know how long it would take to walk 1454 feet at a rate of 13,200 feet per hour. Divide by 1454 by 13,200.  (1454 feet) * (1 hour / 13,200 feet)  0.110 hours    So, it would take approximately 0.110 hours to walk 1,454 feet (this is about 6.609 minutes).|`|08731488dad4b935e54041834ea3fc48aa	at least 5 to 10 minutes

Hw5xFK0qaa	For question (1), there are two reasonable approaches.  Under both approaches, it is better to solve the general problem (b) first - this is because finding a specific case in (a) is straight-forward from (b), but the reverse is very difficult.  To find the general case, we must find expressions for the coefficients which make use of as few parameters as possible.    The first of these approaches is similar to that shown above, which is to let f(x) = Ax3 + Bx2 + Cx + D.  The three given points lead to the following conditions:    f(-2) = 0: ? A(-2)3 + B(-2)2 + C(-2) + D = 0 ===> 4B + D = 8A + 2C .......... (1)    f(0) = 4: ? A(0)3 + B(0)2 + C(0) + D = 4 ?===>? D = 4 .......... (2)    f(3) = 0: ? A(3)3 + B(3)2 + C(3) + D = 0 ?===> ?27A + 9B + 3C + D = 0 .......... (3)    Applying (2) into (1) produces: ? 4B + 4 = 8A + 2C ?===>? C = 2B + 2 - 4A .......... (4)    Using (2) and (4) in (3):  ????????27A + 9B + 3(2B + 2 - 4A) + 4 = 0  ???????? 27A + 9B + 6B + 6 - 12A + 4 = 0  ???????? 15A + 15B + 10 = 0  ???????? B = -(2 + 3A) / 3    Using this in (4):  ????????C = -2(2 + 3A) / 3 + 2 - 4A  ???????? C = (-4 - 6A + 6 - 12A) / 3  ???????? C = (2 - 18A) / 3    The fact that f(x)  - as x  + means A     So, we now have the general formula for the cubic:    f(x) = Ax3 - (2 + 3A)x2 / 3 + (2 - 18A)x / 3 + 4, A     and the A     f(x) = Ax3 + Bx2 + Cx + D    the restrictions are:    A   B = -(2 + 3A) / 3  C = (2 - 18A) / 3  D = 4    For the specific case required for part (a), any value of A     A = -1: ? f(x) = -x3 + (x2 / 3) + (20x / 3) + 4  or  A = -2 / 3: ? f(x) = (-2x3 / 3); + (14x / 3) + 4  or  A = -22 /  ...which I'm not going to work out! :)    --------------------------------------...    I said that there are two approaches available.  The second is much more efficient as a way to solving the problem, but requires a little more insight.  It begins with recognising that (-2, 0) and (3, 0) are roots of the polynomial, and that being a cubic means there must be a third root (though this could be a doubble root at (-2, 0)).  Thus, we can start with f(x) in factorised form:    Let f(x) = A(x + 2)(x - 3)(x - )    The fact that f(x)  - as x  + ensures that A     f(0) = 4: ? A(0 + 2)(0 - 3)(0 - ) = 4  ???????? 6A = 4  ????????  = 2 / 3A  Note... this shows      So, our general form is f(x) = A(x + 2)(x - 3)(x - 2 / 3A) = (x + 2)(x - 3)(3Ax - 2) / 3  and again the only condition is that A     Specific cases: A = -2 / 3 leads to f(x) = -2(x + 2)(x - 3)(x + 1) / 3  A = -1 / 3 leads to f(x) = -(x + 2)2(x - 3) / 3, the case where (-2, 0) is a double root.    --------------------------------------...    Question (2):  The two statements are TRUE... they are also identical.  In (b), subtracting a strictly decreasing function is the same as adding the opposite of a strictly decreasing function, as f - g  f + -g.  The opposite of a strictly decreasing function is a strictly increasong function.    The truth of (a) is intuitively obvious - increasing + increasing = increasing, but actually proving it is less obvious.  Graphically, taking increasing functions like f(x) = x and g(x) = 2x will show (f+g)(x) increases, but that is not a general proof.  The easiest proof is to use calculus:    Let h(x) = (f+g)(x) = f(x) + g(x) where f(x) and g(x) are both strictly increasing.  In calculus terms, a function f(x) is strictly increasing provided its derivative is positive for all x-values for which the derivative is defined.  Thus, we have that f'(x) and g'(x) > 0, and need only prove that h'(x) > 0:    h(x) = f(x) + g(x)  h'(x) = f'(x) + g'(x) > 0 as f'(x) > 0 and g'(x), and so h(x) must be strictly increasing.|`|Dcf7FqQwaa	1- a) f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d     now substitute the points one by one.           0 = - 8a + 4b - 2c + d            4 =  0 + 0 + 0 + d    then d= 4            0 = 27a + 9b + 3c + 4   Since it decreases toward negative infinity in the right side then:  a    0 = -8a -2c + 4 =>  -8a - 2c = -4   or   8a + 2c = 4    0 = 27a + 3c + 4 =>                          27 a + 3c = -4   a=-2/3 , and c= 14/3   then the equation is:  f(x) = - 2/3x^3 + 14/3x + 4   b) I think this part is explained above on the assumption we made.   2) a) TRUE. Because if you think about two functions that have positive derivatives such as the two lines f(x)= x and g(x) = 5x then   (f+g)(x) = x+ 5x = 6x which is also increasing.  b) TRUE.   f(x) = ax , g(x) = -bx =>(f - g)(x) = ax-(-bx)= (a+b)x which is increasing.  where a and b are positive integers.

YYLybWHSaa	Selection pressures act on every organism that has reproductive variation. As long as there are differences between members of a population there will be some who fit their habitat better than others.  Every generation produces more individuals than the habitat can support, including humans. Not all children live to reproduce nor do all adults that reproduce have children that survive. The ones with the best fit have, on average, the best chance but it is all chance and sometimes the best die anyway. Humans only seem more prone to intraspecific conflict (homicide & warfare are extreme examples) more than other species. All social species evolved behaviors to deal with conflict for resources with members of its own species..    Birds show behavior in forming group identification by group shouting matches. Groups that spend time in  shouting matches with other groups bond and share more quality preening time.   Apes also have these inter-tribal confrontational matches then go off and groom tribal members. Group identity is built up and reinforced by out group confrontations. Look at the ongoing group conflicts between Serbian/Croatian, democrat/republican, or between creation/theory of evolution advocates. They are our version of the bird's group confrontation meetings. We often reinforce our group position with these more than we seek conflict moderation.  http://blog.lib.umn.edu/denis036/thiswee...  The benefit to a species to have group identification and encourage inter-group contacts, is that despite the ensuing conflict costs, there is a greater social complexity. This selects for greater problem solving skills in dealing with conspecifics. How better to select for increasing intelligence and skill with social interactions that by intraspecific competition and cooperation?  http://blog.lib.umn.edu/denis036/thiswee...    Another way to look at selection on humans is with the risk of developing type I diabetes or other environmentally triggered genotypes. Many people carry the genetic predispositions for this diseases but not all get sick. Not all people with the diabetes genotype manifest the disease. Understanding the exact progression of triggering an autoimmune disease can alter the risk of carrying the genes. Selection is the pressure from the specific habitat on the various combinations of genes each individual inherits. If the habitat you occupy can keep you alive to reproduce that is the selection/chance you experience. It turns out that people living in regions with more sunlight make more vitamin D so have far lower incidences of type I diabetes as adults.|`|AA11513203	(No ... not social darwinism.)    The phrase 'survival of the fittest' is a reference to the theory of natural selection ... Charles Darwin's concept of *why* evolution occurs in nature.       (Aside: Most scientists don't like the 'survival of the fittest' phrase, because it does not quite capture what natural selection is about ... it's not just about survival ... it's about *reproduction*.)    The theory says that the reason species evolve (change over time) is because those individuals that are most "fit" for the current environment, will tend *on average* to leave more offspring.   So those traits that help "fitness" increase over time.   The species is *evolving* (which just means *changing*).    This applies to *all* species ... including our species Homo sapiens.

ZiDqFehcaa	The idea is to eliminate one of the variables.  This can be done by adding or subtracting the two equations after making one of the variables common between them.  Consider the given equations:  2x - 3y = 7  3x + y = 5  The second equation has y and the first has -3y, so, multiply both sides of the second equation by 3:  9x + 3y = 15  now, add this to the first equation:  9x + 3y + 2x - 3y = 15 + 7  The 3y and -3y will cancel out,  9x + 2x = 22  11x = 22  x = 2    To get y, substitute x's value in either equation:  2(2) - 3y = 7  4 - 3y = 7  -3y = 3  y = -1|`|TuJqS5A3aa	In order to use the elimination method, the coefficients of one set of variables must be the same. This can be accomplished by multiplying both sides of one equation by a certain amount.    In this case, I'm going to turn 3x + y =  5 into 9x + 3y = 15 by multiplying all of the numbers by 3. Now, the 3y matches the -3y from the other equation, so we can add the two together.       2x - 3y = 7  + (9x + 3y) = 15  -------------------------  11x=22    Now we have just one equation with one variable, so it can be solved: x=2    From here, it's simple to put that variable back into one of the equations to solve for y.    2(2)-3y=7  4-3y=7  -3y=3  y=-1    For that system of equations, the solution is (2,-1), and we have found it by the elimination method.    I hope this clarifies it for you!|`|31f743411a42c3a8de21b1c9c1b15871aa	Hi,    Choose the letter you want to eliminate. I will eliminate "y".    To do that, multiply the second equation all by 3.

D5ShDa5naa	You need to find the ball's height (y) when x is 26m from the kick point.    Since the distance is the only thing that matters, we can define the kick point to be anywhere on the x-axis as long as the crossbar is 26m away from whatever point we choose. To make it easier, let's call the kick point x = 0.    Now you need a kinematic equation to describe the ball's height, which means looking only at the y-component of its motion:    y = .5at^2 + vit + xi    a = g (the acceleration due to gravity, since gravity is the only force acting horizontally)  t = time elapsed since the ball was kicked  vi = initial velocity (in y)  xi = initial height (0)    You can find vi with 18.1*sin(52), but you still need to find t, which is how long it takes from the ball to reach the crossbar. Since there is no horizontal acceleration (if you ignore air resistance and such), you can use x = xi + vit.    x = 26  xi = initial position (0)  vi = initial horizontal speed = 18.1 * cos(52)    Solve for t, plug it back into the height equation, and compare your answer with the height of the crossbar.

Let's take a look at the repeating part.    We want to move the decimal point to the right, so that the first "block" of repeated digits appears before the decimal point.    If you multiply by 10, it moves the decimal point 1 place to the right.    We need to move the decimal place 2 place, so we need to multiply both sides by 100.    100 * x = 10 * 0.08888888888..........  100x = 8.888888888..........

Many atheists demand a scientific proof for the existence of God. I do agree that today is the age of science and technology. Let us use the scientific knowledge that we have to prove the existence of God and simultaneously also prove that Qur’an is a revelation of God.<br>  If a new object or a machine, which no one in the world has ever seen or heard of before is shown to an atheist or any other person and then asked a question, who is the first person who will be able to tell the mechanism of this unknown object? After little bit of thinking, he will reply ‘the Creator of that object’. Some may say ‘the Producer’ while other may say ‘the manufacturer’. Whatever answer the person gives, keep it in your mind, the answer will always be either ‘the Creator’, ‘the Producer’, ‘the manufacturer’ or somewhat of the same meaning i.e. the person who has made it or created it. Do not grapple with words, for whatever answer he gives the meaning will be the same; therefore accept it.<br>  <br>  QUR’AN IS A BOOK OF SIGNS AND NOT SCIENCE:<br>  Let me remind you that Qur’an is not a book of Science, ‘S.C.I.E.N.C.E.’ but a book of ‘signs’ – S.I.G.N.S. i.e. a book of ayaats. The Qur’an contains more than 6000 ayaats that is ‘signs’ out of which more than a thousand speak about science. For Muslims, the Qur’an is the ‘Furqaan’ i.e. the criteria to judge right from wrong and it is the ultimate yard stick which is more superior to scientific knowledge.But for an educated man who is an atheist, scientific knowledge is the ultimate test, which he believes in. Using the ultimate yardstick of the atheist, I try to prove to him that the Qur’an is the word of God and while it was revealed 1400 ago, it contains the scientific knowledge that was discovered recently. Therefore at the end of the discussion, we both come to the same conclusion that God, though superior to science, does not conflict with it.<br>  <br>  CREATOR IS THE AUTHOR OF THE QURAN:<br>  The only logical answer to the question, who could have mentioned all these scientific facts 1400 years ago before they were discovered, is exactly the same answer as was initially given by the atheist or any person, to the question who is the first person who will be able to tell the mechanism of the unknown object. It is the ‘CREATOR,’ the Producer, the Manufacturer.

It says:<br>  <br>  "That ye may go about therein, in spacious roads."<br>  [Al-Qur’an 71:20]<br>  <br>  A similar message is repeated in Surah TaHa:<br>  <br>  "He Who has made for you the earth like a carpet spread out; has enabled you to go about therein by roads (and channels)...."<br>  [Al-Qur’an 20:53]<br>  <br>  The surface of the earth i.e. earth’s crust is less than 30 miles in thickness and is very thin as compared to the radius of the earth which is about 3750 miles. The deeper layers of the earth are very hot, fluid and hostile to any form of life. The earth’s crust is a solidified shell on which we can live. The Qur’an rightly refers to it like a carpet spread out, so that we can travel along its roads and paths. <br>  <br>  2.    Carpet can also be spread on other than an absolute flat surface<br>  Not a single verse of the Qur’an says that the earth is flat. The Qur’an only compares the earth’s crust with a carpet. Some people seem to think that carpet can only be put on an absolute flat surface. It is possible to spread a carpet on a large sphere such as the earth. It can easily be demonstrated by taking a huge model of the earth’s globe covering it with a carpet.<br>  Carpet is generally put on a surface, which is not very comfortable to walk on. The Qur’an describes the earth crust as a carpet, without which human beings would not be able to survive because of the hot, fluid and hostile environment beneath it. The Qur’an is thus not only logical, it is mentioning a scientific fact that was discovered by geologists centuries later.<br>  <br>  3.    Earth has been spread out <br>  Similarly, the Qur’an says in several verses that the earth has been spread out.<br>  <br>  "And We have spread out the (spacious) earth: how excellently We do spread out!"<br>  [Al-Qur’an 51:48]<br>  <br>  Similarly the Qur’an also mentions in several other verses that the earth is an expanse:<br>  <br>  "Have We not made the earth as a wide expanse"<br>  "And the mountains as pegs?"<br>  [Al-Qur’an 78:6-7]<br>  <br>  None of these verses of the Qur’an contain even the slightest implication that the earth is flat. It only indicates that the earth is spacious and the reason for this spaciousness of the earth is mentioned. The Glorious Qur’an says:<br>  <br>  "O My servants who believe! truly. spacious is My Earth: therefore serve ye Me –(And Me alone)!"<br>  [Al-Qur’an 29:56]<br>  <br>  Therefore none can give the excuse, that he could not do good and was forced to do evil because of the surroundings and circumstances.<br>  <br>  4.     Earth is geospherical in shape<br>  The Qur’an mentions the actual shape of the earth in the following verse:<br>  <br>  "And we have made the earth egg shaped".<br>  [Al-Qur’an 79:30]<br>  <br>  The Arabic word Dahaha means egg shaped. It also means an expanse. Dahaha is derived from Duhiya which specifically refers to the egg of an ostrich which is geospherical in shape, exactly like the shape of the earth.<br>  <br>  Thus the Qur’an and modern established science are in perfect harmony.<br>  <br>  embryology:<br>  Many people believe that the Qur’an claims that Allah alone knows the sex of the child in the mother’s womb. The Glorious Qur’an says:<br>  <br>  "Verily the knowledge of the Hour is with Allah (alone). It is He who sends down Rain, and He who knows what is in the wombs…."<br>  [Al-Qur’an 31:34]<br>  <br>  A similar message is given in the following verse:<br>  <br>  "Allah doth know what every female (womb) doth bear, <br>  By how much the wombs fall short (of their time or number) or do exceed. Every single thing is before His sight, in (due) proportion."<br>  [Al-Qur’an 13:8]<br>  <br>  2.    Sex can be determined by Ultrasonography<br>  Today science has advanced and we can easily determine the sex of the child in the womb of a pregnant mother, using ultrasonography. <br>  <br>  3.    The word ‘sex’ is not mentioned in the verse of the Qur’an<br>  It is true that many translations and commentaries of this verse of the Glorious Qur’an say that only Allah knows the sex of the child in the mother’s womb. If you read the Arabic text of this verse, there is no Arabic word corresponding to the English word ‘sex’. In fact the Qur’an says the knowledge of what is in the womb is with Allah alone. Many commentators have misunderstood it to mean only Allah knows the sex of the child in the womb, which is a mistake.<br>  <br>  4.     No one besides Allah can determine the nature of the child<br>  This verse does not refer to the sex of the child in the womb but it refers to, how the child in the mother’s womb will be. How will his nature be? Will he be a blessing or a curse to his parents? Will he be a boon or a bane to the society? Will he be good or evil? Will he go to heaven or hell? The complete knowledge of all things is with Allah alone. No scientist in the world, no matter how advanced his equipment, will ever be able to accurately determine the knowledge of these things about the child in the mother’s womb.<br>  <br>  and lots more............|`|N58YMuuxaa	yes... it mention the miracle of fertilization, when the sperm meets the egg.

NbdTgyLPaa	3) Let's start by listing the four possible combinations and the associated probabilities:<br>  <br>  no drug in the locker, no barking: 0.96 * 0.85 = 0.816<br>  no drug in the locker, barking: 0.96 * 0.15 = 0.144<br>  drugs in the locker, no barking: 0.04 * 0.05 = 0.002<br>  drugs in the locker, barking: 0.04 * 0.95 = 0.038<br>  <br>  (Note a good check to see our math is correct is that when we add up all the probabilities we should always get 1.)<br>  <br>  For 3a, the answer is the sum of the two probabilities above where the dog barks, i.e. 0.144 + 0.038 = 0.182 or 18.2% chance of barking at any random locker.<br>  <br>  For 3b, we need to look at how much of the chance the dog is barking is due to there actually being drugs.  This is 0.038/0.182 or approximately 20.9% chance there is drugs in the locker when the dog barks.<br>  <br>  4) The wording here is just a little bit less precise than I would prefer.  For the sentence "Additionally suppose that 15% of items are sold for more than their appraised value" I would normally take that to mean the overall percentage of all items sold above appraised value is what it is referring to.  But since it followed a statement about items being sold at regular sales, it *might* have been meant to only apply to regular sales.  This doesn't make a big difference in answering the questions, except for 4d.<br>  <br>  For 4a) no, A and B are not independent.  If they were, then one would expect there to be the same percentage of items sold above appraised value as in regular sales.  Since this is obviously not the case, they aren't independent.  The exact figures for the probabilities involved would depend on the meaning of the one sentence I am uncertain about (see 4d below for info about it that should help you do this).<br>  <br>  BTW, note that this does not actually prove a casual relationship, as we don't know if the items sold at the special auctions were randomly selected, or if there was special criteria for their selection, i.e. that they might have been selected because it was expected they would sell better there than at a regular sale.  But I think we are meant to assume they are randomly selected.<br>  <br>  For 4b) chance of being in a special sale is 1 - 0.80 = 0.20 and the chance of it being sold for more than appraised value is 0.60, so the probability of any one item being sold at a special sale and for more than the appraised value is 0.20 * 0.60 = 0.12 = 12%<br>  <br>  For 4c) no, they are not mutually exclusive.  If the were, the probability of them occurring together would be 0.  However we showed in 4b that it was 12%.<br>  <br>  For 4d) I will first show the "easy" solution of assuming the wording was poor in the example.  That is the chance of selling at a regular sale is 0.80 and the chance of selling above appraisal is 0.15, so the chance of this is 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12 or 12%.<br>  <br>  However, as the problem actually reads, the overall percentage of items sold at above appraised value is 0.15.  So we need to calculate the percentage of items sold at regular sale that are sold above the appraised value.  Let this percentage be x.  Then<br>  .8 * x + .2 * .6 = .15<br>  That is the percentage of items sold above appraised value in both regular and special sales must be 15% of the overall sales.  So<br>  .8x + .12 = .15<br>  .8x = .03<br>  x = .0375 (or 3.75%)<br>  <br>  So the probability that the selected item is not sold at a specialty sale but is sold for more than its appraised value would then be 0.80 * 0.0375 = 0.03 or 3%.
D5ShDa5naa	I'm not sure what they mean by a "turning point," but it's either a point of inflection (where concavity changes) or a maximum or minimum (where slope changes).    If it's a point of inflection, you need to find every point where f'' = 0, since a change in concavity is a change in the sign of the second derivative. For every x in your solution set, test a point to the left and right to make sure f'' actually changes signs (instead of being zero everywhere or something). If you have more than one solution x, make sure any test points you choose are between it and any other x.    For example, if f'' = 0 at x = 1 and x = 5, and you're testing x = 0, then -1 and 1 are good test points but -1 and 6 are not.    If it's a min/max, you need to find every point where f' = 0, since the slope must pass through zero any time it changes signs. As above, pick test points to make sure the slope actually changes signs.|`|VTSvmqbIaa	It is not tricky!    Turning point will be the point where the derivative dy/dx will be zero.    So differentiate the term on RHS wrt x. Use chain rule/product rule if you can.    dy/dx = 0 will give you an equation in x. Solve that. Those points are turning points in the curve's geometry.

TuJqS5A3aa	I would personally first go to substitution or elimination, just because graphing requires more time (and graph paper!) for me.    n=nickles  d=dimes    Substitution:    Set up the two equations.  n=d-10  10d+5n=310    Substitute the first equation into the second, and solve.  10d+5(d-10)=310  10d+5d-50=310  15d=360  d=24    Now, plug that back into the first equation...  n=24-10  n=14    There are 24 dimes and 14 nickles.      Elimination:    The equations we'll use this time are similar, but different.  -d+n=-10  10d+5n=310    Now, multiply the top equation by 10.  -10d+10n=-100  10d+5n=310    Add the equations together to eliminate one of the variables (d).  15n=210  n=14    It's simple to go back and solve for d now.    So, again, the answer is 24 dimes and 14 nickles.|`|ALeMtU19aa	Okay. I'm gonna call dimes "d" and nickels "n". We know that a nickel is worth 5 cents or $0.05 and a dime is 10 cents or $0.10. From that we can come up with this equation:    (0.10)d + (0.05)n = 3.10    We also know that we have 10 fewer nickels than dimes so we can come up with:    n = d - 10    From their we can use substitution to combine the equations to get:    (0.10)d + (0.05)(d - 10) = 3.10    After you distribute the .05 you should have:    (0.10)d + (0.05)d - 0.50 = 3.10    From here you can combine your two d terms and move the .50 to the other side of the equation.    (0.15)d = 3.60    Then divide to get the number of dimes.    d = 24    Then substitute that into the second equation to get the number of nickels    n = (24) - 10    n = 14    If you wanted to do this by graphing then I would change d and n into x and y in the first two equations so they look like this:    (0.10)x + (0.05)y = 3.10    y = x - 10    After you change the fist one into standard form it will look like this:    y = -2x + 62    y = x - 10    Then you graph them and find the point where the intersect which should be (24, 14). I didn't check that one though.    If you wanted to do it by elimination then I would change the equations back in to d and n like this:    n = -2d + 62    n = d - 10    I would then multiply the bottom equation by 2 on both sides    n = -2d + 62  2n = 2d - 20    Then add them together and you n terms will cancel    3n = 42    Then divide by 3    n = 14    Then substitute that back in like we did before to get d = 24    As for which it better that is up to you.
4wqYb923aa	A positive angle is an angle whose terminal side is rotated counter-clockwise while a negative angle is one whose terminal side is rotated clockwise.  Now, coterminal angles are angles whose terminal sides coincide.  To get another positive coterminal angle, just add 360 (or 2Pi) to the given positive angle.  To get another negative coterminal angle, just add -360 (or  -2Pi) to the given negative angle.

ecyYwLngaa	The very first thing you need to know is this property and you will be able to get it from here:    log(a^b) = b log a    Ok, so we start with 3^(8-x)=27^(2-x)  Take the log of both sides to get log[3^(8-x)]=log[27^(2-x)]  Using the above property we get (8-x)log3=(2-x)log27  Dividing by log3 we get 8-x=(2-x)3                                    8-x=6-3x                                    2=-2x                                   -1=x    Hope that helps!

31f743411a42c3a8de21b1c9c1b15871aa	Hi,    The equation you are looking at is a logistic function. It has two horizontal asymptotes - one is at y = 0 and the other is at the number in the numerator of the fraction. That means the upper asymptote is at y = 950.    The y min should be y = 0 or slightly lower and the y max should be 950 or slightly higher. The graph that would show this is graph E, with a ymin = 0 and a ymax = 1000.    The answer that does this best is answer E.     I hope that helps!! :-)|`|73etrYBqaa	y = 950 / (1+12e^(-.4x))    e^0=1  e^-(anything) is less, but never negative - eventually approaches 0  So the greatest the denominator could be is 13, the least would be 1  950/1=950 (max y value)  950/13=73.07... (min y value)  xmin and xmax are up to the user and what you are trying to look at (roots, maxima, etc).    I would confirm E on the idea that none of the others is useful in viewing the graph, D is way too much for y, C is way to little, B misses the top of the graph (y values), and A is way off.
