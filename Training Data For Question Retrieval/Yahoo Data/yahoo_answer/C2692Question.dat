She has been doing fine the last few days...she is drinking puppy formula out of a bottle and I am stimulating the pee and poop.  However today she stopped eating and has really runny poop as well she has vomited.  I called the vet and they said it could be a number of things and for me to bring her in the morning.  I am wondering if anyone else has any suggestion on what I could do to get her to eat tonight or what it could possible be caused from?

20090222193101AAO3KSD	Pets;Fish	!!!HELP!!!!  MY FISH ARE EATING EACH OTHER!!!?	i had three neons in a fish tank and went to the store and bought a larger fish ( about 2.5 inches) and put them together. I guess that their not compatable because the bigger one ate one of the neons. Now there are two left and I don't know what to do with them. I'm a college student and can't take them anywhere. What should I do? Will the two neons live if I keep them in a gallon jar? What is the best way to keep the other two alive and how long will it be before the larger one gets hungry and strikes again?
20090222192825AAv0kDr	Pets;Cats	Looking for good cat food?	I had my cat on Alley Cat, which none of my previous cats have had a problem with, but she is having some stinky, running and loose stools. Light brown in color and what resembles blood but could be the food color as well. She was tested for any other issues and it was negative.      I've gradually been changing her over to Fancy Feast, and it seems to be a BIT better, but not much at all, and have now learned they're made by Purina, which I didn't know. I'm trying to stay away fro Iams and Purina food due to animal cruelty, but need a good food for my cat's tummy...I've accepted it will probably be expensive. Are there any good dry foods that are healthy for her, her tummy and don't aren't cruel to animals? I know it is hard to find things with little by-products and scaring "animal" products...      Please don't suggest wet food, she absolutely won't eat it. She doesn't like tuna, or any dairy. Which I know isn't good for her, but my point is she hates anything that isn't her dry cat food...so a raw diet won't work.

20090222165958AA4F0Cs	Pets;Reptiles	Telling the sex of a python?	I've had this ball python for about 6-8 months and it's about 10-12 months old. I named it Candice because the pet store employee kept saying "she" so I just thought it was a female. I'm having seconds thoughts that it's a male. I've heard that you can tell if it's a female or male by the spurs. I heard males and smaller spurs than the females and males only have spurs. My boa constrictor doesn't have spurs but my ball python does. So i'm not too sure if Candice is a female or male. I don't want to "pop" the vent because I don't want to hurt her or mess anything up because I've never done it before. So can anyone help me out?

Also, he has to stay there for 3 days so he'll probably think I abandoned him. I love my kitty just like a mother would love a son, to me, he is my son.  The day I pick him up, I want to do something special for him.  Now, where we stay when we're not at college is a friend's house.  My friend has 3 cats of his own that my cat  is best friends with.  I was thinking about making a cat safe "cake" for them to share and to cheer Kenshi (my cat) up.  I know he isn't going to care whether its a cake or not, only if it tastes good, but its the principle.  I also am NOT including sugar or chocolate into this cake.  So please if anyone knows a good recipe please tell me.  I plan on using it for Kenshi's birthday and his friends' birthdays in the future.

I have worked with animals my entire life, from vets offices to grooming salons and Im thinking about eventually opening a Dog Bathing Business in my home. not a grooming business no body hair will be cut. From my past jobs, I know there is a market for this, but im wanting to know if YOU would take your dog to a in home salon. I have noticed over the years, that most places are Quantity driven and not Quality. Tons of kennels, noise, and stress. Its not personal anymore and i want to change this in my area. Sparing no expense. Im thinking about converting my basement into a fully functional bathing room. with the best equipment from the hydrosurge bathing system, to a stainless steal professional tub with ramp, about 10 kennels, velocity dryers, kennel driers, the works. Offering all services that most well know salons offer in their bathing packages, for at least 10% less than the competition. so what i want to know is if you the customer would take advantage of this service if there was one around you. I want this to be a professional quality driven business, im not in it for the money at all. so wold you use this? what would you want to change about the places you have locally? any complaints? any things you love about the local salons? I would love any and all opinions on this.

Like a month ago, his beek was growing abnormally, and his wings were changing colors, so I brought him to the vet. They filed his beek and gave him a shot to get him back his vitamins. She said he doesn't have liver problems, but is very underweight. She said he's had a poor nutrition. She said not to stop giving him the food he's been eating, which was mostly commercial branded seed, so he doesn't starve himself, if he doesn't like the new foods. This bird store gave me a sample of food with different vegetables and fruits. He's eaten some of it. Now I'm trying more stuff though. I've tried apples. He nibbled on it like once, but doesn't like it. Same thing with bananas. He liked walnuts more, but has stopped eating that. The vet said not to give him too much bread, but a little is okay. I forgot to ask her about crackers, but I will. Are crackers okay? Like regular crackers you might buy for soup? He loves that. She said I should stuff him up and get him back to a more healthy weight. How would suggest I go about this? What foods should I try with him?

The guy usually has his dog on a leash...but sometimes he dosent. His dog has attacked my dog twice. My dog is off the leash too but she is next to me. His dog runs up and attacks my dog. His owner yells and yells his name. He is extremely aggressive...he just plows into my dog and after she is whining and dragging her body a little lower than usual...but she is fine.  The guy smiles and asks if my dog is okay. I say yes because I just want him to leave with his dog before he attacks Scout again. What should I do? The guy seems like a really nice guy I dont want to get him in trouble and I dont want to say anything to him because I dont know how he would react.      Also....every dog hates my dog and I dont know why. People always ask if she is friendly and I say yes so they let their dog off the leash and their dog attacks mine. The owner is always like, "thats strange hes never done that before." When dogs approach my dog she puts her ears back and her tail down and her hair stands up. Could she be telling them something in dog language that makes them attack?

20090222182245AAL0ha3	Pets;Rodents	Do you think my chinchilla needs a buddy?	Hi everybody      I have had my black velvet female since January 15th, so about a month and a half. (she about 3 months old) I got her from a great breeder and she is very healthy. Her and I are strongly bonded already, she loves when I scratch her armpits and play with her little hands! I am also her main caretaker, almost like her mommy! Nobody takes care of her except for me. She is my baby girl. But I have a feeling she is getting lonely!   I play with her EVERY night for about 30-60 minutes and spend time with her every day. Ever since like a week ago during playtime, she sits there and looks sad and does nothing. We are going to have an experienced chinchilla exotic veterinarian check her out tomorrow, just in case she is sick or something. I found this website that has chinchilla sounds (she is very vocal!) and there was a sound I have been hearing her make lately that usually means they are lonely. She has a HUGE cage (ferret nation) its like 5 feet tall, 4 feet long, and 3 feet wide with two levels. She also has a lot of toys and a nice wheel she loves to run on. Many places to jump and have fun too!   Do you think I should get her a female cage mate?      I am 13 and got her for my 13th birthday. I am mature for my age. I know everything about my chinchillas, ask me any question if you don't believe me and I will answer it. So please don't tell me I couldn't 'handle the responsibility'.   Also, what is a way I could persuade my parents to let me get another one? I have more than enough money of my own to buy one. Maybe we could wait a few months, like til summer break? And if I get a good grade on the Florida FCAT (which I always get 5s, the highest score) and good grades, that could help a bit too!   I also know how to introduce two chinnies.      Thank you so much for helping me. :)

I have a mare and when we got her she would grab ahold of the rope fence and just pull on it, now that we hae a solid pipe corral fence, she will put her whole mouth around it and pull back as hard as she can. I was told by an old cowboy that she was windsucking but the more that I read about it it doesn't seem right. She just pulls back, she doesn't arch her neck and she seems to almost hold her breath. She doesn't chew on the wood its just the pipe. I have tried cribbing collars and that doesn't work. I have been looking for something to put on it but everything seems to be for wood. Does anyone have any ideas as to how to stop her from doing this?

I can't test my water parameters but I do daily 25% water changes.      1) I was feeding them food that was at least 6 months old-possibly over a year. I didn't know that food went bad and it was given to me. I switched them to new food today. Could it be malnourishment? All of the other fish are healthy and look well fed.   2) The yellow seems to be under the blue stripe. The blue strip is still visible. the yellow wraps around his body.   3)He doesn't seem to be exhibiting any other signs of NTD.   Whats wrong with him? He is swimming normally.

We brought home a 10 week old beagle and we are having a very hard time with house breaking (we did not have this problem with our last beagle).  We take her out at least every hour on the hour and she will not eliminate outside.  We will wait till we can tell she has to go and run her out and nothing...all she does is eat the snow on the ground.  She will start to deficate inside and we will grab her and run her out and all she'll do is try to eat the snow and she won't go.  We've shovled her an area to go, and she doesn't understand what she is suppose to do.  We take her out every time she gets up from a nap, eats, plays or we let her out of her crate and she will not go, then the second we set her down in the house she'll go.  We've tried to take her outside when we can tell she has to go and then put her in her kennel so we can try again in a couple minutes, but she'll go in her kennel then.  I really, really need help, I'm not sure what to do!

Im taking to vets first thing in the morning anyway but im getting worried, its his behavior, he is normally a ball of energy causing havoc somewhere in the house, but hes constantly moping about, goes out the back be`s sick then just sits staring at the floor then he will come in, sit on his bed and just stare at the wall for ages. He is just not himself at all, i don't like these weird things he`s doing. Right now he`s just staring at me with a real sad face on him.      My partner brought him home a cooked lamb bone Thursday evening which he duly ripped in to and demolished, could this be the prob ? If so what damage can it of done ? As i say i am taking to the vets first thing but can anyone help ? even if only to rest my mind.

I started with the box from a guitar hero world tour full set, and i made a small house stuffed with cotton for fun, and i will add other cool things in it, and i turned it upside down and added a small entrance hole. Now i am collecting a bunch of cardboard and other objects.

I want to keep making it until I can't possibly make it bigger, using a bunch of stuff over time, always adding extensions.   Now, for the question, what are some good ideas for doing it, and if you do this, please add images? don't give me anything off dapper rat. That is where i got the idea and i read it thoroughly.

20090222204321AAiRtNy	Pets;Dogs	How do you deal with resource-guarding dogs?	My dad has a dachshund, and I'd venture to say that he's an aggressive dog. My dad does this thing with the dog where he simulates a mouth/claw with his hand, and then he grabs the dog's face in an effort to get him to bark. He growls, shows his teeth, barks, the whole package at my dad, and but my dad thinks it's "play". The dog sure enjoys it though, but I feel as though my dad is actually *teaching* him to be aggressive. Even biting (and almost breaking skin) isn't enough to convince him that this "play" is a problem.      Now it's to the point where now the dog barks at everything: the mailman, visitors, and when I go to pick up a toy he's done playing with, he runs over and snaps at me. If he wasn't so small, I'm sure his reflexes would be at the point where he actually would rip my skin open if he made contact.      I want to do so much to help the dog, but I always get criticized by my dad. I try teaching him how to sit, and my dad accuses me of treating the dog like a slave. I treat him with small pieces of food, and my dad says I'm starving the dog. Worst of all, I wanted to bring him to the vet to see if there are any medical problems with him, and my dad yells at me, saying it's "a waste of money".      Anyway, is there any way I can teach my dog to stop being so defensive with his things? I feel my dad is teaching him that being aggressive is "cute", so he always does it, but is there a way I can help my dog?

20090222202244AAoUwfY	Pets;Dogs	Any advice about excessive barking?	My mother has been taking care of her friend's chihuahua while she is in the hospital. The dog is 8 years old and has never really been socialized at all. My younger brother Andy still lives at home while attending college. Every time the dog sees my brother, she barks and growls like crazy. No one can get her to stop. My mom has tried everything she can think of to get it to stop. Sometimes the dog will even sit outside my brother's room and bark and growl at his door. The really strange part is, the dog will allow my mom to hand her over to my brother, who will then hold and pet her for a while before she wiggles away and starts barking again. He has tried playing with her and giving her treats to show her he's a nice person, but to no avail.      My mom has been watching this dog for about 3 months now, and will likely have her for at least two more. Does anyone have any ideas about how to stop this behavior? It's really driving my mom nuts. Thank you.

They like to go in the corner to pee and it flies outside of the cage. I was thinking about buying diaper and tying them up in the corners so when they pee in the corner all we will have to do is toss the diapers. Does this sound ok or do you think the ferrets can be harmed by this

20090222200922AAzjMsJ	Pets;Rodents	How to get my rat to take her medicine?	My rat won't take her medicine for her respiratory infection.  The vet said she should like it b/c its sugary bet she doesn't.  I have tried mixing it with honey, applesauce, I've even let it soak into a teddy grahm but she still wont eat it.  Any ideas on how I can get this little girl to take her medicine?  She usually doesn't turn down food, so I need something to really mask the taste.        I've also tried just shoving the dropper into her mouth (as the vet said) and I ended up with an extremely scratched up hand and a very pissed off rat :(
20090222201330AAZGxQ4	Pets;Dogs	What should i do about my dog not chewing his food?	I have my pup on a feeding schedule, he gets fed 3 times a day and a snack.   9am.-meal   3pm-meal    6pm-snack   9pm-meal      He is a 12 week old Norwegian Elkhound and is fed on a consistent schedule so i don't see why he would eat the way he does.    He gets a mouthful of food and swallows and moves his neck forward to make the food go down, VERY rarely does he chew.   I've tried hand feeding him a little at a time to see if he will slow down and chew but he just grabs it (gently)and swallows, I also tried letting him eat out of the bowl and when i see a mouthful I raise his head and try to get him to chew, sometimes it works but again he usually just swallows it all.   After a meal he burps loudly. Also he swallowed a piece of rawhide that I couldn't get away from him fast enough.   Any suggestions on what I could do to get him to 1)slow down while eating 2)actually chew his food?

20090222205947AAnnBtm	Pets;Rodents	New pet rat...8 months old adopted?	my boyfriend and i have a 2 month old rat and today we bought a buddy for him who's about 3 months old.  at the petstore there (we bought our rat from a breeder, but every breeder we know doesnt have a litter available and won't for a long time and we're in a hurry), there was an 8 month old russian blue male rat up for adoption because his owner had to go to japan.  he had only been at the store for 2 days.  he's HUGE for  his age, and we decided to get him for our friend who's babysitting my rats and has her own male who's about 8 months old also.  we brought him home to her, and on the hour ride home the russian blue sneezed about 5 times, and he kept sneezing at home while my new one still hasn't sneezed.  the owner almost cried when she bonded with him because she's so in love with him already, and she would be devastated if he was sick.  would a big healthy rat like him start showing signs of a respiratory after two days?  i know about all the signs, but im just worried for my friend.  she's watched me go through a baby rat with a respiratory, so she gets worried every time he sneezes, too.   my own rat has been with me for about a month now, and he had me on edge for about two weeks because of sneezing, but sense he hasn't gotten worse after two weeks, im guessing he just has a sensitive nose or is allergic to detergents.  i've also talked to a vet, his breeder, and three specialists, and they think he's fine.   but anyway, do you think an adult rat would have a respiratory infection and then be put up for adoption?  he eats and plays but he sleeps alot and cuddles.  i know that we'll know in a week.  and we also have antiobiotics in his water. but how can we really tell?

20090222211321AAYzf53	Pets;Reptiles	Do red rat snake always have blotches of darker color or can they be on solid color?	I found a snake that was yellowish orange and I think it is a red rat snake but when I searched online it said that they are reddish orange and have darker blotches all over there backs. This snake was a little more orange than a kumquat on its back and about the same color as a kumquat underneath.
20090222214434AAWkRNK	Pets;Dogs	Do you think it's rude...?	To go off on someone when they don't control their dog?  Ok, here's the situation that happened today.  Went to the store with my dogs, 3 Bostons.  We were looking at jackets for my female.  I had 1 of the boys, hubby had other boy and girl.  My hands were holding a leash and going through the jackets.  He's holding onto leashes and some bones.  All the sudden I see a shepard puppy maybe 6 months old walking into the area we are standing.  As I'm turning around, this puppy in jumping on my male, and then I see a child around 5 or 6 holding the puppy's leash.  All the leashes got tangled together.  My female started backing up and I could see her becoming uncomfortable.  All I could think was "fight".  So I started yelling "no".  This kids parents is strolling behind not doing anything.  Luckily my hubby backed our dogs back far enough so she didn't have time to react and held the leashes tight.  These people just kept walking and laughing.  My males wouldn't have done anything, but my female wasn't expecting it and I think it startled her.  Especially since all the leashes got tangled and she couldn't get back.  This has happened before in other places.  I'm sick of it.  I always have control of my dogs, don't let them approach anyone or anything without my approval, and always make sure they have manners in public.  When do you have enough and start bitching these people out for not controlling their dogs...and kids!  Do others just ignore it or do you say something?      Oh, and when we were leaving, someone commented on how well behaved they were and they could never take all three of their dogs into a store at once.  I have taken all by myself before and never had a problem controlling them...it's always been the other dogs trying to get to them.

20090222212310AA10C56	Pets;Dogs	My Dog Keeps Barking?	I have a miniature dachshund with a very loud voice. Every time he hears a tiny noise, he goes crazy barking, and most of the time, I can't even hear the noise. It drives everyone in our house mad, and we have no clue what to do to make him stop. I am NOT going to hit him or give him a shock collar. When he hears a noise, he barks, but he doesn't run to it, sometimes just sits there and barks at nothing..We have another dog here, who he is best friends with, so I don't think it's loneliness. I am NOT going to do that Voice Box procedure either, that's just horrible to do! When we try to sleep, he starts barking at things I think that he only thinks he hears. Can anyone tell me how I can get him to stop? Or just ease it down a little?      Thank You

20090222214825AAh6pGQ	Pets;Fish	Is there something wrong with my beta fish?	It's my first time having a beta fish and I just got him two days ago. I brought him home looking vibrant and healthy, but it seems as though he is afraid of everything. Not being able to buy a large tank yet, I bought a glass bowl and put some transparent, rounded gem-like things on the bottom so he would have a little color. Yesterday and today, I fed him correctly twice each day. I do not tap on the glass and continue to be very gentle but everytime I come near the glass bowl, he seems to be so afraid. Today, I've realized that he's afraid of ANYTHING put near the glass bowl, even my finger when I try gently.      I read that Betas are supposed to follow and want to chase things, not shy away.      Could someone please give me some more information? I really want him to feel safe and loved. I feel really bad not knowing what to do about this.

20090222214209AArLEQ6	Pets;Dogs	How long do German Shepherds get?	I want to buy my German Shepherd puppy (she's 4 months old) a dog bed, but one that will be big enough for her when she's full grown. She's in a crate for the time being, because she's still being potty trained (she still has a few accidents now and then), but once she's trained, she won't be in a crate (we'll just be putting a bed down where her crate is). Her crate is 30" long, but quickly getting too small for her. I just want to know how long they get, from snout to rump/base of tail. Does anyone know what the average size is?

20090222210808AAjmnTu	Pets;Rodents	I Think my Mouse is Pregnant But I'm not 100% Sure, can you please help me?	Ok, So here's the entire story;      In Mid-September last year my little sister and brother each bought a pet mouse. The pet shop said that they were all females and we believed them. In the christmas holidays my family and i went away for four weeks, unfortunately the person who promised us they would feed the mice etc, never did. Of course we were very angry and when we got home we found my little sisters mouse alive and mine and my brothers dead. The saddest thing is though that because of the lack of food survival instincts took over my little sisters mouse (skittles) and she started eating the mice :(. Now about eight weeks ago was when this took place and over the last three weeks we have noticed skittles has became extremely fat and she eats heaps, hardly moves and wont allow for us to touch her and if she hits her stomach etc she squeals in pain. We things she may be pregnant but we are not entirely sure. A possibility as to how she became pregnant may be that about 3-4 weeks ago we left her outside for two nights (in he cage) and we think she may have mated with a male mouse through the cage bars as dogs are known to mate through fences when the female is in heat (we have seen little native mice in our back yard so..). What do you think?? please help.. :) and i really hope she is pregnant.

20090222213539AAhnEst	Pets;Cats	I need to stop one cat from harrasing the other.?	I promised my grandmother that I would take care of her cat should she pass before the cat did. I am now living in/fixing up her house for sale. I have three cats of my own, who have their own established pride order.  Now they are on her turf and are reassigning roles, which is going as expected for most of the cats.        One of my cats is very people friendly and sweet.  However, she has no clue when it comes to personal space with other cats.  My grandmothers cat has been harrassing the sweet one because she gets to close and is accepting of the lowest rank on the pecking order.  My sweet one is now becoming withdrawn and shy.  She's hiding a lot and no longer comes when she is called.  I'm scared that her personality is going to be forever altered because of the treatment of the other cat.      I am feeding them in different areas of the kitchen, and kept them seperated for a while, made loud startiling noises, boped on the noise. I'm out of ideas.  Over all grandma's cat is acting better than I expected from a cat who had never interacted with other cats, and mine others are fine with how things are ending up.  I'm just hoping that someone can give me some new ideas on how to keep my sweet one sweet and unharmed.....

I am going to be looking at a 8mo old Daschund Rottweiler mix tomorrow and when i googled it,i just got one awful story....according to the owner,he is a very sweet,cuddly,playful dog that is great with kids and other dogs and he looks like a weiner dog except that his fur is rougher than your typical Daschund and he's heavier than your average weiner dog.Now,I have a 2 1/2 yr old and a 7yr old and without any research available online...i tried three search engines...I can only go by what i see tommorrow and by maybe someone having had an encounter with a mix as strange as this or maybe someone who knows enough about dogs to give me a heads up on what to expect.He says that the dog doesn't bark alot and does like to chew shoes and can be a little michevious when left alone but personally i think that he does that because his last two owners worked alot and locked him in a room and thats why he was destructive.I'm a stay at home mom and will be able to give him attention.Any tips?
