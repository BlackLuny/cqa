yO5tm6e1aa	To start a business, you need to invest capital.  There are 3 primary ways to infuse the business with capital.<br>  <br>  1)  Transfer personal assets into the business (i.e. fund your own way)<br>  2)  Obtain loans<br>  3)  Sell equity in the business via stock (this requires incorporating the business).<br>  <br>  If you do #3, there are two approaches.  One is to sell shares privately.  Small corporations do this to get cash from family and friends while giving them an equity position in the business.  This may come in the form of dividends.  Large ventures raise capital by putting themselves in the public market.  The stock market is this public market that allows people to buy a stake in companies.<br>  <br>  If we did not have a stock market, then many "big" ideas could not get funded.<br>  <br>  The corporation gets the money raised on an IPO.  They set the share value and hope that all shares released sell.  Once shares are on the open market, then supply and demand along with perception of how well the corporation will do in the future will dictate price.  The corporation may choose to distribute dividends, but not a large percentage do.  The coporation does not make money on the exchange of shares.  They only raise money if they release more shares (though that will drive down the overall price since they increased supply).|`|ww12lItvaa	For the same reason you need any market, as a place to buy and sell.|`|9r2SBjA1aa	so people will  make money  and not live on the streets|`|PGLZ3LiYaa	Let's say you go to a non-government school and actually get a good education. Then you invent some thing that you see a need for. You want to start a business to build your product, but you don't have the money because the government over taxes you <br>  <br>  You go to your friends, family, banks, and investors. Some of the people you talk to think it is a good idea. They want to help you start your company so you can make your product. So you make an agreement with them to give them a piece of the profits you make in exchange for the money they lend you. <br>  <br>  One guy lends you $20,000 and another lends you $5000. You had $25000 of your own. So you issue stocks at a value of $1.  So you might issue 50,000 stocks. you get 25,000 and the investors get 20,000 and 5000 respectively.<br>  <br>  You start your company. You have expenses of buying materials and equipment, hiring people and paying taxes. At the end of your first year, you make money. you deduct the operating expenses and are left with $10,000. you keep some of the money for expansion or research and development to expand your business. The rest of the money you pay in dividends to the stock holders. <br>  <br>  Other people see the success of your business and offer to buy shares of the stock, and offer more than a dollar a share, so some of your original share holders sell some of their shares. <br>  <br>  A market is a place where people come to buy or sell things. A stock market is where people go to buy and sell stocks. <br>  <br>  Stocks in the market have a bid and ask price. The buyer "bids" on the stock, but does not get them if no one is selling for that price.The seller "asks" for a price, but doesn't sell them if no one is willing to buy for that price. When there is a match of the bid and ask price, the shares are sold. <br>  <br>  As the perceived value of the company drops (as with Bank of America when the government talks about taking over the company) there will be no one bidding on the stocks. So the Ask price will drop as people wanting to get out of the companies stocks will ask lower prices. Until some one sees the price as a bargain and starts buying.|`|AA10007793	To provide capital for companies/  And to provide ownership in those companies for investors.

vs5rK3iRaa	Just after the election I spoke to many of O's supporters who were all gloating and puffing out their chests.  My response to them was, "I hope you like higher taxes, because that's what he promised throughout his campaign."  It never failed to leave them speechless because it is the truth.<br>  I heard a pundit say that there are no taxes on businesses.  You're exactly correct, they simply pass it along to us, the consumer.  All these people who want to punish oil companies by putting a tax on "excessive profits" are foolish.  It would be like raising the price of gasoline and heating oil ourselves.  You can't punish a business for doing what it is in business to do, which is to make money for its stock holders.  You're also correct in your analysis that the companies, realizing that the middle class won't have money to spend, will start (have started!) laying off workers.  Following that line of reasoning, more layoffs will mean even FEWER people being able to afford to purchase their goods.  It is a self-perpetuating cycle. A downward spiral in the economy results. <br>  The Bush plan was to give a little break to everyone, which did stimulate the economy for a short time.  It wasn't until the banks started collapsing that the economy turned south in a big hurry.  I'm not defending Mr. Bush on this, because he and his advisers should have been aware of what was happening in banking and on Wall Street.<br>  The Leftists have been waiting a long time to try their brand of Democratic Socialism.  Now they have their chance and they are not wasting any time in implementing it.  The American people won't realize until it is too late that it doesn't work, because they still think Obama walks on water.  Not since John Kennedy have I seen such blind faith in a president.|`|GOifC7i3aa	yes....but not as much as from non-rich people<br>  <br>  but his idea of rich is not mine<br>  <br>  he said he would target $250 000 ....which is not rich.....comfortable but not rich in this day<br>  <br>  he will get most from those who can't squirrel it away through tax loop holes ....and these will not be the really rich|`|mUMMLjDdaa	obama will raise taxes on the rich, but please remember<br>  bush gave tax cuts which benefited primarily the rich and<br>  look at the horrible shape he left us in.|`|dd3cf2065a180ccacbe77ef40493ab96aa	raising business taxes will have more business OUT instead of IN and many more people with out jobs.|`|Gi9sz9ataa	Many things are corrupt. o_o|`|AA11421582	Well the Bush plan of giving tax breaks to companies didn't work.....what other options do we have left?

lU8e0VQFaa	It depends on what's the most important to you, is price the most important? Then you might have to cut out some of the nicer things, like a good neighborhood or a washer and dryer hook ups (or the machines themselves). The unit might be older and while everything should be in good repair (i.e. everything working) it probably won't look the best. If location is more important then you'll probably have to sacrifice on something else (usually price) nicer areas are obviously going to be more expensive. Are amenities important? Pool, dishwasher, gated, washer/dryer, places with these are going to be more and may not be available in the area you want (I wanted to live in a specific neighborhood but since it's older, most places don't have washer/dryers in the units). <br>  <br>  So figure out what is most important, if all else fails go by location. Always always always SEE IT IN PERSON!!!!! My boyfriend and I couldn't do this once (we were moving cross country so we didn't have a choice) and the photos made it look nice and big, when we got there it was so small I almost started crying. Also, empty apartments look smaller, you'd be surprised how much crap you can fit in 300sq.ft.<br>  <br>  Talk to the leasing manager, they want happy tenants so they want people that fit, so if you're a partier, a place with thin walls might not be a good fit. Also, ask if the build is a community instead of just a complex, in my building we're all friends, we all know each other (a couple of people have been there for 20 years). Is it mostly old people or people your age? One of the most important things you can ask is what the rules are (some places have really stupid rules) like my complex doesn't allow alcholol in any public areas, you can't even have a beer while chilling by the pool. Also, ask what's required to live there, like renter's insruance (good to have even if it's not required, we had a neighbor blow up his apartment several months ago and had it spread we would have lost everything and at that point didn't have insurance, our $50,000 policy is $30 a month and has $100,000 libality to cover any damages we do to the place, like blow it up or something).<br>  <br>  Just feel it out, tell them it's your first time and they should be able to help you quite a bit.|`|d1431527582f8f414e0e05855712ef5faa	Susie, you want have your credit information in good shape. Visit several places and have them show you around. Ask for a copy of their leasing agreements so you can take them home and read them at your convenience. If you don't understand something, don't be embarassed to ask them. Everyone has to start somewhere. Better to understand upfront so that you aren't put in a situation later on that you don't care for or can't handle.  <br>  <br>  Obviously you want a safe neighborhood.<br>  That the building is maintained well , talk with other tenants<br>  Check with the police department on issues with each place<br>  Check with the county/city offices to make sure there are no complaints unresolved for each place.<br>  <br>  You will most likely need deposit money, that can differ from place to place. If you have a pet  or plan to get one, you want to know what the rules and costs on them. <br>  <br>  You'll need to make arrangement for utilties that you may be responsible for.  That could include some deposit money too. <br>  <br>  Be sure you understand what your rights are in renting in any city. What the law's are that governing your deposit, when they can keep it and how long they have to notify you they are keeping. <br>  <br>  One biggie!  When you do get ready to move out, make sure to have a friend with you and take pictures.  Should they try to keep you deposit, you will have proof of the condition of the place. <br>  <br>  I know it sounds like a lot, but once you've been through it, it's a piece of cake.   Best of luck

If you buy it and then declare bankruptcy a month later the judge doesn't have to allow either that one debt or the entire thing. Also, if you are planning to buy it on credit and you're already so far down that you need to declare bankruptcy, I highly doubt you'd be approved. Golf carts are a luxury, you have feet, use them.

If you are thinking this will be the family house after you have children you will want a place for them to play.  Will you have a long commute to work?  Not only time spent on the road, but also cost of fuel to get to and from work.  Any planned construction for the area that may lower the value or desirability of the property?  Do you think you will enjoy life in this neighborhood now, before you have children?  Cost of some repairs (like the roof) may be more costly because of the size.<br>  <br>  There are other things to consider, but I would say those are some to think about. <br>  <br>  Otherwise, it may be that this is a good deal for you so long as all other factors work out (as you noted in your add'l details).<br>  <br>  Good luck

It all comes down to what they're willing to do, if they negotiate a lower payment, they lose money in the short run but you are still paying something in the long run. But if they refuse (because legally you agreed to pay that amount) and you stop paying they can sue you for the entire amount and court fees, so it's a hassle but they get all their money eventually and you have a very negative report on your credit. <br>  <br>  It can't hurt to ask but most likely they will hold you to the agreement especially if you have a newer lease.|`|24kFbAdsaa	Not likely at all.  They have you over a barrel.  The leasing company bought the car and leased it back to you.  They have no interest in reducing your terms.  Your lease payments are based upon the length of the lease and the expected residual value of the car.  If they lower payments, they would have to extend the length of the lease an extra 12 - 24 months to recover their costs.  If they extended the length, the residual value of the car would be considerably less, therefore, to recover the lost residual value from the original terms, they would have to raise your monthly payment - it's a vicious circle that you can't get out of.|`|DhynnoO5aa	Don't bet on it....I recently turned in my Caddy due to lease end; GM was not willing to deal on the purchase price so I decided to turn the car in and let them take the loss.

Didn't receive it so I called this morning and after she left me on hold for 30 minutes (apparently they don't make it easy for the folks manning the irs phones to find info either) she said the DD didn't go out and they were still reviewing it.  I have my fingers crossed for this coming Friday...we shall see!

If they don't pay, they have agreed in the contract that you can take the car back.  .  and of course, you would then resell it.  You would need a contract with a repo svc.  I would try to get them regular financing if possible..  but I think that would be a good way to insure success in these difficult times.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!!

rSTNUGy3aa	My friend's mother had worked as a human resources (HR) manager at a law firm and mentioned that one usually would need a bachelor's degree in 'something' and perhaps graduated from a paralegal program accredited by the ABA to possibly land a job.  A lawyer once told me that he could merely instead hire a law student on a part-time basis and not have to pay fringe benefits as with a full-time paralegal.|`|3mAgM405aa	The opportunities for a paralegal really depends on the specialty. The most in demand paralegals are those in the litigation field; followed by corporate paralegals who are responsible for maintaining corporate records, articles of incorporation, etc. While the "least" marketable [but the "highest" paid] paralegals are in the field of intellectual property [i.e., patents, trademarks] and immigration law. In conclusion, choose your paralegal courses accordingly, with emphasis on litigation preparation [discovery], docketing/calendaring of incoming pleadings [calendaring] and trial preparation [creating Exhibit tabs, Bajii jury instructions, etc.]. The "pro" side of a litigation paralegal is often "unlimited" overtime which can amount to a high salary range of $65,000 to $75,000 per year, while the "downside," being constantly pressured to meet a monthly client billable quota. And failing to meet that quota, often results in the paralegal's overnight dismissal. It's not a pretty picture. I just want to lay out what really happens in the real world of litigators and their relationship with subordinate paralegals.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

Try small stores and resturants, mostly privately owned (not chain stores).

Period. End of story.<br>  <br>  Second, have your friend contact the settlement attorney who handled the closing. The settlement company should have a complete set of documents.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work, she should contact the real estate agent they used when purchasing the property. The agent might have some of that information. Even if he/she doesn't, the agent can probably point your friend in the right direction.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work, your friend ought to be able to find out by going to the city or county courthouse. The mortgage will be recorded as a lien against the property. As such, there will be full information on the lien as to the lien holder.<br>  <br>  That's how it's done.<br>  <br>  Just don't let her sign anything without her own lawyer explicitly approving. (And from what you've described, no competent lawyer would allow her to sign any sort of document prepared by her ex-husband.)<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|O3kJrdt7aa	If he is trying to get her to sign papers to say that she will pay for something then she just might not be on the mortgage papers at all.  All I can say is don't sign N-E-Thing it just might be a trick.  And if he tries to take you to court make sure you have the information that he gave you because to give some one false information means things aren't what they seem.  Meaning he don't want you to know anything about the house and since that is the case don't stress yourself.

N03iVenVaa	The gift tax is on the giver not the receiver.
SN5dYkafaa	Great question! First, gifts are not taxable to the recipient, nor can they be deducted by the donor. The annual gift-tax exclusion for 2009 is $13,000 per person/per unlimited number of recipients. So if Mom isn't married, she can give up to $26,000 (13k each, your friend and his wife) with no gift tax implications.<br>  <br>  If she gave them $40,000 in the same calendar year, $14,000 would be considered a taxable gift, a gift tax return would be filed, and this amount would reduce her current $3.5 million estate-tax exemption to $3,486,000, assuming no other taxable gifts were made.<br>  <br>  If Mom is married, and she and her spouse elect to "split" the gifts, you can double the original amount to $52,000.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.  <br>  <br>  PS - be sure to choose your "Best Answer" when the time comes.

Depending upon how much the givers have given away in their lifetimes, gift tax may or may not be owed.|`|12d54aae44a56fa45d6d9f5011d6c253aa	$10,000 I think is the highest you can give to one person w/out being taxed.<br>  <br>  Although, I believe it was changed in Jan 2009 to $13,000.<br>  <br>  If your mom gave 13,000 and then grandparents (2 people) gave 26,000 then that is okay.  So, the most would be $39,000.  This is all they could gift for the year tough.  It includes cash and assets.<br>  <br>  It's not taxable income (the gift) and the giver doesn't have to report it as assets and pay tax on it.<br>  <br>  You may want to read more on this and make 100% sure this is correct.

A home loan is backed by the value of your home (the collateral), so it is not unsecured.  A credit card is only backed by your "promise" to pay and is, therefore, unsecured.
AA11969509	I suspect they want an estate tax because they think it would be best for society, not because it would help them personally.  Remember they are giving away a lot of their billions on philanthropic causes.|`|OdxrtbF1aa	Bill Q is correct.  It concerns me greatly that our government is into this huge spending spree to stimulate the economy without adding any taxes to keep us solvent.  We need some serious tax revenues to pay for all of the new democrat programs in the stimulus package.  Our dollar is at risk as is the whole economy if this goes badly.  We had a Trillion dollar deficit going into this, and now the various stimulus spending packages will add at least another trillion of debt.  We need a gas tax and estate tax and more to get us back solvent.|`|AA10007793	It promotes philanthropy.  Giving it away instead of paying taxes on it.  Giving while living.|`|AA11780191	You're also talking about the world's most generous philanthropists, #1 and 2.  And I think it's an utterly natural response for men who've attained the extent of wealth as they have.  As capitalists both, and self made men both, they are deserving of their place among the world's wealthiest.  However, for each of them to support any kind of reduction of estate taxes would imply their belief that their accomplishments, their wealth should extend to future generations of their kin... without question, without qualification.  Buffett himself has remarked:<br>  <br>  "Dynastic wealth, the enemy of a meritocracy, is on the rise. Equality of opportunity has been on the decline," Buffett said. "A progressive and meaningful estate tax is needed to curb the movement of a democracy toward plutocracy."<br>  <br>  And a poignant analogy he made to reinforce his belief:<br>  <br>  "I don't believe in dynastic wealth," Buffett has said, likening inherited wealth to choosing the 2020 Olympic team by picking the eldest sons of the gold medal winners in the 2000 Olympics.|`|PGLZ3LiYaa	As with hollywood stars, as you get a lot of money, you lose touch with reality.

To find joy in your life you need to find out what is most important to you. (Not your parents, your friends, your girlfriend)  Really sit down and make a list.  Then prioritize it.<br>  <br>  You may have to compromise things sometimes.  But ultimately if you want to be happy you need to make the choices yourself and be confident in your choices.

I've had one and made changes in my life that have made my life more joyful and manageable.
CL9zXIA7aa	Yeah, so much for unions helping the working man in this country. They are the major cause for the loss of jobs. You obviously need to find a new job. As far as the package, I'd suggest talking to a lawyer. He might suggest you taking the package as it may be better off than taking nothing. And you still may be able to collect unemployment. But most importantly you need to look for a new job as unemployment doesn't pay much and eventually runs out. Good luck!|`|cTA9kWWfaa	Sounds like you have some heavy hitting issues with your company, sorry to hear. If you need any help transferring pension/401k funds feel free to contact me.

In fact, I went to a 4-year school and half of my class were non-traditional students. Many in the 40+ age range  pursuing a second career.

You can always get the BSN later and you'll be just as marketable with a 2-year RN. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to get through nursing school, you just have to jump through the hurdles they put up for you. I would also go to your financial aid office to see if there are any grants or assistance for single mothers which I'm pretty sure there is as my sister received some sort of Financial aid while getting through college with her daughter. Also, When you start clinicals, that's when things really start to get hectic. Try to get loans that will cover your living expenses as well so that you're not stressing over groceries and the electricity bill. It will be money well spent. It sounds like really your biggest hurdle will be lining up reliable childcare while you are undertaking your schooling. Start arranging that now so that you're not scrambling at the last minute.

y4SUDnpaaa	The broker is correct you cannot refinance with no equity in your loan. After having the loan only 3 weeks you wouldn't have even made more than one payment or maybe none. You would basically be asking for a 100% loan to value mortgage since the balance will virtually will not have gone down.Plus you would have closing costs to pay out of pocket.

I wouldn't advise buying gold at this time, it's near its all time high and could have a correction.  Besides that, the government has run out of gold coins, so they're selling at an even higher premium.  I'd advise to spend on consumer goods, things you will need in the future.  Guns would be a good investment now, they may soon become more difficult to acquire.  And of course non-perishable food, a year’s supply of toilet paper would be good.  This is because the real fear now is inflation and shortages.  When inflation starts kicking in, obama and this democratic congress will likely do what carter did; try price controls.

I'm not even sure of the numbers you are giving me...  Is it a $60,000 house and you are putting down $5,000 so it will be $55,000 as mentioned in the main question?  If so, you can expect the payments to be ~$320, which will probably shoot to around ~$450 when considering tax, insurance and PMI.  If the house is actually 55,000 and you are putting down another 5000 this will be different.  There are tons of mortgage calculators online for this type of purpose, and I am adding one in my sources.  Good luck!|`|Pjm9pg7iaa	Your total payment will be $420 a month.

Why do you stay with a man you cannot trust and have no respect for?|`|CL9zXIA7aa	Sweetie, it sounds as though you have deeper problems than this $1,200. You have your money and his money. You have your accounts and his accounts. And you're fighting over whose money is whose? Sounds like you need to see a marriage counselor before going to the police. Good luck!

AA11897249	Just cause you can't do it doesn't mean it can't be done.  Professional traders and true hedgers are more than capable of making or taking delivery.|`|ww12lItvaa	Why is it impossible? <br>  <br>  You can make physical delivery by buying a contract from somebody that physically holds the commodity. <br>  <br>  What you are talking about is writing a contract "naked", without owning the commodity. Are you writing contracts?<br>  <br>  With shorting stocks, it is illegal but had been unenforced to some extent to short a stock without the stock being available to be shorted.   <br>  <br>  I can't say about commodities. I recall they were thinking about a "market" where it was all speculation without requiring the asset. But I didn't think they were doing that yet.

MbzyriZ4aa	This is how greendot prepay Visa works:<br>  <br>  You go to a store that sells them and pay the initial starter fee.<br>  (Usually around $54.99 or $24.99).<br>  In return for your money you will receive a very long receipt from the machine with instructions on where to send off for your prepaid visa card that has your name on it.<br>  <br>  Eventually you will receive in the mail a prepaid Visa Green Dot card that has your actual name on it.<br>  It is loaded with your initial "load" amount. Either $50 or $20.<br>  The 4.95 (or $9.95 initial feel ) is usually a fee for handling and making the card.<br>  <br>  If you need to reload the card you go to any retailer that sells "reloads". They usually tell you what kind of "reload" amounts are available from their terminal. The usual is $24.95, $54.95 or $104.95. Places like Walmart can reload larger amounts.<br>  You pay the amount and they give you a receipt with a PIN number and instructions how to call in your "reload" amount.<br>  You call the 1-800 number, punch in your PIN number from the receipt and your green dot card is reloaded with the amount. (Minus the $4.95)

DisdrG4Taa	There is no way to answer this question in most cases.<br>  <br>  A high percentage of medical malpractice and negligence cases are taken on a contingency basis.  This means that if the plaintiff loses the lawsuit, the lawyer will not collect any fees, and will often be out the expenses for the case..  A good attorney would try to accept cases that has a significant likelihood of settling or getting a positive verdict, and would attempt to not accept clients with cases which are less likely to result in a positive outcome.. Most will try to get the defendant's insurance carrier to settle prior to trial, so that they decrease their risk of loss, and decrease their costs. The average attorney who practices malpractice law on a local level will make 200-300 thousand a year if they are good.  The ones who make significant incomes are those in Mass Torts, which collect large numbers of clients and file class action suits based on a drug or medical device issue.<br>  <br>  Attorneys making millions a year for normal case work is not the average, and will only occur on the rare high level award, most of which are appealed, and decreased at a later date.|`|Zs2lUCI4aa	How can be measured every week, month? some can make 5 million per year by suing hospital, insurance.
60bd08cd30457d86d8a2037a188b85e3aa	Ashley,<br>  <br>  First - you have two resumes, one targeting your current industry, the other targeting the new industry.<br>  <br>  On LinkedIn you only have one profile - so you've got to decide how you want to position yourself.

I was always told in my "career prep (freshman academy)" class where they teach you about applications that you should put down every single thing possible because it just makes you look that much better. Every job, even the lowest like flipping burgers at McDonalds, can be twisted into something good.<br>  Good luck!

aLy3ai90aa	If it was sent using USPS Priority Mail you will have it in 2-3 Days. If it was sent parcel post you will get it in 6-10 days.|`|anGiS8nDaa	Things get screwed up and may take a day or two extra on occasions. Unless you got like a one day over night extra shipping thing then you cant complain, just wait.|`|ds1RoS80aa	First, when an eBay seller says "Fast Shipping" he means that he will ship the item quickly.  No eBay seller can guarantee the delivery time because that is outside his control.<br>  <br>  Also, except for Express Mail, all delivery times are estimates.  Parcel post has been horrendous this year, sometimes taking a month for delivery.  A postal service employee told me it could take six weeks.<br>  <br>  Finally, flat rate shipping service means that the seller didn't select a delivery type in his listing.  It would be reasonable for you to write to the seller and ask when and how the item will be shipped.  Also ask if there is a tracking number.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  Larry (eBay Power Seller)
mY19PPlIaa	The higher your income the less your return.
8oi3gCZoaa	It's a good thing that you stopped payment on the check.  Obviously he was lying when he said he had already cashed it.<br>  <br>  He cannot get the police to do anything to you.  <br>  <br>  I am assuming that he did not give you a receipt that says "No Returns" or "All sales final" -- if he gave you anything in writing that says no returns/all sales are final, he can sue you in small claims court.<br>  <br>  If your bank did truly stop payment on the check, then you have to give the stuff back.  Send the guy a registered letter saying that you want to return the items that rightfully belong to him.  You can add that you want to complete the transaction within five business days and that if you do not hear from him within ten days, you are donating the items to charity.  Stop calling/emailing.  If the registered letter doesn't get him to contact you, then he's nuts.  When you go to the post office, make sure you are sending the kind of letter that requires a signature for delivery.  And SAVE THE RECEIPT from the post office and a xerox of the letter.  When the post office sends you the form that was signed, save that, too.<br>  <br>  I am not an attorney and am not posting this as legal advice.  This is just what I would do in the same situation.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|7euYlgjSaa	Yeah thats really good that you cancelled the check. Is there anyway you can talk to the police department and ask to leave the stuff there or something. You can email the guy and tell him that you will leave it there and if he wants his stuff back to go, or its his lost. <br>  <br>  He can probably file for small claims court or something. But he will be really dumb to do that because he will for sure lose. <br>  <br>  Record all contact with him and save his email, just in case. Email him that you will leave his stuff somewhere.. better in a government office, because he told you that you can return it. Just have everything in writing and verify that it was sent. <br>  <br>  I hope that helps.|`|nOTS9oS9aa	First of all, I am not a lawyer, but in my opinion, you got a bad deal, this guy took advantage of you. A  serious business man would not persist on the deal. He would relent for later business. <br>  I am pretty sure, when you can proof that you return the goods, the best is a receipt, but some photos and witnesses will do, he has no ground for a warrant. <br>  From your story it sounds that that person is not an Honest Joe. Do you really believe, that he has not more reason to stay away from the police. Would he threaten me with a warrant, I would threaten him with filing charge because of fraud.<br>  Just think about it.|`|9rNNOEnwaa	1) How did you cancel a check that had already been cashed?<br>  <br>  2) Things aren't always the same price. So what he wanted for the item isn't what the next guy would.
ZBFE9AqZaa	I would consult a lawyer. sounds like you have good case to win alot of money.|`|moiMSUYYaa	What is your goal? Do you want to sue someone or do you want to find a place to live? <br>  <br>  If you want to pursue this house then contact your agent and insist that her Broker speak to the Broker of the Better Homes agency. A Broker to Broker conversation will probably clarify whatever misunderstanding there is about renting to you and your girls and any insurance issues.<br>  <br>  Now, have you fairly represented your situation?  If you are on Section 8 housing or some other assistance program then that landlord is under no obligation to rent to tenants under that system.|`|9rNNOEnwaa	He's pretty dumb is he came right out and said that. If he just did not want you as a tenant there are many other ways to go about it that are legal. He does not have to rent to you if he does not want to BUT he can not refuse to because your girls are deaf.

2kIoVqsUaa	with BTech in hand you looking to change your field. You have many options to choose like Administration, Sales, Marketing, etc... As a techie I would stay in technical filed and learn, experience some years in the same field, so that moving to other fields like sales, mktg, etc... would be much easier as you know technology you are better positioned to perform these tasks than any other who just have sales background but do not know abc of technicals. After school changing field just to land into the job would never give you chance to go back to your favourite technical subject later as you may not have related field experience.|`|ZBFE9AqZaa	data entry or management possiblities.|`|PQZpqfhuaa	By joining the MBA u can be able to make ur career best after the completion of ur B.tech because now its boom to banking for software people and job security is high compared to software jobs........<br>  <br>  And im doing B.tech in IT
ujAzSfCzaa	Your realtor cannot help you remove a subject clause.  You may need a title company or lawyer.<br>  <br>  A conveyance is a document that transfers title from one person to another.  In order for it to be valid the signature needs to be witnessed by a licensed person called a notary.
