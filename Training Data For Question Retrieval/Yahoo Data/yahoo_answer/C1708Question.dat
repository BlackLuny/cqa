20090106121822AApJhwQ	News & Events;Media & Journalism	Porquê a imprensa n?o condena o Marcelo Camelo por estar seduzindo uma menor inocente?	O Marcelo Camelo, da banda Los Hermanos anunciou que está tendo um caso com a cantora Mallu Magalh?es. Essa notícia seria normal se n?o fosse por um detalhe: Ela tem apenas 15 anos e ele 30.      O pior é que assistindo a entrevista que essa garota deu ao programa do J? -  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdAlGvJR5...  -  notei que ela tem a mentalidade de uma crian?a de 8 anos. Que tipo de doente sente atra??o sexual por uma garota de 15 anos, que aparenta ter 12 e que conversa como se tivesse apenas 8???       N?o acham que já está na hora da nossa imprensa parar de hipocrisia e tocar nesse assunto? Ou será que as pessoas ditas "cult" est?o acima do bem e do mal?      Garanto que se um cidad?o comum for pego na mesma situa??o desse Marcelo Camelo, a imprensa o classificaria como um monstro pedófilo canalha que seduziu uma garotinha ingênua.

The problem of global terrorism can't be solved unless we answer the question of radicalization of Islam, especially in countries like Pakistan and Afghanistan that despite being on economic verge are still in support of such activities.

20090220220001AAV9uXz	News & Events;Current Events	I see a threat posed by some possibly irresponsible actions by the press at large! Your thoughts please!?	I just read a news story which caused me to reverse a decision I had made about selling my only handgun to raise some short term cash. I had felt OK about selling this gun because it has just been locked up for years and I don't really need it. The world isn't that dangerous of a place.       After reading  "Soros sees no bottom for world financial "collapse" "  - I'm not so sure it will remain so, Armageddon anyone?       My point is the following. Shouldn't some degree of restraint be practiced in publishing such disturbing things maybe a bit more quietly? Or something????    I feel, due to my own sense of how news stories affect my own behavior (as a consumer for example - my spending shriveled at the repeat appearance of "sky is falling" stories long before actual rises in prices would have caused such alarm ). Am I alone in this sense that this kind of sensational presentation of gloomy predictions may have a bit of a causal effect? For those who might point out that I have just acted ( in posting this question ) to feed this very process I'll say: the story is already front page news. Ideas please...
