20090304221218AAeRTfL	Beauty & Style;Hair	Dying my hair unnaturally red...?	Okay, a while ago I ordered some unnatural red hair dye. It's like...red, but a bit lighter and more subtle (or atleat the picture on the box is). My hair color is currently a medium brown with some strawberry blonde in it (it was dyed black months ago and then stripped, leaving it brown and strawberry blonde, the latter being my natural color. I want to get the darkest result from this dye but I'm not sure what I can do to get the results I want. I was going to bleach it, thinking it would give a stronger result, like you would with Manic Panic or Special Effect dyes. My aunt, who is good at dying hair, said that it would turn it pink. The box shows the original color and end color results. For black it shows a dark red, which is what I want. For blonde, it shows a light red. However, this doesn't make sense to me. If I had black hair and dyed it red, wouldn't it do pretty much nothing at all? I don't know what to do!

I can't really decide what face shape I have...it looks roundish from far, up close the jaw and temples look sort of square/triangular. Still, up close it looks a little longer. I was thinking straight bangs would balance it out and make it look rounder. But then I also have a big nose. Not only is it too wide, it's also pointed downwards. Also, I have a small mouth, it's around the same width as my nose. My lips aren't thin though, and they have a sort of pretty shape.       What can I do to balance out my features? I'd prefer not to wear any make-up, but I will if it's my only option.

20090305073440AAQDz6Z	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Tattoos	People who choose skulls and demons and similarly 'deathly' stuff as tattoo subjects...?	What are the motives behind doing so?      Just to confirm I'm not challenging it or disapproving in any way. I think the world would be extremely boring if we all chose the same things!      I'm just very interested in tattoos and why people get what they do, and of course this sort of subject matter is a very common one with both men and women, so those of you who endulge in that theme - what is it about it that attracts you to it?      For example, I know a lot of typically nice looking young women choose designs with skulls etc. Of course it is a gross stereotype to assume that such people would want something more 'girly', but I'm wondering particularly in the cases where looking at your face you might never think you had skulls etc under your clothes, what it is that you love about this sort of imagery?      (If anyone is wondering, my 'theme' if you like is black and grey pieces, some lettering and a lot of sort of art nouveau style detail, moving onto a couple of portraits when I have more money and expanding on the vintage imagery, because I've always loved this 'brand' of art)      Anybody else reading this is welcome to share their reasons for their types of tattoos whatever they are, by the way, even if you haven't gone down the 'deathly imagery road'.

20090227052829AAn1hMo	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	What should I do about these jeans?	I'm 30, average height and slender.  I feel best in jeans that have a little stretch, fit me and make me look slim, and they tend to be the low rise skinny jeans especially from Aero.  I have 2 pairs from them, and I've gotten jeans elsewhere from the miss depts and other stores that are for my age group (mostly because my mom & sis have pressured me).  But I just don't feel those jeans are flattering!  They are too baggy on me, too loose, and make me look fat.  Even though the rise might be a lil higher, they start to fall down and I need a belt.     I really want to just get more pairs from Aero, and mentioned to my sis that, and she was like, c'mon, those aren't for you, you need to stop wearing jeans like that.  I'm torn -- I know they're meant for teenagers, but I don't wear the ones that are totally teeny.  They're just denim, and it's the cut, fit and stretch I like so much.     Should I listen to my fam or go with what I like better?

Anyway, my question is: the part where that ribbon trim is chafes against my thighs (the skirt is a very fitted on me, but not so much that it looks weird or anything).      What can I  do to make it not scrape against my skin, without ruining the skirt for the other girls I share it with?

20090305100146AAjG9ZD	Beauty & Style;Makeup	To ALL Ladies that are having hard time finding Foundation!!!!?	This is not a question. I would like to say that for the longest time i was having a horrible time looking for a foundation and loose powder. I went to Walgreens earlier this week and bought two products that i will forever purchase (or until they stop making them). Its a foundation by CoverGirl called Advanced Radiance and loose translucent powder, also by CoverGirl. The Advanced Radiance foundation is amazing. At only $11 a piece you get amazing coverage that stays on all day. I have tried so many foundations, even the famous Revlon Colorstay. My only issue with the color stay is that it stays on too long and even after several washes i cannot get it to come off. Advanced Radiance has Olay ingredients in it as well as SPF so its good for your skin. Now, the loose power (NOT THE MINERALS ONE) the Professional loose powder by CoverGirl is wonderful. it Blends perfectly with the foundation and stays ON unlike many powders that i have tried in the past. I just wanted to write this to show my appreciation for the products and i hope that many of you, provided you try these products, will be as happy with the products as i am.

There is a very visible line along my hairline where the dye stained my skin.  It looks silly.  I don't go and get my hair done often since I have two kids and another on the way, I would rather just spend my extra money on the kids and not myself.  So, it's a big deal to me to take the time and money and go get my hair done.  I haven't had my hair colored a lot, but I've never had my skin stained like this.  Is it normal for hairdresser to stain your skin?  Should I go in an complain about it?  I don't want to make a big deal out of nothing, but it is really annoying to me that she didn't even try to wipe it away after she put the color on.  What would  you do?

20090305094746AAQ8YDw	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	My piercing ???????????	I had my navel pierced about 3 weeks ago. The piercer told me to use savlon wound wash. For the first few days it was what i expected, tender a little red and hurt when i bent over etc, after a few days the redness cleared up and the jewellery was able to move freely while i was bathing it. Gradually the redness returned along with the lymth which im not concered about. The thing im concerned about is the redness returning around the piercing, and the sorness when i get up/sit down. Its like when the jeweller moved through the hole it hurts. Is this due to the swelling going down and the barbell being too big? Also iv been hearing that sea salt is the best thing to use, shall i just go ahead and use that? iv been using general salt and boiled water, a couple of times, just to see what was better. But mosly i use savlon wound wash. Can anyone give me some advice? I want to know if its infected, i dont want the infection to be inside my body, my cousin got setisimia or something along those lines, from an infected spot that spread infection through her body, i dont want that to  happen to me!!

Obviously I can't actually make my hips smaller, as it's the bone that's the problem. So my question is, what can I do/wear to make them look smaller than they are?

My problem is that my bra size is 32D, and even if the bra has no padding/ lining at all, my tops generally tend to pull around the bust. Logically, buying a larger size seems like the answer, but then it doesn't fit my waist and looks sloppy.    Babydolls in general make look preggo. Needless to say button downs are the enemy! Any tips?       I am trying to avoid tailoring everything I own due to cost, so if you know of any brands that are cut larger in the bust and small in the waist please let me know!

I want to get this piece black and white with maybe some color in it. How does that idea sound?

How can I advertise? It basically says in the rules that you can't advertise. Where do I get the smock from? I know I don't need it I just want it. Where do I buy the samples from? About how much money do you spend before you really start making money? Can I go to NJ (where my family lives) and have Mary Kay parties even though I am in Mississippi? How much money should I put away for taxes? The consultant last night used circular reasoning so I never got a straight answer. I would really just like to know the basics.
