20090220110820AAf9VGO	Local Businesses;United States;Atlanta	When I do I start logging jobs on my "Record of Work search" sheet for Unemployment?	I received a letter in the mail today (2/20/2009). It states on it that the date the letter was mailed on was the 17th.       I only get $65 per week for a potential number of 13 weeks, and a maximum benefit amount of $845. Better than nothing, of course; but that isn't worth a crap. As of today, I haven't logged anything on my green "Record of Work search" sheets where I'm supposed to call companies that I've applied at and followed up on my applications. With some places, you can not get the job because of that. But also, I haven't gotten anything monetarily from the Georgia Dept. Of Labor. I did not get a check with this determination letter.      They gave me a paper when I went to the orientation class about Unemployment, which said to not file on 2/15/2009 - but to wait until 2/22/2009 and file for both 2/15/2009 and 2/22/2009 on 2/22/2009. So I'm assuming they are going to catch that back up again?      But my real question is...when is it necessary for me to start logging on this sheet? I've kept my own records of what places I applied to, and when...but haven't written them on this stupid green sheet because they haven't paid me jack to "report" my work search records to them. What date should I start logging on the green sheets? When I get my first check or something? Nobody told us that.

20090220123822AAmFhAK	Local Businesses;United States;New York City	Is there a gym in NYC that won't rip you off?	I've been researching gyms and it seems that it's extremely easy to get ripped off or go on wild goose chases to legitimately cancel membership and get money back. All I want is a place to take an exercise class or two a week. I live in Brooklyn and there's a Lucille Roberts and a Curves very close to my apartment, but I've heard horror stories about almost every gym ripping people off. Any suggestions?

I feel as sick as a sick dog, so it's probably not wise for me to go into work today.  But it occured to me that I have never called in sick before.  Therefore, I don't even know what number to call.  Do I just call the store's number?  Or is there a specific number for employees to call? Thanks in advance.

I went to B&H because I'd already seen a camera I wanted but forgot all about the brochure, anyway I was wondering if anyone knew whether the gift was anything decent?
