TjPwxbuJaa	Well, I have one. Easiest piercing ever, no infection, no troubles. That's not to say that an infection can't occur, but areas around the mouth heal very quickly. And it hasn't messed up my teeth. Be sure to get a labret post that's not too long so it doesn't touch your gums or teeth. And it definitely doesn't mess up kissing!  Typical labret piercings are 16 or 14g. Once healed (after about a month) you can take the jewelry out for a period and nobody would know that you have it.|`|QaVLgTQCaa	Stick w the fake if u don't mind that its fake, it would get in the way of kissing and you won't be able to kiss till it heals lol|`|m7putYGmaa	i have a labret... if they pierce it in the right place, it wont mess up your teeth, you can always change your jewellery so it doesn't interfere with kissing and your acting    a regular labret stud doesn't get in the way of anything  a ring might effect kissing and take getting used to with eating with  you can get a clear plastic retainer for when youre acting    if you decide to remove it, it heals into a very tiny barely noticable scar    i have 19 piercings, and my labret was the easiest one to take care of|`|UYnZtJ2daa	Honestly, it sounds like you're kind of young and you don't know for sure if you want it or not...wait a little longer until you're older.    If it's pierced in the proper place, it shouldn't mess with your teeth. Mine doesn't touch my teeth nor my gums. But if you're doing theatre and have to take it out a lot that's a problem. First, you can't take it out until it's healed. Second, lip piercings are notorious for closing up really fast. I've had mine for almost 2.5 years now and if I take it out for like 6+ hours, it will probably close up a bit. I wear stud, but used to wear a ring and never found problems kissing.    Just wait a little longer.

Try checking google to find out what "season" you are, then look up recommended colors for that season.    For cuts, heart shaped faces can wear almost anything (it's the most desirable face-shape) but you'd probably look best in long, side swept bangs and shoulder length hair.

If someone tells you your fat they are jealous women, or immature boys and I have a few choice words for them.
mi7uhG7iaa	Burberry Brit is gorgeous- it lasts forever and is more dramatic than a lot of fragrances today.  And if you like vanilla-type scents, D&G has some beautiful ones.  Brit is my favorite, though.     Keep in mind, however, that sampling them yourself, on your skin, is the only way that you can really tell what kind of perfume is best for you.  Perfume mixes with your hormones and smells different on different people- and that way, you get to try them for yourself, instead of taking random peoples' opinions.  =)|`|GrwWH5XJaa	The scent of my co worker that just passed by!

WqI4rCrhaa	ok, don't wear big earrings AND a necklace with a strapless dress. If your hair is going up, wear simple, classy studs and a gaudy necklace, or Big flashy earrings and no necklace....less is more.       I'm assuming you need a cover-up for dress code reasons? That sucks, since strapless dresses aren't meant to have cover-ups. Try to find a sheer black shrug. -look at Macy's.       Wear a peep-toe wedge that matches the color of your cover-up, and have your toes re-painted- they dont go! :-)  Get a french.  I'm a nail tech- it's the best way to go with toes. whatever you do, DO NOT wear closed toe flats!!  Sooo not fashion-fwd formal.    Wear a smokey grey shadow in the crease of your eyelids- Eggplant liner, black mascara.  Pale pink cheeks/lips.  Your lips should be neutral when your eyes are dramatic....

kknSPYxKaa	Mane N' Tail Shampoo and Conditioner.  You can buy it at Sally's Beauty Supply or CVS for about $6 a bottle.  That may sound like a lot of money, but the bottle contains 32 ounces and that is about 3 times as much as what is in a bottle of Pantene.  I have been using it for about 3 weeks now and my hair has grown 1 inch!  That's a lot for me, because my hair grows super slow.  Not only does it make your hair grow faster, but it makes it softer, shiny, manageable, and thicker.  You will love it!    Hope I helped :)

Keep that in mind if that's your hair type.  Also, training your hair is the way to get it to go in the direction you want without these little fustrations. At first, if you need help, try blow-drying or flat ironing (depending on the look) in the direction you want them to lay in. Try a hairspray or VERY light layer of pomade.

I am a boy........lol|`|kUtm9ljGaa	I get those too. you should try just putting them in a little pony tail right before you go to sleep (they should be wet) and  then when you wake up, they will be clumped together, so just comb through them a little NOT A LOT, or the part will come back|`|lfdDHtB3aa	You need to blow dry with a brush the direction you want your bangs to go.  You can also use a hair wax to put in them but only put a tiny amount you dont want them to look oily.|`|pBvMaOfdaa	You could add for hair to your bangs, but I personally don't like thick bangs. Your other option would be to layer your bangs a lot more so that the it's lighter, resulting in bangs with no "parts." It will also be a lot easier to deal with.    Or if you don't want to cut your hair at all, just brush and clip your hair the direction and style you would like it, after you take a shower. When it dries, blowdry it with a circular brush, either inward or outward, and add a touch of styling gel or hair spray or mousse.     Good luck and hope this helped !|`|eGlUvVjnaa	hair straigtener|`|TSrPbjt3aa	where ever you part your hair is where the bangs part will come...so when u straighten ur hair, hold all of the bangs together and then straighten it all at once|`|6pi5aGasaa	When you strighten your hair, comb it over with a dmap brush afterwards. make it floffy, by combing it up a few times after you straighten it.

U7Tz5vI8aa	Simple.     Africa = Hot, Sun.    Also the same reason their skin is darker, to protect them from the sun.     Through evolution only people with the darkest skin survived.     And those people probably also had very nappy hair. Passing it on to their kids.     White skin, is to protect from colder areas. So those who survived had straighter hair.
IWGSD34Oaa	aussi  cause it smells good   hahah  :]|`|PTP8ptDbaa	none because they hurt the environment we are already dying here don't need more!!|`|XV7QHjPFaa	use skyscraper by samy salon systems, it is a vegan product, and if you spray A LOT of it in your eyes, it can never hurt you. It has a lot of hold, but once again, no matter how much you use, your hair never gets crunchy/greasy looking and if you brush it after curling limp naturally straight hair, if you spray it with samy skyscraper, the curls will hold. it Truly is an amazing product, and for a humongous bottle, i got it for $8.00. oh, and it leaves a citrusy smell, instead of an alcohol one.

pA4GHLXcaa	Hey :}  I have that glaze on my shower ledge right now and I use it a lot.  I believe it is okay, but you will not see results after like the 1st use.  I blowdry my hair after and I do not use the john frieda shampoo/cond.  I used to with the glaze, but I found no difference.   I leave it in for about 3 min. And It did make my hair somewhat blonder! So yeah, I recommend it.

Zh7QcGLtaa	What kind of job. That makes a big difference.|`|YuYSL0A2aa	It depends on where you are applying for a job with. The general rule is you dress one step up from the normal dress of the position you are applying for. For instance if the dress is casual (jeans and t-shirt) you would wear dress pants and a nice blouse (preferably a button up) and maybe low heels(closed toes). Since you are a teenager this would probably apply to most of the jobs you might apply for. Make sure your pants and top are not too tight fitting - it comes across as unprofessional & try to stay away from super bright colors or prints. If you have longer hair, simply wear it pulled back so it looks neat.   Arrive 10 minutes early, be polite, smile and don't be afraid to ask questions.   Good luck with your interview!|`|yo0qnedIaa	Something put together.  Nothing trashy. (i.e. ripped up jeans, low low shirts, mini skirt)    I suggest, black pants, kakis, or nice blue jeans.

N5sfCg87aa	I don't know of anything to get it out. You should go to a stylish and ask them and if you cant then just dye it your natural color and get some shampoo to fix it so it will heal from it being fried. Good luck, I hope your hair will look better.|`|T55YPfXUaa	wash it several times|`|CtHi5L78aa	you can try washing it out with dish soap i would use dawn, and leave it in your hair for about 20 mins or so and do that a few times a week, and do it for a few weeks that should lift your color and fade it out a little bit,  and i would go to your stylist and see if she has ever heard of a product called "elimnate" its the oppisite of bleach and takes as much color as it can out and take your back to close to your natural color as possible, then you might just have to color it to match your natural color.|`|yyDvNEJ8aa	to be on the safe side, ill say just wait till it fades out.  you dont wanna do anything to burn yur hair again.  or maybe go to a good stylist, and tell them your story and see what they can work out for you.  i dyed my hair black a while ago but wanted to get it out a little because i didnt like it, so i just shampooed my hair really good nd hard. lol you can try that

t2bMd6TVaa	Well, you're in luck because I had red hair, blue eyes, fair skin, and freckles! So, here is what I would do:    Makeup:  1. Put on a sheer foundation so your freckles will still be visible.  2. Use a peachy-rose cream blush. Apply to the apples of your cheeks.  3. Use a chocolate brown eyeliner and line the top lashes only.  4. Curl your eyelashes and use a black mascara. 2 coats on top lashes, 1 coat on bottom.  5. Use dark brown eyeshadow.    Hair:  Straight or Curly?  For curly hair, just wear it down, loose, and natural.  For straight hair, relaxed waves look really pretty and more dance-worthy.    Outfit:  Even though it's Valentine's Day, pinks and reds don't compliment our skin tone too well. Dark purples, teals, greens, and earth tones work really well. Make sure whatever you wear, you feel really comfortable.     Remember, dances are about having fun, so don't worry too much about how you look. Have fun!|`|d7RxeNJbaa	visit me at:  beauty-tips4you.blogspot.com|`|RTPVAyIyaa	Wow, your perfect for a valentines dance already (:    Put on frosty white eyeshadow, and red lips(:    Keep the hair curly.

lUO6wLGAaa	There is absolutely no unsightly bulging in this photo.  Period.  Now, get yourself a hot bikini, go out there and start driving the guys wild!|`|GWRP3vLQaa	You have the body of a 12 year old child. Happy now?|`|HiuZs5G5aa	thighs are suppose to be thicker than other parts of your body. but if you want to get them smaller run. running helps lose fat. and a lot of it. with good diet.|`|264GS7s7aa	do crunches and squats and lay off the popcorn|`|9dr0BZIbaa	I agree that thighs are generally a large part of your body.  But if you want to tone them up a bit, try bicycling or doing a bicycle workout technique.  To do this technique, lie on the floor or mat, raising your legs and doing a pedalling motion.|`|tnkLQkhKaa	lol this guys funny but your good|`|CFNozZM8aa	To tone your thighs:    20-50 reps of Plie Squats (Feet wider than hip width and toes pointed out)    Chair Pose for 30 seconds (Squat like your sitting in a chair, feet and legs together, and arms up over your head in a diving position)    20-50 reps of Basic Squats (Like your sitting and standing up from a chair)    Cresent Pose for 30 seconds each side (In a lunge position with arms straight up overhead)    20-40 reps of Walking Lunges (Just keep stepping into alternating Basic Lunges -- you'll need some floor space to do this.  If you don't have the space, Basic Lunges where you stay in the same place and just step back from each lunge will be fine)    20-40 reps of Pelvic Tilts (Lie on your back with your arms flat to your side, knees bent ninety degrees and hip width apart, feet flat on the floor.  Raise your butt up down, squeezing your thigh and butt muscles with you go up.)    20-40 reps each side of Leg Lifts (On your hands and knees, raise your right leg up towards the ceiling, keeping it bent with your feet flexed.  Switch sides and repeat.)    Of course you can do basic crunches, sit-ups, and leg lifts to flatten your abs, but here's a few more choices you can add to your workout.  To tone your midsection:    Plank Position for 30 seconds (Like a Push-up position but on your elbows with your forearms on the floor)    Boat Pose for 30 seconds (Lie flat on your back, legs extended.  Exhale and lift your legs and torso off the floor at the same time.  You should be sort of balancing on your butt to create a "V" shape with your body.  Keep your abs engaged to keep balanced.)    20-40 reps of Crunches (As opposed to the basic crunch, this crunch works your legs and arms a bit as well.  Sit on your butt and place your hands a few inches behind you, fingertips pointing towards your back, elbows slightly bent.  In one fluid motion, lean back, bending your elbows more, and extend your legs in front of you, feet together.  Make sure your legs don't touch the floor for this exercise.  Then contract your abs to sit back up, and at the same time bend your knees into your chest.  It's kind of like an accordion.  Repeat.)    20-40 reps of Knee Drops (Get into push-up position, legs together.  Bend your knees and drop them to one side, not letting them touch the floor.  Use your ab muscles to pull your legs back to push-up position.  Repeat on other side.)    Good luck!|`|GSVJyvrnaa	Learn how to spell.  & Wow. Lmao..

Pdim7dJsaa	i used to have this problem too. until i read that you should keep let the shampoo stay on your hair for at least five minutes. You can massage it in how you normally do but don't rinse right away. Also do not be aggressive when shampooing your hair, do it how its done by a hair stylist. When you are too aggressive with your hair it actually stimulates your glands for oil production. Also if you use conditioner afterwards, only apply to the ends of your hair, never on the top of your head. then rinse very thoroughly. Good luck! this can really make a big difference :)|`|YJCG2kn1aa	start washing it everydayy|`|YwHl37Hgaa	An excellent remedy for oily hair - Make an infusion by boiling some mint in one glass of water for 15 minutes and then strain the solution and use it for rinsing your hair.

5AkHM1mwaa	Wash, dry, and brush your hair completely. Teasing wet hair increases the likelihood of tearing and damage. If possible, do this while hanging your head upside-down to encourage volume in the roots. If you have time, curl your hair before you start, unless you're looking to create a smooth look, such as a beehive.      Separate a single strand or section of hair, moving and clipping the rest out of the way. Generally, it's best to start with hair towards the top of the head and work your way down. Smaller strands (e.g. 1 inch wide) will make for stiffer volume and will also take longer.      Hold the strand up firmly with one hand and hold a brush gently against the strand, approximately five inches away from the scalp.      Lightly brush towards the scalp while continuing to hold up the strand firmly with your other hand.      The strength with which you brush should be firm enough to create tangles that offer resistance, but not too vigorous so that the hair rips or the brush itself becomes tangled.   Repeat the teasing motion until the strand has the desired volume. The curlier the hair, the less teasing will be needed. Spritz the teased section with hairspray and let it down gently.      Use your fingers to make a loose "cage" around the teased section, holding it in place (but not flattening it). Lightly brush the un-teased section of the strand down, using only the tips of the brush and making sure not to touch or weigh down the teased section. If you want your hair to look wild and crazy, skip this step.   Put the teased strand aside carefully as you work on teasing other sections of your hair.      Scrunch the hair when you're done teasing for additional volume.|`|QwSMDJswaa	check this video out(:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=So-_udcLW...      she's REAAALLYY good in doing hair and makeup turorials ,   she has a really good volumizng hair video's soo i hope yhu enjoy her  all her vids are great soo check her out , and i hope this helped ! (:|`|Fj3VOlZCaa	mmm okay so no blowdrying :] . then after you wash your hair and its all dryyy. use an 8 or 9 leveled hairspray to volumize. First you get a rattail comb. you take a few strands of hair and then you pull it up. Take the brush and start brushing your hair down to the root. its kinda like doing yer scene hairrrrr buhh dont do it oto much or it would start to spike. Then after its all volumizeeed :] take the hairspray and lightly spray it on. anddddddddd WHO laaaaaa  haha good luck there :)      edit: andhearts you're an idiot|`|QE06hxMGaa	Use big sexy hair it like a voulmizing thing it a in a red like hair spray thing and look like there a mini bullhorn on the end spray that through ur hair then at ur root and trough ur hair tease it with a comb or take your fingcurve them and move them forward and back through your hair|`|mgM1Ot3Oaa	what i do is after i come out of the shower i leave my hair in a towel for around 5 min. then i comb it out and tease it. then i let it air dry a little then gather all the hair back and put it into a high ponytail that way when it dries up and you want to let it down then the hair will be volumous. this works at night so itll have time to dry overnight|`|eop8XnmKaa	Teasing is very damaging and recently i figured out how to get my hair to have volume all day:  Either     1. On damp hair put hair (at least first/top layer of hair) up in large velcro rollers  (i also usually apply a volumnizing mousse to hair when its wet/damp and lightly spray the hair with hairspray when its up in the rollers.)    or     2. On dry hair spray a section of hair with a light hairspray (preferably a light volumnizing hairspray) and then put it up in a large velcro roller (again at least do the first top layer of hair)    or    3. On dry hair put hair up in rollers (again at least the top layer) mist with a light hairspray and blast with your blow dryer. Wait until you hair fully cools to undo the rollers.    or    4. Run your flat iron over a section of your roots (or the whole section of hair) and then roll it up in a large Velcro roller. Let cool (like 15-30 minutes) and spray with a light volumnizing hairspray. Unroll and enjoy all the volume!     For each time you should leave the rollers in for 15-30 minutes. I usually do it for 30 because the longer you leave them in your hair the longer the volume will last. Also the rollers should be at least 2 inches big. I just saw a great deal of rollers (they are pink) by conair its 10 rollers for $9.99. When i do this to my hair the volume lasts all day.

Get a pair of dull rusty left-handed scissors.  Now put them in your right hand and cut your hair.  The uglier and sloppier it looks, the better.  After about thrity minutes of this self-abuse, give up and cry in true emo fashion.  Next try slitting your wrists with the dull rusty scissors.  Again, give up because you failed, cry some more.

If you're more on a budget, stick with the basic clothing stores- American Eagle, Old Navy, Abercrombie & Fitch, Gap, Express, H&M, or Forever 21. For shoes, go with Target, or Payless. For makeup, either for splurging, or saving try the makeup store, Sephora, and use companies like Stila, Clinique, Hard Candy, and Urban Decay.

I think you are a littile nervous with your physiq. We can not make changes in our body beyond a certain limit. But we can change our thinking, make our mind good. Why to worry about looks when our mind is beautiful. Don't run behind the rules of fashion. Make your new fashion. What you wear is a fashion & it is good for you when it is comfortable for you. If you are cofident enough then no clothes will make you look fat. A person looks beautiful when he thinks that he is beautiful. Once you will accept the fact you will not mind the comments of others. I think you must have got your answer.

I have found that when I decide to dye my hair a brownish red or auburn color works best with my skin and is very pretty. The main this is to get what you want though. Look at some samples the salon has, hold them up to your arm to see how they will go with your skin. That will give you a better idea.

Assuming on average you take 30 minute showers, then give or take 10 minutes to get clothed and clean up your mess in the bathroom. At 9:10 - 9:15ish, apply your face masque. During that 30 minutes, put your school stuff out then just chill for a bit while you wait. Around 9:45, wash off your face masque, and brush your teeth. Then get to bed.    I will also throw this out there, you don't need to use a face masque everyday.

f1bdd8f3dd409cdd71223c7d68e40664aa	I believe you're asking how to removed unwanted facial hair so I will answer accordingly.    Waxing will remove the hair from the root and is a system that needs to be repeated ever 4-6 weeks.  It is inexpensive and can be painful.  But, once you get used to the procedure it really isn't that bad.  It can be done by your estetician or even with an at home kit.  I would recommend that you at least begin with a professional so you can see the proper way to apply the wax and remove the gauze.  If it's not done properly, you could experience irritation, broken or bruised skin and ingrown hairs.   Electrolysis is another method.  It is done by using an electrified, small needle inserted into each follicle to kill the follicle and keep it from regrowing hair.  It is quite effective however can be somewhat painful and time consuming.  It is cost effective when done on small areas.  Laser hair removal is another option that works well.  Some people find it somewhat painful or irritating.  I, however do not.  I have received electrolysis treatments as well as tons of waxing and I find the laser to be less painful than elecrolysis and about equal to waxing.  It can be quite expensive and you will need multiple treatments.  But if it's a smaller area you might be OK.  I know I used to pay my laser tech only $25 each treatment to have my upper lip treated.  Whatever you do...don't shave!  It will NOT make it come back in courser or darker as people think.  The reason that our hair becomes thicker, darker and more concentrated is due to the fact that our hormones change as we age.  Think about this....How old were we all when we started to shave our legs? Probably pretty young and as we age our hormones will cause us to have more unwanted hair.  So if we NEVER started shaving our legs would it still be as sparse as it was when we were 13 or 14? No.  It would be the same as it is presently weather we shaved it or not.  That idea is all an old wive's tale.  However, shaving does make a blunt edge to the hair which will make it feel "prickely" or sharp.  It also removes the hair from the mid-shaft which is the thickest part of the hair.  Another reason why when it grows back in it will feel sharp.  The methods I mentioned above all remove the hair from it's papilla or "root". Conseqently, the follicle is forced to regenerate a new hair (Which takes about 4-6 weeks) and when it comes to the surface it is fine and soft.
66392ba825853d9ccb01cb2daf97c162aa	You can always look for shampoo for color treated hair. There is really no good way to prevent your hair from letting go of the dye. Rough shampooing can strip color or dry out hair. Since it's probably not healthy to wash your hair daily since it has been treated, you could try shampooing every other day.|`|f1bdd8f3dd409cdd71223c7d68e40664aa	Just make sure that you're using a professional system for colored hair.  The pH of many grocery store items is too high and each time you shampoo, you're opening the cuticle of the hair so that the molecules of color can escape and go down the drain!  You may also consider using  a colored shampoo to keep the color vibrant.  Paul Mitchell makes an entire line of colored shampoos as well as Artec (The original colored shampoo line!).  Aveda makes one called Black Malva which is also popular. Finally, consider a leave in conditioner with both UVA and UVB protection. Good luck!|`|1c6c0fc3e6b5dc9af4031903b2436599aa	Dove has some new shampoos and stuff for people with dark hair.  Also you can use John Friedas products for brunnetes.|`|1f364cfb261bddc93aec3cc12d682b61aa	A good answer to this question depends on whether you are doing your hair at home. I assume you are so I will help on that assumption. When you apply color as a retouch it's important not to overlap the color. Even if all your hair is faded, you apply color to new growth first and pull it thru the ends for only the last few minutes. You should probably be using semi-permanent color until your hair is healthier. It is fading because it's damaged. You may want to go to a reputable stylist to get your hair conditcioned and colored and then work on maintaining the color at home. The color care products over the counter are ok but in the salon I use Redken, Sexy Hair and Tigi color care the most with excellent results. Good luck.

It will also help to make your makeup last longer without fading.  Any professional or upscale makeup line will have one.  The one I generally use in the studio is from Smashbox but I also like Prime For the Face and Eyes from Mirabella.  Good luck!|`|1f1a01000ac84e6de88faa95b8cd9b83aa	primer goes on before the makeup to make the skin more even and to help it last longer.

f1bdd8f3dd409cdd71223c7d68e40664aa	Your boyfriend has a condition know as "Pre-mature graying".  The color in our hair is made up of several different types of melanin.  There are Pheomelanins and Eumelanins.  Pheomelanin are the red and orange pigment in hair and Eumelanins are the black and brown pigments.  When we see Grey or white hair they are devoid of melanin.  Meaning....the follicle has stopped producing them and the hair no longer has any.  This happens at different times with different people.  It has nothing to do with coloring the hair or any other silly ideas........it simply is not producing any more natural color.  If your boyfriend is self conscious I would recommend he have it colored.  I would suggest he find a stylist who is familiar with Redken Color Camo.  It is a line of hair color designed and marketed for men.  It has a very natural look.  No one will even know he's coloring his hair!    Good luck!|`|01882e7c25486ed761a4367afdcefd51aa	Probably just genetics.|`|AA11451460	Are you sure he is 22 and not lying about his age.... Just joking but not really.

They may  come in different types, for different skin type. Try what fits you.  Use about two dots slightly larger than a pea. Place them on the edge of your fingertips, and semi-gently "mask" you face with it.  Wait about 2-3 minutes, then rinse off your face.  Dry you face gently with a towel. DAB, DON'T WIPE.  Next, get about 2 pea-sized dabs of a non-oily moisturizer. Gently, in circular motions, cover your face.  NOW YOU MAY WIPE, BUT GENTLY! Wipe GENTLY off the excess lotion.  Besides ridding your face of annoying pimples, it makes you pores smaller, and you are less likely to get pimples in the future!|`|295396d275c206119c169f5b32e4a959aa	proactiv soloution or you can try acne free at walmart

They sell it at malls and online/tv. I personally think it's cheaper if you order it rather than buying it at the mall. However, don't use it too much because then you can become immune to it (I think I have). I would also recommend buying Clearasil (available at WalMart, Target, etc.). Both of these products contain Benzoil Peroxide, which can irritate your skin after frequent use, or even create a rash...it happened to me but I just started using it less frequently. They both work very well.    However, if you don't want to go out or spend more money I would recommend using toothpaste to dry out the pimples, it usually works too!

However, up close and in photos, that lace shows up pretty prominently.  In photos, it can be (and usually is) airbrushed/photoshopped out.  In "real llife," it can be a distraction.

d411a620ed6d0cd319061a1c4bdbf13eaa	Eye creams are fancy names for light moisturizers, unless they have collagen or firming ingredients. If you notice the skin around the eye is much more supple, and moist; eye creams are just light moisturizers, and therefor do not penetrate tougher skin around the face and neck in the same manner.  However, if you have sensitive skin, eye creams are ideal.|`|f1bdd8f3dd409cdd71223c7d68e40664aa	I would also like to add to Joshua's statement that most often a manufacturer's eye creams are almost identical to their moisturizers without any added fragrance as this is the ingredient that often is the most irritating to the delicate skin around the eyes.|`|AA11014669	i dont see why not MAC makes a eyecream for puffy eyes and since i dont have puffy eyes i put it on pimples and blemishes that r risen and they go straight down.|`|7d7f10be6570269f9a60e1c21de7795aaa	NO! Never, ever apply eye cream to other parts of your face. It is higher in moisturizing elements, since the skin of your eyes is more sensetive than the skin on any other part of your face. Applying this moisturize heavy cream to the rest of your face will make you break out! Be careful of some of the advice here, lol. You don't want to wake up and have lots of pimples!

b2f5cc892d9a2ff6d43172b4bb022096aa	A lot depends on your skin tone and what works with that.  Lightening hair is always trickier than going darker, so keep that in mind. If you are doing it at home, and your skin tones would work with it,  try Mahogany by Loreal,  it is a deep rich brown with just a hint of red,  My hair is very dark brown, and being in the sun made it look exactly like this color.   Brown hair and blond highlights aren't going to look natural,  be careful or you will have stripes !  If you are having a professional do the deed, they can add highlights that will look natural and they also know where to put them, so it is the most flattering to your face.  Have fun !|`|585f7ae9e483d9550d944eef0c43e7a5aa	Highlights are great! I did the same thing a year ago. When my hair was "virgin" medium brown and long  (it looked reddish and light brown in the sun) I had some caramel highlights done and it looked really nice, it made my hair look lighter and it complemented my face. Then a few months later I got blonde highlights and it looked even better! Right now I have blonde highlights all over my natural brown hair (I have not dyed the hair that doesn't have highlights) and I just cut my hair into a short bob a couple of weeks ago. I think you should go for caramel highlights if you don't want that big of a change because it's not very noticeable but it looks natural. Or, if you are ready for a noticeable change, try the blonde highlights, but do it with a professional because they know what they're doing. Good luck!|`|20fa6b921f42f74389144f38b536ec86aa	Try light brown first you don't want to shock yourself or everybody else to start off with or better yet do a few high-liights to brighten up your face but not to lite tell your hairdresser to highlight from ear to ear with a rich caremel|`|e79805887abfad5b5fbf31fe4ba07154aa	I think if it's the first time you've ever died your hair just do highlights, maybe a couple shades lighter.

c058cd8101e9c9ead9b0fc9b72f8e99caa	I have had laser hair removal on my neck and chest and it was a great solution.   The hairs have been gone for 6 years on my neck.   On my chest, I treated a really odd patch in the middle of my chest so that it would just thin that area and even out the amount of hair that I have on my entire chest.   For your dad, you can decide to get it all removed or just get the area thinned out.   I know guys who have had their backs done and they told me that theirs backs sweat less in basketball and that they get less irritated and itchy.        The treatment itself was a little uncomfortable but not that bad and it was over fairly quickly.   I also had little irritation after the procedure.      If you decide to buy a gift certificate for your dad, I have listed a link to a site where you can purchase the gift certificate.   The company, SignatureForum, works with multiple LHR providers across the country.   The gift certificate is also transferable to yourself or your mother, or if your dad decides he doesn't want LHR, the GC can be used at health clubs, spas or for other services.

A review of the various hair removal methods is available at http://tinyurl.com/ob6tt|`|f1bdd8f3dd409cdd71223c7d68e40664aa	I have had laser hair removal and I found it to be very effective and painless.  I found it to be far less painful than waxing.  It feels like a series of puffs of cold air and a quick sting like a snap of a rubber band. He may experience a slight, bumpy irritation that might pop up 2-5 hours after the treatment and last about 12-14 hours. (I only got this on certain areas like my bikini and the nape of my neck but not in my armpits or on my lip.) It would be a great idea for your dad!  Keep in mind that it does take multiple treatments, doesn't work well on gray hair and men are babies...so they think it's painful!  Someone else suggested waxing.  That is an option but  is only temporary and if not done properly can cause ingrown hairs, especially on the back

Simply use a Demi color in your natural level (Darkness) and color over it.  You may still see some of the underlying copper pigmentation but it shouldn't be too bad.|`|AA11571000	NO NO NO!    Bleached hair is not colored hair. Coloring hair adds pigment  Bleaching the hair strips the pigment out. What ever color you have left from bleaching is your natural color minus pigment.    When using a remover it is for removing color and as stated above Bleached hair is hair that has been stripped of color.    If you put a color remover on your hair you will only further damage your hair    The best suggestion I can give is to tone the Bleached hair back to your natural hair color or to a color that has an ash base tone    The ash base tone will conteract the brassiness and cool it down to a natural highlite. Try a lever 09 ash  or 10 ash for blonde highlites    or just get a color that is the same as your natural Color    OR go to a professional before your hair breaks off!
f1bdd8f3dd409cdd71223c7d68e40664aa	Yes, color depositing shampoos actually do work.  They will help to tone down unwanted tones or to intensify other tonal values.  I am not happy with the surfactants in the Artec brand of colored shampoos.  I just don't find them to be very effective at cleansing.  I would advise cleansing your hair with another shampoo first and then using the Artec shampoo.  There are other lines of coloring shampoos that I prefer.  Sexy Hair Concepts makes a great line as well as Paul Mitchell.  I find the surfactants to be more effective|`|e6d9ff348b50fa3fa11ba21d7b4040a8aa	My stylist recommends them, or Goldwell's product. I use Artec, however, I think that they are more to maintain color, not change color.  I am almost completely grey, so my color fades pretty quickly.  I find that they can leave hair dry, so I mix mine with their Kiwi sampoo. (it's the same company), and  I do not use the coloring shampo daily, only once or twice a week. Then I use the Kiwi conditioner daily.  Good luck, though, because red is usually hard to cover without permanant color.  ASk your stylist what they recommend you do.
adfeac991331306e17cef11024ec1d9faa	No, the bleaching done to get those highlights is permanent.  If you don't color your hair to cover them up, you'll have to wait until that highlighted hair grows out.|`|585f7ae9e483d9550d944eef0c43e7a5aa	I suggest you dye ONLY those strands of hair that have highlights with a color that is closest to your natural brown hair. (Of course this is probably almost impossible if you have a lot of highlights all over your hair) I know it may not seem easy, but you should just go ask a professional about that and they'll probably give you a good suggestion or maybe they can do that themselves. If not, you should buy a dye that is closest to you natural color and ask someone to help you out...but make sure to follow the instructions well. Maybe if you go to a beauty supply store (like Sally's Beauty Supply) you can ask the girls who work there what color to get and how to do it, they usually know what to do. Hope this helps.

Also before you go into the pool put conditioner on your head to protect it.  wash everytime after you go swimming.  if it by chance turns green, use a little dawn soap and shampoo combined to take out the green|`|f1bdd8f3dd409cdd71223c7d68e40664aa	First, wet your hair with clean water, then apply an ample amount of conditioner.

AA11786877	I have read in all of the fashion magazines that a bandeau top, Just a shallow tube, is supposed to make you look fuller in the bust.  Try a bottom that have ties on both sides of your hips to make them look wider and wear something that strawberry blondes look good in.  Don't wear black it will make you look that much lighter.

f1bdd8f3dd409cdd71223c7d68e40664aa	Overuse of a re-constructor if anything would make your hair feel brittle and not rubbery. It's a protein base. What you have is severely desensitized hair.....which I am sure is why you chose to live in Emergencee for however long you did! In plain English: it's damaged! Unfortunately, there is not too much you can do and to add insult to injury if you pull too hard on your hair while it's in this state, you will break it off.  That "rubbery" feel or lack of elasticity comes from the breakdown of your hair from over processing.  Just be gentle with it, try not to pull on it while it's wet ESPECIALLY, get yourself a satin pillow case to avoid friction while sleeping, get some great PROFESSIONAL products to use on your hair.  I would recommend a moisturizer for daily use and your reconstructor for once a week and not more!  Just wait it out Honey, it's just hair and it will get better!|`|549fSHxcaa	get sunsilk for damaged hair  use the shampoo & conditioner|`|78360e6b205ec3ee80e59d1cbf2113f6aa	go to the salon and ask them to fix it . it worked for me|`|895627b686fb657f82e10add6de34e0baa	try conditionong your hair and leave in condinisher works very well then blow dry it through|`|d033b45b2159db62c7ab03ffc56cf57aaa	go to the salon, they can fix any damaged hair! and also dont use that Nexxus Emergencee reconstructor anymore, everyone has different types of hair like damaged hair and all those things.

cb3c52af3e751d31beea15218b9cf940aa	You need to have a basic education in massage, first... about 500 hours is the nationwide minimum but more is required in some states like New York.    Integrative massage is not a type that I know of but more an approach to integrating more than just a massage into the wellness routine. Things like proper exercise, advanced muscle therapy, client self-care and being able to identify perpetuating factors and refer them to other health care/wellness professionals is often necessary.    Nutrition and Hydration are important aspects. Having the ability to work with clients on an individual basis and provide an integration of the whole body, not just the painful or problem areas, is what this term suggests.    Having a functional knowledge of massage, human anatomy and physiology, musculoskeletal pathology, kineseology, contraindications for massage, indications for massage and a general good sense of touch are prerequisites to getting the information you request.    Good luck!
FfNKLG7Gaa	It depends on your eye color, skin color, hair color. But the most improtant is your eyes. Do color opposites, makes your eyes pop! Something that contrasts with your eye color or hair color. If you wanna go natural, use a foundation, and nuetral eyeshadows. And a little masscara.|`|VLqEGRl7aa	You should use Covergirl foundation or use some eye-liner it might be good for the eyes|`|fa06254364bb452e788f38cd77770e6daa	You should go to a store like Ulta or Sephora, a makeup store.

YZidVwYBaa	If they used demi permanent color it will fade gradually over the next couple of weeks. That is what makes demi permanent so great, it gradually fades on tone and the regrowth is not as noticeable as permanent color. If you really feel it's too dark and don't want to wait for it to fade on it's own you can use a clarifying shampoo and it should remove some of the pigment.|`|GSbz9Zq4aa	It looks nice darker though
9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	I would get it where you want it. If it doesn't hold the same meaning for you elsewhere, it kinda defeats the point of the tattoo. She will get over it (but may make you pretty unhappy until then!)    Congrats on your three years. Here's hoping you get to put a line through the rest of the letters!|`|JafLyLYgaa	Previous answer summed it up.   Its going on your body, not hers. Its nice of her to give her opinion, but thats just it, her opinion. Clearly it has strong symbolic meaning for you, and I think it will make a great tattoo that you wont forget. Go ahead and get it. I think if you dont get it now do to peer pressure, you will regret it. My parents were vehemently against tattoos, (im the only one in the family who even has one), and they got over it very quickly after realizing that I truly had thought it through and it wasnt a spur of the moment thing. Good luck!|`|Z5sKsrBFaa	I say go for it.  That is where it will have the most effect and meaning.  Your mom will get over it.|`|XXBhA532aa	I have 3  tattoo's, that I have had for over ten years and I don't regret any of them. I wouldn't get a permanent mark on my body if it didn't mean anything to me(or if I didn't agree with what it meant).

I mean this tattoo has to have REAL meaning to you.   Not your mom.   Don't worry what others think of it.  As long as you like it it's all good.

AA11575632	Pair up a flowy top (black with some or minimal designs) with dark wash skinny jeans and heels. Pair with a small or X-Large designer (or designer looking) bag. Casual yet chick.

wXloRCegaa	In order to get green eyes to pop, you should try wearing various purple shades. The contrast in color to your eyes will make them seem more dramatic. If you want your eyes to stand out but look more natural, you may want to try warmer mocha brown shades or warm colors with slight orange undertones. Basic eyeshadow colors for green eyes would be earth tones with slight hints of gold, taupe colors, mocha browns, and lavender-purple shades. Since most green and hazel eyes has a variety of flecks, feel free to experiment with these colors so you can find the perfect one for your eyes.    Keep in mind that you should have fun with your eyeshadow and it shouldn't be a bothersome process. A general rule of thumb with eyeshadow is to first compliment your eye color and then it shouldn't contrast your clothing. In other words, don't wear a purple based eyeshadow on your blue eyes while you are wearing a coral toned shirt. You should try to keep your clothing and eyeshadow in the same or color family, or at least a complimentary family. And finally, remember that sometimes less is more. Don't add 5 layers of green eyeshadow on your brown eyes, thinking that it will make them look fabulous. Often times a slight hint of color is all your eyes need to really pop and look mesmerizing.|`|hNW7Rbe0aa	yeah, mine are like that to..  i nomally wear a smoky blue greyish color.|`|idhcqr5Daa	Try blue. Blue is a very common eyeshadow color. Blues are all about being noticed, not natural. But blue doesn't necessarily go great with every ones eye color. blue goes best with brown eyes because they are so opposite that brown eyes will pop.   Consider silver/gray. Silver/gray brings on heavy metals and drama. Silver/gray are usually used as evening shades. It looks great with blue or brown eyes.   Put on brown. Brown or bronze gives off a great natural glow when worn properly. It looks best with dark brown eyes and hazel or light brown eyes depending on the shade of brown.   Be careful with green. Green is a color that was inspired by nature. One of springs best colors, it looks wonderful with Light brown or blue eyes. It can also be very easy to overdo and make you appear like the wicked witch of the East! Be careful and sparing in adding it.   Add some purple. This was the spring of 07's signature color but it looks great in any season when done well. It looks awesome with brown or green eyes.     xoxo_LEi|`|fU8vZTyAaa	ohh mee too! wear navy, indigo, smoke grey, or gold.|`|364d7a1f957bf7c9aabbc05073bf0f58aa	That's basically all you can do to bring out the green, unless you want to wear contacts. I also have blue-green eyes and I can tell you from experience that purple is the only way to go. You might try lining them with purple eyeliner as well, but I've always used black myself.    If you wear glasses, try wearing contacts. Glasses obscure the view of your eyes, and wearing a lot of makeup actually makes the eyes look even smaller when you wear glasses.|`|45ebb5bbacc3ca429fdca620b42e84c0aa	good ?..... Smokey grey and silvers are great.. i have one blue eye and the other is green.... I also wear a lot of deep browns... people always tell me how great my eye makeup is... the trick is you gotta blend them so they look smooth.

V9V6l4kraa	Try shaving in the same direction as your hair grows instead of going against it. It's not as close a shave, but for sure you won't get any irritation or ingrown hairs.    If you want a clean shave without the irritation, use Nair or (my favorite) Veet. It lasts longer than shaving, but don't use it if you have extra sensitive skin.|`|itmO3yk2aa	this sounds weird but, putting deodorant on after you shaved really helps. haha when i heard that tip i was like ew, but i tried it and it's so simple and it works, soo i recomend it. just use a different one then the one you put everywhere else lol    |`|3e342b4c35254658976e2faf3d9365f0aa	Use electric clippers to about 1/8 of an inch, then use electric razor  of the type that men use for their face.

You might also look for a special shaver (it's a similar design to a trimmer for nose hair for people with sensitive skin).    Overall, ingrown hairs and irritation in general are nearly unavoidable if you shave the conventional way...you might want to look at the possibility of chemical or laser hair removal.|`|9zQqQUFraa	Immediately after shaving, try washing the area with an antibacterial face wash.  When you leave the shower, immediately apply body lotion to the area to trap in the moisture.  Reapply the lotion often for the next day.

zpovg4U7aa	It's because before you started flat-ironing your hair your hair had locked in more moisture, making it fuller and more luscious. Flat-ironing will always make your hair at least slightly drier.    If you want to continue straightening your hair, you should always use shampoo and conditioner that say "extra moisture" or "moisturizing." My favorite is Dove's Moisture Shampoo and Conditioner. They make my hair so thick and silky!    Also if you can help it, try & not flat-iron your hair as much. Like on nights when you stay in, try and just let your hair sit naturally. There are also sprays you can use in your hair prior to straightening your hair to lessen the damage.    It's good to air-dry your hair before straightening it. So if you are taking showers in the morning and have to blow-dry your hair before straightening it, try washing your hair at night, air-drying it all night, then waking up in the morning and straightening it before you go off to school or work or wherever you go. Air-drying will help keep more of the moisture in.|`|taNILMmsaa	stop ironing your hair|`|fyyzKKqpaa	OMG me too.  DOnt get it thinned out when you go to the hairdressers and only strighten when you reaaally want to.'|`|eJsR7BZvaa	Do you wash your hair in the mornings?

paEcdwQBaa	to color the acrylic?  the world is your palette.     to use in place of the acrylic?  um no.  the monomer (liquid) requires a polymer (acrylic powder) to create a bond, and form those pretty sculptures.    you can stick anything in acrlics... photos, magazine pieces, dried flowers, rhinestones inside, candy wrappers, glitter, colored strings, anything you can thing of. somethings will hold up against the chemicals better than others.      i would say you have a better chance with mac pigments giving you the colors you are looking for better than others since the color is so concentrated. however, you might have problems with consitency since the pigments are super fine, and hold moisture that acrylic powder doesnt. this might make a really cool effect though too... i think i'll give it a try!
zzkmdusEaa	Well it would help more if you posted a picture.    My advice to you is....    1) Quit tearing yourself down. You sound like a swell, educated person. There is a fish out there for you dude, trust me there is. You need to build up more confidence, from what I hear....Most girls like confidence :), no girl is going to want to date you if your calling yourself out all the time. Relax and just be yourself (Unless "Yourself" tears yourself down all the time). Give yourself more credit.    2) Improvement of style is always a nice change. But you don't want a girl that likes you just because of your looks, you want a girl who LIKES you for your "nerdy" self. Go for a girl that will accept you for you, I bet some of those girls you want to impress so bad aren't what they are cut out to be. For an improvement of style, start on your clothes and your hair. Post pictures up of yourself, get some advice on what you could do with your hair, for good clothes shop at The Buckle, Pacsun, Aeropostale, American Eagle...etc. etc. Billabong and Fox shirts are my personal favorites, they are nice, give them a try    3) Life wouldn't be as easy as you think it is with "good looks". Would you really trade brains for looks? Last I recalled, brains is what got you the high salary jobs nowadays, not the looks. I imagine you have a big future ahead of you, keep seaching bud, you'll find that one special someone. According to recent studies, 95% of people do! The other 5% either gave up or were pieces of slime, you aren't no piece of slime, and you definitely don't seem like a quitter since from what I hear you have posted this a LOT! (I joke)    Classic: Nobody is forcing you to read these, he may be going overboard posting these over again, let the people at Yahoo! Answers figure that out, its not like he is profiting from it, he has probably lost a lot of points trying to get this question answered. But you aren't any better by deciding to come on here and personally insult him. You are more immature than he is and if you don't like it, report him or do whatever, but don't stoop to a level lower than him.|`|hOVzviFIaa	Not true. I always think the unconventional guy is much better looking.  The other guys may be hot, but I just don't find myself attracted to them.|`|i2Ovk3V3aa	well first of all dont label yourself as a nerd.   and second, if you know that you're a nerd/dork or whatever, then do something to change it! like over the summer or something. go to stores like american eagle, pacsun, stuff like that.   and there's a lot of cool girls out there. dont just go for the fake plastic barbie dolls. they're not worth your time.|`|PQzDFcMOaa	I personally don't date guys for their looks because looks fade and personality doesnt.  if u r genuine and real with the girl and you can make her laugh then you will have no problem.   be yourself and dont try to imitate anyone else and i promise you it will work out in the end.|`|hj4Hke9eaa	Awwww! honey please! I am a "cool girl" and honestly, all you need to do is get some self confidence...just walk up to the girl you like, and ask her out! she would be so flattered, i am sure she will say yes...but you gotta believe in your self okay?  And BTW "classic girl" get a life! you don't have to be such a jerk, the stupidest way to bully someone is to do it online, where nobody can see you and its totally anonymous, got it?|`|sg0m6LBRaa	post a picture on here and we willl help you improve.  your such a pathetic SOB.    im not bullying you. why dont u take my advice and stop being so freakin insecure?  pathetic SOBs are such a turnoff.|`|99Ejw6Pvaa	Maybe if you stopped caring about getting a "cool girl" then maybe some girl might like you!|`|VegwUJiCaa	are you alright?|`|DmPDt4aDaa	youve asked like 10 of these. and maybe it has something to do with your pessemistic attitude. be confident and try different styles? post a picture so we can help more.|`|nbWO3IANaa	1] a 'real' nerd wouldn't know he/she was a nerd  2] or wouldn't care!  3] make models are frequently as dumb as posts - not the quality most of us look for!  4] Fixes:  a] get a decent haircut,   b] remove any unibrow,  c] good skin care regimen so face is clear  d] fix any teeth problems  e] keep nails and toenails trimmed, filed, clean  e] diet to lose weight, or lift weights to gain  f] wear clothes that look good - no baggy, skin tight, or visible underwear

May end up pushing bacteria further up and causing infection. If  you are worried about odor, wear cotton undies, use soap and water when showering or bathing.  Dry . Bad smells-fishy usually mean std or infection. They say vinegar and water , bought in bottle is best, however many used to usse the failed method for birth control. Not a good idea

I think if u wanna wear foundation just a little. Wear pink blush that shows up but not too much. Light blue eyeshadow will accentuate your blue eyes and a lil sparkle and shine on your eyes will look hot with your top! For lipstick I'd say go for pink.. it would look cute with your fair skin and put extra gloss!! Have fun, you're gonna look great!|`|u2LevwWAaa	OK! u can never ever go wrong with these:    1.eyeshadow=white=take the shadow wand and take it across the upper lid only+never ever take it above the width of the wand-gives you a glamorous look without going over board+if you want to really SHINE get some sparkle eyeshadow with some white to give you a superstar shine  2.blush=peach=gives your cheeks a full look  3.lipgloss=wear a clear coat-this gives you a glossy shine and shows off your real lip color+never wear lipstick, makes you look like a Barbie      Hope this helped!!!!!    Luv Ya,  Lovely Angel
AA11978164	Why do women feel so pressured to shave their bits? Why were we given the hair if we have to get rid of it?

O7KR3tgjaa	I'm assuming that little black dresses and kitten heels would not interest you since you're a guy, so I'd say dark wash jeans, leather cuffs, tailored jackets, Converse chucks, and worn-in colored tees.

OYYL5Awjaa	Your worry is perhaps your enemy besides your 'experimenting'. The damage caused by both these factors is not as simple as you may think. A wrong treatment course may have caused more damage than treating. And being worrisome makes it worse all the time    Time period for any hair treatment would vary from person to person, depending on the severity of the case.    If anybody has promised that you would get results within 15 days, it has to be taken with a pinch of salt ! Six month old hairloss cannot be stopped in just 15 days. Don't switch products. Stick to one particular course of treatment. If segals products don't help, do you have any other better alternatives? Use it, use it and continue to use it.|`|b6e3ec0b5c8a0f30a22e16bc4bbf50fbaa	It does happen with so many factors that contribute. My mom got relief with Segals almost instantly. in my case, it has yet to show big results even after two and a half months. Dandruff is gone but the hairloss is still there. Perhaps result vary from person to person. But that's the only hope in the market ! I continue to use it religiously - the Advanced one

QENL1JgSaa	If you want to be completely clear overnight, use calamine lotion. This product works great for me. Make sure your face is nice and clean and that your hands are clean, too. Right before you go to bed, moisten a cotton ball with about 15 drops of calamine lotion (make sure you shake the bottle well), and sweep it all over your face. This may cause your skin to be dry, but it is worth it for clear skin. I use HUMCO Calamine Lotion from Wal-Mart. This product costs less than $2.00.

AA11517757	14ct white gold means that the ring is white gold. Back over ten years ago the yellow gold (natural color of gold) was mixed with zinc to change the color to white. Many people had reactions to the zinc so jewelers changed this to a coating. You can take your ring to a jeweler and have them re coat the ring. It is like the copper coating on the zinc pennies in your pocket. My wife had the same problem with cheaper rings. When I purchased a more expensive engagement ring it stopped for a long time and started to happen again. I have it re-coated about every year now.|`|d65a535f07c7b574b9c272c000e8c60caa	After a while white gold tends to turn yellow. The higher the carrat the quicker it'll turn. All White gold is is yellow gold with overlay.|`|AA10093245	Mine does the same thing, I had my wedding and engagement rings welded together at the bottom so they don't twist funny, and the stones stay where they are supposed to instead of cockeyed...  they are both white gold, and turning slightly yellowish on the underside (after 7 years) and I just figured it was either the stuff they welded them together with, or that my hands must have some slightly acid perspiration?|`|AA10726741	It is possible that when they repaird the ring they did not use the same type of gold. A jeweler I knew said that white gold was just yellow gold colored white and that overtime it could fade to look more yellow. So that is a possibility too|`|73037dd2ccdab9a02d20a2c1f356ccb1aa	White gold is made by putting a layer of I believe, rodien, on top of regular yellow gold.  Normal wear and tear when wear the layer away leaving the yellow gold to show through...this could have happened faster because of the resizing.  Take it back to the jewelry store and have them replate it.|`|060a30807a2473725be8dc35ce69f993aa	White gold is created by combining different metals together to get the white color.  Same thing happened to my ring.  You can take it back to the jeweler and they will send it to be dipped, and it will come back beautiful, believe me, mine looks very good now.|`|mZSkcgHUaa	My brother is a silversmith and works with gold and silver.    Most Jewellers send their repairs away for fixing (like they do with my brother).    No matter whether or not the ring was sized larger or smaller, they normally put a wee bit more gold/silver on the band to join it together.    Did they use the same carat colour/weight.|`|SgZXGdS7aa	You have a chemical imbalance that tarnishes certain metals.|`|AA11844768	It has to do with the ring being sized. I had mine sized and the spot where they removed a little bit of the gold and mended the two sides back together it is a little yellow. It shouldnt be too yellow if it gets worse i would take it back. Hopefully you had it sized at the same jeweler you got it from.

I like mittens when they are called for and glove when they are called for. If you do not require the dexterity of your fingers mitten are preferable, because they provide more insulation to your hands.  It is a good idea to wear a thin pair of gloves inside your mittens ,in the event you are required to remove your hands from you mittens.

hCdCxaVcaa	Yes, they do get very short hairs. Pretty much, if you can see it, the epilator can pluck it. They hurt like hell, though.    I use a Philips Satin Ice epilator with a built-in cooling pack. This helps a bit with the pain. As far as features go, I think the ice is good but not amazing. I would probably pay 50 rather than, say, 40 for it if it had a cooling pack. You'd probably do just as well to wrap some ice in a towel and cool your legs yourself before you start.    Some of them have massagers now instead of ice packs to help with the pain. I don't know how good these are, I'm afraid. There might be some reviews on Amazon.    Other than the ice pack, I've never really found that special features are worth paying for. Many epilators now come with built-in lights and plucking heads of different widths; I don't think these are any use at all.    Expect an epilator to last for 3-5 years if you use it once every month or so.|`|A7zSIRI1aa	I think they are great, no mess no fuss, but you have to get use to the pain. Try to use in a warm room so your pores are open.  Mine cost 60.00|`|8a9431af57afff6d9c1ec5cec5489376aa	Check amazon.com for epilator, look at there reviews.

Look for one that has some gathers to give the appearance of fullness and presence.  Girls who are big on top can't really wear this style well, but it looks fantastic on smaller chests.

But I found that no matter how well I exfoliated and shaved, or how careful I was putting it on I still ended up with streaks and orange splotches.  Maybe I'm just too pale for any color.    I would suggest getting a professional spray tan.  Good luck.|`|Z0dXXQKhaa	Yes...it's good if you just want a nice, natural tan. It takes FOREVER to give you colour though, but some people like the whole gradual thing.    I prefer getting a professional spray tan or getting a real tan. :)    *Oh and the reason I like professional spray tans is because they have a specialist that helps you select the right colour...I usually do the lightest one they have...so it just gives me a bit of a bronze glow but nothing fake at all.|`|DfWiIXRtaa	yes it brings out the natural color but adds smoothness.

You can have a great new cut, some streaks or a whole new colour, and a professional hairstyle for prom, looking shockingly gorgeous of course.    ~If despite the odds you hate it, or are wary to risk it, try just a new cut or just a new colour? Or have it professionally styled, up with curls, down sweeped classically to the side, or soft waves would look wonderful...

Ambos te quedarian bien, te envidio por atreverte con un look tan atrevido! el naranja o rojo te daria un aspecto absolutamente calido y, aplicando el maquillaje oprtuno o con tu tono de piel visto, quedaria muy bien, por otro lado, los colores azul y morado se llevan este a?o mas que los 2 anteriores, mucho mas, y quedarian muy bien si son muy oscuros, que queden casi ****** y brillantes, de modo que si a estos cabellos se les complementa con alguna crema para mantener el color ( ya que al ser clores inusuales, los tines no se adhieren tan bien al cabello y podria perdese el color ) y dar brillo y el vestuario y complementos adecuados quedar pracioso.  Otra opcin sera usar un tinte ( como por ejemplo color pulse ) que a los 8 / 10 lavados desaparece, y asi podras probar ambos tonos sin riesgo a que no haya vuelta atras.

4da51cc59832c68b4beeb806c391cb72aa	Sorry hon...You can't make your hair grow back overnight. What you can do, is work with what you have got! A really cute hairstyle for short hair is the little twisties in the front. The size of each twisty depends on how many you want. Take that amount of hair from the front of your hair...including your bangs. twist it, you can even grab the hair behind if you want...put a mini rubberband around it and do the next. You could even scrunch the hair hanging down if you want. I curl my daughters when she wants it like this. gl;)|`|P0EAzyw8aa	The only thing to do with a hair disaster is to have it re cut into a different style if you don't like the one you have and perhaps colour it.Hair grows about 1 centimetre a month.|`|FfNKLG7Gaa	That's true.

d5065693519b5b048f87de49a76bf961aa	This is a safe, natural treatment that has helped many on Answers. Use any oil - olive works well. Place hands together as if praying with both index fingers on lines.Then whilst pressing on lines move fingers/hands up and down - move one hand goes up as  the other comes down.  Do quite fast. The rubbing friction rubs them away. For fastest results do for about three minutes 2 or 3 times a day. It really works!

Will you be celebrating at night or day?    Anyways...I think you should try and find a nice little black dress that can translate nicely between day and evening. I don't know what you will be doing to honor your birthday, but I suggest wedges or flats instead of heels, especially if you will be on your feet a lot. Wear simple jewelry. Be comfortable! Do your makeup and hair nice, but not overdone.    I think black is a good color because it is very basic and easy to match, and is sophisticated but can be edgy too which is all good for your age!    Have fun!    I guess I could help more if you told me like what time and what you were doing etc|`|48de70cee2f6b54ff721ad64702401caaa	one that is confortable on you and wear your favourite colour to show more of your character on your bday.|`|6FXJrVjqaa	prob would help if you stopped talking like a dumbass *****|`|100ZUVzfaa	Try a cocktail or Sun dress.

bjguq3Yuaa	I am a hairstylist and have dyed my hair black a few times. It looks nice and shiny and doesnt drown out your facial tone if your skin isnt too light. The real problem is changing it! Its a pain in the butt and your hair will never be the same unless you let it grown out (Let me tell you how much fun that is). Color strippers are so damaging ive seen peoples hair just turn into a gum and break off. It is not worth it at all, i would go with a dark brown not black.|`|rmQKOcp5aa	if you are gonna dye your hair black you better do it at a salon because the box dyes are the cheapest and they have alot of ammonia. If you are thinking of dying Jet black remember that its not gonna have that natural look anymore its gonna look fake, I am telling you by experience i used to have it black and then i started dyeing it alot and by the time i wanted to go back to my natural color i dyed it and it looked fake and thick... I suggest you dye it dark brown. Once you dye it black out of a Box dye its one of the worst things you could ever do especially if you would wanna go lighter later, you would have to bleach it and basically that would ruin your hair... Go for the dark brown at least just to even out the color you have on....|`|HnTpvVEEaa	I suggest dark ash brown. it looks like a natural black. if you dye your hair black it will be really shiny and fake even if it is your natural color. good luck=)|`|CKpPpK0saa	if you want to. but i need a pic.    whatever you want i guess. its your body|`|BhYwYzuDaa	Absolutly No!    If you end up wanting to go blonde or lighter it will fry your hair trying to get the black out!|`|Y3Mxrh2uaa	I think people look best with their natural color but thats just my opinion|`|NiFjl37haa	some people do and some people don't.    for example my mom gets highlights because it is naturally just brown.  but me on the other hand i have dark blonde hair with natural highlights running through my hair.  it all depends on you.|`|AA12142423	yes because that is how you were born.
zpovg4U7aa	Aveeno has these ultra-calming cleanser and lotion that evens out your skin. My cousin uses it and I can definitely tell the difference. They sell them at most drugstores; easy to find.    That should soothe your face and tone down the redness.|`|pqyLfCNVaa	i think you might have rosacea.    to learn more about it, go here : http://www.rosacea.org/index.php|`|caQuTMDmaa	yeah i agree, you might have rosacea - the most effective thing you can do about your redness is to go and see the dermatologist and figure out what exactly is the root of your skin woes. I know that going there will be tedius and expensive, but believe me, it will save a lot of time and money and energy to go to a professional then to figure it out on your own through trial and error. From there, she can prescribe cleansers that can sooth and calm your skin and decrease inflammation :)|`|fU8vZTyAaa	foundation  proactiv  wash with water and dermatoligist-reccomended cleanser  it works really i have the same problem in the morning, then i do this stuff.. then i all pretty eee :] haha|`|zzPOffFtaa	Talk to your doctor and he/she should be able to give you something that will stop whatever reason its always red.

364d7a1f957bf7c9aabbc05073bf0f58aa	Easy. Line your eyes in the cat-eye fashion: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TsppdPzX... Ignore the bit about the 'caramel eyeshadow' because you'll be using black eyeshadow later on. When you do your bottom lids, use your finger after you line them to push up the line so it's not to thick. It is important to use regular eyeliner instead of liquid because liquid does not forgive mistakes, and will not budge as easy. Remember to make it a little thicker towards the part of your eye towards your nose, and get that little triangle bit she has on the outside.    Next, put sparkley-black eyeshadow on your lids, and just above them, with a little more on the tops toward the cat-eye.    Do not put on blush or bronzer, and use a very light pink lip gloss to finish the look.|`|Y3Mxrh2uaa	first you should put on black eyeshadow until just above your creases. then put on eyeliner on the bottom. next put liquid eyeliner on the top and wing it out about a forth of an inch. then use the liquid liner to line near your tear ducts and wing it out about an eigth of an inch|`|pqyLfCNVaa	smoky black on your lids first, and then i guess use liquid eyeliner to create a cat's eye sort of look. then black pencil liner on the bottom lid  and mascara to finish up.    it might take some practice..    oh and make sure to smudge the black eyeshadow just right|`|AJ38Xqyeaa	COPY IT|`|D3zmTOKQaa	use some regular black pencil eyeliner and line your upper and bottom lids. then put some really dark eyshadow. use black liquid liner on tops and bottoms. make sure to extend the lines a little past the corner of your eyes to create a cat eye shape. then put 2 coats of black mascara.|`|04rQEJQfaa	Its really easy i usually do it when i go out, but not to school lol. Its called cat eyes. First curl your eyelashes, and apply as much black mascara as possible. Then (this is how I do it) take a eye liner pencil and do the bottom part of your eye. The take a liquid black eye liner and do the top of your eyelid. Get some black liquid shadow(they have good ones at Victoria's secret for like $7) and cover your entire eye lid. Go back with the pencil and point it in the outer corner of your eye. bring it even further back just a little bit to make your eyes seem like longer narrowisher i guess, and then come back moving to the inward corner of your eye like you would be applying it normally just a tiny bit lower down. Then fill in the lines if there is any. Then take the liquid liner and to the same thing to the top of the eye except higher up (obviously) and bring it into the top inner corner of the eye a tiny bit heigher from here you started. This should leave a little triangle of space where you should fill in with black. Hope i helped sry if i got confusing.|`|CKpPpK0saa	ew. its ugly|`|fJjgFWDRaa	Hold your eyeliner in your dominant hand and throw it out of the window.    Ta-da!

bjguq3Yuaa	I dont know what the others person site says. But in my professional experience, i would not use this product before you straighten. It is oil based and will most likely singe your hair if used alot. Use it after straighten to polish and get rid of fly aways and frizzies. Nothing honestly helps split ends but a good old fashion quarter of an inch trim every 4-6 weeks.|`|22479221292188a6607f3f3cc2c2b5a1aa	Most serums and treatment should be applied AFTER straightening because then you will just be burning the serum, and it won't work. Also it may damage your hair. Read the back label they should explain how to use it.     But in general you should straighten your hair then take a few drops on your palm and just rub it through your hair gently. Do not use a lot because the it will give a greasy look.    As for split ends...nothing really cures split ends. Because the ends are dried out, damaged and only solution is to get a haircut or at least a trim...

Come on people at least pretend you don't base your social life on stereotypes!!!    I don't see any reason why a guy can't wear concealer to cover a zit. Makeup was not "made" for women exclusively... skin is skin. If a guy cares enough about his appearance to try to hide skin imperfections that is fine with me.     Even if he wants to wear eyeliner and lipstick, who cares?! It is his body, not mine and it is not my place to judge.    (p.s. what is with all these "as long as it isn't noticeable" answers. That seems like a huge double standard. I don't even think I can count how many women I see on a daily basis that have the dreaded "line" around their chin of where their too-tan makeup ends and their face begins)|`|o4qL1wiKaa	well, i think it's just kind of weird.. like makeup is made for girls. but if that's your style then go for it!|`|aU5vUcWLaa	/ron burgandy voice: what? in english please.|`|bM3nTH5Faa	i think its gay. totally not cute.    if i wanted a chick, id date a chick.    nextt the guy is gonna start wearing my panties.  i think not.|`|AqgJyMn6aa	guys that put make up on are gay|`|hV6h60Liaa	No I don't think men should wear any kind of make up.

Guys would like to hide blemishes (or whatever it is) too! The only thing you have to worry about is that if you can see that you are wearing makeup, I'm sure you'll have to deal with comments. But if you do it well enough that it's not too noticable then GREAT! I have always wondered if guys wished they could cover up blemishes or marks like women do. IT DOES NOT MAKE YOU GAY. That's just ridiculous. If you are talking about eyeliner and lipstick...well then that's a different story. STILL does not make you guy.|`|RKC36n9Naa	i would think that guy is gay. makeup has always and will always be a feminine thing, sorry.|`|FV0BoSkTaa	Theres a guy at my school who wears guyliner. lol    I don't really care.

2oN7WrVKaa	Yeah, I have that problem too.  I went to a professional hair salon and dyed the back, bangs, and sides of my hair dark brown and it faded in like a week.  150 bucks down the toliet.  For some reason blonde hair doesnt take too well.|`|04rQEJQfaa	try not to be so negative lol. Golden brown is close enough to medium blonde for it to look exaclty the same. You probably just have to leave the dye in longer. My hair is maadd stubborn and when i die my hair i have to leave the die in by taking the time the box says to leave it in and adding 20 or 30 minutes for it to even work. Some people have like that it sux you just have to be more patient. I've learned that if im buying hair dye i should also buy a magazine too lol. The best brand i'v noticed for hair dyes is anything by clairol (thats mostly because there conditioner smells amazing though lol)|`|bjguq3Yuaa	You need to buy a filler.

It could be either organza, which has good drape, slight stiffness and sticks out from the under-dress; chiffon, which is softer and has a nicer drape; or tulle netting, which can be very stiff and can look a bit cheap up close.  If I were making this dress for her I would choose organza, it looks the best, comes in the most colours and and is easy to find at all special occasion fabric shops.  And it's not too expensive.|`|AA10993798	not ssure what its called.  but i hav a dress with that material and its pretty comfortable and sturdy.  tell ur friend thats a cute dress!

If I was gonna buy the same products, I would chose a different belt though.     Good job :) Too bad I need money :(|`|lkkUh6eeaa	It's nice but too many accesories,you only want 1 or 2 at the most. It's just to make an outfit better not to take over the outfit.Also, i agree with one of the answerers the lipgloss is a little too strong, maybe a peach or pink. Hope I helped! :)|`|AA10993798	thast cute!  i love the shirt!  the lip gloss/lipstick doesnt really go with it, but its still cute!|`|RKC36n9Naa	ok first of all i love emerald green!!!! its a nice dress i think, but you have one two many accessories. i would say no to the flower. i would also chose a more trendy shoe something like this:     http://i3.iofferphoto.com/img/item/749/3...|`|YjkXyHBuaa	i like it. :]  not bad.|`|13mp3Z8Laa	When I say the following, I mean no harm or rudeness or anything of the sort:  Nonononono! It looks waaay too forever 21-ish. I could walk outside and see a million different girls wearing the exact same thing. You need to find something that defines who you are and what you stand for. I use clothing for expression and fun and identity and you need something that identifies you. So let's say that someone could look in your closet and finds hat. They would think either: 1) this doesn't tell me anything about her or 2) cookie cutter girl just like everyone else. Now if instead they found a bunch of iconic, defining pieces, they would know right away whether or not they would want to be friends with u/ go out with you/ etc. Let your clothes define who you are. Then, you can ask if it's cute because what matter most is what you think of your outfit and how YOU feel in it. As they say, confidence makes the girl. Good luck!! :-)))|`|pXTUMTdEaa	i think i would add another pop of color, maybe something yellow, but its really cute anyways :)
OcCgUsmLaa	I agree with Kim, theres nothing wrong with it. I love mine and I think girls with them are sexy as hell. Actually piercings seem to work better on girls with smaller boobs. I've seen some on some very large boobs and some on small and the small ones looks so much sexier.     And Kim is also right. You will not want to put a shirt on because you can't stop looking at them.

My nipples arent real small, I guess average sized.. But I love having them pierced, I think its sexy! Mine hurt like a mofo though, yours may or may not.. I also have a  friend whos boobs are even smaller than mine and she has hers done, I think they look good..

You won't know if they will work out for you yet, and it's a painful process too. I recommend getting some bras that have a little bit more padding or something along those lines. Unless you really want the nipple rings for your own favor, then go ahead :)|`|ADWIWx5Baa	Wow..why the hell would you want to get your nipple pierced..?   Nobody should see that..and seriously that sounds hella painful.|`|5wAk1Ctkaa	nipple piercings are so gross :( they look cheezy|`|PqOThwVIaa	no|`|d6Y7zg0caa	just because you have small boobs doesn't mean you can't pull it off..... just don't use huge rings......|`|hV6h60Liaa	Ew no.

I generally think it's a contradiction to pierce delicate and sensitive body parts ;o) So, I guess I'm not the best adviser. But provided one does like piercings then I don't see why it should be any different with small breasts/nipples. They are often the most beautiful anyways ;o) With or (to me) preferably without...    At least don't do t because you think your breasts are not "sweet and interesting" in themselves, okay?
OUrLopT6aa	use any good brand available in your country (ask any store manager to help you with this)...  then, let the straightener heat up for few minutes, then take a comb or brush (choose what suites you best and can hold your hair for few seconds. i think a comb would be better for your hair) and take one section of hair at a time and starting from the roots go till the end with the straightener and comb together (hold the straightener just above the comb).|`|hj4Hke9eaa	hold a straightening iron at your roots, and s-l-o-w-l-y, move down towards your tips 1 section at a time.

7db15117ce6c1672da442e743f9a214daa	Orange.    Your hair won't go white if you're going from darkbrown/black hair.  You'll end up with an orange/yellow color.    To reduce damage, you should leave the bleach in until the darkness is gone and you've got this orange tone happening.  I've dyed my hair a lot and every color.  The red dye will go over orange.      Keep checking on your hair.  After a bad bleaching experience, my hair turned to little elastics - you could pull on the hair and it would stretch then snap.  A lot of conditioner and a trim fixed it...it wasn't epic, but just damaged.  So pull on a strand of hair periodically and make sure this isn't happening to you.|`|2m0XB5s9aa	make sure to bleach your eyeballs also it hurts a little but the effect is wicked, also gets you out of work/school....just run in and scream pink eye....works every time...also to get a vibrant red you need a yellow tinted hair and it will fade quickly so have lots and re-apply every few weeks
luwTb77Waa	I don't believe they have clip ons at hot topic...      If you get them and don't want them anymore then you can just take them out..people here with fake piercings are more known as posers.      I'd recommend just getting them pierced =]|`|ZIq2IzOmaa	You can use the seamless hoops at Hot Topic to make fake lip rings. Just open the ring  to make room for it to fit around your lip and tada!    You can also use a regular captive bead ring (the hoop with one bead that snaps in). Just take the bead out, widen the gap in the hoop and then it should slip right over your lip.

4vqzkIr4aa	First SkinCandy is crap, especially the reds and oranges. When using these colors I suggest Natural or DMC. Also, you most likely did not pack the ink in properly. Specially attempting to use a round needle grouping for color packing. You should use a Mag for that scope of work but DO NOT USE A MAG until you KNOW how to use one. You can REALLY meat up the skin using a mag grouping if you don't know how to use it.    Second, if you insist on doing this at home get you some practice skins and practice. You need to work on your lining quite a bit. You appear to not be holding the machine at the proper angle and not keeping it at the correct depth or your machine is just not tuned properly.    Shiny is just the scabbing, it is suppose to do this then be followed by a thicker more familiar scabbing.|`|8THz1sp9aa	Please become an apprentice before you tattoo without knowing anything about the procedure.

7eWHunfOaa	L'Oreal is very popular international make-up brand, easily available in any big malls. Oriflame also equally good, available through the consultants. (You can check the website to know about the consultants in your country) These 2 brands are very safe to use too.    Before applying make up, you need to prepare the skin by cleansing, toning and moisturizing. For this you need a face wash, toner and moisturizer suitable for your skin type.   Then use a conceler only those parts where you want to cover the imperfections and color differences like near the nose, under the eyes.   Now you can apply a foundation all over the face. Both foundation and conceler should match your skin color.   For eyes, you need eyeliner, kohl, mascara and eye shadow. For lips, a good lip balm to soften them, then lip liner and lipstick.   To do the touch up, you need a compact or loose powder, matching your color tone.   Use blush if you like. You should blend blush, conceler and foundation very well.   These are the essential make up items.  If you have a very fair skin, you can use bronzers on forehead, nose and cheek to get the tanned effect.   Use a very good make up remover to remove the make up.|`|DI3GBpk9aa	Pancake, concealer, compact powder, eye-shadow, eye-liner, mascara, lip-liner, lipstick, lip-gloss, rouge, silver and gold glitter.

Don't cheap out on Mary Kay and Target brands and stuff because if your wife really likes makeup, she'll think you're a bit stingy.  You could try MAC brands, they're in the more expensive price range but they really are worth it.  www.maccosmetics.com  If you go on the site, you should be able to find your nearest store and from my experience, the ladies there should be more than happy to help you choose things.  Maybe even bring in a photo to show them her basic foundation colour, makeup that might match her skin type, etc.     Good luck :)|`|XsltNESNaa	Bridal make up should complement your skin - if you are fair, then use darker eye shadows and lipsticks.If you are dusky, use slightly lighter colours. Match the make up to your saree or ghaghra.  Always buy branded make up products as they will affect your skin otherwise. Don't use products that are old. Brands like Revlon, Maybelline, L'Oreal, Lakme are all good. They are available in shops like Health and Glow, Lifestyle, Shopper Stop,etc.|`|VR99H5d9aa	you can go to CoastalScents.com they hae beautiful eyeshadows!

AA11355910	if they have a tattoo with lead in the ink, I'd be more worried about plumbism (lead poisoning) than an MRI- however there is a rumor about MRI's affecting tattoos due to iron in the ink- if you have cable keep an eye on Mythbusters- they did an experiment on this subject and found absolutely no such effect, and a quick websearch shows a number of sites that list this one as an urban legend- and my wife has a tattoo, has had MRI's, and never had any problems as a result.|`|015fc5510c37d1087d553c86f0cb9248aa	i watched a show called myth busters they proved it wrong|`|8b9e90ce4a42d79b5ff39625c93384ccaa	yes but thay have special bandages for it just ask 4 it.|`|5fde0d02906d862c2b2d8a8807d37cceaa	It's a myth - they proved it on mythbusters|`|AA10035436	Some inks used over 20 years ago contained metal fragments in the pigment, but none of the inks used in the past 20 years have this in them since the industry has been regulated.|`|AA11425570	I could find the episode in a quick look thru, but it should be on there.

Metals in tattoos can react to the magnet in the MRI and could potentially cause a skin burn, or distort the images from the scan.    You need to let the technician know about any tattoos you have.    Below are the medical journal articles regarding this.|`|df686634b053b88e0888b68d185c32f0aa	Didn't you see that Mythbusters episode?

Best of luck!|`|egLhVY35aa	the "poof"   ummm  bangs- side and longer  i like braids and pony tails  but im more "preepy"
2UlLayugaa	It fades them and after a while of use some become unoticable i have them on my arms and there practically faded now. I've tried other creams but this one was by far the best|`|k1bR1BHiaa	Ive tried it and it faded mine away but not completely. I mean but Im still using it so who knows. :)|`|SajnnqK8aa	I have never heard of that. I heard Cocoa Butter works though. But to be honest I don't think any of that really works other than plastic surgery maybe. Check on new mother type sites because I know a lot of women try to treat theirs after a pregnancy|`|XVVkrlnTaa	The one that worked for me is "palmers cocoa butter". Put it on in the morning and in the evening. I don't think there is a 100% cure for stretch marks but that sure does help fading them!!!
EMcwjhZ4aa	NYX products has some hits and of course some misses. The eyeshadow does last long when correctly applied. The liners are good for the price as well. MAC is cool, but for foundation you should try Bobbi Brown, Chanel, and Nars. If you're looking for great quality at a good price try: Loreal Hip- they have the best eyeshadow! Wet and Wild has lip glosses that can't be beat for the price as well.|`|N5qx5NUvaa	I have some of the lipglosses and jumbo eye pencils. I love using the jumbo eye shadows as a base or even alone. On me, they don't crease or fade, but I usually apply MAC's prep and prime under it. The jumbo eye pencils are extremely pigmented compared to the MAC shadesticks. I will never buy another one again. The lipglosses are quite sticky. I have to dab it on once or twice, on top of some lipstick or chapstick. I have never tried any of the skincare products or lipsticks.|`|k1bR1BHiaa	I love MAC but I also own a couple of NYX products as well but lipgloss only. I love the colors but nothing to me beats MAC.|`|WYp4oDRnaa	MAC lasts so much longer. NYX has nice colors but they dont last that long.|`|Cu0fPcdnaa	doesn't work trust me poor quality and the lip gloss dry out your lips so bad that you need to wash it off, and the eyeshadow are so chalky that look so bad, I prefer mac .|`|hkJQGCHuaa	it depends what NYX products you are using. I've read tons of reviews that the eyeshadow singles are great, but i hate them. they are chalky and not very pigmented.   The NYX ultra pearl pigments however are great. they are much more fine than MAC pigments, but have a great color payoff. you have to use an eyeshadow base though. like urban decay primer potion or i've found that benefit lemon-aid works just as good. they will stay on all day with a base. they are very pigmented and blend easily.  if you are looking for a cheaper alternative to MAC you should try some of the Loreal HiP duos. they are almost always buy one get one free or half off at cvs & rite aid, and they work great.|`|MuqtW7zHaa	they work and look good for about an hour then it just turn to be a horrible smeared mess, and there liquid foundation is nothing but oil which is no good for your skin the powder stuff makes it look cakey and the eye shawdow creases in your eye lids. it is really not that great. it's cheap but go for MAC it is so worth the money.|`|uReFjOONaa	MAC is the best, but I hope for you this link works   " rel="nofollow">http://www.nyxcosmetics.com/Main_Pages/P...

So, every second is 11:11 or 10:10  Be positive, hope for the good, accept things in case its not as you desire.. don't get it on your shoulders...just carry on..and continue to wish whenever you feel so instead of waiting for any particular time..|`|QD9PqnJ1aa	I came to know about this now. Will start making a wish from today. And about the touch hood thing....yes i follow that, and do believe it.
ezoKuZLgaa	It's not, it's just a few uptight women freaking out over the changing of beauty. I personally think that it's better to put a medium line on top and a very thin line on bottom. Anymore and yes, it comes off as trashy.|`|e880bf3780c6ebc1868c580fec232f00aa	its not  i always do it|`|3cwY3Lcpaa	I dont think its trashy unless you over do it (huge black eyes). I had a look at your pics, i do my eyeliner the same as you, do you use liquid eyeliner aswell?  I absoluetly love liquid eyeliner.|`|VYWaL2graa	Huh, that's a new one to me. I find it rather attractive.|`|wSMYGzrQaa	I don't think thats trashy... I think it looks worse to wear a big line outside... its more noticeable.
armKGz9zaa	youd look perfect you have a heart shaped head and your pretty enoght that it wont make you look bad cute baby by the way|`|jWmnSXlLaa	Your very pretty. You look like you could be a young model. I like your second pic without bangs and curly hair.|`|3cCunajcaa	its heart shaped|`|AA11199456	It looks oval which means you can pretty much pull off anything. :) Side-swept bangs usually look nice on all face shapes though, in my opinion.|`|CTqddAdYaa	you should get some side bangs but make them short side bangs|`|rQH2J6euaa	its a little hard to tell bc your face is turned in the pics, but as far as i can see it looks like you have an oval face shape, which is the 'perfect' face shape.  you can basically wear any kind of hair style and it wont make your face look weird.  i have an oval shape too and just cut in my bangs a month ago, i love it!

But if you don't care about that..    I can't see if you have red freckles, but if you do then don't dye your hair blonde.|`|Ur5MffQOaa	well sure to me looks like a good idea|`|pxLV3Tppaa	Red|`|p8rxpA98aa	Looks likke u both r already blonde!|`|RvVvaVsAaa	she should go red. because you cant deposit color to make red hair blonde.. you have to lift it. in simple terms, youd have to get highlights or bleach the hair. and it wouldnt be "temporary". the blonde adding red is SO much easier then the redhead going blonde.|`|6b983aa6ec6bd64652b8c462c9959058aa	This is a tough one. Putting red dye in her hair, even if it temporary isn't a good idea. Red is a really hard color to get out of hair, especially her being a blonde... it'll fade to orange.  You have beautiful red hair! I wouldn't let any dye touch it!    Wig?|`|ZZJKTV8laa	i think youd look cute as a brunette!|`|Klb66zADaa	she should go blonde|`|Ppz64oxQaa	You are blonde.  ?|`|duZeLslxaa	If it's not permanent i think it would look much better if she went red.    it would be hard to find a temporary color for you to go blonde.

nml1djFKaa	I don't know about lipstick...I've been trying tons to see if they actually last long, but none of them really stand up to the test.  I use a lip stain I got at The Body Shop, it's a store similar to Bath & Body Works, just a little more upscale.  But yeah, test out some lipstains.  They don't rub off on napkins, your clothes, or your coffee cup.  Good luck!|`|0TBUPk0zaa	before you put on lipstick try dusting loose powder first on your lips..it helps.|`|AA11694145	almay  i dont know how long it lastes but it is the best stuff on earth  you can buy it pretty much every where|`|CkNwLXLeaa	i've heard that revlon colorstay lipstick stays on a long time
6zXpA0PNaa	I do this everyday because my eyes are little close-set.    I apply concealer on the sides of the bridge of my nose and a little in the inside corner and blend. I also make sure to get rid of ANY dark circles, as they do not help expanding your eyes. I apply white shadow in the inside corner of my eye and white eyeliner in my waterline to make my eyes wider and more awake. Then I apply some in the inner corner, as well as 1/4 the way in the inner corner, on top and bottom lids. I then apply a transluscent base shadow, like taupe or something similar to my skin colour, with NO SHIMMER. It will attract the inner corners. I then chose only one eyeshadow applied in a sideways "V", like this tiny diagram o>. Then I blend a bit into my crease and I do not go in further than 1/3 the way in. I put some eyeliner, 1/2 way from the outer corner and in, and sometimes on the bottom too if I feel like it, making it thicker on the outside and thinnest halfway. I sometimes do a little "cat's eye" with my liquid liner, using pencil, then liquid. Finally, for mascara, I curl my lashes, and I apply lengthing mascara to ONLY half of the of the lashes, from the outside corner, and sometimes the bottom. I apply a little extra on the outer corners.You can also try individual flase lashes or a little coloured mascara, like blue, green, purple, or shimmer. That looks great too.    Basically, remember to keep ALL liners, shadow, and mascara away fro the inner corners, UNLESS it is as light as possible, like white. You can still wear any colour you like though.     Good Luck and I know how you feel.|`|jcGnBgAPaa	ideally, the best way to make any eyes pop and look pretty is lighter color eye shadow on the inner corners of the eyes and darker shadow blended into the light shadow from the outside corners.|`|np5R16RSaa	two ways:  darker shadown, eyeliner around the eyelids and ONLY USE WHITE kohl for the inside of the eyes that will make them look ;)      lighter shadow but tons of mascara and should be black mascara, can use darker kohl for the inside but if you want them to look wider always use white or baby pink kohl|`|wZvORqnhaa	I put darker eye shadows on the outer corner of my eyes.  Also, I put light colour (eg. shimmery colours) on the inner corners of my eyes.|`|d7RxeNJbaa	hi you can try this one:  beauty-tips4you.blogspot.com

IgCXzbxPaa	If you have a walmart or walgreens go buy color remover one's called color oops by Clairol and i think the other is by revlon. It takes out color without  damaging hair but you will need to color or lighten you're hair directly afterward. If you color it you need to choose a color 2-3 shades lighter than what your going for because It soaks up color and the color will appear darker.
aa35e095a615d2c9fa9251d229a3968aaa	No, it's not. The article probably said it may increase the risk, but that would be it.

cYktV9B5aa	Oh my...the worst thing to do when you get a pore or a zit is to NEVER squeeze//pop it. You may think like ''ALRIGHT THE PORE//ZIT IS GONE!'' then it gets red and gross and it looks like it grows back >  What you should do is get a special ointment or like, a special cream//face wash that takes off all pores.  try this--http://www.biore.com/usa/products/produc...  ^__^ No more squeezinggg.|`|Ogh2zd7eaa	you probably squeezed to  much, dont worry it will go away. there is nothign you can do about pores, is generic.|`|SghwXlQ9aa	Well, it sounds like all that you did was inflame the pore, which irritated your nose. If I were you, I wouldn't touch it for a while, wait until it heals and then see what happens. Next time, leave the squeezing and such to the dermatologists.

qQqC2cHIaa	The best way to start a fashion line is to master all the things you want to skip.  The first thing you need to learn is patience, it's a long hard road and not a business to go into for anyone expecting quick success.  Go to fashion design school or to business school.  Fashion design school will require you to sew your designs as you learn, so there's no getting around that.  Business school can be even more tedious.  You could try to hire pattern makers, and contract out the sewing, but that will still require solid knowledge of garment construction so you know what qualifies as a quality garment.  Look at what happened to Victoria beckham's denim line, she had no idea of what went into good denims in terms of fit and construction and the line flopped.  Many pattern makers and contractors won't work with someone who isn't knowledgeable about construction and design.  Times are tough and they don't like to loose money.  They don't work for free or on speculation.  The rest of us had to learn the tough stuff we had to take the time to learn the business inside and out, you do too.  What you want is like a home builder wanting to build homes and knows how to use a hammer and saw, but doesn't have the patience to learn about construction.  If you read many designers biographies you will find that many of them loved sewing as much as sketching, that the passion for fashion extending into the construction of clothes as well as drawing pretty dresses.     Sewing isn't difficult, it just takes a bit of practice and attention to little details: neatness counts, keep seams straight, finish seams so they don't fray, trim loose threads and press frequently.    Become an accepter?  What does that mean?|`|WHt2NfGaaa	Business 101 is you need to have a plan. For a plan you need to have education or a ton of money.    If you have money than there are companies that can help you start your own line including people that will make the clothing.    If you dont have the money then you really need to read at least one business book and hire a college student that will know how to make the clothes.     Either way it's expensive, timely, and probably not worth it unless you're willing to get little sleep for the next year.    This is from a person who has several friends in the fashion industry and has grown up in it.
AA11812946	In the state of California, you can take community college classes at any local college for free during 9th - 12th grade. Its a great thing to take advantage of while you're in high school (and while it's still available).     I suggest you check out your local colleges and take class book things to have yourself a look see of any hair styling/cosmetic classes. The only thing you would have to pay is maybe materials fee...who knows.    Good luck
hkJQGCHuaa	you should be able to take them to any shoe repair type place to get them dyed. if you have a david's bridal around you or another bridal store they should be able to dye them as well.  you can dye them yourself, i've done it before with an inexpensive pair of shoes, it worked fine.|`|Cnkxh9igaa	Why dye them when you can get shoes that already look amazing?    http://ericavalanche.zlio.net/c/Shoes/Ed...|`|c47da15fdc6e17571ad7443290e6bf9baa	Some shoe stores will dye shoes for you.

I recommend if you have like dark brown it can be used. I also like using midnight blue. But really you can pair it with anything. If you are wearing a cute dress(no floral kinds though), you can add it on to give it edge. I wear it a lot with a shirt longer than the jacket, and some jeans with my converse. Hope that helps a little, but in the end it is really up to you. Good luck with the look.

(i21)|`|06GF0APWaa	You should totally lighten your overall color with blonde highlights. I would long layer it so the layers start past your chin.|`|Vrc13ExVaa	:> You're so pretty.    You can really pull off whatever you want.    Of the examples you gave, my favorite is definitely the third.  I think a short cut would look good on you. Maybe something really short and kind of spiky would look good, too. I personally thing that really short cuts are extremely cute, but you seriously would look good with anything.    If you get bangs, I think it would look better if they weren't totally even like in example 2, and were not so covering of your face.     http://www.celebrity-hair-styles-magazin...    http://www.celebrity-hair-styles-magazin...    http://www.celebrity-hair-styles-magazin...

If you're interested in some color, you can really pull, again, anything off. Some blue to match your eyes or, as someone else recommended, dark red.|`|beTBfCkTaa	blonde. and i think you could pull of the straight across longer straight bangs. and like tapered and layered a lot.  but if you dont straighten your hair then dont do that.|`|gAqqbyHFaa	I think red( not kool-aid either) would look really pretty on you...and maybe layer it, too.

vgxeAC11aa	Dying would be a much better decision .    I dyed a bleached a part of my hair blonde, and it got fried and some of the hair isn't going to grow back .  It's only about 20 strands, but it all adds up .    Dying doesn't damage your hair, it's just colouring over the top, whereas bleach strips the colour from it .  Also, dying your hair makes it really shiny for a week or 2 so that's a plus n_____n  Hope I helped !|`|bITTzzcVaa	Blonde hair dye does contain a certain amount of bleach...so its pretty much the same thing just a smaller amount and not as damaging.     One of the plus sides to coloring hair is that it thickens the hair, specifically bleaching hair. However, im not sure I reccomend you dyeing or bleaching.    Start off with highlights, they wont be as harsh and if anything should go wrong, its not all of your hair.    After you have it colored, condition as you normally would when you shower but also have a spray in-leave in conditioner too. This helps to prevent breakage and more damage. Expecially if you use a straightning iron or hair dryer.    I reccomend this brand...  http://www.aussie.com/us/collections/hai...    Good Luck!|`|UwEEHuRcaa	Personally if my hair was fragile I would not put any chemicals on it. However you could try Henna. It is a natural substance which will change the color of your hair and give it a glossy texture too.

WSziasfMaa	I've been told that Oxi clean works well for this type of thing.|`|N7xKowJYaa	lemon juice maybe.  i got some on my blue shirt and it took all the color out, lol|`|WHt2NfGaaa	try straight vinegar water to rinse it or clorox pens work very well without making the white yellow. I have a pair of Cole Haan shoes that got a scruff so I put the clorox pen to it which made it go away within seconds.|`|EW1yumzNaa	What I do for white shoes it put spray and wash, on the whole shoe, and use and old toothbrush to scrub the areas, with the stains, I repeat this 3 times, then thrown them in the washing machine to be washed!

U0LPJ2Puaa	Keep it really clean, just leave a little bit.  I have talked with a lot of my friends about this and we all agree that a little bit is the way to go.

whAEXgLvaa	Awww...that is so romantic : )  If I was you I would call him and ask him to give me a hint for an outfit based on where he is taking me - formal or casual. Most guys would give some pointers. After they all what to show up with the best looking girl. I would suggest wearing hills, you can never go wrong with hills. Even if you have a pair of jeans on - it will give a dressy look to your outfit.    Few months ago a guy kept thanking me for showing up on a date with hills. I though it was very strange (I think I would wear hills if I go camping : ).  Apparently he was tired of chicks showing up with running shoes for casual dates.    Good luck on your date.

My BFF has this  http://www.bmezine.com/pierce/05-lips/A9...  and the scar tissue that happened when she took it out was TERRIBLE.  The scar was on her actual lip but it looked like a nipple. her piercing was always clean and never infected, but the tissue from the inside of the piercing expanded when it became a scar and popped out the top hole.  Gross, but i still love her, will every one still love you with nipple lip??|`|2LDtSDMuaa	eew... i don't like it at all.|`|uReFjOONaa	no no noooooooo|`|K07hctlMaa	ew gross    have fun never kissing a guy|`|UwD4Gk3Uaa	ewww no way. get snake bites or a reg labret|`|FO5KQzf0aa	My honest opinion, I dont like it. It must be painful! and if it gets caught on something...    But the great thing about piercings is that if you dont like it once its fully healed or you get fed up with it, then u can take it out and it wil heal up.    Don't let people tell you if you should have it or not. the choice is yours.

It is dangerous wearing jewelry while participating in sports and other events.  You don't want to lose a finger just because you chose to wear a ring!
PtflNGQgaa	My answer won't be the Top Answer, but I think you should go with the other answers.  Formal situations like dances, symphonies and theater productions are good choices.  Besides, if it comes down to it, throw your OWN formal gown party and invite your friends!  All up to you.  It could be a lot of fun!|`|4JWfH42waa	you can wear it out and just make it casual by putting a belt or jacket over it like this: http://www.weardrobe.com/pictures/show/8...|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	well, go out to dinner and celebrate your birthday!|`|ZhfYEHVKaa	I used to love to go to plays downtown with my mom.

The link for the orange didn't work so I couldn't see that one.    I would go pink if your a "girly girl" and love to show your feminine side.    Blue if wanna come off as "calm & cool".    Yellow if you are playful and flirty.    Green. In my opinion the green is just nasty. Oh and I like the Dooney's. LOL|`|SGCLFbAHaa	Well this all depends on matching....  the orange would be good with- purple green or yellow clothes, hazel eyes, or medium/dark tan skin    the pink would be good with- pink clothes, or pirtty much anything else    blue would be good with- blue clothes, blue eyes, or pritty much anything else    yellow (is designed a little better and looks more fashonable and ) would be good with- yellow clothes, hazle eyes, light/medium tan skin    green would be good with- green clothes, or pritty much anything else      i hope this helps u on what to buy...i would go with the yellow|`|dBi78zNraa	yellow|`|4Ugn188Gaa	It really depends on what you're wearing with it, but I would prefer the blue one overall.

UEtxG2HYaa	i think that the quality is pretty good. their eyeliners are great. they are just about the same quality as any of the other more expensive ones I've bought. however, i think that the eye shadow palettes aren't as good as the other eyeshadows I have. i also prefer the other brand foundations, such as bare minerals. however, the avon products are still good. they work fine, so if you want to save a few bucks, going with 10 avon products for like $25 is way better than buying not even one eyeshadow from mac or any other big brands. I buy the avon a lot because i don't have a ton of money sitting in my pocket every day!|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	I've been buying from Avon for years. Don't buy their jewelery. It's cheap. But the lotions and makeup aren't cheap.|`|SLmLGwnNaa	I sell avon so of course I say that it's great..... but I really do use tons of avon products.... & love most of them!|`|pm0hHXKpaa	I don' t believe there is a difference other then their marketing, Avon is sold through people that want to make money  if you want quality for the price try a Natural store you'll pay some money but it would be better quality then Avon  or try Dove i just like it better, i know I'm a guy but my sister bought it and i liked it  but I still shop at the natural store for shampoo and what not  far as make up they sell it there too but i wouldn't know, you can go and ask questions at any health foods store and I'm sure they'll be glad to help with no charge!|`|P0ewGWkHaa	The are so many brands out there that you could try, But Avon is a good brand and it stand by it good quality satisfaction. I was Avon a consultant but because of my busy schedule I had to give it up. I still use it to this day, All the ladies in my family from my grandmother to my sister use Avon products,  Mary Kay is good but to expensive. and Loreal, cover girl, clinique, mac etc, while you don't get the consultant discount..|`|ncCWCIEFaa	It really is all about personal preference and what works for you just like wine you can get a good one very inexpensive or you can pay a whole lot inexpensive doesn't always mean cheep.    The Direct Sales Avon, Mary Kay Arbonne come with a free service a consultant that will be there to answer questions and let you try new products for free help you pick what is best for you.  You can get free consultants at the department store but most likely you wont get or see that person again where as your skin care needs change with the season or time you can still go back to your Direct Sales consultant so take advantage of the free service try different brands and see what is best fo you|`|8a4knLsSaa	They all utilise cheap chemicals in much the same way. Branding is a huge part of cosmetics, if you like the look of something cheap then don't worry about the price, consider it a bonus that it's cheap.|`|vhEp3PeJaa	The thing about Avon and Mary Kay is that you can go and have them help you find the RIGHT make up for you. They can also help you set up a skin care plan, that will make you look better with and without make up and that can make you feel like they are totally superior. The thing is that you can go to a department store and have them do the same thing with a one time consultation, where they evaluate your skin type, set you up with the right cleansers for your face and help you match shades the right way.     I think of the ones you mentioned clinique is honestly a better quality, although Mary Kay is pretty decent as well.   Covergirl and lorel are more mass marketed products that you can buy anywhere and generally, people by the wrong type of make up for their face. What you can do, is find a mary kay consultant in your area, have them do the whole assessment on you, give you free samples, and then go buy your own make up.     If you're asking because you want to sell avon, my answer is, don't. It's not really worth it. Most people don't make enough money for the time they put into it. But if you have a network or the potential to network with a lot of people with extra money go for it. The average person in this economic climate doesn't have that kind of spare cash though.     Hope this helped!
7e86dc249e02eda2f37c61a8f9972f0aaa	You need to purchase shampoo and conditioner for color treated hair. Professional products would be best. The Conditioner that they give you with the hair dye and contain proteins and hydrators with oils. A conditioner like that would be more than likely too heavy for an every day use causing your hair to be oily and it would weight it down. You should definitely look into a  hydrating shampoo and conditioner like Pureology and one that is good for color treated hair.   Shampoo and conditioner for color treated hair will help your color to stay longer (less dye's, less damage) and will give you the hydration you need. Good luck!!!|`|6k7C9xETaa	the reason why it feels soo good is that most colors today have some kind of "conditioner" in it soo the hair isnt as damaged after coloring. So your pretty much using a mild conditioner next to a strong one. Heres what will help. DONT go buy any new conditioner (unless it has harming chemicals in it that is fading your hair faster like sulfate or any thing that starts with para), instead, go buy yourself some shower caps. Put your conditioner that you have now on your hair, wrap it up and clip it, put that shower cap on. Add heat with your blow dryer for a good 5-10 min or just let it sit for 15-20 min no heat, rinse then style normally. Depending on your hair type (dry, normal, or oily) is how often a week you should do this is your normal hair routine. If your hair is dry 1-2 times a week, normal 1 time a week, oily once every two weeks.  You can also get this done at a salon but it usually costs $20 or more. It is called a conditioning treatment.  Also, once your hair feels "moisturized" i would stop the use of this or your hair may become extremely oily do to the fact that your forcing too much weight into your hair  hope this helps!|`|tgCNwQ2Saa	maybe it's great at first but some hair got damage after excessive usage of strong conditioners...

70a43707807dc9900f19f111a38b3d42aa	Next time you go to get a haircut, ask your stylist/hair dresser to thin out your hair. They do this usually with a razor. It will grow back, but you can keep doing this to keep your hair nice and manageable. I do it about every 1-2 months. I have pretty thick hair that's why. (:|`|3d1XRIzkaa	Buy you some Nexus  Therappe Shampoo. It is great for thick hair. Also, buy some Nexus Conditioner. They sell Nexus at Walmart Super Center's in Health & Beauty by the shampoo's. The conditioner will soften your hair.|`|MXpW48lFaa	Well go to the hairdressers and ask them to 'razor' your hair.  Razoring your hair makes it thinner.   All they do is brush your hair (with a special technique)   with a comb that has razors made for your hair in them,  and they just start thinning it out.  Trust me. I have THICK THICK THICK hair,   && that's what my hairdresser told me.  Everyone who doesn't want thick hair should get it razored.      Hope I Helped :)|`|p3GZERIsaa	My brothers hair just like yours!

bPZlpe0taa	If it has a head on it,gently clean the area and dry it,then using a tissue or just your clean fingers gently press on the pimple sideways and then up,if stuff comes out that's a good thing,if you can't pop the first time it don't force it otherwise you will make it worse. Clean it again and put a medicated acne gel or cream on it,apply that before that before bed too,if it's still fairly red in the morning you can put some foundation over it and then dab some concealer and if you like a little powder over it,if you put concealer on after foundation and not the other way around it will cover it better,green concealer does help to cover redness but if you don't have that then a normal one will work fine.

Just put a really hot washcloth on your nose for it to become a white head and then was your face with anti bacteria face soap twice to three times a day. And it will go way in three days and you can also get at the store is medication for your pimple on your nose. Just wash your face and you will be fine just ignore the other people if they tease you and it will go away. If it is not ready to pop do not pop it or you will get big ugly sores on your face and it is not pretty at all either. The other thing that you can do is if you have make up cover up the liquid kind then put it on your face for school in the morning.

They are kangaROOS. These shoes were popular in the 70s and 80s but died down in the US after that. One distinction that these shoes have (or had rather) is that they have a pocket on the side. People didn't know what they could put inside such a little pocket since it's kinda small. But you can put a condom in them (very sexy). They are making a come-back in the last 5-10 years among trendier teens/adults. They are more popular in europe. You can buy these shoes online or in your local mall like at journeys or something. www.kangaroos.com
XSTVl0kMaa	Contrary to some other answers you have received, do NOT chemically relax (aka chemically "straighten") your hair. If they knew anything about hair, they would know that the strength of a relaxer  varies from a pH factor of 10 to 14 (the strongest, and harshest pH). With higher pH, the faster the straightening solution will take hold, but the more potential the damage to your hair (and if your not careful, your scalp). A relaxer is not something to be taken lightly, or to just be bought at a drugstore (due to the high amounts of lye in non-salon relaxers).   When straightening your hair, you are using a very high amount of heat, thus 'ironing' your hair out. If you iron your shirt, and then get hit with a water balloon, that shirt will wrinkle. Same with your hair. Sweat is moisture.   Being half Kenyan & half Caucasian, I have the curliest, craziest hair in the world. I never wear it curly. The best thing for you to do when your out havin' fun with your girls is to take some 'breaks' in between some songs; that way you wont sweat as much, thus your hair frizzes and curls less. Now for the health of your hair, I suggest after blow drying and straightening it, wrap it in a silk scarf before you go to bed. By sleeping with your hair in a silk scarf every night, it will be more manageable in the morning, thus less heat you have to use from your straightener trying to go back over it to get out those kinks from tossing and turning through the night. Our curls are sensitive and must be treated so! Make sure you use a silk scarf (or pillowcase), and not cotton. Cotton might feel soft to our skin, but on our hair it is a harsh abrasion which can break the cuticle or cause damage. Good luck, and party on!|`|3d1XRIzkaa	use some hair mousse.

It may be some harmonal / physiological imbalance that could be set right quickly, if treated early..    If you are not inclined for allopath specialities, consult a senior Ayurvedic Dr from reputed hospital (like Kotakal Vaidyasala).. They will give some medicated oil bath etc to put things right..    For, sudden change of skin colour may not be ignored.. according to a health literature I read. Hence I would advise against self medication.

When used with sandal it will give best result.    2.Try washing your face after you go out in sunlight.

For stubborn dark spots you should try a high percentage hydroquinone cream, try Ebay or Amazon. You can also use a mild exfoliant like salicylic acid - you find that in acne washes like neutrogena clean and clear. Or an actual acid peel if you're feeling extravagant.

From the website I found there is no minimum age for treatment, however it does say that most are over 21. Hair Restoration generally costs between $4000 and $5000 but can get as expensive as $12000 depending on the doctor, and how much you are getting to restored. The website I found mentioned that grafts cost between $3-$10 per graft but the number of hairs a doctor puts in per graft can very so it suggested seeing a doctor and asking him/her about it. If I was doing hair restoration I would see a few different doctors and weigh the pros/cons of each one to make your best decision. Who knows you may be able to mention the different prices to each doctor to see if you can get your favorite to lower his/her price!|`|SMsprdMfaa	I would say not to use chemicals on your hair.Why don't you go for some home remedies.

Hair loss can be the result of a poor diet, stress, weather, a body ailment (disease, illness...). If it's simply genetics, I'm sorry but there's not much you can do about that.   For the time being, I recommend henna-ing your hair. Do your research and you'll find that henna is amazing as making hair stronger, thicker, and glossier. When people think of henna, they think of red dye, but it actually comes in black and a neutral shade.   If henna seems a bit weird to you, there is also supplements you can take. Fish oil, Vitamin E, and a B-complex would all help your hair troubles.|`|6zXpA0PNaa	One thing you could try is that you go to your doctor, tell them your concern, and what you should do about your diet. Sometimes, it's just diet that could change the way your hair looks. If you wear a hat often, stop for a while. Allow your scalp to breathe. Are you stressed out? Relax....hair loss can also happen from stress, and that has happened to me before. Do you dye or bleach your hair? Stop for a while to allow your scalp to breathe as well.    If it's genetics, well, there isn't much you can do unfortunetly, but try these things.    If not, hair transplants are better than say...10 years ago...

What happens is that when you use very hot water to wet your hair/scalp directly, you go bald faster.    Second, drink lots of water.  Believe me, the hair and the scalp needs moisture, and as far as I know it helps to drink lots of water to help your head.    Third, use shampoo and conditioner that fits you.  You must have been using the wrong ones for your head.  Also, avoid brushing or combing your hair too much when it is wet.  The hair is at its weakest when it's wet.    Fourth, apply just an ample amount of whatever styling agent you use on your hair. Do not be excessive --- it is a waste of money, time, effort, and hair health.    Last, pamper your hair by going to the salon. A hair spa, i think, would do you good.  Guys could get hair spas too, right?  Don't worry, i know someone who gets it done to his hair --- my boyfriend.    So, that's it.

Apply your clear mascara (this can be an inexpensive one from boots/superdrug or any other pharmacy); this will act as hair gel but for your eyelashes.  2. As you wait for your clear mascara to dry, you can apply your other eye make up such as eyeliner, eyeshadow etc..  3. Heat your eyelash curlers with a hair dryer, but touch the eyelash curler on your face to see how hot the curlers are. You don't want them being too hot.  4. Curl your lashes from the base and crimp along your eyelashes three times.  5. Apply your mascara (the one you're using now). Start from the base, and wiggle - this will get every lash ( i think this is what it does )  (6.) If you want longer, thicker lashes, then wait for your first coat of mascara to dry; then add another coat. Wait for that to dry, then add another coat.|`|qzY2tRTeaa	Um actually Eyelash curlers make a huge difference.

You can use a eyelash brush to brush out the coats. I like to apply eyeliner brown or black under my eyelashes on my lid, right up against the eye lash roots. then a gel liner on top of my lids as thin and even as possible.    also, experiment with different mascara. good luck!    you should really play with some natural looking fake lashes. they are so amazing!!! when i put them on i use a light lash tint to kinda blend my fake lashes with my real ones and use the same eye lining  techniques as above.

Also, raise the head of the bed (or use extra pillows) to help reduce facial swelling.    You can also use another method and what you should do is to take a bowl of lukewarm water and dip a clean cloth into it. When you take out the cloth from the bowl, you should wriggle out the water from the cloth and touch the swelled surface with it. This way also, your swelling is expected to get healed.

But if they are flat white spots, that could be a skin-pigmentation problem, which may or may not be serious! i would go to a doctor or a dermatologist asap. at night, put vaseline petroleum jelly all over your face, or even aloe vera. wait awhile until the redness goes away, and then you can use a gentle scrub to get rid of the dead skin.  always use sunscreen from now on, cuz once i had sun-blisters, that part of my skin never tanned after that.|`|edAtsw3waa	You're skin was definately damaged! The white spots are just pigmentation which will go away when your skin completely heals which could take up to 3 months I'm afraid. Make sure you moisturize your face every night and morning. Wear sunscreen (invisible zinc is the best) everyday to avoid further damage. You should be doing this even if you aren't burnt actually. Vitamin C Serum is also helpful, put it on every morning (before suncreen) and night.|`|CjW9fiSHaa	well, lotion the peelings areas. the spots will stay. sorry. wear sunscreen|`|Sxd0tXDwaa	use aloe sunburn gel

Animals with longer fur require more grooming than others because you can see the fur get stringy and stuff after a few months.

I charge 33 dollars, which includes a shampoo and blowdry and style. Hope that helps, and good luck!|`|561ecfda0fc5d3ec450c600d8899b467aa	Want pin straight thin hair invest in a Maxiglide!

AA11474950	If you wear glasses than you will need to go to an optometrist to cleck your vision and they will provide some for you even if you won't them in color. And if you just want for design you can go to the beauty supply store but you can not sleep in them.|`|8CaOYfacaa	First, if you dont have to wear contacts, dont. They are easy to put in, but maintenance is constant.    With that said, whether you want to just change your color or get them for corrective, you have to go thru an optometrist.  They will check your eyes, and make sure they are healthy. They check to make sure you have 20/20 vision.They then measure your eyes, and set you up with "trial contacts" to test them.  Each persons eyes are different.  The eye doctor or an assistent will tell/show you how to get your contact in.     You MUST get a prescription to order color contacts. Then you can order contacts from anywhere, in any colors.     After you order your contacts, you must follow cleaning, and maintenance on them to the letter. This will keep your eyes clean, clear and free of infection and debris.|`|e5df21df622f10159ed4186f6f9d6f31aa	Yes, you need to go to an optometrist. That's how you'll find the right lenses and you need to have a fitting. I know exactly what you're talking about cuz I'm in the same boat. Good luck!|`|AA11626281	it might hurt your eyes when you first wear them. but you should ask the person who are very pro about it because they could answer almost every of your questions, =]    good luck.|`|EEDmoG6Saa	I have contacts and you do have to go to the optometrist because they have to figure out what kind would be a good match for your eyes based on the wetness and shape, etc. So yes, you would have to see the optometrist and once you get the contacts they will show you how to put them in and everything.|`|9e18d3f8410ca792401a8f5e3e7874efaa	You need to see an eye dr before even considering contacts.  I wear contacts to correct my vision and they can get irritating during the day so always have some comfort drops to keep them moist, and always wash your hands properly before touching them. Any little piece of dirt or tap water can cause an eye infection.  You may also find out that you have astigmatism like I did when i went to get my lenses fitted, this means that your eye is shaped like a rugby ball rather than a football and contacts may be more uncomfortable for you.  Just be careful with them, there is no point risking an eye infection for cosmetic reasons.|`|XhCifgIqaa	Contact lenses have to be fitted to your eye, so you have to call an eye doctor and make an appointment, whether you have bad vision or not.|`|khd8EpO1aa	yes you should go see an opometrist for your persciption and only wear them whrn needed too.
95cbad6092cc21679b24e4c1681f5589aa	If your hair is light colored, use white vinegar.  If hair is darker, use apple cider vinegar.  One cup vinegar in a cup of water will remove buildup.

d61546f907ad89f5849cc56da60170a8aa	yes john frieda  Just wanted to say a few things about this glaze. I am a professional hairdresser and so I know a thing or two about how these things work.    We do services not unlike this to clients in the salon. Sometimes they take about 15-20 minutes to freshen up color with a very low-peroxide glaze (like Shades EQ by Redken), and other times we do what we call a 'soap cap' which is basically a stylist-mixted concoction of color, usually deep conditioner and, yes, a teeny bit of peroxide, usually.    I have not tried this JF Glaze, or read the label, but really, other than the stuff that Granny uses to turn her hair blue, there really isn't much out there that is truly ammonia- or peroxide-free.     It simply is a necessary ingredient for color to work in a way where it gets embedded into the hair strands so as not to be washed out during the shampoo process (Granny's rinse DOES wash out during her weekly shampoos and gets reapplied).    This would explain why you went 'a little more red' than you're used to seeing, F. Seattle. Peroxide/other developing agents do cause the smallest amount of lightening, which, in most cases, 'warms' the hair.    My opinion about all this is that I think it is a wonderful idea to be able to 'freshen' color at home, and it doesn't seem to hurt my business at all as a professional (mostly because where there are home colorists, there are mistakes...)but I would love some truth in the way these products are marketed. Saying they are without ingredients that sound 'scary' to home colorists, and then they actually ARE there in some form or another is pretty sneaky. I see many girls each month who are sure they bought a color that 'washes out after 7 shampoos'. No such thing exists; even if YOU no longer see the color, for it to have lasted through even 1 shampoo, it is a different dye class altogether (non-temporary, more like demi-permanent), and still leaves damage behind.    Don't hesitate to ask your stylist to customize a 'soap cap' for you to take home. We do it for nearly the same price as the JF stuff, but your own personal color formula is used (not just one that is close). Above all, just know what you are getting with these products, and if you choose an OTC color, ask your colorist to go over the ingredients for you so you can be sure of the results beforehand      Luminous Color Glaze? products are an easy-to-use, at home, salon glazing treatment any time your hair needs a pick-me-up. Your hair will glow with newfound vibrancy and shine  just shampoo, condition, then glaze for luminous color like never before.     Step 1   Start with John Frieda? Collection shampoo and conditioner designed for your hair shade. Squeeze excess water out of hair.     Step 2   While still in the shower, smooth Luminous Color Glaze? product through wet hair, distributing evenly from root to tip. Wash hands thoroughly.     Step 3   Leave on for at least three minutes. Rinse and style as usual. Use each time you wash your hair, or a minimum of three times per week, to achieve your ideal result. Color results intensify over time.|`|8CaOYfacaa	I do my own hair glaze. Natural Instincts and Nice and Easy make fantastic hair shine glazes....that makes your hair shiney and smooth. Its only 8-10 bucks....at walmart.    But If you want to do professional, make sure its a product with no ammonia or peroxide..which is damaging.

See the link below for the guide to filing a design patent, and/or see www.uspto.gov for any other information you would need, such as forms, info about fees, etc.  Hope that helps!

f1bdd8f3dd409cdd71223c7d68e40664aa	Bleach is a decolorizer and will remove all particulates in the hair shaft.  Meaning artifical pigment, natural melanin, toxins, whatever.  It also, unlike tints which do their job and stop working, keeps working as long as you keep it on.  The different developer supplies the "gas" if you would, for it to work. Higher volumes of developer allow it to work longer.  A 40 volume developer will lift faster in the first 10 minutes only than a 30 volume developer when mixed with a decolorizer.    However, if it dries out...it stops!  Make sure that you keep it moist to keep it working.    If you bleach your hair past a pale yellow, you will melt it.  Hair is NOT MEANT TO BE BLEACHED TO WHITE!! A toner is used on pale yellow hair to get white.  If you are planning on applying a direct dye over your pre-ligtened hair remember if you de-sensitize the hair too much, there is nothing for the dye to attach itself to and you will simply end up having to reapply the direct color more often as it will fade to something unsavory within the first several days.    I am not sure about the decolorizer that you're using as I use only professional products but since it is sold to the consumer, it's probably your saftest bet to stay with it.  Just remember, if you are bleaching your hair past pale yellow, it will break off!  When you feel that rubbery, stretchy hair....not good!!  You'll end up with all of your highlights in your hair brush!!|`|AA11872348	I think that when you bleach it again you should use the 30 vol. and don't put it on the hair that has turned white,if you do I'm sure it will get gummy and melt off your head.|`|b8d57fe068fe16a866a8b25f1fdc31c3aa	You can use either one but if you use 40 dont leave it on to long even if it doesnt get you bleach blonde. Since you already dyed it and you may have to do it again i would use 30. After you do it and you still want to be blonder wait about a week and then do it again....but make sure you use a really good conditioner, a really good leave in conditioner and dont wash your hair everyday either!!! Good Luck!!!|`|145211875f5adee8a13423ca577fcb7caa	Because your hair is so dark, you can not safetly hightlight it to a light blonde.  You have to highlight it with 40 vol.  Then when it gets to that golden blonde you should put hair color that is blonde over top of it.  Since you already bleached it yesturday & left it on for 1 1/2 hrs I would not recommend highlighting it again for awhile.  If you do you'll ruin your hair, it could literally break off.  You hair is probably really fried already.  Use a leave in treatment once a week.  And if you do anything to your hair, don't put on more bleach!  Just put on hair color with 20 vol.  To be safe, get it done at a salon & tell the stylist everything you have done to your hair.

geRn5uXuaa	If you want a tan fast, try using a tanning lotion with a self tanner mixed in.  I think Hawian Tropics has one that is a SPF of 4 with a self tanner, so you can fake it a little bit.   They also make a SPF 6 tanning lotion that works pretty well once you have a bit of color.  I gives you a good amount of protection, but still allows you to tan.  Just dont stay out too long with those on, however.|`|2bf4200fd8e38af1fd0c430fc5264ab0aa	It all depends on what you want as a life condition when you are older.

You will age your skin a whole lot faster, meaning when your 30, you'll look like you have 60 year old skin. Any tanning lotion that is about SPF 15 is good, lather it on and head out into the sun for about 30 to 45 minutes. Use a timer, and be aware for how long you have been out in the sun. Drink lots of water as well to stay hydrated. Also, for any more tips or questions, refer to the July issue of Seventeen Magazine. It has alot of tips and things you need to be aware of when tanning, it's very interesting! I hope this helps!!|`|yJCdLNHwaa	Water.

You also should have an attractive photogenic face.  If you're bod is hot but you face is not, then you won't be high fashion. You'll be more muscle or fitness magazine material.      Visit a legit agency (one who doesn't sell classes or portfolios.  hooking you up with photogs is fine) and see what they think.  Find out information about their 'open calls' and what you need to bring to them.  Have them tell you honestly what you would be good for and market yourself towards that.

8faa21b674355d35c1a9a22d53f23664aa	Italians... they are most famous for their designer fashion, and the silky dresses. Hmm... while travelling in Italy avoid the very "modern" styles, like Abercrombie&Fitch jeans, and American Eagle types of clothing. I would shop probably at H&M, it has really nice European styles, like the flirty dresses and the nice bikinis. As well, wearing designers (they CAN be fake) such as Italian brands like Dolce and Gabbana sunglasses that big are really cute. When I think of Italy a true Italian is one that wears the knee high dresses and doesn't carry around a big tourist bacpack with the American style clothing. But don't change your whole wardrobe on this one occasion, you can still look like a true Italian (especially with your looks) with affordable prices for Zara, H&M and sometimes don't doubt Wal-Mart. Even when you go to Italy, try looking at their top stores and buy nice stuff there, as souviners as well. Y'know one trip can fly by in a blink of in eye so spend it gloriously!

I would work out what sector of the industry you are interested in i.e. buying, merchandising, design etc and apply to some companies who take on work experience. You cannot get a better insight than actually being involved directly.|`|55eede6bb17bddca002aadafded445e4aa	No.  I think any school with a fashion program should suffice.  As long as you have drive, determination, and can show how hard of a worker you are, the college you go to shouldn't be a huge factor.  It's all about how you present yourself and how willing you are to do the job and learn.|`|AA10862126	If you really want to succeed in the fashion industry you should go to a fashion school.

tdgIpc17aa	Things you will need   - Eyelash curler  - Mascara   - Liquid eyeliner/pencil eyeliner  - White eyeliner    First what you want to do is curl your eyelashes with the eyelash curler to make your eyelashes look longer. Bringing attention to your eyes. Once you finished that you want to start brushing your eyelashes with the mascara to make your eyelashes look more thicker and also longer and presentable. After that you want to outline your eye with the liquid eyeliner. Top and bottom. Then you take the white eyeliner and outline the bottom of your eye right under the part of your eye where you usually apply your eyeliner on. The corner of your eyes :P White eyeliner makes you look more awake and make your eyes appear much bigger than they are.   The white eyeliner -http://img208.imageshack.us/img208/6327/...    :) x|`|2U27BgmKaa	Well, I assume that you have brown eyes, so I'm going to show you colors that work for your colors. I know it's a lot of writing, but if you take the time, I promise I'll have some good pointers. I'll give you some examples from my favourite makeup but you can find other kinds of makeup as long as you keep with the basic principles. You can also match up colors with other brands. Here's what you do.  1. Make sure that you are using lighter shades. With your colouring (again according to your avatar) I would recommend greenish brown colors. Believe me, it will really make your eyes stand out. Use a highlighter on your upper lid right up to your eyebrows. Something like the color Blunt (located in the box right above the array of colors):  http://www.urbandecay.com/products/Blunt...  2. Next you want to put a shade over your lower lid, blending the color on top lid with your new shade (always start from lightest the darkest on eye colors). Also add a bit on the bottom of your eyes around your lashline to create a smokey eye affect. You may have to use a eyeshadow brush instead of a sponge. It's much better for your eyes and you can find some that are really inexpensive (I'm American, so I can find them at local drugstores, but I'm sure that you'll be able to find them too). Here's the kind of brush I'm talking about, along with the color I would suggest for the lid called Urb:  http://www.akbrushes.com/psc-712.html  http://www.urbandecay.com/products/URBEy...  3. The third step is optional but you can put a bit of a darker colour green in the outer corner of your eyes, just to add a little bit of glamor. A color like Chains:  http://www.urbandecay.com/products/Chain...  4. To make your eyes look bigger, you need to put your black eyeliner on the top lash line ONLY! The next step includes a trick for the waterline (inner lashes right next to your eyes). For your top lashline, just put a color like the Stila's liquid eyeliner. Liquid is great because you get a real control over how thick your line is. Here's the one I use:  http://www.stilacosmetics.com/product_de...  5. The real trick to making your eyes look bigger is to put a light liner right on your waterline. Your water line is is the red line ( 4) on this picutre:  http://www.makeupandbeautyblog.com/wp-co...  Put the white liner on the top and bottom water line. Depending on how dark you are you will want to choose between a white and a nude. If you are really dark, go with nude, if you are lighter, go with white. The two colors I would choose for you would be pearl or topaz in a kohl liner:  http://www.stilacosmetics.com/product_de...  6. Curl you eyelashes (very important since you want to get you lashes away from your eyes, not cover them up), and put on some mascara on the top, and just a touch on the bottom. Your done. I know it sounds like a lot right now, but once you get the hang of it, it'll take you no time at all. Good luck!|`|LxxyPssTaa	im a beautician and im affraid im gunna firstly have to say to everyone else, no. mascara does not make eyes look bigger, it just defines (hopefully not sounding harsh.)  the best way to open up eyes is using shading and toning usuing eyeshadows. you said you wanted to open up your eyes and so the best way to do this is highlighting the middle so it stands out and makes them bigger. i drew you a picture of how this can be achieved (sorry its not brilliant but i was rushing a bit :/ )  hope this helps.  by the way, dont avoid mascara but dont go toooo heavy on it.  also, add a line of think eyeliner to top lid and outter corners of the bottom. x  heres the picture :    http://i36.photobucket.com/albums/e43/em...|`|AA11502098	You can get a brand of mascara that makes your eyes look bigger i d remember what its called|`|UMldrfY2aa	White eyeliner is proven to make your eyes look alot bigger.|`|NEp2RpVBaa	Mascara immediately makes my eyes look bigger.

You could also try using a darker eye shadow. Maybe a dark brown or a dark blue or green depending on the color of your eyes. |`|AqgDosVqaa	Eyeliner makes your eyes really pop(: I use it on the top and bottom. Also, when you wear mascara, focus more on the ends of your lashes to make them look bigger on the ends. If you curl your eyelashes, they "pop" more as well. Hope this helped:D|`|wDS6php3aa	The best way that I have found personally is a couple of coats of mascara and then dot a creamy shimmery white in the inner corner of your eyes by your tear duct and blend it in. Really opens my eyes up and looks so amazing!|`|hHndD5SEaa	Eyes can be made bigger by applying a light catching colour such as gold or cream on the upper eyelids  Keep to neutral base colours - the darker you go - the smaller your eyes will look.  Applying a white eyeliner to the inner eyelid will appear to make your eyes bigger than they are.  Finish off by applying lots of lengthening mascara   xx|`|jQe7LAPPaa	use eyeliner on your top lid only and alot of mascara|`|0JUaZFBVaa	use a white eyeliner on the bottom and some volumizing mascara, but not much makeup at all|`|51GmL4s6aa	visit the following url|`|sGRFbAMGaa	This works.

Let's say you are using brown.  Start with the darkest color (not too dark) on the lid itself and a little up near the brow on the outside.  In the middle put the middle color from the brow down to the lid.  On the inside put the lightest color - tan or off white.  The lightest color should be about 1/3 of the area, while the other two split the remaining area.  Then start eyeliner in the middle to the outside of your eye.  Leaving it natural on the very inside.  This will give your eyes a larger appearance.  Finish up with mascara that lengthens your lashes.
WLuEIwp5aa	That's not true, but some scarring is not going to take ink at all, so it would just be really painful and useless to get a tattoo over it.  If the scarring isn't super thick, go talk to a tattoo artist and see what they say.    There are also some kinds of scars that would be made worse by tattooing, but it's not because the wound will open back up or anything like that.  Look up keloids on google if you want to know what happens there, it's a lot to type out.|`|3la627afaa	NO BUT WHEN U GO OVER THE TATTOO IT MIGHT LOOK ALLITLE WIERD BUT IT ALL DEPENDS ON THE SCAR SIZE WHEN U GO TO THE TATOOIS ASK HIM IF HE RECOMENDS IT|`|wro8xGOyaa	I have a tattoo on my foot and there is a scar on it when I got my tattoo it did not reopen my scar but I am not a tattoo artist so just go and talk to an artist and see what they have too say about the area.|`|6CxIDIQcaa	I'm not sure about getting a tattoo over scars if it will open them up again.  But one thing I would consider is if you are going to get a tattoo where you have scars remember people will be staring at your tattoo. Not only will they see your tattoo but they will see the scars on your forearm. If you don't mind that then you should talk to the person who will be giving you the tattoo. If they say they can tattoo over your scars it should be fine.|`|uv0Y7Ar8aa	You can tattoo over scars the only downside of this is, that it will be painful moreso than a normal tattoo ...  And it can affect the design depending on the tattoo.    Tattoos don't open up? This is "talk" and not fact. And it could turn out to be just fine doubtful that it will be worse.     Your best bet is to pick your design, then your artist and let them give you there opinion of how well the tattoo will look or suggestions as to what will look good.|`|WiIUEObTaa	DESIGN the artwork to make the scar that cannot be covered as part of the artwork. this will disguise the scar as well as be part of the art work. this is the easiets solution. artist will be more than willing to help. scar will not reopen. . possibly will cover all of scar.

aV0QmAOtaa	I don't think you should change who you are. New York City is actually a very diverse place so I think you should embrace the fact that you are different. The only reason why people give you "a look" is because they probably are not used to your clothing style or you being so outgoing. People react differently to the things they are not used to. I personally think your style is very unique and cool-looking. Just try to make some more friends, I'm sure someone will like you for who you are. Be yourself, because if you try to be different, than people will most likely criticize you or avoid you more. Good luck :)|`|snpIRyRuaa	wow.. i love your hair.. actually everything. cause i love anime...hehehe    anyways if u really want to be a ghetto., try to wear baggy pants and bling bling.. but u'r style is cute anyways,..|`|bhF67mXUaa	d@mn i love your hair!|`|NYB6epe5aa	I love your hair...keep it the same.

paEcdwQBaa	if you have skin like mine... theres no "cure".  but there are some tricks to make it less bothersome.     the best way that i avoid it is shaving with the grain instead of against it like you would to shave your legs. if you shave with the grain, you will have stubble just like when men shave their faces. so you can feel it but you can't see it. the reason you can feel it is becuase the hairs are trimmed to the line of the skin, instead of below it. so it doesn't have to break thru the skin again causing painful evil rash. I know its not as nice as being 100% smooth. but for me smooth only lasts a few hours then i have a rash for atleast a week, so this option is much more liveable on the long term|`|EOTH56DWaa	Just find you some old Angus Bull to chew it off for you.

Dry hair without a brush, then use a curling iron if you still need it. use a bit of hair spray to help it hold.|`|umR4jsYUaa	wash your hair then let it partially air dry then put curlers in and sleep in them and then int he morning your hair will be curly, oh and you might want to put some gel in before you put the curlers in. and if your dont have curlers take small sections of your hair and wrap them around your fingure and bobbypin them to your head. hope this helps|`|Ai6vvh5Faa	get it wet then rap a piece of hair around your finger then use a bobby pin to clip it to the roots. do that on all your hair then let it dry and it should be curly. or french braid it
JbUfC9d0aa	Try to comb your hair with water. Or after you take a bath! Then put an oil slick, hairspray, or gel and style it the Emo way... I'm punk and I do that. Try to do that and see if it helps... Hope its good!|`|yBrKP2sFaa	Okay, simple. Cut your wrists a little bit but not too much or too deep because deep down you really don't want to die, it's all about attention. Listen to depressing music when you do it. Cry atleast two times a day and constrict your balls in a pair of your sisters pants that are three sizes too small. Wear your sisters make-up. Think or act like you think life sucks. Act gay. Fall in love with dinosaurs and other mystical creatures. Try to make a scene, but when you do it look stupid and appear to be trying too hard.|`|cHa9BS7Vaa	i dont think i've ever seen curly emo hair!!....lol but try like to make it all choppy and layered i dont know i that'll help but i tried :)|`|i4epthHsaa	if you dont want to straighten it up, then just dye your hair black.  then add black eye liner.|`|wNwGA0Ztaa	why would you want emo hair?

You will be growing your hair out for QUITE a while. And that hair style will be hard to handle!!! You have to straighten and tease... but from the way your hair looks in that pic, I think you can handle it! You definitely look like you care about how your hair looks... you don't just brush it and go. Ultimately, the decision is up to you. You could always just cut some layers like in the pic into your hair and add more personality. I think you should think about it some more!

In other words seperate your top layer then make fishtail braids and make tight curls on top so the curls cover the back and sides of your head then when cool pull at them until you get the texture you want.Then pin the ends to the braids so you have a messy braids look.

0SsJR87xaa	I know what you mean by wrist. I had both of mine done. Barely felt it & healed quick with no rejection. Besides wrist, the back of your neck is a cool surface piercing and doesnt go any of the places you said you dont want it. Just make sure your piercer is legit and clean. Good luck!|`|9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	I think that they are generally a bad idea as they are almost guaranteed to reject. I will not perform them because of this.    Look into microdermals. You can get the look of a wrist piercing with a much better success rate.|`|7NfcM63waa	i got my piercing yesterday at diversity!|`|pQm7C1eqaa	wrist? wrist? ive never even heard of that.

Betta then mine|`|gZ6261Ljaa	i like the hair color, definitely. but im trying to picture you with your bangs down because i think it would look better because  1) your forehead is a little big for having them pinned back   and   2) they get frizzy and stick up when they are up like that.    i just htink that bangs would suit you better.     other than that it looks really nice|`|CiBq4WfZaa	sorry but let your hair down show you natural hair beauty|`|EwSEito4aa	is ok|`|RQmj6NEOaa	its very pretty|`|5RALqmcJaa	the color suits you.not the style.|`|sWCNs3Uaaa	looks fine|`|PQBEqS8Caa	no..i like it.

P7L4Vd3Paa	Baby doll flows from the bust down and does not have a seam or band at the waist.  A-line is a skirt that is fitted at the waist and is "A" shaped:  it widens down to the bottom (usually worn right above the knee).  A flared cut is more billowy with more material.  And an empire waist line is the waist line that is up higher, not down by the hips.

2diobki7aa	Try Sunsilk Therma Shine Spray.  Just spray it on your hair before straightening, and it protects against heat so your hair won't smell burnt!  It makes my hair so glossy and shiny after straightening, protects it from the heat, and makes it smell pretty good too.  Also, try Herbal Essences shampoos. They smell great, and come in all different scents!  :] Good luck!|`|VJpdmd0waa	Def need to get TeaTree shampoo it smells like mint an makes it smell great even after its been awhile after washing it.

There is nothing that smells so fresh and nice as it!!!!  Use the spray they have, it makes your hair silky and shiny.|`|NH1cPd3saa	well... if your hair always smells burnt then maybe you should stop straightening it, our get your hair relaxed or something. Also try heat protection spray if you do straightenit. Garnier Fructics smells great|`|115f4f25b9b308587daa5922af8f895eaa	Aussie hairspray smells really good, at the smell lasts all day. I'm not sure if it will cover up the burnt smell, but it might be worth a try. Also, you could try turning your straightener down, if your hair isn't super curly then your straightener only needs to get up to about 375 degrees, any higher then that and you might just be burning and damaging your hair.|`|DDwfcKg7aa	you can try a hair perfume, or get the straightners that have the moisterizing stuff on it.

e1434520b7d6b7db2b483084c9ad434aaa	You can have your hair "permanently straightened" at a salon.  Pros:  really straight hair  Cons:  not actually permanent (roots will grow back curly in 4-6 months)  expensive (about $200)  really damaging (esp. for permed or dyed hair)    The photos and steps in this article are really great. You could try just straightening parts of your hair, or just bangs. Also you could get it dyed some more.  http://www.wikihow.com/Make-Curly-Hair-S...  http://curllove.blogspot.com/2008/11/sid... (curly side bangs)    Hope this helps! :)|`|7fGG81bfaa	yeah, or else youd just have layers|`|EF45E5fcaa	scene is all about straight hair. If you did curly you would probably want to do the short bob look look and just straighten your bangs only. that could be really cute. Just make sure you have a lot of bangs. :P|`|GSbz9Zq4aa	well, if you cut your hair like this    http://www.zimbio.com/Short+Hairstyles/a...    your hair, since it's cut and short won't be as curly, then you could tease the tops or add colour, then when your hair grows a bit it would be wavy/curly at the tips, then you could colour that part too and it would look awsome.    If you don't want to cut your hair or straiten all of your hair, you could always straiten streaks of your hair in the front and colour that the colour you want so it would look, like, curly in the back, with side swept bangs in the front with strait sides.    don't be afraid to cut your hair though, lifes to short to not take chances;)|`|0uwyi2Ovaa	This is a good look for curly hair.|`|uDy6zyJPaa	Umm, No. You would have to straighten your hair. Japanese Relaxing your hair makes it straight, but it costs a good $500-$750.  This is my hair, I don't straighten it that often.

rv4Z32VFaa	You have to use the same conditioner as the shampoo in the shower and wash.|`|VvD3UTXgaa	I have extremely curly frizzy hair.  What works best for me is to use a all natural shampoo and conditioner from Henna Hut.  These are NOT leave in products.  Use some of the Frizz-Ease by John Frieda.  Blow dry the hair and use a brush pulling it straight.  Then use the straightener on a low or medium setting.      You may want to think about using a conditioning treatment on it and not the straightner for a few days and let it rest.    Natural Shampoos  http://www.hennahut.com/henna_shampoo|`|Jx15cpRVaa	depending on how long you have been straightnening your hair, you might have permanently fried your hair. it will get better as your hair grows out, but either that, or you just have the type of hair that doesn't like to conform the way you want it to, i have those days all the time.|`|J0UDzMCiaa	Okay, so heres a tip. Ditch the herbal essences! That stuff does absolutely nothing for your hair, try Bumble and Bumble, it smoothes your hair so well.

YOu sound like you are desperate for attention, and are seeking approval from just anyone. This is the worst way for a young teenager to develop self esteem.  Honestly, this tells me your self esteem is so low, that you need constant feedback from anyone.   I'm not saying this to be mean, but even if your bored and just doing this for amusement, there are so many other things you can do to occupy your time than posting your photo and asking strangers for their opinion of you. You are just setting yourself up to be verbally abused, and lied to.   But since you asked, I told. I'm not going to tell you what I think about what you look like, because only you know, because you see yourself in the mirror everyday.

paEcdwQBaa	the sleek look line the above commenter refers to is made by Matrix. they also have sleek look shampoos /conditioners and other styling products. I have very long hair and its naturally wavy/curly/frizzy/heIIish. I've use matrix a few times, but I honestly can't tell the difference between the matrix version and the knock off version. (orange bottle made by suave). usually though I just use a straightening creme (same knockoff line by suave) and the citreshine hair serum before straightening. you straightener is more of a key than the products though. any time you apply heat to your hair (even hot water) you're risking damage. wash your hair in cool water, and get a ceramic straightener ( less abrasive on the actual hairs). determine the coolest setting you can use to achieve the hair you want to make sure you don't over heat.|`|bjguq3Yuaa	Go to a salon and pick up Iron Smoother from Sleek Look (its in an orange bottle). It will probably run around 14 dollars but it is well worth it. As you section your hair to straighten it lightly mist the product on your hair. Ive used this product for 5 years and have very healthy hair. There are similar like products in groceries stores and other stores but they do not work as well or at all.|`|H909dAYGaa	buy a heat protector spray.  i really like the s factor one! they also make your hair shiny! i would avoid the drug store brands though! they should have good ones at any hair salon though!
xUfRRGM8aa	Looks a bit like a fauxhawk and if you take the pic to a decent hair salon that has a slightly punky stylist or two then you should be in good hands. They won't be shy.|`|KjY2pANcaa	an ugly stupid haircut|`|22479221292188a6607f3f3cc2c2b5a1aa	Looks like a long version of faux-hawk.   I suggest your print out this picture and go to a good hair salon. Show it to the stylist and they will cut it for you like that.   It's not TOO different, so I think most stylists would be familiar with it.     All the best.|`|NiFjl37haa	Mohawk|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	Naratu|`|Y3Mxrh2uaa	i would say its a short pixie cut... make sure to tell the stylist you want to be able to style it into a mohawk|`|b2f5cc892d9a2ff6d43172b4bb022096aa	I would go to a really good stylist for a cut like that,,,they will know best if your hair will even handle that style.  SOme hair is too fine, or wavy, etc, and a good stylist is trained to understand all those nuances, and also is more up to date on the latest styles. they go to seminars and take more classes to stay up to date.  Take the picture with you,  that is the absolute positive best way to get what you want.   The stylist will appreciate it, and you will be so glad you just didn't try to find a name to describe what you want.  I think the cut is great by the way !|`|fQuPOe3Haa	its called fohawk i think should be|`|7i6VV9Obaa	That's just like, medium length black hair styled as a faux hawk...|`|bn1Cw4sYaa	No, just tell them you want short layers up top.

5PVFXry8aa	My boyfriend had his ears gauged down to a 2, he had to take it out because he is joining the army, it closed within 5-7 days!|`|zmjAccMFaa	Some say it is a 2g others a 0.  But still it depends on your ears.  If you are really worried about them not closing stick to 2 and below.    If you have any other questions feel free to ask.|`|co9wBPjdaa	i would say a 4,  i had a 8 gauge in mine and it closed fine  but if you want to go higher   but then wnat to close it again  put a smaller one each time until it closes like if you were at a 0  you would take it out and put in a 2 untill it closed aroound it and form there work down until a 14 or 16|`|WLuEIwp5aa	It definitely depends on how well you take care of your lobes while you're stretching, but I would say that as long as you don't rip them up bad, you'll be able to get them back down to normal size from a 2g or so.  If you're worried about it, don't go bigger than 2g, but if you take super good care and do vitamin e oil massages while you're stretching, you could probably come back down from larger sizes than that.    And it does also depend on the person, everybody's body is different.
nbWO3IANaa	1] It woud be more accurate with a pic, or if we had a skin tone, but...  for clothing, makeup, and jewelry, try:  soft white  rosy beige  all pinks from light to dark [ hot pink and deep rose best! ]  cherry red, burgundy  light lemon  mint, jade greens  light turquoise*  blues - powder, sky*, royal, smoke, periwinkle, navy  all purples - esp. violet*  cocoa  rose brown  grays  silver or white gold  AVOID: oranges  golds [ mustard color ]  2] For makeup,  a] use shadows that contrast with eye color; and colors that match any color flecks in your eye's iris  b] liner/mascara in navy, charcoal, or espresso brown  c] lip cheek colors in list above|`|5sLnSIoTaa	hot pink and turquoise are good. but you could even go with like a forest green or even kelley green.

Its the back, you know the part where it looks like someone took one whack at your head with a machete.|`|lgubJDN7aa	Okay with your face structure, you actually wouldn't look bad with short hair. I suggest you keep you're hair the same color, move your bangs to the right side of your face and get a nice layered hair cute from your cheek bone down....That would look amazing. I know it, because I'm a haircutter.|`|GSbz9Zq4aa	euuooo thats messed, try this hairstyle:  http://www.latest-hairstyles.com/gallery...|`|tJoFN4Tmaa	I would definately go shorter..your layers are too spread apart.

bYFvotMfaa	Hmmm if he said it around or to you ya, he probably means he wants you to be more so...girlie that is... For me I like my girlfriend the same way.  What defines it for me is this:  *Panties (frilly, lingerie ones.  Granny panties are one, not girlie, and two, not hot)  *Prep time; If she always looks good, and doesn't show up in a hoodie and sweats when I showered, did my hair, and put a button up on, that's "girlie"  *Chivalry( LET him be the man.  LET him be a gentleman.  Too many ladies are over the top in feminist rights and don't let their bf just do nice things like open the car door for them, offer them a jacket, pull out their chair, etc.)  *Giggle.  This is the number one thing, a cute giggle rather than a laugh, with a giddy smile is both girlie and a major turn on  *Finally, Clothing wise try bright colors and a dress or skirt and painted fingernails and what not rather than goth, or baggy guy clothes.|`|79ab2ac723d6fa6d643348f5a67b7e74aa	There are two ideas.  One is a stereotype.  The other is an exaggerated version of the stereotype.    Just think of things associated with girls.  Think of dolls, clothes, attitudes, behaviors, and such.  Waiting for a man to behave as a gentleman, wearing a dress or skirt, crossing your legs are all behaviors associated with feminine actions.    Mostly it's stereotypes.  Consider the phrases, "A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do", and "A man works from sun to sun; but a woman's work is never done."    Accept yourself.  Be yourself.|`|0Z4tqTIMaa	being retarded, and stupid. just look like a cute 15 year old. make up, hair, skirt, tight shirt.. maybe|`|C2sZREuAaa	our clevage showing|`|xgui1LAFaa	y change for some1 whos obviously an ***|`|XsLj9jERaa	bubbly  cheerful  usually has head in the clouds  might be clumsy  loves pink and cute stuff  happy-go-lucky  optomistic  youthful persona    but dont change yourself for a guy. :)|`|2oN7WrVKaa	Its not all about makeup, and hair.

Hs9RVG1gaa	foundation and primer are two completely different things, like mascara and lip gloss. primer goes on before foundation but its not completely necessary, especially if u are young with flawless skin. concealer is for spots, dark circles, scars, etc. then comes foundation. foundation can be either liquid, pressed powder, or loose powder.  there is even airbrushing foundation. but thats another story!  just experiment and u will figure out what works best for you.|`|5f4df7a0d6349251e2eb823b66ee0625aa	they might seems the same but they are not. Foundation can be in liquid form or powder form it is used all over the face to cover any blemishes, imperfections, scars, etc. Primer is almost like a feather light serum that you put on before your foundation, it fills in any fine lines and wrinkles on the face so when you put ur foundation on top your skin feels smooth and flawless. Concealer can be worn on undereye circles to hide dark circles or it can also be dabbed on to hide blemishes. pressed powder pretty much just sets your foundation so it lasts longer.|`|0vfTitxAaa	concealer hides or conceals blemishes and is usually put on before foundation. foundation smooths out the tone or color of the face. and pressed powder is optional. and if you have dry skin you may want to skip because it might look cakey. it really to soak up the oils and stop the shine :)|`|aU5vUcWLaa	if you mean a primer for your eye lid......primer is different...it won't crease. but if you know how to make it work you could use concealer/foundation just don't use too much... just a little bit for the shadow/pigment to stick to. i use concealer/foundation/primer on my lids and they all work no matter which you choose, i'm not a proffesional so it doesn't bother me. but really.......it's up to you! lots of people do experiments on youtube, maybe try out what you already have  =]
AA10597018	The answer all depends on a question to you---    What are you dying your eyelashes WITH?    If you used hair color don't do it again.    If you went to a professional and they used eyelash tint, you have no problem.  It is a vegatable based dye and will not cause any of the problems that have been mentioned. Yes, you can do this every 4 to 6 weeks.|`|AA11084157	Hi... its me Boo.  I love your eyelashes this way....keep dying them|`|5a5974e11dd4afa4b8e0ba5158c702c1aa	Use clear mascara or regular mascara instead...it's probably cheaper and it's worriless|`|34837b4e317f4f2fd044eb4aad865a18aa	I think they will fall out.

Just use mascara.|`|1305eaaccc1ba1b4ed0fad38a048292daa	its very dangerous to dye your eyelash or eyebrows b/c you run the risk of the dye getting into your eye. it can cause blindness. i suggest just finding the color of mascara you want  and use it daily it will have the same effect with out the risks.|`|AA11835829	dobt and nope, better using fake eyelashesd flashy one or orange color|`|c4b9a1d3831e04a0976f7f7e7b04f6c0aa	ahh dont dye your eyelashes a bunch. thats scary. just use mascara i mean thats pretty simple. but seriously if you dye your eyelashes they would probably fall out. you arent supposed to dye them. you dont want to end up without eyelashes do you? youd look pretty weird.|`|b943238e4aad3bbfdf73219229b0761caa	Sooo, when they grow out they'll be blonde again...do you plan on doing this every 4-6 weeks?

I am a hair dresser here in New York, and I love it.  I use it myself whenever I decide to grow my hair out, because if it doesn't grow quickly then I end up getting boroed and cut my hair, and then I end up regretting it.  It can only be purchased in professional salons, and is a bit expensive but trust me it is well worth it.  Outside of professional products, I have always been told gelatin works wonders.  Because your hair and nails are protein, anything rich in protein will help.  When I was younger I used to take one package of plain Knox gelatin and mix it in a glass or Orange Juice.  It is supposed to make your hair and nails grow faster.  I also always thought when I was younger when I ate a lot of peanut butter, that my hair seemed to grow faster.  Hope this helps.
yrWagEqqaa	You can get a malibu every month or 2. It strips the buildup from your hair and in between treatments, use a clarifying shampoo.     Ask any stylist for a malibu or go to Sally's beauty supply.

The key to any good hairstyle (especially with frizzy hair ) is Product.. Use a paste on your hair.. Something that is a bit more sticky.

AA12368457	It's really easy to tell for some bags if they are fake. Look at the quality of the bag the print. There are extra details on bags such as markings or charms that you wont find on the fake bags. Your best bet is to spend money on a real bag. If you are willing to put down money for a fake just buy a real one. Designer bags in classic prints can be worn for a long time since it is there signature print and style and it never changes.

afab6b496cc4cf44dee95f839b81ef1daa	The salon I used to work at was awesome! They were so nice and understanding. Hmm I'm trying to think of how I can put this. There were 5 stylists and they all did not work every single day and if there was a time that didnt work for them then they dealt with the clients who would be very understanding because they've been going there for years. It wasnt a problem to go away, or leave early, or come in late... just as long as you took care of your clients and that they knew and werent expecting you. The one stylist made a good chunk of money because she hardly let anytime in between and she booked as much as she can without screwing herself which got her busy and a lot of clients which brought in a lot of money.  This was a private salon. I'm sure chains would be different. Maybe you could have it to fall back on and remember not all salons are the same. If you actually try it, try different places and keep an openmind youre going to deal with lots of people and if you're not happy at one place you cant assume the next place is gonna be the same.

The key to growing your hair is to treat it with a lot of care. Our hair is fragile anyway but when you have two different textures on 1 strand (relaxed with natural roots) it is even more fragile.     Deep condition twice a month, keep your ends trimmed, use minimal heat and don't wear tight braids or micro braids. My individual braids were never micros.  I also ate a balanced diet and to biotin.    You can't use the same products on your natural hair that you used on your permed hair so, you have to educate yourself on what products to look for and what ingredients to stay away from.     There's a lot of good info on growing out relaxers here:  http://www.nappturality.com/index.php    There's even a forum for people transitioning out of relaxers.

Attention is something that is very imperative to the female psyche and the more they get, the more they crave.

xsrr9yifaa	lots of the vintage shops in london are pretty pricey. Three that i go to regularly are Rockit in covent garden (just of neal street), pop boutique on monmouth street (also really close to neal street) and beyond retro on great marlborough street. there are also a couple of earlham street and mercer street in covent garden but they cost a bit more. both rockit and Beyond retro have a huge selection and another big shop near brick lane as previous person said.    Also good is portobello market on a friday and saturday but you might end up paying a bit more there too but you can always haggle. Camden and Greenwich also worth a look if you have the time.|`|agmlB2bPaa	I cannot stress enough how important it is that you go to Brick Lane. It's really close to Liverpool Street station and pretty easy to get to.    It's a whole street full of nothing but vintage shops the whole way down, both sides. It's seriously amazing.    As well as that, although I can't imagine why you'd need any more shops, the very bottom floor of the giant TopShop on Oxford Street has a very large vintage section.

If your young just don't worry about boys they will come unexpectedly.|`|3zh5wsEzaa	That sounds like a question I would have asked a little while ago... Well here's the answer: It depends on the guy. If your at school, and you see a guy you like, make sure you look okay. Put a little lip gloss on. Go up to the guy and say hi. Go from there. If it's a guy you see at the mall, say your friends ditched you and you want to shop with someone and your willing to go to any stores. If it's a guy you see at a carnival, bounce around screaming "COOL HAIR!!!!!" (it sounds crazy, but that's gotten me a date before.) If its a guy you see at a dance club, start dancing by him, and tell him hes a good dancer, and ask him what his name is. Go from there. Good luck!|`|Y0MpSTkXaa	Build up confidence and walk with your head held up high as you walk around.  Dressing nice is crucial. There are those people that say "I don't dress to impress" and end up wearing unmatched clothing, or just horrible looking things. Sure it may be super comfortable.. but the dating game is a competition.. if you don't try you won't get anywhere.  -This DOESN'T mean showing as much as you can or wearing the shortest of the shortest skirts and shirts.. While this will definitely attract male attention, more often that not it isn't the kind you want in the long run.  Flirt.. If you find a guy you like.. catch eyes, flirt around, play coy, you know the drill as a girl.. drives guys up the walls.. but don't go overboard! Don't flirt with every guy who walks past! Same as above, it'll attract the wrong crowd.    As well, you're probably being noticed more than you know.. you're just not aware of it.      Gentle perfume (nothing intoxicating) and the appropriate makeup to bring out your features are always bonuses    I find, personally as a male the best perfume to be a low-key but sweet scent. Something that tingles the senses but doesn't say "HEY! I'M WEARING PERFUME!".|`|AA11483458	Confidence.     Studies have shown time and again that the most effective quality a female can have to attract the attention of the opposite sex is radiant self-assurance. It's a common misconception that the reason guys seem so preoccupied with the "popular" girls has something to do with status, wealth, beauty, accessories, or a band of devotees. Wrong. Any girl can rival the most attractive and popular by just being confident in her own skin. The mystery of why you don't bow and surrender is intriguing, both in high school and throughout life, it'll come to be your best friend.    Bear in mind, however, that confidence does not mean attitude. Being dramatically "diva" is not an equivalent of healthy self-esteem. Once you've mastered this, realize that it isn't about receiving attention. It's about the type of attention you receive and the quality of boy you're receiving it from.     Before you begin worrying about grabbing the eye of some random guy, make a list of every quality that you'd like to see in the ideal boyfriend. Use this as criteria and accept nothing less. Know your worth (and don't grow up too fast).     Good luck, hun!  : )|`|5uuFOn5Naa	Be Your Self,  You shouldn't have to pretend to be someone your not.  He should like you for you. And if he asks you to change, i suggest you leave. You don't need to be a **** show led or anything like that. yea you will get attention but in the wrong way. and that's when they only want you so they can get in your pants. so please be yourself and love it. Don't be ashamed to stand out in your own way. talk to him with respect don't just through your self out there. yea you could flirt, but don't make it seem like you want some. just be you, your beautiful just the way you are !|`|BRS6eEcEaa	attitude is the answer|`|PhTKb3JUaa	confidence;|`|W8Ket9DKaa	Wear eye make-up!|`|CJwioqPsaa	show some skin|`|tqnd46WOaa	dress as a nun|`|CQjgMbewaa	talk to them and don't act like a ****?|`|ErHby7QNaa	walk around in the nude, works every time|`|ZrYALQ4vaa	look cut shirts and short skirts 
t3BuTYB7aa	I'm so sorry, that is an awful thing to happen.    I totally love the idea of the tattoo :) and the fact that it makes u smile everytime u saw it in biro, I think it could work.    Speak to a good tattoo artist, maybe if it does come off easy cos of location, then could u have it retouched?    Hope so, and I hope this helps the grieving process :)|`|4zQEvzCsaa	I think it's a beautiful idea, however I wouldn't get it on the palm. If it were me, I'd prefer it on the forearm or even on my ankle, where I could still see it, but that's just me (I hate even having writing on my palm!).|`|TRgc8Wvwaa	If you like it, get it. Much better than going to a shop, looking through the folders and saying "I'll have that". :)|`|UYnZtJ2daa	I am totally keen on the idea - but you're probably going to have to find another spot. Most tattoo artists won't tattoo palms - because they come in contact with so much stuff they are hard to heal and fade easily.|`|0UYJkSuZaa	I'm very sorry for your loss. It is a very sweet idea. But you may want to reconsider the location of your tattoo. The palm is very sensitive and is visible to everyone all the time. Employers may not like it. You may want to think of other possible choices of the body, like the inside of your wrist(can easily be covered), actually right where your heart is on your chest. or on your stomach (close to the area your baby was inside you for the 6 weeks of its short life). It's your decision though. Do what you feel is the right thing ot do.|`|Kru3PZbkaa	I think it's a very good idea for a tattoo.  The only problem I have is with the placement.  I understand the symbolism of "holding him," but palm tattoos can be in issue where employment is concerned.  When you reach out to shake the hand of a potential employer, they may see it.  What if your job involves using your hands and clients will see it?  Tattoos are still not accepted across the board, and might cause issues later.  Perhaps put the tattoo on your chest, over your heart, where it could be covered with clothing.|`|3Qa3pewcaa	It's up to you and how you feel.  If you feel strong about it then yes.      Only you can answer this question.|`|PoTThoNLaa	I'm sorry for your loss,  but I don't like the tattoo Idea,  it sounds kind of corny and doesn't do what you went through justice.      Just like when kids write RIP and their friends name, it seems a little trite.    Your idea to get a tattoo to remember is a good one, but the infinity symbol is overused.    |`|pMefxF3vaa	Draw the symbol on your skin with a pen everyday for a few weeks and see if you like having it on you all the time, to decide whether to get the tatoo|`|6zblh7Tiaa	Good idea but bad placement, the palm and the sole of your foot are used more than anything and the tattoo won't last the way it should and most artists will tell you that. Look at Jesse James's pay up sucka tattoo on his palm, didn't last.|`|EIY0GOGgaa	I think you should do it and in the exact spot you want. It has  significance. Also, it will be a symbol of your strength. I think you are very brave for what you have endured and it doesn't sound like an obsession at all. It's a very difficult thing to go through, but what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. So kudos to you for your strength and continuous love for your baby.|`|uM7JOSZdaa	palms do not hold color. tattoo artists when new practice on their palms because ink will only stay about a month, give or take. anywhere hair does not grow is a hard place to keep ink. such as fingers, toes, and sometimes wrists, and bottoms of feet. just a heads up not to waste your money.|`|2wJRHGRdaa	oh my God Im going to cry..   My fiance passed 4 months ago, and my miscarriage happened 1 month after. . .    ]*:      get it. its perfect. |`|bTnhTR8uaa	Sorry to hear about your loss.    If you want it on your palm, be prepared to get it touched up A LOT.  Its' not going to stay.  The hands and feet, especially palms and bottoms, will not keep ink because the skin reproduces too quickly.  Even if you manage to heal it in good, you'll get areas that wear away leaving you with a blotchy mess.  Really not worth it.  Put it on the inside of your wrist maybe, so you can see it just as easily.  :)  |`|QLN8kh7Jaa	bad idea, you should get it some place that can be covered up by clothing|`|pUBOnD9aaa	yes thats very sweet.

You are in a lot of pain right now and grieving, which may not be the best time to make a decision.  Please wait until a little time has passed and then think about this again.  I personally think that you will never forget what happened, but in the future you won't want to think about this every day and have to look at a reminder of this tragedy on a daily basis.  The saying that time heals our wounds is something I have thankfully found to be very true in my own life, and I am also thankful that I don't keep reminders around me of all the painful experiences I have had to live through.  If I did, I would probably end up going crazy from the pain.  So please give this some thought and perhaps you will find a way to commemorate your unborn child and your loss through a ceremony you design or through another type of memorial.  And when you have healed from this physically and emotionally, I hope that you will emerge strong and able to create the family of your dreams.  I will keep you in my thoughts.|`|UponCMpYaa	what about close to ur heart!|`|AA10883558	if it makes u that happy u should def. get it in hope that u will be blessed with another babby|`|BGiQcGCPaa	good idea

AA12229839	if you curl your hair with an iron, then wrap the curls up in your fingers and pin it to your head (your hair will form a circle) to cool it should hold better without product. i would use a large barrel ceramic curling iron.    it's easier to use both hands and "roll" the curl up. a single bobby pin will hold it, but some people like putting one on the top of the circle and one on the bottom. let it sit for a few minutes until it cools then take it down.|`|2BhDBYDPaa	Hot Curling Iron la Doh nobody hair stays like that unles your a person of color!|`|Z0DmVnxNaa	get a larger barreled curling iron    when curling your hair, instead of curling it like normal, wrap your hair around the barrel when it is closed.    thats how you get those curls...  hope i helped.    use A LITTLE hairspray to make it stay.|`|Q7SIRZbLaa	ull probably have to straighten then curl, or just curl it.

jqZ9IZjOaa	Oil free face powder/ foundation can still make you break- out. Not because of the foundation itself but because dry skin can also become spotty.  You should go to the shop and test them on your skin...  Try getting some mineral foundation/ powder instead.  Also if you keep your skin in top condition (clean and moist) you are less like likely to have break-outs regardless of what you put on it.  Whatever product you decide to use in the end make sure that your applicators are cleaned regularly to avoid bacteria forming.|`|f1958dce4135a2864bf4bbbc09a66a86aa	Often times the pure fact that you are putting this stuff on your face is clogging up your pores.

w9fyt27aaa	You should go to a hair professional, they'll know what's right for your hair. Or you could maybe try to put some highlights in there, so the top of your head matches the rest of it until you can get it fixed. Then again I don't know if it would be too good for your hair. Just try to wear a hat until you can fix it.|`|ITMUqdzOaa	definitely no!!!!! you'll over do your hair, causing it to become frizzy and dry. Unless that's the look your going for. But you should wait at least 6 weeks or so, and then get some color stripping stuff from a drug store, and follow the directions. then dye your hair the color you want. i dyed my hair black, and i'm naturally blonde, and it turned brown, so i took the color out and went back to my natural color. but i would wait... it's not healthy for your hair.
IMOKF6alaa	If your extensions are not human hair then no you have to buy new ones. but if you have human hair extensions then yes you just have to dye it or bleach it its human hair so what ever you can do to your hair you can do to the other hair, but the more you change the color of the extensions the worse the hair will get. so dont change it too much.|`|GTYYogMNaa	if you need extensions  http://horrorkidz.com/  Ive ordered from them several times, and no one can compare to them.   they are just amazing!    ive tried etsy, hairhxc and hottopic. lol and i personally think horrorkidz is the best quality you can get.|`|iCLGHUdQaa	If it's real hair, they should be able to dye them just like they did your "real" hair.

FkQhzG1Waa	maybe skip the hairspray.  save it for last.|`|M2EKtjIbaa	Just put mousse in after towel drying at night after shower, dry hair, in morning, add more mouse. Hairspray is bad for dry hair!|`|X2lesqhRaa	That definately wont work!!!  Heres a few tips...  1:Wash your scalp with conditioner, do not use shampoo.You can conditioner wash once or twice a week.  2: Never ever brush your hair, A wide comb or your hands are fine Just steer clear of all brushes.  3:Give your hair time to adjust. It takes 2-4 weeks for your hair to adjust to the no shampoo. It may even look worse at first. Hair is a long-term project and it may take a couple weeks for it to regain its health after being stripped of moisture for years by shampoo  4:Do the final rinse of your hair with cool or cold water. This will decrease frizz and add shine. Leave some conditioner in your hair, especially in dry sections like the ends. It is fine to run your fingers through your hair gently, but do not comb your hair after this point.  5: It's ok to use some products. Look for ones with no alcohol. Use them while your hair is wet only. Dont overload. Steer clear of as many chemicals as you can, try organic substances.  6:Get your hair thinned at a good solan. get layered haircuts. Ask the stylist for tips.  7:My favorite and most effectful. Hair oil you can find it in various international stores. If you only shop at wal-mart and stuff look for baby oil, will work just as good.  8:Use heat protecters before flat ironing wont damage at all.  9:Braid your hair before you sleep will keep the frizz away  10:Just tye it back, its a great times for a new style, but only if it looks good on you.  11: Dont be too afraid of volume Some people would kill for curly, volumized hair.  12: Suggested brands Chi and Bedhead|`|DoSRzU5Faa	hey! i have extremely curly hair and i do the same thing. my hairstylist told me to use leave in conditioner. i know it would be wierd to not use hairpray cause that is sometimes the only thing that works. but use leave in conditioner. it works great.|`|OBuzcIDbaa	My daughters have dry, coarse, curly hair like yours.  The best thing you can do is use products just for curly hair.  They start with good shampoo & conditioner, towel dry, then put on a combo of leave-in conditioner, curling styling gel, and shining serum that smooths frizzies, then scrunch. They don't blow dry. It dries out your hair. It's better to let it air dry. If it needs help holding it's shape you can end with hair spray. Good Luck!

You should go to college, because you never know what your future situation may be. In time, it would be great to be a beautician, but most likely you will have a husband who makes a fair amount, or you may just be doing it as a hobby once you've settled down. Its a great profession, just not one to depend upon.
HZ7Dlz3kaa	yes it can and it probably will.  your hair will stay lighter, but your rots will grow in, and you will be able to see the different colors - unless you keep your hair buzzed and you wont notice the difference.  i have very long hair, and it's a pain in the butt trying to keep it one color once the summer is over.  you can see the bottom part of my hair is lighter from the sun if i don't dye it|`|Y3dFm6uGaa	Your hair will only turn lighter for as long as it is exposed to the sun.

idhcqr5Daa	Exfoliate your whole face and body. Use a daily lotion that has AHA (an exfoliating ingredient) and use it daily for one or two weeks in advance for soft, and exfoliated skin.   Next you should apply moisturizer so your skin is in good condition.   Apply your self-tanner daily. Choose one that goes with your skin color: light for fair skin, light/medium for skin that burns then turns tan, medium for normal tan skin, and deep dark for those with a naturally dark complexion (people of "color"). Put on a pair of gloves and start rubbing a small amount evenly over face and body.   Let your skin fully dry before putting on clothes, getting in bed, or going in the pool/shower.   If you end up with missed spots, spray that spot with a spray-on tanner.   If it is too dark in one area use a lightening product such as lemon, toothpaste, strawberries, etc. or buy a tanning correcter/remover.   Go to the beach and flaunt that tan that won't give you skin cancer like all the other sun-bathing babes out there in the harmful rays. People will wonder how in the world you do it!   Lightly dab the tanner on knees, ankles, and elbows. These rough, dry areas soak in the tanner a lot more than other areas, making it appear much darker.   It will last between 3 days and week.   Moisturize a LOT to make it last as long as possible.   Use only as directed! If it is for legs, use it on legs. If it is for body, use it on body. If it is for face, use it on your face!!! Never use one on the wrong area!!   If you mess up, pour lemon juice onto a cotton swab and use it to fix any mistakes.   False tan lotion will always turn out darker because it's a heavier texture, but false tan mousse is easier to apply because it's lighter  Check ingredients of tanning products before buying just in case you are allergic to any ingredients.   Using false tan products on sensitive skin can resolve in irritation and rashes. Do a patch test first.   Never mix 2 different tanning products. If certain chemicals are mixed they can burn skin.     x0x0_LEi|`|4SyINs07aa	use a really natural looking spray tan or a tone darker from your usual foundation if the sun does not work for you|`|YZidVwYBaa	Urban Decay has a really good self tanner.

You know what a tan is, right?  It's a warning from your body that you are getting too much sun.  Get some good foundation, darker then your usual skin.  Every two weeks, darken the shade a bit.

idhcqr5Daa	The best solution is to see a dermatologist. They know what they're doing. All they do is look at your acne and order some medicine for it then you must buy it and the acne disappears within a week.   After using any of the above-recommended acne medications (benzoyl peroxide, etc.), be sure to apply a gentle moisturizer over it in case you have sensitive skin.   Tinted moisturizer works well to cover pimples up, but this DOES NOT mean you have full sun protection.   Make sure all the products you use are non comedogenic or non acnedemic. This mean that it does not clog pores.   Use any daily wash acne treatment regularly in the morning and night. It is better to use brand names like Avon or Mary Kay since they have perfected their techniques over the years, and are sold worldwide for something.   Drink Water.   Stop the Spread of Acne - Apply acne medication about half an inch around the affected area to help keep the acne from spreading. Acne moves across the face from the nose to the ear, so you need to treat beyond the inflamed area. Most people make the mistake of treating only the pimples and not the outlying areas of skin. This is wrong.   Wash your pillowcase often and always use clean face towels. Dirty towels and pillowcases can harbor bacteria and germs that can make acne worse.   Put some baking soda into your cleanser to take out all the oil in your pores. Only do this 3 times a week.   Try to prevent over-exposure to sunlight. Over-exposure to sunlight can dry out the skin and cause breakouts. If you are out in the sunlight very often, use a suncreen, preferably spf 35+.   Sunburn increases the risk of skin cancer considerably!   Do not use too many different types of acne medication at the same time. It can cause more irritation and increase your acne.ex. dryness,painful to the touch, peeling...   Consult a doctor if your acne is open or bleeding.   Consider seeing a doctor as well if the acne has become cystic or highly inflamed. If you do not treat cystic acne there is a high chance of it scarring your face.   Benzoyl peroxide-based products usually bleach hair and fabrics. Be extremely careful using them around brightly colored or dark colored fabrics, as you can end up with ruined towels and shirts. (You may want to only use white towels and sheets while using these products).   Make sure you are not allergic to products/ingredients mentioned in this article before using them.   Be careful with what prescriptions you take! Some oral prescriptions, including Accutane and similar products, can cause irreversible liver damage. Talk to your doctor or dermatologist before taking them.   At the fitness center is where you can get tons of nasty acne; always wear gloves and use lotion.   Don't buy multi-step "active" style solutions. If you read the labels, they contain the same active ingredients that other over-the-counter acne medications contain: salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, or sulfur.     x0x0_LEi|`|T7z68YDTaa	you can use honey on your face it helped my sister. put the honey on your face and leave it on for 10 to 15 minutes then rinse it.|`|438be6a17f9eda0e2f3d35a0b4b69268aa	well im using proactiv also, i have tried it twice, the first time it worked and now this time its not. neutrogena has a new product out called skin id. its about $39.95. i dont know how well it works but maybe you could try it.|`|iNyJm0Vbaa	put on (non mint) toothpaste on spots you want. you can either put a band aid over that, or just wash it off after 10 min.  really works!!

I had the same problems and within a few days, the texture of my skin changed.  Perfectly clear now, except for usually one zit a month, like clockwork.  It's affordable (I buy it at Costco, like 1L for $16).  Don't buy the store brand stuff that LOOKS like the same bottle.  I did that and it is a different product and my skin broke out again, but once I bought the Spectro Gel again, back to clear skin.  Good luck!  Ifyou use too much exfoliant, you'll strip your skin making it red and more susceptible to breakouts since your oil glands will go into overdrive.  Scrub gently once a week using the Spectro-Gel and a half-tsp of sugar. Gently cleanse skin til the sugar has dissolved and you'll be pleasantly surprised.

0hJacvb9aa	well im just a year younger than you are and so far have had my lip pierced 5 times (now i have 2 vertical labrets)  and ill be 100% honest, it was the least painful piercing except for my tongue.  it was actually my first piercing i had with a needle, being the right side of my lip.  i was holding onto my mom for dear life and he clamped it, said to take a deep breath in and he would peirce on the count of 3. i honest to didn't feel it go in, i had to ask him if it was done or not, he said it was and i was shocked.|`|hOVzviFIaa	Here is my advice. I have had my lip pierced twice, so I have had a good experience AND a bad experience :)    It is not unbearable, the only issue is that the piercing is in your mouth so it is easy to play with it and irritate it. Ask for a labret stud, NOT a ring. The ring is curved inside your lip and causes a longer healing period and chapped lips, and an awful situation overall.    The pain lasts for about a week, just take some advil, drink a lot of water, and you'll do great|`|bNlL6PrZaa	i've had my lip peirced two years and it's all about your pain treshold. personally, it was like a small pinch and over really fast. it didn't hurt, but it was a lot of work. you have to constantly clean and steralize it. it's worth it if you really want it. :) goodluck!|`|AA11399343	it doesnt hurt to get it done. just a quick pinch. however you walk around with ghetto lip for a few hours. mine didnt actually swell but it sure felt like it did. thats b/c your not used to having something there. my friend had a swollen lip but she is the only one i know who had that happen. leaves a scar tho so so thats also something to think about...
1oJtJCaWaa	If you're naturally dark skinned and are pale, do you work indoors and stay out of natural light?  I'm not saying you should tan, but doctors suggest natural morning sun light to even infants.  If you are not a morning person, you should try full spectrum lamps.  They are inexpensive and you can find them at office supply stores or pet stores.    Another thing, have you seen the doctor to test for anemia? Some of the symptoms for anemia are fatigue, irregular menstruation, pale skin, easy bruising and black outs.

If it's under $1000 you might not want to go- those people might not be qualified. :)|`|T8CHurVaaa	Its called the sun.|`|idhcqr5Daa	Tan in your own backyard. It's cheaper. All you need is your tanning lotion, oil, or spray and a beach chair or towel. Position the chair or towel in the yard where the sun will hit you directly.   Wear sunscreen when you tan! If you are just going to sit on the beach and tan for an hour put SPF 30 on. If you don't use sunscreen while tanning, UVA and UVB rays will still harm your skin, even if you don't get burned! If you don't wear sunscreen you'll also get a fake, red-orange tan that NOBODY wants. Unfortunately, you rarely notice it on yourself so keep out an owl eye. Use sunscreen chap stick also. And make sure you apply your sunscreen out of the sun and let it soak in for 20-25 minutes before you go into the sun.   Wear the swimsuit you will wear when you are swimming! It is not classy to have lots of complex tan lines all over your back, screaming "I NEVER WEAR THIS BATHING SUIT- I TAN IN ANOTHER!" That's just fake. Wear the same swimsuit so you have a smooth, buttery tan that flows from skin to bathing suit.   Wear the swimsuit color that brings out your tan. If you have no tan, wear dark greens, blues, and purples to attempt to hide it more. If you have a moderate tan, wear black or white, to accent your tan. If you are exactly where you want to be, and really tan, wear any color you want. You are TAN and nothing will hide it! Show off a bit, you've earned it.   Moisturize. After you've tanned, be sure to moisturize your skin. It will help keep your skin healthy and will prevent it from becoming flaky from the sun.   Consider using self tanner which is safer and gives you a real looking tan. Make sure to find one that does not make you look orange.   If it's your first time going to a tanning booth, don't go for very long; talk to the cashier about the recommended length.   If you stay out in the sun too long, you could be in danger of heatstroke.   Tanning can cause skin cancer, so be careful to regulate how often you tan! Tanning every day isn't good for you! Also, keep track of any moles, and watch for changes in color or shape.   Start with a short time in the sun, say 10 minutes / day for sensitive skin. If you see no problems you can gradually increase your time in the sun. In case of red spots or itching take a few days break from tanning.   Be careful when exposing new areas of skin to direct sunlight  Sunburns can be anywhere from 1st degree burns to 3rd degree burns. If you get burned very badly, see a doctor immediately!   Extensive tanning/exposure to Ultraviolet (UV) radiation could cause you to get skin cancer, which in its worst form is called Melanoma. (Using a spray tan IS more safe. If you must be colored and don't care if you turn slightly orange, you could save your life.)   Using sun beds, as with all forms of Ultraviolet exposure, can be dangerous. If you can not tan easily because you are naturally pale, do not go to extremes to tan.     x0x0_LEi

fMl5hjtMaa	Tip  1: Make sure nails are super clean Natural oils on your nails aid in chipping. Even if your nails are polish-free, apply polish remover to get rid of oils on the surface of nails.     Tip  2: Prep nails with a base coat Polish will adhere best to nails prepped with a base coat like Opi Nail Treatment Start to Finish. Here's a list of great base polishes at every price:          Tip  3: Don't lay on the polish too thick Three to four thin coats of polish rather than 2 thick coats will last longer, cut down on drying time and cause fewer changes of bubbles brewing on your nails.     Tip  4: Don't forget the tip When polishing, polish the tip of the nail as well. This helps cut down on nail polish chipping.     Tip  5: Consider a shimmery color. The little particles of sparkle will help polish cling to your nails.     Tip  6: Apply a clear topcoat Topcoat helps extend the life of your manicure. You can use the base coat as a topcoat. Do brush topcoat on and around the edges of nails as well, it's an extra seal against chipping.     Tip  7: Allow proper drying time Make sure you give your nails a good 45 minutes drying time before handling objects. Once dry time is over, submerge nails in cold water then apply lotion. This allows for a slippery surface until nails are completely dry. For pedicures, wrap toes in plastic wrap if you're wearing shoes other than flip-flops or sandals.    Tip  8: Keep topcoat handy To prolong the life of your manicure, apply a topcoat every other day.|`|3cwY3Lcpaa	Your usuing a cheap brand of nail polish, or your just not taking good care of your nails.

c398e7ae6f2789a3d3c5f715afc652a3aa	I no longer draw out my designs, instead I pretty much use practice fabric and try and make it look like what's in my mind.  Usually, it works.    Small scale (18" doll) design: http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v147/A...    Human-scale design (for an 8 year-old girl's Halloween costume, inspired by a gown worn by the late Princess Diana): http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v147/A...     All I can say is if you want to be a fashion designer, it's way more than just drawing a picture.  It involves knowing how to use a pattern to cut fabric, learning how to draft (make) a pattern from scratch, and then most importantly, knowing *how* to sew.  Not just how to use a machine, but what way is best to cut the fabric, cut with the grain, or cut on the bias.  Knowing what a French seam is and what kind of fabric is best for that or when it's best to finish a seam by serging it.    Start learning how to sew.  Seriously.  Raid the bargain fabrics at Wal Mart, JoAnn's, Hancocks, etc and practice, practice, practice. Once you have a better understanding of how to put fabric together, you'll be able to become a better designer.  You'll make lots of mistakes starting out, learn from them.  You make a few mistakes no matter how good you do end up getting, and that's a part of the process.    As someone who's had several "designers" shadow me at work, nothing is more aggravating than a "designer" who is unwilling to learn how to sew.|`|IIpEaDCcaa	no|`|c68XWGltaa	Why don't you work on being a grammar designer so we can understand wtf you're talking about.|`|xvXbVCeJaa	I think you do fashion designer by getting him all liquored up and then asking if he wanted to "experiment".|`|AA10993798	uhm i never knew that fashion designer was a verb now...i always thot it was a noun...(its a job)    i think u mean do u kno how to fashion design?    anyways if thats ur question, i do.  i draw clothes...i dont actually make them tho.|`|zpovg4U7aa	you're using fashion designer as a verb, but a fashion designer is actually a person who does the physical act of designing clothes. fashion design is the actual term you are looking for. i am an aspiring fashion designer, and have done a lot of sketches but unfortunately i dont really like to showcase my sketches online for privacy reasons.    if you learn to draw a proportionate model figure and put some creativity into it to draw garments onto the model, you can do some things at home. but i would recommend that you look into classes, sewing, sketching, basic arts classes. good luck :)|`|rKHUhaAAaa	Hi, eri!

zzkmdusEaa	Well my advice    Say you are wanting a cross, I think the perfect size would be from the center of your back going to the middle of each shoulder blade, that isn't comically huge but it also can be quite an attention grabber.    If you want an exact size that would be good for you, go down to your local tattoo parlour and consult with the artist. Here some of his ideas and suggestions and if he was a legit tattoo artist, he will be more than obliged to help you pick the tattoo that is right for you.    But, also think you have two whole years left to get a tattoo. Yes, while you definitely should use this time to consider this tattoo, you definitely should not let dedicate your thinking processes to this tattoo. Your idea will more than likely change, I know mine did a LOT. But in March I finally turn 18 and the tattoo i'm getting..well lets say I did months of planning for it, only like 4 or 5. I hung the picture of the tattoo that inspired mine on my wall with other pictures for changes, and not once did I get tired of looking at it.    Just wait bud, get it when you know you are ready. Don't get it now and don't let it get to your head. You are only 15, you got other stuff you need to worry about. Start considering a tattoo when you are closer to 18 and don't get one until you are mature enough to make the committment. Don't do it at home or with a friend, an infection is not fun, google image a tattoo infection, if you are considering a home made one, those pictures will make you REconsider...guaranteed. Not only that but having a friend do it or a nonproffessional tattoo artist will almost ensure that you have crappy ink on you forever, the picture will be faded and mediocre.    Good luck, and keep searching.|`|edzU8VJiaa	There is no ideal size - don't have one!    Apart from the girls with their own "tramp stamps", no girl really likes them.

I don't know exactly how long/wide your back is, but it's a good idea to get tattoos that are proportional to the part of your body you're getting them on; otherwise they look sort of funny. If you're not into getting a whole back piece (a tattoo that spans your entire back), i would suggest you get a tattoo that maybe either stretches across your shoulder blades or goes down 3/4ths of your back. another option would be to get a tattoo that crawls up one side of your back onto your shoulder. Those usually look really pretty, and they leave room for additions.|`|5WWxMD5Saa	If you look at these they are about middle sized, anything above this size i would class as Big, i Have bigger tho.

idhcqr5Daa	Avoid exposing your skin to direct sunlight.   Use any good sunblock while going out.   Drink plenty of clean water regularly.   Watch your diet. Include healthy fruits and vegetables.   Wash your face to keep it clean.   Use some good skin whitening cream. Lemon juice with a bit of yogurt once a day is an excellent mild bleach.   Use turmeric: grind up "face turmeric" with olive oil and chickpea flour   Pour Some Milk Into A Bowl, Grab A Towel Dip It In The Bowl And Spread It Around Your Face. ( Its A Natural Skin Whitener )   Cut a lemon into 2 halves. Rub it gently on your face and neck. Wash it after 10-20 minutes. Doing it regularly will cleanse your skin.   Using masks made from flour, or finely ground grams [pulses], can make your skin shine. Just add some milk, apply on skin and wash after 15 minutes.   Milk is a natural skin whitener. Apply milk on your face. Wash it after some time.   Skin-whitening creams can damage the skin if left on for too long, so use with discretion.   While using any cosmetic product, if you feel irritation in skin, stop using it. Always prefer good skin products.   Do not use products containing hydroquonine.

idhcqr5Daa	Liquid eyeliner comes in a bottle rather like ink, and you must use a separate brush to apply. Some come with one. The best result will come from a point liner brush.   Liquid eyeliner should only be used above the top lashes (unless you are going for a very harsh, dramatic look). Also it is difficult not to get it in your eye. It is best to use a pencil or eyeshadow under the lower lashes.   You do not need to try and paint a continuous line with liquid eyeliner. It is actually easier to paint a few small dashes onto the lash line, eg. Inner corner, middle and outer corner, then go back and connect them.   If you want a thicker line than this initial thin one, build it up gradually. Start at the middle of the lash line and draw towards the outer corner. You can extend the line slightly past the outer corner of your eyelid if you wish.   To make your eyes look even better, start thin and then get thick; this gives the look of bigger eyes. For cats eyes, flick the brush at the end of the stroke. You could use liquid underneath if you're extremely talented!         Alternate Method  Make sure you have everything you need first of all (see Things You'll Need located at the bottom).   Start by applying a base. Some makeup used as base can be foundation, concealer or a light brown eyeshadow or if you are going for the spontaneous look-apply a bright eyeshadow such as green, pink or blue.   Get your chosen liquid eyeliner, a bright color one is blue or pink, whereas a more frequent liner is black.   Dots: On your eyelid with the liquid eyeliner draw three dots close to the lash line and keep your eyes closed for a minute to make sure it drys before you open your eye to avoid smudging.   Starting with the dot closest to the inner corner of the eye and join to the next one, then the next one. For a more "cat eye effect", flick out the liner on the outer corner of your eyes.   Do the same for the other eye, then apply some mascara to your eyelashes and voila! You're done!   Don't put the brush in your eye. This will result in pain and you may have to wash your eye out.   I've found that it's easier to apply liquid eyeline when your eye isn't closed all the way.   If you do make a mistake while applying liner in either pencil or liquid form, then it is easily corrected - use a Q tip & some eye makeup remover to erase your mistake & start over.   If you do something wrong, keep a cotton bud with some make-up remover on the end or a make up corrector pen to clean up and mistakes!   Keep one eye open. Obviously the one that isn't at work. It's easier, and in the end, you'll have a nice straight line.   Practice makes perfect-do this about 10 times and will be able to apply liner like a pro!   Remember kids: liquid eyeliner isn't for everyone. Some people ARE allergic, so be sure you aren't before using it. If you don't, you could end up with a swollen eye!   Stay with a black or dark brown liner first of all and when u gain more confidence go for some brighter colors-e.g: green eyeshadow with neon liner!   Try applying your liquid liner after you have put 1 thin coat of mascara on, it helps give you a straight line, when you are done putting your eyeliner on, then you can finish your mascara.     x0x0_LEi|`|ZhfYEHVKaa	Apply it as close as possible to the upper lash line. You can rest your elbow on the counter or some other stable surface to help keep your arm steady. You can apply liquid liner to your bottom lash line as well, but should not apply it to the waterline/inner lash line; liquid liner rarely stays put here and can be irritating (and possibly dangerous if you get any on your actual eye)!     And practice makes perfect! When I first start wearing liquid liner, it was really hard to get a good line--but I kept at it, and now I can do it in seconds!     Another hint for getting good cat-eyes (that "wing" you are talking about) is to line along the upper lash line stopping before you "wing out". Make a dot where the liner should end on both eyes; this makes it easier to get them symmetrical. Good luck and practice, practice, practice!|`|aU5vUcWLaa	skip to 3 30sec i know her makeup looks silly but this is how you do liner =]  so just ignore the eye shadow lol =]    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV-jC_1GM...|`|lkkUh6eeaa	Practice and start outwards then in. And then go back and wing it out and connect the wing from the top line to the bottom. Hope I Helped! :)
QOLZJyY6aa	not pretty... ew.... ugly.

i38Ev1Zaaa	her look is a tighter version of a beachy wave look.    Your going to need mousse, hairspray, and a high quality 3/4 inch curling iron, i recommend hot tools.    Apply mousse to your hair until its damp, then let it airdry or blowdry.   clip your hair up into layers, and then start curling your hair in a spiral motion in about 1/2 inch sections. Finish yoru whole head, and then let it cool.    Your curls should be tighter than how you really want them at first, then after they cool, spray your head with hairspray and run your fingers through the curls, and they should get pretty loose for you.     A few prodcuts i recommend are:  Garnier Fructis CURL CONSTRUCT mousse (cheap, affordable and it works)  Back to Basics firm hold hairspray (Expensive, but works well)  Suave RAVE hairspray (Replacement for back to basics)  Hot tools Gold Plated 3/4 Spring curling iron- for the best curls.     good luck!|`|lkkUh6eeaa	I would say take a 1/8 of an inch curling iron and make tight curls in the same direction every time.Then wait until all the curls are cool and run your fingers through them to get that wavy look. Or do it the old fashioned way and make sections of braids at night and take them out in the morning. Make sure they're not to tight but loose and spray some mousse or hairspray before bed. Hope I Helped! :)|`|jT8vzaluaa	Go to your nearest best salon with those pics and ask for it!       Its much easier to get to your final product, and a good stylist will show you how to maintain it between visits for fabulous hair.
NiFjl37haa	i might look weird because i've seen people do that.then they have dark eyebrows and dark roots.most of the time when i see people get it done or have gotten done it comes out looking cheesy.but if you think it will look good on you try it.oh here is a convincing argument for you to tell your mom.that if it ends out looking bad your hair will grow and you can cut of the blonde part.and return to your natural hair color.    I hope i helped either to convince you it isn't a good idea or how to convince your mom to let you get it done.|`|H909dAYGaa	i personally don't like when brunettes go blonde cause you can always see their roots and it would just be a pain to keep up with!|`|hj4Hke9eaa	YES! do it! change is good, ESPECIALLY if your hair used to be blond, that means it will def look good!|`|3llK5y7Baa	ehh i depends if your skin color matches it....it looks wierd if i see some dark skinned person with platinum blonde hair=/
zpovg4U7aa	Honestly; it sounds like your dad is homophobic, and more than anything he is not objecting you wearing women's shorts but he somehow believes that you wearing women's clothing is the spark of homosexual behavior.    Which is already wrong to begin with. And you did state that you are not gay, and that you are totally straight. I believe you and we are strangers, your dad should believe that too. He is your father, but people are narrow-minded at times. I don't want to insult your dad but he seems a bit stubborn and ignorant about this topic.    You can wear whatever you want. He can't watch over you at all times; at one point in your life when you're living on your own, if you like women's shorts and want to f-ing buy them for your own liking, he can't stop you. He needs to realize that.    You should talk to him about his homophobic behavior. The reason I say this is because of the part where you said he screamed something about going to the dark side. This makes me mad, because to your dad it wasn't over a pair of shorts but it's hard for you to understand because to you it was about just a pair of shorts that you really liked.    I'm a bit stubborn when it comes to what I want so I fight back with my dad, and trust me my dad becomes completely insane and unreasonable when he gets mad. I would buy them. I really would, because your dad needs to accept it and if that acceptance is gonna grow a little bit from a pair of shorts; be it, you know? If he shreds them, you know what - keep doing what you do. Do what you like.    ---    Those shorts do not look that girly. They do look unisex. For heaven's sake, it's not like you're buying shorts that have flowers on them. I actually think if you buy the right size, those type of shorts could look good on a guy. And I study fashion, I think I would at least somewhat be right on a topic like this, don't you think? :)|`|Asm9RdaXaa	sorry,dude those are straight out womens shorts!|`|SaxjkMbSaa	I would suggest that you might try to buy the shorts you like along with an exceptionally masculine looking shirt that would help  to COMPENSATE for the way your father feels about the feminiity of the shorts.  If you father sees you wearing the shorts with a very manly shirt......he may view the shorts in a different fashion.|`|bf3bc2c3811507a54ef69dd9118ca5a3aa	I agree with your dad. Girls know fashion better than guy's and a girl will be able to spot girl shorts in an instant. If you don't want to be called a gay sissy. Stay away from womens clothes.|`|ICTqyQaraa	dude i have dyslexia dont do this to me|`|itmO3yk2aa	i would talk to your mom first, because it sounded like she was more understanding and explain to her that you're not buying girl clothes that look girly, you're buying ones that look unisex and you need them because they're all that fits you. once you've convinced her, talk to your dad together. if you can't convince her, it sucks but it's what it's like being  teenager. at least when you move out you can dress however you want to :]    your point seems totally logical to me though, so good luck    
bjguq3Yuaa	Go to sallys beauty supply and get a red blocker. You mix it in with your color and it keeps the red away.|`|EnBhiRp3aa	my roomie had ths same problem! to be honest,you can't trust store bought products. how can u expect a box of brown to do the same thing for a red head as a blonde? you can't. u need to go to the hair salon and have it done. i know it sucks, but ur hair def won't be ginger after that.  ;) good luck
hj4Hke9eaa	Bed Head 1.5 all the way!|`|5Pf2az2saa	If you want the waves then get the 1.5 inch. The smaller 1 1/4 is for tighter curls. You can also do waves with it, but it takes more practice. the 1.5 usually looks really good:D Have fun curling your hair|`|lkkUh6eeaa	I agree with the answer before me, the 1 and a half inch because the other is to small to get waves.To get waves you can wrap the pice of hair around the barrel and clamp it shut.That's how you get the waves. Hope I Helped! :)
2oN7WrVKaa	Labret hurt a tad bit more.  But its worth it, I enjoy my labret piercing much more then my monroe.  You dont feel it much though, your adrenaline is really pumping.  The only part that I felt was when the needle broke through the other side of the skin; and the pain disappeared in an instant.  Youll be fine.  :)|`|HRvPoQzKaa	It depends on YOU and pain.    I have my monroe AND left side lip pierced. They really didn't hurt.|`|nnf4znP4aa	labret.

kzLJbZMBaa	i think a really small diamon stud monroe would be cute as heck maybe paired with a nose studd... a matching sized diamond though.    good luck       I mean one of the really little ones that lay almost flat.|`|PzCxpY52aa	i think  maybe just a cute nose piercing, you dont want anything too crazy|`|5R6sYwzDaa	If any, I think a simple nose stud would look the best.  You are pretty and do not need any piercings :)    It's up to you though, but I think a nose stud would be cuter and more subtle|`|VNBuwzucaa	I dont think you are ready for any piercings  you look fine without them|`|hV6h60Liaa	You look kind of young to get pierced.|`|FV0BoSkTaa	I don't think u should get any facial piercings.  You look too young, and you just don't have the right look.  You look really preppy/girly.|`|pXTUMTdEaa	if i were you, since you're getting them on your face, you should really think about what you want, if you decide later that you don't want them, they will leave a scar.....|`|kjqGTk2Maa	nooonnnneeeee
RKC36n9Naa	uhh they still call them designers. and it takes a lot of luck and talent. a four year degree is usually the best place to start and then an internship in a high profile company (most likely overseas or NYC). i don't want to shoot down your dream (if it is your dream), but try thinking more reasonably starting out. the fashion industry is large, almost everyone can find a comfortable niche somewhere, and that's not always at the top.|`|oM0mUoW5aa	construction/carpentry|`|0suLGp3Baa	work

9z0dzBjAaa	it happens to me to.  it happens because your not used it!  the pain should be gone in a couple of days.  next time you get them done dont wait to long cause the pain will come!    i used to get my nails done all the time! i went about a year without  getting them done and oh my god it hurt so bad!|`|Ae6bUiRWaa	when you squees the nail does white puss looking stuff come out?? that couldf mean u have an infection. If i am right don't go back to that nail salon for acrylics
lkkUh6eeaa	No it's just temporary.That happens when a strand of hair gets too much color and it starts to loose its texture.Just make sure not to add any more chemicals to it from now on. Hope I Helped! :)|`|YjkXyHBuaa	i think so.  my hair used to be curly  but ever since i bleached & dyed it  it's pretty straight. :]|`|bjguq3Yuaa	It means that your hair is so stressed out and damaged that it cannot take shape. All will go back to normal just dont color your hair or use any heat on it for a while.|`|hj4Hke9eaa	No, thats just what happens when the structure of your hair has been chemically altered, and then the water causes a chemical reaction to it.
qQqC2cHIaa	I made this a while ago: http://www.polyvore.com/feeling_funky_fu...|`|Dj9rKYukaa	Try pink-faded strait legged jeans with a white tee and maybe some punk drawings on it. Then, a bow in your hair, maybe some Keds or some sort of sneakers(cute ones of course!) and wear a whole bunch of neon necklaces.    Hope that helps!!|`|13mp3Z8Laa	Hi, I have an amazing one that you might be looking for. I hope so. My username on Polyvore is Hey_Girl_Heyy!.

AA11812946	It worked for me!  I stopped slouching, started talking more, dressed better, and I was always really in shape I just gained confidence in myself, and immediately I went from loner to woohoo own circle of friends.    I still have braces, but I don't have a problem with my ego or self confidence anymore. I dress how I want, don't know what people say and don't care.     And guess what? People love it. Sooo...yeah. If I did it, you sure as hell can.    Oh and I wear Old Spice, which makes me smell oh so manly.    P.S. Don't text too much it pisses people off.|`|gVRma7Mxaa	you should be popular thenn :)|`|EKlBQub6aa	I think I'd want to be your friend.    You know those poeple who you see and you're all like "wow, i wanna be their friend"    aghaha  that's happens to me.|`|ctE1mihuaa	Its your choice if you want to change or not.  If you want to then change!  it all depends. & im fixing up my question now..  so come back and reply when im done fixing it. kthnks.  ps, if you feel comfurtable with becoming a new girl..  then DO IT.  nobodys stopping you accept yourself.|`|r3Ckx5smaa	heck i'm just like that, except i still have braces and can't breathe out of my nose only because of allergies. i would totally be your friend regardless if whether you changed or not. ps i'm also in high school.
3TIBDgypaa	I think either the third or fourth one. They're really cute! If I had to choose between the two of them, I would pick the white one, I think it would look good on your skin, since your tan. The last one is cute too, but the cut of the dress may make you look pregnant, and I don't think you want that!     Good luck!|`|9YlzqDSjaa	I like the first one - simple and cute! :-D|`|6UkIKPfSaa	definetely 3 =)|`|th4eHIrTaa	I really like the Strapless Metallic Lace Dress. It would really bring out your tan and look good with layered hair. :) If only you could find a red one, that would look even better. But the third is the best choice for you.|`|ADWIWx5Baa	The 3rd one looks best.|`|0iuvUhMpaa	http://store.delias.com/item.do?category...    http://www.kaboodle.com/reviews/oc-by-ol...    those are my personally favs, depends wat you like though =]|`|B4CAamCLaa	either 3rd or 4th
1QU88lbHaa	No i dont think it's to harsh, liquid liner is the strongest of all liners, because of the colour payoff, so i guess it might change from different skin types, my friend who is sort of palish doesn't use it as it looks like permanent marker on her, but on me it's fine.  I apply liner to the corners only when i'm doing a nightime look not everyday as it makes my eyes look smaller and closer together.   Umm another thing you can do, is set the liner with a black eyeshadow, that helps to make it last longer.  Oh and i have sensitive eyes too, so eye drops helps your eyes to stop watering. Couldn't live without it. =)|`|QovnMnbNaa	What are you asking me? You are talking about like 5 different things. I wear liquid all around my eye, not too thick; I like it, and I don't care if I look trashy. If waterproof eyeliner doesn't work for you, I guess you're **** outta luck, and you don't have to put it in the corners anyways, most people don't. If brown eyeliner looks bad then use black?      --  okay by jesus dont cry now|`|99Ejw6Pvaa	Hmm i have the same issues. Putting liner on the rim does look very trashy and comes off quickly. Also when my eyes get teary it washes the corners. So this is me and how i do my makeup:    http://i305.photobucket.com/albums/nn231...    ( i didnt have any mascara on so my eyelashes look ugly but you can clearly see my eyeliner )    So yea maybe try something like that if you like it!|`|YjkXyHBuaa	liquid eyeliner always looks too harsh :[  honestly there are VERY few people i have seen where it looks good.    eyeliner in general just makes eyes smaller and unappealing.  stick with just tons of mascara instead :]|`|n2hgJlPtaa	i love liquid eyeliner i put it right under my eyelashes not on the rim of my eye , i cant stand any other eyeliner liquid looks better to my and my husband evan agrees.
eJsR7BZvaa	Put baking soda and water on your hair and leave it there for five minutes, then rinse. You can also use an apple cider vinegar rinse.  Hope this helps!
55oy2i5caa	When my red comes out too bright I just wash it like crazy, even though you're supposed to wait. It'll be fine in a couple of days.|`|92fbce946753f473dafcf78d171f5a2baa	omggg that happened to me when i got  highlights, oyu know when the hairdresser says not to wash your hair with shampoo for a day or two? well yeah wash it with shampoo alotttttt! itll fade.|`|taNILMmsaa	dye it again|`|RVfvwnCAaa	make another 1 or add yellow to it|`|dM5a6Pm7aa	you can buy special 'toner' from hairdressers which you can put through your hair to ease up the colour a bit and make it less intense.
zpovg4U7aa	a lot of people like the glamour of a fashion industry so they fall into fashion design, but i think a lot of  people, depending on how old they are, decide that maybe fashion merchandising is a better major for them.    i'm an aspiring fashion designer as well, but more than anything i love to sketch my creative designs and sew. i think it's a less serious of an art piece but takes as much or maybe even more work than painting, drawing, etc.    i've taken a few classes and now i've applied to a few colleges (i'm currently in college but i'm transferring to a bigger city like LA or NYC) to further my fashion studies. my parents are very supportive; it's important to have supportive parents in my opinion because it's such a harsh industry. they are willing to send me off to florence or paris so that i can study more fashion and broaden the level of creativity.    fashion design is not a glamorous job from the beginning; you sleep less than basically any other major. it's actual physical work because you have to sit there and sketch, cut, measure, sew. if all these people who wanted to be fashion designers became famous the whole world would be full of fashion designers but because it is such a cut-throat industry those aspiring to be one have to be extra determined.    as long as you have the passion i'm sure you'll do great. good luck!|`|3e7KFOXmaa	It makes me want to run from the industry but hey thats just me.  good luck with everything. =)|`|9Xn5Xda0aa	true jackson VP just looks stupid to me and im a young person|`|CUpOJaTOaa	just make your's stand out. make it awsome

YTQph9lSaa	I love LA Minerals. The bismuth oxychloride in bare minerals and others is what's probably breaking you out. I've heard about this problem on makeup forums and specifically mineral makeup forums too.  They don't use that in LA Minerals. You should get some samples and try it out. I think you will LOVE IT! If you like the glowy look like BE, then you'd probably like their NoHoGlo. But if you like a more natural look (i do) then try the hollywood formula and use veil over it.
qQqC2cHIaa	Bunions, hammer toes, pinched nerves, broken bones, bone spurs calluses, blisters, need more? Your feet never "get used to it"  they are just tennis shoes and not worth the pain.    buy shoes in your correct size, never wear shoes that are a bit too small, it's not worth it.  Like the other guy said, look at old people feet, some women squished their feet into too small sized shoes for many years. The way we think skinny bodies are better these women thought small feel looked better and would jam themselves into size sixes when they should have been size eights.|`|bdc0c1d1aead267282553512169a9932aa	no..they will injure your feet.|`|ib00OjJXaa	probably not but you should get a size your comfy in.  do you really want your feet to ache?|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	look at old peoples feet|`|jYBgBcZGaa	That is bad for your feet, you could seriously mess up your feet like that especially if you wear them to work out or frequently.|`|TDGhHIvNaa	I would imagine your feet would hurt after awhile.

Go for a walk and get some exercise. Your thighs are pretty big.  Don't get anymore tattoos.  Don't wear that jewelry.   Get a tan.    Photo number two is the best of the worst.

YjkXyHBuaa	powder gets SOOO cakey looking! :[  & with acne, just use concealer.  it's thicker enough to actually cover them.|`|2bZMxMitaa	It depends. When you apply makeup, apply wet/liquid with wet/liquid and powder with powder. Like..If you have a cream foundation and a cream blush, don't put on the foundation, a setting powder, THEN your cream blush. Then it looks super cakey and nasty. Hope all that made sense.|`|VN2wyTnFaa	Powder gets really cakey looking, but so does full coverage foundation (you can thin that out with a bit of moisturizer though). To cover up red spots I would just use concealer so you don't have a super heavy foundation all over (that goes back to the cakey thing). If you're trying to cover pimples, just dot on some concealer with a little brush so you can blend it out and it won't look too heavy. And a good foundation that will look natural is probably one with not a ton of coverage. I like Makeup Forever and Smashbox HD foundations. Good luck!|`|FOAJht6yaa	Excessive application of either will look cakey..|`|FV0BoSkTaa	Applying liquid foundation with a brush looks amazing.|`|hV6h60Liaa	Powder. To cover up pimples, use concealer first on the red spots, and then use foundation on top. I recommend Neutrogena skin clearing oil free foundation. When applying it, wet a foundation brush or sponge as it will make it easier to blend in.    Hope I helped!|`|Fb0Ch8Kxaa	for the red spots i'd say use a green concealer. green concealer is really good at hiding red spots.    try applying your foundation with a foundation brush.    and if you don't want people to notice that you're wearing foundation then you should try a tinted moisturizer.

It can make your hair frizzy though, so get some frizz-ease too.     Seriously, works like a charrrrrm.|`|zzPOffFtaa	Fix it the way you want.  Spray your hair a LOT with a natural hair spray. It has to be natural or else if you spray a lot it will be really really crunchy and sticky.|`|K5RpDsICaa	You could leave your hair in tight pigtails over night to keep them used to the curl and natural curl. If your in a rush, use hairspray to hold it down and put some finisher (that cream that you put through your hair) to hold down the frizz and to keep your hair in its natural curl. Also, i would try using shampoo and conditioner made for curly/wavy hair. its also great to get layers if your hair is really thick so it wont be all one length and really bulky in the middle and bottom. hope this helps! :D|`|TuDzAUAIaa	wet it put mousse in it hair spray or gel thats what i would do|`|WgzPhQeTaa	curl defining product that holds the curls together  i have curly hair and i blow dry with a big round brush then put some product in it and the curls come back but not as poofy. Put treatments in your hair so its not dry and doesnt frizz|`|WhObcItjaa	I have the same problem! Do this:  1. Spray your hair lightly with water.  2. Use, Sharpers- smoothing groomer (it smoothes the frizz)  3. scrunch your hair with, catwalk- Curls rock (It is the most amazing thing, and it holds the curls in!)  4. Hair spray (just in case)    Don't blow dry. Just dry naturally, and it will look amazing!  If you want more beachy waves you can use a de-frizzing serum and spray salt water in your hair.  !!!Or you can always use velcro rollers!!!|`|Pbsayz4Aaa	apply some good hair spray.it will help to retain its shape for long  hope it helped|`|7isjo3DAaa	yea i know how... i want my hair like that too so this is what i do at home, i braid my hair and it doesnt have to be in one ponytail. just braid the part you want. then tie it and leave it on at night so u wear it to sleep. in the morning it will be curled when u take it off but it only lasts like a day or less... i dun do it that much unles i have time but tis worth it!!!|`|5qqa2s8oaa	Well frist off...    Use shampoo only on your crown(rise)  Use conditioner on the whole of your head.(rise)    Use a wide tooth comb to comb out your hair, and put leave-in conditioner in your hair and come through.    (Tresemme is what I use!)Take some volumizing mousse ,use on your crown, lift !  Use some other kind of mousse, scrunch a lot  Use hairspray( Aussie scrunch spray is really awesome!)

U1xvObr4aa	I had a cartilage piercing and I have multiple tattoos and I say the cartilage and regular ear piercings hurt more then a tattoo.    A friend of mine who has an industrial, nose and many tattoos, said the industrial is the most painful of them all.|`|YCVCZE0Iaa	Well, I have an industrial, belly button, and nose piercing, plus tattoos.     Out of those, I think I'd have to say that the nose or industrial hurt the most. But the pain lasted no longer than an hour. and it's like a pressure pain.   Any of them are worth it though. I absolutely love all of my piercings/tattoos. THe pain only lasts a little while.|`|0hJacvb9aa	well im 13 and have 15 piercings.  industrial piercings aren't that bad, just a bit more pinch-y then a normal cartilage piercings. (ALWAYS go to a piercer, not guns, they re bad for piercings, considering they just push the skin out of the way, where needles safely take a little piece of skin out of your body.)  bellybutton piercings are a breeze, the clamps are the worst part.  septums hurt like a *****  nose isint that bad  and i have 3 tattoos, theyre addicting. but id have to say the industrial was worse then my 3 tattoos.

It's certainly not something you want to try to fix... it's all high voltage stuff inside, and if done wrong it can throw sparks and literally set your hair on fire.

d5065693519b5b048f87de49a76bf961aa	**Self massage with essential oils like coconut, almond, olive, & jojoba works wonders. Thicker oils have been diluted 50/50 successfully with thinner essental oils like grape seed.  They have been used by skin specialists to treat acne prone skins as they do not clog, cause breakouts, and they lessen skin's production of oil. They are great for anti aging as they nourish and feed skin many beneficial and health promoting nutrients.  I found a forward and back motion using finger tips and front and sides of fingers, depending where on face you massage, is best (a circular one will be less effective).   Quickly gets rid of all blemishes in a matter of days. If do  quite vigorously it exercises and tones face muscles and thus counteracts their weakening which leads to sagging and in turn results in many of our wrinkles and lines and face aging. Best to tighten facial skin first by opening mouth about 1", pulling lips firmly back against teeth, and protruding chin.  Vigorous massage is best for quickly smoothing, firming and tightening and can quickly give you a healthy, flawless, glowing skin. You will be amazed at its effectiveness. Oils are perfect, natural and safe moisturizers. Many moisturizing and other products are seriously skin harming, skin aging and do cause acne and have been pulled from some markets because of that and cancer concerns.(confirm with a Google). Oils quickly absorb into skin with vigorous massage so you do not remove. Simply splash face with water and tissue dry.  Many have benefited from treatment - see my many other answers. I have testimonials from happy users     SOURCE(S): 20+ years research into safe, natural treatments and cures of skin conditions, skin enhancement and anti aging, rejuvenation treatments.|`|Cu0fPcdnaa	yes is good for your face mix it with virgin olive oil and makes your skin so dewy and you will look young I use it like a night moisturizers  and people think I am so much younger.
