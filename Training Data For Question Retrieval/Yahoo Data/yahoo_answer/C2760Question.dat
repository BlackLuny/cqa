20090203165726AA3hg4K	Dining Out;United States;Other - US Dining Out	Denny's Grand Slam Breakfast... Is it unfair? Is it a marketing stunt rather than kindness?	I'm a junior in high school, but don't let that alter your opinion. This brings up the first question, is it unfair for Denny's to offer a free breakfast that are exactly during school hours? Did they do this to keep teenagers out? Sure, teenagers have that reputation of being rowdy, but that doesn't mean we have stomachs too? As more and more high schools become closed campuses, was this stunt projected directly to adults with lunch breaks rather than "America" in general?      My second question is whether or not this is just a marketing stunt. Sure it seems the company is just doing a good deed, but why now? Denny's has lost business over the years, that's obvious enough, but why after losing business would they sacrifice an upwards of $100,000 to do something nice?      Marketing is a dirty game full of lies and deceiving, as any marketing student would realize, but assuming the amount of costumers and the losses, this can barely benefit the company if it does at all. (Based on current stock market statistics and company history)
