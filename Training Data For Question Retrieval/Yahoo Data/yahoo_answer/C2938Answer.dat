When a company chooses a variety and alters it they are looking at the ability to be shipped great distances and stored for long periods of time. They have bred out flavor and nutrition to ensure it looks good when it gets to the market. This is one of the main reasons heirlooms are seeing a huge comeback.

India is a rare country that can say we've developed our nuclear program enitrely on our own, and it's been a massive boost to our scientific community and the development of an indigenous high-tech sector.  Provided that we avoid the siren call of further nuke development and focus on nuclear energy, we'll continue to thrive.<br>  <br>  Also, I'll say it straight out-- I'm very, very suspicious about the US and sternly recommend that we not hitch ourselves to yet another superpower with its own interests, just as we foolishly once did with the USSR.<br>  <br>  Is the US really our friend?  They claim they are, but their actions belie them.  We could see this most clearly in the United States' bitter opposition to India getting a seat on the UN Security Council.  We should have had a seat back in 1945, but we failed because Britain was still brutally colonizing us, and Britain continues to oppose us because they hate the idea of their former brown colony being equal or superior to their sorry ex-imperial selves in national diplomacy.<br>  <br>  The US could have taken India's side and helped to modestly right this historical wrong, but instead, the US meekly kowtowed to Britain's wishes and blocked us from having a seat at the table. The US has also been thwarting our efforts to win a natural gas pipeline from Iran, which we absolutely need for our national survival.<br>  <br>  IOW the USA is a fair-weather friend at best, and their opposition to India on the UNSC in particular was asinine.

The reason for going in for the "deal" and agreeing to subject India-built PHWRs to intrusive "inspections" by the U.S (and its proxy IAEA) is said to be lack of Nat. U fuel for our PHWRs within the country. This touted reason is not correct. Actual fact is that uranium mining is not being "allowed" by opportunistic local politicians and foreign funded NGOs who have, due to lack of political will and sagacity of our politicians, throttled the very "food supply" for the reactors. There is enough U ore in the country to support 10,000 MW electricity generation for 30 years. We have not yet reached even 3000 MWe installed capacity (of PHWRs) and they have been operating only over the last 10 or so years!! For the Govt. to seek a solution by importing Nat U rather than solving a local political problem is extremely wrong and will prove to very bad for our long-term technology independence.|`|bd3880c165e632c95189f4e85b55715aaa	s|`|e06b4133981e49f9102a5528cf8f88a2aa	Yes they do, their in fear of America.

t9dKfAYEaa	I am a little busy now but will give a longer answer later. The 2minutes or so that I have watched seemed very good.  Thanks for sharing, I've starred the question.|`|AA10755943	The video you linked was a bit of propaganda that disregarded some important facts.  <br>  <br>  Global Warming is not from "greenhouse gases" - it is from solar and volcanic energy.  Yes, water vapor is the primary greenhouse gas but there is a limit to vapor pressure in the atmosphere.<br>  <br>  Increasing acidity in the oceans has been largely a result of increased volcanic activity underwater, such as a massive volcanic explosion under the Arctic ice cap in 1999.<br>  <br>  As CO2 increases, plant growth rates increase and plants become more water-efficient.  If humans were not so eager to wipe out vegetation, this planet would increasingly become jungle.<br>  <br>  I did not find that video convincing - it neglected important causative factors.<br>  <br>  As the video says - this sort of thing HAS HAPPENED BEFORE - we are not causing it this time either.<br>  <br>  His key phrase was - Britain would be fighting to keep out the starving hordes resulting from WHAT WE ARE DOING.  That is the LIE in the whole thing.<br>  <br>  Bear in mind that this world has warmed drastically over the past 18,000 years, with oceans rising over 400 feet and the ice caps receding by over 2,000 miles.  Most of the warming occurred before 6,000 years ago, as you can see by this Sea Level Rise chart.  Humans did not cause it. <br>  <br>  Letting the "Green" movement seize your money and throttle your productivity will do nothing to slow this process that has been naturally occurring all along.  If humans completely vanish from this planet it will continue warming - or will go into the next ice age right on schedule.

The only way to fix it is to expect more from others in society and allow people to suffer the consequences of their own actions. <br>  <br>  It is a moral or ethical as well as a practical decision. We should quit waiting for the government to regulate things like pesticides in food and be willing to find out what is in or on our food and if it is safe, not FDA approved.

Once built, the wind farms are easily maintained and are the cheapest supply of electricity.   They are built based on long term wind studies, thus over the long run you know there will be a given amount of wind.   You don't know when it will come but it's not the only generating souce - the grids are already set up to rely on many generating sources and to automatically switch to the cheapest source available, so you just hook wind up to the grid and it can provide up to 20% of a grid's baseload capacity.   <br>  <br>  Note - I am a skeptic of man-made warming (and at this point, of warming as a long-term trend).    But wind power conserves coal, natural gas and nuclear, which produce other pollutants and which are in finite, even if substantial, domestic supply.   Just because James Hansen and Al Gore are frauds doesn't mean wind power is a bad idea.<br>  <br>  And as for oil companies thinking they're a bad idea - we in the US do not generate a significant amount of electricity using oil.   We generate only about 2% of our electricity using oil.    It's a backup fuel, primarily used when gas prices spike.|`|9RC2EPANaa	i'm an electrician and i can tell you with confidence that they are not very good . they are on average 5% efficient.<br>  <br>  if you do some research you will find that many people have invented ways to make energy for free, but they are either denyed patents or they are murdered and their research is confiscated.<br>  <br>  if you control the energy, you control the world.<br>  <br>  in the 70's a man called Bruce De-palma from my country (New Zealand) developed what he called the N-machine. <br>  When the N-machine was originally disclosed to the public, careful testing revealed output electrical power exceeding equivalent input mechanical power by 5 - 7.7:1<br>  He applied for a patent, but was denied because the machine didn't obey the laws of physics as todays western scientists understand it.<br>  <br>  Nikola Tesla, the man who developed the A.C power system we use today, developed his system to supply all electricity to everyone for free without using any wires, but he was ripped off by Thomas Edison who was funding his research.

uFQFRdczaa	Theories are not proved.  A theory is not the same thing as a statement of fact, it is a means for organizing and explaining facts.  A theory can, however, be falsified.  <br>  <br>  When the existing commonly accepted theory is falsified, that leaves people flailing for a way to organize their understanding of the universe.  When this happens, any other theory that has not yet been falsified could become accepted, without further "proof."  For an example, geocentrism was falsified, and people quickly accepted the sun as the center of the universe--until we figured out what the Milky Way is shaped like.  Then we accepted the center of the Milky Way, until we discovered that all the galaxies are moving away from a single point in space...<br>  <br>  AGW is a refinement of global warming theory, which replaced the prior theory: that the Earth goes through natural cycles of ice ages on about a 10,000 year timescale. Ice age theory replaced the theory that God created the heavens and the earth, and things are the same now as they have always been--and that fish bones in mountainsides, dinosaur fossils and the like--were either put there by Satan, or were put there by God to test the faithful<br>  <br>  In almost every case, the burden is on the skeptic (or the person proposing a new theory) to falsify the existing paradigm.|`|1oxBCtmZaa	Burden of proof in a free society has to be on those seeking to curtail otherwise free activity to prove the veracity of their pretext for curtailing it.<br>  <br>  In this case that means the burden is to prove global warming.<br>  <br>  That clearly hasn't been done.<br>  <br>  If the burden of proof were on the individual to show that the activity he wished to engage in didn't cause some alleged harm, then anyone could just shut down any activity they didn't like by inventing and disseminating allegations that the activity caused some harm.    Imagine gay people having to prove that homosexuality didn't cause this or that harm alleged by the religious right - the time and money spent to disprove what would surely be an endless list of alleged harms would in effect curtail the conduct that the religious right sought to curtail, even if none of the allegations proved true.

Tuttavia nel nostro paese questa cultura non è ancora molto diffusa, come del resto neanche quella, in generale, del rispetto della natura. Probabilmente, però, ci sono anche molti interessi loschi rivolti verso questo settore (la camorra in Campania fa affari lucrosi con la "spazzatura"). Se fossi il sindaco della mia città proporrei cmq delle multe per i trasgressori (anche se sono dell'idea che bisognerebbe sensibilizzare maggiormente la gente con spiegazioni dettagliate riguardo ai vantaggi della pratica della spazzatura differenziata).|`|UcT0NSzuaa	sai il perke?perke il mondo sta morendo distrutto dal modo di pensare degli uomini...almeno la maggior perte|`|43c74cf27f89a4cc03b7cf5cde313349aa	Dovrebbero incominciare a piovere le multe...cosi' anche chi fa' il furbo capira'....|`|H8b4PH8Kaa	Manca la cultura del Riciclo,ma lentamente arriverà,pazienta ancora un po' prima di urlare!!!Ma sappi che ti capisco,costa così poco fare attenzione!!!
