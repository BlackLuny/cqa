PLS1CAEHaa	Its better choice if you kill Playboy X. because you get his apartment, which is in my opinion the nicest building property in the game. plus you get Dwayne as a friend. you also get delivered to wardrobe the clothes that the character wore in Grand Theft Auto III. (The Black Jacket, green Trousers and white shoes with blue rim) since you have to storm playboy X’s Apartments and kill all his Bros in a full on gun battle makes   Playboy X a more difficult challenge   to kill then Dwayne. Dwayne just really stands there to be killed in his kitchen.

7DccnBrxaa	Halo: Combat Evolved (that's number one to all you Halo know-it-alls!) is the ultimate game. Although the graphics aren't what they used to be back in 2001 for the Xbox and 2003 for the PC (and a year later for the Mac), the game still owns. I understand that the multiplayer isn't all as action packed as in Halo 3, but the single player mode is mainly what I'm talking about here. Halo: Combat Evolved has one of the best plot in a video game until now, it has great, crisp graphics even though it's eight years old, and the multiplayer pwns. What else? It was one of the first games with vehicles to be as fun as this, Master Chief's shield was a passionate addition to the "use health pack to restore 20 health" life point system of that age, and generally, it was such a revolution, I can still call it an awesome game, played in between games like GTA IV, Crysis or Metal Gear Solid 4. HALO. COMBAT. EVOLVED. Remember that name.|`|VdBZjRo5aa	my husband got me the 360 for xmas so i went out and bought halo 3. i loved it so much that i decided to buy the original xbox so i could play halo 1 and 2. after playing all 3, i would have to say halo 3 is the best. i love the fact that you can take the turret with you instead of just shooting from where its at. 3 was also more challenging which i was happy with. they are all good games. i love the fact that they didnt change anything about them. same guns, vehicles, etc. halo rocks!!! too bad i cant get into halo wars. i dont like real-time strategy games. just not for me.|`|QHPoAvlvaa	Halo 2 thats what made XBL stand out and change online and pro gaming for ever|`|Pi4R6tINaa	halo 3 is best<br>  u can rip turrets of there stands (cant in 1 or 2)<br>  the live play is better (more people, more game modes)<br>  there are 4 types of grenades (1 and 2 had only 2)<br>  more weapons (grav hammer, mauler, spiker, spartan laser)<br>  forge (you can design your own levels)<br>  equipment (press x to throw things like deployable cover and bubble shields)<br>  more vehicles (chopper)|`|Um9Oth8Oaa	Halo 3

K9zNcxcyaa	It is pretty confusing, i say its like tomagothchi, except vulgar. you give him stuff by picking it up and dropping it to him. in the first part you have to keep feeding it, youll have to keep going back and forth from the shop to buy more bones, feed it till it says youve completed the stage<br>  <br>  the next stage is uh...pretty gross, every time it goes >_> you have to throw it away and use toilet paper to clean it, sometimes itll crap coins. pick them up an its added to your money<br>  <br>  next stage, just throw the frisbee around<br>  <br>  after youve made it to the next stage you have to potty train it, every time it doesnt go on the toilet spray it with the water bottle, try and keep the water bottle away from him because he sometimes breaks it, then you have to buy another, you can buy a leash and take him on walks, at the end of the walk are 3 presents, choose one to get a prize...or something gross<br>  <br>  in the next stage just chat with it using the computer<br>  <br>  in the next stage itll throw molotovs around, i try to keep everything in the lower left corner, so he wouldnt burn it and i wouldnt have to rebuy it, the stage will end after a while<br>  <br>  in the next stage, spray him everytime he smokes, itll end eventually<br>  <br>  in the next stage...i guess you keep him from.....violating the stuffed animals <_< the stage will end eventually<br>  <br>  in the next stage throw away the alcohol (thats what i did) and keep feeding him and walking him till the stage ends<br>  <br>  then you can just keep playing it continously, you can get awards for doing certain things too, all the awards are:<br>  <br>  These are all of the goals: <br>  <br>  <br>  1.

ZMcPHP7Yaa	Most poker sets are alright, but most are really meant for the average player.<br>  <br>  If you want to get him a poker set that's really nice, make sure that the chips are NOT, and I repeat NOT, plastic. Those Bicycle plastic, thin chips are great for poker... if you 6 years old. Avoid those like they have anthrax on em.<br>  <br>  When you're looking for the right kinda chip, you're gonna want to find at least 11.5g chips. These are the clay or better kind of chip, and they're slightly heavier to the touch, and those are the kind of chips players like to play with. They're heavier then normal, stack better and neater, and will be a better card cap.<br>  <br>  Don't be afraid to spend a little extra to get the right kind of poker chips. They'll last longer, and be much more worth it in the end.|`|fe05GwXAaa	Try this it is from the World Series Of Poker official site.<br>  <a href="http://stores.xpapparel.com/wsop/product_info.php?cPath=417_450&products_id=2878&osCsid=e56ee98790ba8601c786f358b9fb240b" rel="nofollow">http://stores.xpapparel.com/wsop/product...</a>

AA10015577	Depending on the way you are playing, you really don't want to overbid.  If you overbid it is minus the amount that you overbid, say you bid seven and you get nine, it would be seven minus two making it five.  The first hand always bids itself meaning you can take as many tricks as you can get.  For the rest of the game, you and your partner have to bid how many tricks you think you can take.  For example you always want to count aces and kings, especially of the same suit, and if you have one card of one suit you would count that because you can trump that suit after you use that one card.  You have to play it right though.  If you have a king, it's always best to wait until the ace of that suit is played to make sure you can play your king.   Say you have quite a few spades, you will want to count at least an extra book because you will have less of the other suits.  If you and your partner think that you can get 10 books (or more) you can call to go flight, but if you don't get them, you automatically lose the game.  It's quite a fun game but you need to know how to play pretty well and in sync with your partner if you are playing for money.  I might have left out a couple details but I hope this at least helps.  I love playing spades.

QJwaagGWaa	Well I am taking at shot that the game is for kids, I remember a good game our gym teacher taught us how to play, it goes like this:<br>  It is sort of a "Tag" game, but instead of being "it", you were eliminated once you were tagged by the other person. And you could only run On the lines, you know, the lines on the gym floor.<br>  Ex: Say there are twenty students at gym class, YOU select at least three students to be the..... eliminators(they have to tag other kids in order to eliminate them). Make sure the Eliminators are wearing some type of clothing so that other kids can watch out for them. Now the rules are simple, the kids can only run On the lines, not outside them, so they might as well get stuck at some point and get eliminated. Here is the catch, a lot of students may get eliminated at the begining of the game, but as less student are available, it gets a bit harder to get caught, since you can only walk(run) on the lines. After lets say five or ten minutes, the last remaining students are your survivors (Winners)<br>  <br>  I know another one, sort of similiar, its again another 'eliminator' game, you choose the "sharks" like four of them, place them on the center of the gym. The point of this game is for the kids to run to the other side of the gym, without getting eaten(tagged) once a kid is tagged, they are out, and should be placed somewhere where you can distinguish them. After Five rounds, the last remainig students are your winners.|`|GyDU6g5Kaa	Ya know those tumble mats?

We didn't even stay in a Disney Hotel.  We stayed in a Comfort Inn.|`|2n6HSiF0aa	You just might have to increase your budget by a few hundred more dollars. Disney World is really expansive, and they are probably the only company that is benefiting from this recession.|`|QWHpXlNCaa	hey!

Food can run about $50 for a counter service meal for four. You can cut that by buying 3 meals,still enough food, and having water-pop can really run up the price.|`|AA12137001	Any coupons available?<br>  <br>  Are you going to FL or CA?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/wdwi/en_GB/?bhcp=1" rel="nofollow">http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/wdwi/en...</a><br>  <br>  Some weird offer - 4 Orlando Hotel nights and 7 days Disney FREE!<br>  <br>  It's on their website.<br>  <br>  This is not spam.

I looked into something like that for my oun vacation that is how I know. Just for my boyfriend and I it was $800. Try a good neighbor hotel I just stayed at the tropicana inn and suites, it is right across the street and it has a pool and a hot tub.|`|GDZZYgWUaa	To tell the truth you can't :(<br>  <br>  You can stay at a hotel outside of Disney but then the tickets will be really expensive. It might be helpful for you to go to an amusment park by your house like Paramount Parks or Six Flags.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and have fun =)

Also, Exile of the Wicked will destroy all fiend monsters, and Royal Oppression is a card to block special summons, but your opponent can use this too, so watch out.

gfmTgLDKaa	No, please read the ratings on these games, they are not there just for show. I have played Fallout 3 and it's an amazing game. But a 7.5 year old boy can not handle such violence, and devastation.<br>  <br>  I don't see why parents choose to ignore such labels, I'm not indicating about you, but personally when I lounge around Game Stop I often see little kids buying such games with their parents.<br>  <br>  For example I saw this 7-9ish boy with his dad and he asked his dad if he can have GTA3 and the dad said off course.<br>  <br>  Please, don't fall in to your sons pressure, don't let him have something he can't have. These ratings are important, rated M means 17+ and that's how it should stay.

8YfnjvExaa	Hi,<br>  In 1953 it was probably 1/2d or 2 1/2d (see <a href="http://www.gbstamps.co.uk/queen_elizabeth_ii_sg515_sg840_simplified.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.gbstamps.co.uk/queen_elizabet...</a> ) which since there were 240 d (old pence) to a pound would be less than 0.5 p & just over 1 p.<br>  <br>  For question 2, they are sold singly or in 'books' (small folded paper) of 4 or 12 and available from Post Offices. Newsagent and supermarkets usually sell the 'books'. At present there are 2nd class and 1st class plus 2nd large and 1st large denominations for letters.

43zXRpLYaa	Interesting. I get four complementary tikets every year and there's no name printed on there. The aren't going to ask at the turnstyle when they scan your ticket. Most people aren't taking an ID with them anyway especially kids who just about never have any ID.<br>  <br>  There shouldn't be a problem.<br>  <br>  The issue is there is no way to tell if the tickets are good or not just by looking at them. So the person you give the ticket to would have to trust you that they are still good.|`|f80e40c6be11ef18f0153889d9336d4daa	Disney tickets are NON-Transferable.  So if they have your last name on them there is a chance that you could be asked for ID.  How much of a chance is hard to say and unfortunately it may be a case of having them show up and trying to use them before they find out.<br>  <br>  Perhaps you can say how you got the Complimentary tickets, as there might be something in how you got them that would provide a better answer.

ZMcPHP7Yaa	(This answer will cover any kind of No-Limit Poker. Limit, Pot Limit and Cap games will have different betting rules.)<br>  <br>  You can't do it in Tournament OR Cash games. <br>  <br>  The blinds ARE bets, by the way, they're -forced- bets. They're forced bets to ensure that there will be some sort of action every hand, unlike in stud or draw games, where sometimes, action can go all the way to showdown with almost no action at all. So if you know Player C, let him know that he's way wrong.<br>  <br>  To answer your question though, there's a rule in ANY kind of poker, no matter what the game, that when someone makes a raise, it has to be equal to, or more, then the value of the Big Blind. So, if the blinds are 50/100, the least amount you can legally raise is 200. 150 is not a legal raise. This makes no different in tournament or in cash, the rules for betting in both remain the same. A legal re-raise is that of equal to the amount of the previous raise. So, if the blinds are 50/100, and someone raises to 300, then the next legal re-raise is 500, since the first player raised 200.<br>  <br>  This will be the same everywhere, the rules are set in stone. Player C really needs to do two things:<br>  <br>  1) Learn the rules of betting.<br>  2) Listen do the dealer.<br>  <br>  The dealer is the man at a poker table, especially in a tournament format. If you refuse to listen to what a dealer has to say, you and he have every right to call a floor manager over to the table and have the discrepancy taken care of.|`|OyW8z4Jxaa	first off, the blinds ARE technically bets, the players must bet that amount before they receive their cards.  also, player C MUST bet at LEAST 2x the big blind if he is going to raise, which a bet to $150 would be.  usually cash games would follow this rule, but it depends on the particular rules for that house.|`|asKSciQCaa	The blinds are forced bets to get money into the pot.<br>  <br>  Minimum raise for player c would be 2x the big blind meaning he would of had to of put in $200.|`|3Iyu7hrcaa	No, player C cannot do this, which is why the dealer said so.
41d4ea7f37805161606a19c751c1961caa	Sorry but what you have is a fantasy piece of some sort and probably not made of silver. The 1851 US silver dollar was 38.1 mm in diameter and weighed 26.73 grams. Liberty is seated facing right but looking over her left shoulder (looking at the coin). On the reverse is a heraldic eagle with three arrows in its right talon and an olive branch in its left (Again looking at the coin). It sounds like they took some elements of a $1 gold piece and tried to apply them to a silver piece. Also most times if there are stars there are at least 13, one for each of the original states.<br>  <br>  Not "real" but interesting.<br>  <br>  In fact if you go to Ebay you can see several listed as replicas.|`|127766aa9c415a074e2f444c6c56e4b4aa	It sounds like a silver round, for no silver dollar is like you describe. See if it says one ounce of .999 silver on it some place. If not, it may just be a fantasy item. Also check to see if it says good for $1 for it could also be a trade token from some state or city to commemorate something from 1851, they usually have 2 dates.

J7iG3mDyaa	sell it on craigslist, buysell, and or kijiji. Sell it around $300, so that people believe that they are getting a good deal.
QJwaagGWaa	well, you could always make it hold an EXP. share, and just train it while your training another pokemon.<br>  You can leave it at the Daycare and come back for it days later, but since you want to do it quickly, you can always use the V.S. seeker, make him hold the Exp Share and watch as he grows fast.<br>  <br>  And if your just a level away, why not sneak in a Rare Candy on it.
Z8qBgv8taa	How about a huge poster board and glue the balloons on and make a sort of mosaic and then frame it? Would look cool all put together. Then you could get a plaque for the bottom of the frame engraved that says "Joe's 10th Birthday" or something. Also would be a fun project to do together.|`|v3GQTYvqaa	actually the pic. frame idea sounds cool,|`|3eg4UoAUaa	you could pin em up around the top border of the room and make a border or take a pic and make a poster or photoshop it  or something.

But there's this other babysitting game where you babysit all sorts of monsters.

But by looking at your monster line up it looks weak. It might be an illusion but there seems to be as many tributes as nontributes which means you dont have enough monsters to maintain field presence. So maybe add some alius or gravekeepers guard.
3jJp6yeMaa	march 10th or 31st|`|E9Vr6ze2aa	There already out they have been since march 3rd you can get them only through halo wars if you buy the game for $60|`|dbgf2Vuhaa	March 10th on the XBOX 360 Market Place|`|6GIrW5eWaa	4/7/2009 is my hunch. Although they are out for those of you who purchased the LCE of Halo Wars they will eventually also be released to the rest of us on the Market Place. What makes me think 4/7? The number 7 is kind of special to Bungie. It wasn't released on 3/7 and each week on bungie.com for the next 4 weeks (5 including last week) they stated that they will spend the next 5 weeks reviewing the different variants of the maps released. So 5 weeks from last Tuesday's release just happens to be 4/7. Not sure if this is fact but is my theory behind the release date. See you in the new maps whenever they come out. Good Luck|`|hpxc5szsaa	i dunnno doggy dog...
8b7170e38a50a75423054d4df0120b1caa	Yup, People use Skype and others.  You would need a fast internet connection and preferably a mic, I believe.<br>  <br>  Just Google "Dungeon Dragon Skype" and you will find or locate people who wants to play.
kByADYXOaa	Video games can't kill LITERALLY. <br>  <br>  No, it won't. If they could, they would be illegal to make. What they mean is influences like very violent games like GTA and stuff. Nuts like Hillary Clinton believe these games cause things like Virgina Tech and other acts of violence amongst young people. However, they fail to realize movies could be just as bad as an influence. The boy who killed all those innocent people at Virgina Tech was obviously very troubled and he wasn't alright in the head. <br>  <br>  Short Answer: No, they won't if you have a good head on your shoulders and realize the difference between reality and video games.|`|12AYMyseaa	No games dont do anything to you. If they DO then THE GAMER is to blame not the game.|`|X4vSvSqpaa	I've been playing video games since Space Invaders on the Atari 2600.<br>  They only kill time|`|X1JuFzOIaa	only if you have epilepsy...|`|h6GTPkyMaa	Man the people who get these statistics...<br>  <br>  The reason the games kill you is if you play them for a long period of time, you don't do any exercise but you still eat meals and this is why they say it 'kills' you. Basically it's more a long term thing, playing video games mean your less likely too weigh less and you will die from heart disease.<br>  <br>  P.S. Scaring the sh*t out of children isn't going to help anyone Yahoo.|`|jLe2VlqLaa	I'm 13 too. And it's common sense to obviously drink, eat, and sleep enough. Those kids that died played non-stop. They didn't stop at all. So don't be stupid and not do what you need to do. You can still play, it won't kill you. But if stay staring at the screen for like 10 hours straight, you can go blind.|`|E2rX900Oaa	Simple answer, no.<br>  <br>  Longer answer, the only way you'll die playing video games is if you play them for several days straight and die of fatigue, not eating or drinking, and not going to the bathroom.|`|fcSFyQdxaa	Nope The brain is a strong part of your body...It takes a short amount of time for drugs to make you dead,but this is a game you may get dizzy if you Play To Long But You Will Be Fine Just Take A Break For 15min Ever Hour|`|FWOKlNTMaa	nah bro if u play like 24/4 it will it u can react to it like crazy zeusures maybe or if u try to do what's in the game than your parents might|`|djNeNEOuaa	if you hit them hard enough in the right spot.|`|9acbdc61db12cb3cbf26e8c330814491aa	no|`|SBcxooLsaa	o i no qwhat story you read the kid was playing a video game 28 hours straight no food water nothing and he died|`|bArpX5Rxaa	Yes Thats Why I'm Still Here :L

NowpwVooaa	I think you might be releasing the balls too late, this is a very common problem. short term answer is to juggle in front of a wall, so you dont throw them forward, but this doesn't always work. Long term, you could go back to 1 and 2 balls, and emphasise a scooping motion with your hands so that you don't throw the balls in front of the balls you catch, and instead, throwing them around them, on the inside of the pattern.Keep at it!
oQWM90Cwaa	ok basically firstly you download the file yep, save it to your computer then if you have already found your data files which is quite hard actually but it takes some time you go to your docouments and find oblivion and go through all of that folder untill you find it, if its not there go to my computer and search through oblivion there untill you find it, create a data files shortcut onto your desktop and double click it to bring up the folder, then go to documents and find the file that you recently downloaded and cut it to the data files then extract the files liek the meshes from the file into the data files then once you have done that, <br>  click on your oblivion shortcut and below start it says data files <br>  open it up and you willl have oblivion master, thats the file that controls the game and below it you should have the mod that you downloaded if its not there it cant work on your computer or you havnt extracted the right files,<br>  bigger mods tend not to work and are highly complicated to manualy work and the instructions never seem to work either follow this guide and hopefully it wil help you in the future to download mods,<br>  <br>  if you find you cannot download mods or theyre arnt any you like you can always download the construction work set for oblivion for free and create your own mods, they take skill but you can always have a bit of fun messing about with the world and just save it and liek before go to data files and tick it on the box.<br>  <br>  <br>  hoep this helped, im only 12 =) at least i know.|`|sYXczj4vaa	intructions come with the mods generally and if not search on google there r thousands of mods 4 oblivion

9NpXU7D2aa	i find that the cast members and nice and helpful. <br>  the rides are AWESOME!!!<br>  the shows are great. <br>  i like the parades and the fireworks. epcot's fireworks "illuminations relfections of earth" are the best in my opinion.<br>  the food is quite tasty no matter what restaurant you choose. <br>  the lines can get pretty long but it doesn't feel very long cuz the atmosphere in the line is entertaining. plus for the most popular rides you can use fastpass. (its free and cuts down on the wait time A LOT)<br>  disney world is a great place for all ages and has something for everyone.|`|8JGwcs2zaa	I am not quite sure what "staff rides" are, but if you refer to the rides in Disney World overall, there are those well suited for the toddler age group and can range into the teenage-adult age group, depending on which park you visit. Epcot is the most well rounded park for age groups, personally, because Mom can chill with baby in the World Showcase with Grandma and Grandpa while Dad and the Kids can go ride Test Track or Mission: Space as many times as they want until the fireworks show, "Illuminations" starts at 9:00 P.M.<br>  <br>  -Hope this helps!

When the wide lens is given to a pokemon, it boosts the accuracy of all moves that the pokemon holding the wide lens knows. i may of been too informative but i hope i helped! :)|`|cV5CDhXyaa	It would be better if you taught your pidgeot Aerial Ace instead of Mirror Move because It does better damage and the attack speed is really accurate.|`|JSwuJpQWaa	It sounds like a cool team. I think I might teach the inferape something besides fire type moves though.|`|dWRWTQ49aa	I'd give it a 10 out of 10 but yeah you might want to teach Infernape some fighting type attacks or at least 1 .
fznvQptlaa	for christmas i needed an inexpensive but thoughtful gift for my husband. i bought a wooden box, got different shapes and colors of cardstock squares. on each i wrote a reason i love him with a really nice marker/pen. in total i made 60 cards. the final one said "the best is yet to be. grow old with me..." and i included a picture of us getting married. we have been married six years. he loved it. good luck|`|2bc760aca1235845cc56ee2f6d0c17d5aa	Sone ideas<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.craftster.org/forum/index.php?topic=295463.0" rel="nofollow">http://www.craftster.org/forum/index.php...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.craftster.org/forum/index.php?topic=292124.0" rel="nofollow">http://www.craftster.org/forum/index.php...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.craftster.org/forum/index.php?topic=295367.0" rel="nofollow">http://www.craftster.org/forum/index.php...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.craftster.org/forum/index.php?topic=295023.0" rel="nofollow">http://www.craftster.org/forum/index.php...</a>|`|qEDEmgLfaa	How old are you?  Go to a thrif store, get 2 wine glasses. Tie  strips of ribbons on them. Buy also a frame you can decorate with something like magazine clippings ( cut patterned pieces )  Put a photo of you in it  or  buy an alphabet sheet of stickers and use to put both your names and the date you met in frame.  make sure you buy a piece of paper that will look good with your alphabet stickers.  decorate the paper lay the glass from the frame on it mark paper , cut and put the paper back in frame behind glass.  Put ribbons same color as ones on wine glasses, on one corner of frame.  I hope I got your creativity going.  when old enough drink your first  wine in the glasses!

j6MvCr6Naa	You should get The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. Why?<br>  <br>  Well the main story will take you at least 25-30 hours to complete. Then there are the guild story lines of which there are 5, each will take you around 10-15+ hours to complete. There are also many many random side quests that all together can take you more than 30+ hours to complete. Also, add in the potential for exploration and messing about and this game can easily last up to 150 hours. It lasted even longer for me. There is also the Knights of the Nine DLC quest line that you can buy which will take you anywhere from 5-10 hours to complete. And best of all there's an Expansion Pack for Oblivion called The Shivering Isles which has a whole new world to explore and will take more than 30+ hours to do everything in. So this game will keep you busy for very long time.<br>  <br>  Here's the average reviews score for this game:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/xbox360/elderscrolls4oblivion?q=the%20elder%20scrolls%20IV:%20oblivion" rel="nofollow">http://www.metacritic.com/games/platform...</a><br>  <br>  As you can see it's 94% meaning this is a brilliant game.<br>  <br>  Have Fun!!!<br>  <br>  And I agree with the above answerer, Fallout 3 is just as good and very similar since it was made with the same game ingine and the same developers: Bethesda.|`|djNeNEOuaa	i recommend fallout 3.  the story is time consuming, and with two or more down-loadable contents coming out in the next few months, there will be plenty to do.|`|CnHZt6fYaa	Don't get those games they suggest cause think about it you might do like me and kinda mess up and beat the game earlyer than usual so I suppose getting an online game that seems addicting like for me I play gta 4 for hours with my friends goofinf off so pick an online friendly game that has good storyline. (sorry I couldn't list any games)

GKiCsfrEaa	there are several ways, and they all depend on how strongly the cap is stuck in.<br>  <br>  1. Strong tape. Roll it round so thes sticky side is outwards in a loop. press as much possible onto the cap and yank it off.<br>  <br>  2. Sucion cup. Available at harware stores, get one a similar size to the cap. Put it on and pull.<br>  <br>  3. Knife. Take a knife to the edge of the cap, or any sharp blade. slip it down the side and flick the cap out. you may have to scrape away part of the cap to get it out.|`|9k9GfGyMaa	The easiest way to remove a cap from a Yoyojam yoyo is to use a suction cup that is close to the size of the Yoyojam cap.<br>  It works perfectly and can be found at a local hardware store.<br>  Another option is to break the cap with a small needle, but that will ultimately ruin the cap.  It's an easy way, but will have a negative effect.|`|8W53Y9vJaa	Hey I have the same yoyo and had the same problem. I had suction cups but they seemed too hard to pull off. It turns out that the width of duct tape is almost exactly the diameter of the cup in a Dark Magic. All you have to do is stick as much of the sticky part of the tape on the cap as you can then yank, and it comes right off.
Fm3WZ4djaa	so x360 can go in hd with hd/av cable which is in the box of console and its name is "component" and it is an analogic cable.<br>  but you can also display in hd with the hdmi cable, that is a digital one and you have to buy it separately, <br>  Both cables don't have to be used  together.<br>  anyway the hdmi one is better than the component one even if the difference is little.<br>  <br>  If there are any other dubts write them.|`|cUR7JyDFaa	If you plug the console into and HD t.v., it doesn't change the graphics.

If you travel alot, then get the PSP, if you don't get the PS2 even though I recommend the PS2 since it has about 3 times the amount of games as the PSP. If you really want to get something nice, save up your money and get a PS3. I recmmend the PS3 because it wn't be out of style like the Gamecube in another year or so and it has the best graphics ever. (I mean no one has better graphics than Blu-Ray.) The PS3 also has many games that are second to none.|`|E9Vr6ze2aa	PSP you can do so much on them (pictures, videos and music and reallyy good games)<br>  <br>  If your a final fantasy fan get Final Fantasy Crisis Core or Get the God of War game they have for it.|`|jMVmz62Haa	PS2- better graphics than psp and a lot more games.

Y6OpAffgaa	No. Any card that produces mana adds it until the end of the present turn. Fire-lit thicket, also, can be tapped for the colorless or used for the second effect and only one unless you have a separate way of untapping it. One way to keep your mana could be to use upwelling, which allows all players to keep mana indefinitely.|`|X9kNbpnQaa	The mana lasts until the end of the phase. The phases are Beginning (Untap Step, Upkeep Step, Draw Step), First Main Phase, Combat Phase, Second Main Phase, and End Phase. At the end of each phase each player's mana pool empties and that player loses life equal to the amount of mana was removed. This is referred to as Mana Burn.<br>  <br>  There are some cards in Kamigawa that specifically state their mana lasts until the end of turn. Orochi, I believe.

If it's not at the beginning, it should be somewhere in the pattern in one of the previous rounds.<br>  <br>  ~Edit~<br>  Since it's in a book, the "point" they are referring to might be elsewhere in the book.

M7G3MZb5aa	It is possible, but that figure is very high, blackjack players expect to win money based on "EV" which is short for expected value.<br>  <br>  Card counters will have evs ranging from 0.7-2.0% depednign on how good they are, how patient they are, and how much money they have to mess around with<br>  <br>  In addition to card conting, some players may use advanced techniques that can make A LOT of money, these techniques can boost the players ev to about double or tripple what it woudl be with cards counting alone.<br>  <br>  Ballpark, to make that kind of cash, you would need to be dropping bets of about 400 dollars per hand on two hands at a time, while playing with an weekly/daily  schedule of 20-40 hours a week<br>  <br>  You could do it with smaller bets playing more frewquently, but in generaly it woudl take either...<br>  -a lot of effort and a lot of money<br>  or<br>  -a lot of skill in using very advanced techniques that you wont read about in books<br>  <br>  I only expect to make 15k per year playing blackjack in part time, but using very advanced techniques that boost my ev to about 2%|`|l4ZQchFkaa	I was a blackjack dealer at Binions Horseshoe (Vegas) from 1991 - 1998 Then went on the floor from 98 - 02. We had to learn the "hi op 2" counting system, to screen out the card counters. Even when you count cards, its not guarantee! Like the dude above me stated, BANK ROLL is king. I've watched more card counters lose than you can shake a stick at. And "if" they start to make a comeback, we would have to throw em out! But I have also watched people play for 3 days strait trying to get "unstuck". Most of the time, if a player was stuck a ton of money but had enough BANK ROLL and enough B**** they would get even, or sometimes win..<br>  <br>  Oh, the answer to your question! $6000 a month Is very possible.|`|HDK9MhONaa	It all depends on how good you are and what kind of bankrool you start with. If you are good at blackjack and have a large enough bankroll to start, then yes, it is quite possible.

mX7yzVEraa	This is an obvious one, but you could be Haruhi Suzumiya. <br>  From Ouran you could be one of the girls in the yellow dresses, (I don't know their names or what they're called, I just started the manga) if not, then you could cut your hair and be Haruhi or Kyouya Ootori. He has glasses, though. <br>  In Death Note, you could be Mikami. He has black hair, but you could probably pass with brown, not many people cosplay him, I find.<br>  In Bleach, all I can think of right now is Rukia, you'd have to style your hair for her, though. <br>  Naruto, it's just a suggestion, but Kiba's sister and mother. XD On a more serious note, there's Hinata from Shippuden, even though she has blue hair, I have seen brown-haired Hinata's. Unless you want to be really accurate. If you wouldn't mind crosplay, you could be Neji and maybe even Itachi, I suppose.<br>  Most of these characters do not have blue eyes, really, but I tried. : )|`|g3h9zQUgaa	what you could do is dye your hair pink and be sakura.

The Raging Bull is probably the funner coaster at Great America. The Viper is a wooden roller coaster so it doesn't throw you around as much. The V2 make your stomach drop, but not as much as the Giant Drop. The Demon has a lot of loops, but it doesn't make you feel sick. Just don't worry about it and remember to have fun!

wAiVxAKNaa	Hi.<br>  <br>  I would not recommend the Dark Bow for training. It is INCREDIBLY slow, and you could probably fire about 3 shots from a Rune Crossbow before you could fire a second shot from a Dark Bow.<br>  <br>  Your Ranged level is good for the bow, but the bow itself is not worthwhile unless you are a pk-er, which is the bow's main role. As its special (with Dragon Arrows) is the bow's only real use, I do not recommend it for training.<br>  <br>  A rune crossbow with high leveled bolts like Diamond (e) or just plain adamant bolts (even mithril, really) would be best for training, as you can fire bolts from a crossbow about 3 times as fast as shooting shots from a dark bow.<br>  <br>  So, unless you are a pk-er, I would not buy the bow.|`|Fyo6g3Xtaa	it is if u have money to buy sh*tloads of dragon arrows or rune arrows  if you really wanna hit good<br>  <br>  *hope dis helped*|`|jBFOJhF8aa	Yes. Its great to have a dark bow @ 80+ ranged. Ur max would be somewhere around 40+ with 85 range and d arrows so imagine 88 ranged eh? Btw  Wanna link up on runescape?

DFZWhlT4aa	Actually, I don't understand what the other answers are trying to say. First of all, if you are looking to buy a new xbox 360, you either have to get the arcade version (no hard drive), the pro version (60 GB hard drive), or the Elite (120 GB hard drive).  Also, the xbox live is used to play games online against other people. If you can connect an ethernet cord from your computer to your xbox, then you will be fine.  When you first activate, you will receive 1 month free of xbox live.  After that you will have to pay about $50 for a full year.  If you end up purchasing the pro version (60 GB), then you don't need to worry about the red rings of death. They have a new chip in them that stops them from going bad. If you somehow managed to still get the red rings of death, you will have a 3 year warranty.<br>  <br>            Hope that helped!|`|jxpV13rTaa	the 20 gig can log onto xbox live if thats what you mean. xbox live is the online community. and the 20gig is alright. very tiny and not a great price. if you want to go online you have to buy a wireless adapter (100 bucks) and pay for online (50 bucks) so be prepared for that. also watch for red rings of death, they happen on 33% of all consoles.|`|u0ydx14Yaa	I dont get it.if your saying do you get xbxo live with the xbox 360 then no.you have to buy it sepertae

D7O3Bfhkaa	What're you going for ?<br>  A beatdown or burn ?<br>  <br>  Boarden Beatdown:<br>  <br>  This strategy revolves around two cards: "Morphtronic Boarden" and "Morphtronic Map". Boarden's effect allows other "Morphtronic" monsters to be saved from being destroyed by battle, and the Field Spell allows them to gain 300 ATK per Morph Counter it has. Since a Morph Counter is added every time a monster (regardless of ownership) has its Battle Position changed. Cards like "Stumbling", "Cloudian - Eye of the Typhoon" "Level Limit - Area B", "No Entry!!", Zero Gravity, "Gadget Driver" and "Enemy Controller" can raise the Morph Counters on "Morphtronic Map" quickly, and "Solemn Judgment", "Magic Jammer", and the like can prevent its premature destruction. Once there are enough counters and you have a lot of "Morphtronic" monsters on your side of the field, switch Boardon to Attack Position to allow all of them to attack directly. For cards like Magic Cylinder or Mirror Force, have a Cameran in defense position to prevent them from being targeted or activate Gadget Driver's effect and stop your monsters attack. Should you not have Boardon, simply use this strategy as a Beatdown until you gain "Morphtronic Boarden". You can use "Morphtronic Forcefield" to add "Morphtronic Boarden" to your hand.<br>  <br>  Recommended Cards:<br>  <br>      * Morphtronic Boarden<br>      * Morphtronic Map<br>      * Morphtronic Celfon (use its swarming effect)<br>      * Morphtronic Boomboxen (use its double attack effect)<br>      * Morphtronic Radion (use its increase ATK effect)<br>      * Morphtronic Cameran (use its effect target-negating effect)<br>      * Gadget Driver (In case your opponent has a set "Mirror Force")<br>      * Level Limit - Area B (to add counters)<br>      * Stumbling (to add counters) <br>  <br>  Clocken Countdown Burn Deck:<br>  <br>  This type of Burn deck relies on the Defense Position effect of "Morphtronic Clocken", which is exactly the same as "Wave-Motion Cannon". Having at least two copies of each of these cards active on the field would result to you only waiting two turns for your victory by tributing all four of them for a grand total of 8000 inflicted damage. As with a lot of Burn decks, this tactic requires a lot of buildup. But, using "Morphtronic Celfon" and "Morphtronic Boarden", you can rapidly search for Clocken and immediately summon it in Defense Position with the former, while at the same time, saving it from being destroyed in battle with the latter. two "Morphtronic Radion" in Defense Position can replace "Morphtronic Boarden" temporarily, as their increasing effect would put Clocken at 3100 DEF. Use counter traps, "Prime Material Dragon", "Stardust Dragon" or "My Body as a Shield" to make sure Clocken or "Wave-Motion Cannon" stays on the field. Unfortunately, Prime Material Dragon also conflicts in a Burn Deck, so make sure there is no faceup one when dealing Burn damage.<br>  edit Recommended Cards<br>  <br>      * Morphtronic Clocken<br>      * Morphtronic Celfon<br>      * Morphtronic Radion<br>      * Morphtronic Boarden<br>      * Morphtronic Datatron<br>      * Prime Material Dragon<br>      * Wave-Motion Cannon<br>      * Stardust Dragon<br>      * My Body as a Shield<br>      * Destruction Jammer<br>      * Morphtronic Monitron<br>      * Light of Intervention<br>      * Ultimate Offering<br>      * Book of Moon<br>      * Prevention Star<br>      * Desert Sunlight<br>      * Windstorm of Etaqua|`|yzpU5fZJaa	is this burn or beatdown?<br>  i see 3 boomboxen so i think beatdown:<br>  try something like this:<br>  <br>  monsters:<br>  celfon x3<br>  radion x3<br>  boomboxen x3<br>  cameran x2<br>  bordon x3<br>  pachin x2<br>  cyber dragon<br>  <br>  spells:<br>  inferno reckless summon x3<br>  machine duplication x2<br>  limiter removal<br>  morphtronic field x3<br>  mst<br>  morphtronic accelerator x3<br>  shrink x2<br>  heavy storm<br>  monster reborn<br>  brain control<br>  <br>  traps:<br>  torrential tribute<br>  pheonix wing wind blast x2<br>  solemn judgement x2<br>  mirror force<br>  <br>   this is a good beatdown deck or you could go for the unpopular and not so well working burn:<br>  <br>  monsters:<br>  clocken x3<br>  datatron x3<br>  celfon x3<br>  boomboxen x3<br>  radion x2<br>  marshmallon<br>  spirt  reaper<br>  magnen x3<br>  <br>  spells:<br>  wave motion cannon x3<br>  inferno reckless summon x2<br>  level limit area B<br>  nightmare steelcage x2<br>  swords of revealing<br>  monster reborn<br>  heavy storm<br>  dark door x2<br>  <br>  traps;<br>  sakaratsu x3<br>  botomless trap hole x3<br>  mirror force<br>  torrential tribute<br>  <br>  this deck BURNS!!!!!!|`|Q3FdhYgRaa	7/10 take out all the SKYFIRE|`|eAoUXx3Qaa	submit your deck to the deck review section of<br>  www.teamhelmet.com<br>  then the deck will be posted with you name<br>  plus it will be fixed

GDKBqwwJaa	I applied in early January and they ended up calling me in the beginning of february. There big hiring time was in february, but they are always hiring. If you don't hear from them after about a week or so, I would give Human Resources a call. If they have you come for an interview, dress nicely and bring a Resume if you have one. You should get hired, because they hire just about anyone who walks in there. Good luck!|`|RvVvaVsAaa	just like ANY other job, you wait for a call and then go in and have the interview. or they do the interview over the phone.. ammature..|`|d8HwFub8aa	It depends on when you filled out the app. You should here back from them in 2 to 3 weeks. If you dont hear from them by then then either call the human resource department or go down there. It should hopefully be easy to get the job. If you dont have a criminal backgroud or anything like that then you should be fine. They usually do call you to do the interview over the phone. But like the girl above me said be presitent and show them that your really interested in working there.|`|yDnBqGheaa	Going down there and bugging them is always better than waiting around for a phone call.<br>  <br>  Cuz if you dont do it, someone else will, and they most likely would choose the person standing in the door than take the time to call someone.

(insider)(read the question) ther's a hella lot more i could add but judgeing from the question details i doubt you cud do it =P no offense lol<br>  <br>  <br>  add me "scotty0619" and "bam_rules75" without the quotes of course! lol|`|Mo5TIxZwaa	This is a very good question with many different answers. I will vaguely touch on some of the different money making methods I have used if you would like more details on any one please feel free to contact me either in game or via yahoo.<br>  …1)Non combat skills<br>  ~Fishing~ Sharks, and monk fish, Fishing trawler for Manta ray and sea turtle you can even “free load” although this is unpopular with other players.<br>  ~Hunting~ polar kebbits, carnivorous chinchompas (stackable)<br>  ~Farming~ Grow Marigolds, ranarr, snapdragon, spirit weed and toadflax.<br>  ~rune crafting~ is almost always profitable (You can kill Banshee's for noted pure essence a lot faster than mining for it ) If your not high enough for laws or natures there are worlds where you can run these for others.<br>  ~Cooking~ Tuna Potatoes, curry stew, and pizza’s<br>  ~Thieving~ cave goblin wires from Dorgesh-kaan.<br>  ~construction~ Make Teletabs via Lectern in player owned house.<br>  ~Mining~ coal is slow but pays very well. If you are high enough Adamintite and Runite.<br>  …2) Using Combat<br>  ~Dragons using Melee or Range.<br>  Green dragons in the Wildy or in the chaos tunnels,<br>  Blue dragons in Edgeville dungeon, in ogre enclave and there is one in legends guild.<br>  Black dragons with 70+ ranged or Kill them with protect from Melee (this cuts into profit as your using prayer potions though this can be minimalized by using prayer saving armor)<br>  ~Chaos druids, Unicorns, Moss giants, Vampires, White wolves, Cockroaches, Jungle spiders, Iban Disciples and Avanasis are all good monsters to fight for profitable drops.<br>  *If you’re not interested in the prayer experience you can always kill and sell the bones. Ourg, Daganoth. Raurg, Fayrg and Dragon, sell best but even regular bones sell well.<br>  ** A fast way to big money is PKing but this is a risky endeavor. You can loose just as well as win. Remember there is always someone bigger and meaner than you... So you are liable to loose more money than you win. The more you risk the better your pay off its all on how gutsy you are.<br>  …3) Slayer~ In general Slayer monsters pay well. Consider the food you use an investment. Most assignments drops more than pay for the food needed to fight them. The possibility of receiving a rare drop makes them even more enticing.<br>  …4) Merchanting...watch the prices on the exchange then buy popular items when low and sell when high… There are several items you can buy in shops all over Runescape then sell for profit at the exchange, but as most of these are not stackable this can take several runs. Pineapples, seaweed, vials, bolts of cloth, Sacks, baskets, dyes, tinderboxes and Battlestaves are all examples of items that can be bought in stores all over Runescape and sold on the exchange for more.<br>  … 5) There are several quests that are well worth the effort.After doing the Throne of Miscellania (and Royal trouble) quests,You can get your kingdom workers to gather resources that can be sold. And if you do the Hand in sand quest you can get free sand daily.<br>  …6) You can collect Snape grass, Mort myre fungus, Planks, White berries, Potato cacti, Flax (Spin the flax into bowstrings for even more profit),Red spider eggs, Blue dragon scales, and Swamp tar. All these sell well.<br>  …7)Clue scrolls are a roll of the dice but they have the possibility of large large payoffs! Clue scrolls which are dropped by certain monsters more often then others... (I kill Daganoth’s with a cannon to get mine fast ) .<br>  … 8) You can hang out at the Falador drop room... I find wearing a ring of wealth helps (this is controversial)... it’s just up to luck what you can get and how fast you can get it.<br>  …9) One of the newest ways of making money is the recent Diversions and distractions addition... Penguin hunting can make as much as 97.5k a week and Shooting stars can give you 106 k a day in runes coins and ore.<br>  ….The thing is the game is designed to take time (which is why my answer is so long).. Your suppose to have to work for it. Jagex does a good job of making sure there are no quick ways to fast cash! I answer this same question for a lot of people, often they want to know which one is the best method. There is no best method. They are all good solid ways to try out and figure which one YOU like the best (my personal favorite is chaos druids)... remember the point of the game is to have fun. So find the one you like, sit back relax and enjoy!|`|KFDzhDowaa	I suggest going with woodcutting since it is faster and easier than mining. If you want to go with woodcutting, get yourself a rune axe if you don't have one already and train your level high enough to cut yews. Then just start cutting yew till you get a full inventory of yew logs, put them in your bank, and when you think you have enough start selling them. I don't know what price they are since I have been banned for years now and don't ever want to go back, yet I still have some knowledge of the game left in me. <br>  <br>  For mining, the lowest level ore you want to sell is coal. Do exactly what I said for woodcutting, but obviously your going to need a rune pick axe and not a woodcutting axe. If you want to make a bit more for each one you sell, smelt w\e ore you are mining and sell those.|`|jli8ytQnaa	This is a moderatly good way of making money with no skills needed.<br>  <br>  If you didn't start or finish Fremennik Trials yet, then go ahead and start it, but don't finish it. When you've started it, go back to the closest bank and remove everything you have on you and get 100k. After that, go to Waterbirth Island (there's a sailor at the left pier who can take you there for 1k). You will see that there's a lot of snape grass, but if you walk further there's more. Keep walking north on the island and finally you'll see a lot of snape grass. After a while of picking them up, go back to the sailor and tell him to go back to the mainland. When you're back, go to Peer the Seer (he's located next to one of those buildings facing south of you) and after a while of talking he will deposit your items for you. Drop your money and then deposit all the snape grass. Then pick the money up again and start all over.<br>  <br>  If you did finish Fremennik Trials, then you will have to complete any of the Fremennik Achievement Diaries (any one, it doesn't matter). After doing all those, then you can wear the sea boots. This way you won't have to pay every time you go to the island. Be sure to be wearing the boots though, and the seer will deposit your items for you.<br>  <br>  You can make over 250k per hour, and if you pick fast, maybe 300-330k/hr.|`|0zVUXl0aaa	i am not a mem so excuse my retarded sugestans but what about green d' hides kill green drags<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  u sound exactly like my cuz exept he is lvl 71 and has 13k

vtJDHJDYaa	Here's a summary of the story:<br>  Kingdom Hearts begins on Destiny Islands, where Sora, Riku, and Kairi live. The three friends want to leave the islands to explore new worlds and have prepared a raft for this purpose. One night, the islands are attacked by darkness and shadow creatures—the Heartless. Sora seeks out his friends, finding Riku, who disappears into darkness. At the same time, Sora obtains the Keyblade. The islands are presumed as destroyed, and Sora is left adrift. Meanwhile, King Mickey has left his world to deal with the increasing darkness and left instructions for mage Donald and knight Goofy to find the "key" that will save the King and the Worlds.<br>  <br>  Donald and Goofy use the Gummi Ship to travel to Traverse Town, to where Sora has drifted. Sora encounters the Heartless again, and meets Leon, who explains the Heartless are beings that consume hearts, and that the Keyblade is the only weapon capable of defeating them. A man named Ansem, the leader of Leon's home world, is said to have studied the Heartless. Sora meets Donald and Goofy and the three decide to travel together; Donald and Goofy to find Mickey, and Sora to find Kairi and Riku. The three go to various worlds based on Disney films, finding that the Keyblade also locks "Keyholes", passages the Heartless use to take the heart of a world. A group of Disney villains, led by Maleficent, seek out the seven Princesses of Heart to unlock the Keyhole that leads to Kingdom Hearts, a repository of knowledge and power and the source of all hearts. This group includes Riku, whom Maleficent promises she will help in finding Kairi. Maleficent sows distrust in Riku, telling him Sora has abandoned him and Kairi for new friends and the Keyblade. An increasingly antagonistic Riku finds Kairi's body, but cannot find her heart.<br>  <br>  Sora and his friends eventually arrive at Hollow Bastion, the homeworld of Ansem and the headquarters of Maleficent. Riku takes the Keyblade from Sora, revealing him as the true Keyblade master and that Sora only received it in his absence. Donald and Goofy, taking their order to follow the "key" seriously, leave with Riku. Sora challenges Riku, stating his heart derives strength from his friends; his friends return to him, as does the Keyblade. In his shame, Riku meets a cloaked man who goads him to give into the darkness. The three engage and kill Maleficent, but then meet a strangely-behaved Riku with a Keyblade that unlocks hearts. Sora finds Kairi's body and Riku, who reveals himself to be Ansem, possessing Riku's body. Ansem explains that Kairi is a Princess of Heart and her heart was trapped within Sora's body since Destiny Islands were destroyed. After defeating Ansem, Sora uses Ansem's Keyblade to unlock his heart by impaling himself, releasing both his and Kairi's heart. Kairi's heart returns to her body, in turn completing the final Keyhole, while Sora becomes a Heartless. Sora is restored to human form by Kairi and resolves to confront Ansem.<br>  <br>  Ansem is found in End of the World, the combined remnants of worlds taken by the Heartless. Ansem explains his belief that the nature of the heart revolves around darkness, and he seeks Kingdom Hearts, as that would be the ultimate darkness. However, upon opening the door to Kingdom Hearts, it reveals its light, overwhelming and destroying Ansem. Beyond the door are King Mickey and Riku, and they help Sora and the others close the door, as there are many Heartless beyond it. Mickey and Sora use their Keyblades to lock the door. The worlds lost to the Heartless reconstruct themselves, separating Sora and Kairi. The game concludes as Sora, Donald, and Goofy resolve to find Riku and Mickey.<br>  <br>  Or you can try this site which practically has all the information on Kingdom Hearts.<br>  <a href="http://kingdomhearts.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">http://kingdomhearts.wikia.com/wiki/Main...</a>|`|PTovC2Dqaa	Here's information on the Kingdom Hearts games, including the plot/story:<br>  <br>  -Kingdom Hearts 1:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_hearts" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_hea...</a><br>  <br>  -Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Hearts:_Chain_of_Memories" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Hea...</a><br>  <br>  -Kingdom Hearts 2:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Hearts:_Chain_of_Memories" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Hea...</a>|`|MMV6wz3oaa	www.khinsider.com it has everything you need to know about kingdom hearts even screen shots of the new ones coming out|`|KFDzhDowaa	Search around in wikipidia.

tOzcWE8Eaa	no it doesn't i tryed it with my cousins ds and my wii.|`|PGAKu4Mzaa	Nintendo's community has a few selected pokemon that are not allowed to be used and will be marked as banned when chosen. They don't exactly have a way of blocking pokemon made with gameshark or action replay as of yet. <br>  <br>  Their other attempts at stopping hacking is EV/IV value checks and Ability checks. EV/IV checks turn the pokemon that have stats past 510 into bad eggs but it isnt permanent. <br>  <br>  Ability checks (new feature with dsi) checks if the ability is correct. Example would be the popular spiritomb with wonderguard. On nintendo dsi with pokemon diamond, pearl, etc. it can be found and marked as a banned pokemon. My cousin leroy found that one out himself the hard way.|`|80f417bed146e65ac06fc0c0c3251ed9aa	no they cannot and would not do that, do you have any idea how many people use cheats on their games? first it would be impossible and second even if it were possible it would take a ridiculous amount of effort to do.  in short, i think you are safe.|`|KFDzhDowaa	I'm sure they would do something about it.

The main way is by talking. It takes a bit, but after a while the 2 Sims will become friends (you will get a notice.) and then if you continue, they will start to love each other (again, you will be alerted of this). Then the next time you go to talk, their should be new options that have to do with love and stuff, such as proposing.

WxmNSxNGaa	First off, you shouldn't be calling 2-3 suited. I know you've heard you should play suited connectors sometimes (which is true) but usually not in raised pots, and not 2-3. 2-3 unsuited is the worst hand you can get in many situations, and suited is only slightly better. <br>  <br>  And you're flop was not quite a good as you think. Someone could already have the nut straight. Someone could have a higher flush draw, and anyone with a spade will beat you with running spades. And if some hit trips, a board pair makes them a boat that always beats you. You're not always going to worry about all this, but it's a factor in multi-way pots, and really makes a difference. <br>  <br>  Look man, as a rule of thumb, you never raise with a draw if you don't think there's a chance you could get your opponent(s) to fold. You never call with a draw if you're not getting reasonably pot odds or implied odds.<br>  <br>  Your opponent was not going to fold after betting 7 times the pot. You're not getting even close to proper pot odds. This is an EASY fold.|`|pAqfWJ8Haa	lots of outs 4 handed.....you ssid IF this situation happening....you won't win often but when you do it is more than your overall expected loss....but it will realistically only happen once per session.   sure go ahead and play every time|`|3Iyu7hrcaa	We have no idea of your starting stack, but you shouldn't be calling 2-3 suited to 3 times raises.  And if you are, you certainly can't be going on tilt when you lose the hand, as you'll be doing that a lot.<br>  <br>  You are going to hit your flush and lose to higher flushes.  And you are counting your outs, without factoring in that some of your outs give opponents a full house.|`|83cdbd393e5ac25e610d2f2c6db6aa9daa	Yea I think you have to call there, you have a ton of outs..the only thing you did wrong there is call the pre flop raise with 23 suited out of position in the BB, theres no need for you to do that and get involved with that hand just for this reason, if you hit a big draw on the flop like you did your forced to go with it..IMO and gamble..where instead you could of folded pre flop and look for a better spot,...to many players defend there big blind like its a must..its not..ur gonna be out of position everytime and thats not a good thing..just fold it let them take ur BB and move on to the next hand.|`|1Ms1QqPTaa	i guess you have a lot of outs but they are low, Its hard to say with out know everyones stack situation  but i don't  think I would play 2 -3 with all that pre flop raising|`|68uyvAZMaa	hello|`|UVUYG5jaaa	if you have 2-3 spades, and you get a 4-spade, a 5-heart, a 8-spade.....you stay with that hand until the final card...true...its a hard hand to play, you might lose,.....but you might win?|`|OHDXO5Dsaa	I dont think that you should have made that call.  Knowing that he bet 7 times the pot means that he has a good hand.  It is not good to go all in on a draw especially with such a low hand.  you had the lowest flush possible if it hit.  I would not make the call. the hand itself at the flop wasnt that bad but you also got to watch the betting patterns of your opponents.  If two people call when you go all in you know that you are in trouble. gl in the future thou.

5nwOZLgqaa	well the first demon wall is optional but if  you beat it you get a chance to get a high level sword early in the game. You need to be a higher level than that and i suggest learning all three of your quikenings for each character that way you can just bombard him with your quickening attacks that's how i did it its been a while since I played that game but if i remember i was in the high lvl 20's to 30's. Oh and heres another tip once your selected character uses his quickening attack switch him out with one of your back ups so then you can cause higher damage on your next attack. Oh and be sure to have a gambit or something that helps protect you from the silence spell.|`|uctxzjIIaa	Level up about 10 times, or do a large Quickening chain.<br>  <br>  Those are about the only options.|`|1K8NPRUOaa	the only way to defeat the first wall is to have the best fire spell and the best weapons available, but unfortunately, you won't have them available at this time, so the best bet is to wait until your party has the best equipment later in the game.

Build two uprights out of clay (or use a pair of sticks with a fork in the top of each.  Attach a crossbar to the uprights.  Tie another stick to the crossbar so that its middle is lashed to the middle of the crossbar.  Stick a lump of clay on one end of the lashed stick.  Tie a string with a little pouch/bucket etc. to the other end.  You'll be shaduffing in no time!
