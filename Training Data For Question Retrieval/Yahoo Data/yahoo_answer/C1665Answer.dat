VxtSO8BGaa	Well...perhaps it's because we are the 2nd. largest country in the world with a relatively small population as compares to the U.S.    We have a modern infra structure in most cases , sound banks so far and are a completely free democratic country, quite liberal and we don't believe in carrying guns !    We didn't go out and "win our West" we just moved out there !    We didn't revolt against the British but gained our independence rather quietly actually ! *S*    There is a plethora of reasons ( too numerous to list here )including our vast resources etc. etc and our quality of life, health care, multi-cuturalism, private worship, just a lot of things !    Our life style is more subdued and most people don't suffer from "Mall-itus" and we still have our buffalo !    Too many reasons to give you and I guess my answer was silly but Canada is steeped in tradition and has a long and glorious history but we are just quiet about it !    Glad to help ! *S* (Michael C...)|`|AA12095483	Because Canada doesn't want to go down the same road as the USA. Canada is a totally different country - different politics, different beliefs, different value systems. Yes, Canadians and Americans speak the same language, but they use it differently. Similar words mean different things. And the Canadian ideology is dramatically different than that currently found in the US.|`|azypqsphaa	u really dont know ?..we would NEVER willingly do that EVER..."from my cold dead hands"|`|2wyDALHgaa	Why doesn't the US come with Canada?|`|4INE794zaa	Come with you where?

6cf0275dfcf47b6a37124ae7cc800816aa	It takes a while to get over, but slowly and surely your good times will start to outweigh the bad ones. I'd say realise that this is short-term (if it is?) and create a calendar. When you can see it visually in front of you and see the days being crossed off you'll realise that the only way to get used to it is to think how lucky you are and to enjoy it.     A lot of people would crave the opportunity to be in your position. Call home regularly but not too much...if you do you'll only think about what you're missing instead of living in the moment.     Watch a tv channel/movie in English....just hearing your home language may be comforting too.    Take some photo's of when you're having a good time. That way you'll be able to positively start building good memories from France - and that will help you to forget the homesick part.     Hope that helps a little....stay in there.
ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	Wind chill? What's that? LOL    For a number of reasons, we get a bunch of questions asking what its really like in Los Angeles.    First of all, I'll tell you what it's NOT like: It's not like anything on TV. People watch shows on TV and think thats what its like out here. The Real OC, Newport Beach, The Hills, etc. Ever wonder why people in those shows never have to pay bills, do laundry, and are NEVER stuck in traffic? Because its FAKE. And the news doesnt help either, since they know that sex and sensationalism sells. News flash: There arent running gun battles in the street. There arent shootouts every day. Also, you dont see celebrities just walking down the street, all glammed up, or sipping a cappuccino at Starbucks waiting to sign autographs. We don't go surfing during lunch hour.     Some sections are REALLY nice, others are ghetto. Too many people have this vision in their head that LA is one or the other (either Beverly Hills or Compton). In fact, most of it is working class and middle class stiffs working to pay the bills.    You NEED a car to live in Southern California. We dont have an effective public transportation like New York or San Francisco. One reason is that LA is larger in area than either of those, without a central hub where everything is. Back in the 1960s, we might have done it. But by the time local governments got their act together, it was much more difficult to make a working public transit system. Also, unlike NY, we have earthquakes, which make it a little more difficult to build underground.     The freeway traffic is probably the worst thing about living here. The 405 is the worst. Know why they call it the 405? Because you go 4 o' 5 miles per hour, and it takes 4 o' 5 hours to get where you're going. Freeway Traffic is bad from 6-10 AM and bad from 3-7 PM. I don't know why they call it rush hour. It's more than an hour, and nobody's rushing, that's for sure.    The gangs are the cause of many rumors. Keep in mind that there are gangs in any large town, in every part of the country. In LA, the gangs aren't really downtown, they are in South LA, East LA, and north Long Beach (an extension of the South LA gangs, actually). And here's the deal: Mostly, they just kill each other.    Gas is expensive in California. Its about 20-30 cents above the national average.     Yes, gas and real estate are very expensive in SoCal. However, this would be the best time to BUY a house because it's a buyer's market right now. There are a lot of foreclosures, and too many houses on the market.     Yep, freeways are a drag, it's smoggy in summer, and expensive to live here. Yet, if it's so bad, why do we have thousands and thousands of people moving here?     Weather, Activities, Plenty of jobs, Beaches, mountains, deserts all within driving distance, and plenty of opportunity for those who have the skills and tenacity.    In colder parts of the country, people keep their cars in their garages all winter. Kids get snow toys for Christmas. Here, kids get BIKES, scooters, and skateboards. 10 AM Christmas morning, the streets are FULL of kids on their new bikes, scooters, etc.     The job market is good here, mainly because there are SO many people here that it creates its own job market. Then there are MANY industries, including tourism, entertainment, shipping, manufacturing, etc. Its an incredible economy.    However, it is not for everyone. Every time someone posts this question, you get the LA haters who post their bile and venom. A lot of them dont know what they are talking about. Some people never even visit, and hate it on principle and stereotypes. Some actually visited once, and found out it wasnt like it was on TV, and it certainly wasnt Mayberry. And some actually lived here, and couldnt deal with the expense, the traffic, or the somewhat impersonal nature of living in a large metropolis. To those I would say good luck to you wherever you are, but please dont spew your hatred in this forum.     As for lifestyle, its rather casual. You work during the week, and then go do something fun on the weekend, so that you can impress your coworkers around the water cooler on Monday.     To summarize, LA a HUGE metropolis that really defies easy description. I live in one of the nicer suburbs, but the commute is no fun, often 1-2 hours each way each day. However, 340+ days of sunshine really helps. Yeah, it's expensive. Mrs. Obviousman and I both have to work to pay the mortgage. But is it worth it? You bet!|`|UyyXuU6Daa	its fantastic most of the year...i'd say today was probably one of the coldest days of the year [56 degrees].    you should visit during december...its soooo green.    granted, the summer is when its supper hot but nature is like dead during that time period lol.    we don't need to buy super huge and bulky coats for the windy weather, a light jacket will do just fine.    it doesn't snow here...however; the nearest place to get a cabin and go skiing or snowboarding is like 1 hour drive away at Big Bear.    yeah...southern california is a nice place to live.|`|xqtKODvbaa	oh yeah the weather is great, unless you live in the valley or the desert    but like any other large cities we have our great deal of crime, gangs, political problems, poverty, and now unemployment problems, and for some reason too many damn high speed chases, there's been like 4 in 2 days!!    on top of that we do have unpredictable earthquakes,|`|C6WloQoaaa	if you like mild, sunny weather year round, then yes.    if you like changing seasons, thunderstorms, and dense forests, then no.    if you have  a car and don't mind driving everywhere, then yes.    if you even sometimes like to walk to the mailbox, then no.    if you like an active, outspoken, competitive community, then yes.    if you like simple, straight forward, genuine folk, then no.    good economy.  good surfing.  good food.  polluted air.  gang violence.  hyper-materialism.|`|d12a585a9f486535d07b0683ef24b00eaa	it has its good points along with the bad points..

MySpace is hardly ever used.    Can't answer the last question, social networks aren't my thing. I have an account in all four but I mostly just sign in, check messages (sometimes) and then sign out.

This may apply to your expertise, but it's mostly applicable to doctors, agricultural workers, real estate agents, jobs in high demand.

jw8Pwe1Naa	I have been to Saskatoon once, but I really loved it there. I only love about a five hour drive away, in Edmonton. Saskatoon is a beautiful city with lots of parks, trails and attractions. The U of Saskatchewan is the largest university in the province, and takes up about a third of the city. Hence, Saskatoon is a college town, meaning that even though it is a small city, the population is young and lively. People from Saskatoon are really friendly, and it is a really local place with not too many visitors, so they welcome the new people really well, from what I hear. In Canada, we do not work on a 4.0 scale, except when you get to university. We are on a percentage scale. But I will weigh it out in letters for you. Your A would be 80-100% here, B would be 65-79, C would be 50-64. Anything below 50 is a fail. I hope you enjoy Saskatoon, and feel free to contact me if you need any other help or information! :)|`|azypqsphaa	please just stay in texas, u won't like it here|`|8G42oyydaa	You are misinformed about the grading system for starters, and you might be behind in some core subjects for the same grade level in Canada. But hey welcome to Canada. Hope you have a good time. Saskatchewan people are pretty friendly for the most part, cold winters though.|`|tq6fCjy1aa	80 is an A in Canada? Is it that the tests are more challenging to make up for the grade leniency?  It sounds like a terrific opportunity.  Saskatoon is a very pretty town on the river and it's cold in winter, but it's a friendly place.     It's a very clean environment and everything north of Saskatoon is historic and fascinating such as a July fest called "Back to Batoche Days" and Prince Albert National Park where spruce trees meet boreal forest.|`|uqKpjV6qaa	The schools don't go by As and Bs. We go by percents. 50% is passing and 100% is the highest you can get. Schools here tend to be more difficult than in the United States but once you get used to it you should be fine. Saskatoon is a beautiful place. If you do end up going there it will be worth it. The people there are really nice. Saskatoon is a beautiful province and I'm sure you will enjoy it. If you have any other questions please feel free to email me :)|`|sgclB6v9aa	ahhh don't worry too much, you seem to have an enthusiastic attitude and that's what matters.     My highschool in BC gave an 86% an A .  And our grade point average system is generally out of 10 (it roughly corresponds to your average grade percentage, though there are other calculations made in universities I think).     Saskatoon is a big-little city, and I think you'll learn the ins and outs of it in no time.  I have a good friend who loves his university there, and many friends have had a lovely time visiting.  Dress warm, the winters are VERY cold and windy.      such a great experience, have fun!

I have a ton of relatives in San Diego, but I did not want to get caught up in the local thing. I usually visited for special occasions like a luau or something.   I really wanted to experience being in college and being on my own.

XLQ9wCUaaa	My mom lived in Canada in 1964 (she was 14) and her favorite band was... the Beatles.    In this area of Canada they were really far behind on the trends and I think the Canadians were pretty much into the same bands as Americans. They watched the Ed Sullivan show and similar shows, and got their musical influence from there.    Most of the radio stations in this area at that time were country. That's it.   So as far as Canadian early 60's bands, your best bet would be to see who was climbing the charts that year/those years and investigate which of them were Canadian or had Canadian band members.    From what my mom tells me everyone in her generation liked Elvis or the Beatles~ ;)|`|E5gaKzCsaa	You can look for Canadian rock history on the net. There are probably more well-known Canadian musicians from that time than you think, though if you weren't there for the 60s, 70s and even 50s you aren't likely to recognize the names.
5HcnqxKQaa	Popular bookstore has them. Try the bigger outlets.    https://www.popular.com.sg/jsp/main_page...    Another option's Challenger (63367747) on the 6th floor of Funan.

xIHgTqVhaa	Yes, you can but it's a little complicated.    I'm a former Flight Attendant and I fly a lot with my three children, often on United since they were small.     Here are the relevant pages on United's site;    http://www.united.com/page/article/0,672...    http://www.united.com/page/article/0,672...    No need to stuff your purse into your diaper bag. The purse is allowed as a "personal item" over the carry-on limit. I recommend that you take a *very* small purse that can hang around your neck. Put your wallet, cell phone, etc. in that and then use an oversized backpack instead of a diaper bag. One size bigger than the standard sized backpacks still meet the airline's requirements and this way, your hands are free. I have one with a handle on the top so I can carry it either way, and hang it off the stroller.     In addition to the stroller, which will not count against your baggage allowance, make sure to have a *good* baby carrier. I don't recommend front packs like the Bjorn. Hopefully you have something more useful and comfortable so that you're not one of the many parents I saw in my career trying to get off the plane with a sleeping child over their shoulder. The carrier will not count against your carry-on allowance. These are so great because wraps, slings and pouchs also serve as blankets, sun covers and baby changers.    Just a reminder to not have your baby in the carrier for take-off and landing. It's safer if the child is loose in your lap and not attached to you in any way.    Try to not bring anything on board which is not related to you and your baby. It's not easy and you'll have enough with the baby.     I do recommend that you find out how full your flight is and see if you can bring your car seat on board and use it. Not only will your baby be safer but this is much more comfortable for both of you. This too, shouldn't count against your baggage allowance. If you need a car seat at your destination, it really shouldn't be checked as luggage where it can be lost and/or broken in the hold. Having it on board guarentees that it will be at your detination and if you are not successful, the car seat will be "gate-checked" at the aircraft door, which is gentlier and more sure than checking it in as baggage.    When you check-in, ask about any empty seats and ask if they can "block" one next to you, to use your car seat in. Be nice as this is a big favor!     Actually, I've found that if you have an extra item, they're usually understanding at check-in as a general rule when they see you are flying with a small child or baby (or two or three as is my case). Just be nice and answer all questions. Don't hide anything or lie, but don't volunteer any information (i.e. "Can I bring this extra bag on board??") Even if they saw it, if a supervisor isn't around and didn't hear you ask something like that, you should be okay...    For more information, I wrote an article on this subject. It's based on both my personal and professional experience of flying with children. I go more into detail on all related topics, as well as the question of transporting the car seat through the airport. It's totally non-commercial and other parents have contributed;  http://flyingwithchildren.blogspot.com    An edited version appeared on the Expat Women website last month;  http://www.expatwomen.com/mothers/flying...     Have a good flight!|`|PA0bGBtCaa	Airlines are really strict about what is a carry-on and how many to take. They will still restrict you to one carry on item (ie, a diaper bag) and your personal item (purse). Your carry-on bag can be gate checked along with the stroller.    However, when there's a rule, there is a way around it, and I like to tell people how to get around them. Just put your purse in your diaper bag and boom, you have two carry-on items. No airline agent in their right mind will make you gate check a diaper bag!|`|818a6c4a96262d3d9669cd5c91b5efaeaa	Only "ticketed" passengers may have luggage...in other words.. you do not get to have another carry-on for the child.
3LmXfFoBaa	Well you've been given everything but one thing that is only in Canada. You from that list by the first answerer can only do the Maid of the Mist on the New York side. We do have few but never the less other things. You can do Cave of the Winds, which is almost like Journey Behind the Falls on our counterpart's side where you go in a elevator except here you go right up to the falls literally touching them. You can also take a walk by the state park and the view the falls in a unique way. You can also visit the Seneca Niagara Casino & Hotel. It is a marvelous casino and wonderful hotel and dining NOT TO BE MISSED! But you can probably only spend a day on the American side if you can do visit the Canadian side as well where you could easily spend a week and be able to fill every day with the Birds of the Wild Kingdom to Niagara-on-the-lake to Clifton Hill on the Canadian side I can't deny that theres more.|`|HPRlEWu1aa	theres alotta places right near the park ... u got alot to choose from .. canada side s way better tho .. u should consider spending the night there

It's the EveryReady Bunny of holidays, by which I mean that it's still going on, even though Giao Thua, the New Years Eve, was 4 nights ago.  Here, tomorrow morning will be Friday, and the banks, government offices, etc., will still be closed (go figure; a country where the banks close a week for New Years!).  So, my answer is that Tet is still great!  If you don't mind being schlepped around town endlessly, only to go home for a well deserved rest to have family and friends-surprise!-popping in.  Naw, but it's nice.|`|edxSjBDwaa	To regard Tet simply as New Year, as one would in the West, would display a poor knowledge of the people of Vietnam.<br>  <br>  In spite of its impressive credentials, the Gregorian New Year has not been generally accepted in Vietnam, in the countryside in particular. Our people pay it a courteous homage but reserve their heart and soul for the traditional Tet.<br>  <br>  Tet falls sometime between the last ten days of January and the middle part of February.<br>  <br>  For a nation of farmers attached to the land for millennia, it has always been a festival marking the communion of man with nature. In the flow of seasons it is a pause during which both the field and the tiller enjoy some rest after twelve months of labor. In this period of universal renewal the Vietnamese man feels surging within himself a fountain of youth. That feeling explains many fine customs: in the New Year all action should be pure and beautiful for it may be an omen foretelling events in the twelve months that follow.<br>  <br>  For three days, one takes extra care not to show anger and not to be rude to people. The most nagging mother-in-law will make peace with her daughter-in-law; a quarreling couple will smile pleasantly at each other; the new world should be the best of worlds. When the holiday ends, people will resume their activities in a new spirit following so-called opening rituals in which the ploughman will open the first furrow, the official applies his seal to the first document, the scholar trace the first character with his pen brush, the trader receives his first customer.<br>  <br>  As a rule, all members of the extended family try to spend the holiday (the idiom used is to “eat Tet”) together under the same roof. Children vow to be well-behaved and are often given gifts of cash wrapped in red paper. Several times a day, joss-sticks are lit on the family altar and offerings made of food, fresh water, flowers and betel. Family graves are visited, generally, before the end of the ‘outgoing’ year; fences are mended and the burial mounds tidied up.<br>  <br>  The Vietnamese Tet is an occasion for an entire people to share a common ideal of peace, concord and mutual love. I know of no communal celebration with more humanistic character.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pacifichotel.com.vn/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pacifichotel.com.vn/</a>|`|Upfxe3psaa	It was ok.

AA11326712	Mosquitoes and horse flies need no provocation to attack.  Chamaeleons and lizards and geckos will not attack.|`|4JkdxfjJaa	Well. A hungry or angry lion or leopard would attack you. A Cape buffalo or bull elephants (especially in must')are known to attack with little to no reason. A Nile crocodile would, because they will kill anything in their striking range. These are the animals that will attack you no matter what. But there are many more dangerous animals in Africa, so always go with  qualified professionals to take you out in the bush.|`|t1zWa5vHaa	Haha, I agree with the others above me... Mosquitos!    Other than that... I guess it depends on how drunk you are?|`|baYEevRfaa	A mosquito.|`|3Rpwwuglaa	Mosquitoes.  Theres no escaping the bloodsucking monsters!!    Seriously:    No animal,wild or otherwise, would attack a human without provocation. If it seems like thats not the case, look a little closer, the person may have made eye contact, bared their teeth, was wearing strong perfume; anything that the animal doesnt like and reacted in the only way it knows.    Snakes will leave you alone; spiders will run away at your approach, they will only 'attack' when they need to defend themselves. They wont attack cos theyre wild, theyll attack cos they are threatened.    That being said, one needs to display caution, instead of wild paranoia, when being in the bush. eg, in the middle of a drought, dont leave your vehicle to have a closer look at the pride of lions. They will pply be very hungry...in fact dont tempt fate, NEVER leave your vehicle.  DO NOT FEED WILD ANIMALS. This causes the animal to associate humans with food, preventing them from hunting for themselves as well as losing the natural fear they have for humans. You might have heard horror stories regarding hyenas or australian dingos, but i can bet you, in those cases, they had become accustomed to humans, and were looking for food in what they think is THEIR territory.    When in the bush, always remember that you are in their world and play by their rules.  ;) and dont be such a wuss its not that bad!! lol  :P  and i wasnt joking about the mozzies...|`|G1hQZuaiaa	Mosquitoes, you are about 1,000,000 time more likely to die from malaria than from any other animal inflicted wound.|`|1AHxTBDUaa	Absolutely agree with the others.

She got so hysterical and copped such an attitude that she was formally removed by security. She never made it past the metal detectors because she got irate. Meanwhile, I had a 3.4 oz perfume of my own in my bag (at a time when the rule was very new and I hadn't heard of it yet) and was allowed to board. Maybe some manners would have saved her the embarrassment and expense of a plane ticket.    This one wasn't on my flight but it's still pretty relevant: My parents flew to Ireland on the same plane as an elderly man who got progressively more demented as the flight wore on. He was supposedly ranting about terrorists (this was in the summer of 2002) and some Italian kid who apparently looked Arab to him. They couldn't land the plane in the ocean or turn around, so when they landed apparently there were an ambulance and police escorts waiting. My dad was a doctor and tried to offer his help, but without knowing the old guy's medical history it would have been way too risky to administer any of the limited supply of drugs kept on board the plane. He was given oxygen but that really didn't do much for the poor old guy. Unfortunately, his little episode was at a time when the 9/11 fear was still very potent and airlines weren't taking ANY risks. According to my dad, his 90-year-old wife was "randomly selected" for a security search before boarding.
AA10049824	The Union Square area has a wide range of restaurants.     For good value (but decent quality) meat dishes, head for one of the French bistros. Cafe Claude and Cafe De La Presse are nice local hangouts.    http://www.cafeclaude.com/    http://www.aqua-sf.com/cdlp/    Although you can find better Japanese restaurants in other parts of San Franicsco, these two are close to Union Square and have a decent reputation.    http://www.hanazenrestaurant.com/welcome...    http://www.sanraku.com/sanraku.html|`|910537da330152ad69b869eeff90d14eaa	hmmm- you DID say you want sushi in the Union Square neighborhood, right?  I'm just wondering why the other answer has all these out-of-town, non-sushi places???    There's a little sushi boat place not far from Union Square - corner of Geary and Mason near the art galleries.  The sushi is good- and prices are in line with the average.  They do KILLER rolls there- very large.      Another option would be the huge Hana Zen sushi place on ellis and Cyril Magnin.  More suited for a romantic date- but then again so is the little underground place I mentioned before.    No real need to make reservations- it'll be busy, but I'm sure you could score a cozy booth with no problems.  I would recommend that you head over to the Ferry Building afterwards though- the little walk along the waterfront can be very very very romantic.  Stop by the Slanted Door restaurant for a dink and maybe some snacks- very cool place.    good luck!|`|5q3y4mj6aa	$$$???  Sushi places all over here.  Not sure which is the best.  Chinese?  R & G lounge on Kearney.  Italian?  Rose Pistola. General cuisine -  Incanto.  Canteen.  Michael Mina's(very VERY pricey).  Cafe Mums is a lot of fun.  All you can eat shabu shabu, and if you add 15 dollars, all you can drink asahi and sake.  I would suggest Ad Hoc in yountville, which is in napa.|`|8Hxyp9fRaa	I don't know any Japanese cuisines, but I know a nice diner suitable for families and/or friends. Lori's Diner. There are a few of them through out SF, but there is one specific one on Powell st., downtown by Union Square. It's open usually for Dinner, BUT on Sundays it's open from 7am to 10pm, and they have steak and burgers and fries, all that good stuff. It's real 50's style, there's a Cadillac style car at the end of the diner, a plane on the ceiling, cool counter, red seats, and red leather booths, and a Juke Box. It sends off a real home-y type feeling, and is by Union Square in SF. Try it out.|`|8idhxYHaaa	A great place is Frascati. It doesnt have sushi though. you should really try the chicken there. its the best chicken ive ever tasted. also in union square, the restuarant at the top of neiman marcus is amazing.
3K1QW7Oeaa	Congrats on actually saving up! THANK YOU SO MUCH for doing your research!! It gets SO ANNOYING when somebody can't find $500/mo. in L.A. and expects us to find such a place.    If you don't need to go to Los Angeles, then I would honestly suggest to look elsewhere. I'm not trying to be mean or nothing, but I'm just saying with the way the economy is going, you can do better and there's no need to waste a precious $10,000 on something you might get upset about (I'm just saying by the way. Just in case you want that $10,000 to go further, I'm just suggesting.)    As of right now, because of the economy, a job opening in Los Angeles is almost non existent. With the closings of Shoe Pavilion, Linens-N-Things, Mervyns, and Circuit City (soon to be), it's going to be EVEN MORE difficult.|`|PFGo7nFXaa	Well buddy, Los Angeles IS a good place but everything is expensive nowadays gas price went a little down from almost 4 bucks to 2.05 in some places, also rent for houses and apartments are a lot ide say save up much more money just incase anything goes wrong and you dont find a job for a while|`|SDzPeqSLaa	$10,000 is a great start, wow! i'm proud of you, however,  the cost of living in LA is very high and you have to factor in things like food, transportation, utilities etc.  Have you thought about getting a room mate?  You could go on craigslist and find hundreds of postings with people looking for room mates.  I know that my not sound ideal, but if you're going to a new city it may be the best thing, you can find someplace cheaper than 800 or 1000 a month, and maybe they can show you around and maybe even help in your job search.  If you can save more, then of course do, but I think you'll be fine with that for 6 months, good luck!

mmWeBRRtaa	Sorry to hear about your situation.  Berkeley provides more social programs than a lot of cities.  One I just found on the web is called the "Youth Emergency Assistance Hostel":  http://yeah-berkeley.org/index.php    They're located at 1744 University Ave. (between Grant and McGee, about four-and-a-half blocks west of UC Berkeley).    They can probably give you a temporary place to stay.  I don't know what you should do after your money runs out, but there might be people there who can help you and give you suggestions.  Good luck.
f610fce787e6299e681ff222a3173ed5aa	I assume you mean Auckland you're flying into?  If so the public transport is bad to be able to do much.  There is Butterfly Creek near the airport which is a butterfly house & that's about all I can think of.    Unfortunately the area around the airport is a rough neighbourhood so it's not like you can do much around there on foot or anything.      I guess you could have time to make it to downtown Auckland to go up the Sky tower & do a few other things, but that's about it.  You'd need to organise transport to get back to the airport on time though (there is an airport bus buy really you need to allow 2 hours for that!  It doesn't stick to a timetable so is unpredictable).  Also as far as I'm aware you aren't allowed to leave your luggage at the airport for security reasons so that would be a problem too, re how to get around during that 7 - 8 hours with all your luggage.    I had the same thing when I had time to kill in LA, I knew it was tricky with no car in LA so didn't bother even attempting to leave the airport by public transport to have a look downtown or anything.    I guess you could arrange to hire a car for the day & put your luggage in that while you look around?  That would be your best bet.  But make sure you drive on the correct side of the road (the opposite to the USA) & you'll need to organise the drivers licence situation before you arrive.|`|s2IOyj8iaa	Auckland airport is 21 kilometres from the city so not a lot of time to get into town .

Most of your time could be in airport and customs.     The zoo in Auckland is good , has quite a few NZ animals, although mostly foreign ones. You could head to the Auckland CBD and (pre)book a tour. Sadly there just isn't the time to see the beautiful scenery New Zealand has to offer (most of it away from Auckland, but the Waitakere ranges to the west of Auckland could be seen quickly in the time period (again sadly much of your time will be spent getting there, and you may need to rent a car as no public transport to the best of my knowledge there) which will give you a glimpse of the scenery New Zealand elsewhere has to offer. A little internet research might turn up a tour for you.    New Zealand has an awful lot to offer, but 7-8 hours is just too short. Make sure you come back for longer (at leat several days)

rvTcDJ6yaa	From memory ( its been over 10years since I did it)  its pretty easy walk, but I remember a bridge ( that only 1 or 2 people can cross at a time and its narrow and there are a couple of steps along the track in a couple fo places.....this might make a couple of parts a bit tricky. I think its around 20mins walk one way  ( but you can go all the way around it too. now I have checked out the DoC ( department of conservation) website which tells me more. I have put the link below which will help you out.  You can also contact a DoC information centre, which will be able to help ..just e-mail either the Haast or Franz Josef one.

Some famous labor leaders, anarchists, and socialists were refused burial in Chicago but were welcomed in Forest Park.  More than 150,000 others have found their final resting plots there also.    Forest Home is the cemetery you're inquiring about.  It's adjacent to I-290 to the south and north of Roosevelt Rd.  The entrance is on Des Plaines Ave to the east and the Des Plaines River is to the west.    German Waldheim Cemetery is also a huge.  It accepted Jews when others did not.  The Jewish section is in a western area.  Waldheim is famous for its section where circus performers and animals are buried that were killed in a train wreck in 1918 near Gary, IN.       http://www.franzosenbuschheritageproject...      To answer your question...Yes.  Forest Home has plots...so does Waldheim.

9yuLiTE6aa	It is possible to go on the "cheap" so to speak but it will never be but so cheap.  From where are you traveling?  You will need a visa to visit from most countries.  That is around $140.00 to have it done by an agency.  The only other option is to go to a Russian Embassy and do it yourself.  Air fairs have come down with the weak economy and lower oil prices.  Again the cost will depend on where you travel to a nd from and the time of year.  Where to stay?  Moscow hotels are very expensive.  So are the taxis.  Smaller cities away from Moscow are more affordable but you have to get there.  Train travel is not too expensive but the taxi from the airport to a train station is $75.00 each way.  If you like it is possible to rent an apartment in many cities and usually this is less expensive than a hotel.  Do you know anyone there?  That can also save.  If you bring cash make sure it is in crisp new $100.00 bills for easy exchange.  There are many places to exchange currency in Russia including at the airport.  But, exchange left over rubles before you leave.  I doubt will ever find any place to change rubles once you leave Russia.  The people there are good and friendly but reserved.  Are there bad people there?  Yes, like in all countries.  This is where it helps to have a friend there or stay on the "main" path.  Do not go to Russia without a basic understanding of the language!  Most people you meet will be friendly and helpful but not all.  With planning and a sense of adventur you can have a good time without breaking the bank.  But, be forewarned.  Eventhough most Russians are not wealthy or middle class Russia is an expensive country to be in.  Many things will cost as much or more as in the states or western europe.  Don't go thinking you will find bargains like in 3rd world countries, you won't.  But you can certainly have an interesting adventure.|`|oeqVIA6raa	Not really sure you can do anything cheap today when it comes to boarding a plane.

CuYQ57mjaa	Maybe Datu was right.      During the Precambrian era when the earth formed 4.6 billion years ago, all life was in water.  Early single celled bacteria and achaea appeared and followed by multi-celled organisms including animals.   200 million years ago, when dinosaurs roamed the earth, all the land was connected in one giant supercontinent.  This is "Pangaea" which was surrounded by a single enormous ocean.  Literally Asia, North America, South America, Africa,  India, Australia and Antartica were interconnected.  As human civilization started to evolve and develop 10,000 years ago, these beings migrated by foot in just one big continent.  It was all to prove that we all came from one human specie.    I don't have to explain why we have 7 separate continents at present.  It's up to you to research about the "continental drifting".|`|fzm74wVcaa	Various origins have been assigned to the Indian racefrom Europe and the East, by way of Greenland or the mythic land of Atlantis; from Asia, by way of the Bering Straits and the Polynesian Islands, has more advocates, and also more reasons in its favour. The fact that Japanese and other Asiatic adventurers have frequently landed upon the North Pacific coast of America is a matter of history, and tribal tradition and other evidence indicate that such contact was as frequent in prehistoric times, but whether all this has been sufficient to make permanent impression upon the physique and culture, let alone to account for a race, is an open question.

wuECza8faa	Not to bad of a place to visit. Not bad to live for a while, but it gets old. The weather varies, depending what part of Oregon you are in. Lots of Pine trees. Portland is a cool town to visit. Some areas, you may feel safe enough to walk during the night. But it's not recommended. There are a lot of things to do there, you'll have to pick up a paper and look threw the events section...To see what's going on in town. It does rain a lot there, but not nearly as bad as Seattle, Washington. The Oregon coast beaches are rocky for the most part. But there are sandy parts of the beaches. The weather on the coast can get pretty cold too. Summer time is the best time to visit there.    Northeast Oregon, where I'm from... La Grande to be exact, was a great place when I went to middle school and high school there. Even if there wasn't much to do as a kid. We made our own fun. Rode bikes all over town, played football in the back yard.... The Winter season there is cold. The summer season is really warm to pretty hot. Spring and Fall are in between. Though it rains a lot during the Fall.|`|mKDSnQO5aa	Very green, very libral, not always rainy thought. In the summer its HOT and winter is rainy but typically not below 45 during the day. Its a very pretty place and no sales tax! :)|`|ScZPVCUpaa	I moved to Oregon from Calif.  Main difference is how low key people are... clothes are casual & wealth is not on display as much.   Southern Oregon doesn't have as much rain as the Portland area, but be prepared for any kind of weather.  It can snow in May, rain on the 4th of July, or warm and balmy in Feb.  Bring lots of layers, and don't worry, you don't have to dress to impress here.|`|fQgbBx7caa	rain, rain, rain, maybe a sunny day, rain, rain,...you cannot plan a day around the weather.|`|OI29tkSoaa	That Depends what part of Oregon It is a Very nice Green State lots of pine trees it rains alot in some places Right now it is cold But it is a good place.|`|b87482cd8013bcfad52b6cff60829a6eaa	Oregon is a great place with varied weather. The typical thing people think is the rain..that's the coastal weather. There are mountains, beaches, plains, rivers, and even desert weather. Its more of a country type place..I mean like farm/ranching life is big there in many small areas. Its a great place and honestly I miss it tremendously.

6N4Xam6Haa	Yes the website referred below has search-booking engines from British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, CheapOair, Vayama and Airfare.com to find the cheapest fare from ORD to any other airport for a given date. In Airfare.com search engine, you can search +/- 1 day. Fares vary with departure days / dates.  For example click on the Virgin Atlantic banner. They have a special offer from ORD to London for $ 269 for travel Mar 23 2009 - May 24 2009.  Second example. Search for a return ticket ORD - PRG in the Airfare.com (+/- 1 day) search engine for journeys departing 1st & 9th May 2009 shows that the cheapest fare is offered by United Airlines for $ 506 ($ 867 incl. taxes & fees). CheapOair & Vayama search engines are also very good. You can browse, compare and book online.|`|N7G26k4Iaa	Based on experience, all the websites do about the same.  To be honest, it always depends on where exactly you want to go to and when you want to fly.  Leaving on a Tuesday is much cheaper than flying on Friday evening.  Also, flying out of Chicago will make it more expensive than leaving from NY and it also depends on how many connections you are willing to make.

Otherwise if you want to get out of town, you could take them to Ballarat (the old-fashioned part) and Daylesford (gorgeous little town with great coffee shops and bookstores).

Yt21SkIeaa	Here are your options...    1. Are you a resident of Canada or Washington State? If so you can purchase a Whistler a Whistler Blackcomb Edge Card. They come preloaded with either 1 day or 5 days worth lift tickets. You will end up saving about $20 per day.    2. Stop by a 7-Eleven store in Vancouver or Squamish. They sell Whistler lift tickets for about $10 less than what you will pay at the ticket window. There is a 7-Eleven in Whistler, but for obvious reasons they don't sell the discounted lift tickets.    3. If you are booking accommodations in Whistler, you can purchase multi-day lift tickets at the same time. The discount varies depending on the time of year you go.    You will find more detail at the link below including which tickets get you on to the new Peak 2 Peak gondola.    Have fun.|`|gERaZGZeaa	Go to 7-11.

mLWs1XaCaa	I'm guessing that would be more than enough. Of course if you are clubbing and in the Apgujeong or Chungdam areas that could be half gone in a two nights out. Seriously a bottle and table at some places can really set you back and if you want a room well then we are talking major.    If you are just hanging out and not hitting the department stores too much then that should be more than enough.    Want a cheap hotel in Korea, well how about a guest house in a great location.

Important tips:  always have with you your own toilet paper and be open minded because 90% of Korea will not be what they show you in the Kdramas.|`|AVYaugeoaa	Places to hang out and see in Seoul. Itaewon(lots of places to eat, some deent places to drink), Apgujeong(expensive, but good shopping, lots of bars and clubs and beautiful people), Gangnam(lots of bars and clubs and beautiful people), Hongdae(the indie rock scene is popular here. lots of great bars/clubs, cheap shopping, decent eating, saturday/sunday art fairs in the park, insadong( traditional korean culture, tea houses, art galleries).    hope this helps.

rljol7sjaa	Any CR beachfront/commercial real estate is a hot item and the Nicoya Peninsula is desirable place and with that said, more expensive.     However, other places like Drakes Bay, Dominical, and Pochotal on the Central Pacific are very nice and have not been exploited in price.     My advise is to select several areas you like and spend some time in these areas to get to know the people, area and the market. One of your best bets is look into the local newspapers which cater to the local prices. Word of Mouth and local postings, is still the best.     A list of newspapers is below and they have online local listings that change weekly:    http://www.ticotimes.com/costa-rica-news...    Newspapers like AM CR have local real estate:  http://www.amcostarica.com/realestate.ht...    Keep in mind CR is like the US with a slump in the real estate market, many owners are lowering their prices. So like everything else, do your research.    This link caters to the "sale by owner" and has a LOT of commercial listing on just about everything, including hotels, B&Bs etc. It will give you a general idea of what the market is:    http://www.encuentra24.com/clasificados-...    This link caters to some of the regional agents/brokers  http://www.ticotimes.com/costa-rica-real...    This link caters to exclusive properties including a fishing lodge:  http://www.realestatecostarica.com    Before even thinking about buying, get a good attorney/real estate agent to do the due diligences on any property. CR is known for it scams artists so take your time, research the property and if you find a realtor you like, make sure they send you references and you can get a credit check on them usually at the local bank. With that said, you will be good to go.|`|xAYpUcyUaa	Hello,    My name is Ricardo Cazorla and I work for a relocation company here in Costa Rica.

pI5jKfmaaa	The Pachmarhi hotels are designed to entertain the needs and requirements of both the business and pleasure travelers who have come here after traversing long distances. All the hotels compete well with each other in order to serve guests with the best facilities. However the very common and characterizing feature of all the hotels in Pachmarhi remains to be their convenient location and world class accommodations. The rooms of almost every hotel are painstakingly appointed with elegant furnishings and plethora of modern amenities. Some of the invariably found facilities of the rooms are usually television, telephone, attached baths and running hot & cold water. The provision of these facilities in the rooms proves the attentiveness of the hotels towards the needs of the guests. You will surely second this opinion.    Like most of the hotels in Madhya Pradesh, the accommodations in Pachmarhi come with excellent dining facilities. Most of the hotels have their own on-site restaurants that serve tastefully prepared Indian, Chinese and Continental dishfuls. This truly is one of the finest arrangements for the food connoisseurs and for those who look for different taste in commonly found food items.

fShlKEfYaa	Charleston Place Hotel is one of the nicest hotels around and I would definately go back to enjoy the marble bath and their wonderful southern hospitality. It is in a convenient area. The local Architectural Walking tour is interesting if you enjoy walking and history.  Other locations that are nice are:  Planters Inn  John Rutledge Inn  Boardwalk Inn  French Quarter Inn  Beaches: - Folly Beach and Isle of Palms are nearby. Sullivan's Island has a three-mile-long beach and lighthouse and is north of Charleston. Fort Moultrie beach.  Anson's Restaurant is a good choice for their signature dishes and desserts.

Although, if you want to do type editing you might encounter some trouble if you're not very familiar with html codes...    another one I used for a short while was blogspot.com and that one's probably easier. editing posts is really easy and so is editing the look of your page.    if any of your friends blog on a certain site, you could create an account there and your friend(s) using it can help you start it up and such|`|Wm0mBDn1aa	I would prefer you to go for travel community blogs.Because you can find other travel blogs as well.

I don't wanna say bad words to our NBI coz i know they're doing their best to fight crimes and all but they're somewhat different from the FBI's.

o5BoIHGzaa	The word Pacific comes from the Latin name Mare Pacificum, which means "peaceful sea", it was named by the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan.|`|AA11828341	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Oce...    mportant human migrations occurred in the Pacific in prehistoric times, most notably those of the Polynesians from the Asian edge of the ocean to Tahiti and then to Hawaii, New Zealand, and Easter Island.    The ocean was first sighted by Europeans early in the 16th century, first by the Spanish explorer Vasco N?ez de Balboa who crossed the Isthmus of Panama in 1513, and then by Ferdinand Magellan, who sailed the Pacific during his circumnavigation from 1519 to 1522. In 1564, conquistadors crossed the ocean from Mexico  Bathyscaphe Trieste, before her record dive to the bottom of the Mariana Trench, 23 January 1960.led by Miguel Lpez de Legazpi who sailed to the Philippines and Mariana Islands. For the remainder of the 16th century, Spanish influence was paramount, with ships sailing from Spain to the Philippines, New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands.    During the 17th century, the Dutch, sailing around southern Africa, dominated discovery and trade; Abel Janszoon Tasman discovered Tasmania and New Zealand in 1642. The 18th century marked a burst of exploration by the Russians in Alaska and the Aleutian Islands, the French in Polynesia, and the British in the three voyages of James Cook to the South Pacific and Australia, Hawaii, and the North American Pacific Northwest.    Growing imperialism during the 19th century resulted in the occupation of much of Oceania by European powers, and later, the United States and Japan. Significant contributions to oceanographic knowledge were made by the voyages of HMS Beagle in the 1830s, with Charles Darwin aboard; HMS Challenger during the 1870s; the USS Tuscarora (1873-76); and the German Gazelle (1874-76). Although the United States gained control of the Philippines from Spain in 1898, Japan controlled most of the western Pacific by 1914 and occupied many other islands during World War II. However, by the end of that war, Japan was defeated and the U.S. Pacific Fleet was the virtual master of the ocean. Since the end of World War II, many former colonies in the Pacific have become independent states.    The exploitation of the Pacific's mineral wealth is hampered by the ocean's great depths. In shallow waters of the continental shelves off the coasts of Australia and New Zealand, petroleum and natural gas are extracted, and pearls are harvested along the coasts of Australia, Japan, Papua New Guinea, Nicaragua, Panama, and the Philippines, although in sharply declining volume in some cases. The Pacific's greatest asset is its fish. The shoreline waters of the continents and the more temperate islands yield herring, salmon, sardines, snapper, swordfish, and tuna, as well as shellfish.|`|010c55146a7a1aa4e904234657093e98aa	The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. Its name is derived from the Latin name Mare Pacificum, "peaceful sea", bestowed upon it by the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan.|`|ihcDXzlqaa	Pacific means peaceful.

q1GnMRxxaa	If a cruise is anywhere near a holiday like Christmas, these get booked full early. But if your talking like the first part of December, then 90 days or less would be your best bet. In fact vacations to go has what they call a 90 day ticker for people just like you. But, the best rooms usually are gone and you would get what they call the leftovers.Payments in full or complete refunds happen by 75 days in advance. Once 75 days comes around, people back out and cabins do open up, so 75 days in advance would be your best bet. Always remember that you can book, like now with a small deposit and cancel right before that 75 day mark and get  a total refund. So you may want to do that too. I hope this helped. Since this is for your honeymoon, I would contact a travel agent now to get some advice too.|`|UQft205Waa	Hi Megan depends if the cruise is fully booked during summer it always is but if your going in the winter then you may be able to book a month or two before departure   I went during our spring /summer  in (Australia)  and it was windy on the deck but very nice so if its winter you would freeze on the deck....we had a great time food is great entertainment the whole deal!|`|cb1c8e5fcd8492bc3787fd1b614481ecaa	The earlier you book the lower the price and better room. Don't forget that all you need is a refundable deposit. The balance is due 60-90 days before the cruise (depending on the line).    ? ??l???q ?
BBOR7Vwmaa	I bought my Vodafone Nokia 6500 slide in a post office in Ocean Grove while on holidays this summer (I have a beach house there)    How weird, I was looking through Australia and found this    Anyway I love the phone, and I bought it for $199. It was advertised at $250 but the lady at the counter said it was on sale for $50 cheaper. I guess that solves it, but look around for a cheaper price and make sure you're buying it on Vodafone because I think they sell it cheaper?|`|Vtq2aTJAaa	Im not sure about that but a piece of advice before you do- my best friend has the slide, and i have the nokia 6500c, get the c because it does the same but is tonnes better- if you dont believe me look up some reviews :)|`|AA10037740	maybe the 199 was in euro and the 279 in USD? i dont know.. i have a slide vodafone and i payed 500euro for.. the next cheapest was the new 66..it was 250 euro|`|UKGlHMmBaa	cheap in bowral dick smith

They try to make people work for 3 or 4 day per week because otherwise they would lose their jobs.  I would rather stay in UK. I am sure you will get job easier here than there. You have too know that in Poland nearly every men can do plumber job, it's not like here. So I think they would rather employe polish people    And Poland is still empty because Polish people can't get no job in there. They are coming here and to other countries.|`|be8c12cdca22b46ac7dcd7d626901063aa	They need close churches and let priests find honest job .

jRtQTN24aa	Well let's see, there's Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania. Cities: Sydney and Brisbane (sp ?) . that I can think of.  There's the Out Back and the Great Barrier Reef.  Aussies are allies with the US.    I had an Uncle that lived there mining Opals from the mid 1950's until he passed away. Like to see it one day myself.  I'm from New Orleans, Louisiana, but have been living in New Mexico  for 20 years working ranches and doing construction.

H6HmHDPxaa	I would study at MIT because being an engineer has always been a dream of mine and plus MIT is the hardest university in the world to get into.

jOM4bBMPaa	The border towns are the most dangerous and the parts that you usually hear about on the news because of the gang wars over drug trafficking from Mexico to the US.  If you avoid the border towns, it can be as safe of a place as the US or Europe.  There are always going to be dangerous parts of large cities, but if you take the normal precautions you usually would do when visiting a large city you should be fine.|`|QdvyxE50aa	it is like everywhere in the world you will never know when you meet a crazy guy who will kill you hehe    but as a mexican i can tell that is very diferent depends of where do you live and the people that you hang out with.    The best place i can say is in the country side , get away of the big cyties .    You can find nice and calm down small towns and really beaitful    You also need a very good job to have a nice life .|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	Yes!|`|kuIT8OK9aa	Most of the country of Mexico is a safe place to visit and live:    Exceptions:    Border towns of Tiajuana and Cuidad Juarez (Walking is an extreme sport here).  State of Sinaloa, Culiacan - both drug cartels originated here, but the killings have been among the 2 warring cartels and the police.    All other areas are safe. i.e. It is niot as bad as the media make it out to be.|`|fB4RfiCgaa	I don't know about the best places, but some of the border towns sound scary-Juarez/Tijuana|`|aozlk1Alaa	Mexico is a Great Country to Visit and Live... The Bad parts of Mexico are all the Border Cities. What makes these cities bad and most people don't realize it is that the people making it bad are people from the united states and all there drug trafficking. But the best parts of Mexico are the southern states. So the farther south you travel the better it will get.  If it was not safe to come to Mexico than all the American cruises would not stop at any Mexican port.
mv0IKzEUaa	New Zealand in fact is one of the most arrogant and ignorant countries ever. I remember there was a rugby match between the All Blacks and Wallabies on New Zealand soil and when the Australian was preparing to kick the ball, all you could hear was obvious loud boos. Seriously! I just couldn't believe it.  Australians dont boo whenever Daniel Carter is about to kick!|`|f610fce787e6299e681ff222a3173ed5aa	Personally I hate sport so couldn't care less who wins.    I lived in Sydney for 3 years 10 years ago & I did find Sydneysiders & Queenslanders arrogant, but not people from Melbourne.    Just this week I came back from 3 months in Sydney (first time I've been back in 10 years) & I can't say I saw or met anyone that was arrogant so I'm glad that's changed.  I also received nothing but positive comments about being from NZ which is the exact opposite of what I got 10 years ago!!    True I think Australians are confident & NZers are more laid back & dislike tall poppies even more than Australians do.  Great that the arrogance seems to have gone & it now is just confidence.  I was a bit perplexed at the patriotism aspect of Oz though.  What's up with all this "that's just Un-Australian" stuff?  I don't even think an Australian could define the meaning of that for me!  Seemed like an excuse to be racist to non whites to me...... in particular to muslims.|`|W0ltl4ulaa	Hey that's alright mate we all know that you secretly want to be a Kiwi an back the Kiwis when we play Aussie. But Im sorry fact is your not, but you can have joy in the fact that your another great Australian that all of Aussie can be proud of.    Call it arrogant or confident if that helps you feel better about being an Australian,  but there not the words real Kiwis (not wannabe Kiwis) use to describe Aussie.|`|rvTcDJ6yaa	They are arrogant! Simple.|`|r0HYuHubaa	i think us kiwis say that because we secretly admire you guys and are just mad because we arent as arrogant/confident or as natural at being winners as ozzys...no diss on NZ|`|oizYBoKgaa	We dont all think of them that way.  Thats just stereotype.|`|9z5NASypaa	Coz New Zealanders and Aussies are so similar like brothers so we always just hassle them, they do the same to us. Fighting like brothers, its just joking.  Australia are our biggest rivals in sport, esp rugby cricket rugby league and netball and well almost everything. So we dont like to loose to them. What do Americans say abut Canadians when they loose to them in ice hockey? kinda the same.|`|dqPdoiSYaa	Nope. I am a Kiwi, but that doesnt mean that I too think that Aussies are arrogent people, whether in sports or in general. Maybe some people might think it this way, but not all. Australians are pretty good in almost every sport and even I support them everytime, unless when when they are playing against us.|`|qU1G6FmHaa	It's like the T Shirt says; I support New Zealand - and any other team playing the Aussies.|`|s67BloUxaa	thats why kiwis drink out of old tin cans and broken bottles............ australia has won all their cups.............. all bar the sheepshagging cup.|`|16KUkMP0aa	I don't actually know!! Hahah|`|4s3G0Qm6aa	I support Aussie. Im a New Zealander but I always support Australia rather than NZ.|`|TpdzxnyJaa	australian team is in news always with all kinda problems , they love to critise others,they dont like to be calm, u know, sydeny test incident,symonds issue  3times,warne,even gilchrist who did crticisam against tendulkar,no one has critisize tendulkar before,oz team not genuine as other teams, thats why world has decided to call aussies  arr.....................|`|S2aHg67yaa	I don't call aussies arrogant, but maybe thats just cause I find sport boring. It's as much of a generalization saying we call you arrogant as it is when someone does say that aussies are arrogant. I really don't think the population of an entire nation can ever be given a single lable, and I don't thik any of my friends care about sport much either.|`|LJooKnyGaa	They're both pretty confident, though the NZ Haka totally has the sense of power in it. I reckon its just the dedication and loyalty to the country that that makes the people to not admit defeat and make excuses.
0PVp8Okoaa	Never in my life have i referred OZ as arrogant when winning against NZ in a sporting event. I'm not sure, I think it might be the 'heat' and the competition between the two countries.Since we're neighbours and all..|`|uVpNVKkWaa	HEY I LIVE IN QLD !!!|`|fYMfU9qEaa	HAHAHA...    im from NZ but lived in aus for ages..anyway..    i think that when aussie loses they come up with excuses and bullsht as to why they lost but never admit that they played like crap. Then when they win they act as if NZ are arseholes and gloat about how good they played and dont make any effort to even acknowledge NZ lol....so i think its fair enough that NZ is right in calling them arrogant    also you know that NZ and Aus are friendly rivals so...meh...its all for fun i guess lol.
diaSqz8laa	wellm you women are actually great drivers. especially if you are American or European. It is us men here in Saudi that keep you from driving. We would cause you so much fitnah!

VxfyQZ2jaa	I haven't been to Mardi Gras World, but most of the tour appears to be "self-guided" - meaning you wander around on your own and can leave when you are ready to go.

bR5Dzulsaa	John o Groats's pretty isolated.    I probably live in the most isolated town in Britain. I live in Aberystwyth on the West coast of Wales. It's in the middle of nowhere! The nearest big town is Shrewsbury! In England! Swansea's two hours away, Bangor's and hour and a half away.    I think the most isolated village I've ever been to is Porthdinllaen. On the Llyn peninsular in North Wales, you have to park your car 2 miles away in a lonely car park, then you walk down to a long white beach. You have to walk for the 2 miles around the bay to Porthdinllaen. All that's there is a lifeboat station, about 5 houses and a very very good pub! Seriously, it's a very traditional pub. If the tide comes in far enough there's no escape.  I remember once I had to sleep in the pub. There was a storm on the sea and looking out the window was amazing! There were waves crashing against the pub's walls. It was one of the best nights of my life!    There are some isolated villages on the Gwyr peninsular near Swansea as well. The furthest one is only about 30 miles from Swansea, but it's two hours in the car because the roads are so bad. Villages like Port Eynon and Rhosilli are brilliant places, with some of the best beaches on Earth!|`|doLyOac0aa	The UK is England, Scotland, Wales & Northern Ireland,    Britain is England, Scotland & Wales,    If you mean England only, just say England,    Or are you one of those people that only calls England, the UK? ( the scots, welsh & northern irish wont like that )|`|3LPTLUczaa	I think there is an Island that is technically part of the UK out in the Atlantic. It has like 200 people and they get a shipment of supplies once a year, I can't remember what TV show I saw it on though!    To be fair, you didn't specify that initially and my answer fits the question that you actually asked perfectly. No point shouting because you dont even know what question you want answering.|`|x0flaLfUaa	I used to live in a place called Ravenscar, that was pretty isolated.|`|kFlMHSKIaa	Chirk in north wales is the most sociably isolated place to live - the people here are very unfriendly especially the neighbours.  It is a cultural desert and extremely boring.|`|b7BQV3XNaa	About 6 years ago, a friend of mine moved to a very small village in Yorkshire, North England, called Low Row. She had been on walking mini-breaks with her parents to that area for some time, she said it was really dull, but her parents fell in love with the place and they moved there. So a year after she'd moved, my parents and I went all the way up the country (we live in Kensington) to visit my friend in Low Row. It was awful! The place is tiny and I have no idea how it can be classed as a "village"- it's in the middle of nowhere.     Photographs here: http://www.francisfrith.com/search/engla...

Z6tqdAoGaa	You actually collect the e-ticket from the KLM e- ticket self service machine at the airport.All you need to do is to take your confirmation which you have.On the confirmation you will find a booking reference which you simply type into the self service machine,and out comes the e-ticket.Any problems you just go to the KLM ticket desk with the confirmation.|`|GHTDunLMaa	How did you pay for your ticket', by bank transfer or credit/debit card? For bank transfer it is not unusual to wait couple of days.|`|9wtpCNb6aa	Hmm not normally.  I almost always book through KLM and after getting the first confirmation, the one which says thank you we will now process Your payment blah blah blah, the second one usually comes within 24 hours.      Bear in mind that you wont get an actual ticket emailed to you, this is electronically attached to your passport.  If you have had a second email which says your transaction is complete, or thank you for booking with us or something like that, then its probably ok.    On the website, there will be a part which says 'my account' or something similar, go in there and check for your bookings, if its there and says confirmed, then you are probably ok.    If they have taken payment from you, then chances are its all fine.  You wont recieve an actual ticket to print out or anything, just a full itinery to print off and booking reference.    Otherwise if you are not sure, call them on 0871 222 7740 or give them an email.
jOM4bBMPaa	I've been to Italy twice for vacations the last 3 years and I make my train reservations for a departing as soon as I arrive in a city.  That gives you a few days in advance.  First time I was in Italy was in May & we didn't have any problems except getting a ticket for an overnight boat ride from Naples to Sicily.  We got the tickets about 4 hours before departure & there were no more cabins left so we were stuck in chairs all night.  The second time I was in Italy was in late June, & the trains were a bit busier then.  We almost couldn't get tickets to get from Paris to Rome, & when we did the 4 of us were split into 2 different sleeper cabins.  So for day trips you'll be fine, if you're doing any overnight travel make reservations ahead of time!|`|8ivnzNi5aa	If it's anything like Germany, just show up at the train station, unless you want a sleeping car.  Then, you'll need reservations.  They should have several trains a day to most of your proposed destinations.  Enjoy the trip!|`|HEf129Hvaa	Hi.  Well, these are large and famous cities in Italy so that means there will be several trains per day arriving and departing from these cities.  For reservations, it really depends on what time of year you are travelling, and what type of train you want to travel with.  For example, the faster trains such as Eurostar should be booked in advance.  For the regular trains, you don't need to make a reservation but remember they are very slow...and they stop in every small town.
mtmgMDMsaa	Maoris you'll see everywhere.. they just live like any other NZer.. and pretty much just like you. They live in citys, towns like us.. Not in the forest. There are around 565,329 Moris here which is 14.6% of the population. (http://www.stats.govt.nz/census/census-o...  They have some different traditions, history and culture but it's not used as much as it used to be.  If you really want a proper Maori experience of there culture you can take tours so and they'll put on a welcome for you into there marai, perform, and make a hungi (a tradional maori way of preparing food, which is in the ground) etc. Rotorua is a good place to experience that but they're all around NZ.  And yes, there is alot of mixes, but there are still pure maoris around.    You should really read up on maoris:  http://www.virtualoceania.net/newzealand...  http://www.geocities.com/TheTropics/Shor...  http://www.fourcorners.co.nz/new-zealand...

You go to some towns in the North Island and they are the majority of people living there....in the South Island they are not as populus.   There is maori land, and its not marked per se, but you daon't walk on it. Maori have maraes, which are meeting houses but don't have reserves etc. Otherwise they are a part of normal NZ|`|r0HYuHubaa	Dont bother looking for Maoris...theres not much to see - its not like they are a great race who have contributed to society in a good way..|`|oizYBoKgaa	First of all they are Maoris not Moaries but good try.    They are treated like every other person and they all live in houses in normal society. No bush huts, mud huts, villages in forests etc.    I would say there are more in the north Island than south.     Auckland has alot of Maori but also Islanders like Tongans, Samoans etc.    South Auckland would be your best bit. But its a bit dodgy.|`|16KUkMP0aa	No they're not rare at all lol. They live anywhere in NZ. Most Maori arent dressed in cultural clothes anymore.|`|QMsLWrSpaa	lol you really don't know NZ do ya?  First of all it is spelt as 'Maori' and they aint rare.

There are no full Maori  alive.|`|qU1G6FmHaa	A Maori (not moari - that's a preEuropean swing over a pool of a river) is legally defined as anyone who thinks they think like a Maori.  Many pakeha may therefore be included in official figures for the Maori population.  Quite a few "Maori" may have only 1 sixtyfourth Maori ancestry, but if they wish, they can still count as Maori.|`|4s3G0Qm6aa	Maori's. Well you will see them everywhere. They aren't like native bush people they are just regular people.

You will find NZ completely innocent compared to South Africa, I live on the North Shore so have worked alongside alot of Sth Africans.  One thing I will say though is that in order to fit in you will need to become laid back like NZers as we find South Africans very aggressive & in the business world I have found SA's downright threatening (standover tactics, etc) & we don't operate that way here.  Also NZ is not sexist so it's a bit of an eye opener to be discussing business with a SA guy at work & he says something like "you look pretty"!!!!  That doesn't go down well here!  I found it really insulting & irrelevant (& inappropriate as it's always the married men that carry on like that - do all SA men cheat on their wives or something?!  That's the impression I've formed!).    The only place that most Aucklanders try to avoid is South Auckland, although it's nothing compared to SA re crime, etc.  West Auckland has I guess what you'd call, dare I say it, "white trash" type people.  Although alot of wealthy celebrities are moving to the outer West Auckland area these days to buy up the lifestyle blocks near the great Waitakere Ranges park & great surf beaches out there.    Central Auckland is good & any Eastern suburbs area, but inner East is millionaire territory (Mission Bay, St Heliers, Remuera).|`|Qq2MKeXUaa	If you choose Auckland then live on the North Shore, there are plenty of your fellow countrymen living there as well.

4fdeb5e83b0e4e59d0ce45d49190dc78aa	We do not call our underground rail system the subway - this is an American term.  We call it the "Underground" or the "tube".    When you arrive at Victoria Station, follow the signs for London Underground.  Buy your ticket before you go downstairs or make sure you have an oyster card.  Follow the signs for the Circle / District Lines - yellow and green.    Travel to Embankment.  When you exit the station, use the exit to the left and walk up Villiers Street.  You will find yourself on the Strand.  To the left of the Strand is Trafalgar Square.  When you walk directly straight ahead from Trafalgar Square (Towards the National Gallery) you will come to Leicester Square.  Directly behind Leicester Square is Chinatown.  Chinatown in London is only 2 streets so it's not exactly a town - more of a very small village lol.     Since It's so small they have moved the Chinese New Year Celebrations to Shaftesbury Avenue.  This is just further up from Leicester Square and Chinatown (mainly Gerrard Street). Follow Wardour Street if you're not sure.    You should arm yourself with an A-Z if you do not know London at all and then you can't get lost.    http://www.streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?x=529...|`|OHfZFR31aa	Trafalgar Square, Leicester Square, Chinatown and Shaftesbury Avenue are all within a 5 minute walk of each other.|`|jtoxFsdYaa	You can get all the travel advise for london that you will need from the Transport for London website http://www.tfl.gov.uk.

yKIr3C40aa	The short answer is no.    The slightly longer answer is, Japan is in a terrible recession right now, like the USA. There aren't enough jobs for Japanese people, let alone for people who come from other countries. The entertainment industry is shrinking, not growing.    The long answer is, there's no program for that sort of thing. You would have to do it on your own, and you would have to fight against many very difficult obstacles.     For example, Japan has a closed immigration policy, so just to live in Japan, you would need to either get a work visa (which requires a 4-year university degree or substantial work experience, and a sponsoring company) or you'd need to marry a Japanese citizen.    There are maybe 3 or 4 Americans working regularly as actors in TV and movies in Japan. Out of a country of about 120 million, that's not very many. It's not impossible, but it's very unlikely, and expect a lot of resistance if you go down this path. Unless you're very talented or exceptional, you're going to have to work very hard and convince a lot of people to get someone to help you.|`|4dfbcf738541ddcd8d3291d2dbbb44deaa	Sorry, not possible. You need a four year degree to work in Japan. And a solid job offer to get a work visa. Most Americans there teach English. It's not the dream job it once was. Other jobs are almost impossible to get,unless you have a special skill a Japanese doesn't have. To be an actor you would need to know how to speak, read and write Japanese at a native level. There isn't much demand for non-Japanese actors. As I've said before,Japan's economy is not good at this time.Sorry,unless you are a skilled worker of some kind,finding work will not be possible.If it were,I'd be there myself.|`|3xwFPL4naa	Carl gets a little carried away sometimes, but he is basically right.  It's not TOTALLY impossible, just really really hard.  There are a lot of unemployed foreigners in Japan right now and acting isn't exactly a steady job.  The chance of becoming a well-known "talent" is about the same as winning on American Idol.    You can try to get a job as a daily extra (I did this twice during my 6 years in Japan) but the pay is very low for the amount of work (about 5000yen/$50 for 12hours on set), and opportunities are spotty at best.  Most of the people who do it are in it just for a fun experience and not as a career.      You would need a steady job (such as teaching English) to cover your living expenses and to sponsor your visa so that you can enter Japan to work.  That requires either a 4-year degree or 10 years proven experience in a field of expertise.  Technically you don't need to speak Japanese for these jobs, but given the long unemployment lines filled with experienced teachers who do speak Japanese, you need every possible advantage to even stand a chance.|`|AA11286432	Yes there is but it depends on the company.  In my case I was transferred to Japan to work in R&D.  I was already with the company for 6 years and the opportunity came for me to work in Japan.  There are many people who are internal transferees from companies such as Citicorp, Merry Lynch.  In fact I met more banking and investor types versus the technical and engineering types.    As far as acting and entertainment, I am not too knowlegdable, but one my son's pre school teachers was a musician at nite with a pre school day job.

z5fFoTMBaa	For you to get the most feasible options, you can add to your queries by asking knowledgeable drivers in the Dagupan area, most probably PUV drivers.

Nearby that terminal are the co-ops that are composed of vans and mini-buses that have trips to almost every destination. I am not sure though if there are Zambales trips.

AN ACT TO INSTITUTE POLICIES TO ELIMINATE TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS ESPECIALLY WOMEN AND CHILDREN, ESTABLISHING THE NECESSARY INSTITUTIONAL MECHANISMS FOR THE PROTECTION AND SUPPORT OF TRAFFICKED PERSONS, PROVIDING PENALTIES FOR ITS VIOLATIONS, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES.    Trafficking in this sense refers to pornography, prostitution, sexual exploitation, sex tourism and forced labour.    http://www.chanrobles.com/republicactno9...  It has penalties of up to 20 years jail per offence    Depending on how sick the individual is, the anti rape act  http://www.chanrobles.com/republicactno8...  has the death penalty for under 7.    By the way, there are still many foreigner morons who think they are doing nothing wrong because they think the age of consent in the Philippines is 12 or some other ridiculous age.     It isn't!     The age of consent is now 18.     Not only that, US, Australia, UK and some other countries have laws that no matter what the age of consent is in the country that you travel to, you have to abide by 18, other wise you will be prosecuted in your home country.    Something else to consider. I have met people who act to protect children in the Philippines. They try legal methods first but if legal methods don't work, they are happy to employ not so legal methods. Which is why, you will hear of apparent suicides where the person shot themselves in the right temple while holding the gun in their left hand.    I hope this information is useful for the protection of some child somewhere.    Regards; Jim|`|3ebea5843f9fbfc762e23242cd727e4caa	The law of decency and morality and its' not just foreigners.

0Pv2jt8faa	Society has never been as pious as you may have been lead to believe. This is essentially the information age, prior back in the 'greatest generation ever' people did commit sexual taboos, they did do stupid things, and they did plenty unpatriotic activities and disagreed with their country.    However-    Everyone lived inside of their own bubble, they just pretended things like that didn't exist and ignorance was indeed bliss.    Today, these videos challenge us to confront the less-reputable sides of society that, while deplorable, ARE and HAVE ALWAYS BEEN a part of our society undeniably.    It just makes me laugh when kids come to their conclusions about how far society has fallen when in actuality all their witnesses is the bursting of their own bubble, This is the world we live in, love it or loathe it.|`|94538cc37834a8ce835eaaa9de2f31b0aa	Humans are nasty, silly and idiotic creatures.

Such actions portray a very immature and disturbed individual.    They do these without considering the repercussions of their actions at some future date.

HIgoRYEwaa	It's good to see you asking serious questions.    It is difficult to quantify because the data that Chinese government provides are unreliable, they try to downplay the export component of their GDP. But we can safely say that export component is fairly large considering the fact that China is running with fiscal surplus with almost all nations with which it has trade relations.    In an effort to gauge the true picture let us look at the indirect indicators.    Chinese imports grew as much as by 150% in the years 2004-2004 itself. Clearly China's population has not grown in this proportion to justify that all these were for domestic consumption. Going by this figure we may surmise that as much as 60% or even more component of Chinese economy is export oriented.    And the present global economic crisis also offers some indicators in this regard. About 300,000 of the 6.8 million migrant workers from Jiangxi province had returned home by mid-November. The situation was similar in Hubei province, where about 300,000 of its 7 million migrants have returned from cities. The employment situation is really very critical, and this impact of the financial crisis is still unfolding so many more workers are expected to be laid off.    In an effort to shore up its economy in the face of the financial crisis, China had announced a massive 4-trillion renminbi (about US$570 billion) economic stimulus package in November, in order to increase domestic demand and employ the workers being laid off. Many more such packages might be announced soon.|`|RA8PuTd5aa	Think how many things in your home are made in China, this is why their suffering right now and why 6.8% of the country is now un-employed and rising|`|Um9rR3PUaa	China runs a trade surplus with the worlds three major economic centers  the  United States, the European Union, and Japan. Since 2000, the United States has  incurred its largest bilateral trade deficit with China ($201 billion in 2005, a 25% rise  over 2004). In 2003, China replaced Mexico as the second largest source of imports  for the United States. Chinas share of U.S. imports was 14.6% in 2005, although  this proportion still falls short of Japans 18% of the early 1990s. The United States  is Chinas largest overseas market and second largest source of foreign direct  investment on a cumulative basis. U.S. exports to China have been growing rapidly  as well, although from a low base. In 2004, China replaced Germany and the United  Kingdom to become the fourth largest market for U.S. goods. China is purchasing  heavily from its Asian trading partners  particularly precision machinery, electronic  components, and raw materials for manufacturing. China is running trade deficits  with Taiwan and South Korea and has become a major buyer of goods from Japan  and Southeast Asia.  In the past decade, the most dramatic

It depends on exactly when you come and where you'll be in Italy. Carnevale is coming up soon. Other than the big festival in Venice, there are a lot of other celebrations that are both important here and fascinating to participate in. Cento and Viareggio both have big parades several times. The celebration in Ivrea has to be seen to be believed. During Easter, there's the Explosion of the Cart in Florence or many other events all over Italy. There are various Palios in cities like Siena and Ferrara or the Giostra in Arezzo. Or the Eurochocolate Festival or Umbria Jazz Fest in Perugia, Il Redentore or any of many Regattas in Venice.     There's trekking in the mountains or walking the trails of Cinque Terre, visiting the beaches, shopping, ... depending on your interests.

I dont know where that hotel is but most of the good hotels such as Taj (which was there when I went) or Hilton   and many other  good hotels where pretty far from the airport  so I wont know about the cost of the trip but in general compared to many countries India (even Mumbai) has the least taxi fares.....  To get cheaper taxis there are private cars that provide transportation  but they are not as safe as the yellow and black ones which are the ''taxis'' of India..      Have Fun Mumbai is a great city
AA11349530	St Ives is a lovely place, very quaint, very picturesque ... there's quite a lot of pubs and cafes (well, there are in summertime, not sure about February) and I love the Tate St Ives museum and the Barbara Hepworth museum, it's modern art and they've got some lovely stuff ... best view in St Ives is sitting on the cafe terrace on the top of the Tate ... I love Lands End too but not the theme park bit which I find a bit tacky ... once you're past the tacky bit the coastline is fantastic (just hope it's not windy when you're there, because the wind can blast you, there's nothing between Lands End and America) ... it should be fairly dog-friendly in February, most of the beaches don't allow dogs during the summer months but check the signs on the beach for exact details ... there's an interesting telegraph museum at Porthcurno  http://www.porthcurno.org.uk/ but it's only open on Sundays and Mondays in winter ... also at Porthcurno there's the Minack open air theatre carved out of the cliffs http://www.minack.com/ ... there's an old smugglers pub at Lamorna ... St Michaels Mount in Penzance Bay is very attractive http://www.stmichaelsmount.co.uk/ ... Penzance itself is a nice county town ... and you might want to visit Mousehole ... make sure you have a proper Cornish pasty and some proper clotted cream, yummy yummy|`|1yGDFTieaa	I've never been to St Ives, but Land's End, in my opinion, is very nice.  There's lots of exhibitions and shows on throughout the years, the dog won't be allowed in though.   There's a few shops and take aways/cafes, there's also 2 nature walks you can go on. 1 is a 'red route walk', suitable for people who have a good fitness level - the ground is quite rough and it's quite 'hilly'.   There's also a 'green route walk', which is a lot more suitable for the elderly as it's shorter and on flat land. Both routes run close by to the cliff tops & there's a few benches plotted around, too.|`|ZUcQAqRUaa	Just looking around St. Ives is really nice. It's a very pretty town and there are great fish and chips :P|`|bR5Dzulsaa	St. Ives is just a pretty nice seaside town with plenty of shops and seagulls! Go shopping, and visit the beach. But February's cold to go in the sea!    Land's End in my opinion's disgusting. They've build a tacky Theme Park there, so you have some kiddy rides that are not suitable for 14 year olds. There's a farm there, a restaurant and some exibits. I find it tacky and boring and I wouldn't go there if I was you!|`|0cbbecbdc82615f79e12b103dd58a90caa	If you go there determined to enjoy it and have alot of laughs, then you will. If you go there with high expectations then you'll be disappointed.  A holiday will be what you make it and if you depend on others to make it fun it won't be.

zOANDBMaaa	No.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	Sure. It's called 'roaming'.|`|tQsxsuNPaa	check with YOUR service provider.  THEY will know.  It probably depends on the particular model of phone that you have, and the service that you already have.  You may have to pay for extra service.      I don't think you can keep the same number if you change providers to another country.|`|AA10604976	Additionally, you will have to pay a lot of money to call places and you will also have to pay the additional fee for the people who call you.|`|S1uPEgbTaa	Yes but the cost will be too high.  Have in mind that when u use a mobile to another country you are charged for   1) Roaming calls  2) the charge of the foreign netwrok you are using to have signal.    When they call you , you are charged with the 2) .    Its more economical to buy a prepaid number in the countries you go to|`|AA10421518	Yes, you can, but you will be "roaming" and will be charged accordingly.  Ask your carrier to UNLOCK you phone if its not unlocked already.  Then when u go to your destination u can change the sim card and get a local number.  More economical that way...|`|WyWtnigoaa	Cost will be too high for retaining your number as it will be International Roaming.

1Mc6BOvKaa	Ask your new neighbours. They will know what the correct address is.    However, I wouldn't worry too much - if your mail is correctly addressed (apart from the street name) with a full and correct postcode (or equivalent if you're not in the UK), it will make its way to the individual postman who does your round. He will probably be able to work it out.    I once got put on a delivery round where there were some new houses built slightly offset from one of my streets, so had different addresses. They shared the postcode of the street, so I knew they were for my delivery, but I just wasn't sure of the exact location. A bit of deductive logic and I worked it out, and I now know exactly where that is.   The postman in your case is probably used to the confusion caused by the ambiguous street names, as I doubt your the first person with this problem, so you shouldn't need to worry.     You could also contact the local delivery manager, or speak to a postman who you see delivering mail near your new place.    In answer to your last question, online mapping services are notorious for being inaccurate, so I shouldn't worry too much about that, its probably best to go with the street sign.|`|oUjuw66uaa	yes, however, I would start by asking the apartment complex what your correct mailing address is. It is possible that the street sign is in error. Generally, the post office will get the notice very early in the process, and will even correctly deliver mail once the name changes unless the old name is re-used somewhere else in the same zip code. You can also try quizzing one of your neighbors about their mail...
dlHnK7GFaa	i think taiwanese guyz are just like normal guys, and there are really nice ones and rude ones.    i think it sounds fine  i mean, mi friendz been going out with this one american guy for a year, and she said that hez never been mad at her before|`|adL8Qm7yaa	no, we're just naturally nice and caring ppl who have great manners unlike lots of other guys of different races.|`|CKbv7yRfaa	hi girl, im a taiwnaese's girl. I think your bf has good temper, or he did anything bad but dont want you to know, so treat you nice...|`|ExcGJHqMaa	I think it's because most or a lot of Chinese families have morals and values that are based on respect and discipline. If someone gets mad at another person, especially in a relationship, that sometimes shows that that person doesn't care about how the other person is feeling, or doesn't want to be mature and fix things straight up. So basically, your boyfriend must have a lot of morals and values, growing up in a family that values morals, so that could be why...or maybe he's just naturally very caring =)

You should be fine    They pay more attention to a group of young adults than a family of 4.  Because sometimes the young adults, trying to save money they get into the room more than they should.|`|pTLcvsVfaa	Yeah as the other person said, they really dont care, or have anyway of knowing what or who is in your room.

j8c2h9KOaa	I've traveled to Sri Lanka several times over the past few years and have purchased land there. There are three key areas you should stay away from if you are concerned for your safety, the far north, the east coast and the capital colombo. There are also common sense things to do to minimise any risk such as staying away from public transport. A Van and driver can be hired from as little as $30 US a day and this is the safest method to get about, there are plenty of drivers for hire in negombo where most people stay after landing. Having said all this, I had traveled extensively around the island except the north. I found the east coast from Arugam bay (One of the worlds top ten surf spots) and up to Trinco (one of the worlds top ten beaches) to be one of the best places I've traveled to. Most tourists only do the cultral triangle and a few spots around the south coast such as Galle. There is risk anywhere you travel to in the world, its all about knowing the risks and common sense precautions to take. I'm aware of the current escalation in fighting and this will not stop me from going for a month next month to spend time in Kandy and around the south coast.  If you have any further questions please let me know, I'll be happy to answer.|`|zp0twp7taa	yes it is safe LTTE is being pushed all the way to the back so going to a city in the south of sri lanka like Columbo should be safe but if u wait a little longer the war will be over and sri lanka will be at peace|`|AA11141136	http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travelling-and-...|`|AA11732206	For me, I would not travel to any 3rd world country right now.

Or if it is just immitation with (fake) brand names..  I have a LV shoes which is 400 euro,,in Europe,, I could see exactly the same like it is.. and was 300 pounds (you can hardly see the difference)  that will be applied in most of the brand names, bags, shoes clothes, (you will be shocked from the variety  really)..    As for cotton products , you will find that bed sheets as an example is for the same prices like in Europe after converting the euro to Egyptian pound,,, In one condition,, here is Egyptian cotton,, there will be Turkish/ Pakistani/ ..etc cotton... as an example,, Ikea sells sheets (bed set) in the range of 40 euros... you can find here the set is for 300 pounds (which is equal to the 40 euros) but Egyptian cotton which is worth 200 euro in Europe...(for the same Egyptian cotton)|`|AlbJmy7aaa	You are asking for two prices. There is tourist price and local price though.

AA11272288	Sriranga Mahathmiyam is the compilation of mythological and religious accounts of the temple, detailing the origins of its greatness. According to it, Lord Brahma, the Lord of Creation in Hindu mythology was once in a state of deep meditation and in His supreme trance received the gift of the Lord Vishnu's idol, "Ranga Vimana". He was told by the Supreme Lord that there would be seven other appearances of such idols on earth -- Srirangam, Srimushnam, Venkatadri (Tirumala), Saligram (Muktinath), Naimisaranya, Totadri, Pushkara and Badrinath.[3] The idol was then passed on by Brahma to Viraja, Vaiswatha, Manu, Ishwaku and finally to Rama. Lord Rama, himself an avatar of Vishnu, worshipped the idol for a long time, and when he returned victoriously from Sri Lanka after destroying Ravana, he gave it to King Vibhishana as a token of appreciation for the latter's support for Rama against his own brother, Ravana. When Vibhishana was going via Trichy en route to Sri Lanka, the Lord wanted to stay in Srirangam. Vibhishana, while on the way back to his Kingdom, passed through Trichy, and wanted to do his daily Karma [Sandhyavandhanam] in the river Kaveri. In order to do this without placing the idol on the ground, Vibishana found Lord Vinayaka, disguised as a cowherd boy. Following his plan, when Vibhishana was fully into the water, Vinayaka placed the idol firmly on the sand on the banks of the Kaveri. Seeing this, the angry Vibhishana chased the boy to punish him, but the boy kept running and climbed over the rock near the Kaveri bank. Vibhishana finally caught the boy and hit him on the fore-head, upon which the boy revealed himself to be Lord Vinayaka. Vibhishana immediately apologized and the Lord gave him his blessings after which Vibhishana continued on his way to Lanka.    The location where the Ranganathan idol was placed was later covered by an overgrowth of deep forests, due to disuse. After a very long time, a Chola king, chasing a parrot, accidentally found the idol. He then established the Ranganathaswamy temple as one of the largest temple complexes in the world.    According to historians, most dynasties that ruled the South -- Cholas, Pandiyas, Hoysalas, Nayakkas -- assisted with renovation and assisted in the observance of the traditional customs. Even during periods of internal conflicts amongst these dynasties, utter importance was given to the safety and maintenance of these temples.    The temple is mentioned in Tamil works of literature of the Sangam era, including the epic Silapadikaram. However, archaeological inscriptions are available only from the 10th century AD.[4].      [edit] Invasion of Srirangam Temple     A view of the main gopura of the Ranganathaswamy temple in Srirangam. Source:The National Geographic Magazine, Nov. 1909During the period of invasion by the Emperor Malik Kafur and his forces in 13101311, Namperumal was stolen and taken to Delhi. In a daring exploit, devotees of Srirangam ventured to Delhi and enthralled the emperor with their histrionics. Moved by their talent, the emperor was pleased to gift them the presiding deity of Srirangam, which was requested by the performers. Things took a drastic turn immediately. Surathani, his daughter, fell in love with the deity and followed him to Srirangam. She prostrated herself to the God in front of the Sanctum Sanctorum and is believed to have attained the Heavenly Abode immediately. Even today, a painting of "Surathani" (known as "Thulukha Nachiyar" in Tamil) can be seen in the Arjuna Mandap adjacent to the Sanctum Sanctorum for whom, "chappathis" are made daily. This greatly explains the secular nature of the temple and also its all inclusive nature.    Having assumed that the magical power of the deity had killed his daughter, there was a second invasion to Srirangam in 1323 A.D. This time it was more severe. The presiding deity was taken away before the emperor's troops reached Srirangam by a group led by the Vaishnavite Acharaya, Pillai Lokacharyar, who died en-route to Thirunelveli in Tamil Nadu. The Goddess "Renganayaki" was taken in another separate procession. Swami Vedanta Desika, instrumental in planning the operations during the siege of the temple, closed the Sanctum Sanctorum of the temple with bricks, after the processions of the presiding deities had left -- thereby protected the temple for generations to come.    13,000 Sri Vaishnavas, the people of Srirangam, laid down their lives in the fierce battle to ensure that the institution was protected. In the end, "Devadasis", the danseuse of Srirangam, seduced the army chief, to save the temple.    After nearly six decades, the presiding deity returned to Srirangam and the same Swami Vedanta Desika, who had built a brick wall in front of the sanctum sanctorum, broke it open. We learn that the deity of Srirangam had lived in the hills of Tirumala Tirupati for quite a long period of time.    It is not surprising to note that the temple and the life of the people, e|`|AMP2QfEvaa	No you cannot.

dbAWPWzraa	As you can see from anime, their idea of "good"  female voice in Japan is different from yours. Common Japanese girls' voice may sound higher and weaker than girls in US, even they are not trying to look cute.  So that could sound "cute" maybe?    In every culture, there is a different idea about "good voice"  I can tell when I watch world news from other countries.

kgBPU4xxaa	All three meet your criteria and are wonderful places to visit.     Depending on exactly when you go, there may be special festivals or events going on in one or more. Late April - early May is a great time to go to the Netherlands because the tulips are at their peak and the garden at Keukenhof is open. It will be crowded, but not impossibly so with the possible exception of Queen's Day on the 30th of April. There's also a sand sculpture exhibition at Scheveningen through May that's interesting.     Amsterdam has tons of museums dedicated to almost anything you can think of. For art, the Van Gogh, Rijksmuseum, and Rembrandt House are among my favorites. There's also the Frans Hals museum in Haarlem, the Mauritshuis in Den Haag and many other places. There are lots of opportunities for interesting day trips and many good restaurants with various cuisines.    Prague is also a wonderful city. In August, when I go, there's a sculpture exhibition in various squares around the town. There are some interesting museums and galleries and the castle is worth spending a day by itself. There are many good Czech restaurants - prices will be lower if you're not in the immediate tousist sites. Try the Icelandic restaurant too. If you're there take a day trip to Cesky Krumlov and another to Karlstejn Castle.     It's been longer since I've been in Brussels, but I particularly remember the restaurants there. If you go, take a day trip to Bruges.|`|568b9f4467fa278aa658b8d4fbbf1a42aa	Try Budapest, great city and most of the food is damned good nosh!

From Haarlem (a city nearby amsterdam) to Brussels I paid 46 euros (go and return) and I spent 2 hours and 30 minutes to go. So, from Amsterdam to Brugges you must spent a little bit less time and a fare about 46 euros too.  As you speak english you will have no problem to stay there. In Netherlands every single person speaks and in Belgium certainly you will find someone that speaks too.  I stayed in Brussels in one day, and had no idea what to do there. It's not difficult to find touristical information. Many desks are aside the station.  It departures from 1 to 1 hour. From 8 am to midnight.

AA11937736	A fine ambition but it may be difficult. Are you a citizen of the European Union? If not then you can't just pick up and move to France but will need a long stay visa. The French government already has problems with high unemployment. Since citizens of the EU have a legal right to move to France and seek work, the government does not look kindly on other foreigners moving to France.|`|10c1407ad3b148843d1e616e9a4c6215aa	It is not a silly thing to have a dream and to try to realise it.    From what you say, you are still at school and you mention moving "in a few years", so you are not thinking of an immediate move. Who knows what the position will be in a few years?  At present, if you are not a citizen of the EU, settling in France is a very difficult thing to do, just as it is very difficult for French people to move to America, and there are many requirements that have to be fulfilled.  Frankly your best course to enable you to do this is, when you have finished your studies, is to seek employment in a branch of work with an international company in the USA that has a footing in France, and that may send you there because you have special skills or knowledge. Another possibility is work in the diplomatic service.  One of the first requirements, of course, is that you should be totally fluent in French.  Another possibility might be eventually to marry a French national residing in your country and then move as a family.   Otherwise, sadly  there is very little chance of you being able to realise your dream, but if you are very bright and can achieve top class qualifications there is a new proviso for people like surgeons, scientists, engineers, and highly qualified people which may be an alleyway for you. See:  http://www.ambafrance-us.org/spip.php?ar...  You are young and may be able to reach those objectives eventually.  If not you can still use your savings to come and visit on a short term basis, get to know and enjoy the country and have a taste of real French life.  It is so refreshing to find a really young American being so enthusiatic about France as to have already saved to get there! So many are prejudiced and abusive without really knowing anything about the country or understanding the culture. So I wish you all the best of luck, and that you may realise your dream!    PS. I came back as a matter of interest to see what advice, if any, you were given by the post that came after mine. To even apply for French citizenship you have to have resided permanently in France for five years minimum, and the authorities are extremely reluctant to give it. The marriage route to a French citizen makes it a little easier, but it still can take years. There are many people now settled in France permanently that have been waiting a very long time and still have not been naturalised. I am French. My husband is British and he is still waiting to get dual nationality, even though we have been married a number of years.|`|4a3dd6059130a1e40c287cf36fadd7d1aa	I don't know were are you from but I'm French and the only thing I want is to live this country.

After for studding depend of the city you may find nice place to stay. For the cost it's depend of the city in paris the life is a lot more expensive than in the other city. You may need a budget  approximately 700/months.|`|QehY3IEkaa	I admire your brave goal, but making a fresh start in a foreign country is never easy. These few tips may help you :    - learning French language is crucial to succeed in France, even if today many French people can speak English. Speaking French will help your social integration faster.    - travel to France before moving there to konw the country and its culture well. Try to visit many cities/towns to be able to choose which one coult fit you the most. France has a rather vast country and overseas territories, which can be very different from one another.    - Life is as expensive as in the US or in other European countries, and Paris is one of the most expensive city in the world. However the other major French cities (Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Toulouse, Bordeaux, Nantes, Nice, Strasbourg) are pleasant to live in and not so expensive.    - If you choose to become a French citizen (or a European citizen working in France), your spendings will be different than in the US. As a person working in France, you will pay for quite higher taxes than in the US but your social rights will be far better than anywhere else (free health care, free schools & universities for your children, your pension paid by the State and many various subsidies to help you bring your children up or for pregnant women, ...)    - Finding a job may be difficult if you have poor qualifications. But if not, many French territories (mainly outside Paris region) are trying to attract high qualified people (even with subsidies to help you to set up). Today I know that France desperately needs nurses, doctors, engineers, entrepreneurs, ...    Good luck anyway !

You can ask some of the expats who regularly post to that forum where you can go to get rid of your stuff.    http://www.thaivisa.com/forum/Free-class...    Good luck.|`|vvlaZXO1aa	I think Sapan Lek in Klong Tom is your best choice. There are a bunch of shops that deal with 2nd video game counsels.  I'm sure this probably the best place to get a decent price.  As for your games, its probably not worth selling considering you buy them for 50THB.|`|JPgC95I7aa	rambuttri road near khoa san road the bottom part of rambttri has street traders who buy and sell second hand goods but you do not get a great deal just enough to make your last few days in thailand good|`|MIAvPW5qaa	Send me a list what you wanna sell. I may interest to buy some from you .. aspailin@yahoo.com    Thanks,

If you're flying First Class, try Air France. Otherwise, Lufthansa is a very good choice.|`|IEliUISJaa	1. get first class, usually a flight to switzerland is an all nighter no one can sleep in a couch seat    2.air france    3.Delta

dpKntiZoaa	Well I crossed the Slovenia/Croatian border many times, but always by car, and always via the official passport & immigration controls, so I can't comment on trying to find a way around that.    It's an interesting question though because there is no "wall" there, but I know that before being able to join the Schengen zone, Slovenia had to dismantle a number of bridges and crossings with Croatia to be admitted    Countries are not able to become Schengen members without a intact border (hence why Bulgaria and Romania are EU but not Schengen as yet).    So I take this to mean - can you cross illegally? Well I suppose the answer is yes if you are persistent enough, and want to take risks.  If this is advisable is another question!|`|rvTcDJ6yaa	no wall...lol. I went across by train and got checked and back by bus and got checked there.......so no as far as I know|`|65rH6k7taa	Haha, are you actually asking if you can cross the border ILLEGALLY?    Sorry but I don't think anyone should be giving you tips on how to do that.
p3mLEnyFaa	I used to used to be a syspro consultant but now decided to go the Microsoft CRM consulting route.     Topro Employment agencies are dedicated to deal with syspro placements.    Also look up on Abacus Recruitment.     there are online resources you can also look at...  PNET  Career Junction  Careers24    Just google the above to get the exact online address. then you can browse in the IT sector for Syspro listings. I think they even have a search tool where you can type in Syspro and give all possible listings.    Goodluck!|`|kbGmx5siaa	monster.com
