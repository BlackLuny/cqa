J02pqH84aa	i have my nose pierced. in fact i have gotten it pierced in the same spot two times over the scar tissue. the first time did not hurt at all just a little pinch and one little tear that slips out of your eye (not sure why this happens but you cant help it). if you get it done be sure to clean it with bactine because that numbs and disinfects at the same time. i've never heard of a lesbian side to get your nose done but i live in america, not england, so maybe thats why. here both sides are sexually neutral lol  good luck|`|J6ONIsPIaa	The rightside. And no its doesn't hurt one bit. i pierced mine my self all i did was get 2 cotton balls shoved it in my left nostril and took a needle and jabbed it threw without even trying. Very easy and very cute with a small ring|`|UpvzJGAYaa	There is no lesbian side. I have my right side peirced.  Yes it hurts.  They don't numb your nose in England or US. If you can't deal with pain don't get it peirced.|`|hWN52IVjaa	See, it depends on how much pain you can tolerate.  I'm pretty good with pain.  I got my monroe pierced and it really didn't even bother me.  I changed it the next day.  But when I decided to get my nose pierced, it hurt like crazy.  I actually felt tears running down my face.  Not like really crying, but I felt horrible pain.    Ive had it pierced for almost 4 months and I still won't change it.      And no, there is no lesbian side.|`|379b18fddd29f1b64385008f275bdd61aa	FWIW...I think piercings are disgusting no matter where they are. Why do people think it's cool or in fashion to poke holes in their body so they can stick metal in their face (or elsewhere). Think about this long and hard before you proceed.
kCdISEGqaa	Nope, not discrimination.  Employers have the right to have a no visible tattoo policy.  Sorry.|`|4vqzkIr4aa	Rocket is right on the money. Most all places of business have a hygiene and appearance code of standards and are free to not hire or even fire personal if these set codes are not met abused. So you can indeed be told you cannot have a job just because of your tattoo or even if you did not put on deodorant that day and you stink. It is all the same thing and falls under the companies personal hygiene codes of ethics and by no means does it fall into a discrimination category. The only things that fall under discrimination are if an employer does not hire you or fires you for something that is not  under your direct control; such as race, any form of handicapped, scarring, etc... But a tattoo is something that was put on willingly.|`|cdANjmf2aa	tattoos are very difficult in the workforce area no matter what job you are looking for. It would not be discrimination because people know that when they are getting a tattoo, they cannot take it off and they should realize that it could effect what career that they get.|`|gUnE2h1Raa	I think you should be able to do whatever you want to your skin. Color it how you want. Unfortunately a lot of employers don't the the same as myself. They need to get with 2009 already!|`|OdzGPoSSaa	It's only discrimination if you can proof that they didn't hire you because of the tattoo.  Most old school tattoo artist wouldn't tattoo anyone above the neck, on the face or hands.  These are called "job stoppers".  Although tattoo's are accepted by society more and more, tattooing on the hands, face or neck can limit onesjob prospects, regardless of how qualified you are.      Some employers see visible tattoos as a statement about ones view of the world as a whole.  They are afraid that the person willing to show a tattoo out in the open may be a bit too wild for a work place.  If it is a service industry, or a job that requires a great deal of interaction with the public a business may be afraid that the external tattoo will create discomfort on the part of a client.|`|5RoYyprkaa	It wouldn't be discrimination, it would be discrimination if it was something that you couldn't help, i.e skin color or disability.    Most everywhere has a strict no visible tattoo policy.   My sister and I both have tattoos on our wrists, she ended up in the nursing field, and I eventually decided to become a nursing major also. She was hired, but she has to wear long sleeves under her scrubs the entire time she works. I speak from experience that you should always consider careers before you tattoo anything visible on you, because you never know what career you might choose. I was originally Drama major... where tattoos are a little more acceptable, but changed my mind, ended up in nursing...

If you go to study beauty they will help you a lot and just remember to take the course seriously and listen to their tips and advice.    You don't need to know much before you go to college and they will teach you the basics and upwards :)    Good Luck!
TDKi5NuZaa	I have a wife who has used many different types of hand cremes from Burt's Bees to Aveeno and many others which are relatively lower in cost. However, she uses less of L'Occitane to keep her hands smooth and moisturized.  So what I am saying is I think L'Occitane is actually much more cost effective than others in what it does.  Should'nt healthy hands be worth more than $25?
cWK4FVbCaa	Maybelline do really good foundations!    A lot of people like Dream Matte mousse but it doesn't work for certain peoples skin, like mine so try it out first as many people find it doesnt look great on their skin while others love it.    I like their new Superstay Silky foundation that lasts for 16hrs and has SPF and good coverage, it has two sides one white and one is the foundation and the white bit is like a face primer. Im pale and have it in ivory and it does last a long time and looks good!    Their mineral makeup range is very good also i love the powder foundation and have heard good things about the liquid one too!    Good luck :)|`|JrK1gmMPaa	Cool Matte Mousse By rimmel is really good.  Dream Matte powder is an AMAZING powder|`|r0ISrLc1aa	um well i use bare minerals and it covers more depending on what type of brush you use, aka you should use a heavy coverage blush|`|0aWn1Ip5aa	Avon is good because it looks natural and will last.  Try the long lasting foundation in ivory.|`|P1LkXSBLaa	Dream matte, its like the whipped mousse.  and its not as expensive as most ones like it,  and it blends very well.|`|NrScBuhlaa	I LOVE CoverGirl's AquaSmoothers foundation. It covers very well and makes my face look amazing.|`|WQ1sjTPDaa	try another person|`|Oh0WofTdaa	im not sure if you are into department stores or drugstores, but a great drugstore brand is l'oreal true match, i absolutely love its coverage, and its accompanying pressed powder is great to use to finish the look. MACs studio fix is great too, but it makes some people break out so try it out before you buy it. hope this helps!|`|AWc52vOMaa	Maybelline Mineral Powder|`|AA10116762	greenpeace,  wwf,  pastorius foundation,   save the whales,    save the  big cats, wolves, polar bears etc.  music cares,    twloha,  etc.  all fantastkic foundations, hope i gave you some ideas.  :D|`|mYX7kOAGaa	Bare minerals. I have really fair skin and the color matches perfectly and it works well. It covers blemishes, and everything.|`|0smJsIN9aa	Physicians Formula the "anti-mess powder" stuff. I love using powder because it's quick and it gives you an airbrushed look! And then put on some Wet N' Wild Bronzer.
MRwR6eHYaa	just wash it twice a day with anti-bacterial soap and warm water. It should go away pretty soon.|`|e08eab35a22f0c6bf7f5ba2c6c22c1f9aa	buy anticeptic from chemist|`|W8aiAWe2aa	Not realistically.  Sounds like you need antibiotics.  Don;t delay in seeing your GP as bad infections could result in you losing your ear. And i am not joking.|`|ZyIHK47Uaa	Try bathing it in surgical spirits, TCP and warm salty water. Do this as many times as possible in a day and try to soak the earring and it should eventually clear up|`|vjpqvrlsaa	What part of the ear may i ask Is the piercing infected?|`|hUZc273laa	Warm salt water is rather good, if it does not get any better take out the piercing!|`|YAJrXPXuaa	Buy this solution called.    Surgical Spirt, it can be located at a any pharmacy.. Don't go to the doctors cos thats just a waste, the ear infection isn't anything bad, its quite normal for someone to get an infection when you first get it pierced.    It's a spary by the way, it helps, but it;s suppose to sting a little.    xD|`|E83Ma37Xaa	keep good quality earring in, good quality gold or surgical steel. if the piercings still healing from inital piercing you must accept they take weeks to heal. but you must must must keep it clean. surgical spirit, or preferably salt water at least twice a day.. it depends how badly infected it is, if theres any lumps or constant bleeding or pain i'd suggest taking it out, let it heal up, and get it repierced. a good tip is to use vitamin e cream, it's a good moisturiser and will help your skin heal up..|`|nu3tGKbxaa	take out the earings and clean them in alcohol as well as the piercing itself. that should help clear it up in no time..|`|ketg6sGIaa	To try and get rid of the infection keep applying savlon onto your ear. this comes in a spray or a cream, you can get this from nearly all chemists  and pharmacies. this really helped when i had an infection on my ear piercing.  good luck with it and i hope i helped  x|`|SW6fButzaa	Who better can tell you whether it is an infection that you pierce it has "doctors often confuse the normal process of healing with an infection."   If you are infected you pierce your hard to do.   While this scar is normal that this little red, it hurts a little and put a light-colored liquid.   If this infection is very red, very painful and leaves a dark liquid.|`|m2Q2099Vaa	Soak it in salt water- 1 teaspoon of salt to one cup of water.
tFIS2HbVaa	Lotion helps relieve dry skin and make it moisturized. I used to have moisturized skin even without lotion, but when I moved to a place with a colder climate, my skin started to dry out. So, I use lotion now.|`|NtCya5NYaa	women use lotion because they want nice, smooth skin and a lotion that smells nice is always good.|`|jSjb5DUeaa	we use lotion because we have dry skin|`|hNShT9yhaa	Depends, good lotion can keep skin hydrated.    While lotions with cetyle alchol or drying agents cannot moisturize skin but strip it of moisture.
MRwR6eHYaa	it depends on the ring you get. when I got mine pierced, i got the most expensive ring possible, it was double gemed. I think mine was around 65 or 70, but the price could go much lower due to the ring that you chose.|`|ZaadvJAXaa	Mine was $40.|`|W8aiAWe2aa	Between 35 and 50 pounds in UK|`|5r48jn7iaa	most places its $65|`|ZyIHK47Uaa	It depends where you go. A shop will cost more than somebody who does in their home. I had the top of my ear pierced in a shop for 30 and somebody did at their home and it cost 10. (He was trained to do it) Make sure the person definitely knows what they're doing. In the UK it varies between 25-50.|`|oVxr5B3Eaa	Depends where you live and what shop you go to. Around here it's about $50.|`|W0JWq1S7aa	It might depend on where you go, but if you get it with a ring, like a hoop  it's 20$ but for the barbell like regular belly button rings, its 50$  it might be less where you go but it should be somewhere around there  and i would really reccomend the barbell, because the hoop gets infected  really easily, and it looks bad, hope i helped! Bye :)|`|rpwjkuvmaa	I'm in the UK sorry.   My friend got hers today, cost her 20 :)  Good luck!
4vqzkIr4aa	Wounds nice a rib cage piece but I cant be certain because I can't really tell what size you are talking about but it seams large and that as a rib piece seems to be fitting and would match well with the contour of the area|`|rlXGRjAHaa	Okay, Sorry and I am not against gay people or anything, but to put it down there for a guy especially is not attractive.. I would have to say: arms, back, side, or something, but I don't think personally that for a male they should get a tattoo on their hip.. I have a tattoo on my hip, for my father, and It seems more for a girl, but I mean its what you would like, not anyone else. But good luck with what you decide. =)|`|95o30mmnaa	Personally i agree  its new   its different  i like it lol   GO FOR IT!!!|`|7fl1T1k5aa	no offence but i dont think so  if anything maybe if you like avenge sevenfold you shld get the skulkl abover your thing with wings expanding out towards your hips  but if you want to go with your idea maybe on your arm? or on the side of your hip|`|bPXlYHlDaa	Um a guy with a tattoo on his hip? I dunno about that. Girls usually have tattoos there. Why not your arm? I have a Japanese symbol in the back of my neck :)|`|5wDjXzSraa	If you place this tattoo there, when you are older and don't have such a fantastic body, you will regret it. Additionally, if you go shirtless, it sounds like this would be just above your pants line.     On a woman, half a tattoo showing near a pantsline or collar can be sexy. On a guy, it simply makes me scratch my head.     Some nice spots on men: Inner forearm. Back of calf. Inside bicep. Ribcage.|`|jsyr7qrfaa	yeahh that would be.
KSGfrlffaa	mix it and add water, and paint with it=P. haha sounds like it would work.|`|0RAzOuQraa	depending what shade it is, if its an appropriate lipstick color, you could dip a lip brush in water, then dip it in the eyeshadow, then brush it onto your lips, using it as a makeshift lipstick. x|`|pr1sr54naa	add vaseline mix it and you have shiny eye gel. ha ha.|`|5pyIbmihaa	put it on your brother while he is sleeping.|`|Cl6O1uWFaa	Nothing that involves using it on your body as it will be carrying thousands of bacteria very unhygenic u know what to do with it hun|`|WCdiByUBaa	you can mix it with other eyeshadows depending on what color it is it could make them smoky or make your eyes pop either way itl look great mixed with another color. or crush it up add water and you got liquid eyeliner|`|FMwckpMbaa	You can add water and turn it into an eye liner :)    Crush it up and add it to clear nail varnish.|`|df56ca79f426d12c4a6737af42e04037aa	give it to young girls to use on their dolls.  painting is another option
4vqzkIr4aa	Your choices for good work are pretty limited and unfortunately there are a lot of crap studios in that area. But I would recommend Tattoo Station or Triplesix. I am not familiar with any work coming out of Elixir so I cannot comment on that shop.
tE1aoQpfaa	No i really dont..|`|YjkXyHBuaa	yes!  cover up those eyebrows :]|`|OFNmZbPCaa	yeah, but hun, your way to young to be posting picture of yourself on the internet. but your very pretty and would look good with bangs. :)|`|kLf8xFp7aa	No. You look  way too young to even be thinking about being on the internet and posting pictures of yourself so that ANYONE could see them. For all you know, someone  is really a pedophile, no matter what their avatar looks like.|`|SS87lbOCaa	No i dont think you would
xChr07Wwaa	Even though I think theyr'e both beautiful women, I'm going to have to say Megan is sexier. She just looks more natural looking than Emma... less plastic surgery I think. Nobody thinks a blow up doll is actually sexy, and Emma reminds me of one.|`|QvhPJAKyaa	there both stunnin.  im jealous :(  megans prettier by a little bit though|`|CFNozZM8aa	well i'm a girl but i'm soooo jealous of megan fox.  she's absolutely gorgeous.|`|QwHLZaS6aa	o wow thats a really tuff one!  i guess megan...|`|wKjFn7Nsaa	Omg Megan I looove her!|`|9g2OAB8Maa	Megan fox.|`|UmMxmmRMaa	They're both beautiful. I actually can't decide.|`|yheNKIOVaa	o Megan without a doubt! Look at those eyes :D|`|qNUalazGaa	Definitely Megan!
E83Ma37Xaa	waxing isn't pleasant.. just a bikini wax is bearable but Brazilian and Hollywood's are pretty eye watering. but there worth it in the long run; less ingrowing hairs than from shaving and it lasts longer; and majority of guys like less hair down there (:|`|PNnYTqyzaa	I think it depends on the person. I know people that have had it done and they all say different things. Some of them say it didn't hurt a bit!    i say go for it, it's worth it in the end and lasts ages.|`|GLEGh4N0aa	it stings like mad! its worth it though. It hurts more if you shave often before, weaker skin i suppose.|`|1kZenfZzaa	If you want an idea, pluck one out on your own and then think of that times 50,000.  Sorry.|`|t4FBtIsTaa	Very, my bollocks stung like crazy|`|e9pH4Yc4aa	well im probly like the only one that will say this but i think it feels good i like the pain lol|`|EApHtKr6aa	the first 2-3 times is the worse.By the time you get used to it and you don't feel the pain.|`|31ZDLfBcaa	It does hurt but you get over the pain. It won't hurt as much if your beauty therapist is very firm and quick :) It can last up to 3-4 weeks too so it is well worth it.
8sZc1nPJaa	i would mix blue and black  do a thicker line of blue (lighter than navy, maybe teal?), and then put a little bit of black on the inside (top & bottom) that should look really cute (:  your gorgeous by the way !|`|ABOvm38Caa	Definitely brown or black and go a little easy underneath the eye, but definitely line on your lids above the lashes.  It will make your eyes stand out and look bigger|`|fCSGDpROaa	I would say brown or purple.|`|WVh4q9Lraa	try a light brown. it will make the blue stand out. or even a green or purple. experiment! have fun!|`|0RAzOuQraa	i think you would suit a lime green colour, it would look great. x|`|p2MpqvCPaa	Carbon  Black!!!!!!|`|3Oi7OJSMaa	A chocolate brown would contrast nicely|`|0smJsIN9aa	Dark purple Teal or Hot pink. Gold would be good.|`|T3J9BdMaaa	For ur face u should try teal purple  brown black  or any king o blue kind of color cuz u look pretty in blue     hope u like it|`|45SZxJGEaa	teal, brown or black|`|SRs6xcxPaa	i would do a green or purple|`|9IH2Hdlqaa	Brown, bronze or gold.  It'll bring out your blue eyes.|`|QlJje9iAaa	Try teal or brown!|`|7fl1T1k5aa	brown or black will bring out your eyes a lot!
VYwmCGlaaa	YES. its part of personal hygeine and taking care of your body|`|aqHTwscqaa	yes.|`|Nj58Vi62aa	yeah, i find not doing it grosss.. infections, helloo|`|94ab0da7299b6d087039f5b8d0109652aa	yes|`|jgRRsG8Daa	Your assertion that women in India don't depilate unwanted hair is not only a load of crapola but absolutely baseless.How can you state so authoritatively when by your own earlier admission you are a tyro in the  field of sex and sexuality?Could you enlighten as to the basis of your   statement?Your coyness in your question itself is a dead give away.|`|BMCxtpkdaa	yeah; duh.
AsXOZHQbaa	You could wear like a purple mini skirt with a green tank top underneath a yellow top so that like the green only shows on the bottom of your shirt. You know what i mean? and like you could bring one of those mardi gras necklaces and a mask but if the theme isn't really that big you could always just stow away those goodies in your bag and rock the cute colored clothes you're wearing.    as for you hair now matter short or long i'm feeling like a half up half down deal with some waves or loose curls.    makeup: match the purple in the skirt that you may wear. Like brown eyeliner to line your eyes then a medium to light purple eyeshadow.    Hope this helps!|`|Nj58Vi62aa	im sure you have time to stop at the mall, but at my mardi gras dance i wore a purple dress ( really short one ), yellow and green beaded neclaces, black heels. my hair was curled and bangs were pinned to the side. as for makeup i chose white eyeshadow in corners of my eyes, and purple for the lid. have funn : )|`|dJwA9WLOaa	Bold.  Dramatic.  Stick with purple and black and white or neutrals.  That way if it turns out not being a Mardi Gras party, you just look like you decided to wear purple.  I would grab a cute purple dress, a black menswear blazer that fits very nicely, black opaque nylon tights, black shoe booties and make your hair straight, but with a medium to large sized half-back bump.  For make up do neutrals, but long lashes with black mascara and a light berry lipgloss.  Have fun!
SJLgRqgSaa	bread and butter - 120  chicken - 100  0j - 100  egg - 60  cereal - 250    so 630 calories! eat some more fruit and vege and have protein and fibre!! xx|`|wVJ4PJJXaa	Gosh I hope this isn't all you are eating in one day! If so, you are definitely under eating, and doing yourself some harm.     Try Calorie King, they have the calories for everything, including fat content, sugar content, and carb content.

I bet you're a 90 pound twig, and guess what, no one finds that attractive! You get one life to live; why would you waste all of your time counting calories on yogurt when you could be actually LIVING? I eat whatever I want and I'm definately not fat, and I'm happy with my weight. And if you're morbidly obese, just give up. Why waste the rest of your life feeling fat and bad about yourself for not being the weight you hope to be. Be happy the way you are. You're probably beautiful.

nzxsR8Hvaa	Black pants and a party top: something with an awesome neckline, sequins, etc. If your hair is long enough, I would straighten it and put it in a high, sleek ponytail.

qPDnxTE0aa	Try using a oversized band-aid. it would protect your piercing the same as plaster, but would be more hygenic for it.
nwe8mlvZaa	use mascara on your top lashes, and only a little on the bottom.  depending on your eye color, use eye shadow.    if you have dark eyes use a darker shade,  if you have light eyes then use a semi-dark shade.    sometimes mixing eye shadows have great effects, dont be to shy to try it out. do what you feel makes you look beautiful!|`|4u0U5YJyaa	babe.  sparkle it upp.  glitz and glamm.  & stevie knows everything beauty.?

8TJYVTSkaa	would you use a tampon if you hadn't started your period yet?|`|Dm3AHmG5aa	I don't think so I started using them early even though my mom said i don't need them, but I would rather start early. I don't see any harm in using them early, I always use the one that had SPF in them since a lot of sun exposure can cause premature wrinkling. And people tell me all the time that I don't look my age, but I TRY to eat decent meals and drink plenty of water and instead of soft drinks I opt for flavored tea. So the cream is not a miracle worker, you have to take care of your skin and body also. I also take womens vitamins for the extra nutrients that I may not be getting everyday.|`|mP6ox5f3aa	No! Try medicated Polyfiller.  I bought my wife some Vanishing Cream, large size. I haven't seen her since.
731e61cebec438f48fbf84f60ff2687aaa	Hey Melissa! I am 23 too and I am already looking at anti-wrinkle creams so I can preserve myself and age beautifully. But you have to do more than just use anti wrinkle cream, so here is what I do to take care of myself.    - I use a sunblock of no less then Spf 70 on my face and spf 50 for my body.  - I carry a parasol to also help block the sunlight since the sun is quite damaging to the skin.  - I take women's one a day vitamins and vitamin E everyday.  - I avoid sodas and drink mostly water, juice, or tea.  - I wash my face with ponds cold cream  - After I wash my face I use Borie cream to moisturize   - i also use an anti wrinkle firming eye cream twice a day since your eyes are the first to show signs of aging.   - Be sure to wear your sunglasses always to protect your eyes from the suns rays.|`|qL7USs32aa	O_O;; No. You could've started using anti-wrinkle cream when you were 12-13.    The only reason we get wrinkles is because as we get older our skin starts to sag and the sun is damaging too, but people who use face masks, that tighten your skin, at a young age have a less chance of wrinkles when they are older.    There are people who actually have maybe 5 wrinkles and they are 60 years old.    But, you can use anti-wrinkle cream to help prevent in the future. Keep in mind, the masks are there to help too.    Also, saunas help too! If you go to the sauna like once a week, then your face will look fresh, clean, younger, and slimmer. (Just don't go into a sauna where the temperature isn't bearable and remember to wash your face after the sauna.)    OH!    DRINK LOTS OF WATER!    Edit:    What Amber said with sunglasses. You want the ones that protect against UV rays. They will damage your eyes if you don't get UV protection.
hNShT9yhaa	If you want her to have nice make-up try getting clinique it's 100% fragrance free and they are nice. :)    Try some eyeliner, mascara and E.L.F (elf.com) has good makeup thats cheap too if you'd like to get her a lot of it.|`|mYX7kOAGaa	Im 16 but when i was younger i got my friends stuff like that and they all really liked it.     Kohl's usually has some spa kits if you look in with the make up and jewlery they range from like mani pedi kits or other things with make up.    Also i have created my own beofe, get a cute make up bag or box and fill it with tons of make up and nail polish and other beauty things that you could use for make overs.    If you have an ulta nearby they have a lot of make up kits too. Also that would be the best place to create your own because they have a lot of their own make up which is usually buy one get one free so it wouldnt be as pricy.|`|7XUzSepRaa	You could try getting her some beauty products like face masks are fun to do at parties, or a manicure kit for her nails, or just a gift certificate to somewhere she enjoys. Earrings, nail polish, hair bands, lots of stuff you could get her.|`|Oh0WofTdaa	i would suggest this sephora palette: http://sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?...    its sephora so it seems 'grown up' but the quality is great, with many colors to play with, and it priced just right at $32.|`|AA10593735	Try a local pharmacy (CVS usually carries items like this).  Be careful with the whole make up thing though, because you don't want to tick off her parents if they don't want her wearing certain kinds or if they have certain rules about it.  Maybe just get some cool colors of nailpolish!  Most parents have no problems with that, and you can get all kinds of crazy colors.  Be sure to pick up one in light pink and one in white though (so she can practice manicures and pedicures).  My gal pals and I still like to get our nails done and we're well into our mid 20's!|`|OlgTPNDDaa	dont just get her makeup.  get her like pj pants and nice makeup or something from a drugstore  not claires makeup  or like accessories like hair or soemthing|`|SSA8oPNmaa	uhmm, im not sure if you shld give her a makeup kit, cause that wld be popular among the sleepover so she cld get duplicate gifts of makeup. and plus her parents might not agree with her wearing makeup. whooa i sound like an adultt ahaha. okay anyway. maybe give her a couple CDS of her fave arist.   uhmm or something she really likes that she doesnt have...    hope i helped/    Kylie|`|vtcQDBNVaa	well im 13 and i really like to take boy quizes like how do u know he likes you and stuff like that..................ooo and if your her mother try to stay out of the room when they are taking the quiz|`|8lN86rLYaa	since she is turning 12 you keep tape together 12 $1 bills together. use a shoe box cut a lit on the top the money can fit threw. u can design the shoe box any way to make it special. add pictures of yourselfs on it. make it like a memory box. ive done this to alot of my friends and they loved it!!!|`|b0e076153caf6faa4a1f276820aa1b10aa	sephora, they have such cute little kits.|`|SRs6xcxPaa	im in that range but anyway u can just order a makeup kit for 50$ at big lots it have 500 different types of makeup u can get it at big lots if u want a smaller one they might have it or try walmart|`|tc8nbxmyaa	barbie's jammin' jeep is in high demand right now|`|Vk1Aj44Waa	the notebook|`|iLVaBoNWaa	well if u go to wet seal, theres a "girls room" section, u could definitely find something cool their, its all teen/pre-teen girl stuff there|`|C8zrNMRjaa	ok go to any store, like target walmart or anything like that, then pick out a cute bag, like a makeup bag or a little purse or something cute. then you fill it with some makeup, nail polish, and anything else you want. usually i do either a set for nails ( nail polish, file, remover, etc ) or one for makeup ( mascara, eyeshadow, etc ) and they always love it.  hope i helped. (=|`|uZrYy6snaa	I'm not twelve any more but I remember two gifts I got when I was, both were EXCELLENT.    The first was a gift from my grandfather; a dozen red roses, properly arranged with baby's breath and foliage. Assuming you are both girls, it would be better to substitute the red roses for yellow ones because, in flower language, yellow roses mean friendship.    The other alternative is to buy her a set of quality make-up brushes. Make up sets all come with tiny brushes which are poor quality and fiddly to use.  It doesn't need to have a load of different brushes, there are ten basic tools although you can add others at a later date, if you want to. Most girls have a few make up palettes, how many have their own set of proper make-up brushes?  This is what to look for in each of the ten brushes.    1. Tweezers- OK, not actually a brush but they are an essential item of kit. However the handle part is formed, it is the tip, which does the tweezing, which is important. Some tweezers have a wider grip which can be cut flat or on a slant. Others taper to a point which is easier to use for small detail. If you can get tweezers with gold coated tips, even better!    2. Concealer Brush:  Look for square head with tapered corners to tapered, ideal for blending (under eye -square; blemishes-tapered). Long handle, good weight,  great for application precision.     3.  Foundation Brush: Look for fairly large wide, tapered flat head, ideal for liquid or cream foundations (synthetic bristles okay)    4.  Large Powder Brush: Look for large, full, rounded brush (dome shape), ideal for loose powder, can also be used for compacts with pressed powder, and loose beads.  It can also be use to brush off excess powder. (Kabuki brushes seem very popular right now and can be used inthe same way.)    5. Blusher Brush:  Look for full, large head with slight tapering (not as large as powder brush) designed for even distribution and natural looking definition across the cheeks and cheekbone.     6. Eyeshadow Brush:  Look for square head, medium to large sized (a little over 1/2 an inch width), with slight taper at corners, flat, a bristle head that is firm but soft for the delicate eye area. This brush is designed for sweeping color across eye lids and blending.  By using its edge, it can be used for defining eyelid crease.     7. Small Eyeshadow Brush: A small brush (around 1/4 inch width) with round tapered soft bristles. Used to apply detailing such as highlights, crease details, and applying shadow under lower lashes. Also used for blending eyeshadow and eyeliner.    8. Angled Eye Liner Bush:  Look for a small, narrow, angled, flat brush head with soft but firm bristles. This brush is designed for application of fine lines such as close to your lash line.  It is also used for applying powder to fill in eyebrows.     9. Lip Brush:  Look for a small, narrow, flat tapered edge brush. Designed for blending lip liner and lipstick applications. Great for blending lipstick colors too ( I always seem to wear two shades to get the color I want.).     10. Eyebrow/ Eyelash Brush:  You can buy these with a small comb on one side and a stiff bristle comb on the other side. Use the comb to neaten eyelashes and remove clumps after applying mascara, the bristles to groom eyebrows. There is a great DIY alternative though. Wash an old mascara wand with baby shampoo and rinse thoroughly, then dry it. It can then be used in the same manner as above. In fact, it probably works better at neatening the brows than the comb!    Hope this is helpful (and I got it written in time!)|`|7fl1T1k5aa	well not to sound rude, but giving makeup could be taken the wrong way! get her maybe a giftcard from ulta, sephora, or bath and body works!  im 15 and i love all of those places!  also you might want to just get a bag and pick many different eyeshadows and put them in a bag, whats her favorite color to wear? get her all different shades of that color!|`|euFDn0FBaa	I think a manicure/pedicaure party would be the best!  You can go get supplies to do french manicures or fake nails...    if you want makeup go to any store-JCPenney, Wal-Mart etc and there should be makeup kits there ranging from the cheap to more expensive ones...you can always add to it and they are probably still on sale from Christmas
P1VoMS36aa	around 80  xxxx|`|jw72N1moaa	Custom tattoos cost at least 60, but can vary depending on the size of the tattoo, the detail included and the amount of time it takes to complete. Look around 75-80|`|dxPiM5VXaa	My sister got the same and it cost her 80 pound.|`|S0Clu20aaa	Depends how big you want it !! probably about 60 to 80 quid !!!    Go to Indigo tattoo in Northwich Cheshire, he has won awards all over the world !! I have two on my hand and wrists from him xxx There beautiful x x x|`|ZNh9qnzWaa	it depends how big how much detail & where ya get in done|`|EkITdsnkaa	the best thing to do as go to a tattooist's and ask as a lot of tattooists are different, some charge by the hour whereas some will just give you a price.
HxURXoe2aa	when a piercing in your cartilage closes up it creates an oil bubble on the back side of your ear. you could re-pierce it in exactly the same spot but you may not want to do that. i would say put it in the same ear if you want to but maybe move the new hole a centimeter or so...  also, i wouldn't do it at the mall or any place that uses a gun. ive had a bad infection that way. they are supposed to pierce anything besides the lobe using a hollow tip needle. get it done at a body piercing spot for best results.|`|mP6ox5f3aa	If it works, try putting a bone through your nose as well and then a saucer under your bottom lip.|`|EjfJaNn7aa	if it has been pierced before you will be piercing scar tissue, not only will it hurt WAAAYYYY worse but it might not turn out well|`|dNF0fZrSaa	getting it re-pierced could hurt a lot, because cartilage can be somewhat painful to begin with, but once you've got scar tissue in the cartilage, I would think it would hurt a hell of a lot worse..and I'd imagine it would take a while longer to heal...You've also got to be willing to really care for it, I don't know why you're cartilage isn't still pierced, but if it was because you either didn't take care of it, or you decided you didn't want it, then I'd seriously reconsider whether you really want it or not. A lot can go really wrong with piercings.|`|rpwjkuvmaa	Get the piercer to check the area beforehand. If you have a good piecer they will be able to tell you if it's okay. If you're a little unsure maybe you could think about getting it on the other ear? :)|`|E83Ma37Xaa	i've had my cartilage pierced and re-pierced and it ended up in keyloids a nasty kind of lump covered in skin. but that was mainly my fault for getting it done with a needle then a gun over past scar tissue. it hurts a little more but not majorly. if you have much scar tissue i wouldn't recommend it. your best bet is to go to your piercer and ask them their opinion.|`|2TJEy38oaa	Hi... I've re-pierced my ears before myself.. it's not a big deal, just make sure everything is disinfected and be sure to clean it every day... if it gets too infected it might start falling/ripping out because of weak cartilage.
E83Ma37Xaa	Septums are nice piercings. i was there when my mate had hers done. she has several other piercings, including four on just her lips.. she flinched from the pain quite badly; there is no safe way of numbing a septum that i know of, but she said the healing was a fairly painfree process providing you don't muck around with it. get it pierced with steel or titanium, it depends on the piercer but i'd say a septum keeper would be the best to heal with as they are easy to take out if there are any problems..however the jewellery for them are all fundementaly the same through the actual piercing (rounded)..i'm from london and it cost my mate 30 i don't know how much that is in dollars; but seriously shop around for a good piercer ask around your mates or your local directory. good luck :)|`|fZCet3ULaa	the price where i live is $40.  i had mine done & it's hard to keep clean.    also, as for your pain tolerance a septum is one of the most painful place to get it done.    & the way it looks on a person mainly has to do with the style of the person.  if your really preppy it would look kinda odd.  keep in mind some people look down apon tattoo's & piercings in the work industry.    hope i helped(:|`|iwcp9rJzaa	ouch. the septum is a painful one.
skCqsHUJaa	I heard of this stuff called skin ID and they match it up with your skin type so it will help your problem maby you should try that to see if it works....personaly I use stridex pads and netrogena acne solution and it works fine for me but if none of that works for ur skin then you should check into the skin ID stuff..hope I helped|`|EApHtKr6aa	Drink a lot of water and make exercises- go jogging to transpire the toxines|`|ChyqsJ6Zaa	i use aveeno products.  http://www.aveeno.com/productDetail.do?p...  http://www.aveeno.com/productDetail.do?p...    then i use neutrogena pore refining toner once every night and then put an acne cream over my pimples. but i dont use too much cream because every once in a while it dries up the skin.    the aveeno cleansing pads i use every other day before bed, the skin brightening daily scub i use every morning    this has kept my skin pretty clear and it only seldom dries it up.  but when it does i cut back on the aveeno, but still use the neturogena toner every night and the acne cream only in the areas that are NOT dried up.    helpful hint: *use the neutrogena and acne cream LAST. clean your face with the cleansing pads first.|`|rpwjkuvmaa	Best thing I got for my acne was from the doctors.

0OW0zRW5aa	Dark brown and skin color brown mixed. no more than 2 colors though|`|APQ7p3I6aa	In todays day you really can match any color with anything. What you have to find out is what colors look right for your skin color. Go to a cosmetic counter and they can tell what looks good for you. I know the summer colors for 2009 is a smokey eye with pastel colors like lilac, peach, yellow, light pink.

Sorry, it sucks :/    you could do like print or commercial modeling, especially for petite girls (:    Good luck |`|OHfZFR31aa	Even for catalogs, you need to be minimum 5'6" or you won't fit in the clothes. They need models who can fit in the sample size clothing - not girls who will have to have everything shortened. That would take too much time, which you don't have on a shoot.    If you have a good body, you could try swimsuit or lingerie modeling. Or go for acting instead and try to get into TV commercials where height doesn't matter as much|`|AA10411096	Well, often times for runway modeling, scouts look for 5'8" or above. You could, however, do catalogs and magazines.     You can go to any professional photo place (JC Penney has one, Sears has one, etc.) and get pictures of you taken. Then, proceed to create a resume and look for open spots whenever possible.|`|iAphlpqKaa	"five feet one inch"    hahah      but yeah i think you could definitely, you just wont ever be a runway model|`|WHt2NfGaaa	Models are always tall weather it be male or female, the only type of modeling you might be able to do are close ups because height doesnt matter. Runway, normal photos, etc generaly have women 5'7 or better infact the worlds super models are mostly 5'10.    Talk to an agent (that wont scam you) to see what your options are.|`|SCTMtrjhaa	Yes. Height doen't matter all that much. It is your face and body! Good luck =]|`|71204fadefeb0aef75f4761be2bfbc09aa	Hey!  I did a study on height including the model industry. There are different types of modelling that have different height requirements. For catwalk they only take girls over 5'7. For catalogue they are more open, but the shorter you are the harder it is for them to find you work. This is because you need to look right next to other people in groups. For body part modelling (e.g makeup, hats or shoes) height is not really important, and the same for glamour modelling.  If you want help with any more height related issues you can contact me through my profile. I also have tips on growing or, if you're done growing I have tips on looking taller than you really are.  Good luck!  Simon.|`|c3Dhkvvoaa	be a catalouge model! or a face model! you don't just have to do runway.|`|Laq5AenYaa	sure! there are agencies out their that want girls who look real, not like the girl who are 6 feet tall and weigh 110!|`|9Ayaii79aa	Most models tend to be 5 ft 8 to 6 ft but if you have a good shape and pretty face I am sure there are jobs available.

EqVvNnCyaa	Acne can come at any age in your teen years. It just depends on your genes and how your body works. Some people get acne/pimples as young as 12 or 13, others later. The reason for starting late could be possibly a change in diet (high sugar/fat diet stimulates your oil glands) but the most common reason will probably be naturally your body make up.  Unfortunately acne and pimples are a part of life, however you can purchase products to help get rid of them - the best idea is to speak with your doctor or a pharmacist on which products will be best for your skin.|`|AA12081834	One reason may be because of hormonal changes.  You may want to try a gentle oil free scrub that will make your skin smoother.|`|iNVRajhnaa	well that sure is random! but i think it is just occasional...  but possibly, you are maturing more now then you were before. that may just be it, just make sure to wash your face often  also, if its your "time of month" that could also be the reason...|`|z6qIZRFFaa	I have clear skin, but i always get a zit every month along with my period. I also get them from stress, i stress about school work and that gives me zits, but they did go away thank goodness.|`|h1Pxqz5vaa	Everyone has a turn|`|gl1W4qFbaa	puberty stage. that's your answer right there. If your parents had it your most likely going to have it as well. If they don't then maybe the guy you kissed does.|`|ILKWjRL6aa	Exactly the same happened with me! Its due to hormones your horomonal level was obviously low back then and your making up for it know and their soaring sky high as you reach the end of puberty.  Make sure you are looking after your skin... Remember to:  CLEANSE  TONE  MOISTURISE    Use a wash off cleanser as it absorbs excess oil. Use a gentle toner. Try a cleansing lotion from the clean and clear range and avoid rich creamy moisturisers as they will make your skin greasy.    I would recomend using Clean and clear spot treatment gel, clean and clear cleansing lotion, witch stick with two ends in. It should clear spots in no time. But if it gets worse visit your doctor and they should be able to give you special cream to clear it up.    Remember to take care off your skin, and don't stress stress shows on your face.    Take care and don't worry it's part of being a teenager    Tabitha  x
F8LP7I4Maa	I would avoid eyeliner and mascara on the bottom of your eyes - max it out on the top.  If you insist on using mascara down there, keep it minimal and if it looks at all like spider legs, ditch it.  Also, use a dark shade on your crease (I recommend using a primer if your eyes are small - you will get bleed lines) and blend well with your natural skin or any other shades you use on your eyes.|`|w1ZNb0Jeaa	Instead of volumizing mascara try one that makes your eyelashes longer. Also, add silver/white eyeshadow in the inner corners of your eyes and white eyeliner in the bottom. Wing your liquid liner on the top and you're ready to go.|`|QovnMnbNaa	White eyeliner on your waterline, a line of winged liquid eyeliner on your top lid, curl your lashes, and put on lots of mascara, or onsider fake lashes or eyelash extensions.|`|6nkc1N0kaa	Get Collassal Mascara from mabillene and try ice blue eyeshadow/liner|`|T3J9BdMaaa	here are some tips in this site         http://beauty.about.com/od/allaboutyoure...      and here is some videos       http://video.google.com/videosearch?hl=e...|`|skCqsHUJaa	you should try mascara that extends your eyelashs and maby a color of eyeliner that brings out your eyes instead of black|`|2tMJ27gOaa	THE CHEAPEST WAY POSSIBLE: Go 2 Walmart or whereever & get NYC jet black liquid liner for two dollars then get the covergirl quad that has golden shades of bown ranging from an almost white creamy color to a chocolate brown for 5 bucks    If its ur 1st time using liquid liner take a pencil and draw a think line on the top lid next apply the CG quad colors in the exact order they are already in using the lightest towards the inside of your eye and the darkest at the back blend them really well the color should flow place some of the choco color in the crease of your outter eyew/ ur pinky finger next trace over the orignal line you made w/ the pencil liner make the line as thin as possible on the inside and let it gradually thicken to a point in your outter corners and VOILA!!! It may take some practice if you dont regulaarly apply makeup
lSl2Arlpaa	my friend just got a blunt bob cut with bunt bangs and she dyed it a deep red colour, it looks amazing :)|`|llQwjX5Raa	Well you might not like this but it's pretty.     http://www.elle.com/Beauty/Hair/Best-Tre...|`|zCzgjNPRaa	i all depends on your skin tone and your head shape|`|Hlz3mXNvaa	it wouldd suggest do straighten it (if you don't straighten it everyday)  or do something that you normally dont take the time to you.   seeing you in a different way then everyone else, could make him feel special .     :) |`|zsBwkBi4aa	I think this would be really cute!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taI6OimAV...|`|jbdy6HABaa	From the Description it sounds nice. i wish i had wavy hair.   you could maybe go for a full fringe if you want a change
zddIYf9vaa	MOHAWK!!!!!!!     now thats different|`|dd5f7ac6c2748280ff3f8a594a17b9d0aa	Everyone has piercings - that's not different plus it looks like crap when you get sick of it. Since you have dark hair - go platinum blonde - that's quite different. Look into different ways to do your makeup and wear lots of rad jewelry.
rpwjkuvmaa	It's not bad but it's different for everyone.  I'd say 3 out of 10.  Make sure you eat something sugary beforehand to prevent fainting if you feel a bit worried.  Good luck, it will look lovely :)|`|OEaqkDdVaa	It doesn't really hurt, its just the cleaning of it afterwards that hurts.    Scale: 3|`|OBuzcIDbaa	Not too bad. Probably a 2. Just walk around the mall afterwards and distract yourself by looking at hot guys. That's what my daughters did. LOL!|`|iAphlpqKaa	mine was probably a 2...    the lady said that usually it either hurts the same or less than getting your regular ears pierced    and remember its only for .5 seconds so its not that big of a deal|`|OMnNgbMlaa	3 maybe|`|xQGkWlSKaa	I got mine pierced a few years ago. It does not hurt to get it done, but it would hurt for like three months after if you touched it or slept on it. Also, if you don't wear an earing there, the hole will close up pretty fast,even after you have it pierced for a few months.|`|DR4LYQBtaa	It didn't really hurt much but i passed out from it-|`|wKjFn7Nsaa	It hurts for like a second.  Id give it a 4.|`|FA8DLI9baa	no its doesnt really hurt, it feels like a strong pinch but the next day it'll hurt a little because you might have slept on that side  scale: 4|`|UqFqVbgTaa	I'd give it a 1 but different people have different pain tolerances.
c3Dhkvvoaa	it makes me have a subtle glow and evens out my skintone.  sometimes i wear powder.  no i dont wear powder over my powder foundation  i like liquid foundation  & pressed/loose powder, doesnt matter (:|`|qqHx4KmMaa	No, no, powder, and I'm not sure about the last one.
jxRooBhUaa	it's normal for any piercing. i've never heard about that peeling thing, but try using sea salt soaks so it can draw out any possible infections (doubt it, but just in case) and will soften the skin around it. you should be using 1/4 teaspoon for every warm cup of water. soak it on the piercing for 5-10 minutes for 3 times each day.    belly piercings do take a while to heal. you just got to be patient with body piercings. they are really unpredictable, but if you stick to your aftercare, you should see no signs of infection.|`|8IfePMa3aa	Your piercing is FAR from healed, navels take 6 months to 1 year to fully heal. It will be sore for a few months, just take care of it and everything will work itself out.|`|GvZzhABCaa	Peeling can be normal sometimes, it can mean rejection sometimes.   Even though you dont think its rejecting it may be, I had my navel pierced for 3 months and it started to migrate and reject, just keep cleaning it, bandage it when you sleep to be extra careful and just hope for the best.Also, you may be allergic to the metal they used, if you are really worried you can go back to your piercer and ask them to change it to a titanium bar if its not already. Piercings are very unpredictable and you have to remember that but I hope it all clears up for you :)
oqMQotMzaa	You can do a few things here...  Pinch the ear skin (skinlet) in your fingers and completely lube up the end you're going to put through.  Angle the end upwards and while pushing back, feel for it with your other hand on the backside.    If the hole is too tight, you may be ale to run a taper through with the skinlet behind it (you'll still want to pinch or roll it).    The third thing that you can do, IF you have one, is take a small pair or hemostats or tweezers (CAREFULLY).  Hold the skinlet with one side of the tweezer or hemo on the inside, the other on the outside.  Gently roll the skinlet tightly around the tweezer or hemo.  Hold this tight with just a finger on it.  Lube the end that's going through the ear and with the same angle mentioned above, ease the skinlet in.  Once it's in the hole, it will pop back into shape in a few seconds or with a slight turn of the skinlet.
ILKWjRL6aa	Hey there!  You could wax it, painful but the hair will disappear and you won't be able to notice it till about four weeks. It also won't grow back stubbly! The only disadvantage is you have to keep doing it or you will look very odd!  You could also bleach it so noone can see it.     www.boots.com has loads of products that do this!     Good luck  Tabitha  x|`|2Yijblbaaa	you can get them waxed. get them threaded, or you can bleach them. thats probably best. i beach my arms, go to a drugstore and they have skin hair bleach called "jolen"    works great. prbably your best bet bc you wont have to keep getting it done and you wont have pricklies when you dont wax for a while.|`|U4LUBv2Paa	u could wax. i use nair. it says like 7-8 mins... if u leave it on 4 10 its works great (btw my skin is really sensitive)|`|2tMJ27gOaa	Go 2 a salon where you get ur nails done its cheap and quick...I was embarassed my 1st time but the waxers have seen it all & it doesn't bother them this black lady even got her whole beard waxed once! lol Just get some kind of acne medicine with Benzoyl Peroxide in it & put that on ur lip the 1st 2 days after it waxed it'll sting but it kills the bacteria that makes you break out after you waxed tweeze the hairs as they grow back in til the next wax!|`|h1Pxqz5vaa	wax  razor  pluck it  hair remover creams|`|pCfsvdpxaa	do not remove it   bleach it   sally hansen has a face creme bleach!!!!  do not remove u will look like a boy!!! when it grows back and all stubby like  ewwww no ppl will make fun of u!  eww and thats the first thing i notice on dark haired pplp  bleach that **** girl|`|CsWma8sWaa	Try wax but if not, go out to your nearest drug/beauty store and buy nair again!.. I use it every two weeks or so and it works great its about $10 for a tube that will last you months rather than going waxing every time you have to get rid of the hair!|`|l95YdgMJaa	I use the finishing touch that you can buy almost anywhere.  It is painless and it works.
IMOKF6alaa	I got my cartilage pierced with a gun when i was 16 and it hurt then now im going on 19 and i tried to get it re-pierced with a needle it still hurts. do not go there haha unless you want your ear mess up.|`|z6qIZRFFaa	well if it is a gun, then they will use a stud, i would recommend going to a tattoo shop and getting it with a ring, they heal much faster. I pierced my cartilage with a gun, and the stud wouldn't let it heal, but then 3 months later it wasn't better and i put in a ring, and it healed all the way|`|RqcLxDesaa	I would NEVER have that style of piercing done in a place like that! Go to a tattoo/piercing establishment and get it done right. They couldn't even pierce my daughter's earlobes without f*****g it up. And they are way too expensive. Needle is the only way to go! I recomend captive bead to start.|`|h31D5UDgaa	NEVER get your cartilage pierced with a gun!  it can shatter your cartilage|`|pxdEpIZAaa	don't go to the mall first off. Those guns can be dangerous and cause bumps where it's forced threw in the back. I'd go to a piercing shop and have it done with a sterile needle the right way. It will hurt a lot less and probably won't get infected like mall piercings do. As for the jewelry, I'd just go with a small stainless steel stud to start with. they are hypoallergenic and you can always change it once it's healed. What i noticed with the rings is that they hurt more when you sleep because they push on your ear where it's pierced, so keep that in mind.|`|oqMQotMzaa	Any type of cartilage (anything other than an earlobe) should never be pierced with a gun.  On the manufacturer's websites as well as the instructional information that came with the gun, it states NOT to EVER use it on cartilage because it can actually shatter the cartilage and cause other injuries.    A piercing needle (from a PROFESSIONAL studio) is razor sharp and leaves a fine cut where it gives jewelry a place to sit.  A piercing gun rams a blunt object (they're not sharp at ALL, despite it's pointed end) through your ear, giving the possibility of internal damage, and then tears a jagged hole on the backside of the ear, usually making it take months (if not an entire year) longer to heal.    As for an "earring" - just say no.  NONE of those mall places carry anything that it regulated by the Association of Professional Piercers.  There isn't a single implant grade item within those places.  They carry "surgical steel" which is the same metal that they use to make the surgical instruments, not the pieces that will stay in the skin.  To remain in the skin and not hinder healing, it should be "surgical IMPLANT grade".  This includes implant grade stainless steel, titanium, niobium, and glass.  These are all suitable for fresh piercings.    Earring posts are approximately 18-20 gauge as well, which is far too small for the area, as it acts as a cheese cutter if it gets hung up on something, and makes it very easy to tear through your ear.  The proper sizes for this area are between 16g and 12g, depending on the spot chosen, size of the ear, and jewelry selected.    For jewelry, a flat-back and ball or gem front is fairly standard.  You can also use a captive bead ring, although in the cartilage, there's a lot more of a chance of it getting hung up during healing while brushing or styling your hair.

And I love your top! x|`|AsXOZHQbaa	Ok being honest here. You have nice hair and nice eyes, but you might wanna work on your smile a bit, and your nose is a little big. But nothing that makeup can't fix! Don't go overboard but try a new makeup style. A little more on your eyes like some eyeliner and eyeshadow go for brown or earthy dark tones, then put some color in your cheeks and lips. that should DEFINITELY make you look better.    You have potential but right now you need to work on it. Also go for a layered haircut....that would look 10X better.    Try out what I said!!!!

Try and be a little original, it looks waaaaaay cooler.|`|P94EeBvmaa	FAT A.SS MADDY|`|AA10411096	maddy massacre  maddy mess  maddy murder  maddy magnet|`|c3Dhkvvoaa	stoppp talllkingg like thiss please it makess youu look stupidd|`|eh7O4b4Paa	MaddyMassacre.|`|avpv7u8saa	MaddyFatty     Jk      idk|`|jBNdm5y1aa	U dont make a lot of sence??|`|lDHNGNHvaa	Midget Mandy.        The whole "scene" thing is totally over rated, stupid,  and over done. Just be your self, hun, stop trying to impress people.
h31D5UDgaa	Olay Clarify and Cleanse stuff works great for me  If you go to Olay.com they have this flash thing where you fill in questions and it gives you a personal outcome of what they recommend.  I did it and I LOVE what they recommended forme|`|AA12081834	I don't know about the color change.I would definately quit using it though.You may want to switch to a cleanser with a lower percentage of benz. and try an non-comedogenic moisturizer.
AaYEgDwWaa	Nope you look really cute in the pic you both do, I like your eyes and your cheeks|`|lIpjuMTHaa	Not for a dance its not too much. Probably for every day wear its a little too much. You are a pretty girl, you don't need all that.|`|NrScBuhlaa	Yes, you look too "made up". Go lighter on the blush.|`|vnOz03Aaaa	nah.|`|acfd7907edce364d509ad8e43b8f4f0faa	It's okay, but I would be more focused on your minorly blemished complexion rather than eye and lip makeup. It seems you have freckles, which can make the skin look uneven. Apply a light foundation to the face to cover up redness.|`|5TQEMVbtaa	ew yes.|`|3y8YIs3raa	no you look fine :]|`|JbubP1Unaa	YES. way too much.|`|dJwA9WLOaa	No.  But it looks really bad on you AND your friend.|`|XG4TAjcCaa	yeah.    stop asking this question.|`|zsBwkBi4aa	No not really.|`|M1goQz9Caa	For a dance, no. For everyday....maybe?|`|qmG7q823aa	no u dont wear that much.  i wear it 3x more then u do..  :D|`|nTHvXhJUaa	durrr. go less on eye make up. remember less is more:]|`|F8LP7I4Maa	You should try minimizing your eyeliner use on your lower lid or choose a lighter color (for your lower lid only).  I think the most common mistake young women make when it comes to makeup is the misuse of eyeliner.  Unless you can master the smoky eyes (which involves eyeliner, dark shadow and a lot of blending) you should keep the use of it pretty limited. Other than that you are a beautiful gal!|`|2tMJ27gOaa	Thats not too much...it looks like an everyday look to me...i think i wear more than that 4 my everyday look|`|BoXghyRvaa	no....|`|dPvdzEzcaa	yeah i would tone it down a little bit|`|pr1sr54naa	No I don't think so, I think you need foundation though. To finish the look. xxxx|`|3gCbGmmMaa	a little to much eyeshadow.|`|hMZQd7Cpaa	Nope & i see yu like twilight too . !|`|qqHx4KmMaa	That was for a dance so it looks, good and the lip gloss matches your skin tone well, but on a day to day bases it isn't way to much but it is more on yes side.|`|QovnMnbNaa	It's not too much, it just doesn't suit you at all.|`|Fc1fxCU8aa	nah u look ok with that amount of makeup.  but some how u look slutty though
EqVvNnCyaa	Personally I think this is fine. Maybe don't put any more make up than that, but otherwise it looks gorgeous =]|`|oWTXPtxwaa	Na you're fine.|`|QFA3A0Vaaa	Nahh, it's just right.  I wear that amount too.|`|1Hx7MFUvaa	I think it looks great, however, how old are you? If you're younger than 15 it is too much.|`|Oh75DqReaa	well not as natural as the left girl|`|ADfQ19nQaa	kindaa  fix your eye make-up... sorry just trying to help..|`|BoXghyRvaa	Stop asking this question.|`|M1goQz9Caa	Too much eyeliner in this pic. It looks like you smudged it on accident.|`|7J5nO8mraa	no. i think it looks good. thats how i wear mine|`|2tMJ27gOaa	Didn't u just ask this question w/ anothre pic? If there some sort of stigma you have with urself wearing 2 much makeup than mayb ur 2 young and insecure 2 wear it n the 1st place....      Jeez the real question is do YOU think ur wearin 2 much makeup?|`|vUypopU8aa	its cute  i like your eyes :)|`|Pz8rIt26aa	Yes.|`|4WDmv3cGaa	eh idk if i like the eye shadow but the rest is ok|`|ZUq54bhsaa	you look fine don't worry about it =]|`|D1AFV4ZXaa	looks fine. its not too much
QFA3A0Vaaa	A shimmery silver would look good.  Use silver accessories too.|`|1VZYryW2aa	Stick with the cool colors! I'd say do a medium purple eyeshadow. Nothing too dark or too bright.     http://www.kissandmakeup.tv/bourjois.jpg    Maybe around that color. And I always love a darker lip gloss.     http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_h7qGmw8uoqs/SO...    Like that. And then a feint blush to top it off. Good luck! :3|`|APQ7p3I6aa	What I would do is use a dark Blue and a silver or a medium pink. I would use blue eyeshadow because it will pop your eyes out.|`|pxdEpIZAaa	I'd personally go with a nice shimmery peachy/gold skin type color for the shadow and black mascara. you could always go all out and do the black liquid liner 40's pin-up look. There is a good tutorial on Youtube for it. It's in gold, but you could switch it up however you want.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAiQoeSCm...
LEUaHjFJaa	you have wicked pretty eyes! im jealous! my friend has hair like you and she likes to take some pieces and poof them. but she leaves her bangs out. it looks awesome!|`|jSlW86WCaa	You could always try gelling it spiky like Ashley Green / Alice Cullen from twilight.|`|jZguzD2Raa	http://www.fashionmaniacs.com/Short-hair...    i really like this style!|`|snIMoXomaa	You could clip your bangs back into a pouf (:|`|NxapqL8Baa	clip it up in a messy way with a beautiful clip  just screw it up then clip it in place .    http://www.hairstyles53.com/wp-content/u...    or messy  http://img201.imageshack.us/img201/6349/...|`|kEEPdj2kaa	uhmm maybe clip bangs back, scrunch it, straighten it, make it wavy some how.....
lIpjuMTHaa	You are begging for attention or you are anorexic. Either way dont ask stupid questions.|`|8sfybuGZaa	no you are hot|`|3u4HU7rdaa	NOOpe|`|I6pmPb1Baa	are you serious?  jeez, if you think your chubby then i must be morbidly obese.|`|Xef2mbGcaa	Your kidding?  NO.|`|eFaYMmuraa	You're joking right??? You need help if you think your fat|`|oRr9SOIqaa	ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?!|`|tjFcfI9Aaa	OMG UR THIN AS A FUKING STICK I HATE IT WHEN GIRLS DO THAT IM CHUBBY AND YOUR QUESTION PISSES ME OFF|`|o1Qmp8Hhaa	it wouldnt hurt for you to lose a few pounds!|`|VYwmCGlaaa	NO. goodness|`|faf627e55a95a22d42d6bbdbbb2c5170aa	No, you need every ounce of weight you've got.|`|0RQkeLyOaa	Your fine but you may want to put on some weight because you would probably look a lot prettier.|`|e68a6a673385cf8ff6673cecb42f930aaa	Your not chubby at all.  Your outta wack woman ahha.|`|VJhZe9VBaa	no but you need braces. badly.  and you know your not fat. your sitting in front of a cake smiling.|`|ysZ0CRFnaa	seriously?  no, not at all!!|`|QnkiJga8aa	no, get a life|`|qmG7q823aa	no way.. u are a perfect size and even if u were no big deal as long as ur still the same person.|`|QCdpBqhHaa	wow you're  a whale...surprised that u didn't break that chair|`|T0CTrqNhaa	No, not at all... I couldnt believe it when you said you were the one on the left!|`|luSsPXi3aa	nooooo. are you for serious? ur nottt fat, at all. ur actaully really skinny. and im nt lying cuz im not fat either, if u think u weigh a lot, it might be cuz ur tall. ur not skinny @ all.|`|QlJje9iAaa	you know you are not|`|Gf8Hi4Pbaa	No but hun, you need 2 brush your teeth or whiten, I need too to. It's ok. But you are NOT fat or chubby or anything like that!|`|fNi1OpBvaa	NO! You look anorexic!   If anything you need to gain weight!  God bless, you're beautiful by the way=)|`|7wrko11Vaa	no shut up|`|EwFq9zMqaa	you see, this is what all these freaking size zero models are doing to the world.    YOURE FINE!|`|1Hx7MFUvaa	I think you might have a eating disorder / body image distortion if you think you are too fat. You should get some help.|`|IIqaqe4waa	no, yer pretty.    lmao i like how alla of the jelous people say "get a life"  and the guys hit on you and say "no your hot"  ha.    anywhoooo  ur not fat- dont worry about it(:|`|zWB3jHHPaa	stop being a loser. you know your not fat, you just want some attn.. and yay you got it! now go party!|`|L3Rj6vbJaa	yes|`|AA10034285	My dear young lady, please forgive me for saying so, but you are positively skinny.    You really should not bother yourself worrying about your shape just now. In the next 3 to 4 years it will all change as your bones and musculature develop. Very probably you will develop to look a bit like your mother when she was a teenager.    Keep eating the fruit and veggies and give up the sugar and salt and you will have nothing to worry about in future.|`|JlDZjyR6aa	Uh no hun you could afford to gain some weight if anything :)|`|EUBz5bi8aa	oh my gosh thts ridiculus you cannot honestly even think you have fat on your body|`|hWZfV8YWaa	nope|`|9yqjMpvzaa	yes|`|WqcFvyWDaa	You are like the skinniest person i have ever seen.
apixtZQoaa	Either the person doesn't feel confident with themselves or he or she is looking for someone to tell them he or she is pretty.    Personally, I feel the same way about what you said ( the RAPE ME part)|`|acfd7907edce364d509ad8e43b8f4f0faa	Posting your picture online screams "rape me"? I don't understand where you got that from. I don't think that at all. Obviously those who ask just want attention, or they are insecure about how they look and want opinions from strangers. I guess everybody on Myspace wants to be raped. Who knew?    Somebody else already asked this question recently. People ask it every day. Perhaps you should type "Why do people ask if they are pretty" in the "Search for questions:" box up above before asking a question. If you did so, you'd notice 131,709 people have asked the same thing. You're so original.|`|nY5J8CNsaa	who cares about the questions i hate the fact that most of the repliers LIE to boost the peoples confidence|`|VYwmCGlaaa	because, they want to know what random people think of them. like if they would just see them on the street, its not vainity and its not screaming RAPE ME for most, if not all of those questions. its just pure curiousity & the want to look good, yes looks are NOT everything, but naturally us being human they mean SOMETHING. and i bet you in the future or already have put a picture of you on here. just saying|`|2tMJ27gOaa	Some people are super insecure! Just be happy YOU don't share those feelings w/ ur peers lol. All I do is tell them the truth e/out sugar coatin it...it is sad that ppl cant look in the mirror & just like what they see...after all we have no control r input over how we look neway right?|`|uVhE16v1aa	Obviously, it is because they want to see other peoples opinion of themselves. There is nothing wrong with it and if you dont like it then don't read the question!      ..nothing pisses me off more than judgemental people!    And I just love "Maybe you're my love?'s" answers. May I add, you were burnt like toast girl.|`|3HAumXuGaa	its because so many people are insecure and they need other peoples approval to feel good about themselves. the people that post comments saying "stop fishing for compliments" the reason their fishing for compliments is because they are insecure.|`|FxAD44Moaa	actually it's a way to get attention...     yes..  some will consider that a potential  for harm to the person if there's some weirdo out there scoping the yahoo servers for victims.      otherwise i think it's just a call for attention.. most already know how some feel so thus they wish to spread about their  attention online...  and get hit up on.      it's pathetic and a waste of bandwidth actually, they want to show off their looks  (and most shouldn't.)   they should find those  rate me sites instead of using yahoo answers to promote their faces.    (and whatever else they seem to be pushing their luck on)|`|eFaYMmuraa	Everyone wants to know what others think of them.  It's much easier to ask strangers and you know you are going to get an honest opinion!   I've never done it but im so tempted im just curious... and im much older that u!|`|JdFgf575aa	i know right!!|`|9dr0BZIbaa	When you are maturing into an adult, you worry more about appearances.  It's only human to worry about what others think about you.  The girls who put these photos on the internet probably have low self-esteem issues.  They need assurance, even from random people, that they are pretty.  I personally believe that it is very dangerous to spread any ounce of your personal life, let alone private pictures of yourself, on the internet.  You never know who is out there.|`|Xef2mbGcaa	Stop complaining and go to the sports section or something.|`|ozOmW2NBaa	because 12 year olds need to get off the frikin computer.  and they are just fishing for complements :P|`|dhj3ynjeaa	um.............try going in another section, then...|`|8UyUhlusaa	because people don't understand that our bodies are just a costume.  And they're shallow and insecure and just stupid.|`|QMlWKN6maa	I agree. It is an attention thing. Kind of freaky that people would post that stuff on a site full of strangers at any age, especially that young.|`|9JQiIQvfaa	mind your own bussiness and worry about you.
U2gu94nJaa	try wearing it in a high or low bun|`|sHgXTD1Oaa	up with a fancy rhinestone clip   wash your hair, braid it, take out braids in morning|`|hRU3l71laa	to get your hair shiny use   Flex Shampoo Balsam & Protein ...barely scrub your hair...then comb it while your rinsing it.  Next Use  Suave Conditioner (any "flavor" you want) ...then comb it while your rinsing it.   And last but not least do your final rinse in cold water if you want shiny locks ( they wont look oily. just that good clean shiny hair type!!!)  !!!    hope that helps...Im in beauty school right now and thats my sloution to great hair!!!      good luck!!!      Im Actress Cheyenne Logan   That's my hair when its wavy!!! in the website below
58qreqK6aa	Curl your hair if you usually straighten it, or straighten it if it's normally curly - do something different.  Experiment with makeup. Maybe use liquid eyeliner if you don't usually use it or perhaps try a bold lipstick. Experiment!  I'm sure you'll look lovely whatever  x
cQNOWMktaa	No, that's smashbox.  Definitely.     It was a limited edition item.|`|PKe5F82jaa	A lot of fakes about on Ebay. I wouldn't trust it for make-up especially sout after brands such as smashbox and mac etc.     There very good looking fakes but ingredinace are cheap and could be harmfull.     Best to stay away.     :)|`|96ndKQncaa	Yeah they are genuine smashbox.  i mean i have seen the factories that distribute make-up. and they export smashbox.. ive never seen fake smashbox before.. i am 99% sure they dont make fake smashbox.  and those eyeshadows are widely avalable  in the high street ect.
a6beQD7Qaa	In my experience the all-over shimmer stick thing = much too glittery, I found the eye shadows pretty much useless but then I do have a darker complexion so maybe they would work better on someone fair?? The eyeshadow brush is really good but I definitely wouldn't recommend their  face brushes - very scratchy, I should have known better, you can see how bad they are from the pics on their website but at 1.50 I couldn't resist hehe. I do like their twist pen glosses though. There are loads of reviews on makeupalley if you're interested in anything in particular. All in all I think it's alright if you're trying to build up your makeup collection on a budget, & if you find you don't like something at least you haven't spent a fortune on it :)|`|APQ7p3I6aa	I have never heard of it. I use Golden Rose Cosmetics and that is pretty cheap. I buy my stuff on amazon.com there stuff is really nice and the eyeshadow are really pretty I like the the Terracotta Eyeshadow.|`|cQNOWMktaa	yeah, it's pretty good.    Some of their make-up comes in cheap compact cases that break, but you can easily fix it. The colors are highly pigmented, while others are subtle. The sad thing is, their makeup comes in really small cases.  But thats only so you can use it all before it goes bad.    The mineral eyeshadows($3), the liquid lipsticks($1), eyelash curler($1), and all brushes($1 each) are my favorites. |`|u9NnRt7Naa	I ordered some stuff for Xmas and I was pleased with what I got. Some of the products (eyeshadows, lip glosses..) are smaller than most other brands so maybe that explains the price.   I guess it also depends on what you're interested in getting-I didn't like the blending brush (feels rough on the skin) but I loved all the other things I got. Obviously they are not MAC but they get the job done pretty well!   P.S. There are quite a few E.L.F. reviews and hauls on youtube so maybe they can help you "investigate" the particular product/s you're interested in.|`|wCvnw9A5aa	I ordered some brushes and shadows. I would definitely recommend looking at there brushes and their studio line of brushes. However I've never been to pleased with the rest of their makeup. I would suggest checking out makeup reviews on youtube before you order a product. If you have anymore questions, just ask :)|`|dqdlbJMhaa	I have bought a couple of items.. ALL there makeup is crap.. out of the brushes one is really good.. don't waist your time or money!|`|joiacDUdaa	Yeah, I've used it and it's not bad... I order a full-set of brushes from them every yr.  I mean for only a $1  piece it's good to replace them yearly!  Or I'll wait till they have a BOGO 50% off sale and get acouple sets of brushes.. The make-up does come in cheap compacts but, for $1 it's nice to try some different colors... The one product I did NOT like is the liquid eyeliner... but, for $1 it was ok....
ozOmW2NBaa	go neon :D  thats always cute  maybe like a green or a orange  or even a mix of both  or light blue and pink? lol(:|`|UZKg2odzaa	white! it's the new black :]|`|xphtBaAIaa	My friend uses a pencil and dips it into the nail polish then draws a design onto her nail :] It works pretty well!    How about blue? :D
oQYcpM73aa	You know your kind of right  i mean they're generally the same  but of course some people have fatter and thinner lips than others|`|axwdwiSuaa	everyone has slightly different lips.|`|1Hx7MFUvaa	He's probably telling you that he loves your lips because he's looking for a certain sexual favor from you. I have huge lips for a white girl and all throughout high school girls would either make fun of me or guys would be saying "Damn, I bet you give good ____. (fill in the blank). So just say thanks and leave it at that.|`|VT7T4m8Saa	well... i have a huge cupid's bow. like, my top lip goes down in the middle.  my best friend literally has NO top lip, too. so yeah, you can have different lips. :)|`|mMByiHaQaa	Well you either have fat lips, really thin lips like someone I know, or just normally sized lips.    | The Stig |

qL7USs32aa	First, use warm water to wet your face.    Second, use a facial cleanser or something gentle on your skin, like dove.    Third, after you get the soap on and you scrub your face (NOT TOO HARD!) rinse with the warm water. After you get the soap off with the warm water, change in to cold water and rinse again.    The warm water opens the pores, the soap gets rid of the dirt and grease in you pores, the warm water (again) rinses the soap out while keeping the pores still open, and lastly the cold water closes the pores so that dirt has a hard time of getting in.    Wash your face everyday twice a day. Once in the morning and once at night. Use masks with medication in them, to help your skin become smooth and tight.    When drying your face dab lightly. NEVER wipe roughly. It will make the dead skin come out and it isn't good to wipe that hard anyway.    After drying you face, put a moisturizer with alpha or beta hydroxy acids.    NEVER use HOT water on your face or body! It will damage your skin.    Edit:    O_O;; You're welcome!|`|5IYCSFVuaa	use warm water and scrub your whole face for about 2 minutes, use like a circular motion, and then rinse off.  do that in the morning and at night.  you should be getting clearer skin after awhile.  goodluck! :)

AA11568652	Well....assuming you have curly hair to begin with....    I use Frizz ease mousse and hairspray.  After taking a shower, I just brush my hair, put mousse in it (just spray some in hand and rub all over hair), and then spray with hairspray and let air dry.    If your hair isn't naturally curly I don't know how to do it.|`|82f01eb1519c0efa6241fa3b95ff45bcaa	i have same question!!!!!!!|`|AA10862126	Wash your hair or at least get it wet then put gel in it.|`|526f6cca4804cfe11ebb72c67cf82fafaa	The way I do it:                                As soon as you get out of the shower, just towel dry it. then part it down the middle and distribute the mousse evenly through your hair, scrunching it as you put the mousse in.  then let air dry, but if you want more spirals you can put curlers in after the mousee and let air dry|`|17b4e4e42e72617018a77f1e98c1b201aa	wash ur hair n when its wet put lots o mousse on it and crunch ur hair up and then put lots of hair spry on. key is make sure ur hair is wet. hope you can make sense o that. x|`|0922ba156588e33b9b0d42acbef592bfaa	I know exactly what you're talking about. They are called straw curls. But they aren't done with mouse. You have to wet your hair and roll it with straws and let it dry. It will take a while to let it fall when you take it out but it's worth it. If you want something quicker you can do the mouse thing with some regular rollers and when you take it down pull the curls apart a little for the look you want.|`|6972c17ba8cc294bc5fbce34e9d3cd19aa	Saw it on "what not to wear"---they did this makeover and the hairstylist showed her how to do that to her hair....  Wash and towel dry.  Put in some styling gel or curling creme (really doesn't matter what you use---as long as it's some kind of defrizzing 'gunk' of some sort!)  Then take small sections of your hair and twist them really tight then twirl the twist around your finger.  He did it really fast just to seperate small sections (about an 1/2 inch or so thick) and then let them dry.  If you have some curl to your hair it will dry in spiral type curls.
1478341fde951a7bc7346e7852fc335faa	Ti posso dire come le utilizzo io?!  Li metto sia con i pantaloni lunghi che con quelli corti:  nel primo caso lascio la maglia fuori e se sta bene aggiungo magari una piccola cinturina...  Con i pantaloncini invece la infilo dentro, sempre utilizzando una bella cintura (in questo caso le uso solitamente un po'pi alte...).  Stai attenta per, se la maglia  troppo spessa rischi di sembrare pi in carne, devi vedere tu se ti f quell'effetto.  Se ti va di vedere altri modi per indossare questo tipo di maglia che va molto di moda quest'anno ti consiglio di sbirciare nei cataloghi di abbigliamento e nelle riviste di moda, e poi, provando, vedi come ti stanno meglio...

La cintura da sempre un tocco in pi all'abbigliamento!  Quindi, perch no?  Altrimenti, se vuoi optare x i jeans al posto dei pantaloni, allora puoi benissimo metterli dentro agli stivali!  (ma lo puoi fare solo coi jeans, non coi pantaloni, mi raccomando!)  E cosa molto importante: non infilare mai la maglia dentro ai pantaloni!!!  Questo  un "lusso" che ci si pu permettere solo con le camicie, ma con le maglie no!  Al limite, se la maglia  molto lunga, la puoi indossare con i fus (non so come si scrive) e un bel cinturone sopra la maglia e il tutto indossato rigorosamente coi tacchi a spillo! (in tipico stile '80, in pratica!)  Infine, x quanto riguarda il color marrone, in teoria, una regola del mondo della moda, dice che non va mai abbinato al nero, xch tutte e due sono colori molto scuri (come anche il blu e il nero) e la regola dice: colori chiari con colori scuri e viceversa!  Ma se non hai altri colori, fallo pure!!!  Al limite "stacchi" con gli accessori!  (x es. con un bel cinturone bianco o beige, x intenderci)  Spero di esserti stata utile!

wVJ4PJJXaa	I say go with the Dandruff Shampoo.  Dandruff is cause by an imbalance of the scalp's oils (you have dandruff cause your scalp is over producing oils).  The purpose of the Dandruff shampoo is to bring balance to your scalp's natural oil production, hence no more oily scalp and no more dandruff.     =)|`|Ir51Eb0Kaa	These shampoos are not expensive so try both of them ?|`|qfSKgxDsaa	Use both!  Haha if you have enough money buy both of them, use one one time and then the other one the next.  Or look at head and shoulders, they are ALL dandruff control and have several different options and I'm sure one of which is oil control.  :)|`|Pjz7gEaXaa	I would not use any personally. I was at my grandmas for a  long week and I forgot my own chemical shampoo. I wa stuck using lemon tea tree oil on my hasir for a week and it didn't even work. Since then I have not enjoyed nateral or herbal shampoos|`|l88wIu2Eaa	yes, yes YES YES YES.. well thats what the woman overlly reacting to the shampoo says in the advert|`|KIcnBGoQaa	try both!|`|y5sWmbtnaa	Shampoos like those cause build up on your hair and are not good for your hair.    Try finding an Organic product like M.O.P. Also a good choice for oily & Flaky is something with Rosemary and mint, it will keep your scalp comfortable and help with flakes AND the oil. Aveda makes a good one like that.    Dandruff it self can be caused by your oily scalp however Dandruff Shampoos such as Head & Shoulders can be damaging to your hair, regardless of what commercials say...they are just trying to sell a product but its still no good for hair.|`|0pY9smlqaa	Herbal Essense No Flakin' Away anti-dandruff shampoo  because that will help with the flake and dandruff.

lbABfa2taa	try big bold prints and bright colors that will really make you stand out. also try dresses that are medium in height since you are taller than most (you really want to highlight that) also wear something to go with it that really shows who you are.  good luck. :)|`|9dr0BZIbaa	It is true that they want you fresh and casual, so wear a plain white tee and skinny jeans.  However, depending on the audition, you may have to bring a simple dress or even a swimsuit.    TIP:  Be sure to bring makeup-removing wipes, and a hair tie.|`|QlJje9iAaa	For a modeling audition they want you very casual.  Nice jeans, form fitting white tee, and black pumps.  Hair back in a ponytail and very little makeup.|`|8N7echgnaa	where are the choices?
MvDu7hZmaa	The answer to your question is yes, but only if you have a certain hair texture, or style in mind.  Some hair textures "straighten" when the hair is wrapped---preferably after shampooing and conditioning.  Apply gel to wet hair, wrap and allow to dry while wrapped (in a silk or smooth head scarf).  This works well if you get a good hair cut that requires wrapping, or if you wear your hair pulled back in a pony-tail or a bun.      I find that the AUSSIE line of hair products takes some of the wave/curl out of my hair.  Another great line is PANTENE because their products help keep your hair from breaking, and it grows longer, faster.  Longer hair is easier to straighten naturally than shorter hair.|`|C7yXxVQwaa	besides using chemicals which can damage your hair a lot, use a hair dryer and use a brush when blow drying it to make it straight.|`|gyxB0lDIaa	Yes there are ways it all depends on what you prefer. you can do a warp after shampoo and conditioner Get gel and a good brush or comb and warp the hair around your head and put gel on after that add a scarf. you also can use big rollers the use to use soda cans wrap the hair around and place a pin in and what for it to dry take down rollers and it well be straight with the ends flipped        Also you can comb out the curl by pulling on it while it is drying however this takes time and you have to comb it allot You also could wait for hair to dry and get velcro rollers put them in put spray on and wait 5 take it down and the hair well be straighter|`|WT108qwZaa	you brush your hair out straight till it is dry that is the only way     i would tell you but my friend wont tell me  use heat tool more efficency|`|cFSpYoDfaa	Just a chemical perm and even then it will need to be blow dried.|`|E2aN3ZBaaa	no i  don't know    what i know is that there's one way called ''torniquete'' but that's in spanish and i don't know how it is called in English|`|s4psKJrPaa	theres shampoos for helping straighten hair, try herbal essences dangerously straight. and you could do wat the other person said, brush it straight till its dry. hope i helped!    mine please! http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...|`|0S92MwtJaa	perm    get a perm that straightens ur hair  but its gonna use harsh chemicals    iono if its better then using heat everyday though|`|1E19R3bcaa	Hey yea there a a way I don't know the name of it but is a chemical straighting product
pc7ZjexJaa	put some salt in water and clean the holes with a q-tip    as for the soreness...I've never done anything about that with my piercings    my nose was infected for a bit and I just did the salt water thing and its fine now|`|IMOKF6alaa	A sea salt mixture, of water and sea salt about 2/3 tsp of sea salt and 16oz of water. do not use alcohol or peroxide. And do not sleep on the side that your piercing is on.|`|M0K2Ukw0aa	After a couple days to a week the pain should go down so that it will only hurt if you touch it or hit it on something..   Just keep it clean and avoid touching it and don't sleep on that side.   If it still hurts this bad in a couple days then go back to the piercer.     It's a very painful piercing and it does take a long time to heal.

Pz8rIt26aa	The skin around your eyes is much thinner than on your face. A face moisturizer on them could cause irritation, redness. If you used an eye cream on your face it wouldn't be strong enough to penetrate the thicker skin of your face so you'd be wasting it.|`|21cf999bfe54057972e1de48b7cd2cf3aa	The skin under your eyes is thinner and therefore more sensitive than that of your face. It really won't hurt to use the creams interchangeably, but for some people face cream might be too heavy or harsh for the sensitive eye area. Plus, the skin around your eyes ages faster and might benefit from a different set of ingredients. Sometimes specialized eye creams are more expensive and come in small containers and you would not want to "waste" these by using them on your entire face.

Thursday: Teased Half-back     1. Tease your hair.  2. Take a two-inch hair section (starting just above your left ear), and twist once.  3. Secure twist with bobby pin. Insert pin at an upward angle so that the teased section will retain its volume.  4. Repeat (working from left ear to right ear) until all your hair is pulled back into a half-ponytail.    Friday: Polished Loop     1. Make a low part on your left side.  2. Sweep your hair to the right, and gather your hair into a low ponytail below your right ear. Secure with an elastic.  3.

wtQY6VEwaa	I don't know the exact law, but I'm guessing that self mutilation of ones body is somehow against Islamic law. It is at the least looked down upon greatly.    How cares though?

I know a Muslim girl who had a small jewel glued to her tooth, it wasn't permanent and eventually will be gone, but it caused such a problem with her family. She didn't need that sort of thing to begin with, she's very beautiful with no cosmetics at all.|`|AA11503678	It isn't okay. Piercing is not a nature of human beings.

You shouldn't be self conscious.    To have a different nose makes you unique and differentiated.    It tells people that you are you and not someone else.

S1TUEEm1aa	you need to start doing at least 10-15 minutes to notice.|`|t0mb150gaa	You probably should try going a little longer now 10-20 minutes and use a tanning cream that has a light bronzer in it and you should start seeing some results. But is also depends on your skin and how easily you tan you can talk to one of the tanning attendants next time you go they are usually very helpful with this.|`|axwdwiSuaa	it takes a little while for it to work.|`|jeYL4S5Zaa	10-15 minutes on a tanning booth should produce some results.    Start slow or you will burn|`|39pl2Dotaa	i do 15 each day and it took me a week to know the difference  it depends on your skin type   if you really wanna know put a cute sticker somewhere and every time you tan put it on the same place|`|56415cd786692379c9afc5baefcd0e37aa	You should see results in one day. SOME kind of result. And the full effects of any particular session should take about 4 days.|`|bXGgFhRjaa	There is no point in going tanning if you are only going to go for 8 minutes.

Make sure you have two sterilized PIERCING needles, probably 14g.. Corks to put on the ends of the needles, and alcohol pads to clean the outside of your lip.. But yeah, read a lot lot lot of those stories up there so you know EXACTLY what youre doing, and what not to do.. And look at the pictures to see placement, be sure to get big enough rings or studs for possible swelling you may have.. And it would probablybe better to have a friend pierce you, they could do it faster and more easily than you could..    Just dont be stupid about it, do tons and tons of research.. A lot of people on here will tell you its stupid to pierce youself but I think its ok as long as you know exactly what youre doing.. Hope everything goes well for ya!|`|1Hx7MFUvaa	Please for the love of God, do not pierce anything yourself. Specialist use hollow needles to do piercings like that. Especially in an area around your mouth, you don't want to miscalculate and hit nerves that weren't meant to be hit.  It's not like your ears that are just fleshy cartilage.  Most of the time, you're paying more for the jewelry than the actual piercing, so by the time you get the right body jewelry for an extra $15 to $20, have it done by a professional. If you want it done that bad, then wait and save up some money.|`|cJRFbZUaaa	All piercings should be done professionally.  Do not pierce yourself.  There is a chance of infection even when a professional does it (especially for people who don't follow the pro's advice).

FS9ibKB5aa	i like tongue piercings.    i think they look cool.  just because someone gets a tongue piercing does not mean you want to "give great oral sex"  that's so stupid to say that.  i've had mine done Sense i was 15.  there was nothing sexual about it at all. its only thought of that way because people have dirty minds. so if the first thing you think of when you see someone with their tongue pierced is that they must have it for sexual purposes then in my opinion you have a trashy personality.. you shouldn't have such a dirty mind.  and alot of my friends(consisting of girls and boys) feel the same way.    if you want this pierced then go for it.    im female 18 years old.|`|FNkE6UEWaa	Not.

nJtJvL7Naa	Heated eye-lash curlers keep them curled longer than regular crimpy ones.  They look scary but are totally safe....Good luck!|`|zXHNSohTaa	Like you, I also like to curl my lashes without using regular mascara (in my case, I have sensitive, watery eyes and only use black colored mascara on rare occasions).     My trick to keeping them in place is actually clear mascara, or a product like Ardell's Lash Accelerator (which is also colorless). It keeps my curl all day, even when I accidentally rub my eyes (happens a lot).    My trick is I put the clear mascara on first, letting it dry completely before using the lash curler after. That gives me maximum curl (doing it the other way round always pulls the curve out). Just be careful when you curl, it must be absolutely dry so there's no chance of a lash sticking to your appliance and getting pulled out.    Also, having a great eyelash curler makes all the difference, like the metal ones. I have tried a bunch and they're not all created equal. My favorite ones are Shu Uemura (expensive) and ELF ($1 but really works good!).    hope that helps! =)|`|Y0oIzpebaa	Keeep on curlin them.|`|MRpSUNNhaa	Eye lash curler.|`|cQNOWMktaa	Heat up an eyelash curler with a blow dryer, then curl lashes.

You can get an excellent eyelash curler for just one dollar at eyeslipsface.com or your local kmart.    =]|`|z6JocAnFaa	I had the same issue. You should try clear mascara!

It holds the curl without the spider!|`|aNjd1tM1aa	Eyelash Curlers :)|`|vTKEhO1vaa	use eyelash curlers and then coat lashes with vaseline, has the same affect as mascara and isn'tt harsh on your lashes.|`|eJbA3g4vaa	Just curl them everyday.

Y0oIzpebaa	The 30s looks were concemtrated on the eyebrows, which were plucked very thin and curved toward the temple. The lips were overdrawn on the top making the bow of the lips longer to meet the sides. This was called the rosebud mouth. The colors were rosie rouge,pink or red lips and long curled eyelashes.    The 40s have more natural eyebrows, although still manicured and arched. The shadows used were neutrals, and some jewel tones like dark blue or green for evening,  Eyelashes are curled and darkened with black mascara.  The top lip is still slightly overdrawn, but not as much as in the 30s.    Colors in the 40s are true reds, bright orange reds, dark crimson red or cherry.    Both of these looks start off with a light foundation, they liked rose or pink undertones back then, a little ghostly today, and face powder to set.    Hope this helps|`|fflPaQQyaa	If you go to Mary Kay.com you can see different techniques for your face and eye color.

I usually keep an eye out when watching tv or looking through magazines for a celebrity who has hair similar to mine then I image search them to see different ways they have their hair styled and try to copy it.|`|kgVAUIHoaa	take a little bit of your hair (in the front near your forehead), tease it, and clip it back in a little poof.     http://i245.photobucket.com/albums/gg72/...|`|Zv7sXMbTaa	i am a cosmetologist and i have jaw length hair, theres not much you can do but these are a couple things i do to make it different. i put my part in different places when i straighten it, then i also put gel or moose in my hair and scrunch it with my hand to give it a wavy look or you can curl it with a curling iron to give it a more extreme curl look. always remember to curl away from your face then towards your face. it will give you the farrah fausit look and that is always hot and fun. good luck!
wVJ4PJJXaa	It's called Puberty...the same thing happened to me.  Straight hair all through childhood and the I hit puberty and POOF curls!!  And you probably got it from your Grandmother if she has curly hair. Between straight and curly, curly is the dominant trait.
bXGgFhRjaa	It works just as well as washing your face with any normal facewash. That's why you shouldn't buy it because you have to buy new pads for it nearly every week. Stick with face wash and you will save yourself a lot of money.|`|joiacDUdaa	I would have to say "NO!" it doesn't work at all.  When it came out a while back I searched all over to get one and was so disappointed.   I finally found it at TARGET.. I did get a good deal on.. I had coupons and the 1 I found was damaged (box only) so they gave me an extra 10% off so it was under $10.. I got it home and fired it up... There's hardly any soap in the expensive little pads... So, I used some of my own soap... Also.. I had a hard time finding replacement pads which are kinda expensive... I just rinsed out the pads i had let them dry and used them with my own soap... I was pretty disappointed... I DID however, call NEUTROGENA'S 1-800 and speak with a cust. serv. rep and I was able to get my money-back.  If I want to exfoliate my face and get it squeaky clean.. I mix 1 tsp. on baking soda with my face or body soap and wash as usual.. That does the trick..    Good luck|`|JGET5ZtPaa	no, the pad thing does cleanses but if u r looking for softness or anything else i dont think it would be good for you|`|E98Ob9E6aa	yeah, well for my skin it does.. it really does depend on your skin.  like mine.. lets just say it's not very cheap to take care or my skin.... it loves the expensive stuff.. but for my skin, yeah it works really well.|`|6qPFNkyDaa	no.  it is a waste of your money.
Ir51Eb0Kaa	Trust me, go to the salon. They'll know how to fix it.|`|SYnhwUfhaa	if you hair is not naturally black you can buy something called coloropps from any drug store and after you put that in you can dye it the color you want right after.    or if you hair is naturally black you can go to a beauty store and get hair bleach but don't keep it in for too long because it damages hair!     after you bleach it may look like a weird color but the next day you can dye it the color you want =)|`|eS9nPWqBaa	It probably won't take it ALL out - because I don't know what your hair looks like and I never tried this on Permanent color.    Dishwashing liquid      Of course you have to make sure you do some conditioning after.|`|xreWOKBYaa	Well going back from black is hard. You will have to bleach it and dye it the color you want. You should go to a salon so you don't damage your hair any more then you have!|`|UZKg2odzaa	i had to get my hair professionally stripped at a salon. It took all the black out and my original color came through. after that just dye it brown.|`|AA12081834	If you used permanent dye..you are most likely going to have to let it grow out...there is the option of having your stripped, and re-dyed to your natural color...but this rarely works, and often damages your hair.|`|Pjz7gEaXaa	use clarifying shampoo that will draw the dye out, the same thing happened to one of my friends with blonde hair|`|8EaEnIUYaa	Go to a Beauty Supply store and ask for the product that strips color from out of your hair.|`|juU6nJqUaa	There is a product at Walgreens called Color Oops.  It is supposed to remove hair color.  If you used permanent color, it may be harder to remove.  Since black is the darkest, recoloring with brown won't work until you remove some of the black.|`|miNKdNauaa	There are products that lighten your hair, but it sounds like you waited too long if you have roots. Try dying your hair black again so the roots aren't showing, waiting a couple of weeks, and then use a lightening kit (sometimes you can find them at Target, but Sally Beauty Supply will have plenty of products). Then you should wait another couple of weeks before dying your hair a dark brown. Trust me, awkward hair for two weeks will be worth the wait. If you redye your hair too soon you can really, really damage it. Make sure you deep condition your hair!|`|NQuPNHPyaa	Black is the hardest to take out of your hair.. I recommend going to a salon and getting High lights to lighten it up or you could have them strip it, by doing this they will bleach your entire hair and dye it the color you want.. Either of these methods will damage your hair. I recommend Deep conditioning for a week prior to getting either one of those.|`|dibW2uNzaa	The color won't stick because you can't put a slightly lighter color on top of black.  Do not bleach it either- it will turn orange. If you cannot afford a salon, then you should call one for advice.  Tell them that you need to know a good color stripping system and ask where to find it.  Once you have stripped the color, then you can dye it brown.    Good Luck!

xreWOKBYaa	Bleeching hair that is dyed black is very damaging. I would go to a salon to get it done!|`|SYnhwUfhaa	get bleach with a 40 volume activator, it may be orange after this dye the parts you bleached blonde if it still looks a little orange you can re dye it a couple days later.|`|UZKg2odzaa	uhhh i HIGHLY recommend going to a salon. if you do it yourself, it could VERY EASILY turn orange.|`|oKEkKhd4aa	Just get a "nice and easy" highlighting kit--make sure you follow the directions, or else your hair color may get messed up|`|EZcBe3C8aa	Since your hair is so black i would recommend you going to a salon to have it done because it may turn orange.|`|gyxB0lDIaa	If your hair has color on it I don't recommend doing the highlights at all.  If it is black you will need powder bleach get basic white that is the cheapest. Also get a 40 volume developer. small size should be around 5 dollars Mix the developer withe the bleach apply to wear you like wait 10 minutes check it pull the bleach off with a wet paper towel in on of the spots if hair looks whitish take out all bleach and then put a toner on You can get the toner at sally's also it is about $340 for the cheapest it should be a level 10 plus and it should say white or platinum.  This is going to damage your hair and you also might lose some of it The bleach can take up to a half an hour and you might have to take the bleach off after 30 minutes reapply again this might go orange if it look orange after 30 minute's take off wash out and do it again with fresh product Good luck|`|gSDtwDNcaa	buy the bleaching kit....it might turn orange, but it shouldnt(my friends didnt)  id just ask the workers there bc theyd probably know better.|`|yfrZowkfaa	these days, why dosn't anybody still have their naturall hair colour?|`|Zv7sXMbTaa	the cheapest and best way to Platinum bleach your hair is with powder bleach that you add a 20 volume activator too. remember use one ounce of activator to 1 cup of bleach. if you need a little more activator bc the powder is to thick then that's fine but usually use just a drop or two more. and you should put some cotton strip between the black and blonde hair so it doesn't run on the black hair. good luck.

VMEKBGUjaa	Go for a mattifying primer (like Smashbox Photo Finish Fountation Primer from Sephora) before you apply makeup in the morning. Also, after you put on foundation, use a pressed powder.

You would put it on before your put your foundation and powder. Ones that I recommned are: Rimmel (drugstore) fix & perfect foundation primer, MAC prep & prime, Bare minerals face and eye primer kit.|`|dqdlbJMhaa	You need a really good Face Primer..

I spend so much money on under eye cream to lighten up my under eye that I never put liner under there, It's pointless.  Something cool I have been doing recently is with my MAC smudgeable black eyeliner I line the top of my eyelid after applying my shadow and I use my thin eyeliner brush to smudge the liner over the base of my eyelid.

Choose thin and intense eyeliner if you have small eyelid area. Avoid thick eyeliner for small or close-set eyes. For wide set eyes, emphasize the inner corners of the eyes. For close set eyes, emphasize the outer corners, keeping the inner corners highlighted. For drooping eyes, turn the outer end of the liner in an upward direction. Eyeliner should be applied close to the base of the eyelashes. Apply the eyeliner as close to the lash line as possible. Else you are likely to land up with a ghost line or strip of skin between your liner and lash line. This takes away from the effect of fuller lashes. It is not advisable to apply eyeliner in the rim of the eye. This would probably result in dark specks in the eye and appear unsightly. The eye is also likely to get irritated.|`|cc0dc9a4e8b57d337932a8a9f74bb700aa	i wear mine just above my eyelashes.  good luck!

Try cutting a little bit off ( and inch or two ) and add some layers. The layers will give hair more volume when curly and more sleek when straight. the highlights will make it pop. :)    answer mine?  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|LeSBrPQTaa	I would also say get layers.. Layers are a nice and very gorgeous change.. You could always dye your hair, but i think some different colour high lights would look good.. And just try to do your hair different ways.. Loose, curls, pony tale.. There is so much possibilities..!
Yc3tBWBQaa	Well i think it's fine to wash your hair every single day because otherwise it gets dirty and greasy and oily.  So keep washing it every single day.  Just was ur hair with shampoo twice and ull be fine.    it's also ok to wash ur hair everysingle day cuz guys don't have to straigheten or curl their hair after.
jVqCdOMGaa	it looks fake to mee .
UcFYEx7Yaa	Just simply lather your legs with shaving cream and then use the razor going only up (not down).  Ask your mom to do around your knees and ankles the first couple of times to avoid cuts!  It's really simple once you get the hang of it! Good Luck!|`|bEypuYJ0aa	you probably should ask your mom...it's going to be hard to read shaving instructions while in the shower/bathtub if you know what I mean. haha|`|Oti6JXJIaa	ask your mom. she will b e able to show you.|`|217f45ca54f30cb63e99ed07b568da05aa	ask your mom or older sis if u have one how to use it or ask for nair or one of those type products instead. at least with nair there is no chance of cutting yourself. good luck.|`|DKKJLJkNaa	just start from the ankle to mid calf GOING UPWARD toward the knee  and keep doing that till theres no hair dont press to hard or you can cut yuorself
uIkckb2uaa	yeah...and it is only soft and silky til you wash your hair again...only because mayo is greasy and it is hard to wash out...try VO5 hot oil...it does wonders for me!|`|h0UUG7MAaa	nope * but i'll try it baby|`|9Mr14w6Qaa	I havent ,but have had relatives who have and they said it's about the same as using a conditioner and you cant really tell the difference in the texture of your hair.Also some people put vinegar in their hair as a final rinse.You should try it sometime ,it makes the hair shiny.|`|LVO8ixtaaa	No, it just made my hair smell really bad >.  I wouldnt waste the time, I would just condition it.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	no reason -a good cut every few months & the right products will keep your hair healthy.  don't forget to eat a balanced diet & drink lotsa water.|`|LeSBrPQTaa	Ive never actually done it myself, but i saw a video wit it on youtube.. And the who did it, only ended up with greasy smelly hair.. So i wouldn't do it if i were you!|`|krrsZ8IRaa	Mayo No But If You Want Your Hair To Feel Soft And Silky Use A Deep Conditioner Or Buy Chelstrol From Sallys Beauty Supplies Or Any Other Type Of Beauty Supply Shops|`|ItJhWTCBaa	No, mayo disgusts me. I can't eat it or touch it. The smell makes me sick. I could never put it in my hair. But I have heard that it make your hair soft and silky, I'd try it, but like I said mayo makes me feel sick.|`|5c4947c68fe4a26f611efeef4df963a7aa	yeah, i have.  It does condition your hair really good....the only drawbacks are that you end up smelling like mayo and it takes a long time to get it out of your hair.  However, both problems can be solved by shampooing afterwards...
wYQefoNpaa	A short dress is perfectly appropriate for prom...this makes you think more about your body type, though, so pick one that's good for your body type, since mistakes like that will easily show in a short dress.|`|d5ug5W5kaa	short and make it cute!!|`|VjBciucZaa	i like short if its SHORT  i like long if it hides your shoes and you dont trip on em|`|HynUWGHcaa	short cocktail dress :)|`|R6Z8onywaa	short dresses are fine, if they are nice enough, luxe and incredibly well accessorized.  short dress or long dress have FUN|`|W7UpXXQGaa	i say if every one is going in a long dress go in a short be different. i had a long dress last year and this yer i think im going to try a short dress too|`|24biipOpaa	i personally dont like the very long dresses but i think prom would be a time for them.   the only kind of dress i think ppl shouldn't wear is the really short ones. my junior prom dress went a little above my knees|`|SC91Uwrhaa	Short and cute!|`|GhJ3SB0Eaa	Well, as long as the short dress is formal enough for the occasion. Dress it up a lot! Short dresses are way cuter than long, but long are classic. If you found something you like, go for it before it's all taken!|`|umRTXP2caa	prom is usually a "long dress night" but i think if you really like the dress then wear it, its your prom! I had several girls at my prom wear shorter dresses. Just make sure its up to the "fancy par" of a full length gown (ie. not a sundress or anything and not super revealing elsewhere)|`|DpGFyLFyaa	short is definitely easier to dance in =) good luck!|`|sk0pUe9Haa	ew no long! long dresses for prom are so outdated!  everyone wears short dresses to my prom  you should too  and they are way easier to dance in!|`|9nYtZ4Tfaa	the only reason you should wear a short dress to prom is if you are an underclassman    but prom is supposed to be your night   so wear whatever you feel most comfortable and pretty in.|`|Gxkv6iQdaa	i think short dresses are pretty. :)|`|IPlpc9lBaa	i like short dresses but that sound cute|`|OzYt1tFRaa	its fine  have fun =}

ir6DavGVaa	I'm glad to see that you want to enhance your natural beauty- that is such a wonderful thing! I actually teach the Art of Beauty at the local university in downtown Illionis, and these are my  4 easy tricks to looking as beautiful as you can be! THINK PACA!    POSTURE Believe it or not, posture is an essential in looking beautiful and can tell people a lot about how you carry yourself. Do you hold up your head high or have your eyes facing the ground? Do you keep your back straight or shoulders schlumped? By practicing good posture, you look can look longer and leaner and more confident. To practice this, focus on making eye contact with people, walking with a ballarina's poise (like a string is attached to your head) and keeping your shoulders down and head up! easy I know, but completely necessary.  ATTITUDE for a lot of people, attitude is everything. unless you are one of those girls that keeps a stoic expression 24/7. if you don't, it's pretty easy to read one's experession. As you are probably well aware of, a radiant smile and glowing face reads HAPPY AND HEALTHY. A furrowed brow can read, I'M CONCENTRATING. An upturned mouth, I"M SAD. PLEASE LEAVE ME ALONE. you get the picture! believe it or not, facial expressions are your body's way of letting the world around you how you are feeling- it's natural! make sure to keep an optimistic attitude as much as you can, to be thankful for what you have, and to smile as much as humanly possible! It will read on your face, I promise!   CONFIDENCE Are you a confident person? Do you truly think you're semipretty or beautiful? Bodybashing is such a horrible thing that many girls are a victim of. Try to say, I AM BEAUTIFUL as many times as possible. When you are happy with the person you are, even if that means tweaking a few things and there, than it will read to the world around you! Good luck!  APPEARANCE Ah appearance. Such a fun thing to write about and discuss! Because I don't know what you look like, I can not give you specific fashion and beauty tips, but I will tell you these 3 small tips that will get you far. KEEP IT SIMPLE. WORK WITH WHAT YOU HAVE. THINKING BEAUTIFUL=BEING BEAUTIFUL. I recently conducted a survey asking 150 men whether they thought that natural makeup is better that being "all glammed up". The results were unanimous, nearly 80% of them though going au naturale was better! I would recommend that you wear a hairstyle that accentuates what you already have. Do you have a round face? Try an angled bob that will help frame it. Tan skin? If you are thinking about coloring your hair, always go for darker undertones, and stay away from bleach blonde. If you want to change up you look think about your skintone, body type, eye color, heritage and what you already have. Seventeen magazine has great advice on what to wear for your bodytype. As for springtrends, try neon colors, slouchy casual pieces like cargo pants or neutral vests, mexican inspired prints and bright florals. Shop for clothes that work for YOUR bodytype and your personal style. As Heidi Klum says, "Style is knowing who you are and what you want to say." Embrace that! Looking through magazines or looking at the runway fashions and listening to your gut instincts and discovering what you love is the best foolproof advice I can give you on how to find your style. Oh and, a great pair of heels makes you feel confident, sexy and oh course, BEAUTIFUL! Classic items like a great pair of jeans (bootcut, skinny, baggy, whatever you like the best), a denim or leather jacket, white buttondown shirts, red lipstick, the little black dress...always makes people look beautiful. not only are they classic, they're classy!     Good luck on your road to being as beautiful as you can be!     Remember you are amazing, and just let your dreams take flight and watch them soar!   Peace,   Olivia!|`|FsgZROJDaa	Confidence, confidence , confidence!! if you have this people will just naturally want to be around you. but not in a stuck up kind of way. also be warm, friendly, sincere, just be yourself.|`|d32c352c319a234b2b8f9e99c19cf80eaa	small to medium sized Hoop earrings  and a little lipstick is really all any gal needs.

770c4d6b69045531ce68bc63c97f8ba4aa	well there's nothin wrong with going natural. but if he perms u get are leaving scabs in ur hair u shud try another perm. and make sure u get the regualar type. and if u want to go natural i say go girl!!!. but i think u shud buy aphogee hair products. they really help!!
PKe5F82jaa	I wouldn't advise you on buying a already pre selected make-up kit.     You need to play with products,textures colours etc to see what you like using.    I've been a makeup artist for a good few years now and I have hundreds of items from diffrent companys.. I know what works well for what...Also are you planing on wokring in film/tv..Fashion..Theatre?    Since all these would require very diffrent product...      I swear by Mac foundations- Face and Body & New one Sculpt  (Widely used in the fashion industry)    Also some mac mineralize skin finisher on top works beautifuly.    Concealers Make-up Forever do lolvey palltes (Which you can buy at 'PAM' Sheperds bush' )     For blushers for as a good start is the Ben Nye blusher palette from Screenface In Covernt Garden.    I love Le Masqua Lip glosses especialy the black one.     Charles Fox do Great Lipstick palttes for a starter kit but I would recomend lip mixers from Mac Pro store from which you can mix any colour and they look beautiful...      I could go on forever..If you need any more help..|`|KGToyCnqaa	this isnt a full make up kit because it will be very difficult to find one with everything!!   type in to ebay: pro pallette  it is basically a pallette with like 50 eyeshadows in all diff colours and theyre good for blending and different effects! its quite good!! and its good quality. just check out feedback before you buy. xxx|`|db1dgMzpaa	theres a shop and website called screenface thats probably a good starting point

TOAFYeOTaa	i've tried so many different products from neutrogena, clean and clear, st. ives, olay, etc. and none of the worked! i wouldnt think so i havent tried that one, but i dont think anything that you can buy from a store works.........next im gona try proactiv.........mayb u should try an acne system|`|JGET5ZtPaa	the neutrogena wave is just a waste of money... buying new pads when u run out... and it only clesns it as well as u do with your own stuff... dont worry, they'll have to go away eventually!
isnHOG0Waa	This is mine. I wake up at 5 and go at 7 Just try it out, It helps me a lot:    -Wake up at 5 and set alarm clock at snooze for about 10 minutes.     -Put on music. very important. it helps me get up and go.

AA10077147	That's a good moisturizer to use on your body, but the skin on your face is a lot more delicate. A good moisturizer for your face will say " oil-free, non-comodogenic, &/or irritant-free" on the back.

El trmino no est reconocido por la RAE. Se trata de un sustantivo, aunque en ocasiones se emplea como adjetivo pese a que en principio no lo sea.    Se ha afirmado que el trmino puede ser una contraccin de Totonaca, aunque en realidad se refiere a la palabra en idioma nhuatl "Nacohatl", que significa "de aqu" y designaba las personas originarias de un lugar: Huixquilpan Nacotl significa De Huixquilpan.    En tiempos contemporneos, esta palabra tiene un significado un poco ambiguo y confuso. En general se ha utilizado esta palabra en forma despectiva para se?alar a las personas indgenas. Con carcter ms amplio, en la sociedad mexicana se emplea el trmino en relacin a las posiciones sociales o cualquier otro crculo, y se utiliza con el fin despectivo de se?alar a una persona que es diferente de otros o con un punto de vista peculiar. Tambin puede hacer referencia a las personas de bajo nivel adquisitivo, y por extensin a toda persona que viva en una colonia de nivel bajo a medio.    Recientemente se les llama "nacos" a la gente con una escasa cultura aparente, que no corresponde con la urbanidad de las clases altas. Personas pertenecientes a esta clase alta mexicana usan este adjetivo en relacin a aquellos que no concuerdan con su manera de convivir, ser o estar; o no siguen determinadas modas o hbitos de conducta, incluyendo modos de vestir o de hablar.|`|a251586e037245994606813066cddd25aa	una persona sin educacion o q la tiene y quiere parecerse a otra.....Aburrrrrrrrrrrr|`|4f6066ab5aec2d782820f27feb1b61abaa	Para mi llamar a alguien NACO, es por ejemplo el que tira la basura en plena calle, el que le grita a las mujeres cosas obscenas, el que su educacin esta por los suelos, su cultura, etc... y al que escribe : Mas sin embargo, que es una frase que no se puede decir porque no existe. otra nacada es el que dice, primero que nada, primero que nada? antes de la nada, no hay nada. esos son los NACOS para mi.

7Wu2RQVraa	a kabuki might is fine if your experienced but if you are just a beginner use a  blush brush b/c you can really over do it with a kabuki brush    on the other hand  a kabuki is versatile it is  a really good blending brush and powder foundation brush|`|vwu6PU4eaa	kabuki!|`|Hm5SCDv4aa	Well, they would both work pretty well.  The kabuki brush might be a bit easier to blend the color out though.  The only real difference is that one has a short handle and one is long, and they have different densities.  If you want my opinion though, I would get a normal powder brush.  It has a long handle like a blush brush, but it's denser like a kabuki.  So go with either a kabuki or normal powder brush ;]|`|wH9EdF7naa	a kabuki brush is more for all over powder, id recommend an actual blush brush. the difference is that a kabuki's handle is very small if it even has any, besides that the hairs are packed very tightly and its a lot bigger.    a blush brush is smaller, cuz u dont want to have blush all over the sides of ur faces. besides that the hairs arent packed as tightly, which allows for easier blending. furthermore, a blush brush would usually have a long handle.

It's horrible, whoa you must really not pay attention in class.|`|C8zrNMRjaa	well .. are you for it or not ?  we cant tell you what your opinion is ?|`|d1898a9afeea054b1cb7f52aaecb9d73aa	Thank god you were lying.  Did catch my attention, I wanted to start yelling!    You ask for a scientific answer, but really the question is leaning towards an opinionated answer.  We all know the effects of global warming, to name a few:  5. Spread of disease  As northern countries warm, disease carrying insects migrate north, bringing plague and disease with them. Indeed some scientists believe that in some countries thanks to global warming, malaria has not been fully eradicated.  4. Warmer waters and more hurricanes  As the temperature of oceans rises, so will the probability of more frequent and stronger hurricanes. We saw in this in 2004 and 2005.  3. Increased probability and intensity of droughts and heat waves  Although some areas of Earth will become wetter due to global warming, other areas will suffer serious droughts and heat waves.  2. Economic consequences  Hurricanes cause do billions of dollars in damage, diseases cost money to treat and control and conflicts exacerbate all of these.  1. Polar ice caps melting  The ice caps melting is a four-pronged danger.  a) First, it will raise sea levels. There are 5,773,000 cubic miles of water in ice caps, glaciers, and permanent snow. According to the National Snow and Ice Data Center, if all glaciers melted today the seas would rise about 230 feet.  b) Second, melting ice caps will throw the global ecosystem out of balance.   c) Third, temperature rises and changing landscapes in the artic circle will endanger several species of animals. Only the most adaptable will survive.  d) Fourth, global warming could snowball with the ice caps gone. Ice caps are white, and reflect sunlight, much of which is relected back into space, further cooling Earth. If the ice caps melt, the only reflector is the ocean. Darker colors absorb sunlight, further warming the Earth.    All of these points are internationally known issues, or at least they should be by now.  They should be common knowledge.  So is it more important to care, or is it more important not to care?    It's up to you at the end of the day.    Now the real question here is if you're "for" global warming, doesn't that mean that you'd like it to happen?  The previous notes indicated global warming = bad; pro-activeness = good in prevention of global warming...    I don't tell people what to do, but if I were to suggest anything, perhaps the question is somewhat of a trick question - I, myself, would say I am "anti-global warming".  Don't want it to happen.    But at the end of the day and truth be told - I don't really give a **** what happens to this planet... :P  sorry!    and sorry about the length...|`|FS9ibKB5aa	anti|`|mnXxJtqmaa	ANTI GLOBAL WARMING `MISS`|`|x9I80klvaa	You are fugly.|`|gSDtwDNcaa	Your against it b/c u love those cute polar bears that are going to become extinct from it.

Your opinion will not change anything.    Neither will mine, but here it is anyway:    The clearest evidence for global warming is seen at the poles.  Sea ice is melting faster than it's forming near the North Pole, and huge chunks are cracking off the ice shelves around Antarctica.     In her famous book, "The Sea Around Us", Rachel Carson wrote about the 1400-year climate cycle we seem to have.  Back around the year 700, Norse explorers arrived in Iceland and Greenland, and found the climate warm enough to support colonies and farms.  Over the next few centuries, the climate got colder and the farms had to be abandoned.  By 1400 or so, it was so cold in northern Europe that things froze that had never frozen before.  Now we are approaching the high point of the climate cycle once again.  It will probably get warmer for the next hundred years at least.    On top of this cycle are the activities of human beings.  As we generate heat by running industries, cars, and homes, it goes into the atmosphere.  Environmentalists plead for us to use less energy, but any effective worldwide change is quite unlikely.      It would be better for us all to plan for a warmer world, move away from areas likely to be flooded, and figure out ways to adapt to a changing climate.

iwSRIIf9aa	I'm assuming you're referring to the classic 1950's pinup look, which is light, lined eyes with deep crimson lips and porcelain skin.  To get the eye look, apply an eyelid primer and then apply a matte taupe or tan shadow all over your lid.  Take a black liquid eyeliner, and draw a super thin line as close to your lashes as possible, beginning at the outer corner and working your way in.  The line should start thicker and gradually get thinner as you work your way in.  To finish the liner, sweep the outer corner out and up to get the signature cat eye look.  Apply 1-2 coats of a lengthening mascara (not volumizing-the look was long lashes).  Do your brows next-fill in any sparse areas with a shade of shadow one shade lighter than your hair color.  Take a bright, shimmery white shadow and apply it to your browbone and inner corner of your eye.  Keep your skin simple-foundation and a small amount of blush.  Line your lips with a deep red or plum liner and fill your lips in with lipstick-using a lip brush makes this easier.  Good luck!|`|wH9EdF7naa	do a light taupe eyeshadow all over the lid, and define the crease with a brown eyeshadow. then highlight browbone with a very light white eyeshadow. make sure all shadows are matte, as that was the style. u then apply liquid liner, and tonnes of it, winging it far out. u can chose to go for the innocent 50s loook by lining the inner rim of ur eye with white liner. to finish off the look, wear false lashes, and/or a ton of mascara!    finally u can finish off the look by applying a rosy pink blush and matte BRIGHT red lips!     think christina aguilera and gwen stefani!!|`|YZokRYWcaa	describe it more in detail for us? there were a few|`|aecb87753b7a91041ba0f8e18327da41aa	lots lots lots of mascara  blue eye shadow or a color very close to your skin tone  thin arched eyebrows  no liner

i38Ev1Zaaa	Apply a liberal amount of mousse into your hair, then blowdry it until its dry. Depending on how long your hair is, a handful should be fine.     Once your hair is dry, brush it again and get yourself a 1 1/2 inch curling iron. If you don't have one yet, i highly recommend a hot tools:  http://www.folica.com/Hot_Tools_Profe_d1...    if you want tighter waves, you can also use a 1 1/4 inch iron.    Clip your hair up into sections, then curl your hair in 1 inch sections, in a spiral motion. Hold the iron in place until the outermost layer of your hair is warm, then let go and repeat.    once your whole head is finished, finish off with a bit of hairsrpay, then let it cool.    Your curls should be a little bit tighter than what you want them intially. just grab a little bit of gel and rub it inbetween your palms, then run your fingers through yoru curls genly, this should loosen them up a bit.    If your on a budget, these are some GREAT hair products to use with this look:  Garnier Fructis CURL CONSTRUCT mousse  Suave RAVE hairspray    good luck!|`|2ucsbBGjaa	if your hair is naturally curly, I use aussie moose plus leave in conditioner and I just use a little.

dni52yg3aa	If you want to flirt, try talking to him. Have a 'pretend argument' with a friend. For example, say, "Who do you think would win a fight: Ryan Sea crest or Simon Co well?" Pick who your friend doesn't pick, then say like, "Fine, let me ask someone else. Ryan, who you think would win in a fight: Ryan or Simon?" I did it in 5th grade and it worked. :) You could ask try catching his eye in class, smiling, then looking away like you're happy-embarrassed. :) Also, since V-Day is coming up, you could get him a little valentine and some candy or something. :) Good luck!  And happy friends: I think it's okay to wear makeup, as long as it's not too much. Like maybe some mascara and nude lip gloss. My younger sister (I absolutely can't stand her) hangs out with these...

6RqjxUTnaa	You may have heard that vinegar can be used to clarify and condition hair. It is also a popular ingredient used to lighten hair at home. You don't need expensive salon coloring to achieve a lighter and brighter shade of hair when you can do it easily and inexpensively with vinegar.      Rinse your hair with vinegar before you shampoo it. The vinegar will help remove buildup from styling products and will also impart a natural shine to it.    Use white vinegar to bring out blond highlights and lighten your hair. Apple cider vinegar will bring out auburn tones.     Mix one part vinegar and one part lemon juice in a spray bottle. For highlighted streaks, pull out sections of your hair and spray with the mixture. For all-over lightening and brightening, saturate all of your hair. Leave on 10 minutes or longer. To enhance the mixture's effects, sit outside in the sun.     Rinse your hair with vinegar as often as you like, depending on your hair's condition. Many people can use the rinse up to three times per week, while some people should only use it once a week. Know your hair--for most people, vinegar adds softness and shine.     Let the vinegar stay in your hair for 10 to 20 minutes to further lighten your hair if you have time. Then rinse it out with warm water. The vinegar smell should evaporate as your hair dries.     Mix 1/2 cup vinegar and 1/2 cup soy sauce to add subtle coloring to dark hair. Use as a rinse after shampooing just as you would with a plain vinegar rinse.     The only other thing is to Save your money|`|2vyT8Zoraa	box color doesn't always suck if you use the correct one i do hair and when i do my own i always do box color get a box of nice and easy color 102 light ash blonde it will take the orange and reds out and give you a beatiful blonde|`|33l3blvsaa	im sorry but your wright!! box dye suxs bum!!!..    use purple shampoo?? or you could get sum cool stuff off ebay like salon bleech for real cheap!!!    xx|`|256cVXsmaa	You seriously shut down all the options lol?

They may help in lightning freckles if they are applied consistently over a period of months. Cryosurgery: A light freeze with liquid nitrogen can be used to treat freckles. Chemical Peels: Chemical peels are used to remove age spots, freckles, discoloration, wrinkles and fine lines. They generally help to make the skin smooth and firm and also help in curing freckles gradually.   The most effective freckle removal method is freckle laser removal. There are a number of available laser treatments that are safe. A laser projects an intense light on the area that is affected, causing the light to be absorbed by the oxyhemoglobin and melanin so that the darker cells are destroyed and the healthy cells are left in tact. Your will need to protect your eyes from the intense light by wearing goggles. The light is directed using a very thin piece of equipment.        this is some indian aurvedya cure i am telling u--  Onions are useful in curing freckles and age spots. Take a red onion and slice it. Rub on the spots twice daily to make them vanish quickly.    Warm some honey mildly. Apply to the affected areas and tap with the finger tips. Once the honey is dried into the skin, wash it out with some warm water, and then rinse the face completely with cold water.    Sour milk is another useful remedy. Wash the face with sour milk daily. The lactic acid in the milk promotes peeling of the skin gently while ensuring there is no irrtiation or dryness.    Applying Vitamin E oil or odourless castor oil before sleeping at night helps freckles vanish.    Apply a mixture of ground yellow mustard in milk at night before sleeping. Wash out first thing in the morning with cold water.    The regular use of fruit peels and juices like cucumber, apricot, strawberry and currants on the face will help lighten the skin and fade freckles out effectively.    Lemon juice has been known to be the best remedy. Tried and tested, it can never fail you. Application of fresh lemon juice on the affected areas will help lighten the skin and cause freckles to disappear the quickest.    Apply some sour cream of the face. Make sure you do not wash it out completely. Instead, use a soft tissue to wipe it off. Top it with a mild moisturiser.

ggcS6JnFaa	Whoever says you're nasty is a jerk, first off.  But as for piercings, I'd say either the septum or vertical labret.  But I think that an Ashley would look really great on you as well:  http://wiki.bmezine.com/index.php/Ashley...    You have a good face for piercings!  I'm not too fond of bridges, though.  But I think pretty much anything else would look nice. :]|`|Ciizvi3daa	I think vertical labrets are amazing and really cool. But I also think any piercings on the lips are cool.     I bet a vertical labrets would look wicked on you.|`|2vyT8Zoraa	i think you should go with the septum because then you can flip it up if you go for a job interview or such|`|iBjQR2iBaa	i personally think the coolest piercing woul be snake bites or spider bites on your uper lip btw awesomme joker shirt :)|`|gSDtwDNcaa	get a madonna(if that's what u call it) u know the one amy winehouse has? thats the first peircing i thought of when i saw ur pic.|`|8fe960abd1f73651086929a6f1d5b447aa	vertical labrets are awesome. and if you're already getting your nostril redone then the bridge or septum might just make your nose look too crowded
laAZbxNVaa	me too, only my hair isnt super wavy.     I use Pantene Clairifying Shampoo. Then Pantene Ice Shine Conditioner. Sometimes I use sunsilk, and they have certain shapoos for different hairstyles.     Suave Clarifying Shampoo is also great, and it smells good.     For products after you shower, Frizz-ease Secret Weapon tames hair and gives it the perfect finished look.     I also go to the Body Shop and get their olive shine conditioner, its amazing.|`|DKKJLJkNaa	my hairs the same..heres what to do     buy hair caps  rub conditner in damp hair at night  sleep with the conditioned damp hair in the hair cap    in the morning rinse out the conditner make three sepeprate braids one on the left of your head one on the right and one on the back  blow dry your hair while still in the braids when the outer layer of the braids are dry undo the braids and let the rest dry naturally...AND THATS IT!...it works i sware! and plus your hair will feel so smooth! (=  good luck   vote me best answer|`|xYacZrTLaa	a long time ago i got a perm and i had come to realize that i didnt like it as much as i thought i did and i saw this straitner that only cost $20.00 and its called wet to straight and i was set for life|`|bEypuYJ0aa	I had the exact same problem.  I got some straightening heat protective gel, which straightens your hair if you put a little dab in wet or damp hair and brush it and then let it dry naturally.  You might have to do a little bit of straightening after that, & if you do I suggest getting a wet-to-dry hair straightener like the conair infiniti.  It saves LOTS of time.  I use just regular Aussie Moist hair shampoo and conditioner, and strangely it worked wonders for my dry, frizzy hair.  Hope that helps.|`|u8xyue3taa	hair spray it.  or perm it again. perming against curly hair cancel eachother out and make it straight.  curly + curly = straight :)

It is totally kuh-ute.|`|qfSKgxDsaa	You'll have to have someone help you with this, but it's really cute:  wash and dry your hair; straighten it to get some more length out of it.  You'll flip your head/hair over and have someone french braid your hair starting at the BASE of your neck,  (the opposite of how you would normally braid) then have them stop and secure it with 1-2 thick pony tail holders.  You can stand up at this time.  Then with the rest of your hair you will curl in very tight curls with a curling iron.  Turn it up on a high (hot) setting, and hold it in the curl position for a while then do that for the remainder of the hair.  Everytime you get done with one curl just smoother it with hair spray.  When you are done, spray it again as a whole, including the back braid.  You can add some gel or mouse BEFORE you do the braid if you think it'll be prone to fall out.  And there you have a beautiful and totally not expensive hair style!|`|KfA86moYaa	Someone said you should do your hair like Taylor Swift in her Love Story music video.  I agree.  It's really cute.|`|jdeL3txxaa	bun or make a curly bun that rotates around the back|`|Z533l22Paa	How about getting your hair like professionally straightened then curled into barrel curls?? :)) that would be pretty cute.|`|0pY9smlqaa	put it up in a princess bun like Taylor Sift did for her music video, Love Story|`|LeZb79X6aa	Maybe a bun like cinderella.

d5065693519b5b048f87de49a76bf961aa	I've had incredible results massaging with natural oils. It quickly and permanently got rid of my pimples, blackheads, and even scars and reduced over large pores and I now have a totally blemish free, tight, healthy and younger looking  skin. Also gives skin a healthy glow. Olive oil is excellent as is castor, grape seed and almond. All have been used by skin specialists to treat and permanently cure acne. They also inhibit skin's oil production. The secret is to massage over and over quite vigorously. Will almost immediately start healing and in one or two days you will see marked improvements. Sometimes the massage might force poisons to be expelled. If so stop and resume when you can.  It's best to massage with a forward and back motion using finger tips and front and sides of fingers depending where on face you massage. Try to do 30 minutes a day(can be two 15 min sessions) for best and quickest results. When skin has completely cleared you only need to massage occasionally to keep it that way. For precise massage instructions research my many B.A.    SOURCE(S): 20 + years research, experimentation - safe natural treatments/cures for skin conditions and anti aging/rejuvenation treatments|`|Y0O6971laa	I heard witch hazel is good.  I wanna try it because I'm with you.  Mine isn't nad, but nothing works :(|`|YwHl37Hgaa	If you have an oily skin wash your face twice a day in warm salty water. This should leave your face oil free without aggravating the pimples like soap.The secret of keeping the skin clear is to keep it oil-free and clean. If you have a dry skin honey is a great remedy for acne and pimples because the honey kills bacteria. If you have a combination skin when you wash your face, use sugar to scrub it, at least once a day, for two weeks to rid yourself of acne.Try  http://solutionsforpimples.blogspot.com/ for more info.|`|AA10921399	well my mom is a cosmetic doctor and she has her own salon in EUROPE she make all the masks organic from real organic fruits veggies e.c.t.   _ every day put lemon on your face the juice just massage is around ur face for about a week. this will make ur face more fresh and smooth and it will dry or acne .  _ after that week;; put honey and cinnamon in a bowl n stir till its kindof hard make sure 2 put more cinnamon than honey it should look like a paste / put all over ur face or only where u have pimples.  _ then after that ur face will look amazing trust me i did it my sister 2 and i told all my friends ,   - after that u could-put a slice of tomato on ur face n rub it. leave it for 20-30 minutes. u could do that 2X a week.|`|S730dpLfaa	l h, I could finally find a solution for this problem,read this blog before taking any action  http://finallyigotridofacne.wordpress.co...

The only time I had a real remedy is when I went to the dermatologist, too much moola and so I don't go anymore.    But right now it's pretty good.    I use Dial bar soap, anything anti bacterial works.  But that is what's working for me.    If it feels dry I use a light oil free moisturizer, cuz if it gets too dry my skin gets more oily.      So when it gets more dry too, I just rinse it with cold water to tighten the pores and feel NOT dirty.      good luck|`|iKbNyYvsaa	By medicine at drug store maybe walgreen or exccerd|`|4eBtqOE4aa	A healthy diet and daily cleansing of your face.|`|pHWUrAEwaa	The ocean.

Firstly, don't panic.  You don't say how old you are but I suspect you are young.  Skin is being replenished every day and skin conditions take time to heal.  That being said, 3 months is a long time to wait for your skin to get back to the same condition before the outbreak.      This may be a situation where a LITTLE sun (about 20 minutes a day) could be good for your skin, so lay off the foundation/sunscreen for a while.  Look at your diet, and consider cutting out all processed foods.  Eat more oily fish, or foods that contain a high level of Omega 3 and 6 oils, these are great for your skin.    If you can afford it, go to your doctor and get him/her to refer you to a skin specialist.  Unless and until someone examines your skin, you can't be sure if it's something simple like an allergy to make up, for instance.  They will know the best treatments for it.  However, if you are not happy taking pills for it, don't, as these things often have nasty side effects.      In the meantime, put some oatmeal in a muslin bag and throw it into your bath.  It turns the water milky and leaves your skin feeling really soft.  Use olive oil as a cleanser (it even removes waterproof mascara) and cold water as a toner.  Go to the health food shop and buy Bio oil, that stuff works wonders, and use it as a moisturiser.  Look after yourself, eat plenty of fruit and veg, lean meat and pulses.      Good luck and I hope you heal up soon.|`|PPaBFIpGaa	I personally have never had an outbreak, but I can give you advice on how to help your skin stay looking great. I've had a lot of experience in this area because I used to be obsessed in keeping my facial skin clean...so I researched and experimented alot; I've never worn makeup, as I think that any type of makeup can and will clog your pores, contributing to breakouts and acne. The webpage below might be of great help to you, especially if you want to keep your skin healthy in the long run. Remember, though, that your skin always needs to be moisturized...you don't have to use any lotions to keep it that way. Drink plenty of water (and not caffeinated products).
4lqwMnhJaa	5 lashes? hmm... that's not too good.  it's okay if you lose 2-3 eyelashes but more than that isn't healthy.  try not using mascara for a little bit because the mascara you use might be affecting your eyelashes.    it's untrue that you lose all your eyelashes if you use mascara though.|`|h0UUG7MAaa	i think it's normal  but if it gets REALLY BAD   go to a doctor|`|UtYOwE4Laa	yep it's just like loosing dry skin.|`|QlJje9iAaa	That's normal.|`|4E14gkmKaa	yep ur fine|`|XHvaws8baa	well use a different mascara then|`|h8VymQlTaa	Yeah well lay off mascara for a while. but it is normal we get new eyelashes every 6 months

Ps: you have really pretty hair by the way|`|FeOosZzAaa	You can't go wrong with layers! =)|`|7pEjJztCaa	layers|`|C8zrNMRjaa	deff get the layers !|`|Ul1OCP8Iaa	There is an all-around layered look that I do for my own hair. It looks like this: http://www.cobella.com/images/fusion/Pro...    except my bangs are shorter... about to the end of my nose. We part our hair the same way too, so I think it would look really nice on you!|`|Pjz7gEaXaa	I think layers with side bangs sounds awesome just make sure your shortest layer can fit into a ponytail if you sometimes wear one now.|`|iKbNyYvsaa	cann;t see ya face . Just go to the shop and ask what is the best style for me|`|11484345e018548442d157d8ba15443daa	ask your hairdresser what would look best they can give u better advice than other people because they were trained|`|8vIh7iewaa	Okay so let me break it down..  get shorter bbangs that go more over your face.  cut your hair in layers but actually only two.  also, if you can get like bblondish brownish streaks..  and if you do all this youll look good.

cRN6TRVPaa	St.tropez is brill, doesnt really smell, and lasts a long time with a lovely colour that doesnt streak.    But its pricey.     Loreal is also good, but does smell.   Just try a few different ones, because  they all work different on differnt skin types, and it depends on your colour, how much colour you want ect.|`|8x1m3T5Taa	they have tanning salons|`|yoM5iFDpaa	The best is a spray tan but if you want to be doing it on a regular basis i can recommend a few. It might be hard since im in Australia. Sugar Baby Mousse is good. Garnier Solar i think its called both in spray and Gel, Ella Bache.
0qz3PHYZaa	Trust Me ! Curly Hair Is Unique ! Not Every Girl Can Get Naturally Curly Hair ! BUT Every girl Can Have Straight Hair ! Is Just You Have To Understand You Curly Hair You Have To Take Care Of  IT !|`|OURQpf7Baa	I have the same problem!  My hair is very stubborn, and often does not like to cooperate.  Instead of taking showers at night take them during the day, and brush as much as possible.  Also blow drying your hair with a brush works.  But ultimately nothing works better than using a straightener:(|`|jWW5tZnqaa	I have really curley hair and sometimes I just wash it, then blowdry it, but I put some straightening products in my hair while its still wet. I usually use the ones that protect your hair from damage from the heat of the dryer. I use like a rounded brush, and blowdry it straight. It doesnt always stay perfect, but it gets your hair straight without using a straightener.|`|aU32ilTwaa	You can use straightening shampoo, conditioner then apply straightening balm on your hair after towel drying there are plenty of products to help straighten in most good ranges.     Then use the direct nossle on your hair dryer and blow dry it down wards straight.    But if your hair is really curly it will only do so much. You probably will need to use straighteners. Don't worry about heat, heat protection sprays should protect your hair.|`|WgKqU4dIaa	It usually doesn't work but you can get shampoo and conditioner straighting stuff but you can try.|`|2gz6XIIpaa	My aunt told me about this stuff that will make your hair straight. (I also have very curly hair). Her friend got it done and it didn't work her hair is still curly so I would just straighten it.|`|qt7QcmtPaa	Well when you get out of the shower blow dry you hair right away. Keep brushing you hair while your blow drying it. It doesnt stay permanetly but it does help.|`|Pjz7gEaXaa	Awwe I love curly hair, you should get a temporary straightener that you can use some mornings when you style your hair and still have it curly other days

52325127db3c27c578489d8c6dece04aaa	Oil of Olay is the best self tanner I've ever used! It doesn't streak because it is a gradual tanner that you apply every night. They even have one that smells like lavender which helps you sleep. It looks very natural and doesn't come off on your clothes or anything. Hope this helps!|`|rHKW1CJJaa	Alba Botanica if you can find it or hawaiian tropic|`|0oM61Epqaa	none!!! go lay out in the sun!!! natural tans are always the best :)....but you could try neutrogena spray mist stuff i used it once...i still say natural is the best tho|`|oM6Pem1Waa	oil and Olay|`|TOAFYeOTaa	st. tropez tinted self tanning lotion or neutrogena micro mist self tanner|`|5qRCSkDyaa	Dove summer glow moisturiser-  If you make sure you layer a couple of times and rub in skin completely works a treat!|`|4oqFIfVqaa	hemp!!!
v0tIMAEnaa	well u should start with adding mascara  btw ur pretty  and tie ur hair up  u can come to michal chrisrophers  or someting  is that last pic really u???  and finally  kayla is a pretty name  how many times do i have to tell you  and you can go to the store habatat  in granite ruin mall  for hippie stuff|`|3Iei4h0Taa	your hair looks really great curly, and you should definitely  keep your eyes brown it's just you. for your makeup you should go to Wal-Mart and get the eye smart shades. they have personalized kits for your specific eye shade, and the kits work great! best of all they are under $20 so you can look good and not have to pay hollywood prices for it. but you are a very pretty girl and i think you should stay the way you are.|`|256cVXsmaa	Wow you need to be happy with who you are naturally.  You basically want to change just about everything.  Please be confident with yourself, don't change your eye color, your name, your hair. You even had to explain to us that you aren't fat.  You don't need to change anything about yourself except your terrible self esteem issues.  Your beautiful so stop that nonsense    EDIT: wow I actually went through your pics one more time and I wanted to add in once again that you are absolutely gorgeous and very naturally beautiful!|`|9CYpX1J8aa	omg ur hair and nose r sooo cute!!|`|rKFspUFvaa	I don't think you should change anything, you're very pretty !|`|nTb2rELWaa	Umm first off, why change your name? Kayla sounds really chill and relaxed like your style. Make me think of a breeze or something.    Try shopping at Urban Outfitters of American Eagle. You can also try Quitflight, they have some cute stuff. But if you want a really specific article of clothing, try going to Forever 21. If you take time and look through all the racks, I garuntee you'll find a key item/    There is one store you might really like though, it's called Zara. Reaaaalllly neat stuff. It's really cutting edge boho kinda. They have a lot of cool little flowy dresses and stuff. Check it out sometime.|`|QlJje9iAaa	Don't change a thing.
9yMRbtK5aa	hell no. i hate them on males.   i think that boys who wear skinny jeans are either gay, or think they're too cool for regular jeans.   but maybe i'm a little bit biased because i live in a blue-collared place where not a lot of people wear skinny jeans.|`|VrjF986Aaa	geez I think this and "do you like uggs" gets asked like 500,000 times a day|`|b9MSOr6laa	NO!|`|5JbARGHraa	If they are not too skinny then yes. But skin tight like girls jeans makes them look gay!  Medical Records  Sac State|`|WIAKYua5aa	maybe|`|l5Q8lq35aa	I think they look OK on males, but it's not attractive at all.   Examples of jeans I hate on a guy:  http://lifeinservice.files.wordpress.com...    http://oak.conncoll.edu/mswer/images/ski...    http://www.monkeegenes.co.uk/Images/gree...    http://www.anonymousvenice.com/store/ima...    They're so unoriginal and unflattering for EVERY body type.      Examples of jeans that look hot, yet nice and handsome on a guy:  http://www.denimology.co.uk/2007/10/ze3....  (And no, I'm not a screaming Zac fan)        So basically, most girls like them skinny but baggy.|`|VXctsSgXaa	ewww no!|`|O27yDj06aa	yesssss, theyre gorgeous:)|`|LeSBrPQTaa	Depends on the guy, if his legs are like chicken legs, then no! If he have good legs, then yes. It can look good.|`|OzBHZ64jaa	no. but i also don't like baggy gansta jeans either.   i need a happy medium. (:|`|c802256cb0cecca93786efd301cd0ea4aa	Yeah, I like em. I'm 13, no job.  I think their good looking if you have the body, and don't wear girls jeans when your a man.|`|sZsqVmyBaa	depends how they are worn|`|XAIurFZnaa	Not unless they are worn nicely, but mostly, noooo.|`|E98Ob9E6aa	YEASH!!!      only if the guy is like emo.          and i'm 13 sts. peter and paul school,, i'mgoing to brebeuf next year...      I'M GOING TO MISSS YOU GALES        sorry  :(|`|Cc3rFatJaa	Depends.|`|972LCOk4aa	HOT BABE,  HOTTTTTT!!!!|`|ZooNlo77aa	Absolutely yes. As long as they're not tighter on him than my pants are on me. Haha.    Not doing college this semester, I'm 18.|`|uRFhhSjZaa	mhm ;)|`|9kYR9zKGaa	i think they are only attractive if you know how to wwear them. They are especially hott on rockstars!!!|`|pGSqE9mxaa	Well if we can see your whole "package" and if they make you walk funny, then they are too tight. I love skinny jeans on guys, but they have to FIT them. I know of some guys that actually wear girl's jeans b/c they are tighter which is just wrong. I'm a senior in highschool and I'm tired of seeing guys in skin tight pants!|`|6Bdmj1v3aa	yes i do but it depends on confidence like you could wear the most hideous thing and your confidence wearing it would make it look good it also depends on the guy wearing it though-high school

You can design your own converse, i  made my own and every loves them!     http://www.converse.com/index.aspx?&CSID...     If your not into that, here is some other idea.      Cool jeans.

If you dont feel like going out to buy anything, try layering your clothes. Put short sleeves over long sleeves, wear several necklaces at once, mix it up!|`|R6Z8onywaa	this stuff is super cute  http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/3017816/0~23...  http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/3015616/0~23...|`|4uDEukF9aa	try wearing tiny jewelry...earings r cute. and tshirts with flats and skinny jeants or shorts|`|cndj2Tksaa	I would wear V-neck shirts|`|QO0VG3SPaa	Layers and accessories.  Mix and match your clothes, experiment a little. Get some fun pieces that look like they'll match well with your wardrobe. Maybe get some new accessories, like headbands, belts, etc.   One of my favorite looks in the winter is a long sleeved shirt, skirt, and tights with cute boots.
pHcl1aQbaa	i beleive that once you die your hair black you will always have either  red or oarnge tint to your hair afterwards..so eather keep getting it stripped or cut it all the way off..|`|In1UqryNaa	If you go to a salon they can strip out he color, i've had it done before, it makes is reddish brown.  Otherwise you have to grow it out.|`|rUV2tMeFaa	JUST DIE UR HAIR THAT COLOR AGAIN GOSH!|`|svTxZxA1aa	Cut it and grow it out...there is no coming back from black....should have listened to your mom...|`|e3E21fA8aa	it fades quite a bit in time and you can also go and get it stripped out but that takes a while (well for me it did!)|`|G1ikqQVuaa	Find the closest color to your natural color and have a professional color it for you. Then, let it grow out!|`|QlI40Sf3aa	you can go to the hairdressers to get it striped...but this can be expensive...or you can wait 4 it to grow out...=] x|`|Qr4CHPbSaa	You either need to let your hair fully grow out  or   have your salonist dye it that exact color  and then let it grow out.  The only reason you should have it dyed the natural color first is so that it doesn't look totally weird when your growing it all out.|`|tE2ZHOd6aa	die your hair the nearest colour to your natural colour as you can and just let it grow out.|`|HtlXLxlVaa	Just let it grow out. You can talk to a hair dresser and ask their opinion on what to do before coloring it again. The products they use should not damage your hair.|`|JRlMZeNhaa	uhm,, let the die grow out , or cut your hair ( short )|`|3Fwet0PVaa	grow it or colour it black|`|3PEQAUT9aa	What you should do is find the color closest to your natural color ( it won't be the EXACT color but close) and dye it that. Then wait till your hair grows out to it's natural color and it should be fine.    :)    We all go through fazes and make mistakes. Just fix them!    :D|`|AA10921399	wait about 4 months till it grows back n then cut the colored hair..|`|DWqyK0Mbaa	Use Loreal Color Zap!!       It works, it takes off any hair dye you might have...you can youtube it and check it out.|`|EwFq9zMqaa	you could get the color stripped at the place where you got it dyed, which ive heard costs alot. you could just dye over it, too.
QoVL5cDHaa	Maybe you should go to your GP, and ask or a thyroid blood test. I am a lot older than you, but my underactive thyroid caused my skin to go dry, and I had alopecia quite badly at times. Of course, at your age, hormone levels are everywhere, and it may be just that. My daughter is also old enough to be your mother, and she is losing a lot of hair after having a baby. That is hormonal, too.|`|o298GAKcaa	use head and shoulders its good or go your gp they can supply stuff.|`|TCpTlCTRaa	Aromatherapy scalp massage with essential oils specifically for dry scalp and hair loss is a very effective remedy. Teenage hair loss is becoming much more common. The site below has a lot of information and articles about teenage hair loss. You can also get information about blending aromatherapy formulas for teenage hair loss and scalp conditions.|`|tE2ZHOd6aa	its the same problem with me, its been happening for years. ther is nothing you can do about it, maybe change your shampoo but thats it.|`|wgrWNnjWaa	If you are using lost of hair products like dyes then they may be causing your problem as some products can strip your hair of all its nutrients. Use separate shampoo and conditioner (as i used to use combined and it was awful for my hair) and wash your hair every other day. Also when you brush (if you do) don't brush too hard This way your hair should keep its strength and not be pulled out.  You could also try switching to a shampoo designed for irregular use.|`|GVTHSoIOaa	Try boots experts cosmetics for very dry scalp. They have shampoo and other cosmetics that will help to maintain moister. If it won't help you should visit skin doctor as it might be some skin illness.     You can also visit: http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/ate/health/sk... for some information on skin problems.|`|KGppArcfaa	I have also had this problem for years. Get Nioxin. You can get it a bit cheaper on ebay if your parents buy from there or its like $40 for a shampoo,conditioner, therapy set from a salon or beauty supply. You will see results in the first use I promise you.  You could also try seeing a dermatologist
oB8TysC5aa	Shave the brown|`|GLEGh4N0aa	purple might look a bit weird try red it'll look beautiful with pale skin :)|`|uf78f5Tkaa	My friend has dirty blonde hair and dyed the bottom half of it dark purple, its different, but nice.  Maybe you should go for a dark coloured highlights (If you want different), imagine what the colour would look like on your hair before you actually dye it though.  =)  Good Luck !|`|zsBViFcSaa	Try red! It's bold, confident, and beautiful! My friend has extremely pale skin, and she used to have blonde hair. She tried for a bright red and it looked amazing with her light skin. Red also looks great when you have bright eyes.     I hope I helped! =D|`|qI12jcVpaa	what say is to wear a dark blush, that will give to your hair.   i suggest that you curl your hair and then get a purple highlight on the side.   then get a white headband with a small bow and put that in.     :-) Hope i helped!!!!!!!!!
bEypuYJ0aa	you should be able to do whatever you want with it since it's so fine.|`|xYacZrTLaa	try a little dark high lights|`|zUANF1ydaa	im sorry, but if your hair is thin then short hair is the way to go, i suggest a sidesweep as well, for a nice mature look, also in right now is razored hair, it looks really nice and adds dimension|`|rFcjTWubaa	You could get layers, or maybe if you want a real change, you could dye it darker, I think that maybe that could make it seem less thin.    If you're feeling adventurous, maybe something like this?  http://www.hairdohairstyles.com/Hairstyl...  It would really make your head seem smaller, and your forehead as well. You could keep it blonde doing that too  It's not too short either.  Hope I helped!
2jMFurDoaa	sure they can !  my husband and all his friends use mine, they thought it would be funny until they saw it really worked!|`|1qOOig4Baa	Yup, anybody can use them! They really help to get rid of blackheads.
AA12112752	You could use a wide curling iron, or you could use rag curls and the comb them until you have the desired curl and softness. Use minimal product, as that would only weigh your hair down.|`|bAmpR3Exaa	at night when its damp like twist your hair into two buns and sleep in it  or in braids or you can in the morning like when your hair is kinda wet but more dry like use mousse and scrunch it..|`|Twq7efhQaa	Easier way to do this is with heated rollers and leave them on for a good few hours.  Great website to show you how.     http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=h...|`|rUV2tMeFaa	2ND ONE|`|OSF2WMQeaa	i love their hair haha but you french braid it...well thats what i do. it keeps it natural and pretty. or you could try side braiding for looser and bigger curls.    hope that helped :)|`|VXSzg0l7aa	There is this weird way that you can curl your hair using strips of cloth from like an old pillow case, you'll have to google "curling your hair with rags" and I'm sure you will find some tutorials on it. Anyway, depending on the way you tie the rags in your hair depends on the type of curl youll get.|`|NS3BxXEmaa	I love it u would look great with it|`|G3uTp7dpaa	use a 1/2 curling iron.  twist the hair around the iron. dont use hair from the top use the hair in the middle. hold for about 10-15 seconds.|`|oSxgDvUraa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nz4Giq66d...    Here is a tutorial.  I like this girl on youtube (itsjudytime), she has lots of good ideas.|`|RYXzZbgRaa	Curling iron, or if you have a flat iron you can curl it with that too. It actually turns out really nice and stays in a long time. You can watch the video I am going to link you to below for more info about curling with a flat iron. Remember to use hairspray and some heat protector so you don't damage your hair. Good luck!

nVQGpvuoaa	I don't use cheap conditioner.  I shampoo twice.   I leave my normal conditioner in for 3-5 mintues.  Then I deep condition my hair every time I take a shower and leave that in for 5-10 mintues.  My hair is always shiny and silky and people always feel the need to touch it.|`|0QuqOFUlaa	i put olive oil in mine for at least an hour 3-4 times a week and that always makes it irresistibly shiny and soft. then i leave in my conditioner while i shower. i also deep condition it every night almost. when your hair is soft and shiny it means it is healthy so make sure to take vitamins.
n68tCJ7zaa	well that was a dumb idea.|`|c5anDswjaa	Thats what happens when youre a ding dong and dont educate yourself on self piercings :P..     Just take something to help swelling, and LEAVE IT ALONE.. Dont try to keep piercing it, or stick anything in it, just let it heal up..

Jesus, I'm glad it didn't go through. Rubbing alcohol? Dear LORD!     You need to leave your lip alone to heal. Also, a warm sea salt and water soak for 10 minutes 2x a day will do wonders. Just leave your lip alone and your body will take care of itself.     DON'T put ice on it, by the way.|`|d8jH5lU1aa	Ur lip usually gets swollen LOL well my did and they didn't even miss ( also at night it hurt so much that my lip felt numb after a wile)try putting on some salt water DO NOT use mouth wash ( this only makes it worse) and try to wash your mouth every time you eat or drink ( other than water)=]and probably wait to put on the fakii|`|PFBKuVhBaa	thats what professionals are for  so young people dont go around doing it them selves.  that aside.

lCxcfisfaa	The texture of her hair was made the way it was made .... that will never change. There are many girls who would KILL for thick/wavy hair. Use this as an opportunity to teach her to love the skin she's in. Show her pictures of celebrities with similar hair ... tell her its beautiful on a regular basis .... try new things with her.    At 11, I think it's ok to introduce her to a straightener. Have her wash her hair with a straightening shampoo/conditioner. Then apply a heat protectant and guide a heated straightener down the shaft of a small section of hair. The thinner the section, the better it will work.    Set some bounderies though so she doesn't go straightner obsessed and make sure she turns it off when she's done or get one with an automatic shut-down! Have her wash her hair every other day ...so that she isn't straightening it everyday. And on the weekends, have her go au' natural. John Frieda has great frizz products that will calm her down.    As far as styles for shoulder length wavy hair, a headband could help settle things down. A style that is really in right now is a head scarf wrapped like a headband with a ponytail. Alot of older girls (HS age) are wearing their hair in messy bun-bob type things and wavy thick hair is PERFECT for that.     But back to the straightner, I think I understand the look she wants and she will only get that with a straightener.|`|9cYqY6vWaa	braids, ultra cute. side ponytails. straighten it every once in a while, but not too much.|`|eTyDKL1Jaa	im 11 and i think my hair is cute. it looks excatly like this onehttp://www.beauty-and-the-bath.com/pre-t...    btw, scroll down a bit till u see a blonde girl    hope i helped! bye|`|LVO8ixtaaa	She could get it layered, and thinned out. That would take care of some of the thickness. Other than that, you could buy her a flat iron an straighten it. Or, you could get it chemically straightened. Lastly, you could buy a relaxer.   Good luck ^ _ ^"

G3uTp7dpaa	i got really short bangs last summer.  i ended up using them as side bangs like two months later.  it does grow pretty quick!  it'll definitley grow out before june. (:|`|Zg1v2qifaa	You can always sweep your straight bangs to the side - side swept bangs are kind of like side bangs. It might take two to three months for them to grow to your earlobe if they're at your eyebrows right now.|`|F8Tdrg3Waa	Everyone's hair grows out at a different rate. Your bangs will probably be long enough by June, depending on how fast your hair grows and whether it breaks easily.|`|pjbdDi2Oaa	When they cut my side bangs they cut them at about the level of my pupil and i just push them over and they look good. Yours will grow out really soon, probably 2 months at the most and they will be long enough to push to the side and look good|`|mjjrSrBAaa	Well, usually hair grows from 6 - 9 inches in a year. And your graduation is around 5 or 6 months away. So your bangs will probably grow by then.    People with stringy/greasy/thin hair usually grow their hair out faster though.    Also, don't dye your hair, and try to use heat on it as little as possible.   Take vitamins every morning.    This will make your bangs grow out faster and healthier.|`|Lyrc2BWmaa	well you can have side bangs that are grown near your eyes, thats what i have and i get so many compliments.    Im not sure how short you cut yours, but its probly annoying having to always put them back, some maybe try to put them off to the side, hold them down with a clip until they become adjusted to that side and after 15 min or so, see how it looks.

Then flat-iron your hair section by section|`|rFcjTWubaa	You could go to a salon and ask them to get your hair thinned out, that will make it less poofy, and easier to control.|`|ywl35HeEaa	i have ur solution.     to define and smooth curls, i use a product called "noodle head" after you get out of the shower. just put it in evenly and then brush it in... after that scrunch your hair with your hands until you get your desired curls and waves....    anyway i would also use the kenra shine serum weightless polish and john frieda luscious color glaze clear shine ...  those are for really really silky hair.  use the kenra on dry or wet hair and use the john frieda in the shower.    also if you are looking for a hairstyle, you should get side swoop bangs, straighten them, and leave the rest curly, i do that, that looks good... okay that is all i have i guess... you can't completely get rid of frizz, there is just no solution. it helps if you don't brush your curls once you take a shower because it like breaks them up and creates more poof and frizz.     okay... hope i helped! BYE!|`|KXn5oN1Saa	before you straighten your hair put baby oil not to much but a little depends on your hair and after your done putting oil on it make sure that section isnt to oily and then pass the straightner through your hair and repeat it to all your hair     |`|y0Bs169Vaa	use heating iron?

392b18ae97259a7518f51868eb7ea463aa	Why can't you get laser? I am in the middle of having a tattoo removed with laser and so far so good! My tattoo was professionally done and will need a few more treatments, but amateur tattoos (like yours) are removed with the least number of sessions. This has to do with the quality of the ink (yours will break down faster) and the placement of the ink (yours isn't as deep into the skin as a professionally done tattoo). I wouldn't rule laser out. Stay away from those chemical peels. They are nothing more than scars in a bottle.     Any thing worth doing is worth doing right.|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	No, it would not. Even wrecking balm and similar products, only work to fade the tattoo slightly in order to have it covered over easier. Why do you think people spend thousands on laser if there was an easier and cheaper method? Do you think people enjoy throwing money around and causing themselves a great deal of pain? No.    Sometimes you just have to live with your mistakes. It's just your skin. Deal with it. Some of us have real problems in life. Look into getting a cover up if it's that bad and you can't afford laser.|`|LBHJaqXoaa	Uh-oh. No laser, either? Hmmmm... Have you considered Wrecking Balm? I have heard it has decent results, but have never seen the results in person. Here's a link to their website: http://www.wreckingbalm.com/    I don't know about a tca peel, but it might be worth a shot.
lkNJNnlSaa	Kind of Dykey|`|u7o75zipaa	Okay, cute skirt - go black tights though or it'll be too grey.  The boots are kinda yuck, but that's just my opinion..

Maybe add some kinda accessory.. beads or a chunky bracelet or something.    x|`|CS4MVhsfaa	Hi, Love!    Those boots ROCK!    I'd build up from there.  Skinny black jeans with a studded belt.

John H|`|rkoxkAPDaa	NOPE!|`|uZrYy6snaa	If you change the boots to a plain ankle type, to be honest, it looks a bit Preppy. As it is, with the right type of make up, you are heading more into the Emo/Goth style.    If you do want to go for a Rock Chick look, the boots are an OK place to start. Go with the black tights and put some coloured fishnets over the top.   Get yourself a good strong needle and some strong, black thread.  Following the four vertical seam lines around the upper half of the skirt, tack downwards towards the hem then ruche the fabric up to shorten the skirt. When you have finished these four lines, repeat the step by sewing another four, each halfway between two of the first set.  You should now have eight equidistant vertical lines of stitching around the skirt, running from hem to the join with the upper half of the skirt.   Next step is to ruche the fabric up each line. It doesn't need to be heavily ruched but the skirt should ideally be mid-thigh or higher, so if you need to draw the fabric up tightly, then it's fine.  Arrange the ruffles carefully, don't let them lie too evenly or too neat. At the hem ruffle, allow some to lie so that the inner edge is visible but only do it with two or three, it will look too organised if you do that to them all. Once you are satisfied with how it looks, carefully stitch it from the inside. If you want to do it with a sewing machine, you'll need a decent quality machine and a good, thick needle. If you can manage by hand, use a strong needle and double your thread, then stitch the inside part of all the ruffles together along the line of your tacking/gathering. If doing this by hand, you can make sure that none of the outside ruffle area (the parts you'll see)  are caught down. (If you use a sewing machine, they will all be held down along the whole length. This will look quite different to the handfinished version when it's finished.)   Tidy up any straggling threads and add any finishing touches you might want. (see below *)  The cardigan and tank top could be fine, although I think it would look better worn the other way round. Put the cardigan on first, if it's a fitted cardie, great. Otherwise, try wearing it a bit like a wraparound, secure it with tiny dressmakers safety pins, Wear the tank over the top, tuck any collar part of the cardigan underneath, out of sight, then safety pin them in place making sure the pins can't be seen.    Finally, add a big wide, corset style belt or a wide metal/leather hipster type belt. (With the corset belt, let any tank top fabric showing below it lie reasonably smooth. If you can't find one of those, let the fabric of the top lie in a rumpled, slightly assymmetric line once it passes the waistband of your skirt. Wear the belt at a more acute angle in the opposite direction, so that it lies across the point where  so that it looks like you top has ridden up.)    Hope this helps a bit.    *  By the way, if you want to make any more changes to the skirt, here are a few,    1. Measure the distance around the hem of the skirt and the length of the skirt after adapting it. Buy some netting fabric which is one and a half times larger in each direction. Go for a bright, contrasting colour to the black/gray skirt, red, purple or teal would look really great. Making sure you have the fabric right way up, measure out the diameter of the hem plus 5 centimetres. Now stitch the fabric into a tube (lay the fabric rightside onto wrongside to do it. It's trickier to sew it that way but right sides together makes the ruching a LOT more difficult) Lay the tube of fabric on top of your skirt with one open edge 5 centimetres above the horizontal seam  in the middle. Use a safety pin to attach the fabric around the original skirt, pinning it on at the top of each of the eight ruffle lines. (Make sure that the stitched line of the overlapped part is pinned to a back seam. Start the next step at this seam as well.)  Grip the fabric at the safety pin and lay out both fabric layers so that they are taught but not stretched. Attach thread to the net layer an inch above the hem of the ruffle in the skirt beneath. Tack straight down to the edge of the net, measure the distance you have just tacked. Unpin the net from the skirt then fold it along the sewn line then lie the fabric flat and smooth it down, all the way to the other side. Measure up from the bottom of the net, using the same distance as you did on the other side. Attach your thread at the point you've just measured, then press firmly on the net with a thumb nail and crease it down to the bottom. Open the fabric out again and tack down tho the edge, using the crease to keep the line straight. Lie the net flat again with the two lines of stitching on top of each other and again measure and crease the edges then tack in a gathering line. Align, crease and tack until you have all 8 rows of stitches in place. Gather each row then secure the gathered parts by sewing the backs. Try the net inside the skirt and carefully adjust the height to make sure that no ungathered areas show from the outside and that the two pieces sit nicely together, also align the "overlap" gather with. When you are satisfied, pin the net in place. Fold the excess internal length of netting down between the skirt and underskirt, replacing the pinning as you go, ensuring the fold line follows the ridge of the seam which is made by the join between the upper and lower half of the skirt.  If you want the netting to be permenant, sew it securely to the same ridge of fabric inside the skirt. (When attaching these pieces together, hold the skirt fabric taught but keep the netting tension a little looser to ensure that you won't have a crease of excess netting lumped together at the end.) If you would like to be able to remove the underskirt, sew a strip of bias binding securely around the fold. Attach the hooks from a number of hook and eyes, spaced evenly around t|`|jUjkvis8aa	Okay, so you want the rock chick look? The boots are fine, but the skirt is a no-no-it's too Emo for a rock chick. Either make it a mini or don't wear it at all. You could turn up the hem so it is above your knees, but if you can't just don't wear it.    The cardi sounds cool, as do the legwarmers. However, I would change the black tank top for something more graphic, such as:  ?http://www.asos.com/Asos/Asos-Face-Print...  ?http://www.asos.com/Ben-Sherman/Ben-Sher...  ?http://www.topshop.com/webapp/wcs/stores...

YIQI20LKaa	yep, you can definitely wear them all year round :] i bought a pair of uggs and the sales lady said it was definitely fine.  but although you are allowed to wear your uggs in the heat, i think it really depends if you want to. would your feet get uber sweaty? what shoes do you usually wear in the summer?  another problem is that uggs can get worn out really fast if you get really attached to them and wear them all the time, so by next winter, they might be all gross.  but as long as you don't wear them TOO much, it's perfectly fine to wear them when it's warm! :] enjoy your uggs!    P.S. you're not weird just because you're a guy and you wear uggs. i bought my old boyfriend (and no, he is not gay now) "man" uggs for christmas last year, i think he looks adorable in them ;D|`|XAIurFZnaa	Hehe I agree with the second person...and  a quick question: Do you tuck your jeans in them or what??    anyways, 40 degrees is still cold enough to wear Uggs :]|`|hBLHZs3daa	not summer but yeah i wear them alot|`|VrjF986Aaa	thats like asking if I would wear a North Face in July    wait a minute... a guy with Uggs, and you're straight?

Fg2mCLr2aa	I used to work at a tanning salon and first off, DO NOT go tanning tomorrow. It will only make your burn worse and also your skin will not tan if it's burned. You will only get a tan if your skin is healthy, not burnt. So going tanning tomorrow will not make you tanner on the sun burned parts and it will only make your burn worse. Plus, burning = radiation which = cancer.     Seems to me that you are not using a indoor tanning lotion. See if you don't use an indoor tanning lotion when you tan, the first half of time that you are in the booth the rays are actually bouncing off your skin while your skin adjusts to the rays. So technically you are really only tanning for half the time if you don't use an indoor tanning lotion. What an indoor tanning lotion does is prep your skin for the rays so the moment you turn the booth on your skin absorbs the rays. There are indoor tanning lotions that contain tons of bronzers and DHA (sunless tanner) that will boost your tan even more. Talk to an employee at the salon about them. There are also indoor tanning lotions that contain something called "tingle" which would definitly help because it helps your skin produce more melanin (melanin are cells that turn brown once they get oxidized) and it also gives you a deeper tan. Lotions with tingles are only recommended for experienced tanners who want to get darker once they have hit their platue. A tip for getting your legs tanner is to not shave them as much because when you shave you removed the top layer of skin cells. Also, healthy skin tans better, faster, and stays longer so please make sure to moisturize with lotion a lot. And please don't go tanning while you're burnt, it won't help and it only higher your risk of getting cancer.|`|RYVKYYnAaa	there is always tanning oil that you can buy from the store and that helps you get darker quicker|`|kgwcYjeqaa	I have that problem to, I think its natural for you face, arms etc to not tan well, because in the summer there always exposed to the sun so there use to it.  When your tummy is always covered so as soon as its exposed to the uv lights it burns very easily.    My face barely tans and when i asked the girl that works at my salon "perfect tan" she said i'd have to buy one of there good quality lotions.  So i bought one just for the face and it actually worked. However it did cost me $44 for 50ml :(|`|9556ce3b5bbc6563054ca4da2c6f3a96aa	The only thing i can think of for you to do is ask someone at the tanning salon who knows.|`|kxEJN7Btaa	There are lotions and creams that you can apply to that it will cause the tan to be brought deeper into the skin and allow the tan to become darker quicker. At first I thought it was a joke but tried it and I noticed a difference rather quickly. Even after I stopped tanning I was dark for quite some time afterwards. I used something called Paradise or it had the word in the name. You can also use it outside the booth. Essentially you become darker faster and longer.|`|t3YT79WHaa	Its because the curves and stuff  you have to evenly apply any oil i use Australian Gold   It works great, i use tanning beds and outside.  Apply more to face arms ect. Wherever you have problems  problem with face is the oil will move to places that slope down like your nose neck ect.  Just be shure your not wet make shure everything is evenly applied and no dripping oil
XpwLdgbfaa	i got the same letter!  and i never been asked to model either but nothing fishies going on! they really want us to compete for the title of Miss Teen Phoenix! but the reason you've never gotten this letter before is you probably turned 13 this year so that's when they start sending it out. its all very real. there are three different competitions. 1. personality where you will be interviewed. 2. casual wear, this competition is where you show the judges what you would wear to a casual outing or school. 3. formal wear in this round you would wear a fancy dress and show the judges what you would wear to either black tie or cocktail events (i'm not sure which one)   but this letter is not a prank it is a real pageant where there are scholarships and cash prizes given.    it's going to be so much fun! hope you join!  and i hope this helped!|`|Rs3ITS1Iaa	Im positive this is a scam.|`|vISjftpKaa	Well check for contact info.

You don't really need all that coverage if you're so tiny.|`|jc7L2TtPaa	I think it looks cute on the model, and-, if you have a waist line like hers it would be a nice conservative look. But, the price tag is ridiculous. How many decades are you planning to wear it? For that price I hope it is guaranteed for at least five years. For a bikini, you should check http://www.bestswimwear.com/ to get an idea of what you want and then look at the local department stores to find something similar.  http://www.walmart.com/catalog/catalog.g...    http://www.sears.com/shc/s/search_10153_...    keyword=swimwear&gobutton.x=24&gobutto...    http://www.kmart.com/shc/s/search_10151_...    vName=Clothing&keyword=women%    http://www.kmart.com/shc/s/search_10151_...    vName=Clothing&keyword=women%    http://www.macys.com/catalog/index.ognc?

f0c7494798cce55a10ca3286a78a9f71aa	I have very fair skin and I think it looks best on us fair girls.If you aren't already, I'd go or stick with being a brunnette.It will complement your skin tone better and I personally LOVE brown hair. Go dark brown or either brown with slight reddish tones.|`|vnOz03Aaaa	i am VERY VERY fair skinned.. i think the more fair, the better it looks with blond hair.|`|6C5koeiwaa	tannnnnnn|`|YJPRiQQzaa	I am pretty darn pale. And a lot of pink in my skin.|`|oVfqFHntaa	im quite pale.  i think it depends what kind of blonde you want.  if you want a subtle, honey blonde then your skin tone would look lovely.  (like nicole richie atm)  although if you wanted very light, bleach blonde hair then probably a paler complection looks better.
yWRTrnR2aa	Basics: Foundation brush, blush brush, eyeshadow brush, angled eyeliner brush, and a lip brush.|`|2tMJ27gOaa	Go to a department store and get the Lancome makeup brush kit...they last forever and have every type of brush you could imagine    http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=lan...|`|r0ISrLc1aa	ok well i would just go to mac and get a brush kit, it comes with like 5 different brushes. ask them to help you. im guessing you want to mostly do your eye makeup differently right? i have the set of eye makeup brushes, theyre realllly nice. theres a regular eye shadow brush, a slanted eye shadow brush(for eyeliner and darker colors), and a second eyeshadow brush. it also comes with a lip brush and a foundation brush. email me if you want :) xokristinx7@yahoo.com
d7bcedc128f094df6e910173d672703eaa	If it's just one or two nails, It means you may have hurt the nail bed.  If you have them on all your nails, it's because you need more calcium. Drink milk, eat cheese, yogurt, broccoli, sardines and salmon in the can and you will see a big difference.|`|yhgRaBPXaa	I get them when there has been trama on the nail like hitting my hand on something. I have never found a way to get rid of them. I usually just paint my nails if i have a lot of them|`|mvAgLB9laa	Means you are calcium deficient - drink more milk.|`|aJFVCGOgaa	They are bruised nails or calcium or zinc deficiency marks and you have to grow them out   x|`|9dNEw7etaa	You have a vitamin deficiency.|`|hVKYVJ89aa	white spots..or in technical terms 'leuchonychia'.  Many people say it is a sign of a calcium defiency, but they are actually caused by air bubbles under the nail plate which you get from trauma such as being in an accident or you can get them from having poor health.     To disguise them just paint your nails, and in general look after your nails such as have regular manicures, buff your nails, look after your cuticles etc.. all of this will help your nails to grow healthier. so as your nails grow you will lose the white spots and the replacement nail will be clear.     hope this helped xo|`|mKHllIz8aa	i get those too! they're soo annoying! i usually just paint over them with a peachy color that matches my skin, so it looks natural.|`|vcNOuvPNaa	It means you lack calcium. You should drink more milk or eat more dairy products.|`|w0mlsboEaa	Thats calcium deposits. I get them all the time. Try to get more calcium.

AA11605400	I use Frizz ease hair serum by John Freida, works like charm|`|AA12299104	Use a very very moisturizing cream conditioner every time you wash your hair, and a deep conditioner 1-2 times a week. Also every time you wash and dry your hair rub some leave in conditioner in it to tame the frzzies.  The reason hair frizzes up most of the time is because of lack of moisture, so keeping it hydrated will help a lot. Also use an anti frizz serum or shine serum when styling your hair and you shoud see great results. If your hair is straight sleeping with a slik scarf tied around your hair smooths it down and makes it a lot less frizzy while you are sleeping!|`|25d1a32c1902681743f1b08781f62f7aaa	Well, depending on your hair type, will depend on the method to use. If your hair is curly...your kinda screwed. Frizz-eaze anti-frizz serum in maximum strength and frizz-eaze wind down cream (which also comes in maximum strength if you need it) will help. Just apply to wet hair and let air dry.    If your hair is straight and it looks ok just after you've showered and dried it. Take a Bounce dryer sheet and run it along your hair. (Aside from it being a fabric softner, one of the main points of Bounce drier sheets is to stop static electricity on your clothes. It works for hair too.)|`|HDMgXucDaa	cut it|`|bda420154b0ba7b47d730f801c83b317aa	There are several brands of  hair spray call Frizz ease by Loreal. Very good stuff.

Have fun regretting it later in life.|`|kCdISEGqaa	Don't do it yet.  You haven't thought it out.  A tattoo should be something personal to you, not something a bunch of strangers have suggested.  You can tattoo over scars, but the tattoo not look the same as it does over healthy skin.  It's usually best to tattoo around a scar.  You can Google it and find examples of what people have done.  Small scars are of course, easier to work with, large scars, they make it tough.  Wait a while please, finish growing, you're only 16.|`|AA12204435	Don't get one till you know for sure what you want. And as far as getting it removed that will leave a scar and cost thousands of dollars.
1Hx7MFUvaa	I also have yellow undertones and a cream blush is a great way to make your cheeks naturally luminous. That being said you want to pick out a color that you would naturally blush.  If you believe that you truly have warm (yellow) undertones, stay away from rosey shades like mauve's, plums, berries, and candy colored pinks. Think to yourself-would this shade look better against silvers or golds. If you think it'll match gold better than that's what you should pick. So think soft corals, nudes,  woodsy earth tone shades.|`|iwOFiYwWaa	okai i think you will look nice in this one >>Cherche|`|SRs6xcxPaa	a bright green or a light brown|`|OfUje9r8aa	i like the 1 called uncommon color!|`|fCSGDpROaa	Lillicent is my favorite and I think it would work for all skintones.

pGIADFNxaa	you can't have flawless skin.everyone gets spots.some less than others,some more than others.  if you stick to a routine of cleaning your skin every morning&night it will improve your complexion,since youre getting rid of all the dirt on your skin.and exfoliate atleast once a week.applying vitamin e to your skin will also help.  if its spots that are worrying you,you can go see a dermatologist,he/she will sort it out for you (:  none of the spot creams/gels really work,its just a waste of money.  i wear no make up,even though my skin aint that good,i still get a few spots,i dont really care to be honest.|`|AQxqS7Kyaa	Tinted Moisturiser    Or    The night before AND the same mourning clense,tone and moisturise.    Hoped ive helped|`|Twq7efhQaa	Steps of Routine Skincare for Flawless Skin:    1) Cleansing:    Cleansing is essential to remove excess oil and dirt from your skin. Cleansing is done with specific solutions, known as cleansers. Cleansers are mixture of oil, surfactant and water. Oil dissolves the oil, surfactant cleans the dirt and water washes out all the garbage giving your skin a fresh look and feel.    All cleansers may not go with your skin type. The ratio of oil to the surfactant and water defines how your skin would response to the cleanser. Excess oil content may block pores while lesser oil often leads to dry skin. Get yourself a good cleanser that suits your skin type. Visit online drugstore to buy a suitable product.    2) Exfoliation:    This process removes dead skin cells that make your skin look dull by changing your natural complexion. When you exfoliate all the dead skin cells are peeled off along with the outer layer of skin. This makes your skin look fresh and more youthful.    Among various processes of exfoliation Scrubbing is quite common and popular. Scrub cleaners take the dead cell layer off your skin gently. A considerable number of people prefer peeling treatments as well. Exfoliation should be done at least twice in a week.    3) Moisturizing:    Whether yours is oily or dry, you must moisturize your skin. Moisturizer moistens your skin by locking water on the surface. If your skin often becomes dry and your face seems to be stretched tightly, perhaps it lacks moisture.    4) Sunscreen:    Sun damage is often irreversible. The best way to protect your skin from sun burn is using sunscreen. Avoiding exposure to direct sunlight may not work. UV rays of the sun are active on cloudy days too.    Sun damage is one of the main reasons of early wrinkles. After applying all the basic facial products, use a sunscreen. Alternatively, you can use a moisturizer with sunscreen for the daytime and purchase a moisturizer without sunscreen for night.|`|ne2sEeLJaa	Well to get flawless skin.

BioStrath also has all the B vitamins which is good for your lips,   anyways now my lips are so smooth and NORMAL!! i can actually go out without carrying lip balm in my pocket. and as for my skin, i've been taking BioStrath for about a week or two, and when i wash my face it feels like porcelin and silk lol. i can't get over how amazing it is. and when i touch it there isnt a single dry spot or flake and its perfectly smooth and soft.  i seriously hope this works as well for you as it did for me, because i can't thank my dad enough for buying it for me.

Two weeks ago I got Lash Stiletto, and it's my new favorite mascara. I like it even better then the $18 Urban Decay Skyscraper mascara I usually wear. It gives more volume than Lash Maxxx, but not as clumpy as the Skyscraper is. And I really like the shape of the brush, and how much thinner the mascara is, rather than thicker ones that are more prone to clumping. Go for it!    Edit: In contrast to what you see in the commercial, I didn't notice any 'black patent shine.' But it definitely lengthened my lashes to a fine point.|`|SBnbb9luaa	I have never tried it but judging from others people opinions, it doesn't sound good. I recommend Maybelline's The Colossal Volume. Its in a bright yellow and purple tube. I LOVE it. Gives you long, full lashes. also if you are willing to splurge a little, I also recommend from Benefit Bad gal Lash from Sephora. Its $20 but well worth it. Its in a huge tube and lasts longer than most mascaras because of its size The wand is also very large as well giving you full lashes. Hope this helps!

jgTvzlUlaa	Urban Decay has amazing eyeshadows that last all day.  They are very pigmented.  [:  Also Revlon has 12-hour color stay eyeshadow that lasts all day.   It doesn't have many colors to choose from, but if that's what your looking for, then get Revlon.  It's a couple dollars cheaper than Urban Decay, but Urban Decay has higher quality.  Or, instead of buying new eyeshadow, you should get a primer.  Urban Decay has a great one.   It's called Urban Decay Eyeshadow Primer Potion.  It's $16 at Sephora, Ulta, urbandecay.com, sephora.com, and ulta.com.  Hope I helped!  :D|`|jRmR0NrQaa	There are many great eyeshadows, it really also depends on your budget.

1Hx7MFUvaa	hey, don't let anyone scare you into thinking it's going to hurt. I've had my ears, nose, nipple, clitoral hood, back of my neck (nape) and my navel (belly button) pierced. If you can get your ears pierced you're good for about anyhting else. When you get your earlobes pierced they are literally just punching the earring studs into your ears. When you get most body/surface piercings they use a clamp and a hollow needle. It's relatively painless depending on the sensitivity of that area. it's not really about your threshold of pain. Take a deep breath when instructed and relax. Getting my hood and my ears pierced involved the most pain than anything else, and when I say "pain" I actually mean "discomfort" . So good luck , and take care of it well. There is acctually more redness and throbbing involved when you get your ears pierced. Once you get it done, you'll realize that you were worried for nothing and the whole process is going to take about 15 seconds.|`|pCfsvdpxaa	GOT MINE PIERCED AB 3 TIMES!

My friend did it. She said that the piercing person grabs whatever amount of fat/ skin you have and pull it with a pair of tweezers. Then they take a big needle-gun utensil and pierce it through whatever amount of skin/ fat you have. It was very red, swollen, and painful for the first three days. After that she said that the pain gradually decreased and she was fine. You seem to have a pretty good tolerance to pain, so I wouldn't worry about it.|`|FS9ibKB5aa	well first off there is a bidifferencefe between pinching an area and stubbing a needle through it.  when you get a piercing it goes through skin and when you pinch it you're only applying pressure to it.      navel piercings do hurt. but theyre not unbearable.    its a minor pain. it just stings a little and its quick.    i say you go for it. whatever pain may or may not experiencece when you get the piercing, it is quick and very much worth it.

Also try to be nice to other people and they will see you for who you are.  And keep in mind that appearance doesn't matter, bbecause everyone is beautiful in their own way.. I'm pretty sure your beautiful too.

I know a girl who is in the popular crowd and quite overweight. She's also insanely pretty and has an amazing personality. However, you need something going for you. You need a stellar personality and people skills, have a pretty face with clear skin, and be very fashionable. I'm sorry but lose some weight, maybe not all of it but some, you'll be healthier too.Make friends one by one until you can join their group!

Zg1v2qifaa	Well I have a suggestion... You can blow dry your hair so that your bangs are sideswept http://a.abcnews.com/images/Entertainmen...   and then you can curl the ends of your hair, if you're willing to wear it a bit shorter than it already is.   http://celebhairstyle.files.wordpress.co...  Add a fancy hairband  http://www.claires.com/product.asp?name=...  http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i308/t...  and ta-da! A very cute hairstyle.    Or you can simply put your hair in a sleek french twist (instructions can be googled) or bun with a fancy hairclip/hairpin put into it.    Hope this helps!

Thoroughly massage with an essential oil - olive, almond, jojoba and coconut are excellent. (See USER'S happy response below). First tighten skin by tightening face muscles so that you will not be pulling or stressing skin. Do a forward and back massage with finger tips and front of fingers. A circular motion will not work. Do over and over firmly. For quickest results do each day for 5 min or more. Pores will greatly minimize in as little as 2 to 3 days. Skin is always shedding and renewing. Massage forces a new clearer skin to emerge. You can quickly have a smooth, tight, totally blemish free, healthy skin.  REPLY FROM A USER - wannabeblue28 :" Hi Mukunda M. Omg, I've been following your advice and massaging my face vigorously with coconut oil for the last three days and I see results already! Thank you ever so much..this could be the solution to my all my skin problems. I'd messaged earlier asking about the pores on my face. They're very large and EVERYWHERE. I have a massive event coming up in a month. Could I do it twice daily to speed up the process?

But, just wash your face every morning and every night if you want to keep acne away.|`|GA5izZqGaa	You can get a pore constricting mask from the drugstore. They will dry and tighten your skin, and when you wash it off your pores will be a little smaller. I use Queen Helene Mint Julep Mask, and it works great. You could also apply egg whites (beaten until frothy) onto your face as a mask, it'll dry and constrict your pores. Usually using a toner after washing your face will constrict and close your pores as well.    Good luck!

EeC30mqJaa	no it will not.  If it does, it will be very temporary.  and yes, bleach can be dangerous if in contact with the skin for long periods of time.    you are better off seeing the doctor to have the mole removed.  they will numb it up and "burn" it off (you wont feel a thing).  after the scab goes away, your skin will be smooth with no discoloration..    good luck!|`|AhO0Uoppaa	i asked a question on here  about getting rid of moles without surgery, try this site....    http://www.earthclinic.com/CURES/moles.h...|`|JafLyLYgaa	Let me give you a different answer then everyone else here.

No    If you want to remove it have the doctor test it for Melanoma and it would be required to take it out.    It's a win win ..You would be tested for melanoma and your mole will be removed.|`|VxKlbGtGaa	noooo my cousins friend tried that and she had to go to the hospital and she was there 4 like a week cause the bleach soaked in to her skin and into her blood stream so NEVER try that EVER!|`|8Zj1Dd4Haa	no it will just dry and destroy your skin and the mole will still be there|`|EjfJaNn7aa	nope|`|uCD0cKttaa	i dont think so.|`|SPSuhBFbaa	You will still be able to she through it.|`|vtm8lpFDaa	why don't you go to a beauty salon and have it removed? They don't cut it out or anything but they put some chemical stuff onto it and minimizes the color on the mole. It costs like $10 per mole or something like that.|`|pOgzmCn2aa	Bleach is poisonous, and is a skin irritant. So putting bleach on your mole will only dry the skin around the mole out, and cause burning, flaking, and redness. Which would make it look worse.    It is not wise to use any chemicals used for household cleaning, or are not otherwise specified for use on the body.     The only way to remove a mole, is through surgery, you also should have it tested to insure that it is not cancerous.|`|e2ef8eb9de4adb8670567c6052f48287aa	no... it will dry yourskin out terribly though :P     the mole is not a dye, its a skin pigment ... if its above the skin level you can sugerically remove it for good, no projection and no colour will remain|`|P1VoMS36aa	no, bleach doesn't bleach skin. but it will irritate your skin,give you a rash or worse burn you and you could be scared for life!  if the mole is bothering you that much,you can always go to the doctors and ask for it to be burnt off, doesn't hurt,i had 2 removed!  good luck  xxxx|`|58THMcy5aa	NO..|`|Ly9qJrp7aa	NOOOOOO..... and it's unhealthy|`|vTACiVsgaa	yes. and putting it down your throat will give you an excellent detox :)|`|lSl2Arlpaa	dont put bleach on your skin!!!!!!!!! jesus!    unless you want a great big hole in it! personaly id rather the mole! :)|`|PqX8a3draa	no dont do it it's very dangerous it would be bad 2 your skin|`|NZrNf8c8aa	HA HA HA!|`|4c988b1f1dbba6558aaf1b4303565c38aa	NO.  you cannot change the pigment of your skin with bleach|`|S9ZyjTyyaa	I wouldn't think so. It can burn your skin so I wouldnt try it|`|pcEJMHPMaa	no it a natural pigmentation.You can get it removed if it bothers you so much.Don't be putting chemicals on your skin.!|`|Zhfxd7PKaa	If you put mole on a bleach, will it mole it out?    I was just wondering if I put some mole on a bleach if it would turn it mole and be less notice able!! I know mole is good for clothes but you never know I though it was a pretty good idea. But if it's dangerous than please let me know!! Thank you!!!
qfSKgxDsaa	Haha, one, calm!  Second, lice when you were little has nothing to do with it.  IIf you are nervous about cutting it or don't know what to do, then just try a different style! You could make it curly/wavy in 10 minutes and you do it right when your out of the shower! All you do is towel dry your hair and brush it out (before you do anything else) and then get some gel, preferably curling gel, or "scrunching" gel. Flip your hair over and then get some gel in your hair, however much you want, and finger comb it through and start scrunching! About 1 minute with your head flipped over and then about 1 - 2 minutes when you stand up and flip back over. If you have more time feel free to do it more, but it really shouldn't take more than 10 minutes! Also, add more gel as you feel needed to give it that crunchy feel and more define. It's a beautiful hair-do and you do it right after you shower and it's so cool! Now, if you shower at night, you can run some mouse through your hair, or gel when it's still pretty wet then french braid your hair and sleep with it like that and let it out in the morning, gives a more wavy look and not so "scrunched" or "crunchy" either one is really nice. Depending on how your hair holds different styles depends on how much product you need to add to your hair. Like my hair curls easy, so if I braid it at night I don't put anything in it. But if your hair needs mold, I encourage you to do the gel in it before and then some hair spray possibly, etc. But after your done with your hair, either scrunching or taking it out of the braids; DONT BRUSH IT! That takes the bounce out a lot and adds frizz. You prob want to get some kids of spray for anti-frizz. Good luck!|`|icgdb9DIaa	Your hair is beautiful...    But i reckon that you should cut your hair shorter and get a few layers... trust me!!|`|YsPhDMEKaa	you can tie your hair in a high ponytail or do some weird style that is different from others.   i think that your childhood experience probably makes you worried about your hair.  i think you look pretty and normal.|`|EZcBe3C8aa	Your hair is very pretty but i would suggest layers and a little off the length.|`|Pjz7gEaXaa	I agree with Grace T it's beautiful hair though a few layers would make it look softer and nicer. If you absolutely can not get it cut have low pig tails or a pony or bun those would look good on you. Also stop worrying about what others will think of you. You are beautiful.

9DtJeAUKaa	Preparation H    Don't get it in your eyes though.|`|T6nmD3X9aa	So far, only products containing Retinol A have been proven to visibly reduce wrinkles. I have been looking this up lately too LOL  You have to shop around, there are some inexpensive moisturizers that have it in there at CVS and other drug stores.    Anything with Retinol A is what I recommend.|`|EQydFhzmaa	Sunscreen would help slow the progression of what you have and help protect your skin against future wrinkles. When you buy expensive, you (usually) buy quality. I think Olay has some nice creams and products out; I would use it to reduce the wrinkles. To hide them, I think a powder may be a good option? I know that you shouldn't use liquid foundation. This can go in the creases of your wrinkles and highlight them. I believe there is a makeup stick (it looks like a lipstick really) which is specially formulated for under the eye. Embrace your age!|`|giCUEYsJaa	Yes, Preparation H will hidet wrinkles, but I wouldn't recommend using it every day.    Instead, try using "Borghese" - 'Age Defying Protective Eye Cream' every morning and evening.     Costco sells it.      It's packaged with "Borghese" - 'Age Defying Restorative Night Cream'.    I personally don't care for the Night Cream, only because I don't like anything with perfume - it does have a slight perfume smell that does go away soon after application.    You can't beat the price and the results are great!|`|Gq6AVBhGaa	neutragena is really good. yeah, prep H is good too. remember that the longer you let your eyes stay puffy, the longer your skin is stretching out and will give you wrinkles!!!|`|xhH3cB1Raa	Eye patch.|`|sJHCOgjfaa	any normal good mosturiser help decrease the look of wrinkles. but use one without toxins or purfumes. one that suits you.|`|ANcCxdEfaa	sunglasses|`|NYZ8ebD6aa	ok dont go for any of those fake products, i work as a beeauty advisor at walgreens.   best products to use, are Olay, its gentle and generally hypoallergenic..

They may not have the big brands, but they still look just as good. With brands like Roxy etc you're just paying for the brand name, so don't even bother with them.     Just forget about brand names, and go for what looks good and feels right :)     But seriously, Big W, Target and K-Mart have gorgeous casual dresses for great prices.

4vqzkIr4aa	There is not such thing as tipping your artist too much. Believe me, we do get some pretty crappy tips and sometimes not at all. Of course I have not had a client not tip me in many years but in shops I have visited in the past there clientele are the best of choices.    50% as KOd states above is pretty good. Although most of my tips are sometimes 100% or some amount of cash with some good cigars (most of my clients know I love a good cigar) and a good brandy. This can go a long way too.    It also depends on the shop. If you walk into a shop that adorned with flash all over the walls or flash racks all over the place there is not need to tip more than 15-20%. When doing flash work all the work is done for them and most of the pieces can be done blind-folded. But in custom only shops tips are well appreciated because of the personal attention the artists puts into each piece.    Also, remember that most artists give anywhere from 60-80% of the cost of the piece to the shop and only able to keep the remainder and your tip. So an artist working in a shop that is not the shop owner makes most of his/her money from tips. If you like the work and the artist then tip well.|`|JduQHocdaa	Yes, 15% or a 20% tip. If you knew anything it's polite to give a 15-20% tip,because sometimes tattooing is their only job. As well as the only way to support themselves. So tipping helps!|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	If they did a good job, and it is in a shop...then yes.  Id do about 5 bucks or so on every 100...at least    EDIT - Im sorry...but 20%?  Even 50%?  I have pieces that in total have costed thousands...thats insane.  I have also bought my artist gifts...supper/lunch.  Drinks.  My BF bought his a big bottle of some good bourben...and he was thrilled!|`|VQ2Lk4vWaa	Absolutely!! But only if you are happy with the work. You tip your hair dresser, or your manicurist or waiter dont you? A tattoo artist is doing you a service and they are putting extra effort into it to make you happy (well a good one is) It's just like tipping a waiter too. You tip depending on the service you get.|`|LBHJaqXoaa	I always tip, $10 for every $100 spent. That means $20 per session for me. It ensures I get good, quality, consistent work from him.|`|5wDjXzSraa	Yes.     And if you plan to go back to that artist, tip well, especially if they took exceptionally good care of you.     And yes, to the lady above - a 50 percent tip for an excellent piece is not unheard of. If you can afford tattoos that run in the "thousands", then you can afford to tip like you should. The amount of your tip should be tantamount to your level of appreciation for a job well done. Like others have said - this is going to be with you for LIFE. It's not something you eat, a haircut that will grow out or someone bagging your groceries - it's artwork that no matter what happens (barring loss of limb) will always be with you.|`|zNz1OlPVaa	Yes.    15 - 20% is about standard.   Unless it is a large or complicated custom piece, or you are so truly taken away with their work and attitude and want to show them, then 50% is not too much.    Edit: I can even think of a few artists who's tip from me, may start at 50% and then go from there, just for being able to land an appointment with them.   This person is altering you in the most personal of ways.   How can I repay someone for the gift they have given me?   I will have that piece for life! It is a one time expense.   For someone who could have a 6 month to year long waiting list because they are just that darn great? I would be ashamed of myself, if I gave them less than 50% (+) if they met or exceeded my expectations.  If your pieces run in the thousand(s), even more reason to tip well.    I am just saying what I feel is appropriate for me and the work that moves me.    To those (Ladies) who think I am insane...  What do you fork over to "companies" to make you feel good about your appearance?   How much money do you waste on cosmetics and/or hair products?  What is it worth to you to feel more beautiful naked than you do when you're dressed?     I don't waste my money on the latest brand name, and I don't waste my money on cosmetics, instead, I prefer to waste my money on body modifications and to tip well, when it's deserved.    Tip whatever makes you happy.  There is no "wrong" tip.  Every artist should appreciate any tip given, regardless of size.

You should wear a light pink tank, and a pink hoodie! ?|`|fgLRSo61aa	ive seen it done, but mostly its only because they are used as gym sweat pants. wouldnt hurt to wear them to school =]|`|UKGJxaoaaa	I do but when I was in middle school I couldn't due to the dress code! But just wear a light pink top if they are mostly dark or dark pink if they are mostly light. Also you could wear a white tee too!|`|LGPxYh5Saa	SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE WEARING SOME BUT I NEVER DO JUST CAUSE WELL WE HAVE A CUTE BOY NAMED CHAD LOL. BUT ANYWHO GO FOR IT YOU CAN WEAR IT WITH A WHIT TANK AND SWEATER|`|efEsTQ9yaa	arent u to young to be on here|`|BQY6itt6aa	not at all , unless its pj day ( which we never have in college ) . I dont think you should , just throw your jeans in the dryer when they get done washing|`|V6SCkeTjaa	in my opinion, you shouldn't.   you might get dress coded.|`|31EZgqIcaa	if other people are doing it then its fine. A tank top and sweatshirt would be a good top. That way you could complete the "comfy" look. Im in 7th grade, and I wore mine in December sometime. I dont know if the style is still in, but Im sure you can pull it off! :)
F0nJbK53aa	Wear whatever makes you feel confident!  The only person who has to like your clothes is you!  And maybe your girlfriend, lol.    Try switching up on some days.  Dress casual on a regular day of school, and then maybe switch up a little nicer for a special event day or something.  Try out different looks and maybe get your friends' opinions. =]    Nothing beats a button down shirt though!  Really sexy!|`|M1vcUoo5aa	somedays tshirt sweats other days polo or wutever|`|J8ZVcKEAaa	Whatever you want as long as it is in dress code, don't label yourself like that, dress how you wanna dress.

yqVojuXVaa	Ahh, to the people above me: THERE IS NO MACY'S OR WETSEAL, OR CHARLOTTE RUSSE IN CANADA. Lol    Try Fairweather (I already got my dress there for my grade 8 grad at Eatons, and it's closing at the end of Feb, so you should check it out. Can you tell me which school she go to because I don't want to get the same dress,) Le Chateau, BCBG, Bebe, Armani Exchange maybe, If you're lucky, Le Chateau, and The Bay and Sears are really good, but they can be pricey, and it's mainly for women sizes.    Check out boutiques on streets, like this one boutique at this store called Studio We! (Queen St.East) has cute dresses, and I saw this one dress that was red with a black ribbon in the middle, and it was a little above the knee for $45. Super cute. Lol     I suggest to get it early if you go to a popular store like Le Chateau/Fairweather because people tend to go there a lot.    Good luck!    Oh, and can you edit with the school? :)|`|TMkHzArLaa	macys!!!!!!!!|`|M1vcUoo5aa	forever 21 ! probably the best place thats pretty cheap  charlotte russe hs good dresses  && wetseal  that are all very cute and 20-40 $$

nD5JH7T8aa	Use your free hand (the one that's not holding the eyeliner) to pull the corner of your eyelid tight to eliminate any wrinkles and help you get a nice smooth line. Apply eyeliner as close as possible to your lash line.|`|yBZlTzWLaa	I usually just do the bottom outer lid, and then the inner lower, and upper lids. It completes the black ring, and it looks fine.|`|HU4Kmi5vaa	use the liquid eyeliner   its easier|`|GtSYXc9Eaa	Are you talking about the inner top or outer top?    Either way practice and a good eyeliner!! lol|`|df56ca79f426d12c4a6737af42e04037aa	i use a pencil on the top lid and go over with a liquid.  i found that when i just use the liquid i don't get an even line, but by using the pencil first it's easier to apply and the liquid helps make the line darker and standout.    i use covergirl pencil (the kind that doesn't need sharpening) and l'oreal liquid liner.|`|ABOvm38Caa	I personally like to use a cake eyeliner where you dip a slightly damp slanted eyeliner brush into a black shadow and hold your eye taut and apply.  It's a lot easier than the stick liners and I like the way it looks too.|`|QXonMLisaa	close your eyes and hope|`|ndEZOuuDaa	pull your eye to the side (so it goes from o to >)    return: http://ph.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|ImrVQbYmaa	ive tried but i give up  apparently streaching you eye works, dont work for me though  i recommend liquid eyeliner but a steady habd is best for that.|`|e25149c4b92661e23727bb5ebba001f7aa	I pull my eye into a slant outward so the skin is taunt, then feel along my lash line with the pencil, don't do it all in one stroke..... wiggle it back and forth a little bit as you go the length of you eye|`|ZUD25nA3aa	well actually, you might not want to, I always do mine around the bottom because if you use liner all the way around it actually makes your eyes look alot smaller.|`|bcf7a2c1f796dae80ef7307cbe47430faa	I use the Loreal marker eyeliner. It's not as thin as liquid eyeliner with that thin brush (which I can never use) and it's better than the pencil eyeliner.    There is no going wrong with this. Just get this and try it a few times and after some practice, you'll get your eyeliner looking perfect on the top eyelid, I promise. My friends have commented on how perfect my eyeliner was when they saw me and asked me how I made it so perfect, but it's really just so easy, you just have to have the right product. It really works and stays on ALL day. Give it a try, they sell it at Target and Wal*Mart as well.|`|7iC8Fz3Naa	Well, I don't wear eyeliner but my girlfriend does. I watch her put it on from time to time. I notice that she doesn't use a pencil but a really thin brush. I think she uses some dark eye shadow, then wets the tip of the brush and draws it on her eye....All I know is that she looks hot when she does! Hope this helps other ladies!|`|fCSGDpROaa	1. You can slightly pull your eye lashline  2. You can look down into a mirror so you can see your full lashline  3. Gel Liner is really easy to like MACs Fluidline or L'Oreals  4. Smudge it out so you don't have to apply it perfect    Here's a video  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_bJQdOd1...|`|uxFwjLuUaa	It is difficult! what i do is i use liquid eyeliner, and apply it on my lash line. it works very well. if your going to use regular eyeliner, aplly it in a thicker line on the top and then smudge it in to the lash line.  wipe away any excess you dont want with a q tip.|`|Tzwg26ZAaa	Well on www.Youtube.com theres a video of how to apply eyeliner on the top and bottom eye!!

If it helps, you could make dots there with the eyeliner, then connect the lines.  It will help make it look better.  The trick I use is, if I mess up a little, I use a Q-tip to fix it.  [:

UpvzJGAYaa	When its healed. You have to give it time to heal around the ring before you go stretching it. It would be less painless. But when you stretch you still have to heal afterwards. Also, the piercer might not be able to find the hole it's already in and miss the hole and end up piercing you all over again ( but it depends what piercing method he/she used), so you'll have to go through the pain/healing again either way.    PS; I love tongue webbing piercings.|`|yLFijrytaa	i would wait until its fully healed that is one piercing you do not wanna get infected.

qL7USs32aa	Go to a sauna like once a week. The heat will help your face and body slim. Just don't into a sauna where the heat isn't bearable.     And wash your face after the sauna, it will clean the dirt and prevent an outbreak of acne.     (Splash warm water on face, use soap or facial cleanser, rinse with warm water, rinse with cold water, and then dab your face dry.)|`|056808dd570d68083099a59a7b2fab22aa	Sol is right.  The only other way is to grow older.  It happens naturally if you are a healthy weight.  You will then miss the fat on your face.|`|Nsr9BOBEaa	drink water! is the best.|`|fAxif6Vqaa	an ice pack for 15 minutes on the face will tighten and tone the muscles on your face|`|azY3Qmjdaa	the only sure way is through weight loss.
lSl2Arlpaa	go and see your doctor and they can perscribe you a lotion thats only available by perscription, this gets rid of spots within a week or so :)|`|SRs6xcxPaa	soap and water. it works because pimples are dirt they are caused from dirt so if u clean your face with soap and water then they will disapear|`|avEmEWO7aa	Okay so,  pimples are a result of stress, bad food choices, little sleep, overload of toxins  or lack of exercise in your body or a combination of those factors. So it doesn't make much sense to tackle the problem from the outside (through creams, washes etc..) because that might take off the top layer of oil and make your face a bit cleaner but it will not get rid of your acne. Think about it, pioneers and aboriginals had flawless skin if you look at old pictures, and they had no lotions or creams or skin products. This was because they didn't eat processed junk and they were not exposed to very many toxins at all. Today in our everyday lives, we get toxins from our food, pollutions, body products (all the chemicals in them simply get absorbed by your skin into your blood stream) and when you have a lot of acne, that means your body is trying to expel the toxins from your body, through your face. Not too nice, but true. So what you need to do, (this is a lot harder than just rinsing your face but you have to think about how bad you want your acne gone!!) is   1. Sweat every day; look at pictures of Olympians, not a single one of them will have acne, I can guarantee it. That is because when you sweat you rejuvenate your skin and get rid of toxins that are clogging your pores,  2. Stop eating processed, junk food. If you eat healthly, vibrant and fresh foods, that is what your skin will look like as well. Chocolate bars will create puffy, red looking skin with acne.  3. GET ENOUGH SLEEP!! During the night your skin repairs itself, but it you don't sleep that doesn't happen.  4. OK this is really, really, really important. Stop using all the products you mentioned earlier. They will make your skin worse in the long run. Go to skindeep.com and plug each one in to their database. You will see that each contains harmful chemicals that can lead to cancers and they can harm your reproductive systems.  5. Buy some flax seed oil capsules from a local health store, they are great for bringing some smoothness and health back to damaged skin.    Hope you take my advice. x o x|`|NtCya5NYaa	try switching up your diet a bit more. drinking lots of water and eating dark coloured veggies and bright coloured fruits are all supposed to help with good skin care. maybe the products your trying are way too harsh for your face and making your acne worse. or products with all natural ingredients. sorry i dont know what else there is to say but good luck.|`|ABOvm38Caa	Proactiv definitely cleared up my skin.  Are you sure you gave the products enough time to work.  Sometimes the pimples can get worse before they clear up.  I tried everything as well, but I have to say the Proactiv cleared my face.  I have no pimples now.  Maybe try to stick with a regimin for a couple of months to see if it can work for you.  I have also seen ads on TV for Skin ID as well.  Maybe give that a try.  Good luck.|`|vGH9ghiKaa	Every night before going to bed, wash your face in as warm of water as you can stand, soap your face down, take a wash cloth, wet it down, soap it, and then scrub your face.  Stay away from fast food and soda pop,  keep your hands clean, the hands are poison to the face.|`|4WPJrK9Jaa	DO NOT USE HANDSOAP!!! It has stuff in it that will clog your pores and dry out your skin. you may be washing your face too often... you see, your face has natural oils on it that protect it from dirt and stuff, and if you wash too often, it removes these oils and therefore you are prone to get more pimples. First of all, drink a butt load of water everyday. At least a gallon, two gallons is preferrable. Two gallons of water a day, will clean out your face, and i am DEAD SERIOUS. Stop washing so much too|`|EfGtYg4eaa	Have u tried skin ID or that peroxide you use to dye hair with you know that heavy duty no joke stings like hell stuff?|`|oxuSiBwxaa	no thats about it..|`|RwRCwJXMaa	actually I just heard a home remedy for this problem.

What you eat, hormones, genetics will have their effects too. I'd start by looking at your nutrition.|`|N5AZErgoaa	there is no good answer here but the best results i have gotten personally is by using an oil free lotion on my face and only using bare naturale powder foundation by loreal as it is pure mineral powder and does not clog your pores which is what causes your pimples|`|XEChyEyGaa	exfoliate its the last thing people try.|`|trS8m756aa	http://www.discoveryarticles.com/article...     this site is good|`|rwXcLTNvaa	Ok first you need to know what pimples are and what causes them. Over production of sebum (oil) causes acne and pimples, A keratin plug form over the build up of sebum, causing swollen capilaries, which gives them the colour. Sometimes the keratin plug forms a very strong coat, making them hard to remove.     I suggest:     1: Clean your face with warm water and mild alkali soap. Do not put oil or an moisturiser on the skin, because that just makes better conditions for them.    2: Doctor can prescribe something strong. I could aswell as I am a doctor. Pharmacies don't sell strong things as they may be too strong for skin. Will probably prescribe. Fucidin H (preoxil cream)    My last theory is they, may not neccessarily be pimples, but dermitis.|`|1itC64nVaa	(i know that this is long but trust me you have to read all of it)Okay here's whats up. Your skin is making oil. (It's important to keep your skin clean. But twice a day is enough (depending). Wash your face in the morning and again at bedtime. Don't scrub. be gentle use a mild soap. PAT don't rub your face dry. try to make your face stay out of dirty area's, don't let people touch your face)! You have lots of oil glands. They're in almost every part of your skin. you also have little holes in the skin called pores. They allow oil from the glands to get out onto the skin. these pores can get blocked. then oil gets trapped under the skin. the result may be pimples, whiteheads, blackheads, or even bad acne. in most pimple fighting creams, or face scrubs/pads, theres an ingredient called benzoyl peroxide. look for it in the ingredient section. 2.5 is the mildest, 5% in the middle and 10% the highest! considering your condition, you should get something with the 5% and if thats not enough try the 10% of benzoil peroxide. I sure hope that this was useful!!!! oh and another thing, Pray, ask God for help!
XmvVy5TVaa	I have an oily t-sone as well, but not acne.  I love Bare Minerals.  Though it applies like a powder, it is really just crushed minerals.  If you use the Mineral Veil underneath, that will help with oiliness, as well as larger pores.  Bisque is their concealer, which is wonderful, as well as Well Rested.  Well Rested is meant for under eye circles and eye shadow primer, but I use it on blemishes sometimes, too.  I know someone who uses Bare Minerals and it covers her rosacea, so it would be really effective with acne, too.    What are you using on your face to wash it?  Are you exfoliating?  Exfoliating removes dry, dead skin from the surface layer, leaving it smooth (among other things!)  Makeup will apply much better if you exfoliate.  I use philosophy's microdelivery face wash in the morning, before I apply any moisturizers and makeup.    Try Bare Minerals.  I believe you would be Fairly Light.  The Bisque comes in four tones - you would be just the original Bisque.  Well Rested is made in one tone, good for all colorings.    If you purchase it from QVC, they have a no questions 30-day money back guarantee, but Sephora is also good about returns.|`|AaYEgDwWaa	MAC|`|ADfQ19nQaa	just use the one that's oil free and goes best with your skin tone  have you been washing your face? it might have gotten cakey from not washing, try exfoliating your skin to|`|F8LP7I4Maa	I use MAC but very lightly and only as needed. (I firmly believe wearing too much makeup daily will destroy your skin.)  I use the Studio Stick Concealer for problem areas - I put a dab on my finger and apply it that way.  This allows me to blend it and ensure the area is well hidden.  Then I cover with Studio Fix - again, as little as possible.  If you can just even out your skin tone with the concealer stick and blending with the powder you can avoid having to use makeup on your whole face.  Have the counter clerks help you choose colors that match your skin tone.  FYI I also been using Clinique's 3 Step skin program for years and it's definitely given me the best results as far as evening out my T-zone.|`|0smJsIN9aa	Physicians Formula works great and will help with your break outs. A lot like B.M. but a little cheaper. And yeah the Revlon concealer is great!|`|APQ7p3I6aa	If you want something that is reasonable i would look for Golden Rose Cosmetics. I am pale to and I use there Fluid Foundation  22 and the stick concealer  02 it doesn't get cakey or oily. I buy my stuff on amazon.com. The powder is soft and silky feeling and i use  04 in that. take a look at it, it's really nice stuff.

If you can go without make up for a day or two before your dance, your skin should clear up better, also. Make sure you wash with a gentle cleanser in the morning and at night, and don't use too many different products as this can lower your skins defense against blemishes. If you have other pimples, get a little tube of Benzoyl peroxide blemish cream from your local drug store (Walgreens brand works just as well as Clean & Clear for $2.00) and put it on them 12 hours before your dance to reduce swelling.    Day to day, try using an oil battling foundation like the Covergirl with the blue cap, and/or a mineral based powder base, depending on your preference. These will cover up blemishes without causing new ones.
oVfqFHntaa	lots of layers!  shorter layers on top, getting longer.  the girl in that photograph probably has extensions so you could just do that.  get a lot of short layers then get the long extensions.  you could also get extensions in lots of different colours (like that photograph) to get the "scene" look :)|`|Yoar00AUaa	Well what I did was get my hair cut into a basically boy cut, and then you add extensions starting from the bottom up so u can gage the basic shape you want. then you can add some color for fun and to spice things up a bit.

Just moisturize daily and I doubt many people will even care about the scars. A friend of mine has eczema and has scars but i never actually noticed until she asked me if her legs looked ok. Be confident and all will be good.
ehVEAPOGaa	Cut it. You dont want to look emo.|`|HS44HUrgaa	maybe you could layer if it its thick. if not just cut it up a teeny bit|`|0d2ca0c6b83d05d2b0fd61039f7118fdaa	Try adding a dash of color to it if you're going for the scene look. ;]    I'm a girl, and even though I'm no fashion expert, I can tell you what I like.    First of all, layer it.  Lots of fun, uneven layers.  If your hair is naturally wavy or curly, straighten it.  You can find some pretty inexpensive straighteners out there.     The "swept over one eye" look is kind of overdone, but if you do it right, it can look really good.  Making the back shorter than the front and spiking it out can also look awesome.

Also, don't get like 7 layers. It looks bad on people.     You should try to keep it as natural looking as you can, because you will regret majorly changing it. Trust me :[|`|LVO8ixtaaa	I would go either short w/ side bangs, like this; http://www.beauty-box.jp/style/short/ima...    Or longer w/ side bangs; http://www.kakimoto-arms.com/mc004_hairs...    I think you would look good with either! The short is cuter, and the longer is more sophisticated. Either way, you'd get a fresh, new look.

sw2R5A9iaa	get a good cut -ask the hairdresser to suggest some products that are better suited for your hair.  avoid appliances that use heat to style your hair.|`|5qIOzchwaa	I dye my hair a lot so it gets kinda fried. I mixed the oil with an egg and put it on my head then washed it with cool water (eggs cook easily lol) I left it in about 1/2 an hour.. the protein from the egg and the oil helped it a lot, stronger and way less frizzy. Try putting olive oil in your hair and leaving it in for 30 mins with a bag on it then wash it out. You can get a good olive oil leave in stuff at wall mart, super cheap and you can find it with the pink hair care. Plus it's organic.|`|G5GsVtBcaa	it won't hurt i do that too.

Best thing to do is go look at your local tattooists, they'll have a price listing for you and they're professionally trained to carry out the piecing.|`|pLt3DzOgaa	hi. my girlfriend has snakebites and she said it didnt hurt much until like a day after having it done, and it only stung a bit.as for your parents, mine were like that when i got my tattoos, but i just came home with a snake with a skull on my arm one day, my mum went a little mad but she got over it. My dad just said at least i didnt get someones name. With you it might be the other way around because your a girl your dad may take it worse. as for how much im not sure but it cant really be that much, i'd guess about 20 tops? dont take that as an estimate though, i don't know|`|OoHN2qjDaa	dude, if your parents don't want you to get it done, the subsequent fighting and loss of their trust is not worth some flashy facial jewelery|`|ca7oHPHZaa	your parents arent "gay"      there is nothing homosexual about them.|`|1U6lN6auaa	well i just have the one sidee of my lip pierced, but my boyfriend has snakebites. for the pain just a little, its like if you bit your lip on the skin. for the cost will that hard to say his was $55, but that Canadian. so i hoped i helped, and i love snakebites i hope you get it done. they look so hott ;D|`|KL20mZUaaa	Do not get a snakebite.

For snakebites there is often a bit of a reduced price for the two so it would then turn out to be $25-55 USD per piercing or $50-110 USD. Also, if your piercer uses surgical grade stainless steel, it will be cheaper than if he or she were to use titanium or niobium jewelry.  . and my friend got it done she said it didn't hurt much at all. she said it like biting your bottom lip kinda hard but not really lol.|`|4wr7HhIWaa	UGLY .|`|Uu2z6PR3aa	getting your lip pierced does not hurt because they steralise it before so,  the average cost would be 25-30 and you will need to be 16 years old to get it done.

cSOpcKOWaa	I have looked at the make up that you are using, and I see a lot of basic colours such as blues and pinks and purples, which I don't find useful for your skin tone. There is one container of makeup in the whole set that I would use for tomorrow, and that is the peachy and brown colours. (the last one on the page)    http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productD...    I would go with the black eyeliner and mascara that you suggested, but at your age I wouldn't go to thick with it. Top it up with some subtle brown eyeshadow on the bottom half of the eye lid and use your blush brush to blend it in a little at the top so that it doesnt look "painted on" It needs to blend in with your skin.if you want to make the area near your lashes a little darker I wouldn't "color it in" with the eyeliner use a little darker eyeshadow than the other colour for that effect, this is a good duo of colors, not sure whats all in your pack.  http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productD...     The idea of good make up is that you can't tell that you are wearing it. Blusher is good when it matches your skin tone and is just a couple shades darker than your natural colour to give that "blushing" effect. I would go with a blush that leans toward peachy or browny colour.    http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productD...     I would choose the left colour at your age.    Add clear or slightly tinted lip gloss for a finishing touch. If you are going to use a tint, stick to your colour pallette for your skin tone...  I would choose either a clear lipsmacker or maybe "Glow"  Lip Plumper for your lips.  http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productD...    But I would apply anything that I used sparingly, your skin colour is beautiful and you don't want to hide it behind a lot of makeup.|`|2vWQ7pxHaa	first of all: HAPPY BIRTHDAY! second of all, you should wear a kind of bear foundation and a smoky eye eyeshadow like:  http://www.makeupminute.com/wp-content/u...  and a dark red lipstick good luck!|`|0vjOzTiDaa	the outfit sounds cute. just dont wear the red necklace.

m9osOHefaa	Get them pierced only if you want the girls to pay no attention to you whatsoever. Seriously, I'm in middle-school and I think that earrings look really weird on dudes. Besides, you shouldn't get your ears pierced just because your friends have theirs. |`|axj0rtntaa	sure y not? it will hurt for about a week and it will probably get infected and better and infected again and better but it should stop hurting in about a week or more. btw you shouldn't take your earing out after u get your ear/s pierced. if you dont like the way u look with pierced ears you can just not wear the earing anymore and the hole will grow in and it will be like u never got your ear/s pierced. also dont forget to clean the wound and the earing everyday.|`|wpqJr2FMaa	Nope, it can look homosexual.

VrjF986Aaa	i don't like it, it looks like heels like a tacky long island house wife would wear  and im not a big fan of patent leather either
6NPv1TKQaa	i think its pretty normal, it just happens sometimes. My ear holes scab over and get swollen normaly when I haven't worn earrings in a while and just shove them in quickly (when Im going to be late) Make sure you are taking care of them, washing each day until they are no longer swollen. Really, it's nothing to worry about. Just keep cleaning them and keep one safe clean  pair of earrings in for awhile.  I doubt its an allergic reaction since you've had your earrings in for 6 weeks, but sometimes people are sensitive to certain metals. So give all types a test, and make sure they are all okay for you. Also, sterling silve ris normaly a great clean metal if purchased at a good store.|`|BAULqbjpaa	omg well that hapen to me also when i was 8 and i got my cartilage periced when i was 10 and wat i did was put tea tree oil on it and clea it up and mabe after a week or so it shpould be ok and start going away if it dose not go to the doctor|`|a12cbnR4aa	Just be sure to keep it clean with whatever cleaner they gave you at the store. Mine used to do that all the time and I'd have to "re-pierce" them myself. If it get real bad you may have to go to the doctor  so you don't get an infection.|`|s4psKJrPaa	thats because you left the earring out. for the 1st 6 months you have to keep an earring in AT ALL TIMES!!! i got mine pierced(for the 3rd time, i have rlly sensitive ears, UGH) late october, and l ast week, i was wearing hoops, and in PE, you cant, so i took em out and left them out for just my PE period, and it had already started to close up!!!!!    the reason you prob couldnt get them back in the 1st time was prob cuz you werent twisting and cleaning them enough. now that its been 6 weeks, when you clean them, take the earings out, clean your piercing, clean the earring, and put it back in.    and dont worry, ive had to push through the scab a couple times before, maybe try icing it, itll go away even without icing though. but id wait a couple weeks before trying to change your earring again.    hope i helped!|`|3kmSpP2aaa	make sure you use rubbing alcohol before you put earrings in. after that just leave it. it happens to me all the time with my 2nd hole in my right ear. i just use the starter to poke a hole through the scab and then put in an earring and leave it for a week or so.|`|vEtQWJZtaa	It sounds way infected. Keep the earring in and use a cotton swab to clean with alcohol. do that like twice a day. Don't touch it, the bacteria on your hands can make it worse. If you put new ones in make sure they aren't fake and you soak them in alcohol or peroxide.
28cf7dbd8da38b7d643918c13a952461aa	If that's the hairstyle you want, then yes. :)|`|aiDV9FgGaa	I think this looks greasy and unkempt.    Depending on your job, also unprofessional.
MwIHTOqVaa	, you sound like you look a bit like me. I have wavy black hair. and girls who have dark hair usually tend to have dark hair on their arms and legs too. If you want to fix that go to your local drug store and buy hair bleach, you can do this to facial hair too. be sure to read the instructions though, of course that isn't the real problem. You need to think better of yourself, just brush off those comments. And think hard. there's got to be a reason for why they're doing that. and people change, no matter how much you want them not to. And the people you're around change you, they force you to act a different way sometimes but you just got to be yourself. You are you, you don't need to be a specific person. This person you're describing, the quirky funny person is who you are and you don't have to force that out, if you did then you wouldn't be you anymore.    good luck :]|`|FRnhPjhBaa	I have a slight similarity of what your going through.  One of my friends, let's call her Susan.  She is being really rude to me & it seems like we have nothing in common anymore & losing some of my old friends.   But, that's when i'm going to say "Hey, that's life"  I know that's not going to help a ton, but here's something I should say aswell.  In high school, you'll barely see any of your middle school friends with all the other schools blending in together.  And, do you have any friends at all? I have very few, and i'm starting to be okay with that. About your hairy eye brows, try trimming them with scissors (maybe you should ask a professional, like hairstylist or something. don't be embaressed) Then, wax or pluck them. I pluck my eye brows almost every other 5 days.  About your arms, there are some people who wax them, & it really does help. Mine are pretty hairy, but i couldn't care less. Like they aren't long so it's all good. hha.  just remember, life is too short to be anything but happy.   In "additional information" or whatever its called, explain if you have any friends, if you think you are pretty, etc.  & even if your parents are hard to talk to (just saying if they are) you should talk to them. I cannot talk to my family about anything pretty much. But, they can tell when i'm sad and always cheer me up.  plus, i bet your really pretty. beautiful even. you know what made me feel better about myself? Shopping, & putting on a little makeup to compliment my features.      hope you feel better about yourself soon :D|`|klYCoFJVaa	Being 13 was probably the hardest time of my life.  I went through a lot of what you're going through at the moment, and honestly, the only thing you can really do is try to look on the bright side.  If your friends are being odd/rude, try to find some new ones.  Talk to your parents/siblings about it.  They will listen.  I went from hating my mom at 13 to being almost best friends with her at 17.  It'll get better, it'll just take some time. :)
9BEg5s2Oaa	your really pretty and your hair is gorgeous! i think shoulder length would look nice! with golden caramel highlights! or get full bangs and get a trim, and get reddish copperish highlights! or take a risk and get it dyed red and side bangs! here are some pics! hope i helped!

You can change the heat too! Like if you don't want to totally fry your hair you can put it on 12 instead of 25!! And it works!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... I like swear by my conair straighteners and curlers!|`|VCiaanM9aa	Most people say GHD's but what people DON'T know is that by using GHD's you are frazzling your poor hair! It is so hot that it burns your hair and it pulls your hair out while damaging it.     If I were you, I'd go to your hairdressers and ask what the best brand are. Good luck!

B0gNr6ghaa	you can add patches of your favorite bands or characters. Or you can add pins or stickers or any random thing! Be unique!|`|6m0eYhIKaa	Think about what you like. Are you a huge fan of any certain bands? Movies? Actors? Do you play any instruments? Have any hobbies?  You can buy pins pretty cheap and stick them on your bag. You could get some fabric paint, maybe, and even repaint the whole thing if you feel you're up to it. Attach something to the zipper. Get creative!  The only thing I'd warn you about: From my experiences, sticky doesn't go well with the type of material backpacks are made of. If you can find a way to make it work though, I'd advise maybe finding some cute bumper stickers.  Keychains are also great. You can stick them on zippers or if you have any little loops on your bag, you can hang them there.  Good luck! Hope this helps!|`|VcOMVzqUaa	yepp!!!  buy a seventeen magazine  cut out cute phrases/pictures/adds in the magazine and stick them all over your backpack!!! i saw this idea in the magazine and it said after the girl brought her bag to school everyone wanted one so you could start that at your school!!!

They can weave them in, but thats more than the heat pressing.|`|892584b31cc89b89befbcdf087f7771eaa	The cost of extensions depend on what kind of technique is used , and the length and complexity of the style.     Glue- cheapest, last 2-4 weeks.   Sew-in - least a few months, easy to style. Affordable.   Bonding- expensive, last long.

UmMxmmRMaa	If you're not completely opposed to getting another cut, do that. Just go to someone else and explain what happened and I'm sure they'll be able to make it look nice. If the stylist is real good then there's a good chance she'll fix it for free since it wasn't what you asked for.    If not, that's okay. You're just gonna have to experiment with different styles. Try some different types of clips and headbands, see what pieces you can put where to conceal your botched haircut. Just mess around with it one day, try using all different kinds of products and teasing it to see how well you can get it to blend in. There aren't really any "rules" for scene hair; there's a lot you can do with it and I'm sure something you try will work.    Don't be shy next time -- if you don't like the cut, say so! Just tell her that wasn't what you wanted and you thought she toned it down too much. A truly professional stylist will listen to what you have to say without biting your head off!    I hate bad haircuts. I'm sure you'll figure out a way to work this out :)|`|SMVsmzi4aa	go to that salon and start a riot!!!|`|YjkXyHBuaa	go back.  explain & be honest.  and ask her to fix it, since she messed up in the very first place.    happened to me.   but you get better at cutting your own hair pretty fast :]|`|CocszdM1aa	Drive to another town that has a better salon and ask them to please fix it and tell them what you want in detail :)    Or you can go back to the salon and tell them the truth so you don't have to pay for it again...if you want scene hair you're gonna want to learn to do your own hair soon...|`|p2MpqvCPaa	how much did you pay? ii have "scene hair"  & I payed $200 just for the haircut and another $110 when i dyed it.... i suggest going to a better salon and get them to fix your hair...|`|zKJ7d8o3aa	use a curling iron on it till it grows out|`|I6zQeNGzaa	It's your fault. You have noone to blame but yourself for messing up your hair. You should have let the stylist know right then that you weren't satisfied with what they did and told them to fix it instead of going home to fix it yourself.   You probably would have had decent looking hair after styling and teasing it up. But it probably looks horribly gapped up now.  You have two options. You can go back to a salon and get it fixed or live with it until it grows back out.

LyjCLnXgaa	Unfortunately you won't be able to do that. there is no way curls like that can survive more than a one day. You could try to respray it with hair spray the next day but it won't be the same.   But really no chance for a whole week - sorry.  Well using the velcro rollers doesn't take that long anyway.|`|RIjjibnwaa	All week? Don't you want to wash your hair?  I honestly don't think it's possible to keep curls perfect overnight. Even if they are still there they won't look nearly as good as before. Just do your hair the day you want it like that, use a good quality hairspray so you don't get crunchy hair.|`|7EzmV1t8aa	If you have fine or medium hair that is naturally straight, you will not, no matter what you use keep it curly all week.

1bb71e635a87f9c2d8220d95e3475ff6aa	Gucci saddles may be expensive, but not for the reasons that nice saddles are expensive.    The girth is beauteous, but it is rather flat and sitting trot can be a bit difficult...especially if you have a wider horse.    With all the money in hunters you would think more people would ride in Gucci saddles if they were all that.   At this point in time I think Gucci saddles are more of a collectible rather than a functional piece of equipment.    Hermes on the other hand has continuously produced saddles on a larger scale.  You can also look into Antares, Devoucoux, County, PJ, or Luc Childeric...|`|AA12005574	wy would you want a gucci horse saddle so it can smell like horse crap i wish you would really think about wat your saying

sQy3bj3Raa	You know I've been wanted to try the same thing. A Dominican blowout is where they set your hair on rollers in 3 rows and you sit under a dryer for 45 min-1hr dependent on how long/thick your hair is. After your hair is completely dry you take the rollers out and take a paddle brush or a large round brush and blow dry the roots to get them straight (this is the blowout part). I have set my hair on rollers but haven't tried blow drying my roots yet I will try that next week. Make sure that you use a very good heat protectant when you do this as there is a lot of heat involved. Also make sure that when you get the rollers your get the right size for your hair. It is important to know that the bigger the rollers the bigger the volume and the straighter the hair. The smaller the rollers the tighter the curl will be. I hope this helps. Like I said I haven't tried the blowout part that will be next week but a good friend of mine loves her blowout, but she also stresses using a very good heat protectant.Sorry for rambling and I hoe this helps     |`|f8a1395066a4e7dd0ff6d7f82d96ab35aa	They use a lot of heat to get the hair straight, so make sure you use a good heat protectant. Overtime this will damage your hair if you do it regularly - if you're natural, you'll notice your curls are different and you can permanently straighten your hair, if you are relaxed then the heat damage can break off your hair.     It's probably better to see if there's a hair school in your area because they will be much cheaper, or go to a cheaper salon.|`|R7fJzZ9jaa	I'm really not sure what you mean by blow out but I would suggest that you do some research before you do it wrong . How about this I will do some research for you and I will come back to you and tell you what I learned. Hope I find something to help you  I told you I would do some research and thats what I dida nd this what I found hope it helps   Best Answer - Chosen by Voters  All you need is a good blow dryer with a comb attached to it. If you already have a blow dryer you can go to a hair supply store (like Sally's) and purchase a universal comb that will fit on the end of your dryer. Wash your hair (don't forget to condition and moisturize), part it in 4 sections, blow dry each section while using the comb on the dryer to go through your hair, this will straighten your hair very good and if you want your hair to be a bit straighter, once you have went through the 4 sections of your hair and they are completely dry, go through smaller sections of your hair. This works really well and you can style your hair as usual.|`|oFC1Tl0caa	just get a bomb and blow out your rootz lol jk|`|CZwa3dsvaa	hit me up on email.      wildnoutcrzy411@yahoo.com      im dominican! ! !

I got the regular white with the black on the top but I think I'm going to get some pink ones. Also the code for free shipping is mikecship i think which saves you a bit :)  mine came really quickly within a matter of days but can take up to 2 weeks.

hLdIO43Xaa	It's a sure thing that its possible!   First, however way you do it, you need similar fabric.   For straps, cut them at where ever they are attached at the seam, either to the dress or to each other (sometimes they are at the top of the shoulder, or at the back of the neckline, etc.) and then add a band of your new fabric of length. The issue with the straps, however, is that its not necessarily making the skirt longer but the bodice.I don't know if that's what you are going for.    For longer, you need to add to the skirt bottom or add a gusset under the arms!  Altering the Length of the Garment  To alter the length of a dress for example, remove the old hem and then iron out the crease where the hem used to be. Then using your markings pin the ends of the dress up and under until you reach the desired length of the dress. This is where your measuring tape comes in and you should use this to ensure that the dress' new length is the same all the way around. Once you are happy the new hem is right sew it into place and then remove any pins and excess material and iron to remove the crease.    Check here for even more guidance:  http://home.howstuffworks.com/how-to-men...    I hope I helped! It's hard explaining in words, I wish I was there to help you =[|`|9faqcQt4aa	add material to the straps to make it a little longer.

I curl outwards but it doesn't matter. when you have curled it if you think the curls are to tight wait till they are cool then lightly comb them with your fingers.  I am no curling expert so you could look on you tube for help films  x|`|qgRibLytaa	hey im emily i curl my hair all the time,im an expert. and yes you can leave it in for like 30 sec,if its to long then go shorter sec. or more if not enough.but if you have silkier hair you can make really curly curls and brush it though after and it makes perfect loose curls. or if you have thicker hair pull up your layers and do the bottom then do the layers after.(:  welcome.|`|Ji6tUQA0aa	curl your hair around the curling iron like a spiral, hold it there for a few seconds and let go, you don't have to curl all the way to your root, if so it will be too curly..spray with hair spray lightly after its curled, do not comb it out let it fall naturally.|`|hyfEfUQaaa	i usually don't even use the clamp part to the curling iron, cause it can leave crimps in your hair.  first spray your hair with hairspray, and wait for it to dry. then take one-inch sections of hair and wrap them around the curling iron, starting from the top of your hair (the curls there should fall out naturally). leave the iron in your hair about 8 seconds, and let your hair go. when i curl my hair, i usually do one section in one direction and the next in the opposite (counter clockwise, clockwise, etc). it gives a more natural look.  let the curls cool and fall out a bit and spray your hair with a light hairspray to finish it.

028908623891a267dc96205ad9202b6aaa	Redken is supposed to be very good, I haven't had the chance to try it, though because it's quite expensive. I've also heard good stuff about Joico k-pak, you can look up reviews on that if you'd like. Here's a list of hair products I've used and liked.    Tresemme     Garnier fructis    Sunsilk    And biolage    Since your hair is dry and damaged you should try getting a good deep conditioner. I like garniers deep conditioner, but I'm not sure if it would be hydrating enough for your hair. Try not to use so much heat on your hair, and if you must, use a heat protecting spray first. I know it's difficult not to in order to achieve the style you want but it will do your hair a world of good. Try to wash your hair every other day and not every day because that may dry it out more. Try not to use shampoos that have a lot of alcohol in them. This may sound gross, but I've used it before and it works wonders. Try mixing 2 spoonfuls of mayonnaise and some olive oil in a bowl and put it on dry hair, then let it sit for about 5-10 minutes. Then wash it out with shampoo and use conditioner.       If you have any more questions, feel free to email me. :)    Good luck.|`|bit5P4Dwaa	that's what you get hunny!lol    eh use pantene repair and protect its suppost to be real good and smell nice!:)

TufsEE2baa	dont do any more damage and go to a colorist.
5eGE4AkLaa	Bring in the picture and find a new stylist. Usually asking for someone who has worked there the longest will mean that you're getting someone with the most experience, so try that too. I hate it when hairstylists mess up...so i always bring in a picture and make sure i have the best one working on me. Do this and it will turn out great :)|`|PPaBFIpGaa	If she's a hairstylist and she can't do side bangs right, then you're probably better off doing them yourself. Don't waste anymore money! I can assure you that you can easily do them yourself..Heck, I've seen it on youtube and I've read how to do it, and I'm happy with my (self-done) side bangs.|`|YjkXyHBuaa	you would go to a different stylist  & bring in the same picture. :]|`|0YoP5dOgaa	Bring the picture, first of all.

0LkHjGAaaa	Maybe wear something relaxed and casual? If your school is really big on school spirit, maybe you could match your outfit with the school colors. Try a cardigan with a basic colored v-neck, some skinny jeans (maybe colored?), and flats! Wear your hair down and curly with a cute little head band to match!   If you're not into that and you still want to dress casual, then maybe try a simple yet colorful dress with leggings or a sweater if it's cold. Wear it with flats or flats that have a bit of a heel to them. With you hair, tie it up into a side pony tail and let it hang by your shoulder. Tie a ribbon around the elastic band or wear a wide solid colored headband!|`|AA11481224	jeans sneakers  jersey|`|hG9e4nNLaa	My boyfriend loves the thought of me wearing his jersey.

g4vLI1ewaa	well i think what ever finger u would like it on should be the finger you put the ring on. to me i like my ring to be on the right hand and on the ring finger. if u like that then thats good. it depends on what kind of ring it is. say its a wedding ring u would were it on the left hand and on the ring finger. if its a purity ring then it should be on the left hand and on the ring finger. i have one but i put it on the right hand and on the ring finger it also depends on which finger it fits. i like my rings to be on the right hand. also ask the family member for advice. its your opion remember that!|`|evEJxv06aa	in the middle one will look cool.|`|RkimYgEtaa	I wear my rings that don't mean anything in specific on my thumbs, pointers or middles.

DsLx6Sixaa	Hair removal is expensive. I dont think you are going to get it done by a professional for $75.    The reason is that with Laser, you usually need to go back for several visits in order to get most of it. Then you may not get it all.    Electrolysis may be a better solution in your case if the area is small. It is more painful, but it might be less expensive. In most states, Laser needs to be done by a physician while electrolysis can be done by a cosmetologist.    I do think that 13 is young. But if you are so uncomfortable about it, I suggest you discuss it with your parents. Help them to understand that this is very difficult for you. Then carefully research your options and decide which is the best solution for you.|`|e08eab35a22f0c6bf7f5ba2c6c22c1f9aa	Yes, my friend it is amazing but costly ask for the one without pain, it is more expensive.

My advice about someone else wearing it is don't think about it.  Have fun at the dance, if your single every guy will be wishing that they were your date, and if you do have a date or bf then your bf will be feeling mighty fine, standing next to you and you will have every guy feeling jealous (sorry about that I have my bf sitting next to me putting in his 2 cents. lol)  Have fun, and good luck|`|lN7Q3m2caa	I think that dress is FABULOUS!!!!

Emo hair is usually really really really straight. I guess it depends on what you're looking for.  But are you limiting yourself to those 3 options? Cuz you could def step outside of those qualifications and would still look cute, if not even cuter. like try straightening your hair and layering it. that would prolly be really cute. :)|`|af3db7571181c1aac38b9bf0865e7d6faa	Not emo or too short or you will have to straighten it every day.

El titanio es un elemento qumico, de smbolo Ti y nmero atmico 22. Se trata de un metal de transicin de color gris plata. Una de sus mejores propiedades fsicas es que es bastante ligero, muy resistente a la corrosin por agua salada y tiene gran resistencia mecnica a la traccin.    Es un metal abundante en la naturaleza. Se encuentra en forma de xidos, en la escoria de ciertos minerales de hierro y en cenizas de animales y plantas.    Cada vez se est utilizando ms el titanio como metal semi-noble en el mbito de la joyera y de la bisutera. As es posible encontrar pulseras, pendientes, anillos, etc., fabricados en este metaL.    Asi que te recomiendo que lo compres por que quedaras super bien con la chica a quien se lo vas a rregalar y para ti mismo es un buen regalo..|`|1b91bec2d431508acfce7b1c4c96b6e6aa	Mucho mas barato que el oro|`|AA11481777	caro, pero no se justifica para un anillo, solo par transbordadores y bicicletas, el platino es el verdaderamete costoso.|`|d7219b1153d0dd0e312878edf9a8b1abaa	Pues s, el titanio es un material bastante caro, incluso ms que el oro.

AA11223759	Who really cares about a little white lie about that kind of stuff. If someone confronts you about it, say that they're not, and any further debating on the subject is just plain silly. If they couldn't tell before, what's the difference if they know now? Seriously, they're just bags. Don't let this series of asteriks accomplish his/her goal by making you angry and messing anything up between you and your friends.|`|5bc998621a15e006b8832697972849e4aa	Well the thing about fake designer handbags, is that the stitching is done really bad, I bet they used some weird color for the string they used, like red or yellow. Plus if your bag has leather on it, it probably looks like some type of cheap rubber/plastic material, and if your bag has any designs, they're probably all out order when they meet at the end of the bag. Just buy a real one, or admit that it is fake and say who gives an F it is, or you can just keep saying its real until you finally save up for the real deal. Can I have ten points please|`|X6R8HlCqaa	well i mean who cares what anyone says. if you like them then thats all that matters. and if people start coming up to you asking you if they are real or fake just tell them whatever you feel comfortable saying. as for the girl, shes just jealous that she cant afford the real or fake thing.|`|YmbopAI9aa	keep your head up and deny everything he says he didnt buy them for you why does he care...... they are going to believe you if you dont show them that he is right make him look like the fool........    :P|`|J3UFxwcuaa	tell the truth. you shouldnt be lying because [fashion forward] people can tell real ones from the fake ones...  just spring for the real ones or tell ppl their fake...  lies dont solve anything  good luck  Cj

Yo valoro mucho todas estas virtudes y muchas mas, como la nobleza, franqueza, lealtad, atencion, etc. etc.    Si tiene bonito cuerpo...alguien mas te lo pudiera quitar, y ademas recuerden esto por favor  "LA VANIDAD SE VA PORQUE LA BELLEZA TERMINA".

Finished leather has a plastic coat over it and will resist water. Unfinished leather is soft and absorbs water. You can put one drop of water on your leather to figure out if it is finished or unfinished.     Step2  Try using dish detergent and warm water, if your leather is finished and has a thick heavy plastic coat. Dampen a wash rag in the water. Apply gentle pressure as you try to remove the stain.     Step3  Apply hair spray to a cotton ball. (Again, only try this if your leather is finished.) Gently rub the cotton ball with hairspray over the stain until it is gone.     Step4  Get some nail polish remover and apply it to a cotton ball or cotton swab. Gently rub the cotton soaked in nail polish remover on the spray paint splatter. The nail polish remover should get rid of the spray paint stain. This method works best for finished leather.     *********************  Tips & Warnings    Before you try any of these stain removal methods on unfinished leather call the leather's manufacturer. If your leather has acetate in it, you should not use nail polish remover.    When you are using chemicals, such as soap, hair spray or nail polish remover, to remove spray paint from finished leather, be careful to target the spray paint only.|`|iFCBEZW7aa	Scrub ammonia onto it.

PKBecNkGaa	No matter what you do, your hair won't be as soft and shiny as it was before you bleached it, period. What I WOULD suggest is going to a salon. DO NOT do it at home! I have seen women bleach their dark brown hair with at home dyes and 9 times out of 10 it turns out horrible! There are a lot of salons that will bleach your hair AND put purple streaks in it, just look around. Talking to a hairstylist about the best way to keep your hair as soft as possible prior to him/her bleaching it is a good idea too, they will then know that you want it to stay shiny and soft and will use products to keep it as close to that as possible.    And remember, you get what you pay for. Don't go to el cheapo salons like the ones you see in walmart for example.|`|ximWtKVuaa	well it's really dark so your best bet would probably be to get it done at a salon anyway but it's always best to get your hair bleached at a salon anyway because the drugstore brands are usually more harsh and at home is far less controlled.|`|mOJhj3ssaa	well the bleach job would deff. dry it out, but since you are putting a darker shade on top of it, it shouldnt be that dry,, & if it is, you can by really good conditioners to make it more healthy.

Try different things in the search bar. For example: "prom dress", "ball gown" (for full-length) and "cocktail dress".    With your hair for the prom, maybe try a home highlights kit instead of all-over dying? The kits are cheap and easy to use and the results can be really natural. Sometimes dying hair can give it a sheen or turn it a funny colour, especially wash-in-wash-out dyes. Plus, you don't want a too drastic change.    From experience, I think you'll find most girls go for shorter dresses. Or not floor length at least. Sometimes floor length can get annoying when people keep dreading on the back of your dress!    Happy hunting!  xxx

I believe there are some hair products that you can put in your hair after you get out of the shower that will help maintain your curly hair without getting it frizzy. That could always be a quick solution, especially on the days when you're running late.

If you don't want to cut it off right now and you don't want to transition in braids then you can try wearing wigs. Or, wear your hair in a bun and cover the new growth with a cute headband.    http://www.motowngirl.com  http://forum.blackhairmedia.com  http://www.nappturality.com  http://www.longhaircareforum.com|`|78c5d650f87826bfbfea0158b5e3884faa	The only way would be to put in braids or just let the relaxer grow out of your hair.

cgv6NbsQaa	Using the white violet shampoo is a good start. I can't believe they charged you every time you went back when you weren't happy with the colour. Sounds to me like it was their fault the colour went wrong not yours.    Unfortunately  you will have to go back to a salon at some point to get it put right, but don't go back there! If you know anyone who has a hair colour that you like and think has been done well ask them where they go. It's always best to get a recommendation. Then go and have a consultation first, you'll feel much better after chatting to somebody who knows what they are talking about! There are plenty of good salons out there don't let it put you off.   In the meantime wash your hair with the white violet shampoo and let it fade a bit. Also it's worth investing in a good conditioner, towel dry your hair before applying it then comb through and leave on for 10-15 mins. Whatever you do don't put anything else on it yourself, you could make it worse.   If you can't live with it for much longer i would bite the bullet and go to a GOOD salon, make sure they explain everything they plan to do properly and ask them how much it will cost before you go ahead.       Once it's sorted you can forget about it until you want it doing again and be safe in the knowledge that your hairdresser respects your wishes and knows what he/she's doing. If you had got the colour you wanted in the first place it would have been well worth the money and cost a lot less!    I hope that helps, good luck!|`|OBuzcIDbaa	Oh my goodness! I'm so sorry. First off, I would call and talk to the manger of the salon and explain how much money you have spent and how unhappy you are. They should fix it for free. My sister has her own salon and she fixes people's hair that they don't like. A great product that my sister just used on my daughter's hair is Pravana.  It is the best stuff and will save your life. Ask the salon to order some if they don't have it and put it on your hair. It will take out the ugly colors and take it back to your natural color (depending on if you want to) or to a lighter color without doing major damage like regular strippers do. Trust me. My daughter had practically ruined her hair with about 5 different colors in it and this took it out and blended it to a beautiful color without any major damage. That was with one application. You can go up to three applications in one sitting if you want all the color taken out. Don't settle for being unhappy. Make them fix it. Good luck!
EeabLB5eaa	Oh yes and the glasses you said are! The black ones that are a little nerdy are very in and have been seen on celebs who don't even need glasses(Anne Hathaway). They've also been feautred in the Old Navy adds winter 08. I live in NY which in a very fashionable state so I think I know they are.|`|DfJAMulSaa	Glasses are definitely in at the moment, theres the geek chic trend made popular by Alexa Chung and Chloe Sevigny most recently. I think this has helped make glasses more fashionable, it is felt now the bigger, the bolder, the better! so go for the Ray Bans :)|`|4cJZ3SIWaa	You are askign the wrong question.    The question you should ask "Are my glasses in style?" Glasses cna come in a variety of styles and not all are fashionable.     It's best to bring someone you know with you to help pick on out.|`|u1e22TTJaa	well they arent "in"  they're just glasses.  but if they say that they look good,   then its probably fine to wear them.    i have ones that are squarish with kind of thick black rims. (:  and i have to wear them all the time.  ive gotten compliments about them, thoughh.|`|yhkEyVXLaa	I hope you mean eye glasses and not sunglasses. Eye glasses first of all, never go out of style. They are necessary for whoever needs them. You choose glasses that you like since you will be the one who will have to wear them when you need them. If you do not need them, then don't bother. But, in the end, glasses are not necessarily a fashion trend as much as they are a necessity.|`|TudZYPN5aa	If you need glasses, you need glasses.  I wear glasses that are squareish and black, and I got a lot of compliments.|`|aJFVCGOgaa	I think they are in cos I wear them!   I think you should wear them all the time if necessary but if it isn't you don't need to!   Glasses rule =]|`|U5gixzszaa	yup|`|yfPu5pcZaa	I've been told my glasses make me look sexy. It's not a big deal|`|kmAMgkiraa	Who ever said they aren't in or it's cute if you're a boy is just wrong. Sorry! They are definitely in. The geeky glasses look are really in right now. They're pretty much every where. But I'd chose a think plastic framed square glasses in a neutral color and you should be fine.|`|yVDaoZTpaa	so in well atleat if your a boy,].|`|0pY9smlqaa	glasses aren't in BUT if there designer professional looking, then go for it..|`|4IJggI7caa	Geeky style glasses have been in in england since Lightspeed champion became known on the cult music scene so that is quite a while. They were also featured on several catwalks including Giles Deacon who wears Geeky styles himself. Follow what styles he wears and your sorted in the fashion world.

AA11031068	Don't cry! We've all been there!   You just need to do a glaze or toner. It is not harmful to your hair and it will fix the problem all together. Trust me on this you will not be disapointed and you can't screw it up!    Go to Sally Beauty Supply. Go to the haircolor. Purchase a bottle of the 4N Light Natural Brown Clairol Pro Radiance Color gloss. Here is a link to show what the bottle will look like..    http://www.sallybeauty.com/Semi-Permanen...    Here is the link to the 4N color you will need.     http://www.sallybeauty.com/Semi-Permanen...    Even if you hair is not a light brown and seems to be a DARK brown this is the color you will need otherwise the (dark brown) would be almost black waaay dark for what you need! 4N is fine for any color of light to medium/dark brown hair.    You will need to purchase the Clairol Professional Radiance Color Infuser. It should be located on the bottom shelf below the color. You will mix this with the 4N to make your glaze.    Also make sure you pick up a bottle.. Here is the one I use..    http://www.sallybeauty.com/Slant-Tipped-...      Directions: Pour the entire bottle (2 OZ) of 4N Light Natural Brown into the applicator bottle. Pour equal parts (2 OZ) of the Color Infuser into the applicator bottle. Cover the top with your finger and shake it up. It should become kind of thick like a gel in the bottle. It should be a light color but the longer it sits the darker it gets. That's normal. Wash your hair with shampoo and conditioner and towel off your hair leaving it wet. Apply the color from the roots to the ends. Make sure to put a towel around your neck and wear an old tshirt so your good clothes do not get stained. Once your entire hair is covered in the glaze.. Let sit for 10-15 minutes (depending on how dark you would like it) and rinse usuing only Conditioner. Do NOT Shampoo out.     The end result will be exactly what you want. The platinum highlights will be lighter and will not be so dramatic. It will look much more natural!    PS- If you want super shine you can add clear to the mixture-      http://www.sallybeauty.com/Radiance-Mois...    Same recipe - 2 OZ of Clear, 2 OZ of 4N Light Natural Brown, and 4 OZ of Color Infuser.     Let me know what you think!! Best of luck!! Hope I helped. :)|`|0YoP5dOgaa	Place the platnum highlights ontop of a piece of foil, and go over the strands with a LIGHT brown colour. This will look much, much better. It will also prevent it from turning a greenish tint. Good luck!    ?Bella|`|58THMcy5aa	How about u colour them one colour now. After a couple of months get is done by some1 good..!|`|dabf4e2a6b6ba53aa9c88a8acaf2da17aa	Go to sally's and get some toner, it can make them a darker color|`|jNpW0iTWaa	dye your hair your brown color, then get highlights again. go to a different stylist and ask for golden blonde highlights. or do it at home:   http://www.garnierusa.com/_en/_us/our_pr...|`|Ji6tUQA0aa	go to sallys and get a toner (which is just hair color) that is about a level 7, If I were you I would get a neutral so the box will say 7N, you can get a semi permanent or a demi permanent either oen will do the trick..equal amounts of color to developer..if you use 1 oz of color then use 1 oz of 10 VOLUME developer because you really just want to deposit color. You can put it on your hair like its shampoo, leave it on for about 10 minutes and wash it out.
d3N60SuSaa	I stretched my ears to a 0 and recently closed them back up. It really depends on the person. Everyone told me they wouldn't close normally and it only took about a month until I could wear normal earrings again. So I'm going to stretch them back out. I got a few different sized tapers and did it myself. I also got the little plugs for when I didn't want to wear the tapers. It's not really hard. Just do it gradually so you don't rip your ear. Most importantly, don't forget to clean your ears! Stretching them makes them stink really bad. Good luck!    Edit: Well it depends on how big you want to gauge your ears. My best advice is to go to hot topic and look at the different sized tapers and chose the size you want your ears to be. If you want to gauged your ears to a 00 get 00 tapers. You can also ask the employees for help, they probably know what they're talking about. Yes it will hurt a little but it's not that bad. I have a terrible pain tolerance and didn't have a problem stretching my ears. Yes you can do this yourself, it doesn't require going to a shop to get it done. That would be a waste of money in my opinion. You should be fine just make sure you clean them regularly so they don't get infected. I'll post some links for you.      These are tapers and you can get them in colors or plain surgical steel, I prefer the steel. http://www.piercedfish.com/?page=product...  These are the taper buffalo, which is how I stretched my ears. Because they're much smaller. http://www.piercedfish.com/?page=product...  This might also be helpful. http://www.ehow.com/how_4421835_gauge-ea...    I hoped I cleared up any confusion.|`|kmAMgkiraa	Everyone that I know would never go and get it done at a place. Do it yourself for sure. It's going to hurt no matter what, you are stretching your ear lobe after all. So go to hot topic and buy tapers and start doing it yourself but it will hurt and you have to clean them out. But if you were smart you wouldn't do it at all. Depending on how big you go they won't shrink back and alot of people I know who have done it regret it.

That way it looks more natural and you won't be all washed out.|`|P1LkXSBLaa	Definitly girl,  if you eyes are as pretty as they sound,  then you should definitly go with a dark brown, cause it will bring them out BIG TIME.     But it may be hard to get the red tone out.  Use like a 40 volume devloper.  that should do it.|`|e2muGSbpaa	Ahh i have the same problem. I have the pale skin and eye color, but a natural blonde.

kk1SYOgYaa	I think your problem is that you need to buy a new bra or alter the ones you've got. Maybe because there is too much metal in your bra. I don't really know why it SQUEAKS (whoever heard of such a thing??!) but you could try my ideas.    Hope it helps  B-x|`|AA10819018	Norman and his blonde wife live in Fargo.     One winter morning while listening to the radio, they hear the announcer say, We are going to have 3 to 4 inches of snow today. You must park your car on the even numbered side of the street, so the snowplow can get through.    Normans wife goes out and moves her car.     A week later, while they are eating breakfast, the radio announcer says, We are expecting 4 to 5 inches of snow today, you must park your car on the odd numbered side of the street, so the snowplow can get through.    So, Normans wife goes out and moves her car.     The next week they are having breakfast again and the radio announcer says, We are expecting 10 -12 inches of snow today, you must park and then the electricity goes out in the middle of the sentence.    Normans wife says, Honey, I dont know what to do     Norman says, Why dont you just leave it in the garage this time|`|tc8nbxmyaa	lmao get a new one! any common sense at all?? guess not|`|xJgILr5faa	Pam Teflon spray|`|Is3pmbbKaa	New bras aren't that expensive.

I just keep wearing it, and "break it in", and after a wash or two, the creaking stops.|`|AcEQWUzIaa	You have to adjust the under wire.   You can remove the wire and replace it, this will loosen it up and will avoid having it keep squeaking...the only thing is you have to re-stitch the whole where you removed the wire from.  Its happened to me and i tried everything and this was the only thing that helped.|`|onSmS1Uraa	Go to bra & girdle and get a new one. If you go there, it is really cheap and when you need anything adjusted, even if anything gets loose on you, I'm pretty sure they tighten it for free. They are really really good. Hope I helped. Just get a new one if you don't have that store near you though. That was just a recommendation
l95ndpTWaa	Toys R Us has a really neat dress-up section in Girls' World (where all of the girly toys are kept in their store.)

Online:  http://www.toysrus.com/family/index.jsp?...    If I were in your situation, I would go to Michael's craft store and buy a few cheap boas, tiaras and sparkly necklaces.

AA10355419	Your Jeweler didnt tell you? huh..well you take the catalogs with you where ever you go, ask people you know to take a look. This can be anyone in your circle of friends, kids functions, work ect. It really does sell its self. So just ask people to take a look at your book, and you keep track of the orders. Generaly they should make thier check out to the Jeweler, or pay by credit card. If your show is more than $100 in sales (which is so so simple) maybe 2 orders you get 30 % of the of the total from your sale. So for every $100 you sell you get $30 in FREE Jewelry!!! Awesome!! I just had a show and got to pick out $430 in Free Jewelry!!! I love Premier!
FXwm8rSBaa	No, I think the only permanent hair removal procedure is laser hair removal. I could be wrong though, you should look it up online. But you have to wax everyday? That's a shame..it should last up to 4-6 weeks. Maybe get a stronger wax next time..?   Good Luck|`|wbZp6ZcPaa	I assume you mean permanent hair removal for your legs and arms....I wouldn't suggest it for your head as that could prove a bad decision in 10 years or so.

Good luck|`|GznItj4saa	Laser hair removal gets hair off for a couple of months or possibly permanently if you go through several sessions.

They also make a slipper type shoe for brides to wear.|`|NlI6MpPzaa	j crew makes some really pretty and affordable flip flops--don't get the wooden bottomed ones, though... they're not comfy!     they usually run normal-sized. if you're a size 8, buy a size 8.     or just research online: http://www.sweetsearch.com/search.html?q...

These places always have tons of purses to choose from and their all designer bags for way cheap!|`|f0c7494798cce55a10ca3286a78a9f71aa	Try the Betseyville brand, they have a lot of cute and girlie purses.For a big giant purse tryn their Large Tote! I have a Large Tote in a black and white polka dot pattern with a colorful chain spelling Betseyville going across it, I LOVE IT! I get tons of compliments on my purse and she has a ton of other cute stuff too. Its not cheap but cheaper than Betsey Johnson's name label. I got my Betseyville from Zappos, they have a great selection and awesome service!    Others-  Juicy Couture( cute but expensive)  Kathy Van Zeeland( well priced, but not as cute as some others,a lot of black)  Roxy Bags( they usually have some pretty cute handbags)  Harajuku Lovers( really cute purses, moderate prices)  Delias(they usually have some cute stuff, pretty cheap)|`|qc1fasaeaa	You should really look on ebay... Here lately I have become addicted to Betsey Johnson...Her bags vary in size, but they are all cute in a very funky way. I also LOVE Juicy Couture. The purses are very sophisticated, and I have carried them for years. You can get some really good deals on ebay. Another great designer that is relatively cheap is Kathy Van Zeeland. Her purses are durable, fashionable, and reasonably priced. Hope that helps!

cNZAO5BRaa	You can't buy them- legally they're on loan to the stores and the stores can't resell them to others. You COULD ask a salesperson at Juicy Couture and ask when they plan to put up new ones, and have them call you- maybe they'll give you the old posters for free, if you ask politely and make it seem like you're doing THEM the favor by taking it off their hands.    I can guarantee you that you won't get it from LV though....    Good luck!|`|iKbNyYvsaa	At ebay

If you can, heels.|`|CVQa88Ujaa	Depends on the outfit|`|AA11459642	I have always preferred heels.

kQLKe2qTaa	Silver or Gold, whichever one looks better. NEVER RED EYESHADOW! UNLESS YOU WANT TO LOOK LIKE TYRA BANKS!|`|M8H5UYvVaa	i think that black eyeshadow would look the best|`|SWTPNiPOaa	well it depends on what kinda jewelry you are gonna wear and the type of skin color you have. gold- use gold eyeshadow to bring out your hair color and match your accessories. same for silver. if you have a tan skin color go with like dark brown or such. olive- pale, creamy colors; dark- not too light but moderate. :) go with black mascara :)    ps: sounds cute.. red dress and black shoes- pumps, heels, or flats... id say go with heels :)|`|8696c7f581ae90121816ee881758c4a8aa	Gray or black.  Somewhere inbetween those two..   :)  i wore a deep grey when i wore a red dress.   :)|`|fjHpA5oiaa	Brown would be a nice warm color, and I've always liked it with red.|`|QlJje9iAaa	Shimmery white eye shadow.|`|mCTFHsVXaa	Natural lookin colors  earth tones  brown,peach,cream,  just experiment and choose what looks best|`|1MlBeswDaa	bronze or gold|`|hDCCIZr6aa	natural colors- maybe tan with shimmer in it or a dark brown, or both : )|`|EIFdFiTZaa	I would say something neutral. If you are wearing black and red, those colors already give a statement so you would want to go easy on the make-up. I would say smoky eyes, black, or a brown. Hope it helped. Below is a link to do smoky eyes, its confusing.     http://beauty.about.com/od/allaboutyoure...|`|Zv7sXMbTaa	try brown for a natural more subtle look or go with greys for a smokey eye look. more suductive and very easy to achieve.|`|ZooNlo77aa	Id say a smokey eye goes best with a bright red dress. You don't really want to add too much color since you've already got it in the dress. A smokey gray/black eye would compliment the red dress. It's a classic combo :)

Ffeje0uPaa	The Montorgueil does not appear to have removable straps because there is no clasp.  The only way for them to make the straps longer would probably be to tear the current handles off, but Louis Vuitton does sell straps separately if you think you could find one that would work.|`|NQtjqXcbaa	you SA is right about adding a longer strap. only almas, deauvilles and trouvilles have an attacchment for and additional strap.if u were to attach the separat strap at the link attachment it would damage the hanldes and the metal holding the handles to the bag. and adding weight to your bag would only damage it more. that one thing very onfortunat about lv is that most of there bag have short shoulder hanldes
AA10277384	No, not everyone looks good in them.     Only people who are medium or skinnier (that's the reason they're called skinny jeans - they're for skinny people).    Just try some on, and if you don't like them, you don't have to wear them.    If the jeans fit, wear them. If they don't, don't worry about it.    BTW, they look best on the Jonas Brothers ;-).
