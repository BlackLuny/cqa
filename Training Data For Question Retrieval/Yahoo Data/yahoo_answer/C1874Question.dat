20090307171758AAtfLUB	Computers & Internet;Software	Portable Virtual Drive Program on your USB?	Does anybody know of a Virtual Drive program that you can install onto a USB and use on any computer?      By this I mean I need a Virtual Drive program that will ONLY install the required files onto the usb (nothing to do with the local computer), so you can run the program from the USB independent of any computer.      The reason is I will need to run certain image formats on my relatives computer (they're really anal with installing software on their computer).      Maybe if somebody made a custom version of an already existing program?      Thanks!

20090307181721AAX0g50	Computers & Internet;Software	How to set up a shared mailbox in SBS2003/Exchange2003?	Does anyone know the correct way to set up a shared mailbox in Exchange 2003?      I don't believe I want a public folder, I want a shared mailbox.      This shared mailbox would be the equivelant to, lets say, an "IT Service Desk" inbox where anyone who works on the Service Desk would get the one email that was generated by any user in the compnay.      So lets say user1 needed to send an email to the Service Desk inbox.  He's send it to, "Service Desk Inbox" and it would go to ALL those that work the Service Desk.      Note I'm using SBS2003.  I don't know if I have to create a user account first in AD?  And then disable the account?  Is that correct?  Doesn't that waste a CAL?  Either way, how the heck do I do it?       I tried setting up a test user and gave them a mailbox but how do I access it from those that are supposed to actually SEE it in Outlook?      Also, note I do not want to use the, "open other user's folder" option.  I'd really like the shared mailbox (such as the, "Service Desk Inbox" example I gave) to be listed on the left pane right under each user's Inbox.      Help please?

I know that TVersity disables the standard SSDP for Windows Media Player (WMP) and other media servers. The problem I'm having now is that after I removed TVersity (for various problems), SSDP can't be started properly.      I activated it via the services.msc options and set it to automatic. However when I open WMP it always tells me that Media Shares are disabled even though they're marked enabled in the network settings.      Is there any way, without formatting, to reset things to the way they were before TVersity ever interfered with my system?

20090307223611AA31862	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Other - Hardware	Annoying Blue screen of death in vista!?	Hi. I'm running on Vista and blue screen of death keeps occuring. I don't have any specs on me, but I'm running on a laptop.      I log in, start getting into using it. Open explorer and surf like usual, if not that... I use many other applications. But randomly, in the middle of doing something, it crashes. I can't see read what causes the problem because it just crashes with the blue screen and restarts my computer.       Again. It happens randomly, so I can't pinpoint exactly what causes the problem.      Also, what I've noticed was that this problem began to surface after I started leaving my computer on sleep mode all of the time. Instead of shutting down my computer, I took some friend's advice on leaving it on sleep, so the next time it would open the way it was. So it would be a: use the computer, put on sleep for 2 days then every other day I shut it off for a day or until i used it again.       I was thinking this might've caused it too. (overheated my cpu)      What do you think?

I used to be a regular poster on youtube, but my vlogging capabilities were very limited because of my camera. I want a camera that I can take with me any where and shoot a video without having to worry about picture quality or sound. Along with that, what kind of computer program should I get to make these videos. I've heard of something called "movie maker", but that was just in passing conversation. So please, any one with any youtube, computer, camera knowledge...please....help me!!! Thanks a bunch! -Rain

I wouldn't have posted this question if wasn't freaky, but it was!  Im puzzled, because being a PC technician, I know a lot about electricity.  So here is the story:      a couple days ago, the bulb of the lamp blew out.  So i removed the bulb to get the wattage off of it to get a new one.  But, I never turned the lamp off, so it was on and had no bulb in it the whole time.  but just now, the socket exploded and it made an EXTREMELY loud noise.  My ears are still ringing.      but like i said, im a PC tech and i have no explanation for this because the circuit was not compete.  the bulb completes it and there wasn't one there, so it was using no electricity at all.      Im puzzled, any ideas to what happened?      but i mainly just wanted to share this story with someone, it scared the **** out of me, and at 3:30 in the morning, this was the only place i could share.

20090308000439AAEb3Cx	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Other - Hardware	Why is the speed of file transfer sometimes slow on my computer?	So here's the deal: I've been moving things around in my computer. Sometimes I move videos, executables, pictures, documents, etc. I usually move them to a removable disk (USB). I have a Windows Vista computer, and it tells you how fast files are being transferred. When I transfer videos to my phone, I get speeds of starting at 300 kb/s and it gradually increases to around 500 kb/s. Sometimes when I move other files to a removable storage device, I get speeds around 60 mb/s. I am always using USB 2.0 and everything is the same. I'm not running any background programs or anything. So why do the sppeds vary sometimes? Is it because transferring videos causes a slow transfer rate, or is it because moving files to a phone rather than a removable storage stick is slower? I am just curious, so please try to answer my question.

Myspace being down isn't a huge deal to me...there's lots of other websites out there to read up on and actually learn things on.  However, I was curious if anybody was getting the same scenario I am....here's what happens:      I try logging on....and it forwards me to a page where it says "YOu must be logged on to do that!".  This is the page where you get sent if your password is wrong usually.  I've seen a LOT of people complaining about getting an "your account has been deleted" message, but I haven't seen this come up.      At least if somebody can confirm that particular error is happening to them, I'll know nobody hacked it and changed my password on me.

I know a fair bit about web design and coding but i hired someone to make me a web site nd it is online now. but my contract with that company is over. but it seems that the company coded it so it always goes to the "under construction" page. I’ve called our domain name provider, and that is not expired until next year. my hosting company says our web hosting fees are up to date. So after about an hour of talking to different people at these places, I got a guy at MTS that knew what he was doing.  He found out the issue.  He tried changing a few things, but it did not work.  He says he is not that familiar with front page.  His recommendation was to get someone that is good with Frontpage to find out how to change that indexing so that it does not redirect the page. please help. thank you much!!

I delted iTunes Introduction thing, whatever it was called, it took up about 15,000 kb or something.  So I deleted it on accident, and now WHENEVER I try to open iTunes it says Error (and gives the option of Send Error Report or Don't Send).  I downloaded iTunes 7 off the internet and it successfully downloaded, but it still doesn't work. (Keeps saying Error).  I don't know what to do because  I checked my recycle bin and NOTHING I delted shows up.  I don't understand?  I have Windows XP, it's not new, if that helps.  I don't know what to do now because all my music is on there.  Any suggestions, I mean should I delete itunes all together, and start over completely? Or would my music be lost?  Help!  In addition to that, my speakers don't work (they just randomly stopped working).  I tried restarting my computer and checking sound levels.  But nothing seems to be wrong.  What can I do?  Help me, please.  =(
