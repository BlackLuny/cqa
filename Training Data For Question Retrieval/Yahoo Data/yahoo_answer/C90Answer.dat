Leave that to the Faux News Channel and Gush Lumbaugh- SNL is entertainment....and if their spoofs make someone uncomfortable, don't watch it!|`|bPYElgCaaa	You are correct sir/ma'am.
Cg0bgRYDaa	It doesn't seem right really?  I have a close friend who is autistic and personal space is massively important to him.  People with autism can get very frustrated very quickly when their 'system' has been played with.  So when it comes to their personal space, if another child in the family imposes on it, it could frustrate the autistic child to such an extent they could become violent as they do not have the interpersonal skills to deal with frustration in a socially accepted fashion.  <br>  So i think the family should have used the extra space for what it was given, I'm sure they could dress up their reasoning and get away with it.  So wouldn't consider it fraud per say, but not having the best interests of their child at heart, which is a sad situation.  |`|4wJopW4Kaa	Why don't you just anonymously report them to the council, then they can decide if it is fraud or not; or the social services, who will send someone to check on the welfare of the children. It is up to the council anyway, not you or I, so you may as well put the decision in their hands. I don't think it is wrong for children of mixed sex to share a room - sometimes it is unavoidable - but if the boy is violent and there are little ones, it might stop you worrying if you just let someone else know about it. |`|YwdsP4c2aa	What the hell has it got to do with you? There are enough official snoops in this country without mums at the school gates joining in. With four children they need a three bed house and it's up to them, and them alone, to decide how best to allocate space in their house for their children. There are no laws which prevent mixed sex siblings sharing a room.<br>  <br>  To the poster above who queries their right to have a computer - it is up to the parents to decide how to allocate their finances, or are you suggesting that they are benefit cheats as well?|`|oq0jTxppaa	There is a website called the LHA which if you put how many people and of what age they are it tells you how many bedrooms you are entitled too ('ve been looking at it today as a matter of fact) and from the results i got playing around with it if you have 4 children under the age of 16 you are entitled to a 3 bed house regardless of what use you put the rooms to.|`|9e57750ed3c826124966326d438d7e96aa	No it is not fraud. It is simply an example of the modern British pastime of 'playing the system' to gain an advantage that otherwise they would not get. They have the piece of paper that says they need three bedrooms, properly prepared by a suitable professional (at least we assume so) so that's that. Nothing anyone can do, or, in the case of the authorities, would want to do.<br>  <br>  |`|mnn8hYbtaa	why does it bother you anyway? surely with 4 kids you would expect the council to put them in a 3 bed house?|`|0eFEtfgVaa	i dont think anything would be done, with 4 kids they would of got a 3 bed anyway|`|Qbwqrmnlaa	It rather begs the question, how do the dole bludgers afford computers.However,  I have worked with children with special needs including profoundly autistic children. I have know situations where parents have to put aside a seperate room for this child otherwise everything is swiped off the sides and wrecked. I would guess that this family need space to deal with corespondence, relaxation or homework without the worry of this child smashing the computer. How other people live within their own homes is entirely their business. My personal opinion on this is that 3 bedrooms is not enough space for such a large family and even without one child being autistic it is amoral to expect people to live in such conditions. Shame on you and shame on the council.|`|ARAYm7BLaa	no, this isn't fraud, contact the Social Services if you think the children are being mis treated|`|qbzt3r4xaa	No.... Shoudnt be where there are children at concern...|`|bqpdjkRoaa	Well, I cannot see where the benefit fraud is, they are not using the house as was intended by the council but it is such a minor problem that I think that the council will not interfere, as the children get older, they will probably move as much as they can to separate rooms anyway, there are many families that are forced to share rooms because of the lack of room, even two families in one house, the council don`t get involved with them do they?<br>  I agree with you about the child that is violent but this should be addressed as a child protection problem for the other children and not a housing one.|`|9AUmp5jWaa	Everyone including children need to use the computer for homework and other necessities.  It's nice to have it in a room away from bedrooms, kitchens, etc.  Leave it alone.  |`|M7GnRpd0aa	No it's not benefit fraud, but they could be deemed to have made a false application for the house, or be in breach of their Tenancy Agreement.|`|wUQ51VBdaa	no they said they needed the extra space,<br>  which isnt a lie...<br>  so i say if they are happy doing that then thats ok 
IZRcc5Iraa	Give me a break, how can they attack based on character when the republican VP has been found guilty of ethical corruption.  If McCain is so concerned with Obama's past, they need to call for an investigation.  Either that, or focus on the issues rather than the man|`|AA11323988	If you do not think Character is important in the leader of a country then I think you are very confused. Character is the biggest issue when electing a president. McCain has kept his statements truthful and has even come to the defense of Obama on a few occasions when people started making false statements. <br>  Hitler managed to gain power because people did not question character but rather they listened to the hype.|`|yQ6Hiq6Raa	Unfortunately this behavior is appealing to the Lowest common denominator in America.  IMO, McCain is trying to keep the small percentage of votes that he can by bringing out emotion and ignoring the issues.<br>  <br>  It's hard to watch, but times are changing, and if we Americans choose not to change with the times, we will be left behind.|`|AA10752618	obama still hasn't come out about his past in the books nor he chooses to discuss what is he hiding that he associated with muslims???|`|AA10090799	<br>  Was it pathetic when Gore and Kerry did it?

I hear the same thing out of Mccain its just ridiculous some of the stuff that him and Sara P. say... You can tell that if we vote in McCrap that we might as let bush just stay in office.

The ,edia has covered up for their boy for a long time, and it makes the avaerage American sick to watch the traisty that the Braodcat networks, CNN, PMSNBC have become....Lets face it, the avaerage guy out there depends on the Media for real news and information....but this same guy on the street also knows when he's being lied to....if there is an alternative...and if McCain and Palin aren't allowed the opportunity to expose Obama fir what he is on TV....we are in trouble as a nation....wait and see!

If he steps beyond his safety zone, he will explode; and if the American public sees McCain at his worst, they will not vote for him.  The way he has been conducting previous debates is his method of holding back his quick temper.  If many of you want to see him 'fly off the handle' then by all means continue to incite him to do so; that will really help his campaign.|`|9myfqAyRaa	Here's what I say. Thankfully your vision of America is losing traction as the depression era and world war two era people die off. We do indeed have many enemies of America but you guys are starting to sound a bit to much McCarthyish accusing other Americans of all sorts of vile behavior. We don't like it. We're tired of hate politics, we want solutions.|`|5fb5a855a7ba040448a4d2ac98374a7baa	I just hope "debate" #3 is actually a debate, and not a question/ answer only format.<br>  <br>  The candidates need to actually debate each other, and respond to one another's views and comments.|`|niD66AbCaa	He needs to if he wants to win this election.

I hope McCain does try to attack Obama on the Ayers and Wright subjects.  McCain will be crucified.  For one Obama has answered these questions several times before, there is nothing there.  And the past few weeks of the personal attacks by the Republicans have not been effective at all.  McCain has continued to drop in the polls.  McCain would make a huge mistake if he brings up the subject of Ayers at the debate.|`|lvBUl3Zdaa	Breaking out of the debate format he agreed to to spread the lies that you are talking about will only seal his coffin. Any member of the public who did not previously see that McCain's only platform is spreading dirt about Obama will see it. <br>  <br>  This smear campaign is losing him votes. |`|a6k5WZxGaa	More whining from the Right wing.  Obama has been thoroughly scrutinized for MONTHS.  McCain's got nothing but fear mongering.|`|AA10719402	doubt it...<br>  <br>  Looks like you're a lookin' for a debate lynchin'.<br>  <br>  In the civilized world, we debate in a civilized way.. sorry.|`|fDuCamMraa	If McCain doesn't do something to show he actually wants this job, he's toast and the American people are jam.<br>  <br>  <br>  Friends don't let friends vote Socialist!
HMteUyRdaa	I agree with you! We are heading quickly for trouble, if John McCain had blocked of media time on major national stations such as CBS, Fox, ABC and what ever other stations Obama has paid for air time the Media wouldn't have allowed it siting unfairness on the campaign trail, making it necessary for the other candidate to also have blocked out time with the major stations. But since it is Obama and a liberal news media lets look the other way and let this wolf come and lead more sheep astray. <br>  <br>  I completely agree if elected into the Presidency, Obama will bring us to our knees, and our freedoms (the few we still have) will be gone. <br>  <br>  God bless America.<br>  <br>  Alex, if his facts are wrong, then prove it. It is all over the news today about this and the Ayers story is also a little old but the news and facts are there. If Obama was an honest man why would he lie?|`|2a9MLpZRaa	It is what it is. |`|5fb5a855a7ba040448a4d2ac98374a7baa	Yes he lied.<br>  <br>  I asked the same question and virtually every brainwashed sheep of a liberal said "no" he didn't lie.<br>  <br>  It's absolutely astonishing<br>  <br>  Furthermore, in 1997 Obama wrote a  promotional blurb recomending Ayers' book, which if obama had read, would have certainly known about ayers past.|`|EPYTZyYgaa	That is a bit disturbing.  I hate this whole election. |`|8di5Wn3naa	You say "socialist" like its a bad thing.|`|AA10752618	yeah he's lying and vote gop in novenber
ZXkOQapLaa	No there doesn't need to be. Obama has done nothing wrong. IF an acorn employee/s took it upon themselves to screw around with the numbers for registered voters that doesn't mean Obama is guilty of anything. It's not even a punishable offense unless someone shows up election day and starts voting several times. This is such a non issue it's funny.|`|lvBUl3Zdaa	The "relationship" between Obama and ACORN is that they were hired to register unregistered people. <br>  <br>  In the unlikely event that the Republicans were to take power in January, there would be an extensive investigation. Republican lawmakers would make endless speeches to nobody in particular about why it's a bad idea to register poor people to vote, half a billion dollars would be spent, and nothing would be found. |`|trMsK86jaa	Ah, the one absolute i can tolerate.<br>  <br>  Freedom of Information, Absolutely.<br>  <br>  edit: The benefits by far outweigh the risks.|`|a6k5WZxGaa	No because there's no reason.|`|7ccf6629153f5dc1724e3cd5d9ff7194aa	Answer..Not at this time<br>  <br>  Comment...Don't you find it interesting the voter registration cards were all done by the same people in "Battleground" States and dumped in the place to be gone through by the same people at the same time? Voter Fraud is just that..FRAUD!! You don't commit FRAUD by making sure you get caught. This bit of FRAUD seems the perfect way to cause problems and disenfranchise voters.|`|yQ6Hiq6Raa	Obama does not have a relationship with ACORN anymore.  He was only involved with them early in his Community Organizing days.|`|AA11928155	That would be a racist racist racist racist racist racist racist thing to do. Not really but I figured someone would call you that for even suggesting such a thing.|`|AA11323988	There is a known relationship between the two. I know there is an investigation into ACORN's voter registration fraud.|`|AA10752618	yes they are based out of chicago and there were caught in INDIANA giving fradulent signatures to the county electiion board last week....|`|c4c96e87c5e65ad49a7ec667dfb9d974aa	You can't investigate something that doesn't exist.|`|c9bdef5bb31ceed680934e1e0696f061aa	I believe there is. |`|9myfqAyRaa	Yes but it's lost in the forest.|`|Lq4306a5aa	Investigations only happen when there is evidence of wrong doing such as in the Sarah Palin trooper gate situation.  Maybe they should investigate Palin for all of the speeches she made at the Alaska succession movement rallies.  Probably won't for the reason I just cited.  <br>  <br>  Oh, but to answer your question, no there is no evidence of wrong doing on Obama side, so there will be no investigation for ACORN or him being buddies with terrorists or any of that stuff. |`|0ZuHXUwFaa	A lot has been said already,so far he denies any involvement, But he cant deny it to long to many facts are coming out about him and ACORN, His responce will be this is not the ACORN he knew.This man has been fooled by all the people he has ever associated with,Real smart man|`|IasHMWM2aa	No.|`|z9UAnf3Waa	I have not heard of one as yet, but I wouldn't be surprised.  It certainly should be investigated.  We already know his campaign paid ACORN affiliate $800,000. And, of course, it was paid to an affliate.  A check made out to ACORN would be too easy to trace. :)<br>  <br>  McCain/Palin 2008
cWfpkzGQaa	Disappointed. I think he did a pretty good job with his first term, but it went downhill from there. The Iraq invasion was well handled, but the occupation was not. It also seems that he cares less and less about public support as the days go by. He certainly hasn't helped the party any with this current election. While he certainly isn't our worst president ever, he's far from the best. |`|bHI4NLonaa	He did an OK job considering all the mess he was dealt during his presidency. Not to mention all the vitriol from the left.|`|sZFLtCbdaa	Greatly disappointed in him. But he was still the better alternative over Gore and Kerry.|`|jLaDJYJRaa	Disappointed, he certainly hasn't helped us with this election.|`|zoPyYyXHaa	Did well the first 5yrs in office and then started falling apart after that.|`|jQ6RpC0baa	He did some good, some bad, some very bad. Have to go with disapointment. |`|2efqrdTdaa	I hate him|`|bMtBtYDsaa	 Whats yours? You know him just as well as everyone else here.<br>  |`|UEDavzPIaa	He ruined our country.  He has doubled the national debt during his time.  The national debt has taken decades to build up to what it is and in just a measly eight years the debt has doubled!  I am a republican through and through but I really do not like Bush at all.  I don't like him so much that I wish Gore had won.  Our country would be eight years further along in being energy independent and who knows what else.  Now we have taken leaps backwards because of Bush and his administration. |`|KJxDSNcEaa	unsure. the war and now the economy ruined his rep, the media puts such an unfiar spin on him.  i dont think of him as a bad president; he was president during a terrorist attack on the nation, and in my opinion he handled it correctly.  i dont think other prez's could have handled the affair like he did, he deserves much more credit than he is recieving. |`|3IriGlfUaa	I believe that he is a good man that tried to do what was right.  He has made mistakes and a huge one with the economy.  But -- in all fairness, we wanted more oversight of Fannie and Freddie as did McCain but the Democrats in Congress (Dodd, Franks, and several others that were getting kickbacks or whatever) kept telling everyone that there were no problems with Fannie and Freddie.  But, we all know that there were all along!|`|tiUxNLRBaa	He's done a lot, actually... NONE of which has been good.. <br>  I try not to hate, so I wont say I hate him.. but I strongly dislike him.. Which shouldn't be so surprising since I am a Dem. {Sorry} Know you were looking for Reps. <br>  A tough Presidency??? ALL Presidency's are tough........ That is no excuse.. I'm a Dem, and was not a supporter of Kerry, but he said it best when he said, "Going to war with Iraq would have been like going to war with Mexico during (the whole Pearl Harbor thing)" Sorry, dont remember the exact quote..<br>  Bill Clinton was a MUCH better President. The country was filled with jobs, every body was happy, we had a surplus. Then came Bush....................................... The guy cant even read.... 'nuff said.|`|d991366e539664f927a671333175080eaa	We all have our "areas" where we do our best in.  For instance, some people are really good at meeting new people, some are good at sales, some aren't.  etc.  I think that the President did his best but when push came to shove, his area was not in our economy but in the war.  If you're going to have a significant war, then its not going to end in two months.  I only wish that he could have also focused on our economy WHILE the war was going on.  I have spoken to many military people, my cousin included, and they all say the same thing, that our media is NOT showing the truth about whats going on over in iraq. The iraqi people are a more free nation because of America.  Actually, I've heard them say that some of the negative news footage we see now actually took place a couple of years earlier.  They refuse to show the progress because they want to down Bush.  So, yes, he's brought us peace when it comes to terrorism and he's drawn the line in the sand for the  terrorists, and we NEEDED that.  No matter where you turned before, some terrorist was entering our country and doing harm. Clinton did nothing for us except embarass us.  How could we hold our heads high when the news of the sexual perversions of our leader, our President was splashed in every newspaper all across the entire WORLD???  He did a lot of damage and we lost the respect of many nations and Bush has gotten that back.  However, where Bush has failed is in our economy and thats why I think that McCain/Palin will do better.  Because although McCain is very knowledgable in war-he also cares about people and is willing to fight for us, and Palin knows her stuff about the economy.  So if you put the two of them together, you have a great team.  They are both fighters!  They are Unified.  I have hardly heard of Cheney in the past 8 years unless it was a health problem. I think Bush did it on his own to some point.  I'm very optimistic about McCain/Palin.  <br>  So, I Iike Bush, but I LOVE McCain/Palin 08|`|AA10023996	I wish that he would have taken the time to tell we the people what and why he was doing what he did .

It was hard. <br>  <br>  One thing these people had in common was the burning desire to live life as free men and women. To make decisions that prospered them, not the King. Our leaders signed the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Signing this document made sure they were marked for death by the King for Treason. The signers were rich men and placed all they owned at risk. <br>  <br>  What makes our time different than in 1776 is we don't need or have to fight for freedom. We need to vote.

It's easier for a parent with child(ren) to qualify for aid, difficult to impossible for others without dependents.<br>  Always there's paperwork to be submitted in a timely fashion.<br>  <br>  For those of us who are on top of our game, living in a self-sufficient manner, this isn't much of a challenge. To those living with sub-standard means (under the poverty level), this is a nightmare. Papers have been misplaced/lost, transportation to offices/appointments may be unavailable, children don't have childcare while mom/dad is tending to these matters, which often takes days, not minutes, to resolve and complete. The process is rife with frustrations, which feel overwhelming to those on the 'bottom of the economic pile'.<br>  <br>  Anyway, here in California great effort is made to help recipients find work. There were wonderful Job Seeking Workshops for aid recipients, until funding ran out. Pity, as they worked.<br>  <br>  Regarding disability: just so you know, all disabilities can't be identified by simple viewing.

The program here is called welfare to work program. As others have stated this program is very loosely monitored. They also have a state program for women here called W.I.C. (Women In Crisis) that will also provide you with money on top of other welfare received. Other benefits in my state are food cards, Section 8 housing and various government provided food box programs and church sponsored food boxes.<br>  <br>  They claim to remove people from the programs after 3 years but I can not tell you if that is true or not. My state also will go after the fathers of the welfare mom. If the father gets a job, the state goes after him to pay back the state for the welfare benefits that have been paid out. I live in Oregon.<br>  <br>  I can not tell you much more than that. I personally do not know anyone on welfare and have never been on any assistance other than unemployment in my life.

z88IMXNFaa	That's correct.  You don't have to show up.  The court will enter judgment against you.  The judgment will be valid for many years and will accrue interest at better than market rates until paid off.  It will allow the creditor to garnish your wages, lien your property and seize your bank accounts.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	Actually, it might be useful to show.<br>  <br>  In my state, the judge will usually ask for a mediation, and you might end up with a lesser amount owed.<br>  <br>  NEVER just let something happen without at least having a say.|`|MVY8xhXlaa	Yes, if you fail to show, they can get a default judgment.  Then they can either seize your assets (most likely take the money from your bank account) or garnish your wages if you get regular payroll checks.|`|BUI2nlUVaa	You should have called your creditor and made payment plans prior to this happening.  You don't have to show up and a judgment will be made against you.  You will then have to pay it in full plus attorney and court costs to the other person.  You're talking somewhere in the range of $10K.  Pretty big.  If you don't pay they'll enter a judgment of default against you and against your future earnings.  If you have a house and sell it they'll get their portion first.  If you come into money the same thing will apply.  Your credit will never improve until after you have paid it because the judgment is good for 10 years and then they can keep on renewing it, in effect keeping it for life against your credit.|`|U63ll2BWaa	pretty much they get a default judgment. I would however check the papers carefully because sometimes they say they will hit you with contempt of court if you do not show up.|`|7HKTDcvYaa	If you have a summons, you should go. But if you enter a plea stating that you owe the money and will pay it when you can, the court need never take its time to process the case.<br>  <br>  You will then receive an order to pay, a  judgment against you.<br>  People are not sent to prison because they can not pay a debt, but a bailiff may appear on your doorstep to seize anything needed to satisfy the judgment. You can avoid that by having money on hand to satisfy the judgment.|`|6wGkycFAaa	It is NEVER a good idea to not be present when decisions like this are made about you, for you and regarding your finances. There is a good possibility that you could ask for more time. That you can make alternate arrangements and try to salvage your credit rating. If  you don't show, they assume you don't care or have no intention of ever paying it and can go right to garnisheeing your wages (or your husbands). You must show up and handle it like the adult you are.

5llkr3i5aa	Those that argue that post-delivery it is a living human being and pre-delivery it is not are begging the question.  It's saying "a fetus is not a living human because it is a fetus".  <br>  <br>  It's undoubtedly living (growing, consuming nutrients, etc), undoubtedly human (human DNA), and unique to the mother (separate, unique DNA).  <br>  <br>  It comes down to the argument of whether it is justifiable to kill an innocent human being.  In my mind, it is not justifiable to kill a human being to further the convenience of another human being (in this case the mother).  That is what the current law comes down to... if it hinders the convenience of the mother, it's legal.  If not, it's not.<br>  <br>  All other arguments are tangential.  Whether I adopt a child or not has no impact on whether a fetus is a living human being.|`|HpJ4wwC7aa	Abortion is not legal after viability. When a pregnant woman is murdered, they don't charge the suspect with a double homicide unless the fetus was viable. So they are actually consistent. Also, a fetus is not a "child." According to the law, a "child" is a living, breathing person, hence, it has to be viable.<br>  <br>  Viability means that the fetus would be able to live on its own outside the mother or with hospital equipment. That is generally after the second trimester.<br>  <br>  EDIT: To poster, partial birth, (aka intact dilation and extraction) abortion is illegal. It is a method of extracting a fetus via the cervix. It is a more graphic way of performing an abortion, but even though it was completely banned in the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 and then also upheld in a US Supreme Court Case (Gonzalez v Carhart) in 2007, it still was only able to be performed in the second trimester at the latest, prior to the complete ban on that method. <br>  <br>  As if it matters, I'm against abortion but I also can't force my beliefs on anyone else. I am merely stating the current state of the laws on the matter because we frequently study cases about the Constitutionality of abortion in law school. <br>  <br>  I have cited all the pertinent cases and definitions below.|`|6wGkycFAaa	A killer is taking two lives he has no business with.

In which case I agree with it. <br>  <br>  As for your situation above I have yet to hear or see of a murderer being charged with two counts for killing a pregnant woman.

The Official 9/11 Story is nothing short of a "big lie" used to help cover up the crime and then shift the blame to Middle Easteners. <br>  <br>  President Bush, with the help of his Neocon buddies attempted to take complete control of the U.S. by decapitating the Legislative branch of the federal government: They are treasonous murders and would be dictators too, if they had not blundered in their attack of the Capital with Flight 93. They left plenty of evidence at each of the attack sites that implicates them to the crimes. The Following is a summary of what really happened.<br>  <br>  <br>  World Trade Center Buildings<br>  <br>  The World Trade Center buildings were brought down by controlled demolition after being attacked by aircraft. The only evidence our government provided that Osama confessed to the crime is fake. Most every video taken of the towers shows explosives just before the towers imploded. Traces of explosives were also found at ground zero. <br>  <br>  PENTAGON<br>  <br>  There is also strong evidence to support a Douglas A-3 Skywarrior armed with a missile hit the Pentagon. Witnesses say, the U.S. military secretly had Raytheon Co. refit an A-3 Skywarrior with new jet engines, a missile, and a Global Hawk guidance system, just prior to 9/11. Both the jet engine housing as well as a "front end rotor head", found at the crash site, have been identified as belonging to a Pratt & Whitney JT8D jet engine, supporting the witnesses claim. This engine does not fit the commercial Boeing 757 that is said to have hit the Pentagon.<br>  <br>  <br>  FLIGHT 93<br>  <br>  United Airlines Flight 93 did not crash as a result of a struggle between the passengers and the alleged hijackers, but in fact was shot down by the North Dakota Air Guards flying F-16's. On orders from Adj. General of the State of North Dakota and in opposition to V.P. Cheney's stand down orders, Major Rick Gibney spotted the airline flying on remote, headed toward Washington D.C. and shot it down. This is why debris, including human remains, rained on areas several miles away from the crash site.<br>  <br>  <br>  now there is only one fact we need to know about 9/11 and that is: none of the alleged hijackers were at any of the three airports on the morning of 9/11, and if they were not at the airports it was impossible for them to have carried out the attacks. The good news is, the government cannot prove otherwise. <br>  <br>  “There are those who will insist that they have seen on television video surveillance tapes of the hijackers of 9/11 and are satisfied with the official explanation of what happened on that fateful day. <br>  <br>  However, these people are confused by the tape repeatedly shown on TV of two of the alleged hijackers (Mohammad Atta being one of them) passing through a security checkpoint at Portland Maine International Airport to take a connecting flight to Boston on the morning of 11 September 2001. <br>  <br>  This Portland tape has no time-stamp, which makes it suspect. Also, even IF the tape were genuine, it does not place either of the two young Arabs at Logan International Airport. <br>  <br>  Nearly all Americans were lulled into believing that the Portland, Maine tape was sufficient proof when it was not. People were mesmerized by the repeated showing of this tape on TV and in their emotional state did not realize exactly what they were looking at and what they weren't looking at. <br>  <br>  Also, yet another tape was shown in the 24 hour interval leading to the official release of the 9/11 Commission Report; however, this tape, released to the news media by the South Carolina law firm Motley Rice LLC, was almost immediately withdrawn because it quickly became apparent that it was bogus. This Motley Rice surveillance tape purportedly showed two young Arabs boarding flight 77 at Dulles International Airport on the morning of 9/11. But again, just like the Portland Maine tape, there is no time-stamp, which makes it inadmissible in a court of law. This Motley Rice film was never shown again because of the critical eyes of researchers, many of whom preserved copies of the mysterious tape in their computers. <br>  <br>  In consideration of the foregoing, one must conclude that no tape has EVER been shown that reveals ANY of the passengers boarding the 9/11 flights out of Boston's Logan, Newark's Liberty and Washington's Dulles international airports. <br>  <br>  One must also ask, if the 9/11 surveillance tapes at these airports do in fact exist, why haven't we seen them? And if they do not even exist, how can this be explained?”<br>  <br>  Some facts/unanswered questions:<br>  <br>  Mohammed Atta's passport is found undamaged & UnSorched at Ground Zero, while all the hijackers' bodies were incinerated<br>  <br>  - No videos except for 1 of Flight AA77 crashing into the Pentagon, and you can't see a Boeing 757 in it, while all other Pentagon videos are not released, and videos from nearby businesses (CITGO gas station + Sheraton Hotel) confiscated within minutes from  the attack <br>  <br>  - No crash wreckage of engines, wings, tail, fuselage, luggage, airline seats, or even aircraft parts with serial numbers at AA77 or UA93 crash sites, which makes them the first in aviation history to vaporize<br>  <br>  Cellphone calls impossible above 8K feet, and UA93 was at cruising altitude of 35K feet, so calls were probably made using voice morphing technology<br>  - 3 Black boxes found by 2 First responders at WTC, but later confiscated & the government claims all were missing<br>  - WTC7 collapse not even explained or mentioned in 911 Report, plus the Larry Silverstein televised public admission that it was "pulled" by "them"- All testimony by firefighters & witnesses of multiple explosions in WTC eliminated from the 911 report<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I first thought 9-11 was an inside job on Sept. 12th, 2001. It seemed awful suspicious to me that they had not an knowing of what was going to happen and yet by the next day knew everything..all the attackers names, flight training history and even what libraries they had used which I don't even know how they would know this as some libraries do not require ID to use Internet nor have cameras..and yet we supposedly knew this.<br>  <br>  then it came out that other countries had warned us and that Bush had warnings.<br>  <br>  Few things other than steel survived in big pieces and yet there was a hijacker ID, how convenient and now many of the so called hijackers are coming forward alive and saying they had lost their passports prior to 9-11<br>  <br>  Then I heard 5 hours radio show by maker of inplanesite that was most compelling.<br>  <br>  Now I have seen loose change and only two days ago watched mysteries911 DVD that was given to me three times with family members. This DVD is most compelling. I was particularly struck by the slant cut steel beams looking like one that were wired as the explosives cut on a slant so the building falls inward and doesn't damage surrounding structures. Slant cut beams with evidence of the use of thermite.<br>  <br>  If that many websites are out there, hopefully, the American people will wake up in time, not trust their government leaders, and do something while there is still time. I predict worst lies ahead for us and the world. aka the US Government wanting to control the United states of america|`|8PCriC7Vaa	I'm surprised that anyone ever believed the official story, and absolutely amazed that any one who's ever been there could fall for it. As soon as it was found that Marvin Bush was involved, all doubt, however slim was removed.|`|AuWHIJPKaa	What, that 9/11 was an inside job? There are some who believe so, some predominantly well-off, others not.|`|gmaCvh00aa	"The World Trade Center buildings were brought down by controlled demolition after being attacked by aircraft. The only evidence our government provided that Osama confessed to the crime is fake. Most every video taken of the towers shows explosives just before the towers imploded. Traces of explosives were also found at ground zero."<br>  <br>  Quite the opposite.  Absolutely NO evidence of explosives were found at ground zero.  Yes, there were explosions throughout the event.  Do explosions automatically mean bombs?  No.  Were there other items such as vehicles and mech equipment that exploded from the fires?  Yes.  <br>  <br>  I could go on, but these people with the conspiracy sites really really want your donations, so who am I to stop them from bilking the gullible.<br>  <br>  Oh yeah, and I can't believe someone is still pushing that tired old Marvin Bush tale.

41d9bbe883651498cfddaa868b122362aa	In the United States, widespread belief in the existence of laws against driving automobiles barefoot has been debunked as an urban legend. However, driving a motorcycle barefoot is prohibited in Alabama.[3]<br>  In the UK, The Highway code merely states that footwear should not interfere with the operation of the controls of the vehicle. So driving barefoot is not expressly forbidden.|`|N7G26k4Iaa	It is illegal.  You will fail your test if you are not wearing shoes.|`|AA11206283	uh....I'm sure it's in the driving manual you are supposed to be learning.<br>  <br>  Here's a hint; It's illegal.|`|AA10973537	Buy some soft soled slip-on driving shoes.  Socks or barefoot don't give the grip you need on the pedals.  And you will develop huge calusses on your heels too.<br>  Here's apicture of the type of shoes i love to wear fro driving: <a href="http://www.sheknowsbest.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/driving_shoes1.jpgAnd" rel="nofollow">http://www.sheknowsbest.com/wp-content/u...</a> here some different ones:<a href="http://images.google.be/images?hl=en&q=driving%20shoes&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&tab=wi" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.be/images?hl=en&q=d...</a>|`|LIpCGz4oaa	i cant believe that its true. if it is , its rediculous. should i be forced to drive wearing stillettos then? would that be ok? should i drive wearing climbers boots? with crampons on them? no. its not true. it cant be true. driving safely without shoes is very likely ok. |`|AA11424005	Every state has different laws.  Many states do have laws which state drivers have to wear proper footwear when driving.|`|5YTkGB5yaa	In Texas it is. Also in flip flops. But I do it anyways, most cops don't enforce it.|`|Z6lhZiXsaa	yeah, it is technically illegal but probably not well enforced. Practice driving with shoes on because most of the time when you are driving yourself somewhere, you will want shoes on when you get out!|`|706923d60f2f71ebae89f975ca070066aa	It depends on where you life. I specifically remember my driving instructor in NY telling us it was NOT illegal to drive with bare feet. |`|fxdOmoCqaa	Well yes i can imagine its illegal. But its more a question of is this sensible.|`|J1stiMioaa	no footwear is illegal and any professional instructor shouldnt let you do this|`|fBqj4Hjyaa	If it was illegal I'd be on death row.<br>  <br>  I don't wear shoes or socks while driving, ever. Always driven barefoot since I've had my license|`|wnVGeG8uaa	I don't know. I guess it depends on what state you live in. I do it on occasion.|`|AA11760898	no it isnt!|`|6r7ZkNMQaa	my recommendation is to wear proper shoes while you're learning, and during your test.  <br>  <br>  personally i would think socks would be easy to slip over the pedal. <br>  <br>  after you have your license, following rules to the letter will be like the turn signals, used rarely.  <br>  <br>  when i was in a car accident, (i was rear ended from being in stop and start traffic) with enough force that my shoes, despite being on the pedals fell off my feet and across the floorboards.|`|05ca24e6b97ffc0a0342ab5134b318b5aa	i'm not sure but i don't think so, i took my test in my bare feet and had no problem, you can ask the instructor and if they think its ok you are fine...goood luck
W8mAAbzraa	I think they are right girl!<br>  The contract was signed, I don't know exactly what you can collect money on, but I bet you can get some compensation for this.<br>  I would call a lawyer and get one of those free consultations.|`|XqfH76PMaa	I think she might have a case.  You can not back out of a contract once you sign it.  She needs to contact local lawyers and get a free consultation to go in and see what and how much she can sue them for.  They would deserve it after doing her like that!|`|PtRmhxU9aa	Most contracts are required to include a three-day grace period for the parties to back out - how many days were there between the signing and this person's request to back out?|`|ZAN6feeMaa	I think it may depend on the terms of the contract.|`|V7JVKApkaa	There is NO grace period in MOST contracts; that's a myth. A lease has no grace period, unless noted in the contract. A signed contract is valid and enforceable the day it's signed.  You can sue for actual damages, not conjured or imaginary. You can sue for the month's rent. You can not sue for pain and suffering, loss of furniture or food (you incurred those losses voluntarily, beyond the control of the tenant), etc. Good luck.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	I am pretty sure, it would be 'Breach of Contract'.

HpJ4wwC7aa	Most big city police departments require a 4 year degree. I wouldn't know the percentage but since I know that Portland City police in Oregon and the San Diego City police in California both require a 4 year degree, that NY City would also require a 4 year degree. So based on that, I would assume 100% have a 4 year degree.<br>  <br>  Edit: I just checked their website and to join their cadet program you have to be enrolled at a 4 year university and have already completed at least 45 units (approximately 1 and a half years full time). By that, I would assume, to actually become an NYPD police officer, you would actually have to graduate from a 4 year University, along with completing their cadet program.|`|gDn1LVRxaa	I am unsure of exact stats. I know that if you want to be a high ranking official in law enforcement education is an unwritten rule. It probably is quite competitive starting out and a degree will probably benefit you to a certain extent. Good luck!|`|1VaH8D3Raa	Very few<br>  .<br>  Most have military involvement<br>  .

EuGsGfuJaa	According Maryland's annotated Criminal Code, Title 6, Subtitle 4 "Trespass," the area must be "posted conspicuously against trespass by: (1) signs placed where they reasonably may be seen; or (2) paint marks" (§ 6-402)<br>  <br>  No signs, No Trespass.  However, the signs only need to be at entrances or areas adjacent to public roads or other properties.  If you enter by way of woods, they don't need to have signs posted every few feet or anything.  Go back and check for signs near roads or other properties to be sure.<br>  <br>  Regarding railroads specifically, it would be a crime to interfere with a railroad by placing an object on the tracks or messing with the tracks or signals, but just walking along them doesn't count (§ 6-502).<br>  <br>  Contrary to what these other users are saying, in Maryland, a "Good Faith" defense is allowable.  Get an attorney, go to court, and you will most likely beat this.|`|8567eea50ee05006e45298c8a269c261aa	Yes, the charge will stand.<br>  <br>  If you are not a train, stay off the tracks.|`|B9YZ9wYUaa	RAIL ROAD TRACKS considered to be government properties. Therefore, whether you see a sign or NOT. It is off limit to any persons. The law assume everybody knows the law. IGNORANCE OF THE LAW EXCUSES NO ONE IN COMPLIANCE THERE OFF. <br>  <br>  Since you didn't see any sign it doesn't mean you can enter at will anytime of the day or night. The police is correct in giving you guys citation for tress passing. Can you be charge? Depends if the police push through with the citation charges you and your friends over there still chewing gum is going to be charge with accordance to the rail road tracks law. You were never told to leave before because nobody caught you or your friends there but now since a police have caught you guys it is a different story altogether.|`|FXoPkZZdaa	Maybe the railroad company has to press charges for them to stick,  see a lawyer and don't admit anything and let the lawyer be there for any interview|`|U63ll2BWaa	Ignorance of the law does not make you not guilty. Railroad is pretty much known for being no trespassing and yes the charges will stick.
DyRlZFJKaa	This is Identity Theft and can be prosecuted as such if you can prove it up.<br>  Law enforcement would have to get involved to do that.<br>  The Social Security Administration does not have a certain amount of money they are holding in an account for you or anyone else.  If SSA did recover the money, they would not give it to you or hold it for you.<br>  I suggest you get a new Social Security Number - they will do that for people who have had someone else using the number (cases of Identity Theft).  But you would need to show the SSA that it is necessary.<br>  Social Security can give you a report showing how your number has been used over your lifetime.<br>  You might need some legal help to amend the record and safeguard you social security number  for the future.  Specifically, to be issued a new number.|`|U63ll2BWaa	depending on when it happened if the statute has run out you are out of luck|`|1VaH8D3Raa	Ya got ta get with a lawyer to see if there is anything that can be done<br>  .<br>  With your Identity theft<br>  .<br>  No telling how far that person used that number<br>  .<br>  Ya might be a wanten to be getting a like I said <br>  .<br>  Lawyer<br>  .|`|GFOdY3nBaa	call the cops and get a report to begin with. they should direct you. there is a long trail of thing to prove and do, but you ve been "robbed", and have all right to get to the bottom of it. your best bet is an attorney though.

dfa5c250d8bebdac10a67fe9a7073ab7aa	My recommendation would be this.  Go to each of the armed services recruiters and talk with them.  Before you go, write down exactly what it is you want from the military, i.e. job, benefits, etc.  Second, take someone with you, preferably someone older than you like a parent, grandparent or aunt/uncle.  Tell that person you do not want to make a decision right now, you want to find out as much as you can, before you make a decision.  Ask that person to intercede if the recruiter starts pushing you towards making a decision.<br>  <br>  Recruiters are taught methods and questions to use that will get you thinking along their lines.  I know I worked with them before and saw/used many of them.  Once you have all of your questions answered, leave.  Thank the person for their time and leave.  Do not make a decision until you have talked to each of the four branches.|`|68fafe986b7e88016d2269fd55621ed4aa	Well what is holding you back?

You are also entitled to medical benefits your entire life and pensions as long as you serve.  <br>  <br>  My opinion?  I'd apply for loans and go to college.

8bf87b93c67c81848b264865e183f965aa	Soy Venezolana , y considero que lo que sobra en este país (a mi modo de ver) es la libertad de expresión, hay canales de tv  y emisoras radiales que todos los días , por 24 horas no hacen sino despotricar del gobierno, y esas personas no sufren ningún castigo, como es lo usual en una dictadura.En otros gobiernos bastaba que alguien hablara mal de él, para inmediatamente allanar y cerrar emisoras., lo que pasa, que aquí parece que la gente sufre de "Amnesia " y olvidan fácilmente. Y, hay personas que reclaman sus cuotas de poder del pasado , y quieren derrocar al gobierno. ....En los canales de la oposición hablan de "comunismo", y esas personas mantienen mensajes publicitarios millonarios y viven como reyes. Visitas cualquier centro comercial y no cabe una aguja de la cantidad de personas comprando, los estacionamientos de estos centros repletos "Hasta lo teque teque" de autos lujosos. Entonces ?quien dice la verdad?. Te invito que visites el país y luego hablamos.....Si es verdad, que unos políticos están en la carcel, porque se les abrió juicio por peculado ,corrupción. Hago una corrección a una ponente que dijo que Salas Romer estaba preso ( Fijate eso es una calumnia) porque ese se?or no lo está, Lapi si lo está , pero a todos se les abrió juicio. ...Soy independiente y por lo tanto creo que mi visión es mas amplia que los sectores que se parcializan por uno de los lados , se ciegan de odio y rencor y dicen cosas inciertas...... Con respecto a RCTV, ese canal puede seguir funcionando , como canal internacional, lo que se vence en mayo es la concesión, Jaime Lusinchi ( Ex-presidente) también se la iba a suspender , pero este presidente se vendió, y a cambio de eso pidió la cabeza de unos cuantos , como el caso de la periodista Rosana Ordo?ez) y llegaron a un acuerdo "Sucio", Chávez no se ha prestado para eso.......Las razones porque no le quiere dar la concesión pueden  ser criticables , pero quien decide es el gobierno y está en todo su derecho.|`|ab1bf41d030350058db376a8cc4725a0aa	Primero tienen que estar claro que es Dictadura, sus caracteristicas y compararlo con lo que se vive "hoy" en Venezuela, resalto el hoy por que siempre sacan conclusiones de supuestos futuro a donde vamos.

P5282HDOaa	The same thing that happens if you are an adult. When you are placed on probation, the judge reads a list of rules that you are to abide by.

Clearly go over your probational status with your probation officer over what you can and what you can not do.

On a plus que jamais besoin d'être unis, solidaires, et ce n'est pas un parti, f?t-il l'UMP avec ses 25 %, qui va tout seul régler nos problèmes. C'est pourquoi je crois que l'idée de Bayrou d'un gouvernement composé de personnalités issues de plusieurs partis est vraiment nécessaire, comme cela se passe actuellement en Allemagne. Sarko joue les gros bras, ne bougez pas, j'arrive, tout va s'arranger, mais cela ne se passera jamais comme ?a, jamais ! C'est impossible. Soit il rêve, soit il y croit du haut de sa mégalomanie et dans ce cas, il est temps de lui dire : stop ! pouce. Le seul UMP ne pourra pas gouverner efficacement, et pareil pour le PS. Je crois que la solution de gouvernement que propose Bayrou est non seulement viable, mais salutaire pour nous tous, pour que nous soyons enfin plus unis, proches les uns des autres, quelles que que soient nos sensibilités. Je ne me reconna?trai jamais dans le discours de M. Sarkozy : il n'est pas visionnaire. Il gèrera notre crise comme les autres. Il n'a d'ambition que pour lui et son parti. Où est son ambition pour la France quand il ne dispose que d'une majorité de 25% des électeurs ? Et les autres ?

Sarkozy n'était ni président, ni premier ministre et donc lui attribuer toute la responsabilité de ce qui s'est passé ces dernières années relève de l'habituelle mauvaise foi des gens de gauche. La baisse de la délinquance qu'il a obtenu n'est pas si mal après les augmentations constatées après un passage de la gauche au pouvoir. Cela dit la question fondamentale est : fera-t-il les réformes que Chirac n'a pas osé faire ? Avec les ordures de gauche qui descendent dans la rue dès que la droite sort un texte ce sera aussi difficile pour un gouvernement  de Sarkozy que pour les gouvernement de droite précédents.

If you add your ages and divide it in half, it equals 22, which is 1 year older than the legal age of 21. Therefore, since Florida is technically a state located in the democratic nation known as The United States of America, they are obliged to follow the federal drinking age, which is 21 years old, except in the instance when the sum of a young couples ages are divided in half, thus making each of the couples the same age, allowing the younger person to actually, by law, become older in the eyes of the law. For example, if a 30 year old man such as myself were to get together with a 100 year old woman, our ages added up and divided by half, it would make me 65 years old and legally able to retire. I hope this explanation helped.

20e67a751121ab0791980b62bc2f934aaa	In law, the phrase "without prejudice" means that a claim, lawsuit, or proceeding has been brought to a temporary end but that no legal rights or privileges have been determined, waived, or lost by the result. <br>  <br>  For example, if a party brings a lawsuit in small claims court but discovers that the claim is greater than the amount for that court to have jurisdiction, the lawsuit can be dismissed "without prejudice". This means that the dismissal is no bar to bringing a new lawsuit in a court that does have jurisdiction.<br>  <br>  Also, in many common law jurisdictions such as England, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Singapore, the term "without prejudice" is also used in the course of negotiations to indicate that a particular conversation or letter is not to be tendered as evidence in court. Such correspondences must be made in the course of negotiations and must be a genuine attempt to settle a dispute between the parties.<br>  <br>  Note: This is not my original text. I copied it from the Wikipedia article on the subject, given in the sources section.|`|BlUzgH6oaa	In the US, there's a sentence in Motions to Dismiss which says, "... dismissed with prejudice to the re-filing of same ..."  This means that they cannot file another suit for the same damages.  The suit is prejudiced for refiling.  If the suit was dismissed "without prejudice", you can file another suit for the same damages.|`|x0Yzw0r8aa	i am not sure exactly but it could mean without a biased opinion or something along those lines.

Yes, he won the popular vote. But if we were using the popular vote in 2000, then both candidates would have campaigned differently, and the vote count would have been different.<br>  <br>  In general, it's better to consider rules changes on their merits rather than on the basis of who would have won a particular election in the past.<br>  <br>  As it stands now, voter fraud in any given statehas limited effect because it can only affect the outcome from that state.

If he has accompanied orders to a base in Virginia then the military will pay to move her to that location and they can live in housing.  If he is on restricted orders meaning that there is specifications on his orders then he will be getting BAH to pay for housing for the family.   As soon as you finish Basic you are considered military and to qualify for housing you need to get accompanied orders.  If his AIT had been longer than 21 weeks then he would have qualified for housing.  If he completed AIT and reported to the command he was being stationed with then he qualified for housing at that command.|`|ABmZYbDZaa	If married he can apply for housing as soon as he in processes the post that he is going to.

The grandmothers both said the child never touched locks and she was afraid of the dark.  That she would have never unlocked the door and just went wandering around.<br>  <br>  The gf was a known partier and she had been out that night.  One of two things happened, I think.  She gave the child something to make her sleep and it killed her, she panicked and called the father and they made up the story.  Or she forgot and left the door unlocked and the child was taken.  I doubt if that happened though because the dirt road had only a few trailers on it.  It was off the main road and did not get traffic.  Other residents were up and did not hear a car or truck.  Someone would have to know she was in there.<br>  <br>  The reason I think the gf gave her something to sleep is because I heard of this practice when I had a certain job.  Girls would give Benadryl so the kids would sleep and they could go out at night.<br>  <br>  It is hard to think of a father protecting his gf like that but if he also panicked, and they got rid of the body, then he can be charged too.  So now they are in it together.  Hence the marriage.  How to keep someone from a telling a secret?  Kill them or marry them.

Color doesn't matter. Why ask such a stupid question?|`|UIju1jfOaa	Following the end of the Civil War, the 19th Amendment to the Constitution was proposed.  It stated that no government in the United States may prevent a citizen from voting based on that citizen's race, color, or previous condition of servitude (i.e. slavery). It was ratified on February 3, 1870.<br>  <br>  Women did not officially gain suffrage until the ratification of the 19th Amendment, which prohibited any government in the United States from denying a citizen the right to vote because of that citizen's sex.  It was ratified on August 18, 1920.<br>  <br>  From what I have researched, it really comes down to what was the biggest deal of the day.  We had just fought a Civil War that resulted in the abolition of slavery.  Could we have thousands of freed, yet disenfranchised, freed slaves unrepresented?<br>  <br>  There was a movement in 1869 the National Woman Suffrage Association (formed by Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton) that had the goal of securing an amendment to the Constitution in favor of women's suffrage, and it even opposed passage of the Fifteenth Amendment without it being changed to include female suffrage.  I bet that was politically unfeasible considering the North had just lost hundreds of thousands of soldiers fighting a war to end slavery.  It just wasn't a priority at that time in the nation's history.<br>  <br>  Think of it like today's political arguments over changing Social Security or coming up with Immigration policy.  They are so controversial that nothing gets passed unless it avoids "non-pertinent" issues.<br>  <br>  There were even multiple, conflicting thoughts on how to  even achieve women's suffrage.  Some felt the federal government had to grant it first, while others believed in getting state constitutions changed first, before tackling the U.S. Constitution.  By the time World War I had come around, women's suffrage in the U.S. had finally begun to gain more traction, especially with the growing movements and succesful suffrage efforts overseas in Australia, New Zealand, and parts of Europe.
BvZvZaxzaa	My brother was in a similar situation. He wasn't sure if a child was his but he signed the acknowledgement even though he was no longer dating the woman. 8 years later the woman signed up for state assistance (welfare) and got it. Guess who the state came after? You guessed it... My brother. Now the burden is his to pay for a DNA test to disprove he is the father all because he didn't take care of it right away.

UsRQmsilaa	Let's see a 31E is a Corrections Specialist so they deal with prisoners and detainees.  Which could cause stress which causes PTSD, high blood pressure.  The bad knees and backs could be when the guards do the cell extractions.  The guards go in and sometimes have to wrestle with the prisoner/detainee to pull them out of the cell.  Then while working by yourself while out in general population being highly outnumbered can't be good when your with prisoners/detainees.  Hell some prisoners/detainees like to shank and stab guards.  So those are just some things that can cause all of that stuff.|`|LEBV1FPuaa	Not sure but most injuries are non combat related across the board|`|a6cwsiDxaa	Well, I was Doctor that worked around them in at the a RCF they are prison guards and they work 18 hour days 20 days in a row.

txhM9Bqwaa	Most driving schools don't charge you if you have taken classes with them. Such as the drving lessons. This is only because you have paid upfront. The car should be included in the package. Other than that, the drving school is free to charge whatever price they want for usuage of their car. Personally, I think you should take the road test in the car that you learned how to drive in. Because you are already comfortable in that car. And you kno how to manover it better than another car. Believe it or not all cars aren't the same. Lataz babez|`|LZuLKRZeaa	I would have thought that the use of the car for the test was included in the driving lessons fee.   In any event if a fee is charged it should have been explained prior to the agreement of the contract between you and the school for the lessons.
Uh8OaBEeaa	Tentunya pertanyaan ini dapat dikaitkan dengan sudah sejauh mana akuisisi ilmu pengetahuan dan teknologi dalam horizon pertahanan dan keamanan negara. Pertahanan dan keamanan negara saat ini yang terkait dengan dimensi peralatan persenjataan semestinya menjadi salah satu aspek dari aspek pertahanan sendiri yang sudah menjadi semakin luas belakangan ini. <br>  <br>  Perkembangan ilmu dan teknologi serta kaitannya dengan aspek sosial merupakan hal yang sangat penting dalam kajian pertahanan dan keamanan. Beberapa contoh aspek perlengkapan pertahanan dan keamanan yang sangat penting (untuk Indonesia saat ini) yang relatif tidak selalu berkaitan dengan kemajuan persenjataan, misalnya:<br>  <br>  - perlengkapan di bidang kajian perilaku (behavioral analysis). Hal ini sangat diperlukan untuk memahami bagaimana perilaku perorangan dari anggota masyarakat yang memiliki latar belakang yang sangat berbeda-beda, mulai dari agama, suku, preferensi politik, dan sebagainya. Beberapa studi kasus yang berkaitan dengan hal ini lebih memerlukan piranti analisis matematika sosiologi yang sangat penting, misalnya: analisis jaringan sosial, pemetaan konflik sosial dan peluang resolusinya. Sebagai contoh, perlengkapan analitik yang kuat di bidang jaringan sosial, dapat digunakan untuk melihat secara umum bagaimana persebaran gosip/rumor yang dapat mengganggu ketahanan nasional bahkan persebaran penyakit. Beberapa permasalahan yang terkait dengan pertahanan dan keamanan seringkali dapat diselesaikan dengan analisis yang tajam, dalam hal ini daripada tindakan masif ketentaraan. <br>  <br>  - perlengkapan di bidang ketahanan ekonomi. Hal ini juga sangat penting, karena banyak persoalan di bidang ketahanan nasional berawal pada permasalahan ekonomi. Perlengkapan pertahanan seharusnya memiliki piranti dasar yang dapat menangkap situasi pasar (baik internasional dan nasional), perdagangan, dan perekonomian secara umum. Lebih jauh, kita tentu telah memahami bahwa kekuatan ekonomi nasional memiliki kaitan langsung dan tak langsung dengan kekuatan pertahanan secara keseluruhan.<br>  <br>  -  perlengkapan di bidang epidemiologi dan penyakit. Hal ini merupakan hal yang sangat penting mengingat persenjataan biologi jauh lebih kejam daripada senjata pemusnah massal manapun. Rongrongan terhadap kedaulatan negara belakangan ini tak hanya dari negara atau kelompok tertentu saja, melainkan dari penyakit-penyakit baru yang mewabah, dan bukan tak mungkin virus/bakteri penyakit dapat digunakan sebagai elemen senjata juga yang tak terlihat. Jika ditemukan penyakit baru di kalangan anggota masyarakat, sepantasnya hal ini perlu diperhatikan serius dan tentunya membutuhkan perlengkapan yang cakap pula untuk mendeteksi, menganalisis, memprediksi, dan memberi alternatif solusi untuk menyelesaikannya. <br>  <br>  Berbicara tentang peralatan ketentaraan pada masa kini telah berkaitan dengan bagaimana secara interdisiplin kita dapat mengakuisisi ilmu dan teknologi secara menyeluruh. Peperangan yang dapat mengganggu kedaulatan negara dapat bersumber bahkan terjadi di tengah kesetimbangan supply dan demand di pasar, meja negosiasi, internet, dan sebagainya. Perang-perang semacam ini justru lebih sering terjadi karena kemajuan peradaban manusia telah menghantarkan kita pada wawasan nusantara yang semestinya lebih kompleks dan dinamis.<br>  <br>  Untuk pertanyaan senjata dan peralatan ketentaraan, apakah kita perlu memajukannya. Jawabannya adalah harus, karena jika tidak kedaulatan negara dapat terganggu. Hanya saja, wawasan kita tentang apa yang disebut sebagai "senjata" dan "peralatan ketentaraan" memang perlu di-redefinisi. Setelah merdeka 62 tahun, negara kita perlu berbenah di sana-sini secara interdisiplin, untuk menghempang gangguan kedaulatan negara yang mungkin datang dari berbagai aspek yang saat ini bersifat multidisiplin.|`|3yUmTH2Kaa	Saya rasa tidak perlu terburu-buru...<br>  Semua orang juga sudah tau efek samping dari perang (kaya encok aja) dan tidak menyukai perang . sekarang bukan zaman perang senjata tetapi perang IMAN...!!!<br>  <br>  Buat apa beli yang gituan, lebih baik kita nerusin KORUPSI dinegara kita agar tetap NOMOR 1 (satu) didunia hore....!!!, beli yang gituan untuk sekarang paling-paling formalitas saja... bukanya kita dalam medan perang senjata.<br>  <br>  Malaysia juga ngak bakalan nembak kita dengan benda gituan, tapi dengan kepintaranyalah mereka mengalahkan kita (DENGAN EKONOMI YANG MANTAP), kalau penerbangan mereka melewati kawasan terbang kita kan boleh tembak terus jatuh (tapi perlu radar yang bagus juga ya..?, beli aja deh dikit).- ya... yang standar kebutuhan ajalah, asal jangan ketingalan zaman-.|`|9xJlsakbaa	Halo,<br>  <br>  Sebenarnya memajukan persenjataan dan peralatan ketentaraan merupakan sesuatu yang harus seiring dengan majunya teknologi persenjataan dan peralatan ketentaraan negara lainnya.

Since you two geniuses admitted to having sex with the girl, you only have to overcome whether it was consensual or not.

GdnQ81bbaa	Your best bet is to contact the courts and ask them these questions. They are the ones who will process your ticket and will know all the laws and regulation. You should also ask the courts if you are allowed to take a driving school class. This will prevent your insurance from going up and points from being placed on your license. Just make sure you get the courts permission before doing so. If you don’t the courts will reject your driving school certificate. Good luck!|`|H0iYP25Taa	Okay, stay calm. It's not like you're getting locked up, lol.<br>  Since you are 18 years old, and I am assuming this is your first ticket, the reason you have to appear in court is because you were ticketed for reckless driving. Reckless driving in most states is comprised of speeding 15 mph over the posted speed limit. Apparently you had done 27, so you were rolling. And if you are ticketed for reckless driving, you have to appear in court and the ticket fees are outrageous. <br>  <br>  Now, you must show up in court. If you don't then you can lose your driving priviledges. Plead guilty. Since this is your first offense, they most likely won't be jacka**es and provoke your license, but they may give you points on your license and they may have you take a few classes on driving the correct way. <br>  <br>  You won't get a criminal record because this is not a criminal offense. Stop worrying. Just do the speed limit next time bud.|`|PBEadhQKaa	I understand completely. I was busted for 29 mph over the speed limit. I know it's a tense situation.

gasquENMaa	Hello Wayne. Probation is a form of self rehabilitation. The court uses this to help reduce the public burden of incarceration plus allows a person to prove to the court that they made a mistake but can follow rules and not reoffend.<br>  <br>  As such, when a person agrees to probation over incarceration, they sign an agreement with the probation officer that lists a set of rules ( called sanctions) that they are now responsible for. Each set of sanctions can and will be tailored to the individual according to the offense committed, age group and prior convictions.<br>  <br>  As a minor, you can expect sanctions of maintaining good grades in school, good attendance, maintaining a curfew time at night, no drug or alcohol usage, no contact with law enforcement personnel and not breaking any laws or being cited as such.<br>  <br>  Even though your personal charge was not drug related, you will be urine analysis tested to see that you will be following your set of sanctions. <br>  <br>  Best advice is to follow all your sanctions and keep your nose clean. The probation time will pass quickly enough and you can put this all behind you. Failure to do so will result in extensions of your probation and eventually, reinstatement of your sentence.<br>  <br>  Best of luck and I hope this is useful to you|`|AA10780838	Yes they do, regardless of what the charge is. The purpose of the drug testing is to treat the drug problem that likely contributed to the offense.  Drug use is also one of the factors most closely correlated with recidivism.|`|PVapYDKOaa	Not every probation department drug tests you.

Reliable diagnostic criteria should consist of any of the following elements: <br>  <br>  <br>  (1) Substantiated history of cough, wheeze, and/or dyspnea that persists or recurs over a prolonged period of time, generally more than 6 months. <br>  <br>  (2) If the diagnosis of asthma is in doubt, a test for reversible airflow obstruction (greater than a 15 percent increase in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEVI) following administration of an inhaled bronchodilator) or airway hyperactivity (exaggerated decrease in airflow induced by standard bronchoprovocation challenge such as methacholine inhalation or a demonstration of exercise-induced bronchospasm) must be performed. <br>  <br>  Asthma<br>  Previously, any history of asthma was disqualifying, regardless of age. While medical waivers were sometimes possible, waiver approval usually required scheduling and passing a pulmonary function test. Under the new policy, Asthma is only disqualifying if it occurs after the applicant’s 13th birthday.<br>  <br>  Medical record screening may still be required, depending on the applicant’s medical history. However, in many cases, a signed statement, attached to the medical pre-screening form, stating that the applicant did not have any type of asthma (including exercise induced, or allergic asthma) or treatment for asthma after their 13th birthday will be sufficient.<br>  <br>  Applicants who’ve experienced asthma or reactive airway disease after age 13 will require all medical documentation. Waivers may still be considered, depending on the applicant’s medical history and – possibly results from a pulmonary function test.

You have the DIs over your back yelling at you. For OCS, it is more physically demanding (by the time you go to OCS your PFT score should be around 270+) and candidates are expected to demonstrate leadership skills and exceed other requirements. It also focuses more on weeding out candidates more than boot camp. The instructors won't yell at you much but you are held accountable for everything you do. Contrary to belief you don't necessarily have to have a college degree just to go to OCS but to get accepted into the program one of the requirements is having 60 units of college completed. Once you completed both OCS and have a BA/BS degree will you be commissioned and be able to go to TBS and MOS school.

If you are in a four-year curriculum, you can get your commissioned while still in College. <br>  <br>  OCS is the full-time commitment, you have to be finished with college.<br>  <br>  Only the newbie Marine Officers will then go to The Basic School (TBS), which is a requirement for the boot Lieutenants to learn how to be a platoon commander.  Half of TBS is in-building classroom lectures; the other half of the portion is field training - teaches the boot Lieutenants the basics of leading a platoon as an Officer.<br>  <br>  All the Commissioned Officers are the 2nd and 1st Lieutenants, Captains, Majors, Lieutenant Colonels and Colonels, and the General Officers - Brigadier General, Major General, Lieutenant General, and General.<br>  <br>  People with college degrees get the chance to become an Officer, it has to be a Bachelor Degree or above.

The apathy the people of the United States have over drug use will definitely be a serious threat to our health as a nation. <br>   <br>  Our citizens need to wake up to the crime caused by drug use.  People that are addicted do not work so they have to support their use by either dealing drugs or committing crimes.  When they get sick they use medical resources and don't pay for them.

I believe also that the best way to ensure that Congress does follow the Constitution would be to force Congress to hire only Representatives of the people to be the Sergent at Arms in the Congressional building.<br>  <br>  And any time a Congressperson brings up a proposed Bill to be passed into law that proposed Bill must be read by the Sergent at Arms first, if that proposed Bill has any part of it that violates our Constitution or are Bill of Rights, have the Sergent at Arms immediately Arrest that Congressperson for treason.<br>  <br>    After a few arrests have been made of our Congresspeople, and they have been tried and convicted and sent to prison, I don't think very many Congresspeople would want to create and pass  Bills that are unconstitutional.

And don't bother answering loaded questions where the person is looking for a response that they agree with so they can "Prove" their point.<br>  <br>  In the "Good old days" people were able to comment on any news story that came up. But too many bullies and hacks couldn't handle actual debate and could only insult. Now with the "New and improved" Yahoo answers, which was supposedly going to end that kind of behavior, they still can't control themselves.

Think what might have been if Alan Greenspan, Lawrence Summers, Robert Rubin and Arthur Levitt, Jr., had paid attention to the warnings of Brooksley Born about the  problems with derivatives.  She spoke up in 1997,<br>  <br>  "In 1997, Brooksley Born warned in congressional testimony that unregulated trading in derivatives could "threaten our regulated markets or, indeed, our economy without any federal agency knowing about it." Born called for greater transparency--disclosure of trades and reserves as a buffer against losses. <br>  <br>  "Instead of heeding this oracle's warnings, Greenspan, Rubin & Summers rushed to silence her. As the Times story reveals, Born's wise warnings "incited fierce opposition" from Greenspan and Rubin who "concluded that merely discussing new rules threatened the derivatives market." Greenspan deployed condescension and told Born she didn't know what she doing and she'd cause a financial crisis. (A senior Commission director who worked with Born suggests that Greenspan and the guys didn't like her independence. " Brooksley was this woman who was not playing tennis with these guys and not having lunch with these guys. There was a little bit of the feeling that this woman was not of Wall Street.") <br>  <br>  "In early 1998, according to the Times story, one of the guys, Larry Summers, called Born to "chastise her for taking steps he said would lead to a financial crisis. But Born kept at it, unwilling to let arrogant men undermine her good judgment. But it got tougher out there. In June 1998, Greenspan, Rubin and the then head of the SEC, Arthur Levitt, Jr., called on Congress "to prevent Ms. Born from acting until more senior regulators developed their own recommendations." (Levitt now says he regrets that decision.) Months later, the huge hedge fund Long Term Capital Management nearly collapsed--confirming some of Born's warnings. (Bets on derivatives were a key reason.) <br>  <br>  "Despite that event," the Times reports, " Congress (apparently as a result of Greenspan & Summer's urging, influence-peddling and pressure) "froze" Born's Commissions' regulatory authority. The next year, Born left as head of the Commission."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.thenation.com/blogs/edcut/370925/the_woman_greenspan_rubin_summers_silenced" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenation.com/blogs/edcut/370...</a>|`|Ch9TedMcaa	He's doing a much better job than the last clown.|`|JthubNIsaa	The only area where the media has not been silenced is in stocks.

If you are for liberty, check them out.|`|08bb4f98027983734892824886f5c11baa	Strict gun control for the public will not work since it just allows criminals access to illegal firearms through the black market (just look at the war on drugs and the prospering drug trade). The most promising method would just probably to enforce stricter punishments on those who commit gun crimes.<br>  The Constitution does state that guns should be allowed for the militia, but the text is incredibly vague and many people interpret this to varying degrees.|`|AA10915039	Where do you think illegal guns come from?  The vast majority come from criminals stealing them from their legal owners or stealing them from gun shops.  Also, the Constitution doesn't mention guns at all.  Here is the text of the Second Amendment.<br>  <br>  A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.|`|6Gfz125Paa	In that case, why have any laws?  Why build a fence on the border when most illegal immigrants are going to sneak in rather than going through the checkpoint?  Why ban marijuana when people are going to get it anyway?  <br>  <br>  Gun control, if properly implemented, has worked in several countries (UK, Australia, etc.), which all have crime rates FAR lower than the US in almost every category.  That right there should tell you.  But unfortunately, the gun lobby doesn't look at actual results.  They just hide behind catchphrases.  <br>  <br>  And the militia argument is outdated.  If the US government wanted to be tyrannical, they've got the best army and weapons in the world.  A few guns in the hands of citizens wouldn't be a problem for them at all.|`|5YTkGB5yaa	Gun control doesn't work. It only takes the guns out of citizens hands and puts them into criminal hands. We need stiffer punishments for crimes committed with guns.|`|7HKTDcvYaa	If the only role of gun control is to make it illegal to take them from your home or place of business, so that police can detect carried weapons and prevent that, we might accomplish something. It would make the illegal gun also subject to seizure. But to make that meaningful there would have to be metal detectors in a lot of places, so that for instance when a person with a gun approaches a place of business, a signal goes to police for corrective action. That would produce so many false positives that police would be driven crazy. So instead of signaling police, the place of business would be alerted so that someone with a shotgun is at the ready. <br>  Now that kind of gun control might work.|`|73f37851c35d22949c704d293473d5cbaa	I think the maxim "if guns are outlawed, then only outlaws would have guns" would prove itself true - in the short term. In the long term, the majority of firearms used by criminals would be destroyed or confiscated, and if ammunition was outlawed/restricted, it would become much more difficult to obtain (and expensive to use), resulting in decreased gun deaths.  There is overwhelming evidence from scores of other countries that – in the LONG run – gun control does indeed lead to decreased violent crime.<br>  <br>  Look, I think 99% of gun owners are responsible - they are trained in gun use & safety, they keep their guns out of kids' reach, and they teach their children how to properly handle and - more importantly - RESPECT guns.<br>  <br>  However, under the current system there is just no way to prevent stupid (not to mention drunk, violent, unstable, etc.) people from getting guns. It seems like at least once a week you hear about something like this:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wjbf.com/jbf/news/state_regional/south_carolina/article/south_carolina_boy_kills_10-year-old_brother/11530/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wjbf.com/jbf/news/state_regio...</a><br>  <br>  Until we can figure out how to keep stupid people (like the father of those two boys) from getting firearms, we need MUCH stricter gun control laws. <br>  <br>  It's NOT fair to the 99% of responsible gun owners, and I understand why they're against it, but there are simply too many kids dying.|`|BUI2nlUVaa	You are correct.

Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants, they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man." — Thomas Jefferson<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/DOUGandFRIENDS" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/user/DOUGandFRIEN...</a><br>  <br>  I got this from another answerer on Y!A<br>  This is a post from an Australian police officer...<br>  <br>  Hi Yanks, I thought you all would like to see the now available data<br>  from Down Under. It has now been one year (12 months) since gun <br>  owners in Australia were forced by a new law to surrender 640,381 personal<br>  firearms to be destroyed by our own government, a program costing<br>  Australia taxpayers more than $500 million dollars.<br>   <br>  The first year results are now available:<br>  -Australia-wide, homicides are up 6.2 percent;<br>  -Australia-wide, assaults are up 9.6 percent;<br>  -Australia-wide, armed robberies are up 44 percent (yes, 44 percent); <br>     In the state of Victoria alone, homicides with firearms are now up <br>     300 percent as compared with the last one year period when private <br>     ownership of a firearm was legal.<br>     (NB: the law-abiding citizens did turn in their personal firearms, <br>     the criminal element did not and thus criminals in Australia still <br>     possess their guns.) <br>  -While data for the 25 years preceding the confiscation of privately<br>  owned guns showed a steady decrease in armed robbery with firearms, <br>   this has changed drastically upward in the past 12 months as criminals <br>  now are assured their victims will be unarmed. <br>  -There has also been a dramatic increase in break-ins and assaults <br>  of the elderly, while the resident is at home. Australian politicians are <br>  at a loss to explain how public safety has<br>  decreased, after such monumental effort and expense was expended in<br>  successfully ridding Australian society of guns.' <br>  -This story of well intentioned government intervention in the <br>  rights of lawful individuals to own and possess firearms won't be seen in the<br>  mainstream US media or on the American evening news. Senator Obama <br>  who advocates a similar confiscation in the US will not be reporting <br>  any of this to you. But, the Australian experience speaks for itself. Guns in the <br>  hands of honest citizens save lives and property and, yes, gun-control laws<br>  affect only the law-abiding citizens.  <br>  Americans may want to take note before it's too late!<br>  <a href="http://www.gunowners.org/hlr-au.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.gunowners.org/hlr-au.htm</a>

VYmImrWhaa	Ive been in for over six years now, and have been in and out of a few relationships. I guess the best thing you can do is to be understanding.  Know that he works hard, and that a normal day for him is something most people wouldnt even begin to be able to do. When he comes home, go out somewhere he would like, have a nice dinner, and when you get home, put something sexy on, have some drinks ready, and make him feel like a king.  Dont ask too much of him at first, give him time to readjust to the normal life, get his opinion on things, and try to do things that would make him happy.  If he goes to Iraq or Afghanistan, dont ask him about what happened over there, if he wants to tell you he will, dont press him for any details. If he shows you pictures or anything like that, be interested, ask him to explain things, educate you on the things you dont know.  I know I like to help people to understand the military life a little better.  Anyhow, I hope that helps, good luck.|`|cBT7pS0maa	Sex.|`|7idyT7Obaa	what soldiers like most:<br>  drinking<br>  sex<br>  drinking<br>  gambling<br>  drinking<br>  cursing<br>  drinking then sex followed by more drinking<br>  <br>  dont talk about "work" just do what chemically comes natural and he'll be happy|`|zW9W4ucbaa	I'm in the marines and these are a few thing that helped me when I got back. <br>  1. sex (not joking)<br>  2. this site made me think: <a href="http://278medic.blogspot.com/2005/12/returning-to-civilian-life-is-tough.html" rel="nofollow">http://278medic.blogspot.com/2005/12/ret...</a><br>  3. find things to do with him where you both are come and can talk. like fishing and theme parks help.<br>  4. no fireworks, no slamming metal trash cans, NO CLOSING DUMPSTERS FAST (they make the same noise as a mortar round)<br>  5 if he seems distant or unemotional don't worry give him 5 minuets to himself then come back (its a faze it'll where off in about 3 mounts)<br>  6. smile more<br>  7. go on dates that are fun like amusement parks<br>  8. get him an airsoft gun if he needs to release stress.<br>  9. if he likes video games get an Xbox 360 with live (trust me on this its very therapeutic to bad mouth a 10 year old little punk kid and then light him on fire with a flame thrower.) <br>  hope this helped ^_^
esOaJoqBaa	I doubt there is a person in the military that has not been chewed out at least once. Everybody screws up sometime, and there is usually someone there to yell at you for it. As long as it only happens once, then it is not a big deal, when you mess the same thing up over and over that is when the real yelling starts.|`|mzk0t6Ovaa	If you haven't been reamed at least once in a career, you're either<br>  the most STRAC troop around or you're a butt snorkeler.<br>  <br>  While I haven't been at the POA in front of the old man's desk for<br>  the past 25 years or so, the memories of those two visits are still<br>  very vivid.  The first one, the skipper was on me loud enough that<br>  it was pretty easy to hear it all the way up on the bridge from his<br>  cabin.  That one sucked because everyone was goofing on me for<br>  getting hammered.  It did not, however, suck as much as the second<br>  one where the CO just sat at his table looking at me over his coffee<br>  mug, talking very quietly.  That whole "you're an embarassment, I'm <br>  disappointed in you, and you have something to offer this organization"<br>  really hit home more than getting chewed up and down.  The message<br>  the CO delivered has stayed with me since that day in 1983, <br>  and I have never been in trouble since.<br>  <br>  If you do get chewed on by the CO, don't get a case of the ***.  Try to <br>  learn from it and not repeat the performance that earned you a "private<br>  audience."|`|fsjIeVpRaa	You should know that every recruit that went through basic has been chewed out by their Drill Instructor/Sergeant.  Even if we done things profoundly correct!<br>  <br>  No...I never had been chewed out by my Commanding Officer.  I, on the other hand, had chewed out my Commanding Officer once!<br>  <br>  Those butter bars sometimes think they know how to run a platoon.  I been in longer than him, and have more experience.  If a Lieuy thinks they know-it-all, I'll press my years of service in that young kid's face and teach him the ropes,  but with tact and bearing!<br>  <br>  That is the duty of a platoon sergeant, ensure the CO is adapting and evolving into a great platoon leader.  I correct his mistakes because I do not want him making faulty decisions when stuff starts hitting the fan....that gets Marines killed!<br>  <br>  Sounds like that you are a Marine that is about to enter into the Fleet Marine Force community...congrats to becoming within "Our Gun Club" [if I am correct about you]<br>  <br>  The Fleet isn't that bad; it becomes more laid back than being in recruit training, SOI (for the first initial time), and MOS school.  You do your job as expected, with the least amount of flaws, you shall have no problems.<br>  <br>  And you should know that the Officers are the "nice" ones.  You should really worry about the NCO and SNCOs; and the CWOs, we are the ones that are not supposed to be "nice", but it can be warranted...we respect our junior ranks!  Our junior Marines are the workhorse and the foundation of the Corps.  Just keep your nose clean, that is all we ask of you, and you shall have no fear!|`|npMVWV7raa	You will get chewed out in "public" by DIs. Most NCOs/SNCOs depending on the situation will not chew you out in front of other Marines in most cases unless you did something really dumb like flagging someone on the range. For officers (warrant and commissioned) you rarely see them chew out someone. I have witness a public NJP where a fellow Marine at MOS school was stripped of his rank and chewed out for smoking marijuana by the CO. My class and I were there to witness the event and the CO wanted to make an example with this Marine.|`|BIQrsl4paa	Sure have, more than once too. The last time it happened, I was an E7, getting ready to retire and I pi$$ed off my First Sergeant when he told me he was going to try to take a stripe from me and I told him he didn't have the authority.<br>  He yelled and screamed and all I did was stand there and smile at him. I out-processed the next week and he got fired from his position 2 weeks later.|`|BUI2nlUVaa	That's what boot camp is all about.  They yell and scream just to mind freak you.  Most times it's not necessary but the stress level helps you prepare for combat also how to think under pressure.  There are reasons for what they do in boot.  it is tried and true.  <br>  <br>  Once out it's just like any other job, if you screw up your boss will come down on you, if you do your job you're fine.|`|SEPButscaa	If you are being yelled at in front of everyone else, it's likely because you made a mistake they don't want anyone else to make, or because the situation doesn't permit a more personal (one might even say intimate) verbal correction.<br>  <br>  The loud public reprimands aren't they ones worry about.  It's when your CO has you in his office, all by yourself, and proceeds to tell you how very disappointed he is, and perhaps you should consider whether you have any business in this profession, that you should worry.  In fact, do everything in your power is make such a conversation unnecessary.|`|bRp9tsOXaa	Not just yes but HELL YES..! If you never get your butt reamed then you've just got to be doin' something wrong.

But don't forget, he is head of the RNC. Not just conservatives. <br>  <br>  We need to get people away from partisanship and get the like minded people that feel something is wrong with our politicians. Once we see thet we agree on that., we can get decent democrats and republicans in office and drum out the pelosi/waters type scum. <br>  <br>  The hardest part will be the koolade drinkers.

AA11494150	The driver has control of the car, even if the contents do not belong to him.  If consent was given, the search is legal.<br>  <br>  Advising the occupants to leave their belongings inside the vehicle could be a safety concern, so it is reasonable|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	Sorry...but this wasn't an illegal search.<br>  The judge will accept that the officer had reason to pull you---and after that, its all pretty much a done deal.<br>  <br>  And as to testing, they might in fact ask her to do so.<br>  <br>  I was in watching court one day, and a young man showed up in court with a stash. When the judge asked him to empty his pockets, he freaked out...but he was nailed.<br>  <br>  Never never try to play amateur lawyer, especially with a judge.|`|hDOBfBZeaa	When the driver gave consent, he also gave consent to search all of the items within his vehicle. When she exited the car, she should have taken the purse with her, then they would have had to ask her directly. You got pulled over legally, 17-18 year olds smoking black and milds? That is too obvious, there may be people smoking blunts in the car. My advice? Smoke out of sight....<br>  <br>  She won't get "tested", its a simple yes or no...she can pay or see the judge and try to explain.|`|2nRfalrkaa	Not only was consent given, but I am sure the officer also smelled the pungent odor of marijuana which would also allow the search of any area possibly containing marijuana.|`|bd035cd5fbed641889c4230d224d60d3aa	A cop can pull you over for any reason pretty much. Once you consent to the search, it's a done deal. I don't know what the drug laws are in your state, but she probably needs an attorney.|`|d1FyCl6Yaa	Nothing was illegal about the search because the driver of the vehicle gave consent.

2TsYvbOPaa	First off, the "Stars and Bars" DID NOT promote slavery, The Confederate flag was used to determine the South from the North.  AS you can see, the American Flag was red, white and blue, this was the North.  The Confederate Flag was also red, white and blue but with a different pattern to show the South.<br>  This also helped the soldiers if they came in contact with each other to show which side they were on|`|WmgZTJZ3aa	I'm not an expert but I do like history so here goes.<br>  <br>  #1 The war officially started as retaliation for the hostile military action of firing on fort Sumpter by the Confederate state of Virgina<br>  <br>  #2 The Stars and Bars<br>  <br>  #3 Texas <br>  <br>  #4 Robert E. Lee|`|809fe92a5e8a388fd9915476812d008caa	1)Southern states started to seceede after the election of Abraham Lincoln, who was a member of the Republican party that advocated limiting slavery. Southerners felt that the country was turning against slavery, which was important to the southern economy, and that northerners might attempt to outlaw the practice. Southerners have claimed that they were fighting over 'states rights' but the right in question was the right to own slaves, so, slavery--and the preservation of the union--were the main causes of the war. The actual war is percieved to have started when the South Carolina attacked fort sumter, a federally controlled fort in Charleston harbor.<br>  2) No flag promoted slavery per se, but the Confederate flag (which was actually a battle flag, and not the political flag of the south) is now widely associated with slavery.<br>  3) Virginia was the most populous slave state; Texas was physically the largest.

BUT, when it comes to the bottom line, I dont think anybody that is opposed to the U.S. would want to see either of us in a dark alley, or look down the barrel of a 120mm smooth bore cannon on an M1 (which both the marines and the army have).

When are you going to every realize that they are equal? Yes you can come up with times where the Marines "saved" the Army or fought first, but you could also do the same in the Army's favor. Just like how my recruiter has a book written about him when he had to go in and save the Marines asses in Fallujah.It's funny how you have never even been anywhere in the military, yet you know all of this knowledge. And about how the Army has more deaths because they are "not trained as good" is complete hogwash. Did you ever notice that the Army has wayy more soldiers then the Marines have Marines? Therefore there are a lot more soldiers that could be possibly killed. Makes sense doesn't it dumbass.  All in all i still respect you for joining the military, just lose the attitude. Good luck|`|9sUzi1eTaa	I don't know, but these are some cool quotes man!|`|7idyT7Obaa	you obviously havent deployed yet.<br>  <br>  good for you, you found a bunhc of old quotes. i'm sure if i dug around i could find enough quotes about how smoking is good for you.<br>  <br>  keep in mind that a lot of the army guys that die are weekend warriors...nto part of the real army.<br>  <br>  anyway, to answer your question: because theres more units in the army.<br>  <br>  and if you want to talk about who's better: heres a timeline of Fallujah:<br>  <br>  82nd takes it by force, beats it to submission, and has it under thier thumb.<br>  hands it over to marines: marines loose control of it<br>  82nd comes back, retakes Fallujah easily.<br>  <br>  no offense, but your in DEP, you havent deployed yet so you have no right to talk about iraq.<br>  <br>  oh and 90% of the missions are done by marines? and u know this how? by taking to a marine recruiter? think about it: if most of the country is occupied by the army, who is running more missions? <br>  you work your own sector, thts how the occupation works.<br>  <br>  and simply put, they're not the best of the best. If you really wanna be the 'best of hte best' join SFG or go PJ in the airforce. the "best of the best" of the marines, the recon units, are on the same level as the rangers...and SFG are definately a step above them<br>  <br>  but whatever, im a vet whos been awarded for valor in combat, im not gonna argue with someone who wont even make it through training since all he is joining for is an identity that he didnt even forge himself|`|BQG15WsHaa	Please, do not make assumptions... If the Army does all the stand by stuff.... how come the Army alone has 3,000+ casualties? While the Marines only have 1000. They are both just as tough.

Not sure as to why the Army's are longer though.<br>  <br>  Edit: nobody ever said Marines weren't badass, that they are.. but you made a moot point when you say the Army isn't trained as well as the Marines.

The Army has more personnel than the Marine Corp, so the rotations to the sand box for the Army are longer, and less frequent 8-12 months between deployments. while the Marine Corp has less personnel they still are deploying as much as we do just less time.

gasquENMaa	Due process by itself means that certain rules apply in criminal cases. Steps must be followed and rules of evidence apply. In smaller cases, these items are moderately simple. The larger the case, the more steps and personnel are involved and if any step is skipped or overlooked, the lawyers can have a field day in court, eventually having a case thrown out due to his clients "rights" having been violated. <br>  <br>  Due process prevents a police state from taking over, but it also clogs the legal system with lawyers going over each and every step. As an example, quite a few departments now have Miranda rights printed out on a form that a person automatically signs when arrested and booked. This helps to cover any evidenciary hearings about a person claiming he was not read his rights when questioned after arrest. The arrest itself cannot be disputed, but any questions asked and answers given cannot be used in court if they are not freely given and Miranda has not been advised. <br>  <br>  Basically, due process has taught law enforcement to cross all their "t's and dot all their "i"s when doing their reports.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps and you can find it useful

mv0IKzEUaa	Uh you do realize Popular Mechanics is paid propaganda right?<br>  <br>  Here is proof of hundreds of Architects and Engineers who dont support the official story:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ae911truth.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ae911truth.org/</a><br>  <br>  And Richard Gage is one of them. Here is an interesting series which many sheep should watch if they still believe in the the ridiculous official story.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rW6Oez7pag0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rW6Oez7pa...</a><br>  <br>  Popular Mechanics  and NIST couldn't even refute many claims including the most damming evidence - the presence of MOLTEN STEEL identified by firefighters, engineers and Controlled Demolition as shown in this video:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.livevideo.com/video/690AB7EDCAD4441AA2F39299FD87017C/9-11-molten-steel.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.livevideo.com/video/690AB7EDC...</a><br>  <br>  When confronted with the Molten Steel argument Popular Mechanics and NIST deny there was no Molten steel at all! Because if they accepted the presence of Molten Steel they that would mean Thermite was used to bring those three towers down. NIST, Popular Mechanics and other debunking sites now say it was Aluminum from the planes! But the Molten Steel was glowing orange and unfortunately for them under the laws of physics Aluminum will always stay silver regardless of temperature. In fact if you want proof showing Aluminium stays silvery then refer to the Richard Gage video.<br>  <br>  Here is proof of New World Order:<br>  <br>  “The main purpose of the Council on Foreign Relations is promoting the disarmament of U.S. sovereignty and national independence and submergence into an all powerful, one world government.”<br>  <br>  ---Admiral Chester Ward, former CFR member and Judge Advocate General of the U.S. Navy<br>  <br>  "We shall have world government whether or not you like it, by conquest or consent." Statement by Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) member James Warburg to The Senate Foreign Relations Committee on February 17th, l950<br>  <br>  EDIT: YES I have read the following links a long time ago and no I do not buy it. Just to let you know I have researched BOTH sides of the debate and the official story is becoming less convincing.<br>  I'll be happy to give you some links as well|`|kX4JPvwwaa	What I've read from both sites is chock full of assumptions, which kind of puts them on par with the conspiracy theories themselves.<br>  <br>  Example:  "...pretend thermite can burn sideways to melt vertical columns. Maybe with some device but no working device has been proven to me to work. While there are relatively large canisters which can burn small holes sideways, I have yet to see this elusive steel cutting technique used to cut a vertical column."<br>  <br>  Who is this guy?  The fact that nothing has been shown to HIM means the whole thing is debunked?  That's pretty faulty logic.<br>  <br>  Nothing written there addresses the fact that burning jet fuel and office equipment doesn't burn hot enough to melt steel, or whatever other type of metal it was that was pouring out of the corner of the tower.|`|OaQWUfNoaa	I don't believe in conspiracies, and I never have. And yes, I have visited Debunking 911 (which rationally and considerately explains everything). People who believe in the conspiracy will never let themselves be convinced they are wrong- they have formulated a hypothesis (however fanciful it may be) and have fitted what 'evidence' they can to this and ignored other facts.<br>  <br>  Another site is www.911myths.com it is very much the same as Debunking 911.|`|3785eeef30e9bd9c24c59001fddabeb6aa	I don't think 9/11 was a controlled demolition.  I still think it was a false flag attack.|`|AWSmknxLaa	those are not real source<br>  <br>  They are written by people who live in the closet and wear tin foil hats.|`|wvAhCsxqaa	Those are both highly sponsored, highly false programs. What they say is simply not true. But hell, I am an engineer (bioengineer), so allow an engineer to explain:<br>  <br>  Many technical analyses cast doubt on the official explanation of the collapse of three World Trade Center buildings, including those presented by an impressive new group: Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth. More difficult than discovering the truth, however, is convincing most of the public to accept the bitter truth.<br>  <br>  Americans easily block out painful truths. Powerful societal forces keep much of the population distracted and uninterested in complex issues. Entertainment-oriented mainstream media contribute to mass ignorance. And the political establishment often buries the truth, uses propaganda and manipulates citizens. Intelligent, strong-willed people can fight all these.<br>  <br>  But on a deeper level, many truths are blocked psychologically, because they produce too much pain. This results when truths sharply disagree with strongly held beliefs. The conflict produces cognitive dissonance that can block full acceptance of the disturbing truth. People fall victim to self-manipulation and self-delusion. Truths are dismissed and false beliefs remain embedded.<br>  <br>  When it comes to 9/11, we face the strong belief that only Al-Qaeda caused 9/11. But analyses by many experts reveal the collapse of three WTC buildings was not caused by the two airplanes exploding into the two towers. Without getting into details that one can spend many hours examining on a number of websites, the general view is that the buildings were brought down by controlled demolition.<br>  <br>  If correct – IF – the immediate reaction is like a cosmic big bang. It would have taken considerable effort by a number of people with expertise and access to the buildings to rig them so that they could be intentionally collapsed when the two jets hit the towers. Tough questions flood in: Who could have engineered all this? Could foreign agents accomplish such complex actions – and if they did, why not take credit for it? If Americans did it, why would they intentionally inflict inevitable mass death and devastation? Worse, they seemingly knew about the plan to fly the jets into the towers.<br>  <br>  Post-9/11, why have the government and official investigations not come to the same controlled demolition conclusion? This might be explained if the government was involved.<br>  <br>  Pull one string and the whole 9/11 story unravels as your imagination triggers unending questions. Can Americans support a reinvestigation and rethinking of the 9/11 event? Or would they rather avoid even more pain and preserve the official account that places all blame on Al-Qaeda? So easy to criticize those who offer different explanations as conspiracy nuts.<br>  <br>  After all, the new truth would be so shocking that we would have to question our political and government system. Could there have been such malevolence somewhere in our government? Did a monumental conspiracy push us into attacks on Afghanistan and Iraq? Did petroleum and corporate interests shape 9/11?<br>  <br>  Like other groups, Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth wants a new, honest and comprehensive study that considers all the evidence for controlled demolition. First, let the technical truth emerge. Then, if necessary, cope with the inevitable political, conspiracy and other questions. But let us not allow a possible painful truth block the primary task of determining once and for all what caused the collapse of the WTC towers and building no. 7.<br>  <br>  If there were non-Muslim forces – possibly U.S. government ones – that played a major role in the WTC catastrophe, then let us have the courage to face the truth. Suppose some element of our government played a secret, awful role. If we do not uncover it, then we are vulnerable to repeat nefarious and unimaginable activity in the future – possibly to impact the 2008 presidential election. Discovering 9/11 truth would enshrine the wisdom of the old adage: the truth hurts. That means suffering the pain of revealing lies and cover-ups. Mourning over the deaths of building victims and heroic first responders would expand with new anger. And another reason to hate and oppose the Iraq war would surface.<br>  <br>  If those that believe the official 9/11 story – especially elected officials – trust their views, then let them support a serious investigation to test the validity of the controlled demolition hypothesis. If they fear and reject doing so, then let us see that as suspicious and unacceptable.<br>  <br>  As a former engineering professor with growing skepticism about the official WTC story, I joined Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth; you can learn about the controlled demolition findings and other similar truth-seeking efforts at www.ae911truth.org. You choose: seek the truth yourself or take the easy way and just criticize those who question the official story.<br>  <br>  To sum up, horrific possible answers can cause us to shu

Wage garnishment is next 1 They can legally take 1/3 of her taxable income before taxes and she will never see an income tax refund until that bill is paid in full.<br>  <br>  She probably thinks they won't garnish her pay.

If you violate your probation in any way-especially for the same offense, you will go to jail if you have a warrant for your arrest.<br>  The judge may order you to do unscheduled alcohol/drug testing,community service or a short time in jail-a few months to a year-since you repeated this offense.<br>  <br>  It's good that you got a lawyer. It just doesn't look good for you since you have a history of alcohol abuse and arrests for the same issue. If this was your first time it would be another story.|`|tCZnLNoaaa	What is your problem.  When you drink and drive YOU COULD KILL SOMEONE.     I would really like to see you have to sit in a room and listen to people who have lost family members due to drunk drivers.

They might be able to help you out.  Maybe your lawyer can get you some kind of deal, like time in the residential program counting towards your sentence?  It's still going to be really tough, the fines you could be facing would be more than enough to empty my savings account ... and your license will be suspended for a long time.<br>  <br>  You seem to be trying to deal with this situation and I hope you have very good luck.  Hopefully the court will see that the time in the residential program will do you more good than time in a jail cell.<br>  <br>  As much as I hate drunk drivers ... I think that if someone wants to go straight the system should try to meet them half way.  You won't get off without consequences, but if you are ready to change for the better ... I hope the system helps your rehabilitation effort!  The best you can hope for is significant fines, a suspended license for quite a while ... and a sentence that counts your residential rehab time towards your jail sentence.  Good luck!

T8nap2Pnaa	You can't get one based on your marriage if your wife is a legal permanent resident. she can file an immigration petition for you, but that would take at least 5 years before it's valid for use.until then, it doesn't provide any immigration benefits. You could only get an EAD based on your marriage if she was an American citizen and filed a number of forms including a work authorization request.

f36531cfc5056db27dde00a32fcfe48baa	Don't buy anything!  The AF has a "Blue to Gold" program where you get out of your enlistment a few months early and go directly into an ROTC program at an acceptable college or university.  You could also go to OCS (Officer Candidate School).  Talk to your retention NCO, he should be able to show you the proper steps.  Also ask around to the officers you know, at least one of them will have been prior service and will be able to help you.|`|L2tQ7t6Faa	I'm in the same boat but I used a sample OTS package|`|gLG7zxQuaa	There are some colleges that have Air Force ROTC programs that you can take without having to enlist (first two years, unless you receive a scholarship then you must enlist). Even if you enlist it is a good idea to try ROTC. You would have to join the reserves during college and then serve after college for a certain amount of years (I plan on doing this through Army ROTC). It is also never a bad idea to talk to a recruiter about it (they might have more info)

By the time you go to court and receive sentence, you should be well over this time period. Taking your statement above at a face value of having quit and not smoking anymore, you should test clean. Your first test will be on your visit to your Probation Officer to establish your base line, which will be a week or two after court. <br>  <br>  You will have a set of rules ( called sanctions) written out by your PO that you will be expected to follow. Nothing bad, but urine testing for drugs and alcohol is one of them. Keep your nose clean, do your time and a year after it is all done, talk to your lawyer about having the misdemeanor record expunged from your record so it will not hinder you as an adult in jobs or apartment hunting.<br>  <br>  Best of luck and I hope this is useful to you|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	There will be not only one but a judge ordered series of several after the court date to make sure you stay clean.

It shows that you don't have a habit/past of this issue.<br>  <br>  The judge may just have you do community service and weekly unscheduled drug tests since this is your first time being arrested and don't have any kind of background in this.

If this was at least 30 days ago, you should pass a urine test anyway unless you were a heavy smoker.  Why don't you think you'd pass the test?

The purpose of the notwithstanding clause is to ensure the balance of power, if you will, resides with elected parliamentarians and not the courts.<br>  <br>  So your question becomes one of whether the courts are at pace with the will of the people. To invoke the clause of course limits certain Charter rights for individuals or groups of people. As a result it should be used sparingly.<br>  <br>  The most famous use of the clause was to limit minority language rights in Quebec. The Supreme Court found that a section of Bill 101, which required French-only signs in Quebec, was contrary to Freedom of Expression rights in the Charter. <br>  <br>  The Quebec government, representing the majority of Quebecois, invoked the notwithstanding clause, thus removing this Charter guarantee from the minority. This seems contrary to the protection of minority rights that the Charter is supposed to guarantee.
X3YtZ9Fsaa	if hes just away for basic and not ait then he will be gone for probally about 11-12 weeks. ten for basic and the remaining for reception.  He should be able to call at least once a week in red phase, the first three weeks, then probally 2 or three times a week depending on the company and drill seargent. If he has to do AIT as well it could be between 25-50 weeks depending on the MOS. The national gaurd is simple you just show up one weekend a month, do your MOS, and go home.  Two weeks are done in the summer to train, its really just one long drill.  Air force basic is i think 4 weeks long, but i dont know much about them.  Not as physically demanding as the ARMY i know and they are call TI's not drill seargents i think.  Hope this helps
T3OGT4Ntaa	It disqualifies you, yes, but that doesn't mean you can't get a waiver.  I'm in the process of joining the Marine Corps with a titanium rod in my tibia (lower half of my leg).  They required me to get a note from my surgeon saying things like I had no pain, the hardware would never become a problem, it doesn't interfere with normal activity, etc.  A femur is more serious, but my OSOs told me about a guy that got a waiver for hardware in his spine!|`|Wk5VO7tuaa	this sucks i'm denied from ever joining due to medical reasons. idk they have whole books pretty much on what deem you ineligible

AK4OemrIaa	Good thing they are deporting her before the baby is born. Because if the baby was born in the U.S., they wouldn't be able to deport her. I'm not against immigrants, I'm an immigrant myself, but I AM against illegal aliens.<br>  <br>  Did you know pregnant women (especially from Mexico) come to the U.S. illegally within the final days of their pregnancy, camp by a hospital, than when they are ready to have the baby, they walk straight into the emergency room. We can't deny them service, so the baby is born as a U.S. citizen and the illegal mother gets to stay. Guess who pays for the hospital bill she couldn't pay for: the hard working taxpayer.|`|484fd75888bbb282b3da584ad880893aaa	Don't worry. Even if your baby is born in another country it could still get citizenship through you. But if you have no plans on marrying the mother then you may just have to accept that it will be staying with her. Maybe you could go and visit them for a holiday now and then. :-)|`|AA10045620	Sorry, but once you plant the seed, it is up to your g/f as to what she will do with the pregnancy.  She actually should go home and have the child there with familiar family surroundings, and at the cost of her own country, not ours.  You can visit.|`|OLXv3DEAaa	I don't think they delay deportation because the mother is pregnant. If you're a US citizen then the baby will be one no matter where it is born. You just need to make sure you get all the paperwork done correctly in her country, get your name on the birth certificate, etc. The fact that she is the mother of a US citizen may help her to return more quickly or give her a better chance once she is allowed to re-apply to enter the US? <br>  <br>  I think she should see an immigration attorney though, before she is deported. They may have some way to keep her here, or make it so that she can return legally more quickly. I believe usually when people are deported they get a reentry ban for a certain number of years, so if there's anything to do to prevent that she should figure it out before being deported.|`|H7SQEM4Daa	Since you aren't married,you have no options.

If you can not wait till you are 21 you have a serious problem!|`|3gljWitCaa	the US has the highest drinking age in the world...21<br>  where im from its 18 and 19, depending on the province<br>  <br>  i believe if you can make a choice to defend your country at 18, yall should be allowed to have a few beers at 18 too<br>  <br>  thats just my opinion<br>  <br>  hollyy|`|hPXu5RzTaa	Hell yes!! Anyone who puts their life on the line for the country that they love and the young age of 18 should at least be able to drink drink a beer if they want. Hell they are gonna do it anyways when they have a chance.|`|GHD8JicSaa	They tried an 18 year old drinking law back when they lowered the voting age to 18.   While there was no problem with 18 year olds voting..there sure was a problem with them drinking...<br>  <br>  So vote at 18,  drink at 21.....and not go kill your friends at an early age.|`|Jklpfaecaa	hell yes!!! all military personal 18 and up should be allowed to drink in moderation that is my opinion and i think there is alot of ppl out there that would Support this|`|rwGTRUj0aa	your body isnt developed enough to handle alcohol intake at 18.|`|sgEloO1Jaa	no troll|`|k76mr7rKaa	I just finished up a Mess night with a bunch of marines from my company, every marine there above the age of 18 was allowed to drink LEGALLY. <br>  <br>  I know many people don't know this, but as long as your CO allows and supervises it anyone 18 years or older can drink while on base.|`|s2hPHAPmaa	hell yes if we can go be shoot at for a living we can drink <br>  <br>  most people (cough.......cough) just drink any way<br>  <br>  and ta the guy above me if some ones outta it enough to kill his friend hes not all there or doin more than drinking|`|V3b5UaXsaa	tell you what, law is law and you volunteered for service.

tqD9xUpYaa	I would think OSHA could visit any company at any reasonable time and expect cooperation.|`|AA10132204	They can visit any company they wish within the USA.  A company has a right to refuse them entry.  What happens next is that the OSHA people will go to the nearest Federal judge and get a search warrant for the premises.  Refusing them entry is usually enough to get the warrant. It is best to welcome the OSHA people.<br>  <br>  There are things that should be done.  Before allowing them past the lobby, the credentials should be checked with the OSHA office to ensure the inspectors are suppose to be there.  The company should ask the specifics of what they want to see and only take them to those places on site.  The company should then insist on a formal wrap up meeting so no surprises or misunderstandings arise.|`|GFOdY3nBaa	someone called them in there. you can ask them not to come in and talk to anybody, next thing you know you are dealing with every other government and licensing agencies. if they are there, its for a reason, there was a complaint they are investigating, and for them it will look like this - the more trouble you create, the more suspicious you seem to be, and you just make their decision easier.|`|BUI2nlUVaa	osha can walk into a business at any time and demand to see osha logs.  it is required that businesses cooperate with them.  just as the fda has a right to inspect any food handling business anywhere in america.  we are a federalist nation meaning that the federal government trumps all state governments.  this is why pot is illegal in california even though it has been approved by the state.  the dea can still come in and seize it.|`|U63ll2BWaa	but they do if some person who works there called and reported a violation.

How about Corpsman...you some feminist or something?  The Marine Corps doesn't have room for those types!<br>  <br>  "Horseplay leads to sickbay"...I like that quote!|`|9tcv3TiWaa	You need to check with a Recruiter about females going into the Corpsman Rating in the Navy.  Currently there is very limited if any space available for females in that Rating because of it being overmanned.  This includes both Medical & Dental areas as they combined the Ratings several years ago.    If you do get in then it will depend on what field you choose to be a HM.  There is various ones from dental to x-ray to everything in between.  You can be assigned Sea or Shore commands including Marine bases.
GFOdY3nBaa	i think its five years. but the most they can get you for is tresspassing,and since you were a minor, and no police involved, you can get them for harrassment. they should know better than to make a child sign anything and then try to inforce it. i would go back as often as possible and pray they do something about it. just dont steal anymore lol. then you can get them for some nice appology and paycheck. just be smart about it .|`|U63ll2BWaa	let it go and keep shopping there. if the police we not called and they filed no charges against you they can not get you for trespassing which is what the charge would be.|`|sA7Zhk3Gaa	try to talk to the manager to let him know that you've turned over a new leaf then perhaps he'll let you in :)|`|AA11521202	The woman made you sign papers?!?!?!?

You can apply for the MECEP while you are enlisted.  It'll be a good rapprochement for your career decision in becoming a Navy or Marine Officer.  This will ensure that you don't hinder nor lose any leeway, time of service, or wasted effort.

gasquENMaa	For first time offenders that are juveniles, the average sentence would be restitution for the value of the items stolen, a fine from $100 to $300, probation from 6 months to 1 year, banishment from that store for life  and probably community service. <br>  <br>  If any of them have prior convictions of theft on their records, the fine/probationary times would be increased. <br>  <br>  If the amounts shoplifted were above that state's felony limits, amounts will be increased.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps and you can find it useful<br>  Source(s):<br>  5 years with the Sheriff's Department and 20 years as a Corrections Officer in a max prison|`|kH0IxFa9aa	I helped a woman that shoplifted underwear from Nordstroms.<br>  She wore a size 42.<br>  She was sent to State prison.

di43MlSFaa	My family and I have been experiencing this downward spiral for the past two years and have been in survival mode for well over a year now. It's not scary per say, but can be numbing at times, especially when it comes to health issues, as there is no insurance any longer. That is the one area that is the most frightening. What if one of us gets really sick, what happens.<br>  On the flip side, the struggling has also spurred creativity in thinking and a renewed sense of self reliance. We look for opportunities that might have been thought of as ridiculous in the past, we've become much more flexible, we've even learned the art of bartering, doing favors or part time work on days off for other people and visa versus, in exchange for things each side might need, instead of outright cash because that might get spent foolishly.<br>  These are stressful times, but money will always be a part of the way things are, so it's more a mastering the idea that sure we get scared, but putting to work a different mindset. We're determined. <br>  As long as we're getting along, watching out for our neighbor's, keeping our friendships and relationships healthy, we're doing alright. We live a much more simple life now and that hasn't been all bad, but it's not easy, it is a struggle.<br>  If the worst were to happen and we lost the house, we have other arrangements in place, but we are not planning on having to go that route either.<br>  While it all can be disheartening sometimes, we have made ourselves a map towards the future so to speak, set our priorities and stick to them. We have all intentions to be fine, with the goal to come out the other side, worn perhaps but not beaten down and be able to purchase health care. That is one of our major priorities.<br>  It's going to be a good long while, but everything will turn around eventually. It's more a mind set than anything else. We intend to make it and so we will in some fashion.<br>  <br>  An older Independent|`|BIQrsl4paa	I'm scared that in 2011 we will be farther in the hole than we are now, by a significant margin, and Barry is still going to be trying to spend his way out of his mess, all the while telling people that 'the recession is going to take a long time to fix'.|`|Lc6o6w8Maa	I'm not scared of anything. Fear only makes our country vulnerable|`|Z5TuccoIaa	me|`|31GXcmBiaa	Not so worried about the economy.  Throughout history we see economic downturns.  The economic crisis as it is called is just a period that will pass when people are not so scared to invest.  I blame the speculators and the press.  Who is wanting to invest when they hear every day on the news that they will lose it all if they do this or that.  I am a little worried at how badly both Democrats and Republicans love to play the blame game.  its obama's fault because he did this and that or its bushs fault because he didnt do this or that.  You cant blame one particular person, if you do your ignorant.  There are millions that drive the economic machine not just one man.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Independent, not bound by any party and is opposed to partisan bickering..

We need to harness our intellectual horsepower and our can-do spirit, to develop the next "engine" of the economy.  The house of card we had the last 7 years came crashing down.  Our manufacturing base has been decimated.  I think rebuilding and repairing our infrastructure will build a foundation for the future economy.  But we need to develop new energy.  We can create and build it here, and the world will again be looking to us as the shining city on the hill.  Because our lights will be on!<br>  Just need to survive for the next 18 months, baby!

When the majority party in the legislature is the same party as the president, the power lies with him.

n2oEhdZiaa	In my experience when I was applying for law enforcement in an urban department, almost everybody had military experience, so it was definitely a plus.  Don't feel like you have to choose MP though... most MPs rarely do law enforcement and military law enforcement is different enough from civilian law enforcement that they would have to retrain you a lot anyway.  It would be much more enjoyable for you to find an MOS you find satisfying.  You will find a lot of cops in Guard MP units though, so it could be a good way to make connections there too.|`|VzBAzdfwaa	im doing the same thing as you joining the national guard as an mp to become a california highway patrol officer, because they will pay for my schooling too, i have talked to tons of officers and they said it is a big time plus you get veterans points, cause say if you went to apply and you only had you AA in criminal justice and the other kid had his AA and military experience he would get in before you cause he has something you dont. ive searched had havent found anything better that will help me out but go to schooling. you will be making 1500 a month during boot camp and AIT training then when you get out you work one weekend a month and two week out of the year and make 300 on the weekend and 1200 in that two weeks. but if your not willing to get deployed i wouldnt sign up cause it garantees no deployment for two years but i bet you will the other years. but the chances of die over in iraq are very slim. plus every think is paid for you living exspenses and food and clothing.|`|rW3IGBCsaa	joining the us army would be a better decision if your looking at going into law enforcement the united states army has the best training plus when your done your awarded points towards your city county or states police test for your training in the regular army|`|n8qg1nq3aa	Dont MP.

And it hasn't been voted on yet|`|zqPjdhgKaa	Obama has no say in the laws of California.  California laws are state laws.  People in California are trying to pass a law that would legalize marijuana.  If it passed it would be very similar to alcohol laws.  If you entered Starbucks and started drinking, they'd probably call the police on you.  Another reason they probably called the police, if this story is true is that it hasn't passed yet.  Also, just because California legalizes marijuana, the DEA and federal agencies can still charge people with the federal crime.  You can see this in medical marijuana plants in California.  Federal agents enter, dismantle and arrest the people because it is still illegal federally.|`|kH0IxFa9aa	LOL<br>  Your post sounds like something out of "Beavis and Butthead" lol<br>  A friend tells you to jump off the Golden Gate bridge, because they made the water softer, you'd do it wouldn't you, lol<br>  <br>  PS.<br>  Marijuana is legal in California.

5D4T6h7waa	Tell me about it. I read in the paper that a county near where i live wanted 100 million dollars included in a requested stimulus package to build a golden statue of him!  Are we serious?   I get it, hes black... but he's basically gone back on every word he used during the election to get elected.  Not one member of congress knew what was in the stimulus package, or cared to read it.  Not loaded with pork? I think so... and before you go defending him have any of YOU even bothered reading what that money went towards!  Go read it than tell me if you feel the same. ALSO, since he has been elected we have dropped 20% further into the hole.<br>  <br>  <br>  I just noticed someone said something about stem cells. THAT pisses me off. Obama made it legal, rather wants to make it legal  to harvest stem cells from babies. DEAD ABORTED BABIES. Do you know how old a dead aborted baby has to be for the stem cells to be viable?  OLD ENOUGH TO LIVE ON LIFE SUPPORT. go **** yourself.<br>  <br>  So yea and i totally don't want him to fail, because that's NOT what we need.  I just want him to STOP being treated like he's god or something.  I understand it takes time, but his rushing and packing money into businesses it doesn't belong isn't helping anyone. That's just my opinion.|`|76140b1733cd124dbe960a504bc06f8daa	Well, damn it, it's FUN to use the excuse, "He just got elected."

From my point of view Zachs was right.  He needs more time.  Actually, as with any other past presidents who were judged poorly during their time, historians had been more considerate after reviewing That president's performance from a distant viewpoint.<br>  <br>  It is understandable for a citizen to be impatient during a crisis to demand instant cure.  But even economists from all sides of the spectrum agree that for the economy to turn around requires understanding of the fundamentals of the problem, the willingness to participate in a reconstructive process to counteract the prevailing trend, and the resolve to go on with business notwithstanding the facts.  And they all agree that this takes time; however, they didn't all declare how much time it requires.  I tip my hat to all economists because of their bold predictions but lack of courage to give a deadline.<br>  <br>  The fact being that the economy, not only the U.S.'s but of the entire world, is at stake.  So jump-starting the U.S. economy is not only an American expectation but also that of the entire world.<br>  <br>  Now, to your question when supporters will stop justifying that "he just got elected?".  I think we should also consider the fact that detractors are also justifying their criticisms because of the slow results than that they were expecting.<br>  <br>  I am curious, if he were successful in his less than two months in office, what excuses would his detractors think of next?<br>  <br>  Just a thought and I'm not going for points.<br>  <br>  I hope that this is a legitimate intellectual exchange and not a biased questioned posed to incite readers into reacting.|`|AA11584265	AMEN......You are my hero!!! You took the words right out of my mouth. I am so sick and tired of all the Obama maniacs out there that say "oh give him time, he has a lot to undo since Bush screwed up so bad". I say name ONE thing that Bush screwed up...and don't say the war with IRAQ because personally that is nothing more than standing up for the rights of our nation. If we did not send troops over there then the Taliban would have certainly succeeded in destroying this nation piece by piece and we know they can do serious damage just take a look at the footage for 9-11 incase you have forgotten. <br>  <br>  At the rate we are going. This nation faces a second Civil War. What is going to be left for our children after Obama has had his spending spree? How do you propose we educate the leaders of tomorrow with budget cuts in the schools today? Sure....all you Obama followers can say "give him some time" but what are you going to do when that time he has been given puts you on skid row? All this money he is giving to major corporations and banks could be used elsewhere, like in the pockets of the American People. People are losing jobs daily and Obama has already spent over $3 Trillion Dollars. Is that BUSH's fault??? NO, He was not in office when that debt was incurred and it is the largest debt incurred in history and in only a matter of 50 days!!!!! WOW!!! Now that is some change folks!!!! So lets start hearing some real facts. We're tired of all the excuses.|`|GcQl76mfaa	It's been about 2 months. I suppose you have a date as to when the economy would have came back around were we to do nothing. The answer? Probably a decade, maybe much longer. Obama's just offering cushioning from the federal government to make the recession hit less hard. Economics after all, measures time, and you seem to think that 2 months is enough.  You also obviously haven't had that much to drink, because your judgment of Barkley's BAC is quite incorrect, and also irrelevant, sort of like your assumption that they are good friends (where'd you get that idea?)

You can't expect the economy to be fixed in the 2 months he has been office, or a significant change.  When a law is passed it still takes time for the effects of the law to take place.  This is why it takes many years for things to effect the economy.  Clinton started the downward spiral of the economy and he was in office more than 8 years ago.  Patience is needed in politics.  You will start seeing changes in time.|`|U2qRvH2laa	Give em about 3 and 1/2 years or so to get their bearings.

CZlUhRfkaa	How are the hours usually for a Dispatcher?<br>       My agency works 12 hour shifts (6a-6p and 6p-6a).  3 days one week, 4 the next.  We also have mandatory overtime (MOT) which puts us on call appx 2 shifts a month.  Some agencies work 8 hour shiffts, some work 10 hour shifts.  I do love the 12 hour shifts though.<br>  <br>  Do they still have time to spend with their family?<br>       Working 12 hour shifts leaves plenty of time for family.  If you time it right, you can take 2 days off of work and have a whole week off!  Also keep in mind though since the job never closes you do miss out on family stuff as well.  You can't always be there and it does take a special and understanding family to make it all work.<br>  <br>  What does the job entail?<br>       Every agency is set up differently.  My agency dispatches for the Sheriff's Office, Highway Patrol (DPS), Various small county Police Departments, Parks and Wildlife, Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission (TABC), Constables, multiple Fire Departments, EMS for the entire county, etc. etc.etc.  I primarily dispatch EMS and Fire.  My agency does have 9-1-1 calltakers as well but we are limited and we also answer an abundance of 9-1-1 calls ourselves.  It usually works out ok but it does get difficult sometimes taking your own medical call and having to dispatch at the same time, especially during major calls such as CPR, Childbirth, Choking, etc.  <br>  I've been dispatching for 14 years, primarily EMS and EMS Helicopter dispatching.  I love it and can't see myself doing anything different.  Working in public safety is such a rewarding job.  You don't hear much appreciation from the public to the 9-1-1 centers because they never see us therefore we are usually forgotten but knowing that you did your part to help is usually good enough for me.  Everyone at work, whether it be others in the 9-1-1 center or the personnel on the streets, is considered family.  We spend many hours together in very stressful times.  We spend a lot of holidays together.  In the long run, it's all worth it.  I can remember every call that has made it's mark on me..good and bad.  There is nothing like the feeling of knowing that you helped to save someone's life.  <br>  This job isn't always glamorous.  There are rough times where you want to pull your hair out.  There are times when you just want to step away but you know there are people counting on you and somehow, you always make it through the shift and you still keep coming back for more.  <br>  Not everyone can do the job but it is worth everyone's time to give it a try.  Like I said, I love my job.|`|AA12351814	The hours for a dispatcher can be eight hours a day for five days or 12 hours a day for four days a week.  Time spent with family has to be planned ahead of time because dispatchers work nights, holidays and weekends. <br>  Being a dispatcher is a job you must love to do if you are to last long.  It has very boring times and you have to find something to keep your mind busy and awake at all times.  You will be talking to other people who are possibly having the worst day of their lives.  They look to you for answers and a good outcome.  <br>  An emergency dispatcher will handle medical, fire and police emergencies.  These are never pleasant and take some time to get used to.  If you want to help people and are willing to make sacrifices the job is something you can be very proud of at the end of the day.|`|H4AalWftaa	1. I think they have work time.<br>  2. Yes.<br>  3. From the information
T8nap2Pnaa	Basically, you can't change the information you gave on your visa application. you can write a letter and say the things you're talking about here, but it won't matter much. the other question would be, why would this person deny knowing you, if she did? what was the point of that? It makes it look worse, like there was actually something to hide. are the people you stayed with planning to invite a new Peruvian every month? anyway, the best thing you could do is return home. at least they'll know you haven't become an illegal alien in the US, even if you did mislead them about how long you intended to stay.
