0eQt44CLaa	When training with others or working in a team, members need to be able to trust and believe in each other. If they are unable to do this, they're probably not going to take directions or listen to advice--especially in difficult or challenging times. So when you give feedback so a peer, tell him or her with confidence and sincerity. If possible, give two pieces of positive feedback with every negative one. In that way you can make the member feel valued while giving constructive advice.<br>  <br>  Each team member should feel that they have an important role in the team, and that his or her function is essential and of equal importance.|`|Z0GfGZtJaa	Start your sentence with "Just some constructive advise..."<br>  Or lie " I overheard someone say that you could improve your performance if you did........."<br>       Good Luck|`|E9JigTskaa	giving the feed back is as much about your training as it is your peers,<br>  <br>  give positive feedback as much as negative, use "i" statements and be fair. do not get personal.<br>  <br>  if your peer does take to heart ask them to reflect back to you what it is that they feel went well and what they felt they could have done better on.
3TQCwtxJaa	I don't know where you go to school but when I was in college, it was never that strict. At the university I went to, they told us we were adults. While it was mandatory you attended on the first day of class as well as for any exams, in some classes what you did the rest of the semester was your business. If you failed because you never came to class, that was your problem. Some classes did have policies but for the most part it always came down to if you could furnish a doctor's note, you were off the hook. I don't think they made a big deal out of it if you missed less than 5 classes. <br>  2, now that's just crazy!<br>  Missing class never threatened my financial aid, only my grades did.<br>  <br>  In my personal opinion, you go off to college and for most young adults, that is their first chance at being off on their own. Their first experience with the real world. You are able to live away from your parents, cook for yourself, have roommates, and develop as a grown up. I do not think attendance policies are needed. The college is able to acknowledge you as an adult to let you live without parents on their campus, they need to completely acknowledge you as an adult and if you choose to miss class, fail, and get thrown out of school, well that should not be the school's problem. As long as it is clear there are consequences to failing, nothing else should matter.|`|AA11526235	Both positions miss the point.  Nonattendance might cause lower grades or failure anyway, so why beat students over the head with it?  There are a variety of legitimate reasons for nonattendance which seem to be ignored until they occur--illness being one of them.  Each professor should have the right to set attendance requirements for his/her own class, but they must be consistant within themselves.  By the time students reach college level, it's time for them to take responsibility for their own actions and choices without somebody telling them what to do or threatening to "spank" them, so let them grow up.  College teaches more than one kind of lesson.|`|cMZEmpp0aa	On the one hand, I can see the point that college students are adults who should be able to take responsibility for themselves and their actions, and that if they want to skip class they should know the consequences and be able to make the judgments for themselves whether it's worth it or not. Unfortunately, long experience in college (first as a student and then as a teaching assistant) has shown me that many if not most college students are adults only according to the law -- i.e. they may have reached the age of majority but they sure as hell don't act like it. <br>  <br>  Personally, I see college as similar to a job. In a job, you're expected to show up (however showing up is defined by that job), do the work you're given, and finish that work on time. You can take a certain number of days off, and you may have to meet certain criteria (like illness or a family emergency) to take time off without penalty. If you don't show up, don't do your work, don't finish on time, or take too many inappropriate days off, you're going to be in trouble. I see no reason why it shouldn't be the same for college classes since, in a way, going to class and doing homework is the college student's job. Not partying all night, not hooking up with every cute person they see, not skipping class to watch the Super Bowl. Like the other poster mentioned, college teaches more than just the content of a course. I lost track of the number of students I had who seemed to think the rules I laid out at the beginning of each semester applied to all of their classmates, but not to them, and were absolutely shocked when I held them to those rules as well. Many college students are already familiar with the world of work and jobs, but many aren't, and for them the lessons of required attendance in class could be very valuable.<br>  <br>  Also, any student or professor can probably tell you horror stories about the scramble that happens in the first week or two of the semester, when classes are full and people are trying to move from one class to another. It gets especially confusing and complicated in huge classes with hundreds of students. Frankly, if you're going to make the commitment to stay enrolled in a class (and thus keep a seat that could otherwise go to one of the students trying to get in), I expect to see you actually show up. You took the spot, so use it. Maybe not the most compelling argument, but it was always a pet peeve of mine when students would cling to their spots for the first few weeks and then disappear for everything but tests for the rest of the semester.|`|eFQXl7uyaa	Part of FA may be student loans, part may be public aid. I agree with attendance policies for several reasons. If you are not willing to show up, how serious of a student are you? College is a privilege not a right. If you are not willing to make the effort don't we have a responsibility to not let you run up high student loans just to party on a FA tab and then complain later that "you didn't learn anything". Some of that money may be coming from public assistance which is my money and your money. If you attend a state school, that is funded by tax dollars to help improve our future. Why should I feel sorry for a student who gets kicked out of school for refusing to simply show up while spending my money? All money invested in higher education is just that; An investment in a person - if that person is unwilling to simply show up for their part of that investment would you put more money into it? There has to be a return or responsibility.<br>  <br>  If they are unwilling to show up we all have a responsibility to get them out because they don't deserve to be there and we can't let them continue to pay for something that they have no chance of completing.<br>  <br>  The "veto" is just a power play. It's up to academic affairs - here is a little known power play that students have... (I'm fricken evil)... schools want money and if you withdraw or drop they don't get that. If you are going to miss school call AF ahead of time and ask how to cancel your tuition payment because you are going to miss your 3rd day and the prof will be stopping your FA - see if that moves a different policy.|`|eA7exaYSaa	I think university-wide attendance policies are unnecessary. Some of my professors have a class attendance policy (he randomly calls people from the roster so you have to be there to answer his question, otherwise you lose points). The majority of classes don't have an attendance policy. This is mostly because there are over 100 people in most of my classes, so it's simply not feasible to try and take attendance for a class that has that many people. If you're not there, then you're not learning the material and that sucks for you. I go to class because I am not paying almost 50K a year to not learn anything. Students shouldn't have to be "pushed" to go to class - that was high school. College students do not need any coddling or hand holding. A university-wide attendance policy is just that: a way to hold the students' hands through college. In the real world if you don't attend things that you should then you will be fired. In college if you don't go to class then you won't learn.|`|AA10415600	I think no.  It should be up to the student to make the effort to go to class.  I'm sorry, but the student is 18 or older, supposedly an adult, and it is they, and no one else, who is taking on the responsibility of going to school and paying that money back when they are done.  And I'm sorry, but only two absences is ridiculous.  In college I had chicken pox.  Guess what?  Chicken pox lasts a lot longer than just two days.  What am I supposed to do then, infect other students with it?  I hope you mean unexcused absences.  But back to my point, it's just like a job.  It is my responsibility to show up when I'm supposed to and do the necessary work.  If I just decided to not go back, I would be fired.  That is the consequence that I would to suffer.  If I don't go to class and don't do the work, I'll get failing grades and then get booted out of school because of those actions.  I'm not 13 anymore. I don't need someone to watch my back to make sure I am doing what I am supposed to be doing.  That's what adulthood is all about.
xeVfE97Caa	You just gave away your whole first paragraph in one sentence. The thesis is very good, but too informative.The thesis is supposed to catch you attention. I would shorten it to: "While Psychologists and Psychiatrists share many common roots in ancient history, there are several profound differences between the two often confused professions."<br>  <br>  Your fist paragraph will introduce the thesis as the first sentence and then supporting facts or ideas as seperate sentences. It just seems like a run-on sentence. Other than that it is very in-depth and to the point.
xJoMSkI5aa	From Shmoop/Quotes/To Kill A  Mockingbird<br>  <br>  I was not so sure, but Jem told me I  ... was being a girl, that girls always imagined things, that's why other people hated them so, and if I started behaving like one I couldjust go off and find some to play with. (4.119)     <br>  <br>  Thought: Scout believes from an early age that girl things are bad and boy things are good, and that she can avoid the badness of girls by not acting one.
qPZPduLXaa	It depends where you want the focus to be. Your sentences will take a form like:<br>  <br>  There is an overlap between A and B.<br>  A overlaps with B.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't use "overlap from" and "overlap to".
9z5YJKqLaa	wish you would have done better, huh?|`|3TQCwtxJaa	I remember my friend getting academically dismissed back when I was in college. A few years later, he was actually able to get back into the same school he was dismissed from. I am sure it is not impossible. You may consider meeting with an admission counselor from the school you are wanting to attend. Maybe explaining your situation to them face to face, they may give you a chance.<br>  <br>  Out of curiosity, have you tried any of those online colleges like University of Phoenix?|`|6ZKdO0Iqaa	I would apply anyway and write a compelling statement regarding what you've learned about yourself from that dismissal and how it's helped you to become successful.<br>  <br>  I was dismissed not from a University but from a program within the University and I took up another major. I still had to explain that dismisssal to the law schools I applied to and I got in to a few of them, WITH academic scholarships. So don't give up.  Unfortunately, you may still have to pay the piper a litttle by settling for a school with lesser standards than you'd like (a state school instead of NYU or Colgate or Vassar) but you can still get a degree and it will still be worth something. Good luck.
nN4ldjcBaa	You can...I thought I couldn't either. Many schools accept you with a 2.0. You just need to do research, and use a god damn period in your sentences once in a while...|`|3TQCwtxJaa	Sure you can. I mean, don't expect to get into Yale but there are a lot of good state universities that will accept you with as low as a 2.0 GPA. Test scores matter too so if you can try to study really hard for the SAT or ACT and do well on that, sometimes they will overlook your GPA. A "B" average is nothing to be ashamed of. I know a lot of people who got into the school I went to who had even lower GPA's. <br>  A few other things to consider:<br>  - With a year and a half left to go, look into dual enrollment with your local community college. Showing a 4 year college that you already have some college credit is a big boost.<br>  - Work with your school counselor. They should be able to give better specifics based on 4 years colleges in your area (if you are planning on staying close to home)<br>  - If the school you are applying to requires an admission essay, write one based on how your father's passing impacted you and what you learned from it. If it's written well, not only does it show your intelligence but it also explains what you have been through and why your grades are a little lower than you would like them to be.<br>  <br>  The one concern you should focus on is financial aid and scholarships (if you need any). Scholarships will sometimes be very picky when it comes to your GPA.<br>  <br>  Go to your local bookstore or library. I think it's the Princeton Review that puts out a book each year called "Profiles of American Colleges". You will find every school you can think of in there, along with their admission requirements and how to contact the school and apply. <br>  <br>  Relax, there are plenty of opportunities left for you. You should be fine. Good luck to you!!|`|1FYagJIyaa	donot think that study of colleges is hard always think positive make the study easy .......................................|`|aomx1zBeaa	You can go to a 2 year college and then transfer to a 4 year school. I went to a county college(although one of the best) for 2 semesters in NJ and now im at USC living one of the best college life a school can provide. <br>   How you perform in a County College will serve as a second chance and if you do good for example. if you have a 3.9 GPA at Middlesex county College, there is a program that guarantees you admission in to NYU and I am not sure how your college knowledge is, but NYU=great college experience+ alot of money when you graduate
Tpk94OVbaa	That's perfectly fine.  It's great that you are taking the initiative for others that aren't willing to open up when they in fact do need help or support in studying.  At my university, most courses use an online system that allows students to log in and be able to see the names of all the individual students that are currently online at that time and they can actually message each other through the system.  Believe me, you're not the only one.|`|A5ZQmmW1aa	It won't be weird if you phrase it right.  Say you want to start a study group and emphasise that you are doing it because it will make the workload easier for everyone, people can help each other etc.  Start by asking "is anyone interesting in starting a study group for biology?" for example - just keep it casual.   If your friends think it's weird, tell them that it's a secret ruse to meet guys/girls!!|`|A0wT5sfmaa	It's fine.|`|3TQCwtxJaa	I think it's a great idea. That's one of the best ways to study in my opinion because you are getting input from other minds. Don't worry about being the only one. If people are replying and joining your groups, then they are more than likely thankful you made the move.

See link below.  Either word would be appropriate to use as a title for your investigation.  <br>  <br>  A questionnaire is a research instrument consisting of a series of questions and other prompts for the purpose of gathering information from respondents. Although they are often designed for statistical analysis of the responses, this is not always the case. The questionnaire was invented by Sir Francis Galton.<br>  <br>  Questionnaires have advantages over some other types of surveys in that they are cheap, do not require as much effort from the questioner as verbal or telephone surveys, and often have standardized answers that make it simple to compile data. However, such standardized answers may frustrate users. Questionnaires are also sharply limited by the fact that respondents must be able to read the questions and respond to them. Thus, for some demographic groups conducting a survey by questionnaire may not be practical.<br>  <br>  As a type of survey, questionnaires also have many of the same problems relating to question construction and wording that exist in other types of opinion polls.<br>  <br>  Show the responses as a percentage in a bar graph or pie chart.  As an example, if you poll 100 students and 17 people pick choice "A", then 17% of the students picked that choice.  <br>  <br>  Good luck with your investigation.

Rutherford aimed a beam of positively charged particles at a thin sheet of gold foil, and observed that most of the particles passed through the foil undisturbed, but some were deflected strongly. Thus, he inferred that an atom's positive charge must be clustered in a tiny region in its center, aka the nucleus. He also found out that the nucleus contained all of the atom's mass because scientiss already knew about electrons and knew that they had no mass. I hope this helps! Good Luck!!!!!
y02PZj22aa	Handguns should NOT be prohibited for the following reasons:<br>  <br>  1.  The second amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees the citizenry the right to keep and bear arms (in order to be able to organize under competent authority and defend themselves against threat--such as looters after a natural disaster).  <br>  2.  Handguns--particularly concealed handguns--produce much less of a threat to the general population than do long guns (rifles and shotguns).  Consider:  If you were in a movie theater auditorium to see Slumdog Millionaire and 15 men and women came in with rifles and shotguns, how would you react?  If 15 men and women came into the theater with handguns in their pockets or purses, how would you react?  Fact:  Off-duty police officers are required to be armed while in their jurisdiction, even when they are eating in restaurants, viewing movies, or visiting friends in the hospital.  In all likelihood, you will never see their armaments, because they are concealed in a pocket or purse.<br>  3.  Ownership of handguns is a known deterrent to crime.  Criminals are much more likely to enact crimes in areas where ownership of handguns is illegal.  Murder rates apparently are lower in places where handgun ownership is legal, according to the lobbying group, Gun Owners of America (<a href="http://gunowners.org/op0746.htm)." rel="nofollow">http://gunowners.org/op0746.htm).</a>  Daniel D. Polsby is a researcher and author whose work supports this claim.<br>  4.  There is a saying, "When guns are illegal, only criminals will have guns."  Currently, gun ownership is controlled in most places by the requirement that a person who wants to buy a gun undergo a background check and be issued a permit by competent authority.  Most people are willing to undergo the inconvenience in order to keep handguns out of the "wrong" hands.  However, gun manufacture is not difficult for a machinist with the appropriate tools.  In fact, a hand-machined handgun manufactured by criminals for sale to criminals in an undisclosed location is likely to be the result of widespread handgun bans.<br>  5.  Most handguns that are actually fired are used in sporting competitions, not in violent situations.|`|kKMc9UEJaa	Its not an issue of "should" its that they cant be prohibited unless but a landslide of both house and senate voting agains the 2nd ammendment.

Imagine congress if everyone agreed. Would there ever be true progress in our society if everyone always agreed? The point of a persuasive paper is not to show how mad we are. The argument itself makes us take a closer look at our own and others' ideas more carefully. Writing a persuasive paper helps us to look at evidence, state ideas more clearly, to consider the claims of the opposition fairly, and to justify our own position<br>  What is the goal of your paper? <br>  Spend some time thinking about the topic for your persuasive paper. A persuasive paper works best when there is a disagreement of some sort; a wrong that needs "righting". If there is no disagreement, then there is no point to writing the argument!<br>  Create a  situation statement : <br>  Purpose: I want to argue in favor of <br>  What do I hope to accomplish? Why is it important? What benefits would be realized? What problems would be eliminated? What questions would be answered? How would other people be affected? What obstacles must be overcome?) <br>  About you:Why do you want to argue in favor of ? What makes your opinion important? How would the decision affect you? <br>  About your reader: I need to convince .<br>  (Who is the person that has the power to change the situation? Why would they not want to listen to your idea?) <br>  Just writing a situation statement helps you focus on your writing. <br>  Here are some ideas to start with: <br>  I want to argue for better lunches at school <br>  I want to argue for longer recess. <br>  I want to argue for less homework. <br>  I want to argue to sit wherever I want in class. <br>  I think we should be able to wear hats to school. <br>  <br>  Lesson One/Part Two: <br>      <br>  You have to convince your opposition! <br>    <br>  In order to write an effective persuasive paper, you must anticipate and overcome objections that the opposition might raise. In thinking about your opposition, ask yourself questions like the following: <br>    <br>  What will they say against my idea? <br>  How can I defend my idea against their arguments? <br>  Are there any of my points that they can easily attack? <br>  Can I see any weak links in the opposition's thinking? <br>  Making a Pro/Con chart will help you identify areas that you can address in your paper. Here is a sample one for "I think the school should serve better lunches" <br>    <br>    <br>      For (Pro)    Against (Con)<br>  <br>  Students will eat all of their lunches instead of throwing them away. Lunches would cost more money.<br>  Students learn better when they aren't hungry. If more people bought lunches, more people would need to be hired.<br>  Students will want to come to school for the good lunches. Students only want junk food.<br>  <br>  <br>   Winter Thea Bear      !

I dont want to go against your parents or anything, but love is love! if you truly want to get with him, and you know before hand, that he is a great guy and not a jerk, and would take good care of you, then i would consider maybe hanging out with him alot, or maybe even getting together with him. Fifteen is the age when you start to develop feelings for eachother and its hard to control. But also, fifteen is still a young age and if you are dating someone, its best to not take things too fast. Taking itslow, and easy is best bc you're still a kid|`|1c3c5ea67770069db9c07ef2774b0a7baa	Date him secretly? Just tell your parents he's a "good friend". Thats what I did for a few years. Parents usually let their kids date by 16 but some kids have to wait until 18. You can't help how you feel with something like this, I know where you're coming from and it's easier to have your parents yell at you then it is to deal with a broken heart. Just stay abstinent and don't get pregnant:)|`|FpUaFcQyaa	ummm... just do it. if your parents tell you you cannot date yet, you shouldnt let that keep you down. if you really have feelings for him, then dont let them stand n your way.|`|jMOmdhXhaa	ok first off this is the most romantic and cutest question ever.<br>  second...You should I guess just be friends for now.

Just don't call it a date and hang out a lot.  It will probably feel like a date even though it's "not".  Honor your parents choices and just wait some time.  You'll get through this      :-)|`|hq9rM7Eqaa	if you both realy like each other<br>  and he is willing 2 wait<br>  and if it is both your destinys<br>  then he will still be there when u r allowed 2 date.<br>  there r lots of high school sweethearts out there, adults, married, they all just hat to wait.<br>  it is possible|`|ZCnHUfyxaa	i think you should go against your parents. <br>  you should only if you the feelings for him are strong enough. <br>  in my opinion you should also get your parents to get to know him. <br>  i wish you the best. :)|`|SqNoMz7vaa	You are NOT ALLOWED to date...?

0WASp0bHaa	I think you do miss a lot by not starting at a four year college....<br>  But many students are not ready to go away to school and CC is a good start for them. Better that then flunking out because you weren't ready for it. <br>  CC is much cheaper on tuition. This is a great way to lower the cost of college. I went 2 years to a CC. I got involved. I was in theater and on the college radio. I hung out with students from other organizations there, talk to my professors, just got to know people in general. We had a great campus with lots of entertainment for the students. YOu can go to a CC and just go to class and back to your car and drive home. It is what you make of it.|`|AA11942204	drip makes some valid points but I'd like to add this. If you are serious about your education then you really want to go to a university. The intellectual life of the university, especially outside of the classroom, is much richer. The people who are teaching you are, on average, much more qualified. And, if you want to go on past your undergraduate degree, the longer and better your professors have known you the better letters of recommendation they can write. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|7o3DMzXQaa	you can make the best of both situations
Gburbcuiaa	Umm no.because you probably have a no cheating policy. Don't let them copy again. You might be able to get away with "we did our homework together." Lying is not right but it isn't worth getting kicked out of school for. Don't do it again.|`|7LOpJW3zaa	Yeah I would, just tell them the truth cause you'll eventually have to think of more lies to cover up the original lie and trust me you'll get caught out.<br>  But yeah just tell the teacher that you let your friend copy you even though you know they shouldn't just promise never to do it again.<br>  Grovel :)<br>  Good luck|`|pd7WGdl6aa	You should because it's the right thing to do, but remember that your friend will have to take an even bigger fall since he copied your work AND lied. Be prepared to get in trouble for letting someone copy your work.<br>  <br>  However, I'm sure you will stop feeling guilty after you tell the truth. If you guys want to get in less trouble, say that you worked on it together; this gives you the lousy end of the deal though (for allowing your friend to take credit for your work) but atleast both of you won't get in trouble for plagiarizing.<br>  <br>  Depends on what you feel is right/what your priorities are/how important the assignment was.|`|AA11735935	Yes.  You're going to be busted anyway because the two papers are the same.  If you say your friend let you copy, then you get busted, and he may get busted for letting you copy.<br>  <br>  Take the responsibility for letting him copy.  Do not take the responsibility for something you did not do.|`|b7Z3OSRwaa	yes|`|SsCMH480aa	you might as well come clean cuz shes gonna find out and when u she does u will be a big sh*t|`|utObT8QAaa	Well it matter, how tough is your teacher, you could tell her that your friend copied the answer without your knowledge, or that you were pressured into it. It your teacher is a hard cookie, I wouldn't say anything. But if your friend keeps trying to copy, I would tell him to back off, or maybe change the way the words are written.|`|c17e266e621f22dbab89752c8868e888aa	Yeah i think you should tell because <br>  if he finds out that you did cheat you could get in more trouble then you would if you told him the truth<br>  teacher respect you more if you are honest|`|c9cbbae9664e8ae4184f1b8f28b0acfdaa	No, just explain to your friend what an idiot he is, and have him change his work & admit.

46492533ddbb2d578f91de5478f1e7f3aa	If the remainder of the class has not read Bartleby, you may want to do a brief lecture to outline the story's plot.  If your classmates have read it, any lecture you do should deal with something beyond the mere text of the story, which is to say that it should involve your analysis of it.<br>  <br>  Bartleby is an excellent example of nonconformity, but the story definitely demonstrates the dangers of failing to fall in line with the structure of society.  Clearly, Bartleby quickly earns his employer's respect, serving as a productive employee who generates quality work-product.  When Bartleby starts behaving in an unconventional manner, every chance is given to him to follow the rules and return to productive life.  In the end, Bartleby's refusal to do this - communicated with the simple "I would prefer not to" - leads to his imprisonment and death.  His nonconformity leads to his demise.<br>  <br>  I think most people in society today consider being unconventional a good thing, but how much departure of convention is okay, and when is it necessary to stick to the structure society provides?  It strikes me that this would be an interesting topic for discussion.<br>  <br>  Just a thought.|`|AA11735935	This may be interesting:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.826la.org/events/779/bartleby-the-scrivener-office-space-project-at-venice-high" rel="nofollow">http://www.826la.org/events/779/bartleby...</a>

You really only need red, yellow, and blue...because then you can place those colors on top of each other and make the secondary colors.  Preschool kids do enjoy looking through different colors.<br>  <br>  Encourage her to press darkly on white paper with crayons...Crayola works best but the others will work okay.  Then have her paint over with black watercolor or diluted paint.  This is an open-ended art project but when it's dry you can talk about the colors she used...even while she is making it you can talk about the colors she used.  When it's dry you can have her choose a color in her art work, tell you what it is and then find something else in the room that is the same color.<br>  <br>  This age loves and needs many scissor opportunities.  Provide different solid colored scrap paper for her to cut into pieces.  Then on individual construction paper pieces, do a simple color collage....or write her letters in her name lightly (one per page) and glue one color paper cutttings to the line.  Staple together to make a color collage book or a color name book.<br>  <br>  Put colored tissue paper inside of 2 liter bottles.  Roll the ball and knock them down.  As she puts them back up have her tell you the name of each color.<br>  <br>  Provide a solid color construction paper in each color you want to review.  Go through an old magazine and cut out corresponding colored pictures and glue to the background.  Can use as a display in her bedroom or make into a book.<br>  <br>  Give her an icecube tray and help her fill up 3 slots with a bit of water (better to do it on opposite ends of the tray).  Then have her help you put in red, blue, and yellow food coloring in each individual slot.  Show her how to use an eye dropper to get some of each color and mix it into the other compartments.  You can give her a coffee filter and let her drop it onto the coffee filter.  When dry, bunch in center and twist a pipecleaner around to make a butterfly.  Even if she mixes all brown, the colors will seperate on the coffee filter (especially if you make the water colors bold to begin with).<br>  <br>  At the dollar store they have many colors of crepe paper.  Cut out the center of a paper plate and have her staple on the crepe paper color strips (in any size...let her cut the strips) onto the rim of the paper plate.  Talk about the colors as she staples them on.  Then turn on some music and move! (Or go outside if it's nice enough).  You can extend it by having her move for a little while and then "freeze" and choose a strip, tell you what it is and find something in the room that is that color.<br>  <br>  Color bingo, dominoes, concentration games...you can make them or I'm sure you can find some free printables on the internet.<br>  <br>  Remember the many many color books that are available at the local library!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|f6v64lmMaa	Hi there<br>  Learning colours can be great fun and there are many things you could do. Make a little lotto game with shapes which are different colours. Draw a triangle, circle, square, oval, diamond, rectangle (make two of each) colour them all in different colours making sure that the each shape is the same colour for example the triangles are red the circles are blue the squares are green the ovals are yellow and the diamonds are pink and the rectangle is grey. Put one of all the shapes on a piece of card and laminate it and then do the same again with the remaining and cut them out so she can match the colours. You could add more shapes of different sizes and may a memory game in the same way. Hope this helps Good luck with the babysitting.|`|30e7b808304ee867ce23c80d9216a4c6aa	The best way is repetition. Gather a few items of the same colour and go through them, getting little 'un to repeat. Then put in a different coloured item, but call it by the same colour. Sort of:<br>  <br>  Red ball (Red ball)<br>  Red car (red car)<br>  Red book (red book)<br>  Red shoe (red shoe?) Noooooooooooo.... THAT's not a red shoe. It's a BLUE shoe. (blue shoe)<br>  <br>  Just keep doing the same thing with different objects and different groups of colour over and over and over and over .....again. Sounds daft, but it works. Make it into a game and enjoy yourselves. Remember they only have limited concentration, so don't expect too much at first and if they resist, just back off for a while. Bring the colour into whatever they're doing. If they're playing with toys, talk continually about what they're playing with and what colour it is. For a car, what colour doors? what colour wheels? etc. Just bring colour into everything you're doing together. Eating/drinking - what colour juice? what colour cup?<br>  <br>  At that age, they have brains like sponges. They literally soak up everything you tell them. They are so eager to learn it's exciting to watch them, especially when you hear them talking about something YOU've taught them. Teaching young children has to be the most important thing us adults ever do in our lives! And by far the most rewarding.<br>  <br>  Enjoy xx|`|Y9X4wFLDaa	I think the best way to teach would be to always associate the colors with things that she recognizes around the house. <br>  <br>  Like clouds are white<br>  The sky is blue<br>  The grass is green<br>  <br>  Things like that.....and always do this repetitiously this is how children learn.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|qeLikL8Haa	show and tell

KDqzj3isaa	here in NZ thats called a midwife, here thats who looks after you during your pregnancy and delivers your baby and looks after you and baby for 6 weeks after. the training takes 3 years and then you take on as many woman as you like, im not sure what its like over there but here doctors only deliver babies if you have a diffucult pregnancy.<br>  i saw my midwife once a month for 6 months then once a week from there on, she worked for herself and used the hospital services to deliver thats what most of them do. not sure about california sorry but i found this site about the college of midwifes there<br>  <br>  California College of Midwives <br>  State Chapter ~ American College of Community Midwives<br>  Section One <br>  STANDARDS OF PRACTICE<br>  (Note ~ 1/3/05: proposed additions below in blue type)<br>  e Professional Midwives offer primary care to healthy women and their normal unborn and newborn babies throughout normal pregnancy, labor, birth, postpartum, the neonatal and interconceptional periods. A statement of purpose, overview, definition of terms, professional principles, policies relative to professional relationships, protocols for special circumstances and minimum practice requirements for areas of clinical practice are contained in sections 1 & 2. [Family planning and well-woman gynecology are addressed in section 3.] Subsequent sections include administrative obligations, practice guidelines, clarifying commentaries, samples of informed consent documents and other instructional and educational materials. Together these sources as published by California College of Midwives / ACCM comprise the CCM Standard of Care.   However, the following standard of care document is not meant to replace the clinical judgment of the licensed midwife. (f^O^)
cYfjfCb9aa	First it's useful to get rid of the decimals in the problem, so let's begin by multiplying both equations by 100, effectively moving the decimal point two places to the right for each number.  Thus we have:<br>  5x + 25y = 4400<br>  15x + 5y = 4800<br>  <br>  Notice we also multiplied the numbers on the right by 100.  Also, there are smaller numbers that work (20 in this case) to get rid of the decimals, but it's usually easiest to simply multiply by 100 in this case since each decimal is measured in the hundredths.<br>  <br>  Now to use the elimination method to solve:  The goal is to multiply one (or both) equations by a constant so that when added together, one of the two variables cancels out.  In this case, notice we have a 5x in the first equation and a 15x in the second equation.  If we multiply 5x by -3, then we'll have a -15x.  When this is then added to the 15x below it, they will cancel out.  Thus, let's multiply each term of the first equation by -3:<br>  <br>  -15x - 75y = - 13200<br>  15x + 5y = 4800<br>  <br>  Now, we add each item together vertically, combining the x's, y's, and constants.  This yields:<br>  -70y = - 8400<br>  <br>  Again, our goal was to eliminate the x variable from the system.  Now we can just divide to solve for y.  Then:<br>  y = 120<br>  <br>  Finally, we plug this back into any of our equations to find x.  If we take 5x +25y = 4400 and plug in y = 120, we get:<br>  5x + 25(120) = 4400<br>  5x + 3000 = 4400<br>  5x = 1400<br>  x = 280<br>  <br>  So from there, our ordered pair solution is: ( 280 , 120 )

Their primary error was dividing the superior Japanese fleet- 120 plus vessels. The US had only 76 available.The US forces set up an ambush for the Japanese who lost four carriers, a heavy cruiser, 3 destroyers, some 275 planes, at least 4,800 men, and suffered heavy damage among the remaining vessels of their fleet. American losses included one carrier, a destroyer, about 150 planes, and 307 men. After this the two navies were on equal footing and Japan began to lose .<br>  The Battle of Midway, the most decisive naval battle of World War II demonstrated that bombers from aircraft carriers could defeat a superior surface force. This victory by the United States over Japan in June 1942 ended the Japanese advance in the Pacific Ocean.|`|90ba64c03d7d00439e287a17ba561a39aa	try this|`|35ccc8ce58bda98ad049f1093b5a126aaa	Us v Japanese carrier aircraft.

It is good to be in a public high school because you will see people from all walks of life, while in a private school, you are exposed to people who are more like yourself.  Being in a public school really does prepare you for the real world.  However, in a private school, the classes are much smaller so you get more one-on-one attention from your teacher.  So this would certainly help more with your education.|`|wIdpZtrlaa	The students in public school are so annoying and obnoxious.

QYXFai9Kaa	Hi<br>  <br>  Studying and settling in USA are two different concepts. You should focus ONLY on the focus and keep your "settling" desire concealed at least for the time being. Other wise they may not even allow you entry as a student - US visa is not easy.<br>  <br>  You will need very high score in TOEFL AND GRE.<br>  <br>  Besides, you should be an achiever in your B.Sc. degree.<br>  <br>  You may need very good letters of recommendations from your teachers.<br>  <br>  Lastly, you may need to develop essay writing and SoP writing.<br>  <br>  The admissions decisions are taken on the basis of all the said items collectively. You should determine to excel and compete for a good scholarship amount for your Masters degree.<br>  <br>  After degree, the US government permits science/math students to stay for 29 months on OPT visa; and thereafter, if you get a regular job, you may consider settling down if you get green card. there may be other options which you will find in due course.

AA11595097	Imagine a hypodermic syringe attached to a piece of glass tubing. The syringe is full of water. If you push the plunger (a force) the water flows through the tube. The push represents voltage and the speed of water going through the tube is the current (amps). Now imagine you put something into the tube to partly block it. You must push harder (more volts) to make the same speed of flow of water. The tube has more resistance (resistance only means trying to stop something). Resistance is measured in Ohms after a Danish (not German) physicist.<br>  Push (volts) = Speed of water flow (amps) x resistance (Ohms)<br>  If you have 2 volts and the current is 1 amp the restance must be 2 ohms.|`|46492533ddbb2d578f91de5478f1e7f3aa	It's been a long time, but I recall the old equation V=IR.  Voltage is the product of current and resistance.  Resistance is a material's capacity to carry current.  Current is the flow of electricity.  Voltage is the power generated by the flow of electricity (current) through a given medium (or resistor, if you will).<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|duIpmozQaa	It's called Ohms law invented by a German schoolteacher George Ohm Look here for more detail:-<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm%27s_law" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm%27s_law</a>|`|z6ZNrN2paa	Voltage (V) is like the pressure that drives the current of electrons through a wire. Current (I) is the flow of electrons, resistance (R) self-explanatory. They are linked together by Ohm's Law, V = I R|`|vZMN82U8aa	think of voltage as water, and resistance as the ability of the pipe to carry the water... <br>  <br>  wire has an optimum resistance, it can ONLY carry X much current, at X plus one, it begins to heat up, until it fails...

Regardless of what your opinion is, sex before marriage is still a sin.<br>  <br>  Your human accomplishments mean absolutely nothing in light of a severely deficient morality.|`|Xtqq71KGaa	it's wrong, but i agree, boys aren't likely to be damaged.  more like emboldened.|`|2646a4e9d6d4e936660d70ff922397f3aa	You didn't learn how to "love" a woman; I'll bet there was no love involved at all.  And had I found out, as a young woman, that my boyfriend had learned his sexual technique by having sex with a middle-aged teacher, I would have been completely creeped out by it.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying you would be damaged psychologically, but I'll bet others in your class were harmed by it.  When I was in college, there was a professor who got sexually involved with his students, and it was their boyfriends who felt that they had been severely disadvantaged, since the teacher spent his time flirting with their girlfriends rather than paying attention to his teaching, and gave them unfair advantages (or at least they felt that way) when it came to grades that they themselves could never duplicate.<br>  <br>  I also know of boys who have been badly damaged by these things, so any teacher risking that with her students is being incredibly irresponsible.  Again, you were lucky.  Nothing terrible came of it.  But the fallout of what this teacher did could have damaged you and everyone else in the class, so what she did was absolutely wrong.|`|QVupDcqoaa	I'm sorry but I do not agree with you.You may not have been affected or damaged by this but the fact of the matter is it's wrong. You send your children to school and only hope that they are in good hands. No teacher should ever feel the need to have anything but a professional relationship wiith a student. It does not what the age or the sex of the teacher is. He/she knows it is wrong and irresponsible.|`|735KiHn2aa	The question isn't if you are "damaged" as you put it. Your 39 year old teacher committed a FELONY sex crime and should have been arrested. Any teacher who has even 1 ounce of desire to molest a child- and that is exactly what she did to you- is disturbed and should never be around children.|`|q6dryZfgaa	a girl is different because most of the time its rape, and they dont wont it. and if they do then it will come to bother them as time goes on because they think they did something wrong.|`|c696e17a151a058e36aceeab75aea544aa	I don't think it's about damaging as much as it is about parental trust. When you send your kids to school you expect the teacher to have a better moral compass than to sleep with YOUR CHILD!! and i'm sorry...but 16 IS still a child. I agree there is a difference between boys and girls....but it's not positive in anyway and many times could lead the boy to feel that it's acceptable to be 39 and sleep with a 16 yr old girl. You may not have been damaged per say, but you have been apparently influenced enough by it to feel that sex between a 16yr old and 39yr old is ok. Remeber, one case, does not in any way at all show anything close to substantial proof of anything.|`|mYhuGonfaa	I don't agree with you. Maybe in your case you didn't have any psychological after-effects, but is it fair for the next student that has an affair with this teacher? What if the next boy isn't as strong as you were, isn't as mature and is really hurt or scarred by this? What if the teacher starts sleeping with much younger boys? Are you disregarding the fact that its ILLEGAL for a 39 year old to sleep with a 16 year old? It doesn't matter if she was a teacher or a homeless woman, it is still against the law and she should have been brought up on charges and lose her teaching certification. This was extremely unprofessional and immature of her to do. And it shows that you haven't grown up much since the incident if you are now a father and your protective instincts haven't turned on to realize that this is wrong. So maybe you weren't left as "undamaged" as you think?|`|WyCmQBuvaa	So you are condoning your 39 yr old teacher's behavior?<br>  <br>  <br>  You wouldn't mind if your 16 yr old son had an affair with his teacher?
0yZrkzizaa	It's much easier to submit the application online. The school will receive it sooner, and you don't have to worry about writing neatly and such. Also, www.commonapp.org allows you to easily submit applications to hundreds of universities, and saves you time since you won't have to repeatedly fill out personal information!|`|zh9Jjddvaa	I think you should apply on line if that facility is available - it shows a more 21st century approach. You should get a notification of receipt email back too which you won't get via snail mail. Only very traditional, often private establishments don't always offer this facility they like to see handwriting!|`|H7Fuij30aa	Most colleges like online applications since they can directly copy the information from your application into the computers/the college's records.

The context will help you figure it out for sure.<br>  <br>  W/E can also mean "week ending."  If it's followed by a date, that probably is what it means.  However, that's a pretty formal and technical usage - you generally see it used by agencies or companies who emphasise things based on weeks.  For instance, the unemployment agency might sent a statement referring to "Benefits for W/E Feb. 21," meaning the 7-day week (Sunday through Saturday) ending on Feb. 21.  But unless the note itself was about something like that, "W/E" most likely does not stand for "week ending."<br>  <br>  "Whatever" and "weekend" are the two best guesses.

jb4YWxvqaa	Ok I am going to give it a shot. I assume you know all about being an actuary. Or else, you would need to consider visiting www.soa.org or related website to learn more about it.<br>  <br>  I was doing Actuarial and Information Systems double major when I was in undergraduate.<br>  <br>  I am good at Math but to be an actuary, it takes me more than just being good at it. I need to practice the math questions like a mad dog.<br>  <br>  To be an actuary, you don't need to be in actuarial major. You can purchase study materials from actuarial website and study for the respective exam on your own. Society of Actuaries (soa.org) can be a good place to start. Furthermore, being in actuarial major doesn't exempt you from any professional papers unless you are doing it at a graduate level.<br>  <br>  Although I was in actuarial major, I would need to study the actuarial materials I purchased online from scratch. Therefore, being in actuarial major contributed almost nothing to my professional exams.<br>  <br>  However, I would suggest that you take Calculus 2 & 3 and Statistic 1 as electives so that you have a strong mathematical foundation prior to even taking your 1st professional paper.<br>  <br>  All in all, I would suggest that it's best for you to stick to your accounting major (since it's easy) and spend the rest of your time focusing on professional papers. On the average, employers would employ you as an actuarial analyst if you have passed at least 1 paper. Other depends on your interview skills. Ultimately, you are not only an actuary, but also an accountant. If you are discipline enough, 1 summer break may earn you 1 paper.<br>  <br>  The only benefit for you if you were to switch your major to actuarial major is that:<br>  <br>  1) You'll have peer pressure, hence you won't slack in taking exams<br>  2) You would have a least know the material by taking actuarial courses (but you need to study from scratch again when taking it)<br>  3) You'll be amongst actuarial minded people.<br>  <br>  If you think you need the above to motivate you, then by all means switch your major.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|ImQPqxEgaa	Accounting isn't about Math. It helps to be mathematically inclined: however, accounting is more about using math in sometimes complex formulas that tend to be based on principals, rules, standards and in some cases laws. Initially it takes is a lot of memorization and practice. To excel it takes an appreciation for ruled-based concepts, structure and the cool way things work out. A mindset with an apprecation for detail, a slim margin for error in a highly competitive, high pressure and fast paced environment may become tedious and tiresome for a person not crazy about the profession to begin with.  I majored in economics in the beginning because I like the applications but discovered I could never be happy or gainfully employed.<br>  <br>  Math = study = practice = work out problems both in theory and application. I'm not sure how it works out otherwise - especially in advanced Mathematics.<br>  <br>  I'd find out more about what being an actuary entails in real life and on a day to day basis rather than what the degree requires. Further, if you do not find any satisfying comments in this category, I'd repost in the Math category. I did that once and received a lot of valuable tips and insight, Good luck.
GU1i931Xaa	Yes, I believe it's wrong if we're talking about cosmetics or unecessary things along those lines.

W1xs3vYBaa	It is not suppose to be, but some IQ test's- such as those administered through multiple choice- can be learned. However, in a genuine IQ test you should always fall within your range. <br>  <br>  A person will never have a single number, because health, mood and so forth play a role in the score. Still, because IQ tests do not use knowledge they should be straight forward enough to have a person fall within a range no matter their mood. <br>  <br>  Therefore, having a balanced meal, adequate sleep, and health are all good ways to max out your range on a genuine IQ test, but you cannot improve past your range.<br>  <br>  If your getting one from a high IQ society that administered faulty ones to make money you can study math tricks, play chess and logic games and score higher. I wouldn't recommend this though- the score isn't your innate capabilities.|`|HyWeOyT4aa	Short answer is no. You can raise your IQ score but not your IQ. Yes, that is what I said lol. You can do things to reach your full potential, but not raise your true IQ.
d0c27cb965d282bda6d18370f8cdd49baa	3G is the third generation of tele standards and technology for mobile networking, superseding 2.5G. It is based on the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) family of standards under the IMT-2000.<br>  <br>  3G networks enable network operators to offer users a wider range of more advanced services while achieving greater network capacity through improved spectral efficiency. Services include wide-area wireless voice telephony, video calls, and broadband wireless data, all in a mobile environment. Additional features also include HSPA data transmission capabilities able to deliver speeds up to 14.4 Mbit/s on the downlink and 5.8 Mbit/s on the uplink.<br>  <br>  Unlike IEEE 802.11 networks, which are commonly called Wi-Fi or WLAN networks, 3G networks are wide-area cellular telephone networks that evolved to incorporate high-speed Internet access and video telephony. IEEE 802.11 networks are short range, high-bandwidth networks primarily developed for data.<br>  <br>  Not just broadband internet can be exploted from multi megabit speeds. Video calling and VOIP. HSDPA (High Speed Data Packet Access) has capabilities of bringing 14.4 Mbit/s downstream, this is faster than most standard lines, and even some in cities in well developed areas. Not to mention capabilities of 5.8Mbit/s uplink that is more than ten times standard ADSL,<br>  <br>  Although 3G was successfully introduced to users across the world, some issues are debated by 3G providers and users:<br>  <br>      * Expensive input fees for the 3G service licenses & agreements<br>      * Numerous differences in the licensing terms<br>      * Large amount of debt currently sustained by many telecommunication companies, which makes it a challenge to build the necessary infrastructure for 3G<br>      * Lack of member state support for financially troubled operators<br>      * Expense of 3G phones<br>      * Lack of buy-in by 2G mobile users for the new 3G wireless services<br>      * Lack of coverage, because it is still a new service<br>      * High prices of 3G mobile services in some countries, including Internet access.<br>  hsj<br>      * Current lack of user need for 3G voice and data services in a hand-held device

Must only use paper, scissors, and tape. The the bridge strength is tested on the middle of the construction, using small weigths (rocks or whatever).<br>  <br>  Divide them into three pairs. One person of each pair writes a note on a post-it and sticks it on the forehead of a person from another pair. The text must be a person, a place or a thing. Then the person having the note on his forehead must ask his teammate questions to guess the secret text on the note. First team to guess, wins. Alternatively you can prepare notes of equal difficulty.|`|FmYkUfIDaa	Hi Jayceeh,<br>  <br>  One ice breaker that I have used to good effect is:<br>  Ask your students to ' Write those words that they would like to have on their gravestone.<br>  <br>  Sample: "I told you I was sick!"

wF3YmF4Naa	Just let the dialog come out of the action instead of using he says.<br>  For instance.<br>  "John looks at the clock in the tower. "We have to go or we'll be late."

Try describing eye contact and gestures between characters to punctuate thoughts and conversation.  This brings the moment in time forward instead of looking backward.|`|SapgcOZXaa	Writing fiction in the present tense is much easier if you write it from a first-person point of view, as if you are a character watching the people and things around you. If you write from a third-person point of view, it's still not terribly hard, but you just have to make sure that when you write it, you have to think about it in terms of it happening now. If you think of it as something that has already happened and you're trying to tell it in present tense, then it's going to automatically sound awkward.<br>  <br>  <br>  For example:<br>  <br>  First person point of view:<br>  <br>  I sit down at the table and place my head in my hands. This is not going to be an easy decision. He puts his hand on mine.<br>  <br>  "What do you think we should do?" he asks softly. I shake my head. <br>  <br>  "I don't know," I say. "I've never been in this situation before."<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Third person point of view:<br>  She sits down at the table and puts her head in her hands, visibly upset. He puts his hand on hers in an attempt at comfort.<br>  <br>  "What do think we should do?" he asks softly. She shakes her head.<br>  <br>  "I don't know," she says. "I've never been in this situation before."<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  With each version you get a different kind of insight and can therefore fill in gaps. With first person, you have direct access to that person's thoughts and feelings and can take them on as your own, making them easier to write. With third person, you can sit back as a neutral character and write things as they appear to you, as if you were writing at the same time you were watching it. Both have their pros and cons, but both can be really effective if done correctly.

AA10176626	TeTe:<br>  <br>  Scholarships are one of several forms of financial assistance for college. Most students do not qualify for scholarships, but rely on the more common option, financial aid.<br>  <br>  I'd like to suggest that you start out with the booklet that I've linked below. This is a publication of the US Department of Education called "Funding Education Beyond High School: The Guide to Federal Student Aid". Federal student aid is far and away the number one source for college funding, and it's the one that is most likely to be available to you - so it would help you a lot to know more about it.<br>  <br>  This booklet explains what types of financial assistance are available, who is eligible, how to apply, and how much you might receive. There is even information in there about the topic that you're interested in - scholarships - so you'll find out about those, too.<br>  <br>  Scholarships are competitions, just like a beauty pageant, or a spelling bee. The scholarship is a prize, and many people would like to be chosen. The scholarship organization offers an application form, and requests certain information, and (usually) thousands of students apply.<br>  <br>  Scholarships may be awarded for different things - some are awarded to recognize really top students, some are awarded for students who scored impressively high scores on the SAT or ACT, some are awarded for athletics or performing arts talents, and some are awarded to recognize the work of students who have demonstrated an admirable commitment to community service.<br>  <br>  You can't "get" a scholarship - you have to be chosen - because you stand out from other candidates.<br>  <br>  Financial aid, on the other hand, is awarded purely on the basis of financial need. The financial aid applications are used to determine your family's ability to pay for your schooling, and you will be offered various forms and amounts of assistance, depending on your unique financial circumstances.<br>  <br>  Do not count on receiving sufficient financial aid to enable you to go to college for free, and do not count on receiving sufficient financial aid to enable you to go to any college that you choose. Financial aid is meant to HELP students gain AN education, and that usually means an education offered at a very reasonable cost. <br>  <br>  Students relying almost entirely (or completely) on financial aid need to consider their lowest cost educational options - especially community colleges and local universities - because that's all financial aid will generally pay for. If you choose a college that costs $8,000 a year to attend, you may see most of those costs paid for with the assistance of financial aid. If you choose a college that costs $30,000 a year to attend, you'll receive that same $8000 in financial aid, and be left with a $22,000 shortfall to figure out on your own.<br>  <br>  If your grades are outstanding, or if you are a talented young athlete - if you have been deeply engaged in community service or you have overcome some significant obstacles in life to achieve solid academic success, then by all means, you should apply for scholarships, which will supplement any financial aid that you receive. Scholarships are what enable students to afford the kinds of schools that they otherwise couldn't dream of affording.<br>  <br>  If you are an average student, your best bet is financial aid - and you will learn all about the financial aid program by reading through the booklet that I've attached. I recommend that you ask your mom or dad to read it, too, because there's extra information in there that will be of interest to them. <br>  <br>  Good luck - I hope this helps.|`|7ae938d47fa5ab107ff81fe42738c6a4aa	You should first apply for Federal Aid by completing the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) at www.fafsa.ed.gov.<br>  <br>  You can look for scholarships at:<br>      * www.aauw.org<br>      * www.bibl.u-szeged.hu/oseas/europe.html<br>      * www.cashe.com<br>      * www.collegeboard.com/highered<br>      * www.CollegeIsPossible.org<br>      * www.collegenet.com<br>      * www.collegeview.com<br>      * www.ecollegebid.com<br>      * www.edupass.org<br>      * www.embark.com<br>      * www.fastweb.com<br>      * www.feea.org<br>      * www.finaid.org<br>      * www.gmsp.org<br>      * www.gocollege.com<br>      * www.hispanicfund.org<br>      * www.IEFA.org<br>      * www.iefc.com<br>      * www.iie.org/fulbright<br>      * www.jackkentcookefoundation.org<br>      * www.macfdn.org<br>      * www.mapping-your-future.org<br>      * www.nafsa.org<br>      * www.nextstudent.com<br>      * www.petersons.com<br>      * www.scholarshiphunter.com<br>      * www.thesalliemaefund.org<br>      * www.usjournal.com<br>      * www.yahoo.com/Education/Financial_Aid<br>      * www.ymf.org/programs/scholarship.php

If a person is particularly qualified for it, as in years of experience or some college education, then they have a program where the company pays for the employees education, the employee does either night classes or online classes working towards an engineering degree, and in order to keep the job the employee has to turn in transcripts to the company so they can see the progress. Once the employee finally earns the degree they officially earn the job title and don't have to pay back a penny of the tuition.<br>  <br>  You should find out if your employer does that.<br>  <br>  Other than that all you can do is take online courses and work towards a degree or just earn a certificate, but if the job requires a degree then a certificate is pointless.|`|VZ21gL81aa	Take a look at Western Governors University.<br>  <br>  BTW, an honorary degree will not help since it is not 'earned'.|`|Y0igrNi8aa	Dear ,<br>  <br>   Few week ago I was searching on this question for my assgnment and found this one very helpful <br>   <a href="http://onlinedegrees.orgfree.com" rel="nofollow">http://onlinedegrees.orgfree.com</a> <br>  <br>   Regards,

zgTsCicNaa	Linguistic devices are ways by which a writer expresses his opinion towards certain situation and way by which he makes audience interested in his topic. <br>  LINGUISTIC DEVICES <br>  <br>  The “Covering Islam” criticizing as it is, high lites the influence of media led by the wealthy and powerful countries and political blocks. The main purpose of this text is accomplished trough language and the way Said represents Islam from his point of view.<br>  <br>  Sadi uses rhetorical questions as a way to reexamine the reliability of perception of Islam:<br>  <br>  “How really useful is ‘Islam’ as a concept of understanding Marocco and Saudi Arabia and Syria and Indonesia?”<br>  <br>  In this case Sadi repeats the world ‘and’ in saying all the Islamic countries and writes Islam as “Islam”- this entire sentence as the rhetorical question refers to politics and how the concept of Islam is ‘understood’ trough politics. <br>  <br>  The different usage of language can make a distinction in understanding and creating a picture based on a text.<br>  <br>  This I mention referring to Bush’s speech after September eleventh which is the one that tends to encourage Americans after the “evil, despicable acts of terror”, as the American president addresses to the American nation.<br>  <br>  Trough simple language, without any scientific or politic words hard to understand, he is getting, first attention, then trust and faith of, not only Americans, but the entire world.<br>  <br>  Since everyone knew that the attacks were committed by Muslim terrorists, he makes people not forget that, be aware of that and see Islam and the east countries only trough this picture without the possibility of being judged for judging anyone since he does not mention who it was. (why would he when the media made it quite obvious??)<br>  <br>  So, his simple language makes people find him as one of them, not a president, but a person who is suffering as equal as they are.<br>  <br>  “Today, our fellow citizens, our way of life, our very freedom came under attack in a series of deliberate and deadly terrorist acts.”<br>  <br>  Trough repeating the word “our” he correlates him self to the nation, makes it more intimate.<br>  <br>  This is differently used in Sadi’s text where it is used in an ironic way:<br>  <br>  “And always it is supposed that the ‘Islam’ being talked about is some real and stable object out there where ‘our’ oil supplies happen to be found.”<br>  <br>  A different thing about Sadi’s language is that is not simple as Bush’s language, it is rather more complicated.<br>  <br>  This can be seen trough the usage of words such as ‘militancy and fatalism’, ‘ecumenism as well as exclusivism’, etc. (all in one sentence)<br>  <br>  The purpose of this might be to show how many of the politicians and “Islam theoreticians” as Sadi names them, use these kinds of words and thereby not saying anything significant or true. <br>  <br>  Bush mentions the victims “ Moms and dads. Friends and neighbors. Thousands of lives were suddenly ended by evil and despicable acts of terror.”<br>  <br>  The main purpose of this is to make a special atmosphere, to touch and reveal people’s emotions.<br>  <br>  By using the image of a bright beacon, he reveals the ‘ real reason ‘ for the attack of the terrorists:<br>  <br>  “America was targeted for attack because we’re the brightest beacon for freedom and opportunity in the world. And no one will keep that light from shining.”<br>  <br>  After getting this emotional atmosphere and the full attention of the nation, the moment of truth comes- the real purpose of the speech.<br>  <br>  He mentions the government and it’s functions in this situation:<br>  <br>  “The functions of our government continue without interruption.”<br>  <br>  Towards the end, a recall to religion by using a psalm and in that way showing the purity of him self as the representative of the Americans, mentioning the victims and making the pain and suffer the nation feels into anger, hate and fear towards those muslim terrorists from those east muslim countries that always seemed so strange.<br>  <br>  At the end the spirit of patriotism is woken up:<br>  <br>  “America has stood down enemies before, and we will do so this time.”<br>  <br>  This might be the sentence that caused Islamofobia, anger, fear and misunderstanding of Islam as a religion since it has been so mixed up with politics and it’s aims.<br>  <br>  Sadi is trying to reveal this to the world and explain them that the perception of Islam that they have is based upon nothing- theories brought up by not knowing the Muslim religion and people:<br>  <br>  “By using the skills of a good critical reader to disentangle sense from nonsense, by asking the right questions and expecting pertinent answers, anyone can learn about either “Islam” or the world of Islam and about the men, women and cultures that live within it, speak its languages , breathe its air, produce its histories and societies.”<br>  <br>  Anecdote<br>  <br>  A short account of an interesting or humorous incident.<br>  <br>  ?|`|pDGVTLoFaa	Linguistic means languages so devices could be a french speaking c.d or a german phrase book as examples.

s9tvr0DTaa	The Irish Republican Army (IRA) (Irish: óglaigh na héireann[1]) was an Irish republican revolutionary military organisation descended from the Irish Volunteers, established 25 November 1913 and who in April 1916 staged the Easter Rising.[2] The Irish Volunteers were recognised in 1919 by Dáil éireann (its elected assembly) as the legitimate army of the unilaterally declared Irish Republic, the Irish state proclaimed at Easter in 1916 and reaffirmed by the Dáil in January 1919. Thereafter, the IRA waged a guerrilla campaign against British rule in Ireland in the Irish War of Independence from 1919–1921.<br>  <br>  The original IRA split in 1922. After the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1921, members of the IRA who supported the Treaty formed the nucleus of the National Army founded by IRA leader Michael Collins. However, a high proportion of the IRA was opposed to the treaty. The anti-Treaty IRA fought a civil war with their former comrades in 1922–23, with the intention of creating a fully independent all Ireland republic. Having lost the civil war, this group remained in existence, with the intention of overthrowing both the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland and re-establishing the Irish Republic declared in 1919.<br>  <br>  Origins<br>  Physical force Irish republicanism as an ideology had a long history, from the United Irishmen of the 1798 and 1803 rebellions, to the Young Irelander Rebellion of 1848 and the Irish Republican Brotherhood rebellion of 1867. In addition, the methods of the IRA were to some extent inspired by the traditions of militant agrarian Irish secret societies like the Defenders, the Ribbonmen and the supporters of the Irish Land League.<br>  <br>  The acronym IRA was first used by the IRB organization in America (also known as the Fenian Brotherhood). This "Irish Republican Army" of the 1860s comprised the American Fenians' paramilitary forces, organized into a number of regiments. Fenian soldiers wearing IRA insignia fought at the Battle of Ridgeway on 2 June 1866. However the term Irish Republican Army in its modern sense was first used in the second decade of the 20th century for the rebel forces of the Irish Volunteers and the Irish Citizens Army during the Easter Rising. It was subsequently, and most commonly, used for those Volunteers who fought a guerrilla campaign in 1919–1921 in support of the Irish Republic declared in 1919.|`|AA11809403	this is a good start<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Republican_Army" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Repub...</a>|`|w7pOlYYOaa	nope sorry|`|acf19784c47b1f7b60623f6016329936aa	ira irish republican army aka irish rebel army was a group of isish people who joined together to prevent the black and tans(british) invading ireland<br>  <br>  go onto www.wikipedia.org and type in ira|`|IBWM7LjSaa	You can find a very complete background at this site.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/</a>

She is evil, seductive, and witch-like all at the same time. <br>  <br>  However, during the play we see her in two different ways.  At the time when we <br>  <br>  first meet her, she is a brutally violent, power wanting witch, and later on she <br>  <br>  turns to a shameful suicidal grieving woman. <br>  <br>  <br>          At the beginning of the MacBeth, Lady MacBeth is very savage and vicious. <br>  <br>  She thinks nothing of killing King Duncan.  She has no sense of what is wrong <br>  <br>  and right, and believes that it is perfectly moral to do the deed of murder. <br>  <br>  She states that to not go through with the deed would be horrible to yourself, <br>  <br>  and that you would be a coward in your own eyes. <br>  <br>    <br>  <br>          "Wouldst thou have that which thou esteem'st the ornament <br>  <br>          of life, and live a coward in thine own esteem," <br>  <br>    <br>  <br>  She states that if she was MacBeth and did not jump at this perfect opportunity, <br>  <br>  that if a child, being fed at her breast, where as Duncan is, king, she would <br>  <br>  tear it from her and "dash'd the brains out" to have the opportunity MacBeth <br>  <br>  does.  This shows how mad and sadistic she was.  She had absolutely no self- <br>  <br>  conscience, and thought nothing about the wrong they were soon to commit. <br>  <br>    <br>  <br>          Later on, after the murders, she, unlike MacBeth, still shows no signs <br>  <br>  of a conscience.  She is very cool and collected, while MacBeth hallucinates and <br>  <br>  goes temporarily mad.  Lady MacBeth on the other hand, takes everything calmly. <br>  <br>  She takes the daggers back to the King's room, smears blood on the drunken <br>  <br>  guards, and attempts to destroy all evidence of MacBeth ever being there.  She <br>  <br>  knows what needs to be done and does it without any hesitation or fear. <br>  <br>    <br>  <br>          However, it is later on in the story, that it is revealed to us that <br>  <br>  Lady MacBeth's conscience is strong.  When sleep walking one night, Lady MacBeth <br>  <br>  (seemingly somewhat insane) begins blabbering about spots of blood on her hands. <br>  <br>    <br>  <br>          "Out damned spot! out, I say! One; two: why, then 'tis time <br>  <br>          to do't  Hell is murky!  Fie, my lord - fie! a soldier and <br>  <br>          afeard?" <br>  <br>    <br>  <br>  When at first she believes that "a little water clears us of this deed", and now <br>  <br>  she can smell the blood on her hands still, and "all the perfumes of Arabia will <br>  <br>  not sweeten this little hand".  She now realizes the consequences of what she <br>  <br>  has done.  She knows that the sin will be on her soul forever, and that nothing <br>  <br>  will be able to cleanse it.  She realizes "What's done cannot be undone". <br>  <br>    <br>  <br>          But this can not be redemption.  She has done the deed and must expect <br>  <br>  the consequences.  Her wrong doing has been too much, she has committed the <br>  <br>  mortal sin. Though she now realizes it (even this is skeptical, since she was <br>  <br>  sleep-walking at the time), she has still the deed on her soul.  It can never be <br>  <br>  totally cleansed, therefore Lady MacBeth can never have total redemption. <br>  <br>    <br>  <br>          Lady MacBeth is a complex character.  She is seen as two totally <br>  <br>  different people as the play progresses.  At first, she is crazy about getting <br>  <br>  the power of the King.  She is brutish and sadistic in both the things she says <br>  <br>  and does.  But as the play progresses, she begins to understand the consequences <br>  <br>  of her actions, and goes slightly mad from these thoughts.  She can never be <br>  <br>  totally redeemed of her mortal sin, and realizes this.  It is perhaps this, that <br>  <br>  gives her the most redemption of all. <br>  <br>  <br>  How to Cite this Page<br>  MLA Citation:<br>  "Shakespeare's Macbeth - Lady MacBeth." 123HelpMe.com. 04 Mar 2009 <br>      <>.<a href="http://www.123HelpMe.com/view.asp?id=17209>." rel="nofollow">http://www.123HelpMe.com/view.asp?id=172...</a>

gPgVfWdVaa	I am not sure about a "trade school", but most community colleges offer a nursing program for ADN (RN) or a PN program for LPN's. I attend Henderson Community College in KY, and I started from the beginning also. I didn't have any previous college before this. If you get online and look at schools in your area, Im sure you will find one that has a program. You have to start with your basics though. The best thing about a community college is the price of tuition vs. a University. The program for RN is about 3 1/2 yrs all together, and the LPN is about 2 1/2 yrs.   Hope this helps!  Good Luck!

gb9REJN4aa	There are rules, but I caution you that rules are made to be broken! Here are the rules:<br>  <br>  When a verb ends with C, T, or D, then you pronounce the past tense like "ed" or "id," a whole syllable to itself. Here are some examples: attended (att-end-ed), hated (hAt-ed), arrested (ar-rest-ed).<br>  <br>  When a verb ends with P, K, S, CH, SH, F, X, or H (which we call "voiceless sounds"), then you pronounce the past tense like a "t" at the end of the word. This does not add an extra syllable. Here are some examples: baked (bAkt), looked (lookt), watched (watcht).<br>  <br>  When a verb ends with any other letters (voiced sounds, or vowel sounds which we usually call dipthongs) then the past tense sounds like a "d" on the end of the word. This one also doesn't add an extra syllable. Some examples: cleaned (cleand), cried (cried), jailed (jaild).<br>  <br>  Those are the rules. There are two exceptions. The first is in poetry or archaic uses of English words. Sometimes in these cases, they will take a word that we expect to end in the affixed "t" or "d" sound, but will want you to read it as a whole extra syllable for metrical reasons (and because the form of English wasn't as fixed in the past). So for example, we say "loved" (lovd), but sometimes in poetry you will see loved (lov-ed) in order to make a rhyme. This is often indicated by putting an accent mark on the "e," like this: lovèd.<br>  <br>  The second exception is that in British English actual pronunciation is more fluid, because there are still many British accents out there. I've given you the "rules," but people who speak perfectly consistent native English in different accents may sometimes speak with slightly different rules.

YOM7UcRoaa	there's light and dark imagery :]|`|xJoMSkI5aa	Sonnet 18:<br>  <br>  Personified Nature<br>  <br>  From the beginning of the poem, the speaker tries to set up a contrast between the beloved and a summer’s day. He tries really hard to distinguish them, ultimately arguing that the beloved, unlike nature, will be saved by the force and permanence of his poetry. The thing is, the contrast doesn’t really work, since summer, if anything, seems much more eternal than the beloved. If being written about preserves immortality, then the summer ought to be immortal because the speaker’s writing about it as well. And then there’s the fact that summer actually is, in some sense, immortal, since it returns in full force every year.<br>  <br>  From Shmoop

jdV5o8NMaa	1. Acute metabolic Alkalosis.  Caused from the loss of fluids the ratio of what to sodium bicarb increases. And also your body is loosing K a buffer in response your kidneys excreate more HCO3 to normalize this loss Like if you boiled salt water the water would became more salty due to less water.<br>  2 Vomiting would cause this because of the dehydration <br>  3.  Book wise you would expect it to slow to normalize pH by by increasing CO2 and in this case she is breathing slower/ shallower due to higher CO2.  But this is rare clinically and you don't see it happen  so in this case this has been an on going issue hence the 3 days of vomiting<br>  4.  the decreased BP was due to the increased fluid loss.  Less volume causes lower pressures.  If you had a water balloon the less water in it the less pressure on the balloon walls.  Your skin and mucous membranes require water to be flexible and moist. Your body will pull water from surrounding tissues due to the higher salt concentration in your blood, same as in the answer to number 1<br>  5. The decreased K and Cl are due to the decrease in stomach fluids<br>  6 is beyond my area of explaining learned it once couldnt repeat it simply  sorry  so this page might help it talks about vomiting specifically <br>  <br>  <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=57RQC-3OPtUC&pg=PT683&lpg=PT683&dq=decreases+K+due+to+vomiting&source=bl&ots=m7PrQZMnH1&sig=4gXqGu6WEjpgP75UotzHPzKlx7E&hl=en&ei=lQGoSdK6DYTFnQfWjLzwDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result#PPT686,M1" rel="nofollow">http://books.google.com/books?id=57RQC-3...</a>

5iv8axUsaa	Guess what?<br>  I have just started debating, and my first topic is:<br>  Why should we value literature more than science, and i'm negative, so i gotta say science is better.<br>  We have these points so far...<br>  #1. science includes technology, and technology has had a great impact on the way we live now. Things like television, phones, computers and transport are all part of technology. Imagine life without a car, or a phone.<br>  #2. Another very important part of science is medicine. Through biology and chemistry, we have discovered sooo much, we have got cures for diseases and made so many medicines, the ones that are sitting on the shelves of chemists. Imagine life without a panadol or a doctor checkup.<br>  #3. Science provides many career ppertunities. As long as you study and keep to it, you can make a great career. With art, will ppl like your work?<br>  <br>  Well, thats my biggest points. I didnt write it in professional language, cause the good copy is at school.

Nin6IawVaa	why you want to do that? I don't know your reasons. But I will tell you one thing that my mom told me when I was young<br>  <br>  "These are your golden years. Eduaction is the only skill which will stay with you. No one can take it away from you and it will take you to greater things,"<br>  <br>  I don't know your family background. I don't know wjat you go through in school, but dropping out will only take you to wrong path. <br>  <br>  Don't do it. If you are struggling in studies, go to your teacher and ask for help. If you are bothered by students in school, ignore them. They are ruining themselves and yourfuture. If it's your family.....go to library to study.|`|jw0yBpGHaa	It makes no sense to ask us when you can ask your guidance counselor.|`|ydHU7gYIaa	you have to be of a certain age- probably 17. dropping out is a huge mistake and shows that you dont want to try because youre lazy. future potential employers will see that and they wont hire you, and you will surely end up in a dead-end job- those are the only jobs high school dropouts qualify for.|`|siGe2zloaa	not sure about NY but here in california it is 16 or 17<br>  i suggest you do it and go to the library and get a REAL education - high schools teach you lies, and the "curriculum" is a way to indoctrinate millions of children to transform them into polite, "politically correct" citizens. good luck, and may peace overcome.|`|D3D2vGFPaa	you know what?i could tell you the requirements but im not going to!why would you want to drop out of school?what kind of live will you have if you do that?i have teenage boys that dropped out and i hate that they did there is no kind of life today without an education.Please do yourself a favor think twice before you drop out!|`|QZLqpRw1aa	The main requirement would be you being crazy to drop out of school!!!!!

cL0aHkYEaa	Gosh!  This one was hard!  I had to really dig, and finally came up with a glossary related to Indian (from India) cooking.  Ararote is Arrowroot!<br>  <a href="http://www.isamaj.com/food/glossary/a.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.isamaj.com/food/glossary/a.ht...</a><br>  <br>  Here's a little more:<br>  <br>  Much like with cornstarch or other thickeners, mix arrowroot with cold water until completely dissolved. Then add mixture to sauce or liquid to be thickened, stirring constantly with a wire whisk (if adding to liquid only) or a wooden spoon (if adding to liquid with chunks) until it reaches desired consistency. Generally speaking, the real thickening happens when boiling temperatures are reached. Keep in mind it will continue to thicken slightly even after removed from heat, so keep stirring for a couple of minutes to be safe.<br>  <a href="http://www.cookadvice.com/cooking_tips/how_to_use-185.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cookadvice.com/cooking_tips/h...</a><br>  <br>  If you can't find arrowroot powder, then cornstarch would probably be fine.

AA11735935	Think of a caricature.  It's a picture of someone, and certain identifying aspects of that person are enlarged and accentuated.  For example, the ears of both President Bush and President Obama are larger than life in editorial cartoons.<br>  <br>  Now, if we take that caricature of President Bush and put a book in his hands and put a puzzled look on his face, we have satire as Bush was not noted for his eloquence (earned or unearned).<br>  <br>  The book represents knowledge, i.e. the visual symbolism.  Bush's perplexed look symbolizes his lack of knowledge.<br>  <br>  The satire, which is the use of a portrayal to show shortcomings, could be to say that Bush came up short as a President, or the the United States came up short in choosing him.<br>  <br>  (All of that is not meant to criticize or support.  It's just an example).

82a4bd999404bced3be0ccff2c393a40aa	Well, since Follies was actually a Broadway show, you need to do music. I know one year my town did a tribute to Elvis. You could do Motown, Broadway, the sky is the limit. Choreograph it and make it funny. You could do the "I'm glad I am a _______, there's nothing I'd rather be" song.<br>  <br>  I'm glad I am a teacher<br>  There's nothing I'd rather be<br>  For if I weren't a teacher<br>  A _________ I would be.<br>  <br>  You insert something after that for each teacher, and then you have a motion or something you say that has a rhythm. As you add teachers and they do it all at the same time, it sounds awesome.<br>  <br>  Some examples:<br>  *A plumber I would be--"Plunge, flush, look out below!"<br>  *A milkmaid I would be--"Give, Bessie, give. The baby's gotta live!"<br>  *A cheerleader I would be--"Go! Go! I really gotta go!"<br>  *A photographer I would be--"Got the camera, got the film, I need a little flash!" (wearing a long coat and then open it up on flash)<br>  *A ballerina I would be--no words, but have someone (preferably a guy) in a tutu spinning and twirling.<br>  *A librarian I would be--"Beep! Beep! Beep! Beep!" (and from off to the side someone yells "Stop scanning the books!"<br>  <br>  and my favorite...<br>  <br>  *A fence post I would be--and the person just stands there straight and tall.<br>  <br>  You can come up with others, but it's really fun and everyone gets a laugh out of it.

cloASB6paa	The best thing to do, in my opinion, is to start from the beginning. I think you're having trouble right now because you're halfway into the school year and you don't have an understanding of the basic material. Take home your textbooks every night and, starting from Chapter One, THOROUGHLY read it until you've grasped it. In math, make flashcards of all the formulas or theorems you've learned thus far. In science, you've just got to read it and grasp it... you can also go online for extra research to make it easier. Of course you still have to study what you're currently learning, but the extra load is just a small price to pay for a high school degree. I think it'd help if you got extra help. Usually at high schools they have National Honor Society students help out other students at no cost before or after school, or you can pay a tutor or possibly ask a friend for help. Going to teachers is a plus. Some even give extra credit if you come for more help. I'm assuming you state exam isn't for a couple of weeks... get cracking on those books NOW. If you need more study tips, message me! :D And good luck!
05f135eb5c00c9813c91e82aba63e29caa	It is mostly about public speaking, but it teaches you to be an effective communicator in general (speaking & writing). There is also a leadership component to the Toastmasters program.<br>  <br>  Everyone starts off with what is called the Competent Communicator manual, which has ten projects that teach basic speaking skills: how to organize a speech, how to use body language/gestures, how to vary your vocal dynamics (tone, pitch, pacing, etc), how to use visual aids/props.<br>  <br>  After you finish the Competent Communicator manual, there are several advanced specialty manuals you can start: storytelling, professional speaking, public relations, technical presentations, communicating on television, special occasion speeches, etc.<br>  <br>  I would say that if you are in a situation where you do a lot of speaking, Toastmasters can help you keep your skills sharp. The cost varies from club to club. There is a base membership cost of $27 each six months, which goes to Toastmasters International. The club will tack on its own dues, which varies depending upon the expenses of the club. For example, some clubs rent out a meeting room at a hotel for their meetings, so those dues are going to be higher. Other clubs meet at public facilities, like library meeting rooms.<br>  <br>  I would go to the Toastmasters web site (link below) and click on the link on the left that reads "Find a location near you." Plug in your zip code and, depending upon your geography, you should get a list of clubs in your area. If the Club Status of a club reads "Membership eligibility criteria required - Contact club," that usually means that it is a corporate club that is only open to employees of that company (because the company probably pays for the membership dues).<br>  <br>  Contact several clubs that fit your schedule and needs and pay them a visit. Clubs vary on how often they meet; most meet weekly but some meet every other week. It won't cost you anything to take a visit. You'll see the same basic structure of a meeting: prepared speeches, speech evaluations, and then something called Table Topics, which are questions that are thrown out to see how well you can speak in an impromptu manner. You won't be required to speak if you are a guest, so don't be too fearful.

If you have a YMCA in your area, there are times and days devoted strictly to home schooled kids where you can at least make some friends with other kids not in the school system.

These are just a few ideas.

Q7lvSU03aa	My advice: choose a career that you can find a job in.  Yes, designing snowboards sounds cool and would be super fun, but how many jobs are there for that?  <br>  <br>  Think about things you are good at, you can even take a multiple choice test to do this.  I then would research the areas you are interested in.  For example, if you want to be an interior designer, call a interior design company and introduce yourself.  Ask if you can talk to an interior designer.  Ask things like what schooling they got, how hard was it to get a job, what do they like about their job?  What do they not like?  What skills should a person have?  That should help you really understand if this is something you really want to do.<br>  <br>  Picking a job is not easy, and it is very important.  The last thing you want is to have gone to college, spent tons of money on a degree, and then find out wait I don't like this or I can't get a job in this.  Take the time to make the right decision and it will pay off in the end.<br>  <br>  And if you want to design t-shirts or do other creative things - start it as a hobby.  Try selling your work on the side.  Creative jobs are more about talent then training, in my opinion.|`|MDgVPwU3aa	It's perfectly fine to have more than one interest in the career you wish to choose.<br>  <br>  There are career tests that you can take that will help in finding what you are most passionate about. Plus info on pay for the career chosen. While in college you can take different internships to get the feel of what you really want to do also. I am a web/graphics designer...but I have also worked as an ESL teacher in different countries and planning to get my MA in International Development this year.

You can use them to your benefit in the evaluation.<br>  <br>  Before sending an email to the group, talk with the other members in the group. Get their feelings on the situation. Explain to them that you can't make the meetings on Monday. See how the feel about meeting at another time. If so, go ahead and set up a time with them. Once a day and time has been set with the other group members, send an email to the whole group about the meeting day and time. This way things can shift to your power (or co-control with other members). If this idiot throws a fit then go to the professor and explain that the guy has created a mandatory meeting during a time that you can't attend and refuses to change the day and time. Be sure to take the emails with you.|`|wizn6YReaa	ha, he sounds like a right plonker!<br>  <br>  i've been in this situtation before too and i know that it is really frustrating. <br>  <br>  without being aggressive i think you should let him know that you are dedicated to your group but also have other commitments.

I hope I gave you a few useful hints. You still need to find reference. Good luck!|`|k0YYUufKaa	Read the book "The Underground History of American Education" by John Taylor Gatto.

If you do well in biology but falter in math, it's probably because you're more into hands-on interactive work. You can make math more fun by having your parents, friends, teachers, etc help you make it a visual process. Play games or something with math formulas. Plus, it's NEVER too late to start learning. It even helps sometimes to start from the beginning. It doesn't take as long as it does in school to relearn everything. Teachers tend to spend more time than necessary to get everyone in the class to reach a point of understanding.<br>  <br>  I know you're trying really hard. This happens to me a lot too. I try and try and study and study, but the end result is dismal. But when you're at your lowest, the only way it can go is UP!<br>  <br>  Don't worry, plenty of people have based their lives on their street smarts and skills rather than their book smarts. My dad, for example, was HORRIBLE in school. He got D's and F's (I live in the US, and I'm assuming you're from the UK and I don't the UK grading system, those are failing grades) but he pulled through and relied on his skill, painting, and became a really successful artist! You'll get there :)|`|wyAbkG3oaa	I will give you a hug. I know how you feel. I was in the bottem set for all my classes, and had to have extra help. Just keep trying, do your best.

VP38JPA2aa	The goal of balancing the equations is to make sure that the same number of molecules of each element are present on each side of the equation, as per the Law of Conservation of Mass.  So:<br>  <br>  1.  2Na + 2H2O -> 2NaOH + H2   2Na on each side, 4H's, 2 O's <br>  <br>  2.

C3H8 + 5O2 -> 3CO2 + 4H2O  3C's, 8 H's, 10 O's<br>  <br>  Sometimes, it makes it easier to start with the odd numbered ones, like the C3H8, and work backwards.|`|zKoyYVa6aa	Okay, this is pretty easy. <br>  <br>  3.)

It's easier to just add one on each side until you balance it. Um... it's easier to do then explain.  Write out each number you have like I did above.  Then just try numbers.  It's more or less a guess-and-check.|`|AA10439008	Na+ H2O --> NaOH + H2<br>  you end up with 1 more H than you start with so make it 2 H20.  But now you end with 2 O so you need 2 Na<br>  <br>  so 2 Na + 2 H2O = 2 NaOH + H2<br>  <br>  S8 + O2 --> SO3<br>  you start with 8S so need at least 8 on the other side so 8 SO3<br>  <br>  but that is 24 O so you need 12 O2 to start<br>  S8 + 12 O2 = 8 SO3<br>  <br>  like that

Depending on a variety of circumstances, homeschooling might be best for someone else-or it might be public or private.  There is no one size fits all, that is best for all.

That's the college I'm going to apply for when I'm almost done with highschool for law.|`|Dj7C8yO5aa	you have really good extra curriculars but you should give your sat's, because those probably weigh in pretty heavily on whether or not you'll be accepted.|`|ltnIV73Daa	bro u already know you can get in for sure :)|`|qwvijKexaa	wow, of course|`|uzmeBpkjaa	I'd say you have a pretty good chance with those stats, but college admissions is tricky. I applied to NYU last year with a 3.8, pretty decent SAT scores, and a crapload of extracurriculars. They turned me down because of some minority program they recommended me for, and it turned out that I wasn't black enough or poor enough.  I ended up at The University of Chicago. Sometimes, schools need to fill a quota, whether it be for grade distribution for the stats they post on College Board, or for racial diversity. It all depends on what they're looking for, and whether you fit this year's mold. <br>  <br>  I'd say you should just be sure that your application reflects something special about you. All the students applying with 3.6-4.0's are going to have the same clubs as you, and the same volunteer work. If you don't fit the mold, let them know that you've got something unique that sets you apart, and makes you worth acceptance.|`|6jcEtPPKaa	Sounds to me like you have a pretty good chance to get into NYU.

Fields<br>  <br>  I have no right, by anything I do or say, to demean a human being in his own eyes. What matters is not what I think of him; it is what he thinks of himself. To undermine a man`s self-respect is a sin. Antoine de Saint-Exupery <br>  <br>  How far you go in life depends on your being tender with the young, compassionate with the aged, sympathetic with the striving and tolerant with the weak and wrong...because sometime in your life you will have been all of these. George Washington Carver <br>  <br>  A man told his grandson: "A terrible fight is going on inside me -- a fight between two wolves. One is evil, and represents hate, anger, arrogance, intolerance, and superiority . The other is good, and represents joy, peace, love, tolerance, understanding, humility, kindness, empathy, generosity, and compassion. This same fight is going on inside you, inside every other person too." The grandson then asked: "Which wolf will win?" The old man replied simply: "The one you feed." Anon.<br>  <br>  You can stand tall without standing on someone. You can be a victor without having victims. Harriet Woods<br>  <br>  Do what you feel in your heart to be right - for you'll be criticized anyway. You'll be damned if you do, and damned if you don't. Eleanor Roosevelt<br>  <br>  No one can make you feel inferior without your consent. Eleanor Roosevelt<br>  <br>  When all the trees have been cut down, when all the animals have been hunted, when all the waters are polluted, when all the air is unsafe to breathe, only then will you discover you cannot eat money.

We will not learn how to live together in peace by killing each other's children.

I have no argument with the essential part they play in the reproduction of the species. However, the reproductive process have been assured by the pleasure both parties receive when they engage in it. I contend that love is love and sex is sex. When combined, they work well together.

53421e012c57832fd6b3b13029dd2b9eaa	I have no idea what 4b/5c are, but you can take any GCSEs you like as long as the school offers them and they don't conflict with other subjects. Sometimes the teacher may advise you your subjects will be hard/too easy, and try and get you to do something more suitable to your standards.

Hughes saw the dreams of many residents of Harlem, New York crumble in the wake of World War II. Some read this poem as a warning, believing that the speaker argues that deferred dreams will lead to social unrest. Notably, Lorraine Hansberry chose a line from this poem as the title of her famous play, A Raisin in the Sun, which explores the idea of delayed dreams in the world of a black family living in the South Side of Chicago during the 1950s. <br>  <br>  From Shmoop/Harlem/Langston Hughes

OeQ32mWyaa	Don't Go In<br>  <br>  Have you watched a scary movie and then gone to bed right after? Your mind scrambles with ideas about different movie endings or parts of the movie you really liked? What happens when you go to bed and end up waking up in a world you've never been to? A world where you no longer exist and you have to find your way out by overcoming obstacles...would you be able to handle it?<br>  <br>  "Let's go play in the woods," said Tina. "I don’t know, last time we did, mother was mad," replied Shawn. "Don’t be such a baby, Shawn! All we’re going to do is check out the old farm house... who knows, maybe the tools will come alive to get you... ha ha!" Tina said in a mocking voice. "Stop it, stop it right now!" screamed Shawn. "Hold your horses," laughed Tina. "I’m going to tell Mom," snickered Shawn. "If you do, I’ll just lie, and tell Mom who really broke the dish," grinned Tina. "So you might as well just come into the woods," Tina proudly said. "Fine!" pouted Shawn.<br>  <br>  They started creeping into the woods. Owls hooted, trees shook in the wind, giving the appearance of the trees trying to reach out and grab the children. They slowly approached the old farmhouse. The sky slightly darkened, as a sign to be aware of something deadly. The branches brushed up against the windows, making the children’s hearts pump faster. An eagle above them screamed, which shot chills up both of their spines. Their stomachs caught in their throats, causing their screams to be choked up. Tina looked over at her brother; her jaw was dropping.<br>  <br>  Shawn decided to take over as the leader and opened the door to the farmhouse. "Wait!" yelled Tina. "Why?" Shawn asked wide eyed. "Maybe it’s not such a good idea to go in," squeaked Tina. "Look who’s the baby now!" teased Shawn. With that, he took a look once more at his sister and went inside. A roar of thunder boomed and scared Tina, throwing her to the muddy, murky ground. Two seconds later, Tina heard Shawn screaming. "Help me, please don’t let it hurt me!" Tina got to her feet and ran into the farmhouse as quickly as her feet could take her. What she saw made her heart skip a beat. She looked up at a horrifying creature that felt like it had pierced her heart with a hot dagger. Shawn had a rope around his neck and there was no doubt in Tina’s mind that this hideous creature was going to hurt her brother.<br>  <br>  She could feel her body turning cold, and she began feeling dizzy. The creature’s teeth were clinched in a smile, while his greasy hands held the rope tightly. Tina couldn’t bare to watch. She quickly turned around and screamed... "I’m sorry Shawn! I’m sorry for all the teasing I ever did to you!" She started running faster and faster out of the farmhouse and through the woods. Tears were now streaming down her cheeks. The sound of her heart was pulsing in her eardrums as she breathed heavily. She finally reached her house and went in to find her mother.<br>  <br>  A lady, with an apron tied around her, was cooking in the kitchen. "Mom, something’s happened to Shawn. We have to save him!" she exclaimed. "Mom? Shawn? Who are you?" asked the lady. "What? What do you mean who am I... I’m your daughter!" "I’m not your mother. I don’t even have children," Tina quickly ran up to her room and closed her eyes once she landed on her bed.<br>  <br>  This isn’t happening, Tina thought to herself. There has to be a reasonable answer for all of this. She closed her eyes. The words ‘go back’ appeared in front of the dark space of her eyelids. She quickly fluttered her eyes open and bolted up from laying down. She ran out of her room and rushed down the stairs. The woman who was her mother before, looked blankly at her. Once she was outside, she could hear the mushy, misty grass squish underneath her shoes. The air was cooler now and braced her face with every step she took. She wasn’t sure why she was rushing back...she didn’t know what she was going to do when she got there. It felt like a force was behind her, giving her that extra step to continue going. She kept looking at the ground as she ran, she knew she was going have to look up. She could feel the strange calm beginning to take over. The air was colder, the sky was even darker, she could smell the filthy beast. It was an odor so strong, it could paralyze anyone in their tracks. Tina banged into the doors with all her might, after a few tries...she got into the old farmhouse.<br>  <br>  Tools were flying, doors were smashing against the walls into tiny pieces. It could make anyone’s ear drums split. She felt a chilly hand grasp around her arm, she jerked away. The monster was standing right in front of her...she looked all around and couldn’t see her brother anywhere. "Shawn?" Where was he... "Shawn!" He was no where to be seen. She ran from the hideous creature trying to catch her. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw her brother’s hand. "Shawn...run!!!" "I can’t, I’m stuck!" he screamed back. Tina ran over to him, trying to un tangle his legs from the rope, th|`|mAjQLl7Faa	Please try your best to write a short story, and start as soon as possible on it.

This secondary sense concerns pronunciation and tone, rather than word choice and style.<br>  <br>  Diction has multiple concerns; register — words being either formal or informal in social context — is foremost. Literary diction analysis reveals how a passage establishes tone and characterization, e.g. a preponderance of verbs relating physical movement suggests an active character, while a preponderance of verbs relating states of mind portrays an introspective character. Diction also has an impact upon word choice and syntax.<br>  <br>  Used in speaking and singing.

AA10837912	I like that
Q7lvSU03aa	It all depends on the area you live.  Some states require you to get a master's degree.  <br>  <br>  I don't think districts prefer new graduates because they're cheaper.  Here's my logic - teachers get paid much more for years experience than for an advanced degree.  To get that first job you need to stand out - and anything that gives you a leg up I think would help.<br>  <br>  Here is my advice - widen your net.  Apply for less desirable jobs.  Look into private schools.  Get a job working with kids but not as a teacher.   If you decide to get your masters, get it something other than Elementary Education so you learn in a new area.  While you get your master's degree substitute teach.  Schools are much more likely to hire someone they are familiar with.  Don't give up!  That first job is the hardest - but you will find it!|`|ebJ02QZJaa	I think it is a waste of time and money.  If you decide later on to teach at a college level, then you'll want to pursue it.  But, truthfully, if you are going to teach at the elementary and high school levels, having a Master's will probably make you less attractive as they probably figure you are just using them as a stepping stone to bigger and better.  <br>  <br>  Move to TN.  They are hurting for teachers here and are to the point of hiring people without teaching degrees.  As long as you have a college degree, you can teach in TN.  I have an engineering degree and am qualified to teach math and physics because my college courses were math and science heavy.  I am seriously considering making the career change (nothing is safe in the manufacturing world these days), however, it's mostly the inner-city schools in the larger cities that are hiring and I'm not sure I want to get involved in that.|`|82a4bd999404bced3be0ccff2c393a40aa	It's actually true that you can educate yourself out of a job--especially the way the economy is right now. In fact, I answered a question earlier where the asker was asking why he/she COULDN'T get a job. Turns out he/she had 2 Master's degrees. What you should do is get a teaching job, get tenured, and THEN go for the Master's degree.

So, take your grades and add them in, and create an equation with the unknown as your final grade and solve.|`|MGJXinZxaa	What she probably meant was you score * 0.8 + score on the exam *0.2.<br>  <br>  This means the your course is worth 80% while your final is worth 20%.<br>  <br>  You currently have 44.26% already in that course even if you didn't write the final.

In this case I'd say they are advocating for a problem in the health care industry that needs to be fixed.  This time it just so happens to be a geriatric problem.  <br>  <br>  2.  I believe it would be care that does not stop from appointment to appointment, that the patient would have access to the primary doctor or physician assistant or nurse 24/7 via computer email or on-call caregiver by phone.  In this way, any concern or problems the patient is having can be tended to  quickly by advice, prescription, house call, EMT/ambulance, referral, whomever.  In addition, the different types of care the patient needs could be across specialties, and therefore all of the doctors that take care of this person would have access to the patient's complete medical record.<br>  <br>  3.

Lfh0DWppaa	A certification is simply that: a paper that shows you are competent in an area of specialization. It could be anything from a certificate to give massages to a certificate as a specific type of medical doctor (like being certified to perform certain procedures, etc).<br>  <br>  A master's degree, however, means a person has gone to several years of college beyond the high school level, and generally has a bachelor's degree before they start the master's.  A master's usually takes about 2 years or so to complete, and it is a degree conferred upon the student after completion.<br>  <br>  Granted, some colleges give certificates to people who have done several years of school--so even though a certificate is not a degree conferred (which could also be used then to obtain a doctorate), a certificate could still mean someone sat through hours (or years) of classes to obtain that certification.<br>  <br>  I think the best example is that some schools allow PA's (who are nearly medical doctors) obtain a PA-C which means they're a certified PA. Other schools grant the same students MS degrees in PA studies. Both are PA's which see patients and prescribe medicine, but one has a degree and the other was given a certificate.<br>  <br>  I suppose it's complex, but most people want that degree instead of the certificate. But in things like PA studies, they're both equal as far as career status. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps. :)

Q7lvSU03aa	I don't think it is a good thing, but I think you can still find a job.  The question is, why is your GPA so low?  Try to find a silver lining, like you blew off your freshman year but it turned it around later.  Or you got poor grades in non-education classes.  Just be ready with an answer, in case they ask about it.  Don't bring it up.  <br>  <br>  Try to get strong recommendations from some of your teachers and if you did any student teaching, with your mentor teacher. <br>  <br>  You also might apply for less desirable positions.  If you want to work at the best school in town where a lot of people are applying, you might have more trouble.  Once you have a few years experience under your belt I guarantee that GPA won't matter a bit.  Just get what you can at first and then transfer to the position you really want when you can.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AhFgj8ynaa	That's a tough one. You have your teaching license right? I guess if you have your license I'd say you should be able to get a job. I suppose the school districts will look at your GPA and wonder why it was so low, and some may not hire you, but I would think you would find a job somewhere. I guess I'm a little confused as to how you would be able to get your license with that low of a GPA. I guess I attended a school that is known for their education dept. and they require above and beyond what the state requires for you to obtain your license, so maybe I'm just confused because my college required more then was needed? I don't know?|`|tX4RNX1faa	look you learned you passed and you partied. I wouldn't hire anything less than a 3.75 GPA but my standards only have room for the best and if you only tried hard enough to barely get by? then what seems apparent is the practice in school you were perfecting just might have a direction which could lead to the effort you would put forth as a teacher and quite frankly there are enough teachers in that can already. Too bad, you actually almost got me to say something light but your actions speak much louder than any words I can muster. In fact, grades like yours during a draft would have ended up having had your camouflaged tail not only drafted but carrying a weapon out in the desert.|`|82a4bd999404bced3be0ccff2c393a40aa	I think it depends on which courses caused your gpa to be that low. If it's in courses that had nothing to do with your major, it shouldn't matter at all. If you were getting C's in your education classes, I have to wonder about the school. Most schools I know of will make a student retake classes if they get below a B.<br>  <br>  Honestly, if the school gave you a degree and the state gave you a license, you should be fine. The main reason for providing your transcript is so that the school can make certain you actually graduated and got your degree.<br>  <br>  Don't stress. You'll be fine. Just charm them with your charisma.

BmrKFfYjaa	PSYCHO REVISITED<br>  <br>  “Do you remember the old movie “Psycho?” asked Charlie to his college room-mate George. “It’s on again tonight.”<br>  <br>  “Of course, I remember,” replied George. “The first time I saw it on TV I was about nine years old. It gave me NIGHTMARES for weeks afterwards. It was about this guy, Norman, who ran the Bates motel, and lived up on the hill in a HAUNTED HOUSE with his OLD AND SICK mother.”<br>  <br>  “I KNOW!” exclaimed Charlie. “I couldn’t SLEEP either, but the house wasn’t haunted. There was no ECTOPLASM or PARANORMAL EVENTS that couldn’t be explained. That old house didn’t even HAVE a SECRET PASSAGEWAY.”<br>  <br>  “COME to THINK of it, you’re right,” admitted George. “Just crazy ‘ol Norman who STRANGELY remained UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF his mother, even though she was dead..... Maybe she controlled him with WITCHCRAFT and SPELLS when she was still alive.”<br>  <br>  “Nah!” answered Charlie. “But she was a clinging, demanding woman who had forbidden him to have a life away from her. They POINTED out at the end how Norman gradually became his mother. Norman poisoned her and her lover because he was jealous of their relationship. Then he couldn’t stand the loss of his mother, so he dug up her body, taxidermied it, and began to pretend he was Mother to bring her back to life.  He wore her clothes, spoke in her voice, and held conversations with her, speaking in both voices. Usually, Mother was berating him for desiring women.”<br>  <br>  “BECAUSE Norman desired the beautiful young woman who stopped at the motel that rainy night, it was enough to SEND Norman completely over the edge," continued Charlie, "so Mother killed her.” <br>  <br>  “I remember the end,” replied George. “Mother (Norman) is sitting in a padded cell in an asylum, saying something like, ‘How can they ACCUSE me OF all these murders when they can see that all I can do is sit here in this chair. I hope they are watching. Why I’m not even going to swat that FLY. They’ll see, and they’ll say, ‘Why, she wouldn't even harm a fly'." <br>  <br>  “Well, now that we have completely revisited that movie, why don’t we go out and CATCH a new one—say 'Twilight'?” suggested Charlie.<br>  <br>  “Actually, I’m kinda hungry,” replied George. “Let’s get something to EAT FIRST. Why I can almost SMELL the French fries now.”<br>  <br>  “That’s because we live over a diner, you numb nutz,” said Charlie. <br>  <br>  As we leave THE boys, they have decided to watch “SCREAM 2” on another channel later that evening. <br>  <br>  PSYCHO Movie Trailer: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSQyf5YcEv8&NR=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSQyf5YcE...</a><br>  SCREAM 2 Movie Trailer: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U87t8x4ix0&feature=PlayList&p=C1C7DFD182C5570A&playnext=1&index=27" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U87t8x4i...</a>|`|T95J4Mnxaa	haunted stick under the influence of witchcraft hit bully.

bFfWFsFWaa	It's a little of both. A lot of the times "love" is used as a pet name like "honey" or "baby". "Hello love".<br>  <br>   Anyways, it means like "be my lover". Be the person who you give and receive love to and from. A significant other.|`|uC75y83Taa	It's almost like "Will you marry me?" I love you, will you love me back? <br>  It's very romantic. :)|`|KGOxYkh7aa	i think it means ill love you.|`|FN3UFa9saa	In my opinion the phrase "be my love" is insinuating that someone is asking for you to love them, and they will love you in return. When you think about it for love to be complete , it is a two way thing.<br>  <br>  For example in this part of the poem he says-<br>   Come live with me and be my love,<br>  And we will all the pleasures prove<br>  That valleys, groves, hills, and fields,<br>  Woods, or steepy mountain yields.<br>  <br>  <br>  Note in the poem he describes everything they will do together as WE... so its there love as a whole together<br>  <br>  I hope this helps :)|`|cBuYvBy2aa	I suppose it could mean both...it depends on how you're looking at it.<br>  Love isn't really directed to either person in the poem...<br>  but if you ask me, I would say it means something more like 'love me and I will love you'.|`|yDnBqGheaa	It could mean:<br>  "be my lover"<br>  "I want to love you"<br>  "I want you to love me as I love you"|`|49OViH4raa	Actually it means "i love you"

In 1792 the French government sent three commissioners with troops to try to reestablish control. They began to build an alliance with gens de couleur, who were looking for their rights.

That's why in the cold your house is warmer than it is outside. Also, when it rains, the roof has to hold rain, hail, lightning and what-not to protect you.|`|TebPFTrJaa	Hey<br>  I will answer the last one.<br>  The reason houses have more insulation in the roof than in the walls is due to convection which is when hot air rises and cool air falls.

c46140f0ed1bdf47a7f332d7d6ea3dc0aa	I'm sorry, but the above answerer is incorrect.<br>  <br>  You cannot receive federal student aid (grants, loans, etc.) if you do not already have a high school diploma or GED. The FAFSA will ask you if you already have a high school diploma or GED. Answering NO indicates to your school that you do not qualify for federal aid assistance. With that said, the FAFSA therefore is not an option for you. You may want to contact a representative from the school you plan to attend to obtain your GED and see if they have any privately funded aid sources that you can apply for.|`|SlPncQjcaa	Yes.  You have to fill out the FAFSA (The free application for federal student aid).  This is basically a free application that processes all of your information (taxes, yearly salary, finances, and other status) and it provides you with an idea of how much money in financial aid, and what types, you qualify for.  You should fill it out as soon as possible, and depending on the school you are trying to attend, the deadline might already be past for them.  When are you trying to attend school?  If you are going soon, you should apply for the 2008-2009 FAFSA before June.  If you are planning to attend after that (fall or later) go ahead and apply for the 2009-2010, so you can get an estimate of how much you will receive from the government and how much you are expected to pay (your "efc"--expected family contribution).  This form will tell you exactly what you may be eligible for like Federal Pell Grants which is basically free money from the government that never has to be repaid, or HOPE grants or scholarships if you live in Georgia like me.  If not, other states have programs similar to Georgia's HOPE programs.  You could also qualify for low interest Federal loans, so fill out the FAFSA and find out, and GOOD LUCK to you!!!!<br>  <br>  www.fafsa.ed.gov (fill it out today!!! It shoud take no more than a few weeks to process)

AA10392637	This is not a reason to skip school.  What did you do with the twenty dollars your Mom gave you yesterday?  My fathers favorite saying was "Money does not grow on trees."  In this instance your mom might have been trying to teach you how to budget, and maybe she did not explain this to you.  I think that you should put your coat on and go to school right now.  When you and your mom are both calm sit down together and discuss this issue of money.  Be sure each does not interrupt one another while explaining, and repeat back to each other what they heard.  This will help in your understanding between each other.  I see how you did say how you spent the $20.|`|yUBxjBsiaa	No skipping school is not great!!|`|D3D2vGFPaa	Is that ok?No, its not ok!You didnt go to school because you spent the money your mother gave you for lunch?What reason is that to skip school?Even if you dont have lunch money,most schools will give you credit for lunch or at least give you a sandwich ,milk and fruit!|`|kSrsPPGHaa	well what did you spend the twenty dollars on?<br>  If it was a video game or  something that wasn't absolutely vital,such as food, then you probably shouldn't  have spent it.<br>  <br>  You have four dollars so why didn't you use it?

I missed 240 days my junior and senior year, but even with that I still managed a 2.5 and graduated. <br>  <br>  He must really not be doing anything. Do you know if he's lazy, or just stupid? Stupidity can be solved by enrolling him in a trade school. Most public schools have some sort of specialization program. He can choose what he is interested in, and take classes that tailor to that. The focus is less on traditional work, and more on hands on learning. <br>  <br>  If it's just laziness, then he needs an incentive to do well. You guys can solve this. What does he like? Offer them as rewards for doing well in school. Hell, give him cash. It might teach him some financial responsibility. I would also suggest giving him rewards when you catch him doing something related to school. Not all the time, but enough to keep him honest. I would go as far to say, refuse all benefits except clothing, shelter, and food. Make him earn them. The better he does in school, the more rewards will come his way. <br>  <br>  After that, if he's still not carrying his weight, tell him to master the phrase, "Do you want fries with that?" If it gets to this point, it's all on him. He needs to hit rock bottom, and pick himself up. <br>  <br>  BTW, check with your school's attendance office.

Find topics that interest you especially in today's world such as the economic crisis.

It can also lay the guidelines for your personal finance.  <br>  <br>  If your falling asleep again read the material and challenge your own mind.

You can find facts through the HSUS regarding how many animals are put to sleep, how many enter shelters, how many are adopted.<br>  <br>  Or you could do a discussion on whether it should be mandatory to spay or neuter a dog or cat. Look at the statistics in regards to the number of animals entering shelters and being put down. Would it make sense to have a mandatory spay/neuter policy? <br>  <br>  Should there be more control of dog breeders? Again, look at how many animals are sold, how many are in shelters, etc. <br>  <br>  Mabye a mandatory microchipping regulation to keep animals connected with their owners. Also keep in mind that if a microchip is not updated, it is of no use. Look into number of animals who are lost annually.<br>  <br>  Should they ban horse actions, horse slaughters, shipping horses to other countries for meat purposes? What about the Mustangs? There have been a lot of problems with cattlemen refusing to allow the wild Mustangs to graze on state property because they say it takes grazing land from their profit-making business of cattle rancing, with certain laws in place that support this.

Gos3BRjQaa	There are many way to answer this question.<br>  First possibility: Adult teachers, or professors never become adult themselves. Indeed they go to school, learn something from others, then do the same thing in High School and University, then have their diploma, and began teaching. They never had the occasion to experience real life, and, so, they happen to teach to pupils that are still in the real life. They had to adapt, and according their character, they sometimes give that advice that’s not so bad. <br>  Second possibility. They are alone, facing countless of students, and among those students hundred of students that need to bullish other people in order to feel themselves. They can’t resolve the problem, and so rely to that answer.<br>  The third category are people that learn to become strong since the nursery school or later.<br>  a) Those teachers know how to do it, but not how to teach it. So they rely on the same answer.<br>  b) They know how to do it, not to teach it, but know how to communicate, or wake up the matter, so they say nothing, but some pupils feel the answer, and begin to set up defenses.<br>  c) They may tell something else, but it’s sometimes worse than to say ignore it, for building strong defense is the task of everyone. <br>  d) They know exactly what to say, and their words are listened to, but they rarely can act for everyone.

You should want to avoid debt altogether if at all possible, and by the sounds of your parent's income, you would probably not receive much grant assistance, if at all. If you chose to attend Boston, you would have to rely on loans to do so.<br>  <br>  What I would suggest you consider is why you are so interested in Boston in the first place. Does it offer a better academic program than Uccon? Or is it other, non-academic-related reasons that have you leaning toward that particular school?

ot1ZZexeaa	No, it's a very poor choice. UoP tells me two things about a prospective job applicant: they do not understand value and they lack patience to get the job done right the first time. I am doing my PhD at a very prestigious university and have worked in our HR department. I can assure you that any resumes with "U of P" on them anywhere go directly into the recycling bin. <br>  <br>  IT IS A FOR PROFIT COLLEGE. THERE IS NO INCENTIVE FOR THEM TO ENSURE A QUALITY EDUCATION FOR ITS STUDENTS OR SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THEIR PROGRAMS.<br>  <br>  Some employers might not care, but it's just not a risk you should take. The school lacks the academic rigor and in most cases is filled with students who don't understand what education is supposed to be. It's not supposed to be "rush" job, but rather a place to develop critical thinking skills and intellectual capabilities. <br>  <br>  Very few classes are taught by terminal degreed or PhD professors and in some cases classes are taught by people with Associates degrees. Now if you're going for a graduate education would you really want your instructors to have LESS education than you have? <br>  <br>  It is NOT accredited in all its programs and it is not well regarded. With so many cheaper and more viable options, the U of P is a great way to single out the morons among us.|`|510MC9SVaa	I don't know what type of job you are going to try to get afterwards, but I know that if you get a Psychology doctorate, you cannot get a job as a professor at most colleges.|`|2QS8j9aOaa	I know someone who grauduated from there and got their BA in Business,  but it was very expensive and she is still paying for it.<br>  Over 15,000 or so.|`|AA10023710	It's absolutely not a degree mill, but it's also a low ranking university. <br>  <br>  Whether or not it's good for a grad degree, and respected, depends on your field. Education or nursing, as I understand it, the U of P is respectable. MBA? Not so much. <br>  <br>  Their MBA program isn't AACSB accredited, which is a big issue with some employers. <br>  <br>  But where are you located? Are you in in the US? Then I'd have you look elsewhere for an MBA. But if you're in Latin America, I understand that the U of P MBA is well respected there. So there are also regional variations to consider.|`|aCILl7ctaa	I think any "online school" is not going to be as respected as a real school.<br>  <br>  It all really depends on what type of career you would be planning to pursue. If its very competitive hiring process, then your university prestige will come into play, but if not, then your school really does not matter.<br>  <br>  Bottom line is that I would suggest a good brick and mortar school, the best you can get into, over an online school.<br>  <br>  Good luck.
SapgcOZXaa	To have a "ready" smile or expression means the smile comes easily. If you think about, friendly people give smiles more freely and openly than unfriendly people.

4ab2ea36c0069d71d94055356c32ea00aa	Maria Montessori had an idea for peace education.  She said, "We must lay the foundation for peace ourselves by constructing a social environment, a new world for the child and adolescent, so that their individual consciences may develop.  A vast educational reform and, above all, a vast social reform are called for today."<br>  <br>  Basically, we believe the key to peace is through education.  In Montessori, we strive to achieve this through:<br>  --Self awareness<br>  --Community awareness<br>  --Cultural awareness<br>  --Environmental awareness<br>  <br>  There is a video that really does a great job explaining it:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MwuS377MpE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MwuS377M...</a><br>  <br>  Now, if you understand a little more about that...<br>  <br>  What happens on a global political level is that wars happen. Leaders rush past political boarders, people are killed, all that messy crap happens.  It is the work of politicians to try to help us avoid getting into those situations unless necessary.  If we're looking to politics to give us peace, we're looking in the wrong place.  Politician's job is almost reactionary.  Something happens and it demands a response.<br>  <br>  With education, we are trying to build a community where we cut it off before those actions happen.  We're trying to build a world where people love each others' cultures and really see themselves as part of the world.  So we're trying to really establish peace, not establish a way to avoid war.<br>  <br>  My goal as a Montessori educator is to develop children who will really have a connection with people in the world.  I want them to really feel a sense of peace with those around them and those far away.  I want them to feel a sense of responsibility for making choices that bring about peace.  Not just in a way of stopping wars, but visioning a world where there is no reason for war or violence between people, both on a large scale (globally or even locally) and small scale (in personal relationships).|`|EejNoMg2aa	Actualy yes. You have to learn how to be peacful and make peace, and it takes time and being good and stuff. To avoid war, all you have to do is avoid whoever/whatever you are having trouble with. That's what polotics does.|`|RIOC6ANUaa	Yes. avoiding war is just staying out of it. other countries will fight but we are avoiding it. Establishing peace is when no one is fighting and the world is awesome

For example, are you or have you taken any honors courses? What is your class rank? When you graduate, will you exceed the minimum course requirements?<br>  <br>  Based on your GPA and predicted ACT score alone, I'd say your chance is rough for Ohio State.<br>  <br>  Here's what works for you now:<br>  -your father and grandfather are both alumni.<br>  -your high school is very selective<br>  -your extracurriculars<br>  -letters of recommendation from your golf coach, etc.<br>  <br>  Here's what you need to improve on or take into consideration:<br>  - Your GPA isn't bad, but it depends on if you're taking honors classes or not and whether or not it's weighted. Work on improving that if you can, and taking honors classes if you aren't already.<br>  -Your [predicted] ACT score. 89% of the current class at Ohio State scored a 24 or higher (72% => 26+, 27% => 30+). If you get a tutor or take a class, that should help you to raise your score.  On the PLAN test, I was predicted to get between a 24 and 28 on the ACT. I took a prep class my junior year, and got a 31. <br>  -Class rank. I don't know what yours is, but 91% of the current class ranked in the top quarter of their high school class (57% in the top 10% of their high school class). If you don't fit into that range, but do good in other areas, you might ok. Also, since you go to a competitive high school, they will keep that in mind when considering that. I was only in the top 33% of my class, but was admitted to OSU.<br>  -The admission requirements. "98% of admitted applicants exceeded minimums in social sciences, 97% exceeded minimums in math and natural science, [&} 90% exceeded the minimum in a foreign language", according to OSU admissions. <br>  <br>  If you work hard to improve your GPA and ACT score, you do have a chance to get in. Since you are only a sophomore, you have plenty of time to improve. <br>  <br>  Also, I can't tell you about any of the other schools except for Illinois, and it is pretty similar to OSU except even more competitive, mainly in terms of the ACT. <br>  <br>  Check out my sources for more specific information (mainly the first link).<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|bzkfRcRfaa	your chances aren't too high. even if you have a good essay, and you have a ton of legacy, your standardized test scores need dramatic improvement.

It has its own roots in Irish, Scottish and English traditional music. Bluegrass was inspired by the music of immigrants from the United Kingdom and Ireland (particularly the Scots-Irish immigrants in Appalachia), as well as jazz and blues. In bluegrass, as in jazz, each instrument takes its turn playing the melody and improvising around it, while the others perform accompaniment. This is in contrast to old-time music, in which all instruments play the melody together or one instrument carries the lead throughout while the others provide accompaniment. Traditional bluegrass is typically based around acoustic stringed instruments, such as mandolin, acoustic guitar, banjo, fiddle, and upright bass, with or without vocals.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  But, if the teacher wants you to think like a 5 year old, then maybe he meant actual blue grass lol.<br>  <br>  -<a href="http://i526.photobucket.com/albums/cc348/bixbysoftball_luvr/bluegrass.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i526.photobucket.com/albums/cc348...</a>|`|4gqeQB1naa	i dont know what she was trying to have you find this is all i found on it <br>  Tell her she needs to give you more of a title to look under because there are many bluegrass Music, Towns, airports,weeds, region's, army depot's,television show ,citys . tell her all of this and tell her she need's to tell you rest of riddle or you need to tell answer all of riddle for us to be able to help you more.<br>  Bluegrass<br>  From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br>  Jump to: navigation, search<br>  Bluegrass refers to several species of grasses of the genus Poa (with the most famous being the Kentucky bluegrass)<br>  <br>  The term has also been applied to various things that relate to the region in which the grass grows:<br>  <br>  Bluegrass region, a region of the United States centered in Kentucky <br>  Bluegrass music, a form of American roots music <br>  The Blue Grass Boys, the band led by Bill Monroe that defined the Bluegrass genre. <br>  Bluegrass & Backroads, a television show about people and places in the Bluegrass region <br>  Other uses <br>  Blue Grass, Iowa, a small city <br>  Blue Grass Army Depot in Richmond, Kentucky <br>   This disambiguation page lists articles associated with the same title.

LzqM5XcQaa	Okay there is a great trick to use when your first number is not a one. <br>  Its called Divide and Slide.<br>  <br>  I'll explain on the first and provide answers for the second and third. <br>  <br>  Look at your trinomial and look at the first and last number which are 6 and 4. And say okay 6 times 4 is 24. <br>  <br>  Then think, well there is an 11 in the middle. So what factors of the 24 equal 11. So lets list them: 1 and 24, 2 and 12, 3 and 8, 6 and 4. <br>  <br>  Now, you can see that 8 and 3 are factors of 24 (8x3=24) and they add up to eleven. So put the 8 and 3 in their own parenthesis. <br>  (x + 8)(x + 3) <br>  <br>  Now take your 6 and DIVIDE both the numbers in your parenthesis. <br>  <br>  So it would be 8/6 and 3/6. Now if not dividable REDUCE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. 8/6 becomes 4/3 and 3/6 becomes 1/2. <br>  <br>  Now you have, (x + 4/3)(x + 1/2). That's not to pretty so you can then take the bottom number and make it the number for the x. <br>  <br>  So you end with: (3x + 4)(2x+3) and your done. Makes things easy.<br>  <br>  Summary:<br>  -Find the factors of the two end numbers that add up to the middle. <br>  -Put the numbers in parenthesis and divide by the first number.<br>  -Reduce and divide as much as possible.<br>  -Carry the bottom number if not completely divided to the front. <br>  <br>  Now for the 10x^2 problem:<br>  10x^2 -19x - 15 Factors of 150 that add up to -19. They are 6 and -25.<br>  (x + 6)(x - 25) Now divide by 10.<br>  (x + 6/10)(x - 25/10) Reduce the fractions. <br>  (x + 3/5)(x - 5/2) Carry the bottom number to the front. <br>  (5x + 3)(2x - 5) DONE!<br>  <br>  Last one: <br>  3x^2 - 12x + 12. Here you must take out a GCF!!!!! first. <br>  3(x^2 - 4x + 4) Now this is just a perfect square and the first number is 1. So this can be simplified easier. <br>  3(x - 2)^2 and thats it.|`|0f6f5d458f19b46b409ac467bf6a7e24aa	go to webmath.com it gives you math answers|`|dzJR8Dwvaa	i'm doing this right now in class.<br>  the first one should be 2x(3x+4)<br>  the second one should be (5x+3)(2x-5)<br>  the third one should be (3x-4)(x-3)<br>  <br>  hope i helped !<br>  <br>  hey who is this ?|`|r5k1Gjzaaa	6x2 + 11x + 4<br>  10x2 -19x - 15<br>  3x2 - 12x +12<br>  <br>  What  you want to do here is use a cool method that always works.<br>  Get the product of the coefficient in the first term and the constant in the last term. For instance, for the first expression, you will get 24. Then you can get the middle term and put that aside with the 24. Now, what two numbers add up to 11, and multiply to 24? 8 and 3 do. So, we can re-express this as 6x2 + 8x + 3x + 4. Now with this, we can arrange it so we can factor out some stuff. We can arrange it to 6x2 + 3x + 8x + 4. We can group these as (6x2 + 3x) + (8x + 4). Now factor out like terms from each one: 3x(2x + 1) + 4(2x + 1). We can factor out 2x + 1 from each group to get (2x + 1)(3x + 4). The 3x + 4 is what is left behind.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps~

ipln31mOaa	Yeah am kinda in the same position as you right now. My cheerleadin squad wants to make money aswell.<br>  You could buy like a teddy bear ? then go about the school , charge people ￡1 to guess its birthday, once most of the dates are filled, then the person with the correct birthday wins the bear.! that would be ￡365 if you got all the dates filled in ! Then whatever you pay for the bear, dont pay too much for the bear. Or you'll profits will be lower. Just something that everyone will look at and want to buy.<br>  Another suggestion is a raffle. You can easily buy a raffle book out of any pound shops. Then buy a few things to raffle off. The things dont have to be dear, but at least make them interesting so that people will want to buy more raffle tickets.<br>  Coffee Mornings ? You could make ￡200 pound if you done that ? Just ask some people to do some home baking and buy a few things in. My main tip is asda price ha. No-one needs to know what make of cakes it is!!

zgTsCicNaa	Similar in practice to Vodoun, Santeria centers around the worship<br>  of ancient African gods who have been assimilated as Catholic saints.<br>  Santeria comes from the Spanish word Santo, meaning "saint"; practitioners<br>  are called Santeros (Female: Santeras).<br>  <br>  Like Vodoun, Santeria came to the Americas with the millions of black slaves<br>  from West Africa, principally from the Yoruban tribes along the Niger River.<br>  Forced to convert to Catholicism, the slaves continued their religion in<br>  secret, passing along ancient traditions either orally or in handwritten<br>  notebooks that came to be called libretas. Gradually, the Yorubans began to<br>  see what they believed were the incarnations of their gods in the Catholic<br>  saints and syncretized the two faiths. The slave's Spanish and Portuguese<br>  masters eventually grew fascinated with Yoruban magic and begin to practice<br>  it themselves. Today, any city with a large Hispanic population probably<br>  boasts as many Santeros as devout Catholics, since many of the devotees<br>  practice both. New York, Miami, Los Angeles and the nations of Cuba and<br>  Jamaica all have Santeria strongholds. Brazilians also practice Santeria<br>  but under the name of Candomble, Umbanda, and Quimbanda.<br>  <br>  The orishas -- In the ancient Yoruban tongue, gods were called orishas, and<br>  that is the term still used today. Just like the Vodoun loa, the orishas<br>  have complex human personalities, with strong desires, preferences and<br>  temperaments. When they possess their "children", the devotees assume the<br>  orishas' supernatural characteristics, performing feats of great strength,<br>  eating and drinking huge quantities of food and alocohol and divining the<br>  future with great accuracy.<br>  <br>  Santeros also believe there was a supreme creator of heaven and earth, but<br>  like the Gran Met in Vodoun, he is unapproachable. In the beginning was<br>  Olodumare, a being incomprehensible to mortals, who was composed of three<br>  spirits: Nzame, Olofi (also called Olorun), and Baba Nkwa. Nzame created<br>  all the stars, planets, earth, plant and animal life, then made Omo Oba, a<br>  man, at the suggestion of the other two, to rule over all creation. Such<br>  power went to Omo Oba's head, causing Olodumare to order Nzalam, the<br>  lightning bolt, to destroy the earth in flames. But Omo Oba's immortality<br>  saved him; he hid deep underground, changed his name to Olosi and only<br>  resurfaces to tempt men to break Olodomare's laws -- much like the story of<br>  Lucifer as a fallen angel. Afterward, Oludumare took pity on the scorched<br>  earth, and so Nzame, Olofi and Baba Nkwa again gave it life, this time<br>  creating a mortal man, Obatala. At this second creation, Olofi took over<br>  provenance of earth, and the other two went off to create life elsewhere.<br>  As the first ancestor, Obatala is the father of the gods and the first<br>  orisha.<br>  <br>  Depicted as a white man on horseback, Obatala is associated with all things<br>  white and represents peace and pirty. His wife, Oddudua is a black woman<br>  who is usually shown breastfeeding an infant that represents maternity.<br>  Obatala and Oddundua has two children: A son Aganyu and a daughter Yemaya.<br>  Aganyu and Yemaya married and had a son Orungan, who was so handsome that<br>  Aganyu died of envy. Orungan forced himself incenstuously upon his mother,<br>  a beautiful woman of yellow skin who is the goddess of the moon and<br>  womanhood. She cursed him and he died. Completely overcome with her<br>  sorrows, Yemaya climbed a mountain, where she delivered 14 gods conceived by<br>  Orungan in a single birth and then died. The waters released when her<br>  abdomen burst caused the deluge -- the Flood 00 and the place where she died<br>  beame the holy city of Ile Ife, the same sacred place worshiped in Vodoun.<br>  <br>  Tragic Yemaya remains a popular goddess in Santeria, whose colors are light<br>  blue and white. The 14 deities born to Yemaya include Chango, the god of<br>  fire, thunder and lightning. You, virile and handsom, Chango also governs<br>  the passions. His colors are red and white, and he is one of the most<br>  popular deities in Santeria. his wife, Oba is goddess of the Oba River.<br>  Continally jealous and suspicious of her philandering husband, she follows<br>  him and has him watched.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://interfaithstudies.blogspot.com/2008/02/santeria.html" rel="nofollow">http://interfaithstudies.blogspot.com/20...</a><br>  <br>  ?

zgTsCicNaa	Yager is perhaps more notable for having lost the most weight by natural (non-surgical) means, in the shortest documented time (521 lbs. in three months).[1] While others have registered larger total weight loss, some were assisted by bariatric surgery and/or cosmetic procedures to remove excess tissues, and all were over longer periods of time; 19 months (with surgical assistance) in the case of Guinness' record holder, Michael Hebranko, and 16 months for John Brower Minnoch, (said to be the heaviest man ever recorded). Guinness' female record holder, Rosalie Bradford's weight loss took over 1 year (420 lbs. in the first year), and she underwent at least five surgical sessions to remove tissue during that time.<br>  <br>  When Yager died in 1994 at the age of 34, she weighed about 1200 lbs (544 kg), and was 5' 7" (170 cm) in height. It was reported that she was estimated to be more than 5' wide (152 cm),[2] although this measurement has not been verified by Yager's medical team or family members. Shortly before her death, however, she was able to fit through her custom-built 48" (121 cm) wide front door.[3] Published reports quoted her then-boyfriend as stating that he estimated her peak weight at about 1600 pounds (727kg),[1] but when questioned about this estimate, Yager's doctor declined comment.[1]<br>  <br>  ?

Major in anything (medicine, surgery, and premed are not majors) and take the premed course sequence in bio, chem, physics, math, and English.  Keep your GPA above 3.5 and get a great MCAT score to have a shot at med school.  Then you've got 4 years of medical school.  About 2 years in you have to start specializing - in surgery.  Then you've got 5 years general surgical residency, and then additional residency/fellowship for any specific field of surgery you want.

AA10636233	1. Any covering of your body/head that helps preserve your modesty around others.<br>  2. Any female who has begun puberty, even in its earliest stages. for example, my 9 year old began wearing hijab last year when she began to develop a figure and curves.<br>  3.Until last year, I wore a baseball cap and a bun with my hair tucked inside the hat instead. I personally stopped wearing my hijab scarf in october of 2001. A friend of ours was crossing the street with her baby in a stroller here in texas, and a truck actually sped up and tried to run her over just because she was Muslim. She broke her ankle when she fell at the curb, but she and the baby were luckily not hit. She wore hijab and abaya, but she stopped to help protect her family. I only began wearing it again in the last year as an example to my then 8 year old daughter. I believe there are enough negative examples in any modern media, she needs positive examples to teach her that what is popular is usually not what is right and good.<br>  4. Yes I do.<br>  5. To help women and men alike understand that the outside is not as important as what is inside a woman, and to remind us to keep our minds only on what is appropriate and good.<br>  6.I believe it is a daily physical and visual reminder to keep our minds and eyes always looking for only what is meant for us. It is a reminder for men to respect women, and not hold them of so little value that they begin taking liberties they have no right to take. It is a reminder to women to respect themselves and hold themselves more valuable than most modern women do.  It is a tangible reminder when disrobing, that makes us ask ourselves are we doing as Allah would have us do, or will our acts shame us.<br>  7. Yes, and there are many more than those indicated in the Qua'aran! I find new ones everyday.<br>  8. Most of the time it is easy, but when I first began it was somewhat difficult. Now, they make the simple pull on 2 piece designs that my daughter can use easily. Recently it has become a little difficult because my youngest daughter is mentally challenged, and she tends to "help" me by pulling it loose on a regular basis because she likes to feel fabric sliding across her face lol!<br>  9. I beleive they should choose to wear hijab, but more and more Muslimah's are choosing to forgo the act.<br>  10.While I believe it is mandatory, I do not beleive it should be forced. If a young lady had had it explained to her poorly, then she is unlikely to want to wear hijab. Once they understand its benefits and positive effects on others, they will usually begin to wear hijab on their own. My daughter was quite negative about it because Texas gets so hot that it is often uncomfotable. Once I explained to her the same things I have to you, she was more willing. I pointed out examples in modern media of young women with no self-respect or modesty. I then asked her if she wanted to be treated like them and valued like they were. She now understands, and actually voluntarily avoids those young women who are inappropriate role models for herself and other young girls. <br>  11. I think one of the things that makes it appealing to many girls is the fact that no one will know if they are having a bad hair day lol!  I like that my husband enjoys my hair, and that It is a special gift that I share only with him. I like knowing that if a man is looking at me, I do not have to fear that he is "checking out" my physical attributes. It makes me feel much more comfortable when around large groups of strangers. I like that it is like a physical buffer between myself and others around me. Sort of like a do not touch sign. I hear women who say that my hijab is like a leash that my husband keeps me on. It is not, it is more of a mental restraint that I choose to wear to remind me to consider all of my choices as a make them and actions as I perform them. Kinda like that Jimminy Cricket in my ear, but not lol! Many of my neices have chosen not to wear hijab as they have come of age, and I asked them why. Not in a mean way like I am trying to control them, but just to find out their reasoning and help me understand them better. They pull out the same lines they hear in the news, or read in the newspapers. I am glad that I taught my daughter well enought that she understands its purpose and benefits.
e9d02e2d1da08594b6fa1b034ef8efbdaa	since it was already processed, you can know if you're getting a lot of money or a little bit. This is determined by EFC number found on an SAR (student aid report) form which you can find on the FAFSA website. Normally, the lower this number is, the more money you'll likely receive.<br>  <br>  once the schools receive the financial aid forms, they'll determine how much money you can receive. This usually takes time, so it's different from school to school. You can call the financial aid office for the schools you want and ask them if they have processed your financial aid and how much money they'll give u, or if not, how long it would take to process it.<br>  <br>  if you don't want to call them, once you officially enroll in the school, they'll send you an offer form, containing the grants and loans you can receive.|`|RMGp8NB9aa	collegefinder.fateback.com - try this site.

UT5HS39Daa	I would go for Law and Justice.  There are not many things you can do with a psychology degree unless you plan on going to graduate school, and becoming a doctor.  Law and justice, there may be a few more options.  Any major that you go into in college has much research and much writing.  I went into nursing, and I am working on my master's right now, and I can not tell you how much research I do daily, and how much writing.  It's Crazy.  When you get out of school, any profession also has research and writing, even teachers have to research what they are teaching and look into it more than what their curriculum provides.  If you haven't began college yet, you have a while before you really have to decide.  So maybe have a year or so to figure out on your own what you want to do, and just take the basic classes that all majors require.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!|`|kTONNNHvaa	Don't do psychology unless you want to take the time to get your doctorate.  A masters would work, but a doctorate has more promise.  And even then, your job options are pretty much to become a psychologist, or to teach psychology at a university.  So unless teaching or listening to people's problems all day, then I would recommend going with law and justice.

It was quite easy compared to yours!<br>  <br>  The best approach I think you should take would be to choose 3-4 main points to focus your presentation on (a bit like choosing 3-4 sub-headings). You could easily twist them to link to the title of your presentation e.g. I aspire to be a teacher who is fair and firm in the classroom....I would do this by..... (and then tell them how you would go about using positive behaviour management) <br>  <br>  Your talking points could be:<br>  behaviour management (As mentioned)<br>  teaching varied and interesting lessons including differentiation<br>  Every Child Matters<br>  Marking and feedback<br>  SEN<br>  talk about what you'd have in your classroom to stimulate learning<br>  the importance of using supporting adults effectively<br>  importance of school trips, outside speakers, wow factors etc<br>  rewards and consequences<br>  <br>  ......and there's tonnes more!<br>  <br>  For the presentation, don't do death by PowerPoint- if you do use it, try to just use it to make main points (which can also act as reminders for what you have to say!) My interviewers also liked some examples of resources (I had a copy of a behaviour chart I'd used). Make eye contact during your presentation, and don't go over the time limit or you get marked down.<br>  <br>  I'm sure I could add more, but I'm exhausted and am going to bed-and seriously, make sure teaching is what you want to do. I've been doing it for 4 and a half years and have just handed in my notice because I can't cope with the workload any more! I thought teaching was for me, but have been struggling on for the last 4 years with no slowing down in sight! But good luck if it's really what you want to do :)

WJXzna8xaa	There is nothing else for it ......Practise, practise, practise.<br>  <br>  Get a simple spelling book from your local bookshop and go through it every day until you have mastered it. Then get the next grade up.<br>  <br>  You could also take the newspaper and spell out each word of a news item.<br>  <br>  When someone says an interesting word, spell it to yourself and then check your spelling with a dictionary.<br>  <br>  Practise....practise...practise.   Good luck|`|3OoCiOkAaa	I use old address books and write down words that I can't spell <br>  ( obviously I find the correct spelling before I write them down).<br>  <br>  I also write the definition of the word.  If I go any where and I am waiting I take the spelling book with me and practice there. <br>  <br>   For instance under my A's I have <br>  <br>  Abase<br>  Acrimonious<br>  Altruism<br>  Accede<br>  Accoutrements<br>  <br>  <br>  D's I have<br>  <br>  Disappear<br>  Disappoint<br>  Disapprove<br>  Demigod<br>  Defenestrate<br>  Defamation.<br>  <br>  <br>  If I hear a word I don't know I write it in pencil under the correct section and once I find the correct spelling . I write it in pen with the definition.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I have a big address book for home use and a small one which I carry with me.<br>  <br>  <br>  I am dyslexia so I need a dictionary and thesaurus. I have them in big text as it is easier for me to see.<br>  <br>  <br>  I write my words in fairly large type as well.<br>  <br>  <br>  This is my best tip - write the words down  that are problematic and learn their meanings .  I always struggle with  "dis" prefix words, but they have become easier since doing this. Never try to guess words and as you will remember the incorrect word and you will find it difficult to remove this mistake from your mind.<br>  <br>  <br>  So they key is to check using a dictionary or spell check. I have Encarta dictionary on my tool bar and the word web dictionary on my tool bar. Which means I always have access to an electronic dictionary.<br>  <br>  <br>  If your spelling is the only thing that is bad it might just be practice that you need, but if your writing is bad and you cannot see your spelling mistakes it could be dyslexia.

BqWweobDaa	There are multiple programs to choose from. One that I personally would recommend would be Rotary Youth Exchange. It's not very expensive you just have to pay for the plane tickets and the application fee. Although it is cheaper than other programs, it is also highly selective. You can go for a full year, or their short term exchange which I don't know much about. I would start with talking to your school counselor, or do some research on your own. <br>  www.rotary.org can provide you with more information. <br>  Hope I helped!

CAuU6M0oaa	The only reason animal testing has played a part in medical progress is because it is mandated by law that products be tested on animals before being tested on humans.<br>  <br>  Animal testing is wrong for several reasons.<br>  <br>  1. It is misleading. Cures are often dismissed that could help humans because they don't work in other animals. Many things make it to the market that were proven "safe" in animals yet killed or sickened humans. Thalidomide is a good example of this. Tylenol, advil, aspirin, penicillin, and other medications all proved deadly and/or worthless in nonhuman animals but are used in human still today. Animals are not good predictors of human response to disease and/or treatment.<br>  <br>  2. It is cruel. If what scientists do to animals in most labs was done by someone outside of a lab, that person would go to jail for years. Animals are given surgeries, imprisoned, caused pain, and so forth. Most of the animals used (rats and mice) are not even covered by the already thin coverage of the animal welfare act. You can do anything to a rat or mouse regardless of how painful.<br>  <br>  3. It is unnecessary. There are plenty of alternatives that offer much more applicable results to humans. These include but are not limited to in vitro research, mathematical models, epidemiology, clinical studies, and prevention research and promotion.|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	90% of medical progress would stop if we had to stop animal testing.  Animal testing has almost certainly saved your life at some point, as it has almost everyone - from vaccines against diseases that used to kill off half of kids before age 10, to treatments for diabetes and cancer, antibiotics, surgical methods, and pretty much every prescription drug ever.  What's worth more, a rat or a human?  Animal testing is absolutely necessary.|`|7o3DMzXQaa	necessary evil... but i do believe there is a point where it should not be tolerated<br>  <br>  patricia - if one of your family members contracts a life threatening disease i bet you'd sing to a different tune<br>  <br>  eri - thank you|`|ZHm0807kaa	i think its wrong because the conditions that the animals are kept in is inhumane and they go through much unnessecary suffering.<br>  i say unnessecary because there are now other methods that are more accurate than animal testing and can show responses that are more like human ones.<br>  for example there are some medicines on the market that could kill animals but are perfectly harmless to humans :)|`|jauVVrzTaa	Totally wrong. You may as well test a house brick for all the similarities there are between other species and ourselves. What`s great treatment in a rat/cat/dog is just that - for them.

For example.<br>  <br>  "Hey I just got a PS3"<br>  "rofl" <br>  <br>  If you are chatting with someone on MSN and they say lol or rolf or lmoa a lot then it probably means that they are uninterested in the conversation and have nothing to add to it. However if you are just reading message boards and people say lol it usually means that they actually found something funny. This is because on message boards the reader has no obligation to reply to threads, so if they take the effort to post lol or rofl then it probably means that they found something humerus. In MSN (personal chat) the person on the receiving end of a message usually feels obligated to send a message back.

Save the misses you are allowed until you are leaving to go to something good, like a weekend away.  Think of the next bit of time as an investment in making next week's studying easier.  Then, attend class and head home feeling really victorious that you are ahead and can have even less stressful a weekend!|`|NWwGl4k6aa	if you have a spaceship, i would<br>  <br>  EDIT:  oh....you said university.  my bad<br>  <br>  EDIT EDIT:   ^ she's hot<br>  <br>  EDIT EDIT EDIT:  AdamJ - i  gave you that thumbs up.  anybody that tells me i am right will always get a thumbs up from me.|`|YTIDE8Evaa	flip a coin . if it's tails stay if heads go do something more productive (like watching porn while asking questions on yahoo)|`|heXiCKepaa	skip it|`|3FerQ9Ehaa	Missing class for no reason is for losers.

1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	You have to pick a major.  Some schools offer a 'general studies' major but that's not useful when it comes to finding a job.  Premed isn't a major, it's a course sequence to prepare someone for medical school.  You can take classes in anything you want, but you might want to be thinking ahead to what you want to do with your degree, or what you want to get out of your degree.|`|V8GrFx0jaa	If you want a job after college, you really need to narrow it down. Most careers want you to have a specialized course of study to compete with others who want the job. There's no reason to give up your other interests, you can have two majors, or minor in them, or just keep them as hobbies.|`|tQMfV2txaa	At some point, you will have to pick a major, but the amount of electives you are allowed varies wildly form school to school. Say you go to Brown University, and their major requirements account for maybe 2 courses a semester--you still have up to 3 classes left to take whatever you want. Other majors/schools require much higher courseloads in a specific field of study.<br>  <br>  Look for a liberal arts school that emphasizes being "well rounded"--like you!<br>  <br>  My favorite college search engine is <a href="http://www.campuscompare.com/college/search" rel="nofollow">http://www.campuscompare.com/college/sea...</a> because it allows you to search by major, and it has the most info on admissions and requirements for each school. Do a little search, and see what pops up!|`|wlO6zFHNaa	sounds like you don't really know what you want and if you keep doing this while in college just go for communications it's an easier degree and allows you to do what you are doing requiring only a few core classes.
B4kf9jDGaa	have someone always be with you, and making sure you do the stuf fyou need to do, set timers and always have everything ready for you and push yourself, make yourself do it|`|9Ute4yidaa	Make a check list of what you have to do that day and check everything off before you do your fun stuff. Like if you get it complete before 3pm buy urself a starbucks coffee or something! (just do that the first week) then after that just keep checking the list off. :)<br>  E-mail or Ask me if you have any more questions!<br>  Good luck!!  :D<br>  Best answer plz?????|`|SDppbbFNaa	The best way to discipline yourself is to offer yourself a reward for every time you do what your supposed to do. Also, in the studying department, find something that you actually like to study. That should help a lot. You should take some 5 minute breaks and do something fun between your study/work time. It will help you concentrate more. <br>  <br>  Hope this helped!
Q7lvSU03aa	Why not try volunteering?  It is so easy for students to get focused on themselves.  Find something you care about and donate time.  Maybe help at an animal shelter, food bank, or even a homeless shelter.  Not only is this a great experience, but it engenders compassion and benevolence.  <br>  <br>  Make a difference!|`|DB2hVNImaa	Have FUN !!!! that's what im doing :) And obviously catch up with anything they still need to do and review the more complicated stuff/subjects. there needs to be a balance of play time and work time. and bit more play time during holidays !!!!  <br>  good luck :D|`|XUD9AfERaa	kick back relax and definitely do not study. Just a day to spend relaxing, go to the beach and soak up some sun|`|t4DP30r6aa	Have fun, enjoy life. Catch up on studying if you absolutely must..|`|QVupDcqoaa	I feel students should have fun with their family. We just don't spend enough time with our children anymore. Sit down and play some educational games with them.|`|xyu08IxBaa	Find a library near you and get them to read a book or two...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldcat.org/</a>|`|2646a4e9d6d4e936660d70ff922397f3aa	It very much depends on the student.  Some need to catch up on their studies.  Others just need to get back on a regular schedule, sleep enough hours, and eat healthy food for a while.  Still others may go somewhere enjoyable with friends or family.|`|1yGDFTieaa	A few hours a day should be spent revising and/or going over work they struggled with during the term.<br>  <br>  However, I do believe that most students work very hard during the school term and should therefore spend a few days just relaxing, watching TV, socialising with friends, etc, without needing to worry about completing a lot of homework or assignments.
9f7c8164ca2d49e24413295051f36abaaa	As a teacher who has taught at both public and private schools (currently teaching at a private Catholic school) all teachers and schools would like to help their students succeed. If I were you I would contact the teacher and set up a meeting/conference with them to speak to them about your child's grade. Ask the teacher what s/he has observed in class and to why your child's grade is dropping. After hearing the teacher's observations ask your child (during the conference) his/her point of view. Then, set up a plan with the teacher. Ask the teacher to call you once a week on a specific day to let you know how your child performed that week and if they are missing any work. <br>  <br>  Currently, I have three children that their parents were not happy with the grade. I call those parents on a specific day once a week and let the parent know if the child completed their work that week and if the child was missing anything or behind in their work. This regular update works so well the children know I will call their parents and so complete their work and do not slack off like before. If I see them not doing work in class I remind them 'Thursday is my call day." and then they complete their work.|`|AA10392637	In the state of WI. the school will not intervene unless a parent makes a request for help for the student.  Do you think your 6th grader is not capable of doing the work?  Does your child have other issues going on in his/her life at the present time that might be interfering with the schoolwork?  Is it possible your 6th grader has learning disability problems I will give you a website source so you can read about them.<br>  If you think your child has LD problems make a written request for an evaluation.  In WI. this would be done at a public school for free, and then if the student does have problems an IEP would be drawn up.  The school would be responsible to implement the IEP which you have input check the website I am providing so you are aware of your rights.  If you think your child needs counseling please get it for him/her.  One other thing is you might see if the teacher would be willing to offer extra help to your child or maybe hook him up with a peer tutor.|`|QRrURcQDaa	The easiest thing to do is have a tutor. He/she can help you child in her subjects. The school could possibly have an after school program that helps students with their home work.

WyCmQBuvaa	I would send them a short thank you note, but not a certificate. When you pass the bar and are making the big bucks, then send them the certificate.  <br>  <br>  That is very thoughtful  of you.|`|298865cd9302e6c3b9f7e1e85844a845aa	I agree with the above poster. It's completely appropriate to send a thank-you note, but a little weird to send a gift certificate at this point. If it were a little trinket of some kind - tiny box of chocolate, for example (i.e., something worth about $3.00) - that would be fine. But anything more than a trifle would be weird, in my opinion. I wouldn't make too big of a deal out of it since they probably write letters of rec for students on a weekly basis.|`|T8DThYKHaa	Since they have already written the letters, it is not a bribe, just a nice idea.

1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	Yes, you can use those credit towards another degree, but many schools won't admit someone to a bachelors program who has a bachelors already in something else - you should be considering a masters instead.|`|wlO6zFHNaa	yes. If you stay in the same college but if you decide to attend another university you will have to get your transcripts evaluated and the course description is going to have to be the same to transfer over.
gb9REJN4aa	These designations are often used interchangeably, so probably they're just being inconsistent. However, there are some differences in the shades of meaning. Consider the following two sentences:<br>  <br>  He lived in West Virginia.<br>  He lived in Western Virginia.<br>  <br>  The first sentence means that the man lived in the American state of West Virginia. The second means that the man lived in the American state of Virginia, in the western part of that state.<br>  <br>  That, pretty much, is what the difference comes down to. "South," "southeast" "north," etc, are usually used with a "harder" meaning than "southern," "northeastern," and "northern." Southeast Europe could refer to a specific region, while South-Eastern Europe is more fluid, like a cultural region or a region that isn't very well-defined. As I say, these kinds of designations are often used interchangeably, so it probably gives you more of an insight into the state of mind of the writers than it does any kind of clear distinction between areas. When they use "Southeast Europe," they are thinking of some region that is relatively definable and different from, say, Northern Europe. When they say "South-Eastern Europe," they are at that moment thinking of a less definable area whose borders are harder to draw into a map. "Southeast Europe" is a region; "South-Eastern Europe" is a part of a region, and the region it is part of is Europe.<br>  <br>  Either could be correct, depending on what the authors mean. At any rate, barring a few examples like the Virginia one above, the difference is usually just one of tone.|`|T8DThYKHaa	There are many grammatical errors in journalism, and they are increasing. East Europe is not correct. Eastern is an adjective describing Europe. A place called East Europe does not exist and southeast Europe does not exist as a place name either so both are incorrect grammatically. North and South America would not be technically correct, and neither would South Australia except that they exist as place names and the North and South words are part of their names, as can be seen by the upper case letters, and not adjectives describing their locations. Because of this, the English grammar rules are not violated.
