You're in a tough position right now, and your reaction isn't all that uncommon.  You know what you need to do, take a deep breath and do it.  Go get help.  Everyone will understand.    Good luck.

I did this for my daughter and she framed it nad put it in her room. The cost is under $40!    Tickets to a game of his favorite sports team.      Host a Poker Night for him and his buddies (not on V-Tine's day though).      Fly him home for the weekend or fly a friend in to see him.     Cook dinner in the nude    make a Calendar with some of your pictures together and include a few more (provactive) ones of you.    Just remember that most men love sex, gambling, sports & food.    Good Luck|`|Nl64RmRWaa	4 years is a long time! Congrats with that!    Try doing something special, like making a scrapbook or collage. You could also try doing the 365 reasons why I love you idea. All come from the heart and would make perfect gifts.    You could bake him goodies. A heart-shaped cake, cookies, or cupcakes would be very fun! You could frost and decorate them in a Valentine's Day theme. They would turn out cute, and we all know men love to eat! You could also buy fresh strawberries and dip them in chocolate, then shove em in the fridge. They are delicious and romantic!    If you live together, or have private time, AND are sexually active... You could plan a very special day. Make him his favorite dinner, light candles, have a romantic bath together... Even add some rose petals on the bed! That would make for a lovely night!    Have a happy Valentine's Day!|`|tnMIzdeBaa	Hi!

N73oZyY8aa	I know, it's nuts. It's like,...."I'm imagining that guy having sex, and he don't do it right so he's my enemy and I hate him" mentality.    First off, what are they doing imaging other having sex anyway? That's sicko psycho. "Oh, that's Fred and Mary. Fred got shot in the war. He can't have normal sex so he has oral sex with his wife, and even though it's a sin in the Bible we can forget about it because Fred used to have sex the right way but can't since he gave his testicles for Jesus and America"    But them homos are enemies of Jesus and America so they're my enemy too, because they don't have sex the right way according to the story I'm telling myself in my head because I'm conservative, I love Jesus and America, and good old crotchity Fred with no testicles but he's a good guy all a cuz he used to have normal sex like Jesus told us to.|`|vJqPsEsWaa	Because they're brainwashed ignorants who can't see farther than their noses!|`|hyYWX82Eaa	Because it's easier to get angry and squicked out by a kind of sex that they don't find up their alley than at the thought of two people dating, doing the grocery shopping, reading to eachother etc. That's my guess at least.

There's also a lot that feel that it's 'unnatural' and you can only have feelings towards the opposite sex, anything else is just to get off.    Hopefully one day they'll come to realise the error of their ways and accept that same sex relationships can have all the same feelings involved as heterosexual ones.|`|VvT7Srlsaa	Because people would think they're stupid if they hate us for doing what everyone else does so they make us look different. It's easier to discriminate that way.|`|fdkegbwgaa	Because that is what they think a relationship is all about unfortunately.|`|7sO3tfSIaa	Well Reef said it best but I'll throw in my 2 cents.  Bible thumping conservatives will NEVER be able to get past the fact that our "sexuality" isn't about SEX.  It's about love, plain and simple.  And they've taken unfortunate stereotypes as the rule rather than the exception about some gay people as their basis for truth.  Sad but true.|`|WvzS59FKaa	First let me clear things SEX really means gender Man and Woman.      Intercourse is not a product of love but an act of the renewal of vows between a man and a woman in marriage and the fruit is that of a child.  God made a woman in a form that reciprocates and a man in a form that gives.     If you say that sex is a product of love then why can other people have intercourse with people they don't even know or don't love?    Marriage is a sacrament and the act of intercourse is the renewal of their vows which God has created.    Real conservatives don't think that feelings of lesbians and gays are carnal and it does not mean they condemn the person themselves.  Conservatives condemn the sin but NOT the sinner.      They just feel that the act of intercourse between same gender in the eyes of God is not how God intends romantic relationships to be.    There are conservatives in this world because someway of the other, they just fight for God's rights in the lives of people for the good of souls.    LOVE is being selfless for the good of others which goes beyond eternity in the eyes of God.  And the one that truly loves will not only look for what is best at the present moment but that of tomorrow even beyond death. Real love leads to Goodness, Truth, and peace of mind.    Follow up answer from question:  That is the reason why intercourse should only be in the bounds of marriage, because marriage opens up to forming a family which should be bounded by love and commitment. and trust in God  There is a great reason why seeds of sperm comes out of the giver and is received by the woman. For procreation.     When there is love from man and woman, and when they do the act of their vows freely and worthily there is a possibility of the fruit called a child.|`|R9p0rbg0aa	Because that's what they feel.

Then you need to repent, ask forgiveness and don't ever steal again.**|`|WNWKDw4uaa	If you needed the money that badly, why didn't you ask your Grandma instead of acting like a thug and stealing it out of her purse?  What did you need it for?  Life-saving medication?  Were you starving to death?  My guess is you "needed" it for something trivial.  You'd better start off by paying it back, begging her forgiveness and then going to confession.|`|tx4bRDrXaa	Matthew 6:33 Keep on seeking the Kingdom first and all these other things will be added to you.

Going over some of his roles, I started to realize an interesting thing.  Out of all the films my friend listed (she is a Matthew McConaughey fan), I had never seen a single one of them.      I consider myself something of a film fan, and I thought it was pretty weird that there was this allegedly big time actor dude who I had never actually seen in a movie.    Then, a few months ago, Contact was on TV and I realized Matthew McConaughey was in it.  So there was in fact at least one movie I had seen that had Matthew McConaughey in it.

PvPPivLJaa	I personally think death metal sounds like demons mating and listening to it for extensive periods has made me want to hurt small helpless animals (just kidding about that part)    But that genre (death metal, black metal and all the other types of extremely dark borderline satanic-sounding music) is not really music to me. It not melodic. You can barely understand what they are saying, if, in fact, they are saying anything, and the riffs sound like something out of a nightmare.    But I don't judge anyone who listens to it, and, there is some good metal out there, but death metal and the like is not my thing.|`|96AQZUGyaa	I've come to realize that those who hate metal think its:    a) Satanic.    b) Just noise.

That doesn't make what He tells us any less valid than what He's told someone else.    Miracles, signs and wonders are to follow the Believers.....if a sign it at odds with Scripture, then it was NOT a sign from God. What is of God's will for His children will always line up with the Word of God.    Numbers 23:19 God is no mere human! He doesn't tell lies or change his mind. God always keeps his promises.     Titus 1:2 Then they will have the hope of eternal life that God promised long ago. And God never tells a lie!

uFyycbjiaa	Just to clear up a common misconception people have:    As Jews, we don't keep Torah and commandments to be "saved" or gain righteousness.  We do it because G-d said so, and that's it.    Shabat is an eternal Covenant between G-d and His people.|`|DiIAaFgzaa	Faith without works is dead.  Those who truly have faith in God can demonstrate their faith by their works.  Those who have faith in Him will be obedient to all of His commands as they are relevant today.  The Sabbath was established at the end of creation and is a perpetual covenant between God and His people.  It is still relevant today.  The laws of sacrifice were completed by Jesus Christ and His death on the cross.  So while we no longer have to give sacrifices for our sins, we are still called to be obedient to the rest of the law.|`|pSCHJJ7raa	Keeping the Sabbath will save no one. The Sabbath is a gift to mankind. It is a memorial of creation. We keep the Sabbath or obey any of His commands because we love Him. Faith is believing He will do as He has promised.  Another way of saying righteousness is justification. Justification has two sides. First when we accept the sacrifice of Jesus as our savior it is just-if-ied never sinned. The second side of justification is what do you do with that gift? It is like Jesus told the woman caught in adultery to go and sin no more. When you are saved you will act like it not to get to Heaven, but because you are going.|`|bUWWeT0Xaa	The Sabbath is a test of who God's people are as the 4th Commandment is the only Commandment that starts with the word Remember and contains the Seal of God.  Faith is often required to keep the Sabbath properly.  The Sabbath was first introduced in Eden when God Scantified it, and rested.  It did not change to Sunday with the reseraction of Jesus.  No where at all in the New Testament does it at all say "the Sabbath was changed from Saturday to Sunday."|`|aW7hFbuaaa	Acts 15:19 Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God:   20 But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood.     Gal 4:21 Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?   22 For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.   23 But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman was by promise.   24 Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar.   25 For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.   26 But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.|`|RC5RAzykaa	Romans 4:3  For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.     Abraham BELIEVED God!  He had faith in God!  What is faith?    Hebrew 11:1 Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.     To believe in God without "evidence" that is viewable is faith.    The Sabbath was one of the Ten Commandments WRITTEN BY GOD!  To believe that they are true is to believe God.  To believe God is Faith, and is accounted as righteousness.    I particularly like the Jewish mans answer above me,  as a Christian I agree with him.    We keep the Sabbath because it is an eternal covenant between God and his people.     We keep it because God said to, and we love God.    The Word of God   Deuteronomy 11:22  For if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which I command you, to do them, to love the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cleave unto him;     Or if you prefer the Words of Jesus, who is God as well  John 15:10  If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.     John 14:15 If ye love me, keep my commandments.       The most direct scripture I can think of follows:  2nd John 1:6  And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it.     THAT WHICH YE HAVE HEARD FROM THE BEGINNING,  THE TEN COMMANDMENTS!   INCLUDING THE HOLY SABBATH!    The Holy Sabbath starts at sundown Friday and ends sundown Saturday.  This has been, and forever will be the case.    God Bless you.|`|mSFjbetxaa	Both are asinine religious nonsense.|`|ef4edd8f1c0d16fab298d474bf08b339aa	Jesus. He is our righteousness (connected to by faith which is trust), and he is our rest (Sabbath). The Sabbath was fulfilled in Christ (Colossians 2).|`|AA10471892	Seeing as the apostle Paul declared that the law is not of faith, and whatever is not of faith is sin, believing you have to keep any point of the old covenant law, such as the sabbath, violates faith and is a sin for a Christian.

Miguel Ruiz, the author of "The Four Agreements", states that sin is any action that is against oneself.      Lying (or bearing false witness) is an action that can lead to hurtful consequences for oneself and for others.  By that definition, then....  Yes, it is a sin.|`|AA11703455	Slight difference.    I will give you an example.     You were playing in the living room and you broke the TV.     Mom asks "Who broke the TV?" You answer "I don't know" - a lie.    Mom asks "Who broke the TV?" You answer "My brother did" - a false witness.    Under the law, the punishment that a false witness trys to get someone convicted of, was libel for that same punishment. So, in a capital case, where death would be the result, you don't go to jail, you die, since that is what you were trying to bring on another person.

Please.|`|AA11521494	If that's what's going on, I'd strongly advise against it unless you know exactly what you are doing.|`|6OvG1mn8aa	You can provoke a spirit by pretty much insulting the air. If there is someone in the room with you they can knock things over. Another thing you can do is ask if they can do something and if it happens ask again about 3 more times so you know that it wasn't someone else moving in the house. :]  I hope that helps you.

I prefer to stay with reality.

The fact that they don't exist, in that sense, gives me comfort.    I would love it if a truly generous and benevolent God existed, one who had some real solutions to humanity's problems. So, no, I don't gain any comfort in the non-existence of God as a concept per se, just the non-existence of the many vicious Gods of mythology.|`|zXkQhQitaa	So what if believing in God makes you more comfortable?

WlK3KaVtaa	The book called "The King's Secret" By Derek Joseph Levendusky    "The King's Secret" is going to print in mid-February 2009! Im so pumped about this book! You can get your copy at www.amanirecords.com as soon as it's available. It'll also be available on www.amazon.com.    This book is about a young bitter orphan girl named Jane of Aldengate whose life is transformed by a series of events that occur in the Land of Aletheia. The story is really a long parable about the love of God, the sacrifice of Christ, and the transforming power of the gospel. He wrote the book to help young people understand the truths of God's grace, who they are in Christ, and how truth can transform. He especially envisions this book being useful for parents to read to their children (ages 8-12). It has discussion questions at the end of every chapter to help drive home the lessons. Read the book and learn the kings secret!!    Stay tuned! It'll be ready soon!    The following is an excerpt from his book Enoch Walked With God, published in 2005 by Elim Publishing. He's received dozens of testimonies about this book since he first published it. It's the story of his journey through the valley of depression, and the truths he discovered there that set my soul free.    "On and on the season went. Black clouds settled over my life for so long that I despaired of being alive. I was failing as a husband, a father, and a minister of the Gospel. I prayed more than once for God to take my life. I hated my life. I hated myself, and I didn't like God any more.       My religion had done nothing for me. It left me empty and helpless. All the things I'd done previously in ministry gave me no special access to God. All the disciplinesthe fasting, the praying, the Bible studies, the evangelizingdid not impress God enough to earn me my freedom.       `O wretched man that I am!' I cried, like Paul the Apostle, from the bottom of my valley. `Who will deliver me from this body of death?' (Romans 7:24)       I was crushed in spirit, at the end of myself, exhausted from the battle, and there, I looked up, and saw the answer as Paul did in Romans 7:25: `I thank Godthrough Jesus Christ our Lord!'      I told God, `I've tried everything! I've exhausted every spiritual resource I have, and I've got nothing left to do!'      `What do you have left?' the Lord asked me. (As many well know, when the Lord asks a question, He already knows the answerHe just wants YOU to know the answer.)       `Nothing!' I complained.       `Nothing?'     `Well' I thought, `just You. Just the hope that You might sovereignly do something to fix methat You'd do something not because of me, but in spite of me.'       `Yes, my son,' His voice tenderly whispered, `that's exactly why I brought you herethat you might learn my grace.'"|`|RoqxGbgRaa	i haven't read it yet, but someone gave me a book called hinds' feet on high places.  it's an allegory.  the main character is called much-afraid.  much-afraid has to learn how to rely on God to confront her fears and problems.  the person who gave it to me loves it!!|`|vSomavIzaa	get him the devotional book "My Utmost for His Highest" by Oswald Chambers.|`|2f7242b0f96b78ec3ba30b130b28bf6caa	what about a good travel book.. oh wait, i forgot.|`|79uzTFl7aa	Tuesdays with Morrie...|`|Sxlcyua5aa	One Month To Live.   It's a book which has 30 chapters.   You read one chapter a day.   It's based on things you would want to change in your life if you had 30 days to live.   It goes through all areas in ones life.   It shows you why you are going through them.   It tells you what God is doing in your life, and how you can change your life with God by your side.   It explains how you can free your life instead of your life being influenced by things around you.   The book is actually something good to refer back too when one has some issues that they are dealing with.   Hope this helps.
AA10613962	You are pouring out your heart to the Lord for your beloved niece. You are speaking to God from your heart. I will also pray for her!  Just agree with all who have prayed here in prayer. When two or more agree, there is much power in prayer.    Father, we lift this man's niece to You. We know that You are a God who heals and restores. Father, it says in Your Word that the prayer of faith will save the sick, and the Lord will raise him up. We stand on Your Word in faith that this girl will be raised up in good health! We thank You that You are sending the Holy Spirit to comfort this family and wrap Your arms around them. Send them peace that passes all understanding. Joy in knowing that You are walking with them at this time! Thank You that You who raised Jesus from the dead will also give life to her mortal body. Thank You that she will prosper and be in health, even as her soul prospers! We give You glory and praise for what You will do! In Jesus' name.......amen!

This is a question and answer forum.|`|bmhnXEsVaa	Go stand by her hospital bed & simply pray from your heart as you look at her. I assure you, God is listening to your prayers. There is no such thing as a 'wrong' prayer. However, I know that God honors sincerity as well as when we pray for others selflessly. Remember, any love or compassion you feel for her is magnified multiplied times over inside Gods' heart for your niece. He loves her more than you!|`|ef4edd8f1c0d16fab298d474bf08b339aa	In order for you to have peace with God, trusting in the one He sent, Jesus Christ is what you would have to do. That's what Jesus meant when He said, "But first seek the kingdom and these things will be added to you." Once you trust in the one God sent, you are in the Kingdom. With peace established with God, He said He would give you anything you ask. So pray (which is an act of trust (which is synonymous to faith), and trust Him for His will to be done.    John 14  12 "I tell you the truth, anyone who has faith in me will do what I have been doing. He will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father. 13 And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Son may bring glory to the Father. 14 You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it."|`|tx4bRDrXaa	Pray if it be your will (God) to let her be ok.

A few years ago some bacteria got into my blood from having root canal work done on my teeth.  The bacteria destroyed one of my heart valves and I was told that eventually I would need the valve replaced. My breathing became difficult and my heart started to get bigger. Because I was relatively young they wanted to wait as long as possible. I did not think this was right.    I wrote a letter saying I wanted the operation now and that I was aware of the risks but definitely wanted the operation as soon as possible. I sent a copy to my GP; to the heart consultant; and to the surgeon; and to my solicitor.    The operation was done in weeks and I made a full recovery, God willing.    Get your niece to put everything in writing; the NHS has to respond to your letter.    Praying is good but do the practical stuff as well.    I hope everything works out for the best.|`|RC1r1tsHaa	don't believe in god to pray for you..    but my heart goes out to your niece..sorry for the pun|`|LxYel4I6aa	You are doing it just right.

How very narrow minded some people are. There is no right way to pray. Your doing it just fine. God does answer prayers. If he wants her to be here for a while longer she will be. If he needs her to come home, he'll bring her home. He's listening don't worry. I'll pray for her too.|`|7sEFufRbaa	I am sorry to hear about your niece and there is no right or wrong way to pray.    I too will pray for her.        Ignore all the haters, nonbelievers they always get prayers removed.   It is just their ignorance and their so called "tolerance".    They only want all the hate-filled, insults, mocking, etc from their questions/answers to remain.|`|e31499ab54c662a4df8d9ae2be1630f7aa	I think that you need to remember that all thing God does for His glory.  Sometimes God says, "yes," and does what we have asked of Him.  Sometimes God says, "no," and does not do what we have asked of Him.  Sometimes God says, "wait," and does what we have asked of Him in His own timing.  And sometimes says, "you aren't thinking big enough...  Let me blow your mind with the way I am going to answer this prayer."  After all is said and done,  God will get the glory.  I learned that this summer.  I was sitting by my father's grave, he was too young and had a lot more that I wanted him to be here for.  But God had it His way.  And I remember rejoicing over loosing my dad.  Not because he is a Christian and I will see him again or because he is with God, both things I am thankful for, but because God's will is being done on earth.  Praise God.  It is for my best.|`|ZlaxbI33aa	I used to not pray correctly and still sometimes dont. I was told once to make sure you "feel" yourself talking to God.

I will remember your niece in my prayers.|`|Nv3eQenUaa	Just pray with thanks in your heart and belief in your soul.   Trust in God no matter what His will decides on.   It all falls in his good plan which is only revealed to us one piece and one step at a time.   Right now it is easy to see the trial and not the results.    Years from now you will understand more of the why and wherefores and you will be blessed with a little of his wisdom.      ?   Equitable Prayer Warrior   ?|`|PlBYWZ8Saa	Be near to her.

I hope from the deepest part of my heart that she will recover. God Bless her.|`|4Vt20nvoaa	Stop Worrying.  You have to pray with faith and in the name of Jesus Christ and accept whatever happens as God's will.  There are some things that are way beyond our understanding, but God is always in control.  God often uses negative situations to fuel positive ones.  Let Him work through you no matter what happens with your niece and pray that His will be done above all things.  This is easy for me to say b/c I'm not in your shoes, but you have to stay strong in your faith if you expect it to fuel your prayers.  I will pray for you and your family.|`|WdwASGvRaa	Ok you pray however you want to pray dont worry!

It is good to pray the scriptures, God's word. He even asks us to remind Him of this.  Father I pray for complete healing for his niece. I pray that you give Your wisdom to all of the care givers, and for speedy recovery, without complications. I base this on Your word. You say if anyone lacks wisdom, ask.  You also say that Jesus dies for us and by His stripes, we were healed.  So I consider it done. In the Name of Jesus. ?Prayer Warrior At Your Request?
Se0oKtvcaa	Probably because they cant except themselves either.|`|7wqIJbPjaa	i don't believe it is so much that people are close-minded to it because unseen or different, it is more the fact that it conflicts with the dominant religion, Christianity. i think if there wasn't anything in the bible against it, the majority of discrimination towards homosexuality would vanish. As an American it saddens me to live in a country that is said to have separated church and state, but clearly this is not the case, otherwise homosexuals would have the same rights as heterosexuals do. It is wrong to deny love to anyone based upon your own relgious beliefs. if you are a straight christian and believe a woman that has sex with another woman will be condemned to hell, that is your own completely personal opinion and it should stay within your own mind, or at least it should not get involved with the government.  not everyone is against homosexuality.     when it gets down to it, i personally don't see how my sex life effects the straight christians whatsoever, nor anyone else. i dont even see how their sex life effects mine.     does a man and a woman having sex bother you? lets take a vote and see if we should allow straight marriages to continue! |`|WNWKDw4uaa	It's just hard to accept the fact that some people like to put things in their "buttockal areas" where things don't belong.|`|QlCopFqyaa	I think its hard for a lot of close minded people to allow for new idea's that they aren't used to dealing with in everyday life.

jxRooBhUaa	Islam means "surrender" to Allah, may peace be with him.  Muslim is the name of a person who follows Islam.     It's true, some muslims do these bad things. but don't fault ALL muslims. suicide bombers are brainwashed, and some do mistreat women but not just muslims. men from all religions have the right to say women are inferior.     and if you're scared they're going to harm your family, you might as well be scared of everyone else because anyone can do anything bad.     i hope you learned something because people can take this the wrong way and be offended.        EDIT: i know what you're asking, i'm not stupid either. and i did answer some of them. but i feel like you generalize them.   you should not put me on the spot when other people have said basically the same thing i did. you asked questions towards a muslim, and you got an answer from a muslim. don't bite more than you can chew. i'm not trying to belittle you at all, so don't do it to me.|`|bMJ0AYI1aa	i can't wait to hear the answers. muslims in general have a thing where they think all people are supposed to be converted to islam by violence, and that if any muslim every lived anywhere, that place is henceforth muslim land and no one else should live there. that's why non-muslims are persecuted in saudi arabia and other muslim countries, and are segregated.  i'd like to hear someone explain why women are treated so terribly, too.|`|raTZT7e0aa	there are crazy people in every religion. not just Muslims. Kind of like how Christens hate homosexuals. doesn't make seance, but that's religion!|`|gVmt4RKpaa	Ok let me answer your question properly! Its fine that you want to know a little bit more in to the religion, thats the only way people can really be open minded in a society like today! These 'fanatics' are not really 'muslims', they say they are, but their actions dont prove this. They talk about 'jihad' and the fight for freedom etc, but that is simply  them distorting the words of the Koran. Back then fighting for Islam, was like what the christians fought for during the Crusades and when people conquered countries all the time, which basically means that all this talk of 'jihad' is something that was normal in the past but not now...obviously. Given that the koran was written many thousands of years ago, thats why jihad is mentioned.   As for women....totally agree with some of the people here, they are treated unfairly in many middle eastern countries, and its about time they got their rights. However in general the Koran doesnt mention that the female is denied rights...that is something that has been cultivated by a back-ward thinking society.|`|0iTNDPzoaa	You will find extremists in all religions. Look at Hitler, the Crusades, The IRA, RSS groups, tamil tigers to name a few.    As they say one mans terrorism is another mans freedom fighter.    Before 9/11 had you heard of anything about Muslims causing problems where they lived. It all stems from media propaganda.     The media only shows the extreme cases  and want people to cause hysteria amoung people. There are Muslims living everywhere in the world and most are peaceful people carrying on with their day to day life.    I take it you don't know any Muslims and that's where the ignorance lies. People are always afraid of what they don't know and always think the worst. Things made worse by a few nutters on TV. Does this mean if I see a few Christian fundamentals shooting around at non Christians to think all Christians are like this and this is what they stand for?    Of course not as I know this is not to be the case as I am fortunate enough to have Christian friends and friends of other faiths who know me as a person and vice versa and know what my beliefs are and not what they hear from the media.    Just like all religions before and present, those who cause terror do it for control as they want people to see their views as they feel they are doing the right.     How in any religion is killing allowed.    Woman have a high role in society and have the right to own property, be educated, earn her own money and keep it. Islam states that heaven lies under the feet of your mother. After her is again the mother. Thirdly again is the mother. 4th time it is the father. This states how highly a woman is regarded in Islam.    What you will find is that men try to control woman but this is cultural and not Islamic. Just like in Christian faiths the man is seen as the bread winner, the woman washes the dishes, looks after children etc. This is not Christianity, this is stemmed from culture and not a religious obligation.  It is easy to look from an outsiders point of view of negativity and home in on that. This is were hatred lies as people do not go out to educate themselves and be open to their neighbours and surroundings.    We go on holiday and we learn other peoples culture. Most are now going to Egypt, Morocco, Turkey to name a few which are all Muslim countries.    To get to know a religion you have to go to the book as people don't practice the faith the way they are meant to, this includes the other major religions too not just Islam.    A Muslim is the person who pracises the faith like the same for a Christian. Islam is the religion just like Christianity.    Muslims believe in God and in Arabic it's called Allah (not a different God just an Arabic word for the word god). Muslims pray 5 times a day. One of the 5 pillars. The other ones being believing in God, fasting in Ramadan, giving charity and going to the pilgrimage in Makkah.    Muslims also believe in Christianity and Judism. They believe in Jesus but only as a messenger of God. he however is regarded as very special as he was born from the virgin Mary.    Muslims view that Islam is the last message from God from Judiasm to Christianity as the views have been distorted and the messengers were sent again to remind the people how to live their life on Earth.   The last prophet is known as the seal of the prophet. This is the prophet Muhammed.(PBUH) meaning peace be upon him as all of the other prophets.    His message is not diiferent to that of Abraham, Moses, Lot, Job, Jonah, Aron, Jesus etc.      Muslim means to submit yourself to god. So a Muslim is a person who submits themselves to God.    You wil find media speculation more about Islam as Islamophobia is very real. We live in a world where atheism and religion is not important and not a big deal.    Anyone who practices a faith is seen as a bible basher or a fundamentalist etc.    Muslims do not hide the fact they still believe in God and still to this very day practise alot of what the faith teaches. ie. fast, pilgrim, not drinking alcohol, eating halal, praying. You will come across non practising Muslims however their numbers are nothing compared to that of other faiths who practice open atheism.    All religions have to be respected and Islam says their is no compulsion in religion. Your personal relationship with God is only your concern. You will be judged accordingly to your deeds you served on this life.    If someone choses a certain path they are resonsible for their own action. The whole religion and whole community have nothing to do with what the rest are doing in the world.     There are billions of Muslims in the world. Billions and if Muslims were all terrorists that means every millionth of a second Muslim should be on TV with all the atrocities they are causing from China right through to Hawaii.    You don't hear it as most are law abiding citizens which the media like to exagerate the ones who do try to cause problems in the world.|`|TUM8yGsLaa	first of all id like to thank u for writing inthis question and i wish there were more people like who will ask muslims about themselves rather than just go on what u c on tv which is usually manipulated to suit the producers views.  first of all being an extremist in practicing religion is a good thing and i think people use this word too negatively.these people who strap bombs and kill innocent kids they are not extremists as no such killing is justified in islam and so these people are classed as misguided and utterly crazy as killing innocent people has no place in islam.  secondly islam is not a religion but a way of life as we do not use islam just to pray but we practice in by implementing it in our lives by following the practicies of the prophet and following allahs orders.sunnah tells us many things which are all relevant even in todays society such as t from the way we eat our food to the way we treat our neighbours.we have two festivals in a year called eid ul fitr and eid ul adhaa.one is after ramzaan and the other at end of hajj. muslim means submission to allah.    also the quran our holy book hasnt beend altered or changed in its years of existence since being revealed to prophet unlike the bible and the torah book of christians and jews.    women our treated in islam with the utmost respect and care .islam portrays women as gentle and fragile and tht they need to be looked aftered.one of the biggest contributors to islam so us lot can practicie it was the prophets wife aisha r.a who narrated more hadith(teachings and practicies of prophet muhammad pbuh) than any other person.those places that do treat women badly are well yet again nothing to do with islam and yet again the people over there are misguided.in islam we are taught that the key to paradise is under our mothers feet and so how can islam oppress women its the media who relate these stories to us that make it luk that way(its wot u call spin).  hopefully this answers sum of ur questions and if it dont then for further reading go to http://www.inter-islam.org/index.htm and that willl hopefully with allahs will,help answer ur questions and give u a better iinsight into islam.peace..|`|kyfdBu9Aaa	Muslims ARE fanatical. Compare them to christians / catholics  etc.. you'll see that. They are ULTRA sensitive to people who question them like the person above. Muslim men think women are inferior to them. They are just generally backwards. And there is no reason as to why they decide to kill themselves and others apart from the fact that they are brainwashed and have alot of mental issues. I'm not a muslim myself but am from a islamic country so I know somethings.|`|6ZHciEy0aa	To ha: i'm a muslim women/girl and my family doesn't treat me like a slave what u see on tv isn't exactly the truth, the truth is that muslims are hated by alot of people because there are too many of us and we don't force people to convert and u don't know anything bout my religion so shut the **** up u have the right to speak but by making wrong judgements u are upsetting muslims.    to the person who asked this question my faith is not poorly portrayed it is misunderstood and in our religion women are god's gift and their role is to be good muslims and islam means peace(islam is a religion) muslims are the people who follow islam|`|0NXdjyo2aa	Islam  http://www.beautifulislam.net/intro/misc...  http://www.missionislam.com/discover/mis...  http://www.islamicity.com/education/unde...  http://www.islam.com/  http://www.islam-guide.com/|`|XPgvi9KRaa	The fact that you are trying to look for the truth and not rely on hearsay of some TV should demonstrate the level of your intellect.     Islam is the second largest religion (After Chritianity) and followed by 1.6-2 billion people around the globe. As you know, how people live their lives is not single-jandedly affected by religion but also other factors such as culture, socioeconomy among others. With that vast populations of Muslims, you will find many diverse societies such as Arabs, Africans, Persians, Europians, South Asians and many more. The do share the fundemental basis of Islam (Worshiping one God and Believing in all prophets and the message they had brought). In fact, they share that basic faith with other Abrahamic religions (Christianity and Jews). However, they may differ in interpretation which is why you hear (Shia, Sunni, Salafi etc). These interpretations are not equivalant to the differences in Christian denominations (Catholics, Mormons, Protestants) because, unlike the latter, the former differs only in the interpretation but in text.     Some of that interpretation is tilted towards extremism. That group, however, is tiny as compared to the Muslim population. One might then ask, why this tiny group is so popular to the extent that they are all we hear from Islam? The answer to that question is because the media chooses its news and it choose to portray Islam as that of voilent religion that is all out to reduce this world into anarchy. That technique, however, is going to backfire because in that process they are empowering the extremists. If Islam resorts to defensive mode from an attacking media and thus the outside world, that guarantees more power for the extrimist who always claim Islam is under attack.     Why these groups are tilted towards voilence is another questioned that need more explanation and consideration of today's political, social and econimical framework. However, it can take a simple observation and a simple research on Islam and its people to find that it is far from misconceptions spreaded so fast. There are many people who, for their own purpose, would like Islam to be considered hostile but the fact is that it is a religion of 1/3 world population. Therefore, such attempt will bite its forerunner than bear any fruits.     Simple answers to your simple questions.  -Islam in principle is religion that believes in one God all his prophets including Jesus Christ.  -Islam is said to be the only religion that gives women the most rights than any other religion - that is the wording of an atheist scholar who is against all religions. Some cultures may affect how women are viewed in that society - therefore you could find some Muslims who does not treat women the way Islam instructs them to do so. At the same time, a culture may affect the very definitions of rights. For example, the west may say if the woman cannot depict all her body in public just like the man can do, that is not equality. Islam is always about standards and morality and not simply taking equality at face value. In fact, the west itself does not take equality at face value (at some issues). The womens role in Islam is human role (Mother, sister, leader, scholar, student, worker you name it).    Islam is the religion. Muslims are those who follow it.      -

Jesus had to die to save the pope just like He died to save you and me.|`|dDMOJWxwaa	Papal infallibility is the dogma in Catholic theology that, by action of the Holy Spirit, the Pope is preserved from even the possibility of errorwhen he solemnly declares or promulgates to the Church a dogmatic teaching on faith or morals as being contained in divine revelation, or at least being intimately connected to divine revelation. It is also taught that the Holy Spirit works in the body of the Church, as sensus fidei, to ensure that dogmatic teachings proclaimed to be infallible will be received by all Catholics.    This doctrine was defined dogmatically in the First Vatican Council of 1870. According to Catholic theology, there are several concepts important to the understanding of infallible, divine revelation: Sacred Scripture, Sacred Tradition, and the Sacred Magisterium. The infallible teachings of the pope are part of the Sacred Magisterium, which also consists of ecumenical councils and the "ordinary and universal magisterium". In Catholic theology, papal infallibility is one of the channels of the infallibility of the Church. The infallible teachings of the pope must be based on, or at least not contradict, Sacred Tradition or Sacred Scripture. Papal infallibility does not signify that the pope is impeccable, i.e., that he is specially exempt from liability to sin.    In practice, popes seldom use their power of infallibility, but rely on the notion that the Church allows the office of the pope to be the ruling agent in deciding what will be accepted as formal beliefs in the church." Since the solemn declaration of Papal Infallibility by Vatican I on July 18, 1870, this power has been used only once ex cathedra: in 1950 when Pope Pius XII defined the Assumption of Mary as being an article of faith for Roman Catholics. Prior to the solemn definition of 1870, Pope Pius IX, with the support of the overwhelming majority of Roman Catholic Bishops, had proclaimed Immaculate Conception an ex cathedra dogma in December 1854.|`|i6d582PFaa	1) never in real life  2) all the time in Christian's dreams|`|vSomavIzaa	the Pope will be infallible when his sanctification is complete, and that will be the day he passes on from this world and meets the Lord Jesus Christ face to face.

In order for the Pope to be infallible on a particular statement, however, four conditions must apply:     1. He must be speaking ex cathedra . . . that is, "from the Chair'' of Peter, or in other words, officially, as head of the entire Church;   2. the decision must be for the whole Church;   3. it must be on a matter of faith or morals;   4. the Pope must have the intention of making a final decision on a teaching of faith or morals, so that it is to be held by all the faithful. It must be interpretive, not originative; the Pope has no authority to originate new doctrine. He is not the author of revelation  only its guardian and expounder. He has no power to distort a single word of Scripture, or change one iota of divine tradition. His infallibility is limited strictly to the province of doctrinal interpretation, and it is used quite rarely. It is used in order to clarify, to "define,'' some point of the ancient Christian tradition. It is the infallibility of which Christ spoke when He said to Peter, the first Pope: "I will give (o thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven. And whatsoever thou shalt bind upon earth, it shall be bound also in heaven.'' (Matt. 16:19). Certainly Christ would not have admonished His followers to "hear the church'' (Matt. 18:17) without somehow making certain that what they heard was the truth  without somehow making the teaching magisterium of His Church infallible.     His ex cathedra decisions are not the result of his own private deliberations. They are the result of many years  sometimes hundreds of years  of consultation with the other bishops and theologians of the Church. He is, in effect, voicing the belief of the whole Church. His infallibility is not his own private endowment, but rather an endowment of the entire Mystical Body of Christ. Indeed, the Pope's hands are tied with regard to the changing of Christian doctrine. No Pope has ever used his infallibility to change, add, or subtract any Christian teaching; this is because Our Lord promised to be with His Church until the end of the world. (Matt. 28:20).|`|rGEZup0Zaa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_Infal...|`|bMJ0AYI1aa	never. like jesus, the pope is human. humans err.    god specifically tells us not to make gods out of people like jesus or the pope.    what he says about the catholic faith goes, but that's not infallibility. the church changes. they used to blame jews for jesus's death, now they officially don't. so which stance is "infallable".    the church is a human institution, so it changes, so it's not infallible, like jesus or the pope. anything human is not god and is not perfect.|`|lh8Tn02Naa	The Pope is infallible whenever he agrees with me.

The dogma of infallibility was proclaimed by the Vatican Council in 1870 over violent opposition from within the ranks of the Hierarchy itself. Prior to the assembly no less than 162 bishops signified they were opposed to the proclaiming of such a dogma, and after the assembly was called more than two months were consumed with heated debates over the issue. Scarcely in any parliament have important matters ever been subjected to as much discussion as was the question of papal infallibility in the Vatican Council.    One of the principal opponents at the assembly was the betitled Croatian scholar, Joseph Georg Strossmayer, who was bishop of Bosnia, Slavonia and Sirmium, as well as chaplain to the Austrian emperor, director of the Augustinian body at Rome, count of the Holy Roman Empire, and bishop of the pontifical throne. The speech that this learned man is reputed to have made before the Council is worth careful consideration, for it sets forth a brilliant array of undeniable facts. Limitation on space allows us to quote only the following excerpts from this speech.    Venerable Fathers and Brethren: .?.?. penetrated with the feelings of responsibility, of which God will demand of me an account, I have set myself to study with the most serious attention the writings of the Old and New Testament, and I have asked these venerable monuments of truth to make known to me if the holy pontiff, who presides here, is truly the successor of St.?Peter, vicar of Jesus Christ, and the infallible doctor of the church. .?.?. I have then opened these sacred pages. Well! (shall I dare to say it?) I have found nothing either near or far which sanctions the opinion of the Ultramontanes [the extremists who contend for papal supremacy]. And still more, to my very great surprise, I find in the apostolic days no question of a pope, successor to St.?Peter, and vicar of Jesus Christ, any more than of Mahomet who did not then exist. .?.?. No, Monsignori, I do not blaspheme, and I am not mad. Now, having read the whole New Testament, I declare before God, with my hand raised to that great crucifix, that I have found no trace of the papacy as it exists at this moment. .?.?.    Reading then the sacred books with that attention with which the Lord has made me capable, I do not find one single chapter, or one little verse, in which Jesus Christ gives to St.?Peter the mastery over the apostles, his fellow-workers.    Strossmayer then called attention to the sacred Scriptures which prove that (1) Jesus forbade Peter and the other apostles to exercise lordship as the kings of the Gentiles do (Luke 22:25), and yet, according to our tradition, the bishop said, the papacy holds in its hands two swords, symbols of spiritual and temporal power; (2) it was James and not Peter that presided over the assembly in Jerusalem and summed up their conclusions (Acts 15); (3) the church is built on Christ, not on Peter (Eph. 2:20). Strossmayer then continued and said:    Neither in the writings of St.?Paul, St.?John, nor St.?James, have I found a trace or germ of the papal power. St.?Luke, the historian of the missionary labours of the apostles, is silent on this all-important point. .?.?.    What has surprised me most, and what moreover is capable of demonstration, is the silence of St.?Peter. If the apostle had been what we proclaim him to bethat is, the vicar of Jesus Christ on earthhe surely would have known it; if he had known it, how is it that not once did he act as pope?    Edited for afterthought:    As the above states, before 1870 the Popes were not infallible. And as the last paragraph highlighted, even the one the RC claims as the "first" Pope, Peter, was not infallible. Since that is illogical that it took God some 15 centuries to grant the Papal "father" such authority, it is a bogus claim.|`|VFWRdAH3aa	the Pope is infallible when it comes to the Teachings of the Catholic Church.|`|vMf7pL9Aaa	A legal pope may not always morally be pope              ( have the authority of the Chair of Peter.)                        A worthy test of this position will come when a pope attempts to proclaim as an infallible doctrine of the Church that which is clearly contrary to God's will. The last formally defined dogma of the Church was in 1950 by Pope Pius XII  The Assumption.                        According to Can. 749 of the Code of Canon Law none of John Paul II's positions that are not dogmatically supported are considered as infallible. (Note: the Code of Canon Law itself does not infallibly teach.) For the present he is leading astray through deception.                legal  has met the requirements of law                      ( has authority over temporal church affairs ).                moral  has met the requirements of faith                      ( he validly exercises the spiritual authority of a priest and his                      universal proclamations on matters concerning faith and morals                      are guaranteed infallible by the power of the Holy Spirit ).                          [ moral, as herein used, does not refer to his being free of all mortal sin. ]            "Beloved, do not trust every spirit but test the spirits to see whether they belong to God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world." The spirits include everyone regardless of rank or status. We should trust the word of God (Sacred Scripture) while understanding that it can be further developed but can never be diminished or reversed. There is no more important person to test than the person filling the papal office, the reining pope. [1 John 4:1]                She (Saint Bridget of Sweden [Birgitta] ) was not sparing of her criticisms, and did not fear to denounce a pope (Urban V) "as a murderer of souls, more unjust than Pilate and more cruel than Judas." [Butler's Lives of the Saints, Vol. 4, p. 55-56]            When a man, who has legally been ordained a priest is elected as pope, he is elected to fill two positions, a legal position and a moral position. When he accepts the papacy, even if falsely, he is stating that he is both legally and morally qualified to be the pope. Such need not be the case. He could be either self-deceived or knowingly lying. While he who legally fills the office is and remains the legal pope for the duration of his reign, there is no assurance that a pope morally is or continues to occupy the office. That is, that he is morally filling the Chair of Peter even though he is legally occupying the Office of Peter. The Office of Peter being a legal position while the Chair of Peter is a moral position.            A Pope's legal status is not altered by reason of the moral condition of those who elect him, or even by his own moral relationship with God. Moral, as used in the context of this document, does not refer to his being in the state of moral union with God by reason of acts or omissions of personal human weakness. Reference is only to acts or omissions that have brought about automatic excommunication 1 and to conditions or traits that have disqualified him from occupying the papal office. Legally a pope remains in office until he dies, retires, or is in some effective public manner removed from office.            It needs to be understood that while all legal directives a pope makes are binding, his moral directives are not binding unless he is morally a reigning pope. He is not morally a pope if he is an infiltrator into the Church as an agnostic, atheist, freemason ( or a variant such as communist, fascist, nazi, or socialist ), homosexual, or is a member of a religion, secret organization, or government opposed to Jesus Christ or His one true Church, the Catholic Church. He would also not be pope if he had prohibiting defects.            While disqualification for the papacy would normally be unknown to the general population of Catholics and to the vast majority of those in the priesthood, this would have no bearing on the invalidity of a non moral papacy. Moral declarations made during a false reign are not binding upon those who morally ascertain his unworthy position or have a non self-indulgent faith in God that gives valid inspiration. They are also not binding on those among the faithful who understand the principle that a pope can neither diminish nor reverse any infallible doctrine of the Church concerning faith and morals and recognize that he has attempted to do so. This would include but is not limited to Sacred Scripture and the dogmatic councils of the Church such as the Council of Trent and Vatican Council I. Vatican II is not considered a dogmatic Church council. A future legal and moral pope has the authority to reverse any doctrine of a prior legal pope who was not also a moral pope, that is, one who was not morally occupying the Chair of Peter regardless of reason.|`|AA11440601	The Catholic Church teaches that the Pope is infallible at closely defined times.    The Pope is only infallible when he, in union with the body of bishops, solemnly teaches that a doctrine as true. This is called "ex cathedra", literally meaning in Latin  "from the chair".    This comes from the words of Jesus to Peter (the first Pope) and the Apostles (the first bishops),  "Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven" (Matthew 18:18) and "He who hears you hears me" (Luke 10:16).    At all other times the Pope can be just as wrong or sinful as you and me and be in need of forgiveness.    For more information, see the Catechism of the Catholic Church, section 891: http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt1s...     With love in Christ.|`|PbrGLvonaa	never is he infallible|`|lR6Ocjm1aa	In all honesty,  Long ago the inspired psalmist wrote these words: Do not put your trust in nobles, nor in the son of earthling man, to whom no salvation belongs. His spirit goes out, he goes back to his ground; in that day his thoughts do perish. Happy is the one who has the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in Jehovah his God, the Maker of heaven and earth.Psalm 146:3-6.     Never forget that no matter how sincere men may be or how influential or powerful religious leaders are, they are all dying creatures. Since they are unable to save themselves, how can they save or direct others? They cannot. Only God can, through his Kingdom government.|`|Icwz678Qaa	There is but One that is Infallible and it isn't the Pope.    The Almighty God is Infallible there is no human being that is Infallible.    Be Blessed:-)|`|AA10034051	The Catholic Churchs teaching on papal infallibility is one which is generally misunderstood by those outside the Church. In particular, Fundamentalists and other "Bible Christians" often confuse the charism of papal "infallibility" with "impeccability." They imagine Catholics believe the pope cannot sin. Others, who avoid this elementary blunder, think the pope relies on some sort of amulet or magical incantation when an infallible definition is due.     Given these common misapprehensions regarding the basic tenets of papal infallibility, it is necessary to explain exactly what infallibility is not. Infallibility is not the absence of sin. Nor is it a charism that belongs only to the pope. Indeed, infallibility also belongs to the body of bishops as a whole, when, in doctrinal unity with the pope, they solemnly teach a doctrine as true. We have this from Jesus himself, who promised the apostles and their successors the bishops, the magisterium of the Church: "He who hears you hears me" (Luke 10:16), and "Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven" (Matt. 18:18).     What the Church is saying with the doctrine of infallibly is that Christ is protecting his flock by giving the Pope the ability to say the right things when making official statements about faith and morals. The Church claims that these proclamations are "infallible," not that Church leaders are "indefectible." Most certainly everybody in the Catholic Church has defects (including its leaders), just like Evangelicals and all humans.    The doctrine of infallibility has nothing to do with the brainpower, intuition, moral fibre, or even the faith of the Pope. The Doctrine of infallibility has everything to do with God protecting his Church. It's amazing that even during medieval times when there were some questionable and even bad popes, God kept them silent on issues of faith and morals during their office.    A Pope only exercises infallibility on rare occasions - a handful of times in history. Here are the conditions:    The pope must speak ex cathedra (from the Chair of Peter) in his official capacity.   The decision must be binding on the whole Church.   It must be on a matter of faith or morals.   He must be intending to teach.     http://www.davidmacd.com/catholic/pope.h...    http://www.catholic.com/library/Papal_In...|`|NzR25cQAaa	infallible |in?fal?b?l|  adjective  incapable of making mistakes or being wrong : doctors are not infallible.  ? never failing; always effective : infallible cures.  ?

HOQp0gA7aa	I see your essential problem here.  You neglected to get the deluxe model Ouija board made from inlaid wood and glass.  They are a lot more expensive, but don't really work any better than the cardboard kind.      As far as setting it apart from any other board game, most board games provide entertainment for about 30 minutes to 2 hours.  I've not seen people really enjoy playing with a Ouija board outside of movies.  So as a dollar per entertainment value formula, I think the Ouija board is somewhat lacking.      The major thing to fear about a Ouija board is that some credulous sap really thinks the board it telling him to commit a stupid or harmful act.  Ah well, that kind of person probably also thinks that the TV is telling them to do stupid things as well, so it's best to keep such people clear of such temptations.    I hope this helps.|`|EFlX4GYOaa	This one time my neighbors cousin's girlfriend was using one, and she started to float and got stuck to the roof and didn't come down till someone put a rosary around her neck.    wwwwwwoooooooohhhhhhh    Although i am agnostic, I still would not use one.

(That makes her a VERY atypical American. Americans lie like they breathe.) I also do not lie.    When I was 10 or 11 I received an Ouija board from my mother as a Christmas gift, ironically. She also did not believe that they were real. Some missionaries from our church had come over for Christmas day, and were horrified to learn about the gift. My mother scoffed at their reaction, but they challenged her to give it a try. We sat down and asked it a question, then it moved without either one of us pushing it. Mom immediately threw it into the fireplace. While it was burning, human groans and cries came from the fire. Almost everyone in the room heard it. The small children did not.    The afterlife is not a myth, as so many wish it were. There are disembodied spirits who are as evil now as they were the day they died. Those people use Ouija boards to tell humans a few truths, then tell lies to control the people who are gullible or foolish enough to play with them.|`|CCeRdaoLaa	That's just silly.  Satan isn't just hiding in the Snakes and Ladders box, he's hiding *everywhere.*  He's in ouija boards, popular music, the Liberal Media, and especially in the Harry Potter books.    The boards themselves have attained a sort of forbidden occult status in popular culture.  As a result, they have the ability channel our subconscious through ideomotor action.  But then again, that's more brain than board.    I suppose someone could whomp you with the board itself... or trip over the little dealie that comes with it.  Or, you could be lectured to death by an outraged fundagelical.|`|hKJIDdVqaa	lol, I agree with you.

yq1WSp8naa	He's just messin with your head, Dude!|`|dDMOJWxwaa	the word meek does not mean weak.    HUMILITY, KINDNESS, PATIENCE. In the Sermon on the Mount, as given both to the Jews and to the Nephites, Christ promised that the meek shall inherit the earth. (Matt. 5:5; 3 Ne. 12:5.) David gave the same assurance to ancient Israel. (Ps. 37:11.) Few virtues have such inherent worth as meekness, for the meek are the godfearing and the righteous. They are the ones who willingly conform to the gospel standards, thus submitting their wills to the will of the Lord. They are not the fearful, the spiritless, the timid. Rather, the most forceful, dynamic personality who ever lived - He who drove the money changers from the temple, and with violence threw down their merchandising equipment (Matt. 21:12-13) - said of Himself, "I am meek and lowly in heart." (Matt. 11:29.)       Meekness is a fruit of the Spirit. (Gal. 5:23.) The Lord has said that his grace is sufficient for the meek in this life (Ether 12:26), and that in eternity they shall have an inheritance in the celestial kingdom. (Ps. 149:4.) When the earth is sanctified, cleansed from all unrighteousness, and prepared for celestial glory, then the meek shall claim their promised inheritance. (D. & C. 88:16-32.)|`|bmhnXEsVaa	He made us strong, in His image. We have chosen weakness by our appetite for independence, our desire to please ourself over Him or others, & by ignoring the poor, the orphan & the widow. We exchanged strength for weakness when we choose sin over obedience to God.|`|RitcXftoaa	He wants us to lean on Him for support.  He knows that we cannot conquer the world on our own.  We need His help to succeed.  We are weak on our own without the power of God to help us through life.|`|3boSBiA5aa	Jesus said to Paul in 2 Corinthians 12:9 "but he said to me,'My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.'"  Paul then goes on to say " Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weakness, so that Christ's power may rest on me.  That is why, for Christ's sake, I delight in weakness, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties.  For when I am weak, then I am strong."            We are, as humans, rather weak and frail beings.  Both physically as well as spiritually.  We may think that we are strong while in the prime of our youth, but take a look at the human being.  We enter this world as one of the most vulnerable creatures ever, we are completely dependent on our parents for the first few years of our lives.  As we grow, we become stronger physically.  As we continue to age, which is inevitable, we also get old and our body's start to become weak.  (try asking an 85 year old man to lift a 50 lb weight)                     Spiritually we are very weak beings.  Jesus said in Matthew 17:20 "Because you have so little faith.  I tell you the truth, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'move from here to there' and it will move.  Nothing will be impossible for you."  If we truly trust and believe in God, anything is possible, even walking on water.  In Matthew 14, Peter trusted Jesus and walked on the surface of Lake Galilee for a time, but his fear of the storm made his faith waver, and he started to sink.             I believe that God created us as weak beings so that we would learn to put our trust, belief and faith in him.  Paul said in 2 Corinthians 11:30 "If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness."  Our weakness opens a way for us to experiance the superabundant strength of God's grace.              Hebrews 2:14  "Since the children have flesh and blood, he too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might destroy him who holds the power of death - that is the devil - and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death."  This passage contradicts what you have said about God "trying" to get the devil to take us.  What this is saying is that since we are human; God sent Jesus as a human to live as one of us.  When Jesus died on the cross and took upon himself all our sins, and freed us from the power of the devil.  "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."  John 3:16.  God LOVES us.  He loves us enough to defeat death and the devil so that we may live with him in heaven.  Anyone willing to believe in Him will have a place in heaven.             I hope this helps answer some of your questions, my advice to you is to read a Bible.  Start with the book of John in the New Testament :)|`|e4yczpKsaa	It's called an Ego.

But it is a mistake to see the Law primarily as a set of rules.  It is an explication of God's Holiness.  So we apply it to our lives as a set of principles to live by rather than a legal code to enforce.  Some of the laws are related specifically to Jewish worship: the purity laws, for example.  But that doesn't mean that purity is unimportant for Christians.  Others relate to diet.  These have been lifted by God.  Still others have to do with Israel, as a political entity, being vassals of the Great King.  There is no 'one size fits all' approach to applying the Law.  But the God who gave these laws is the same God Christians worship.  He has not changed.  So the ethical/moral principles embodied in the law are just as binding today as they ever were.  The antinomianism of contemporary Christendom is a distortion of the gospel.  It stems from a libertine misreading of Paul.    peace|`|FmazIF6Maa	How do you fulfill a law?

The laws found in Leviticus are part of the old covenant between God and Israel.  Unless you are part of Israel, you are not a party to that covenant.    2.  That covenant came to an end upon the death of the party of the first part, Jesus Christ who was the God of the old covenant.  This sort of covenant ends upon the death of either party, just like a marriage covenant.    3.  Jesus and the law.  Jesus "fulfilled" the law by fulfilling the prophesies in the law concerning Him, and He "fulfilled" the legalities or righteous requirements of the law, not unlike one fulfills a covenant (contract) to buy a car or house by making all the payments.  Once "fulfilled" there is no need or purpose served in continuing to make the payments!     .|`|entRyNolaa	if you want to.....you are free to take Gods advice, it is not for His good but yours and the entire universe...|`|s7pqFa1eaa	I think that you should eat exactly what you wish.

Jesus saved your hide....
533z6lWpaa	No, but I see the author give a talk about it. Although he tries to remain consistent, his human nature breaks through. For instance, he said in the talk (most of the stuff can be found in the book too), "This guy threw some rocks at me. I wanted to throw some back, because as the Bible says 'an eye for an eye'." However, he failed to mention that Jesus said, "You have heard it said, 'an eye for an eye' but I tell you 'turn the other cheek.'" If you are looking for a good human story, this book is great. If you are looking for Biblical accuracy, you may not find it there.

If you are disobedient to the old covenant law, it is irrelevant. Christians are dead to that law.    Disobedient to the new covenant law of faith?  Now you have a problem, seeing as the old covenant law is not of faith, and whatever is not of faith is sin.    If you add the old covenant law to the gospel, you falsify the gospel.  The gospel is about faith in Christ, and not faith in Christ plus keeping the old covenant law or anything else besides faith.  God and God only.

Allah will forgive all sins except worshipping something else apart from him or not worshipping him all together, so this is a major sin that punishment is agreed on in all religions. that is the fire of hell forever! then you have those who believe but sin, and everyone has sinned at some stage. if they harm another human being then on the judgement day they will be put in front of that person and asked to give back what they took! as they would have nothing materialistic to hand out, it will be their deeds that will be exchanged, Allah will take from their good deeds and give it to the other person, and if they haven't got any, He will take from the other person's bad deeds and give it to them. then all the deeds will be measured, those who has more bad deeds than good deed go to hell, those who has opposite go to heaven. those who balance the two will wait in between until everyone is judged then Allah will decide where to place them. there are also people who enter hell first and spend time in there then will be sent to heaven. its a tough day may Allah help us all through it.|`|jMPA2CSYaa	Jesus said 'Judge not lest ye be judged, for the judgment ye give ye shall receive'.

The disobedient of this age (and the age to come), from the time of Adam to the time of the Great White Throne Judgement, will be resurrected to a second physical life at the end of the 1000 year reign of Christ and the saints (Revelation 20:5,7,12, Ezekiel 37); and they will be taught from the opened books (the Bible) the Way of life (Isaiah 30:20).  Their minds will be opened by the holy spirit (Proverbs 1:23, Joel 2:28, Acts 2:17), and they will be offered eternal life with the saints in the Kingdom of God (Ezekiel 37:14, 1 Corinthians 15:22).    At the end of that time of judgement, those who wilfully continue in their sins, the incorrigibly wicked, will share the same fate as that of the angels (Matthew 25:41).  They will be cast into the Lake of Fire where they will become ashes under the feet of the saints (Malachi 4:3), and never to be resurrected to life ever again (Ezekiel 28:19).  .
PWankIUpaa	I have seen several Pro Israeli things deleted and have seen signs of Pro Islam favoritism!  Islam is Invading America and there is not one stopping ! Islam cannot be American Citizens because America is Opposed to another Nation claiming Supremacy over her Laws yet our leaders who have Very Short memories except to hurt Americans Whom they are required by Contract to protect are letting them run roughshod over our citizens!    It seems the lessons of our earlier dealings with Islam did  not sink in!  Treaties were ignored and our citizens captured and beheaded and tortured !

You must not be Jewish or you'd know the poor treatment we've received lately.    I'm complaining to 701 First Ave. Sunnyvale, CA  94089 and to the Anti-Defamation League for the crappy way Yahoo has "mediated" these boards, deleting questions by the Pro-Israelis and keeping anti-semitic commentaries.|`|pSS1xPknaa	I was skeptical about the idea that Jews were being targeted more than other groups. I've always found that this website has enough bigotry and ignorance to go around.    But I have found, as many of my friends that there seems to be a number of Pro Israel or Jewish posts being unfairly deleted. I do not believe that this is happening because of Yahoo rather a group of bigots are simply reporting these posts.    Deletions can be constested and I have had violations reversed and deleted posts republished.|`|MoSVM3Nnaa	I don't think there's a conspiracy against Israel on Y!A, and I also resent the way you've made the assumption that all Jewish people must support Israel's actions.|`|i6d582PFaa	I'm sure they delete pro-Gaza questions as well. They delete whatever someone reports so take that into consideration.    I've had questions proving the existence of God deleted as well as questions disproving the existence of God deleted. So I'd say they are equal in their intolerance of a wide range of questions. In other words, it's just people reporting questions and them deleting them without much thought. It sucks, I know.|`|4yg7zZZ2aa	I do not think Y!A is one way or the other. I just saw a question saying that the Yamster is pro-Israel (in the persons "question" that was a bad thing).    If more then two people report a question it will get deleted, no matter what. You can make an appeal and if it is not in violation of the TOS you will get your question/answer back.    But yes, I have received more hate-mail then usual by some Yahoo users, not Yahoo itself. There is a big difference.|`|8UTdi5G0aa	Are you sure that Yahoo! deleted it?  Or was it perhaps deleted (reported) by one or more users?  You should have received an automated Violation Notice at the time of deletion.  If so, what did it say?  Yahoo! does not have enough employees sitting around reading all the posts to mediate them personally.|`|XEBpv9gwaa	I don't think anyone cares what someone's religion is or if they support Israel or not.    If we could somehow read what was deleted we could maybe help you figure out what the real violation was.|`|SvEzmp4Laa	The conflict is indeed a religious war and Yahoo has people from all religions and political persuasions so it seems probable that it was deleted by those who are against the conservative Israelis.|`|3DDgXmXVaa	I'm not Jewish but I don't see why they could delete your posting or any other posting about Jews/Israel.  If they are, then that's not right.       If people are dropping rude comments then they're simply just losers. Don't take that. That's one thing that, unfortunetly, shows that this world will never reach peace. Everyone must always hate each other and prove themselves to be better. Don't let people ignore you or silence you for being Jewish or supporting Israel.       Have you worded your posts nicely? Because if they're rude, which im sure theyre not, or even if someone's comment on them is vulgar or hateful or rude, that could cause the question to be deleted cause it violates policy. If might not even be your fault-maybe just how people respond to it.  Best of luck.|`|vSomavIzaa	I can't speak for the people at Yahoo, maybe they do have an agenda, as almost everyone does, but I would make the case that the "anti-jewish" side of the debate is what gets suppressed. The media is absolutely dominated by Jews. I don't see how anyone can argue otherwise. That is a statistical fact.     They also have themselves insulated by this radical "attack-dog" defense mechanism of calling anyone who has "anything" negative to say about the State of Israel branded an "anti-semite". I don't even know what a semite is, so please don't brand me as one, but the people who run the state of Israel are not Jews. They are freemason Illuminati. They are the same people who also control the US. So if I'm "anti-Israel", I guess that would also make me "anti-American".  We have all been duped, Americans and Jews, into going along with the agenda of these who are of the "synagogue of Satan" talked about in Revelation, "Jews who say they are Jews, but lie, and are of the synagogue of Satan".  Every Prime Minister of Israel since her inception in 1948 has been a freemason. The Rothschild family caused WW2, in order to bring about a Jewish state in Palestine. Google the evil deeds of the Rothschild family and their involvement in almost every evil deed done in at least the past 100 years, and you'll see that this is a big deception in the biggest way. They own all of the players on both sides, they are plotting wars and monopolies for death, destruction and profit. They are not people who are dedicated to serving the Living God.  Albert Pike, cheif of North American freemasonry and a self-professed "Luciferian", wrote a letter in 1871 to a man named Mazzini where he laid out the "agenda" for three world wars to take place to achieve their ultimate goals. The second World War was to be initiated and fought for the sole purpose of establishing a Jewish State in Palestine, and for setting up a communist superpower in Russia to "keep Christianity in check until the time of the unfolding", which would be the third world war, which we find ourselves on the dawning of as we speak..  Interestingly enough, WW3 is absolutely on the very-near horizon, these people are doing everything they can to get this massive war started as soon as possible, and most people will be led to the slaughter for a lack of understanding of who is pulling the strings. These Luciferians are planning to install the AntiChrist on the throne of the world, and he will rule from Jerusalem.    I am as serious as a heart attack about this. This is not hate speech or propaganda or anything other than what I say it is: a warning.  Repent now and turn to the Lord Jesus Christ, and do some homework and research these claims for yourself. Then warn everyone you care about. A lot of good people are about to be killed.    God Bless You, and I pray for peace and revival in Jerusalem|`|GMFXD1ENaa	I've only asked a few questions on Y!A in the short amount of time I've been on here, and they haven't had to do with the state of Israel. But this does seem to be the case in some situations, and I have noticed that other pro-Israel contributors have felt this way, too. Is it possible for an entire question to be deleted only because there is an abundance of hateful replies? Or is it only the "answerers" who are deleted?

funeSrxUaa	Are you referring to the command to be holy.    Leviticus 19:2  "Speak to the entire assembly of Israel and say to them: 'Be holy because I, the LORD your God, am holy."  And later emphasized by Peter, "But just as he who called you is holy, so be holy in all you do; for it is written: 'Be holy, because I am holy.'" (1 Peter 1:15,16)    Being holy is something that is often overlooked, or not even taught.  Primarily because of the lack of understanding of what the word holy means.  The word itself means to be set apart.  As Christians we are to be set apart from the world.  Being in the world, but not of the world.  Christians are set apart for a better life and a better purpose for Christ our Savior.|`|lMT8btn8aa	For me life specifically? To help train pastors.|`|VhtyM9Bpaa	So who's the superior official?

He created us for Himself, and for Him must we live.    I  know I am a child of God because I put all my Faith in Jesus Christ, who died for our sins and I have been saved by His grace. I was not worth of it, but He chose to save me for His glory - so that I may testify of His holiness. And that I want to do - this is His mandate in my life.    Jesus is all I have - and all I will ever need.    p.s: to "live for His glory means this:  "in view of God's mercy, to offer your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to Godthis is your spiritual[act of worship."  Paul also urges all believers to this: " 2Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will ishis good, pleasing and perfect will." Romans 12:1-3|`|FmazIF6Maa	We are all children of the Higher Power (God). There's no choice in it.

But if you do that, then you will easily follow His other commands like the great commission which is what I think you were looking for.      *EDIT*  lol   No fair I didn't have the second clue ! Be Holy is probably the best choice but their are other choices like... be as little children, be wise, be innocent, be not afraid, a whole lot more possibilities.

69cd36328eaef0b19b8030fabeaa9a1eaa	My thought is that we are all dual-natured.  We are body and spirit.  Our spirit is our true self, and our body is the physical form that our spirit inhabits.  In the same way, Jesus was just a man.  But he was the man that housed the spirit of the Christ, the son of God.  It is this spirit, I think, that used various bodies over the ages (Mithras, Quexalcoatl, etc.) in an attempt to redeem mankind given through one culture or another (Jesus to the Jews, Mithras to the Persians, etc.)    Blessed be!  ~Embracing my Pangelism|`|U4V6TkZEaa	How in the 'ell did early Christians who wrote the Bible know about Quexalcoal in Central America?

The Faith of those of The True Christian Faith is based upon The Fact of God... not upon any kind of physical "evidence"... or any work of man...

AA11440601	I think you have to get over a bit of anti-clerical prejudice.    If you respect the freedom of religion then you should respect religious leaders.     If you respect the freedom of speech then you should respect the speech of religious leaders.    All religions have leaders, teachers, and/or spiritual directors. The clergy is a basic part of almost all religions.    Priests, bishops, and the Pope are just following the command of Jesus Christ to: Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you.

3GAiVmEAaa	I don't think she should have been suspended, but that was pretty dumb on the nurses part. THat just is something you should avoid. People are sick, and in pain, their job is to handle the medical not the spiritual.    When you are sick and in the hospital, you often loose all sense of privacy. You are out in the open, people know your physical weaknesses. Spirituality brings some people comfort but pressuring a prayer (yes even just asking) can make someone feel even more exposed and uncomfortable.     I am agnostic as well. I worked have worked in nursing homes since I was 15 (first just training, then actually working as an aide). I will not pray with a resident, but if one asked me to I would sit with them and offer them comfort as they prayed. It isn't my job to actually pray with them though, so it is perfectly reasonable to refuse to say something with them. If they needed additional support, I would refer the facilities religious person to them. Most hospitals would have a chaplain of some sort, and most nursing homes will at least have people come in and visit.     THe nurse should have either just said "you are in my thoughts" instead of "you are in my prayers". SHe also could have asked if they would like to speak to a chaplain. I just think she was out of line doing that herself.    I think she should have just been told to avoid doing that again. But hey, this may not be the whole story. this nuse may have had a record of being very religious and pushy. This could ahve been the 10th time, or should could have argued with co workers about this stuff.    ADD: YOu most certainly can work up 25 years nursing without great ability. Some can do the job but are absolute idiots with their personal lives and dealing with other people. Obviously not all, but they certainly aren't all angels.|`|YVJQ7Y4jaa	It was overreaction by the hospital and a real stupid complaint.

Do you prefer "Double Standard" or Hypocrite???|`|entRyNolaa	good for her!  looks like a point for the winning side|`|xWi4ua0Iaa	It probably depended a lot on the stink the patient made over it...some people are as entrenched in their atheism as the most rabid fundie on YA R&S is in their belief system...you should post the link...|`|bMJ0AYI1aa	it sounded like the patient tried to decline, and the nurse insisted.    doctors and nurses need to keep their own beliefs out of the hospital. if the patient asks, that's one thing. but to offer and insist is rude and unprofessional. i would complain too.  if you can't do your job with your beliefs, find a new job. inflicting your religion on others in the workplace, especially clients, is not acceptable.|`|FhHklqkhaa	Ican see why she was reported  it's going to be open-season for the media to scrape the barrel about how-hard done by christianity is and other lies|`|9fec6a8704a864b61d3862874ce94967aa	When I had to have a major operation last year one of the nurses who had been on my ward but was on rotation to another ward came especially to see me and tell me that she was praying for me.    Have to say, it scared me witless  for a minute or to as I thought " What aren't they telling me? " before I realised that it was  a caring gesture from a very kind lady.    Without knowing the circumstances it does seem over the top, however maybe she scared the patient as well!|`|Gf5nMPJXaa	Strange then if you are not partisan about this that you would leave out and change salient points about the incident.....  Not even give us a link either so we can learn for ourselves.    Examples:  You focus on personal gain and gloss over the written and signed contract that states nurses should not promote ANY causes external to their duties.  You also assume that the prayer offer was a genuine attempt to help.  What credibility does a medical professional have if they honestly think mumbled words helps healing?  Also not mentioned in the article - there was no hint of her intent, which could just as easily have been to proselytize or claim credit for any good results for her god.   You do not mention that this was a repeated incident after an initial warning not to suggest prayers unasked.  You do not mention the nurse in question's repeated history of handing out prayer cards.    Kind of slanted for an "agnostic" eh?|`|o0I5YXMNaa	Not sure what your question is but Caroline did nothing wrong. I wonder about the nurse and carer who reported her and made such a fuss. Why did they do that?  What sort of team is that?  Many times I have smoothed things over for my colleagues (and I'm not talking about abuse).  Where's the professionalism?    Many times I've had to watch patients being too scared to say they're embarrassed at the dirty talk and foul language which is often the norm on the ward.  Once when I gently suggested to a carer that she tone down a bit, I was physically attacked. No one was suspended then.    When I trained it was taught that part of the nurse's role was to support spiritually, and we were actively encouraged to pray at the bedside if asked.  It's not that long ago when the ward routine began with Christian prayers.   .    The whole incident about Caroline, the nurse in question,  leaves me feeling disgusted. I hope she keeps offering to pray for others.|`|6b8e59fd2fd02ff0fc91538b71ecd4d8aa	How sad the patient reported a nurse just for offering prayer!!  sounds mean to me - but then i don't know how the patient felt.  I remember sitting at at a dinner table with around 10 people - one of my friends asked a lady who was in a wheelchair if she would like some of us to pray for her - the lady panicked and was clearly upset -- so we can't really know how the patient in question felt when the nurse offered to pray for her....    The odd thing is: prayer does promote health - it's been scientifically proven that patients who receive prayer recover more quickly    ; )    I think it's a lot of fuss over nothing really -- and PC in the UK gone mad!|`|AA11225089	I nearly became a nurse and if I had, I would offer to pray for people whatever the consequences. I support the nurse, the patient needs to move on and let it go.|`|kYqFfYqvaa	she was just doing a good thing ppl im shocked!!!!!!!!!!|`|ZA11WBR2aa	She was only trying to be nice and she certainly didn't deserve to be suspended for that.|`|ncXMA6rsaa	I'd be really offended and quite pissed off if someone who was supposed to be assisting me with medical treatment offered to 'pray' for me. She got what she deserved. Her head is in the clouds if she thinks that's appropriate behaviour.    Hatred? No I'm just sick of whingey whiney religious people complaining about everything.

In the UK last few centuries this would have been more common when most people were religious, nobody would have minded!  Why did that woman get offended!  And what was the need to report her?  I think that was mean of the woman to report her.    A Catholic man got suspended in a UK airport as well for hanging up a picture of Jesus in his office area!|`|3ZgOAUOTaa	the nurse should have only gotten a verbalreprimand and removed from caring for that one patient...  she was only trying to encourage the patient...    now, if she was trying to convert the patient, then suspension would be in order|`|H7L66ynJaa	Personally, I am grateful a nurse offerred to pray for my wife when she was 7. She had been in a coma for a year and was given hours to live. A nurse said she would pray and my wife would live. The next day she recovered conciousness and is still alive no some 51 years later. So prayer did good. Maybe she should have asked Can I pray for you? Then the answer would be yes or no.|`|GuTUQpSpaa	I'm an atheist, but I agree that it was ridiculous to suspend her.  It's not like she busted out the holy water and performed an exorcism.  She was just trying to help, in her own misguided way.    Edit: I do suppose that there are always two sides to a story.  Still, it does seem a tad anal to complain over a nurse wanting to pray for you.  If she was being pushy about it, then fine, but if the patients are just trying to make a stand, it's ridiculous.|`|JyAUAbsjaa	It all boils down to power and control.|`|871ea50d251ea84b03eb405148721ecbaa	Again I am an an Atheists and I think this is ridiculous, the PC brigade is going too far, what is wrong with someone offering to pray for you, what harm can it possibly do|`|rAmhfdqkaa	i think they should have warned her, suspended is a bit harsh.|`|C1SOqQSkaa	Nope - there;s more to the story    She's a temp, and already had a complaint against her for something else. They didn't 'suspend' an employee, they simply stopped using her while the two issues are investigated.

GuTUQpSpaa	Atheism is the most scientific approach.  It's not a matter of saying that there is certainly no god; it's an absence of belief in one, based on the principle that one should withhold belief until they see evidence.  Are you agnostic about unicorns?  Fairies?  Leprechauns?  The flying spaghetti monster?  In science, we always default in the negative stance.  If someone comes up with a new hypothesis, we withhold belief until said theory has been proven.  Why should we think any differently when it comes to god?    Edit: Calling a comment stupid without providing any counter points says more about you than it does about me.  If you had any understanding of the scientific method, you'd have grasped my point.  Or are you just here to engage in immature name-calling?|`|WalnRzfGaa	No. There's no evidence for a god, so it can be logically concluded the universe doesn't require one. What's arrogant about that?    and there were no such things as atoms until we found proof of them.    this is not a good argument against the existence of God.    Agnostic is the only one that realizes the truth. There is no Evidence for or against the existence of a God/Gods and until there is you can not say either way.    eric k: freezer burned atheist - the definition of an atheist is somoen that does not believe in  a God/Gods.    if you are agnostic that means you know you can prove there is or is not a God so you just cant say either way.    there is a big difference.    i wouldnt call them argogant or ignorant. the just believe what they believe just as you do.|`|871ea50d251ea84b03eb405148721ecbaa	No I am Atheist, though I prefer the term Freethinker, but I am tolerant of all religious people as long as they are are tolerant of my beliefs. I think you will find that the only murderous intolerant bigots are all theists, but not all theists.|`|4OjLMQ6Yaa	1. Atheism isn't ignorant. Lack of faith in any mystical being is NEVER ignorant. They simply cannot beleive that anything exists, what is so wrong about that? It is quite possible that they are right and everyone else is dead wrong.    2. Theism isn't ignorant either. Religion is and always will be about perception. Not everyone is "bullied", there are quite a few people who freely beleive and are not bullied into it.     3. So you don't reject the fact jesus existed, what are you trying to prove? I know he existed, I just never beleived he was divine or anything other than a religious man in his lifetime.     4. Ghosts, demons and spirits only exist to those who beleive in them. We have NO proof that they do or do not exist. I personally do not beleive that demons exist. Negative spirits and positive spirits yes....demons, not on your life. Until the paranormal field has a concrete scientific method to determine whether or not ghosts/spirits/anything not of the physical world exists it is left up to each individual to decide whether or not they exist.    Get over yourself. You are just as bad as an extremist atheist or religious fundamentalist. You don't want people "bullying" you to beleive a specific way yet your willing as hell to push your own ideas on others. Have fun with that, it won't work.|`|rGEZup0Zaa	No.    Agnosticism doesn't address questions of belief.    You either have belief, or you don't.    If you don't, you are an atheist by definition.|`|to8CkYp2aa	Atheism is the lack of belief in god(s). Since no evidence has been put forward, non-belief is a reasonable position, by default.|`|b63saJCqaa	ok then Mr militant agnostic, if you were truly an agnostic you wouldn't reject any scripture at all, they'd all be possibilities to you  you're not wishy washy enough to be a true agnostic, you have "selective agnosticism"|`|Gf5nMPJXaa	Oh christ another idiot who can;t tell the difference between rejecting a claim and making an opposite claim.    I'm 6'9" tall and can bench press 400lbs.  Do you believe me outright, reject it until I prove it, or claim it's impossible?      Agnosticism is an epistemological question not an ontological one, and not knowing the difference means you instantly lose all credibility in a discussion about either.|`|34X8mN0laa	Ghosts, demons and spirits may exist, but we don't have any actually evidence for against them, we cannot say.    This sentence shows up your derailed train of thought.      You want to have your cake and eat it too!|`|Lk4aCBACaa	As a Pagan, I'd have to say no. :)    Not all theists are alike. My religion is united by its deities and practices, not by any specific dogma we all must follow, and the majority of us take our myths symbolically not literally. The bible is irrelevant to my faith. I also do not believe in heaven/hell, or a reward vs. punishment eternal afterlife. I chose my religion because I found it to be spiritually fulfilling and inspiring, not because of any fear of what happens or doesn't happen after death. Also, I am perfectly comfortable admitting that I may be wrong about my spiritual beliefs; in that way I'm an agnostic underneath it all. But I would not find my spirituality any less fulfilling even if it were somehow proven to be "wrong."    I do agree with you that agnosticism is an un-arrogant approach, just not the only one. :)|`|rFFYCmOGaa	Well I'm a Deist and to me all that means is that I call the process of whatever happened at the big bang or big bounce "god."    But I might as well call myself an agnostic since I really truly do not know if such a process even occurred. Fact is, no one knows.    In all fairness to atheist I think that when they proclaim absolute conviction of there being no god anywhere in the entire universe ever that what they really mean is in the "known universe" thus far and I cannot disagree with them on that.    All skeptical labels aside, I have no doubts that if credible universally verifiable evidence for a god were to be discovered or somehow revealed that were to convince all scientists everywhere, we would all end up believing the same basic thing--and by "we" I mean the skeptical bunch since I think that there would still be many believers who would then try to fit such evidences into their already developed theologies in order to exclude, make money, or exploit everyone who differs from their world view.|`|xZ1GD4zbaa	Frankly, I think it's the chicken **** approach to God.|`|1iKEQ6yYaa	Agnosticism is the only un-ignorant approach to God = Absolutely not    Here is a a fun fact for you the Bible is the inspired Word of God  [ 1Timothy 3:16] not the rumours of men.

Some go back to the derivation of the word but most use it more loosely.  Most atheists are agnostic atheists or sometimes called weak atheists.    If someone wants to be technical, agnoticism means we *cannot* know, not simply that we don't know.    My statement of belief: There is no empirical evidence for any deities.  Natural processes best explain our universe.
IqtzkgyBaa	In truth the BIBLE say when GOD comes, not spook, at end of the world he will give us names of his attributes and prolong our lifes. Names is different in arabic language, they are dialects of arabic language, well as other nation. Name Muhammad is more Universal is original and ancient, because original arabians were Asiactic Black People before the White Arabs rule their, doesnt matter what race we be, long as u doing will of GOD !  Prophet Muhammad of 1300 yrs ago who GOD choose to guide the people to the right path was WHITE PROPHET a WHITE ARAB was prototype of one thats (coming) end of the world call, Christ, Messiah, in muslim world the Mahdi- ALLAH(GOD) in person or one he raise represent Divine wisdom reveal secrets of Heavens and Earth! Their no need for prophets at that time, GOD comes make us Gods, thats why quran is call book of manifest, GOD will come make his self known and rasie one represent his coming.    We are not perfect yet, it takes generation or a process of purfication to become the childrens of GOD through also studying GOD words and act on GODS words. Certainly there are acts of kindness and there are acts of goodness that all of us know are universally recognized an good, but we cannot be considered a good people; this cannot be considered a good nation ); nor can we, the Muslims, Christians etc, be considered good, unless that goodness is rooted in our doing the Will of Allah (God)    In Holy Quran ALLAH has 99 attributes we can have, and even Jesus deals with 99 spiritual call the sheep meaning (people) not animals, but people charateristic of a sheep call them a LOST SHEEP spiritually, dumb, deaf, blind to knowledge of GOD or Lost knowledge self and GOD.     Muhammad means one is worthy of praise and Christians means one or anointed or chystalize in one to follow example of Jesus Christ ! Jesus is Muhammad and Muhammad is Christ base on true meaning of origin same with Buddha means (awake) or one that is full of elightment of wisdom of GOD, we are awake in GOD wisdom, we are resurrected in our minds, we are not blind, dumb, deaf ,anymore or dead mentally of reality of GOD and His Angels.|`|dPJr1Lbmaa	Hi, Muhammad is the name of our Prophet, Gods last Prophet Muhammad (pbuh). To give your child this name is just because its a good name, a respectful name, an honorable name, nothing more.   Personally I only know a handful of Muhammad's.   There are different spellings because when written in Arabic to write it in English there is no right or wrong translation. Sarah is a Muslim name also as is Hannah and I am sure you know many Sarah's with a few different spellings too.   Muhammad is normally a first name, when its said as a second it mean son of as in Omar son of Muhammad its not really there family last name.  I did not find it rude or offensive. You are curious and if you dont ask you dont know, am I right :)  Hope that explains it a little better for you.    Peace to you.|`|6rSBVcQ4aa	Most Islamic peoples are somewhat to very religious.  It could be just a family name or people took the name of the Prophet Muhammad to honor him.|`|g54tGcRvaa	About the spelling, it's translated from another language, so there are many variants of transliteration schemes.  Think Hannukah/Chanukah.  Even Mandarin has several transliteration schemes.|`|CQz8dMzFaa	Ppl are named Muhammad..because their parents wanted them to be...I guess. As for the spelling, up to the individual pronunciation, the meaning is the same.|`|AA10859355	Spelling is not that important. Since its an arabic name, whenever you write it any other language you could have variations. People write sara and sarah right?    Muhammad was the name of the Holy Prophet (given by his grand father). He was also name Ahmad (given by his mother).    The meaning of the word Muhammad is "the praised one" and the meaning of Ahmad is "the highly praised one"    As far as naming children after him, its a sign of respect and love to the Holy Prophet. And every muslim has the highest respect and love for him.  Most people are named with Muhammad and one of the name of the prophets or the companions of the Holy Prophet. So you may find names like Muhammad Ibrahim (Abraham) or Muhammad Musa (Moses), etc.    Also first and last names are not adhered to as strongly as it is in the west. A person may not have any name in common with their father. Though it may not be common.

(Matthew 6:9)  This is the beginning of what is referred to as the "Lord's prayer." Jesus gave the disciples an example of how to approach God the Father in prayer, what to pray for and even the order of importance of what we say (e.g. we should honor or worship God first before asking to be fed ("Give us this day our daily bread. " in verse 11). Jesus clearly wants us to pray.  In daily devotions, Thank God for another day that he has brought to you. Thank him for your health and ask him to help you make choices during the day that will be in his honor or favor. Have a short devotional. At the end of the day, Thank God for your day, let him know the problems that you had and ask him to guide you in your decisions to handle these problems. Pray for those that are sick, pray for your personel problems that you are having a hard time dealing with....Thy will be done  God knows what we need, talking to him lets him know that we are humby asking him to guide us. We cannot do this alone. If we just sit there twiddling our thumbs, God will twiddle his too. Why? Because we haven't come to him and ask him to guide us, help us with our decision making and be there for us if we fall, and always but always...Thy will be done...then accept the fact that although we think we know what we want...God knows what is best|`|c1bcf89ea5a3b194ebaa571a36740f54aa	When asked if prayer was necessary since presumably God knows the wishes of all our hearts     Abdu'l-Baha said:   "If one friend feels love for another lie will wish to say so. Though lie knows that the friend is aware that he loves him, he will still wish to say so. If there is anyone that you love do you not seek an opportunity to speak with him, to speak lovingly with him, to bring him gifts, to write him letters? If you do not feel such a desire it would be that you did not love your friend. God knows the wishes of all hearts. But the impulse to pray is a natural one springing from man's love to God.      "If there be no love, if there be no pleasure or spiritual enjoyment an prayer, do not pray. Prayer should spring from love, from the desire of the person to commune with God. Just as the lover never cease from wishing to communicate with the beloved so does the lover of God always wish for constant communication with the Deity.      "Prayer need not be in words, but in thought and attitude. But if this love and this desire are lacking it is useless to try to force them. Words without love mean nothing. ft a person talks to you as an unpleasant duty with no love or pleasure in his meeting with you, do you wish to converse with him ? Efforts should first be made to make attachment to God."|`|c7pbvYmpaa	So we can look stupid.|`|kIblsxJQaa	Cos if you dont ask, you dont get.|`|2259822f0cd7ff32d9ffac0f2a824a63aa	Because he enjoys hearing our voice and:  It's we who need to submit and request, be aware of our need for God and his help, not he who needs reminding.

His Word encourages us: Do not be anxious over anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving let your petitions be made known to God; and the peace of God that excels all thought will guard your hearts and your mental powers by means of Christ Jesus. (Philippians 4:6,?7) Surely we would not want to ignore such a kind provision made for us by the Supreme Ruler of the universe! Another reason to pray is that regularly praying to Jehovah is a way to strengthen our relationship with him. True friends do not communicate only when they need something. Rather, good friends are interested in each other, and their friendship becomes stronger as they freely express their thoughts, concerns, and feelings. In some respects, the situation is similar when it comes to our relationship with Jehovah God. With the help of this book, you have learned much about what the Bible teaches regarding Jehovah, his personality, and his purposes. You have come to know him as a real person. Prayer gives you the opportunity to express your thoughts and innermost feelings to your heavenly Father. As you do, you draw closer to Jehovah.James 4:8.|`|wQbbvSs0aa	God wants you to come to Him.

JCGtfNeTaa	I keep the Sabbath because I am saved, not in order to be saved.    I work FROM my salvation, not FOR my salvation. God did not save us IN sin, but saved us FROM sin; that is, He did not save us so that we can continue in sin, but saved us from sin to deliver us from its power that we may be His servants, and not slaves to sin.    If we are truly saved, then we will lead a different life, one unto obedience to God, not disobedience.    Not saved by keeping the law. - Galatians 2:16  "by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified."        Good works are the fruits (results) of salvation - 2 Timothy 3:16-17  "All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, ... ...that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work."      Good works are an essential part of salvation (again, as fruitage, not as prerequisite) - James 2:17-20  Thus also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.  But someone will say, You have faith, and I have works. Show me your faith without your works, and I will show you my faith by my works. You believe that there is one God. You do well. Even the demons believeand tremble! But do you want to know, O foolish man, that faith without works is dead?      The 10 commandments were so important to God that He spoke them Himself from Mt Sinai (Exodus 20:1), and He wrote them Himself with His very finger, on tablets of stone, not just once, but twice, the second time after Moses broke the first set.    The 10 Commandments is the only part of the Bible written by God Himself with His own finger, and people want to say it has been done away with. The 4th commandment is the only one that begins with the word "Remember", and it is the very one that people want to forget.    The 4th commandment points us back, reminding us of the very FIRST Sabbath: the 7th day of the creation week. (Exodus 20:11) It gives Creation as the reason for keeping the Sabbath day. As was the institution of marriage, the Sabbath institution was given to man (not to just the Jews - Mark 2:27) before sin existed in this earth.    The Sabbath:    1) Reminds us where we came from, reminds us of Creation. Exodus 20:11    2) Reminds us of where we're headed, reminds us of redemption Deuteronomy 5:15 (the story of the Israelites is our story too. we learn much about the plan of salvation from their experience)    3) The people in the Old Testament kept the Sabbath (Isaiah 56:2, 6, 7)    4) Jesus kept the Sabbath, and He is our example. (Luke 4:16; 1 John 2:6)    5) The apostles kept the Sabbath (Acts 17:2; Acts 13:13, 14; Acts 16:13; Acts 18:4)    6) Even the Gentile converts kept the Sabbath (Acts 13:42-44; Acts 18:4; Isaiah 56:2, 6, 7) This would have been an excellent time for the apostles to have told them to come back the next day, on the new Christian Sabbath, if it were in fact true that the day of worship was changed to Sunday.    7) We will keep the Sabbath in the New Earth (Isaiah 66:22-23).    8) God's law does not change (Luke 16:17; Psalms 89:34)    9) Jesus expected the believers to keep the Sabbath, even after His return to heaven after His resurrection. Jesus tells them to pray that their flight not be on the Sabbath - Matthew 24:20 (referring to destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD)    10) The Sabbath is the Lord's Day (Isaiah 58:13; Matthew 12:8)    11) To willfully break the Sabbath is just as bad as breaking any of the other 10 commandments (1 John 3:4; Romans 3:23; James 2:10; 1 Peter 2:21; Hebrews 5:9; 1 John 1:9)    12) If we love Him, we will keep His commandments, because He first loved us (1 John 4:19; John 14:15)    ADDITION: What you say of the 4th commandment, however you treat it, you must say and treat the other 9 commandments the same. I would ask Hogie if  s/he uses double speak if s/he believes one can commit murder or worship other gods and still expect to be saved. Can you go around murdering people and still be saved? If not, then Hogie is just as guilty of the doublespeak that s/he accuses others of.|`|AA10674998	There will be alot of people who have obeyed the Sabbath and kept it holy who are not welcome at the feast, for they are among those who have rejected Christ's life as Salvation.

Salvation is to those who put their belief/faith/trust in Christ.     The law, including the sabbath, has nothing to do with the gospel, and salvation.    So to answer your question regarding your salvation status with God, I must ask you a question.  What happens to you should you fail to keep the sabbath? That is, what if you, personally, quit keeping the sabbath?  Are you still saved?  Is your faith enough to save you?      I have seen a lot of sabbath keepers use a lot of double talk in this regard.  Most all actually believe that if they quit keeping the sabbath, then they sin willfully, and lose their salvation.  So even though they say they don't keep the sabbath in order to be saved, they actually believe they do indeed have to keep the sabbath for the sake of salvation.    So what of you?  What if you decide you are not going to keep the sabbath any more?|`|9mLjDa5kaa	Neither.

If I chose not to observe it, I would not get the blessings.    20 There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated     21 And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated.

And that's not all. My evidence is that I've experienced the light within myself during meditation. Again, this is enough evidence for me, but probably not for you.    I think that since the world is imperfect, and we know it's imperfect, there must be some idea of perfection, and I believe God is what this idea of perfection represents. This is enough evidence for me, but it might not be enough for you.    I think that the origin of all material things is immaterial, and even though nothing created this immateriality it is not nothing but the creator.     To me these are all logical, scientific pieces of evidence that allow me to believe in a God, they might not be enough for you, but just because you don't believe it don't say there is no shred of evidence. There is literal thousands if not millions of pieces of evidence if you only open your mind a little to the possibility.    I can go on: nature has cycles, these cycles don't happen randomly but by some cosmic law. To me, that is scientific evidence that there is a God that controls the universe.     People do bad things and sometimes the exact same bad thing happens to them and they learn how awful it is. This is scientific evidence of karma, which is also evidence that a knowing God orders all things.    People can be depressed for no reason at all, but when they start to become interested in life, spirituality, God, they become happy. This is enough reason to believe in God.    To me these are all scientific pieces of evidence to believe in God. Maybe not for you, but for me. All I'm trying to do is share with you my shreds of evidence. It's up to you to analyze them. If in the end you find no substantial pieces of evidence I guess you'll never believe in God.

The logical question should be Is there evidence...    However, you are absolutely correct when you note that something has to be true first before you can have faith!    Too often people have blind faith which is actually no faith or dead faith. Even religions and Bible dictionaries commonly promote this type of useless faith in their members. People like this usually respond with personal emotional arguments like: God gives faith to me. Or they put the blame on you for not just accepting their personal experience. Many times they even admit that their faith has no proof without even seeing the extreme danger this is (Col.2:8).    "We cannot live on probabilities. The faith in which we can live bravely and die in peace must be a certainty, or it is nothing.--Froude    "Faith must have adequate evidence, else it is mere superstition."--A.A. Hodge    When someone says "I don't care what people say, I still have faith" its usually because he faces objections to his beliefs that he cannot answer. This is simply credulity, i.e., willingness to believe things without basis (2Cor 11:4).    But, this is not true faith and it is not the faith that God spoke about in the Bible!      The Biblical definition of faith is found in Hebrews 11:1 though it is many times misunderstood. The RSV reads: Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen. Comparing other translations can give us a greater understanding of the original Greek words:    Rotherhams: But faith is, of things hoped for, a confidence, of facts, a conviction, when they are not seen.    NLT: "What is faith? It is the confident assurance that what we hope for is going to happen. It is the evidence of things we cannot yet see."    NWT: Faith is the assured expectation of things hoped for, the evident demonstration of realities though not beheld. 2 For by means of this the men of old times had witness borne to them.    Three original words are of importance here: Faith, assurance, and conviction.    Faith is translated from the Greek word PI'STIS. It primarily conveys the thought of confidence, trust, firm persuasion.  The Hebrew word from the familiar root AMAN. It indicates something that has been made firm, verified by strong evidence.    Assurance translates the word HYPOSTASIS which literally means "standing under," like a solid foundation holding up a building. It conveys the idea of solid proof." This term is used in ancient business records of a written guarantee. That is why one Bible translator rendered this as "the title-deed of things hoped for."  The title deed is convincing evidence that the property exists and that it really belongs to you, even though you may never have seen it.    "Evident demonstration" is from ELEGKHOS, a word which conveys the idea of presenting evidence which clearly demonstrates that something is real. It means proof, or evidence which convinces another.    You will notice that in the biblical use there is no suggestion of doubt or "a belief without evidence." It is not a faculty of second sight, a mysterious intuition into the spiritual world. Faith is based on provable evidence, therefore the person with true faith can readily give us convincing evidence for what he believes.    Faith is not really unusual. Scientists show faith in unseen "laws of nature" because of evidence. Pilots must have faith in their instruments and ignore their senses and what they see when flying in clouds. We have faith that the sun is going to rise in the east tomorrow before we see it because weve seen it so many times and all of mankinds written history provides evidence.    Faith is the result of teaching Rom. 10:14-17 and knowledge is a vital element; God has given us understanding or intellectual capacity so we can gain knowledge (1Jn. 5:20). Accurate knowledge (EPIGNOSIS) is needed (Col.1:9; Php. 1:8-10; 1 Tim.2:4).      When it comes to the creator, we have solid bricks of evidence that he exists.    Hebrews 3:4 gives us a basic logical principal: Every house, of course, is built by someone-and God is the one who has built all things.    We may not have seen anyone build our house, but we have no doubt that it was build by a human because of the evidence in its design. If I insisted that some building just happened by accident or through some blind act of nature youd say I was crazy. Yet, the creation around us is so much more precise in its design. Still, people want us to believe it just happened without a designer?  A house requires a builder. This fundamental, incontestable principle applies at every level of matter. Whether you're discussing the universe or the smallest particle of matter, this principle still applies! If it has a design there must be a designer.    "From the infinitely large to the infinitesimally small, from galactic clusters to atoms, the universe is characterized by superb organization. We cannot get around it: Superb organization requires a superb organizer."    "Faith in order, which is the basis of science, cannot reasonably be separated from faith in an ordainer, which is the basis of religion."--Asa Gray    In a persons creation, we can even see evidence of the builders qualities. This is why Romans 1:20-22 says: Ever since the creation of the world, the invisible existence of God and his everlasting power have been clearly seen by the minds understanding of created things. And so these people have no excuse:  they knew God and yet they did not honour him as God or give thanks to him, but their arguments became futile and their uncomprehending minds were darkened.

If history has shown me anything it is that it is way to easy to start a religion.    Evolution though is a scientific theory. It requires no supernatural intervention to make it work. It prescribes no moral code, has no ritual, liturgy or ceremony. All the things necessary to make it a religion are absent. All such things would need to be invented and would be utterly superfluous from a scientific point of view. Anyway, good luck starting a cult around this.

Es como cuando sos peque y tus padres te dicen "no toques" y vos vas y rompes. A mi por lo menos me nalgueaban.  Adan y Eva desobedecieron porque creyeron que comiendo ese fruto serian como Dios. Pecaron de soberbia, ademas de encapricharse con ese arbol cuando tenian el mundo para disfrutar.    Es solo un mito para explicar el pecado, no paso en realidad.

Eva corrompio a Adan, seducida por las virtudes que el Diablo le dijo que obtendria al revelarse a Dios y comer del fruto simbolico prohibido, la animo a revelarse porque le dijo que se convertiria en un igual a Dios con solo comerlo y que esta negativa unica de no comer de dicho fruto era porque este era el origen de la sabiduria Divina. Eva, como no conocia aun la maldad sintio curiosidad, efusividad y se dejo tentar, aun comiendo el fruto prohibido no peco, peco cuando a travez de haber adquirido CONOCIMIENTOS no sabiduria INSTO  a Adan a comer tambien, ESTE FUE EL PECADO Y POR ESO LAS MUJERES SON JODIDAS PORQUE MANIPULAN Y LO SABEN, ambos adquirieron conocimientos sobre muchisimas cosas, y se descubrieron desnudos, hambrientos de deseos lujuriosos o no, y cohibidos porque se encontraban desnudos ante Dios, aprendieron a desear lo que no necesitan y a creer en la razon sin intentar vislumbrar la virtud de la verdad.  Ante tanto conocimiento y ante tanta falta de verdad y humildad Dios no pudo permitir que ese lugar deseado para la raza humana sea invadido por ordas de Destruccion y los desterro hasta que pudiesen aprender que el camino al Eden es el camino a la verdad y el abandono de la razon.  Hoy ese camino no se ha transitado ni un 30%, seguimos atados a la logica y la razon, abandonando la busqueda de la verdad y la humildad.|`|c999fb639626f06acda43c48d8eec545aa	Adan y Eva pecaron porque tuvieron libre albedrio para hacerlo, o sea ellos tomaron la decision de fallarle a Dios.  Cuando Dios lo creo le dio responsabilidades, cumplieron sus responsabilidades hasta que se aparecio la serpiente en el jardin del eden y los desafio a que fueran como dioses y desobedecieran al Senor.   Todo empezo con un simple dialogo, la mujer se intereso por el dialogo y empezo a hacer preguntas, preguntas que trajeron duda a la mente de la mujer y estas dudas la llevaron a tomar de la fruta del arbol prohibido, mas adelante vemos las consecuencias de la desobediencia de esta mujer.   Comio del arbol prohibido, le dio a su marido y el resultado es la mancha del pecado que tenemos hoy en dia.   Por esa desobediencia entro al mundo, el primer poligamo, buscalo en la biblia, el primer crimen, buscalo en la biblia y un alejamiento de Dios hasta que surgio otra generacion que empezo a buscar a Dios.

En un principio Adn y Eva no tenan por qu pecar (ni conocan qu era eso). Lo tenan todo, perfeccin, salud, eternidad, etc.    La razn del pecado fue un ngel creado por Dios que se revel contra l, tena envidia de Dios. Por eso, decidi planear una tctica para hacer "tropezar" a la primera pareja humana para que se revelaran contra Dios y lo adoraran a l en vez de a Dios. Us una tctica muy cobarde, pues se hizo pasar por una serpiente, y calumniadora, se dedic a desmentir lo que les dijo Dios a Adn y Eva. Primero habl con Eva y le dijo:    "?Es realmente el caso que Dios ha dicho a ustedes no deben comer de todo rbol del jardn?" (Gnesis 3:1)    Tras tratar de hacer dudar a Eva y sta contestara correctamente (lo que Dios les dijo que hicieran) dijo la supuesta serpiente:    "Positivamente no morirn. Porque Dios sabe que el mismo da que coman de l (el rbol prohibido) tendrn que abrrseles los ojos y tendrn que ser como Dios, conociendo lo bueno y lo malo". (Gnesis 3: 4-5)    Tras hacer tambalear a Eva pas a la accin y calumni a Dios diciendo todo lo contrario de lo que dijo l. Eva le crey y acept el ardiz de aquel ngel desviado (despus llamado Diablo y Satans), comi del fruto de aquel rbol. Adn, acto seguido, tambin apoy el ardiz y comi tambin del fruto de aquel rbol.    De aqu sacamos varias conclusiones:    1a. El origen del pecado vino de un ngel que se desvi aposta de la direccin de Dios y no de una serpiente.    2a. Adn y Eva no slo fueron enga?ados sino que apoyaron la trampa del Diablo, por tanto, su pecado fue a sabiendas.    3a. El origen del pecado tiene una teora, y es, cuestionar la soberana de Dios sobre la Tierra y sus sbditos y que nos ira mejor sin Dios que con Dios. Ya vemos el resultado...    Desde que Dios no rige su Autoridad sobre la Tierra, el ser humano  y el planeta Tierra han ido de mal en peor, guerras, odio, hipocresa, hambre, corrupcin, etc. Y se sigue apoyando (entre ellos estn los ateos) que sin Dios estamos mejor, no necesitamos a Dios para nada, y la realidad, es bastante elocuente. No merecemos ni conducir nuestro paso.    Adn y Eva pecaron porque apoyaron y creyeron que sin Dios nos iran mejor las cosas, tendramos conocimiento de todo (lo bueno y lo malo), seramos como Dios, perfectos, inmortales, etc. Pero realmente no fue , ni es as. Dios dijo que moriran y as fue, conocimiento de lo bueno y de lo malo s, pero a cambio, enfermedad, vejez, muerte y pecado es lo que contrajeron, Y es lo que toda la humanidad hemos heredado, al no nacer nadie perfecto, sin pecado, no hay nadie que se salve de enfermedad y la muerte.     Hoy en da la mayora de la humanidad sigue apoyando el ardiz del Diablo, diciendo que sin Dios estamos bien, que no nos hace falta, que creer en l es un cuento, que es mentira, que no existe, etc, etc, etc. Y mira como estamos, sin paz, con amenazar de guerras, incluso de guerras nucleares, hay odio, falta de respeto, hambres, despreocupacin, etc. No estamos seguros, los hombres nunca a lo largo de la historia a sido capaz de traer la paz.    Esto es el verdadero significado del pecado original, y que desgraciadamente, por aquel suceso, el planeta, la humanidad, sufre. Hasta que Dios no intervenga nada de todo lo que nos aflige se va a solucionar. Por eso, la importancia de mantenerse limpio (en la medida de lo posible por nuestra imperfeccin) de este mundo pecaminoso y estar limpios a los ojos de Dios y nos acepte y nos deje con vida.    Saludos.|`|a71a745341a1ff0bcc0475fa38bf6389aa	Te envo informacin seria sobre el tema y con base bblica.    La sublevacin en Edn. La voluntad de Dios dada a conocer a Adn y a su esposa era ante todo positiva, pues enumeraba cosas que tenan que hacer. (G 1:26-29; 2:15.) Adn recibi un solo mandato prohibitorio: no?comer (ni siquiera tocar) del rbol del conocimiento de lo bueno y lo malo. (G 2:16,?17; 3:2,?3.) La prueba de obediencia y devocin que Dios le puso al hombre se destaca por el respeto que mostr a su dignidad. Con ella Dios no?le atribuy a Adn nada malo; no?utiliz como prueba la prohibicin de cometer, por ejemplo, bestialidad, asesinato ni ninguna otra accin vil o degradada similar. Dios saba que Adn no?tena inclinaciones depravadas. El comer era normal, apropiado, y a Adn se le haba dicho que [comiese] hasta quedar satisfecho de lo que Dios le haba dado. (G 2:16.) De modo que Dios prob a Adn al prohibirle comer del fruto de este rbol en concreto, y as convirti su ingestin en un smbolo del conocimiento que permita decidir por uno mismo lo que era bueno y lo que era malo para el hombre. Por consiguiente, Dios no?le impuso ninguna penalidad a Adn ni le atribuy nada que desmereciera su dignidad como hijo humano de Dios.    La mujer fue el primer ser humano que pec. La tentacin a la que la someti el adversario de Dios, quien utiliz a una serpiente como medio de comunicacin (vase PERFECCIN [El primer pecador y el rey de Tiro]), no?consisti en un llamamiento abierto a la inmoralidad de naturaleza sensual. Ms bien, haca gala de ser un llamamiento al deseo de una supuesta elevacin intelectual y libertad. En primer lugar el tentador hizo que Eva repitiese la ley de Dios, que debi haberle transmitido su esposo, y despus atac la veracidad y la bondad de Dios. Asever que el comer el fruto del rbol prohibido no?resultara en muerte, sino en iluminacin y aptitud como la de Dios para determinar por uno mismo lo que era bueno o malo. Esa declaracin revela que en aquel tiempo el corazn del tentador estaba completamente alejado de su Creador, pues sus palabras constituyeron una clara contradiccin de lo que Dios haba dicho y una calumnia disimulada contra l. No?acus a Dios de haberse equivocado inconscientemente, sino de tergiversar deliberadamente las cosas, al decir: Porque Dios sabe?[...]. Cuando se analizan los mtodos rebajados que utiliz este espritu para lograr sus fines, convirtindose en un mentiroso y enga?ador, en un asesino impulsado por su ambicin, puede verse la gravedad del pecado y la naturaleza detestable de su desamor, pues obviamente conoca las fatales consecuencias de lo que le estaba proponiendo a Eva. (G 3:1-5; Jn 8:44.)    Como muestra el relato, el deseo impropio empez a obrar en la mujer. En lugar de reaccionar con completa repugnancia y justa indignacin por ponerse en duda la justicia de la ley de Dios, lleg a mirar al rbol como algo deseable. Codici lo que correctamente le perteneca a Jehov Dios como su Soberano: su aptitud y prerrogativa de determinar lo que es bueno y lo que es malo para sus criaturas. De este modo, empezaba a conformarse a los caminos, las normas y la voluntad del opositor, que contradeca abiertamente a su Creador y a su cabeza nombrado por Dios, su esposo. (1Co 11:3.) Confiada en las palabras del tentador, se dej seducir, comi del fruto y as puso de manifiesto el pecado que haba nacido en su corazn y en su mente. (G 3:6; 2Co 11:3; comprese con Snt 1:14,?15; Mt 5:27,?28.)    Ms tarde, cuando Eva le ofreci el fruto a Adn, este tom de l. El apstol muestra que el pecado del hombre difiri del de su esposa en el sentido de que Adn no?fue enga?ado por la propaganda del tentador, y por consiguiente no?hizo ningn caso de la alegacin de que poda comerse del rbol con impunidad.

AA10774435	Tarot, palmistry, and other such divination tools are not religiously specific.    Many people of many different religions, as well as people without religion, participate in divination in different ways. You do not have to be a part of any particular religion to use divination.    Wicca has only been around for a little over 50 years. While the religions upon which the foundations of Wicca are based are among the oldest known religions, Wicca is incredibly new. Divination, also, has been around for a long time in many different forms throughout the ages.    There is even divination present in the bible (and not just when it condemns it): http://www.religioustolerance.org/divin_...    Feel free to explore divination in all forms, in full knowledge that it holds no specific attachment to any religion. Divination is not religious; it is occultic.|`|KRJKRglOaa	I don't know much about palmistry, but Tarot, I have a talent for.    Personally I feel that religion is relative, that your connection with God, is personal and no one should tell you what and how it should be.  People may quote the Bible, but I view the Bible as a reference, and a fallible book, as it was written and rewritten by man, and in some cases, hundreds of years after the events described took place.    Use your own judgment, if you think that reading tarot cards is evil, that it probably won't settle well with you.  But remember they are just cards, you can use them for entertainment, or for spiritual purposes.    I personally view reading tarot cards as speaking to a higher power, it gives me focus and draws attention to things in my life that I might not be considering.  Who answers the cards, well, I believe friendly spirits, it could be angels.      There are several decks, you should pick one that speaks to you.  In essence one that seems to make sense to you.  Don't just pick a deck because its pretty.  I own four decks, all of which have never let met down.  I tried to use my sister's deck, and I never received a good reading.    A deck that might work for you, and ease your mind is the Medieval Scarapini Deck, (I own this one) instead of the High Priest and the High Priestess, it contains the Pope and the Popess, and other Christian references.  Another deck, would be the Rider Waite deck, this is a generic deck which all others are based on.|`|AA11025703	Hi.  The Bible tells us in 1Corinthians 1-5 things to turn away from.  Spiritistic pratices is in the list.|`|0f35e35fc374dea3ca1e2b585d13080caa	you got to be able to think for yourself, my guess is your a christian cause it is how you were raised to believe, your almost an adult think for yourself, and if you get into readings just dont focus on the bad stuff|`|AA11572478	1. It's spelled "Wiccan"    2. I'm a teen too, and tarot cards and stuff are actually part of religion. To really get the full effect of it and to avoid bad karma you'd most likely have to convert or something. It's not unholy to be interested in it, but you can't have the full effect without being fully attatched to it.|`|9fa1adb1c8a5e488f13a34915c1381ceaa	The christians on here are going to tell you its unholy, and 'of the devil' and all that. I say, think for yourself. Maybe pick up a deck in the store. Do you get anything from it? Do the cards seem to "speak" to you? Do you feel unholy?    I am always opposed to allowing anyone else to do my thinking for me, but maybe thats just me. Seems to be alot of people who enjoy it.    Edit - nygiants, please learn something about Wicca before you claim to be an authority on the subject. It is not required to convert to anything to experiment with a Tarot deck and there will be no bad karma for her if she tries it. Tarot decks were around long before the Wiccan religion. Sheesh.|`|AA11087869	If you are a Christian this would be going aginst God. All forms of divination or fortune telling are. I know its really interesting and seems like harmless fun but thats how Satan pulls you away. Look up Deuteronomy 18:10-12      Deuteronomy 18:10?There should not be found in you anyone who makes his son or his daughter pass through the fire, anyone who employs divination, a practicer of magic or anyone who looks for omens or a sorcerer, 11?or one who binds others with a spell or anyone who consults a spirit medium or a professional foreteller of events or anyone who inquires of the dead. 12?For everybody doing these things is something detestable to Jehovah, and on account of these detestable things Jehovah your God is driving them away from before you.

2TGSjrxPaa	1) I think most peopl prefer the spelling Muhammad, simply because it gives a more accurate pronounciation. Mohammad is the English Translation.    2) Quran and Qur'an are the same, but Qur'an is closer to the arabic pronounciation again. Koran is English translation, pronounciation of the word.    3) History? Imam Anwar Al-Awlaki has some good lectures:    Towards the bottom are the more history based lectures. I prefer to listen this why I recommend:    http://www.salaattime.com/anwar.html    Salaam    @abuyeshua: if the links you posted are not propaganda, I don't know what is.

I just choose to believe in God and Jesus.---- I don't need to know every thing about a car to drive one. -- I don't need to know everything about computers to type this anwer. --- I don't need to know anything about God and Jesus to believe in God and Jesus . my choice I believe.=== of course if I was born in India and a hindu I believe I would be a good one== of course I probably would not feed you . You know would not want to mess up your Karma. And I believe, if I was born a Sikh, or Muslim or born a Buddist I would be a good one. I really really really really really really believe in God and no matter what I would believe. I would join a religion to look for him. However I personally believe Jesus of Nazareth was and is who he said he was. The holy one of God.

Renditions were migrated to Greek, Jan, Buddhist and Bahai faiths.  However, theological frameworks were not developed until eleven centuries after the death, burial and Resurrection of Jesus Christ.  This is when Krishna's death, burial and re-birth (not resurrection) scenarios were first intimatedmost probably a result of Christ's story.

Since the prophesies regarding the coming of Jesus were in place long before Attis of Phrygia, one could just as easily ask if Attis of Phrygia was an attempt to counterfeit based on that prophesy.  The question is does Attis fulfill the messianic prophesies?  Jesus did.  The first of those prophesies was that the messiah would be born in Bethlehem.  Start there and compare the life of Attis to the more than 100 prophesies.  See the links below regarding these prophesies.|`|fxHEZGcCaa	Greetings,    The claim that the Bible accounts and teachings were not original but instead simply borrowed from pre-existing traditions and myths is a common one. This claim is usually made by critics to combat the overwhelming evidence that the Bible was directly inspired by God.    The example you cite from the Anacalypsis is a good example of the exaggerations, oversimplifications and outright untruthfulness of many of these claims. Here is a quote from James Patrick Holdings Techtonics web site and his paper on Krishna Unconsciousness parts 1&2:    In fairness, however, one purported similarity needs to be discredited. Skeptics sometimes cite Kersey Graves in Sixteen Crucified Saviors or Godfrey Higgin's Anacalypsis (which Graves drew from) in asserting that Krishna was a crucified deity. No such event occurred in the Gita or in any recognized Hindu scripture. Given the pronounced syncretic tendency of Hinduism, it is safe to assume that any odd tales of Krishna's being crucified arose only after the existence of Christian proselytism, in imitation of the Christian narrative. It is neither authentic to Hinduism nor is Hinduism the source of that portion of the Christian narrative. The same may be said for most of the purported nativity stories. In my opinion, both Higgins and Graves are highly unreliable sources and should be ignored.    Holding also says: One frequently encounters scholars who first use Christian  terminology to describe pagan beliefs and practices, and then marvel at  the striking parallels they think they have discovered. One can go a  long way toward "proving" early Christian dependence on the mysteries by  describing some mystery belief or practice in Christian terminology...Exaggerations and oversimplifications abound in this kind of  literature. One encounters overblown claims about alleged likenesses  between baptism and the Lord's Supper and similar "sacraments" in certain  mystery cults...The mere fact that Christianity has a sacred meal and a  washing of the body is supposed to prove that it borrowed these ceremonies  from similar meals and washings in the pagan cults. By themselves, of  course, such outward similarities prove nothing. After all,  religious ceremonies can assume only a limited number of forms, and they  will naturally relate to important or common aspects of human life. The  more important question is the meaning of the pagan practices.    Here are some excerpt from several articles in the Watchtower Magazine: 10/1/90 Archaeology Confirms the Bible, 4/15/62 The BibleAuthentic and Inspired, 2/1/61 The Ten Commandmentsof God, Not Men.    Then we have similar Bible critics who claim that Moses plagiarized the Code of Hammurabi. Disproving this accusation, W. J. Martin writes in the book Documents from Old Testament Times:    Despite many resemblances, there is no ground for assuming any direct borrowing by the Hebrew from the Babylonian. Even where the two sets of laws differ little in the letter, they differ much in the spirit. For example, in the Hammurabi Code, theft and receiving stolen goods were punished by the death penalty (Laws 6 and 22), but in Israels laws the punishment was compensation. (Ex. 22:1; Lev. 6:1-5) Whereas the Mosaic law forbade handing over an escaped slave to his master (Deut. 23:15, 16), the Babylonian laws punished by death anyone taking in a fugitive slave.Laws 15, 16, 19.    In the Supplment au Dictionnaire de la Bible, French Orientalist Joseph Plessis wrote: It does not appear that the Hebrew legislator made any use of the various codes of Babylonia and Assyria. Nothing in his work can be proved to have been borrowed. Although there are interesting similarities, they are not such that they cannot easily be explained by the codifying of customs shared by people with a common origin.    In this connection a statement by Philip Biberfeld, a rabbi, in his Universal Jewish History, is of interest: The Code of Hammurabi, the Hittite Laws, and the Biblical Laws contained in the Book of the Covenant and other parts of the Bible go back to a common source which is best preserved in the Bible where it has retained its original simplicity . . . The common source that can be traced in all these codes is identical with the Noahidic Laws which, according to the tradition, were the inheritance of all mankind. In the Book of the Covenant this original divine law was promulgated again with the modifications of Biblical legislation . . . All this establishes beyond any doubt the conviction that the simple and lucid formulations of the Bible were not the product of an artificial process of elimination but those of the original version in all their purity and simplicity. This conclusion has implications which extend far beyond the realm of these ancient legislations. It has a decisive bearing on all those instances where the pure and beautiful Biblical traditions are confronted by mythological parallels with all their ugly distortions.Pages 153, 154.    So instead of godly law and order being drawn from Hammurabis code or other pagan codes, it seems to have been the other way around. Sir Charles Marston, on page 51 of his book The Bible Comes Alive, says: It seems certain that Hammurabis laws were a codification of the older and existing laws and customs of the Semitic Racethe race that sprung from Noahs son Shem, the race to which the Hebrews belonged. The evidence is, therefore, that heathen nations carried over many ancient laws and customs from the Noachian system of law and order, which pattern the faithful Hebrew patriarchs followed.      Now, there are some things which Christendom did borrowed from pagan sources and then were read back into the Bible.    Many of the fundamental doctrines of Christendom are based not on the Bible but on ancient m
e6brEEbOaa	The Bible teaches us that homosexuality is a small part of a very big tent called sexual immorality.    Heterosexuality is a sin in the context of fornication and adultery.    If Heterosexuality can be a sin in a certain context, then how can we ever abide in the idea that homosexuality can not be a sin in any context?  This of course does not make sense.    God's provision is that we have sexual relationships within the bonds of marriage.  Desires that go beyond that provision are declarations that God's provision is not good enough for us.  It is like saying that we want more than what God wants us to have.    And of course when we think this way, we are moving away from god and His provision.  And that road, away from God, goes on forever.      Hope that helps.|`|DzKRDQL2aa	According to the Song of God homosexuality is neither sinful nor degenerate.

Restrain therefore, my children, such judgments as others would lay against the homosexual; for they judge most harshly the things they know not of; being in themselves empty of God; possessing neither understanding nor wisdom, being in themselves without mercy or consideration for the ways of others.  ~2nd Endowment 4:53|`|ncXMA6rsaa	I think they should treat it like they treat heterosexuality.

1zUEg2mlaa	the answer is NO! In the ten commandements God was referring to the false gods or idols that people worship!  such as baal or the golden calf...these were things that mankind made and then worshipped them as "gods".    there is only one true God|`|OIAODVcHaa	The word "gods" is mentioned several times in the bible. But by gods, he meant the kind created by people. In Exodus 32, God's people created a calf out of gold and worshipped it.  In Deuteronomy 6:13, " Fear the LORD your God, serve him only and take your oaths in his name."  What he means is that we create Gods. If we serve other objects, we are idolaters, be it people, statues, or a pile of gold.|`|4Vt20nvoaa	No Go does not believe this.  He knew that people would create their own gods or idols.  You can read in this same area of the Bible about the golden calf.  There is no golden calf god.  It was something the people made up to fill a void.  There are also idols which are things that people put before God in their lives.  A modern example would be TV or Sports.  These things can be our gods if we let them get in the way of our relationship with the one true God.|`|fxHEZGcCaa	Greetings,    This is an interesting and logical question. As you note the implication of the words is that there are other gods. What we have to keep in mind is how the appellation god was use at the time the Bible was written, not how it is used today.    Today, when we use the word God we are usually referring to the one true almighty God. Very rarely we may see it used qualitatively as in Michael Jordan is god. This is rare because although we know that it is being used in the sense that hes better than his peers, it borders on blasphemy in our culture.    This was not the case in Bible times nor in most historical periods. Any Bible dictionary will give you the same meaning of the word God (ELOHIM/QEOS) that Strongs Lexicon does: great, mighty ones, rulers, judges, divine ones, angels. In the KJV the original word is translated as God, god, mighty, great, judge, and angel.    The definition in the BDB Hebrew lexicon is: "a.) rulers, judges, either as divine representatives or as reflecting divine majesty and power...including...angels." And the Theological Wordbook of the O.T. reads: "The primary meanings of this root as used in Scripture are "god," "God," and less frequently, "the mighty" (referring to men or angels)."    So, we find the Psalms saying that God stands in the assembly of God; He judges in the midst of the gods.--LIT    This is Almighty Gods divine assembly and it says He is in the midst of gods. These gods are obviously not false gods since they are part of the divine assembly or Gods congregation. This is just one of the instances where angels are called god in the bible.    Further, in the Scriptures others were properly called gods without according them the status of Almighty God in the strict sense. In the Bible this title was used of men, angels, Moses, Paul and Satan: (Ex. 4:16; 7:1; 21:6; 22:8-9, 28; Ps. 8:5/Heb. 2:8; Ps. 82:1,6; 97:7; 136:2; 138:1; Jn.10:34; 2Cor.4:4). At Psalm 45:6,7 it calls a human King, probably Solomon, "God."    Its meaning is the same in every case; that these individuals share some quality as a god or a mighty person in relation to others around them. So while this does not put these individuals down on the same level as false gods, it still does not mean that there are other Gods equal to the Almighty. Therefore, this in no way contradicts the monotheistic concept of a Supreme Deity as taught in the Bible (Isa.44:6-8). This is because the sense of "god" is relative. Humans and angels are correctly called "god," but they still have Jehovah God over them. The term "god" simply means someone who is over others in some capacity.    So Biblical monotheism allows others to be called god with no connotation that they be a false god. Ps. 45:6, as translated in the majority of bibles, shows that two Gods can be referred to: "Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever. ... therefore, thy God hath anointed Thee." The King is called "god" yet he manifestly has a greater God--the Almighty--over him.    Notice the footnote on Ps.45:6 in the NAB: "Your throne, O god: the Hebrew king was called ELOHIM, God' not in the polytheistic sense common among the ancient pagans, but as meaning god-like'. Cf Ps. 58, 2; 82, 1, 6."    The NET Bible footnote on Isa.9:6: "(mighty God)...Others argue that the title portrays the king as God's representative...Ps 45:6 addresses the Davidic king as "God" because he ruled and fought as God's representative on earth...When the king's enemies oppose him on the battlefield, they are, as it were, fighting against God himself."    So this brings us to Christ Jesus and what it means when he is called QEOS in the NT. Hebrews 1:8,9 gives us a clear understanding when it applies Ps.45:6 to Jesus because it clearly limits Christ being called God to a representative sense and in a position less than Almighty God. This is because it states that Jesus still has a God over him: therefore God, your God, has set you above your companions. ALMIGHTY God cannot have a God! Yet Jesus has a God over him at every period of his existence (Mic.5:4, Jn 14:28; 20:17; Rom.15:6; 1Cor 15:28; Rev.3:12). Before he came to earth Jesus was less than Almighty God, while he was on earth he was less than Almighty God and after he is in heaven and as high as he will ever get he is still less than Almighty God     So while Jesus is called god several times in the N.T., over a dozen times the Scriptures explicitly state that he has a God over him. And every time Jesus is called god the context always shows that Jesus is separated from and less than the Eternal, Almighty God.    Karl Rahner, the eminent Roman Catholic theologian, considers that there are reliable applications of "THEOS" to Christ in six texts. Rahner, however, immediately goes on the say that in none of these instances is "THEOS" used in such a manner as to identify Jesus with the Supreme God.--Theological Investigations (1961), pp.135ff.    "It is not that Jesus is God. Time and time again the Fourth Gospel speaks of God sending Jesus into the world. Time and time again we see Jesus praying to God....Nowhere does the New Testament identify Jesus with God."From "William Barclay; A Spiritual Autobiography," (Grand Rapids, Michigan: Eerdmans), pp. 49, 50:    When Jesus is called god in Jn.1:1 the grammar shows that it is a predicate nominative describing a quality about Jesus, not an identification of him as Almighty God. This is clear when the context twice states that Jesus is WITH God (Greek: The God). So we have two beings both who are called God *with* each other. The Trinity doctrine does not allow for God being with God since the three are only one God. The text is not saying that the Word was the same as the God who he was with but, rather, that the Word was godlike|`|VELnLnIKaa	THERE IS NO OTHER GOD WORSHIP ME AND ONLY ME lol what an ego that joker had are you questioning me? i will smit you lol|`|U4V6TkZEaa	Anything can be your "god" if you consider it to be important enough (beer, sex, money, etc.).

Every nation had their own deity and usually pantheon of gods.  So, God was warning not to go after these other false gods.  There is no genuine gods but the God you are asking about but, there are other things that were created to be gods (idols, etc.).  It also is declaring who or what should be foremost in the lives of God's people.|`|93fc57ca1c692acd2bd8f1bc7a446e6eaa	Nice perception.  It is true, He is the only God with which we need concern ourselves.  So, to us, He is our Lord and God and we need place no others before Him.  However, as you clearly discerned, there are others like Him that do not pertain to us.  There is a saying that states, as man is, God once was, and as God is, man may become.  That is called the law of eternal progression.  Christ said we could become joint heirs with Him in all that the Father has, inheriting His Kingdom.  That means that we can become like Him.  It follows that He became like He is through progressive stages as well.  We will never catch up with Him because as we progress, so is He continuing to progress through us.  Behold, this is my work and my glory to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.  So said God to Moses.  Thus, He clearly states that He gains pleasure and glory through our progress.  Likewise, as He progressed, He also had a Father that gloried in His progress.  I know this turns the world of traditional christianity on its head, but the gospel is not as mysterious as they would like us to believe.  If we take an eternal perspective on things, it all makes wonderful sense.  God has equals that take care of their own realms and someday, if we are faithful, we will have realms to care for as well.  However, for now, He is the one God that pertains to our mortal existence.|`|J7KSKm54aa	We can't get nothing past you.|`|JyAUAbsjaa	There is only one God, he just wants us to know that.

In the New Testament, there are mention of gods and lords (1 Corinthians 8).    Given that evidence, I'd say yes.    Just the fact that "thous shalt have no other gods before me" is also strong evidence.    Whether those "other" gods and lords are significant or not is really on our shoulders. If we place other gods (including material things that can take the place of God) before God, then that is a problem, as far as God is concerned . . . for us.    Paul's statement to the Corinthians (1 Cor 8) that for us, there is _one_ God clears it all up. It really doesn't matter, as long as we have only _one_ God. Not, by the way, the Trinity, since Paul separates Jesus and counts him as the _one_ Lord.    Thumbs down expected from Trinitarians.|`|tdNaZ9qAaa	People in the first centurylike many todayworshiped those who are called gods, whether in heaven or on earth.

However, There is only one true God, the only one deserving of praise and the only one from which all things exist (1 corinthians 8:5-6)  Ex: anyone can be a God right? If you are worshiped because of your fame (Michael jackson, beyonce) money ( bill gates, trump) or because you give hope (obama, Dr. king, Muhammad) then that person/image becomes your God, thats what the true God meant, that no other God or possesion should come before Him.|`|dFBccLExaa	He probably does, I think he just wants all of the people on earth for himself.

Por otro lado, creo que son inocentes, dios los creo con cierto grado de curiosidad, si dios los hubiera hecho mas obedientes, probablemente seguirian viviendo en el mismo lugar, me parece que es el precio que pagaron por haber recibido el regalo del libre albedrio.|`|0e15945497b3758f6aaff2df97f70f57aa	Habria primero que revisar esa ley absurda de "no comer del fruto prohibido".   1. Esa una ley ridicula y sin sentido, que no tiene nada que ver con el "bien" y el "mal".  2. El "bien" y el "mal", segun la biblia, consite en cumplir los caprichos de dios : se trata solamente de lo que es bueno o malo para dios y no para los demas. Dios es egoista, tirano y por lo tanto injusto, lo que se nota en sus leyes.  3. La desnudez no tiene nada malo. Muchos pueblos (tribus) viven desnudos, debido al clima, lo que es logico.  4. Adan y Eva tenian un deber ? Trabajaban para dios ? Dios nunca les dio un sueldo. Y no se puede considerar el "paraiso" y la comida como un pago, ni la obediencia como un trabajo. Ademas dios habiendo creado a esos 2 seres, el era el responsable del bienestar de estos. Tenia por lo tanto la obligacion de alimentarlos y darles un lugar para dormir, sin reclamar nada a cambio.

AA11448669	Letting go of fear and trusting my Heavenly Father and believing that I am actually LOVED unconditionally.     It is only human to feel unworthy, self-critical, distrusting, doubtful etc. In addition many of us were taught that we somehow have to EARN God's love, which is impossible! You cannot earn a gift.     We also expect judgement and punishment all the time so we keep fault finding in ourselves and in others. Letting go of that is very hard.     I think this is exactly why it is so hard to accept God's love and trust him completely because we cannot believe it can be THAT easy! All the liberation! All the undeserved love! It scares people, me included. I think, "Surely it must come with strings attached."    We have come to expect harshness and judgement at every turn. We do it to ourselves and others and assume God is just as petty and preoccupied with our hang-ups as we are.|`|GiO60X62aa	To love my enemy and forgiveness to those who do not regret the harm they've done....They're not impossible for me,but they're both a continuing work in progress.I am working on them.|`|d8530e798fb043e36f4872c4f333ee00aa	let go.|`|f86b69918f0d7b018f7f8e324f22d129aa	witnessing|`|iSfeK4K6aa	I can't dance salsa properly.

But I just have to ask, since you mentioned god in your question - do give thumbs down to all the people who point out the faults in your religion?

3734b5f7e7c27b91d0268c00d9e7ed41aa	spirits do exist, just not spirits of dead people.    from the reasoning book:    Spiritism    Definition: Belief that a spirit part of humans survives death of the physical body and can communicate with the living, usually through a person who serves as a medium. Some people believe that every material object and all natural phenomena have indwelling spirits. Sorcery is the use of power that is acknowledged to be from evil spirits. All forms of spiritism are strongly condemned in the Bible.    Is it really possible for a human to communicate with the spirit of a dead loved one?    Eccl. 9:5, 6, 10: The living are conscious that they will die; but as for the dead, they are conscious of nothing at all . . . Also, their love and their hate and their jealousy have already perished, and they have no portion anymore to time indefinite in anything that has to be done under the sun. All that your hand finds to do, do with your very power, for there is no work nor devising nor knowledge nor wisdom in Sheol [the grave], the place to which you are going.    Ezek. 18:4, 20: The soul that is sinningit itself will die. (So the soul is not something that survives the death of the body and with which living humans can thereafter communicate.)    Ps. 146:4: His spirit goes out, he goes back to his ground; in that day his thoughts do perish. (When the spirit is said to go out of the body, this is merely another way of saying that the life-force has ceased to be active. Thus, after a person dies, his spirit does not exist as an immaterial being that can think and carry out plans apart from the body. It is not something with which the living can communicate after a persons death.)    Does not the Bible indicate that King Saul communicated with the prophet Samuel after Samuels death?    The account is found at 1 Samuel 28:3-20. Verses 13, 14 show that Saul himself did not see Samuel but only assumed from the description given by the spirit medium that she saw Samuel. Saul desperately wanted to believe that it was Samuel and so let himself be deceived. Verse 3 says that Samuel was dead and buried. The scriptures quoted under the preceding subheading make clear that there was no part of Samuel that was alive in another realm and able to communicate with Saul. The voice that pretended to be that of Samuel was that of an impostor.    With whom are those who endeavor to speak with the dead actually communicating?    The truth about the condition of the dead is clearly stated in the Bible. But who tried to deceive the first human pair about death? Satan contradicted Gods warning that disobedience would bring death. (Gen. 3:4; Rev. 12:9) In time, of course, it became obvious that humans did die as God said they would. Reasonably, then, who was responsible for inventing the idea that humans really do not die but that some spirit part of man survives the death of the body? Such a deception fits Satan the Devil, whom Jesus described as the father of the lie. (John 8:44; see also 2 Thessalonians 2:9, 10.) Belief that the dead are really alive in another realm and that we can communicate with them has not benefited mankind. On the contrary, Revelation 18:23 says that, by means of the spiritistic practices of Babylon the Great, all the nations were misled. The spiritistic practice of talking with the dead is actually a fraudulent deception that can put people in contact with the demons (angels that became selfish rebels against God) and often leads to a persons hearing unwanted voices and being harassed by those wicked spirits.|`|334528cdd9e0bf5b6f028b1a39daada0aa	That was idiotic and childish.

And Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.   11Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel.      12And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice: and the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou art Saul.      13And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest thou? And the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth.      14And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old man cometh up; and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground, and bowed himself.      15And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do.|`|AA12394429	LMAO...you got me.|`|Ie7aZfdSaa	Secret: I'm afraid of ghosts.

OIcIqvOUaa	Veamos qu es lo que el Nuevo Testamento ense?a con respecto a la ofrenda. Tomemos como punto de partida lo que encontramos en 1 Corintios 16:2 donde leemos lo siguiente:     "Cada primer da de la semana cada uno de vosotros ponga aparte algo, segn haya prosperado, guardndolo, para cuando yo llegue no se recojan entonces ofrendas."     Vemos en este texto bblico que esto de ofrendar no es un asunto ligero o algo que se puede manejar ligeramente. El ofrendar es un asunto serio que demanda preparacin, principalmente de las actitudes del corazn y secundariamente de los montos y las maneras de ofrendar. Se lo debe llevar a cabo cuando la iglesia est reunida, en el primer da de la semana y se lo debe poner aparte, guardndolo. En cuanto a la actitud para ofrendar, El apstol pablo se ocupa de este tema, dejando una ense?anza clara y precisa sobre el privilegio de ofrendar. En esencia se ve que el ofrendar es una gracia, es decir un favor inmerecido que recibe el creyente. Observe lo que dice 2 Corintios 8:7     "por tanto, como en todo abundis, en fe, en palabra, en ciencia, en toda solicitud, y en vuestro amor para con nosotros, abundad tambin en esta gracia.     El dar es entonces una gracia de parte de Dios en favor del creyente. Esto es notable. Al dar al Se?or la ofrenda, estamos hacindonos un favor a nosotros mismos, porque el dar trae aparejados un cmulo de beneficios para el que da. En esto se cumple la palabra de Dios cuando en proverbios 11:24 dice:     "Hay quienes reparten, y les es a?adido ms; y hay quienes retienen ms de lo que es justo, pero vienen a pobreza."     De modo que pablo no habla de la ofrenda como una gracia. Cuando ofrendamos, a veces tenemos la tendencia a pensar que estamos haciendo un favor a la iglesia, o a un hermano o a un misionero o inclusive a Dios. pero podemos ver cuan equivocados estamos, porque el ofrendar es una gracia, es decir un favor inmerecido que nosotros mismos recibimos. Tambin encontramos que en contraste con la ley, que impona un determinado porcentaje para ser entregado al Se?or, el Nuevo Testamento muestra que la ofrenda es un acto voluntario que parte del amor sincero al Se?or. En 2 Corintios 9:5 dice:     "por tanto, tuve por necesario exhortar a los hermanos que fuesen primero a vosotros y preparasen primero vuestra generosidad antes prometida, para que est lista como de generosidad, y no como de exigencia nuestra."     para Dios, lo importante es la actitud que tenemos para hacer las cosas. puede ser que ofrendemos abundantemente, pero si no tenemos una actitud correcta, esto no ser agradable a Dios. Dios mira el corazn ms que los billetes que estn en la mano al momento de ofrendar. Tambin encontramos que el privilegio de ofrendar es universal a los creyentes. No son pocos los creyentes que piensan que esto de ofrendar es exclusivo de los creyentes ricos, pero recordemos que los calificativos rico o pobre son bastante relativos. por ejemplo, un creyente que percibe cierta cantidad de dinero en calidad de salario, puede ser pobre en relacin a otro creyente que percibe el doble o el triple de ese salario, pero ese mismo creyente puede ser rico en relacin a otro creyente que percibe la mitad o la cuarta parte de ese salario. Es por esto que la gracia de ofrendar es para todos. Cada uno de vosotros dice el apstol pablo, en esto estn incluidos tanto los pobres como los ricos. Al decir esto, por supuesto que el apstol pablo no esperaba que todos los creyentes ofrenden la misma cantidad ni siquiera la misma proporcin. En el texto que lemos anteriormente, 1 Corintios 16:2 se nos dice que la cantidad a ofrendar es: "segn haya prosperado". El monto de ofrenda debe ser entonces proporcional a los ingresos del ofrendante. Esto permite que el creyente tenga la libertad de ofrendar en la cantidad que el creyente y Dios se pongan de acuerdo. Es un asunto estrictamente privado entre el creyente y Dios. pero siendo que el ofrendar es una gracia, debemos esperar beneficios del acto de ofrendar. No ofrendamos por el inters de recibir los beneficios, pero esto no elimina los beneficios que estn aparejados al ofrendar. Entre estos beneficios podemos mencionar el gozo. Los creyentes de Macedonia ofrendaron sacrificadamente y esto produjo abundancia de su gozo segn 2 Corintios 8:2 donde leemos:     "que en grande prueba de tribulacin, la abundancia de su gozo y su profunda pobreza abundaron en riquezas de su generosidad."     Otro beneficio de ofrendar es la multiplicacin de recursos para poder ofrendar ms. Mientras ms ofrendamos, el Se?or nos dar ms, no para que tengamos ms sino para que podamos dar ms. Note lo que dice 2 Corintios 9:6     "pero esto digo: El que siembra escasamente, tambin segar escasamente, y el que siembra generosamente, generosamente tambin segar."     pablo tom un ejemplo de la agricultura para ilustrar que la magnitud de las bendiciones que resultan de ofrendar tiene relacin directa a la magnitud de nuestra ofrenda. por supuesto que estas bendiciones no son exclusivamente materiales, sino principalmente espirituales. Otro beneficio de ofrendar es que el nombre de Dios es objeto de acciones de gracias por parte de los que han sido ayudados con la ofrenda. ponga atencin a lo que dice 2 Corintios 9:12     "porque la ministracin de este servicio no solamente suple lo que a los santos falta, sino que tambin abunda en muchas acciones de gracias a Dios."     Esto es fantstico, cuando ofrendamos, la gente que recibe algn beneficio de esa ofrenda agradecer a Dios, no a nosotros, y esto traer gloria al nombre de Dios, lo cual es justamente lo que todo creyente debe buscar.     Ahora viene el asunto de quien administra las ofrendas. Muy bien, en uno de los textos que lemos es claro que la iglesia local tiene la res|`|rDwYZlF3aa	se le entrega a la cuenta personal del pastor y su familia.|`|6wXI1P0haa	bueno no me enojo si me lo mandas a mi, cae muy bien...jejejejejejejee...suerte.|`|a71a745341a1ff0bcc0475fa38bf6389aa	La Biblia no indica que se tenga que ejercer el diezmo ya que con lamuerte de Jess la ley dada a los israelitas quedaba derogada.  El artculo que te adjunto explica bien el tema del diezmo desde el punto de vista biblico.  La conclusin del mismo es que el diezmo no es obligatorio para el cristiano. Por eso tu decisin debe ser personal  y no manejarte con el concepto de sentirte obligado a entregarlo a la religin a la cual asiste.   La Biblia expresa que "Jehov ama al dador alegre, no al que se siente obligado".    El diezmo... ?es necesario?    EL SECRETARIO de una dicesis de la Iglesia Anglicana de Sudfrica est preocupado. Su iglesia est atravesando una crisis econmica y se hace difcil pagar a los ministros su salario. Su solucin: Recalcar a los feligreses la necesidad de pagar el diezmo.    Pero, ?qu es el diezmo? Algunos dicen que es dar para propsitos religiosos la dcima parte de todo lo que uno recibe. Aunque la manera de calcular el diezmo vara de una religin a otra, muchos ministros consideran que es necesario fomentar el pago del diezmo. Es una pena que no hayamos promovido ms el pago del diezmo, dijo un sacerdote catlico de frica. En un artculo sobre cmo evitar la pobreza hacindose socio de Dios, la Iglesia Mundial de Dios dijo: Para comenzar una relacin con Dios, usted debe primero obedecer la ley de Dios tocante al pago del diezmo. El artculo agreg que aquellos que no la obedecen estn robndole a Dios.    Pero, ?requiere Dios que usted pague el diezmo? Puede que le sorprenda lo que la Biblia dice al respecto.    El diezmo y la ley de Moiss    El pago del diezmo era parte del conjunto de leyes que Dios dio por medio de Moiss a la antigua nacin de Israel. La ley requera que doce de las tribus mantuvieran a la decimotercera, la de los sacerdotes levitas, que no hered ninguna parte de la tierra. De este modo los levitas podan concentrarse en atender las necesidades espirituales de la nacin. (Nmeros 18:21-24.) Dado que los israelitas eran un pueblo agrcola, no tenan que pagar el diezmo en efectivo. Ms bien, el diezmo se obtendra de lo que produjera la tierra y del aumento del ganado. Si el israelita prefera pagar con dinero cierto diezmo, entonces tena que abonar un 20% ms del valor del producto. (Levtico 27:30-33.)    El mandamiento de Dios con relacin al diezmo era una cuestin seria. Si un israelita equivocadamente usaba para propsitos personales parte de lo que iba a pagar como diezmo, entonces tena que hacer compensacin. ?Cmo? Dando un 20% ms y ofreciendo un sacrificio animal por su culpa. (Levtico 5:14-16.) Aunque no todo israelita poda ser sacerdote, todos podan cooperar en la manutencin de los servicios sacerdotales pagando el diezmo. Todo eso estaba incluido en la ley de Dios tocante al diezmo. De modo que esta encajaba con las circunstancias de aquella antigua nacin. Pero, ?encaja con las circunstancias actuales de la gente? Ms importante an, ?estn los cristianos bajo el mandamiento de pagar el diezmo?    Un cambio de ley    Unos cuantos a?os despus de la resurreccin de Jess algunos no judos incircuncisos se convirtieron al cristianismo. Es necesario circuncidarlos y ordenarles que observen la ley de Moiss, arguyeron algunos cristianos judos. (Hechos 15:5.) Otros no concordaron. As que los apstoles de Jess y otros cristianos con experiencia se reunieron en Jerusaln para tratar esta cuestin. Queran discernir cul era la voluntad de Dios. ?Requera l que los seguidores de Cristo observaran la ley de Moiss, que inclua el pago del diezmo? En aquella reunin se relataron experiencias que mostraban que haba habido un cambio en los tratos de Dios con los no judos y se verific este cambio con la Palabra proftica de Dios. (Hechos 15:6-21.) ?Qu decisin se tom?    Los reunidos llegaron a una conclusin unnime. A los cristianos no se les debera cargar con la ley de Moiss. Haba, no obstante, algunas cosas necesarias que tenan que obedecer. ?Era el pago del diezmo una de ellas? La decisin adoptada bajo inspiracin fue: Al espritu santo y a nosotros mismos nos ha parecido bien no a?adirles ninguna otra carga, salvo estas cosas necesarias: que sigan abstenindose de cosas sacrificadas a dolos y de sangre y de cosas estranguladas y de fornicacin. (Hechos 15:25, 28, 29.) Es interesante notar que la ley de Dios tocante al diezmo no se incluy en la lista de cosas necesarias para los cristianos.    Ms adelante, el apstol Pablo explic que el pacto de la ley de Dios con Israel haba sido abolido con la muerte de Jess. [Dios] borr el documento manuscrito dijo Pablo, y l lo ha quitado del camino clavndolo al madero de tormento. (Colosenses 2:14.) Esto no significa que los cristianos no tienen ley. Ms bien, se ha producido un cambio de ley, ley que ahora incluye la ley del Cristo. (Glatas 6:2; Hebreos 7:12.)    El apstol Pablo vivi de acuerdo con este cambio de ley. Pese a haber laborado arduamente en la formacin de una congregacin tras otra, nunca pidi el diezmo como salario. Ms bien, estuvo dispuesto a sufragar sus propios gastos haciendo tiendas de campa?a como trabajador de media jornada. (Hechos 18:3, 4.) Con toda honradez l pudo decir: Estas manos han atendido a las necesidades mas y a las de los que andan conmigo. (Hechos 20:34.)    Entonces, ?qu gua siguen los cristianos respecto al dar? ?Cunto debera usted dar?    El modo de dar del cristiano    Jesucristo fue el hombre ms generoso que ha andado en la Tierra. Su ejemplo ha inspirado generosidad en muchas personas. Practiquen el dar dijo l, y se les dar.

2792559a8bc15bcf3a56985b8137df61aa	Ci provo:    -Giovanni Evangelista  in effetti uno degli apostoli, all'epoca sembra che fosse un ragazzo (16-20 anni), ed  morto molto vecchio. Nel Vangelo di Giovanni si parla spesso di un "discepolo che egli (Ges) amava", e sembra che fosse proprio lui. La tradizione dice che mor ad Efeso, in effetti intorno al 100 d.c., e nello stesso periodo comparve il vangelo a lui attribuito:  stato appurato che non  opera di una sola mano quindi non l'ha scritto lui (almeno, non tutto), ma sembra che pi persone l'hanno redatto sulla base dei suoi insegnamenti. Sono stati rinvenuti manoscritti originali di questo vangelo risalenti al 120 d.c., quindi non molto dopo la presunta prima stesura.    - Le tre Marie sono: la Maddalena, Maria Salom madre di Giovanni Evangelista e di Giacomo, e Maria di Cleofa madre dell'altro apostolo di nome Giacomo, detto il Minore.    -Per Maria Maddalena, si trattava di un'indemoniata che Ges aveva guarito e che gli  vicino a Gerusalemme, sotto la croce e poi dopo la resurrezione. Che sia lei quella della lavanda dei piedi non  certo, cos come non  certo che fosse lei la peccatrice che Ges aveva salvato dalla lapidazione.

Una ventina d'anni dopo la morte di Ges e fu necessario scriverli perch morivano i testimoni oculari ed era necessario che la Parola, trasmessa fino ad allora oralmente,  non fosse travisata. Infatti circa un secolo dopo cominciarono a circolare i Vangeli cosiddetti Apocrifi che aggiunsero folclore all'essenziale.   Le Marie che andarono al Sepolcro erano Maria di Magdala, Giovanna e una Maria, forse cognata della Madonna (Luca). Marco parla di Maria Maddalena e di Maria Salome mentre Matteo parla di due Marie, Maddalena e un'altra non meglio identificata.   Su Maria Maddalena c' un po' di confusione perch qualcuno la identifica con l'adultera, altri con una Maria di Magdala che faceva la prostituta e alcuni con la Maria sorella di Marta che gli lav i piedi .   L'ultima Cena non vide donne alla tavola. Le donne non erano ammesse e al limite potrebbero aver servito le vivande.   Giovanni l'Evangelista  uno dei 12 apostoli quello che "Ges amava" dice egli stesso per descriversi. Era poco pi che un ragazzo all'epoca della Crocifissione e fu l'Apostolo al quale Ges affid la propria Madre.

Ciao!|`|3be02bb9b9ddbaa5e419bf04011f58ebaa	Giovanni l'evangelista  un Apostolo ed ha scritto anche l'Apocalisse.    I Vangeli sono stati scritti quando gli evangelisti erano ancora in vita.    2) Matteo 27:54 Il centurione e quelli che con lui facevano la guardia a Ges, sentito il terremoto e visto quel che succedeva, furono presi da grande timore e dicevano: ?Davvero costui era Figlio di Dio!?.    Matteo 27:55 C'erano anche l molte donne che stavano a osservare da lontano; esse avevano seguito Ges dalla Galilea per servirlo.  Matteo 27:56 Tra costoro Maria di Mgdala, Maria madre di Giacomo e di Giuseppe, e la madre dei figli di Zebedo.    3) Luca 7:36 Uno dei farisei lo invit a mangiare da lui. Egli entr nella casa del fariseo e si mise a tavola.  Luca 7:37 Ed ecco una donna (=la Maddalena), una peccatrice di quella citt, saputo che si trovava nella casa del fariseo, venne con un vasetto di olio profumato;  Luca 7:38 e fermatasi dietro si rannicchi piangendo ai piedi di lui e cominci a bagnarli di lacrime, poi li asciugava con i suoi capelli, li baciava e li cospargeva di olio profumato.    Luca 7:39 A quella vista il fariseo che l'aveva invitato pens tra s. ?Se costui fosse un profeta, saprebbe chi e che specie di donna  colei che lo tocca:  una peccatrice?.  Luca 7:40 Ges allora gli disse: ?Simone, ho una cosa da dirti?. Ed egli: ?Maestro, di' pure?.  Luca 7:41 ?Un creditore aveva due debitori: l'uno gli doveva cinquecento denari, l'altro cinquanta.  Luca 7:42 Non avendo essi da restituire, condon il debito a tutti e due. Chi dunque di loro lo amer di pi??.  Luca 7:43 Simone rispose: ?Suppongo quello a cui ha condonato di pi?. Gli disse Ges: ?Hai giudicato bene?.  Luca 7:44 E volgendosi verso la donna, disse a Simone: ?Vedi questa donna? Sono entrato nella tua casa e tu non m'hai dato l'acqua per i piedi; lei invece mi ha bagnato i piedi con le lacrime e li ha asciugati con i suoi capelli.  Luca 7:45 Tu non mi hai dato un bacio, lei invece da quando sono entrato non ha cessato di baciarmi i piedi.  Luca 7:46 Tu non mi hai cosparso il capo di olio profumato, ma lei mi ha cosparso di profumo i piedi.  Luca 7:47 Per questo ti dico: le sono perdonati i suoi molti peccati, poich ha molto amato. Invece quello a cui si perdona poco, ama poco?.  Luca 7:48 Poi disse a lei: ?Ti sono perdonati i tuoi peccati?.  Luca 7:49 Allora i commensali cominciarono a dire tra s: ?Chi  quest'uomo che perdona anche i peccati??.  Luca 7:50 Ma egli disse alla donna: ?La tua fede ti ha salvata; va' in pace!?.    ciao
VyR7efSHaa	Yes dear one, I do.    Psalm 128  (A song for worship.)   The LORD will bless you if you respect him and obey his laws.   Your fields will produce, and you will be happy and all will go well.   Your wife will be as fruitful as a grapevine, and just as an olive tree is rich with olives, your home will be rich with healthy children.   That is how the LORD will bless everyone who respects him.   I pray that the LORD will bless you from Zion and let Jerusalem prosper as long as you live.   May you live long enough to see your grandchildren.   Let us pray for peace in Israel!     Zechariah 2:5  The LORD himself has promised to be a protective wall of fire surrounding Jerusalem, and He will be its shining glory in the heart of the city.    Father God - come. Protect your children in Israel. Bind the enemy from harming them. Keep our hearts ever mindful that You have grafted us into their family. In Jesus' name. Amen.|`|gR6Jmu7Gaa	It is Jerusalem and it is because the end-time events revolve around it.Not the nation of Israel or the people that some think are chosen ones.God does not bless rejecters of the Gospel or any race of people.Christians are the chosen people.Read Hebrews and Galatians,not pop-prophecy books and movies.Above guy is right about Palestinian Christians being overlooked by Western Christians.I was at fault years ago when I bought into pretrib/premill/dispen. brand of eschatology.It is unbiblical my friend.|`|qf0z5QB9aa	the jews dont like Jesus, if you remember correctly they did kill him, jews dont accept Christ, and he is the only way to God|`|m0mP9vUoaa	Very rarely do I pray for nations anymore.  I may on occasion pray for peace - peace in our hearts, peace in the world, peace among nations - but mostly when I pray for others, it is much more personal and intense.|`|gwqS6xHpaa	I dont pray for any nations or governments.    And, occasionally I pray for the plight of the Christian Palestinians who have been forgotten or written off by Western Christians.     A Christian who prays for Israel the nation is stabbing his Christian Brethren in the back.   Study up on the Patriarch Michael Sabbeh and what he has to say with the Israeli-Arab conflict.|`|7d647be57724929a656a84a04d156140aa	Yes I do.|`|AA10074301	pray for the peace of Jerusalem wasn't a suggestion.|`|0eed39a026b3bdafe1a244d7c85be399aa	LOL. The reason that Christians are praying for Israel, and assisting Israel, is that they want to help establish the conditions that (they think) are necessary for Jesus to return, destroy the earth, and SLAUGHTER all the Jews except for the 144,000 who will accept him as their Lord and savior.    Yep... they REALLY need your prayers, Christians.  .|`|1480ace3c43e491a5e9f79cd425b07bfaa	I do, as the persecution continues, and from what I have read in the Bible; it is all coming to be as God ordained. I will still continue to pray for God's will to be done however, not only for Israel, but also for the rest of the world. Hang tight.... it shall all pass...
9156b4d8f999049f28da11b20379b326aa	dont blame them blame the schools ( lol! j/p.)  i am an american and i moved from one of the southern states to alaska.  yes i actually thought i was gonna live in an igloo and see penguins and polar bears in my front yard, because when your younger they show you a map that has all the places on it and for the more up northern places they had an igloo. now maybe they were talking about the more rural parts, but i dove through there and i love canada. just tell them when they ask all the annoying question that it is the same as your city.|`|jEb5OGlraa	You must have stumbled across a stupid American.  I have never met anyone who thought Canadians lived in igloos and questioned electricity.    Are you sure she was serious?|`|AA11395598	Since the original inhabitants of Alaska never lived in Igloos as they did in the Yukon,  Americans are correct that Canadians live, or did live, in Igloos.|`|12011f85da0fb54b8dd064f30c2efa9daa	I hope they also told you that Texas was closed to tourists this time of year.|`|2ddb8a38c8c56dfd49408d9a6b997918aa	i never thought that/|`|275b5793f9320bad5b3cee7f53afcf23aa	haha    no thats just one american who apparently doesnt get out of the house very much|`|b29ca58124f000e217215499c9d45f66aa	Well, they're not igloos, exactly, they're more like 'snow forts'.  Some of them even have a snow garage that is used to store  their sled and sled dogs, which is the most common means of transportation. This is what I've been told anyway.   :)|`|9fa1adb1c8a5e488f13a34915c1381ceaa	LOL! I think someone was pulling your leg.|`|egO3olzmaa	Exactly where in the US were you?

Yo tuve un romance utopico con Mexico durante casi 20 a?os......  Hasta que un dia, hace ya de esto casi dos a?os y medio, vivi la experiencia mas encantadora del paladar.....  Probe la comida mexicana, asi de entradita en un restaurante que hay en Teotihuacan, que es una cueva natural, y comimos por primera vez nuestras enchiladas.... y probe la michelada tambien por vez primera...  Desde entonces nunca mas volvi a ser la misma....el chile me cambio el alma!!!! Je,je,je!  Mmmmm......tacos de pastor! Pozole!!!! Ni hablar de las tortas heladas de los Sanbourns!!!! O de todo lo que hay para probar en el mercado de Coyoacan!!!!!!  Y mira que desde hacia un a?o, que mis amigos mexicanos visitaron nuestro pais y lograron traernos de todo tipo de chile envasado.....  Nunca tuvimos problemas dijestivos, ni cruda despues de beber y beber tequila!!!!!!  Y asi podria seguir durante horas, pero ya se me hace agua la boca, voy a ir a un restaurate aca en Mendoza, Argentina, en el que se comen unas fajitas de lo mas parecidas a las de alla......  Y viva Mexico Cabr........!!!!!!!!|`|oDX5DqeZaa	la komida mexicana ez rica pero pz aveze no la zabemoz aprovechar x ejemplo el che burguer king y ezoz dominos jajaja ezo ez komida (ke orror ) jajaja pero la komida mexicana ez algo zumamente deliziozo =)|`|YFzX21d0aa	solo dos palabras, amplia y sabrosa|`|RWY0vZXWaa	A mi mucha gente del extranjero me dice que le gusta muchooo solo que si hay esa idea erronea que todo pica, al igual que el Tequila, cuando mencionas ese nombre creo que automticamente a todos les viene a la cabeza la ltima borrachera que tuvieron con tequila que les quedaron ganas de no volverlo a tomar. Pero este sabiendolo tomar bien y escogiendo un buen tequila te la pasas bien, adems que no es para tomarlo solo con limn y sal, con refresco de limn sabe rico    LA COMIDA MEXICANA ES DE LAS MS VARIADAS Y MEJORES DEL MUNDOOO,|`|waG9ndMhaa	La comida mexicana es riqusima si la saben preparar; tiene su chiste.

jVyAhoI5aa	I used to clean apartments after people moved out.  There were a few bad ones. One couple had "skipped out" during the night and left a lot of garbage in the apartment. Their kids had drawn and colored on the walls as far up as they could reach on EVERY WALL.  And not just a few scrawls here and there but huge masses of scribblings.  The apartment manager had to fumigate for cockroaches and I got to scoop up thousands of dead ones. Eeew!    I also used to know someone who never cleaned or even opened his mail. When he died in that mess, the mail was piled up hip-high all through the house.  Vermin had made tunnels through it and he had dozens of cats, none of them neutered or spayed, roaming the house too.  The house was so bad that after he died, it had to be torn down.  Odd thing was that though he never cleaned in the house at all, the front and back yards, though overgrown some (and a couple of abandoned vehicles in the front), were full of lovely plantings he had done and really quite pleasant.     I won't name names but a certain fellow I know VERY well was living in complete squalor when we first met. The house was full of old boxes full of paper and trash. Nothing had been cleaned in years.  There were black widow spiders in the boxes too!    I am a bit of a slob too but in comparison to these folks, I'm friggin' Martha Stewart!|`|7oMxu9fhaa	my sisters she has a cat litter tray in her kitchen thats disgusting then lets the cat jump on her worktops she has a very clean house just the cat lit thing it just yuck|`|BvV3ICGfaa	My husband's Ex wife's house!     http://i64.photobucket.com/albums/h183/p...  http://i64.photobucket.com/albums/h183/p...  http://i64.photobucket.com/albums/h183/p...  http://i64.photobucket.com/albums/h183/p...  http://i64.photobucket.com/albums/h183/p...  http://i64.photobucket.com/albums/h183/p...  http://i64.photobucket.com/albums/h183/p...  http://i64.photobucket.com/albums/h183/p...

There was a hole under the sink, where their cats would come in and out.  One night, an opossum came in the house through that hole.  My mother grabbed a maglight and killed the opossum with it.    The floors sagged and the place smelled awful!    I was so delighted when they moved to a better house.|`|AA11502176	i once opened a fridge in a basement that had a turkey from thanksgivings ago.|`|f54e4d495d8594f0f43f58a5ba89554aaa	Our neighbor just moved out and she had animals. When she moved we realised she had never thrown out the trash or cleaned the floors ever. There were pet foods smeared all over the floor, garbage, used sanitary pads, used tissues, used toilet paper all brown and yellow, and bugs had nested all over the ceilings. Some weird cocoon type things were hanging there, thousands of them. The kitchen had never been cleaned and there was food stuck to the floor, broken glass, rice and cat poop all over. Thank goodness she moved the smell was terrible.  She had lived in all that without ever picking up any of it. It was weird because she always looked clean and didnt smell as a person.|`|4cvJqfr3aa	There was 1 where the toilet was filled to the top with poo and food all over the place.  No running water.  I think about 5 people lived there.|`|43a00e9a2ea4150b04551e40da01dd09aa	The grossest home I've been to was an apartment where a sick man and a sick cat had been living without much outside help for a few years. There was such a big mess that it was hard to get around, there was stuff on the floor, tables, couches, chairs, absolutely everywhere you looked. There was old garbage all over the place, old food containers with half-eaten food that had been lying around for months, if not years. The cat is disabled and can't hold it, so it poops and pees all over the place and with the huge mess it hadn't been possible to clean up after the cat for a long time. The smell was terrible.    I helped clean the place up. It took a long time, a lot of work and A LOT of disinfecting soap, but the place looks (and smells) much better now and it's a healthier place to live in for both the owner and his cat.

2bafc7a4cc2230e31a14b152b0c35749aa	as a youth leader, i guess I don't expect any recognition from parents.... I have long ago given up expecting parents of the kids to appreciate what we do.... and i sure don't expect their respect, because 80% of the kids in the youth group at our church don't have parents who attend any church.... they are brought by friends.    what we do in youth group is for the kids... to teach... share... fellowship and learn... some of the parents don't even care if their kids are at youth group or at a bar downtown or in some drug house... they plum do not give a crap... how sad is that!?    I don't get frustrated anymore... but I am quick to say no when 'parents' ask me to help them in some other ministry that isnt my calling....|`|7d647be57724929a656a84a04d156140aa	That is why we have to work unto the Lord and know that the children are the ones who will benefit.

The best we can hope for in those situations is that something will spark in one of the kids, and eventually take hold and give them meaning. Ultimately, they could be ministering to their own parents.  Please, don't get discouraged - you have the most important position in the church - teaching and training the future church.  Sometimes, a thankless position, but the one with the most potential.  God bless.

Now wait a minute.  I enjoy this website a lot and find it extremely informative. I also find the contribute rs of questions use a lot of generalities.  Some questions about different cultures are genuine, and are submitted by people who are seeking enlightenment to help them better understand the differences that exist across the cultural board.  Some submit questions that are abusive, and are only using those questions to verbalize their own ignorance and prejudice. It is easy to winnow them from the sincere contributors. So, the question you have submitted is a gross generalization.  While i agree that there are a lot of questions submitted that regard the behaviors of certain cultural groups, I strongly disagree that, "everyday, all day, nothing but questions about black people" is very inaccurate

AA10552909	Shortened barrels on shotguns does make them terribly effective out to about 25 yards.  That's the idea - it's a weapon meant for close encounters of the unfriendly kind.  And no - cutting down the barrel of a shotgun does not increase the likelihood of it bursting in the hands of the shooter.  One can shorten the barrel of any shotgun, but in  pump-action and auto-loading weapons, that also would sometimes require altering the area wherein added rounds are kept - the tube beneath the barrel - which in turn would reduce the number of rounds one could cycle through the weapon before having to reload.|`|9fa1adb1c8a5e488f13a34915c1381ceaa	1.

82e1fe67ff1093d26a9bfa2fe8614b6daa	Because religion is a recruiting tool used for war.    Christians were duped into resisting unto death so the leaders of their political movement could throw bodies at the Romans.    Vikings were conditioned to fight to the death on the battlefield to ensure they were accepted by the Valkyries for the final battle of Ragnarok.    Muslims are taught to die in attacks on infidels so the leaders of their movement can toss bodies at the enemy. Think early Christianity with gunpowder.    It's all the same.|`|tFGKiRJhaa	"if you don't have anything worth dying for, you don't really have anything worth living for..."|`|9fa1adb1c8a5e488f13a34915c1381ceaa	Only the 3 Abrahamic religions require this.

Well, it would be the same feeling to those who hold their faith in deep personal regard. Very few Christian die for their faith in North America, in other countries that is not the case. Devout Christians would rather die than reject Christ.
af5ac2fa6b3b5305fd2c579e2461224faa	Papa Benedetto XVI ha fatto per ventanni il consigliere del Beato Giovanni Paolo II. Tutto quello che il Beato Padre faceva e diceva, veniva vagliato con BXVI.  Il Beato Padre poi mediava diplomaticamente tutto.  Benedetto XVI non  un papa sfortunato perch il primo era meglio. Questo papa dice senza mezzi termini quello che deve dire, senza compiacere ad una certa area politica italiana. La quale vedeva in  GPII una specie di alleato, che in realt non concedeva un bel fico secco; Egli sapeva solo illudere il mondo politico e giornalistico, di fare quello che piaceva a tutti. Questo grande papa, invece, ha chiuso un'epoca e ne ha aperta un'altra senza mezze misure. Egli dice :" la fede  questa, la morale cattolica anche. Cos deve andare...Se si vuole essere in Cristo. Qualsiasi altra starda  sbagliata." Il bello  che, cos, la pensava anche il suo predecessore!  Quindi, grande teologo, grande catechista, grande guida spirituale e uomo dolce, malgrado l'accento krukko.  Ciao.    Dimenticavo!

Si sforza di apparire simpatico, a volte addirittura frivolo nei suoi atteggiamenti, ma basta guardarlo negli occhi per leggervi una freddezza a tutta prova, quella di un uomo abituato ai severi ragionamenti, abituato a stare nella sua torre d'avorio, lontano idealmente dal popolo, appartenendo ad una razza di intellettuali che in realt si sentono al di sopra della massa. Sar un Papa di passaggio, vista anche l'et avanzata, e non lascer tracce di umanit o di comprensione al suo transito, ma solo quei libri che ancora avr il tempo di scrivere. Papa Luciani, ad esempio,  fu una meteora fulgidissima, ma purtroppo velocissima.

yMfrHl5Faa	Magic is generally considered to be a trick.  Magick, however, is an integral part of many Contemporary Pagan belief systems.  Magick is the manifestation of one's will in the corporeal world.  Say I make a Talisman for Luck in finding the right job for me.  I empower that Talisman and whenever I see or think about it I am reminded to keep a positive outlook about my career possibilities.  I finally get the job.  It was my will to get the job I wanted, and the Talisman was a positive reinforcement tool.  My will did manifest itself, and thus Magick was performed.      Paganism is a word used to encompass many different religious traditions.  Originally, a Pagan was someone who was not Christian, Jewish, or Muslim.  Witches, Druids, Wiccans, Asatru, and other non-mainstream religious paths are Pagan.  Paganism divided into many different religions.      Religion in general is any belief system accepted my human beings.  Religion is very diverse and can be a group matter or an individual spiritual path.|`|baxpcZlQaa	Well,  Magic is a trick. Paganism is no belief in God. What about the paranormal??  That's what bothers me!! (good question---you've got me thinking-----it hurts a little right at first-------ouch!!)|`|MSWUp75Oaa	Magic is the physical manifestation of a change in reality as a result of one's intent and will. The difference between magic and miracles is who is given credit for the intent and who takes the credit or blame for the outcome.  Paganism is the practice of the belief that all things are connected to each other and together are an ultimate being or system. Many pagans also have the belief that life is cyclical just as nature follows cycles. Some of the pagan religions have holy days that reflect points along the cycles of life. Not all pagans practice a pagan religion. Some pagans are Christian and some are of other faiths while some are atheists or agnostic. Not all pagans practice magic.  All religions share some basic commonalities. They serve to educate their followers in the way of their path. They tend to lend spiritual and monetary or physical support to their followers and the community as a whole. Some religions have practiced magic or still do.  There is no direct connection to all of these three different things. There can be connections made but there are no inherent connections.|`|9fa1adb1c8a5e488f13a34915c1381ceaa	Magic is the the attempt by an individual to influence events via the will.   Religion is a doctrine encompassing belief system, morals, and lifestyle.  Paganism has become a blanket term for all those who don't subscribe to the 3 Abrahamic religions. Pagans these days include a number of non-abrahamic religions, freethinkers, and practicioners of various types of magic.
4770ec96b00c277a1052a824b2656201aa	From Wiccans.  In a coven. Or from a coven-trained and -initiated Wiccan who is practicing as a solitary.  From a teacher, in other words.    Wicca isn't the anything-goes stuff that is floating around or the stuff being written about by Slaver Ravingwolf.    But you may not actually be interested in Wicca so much as Wicca-influenced or -informed neo-paganism; there are many such paths and groups around.    Not everyone wants to be Wiccan.  I know I don't.  I'm a Witch, and have been for a very long time. I've trained with, and been initiated into, two Traditions of Witchcraft that are informed by Wicca but are not Wiccan; NROOGD is the one I currently practice.    My hubby (Black Dragon on R&S) is Wiccan.  He was trained in, and initiated into, one of the Traditions of Wicca.    Prarie Crow is also Wiccan, having been trained in, and initiated into, one of the Traditions of Wicca.    Just be aware that pretty much anything that has been published about "Wicca" is the outer-court, or beginner's information, and that to get the rest you have to be trained by someone who *has* the rest.      And some of the stuff published is purely inaccurate and silly.    I have this adorable little book (which I own simply for the humor value) called "How to turn your ex-boyfriend into a frog".  This is an example of books that ought not to be taken seriously.    If you're just wondering in a desultory way about what Wicca is, or what Witchcraft is, then I can point you to a few good websites:    Witchcraft:  http://www.cog.org/wicca/faq.html WITCH    Wicca:   http://www.religioustolerance.org/wic_fa...  http://www.starkindler.org/wicca.html      EDIT: In no way do I wish to convey here that people who are neo-pagans but not Wiccans are by nature "less than" Wiccans.  I just have a problem with people who have read a book or two thinking that that is the equivalent to having someone train and supervise you, just as I have a problem with people who read recipe books thinking that's the same as taking Culinary Arts classes.    There's technique involved in both, and you can't learn that from reading a book.  Or four.  Or ten.      Peace out.|`|SaXfpJVOaa	there is a great little book called "when someone you love is wiccan" or you can go to http://www.religioustolerance.org/witchc...    if you can meet up with some LONGTIME practitioners that would be good too.|`|9fa1adb1c8a5e488f13a34915c1381ceaa	Try looking for a Wiccan group in your area.

There are hoards in the vaults of central banks, there are hoards that belong to individuals and organizations. There is even some amount that has been reburied (grave goods, hoards that have been forgotten, and sunken treasure) But if you took all the gold that has ever been mined and put it all together you would only get a cube that fits inside a football stadium.

Un mendicante, di nome Lazzaro, giaceva alla sua porta, coperto di piaghe, bramoso di sfamarsi, di quello che cadeva dalla mensa del ricco. Perfino i cani venivano a leccare le sue piaghe. Un giorno il povero mor e fu portato dagli angeli nel seno di Abramo. Mor anche il ricco e fu sepolto. Stando nell'inferno tra i tormenti, lev gli occhi e vide di lontano Abramo e Lazzaro accanto a lui. Allora gridando disse: Padre Abramo, abbi pieta di me e manda Lazzaro a intingere nell'acqua la punta del dito e bagnarmi la lingua, perch questa fiamma mi tortura. Ma Abramo rispose: Figlio, ricordati che hai ricevuto i tuoi beni durante la vita e Lazzaro parimenti i suoi mali; ora invece lui  consolato e tu sei in mezzo ai tormenti. Per di pi tra noi e voi  stabilito un grande abisso: coloro che di qui vogliono passare da voi non possono, n da voi si pu attraversare fino a noi.  Egli replic: Allora, padre, ti prego di mandarlo a casa di mio padre, perch ho cinque fratelli. Li ammonisca, perch non vengano anch'essi in questo luogo di tormento. Ma Abramo rispose: Hanno i profeti; ascoltino loro. E lui: No, padre Abramo, ma se qualcuno dai morti andr da loro, si ravvederanno. Abramo rispose: Se non ascoltano i profeti, neanche se uno risuscitasse dai morti sarebbero persuasi".

Sei cristiano? Si? Allora il Paradiso  la cosa pi bella che troveremo dopo morto. Uno stato di immensa felicit e gioia incommensurabile nel contemplare Dio nella Santissima Trinit. Il Paradiso  lo stato d'animo delle persone che durante la vita hanno seguito la strada della santit, aperta a chiunque. Quando una persona comincia ad avere fede,  all'inizio di quella strada. Se durante la vita, invece, avremo avuto dei cedimenti nel peccato con consapevolezza, allora dovremo purificarci in Purgatorio, con immenso dolore e angoscia per non poter vedere Dio, ma contemporaneamente con tanta consapevolezza e gioia perch prima o poi lo vedremo.  Durante la nostra vita possiamo, infine, rifiutare la fede e l'amore di Dio; allora saremo sul sentiero dell'inferno che alla fine ci allontaner per l'eternit da Dio. Il quale, per, ci tende la mano fino all'ultimo per permetterci di salvarci. L'inferno  uno stato d'animo angoscioso, triste, deprimente, dove il pianto e lo stridore dei denti accentuano il dolore e la consapevolezza di non poter salvarci pi, di non poter avere pi alcuna possibilit di vedere Dio.  Ti consiglio di contemplare per bene la possibilit di spiritualizzare la tua vita. Non necessariamente con il cattolicesimo, l'importante  uscire dalla vita materialistica, banale e senza dignit spirituale. Ama il prossimo, pentiti seriamente dei peccati, parla con Dio e prega, conduci una vita onesta, non abusare dei beni del creato ma usa ci che Dio giorno per giorno ti da. Non disperare per il futuro, vivi nel presente con ci che ogni giorno ricevi. Rallegrati delle cose belle della natura, rispettala e amala. Cos facendo, la vita sar gi un assaggio del Paradiso.

Quando cessano la respirazione, il battito cardiaco e lattivit cerebrale, la forza vitale smette gradualmente di operare nelle cellule del corpo. La morte  il contrario della vita.    Dio cre luomo perch morisse?    Tuttaltro. Geova mise in guardia Adamo contro la disubbidienza, la quale avrebbe portato alla morte. (Gen. 2:17) In seguito Dio avvert gli israeliti di non intraprendere una condotta che li avrebbe portati anche solo a una morte prematura. (Ezec. 18:31) A suo tempo invi il proprio Figlio perch morisse a favore dellumanit affinch coloro che avrebbero riposto fede in questo provvedimento potessero ricevere la vita eterna. ?Giov. 3:16,?36.    Salmo 90:10 dice che di solito la vita umana  di?70 o 80?anni. Questa era la situazione quando Mos scrisse, ma non era cos in principio. (Confronta Genesi 5:3-32). Ebrei 9:27 dice che agli uomini  riservato di morire una volta per sempre. Anche questo era vero quando fu scritto. Ma non era cos prima che Dio condannasse il peccatore Adamo.    Perch invecchiamo e moriamo?    Geova cre la prima coppia umana perfetta, con la prospettiva di vivere per sempre. Furono dotati di libero arbitrio. Avrebbero ubbidito al loro Creatore spinti dallamore e dalla gratitudine per tutto ci che aveva fatto per loro? Erano pienamente in grado di farlo. Dio disse ad Adamo: In quanto allalbero della conoscenza del bene e del male non ne devi mangiare, poich nel giorno in cui ne mangerai positivamente morirai. Servendosi del serpente come portavoce, Satana adesc Eva e la indusse a violare il comando di Geova. Adamo non riprese la moglie, ma si un a lei nel mangiare quel frutto proibito. Geova mantenne la parola e condann a morte Adamo, ma prima di eseguire la sentenza permise misericordiosamente che la coppia peccatrice generasse dei figli. ?Gen. 2:17; 3:1-19; 5:3-5; confronta Deuteronomio 32:4 e Rivelazione 12:9.

Dove sono i morti?    Gen. 3:19: Col sudore della tua faccia mangerai pane finch tornerai al suolo, poich da esso sei stato tratto. Poich polvere sei e in polvere tornerai.

Effettivamente, per, DIO non costringe nessuno ad amarlo, n distrugger chi non riesce ad amarlo spontaneamente, se cos fosse sarebbe come se davvero Dio volesse estorcere lamore dalle sue creature. Chi ti ha fatto capire qualcosa del genere non conosce Dio!  Devi ammettere per che difficilmente non amiamo la persona che sa farsi voler bene, non trovi?  Perci  opportuno conoscere Dio come realmente !  Come?           Facciamo un esempio.     In Ecclesiaste [Qohleth] 7:16, il buon re Salomone fece suo un pensiero di Dio mettendolo per iscritto: Non divenire troppo giusto e non ti mostrare eccessivamente saggio. Perch dovresti causarti desolazione?    La conclusione che se ne pu trarre  che Dio non ama essere troppo giusto poich sa che causerebbe infelicit; perci raccomanda di fare altrettanto.   La giustizia, per quanto necessaria possa essere,  comunque fredda, ma Dio non  solo giusto bens buono. Egli  lequilibrio in persona in quanto non , ne eccessivamente giusto, ne  eccessivamente buono.  Perci raccomanda di fare altrettanto.   Egli stempera la giustizia con la bont!      Forse ora potr dire a se stessa che conosce meglio il Creatore. Grazie a cosa?  Alle Scritture o per meglio dire: la Bibbia!   per mezzo dessa che lo si pu conoscere.  Quanto a interpretarla, lascia stare: la Bibbia si interpreta da sola!    La Bibbia risponde anche alla tua domanda circa la condizione dei morti.  Essa infatti rivela prima di tutto che Dio si  dato un nome: Geova e che la morte non  la fine di tutto. Se oggi morissi, volendo, Dio mi resusciterebbe al tempo o allora stabilita!    Ges Cristo disse: Lora viene in cui tutti quelli che sono nelle tombe commemorative udranno la sua voce [di Ges] e ne verranno fuori, quelli che hanno fatto cose buone a una risurrezione di vita, quelli che hanno praticato cose vili a una risurrezione di giudizio. (Giovanni 5:28, 29) Tutti quelli che sono nella memoria di Geova saranno risuscitati e istruiti intorno alle sue vie. Per chi agir in armonia con la conoscenza di Dio, questa si riveler infine una risurrezione di vita. Si riveler invece una risurrezione di giudizio, di condanna, per chi rigetter gli insegnamenti e il dominio di Dio.  Milioni di esseri umani sono morti senza aver dimostrato se volevano attenersi alle giuste norme di Dio. Anche loro saranno risuscitati. Confidando nel proposito di Geova a questo riguardo, lapostolo Paolo disse: Ho in Dio la speranza . . . che ci sar una risurrezione sia dei giusti che degli ingiusti.  Atti 24:15.     Naturalmente quelli che hanno tenuto una condotta giusta come servitori di Geova saranno risuscitati. Infatti la speranza della risurrezione ha rafforzato molti di fronte alla morte, anche in caso di persecuzione violenta. Sapevano che Dio poteva riportarli in vita. (Matteo 10:28)    la Bibbia parla dei morti come se dormissero. Per esempio, saputo che il suo amico Lazzaro era morto, Ges Cristo disse ai discepoli: Lazzaro, il nostro amico,  andato a riposare, ma io vado a svegliarlo dal sonno. Dato che i discepoli l per l non afferrarono il significato di queste parole, Ges disse chiaramente: Lazzaro  morto. (Giovanni 11:11, 14) Quindi si rec nella cittadina di Betania, dove le sorelle di Lazzaro, Marta e Maria, piangevano la morte del fratello. Quando Ges le disse: Tuo fratello sorger, Marta espresse fede nel proposito di Dio di annullare gli effetti della morte sulla famiglia umana, dicendo: So che sorger nella risurrezione, nellultimo giorno.  Giovanni 11:23, 24.  Marta non pens affatto a unanima immortale che continua a vivere in qualche luogo dopo la morte.   Non credeva che Lazzaro fosse gi andato in un reame spirituale per continuare a vivere. Marta aveva fede nella meravigliosa speranza di una risurrezione dei morti. Non pensava che unanima immortale si fosse separata dal corpo di Lazzaro; capiva che il fratello morto aveva cessato di esistere. Il rimedio sarebbe stato la sua risurrezione.   Ges Cristo ha ricevuto da Geova Dio il potere di redimere lumanit. (Osea 13:14) Perci, in risposta alle parole di Marta, disse: Io sono la risurrezione e la vita. Chi esercita fede in me, bench muoia, torner in vita. (Giovanni 11:25) Ges dimostr il potere conferitogli da Dio a questo riguardo quando si avvicin alla tomba di Lazzaro, che era morto da quattro giorni, e lo riport in vita. (Giovanni 11:38-44) Immagina la gioia di coloro che videro questa e altre risurrezioni compiute da Ges Cristo!  Marco 5:35-42; Luca 7:12-16.    Soffermati un momento a riflettere: Nessuno avrebbe bisogno di essere risuscitato, o riportato in vita, se unanima immortale sopravvivesse alla morte. Infatti non sarebbe amorevole risuscitare qualcuno, come Lazzaro, ridandogli una vita imperfetta sulla terra, se avesse gi ricevuto una meravigliosa ricompensa celeste. In effetti nella Bibbia non ricorre mai lespressione anima immortale. Anzi le Scritture dicono chiaramente che lanima umana peccatrice muore. (Ezechiele 18:4, 20) Quindi indicano che il vero rimedio contro la morte  il provvedimento di una risurrezione.     Con questo in mente non dovremmo spaventarci allidea che dopo morti non esistiamo poich anche il tempo non sussister.  Qualora fossimo ritenuti degni di essere risuscitati, tornando in vita sar come svegliarsi dal sonno di ieri sera. Ci ritroveremo sempre sulla nostra terra ma con molti cambiamenti avvenuti nel frattempo di cui uno  descritto nel profetico Salmo 37:10,11 dove si legge:    "E ancora un poco, e il malvagio non sar pi;  E certamente presterai attenzione al suo luogo, ed egli non sar.

C9bBlMS2aa	Worshiping a concocted image of any person or any real person who is not God is false God since that is not God by definition. It is at best a idol or doll or human worship and not God worship. All are material worship and temporary. It does not yield any result and even if it does ultimately it is all temporary and therefore in another sense false worship.    The actual God worship is spiritual and eternal spiritual worship. It is not idol or doll worship, but DEITY or Srimurti worship.    In our present material circumstances we are accustomed to seeing material things like stone, wood etc..., whereas God is completely spiritual and is not visible to our material eyes. Therefore, God out of his causeless mercy towards us, presents Himself in a form (matter like stone, wood etc...) we can see Him. Because God is omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent it is possible for Him to be present in a form that we can see. But then again the form of the God is not that which any one can concoct in their fertile brain and think it to be God.    God has given the authorized revealed scriptures in which there are details as to how one do pratishta(install) a form of the God in the temple. It is great science and the form of the God so installed is called Arca Vighraha(DEITY to be worshiped) and it is not a doll. Example can be given to a post box authorized by the post office delivers the letter whereas any red box kept where one puts postal letters are not delivered to the recipient. The authorized post box is similar to the DEITY installed according the procedure given in the scriptures and any unauthorized red box is similar to any doll made out of stone or wood.    In India, there are so many hundreds and thousands of temples where the deities are installed properly. For instance, jagannatha Puri, the Deities of Jagannatha, Baladeva, Shubhadra in Orissa attract around 600,000 pilgrims everyday and during the annual Ratha Yatra(Car Festival) the number of pilgrims coming there is like a ocean.    See the following enlightening knowledge from Srila Bhakti Vindoda Thakura, the great-grand spiritual master of A.C.Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada(founder of ISKCON)  In Bhagavad-gita (9.25) it is said:"They who worship matter remain in the material world."  Therefore the conclusion of the scriptures is that worship of matter is not allowed. That you can see. However, a certain point should be explained. Human beings are situated on different levels of knowledge and purity. A person situated in pure spiritual knowledge is able to worship the pure spiritual form of the Lord. Persons situated on lower levels of spiritual awareness understand the Lord to a lesser degree, and they who are on the lowest level cannot understand the Lord's spiritual nature at all. When he meditates on God, a person on the lowest level inevitably imagines that God has a material form with material qualities. To think that the DEITY form of the Lord is a statue made of clay is the same as to meditate in the mind on a Supreme that one imagines to have a form made of matter. Actually for persons on that level of advancement, worship of the DEITY form of the Lord is very beneficial. In fact, if there were no DEITY worship, the people in general would be in an inauspicious condition. If an ordinary person eager to see God were not able to see the DEITY form of the Lord, then he would lose hope that he would ever see the Lord. The followers of religions that forbid DEITY worship are on a low level of spiritual advancement. They are materialistic and not interested in worshiping the Lord. Therefore DEITY worship is the foundation of religion. Pure and wise saints gaze on the form of the Supreme Lord. Their hearts purified by devotion, they know that the DEITY form of the Lord is pure spirit. As the heart becomes more and more purified by devotion, the worshipper gradually comes to understand that the DEITY form of the Lord is a spiritual form reflected within the realm of the material world. Thus the DEITY form is the spiritual form of the Lord, a form that the great saints have arranged to be reflected within the material world. An advanced devotees can directly perceive that the DEITY form is perfectly spiritual. An intermediate devotee thinks the DEITY form is a mental image. At first a neophyte devotee thinks the DEITY is a statue made of material elements, but as he gradually become pure in heart, he also gradually comes to understand that the DEITY is actually made of spirit. Therefore the DEITY form of the Lord should be worshiped by all classes of devotees. To worship an imaginary form is forbidden. However, to worship the real eternal form of the Lord is very auspicious.|`|KQHHtse9aa	God Almighty cannot be less then God.  God Almighty is beyond our imaginations, and visualization.  God Almighty is creator, Provider, and Sustainer of Universes, and every living/nonliving things in/on universes.  God Almighty is unique and does not share, personality, Authority, and cannot be compared with any other especially human attributes or characteristics. No similarity at all.    We have to develop our mind status where we should understand unlimited personality of The God Almighty.  If we try to visualize God that means we lacks maturity to understand God, and try to limit His personality in limited form of existence and try to compare with His own Creations.    You are moving towards that maturity where you are realizing that God Almighty cannot be limited. Congratulations.    May God Almighty help you for finding truth. It is your right to find truth, and accept truth.    http://www.sultan.org/articles/god.html  http://www.beconvinced.com    The most fundamental belief that a Muslim has is that "There is only One God" the Creator, the Sustainer -- known in the Arabic language and by Muslims as Allah.  Allah is not a foreign god, nor an idol.  Arabic-speaking Christians use the same word for the Almighty.     Some non-Muslims mistakenly believe that Allah is an "Arab god," a "moon god," or some sort of idol.  Allah is the proper name of the One True God, in the Arabic language used by Muslims all over the world.  Allah is a name that is neither feminine nor masculine, and it cannot be made plural (unlike god, gods, goddess, etc).

Be happy and pray with an honest heart because the surest way to get to God is searching within yourself.|`|899kfDcJaa	I don't want to offend you so please be aware that I am not all that familiar with Hinduism I just wanted to share something that I learned and came to appreciate in my worship as a Christian. First, did you know that Hindu reformers such as Ramakrishna and Vivekenanda were influenced by the Bible? Mohandas Gandhi also maintained that its teachings can 'solve the problems of the world' Both Hindus and Sikhs are indebted to it for their concept of bhakti thus, earning the respect of great Indian thinkers. With that being said I'd like to share with you a verse from the Bible that may help you in your quest to pleasing God. It is Deuteronomy 5:6-9 which says:  " 'I am Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slaves. You must never have any other gods against my face. You must not make for yourself a carved image, or a form like anything that is in the heavens above or that is on the earth underneath or that is in the waters under the earth. You must not bow down to them or be led to worship or render sacred service to them, because I Jehovah your God am a God exacting exclusive devotion bringing punishment for the error of fathers upon sons and upon the third generation and upon the fourth generation, in the case of those who hate me.'"

Devil-spawn -- Not by a long shot.    I don't quite understand how you view God but He is definitely NOT "Hollywood-type." To begin with, He detests homosexuality, or any sexual debauchery for that matter. He has set certain actions as right and others as wrong that Hollywood has completely reversed. God is against pride, greed, self-indulgence, self-worshipping, drug use, etc.  In all actuality, Holleywood would love for us to think that God is not relevant to this world or, as you say, doesn't fit. If they can put God out of the picture than they can continue their lifestyles without being held accountable.    Unfortunately for them, God has standards. Although, we are saved by His grace through our faith in His Son, Jesus Christ, we will be held accountable for our actions. This is because our actions and how we treat others is a direct indication of where our heart is and what we ultimately serve. God wants and desires a close, personal relationship with us. He wants us to love, praise Him and follow His commandments. We can do this by loving others and treating them with decency and respect even when we disagree with them or they do something to harm us. Jesus made this clear by saying, " For how you treat the least fo these, you treat me."    So, I ask you... What do you want? Do you want a god that makes you warm and feel good with whatever life you want to lead? Or do you want a God who loves you enough to have His Son die for your sins on the Cross and correct you when you need it but always loves and protects you?
bORRtBMcaa	Because they think that protein can be consumed in alternative ways, i.e. ways that don't use processing and manufacturing.  They think it is more natural, but what they forget is that our ancestors relied on hunted animals for millions of years and if it weren't for the fact that we could eat meat we would have died out as humans a long time ago.    I used to be part vegetarian, and met some very radical people who could quote how much grain a cow eats to make one pound of beef, and how much water it takes to grow the grain and how it is wasted when we slaughter the animals, on and on.  What I learned was that there are many unhappy people who think that they can contribute to our global problems by being vocal about animal rights.  They are rather unbalanced when you consider the other global problems our world faces and the fact that millions of children who die of starvation are usually living in arid, unproductive regions where if they didn't have animals to hunt, there would be more dying.      Just a few thoughts.  I think everyone has a bone to pick, so to say, and this one attracts animal lovers in liberal college campuses.  I wonder what would happen if they were required to grow their OWN food, and see first hand just how hard it is to live off the land in a purely agricultural lifestyle? hmmm|`|c64f66096640221b0762d74e09be96dfaa	wow. that's a good example of a logical fallacy, begging the question. either you're a deer-hunter who's lost sight of the real woods or you have no idea what you're talking about. those who strongly advocate eating animals for the meat or protein and consciously kill animals to eat them regularly are exempt from the following error simply because they don't know any better, i.e., some people will simply die trying to kill the deer without any concept of changing their mind. these types will never be able to really sensitively examine or discover newer ways of thinking or feeling. when people acquire newer and more sensitive ways of thinking, feeling, and living, they tend to be less violent. this is a fact of society. if subsistence and well-being are possible without killing animals for meat, then why not struggle to change yourself for the sake of living the life of the higher-order thinker and feeler that you are? if you insist on killing animals for food, then those who know better really have the right to label you as unfit to think or feel any better. this goes to show that some organisms, like animals without the ability to better themselves through their own psychology and higher sensitivities and sensibilities, are really bound to die and be killed too.

This definition is broad enough to include species such as hexafluorosilicate ("fluorosilicate"), [SiF6]2?, but the silicate species that are encountered most often consist of silicon with oxygen as the ligand. Silicate anions, with a negative net electrical charge, must have that charge balanced by other cations to make an electrically neutral compound.    Silica, or silicon dioxide, SiO2, is sometimes considered a silicate, although it is the special case with no negative charge and no need for counter-ions. Silica is found in nature as the mineral quartz, and its polymorphs.    In the vast majority of silicates, including silicate minerals, the Si atom shows tetrahedral coordination by 4 oxygens. In different minerals the tetrahedra show different degrees of polymerization: they occur singly, joined together in pairs, in larger finite clusters including rings, in chains, double chains, sheets, and three-dimensional frameworks. The minerals are classified into groups based on these anion structures; a list is given below.    Silicon may adopt octahedral coordination by 6 oxygens at very high pressure, as in the dense stishovite polymorph of silica that is found in the lower mantle of the Earth, and which is also formed by shock during meteorite impacts. Lack of space around the oxygen atoms makes this coordination for Si very rare at normal pressure, but it is known in the hexahydroxysilicate anion, [Si(OH)6]2?, as found in the mineral thaumasite.

And what is wrong with the God of the Old Testament if the complete Bible is true? If there is a God and he did those things, he is most likely justified in doing them.  Why, you ask?      1) If he is real, he created all things.  If he literally created all things (means of creation doesn't matter, whether by evolution or whatever) than he has complete authority over them and does not, in any way, need to justify what he does with them.  If you make a waffle do you need to justfiy (to the waffle) what you do with it?    2)  If the God of the Bible is real, than there is an afterlife.  If there is an afterlife than those murdered-by-a-bear kids are still alive and well right now.  If God knows all things than he knows they didn't know enough of what they were doing to be eternally damned for what they did so they are probably not even in hell right now (justice and mercy baby!)   But they died! you say?  So what?  They are alive and kicking now and are probably not worried about some trivial thing that happened almost  three millenia ago.     3) Same for the egyptian kids.  They died for a greater cause and are living it up in heaven right now.  The God of the Bible doesn't hold people accountable for what they didn't know.    4) You said Bible God.  Old and New Testament.  God of unceasing justice (Old T) and god of unyielding mercy (NEW T). The balance between the two makes the actions of God, on an eteranal scale, work out just fine.  So do I believe there ought to be that kind of God?  Absolutely.  Sign me up.  If he can "wipe tears from off all faces" (paraphrasing Isaiah (OLD Testament no less!)), than I am all for it.    Summary:  I'm not a literalist Christian.  I believe that much of the Bible is not literal, but symbolic.  I've read the bible several times from a religious, and then separately historical, perspective.  The overall message of the Bible is God is a loving God.  If you had only said the Old Testament you would have had a different answer.  Because you included the New Testament and the teachings of Christ who taught mercy ("Go thy way," not stone her!), than you have to take into account all that is said about accountability and a NEW TESTAMENT (Promise).  The switch from the OT to the NT is the switch from a basic law (Moses) to a higher law (Christ) that is highly forgiving and comforting (Blessed are those that mourn (Egyptian Parents included), for they shall be comforted.)

gyQOPBhHaa	Credere in Dio e nella Chiesa sono due cose diverse.  Credere in Dio, un'entit superiore che vuole la pace, il rispetto, l'ugualianza, e tutte le cose buone di questo mondo per me non c' nulla di male, ma credere gi solo ad un racconto non appurato storicamente, o credere ad una istituzione, la Chiesa, che ha perseguitato e ha ucciso un casino di persone, giustificando la cosa in nome di Dio, e la cosa  una contraddizione assurda, visto che Dio vuole solo la pace tra i popoli, la tolleranza ecc., ecco credere in queste cose non mi piace gi pi.  Ed al giorno d'oggi la cosa  ancora peggiore poich pur di mantenere il buon nome (tra l'altro gi infangato) nasconde preti pedofili che hanno violentato sessualmente bambini (e ci sono viedo su youtube che fanno accapponare la pelle).   Un'altra cosa: Dante voleva la Chiesa povera e umile. Anche se non sono un patito di Dante, sono d'accordo con lui con questo tema. Perch non vende i suoi bei tesorucci conservati nei musei del Vaticano e d tutto in beneficenza? Forse alla Chiesa gliene frega di pi dei suoi soldini che al benessere di poveri? Noooooooooooooooooo....ma che penso... eresia se penso questo...  Ogni giorno che passo mi fa sempre pi schifo quella istituzione...con Benedetto XVI sta poi cadendo davvero in basso...scusa il mio sfogo, non sono contro i cattolici o i credenti, sono solo contro la Chiesa...

Di questi quattro 3 sono di struttura praticamente identica, sembrano addirittura copiati l'uno dall'altro, il quarto, quello di Giovanni,  ritenuto da moltissimi storici scritto da un altro Giovanni e non dall'apostolo.Inoltre il vangelo di Giovanni non riporta l'istituzione dell'eucarestia (per cui se fosse considerato singolarmente minerebbe l'esistenza logica stessa delle chiese e della messa cos come le conosciamo) In generale tutti e quattro sono stati tramandati oralmente per decenni dopo la morte di Ges prima di essere trascritti (mai fatto il gioco del telefono a scuola?).

Premettendo che sono ateo e che, a differenza di quanto pensano alcuni, non c' nulla di male nell'esserlo, essendo stato credente rispondo comunque alla tua domanda.   Quando credevo, pur avendo un punto di riferimento nella religione cattolica, mi sentivo spesso a disagio nei confronti di una classe ecclesiastica che predicava cose che, secondo me, erano in contrasto con alcuni principi del cristianesimo. Col tempo mi sono ritrovato con una religione personale, da cui avevo escluso le cose che non mi convincevano della religione cattolica. A quel punto ho pensato che la religione non avesse senso, visto che comunque me la costruivo a mia immagine e somiglianza, e dopo un lungo travaglio interiore sono giunto all'ateismo. Tuttavia... invidio chi ha fede, nonostante le contraddizioni, nonostante dei clericali che spesso non si mostrano coerenti o degni dei principi che professano, nonostante tante altre cose. In fondo comunque  una scelta personale... e come tale non deve per forza rispondere alla logica, ma solo al sentimento. Mi sento a disagio quando un credente mi aggredisce per il mio ateismo, ma mi sento altrettanto a disagio quando sento obbiettare ai credenti con argomenti razionali. Nel momento in cui si ha fede la razionalit la si accantona. E non  detto che sia un male.Ciao.|`|yetbZfl5aa	http://www.diggita.it/story.php?title=Se...|`|w0EshhFdaa	La tua domanda  piena di inesattezze!

Per almeno 20 anni  esistito il cristianesimo, predicato oralmente, e non esistevano i vangeli e gli altri libri del N.T, ( sono 27); che sono stati redatti appunto per fissare il genuino pensiero di Ges da parte di coloro che lo hanno conosciuto e vissuto con Lui. Per affermare che i vangeli sono stati manomessi, dagli stessi che li hanno scritti, o dettati come era consuetudine, occorrerebbe avere, come contronto, ci che pu aver detto Ges, che non ha scritto niente. Non si possono conoscere i "detti e fatti" di Ges di Nazaret, e sopratutto la sua risurrezione, se non attraverso chi ha redatto e selezionato, per averlo conosciuto di prima mano, il corretto pensiero di Ges. Non ti pare?  Circa le donne poi...... non hai mai sentito dire da Paolo " in Cristo non c' pi n uomo n donna, n libero n schiavo , n giudeo,n greco ma tutti in Cristo". Ges afferma, fra le molte cose del suo rivoluzionario messaggio, la perfetta uguaglianza e dignit fra uomo e donna in un mondo, e non solo allora, in cui le donne non avevano alcuna rilevanza sociale e potevano essere schiavizzate e trattate come non persone.|`|c3b5da6dfe9ba562dba1b857761166d4aa	Cara Jean , come molti fra i dinformati, anche tu confondi Dio e chiesa . Metti anche in relazione le attivit di Dio con quanto scritto nelle sacre scritture.   Errore colossale e probabilmente la vera causa della tragedia dell'Umanit.   Permettimi di chiarirti le idee.   DIO   Persona Politica e non religiosa!  Guida l'Universo che ha creato col Big Bang , attraverso Leggi laiche e Istituzioni Laiche e non religiose.   Dio detesta le religioni.Odia riti,templi,chiese,processioni,messe,par... tutto l'ambaradan religioso che tanto male ha fatto all'Umanit.  Tutte quello che si trova scritto su bibbie,corani,rotoli,sacri scritti, rotolini ect.ect. sono colossali baggianate che sono servite e servono ad uomini falasi e presuntuosi di dominare altri uomini.  Dio non s nulla di noi individualmente.E forse non  sempre presente nel nostro universo ( vi sono molti universi).  Dio DELEGA  il potere a suoi Rappresentanti distribuiti in migliaia di Galassie e Milioni di Pianeti abitati.  Dio non ha mai ordinato la Sua Adorazione , mai!  Chi OSA  rivolgersi a Dio lo pu fare liberamente ma con modestia ed in silenzio nel chiuso della propria casa.Al massimo alla presenza dei familiari strettissimi.  Dio non ha mai , mai,mai , voluto una Chiesa che lo rappresentasse!  Dio ci ha creati , per cosi dire , all'ingrosso! Guida una comunit Scientifica Divina che lo ha aiutato a fare emergere migliaia di Specie Intelligenti , allo scopo di Colonizzare l'Universo !  Per Dio ONNIPOTENTE  Donne e Uomini hanno gli stessi doveri e diritti , ma lavoro diverso . E lascia stare le baggianate bibliche che Dio non ha mai proferito.  Le Leggi di Dio sono Laiche , i Diritti sono fermamente stabiliti per tutti. Non c' la minima differenza fra i sessi o fra le specie. Sai quante specie intelligenti sono presenti solo nella nostra Galassia Via Lattea? pi di cinquecento! con decine di migliaia di razze al loro interno!   Perci figurati se Dio f differenze1  Sulla Terra a causa di avverse circostanze temporali le cose si sono messe male.Ed  stato necessario il trascorrere di molto tempo( le distanze Galattiche sono enormi , abissali), ma si spera che Presto i rappresentanti di Dio giungano a bordo delle loro meravigliose Astronavi , nei pressi della Terra. E daranno inizio finalmente al Regno di Dio. ciao.|`|851899fb35de91912e7f62a599333d8caa	Ki crede nella kiesa e nel dio di questa kiesa  un plagiato.|`|BEFWxs2gaa	IO NON CI CREDO X NIENTE NE IN DIO NE NELLA CHIESA|`|TvdDWJJ0aa	come fai tu a credere a cose riportate da altri?  sai cos la fede?  non  ilpapa o i preti o i vescovi e nemmeno il vangelo o la bibbia    la fede|`|nrJhIS67aa	io credo in Ges che  amore e che ci lascia liberi di scegliere|`|0199a486e42f928e4ca70934378cd78eaa	E tu perch non credi in Dio e nella Chiesa?     potrei controbbattere ad ogni tua asserzione.

Non per altro a loro stesse, per prime, Ges  apparso per prima come risorto ed ha dato loro il messaggio per gli apostoli. Poi, guarda bene, le donne sono sempre molto ben considerate da Ges e sempre gli sono vicine e con loro si relaziona. Cosa, a quei tempi, assolutamente contraria ai costumi del tempo.    Sicuramente manomessi i vangeli? e su quale basi lo pensi? E le testimonianze scritte di persone reali vissute non ti danno abbastanza certezze che quel che  scritto corrisponde al vero?|`|67a63154ad765390dfa605efa98acc3daa	Fai delle affermazioni non provate.   Sembri non sapere nulla di come e quali furono i testi accolti dai Padri della Chiesa n conosci che il Cristianesimo usa del Vecchio Testamento, ma non in senso letterale.   La teologia moderna considera infatti del tutto lecita la posizione di chi considera, giustamente, le figure di Adamo ed Eva per nulla reali, ma semplici allegorie, cos come tenta di evitare conflitti con gli evoluzionisti poich una parte di evoluzione  assolutamente accettabile. Leggi Moultmann che qualcosa ne sa in proposito.   Infine, i testi  ci sono pervenuti sono cos com'erano, salvo errori dovuti a traduttori o a copisti che per non sono cos significativi e dovrebbe farti riflettere che se davvero fosse tutta una manipolazione non si spiegherebbe perch i Vangeli sono quattro anzich uno. Visto che i Padri della Chiesa volevano tessere un grande inganno perch incasinarsi la vita con 4 vangeli, per di pi con alcune discrepanze l'uno dall'altro, anzich uno solo buono per tutti?   Ed infine le donne.   Suppongo che tu ignori del tutto qual'era la condizione della donna ai tempi di Ges.   Viveva in uno stato di sottomissione tale che non ce lo immaginiamo neppure e fu Ges a dare alla donna un ruolo particolarmente significativo.   A parte sua Madre, il cui ruolo conosciamo tuttu, coltiv amicizie e manifest rispetto verso numerose donne e, colmo dei colmi, fu ad una donna che apparve per primo, dopo la Resurrezione e fece qualcosa di straordinario perch a quella donna, "quella" in particolare, non credettero.   E se anche le donne all'interno della comunit ecclesiale non hanno avuto, secondo il tuo parere, peraltro del tutto opinabile, dei ruoli pi significativi ha pi a che fare con l'evolversi sociale del ruolo femminile, che religioso.   Nella societ civile e laica le donne hanno diritto di voto da pochi decenni mentre nella Chiesa hanno sempre e comunque detto la loro e se anche non sono apparse in pubblico non significa nulla.   Dopotutto non  forse vero che dietro ad un grande uomo c' sempre una grande donna, quindi....... se vale per la vita civile non vedo perch non dovrebbe valere lo stesso principio anche per la Chiesa.|`|JLwZlAhPaa	hai tr ragione !!!!finalmente qualcuno la penso cm me !!!volevo scrivere anche io una cs simile ma nn mi venivano le parole .......tu hai scritto esattamente cm la pensavo io !!BRAVVVVOOOOO  bacioni ciauzzz    hellas: xk nn esprimi le tue idea in modo pi educato !!!tutti possono credere in ci k vogliono eh|`|7840ecdc76a85b7a0658ee1fc7acd3c9aa	credere in Dio  un atto di fede individuale e talvolta dire p0erch ci si creda,o meno non  facile,appartenere ad una chiesa  un'altra cosa.In Italia poi dove la Chiesa Cattolica si  trasformata in un carrozzone politico-affaristico,si pu essere perfettamente cattolici e atei,pensate a 2 esempi famosi di papa-boys notoriamente atei l'ex pres.del Senato Pera e il giornalista Ferrara|`|0gOGyBc8aa	se per questo la Chiesa, durante l'inquisizione (500 anni), squartava vive le donne alla ricerca della loro anima in quanto, secondo loro, ne era priva, come gli animali!  cmq ritengo che la tua domanda sia sbagliata... nel senso: cosa centra Dio con la Chiesa? sono due cose COMPLETAMENTE diverse!|`|7174d938bcad7d5d0d15ae27608d9322aa	io credo in dio non posso negarlo anche se non vado in chiesa alla domenica o durante le feste anche se lo bestemmio oppure faccio l' incontrario di quello che dicono i 10 comandamenti.. insomma non sono un perfetto cristiano cattolico..  nella chiesa credo poco e anche nei preti..ci cono preti che ti mettono la voglia di vivere e t' insegnano tanto e altri che non fanno nulla per i giovani, li bastano i soldi per i restauri o per altre cose..  pero posso dire che una persona che mi ha fatto i brividi quando  morto  papa Giovanni secondo.. per me quell'uomo aveva qualcosa di speciale..

I love it here and you couldn't pay me to go back.|`|OlLMoT5Daa	Yep - when we came here to go to graduate school. The only people we knew were each other.  Then 4 years later, when we got a really good job offer, we did it again. And once more, when spouse got a job transfer to where we live now (all of this in the same state, btw, but across country from where we lived before).  Now we're about to move back to the mountains.    The regrets? Not having gone back to the mountains in 2000, regardless of pay cuts we would have suffered.    Issues - hmmm - well, when the kids were small, it was easier to move them.  As they got older, they left friends behind.  We even made my eldest a promise not to move from here until after high school graduation- we kept that promise.      Youngest, on the other hand, hates the heat and can't wait to move.    Issues like missing friends and such have been made less onerous thanks to the internet; youngest has one good friend here - they will keep in touch with easily.    Making friends - usually through work or school, sadly.  However, joining groups, taking the kids to various repeatable events helped us meet other people that we saw on a regular basis.    But I can't really answer that too well - all the people I would really consider friends live half a state a way, or are back home, where we're moving to.|`|ypaqEC6gaa	Yes I have.

In ancient times, during disputes between neighbors, people would swear on a god's name that they were telling the truth. For example, suppose that one man accused another man of stealing his goat. The two men would go in front their patriarch and swear by the name of God that they were telling the truth. But if one of them wasn't telling the truth and he still swore on God's name anyway, THAT would be taking the Lord's name in vain.     On another note, they're probably saying "God bless," to be polite. Would you prefer that they end their answers with, "F*** you?"    EDIT: I would as well. Unfortunately, the Y!Ablian thinks that profanity is a threat to national security. Or something.|`|AA10675202	maybe their doing it to piss you off  thats what i'm doing now, GOD BLESS, and f*** you.|`|OPeVDcOaaa	i am one of those people that end some of my answers that way and i do oit because this is the religious and spiritual section. i am not using GODs name in vain since i am using it to bless the people that are coming through with their questions as being Christians. if you have a problem with it then maybe you should be asking questions in another section.

L'altro disegno rappresenta lo Yin e lo Yang - Tao significa sia sentiero che "principio" e il diagramma mostra l'equilibrio tra due forze in contrasto che assieme formano una unit.    La Croce Tau ha un significato cabalistico - la lettera ebraica Tau o Tav equivale a 400 = 10x10x4 e indica il "tutto".    In effetti le simbologie sono molto vicine - da un punto di vista cabalistico anche la lettera Tau (come la parola Tao) indica sia la totalit che un sentiero.|`|9Y4iFZjraa	intanto il "tao" buddista non  qello che mostri, perch quello  appunto il tao taoista.

AA11945739	Other than the one about the word for "poisoner" being translated as "witch", I also like to remind people about the mistranslation found in the New Testament at the end of the Lord's Prayer.

If this is the case, then it makes no difference what day it is done on.     When we start to slip away from the truth, by trusting in dates, places and times. Then we have something to worry about. We need to stay focused on the Kingdom of Heaven, and the Gospel of Jesus Christ.    God be with you,  Evangelist, William M. Butler  Grace Evangelistic Ministry|`|RpymRo9eaa	Yes, there are translation errors.  But a God who could inspire the Bible initially, certainly can preserve it sufficiently so that it still contains all basic truths.  As Bible translation progresses, it becomes more accurate, and corrections are made.  I have made a search for the most accurate translation in English, which is still readable, and have learned that it is The New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, published by the Watchtower Society.  This was even a question on a TV game show, and the above translation was the correct answer.  If one checks out 1 John 5:7, it reads on way  in the KJV and different in most other Bibles.  Many Catholic Bibles have an asterisk at this scripture, and admit (at the botom of the page) they passed judgement, and added it to the scriptures.  The KJV continued this error|`|AA11232725	KJV Romans 8:26  Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.

Do these countless persons who use the King James Version know why, despite objections from churchmen, modern translations keep rolling off the presses? Do they know why the King James Version itself was once opposed by the people? Do they know why, despite vigorous protest and opspeaking world use and accept the King James or Authorized Version more than any other single Bible translation. In fact, so highly esteemed is this translation that many persons venerate it as the only true Bible. This raises some questions.     the King James Version entered into the very blood and marrow of English thought and speech? Do they know what illuminating document is probably missing from their own copies? In short, do they really know the King James Version?    The purpose of Bible translation, then, is to take these thoughts of God, originally written in Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek, and put them into the common languages of today. Bible translation makes Gods Book a living Book. So true Christians read the Bible, not to be entertained by clever turns of expression, unusual words, excellency of style, striking rhetorical devices or felicities of rhythm, but to learn the will of God. It was for this reason that the King James Version came into existence. That was in 1611.  From almost every quarter the King James Bible met opposition. Criticism was often severe. Broughton, a Hebrew scholar of the day, wrote to King James that he should rather be torn asunder by wild horses than allow such a version to be imposed on the church.    The translators, not unaware that people preferred to keep what had grown familiar, knew that their work had unleashed a storm. They tried to calm the people down. They wrote a Preface of the Translators to explain why the King James Version was made. This preface is called by the Encyclopedia Americana a most illuminating preface describing the aims of the translators which unhappily is omitted from the usual printings of the Bible. Thus most Authorized Versions today, though they contain a lengthy dedication to King James, omit the preface. Its presence would clear up many misunderstandings about the purpose of the revision. The reader would learn that strong opposition was expected.    The reader would learn that the King James Version was a revision of earlier works made with a modest hope of improvement and no thought of finality, In time the clamor died down, and the King James Version prevailed over the Geneva Bible. For more than two and a half centuries no other so-called authorized translation of the Bible into English was made. Little wonder that many people began to feel that the King James Bible was the only true Bible. Like many people who once objected to any change in the Geneva Bible, many persons today object to any change in the King James Bible. They oppose modern translations perhaps as vigorously as the King James Version itself was once opposed.    King James Bible has  been changed; today no one reads the King James Version in its original form. Explaining why this is so the book The Bible in Its Ancient and English Versions says: Almost every edition, from the very beginning, introduced corrections and unauthorized changes and additions, often adding new errors in the process. The edition of 1613 shows over three hundred differences from 1611,  It was in the eighteenth century, however, that the main changes were made,  The marginal references were checked and verified, over 30,000 new marginal references were added, the chapter summaries and running headnotes were thoroughly revised, the punctuation was altered and made uniform in accordance with modern practice, textual errors were removed, the use of capitals was considerably modified and reduced, and a thorough revision made in the form of certain kinds of words.    So many changes have been made, many of them in the readings of passages, that the Committee on Versions (1851-56) of the American Bible Society found 24,000 variations in six different editions of the King James Version!    What, then, of the objections raised by persons who say they do not want the King James Bible changed? Since the King James Version has already been changed, they lie on a crumbled foundation. If these persons do not want it changed, then why do they use, instead of a copy of an edition of 1611, an edition that has been changed?     They appreciate, perhaps unknowingly, the improvements the later editions have made. They do not like the odd spelling and punctuation of the 1611 edition; they do not want to read fet for fetched, sith for since or moe for more, as the edition of 1611 had it. Thus improvement, when needed, is appreciated, even by those who say they object to any changing of the King James translation.    One of the major reasons the Authorized Version is so widely accepted is its kingly authority. There seems little doubt that, had not a king authorized this version, it would not today be venerated as though it had come direct from God|`|GpCV6aAhaa	The KJV is the least accurate version of the bible in existence--it's only popular because it's an "easy reader"|`|9fa1adb1c8a5e488f13a34915c1381ceaa	Yeah, here's a biggie: "Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live."

I believe those who put together the KJV put in "easter" to accommodate Constantine who proclaimed  Christmas and Easter to be Christian holidays, since the pagans in the Roman Empire celebrated their feasts or holidays on these days. I don't believe you will find "easter" in any other translation.|`|AA10265303	I prefer the King James Bible overall over other versions. I simply correct where correction is warranted. I do not feel it is a thing to be argued over. If one likes the NIV and another likes the Good News Bible and another likes the New American Standard Bible and another likes the New Living Bible and another likes the Amplified or Youngs, or Darby's, or whatever, that is fine with me. I prefer the KJV, and I have a reason for that, but my feeling is whatever Bible a person uses, the Holy Spirit can grab them good.|`|MJTmglcsaa	Many. In constructing and editing the text, Erasmus had the feeblest of manuscript resources. He chiefly used one manuscript of the Gospels, dating from the twelfth century, and one manuscript of Acts and the Epistles, also from the twelfth century. These he edited and corrected, using one or two additional manuscripts of each section, along with his Latin Vulgate. For Revelation, Erasmus had but one Greek manuscript which, though of better than average quality (so says Hort), yet lacked the last six verses of the book.  http://www.kjvonly.org/doug/kutilek_eras...    There are now over 6000 and they are older and more reliable.  I was a KJV only guy until I lifted my head out of the sand and began studying for myself.

Wrap the lid and box separately so he doesn't have to tear up the paper and make a mess, just lift the lid. Instead of a big gaudy bow, something more understated. If you don't know how to do origami, ask people you know. You would be suprised how many people can make a nice crane to put on top of the lid.|`|272rNqf8aa	The ceremony of the gift giving is more important than the wrapping.  Offer your gift with two hands and a slight bow.  Don't be surprised if it's refused, just politely insist that he accept it.   Offer the gift at the end of the meeting with a simple mention earlier that you brought something for him.  The gift will not be opened in your presence, he will open it after you leave.  Wrap your gift in quality paper with no bows or ribbons.  Don't use white (it symbolizes death) or very bright colors.  Wrap it perfectly or have it done for you, he will appreciate the time and effort you spent.

AA11923447	Yes. My patron saint, St. Camillus, didn't seriously pursue his education until he was a grown adult. He was a fighter, and a very large man. He was a gambling addict, lost everything he owned, and had a war wound that wasn't healing. He had everything going against him. But he gave his life to God and turned everything around. He not only educated himself, but spent the rest of his life healing the sick, helping the wounded on military battlefields, and building hospitals.     http://saints.sqpn.com/saintc09.htm|`|58abdcb0652955a0d84a28b08b3cab8eaa	Is that Catholic?

VdTn7Gmbaa	Yes I have.    And in short time,   the Lord revealed to me that it was a demon.  I would only share my experience if you e-mailed me,  and said you are seeking only to do the will of God.  Because such experiences are not of God.  And that's not somewhere I want to be.

God has not given us a spirit of fear but of power and love and a sound mind.  Greater is He that is within me than he satan that is in the world.  So because we know our authority in Christ, no weapon that is formed against us shall prosper.  Yes, they will come to put fear in us but we have alread won the battle.|`|SgGB9Ji7aa	Familiar spirits are those that impersonate the dead, hence the name familiar.

The Word explicitly tells us the dead are dead and awaiting Christs return.  A sances is nothing more than the contact of devil spirit(s) which are familiar with the one who died .and the thing that hooks people in, is the personal information that only the dead person could know .the dead person ..or familiar spirits.

38f15601baa14cb41ff2021454524fbbaa	The so-called "Buddha" statues of a large man with his hands uplifted are actually representations of Ho Tei, a monk known for his size and his wisdom. Anyone who attains self-mastery is called a buddha, but they are not the same as the original Buddha.    As someone else has already pointed out, being fat in some cultures means that you are wealthy enough to eat well. You have to be very lucky to amass such wealth. Because Ho Tei was so large, he is considered a good omen by some Chinese, and that's the origin of rubbing his stomach for luck.|`|e16a8c7e1eb3c7768d0c63de7a721e75aa	"any of you people who belevie in him."

The Chinese representation of Buddah often includes a rounded pot belly stomach because this is representing happiness, good luck and plentitude.  The Buddah is not lacking in nourishment, rather being given plenty to eat, plus goodies because there is no lacking, wanting or needs.  The other explanation that I found says that in history, one monk who had Buddha qualities was being desired after for a husband by many others and he became fat in order to not be the object of desire.  |`|0l1ZairMaa	LOL  You're cute!

To my opinion, as you very well noticed that the Holy Quran is the final descending of the holy book and Mohammad(PBUH) is the last prophet of God.  Owing to this, it is affirmative that God is not going to choose another prophet and if you are hoping to get something to be a prophet, you might as well forget about it.

Who are you to say that, someone who does not believe in god needs god in their life right now? Who gave you the role of authoritarion in matters of theism and atheism? Where do you get off proclaiming her as your mission. She is a person, a human being, not a task. Atheism is a choice, it is not wrong and it is not bad. Don't you dare presume that her beliefs need to be proven wrong and yours need to be proven right. If you were a true friend or any kind of friend then you'd just let it be and just accept her beliefs. The main factor in friendship is acceptance, what you are doing is the complete opposite.

Everyone has a Jinn {devil, although some are righteous, they also have free-will, that is to obey or disobey almighty God} and an angel. The jinn whispers in our ear, or mind, in our own voice to sin.     Remember Satan's greatest deception is to convince you he dos not exist!, thats why some people insult God for the ishaps and bad times in life, and not the devil, or themselves for not being patient, and perservering through hardship.    The west believe, regardin the brain/mind relationship, that the mind is a product of biochemical reactions and firing neurons {brain cells} in the brain,  whereas the eastern belief is that the brain, the physical organ, is a medium through which thoughts are channeled by supernatural forces, like devils, angels ect.  I believe both schools of thought are correct, sometimes we think evil thoughts {lying, swearing, insults, back biting, suicidal thoughts, even murder}, and sometimes good deeds are suggested to us {giving to charity, greating strangers with a smile, ect.}, from nowhere.   But if your doing some maths calculations your neither thinking of good or evil thoughts, thus just using the physical biochemical brain, the western concept of the mind/brain relationship.    Where was I, oh yea...    Once you pass away, your soul returns to Allah, and your jinn is left to roam around, usually in the place of death, or at home. Jinns live for thousands of years, or at least many centuries.   Once they are freed from their duty of trying their best to entice you and send you to Hell, the Jinn are free to work for black magic magicians, high level freemasons, secret societies, kabbalists, the church of Satan, & occultists and in return the individual who seeks their help is doomed to hell-fire, since they are committing blasphemy, and [the human magicians] are ordered by the Jinn to worship them, and do horrific things with the revelations of God .   Jinns may also stick around the house and cause trouble, slamming doors, dropping photos/paintings, noises, ect.     When Jinn enter our realm, the physical realm {from the spiritual realm}, they utilise the surrounding energy [heat energy, and possibly other unknown forms], thus the room goes colder when 'ghosts' or jinn appear.    In Islam there is no need to interfere with the Jinns, since most follow Satan, and will lead man astray, since they have 1000's of years of experience at doing that. Unless, it is by a holy righteous man, whom is feeing an individual from Jinn/demon posession, or removing troublesome Jinns from a house. Why a holy righteous man? and not you & me, well a righteous holy man has his a firm faith, and thus can deal with it, whereas you and I can easily be decieved, and possibly possessed by the Jinn in question.  Just like heavy weight boxing... you and I are not prepared to enter a ring, we would lose...    Other than that, it is not reccommended to talk to them, and your grandmothers soul is not roaming the earth, but is with God.     Your loved ones will meet you in your dreams, dressed in white, and reassure you everything is okay, my sister and mum have seen my nan in their dreams, she was eating large grapes in heaven. A rule of thumb, if in your dreams you meet anyone whom is now disceased, and if they give you something then it is a glad tiding, and if they take something from you in that dream then it is a bad omen/sign.      Hope this helps|`|Z20AjHw1aa	When someone dies, it is natural to seek reassurance.  I too lost my mum nearly 20 years ago and still miss her a lot.    Personally though, I would not try to contact anyone who has died as the bible forbids it. As I trust God, I believe he says this for good reason, therefore,  I will just have to wait to see her when I too pass away.    There are many different theories what happens to us when we die, but only God knows which one is the truth.  I personally believe that if it doesn't match with what God says, then it is someone or something else trying to deceive you and turn you away from the truth.|`|db746d99346ead6be618f50d54d0d0baaa	When someone dies they can not contact anyone. When a person dies they are in another place (neither Heaven nor Hell). After they are buried they are asked three questions involving their beliefs.Some will go to Heaven and some will go to Hell. The one who is dead will see where they will go (Heaven or Hell) after The Day of Judgment.    Sometimes God gives dreams -to those who believe in Him and who are obedient to Him -about the situation of a loved one who was martyred.|`|t1LCnFV3aa	I do not think they can really contact us. It is a nice sentiment though|`|JqHkgWROaa	Bible says not to speak with the dead.     |`|nHizaTiDaa	I don't believe that those who have gone on before us can contact us.  Just because the Bible forbids "necromancy",  the contacting of the dead. So I do not know what to think- that it is forbidden because the dead are "asleep" and the spirits are just the fallen angels that spiritualists contact??    Personally I do not think we can communicate with the dead.|`|AsyB1qLyaa	I'm Christian and my parents are in heaven before the throne of God. They are not trying to talk to me.|`|7d647be57724929a656a84a04d156140aa	The dead has no contact with the living, after they have departed this life.  Regardless to what people say, one has to have a body to legally live on earth and after death as you well know the body decays.|`|MXYWSsM7aa	The scriptures says that to be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord. 2 Cor. 5:8. After a person dies they don't go back to speak to anybody. Read Luke 16:26 which talked of the rich man who speaking to Abraham wanted the beggar, Lazarus, to go and speak to his brothers so he could warn them to change their ways. This verse says..."between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, so that those who want to pass from here to you cannot, nor can those from there pass to us."  Tell your mom to be very careful because there is such a thing as "familiar" spirits. They come in the form of a person but is rather a deceiving spirit. Leviticus 19:31 says, Give no regard to mediums and familiar spirits; do not seek after them, to be defiled by them: I am the Lord your God.  Thanks for the question.|`|reO9Dgmsaa	I'm a Christian, and I do not believe that the dead can contact us, except through demonic means (tarot, Ouija boards, mediums, etc), and obviously I am not into that!!!  Once someone is in heaven or hell, they stay there.  |`|QbLAGwCkaa	Your mom might be schizophrenic.  im not joking.  there's no such thing as ghost or spirit, when you die, you cease to exist.  I'd suggest you take your mom to your family doctor or to a psychiatrist.|`|eKFaUPvoaa	No one knows what happens when we die. Religion exists to try to eliminate fear of death and to comfort those left behind. I personally don't think the dead can contact the living but very many people do and if it comforts them what possible harm can it do. I think heaven and hell are states we live in, states of mind if you like and not places the soul travels to after death. If there is a soul that goes on then it woul dbe logical that death cleanses the soul and prepares it for the next life free of memories.|`|jtEOvGKsaa	Your body stays in the ground, but your spirit goes to God.. So no her mom could not try to contact her, but God could show her her mom in dreams to reassure her, it's a gift from God..

dAdoSoclaa	You must believe that everything happens for a reason and that you have no control over other peoples actions. The only thing that you can control is how you feel about it. You can choose to dwell in it and feel bitter or you can set yourself free and be happy and grateful for every good thing that is present in your life. Set your mind on all that is good and lovely, enjoy every moment that God is giving you. Choose only good fruit and discard the bad ones. When God closes one door he always opens the other.         God Bless |`|WAPB6kqkaa	I believe that bitterness is something we do to ourselves.  It's not something that someone does to us.  If you are a Christian then give this to Christ.  It may not be an immediate relief but in His time He will remove this bitterness.  If you're not a Christian, then you have two choices you can come to Christ in repentance and offer this problem to Him OR you can seek the world's way and try to find a stress therapist/counsellor to work thru this issue.  Bitterness can destroy a person if they are not careful.  They have to truely repent of the bitterness, not just say Help me Lord!  You have to show remorse in that you know that harboring bitterness is wrong, and then God who sees the heart will answer you.  That is what I would do.|`|ggIrBJoBaa	it's all in the surrender... keep praying that he will take the bitterness and soften your heart... he will. have faith!|`|0c9JITaWaa	in between?

The Root must be done away with and then bitterness can not spring up    YOU know what that 'root' is and why it is and how it started and where it started and Only You can then deal with it and allow God to help you then dig it up and get rid of it for good .  It starts with acknowledging the truth concerning it and then doing something about it and as with everything else it starts with ...  You !!|`|7d647be57724929a656a84a04d156140aa	Forgive the person who hurt you.  When you do this, it releases you and give you that freedom from the pain and hurt that was inflicted upon you.  It is not easy, but it works.|`|MuCXCZKPaa	This is hard. The best advice I can give you is that you should act with forgiveness until you feel it. Someone I trusted completely, hurt me horribly once. With God's help, I forgave them but the bitter feelings were still there. They would surface at odd times when I least expected it.     I knew that I could be swallowed up in this awful bitterness...but I didn't want to be that person. With God's help and sheer determination, I was able to get past the bitter feelings and down to the honest and real forgiveness. And so can you...good luck and Blessings!|`|5BoZsFesaa	I have found two things that are incredibly helpful and equally difficult to do.     -One is to pray for the person that offended you.  Pray that they be blessed in life and pray that they be forgiven.  Pray for good things for them and pray in sincerity.  Do this for two weeks on a daily basis and if your bitterness towards them has been relieved, good.  If not, you might want to continue for a while longer.    -the Second is to clean up your side of the street.  Most of the time when we are bitter with others we have had some role in the event or events that lead to the ill feelings.  Ask for forgiveness from God and, when appropriate, from the other party.  Keep in mind that the only context of your conversation should be in regards to your trespasses, not theirs.  No need to mention what they did to put you in a bad position, they know what they did.  And when they want relief from their conscience they'll tell you.    I know these things sound difficult and they surely are.  But the benefits of executing them effectively are tremendous.  
6645fec6d8799737e024f54f2e868937aa	A more accurate description would be that the path to heaven is narrow, not the minds of those who trod on it.  And the path is wide that leads to destruction.  I'd much rather be called "narrow minded" or "close minded," and spend eternity with my Father, than be so open minded, my brains fall out and I miss the mark as God's Word says so many will.    D1|`|mVSC9aKoaa	each and every social system is closed minded with respect other system.  In some respect I also would say that west too is closed minded with respect east and vise versa.    The word "closed-minded" is just a term to ridicule anyone different from you.|`|AA11232725	It's close minded to everything that contradicts the divine revelation of the Scriptures.|`|SqhGr6e3aa	Yes. However, some of its followers are intelligent enough to discard some parts of their texts and dismiss some more as mere allegory.|`|ZtEVlc0yaa	Hm.    I'd say that Christians can be closed-minded... :]|`|nSwwHot4aa	At the start of every religion is a core idea that is later on tainted by close minded individuals. Christianity contains a multitude of close minded individuals, but let's take a look at the mastermind behind the core values of Christianity-Jesus.  This man traveled, gave sight to the blind, preached, was non-violent yet human in every way. Was he close minded? No, he wasn't.  And yes the gospels are historically accurate, all written by 70 AD, containing eye witness accounts, and many letters to other believers where found as well, dating WAYYYY back. And do you think thousands upon thousands, including ALL of the disciples (except John) would be martyred for a lie? Nope, doesn't sound likely to me.   So in the end, I would say no.   Jesus did not advocate the killing of "gays" He was the embodiment of God. Trust me, I read Nihilist philosophers all the time (Such as Nietzsche) and consider their points of view, as I am an Ex-Atheist, yet I found The idea of a God more likely then the idea of no God, A watch is evidence of a watch maker.\  You cannot condemn Christianity for the Crusades, because Jesus never advocated the slaughter of non-believers. Again, this was caused by close minded "people"  God, in himself, is impossible to comprehend. Think of it as trying to teach a kitten algebra. It is beyond our reason completely.|`|NsLtN7oLaa	No, they just murdered millions of people to try  to combat overpopulation...|`|Fpi8im9taa	Absolutely, at least as described in the Bible.

I don't think so.  |`|oJ6yixyGaa	Of the Christians I've known, maybe one fifth of them have been open to considering other viewpoints. Most have been close minded and dogmatically myopic even as they take very personal and self-centered views of their beliefs. I've also noticed that the earlier they were indoctrinated, the more unable and/or unwilling they are to consider other religious beliefs.    Christianity can be for seekers of wisdom and truth, but it rarely is.|`|Rt4bJfVAaa	How can Christians be closed minded when their belief system includes the impossible?  God.    I am closed minded in believing man has all the answers to some questions. But can man answer these questions?    How was the universe created?  Did intelligence or love or consciousness exist before the universe and man existed?  Is there life after death?  Why are the ancient creation and flood stories around the world so similar when most of the peoples never met?  Is there intelligent life in the universe?  Are there other intelligent beings other man man?  Does God love me?  What are the names of man's first parents?  Does man just have a physical body or does he have a soul?  Is the soul eternal?    Christianity has these answers and much more and calls them the truth.   Would you say this is a closed minded religion?  I wouldn't.|`|rz4AUvbaaa	If "close-minded" means sure of one's beliefs, then yes.  You must be sure before you can live and demonstrate Christianity in this time.|`|AA12383652	How can a religion be closeminded?    Being closeminded means that you arent willing or havent been willing to look at all sides and evidence and arguments before coming to your conclusions and that if anything else ever came up that you would never even consider it.  It does not mean that you cant make a definitive conclusion or choose a side on something.    Atheists have decided that there is no God.  Does that make them closeminded because they wont consider the possibility, after making a decision, that there is a God?      Christians arent anymore closeminded or openminded than anyone else.  Some humans are and some arent, in ALL walks of life.|`|ypGtSfZqaa	i think a lot of christians are closed minded.|`|DuyuUJNDaa	That depends upon how close-minded the observers are.|`|nyNNaEFTaa	All religion is closed minded.

You are on this earth alone....all your friends, family, TV news anchors, store clerks, etc.....they cannot help you.  You are born into the world for one purpose...to serve the Lord...it doesn't matter if you believe it or not....    The only reason people fight it is because they do not want to have anyone telling them they can or cannot do something....so they come up with ways to deny it...evolution, atheism, denial, etc.    This is the truth...this is what love is....    ....the only perfect formula for love is the ability to walk away....that's it....it's that simple.    There is no other way, no other recipe.    If you have a wife and she doesn't want to stay with you, she can leave...if you put a gun to her head, she may stay and say she loves you, but it wouldn't be real love.    God loves you with the PERFECT formula...the only formula...the only REAL way to love.    BUT, if you "divorce" Him...there is only one place that the Lord chooses NOT to be....Hell. So, if hell is the only place that God chooses not to be and a person doesn't want anything to do with God....where are they going to send themselves?    Why is this so hard for people to understand?    It doesn't matter if what we think is right or wrong or fair.....God loves us and most people spit in his face....just read all these atheists and non-believers on Answers. All other beliefs are wrong....Islam, Mormons, jehovah witnesses, Buddhists, etc.....they are wrong....period.    Accept the Lord Jesus Christ...repent of your sins (turn away from them)...seek a good church (be careful, many are fake or feel good churches)....google Charles Stanley, Way of the Master.    Time is short...no time to be nice about it...take a stand for Christ even if there is a price to be paid...i.e. persecution. Jesus said" Blessed is he who is persecuted for my name sake"!|`|RCn1Y3Ogaa	The religion is very close-minded, the individuals are not necessarily so.    Their faith demands that their followers damn all of us that are not of the faith to Hell, and shunned women, homosexuals, and other races for many years. When presented with a logical theory that provides several proofs, they shut their minds, and declare that the theory is false and the evidence were planted by Satan himself.    Of course, not all of the followers of this faith would listen so.

But the problem is that 'close-minded' has negative connotations.

I started fancying him because of his stories, I felt so excited whenever he talked to me in details about his love stories, but I was scared telling him that I was gay because I wanted to keep seeing him,  so I pretended I was straight, but with not much luck with women, he started giving me advise, and we became close for the months I knew him, then I decided to suggest that we view a porn film together, eventually we ended up with mutual contact! and him saying that he always liked to experience what women feeling when they do it, and he said that he liked it more now."|`|41f87befa19fa02565c50a9a3b435677aa	I met someone who was pretty sure that they were a lesbian but was just afraid to live that lifestyle.

Acorda, n?o s?o somente os homens que gostam de fantasias na cama.  Primeiro vc tem que saber diferenciar a Trai??o, das Puladas Tradicionais.    Trai??o de um mulher: qdo ela n?o encontra mais em casa o que sonhou um dia ser eterno (paix?o, carinho, aten??o, companheirismo...)    Trai??o de um homem: ocorre qdo ele acha que n?o tem mais em casa o que ele desejava. Na cama, planeja rela??es com sua parceira, e que aprendeu em filmes. N?o se importa com a reciprocidade, somente com a satisfa??o pessoal.    Pulada da mulher: ela quer se realizar sexualmente, quer um homem atraente, com barriguinha tanquinho, coxas bem torneadas, hlito gostoso, e que fa?a um sexo inesquecvel. N?o se apega emocionalmente. Usa abusa e chega em casa pronta para seu parceiro, como se nada tivesse acontecido.    Pulada do homem: passa uma mulher na rua de roupa colada, transparente, saia curta, nem precisa olhar na cara, passa uma cantada barata e logo imagina a transa. Acaba repetindo a dose com a mesma, ocasionando vnculos.    Colega, comece a repensar nas suas atitudes.  Apesar de muitas mulheres dizerem que falta homem no mercado,  pura mentira.

These kids are way out of line and need to learn to respect the beliefs of others.  In the end, their behaviour says a lot more about them than it says about Christianity. They are making themselves look like awful, intolerant people. It says nothing about you, but speaks volumes about the sort of people they are.

Would you please show me the same courtesy I show you and not mock me for it?"  Jumble it together to make it sound more casual if you like, but this sentence says a few things.  it says YOU have a right to believe as you wish.

Our method of government is our choice, God provides the options within that choice.  If our leader was entirely God's will, Christ would be here now ruling from His throne in Jerusalem.  It is not yet God's time, but it is coming.    We were provided with many choices for our potential president - Huckabee, Romney, Obama, McCain, and others.  Because the mindset of America is focused on worldly events such as the economy (money), and wars (the world) rather than on God, we have for our two choices worldly men.  Since we rejected a godly candidate, God provided a second option to give us one more chance.    God provided the best candidates based on what we desired as the qualities our "king."|`|2Hot9EJiaa	I believe that God places in power who He chooses too place in power, and so yes, I do believe what Palin said to be true.  BUT that said, I also believe that He gives the people who they ask for as well.  Look at the Biblical account of the Israelites who wanted someone to rule over them, wanted one just like themselves, so God gave them Saul.  David was His first choice, but sometimes God allows rulers that people ask for.  I do not believe at all that Obama would be God's first choice for us, due to the fact that he is so blatantly for abortion, not just pro-choice, and also ok with gay marriage- however let me tell you this, that does not mean that God will not allow him to be president.

The truth is that God may use a very evil president to punish a very evil country. Or, God could show mercy and provide us with a very decent man and woman as President and Vice-President.  We may know on Nov 4.  If we get an evil president the economy will basically flat line, tax rates will increase, enemies will be emboldened and certainly the holocaust of killing the unborn will expand.

In the past God had raised up kings for His plan and purpose to accomplished His will here on the earth.  Sometimes it's hard to understand the divine purpose of God.  Although we have to vote to put a man in authority to rule and lead over our nation, God can divinely intercede or upset plans made by man.

He allows only that which will prove that he is perfectly just in the end. We exercise our free will because he gave us it, but everything we do is not his will, and if Obama wins it will only have been God's will if in the end it shows that God was just in allowing him to be president.    For example, America is heading for destruction because of rebellion against God, so, will Obama bring America into position for final judgment, or will Obama being president cause some to repent? The anwers to these questions will prove God's justice in the end.    edit:    I didn't mean to single Obama out.

AA10137898	Natural Disasters are used as examples of God's wrath with mankind, they are looked upon as God drastically showing mankind that it has gone wrong.

It also gets me to think those people saying that are quite hateful themselves.
04b915390b8f014786ba54a145bb8cf1aa	Yo creo q esto no es cierto. Una persona sensible no esconde sentimientos y los muestra como son. Mas bien es fuerte porque no tiene miedo de mostrar lo que siento y no tiene verguenza de que los demas sepa como se siente. De verdad que se toma mucho valor mostrar quien es uno, lo que siente y piensa.

Es para que sienta que tu tambien tienes el poder de herirla, sin ambargo no lo haras mas, para no herirla. Y que sienta que te puede perder, que no eres de su propiedad.|`|04b915390b8f014786ba54a145bb8cf1aa	Porque las pasiones son tan grandes que q veces pasan cosas que uno no puede controlar y simplemente ocurren. La verdad es dificil de responder. En todas las relaciones, por mas amor puro que haya siempre van a haber obstaculos y dificiltades, pero si el amor es verdadero todo se supera y se soluciona.  Ademas, yo creo que siempre hay campo para el perdon, por mas profunda que sea la herida.

If he can't be discussed because one of us is too "lowly" then you can continue to believe without any rational support while you dismiss all objections as unnecessary.    All humans are equally unequal, yet we manage to communicate and raise each other up pretty well, so no, your assertion is clearly false.    Another thing I find offensive in this concept is that it encourages people NOT to communicate, and this is a time in human history when communication is more important then ever.  It also justifies moral arrogance and gives egotists a tool they can use to unassailably elevate themselves on a moral pedstal.|`|gGmMw2vDaa	Sounds goofy and empty to me.

GOD's Nut!  Ditto..........  There is  a Book by Rick Joyner--called the Last (something or other, can't recall at the moment), the Last "battle", "fight" or something--oh well, it is from Morning Star Ministries---Fort Mill , South Carolina.

Water mixes with many things. Oil is an exception. Slaves are equal, are you sure about your concept of equals .    If you are talking about the most high, not to get high, then I recommend you reexamine the basics. The basics for the Christians is the bible. Trying reading it sometime.
F9eQiuJxaa	i agree with christian 101.i don't want to be sarcastic though.but you know,i did have a bad childhood then i became a christian. i think i needed that bad childhood days to make me realize how much i needed GOD more.maybe,if i had a complete wonderful childhood life,i would not have humbled myself before GOD.but just like what the others here shared,they had wonderful life as kids but they also learned that despite their completeness they still needed Christ.i hope i somehow helped in enlightening your mind.|`|AA12346187	we are all individuals  my mum  died  when Iw as 11 and yes it  was hard  but  my parents  were never abusive  to us.|`|MvZMA5BGaa	I had very loving and mature parents.  I became a Christian at age 28, nine years after my father died and I was living in a different city from my mother.  Put simply, Jesus Christ cut across my path.

They no longer have to think of the past, but can live instead for the wonderful life God has planned for them. It gives them a purpose, and a reason to keep living.     But there are just as many Christians that haven't had bad lives at all. I was raised a Christian, though never forced, and now my faith is as strong as ever... even though for the most part my life has been without difficulties.    =]]

I'm not saying it wasn't INSPIRED by God, but it's been around a long time, how do we know someone didn't change it? the bible makes God seem like some *** who wants to make people suffer..    I mean..God makes people the way they are, right? Okay, so that means he makes gay people the way they are. Alright then, apparently, God also sends you your true love. So, God makes you gay, He sends you your true love which is going to be the same sex as you. But then, the bible says that's a sin. So what the hell is that? God makes people like the same sex, he sends them their true love...Then he says it's a sin to be with said person..According to the bible.     I could possibly go to hell for not believing in the bible, but if God is what everyone claims he is, he will understand my reasons for not believing the bible, it's manmade, very old, therefore we cannot tell if it is the original bible, or if someone just changed it. What if we're wrong for believing in the bible? Because what if it was changed, and now we're believing in all this false BS that someone felt like adding to it.|`|WG65l9Dtaa	No.  There were only Noah and his wife and Noah's three sons and their wives.

Did they sin ? Most probably. Did they commit grave sins (such as homosexuality) ? not necessarily. If they did commit grave sins, did they repent from it ? Probably.|`|fJ1dII6oaa	Right next to the bigots!|`|a993fdffebb5d1eb64fe6baba1499d98aa	No. Noah took only animals and family. His sons and their wives and himself and his wife.

You need to tell the police, but then maybe try to help them catch him trying to do something.

If they see a problem, they will arrest him for attempted statutory rape.  Your sister may think she is ready or wants to do something with this guy but the reality is that a 24 year old is much more socially competent and will convince her to do things that she will be very angry about in hindsight.

I would also advice her parents!!!!! They need to protect her from scum like him!!!|`|RJX1FYY0aa	You should go tell your parents right now. If she hates you now, she will get over it.

You should just be honest with her and tell her you were looking through her texts, but only because you care about her. She may be upset for a day or two, but what's the worst she could do? You should deffinitely tell her that it's not safe, and you need to make her realise this fast. My friend trusted this guy on vacation whom she knew for only about a week, and so she started hooking up with him (he was also 25), and he ended up raping her.

Sorted|`|oqs6n07aaa	I would find a way to light some FIRE under his tail.     Tell your folks and then have someone approach him privately about it. Let him know that he'd better back off, or ELSE!     Do NOT take a "passive" stance. That is a big mistake that parents make. They're so afraid of making their teenager angry. Also, do not depend on your sister to break it off with him. She's young and when you tell her, she'll probably go ballistic, lie to your parents and sneak around with him, because teenagers often don't know what's good for them until it's much too late.     I wouldn't tarry. He is the adult and you must deal with him quickly before he goes way too far -- if he hasn't already.

Infelizmente este objetivo foi perdido por muitos....  A parada gay como quaiquer outros eventos acabou se tornando uma grande balbrdia, os organizadores precisam se esmerar mto mais na produ??o deste evento, mas em contrapartida eles n?o podem ser responsveis por atos animalescos de pessoas q perdem o controle, e isto h aos montes por a, principalmente no nosso t?o famoso carnaval,  q infelizmente a mdia acaba destacando mais por convenincia os pontos negativos!

Se todos sem exce??es somos obrigados a pagar impostos, votar, temos direitos diferentes de homossexuais pq?   claro, q todo mundo tm direito a defender o q acha correto, e eu como simples ser humano n?o sou diferente, defendo sim o direito dos gays, afinal s?o seres humanos tanto quanto ns.....

Falavam de foli?es, do carnaval fora de poca (palavras da prpria mdia e era o que estava parecendo mesmo), dos roubos, das pessoas sendo atendidas por terem consumido excessivamente lcool, enfim de toda a folia.    Ah, falaram bastante tambm de o quanto essa micareta  rentvel, (apenas financeiramente), que a cada 1 real investido na parada, lucra-se 169 reais.  Agora est?o querendo negociar a parada na bolsa de valores.        Desculpa se eu estiver enganada, mas em momento algum eu vi falarem do movimento, em momento algum eu vi ressaltarem a causa, o que eu vi foi carnaval, aonde as pessoas v?o para se divertir e tudo  vlido (assim como em qualquer carnaval), assim aparentemente h a impress?o de que as pessoas sabem conviver com a diversidade, mas no dia seguinte  que podemos ver que n?o passou de mais um dia de festa.|`|qaOyTdONaa	Direito que direita?

O assunto acaba sendo debatido na mdia, ganha visibilidade, faz as pessoas discutirem, repensarem. E, quem vai, ou  de alguma "minoria" sexual (gay, lsbica, bi, transgenero, travesti, e outros mais), ou  simpatizante da causa e reconhece nosso valor na sociedade. Por mais que seja uma festa legal, ningum levanta uma bandeira com a qual n?o se identifica. - E por que essa visibilidade, essa passeata, tem que ser desanimada? Desanimo n?o  sin?nimo de seriedade.    Por mais, achei o evento organizado. Um evento que rene 5 milh?es de pessoas na avenida paulista ter apenas 20 furtos e um ou outro caso isolado e pequeno  digno de receber os parabns pela organiza??o. N?o tem que ser perfeito, furto, roubo, consumo de drogas, tinha polcia l, mas  impossvel reprimir completamente. Nem em eventos de primeiro mundo isso n?o  possvel. (n?o que eu ache o Brasil inferior ao primeiro mundo... ns podemos :D)

You're American aren't you?|`|KegKa9praa	Simply because, there are things that are mentioned in the bible, and then there are things that aren't mentioned in the bible.  But if i were you, i would suggest looking in the koran (Qur'an) because there are a lot of things that have been mentioned in the koran and that has happened. Even Scientific things. I'm not telling you to switch religions or anything. I'm just saying check it out cause if you are trying to find answers like that, then the koran is where to look at.   Oh yea, i would suggest the one that has the translation in english.   If you need help you can ask me or a person who might know that could help you in that department.   At the mean time... Good Luck :D  |`|ShyVe17zaa	it was predicted!   1Ti 6:20  O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called:1Ti 6:21  Which some professing have erred concerning the faith.     Gen 11:1  And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.   Gen 11:2  And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.   Gen 11:3  And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them throughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter.   Gen 11:4  And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.     That after man and God separated their ways (Genesis 3); then man start seeking on how to truly live by his own way; own knowledge and understanding and own efforts! Pro 14:12  There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.     2Ti 3:1  This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.   2Ti 3:2  For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,   2Ti 3:3  Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,   2Ti 3:4  Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;   2Ti 3:5  Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.   2Ti 3:6  For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,   2Ti 3:7  Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.   |`|csLjgFCnaa	because we never went in to space!!! but seriously, the bible focuses on the things that effect us spiritually. Just because most people believe that man actually went to the moon (instead of being made on some movie set) doesn't mean that the bible isn't accurate. why is space being associated with the end of the world anyways? are you saying that we are in the end times, because we likely are not in the end times. man's exploration of space has absolutely nothing to do with the end of the world or the bible, it is simply something that man supposedly accomplished|`|8HK2VzfQaa	The bible, (and its writers) make amazing use of Effective Prophecy, by which I mean, they are able to have worded their prophecies so carfully that any of their people can claim AFTER the fact that whatever happened was god's doing.  that way, religious leader can pick and choose what events and encounters are going to be applied to their religion (and they can ignore the stuff thats not benificial to the church)  E.g. Christians are happy to take credit that the huge flood in the Middle East (in acient times) was courtesy of their 'eternally merciful god' but! the whole contradiction of heaven being in the sky, and humanity has both proven the existence of space AND gone to it has been calmly ignored by the church|`|a5JesB5Paa	The first part of your question is answered in the scriptures, I can't remember the verse.

It only predicts the stuff with the greatest religious significance.      Besides, why ruin the surprise?|`|N53y9qohaa	Hello,    True. The Bible is a handbook or guide to tell you how God revealed himself to man, how we should please him, live with one another but goes on to tell us what shall happen if we do not do so. It is not a science book or history encyclopedia.    Cheers,    Michael Kelly|`|lkcdBscuaa	its irrelevant to the message the bible is giving. Besides, the bible has useful information. Can someone explain what did we benefit from the exploration of the moon? ya ya. we might be able to colonize in so many years. but seriously?   It was a waste of time, energy and money. |`|9FkdXmQRaa	Because looking at the big picture, the exploration of space isn't important enough, nor is the discovery of America, which by the way wasn't discovered, because its existence was already known about by its original inhabitants.

Don't hold your breath.|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	No, the bible says only God knows the day.|`|ef2911f8d21cd85ee3398706a59e0e47aa	No.  It gives very vague and generalized events that can be interpreted to mean several things or nothing at all.  You'd have better luck going to a fortune teller.    Further, like all ego-centric faiths (faiths where the god-figure is focused primarily on itself) the Christian Bible only focuses on the end of the Christian world, not the end of the world in general.  Of course, to Christians, this really will be the end.    Thank the gods.|`|H8WqMK1eaa	There are "signs" described in the Bible...throughout the New Testament mostly.    But everything in the Bible is up for interpretation.    A Christian radio host named Harold Camping wrote and published a book about 15 years ago called "1994."  According to his interpretation of the Bible, the world was to end in 1994.  He actually got a following...my own father was one of them.    And then....1995 arrived.|`|AA11785285	Why would an old "holy" book even matter?      And what ever it said, why would it be important?

People try to interpret Revelation and the second coming but can only end up guessing.    Isaac Newton studied over 30 bibles in the 16 century I believe, being the ace mathematician and the father of calculus and physics he  came up with the year 2060.  Odd that someone like Sir Isaac Newton would try to calculate the second coming, I suppose he found it very interesting as well.  :)      No, we do not know.  :)|`|bTA5ndeMaa	Interpreting signs is a lot different than looking at the calendar and the clock to say, it is time, isn't it?    Christ gave us things that would indicate to the Christian that the time of the end had arrived.  This would help that one to persevere in his suffering.  Since the saintly Christian is made to go through God's furnace of affliction, he needs comfort, by scriptures, by other Christians, and by seeing that soon he shall be delivered from his suffering.    As to the end, this economic problem seems likely to be part of prophecy that shall give us soon (months?  years?) more than guess work.  If Babylon the Great is done away with - from then on, we are permitted to know the exact amount of time, by calendar and clock, so to say, what happens next.    At the moment we have to be satisfied with the fact that things show that it could be months / years / decades to that day.  One might hope though that the economic problem now in phase two is going to implode into that within months.    |`|dIxQ9rV5aa	"He established the earth upon its foundations, So that it will not totter forever and ever."|`|oGRsxfBiaa	There is no exact date, and Bible is pretty clear on that.

I tell you, the bible is an interesting book if you take the time to learn about it and read it.|`|lUFBlZ6haa	 revelation20:4And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.    this 1000 year rein of Christ is on this earth and it starts aver the 7 year tribulation. so even though we cant give you a date the world will end but we can say that it has atlkeast 1007 more years.  |`|7Gd8iodUaa	It is both:    "Concerning that day and hour nobody knows, neither the angels of the heavens nor the Son, but only the Father."

1CS2KR7Taa	There seem to be more than on side to your question.  First main point is, who is a jew? Even the officials in Israel haven't managed to define yet, just look at how many different jewish denomination there are.  Second point is, that after reading your post I had the impression that you would like some kind of a reassurance, that you still belong, you would like to be accepted in the "jewish" community despite your "non-believing". I can sympathize with you, as I was in a similar situation not because of not believing, but I am genetically not 100% jewish, and I am jewish from the "wrong side".  Fortunately for me, since I have found a way to reconcile my longing to be part of "jewish" community with my faulty genetics.  I am not sure you will find it helpful, but here is a video on if you had to believe in God to be spiritual, or be part of the "Spiritual jewish" community:  http://www.kabbalah.info/engkab/kabbalah...  I hope you will find this helpful!|`|AA10645437	"i believe in all of Judaism, except for God"    Sorry, that is a contradiction in terms.    I'll explain it in the following manner.    There is a dispute amongst the rabbis whether there is a Biblical commandment (mitzvah) whether one must believe in G-d. One says there is. The other says there is not. His argument is the following: If one agrees to follow the Torah's commandments then one must believe in the Commander of those commandments. Otherwise, it is all a pointless exercise.  So, you say you believe in Judaism. But since that is predicated on the fact that there is a G-d, then how can you possibly separate the two?|`|45c225e1fbbf144b5f2d4c805307255eaa	Yes, if he is as confused as some people are.|`|iNLJRc9haa	Technically you're of Jewish descent, but you're not Jewish if you're atheist. There's a difference between being Jewish (as in the religion, believing in Judaism) or being of Jewish stock.     So, yes! You can be of Jewish descent and be atheist.|`|BMB1qWfUaa	You can't be a "religious" Jew and still Atheist.    Judaism's cornerstone is the belief in God, which atheism doesn't accept.|`|5tAAMEn5aa	Please don't take this personal, but the fact remains Fact.  Judaism (brought to humans by Prophet Moses-Moosa(PBUH) as in Quran) and Christianity (brought to humans by Prophet Jesus-Eesa(PBUH) as in Quran), are both events and faiths of the past. I don't know if one who follows truly any of these beliefs, is eligible for heaven, but I know one thing that every human present on this earth right from the birth of Prophet Mohammad(PBUH) is entitled to believe in One God(Allah as in Quran), all others I am sorry, but I have to say this, are deemed as non-believers, who lead their lives in their own desired manner overlooking the commandments of God...  Our lives are not to be wasted in what we want to in this extremely small life on this earth, but our bodies have been brought to life by the Great God, in order to put us to a big test on this earth, to overcome Satan's (Devil's) evil designs into misleading us and to follow God's and Prophet Mohammad's ways to lead a pious life without any sins.    I am sorry if someone's feeling hurt, but I have absolutely no intention to hurt anyone's sentiments...I am no religious fanatic...but this is what is true and applies to every human inhaling oxygen on this earth!    Believe it or not, Judgment Day is going to come and every one born from Adam and Eve to the last man on this earth will witness that day...when every human will be handed their results in their hands...    We all will be reborn and will be standing on a planet which will have one day equal to 50000 years of this earth!    Every human will have to pass over the Sword named as Pulseraat...  which will have an edge sharper than a hairline...    Innocent and pious ones will be able to cross it like a flash of lightning,  and the non-believers who did not believe in One God, and Prophet Mohammad's(PBUH) words, will be cut by the very edge of the sword and will fall into the hell...    Well, this is nothing...there's an ocean of facts that are happening and gonna happen as time arrives which are all mentioned in the holy Quran, a pure word from Allah...unmodified and untouched by any human...    I might be wrong somewhere or not very accurate, please forgive me and you may clear your doubts by reading Quran...  that's all I can say...    Allah is the greatest of all...  None is worth worshipping other than Allah, Mohammad (PBUH) is Allah's Messenger.|`|0hdo4WORaa	No|`|gpwI2sbvaa	I am the exact same way. I have asked my Rabbi, and he explained that one can partake in the culture and traditions of Judaism, and not have to believe in God to be a Jew.|`|2XIsvCzNaa	no not a valid jew|`|bce49af4b285a96d81e7186b9e756de9aa	whether you believe in the principals is moot. if you don't believe in a god or way of origin you're an atheist.    at least, that's my opinion. i'd argue for it, too|`|c5VABL0oaa	Of course you can. There is a difference between being ethnically jewish and "religious."     Atheism is a religious belief. If you do not believe in any God(s), then you are by default an atheist. If you believe in God/Gods, then you are not. Only you can decide what your religious stance is. |`|7d647be57724929a656a84a04d156140aa	Isn't it hypocrisy to follow or partake of any ritual or ceremony and not believing in it?  I don't believe in Halloween and I do not practice it.  I stay clear away from it.  |`|AA11187638	Yes. You can be Jewish by culture and Atheist by ideology.|`|QZHDSPOwaa	First, you have no religion at birth.  You don't take on your fathers religion like you do his last name, religion is a choice you make.  Of course, in most families, the kids aren't left to make that choice... they're caught before they can think for themselves and indoctrinated.      However, you can be an atheist and still partake in religious customs.  Many atheists celebrate christmas, but not for the birth of christ or anything, but simply to exchange gifts and be with family.  Many of my friends practice Jewish ceremonies and traditions while not actually believing in a deity.|`|aZvWDxqvaa	Sure it is. You would be Jewish by name and actions while denying God in your heart and mind. Many people already do this. The Jewish rituals then are no more meaningful than some club you could join. I wouldn't necessarily worry about other Jews rather than if you got the god thing right.|`|YmKT9aIRaa	Well, many people view Jews as a race of people, but Judaism itself is a religion. So I believe there's no answer to your question due to man's inability to properly distinguish/define a religious person and a common man. |`|4Z2pTS47aa	If you believe that YHWH said "I am the first, and I am the last, and beside Me there is no God" then you could possibly be Jewish, provided everything else. Although, you cannot be an atheist. If you believe in even the possibility of the contradictory supposition that there exists an omnipotent, omnipresent supreme being, then you cannot be an atheist.    I know it seems that every religion is a contradiction in terms, and thus one would think that one could be both religious and yet not believe in god, but that just makes such a person a hypocrite who doesn't understand their religion nor atheism. Not speaking of you of course, just said hypothetical person.|`|GCvNboJ1aa	asourapp...  Christmas is a Pagan tradition. Jesus wasn't even born on that day.

Sua poesia fez vislumbrar um ser apaixonado que caminha cheio de seguran?a na estrada da vida e ao deparar com uma bifurca??o do caminho, sente-se obrigado a tomar uma decis?o criteriosa.     Invade-lhe a mente uma inseguran?a momentanea, porque uma decis?o errada atrasaria sua caminhada rumo  conquista de si mesmo (seus reais objetivos).     Contudo, o otimismo prevalece e o leitor fica convicto de que esse ser tomar o caminho da felicidade.

Ce sont bel et bien L'ENSEMBLE DES FRANCOPHONES DU MONDE qui propulsent cette langue parmi les 4 ou 5 plus importantes qui soient, aussi bien les Haitiens que les Algriens,les Congolais que les Belges, les Ivoiriens que les Fran?ais, ou les Qubcois que les Sngalais.

OdeKL6U6aa	con mis amigas hace unos a?os nos re copamos con el juego de la copa, empezamos a jugar con lo tipico, una copa y letras en la mesa, despues nos empezamos a informar un poco mas y asi comprabamos las velas con los colores correspondientes, las ubicabamos en forma de triangulo, conseguimos una copa bien buena de cristal, mis amigas se sacaban los rosarios...todo esto nos pedia el supuesto espiritu que se llamaba oscar al cual llamabamos oscarcito, le molestaba, pero siempre lo tomabamos como un juego obvio...siempre jugabamos los dias q no eran santos...hasta aca todo bien, nos cagabamos de risa...pero con el tiempo se volvio como una adiccion...siempre jugabamos en la casa de una amiga q vivia sola con su hermana, ella tambien jugaba...mis amigos no nos creian asi q una noche fueron a ver que tanta verdad era el juego, entonces pedimos q se manifieste, obvio nos pidio q sacaramos los gatos, los rosarios y cualquier cosa roja cinta o cosa por el estilo,  para esto los gatos se ponian muy nerviosos, bueno sacamos los gatos, en ese mismo momento nos golpearon la puerta...cuando abrimos no habia nadie, no terminamos de cerrar q golpean de nuevo, y nadie!...despues en la cocina empezaron a golpearce las tazas...mis amigos creian q era un gato, pero los gatos no estaban!!...a mi alguien al oido me callo..fue un susurro muy suave un  shhhh....a mi amiga le tocaron la espalda y obvio del susto dio un salto y un grito...tambien en el patio vimos una sombra, pero no negra, sino blanca una sombra blanca, muy loco!...ese dia no asustamos bastante como es de imaginarse...pero a los dias siguientes dejamos de jugar, ya q estabamos asustadas...pero en la casa habia un cuarto vacio, y cada vez q pasabas  te golpeaban la puerta, tambien a la hermana de mi amiga un dia se le empezo a caer el ventilador de techo de a poco, no de golpe como q se cae..sino q empezo a bajar de apoco y al mismo tiempo la puesta de su pieza se abria sola, la cerrabamos y se abria...por la noche no la dejaban dormir, sentia q la miraban, q la tocaban y pero nunca vio nada....a todas las demas nos paso q por las noches no dormiamos tranquilas, no conseguiamos entrar en un sue?o profundo. los gatos no querian entrar a la casa...y lo peor es q todo esto no pasaba solo de noche sino q a cualquier hora del dia...entonces jugamos una vez mas para saber quien era el q estaba en la casa, bueno era oscarcito y nos decia q molestaba a la hermana de mi amiga por q ella  tenia miedo y no era fuerte, q se divertia asustandola..le pedimos por favor q no moleste, q se valla, pero tampoco nos dejaba terminar el juego, asi q hicimos un trato le pedimos q se quede en el cuarto vacio pero q no molestara mas, q si no molestaba no metiamos a los gatos nunca mas en esa pieza(antes los gatos dormian ahi)...asi fue q las cosas se tranquilizaron, aunque seguio dando golpes en la puerta, pero solo eso...despues de un tiempo mi amiga hizo limpiar la casa..asi q ahora esta todo tranqui.  en verdad pasaron muchas cosas mas pero nada "traumatico"....asi q cuando alguien dice q es mentira el juego de la copa...casi siempre cuento mi experiencia, por suerte las cosas no pasaron a mayores...pero alto julepe nos pegamos....obvio nunca mas jugamos!!! gracias paso!!    buano saludos che!|`|ef11aea9ad41cbfd669f058bacdc64ebaa	??S!!, un tipo me apunt, me dijo -?darme el bolso!-, segu caminando tan rpido como poda, y me grit tres veces por la espalda: ?Te tiro!, ?Te tiro!, ?Te tiro!,.

zjuTTXqwaa	Ns mulheres detestamos aqueles que pegam muito no p, mas ao mesmo tempo precisamos nos sentir amadas, desejadas e se o seu homem n?o liga p nada que vc faz, onde vai, com quem a que hora volta, vc se sente largada.    Acho que tanto p o homem quanto p a mulher o ideal  ser meio-termo, se  que d para ser. Se preocupar, querer saber de alugns detalhes, pois vc faz com que a pessoa se sinta importante p vc e amada; e ser tb aquele que d espa?o, permiti ao outro ter tb uma vida individual ,n outro mundo, mas cada um  cada um e precisa de um espa?o p ser ele prprio.    Um namorado ideal, n  aquele que t contigo todos os dias, liga toda hora ou aquele que n te liga nunca e s quer te ver uma vez na semana quando pode ver duas.   O legal  vc ser mais que especial na vida da pessoa, ligar de vez enquanto e dizer eu te amo, mandar flores por simplesmente 4o feira ou qualquer outro dia da semana,  isso que faz um relacionamento, sendo cada um ele mesmo(temos dois) e os dois se entregando uma ao outro para serem um s corpo.|`|32dc724226fc6214b167bddd154eeda0aa	SUA pergunta, serve para todas as perguntas do mundo, e todas as perguntas podem ser respondidas de uma so maneira, TODO o excesso  prejudicial, muito religiosa , muito guloso, muito santo, muito capeta,.

Some of us still attend the Vespers service on Saturdays as well.    What is the precedent for maintaining Saturday (in particular)?

How do we know that the Saturday of our modern calendar is precisely the same day as the "sabbath" observed by the ancient Hebrews following the Exodus? Scholars don't even know if Moses existed, and yet we are able to confidently assume that the modern American Saturday has been faithfully transmitted down through the centuries in order to conform with the seventh day of the ancient Hebrew week?|`|NxlWcNdvaa	Good question!    You are correct in that The Most High Lord God of ALL Creation said to keep the Sabbath and keep it Holy.  Are you also aware that you are REQUIRED to KNOW that He exists - not 'believe' or have 'faith' it is so?    The change to Sunday happened for every reason under the sun at that time except for the TRUTH - keep the Sabbath! By not keeping the Sabbath, there are consequences - just like there are for EVERY other broken Holy Law!    Here's another that your teacher/pastor/preacher/minister, etc didn't teach you - you are REQUIRED to write your OWN copy of Holy Law!    READ The Anointed, The Elect, and The Damned! and you'll discover many other places where the Hallelujah Half-Wits aren't in compliance with Holy Law|`|aK5DsSjdaa	Sunday has nothing to do with the Sabbath (Saturday), Sunday is the day of the week when the apostles and the church would meet together and break bread. it is called "the Lord's day"...God is not too particular about which day one meets to worship Him, but Sunday is the day that Jesus Christ was resurrected.    Colossians 2:16  Therefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink, or with regard to a religious festival, a New Moon celebration or a Sabbath day.    in the old testament the sabbath was to be kept Holy...a day of rest.  but in the New testament, through the Holy Spirit every minute of everyday is to be Holy...and rest is rest in the soul and heart, the eternal rest of God.    Hebrews 12:14  Make every effort to live in peace with all men and to be holy; without holiness no one will see the Lord.     1 Peter 1:15  But just as he who called you is holy, so be holy in all you do;    God allowed one day of rest for the people of the earthly israel, but now those who live in His Spirit live in that rest always. so what was a seventh day sabbath to rest and holy to God, is now eternal rest sharing in the Holiness of God.    Hebrews 4:1  Therefore, since the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us be careful that none of you be found to have fallen short of it.     Hebrews 4:3  Now we who have believed enter that rest, just as God has said, "So I declared on oath in my anger, 'They shall never enter my rest.' "     Hebrews 4:5-6  And again in the passage above he says, "They shall never enter my rest." It still remains that some will enter that rest, and those who formerly had the gospel preached to them did not go in, because of their disobedience.     Hebrews 4:10  for anyone who enters God's rest also rests from his own work, just as God did from his.     Hebrews 4:11  Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will fall by following their example of disobedience.    so rest is no longer a sabbath day, but true obedience to God in the Holy Spirit. the "eternal sabbath" is the salvation given to us through Jesus Christ.    Those who make a big deal of certain days and which are acceptable are not speaking throught the Spirit of God. For He and we are not bound by those things, we are those who live by faith...we are those who live by the Holy Spirit.    PEACE   |`|rvoo4rBjaa	God created the Heavens and earth for 6 days and on the 7th he rested and reflected on his works and called it the sabbath and said to keep it holy.|`|ZtEVlc0yaa	Mark 2:27    And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath.

QOEC1W01aa	In the Bible, temptation is countered through two things.    1) Prayer  Daniel prayed 3 times a day, asking God not to let him fall into the trap of bowing to the king.  "Now when Daniel learned that the decree had been published, he went home to his upstairs room where the windows opened toward Jerusalem. Three times a day he got down on his knees and prayed, giving thanks to his God, just as he had done before. Then these men went as a group and found Daniel praying and asking God for help. " Daniel 6:10-11  http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?sea...    2) The Bible  When Jesus was tempted in the desert for 40 days, He threw scripture back at Satan and told him to get away.  "Jesus said to him, "Away from me, Satan! For it is written: 'Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.' Then the devil left him, and angels came and attended him." Matt 4:10-11    Read the full story here: http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?boo...         Also note in the story of Joseph, when he was tempted by Potipher's wife he ran. If you get yourself in a bad situation, put down whatever you're doing and leave.  "One day he went into the house to attend to his duties, and none of the household servants was inside. She caught him by his cloak and said, "Come to bed with me!" But he left his cloak in her hand and ran out of the house." Genesis 39:10-11  http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?boo...    The main thing is to keep a close relationship with God everyday and to make a daily commitment to do what is right. You maintain this relationship through prayer (you talking to God) and reading your Bible (God talking to you).|`|jPoQm3C1aa	masturbation.  works every time.|`|4ea33fec9bff6a9fd9c0e86d64167d2daa	run from it,  get away from what ever makes you lust. it's to hard to stand up and fight it.|`|WpsdmtRhaa	  have a cold shower|`|9d24eebc65f160389e6cd993dc745cd8aa	I've found that sex is a pretty good cure.|`|921232792e8ae7c34c7818c953169f6caa	How?

09bd9071f261e20518478352da1dad4daa	I understand your confusion!  I am agnostic for the reason that I've reached the conclusion that it is impossible to know whether or not a deity exists.  However, I am also fascinated by the unknown and by the Western Tradition of Magick (Tarot, Qabala, Astrology, and Alchemy), all of which are based upon the concept of a deity or higher power.  I could not say, though, that I "believe" in any of those disciplines; still, I've written two novels in which the occult "sciences" figure prominently and a major character is a creative entity, also a Magus.  I was raised in a liberal Protestant denomination and attended church/Sunday School until I graduated from high school; during my childhood and adolescence, however, even while sitting in church, I began to question Christian doctrine and the existence of God.  In my opinion, such skepticism is valuable.  I see no reason why you can not develop your own philosophy in regard to God and religion; no one really can tell what to believe or disbelieve; you are better equipped to draw your own conclusions and discover a philosophy which will enable you to feel satisfied.  I am quite happy in my agnosticism!|`|bce49af4b285a96d81e7186b9e756de9aa	you are like many that consider God as a controllable power source    that's a very dangerous position to be in. you might want to reevaluate yourself.    i'm sorry you've faced such but i'm serious.

Why don't you stop looking at people and really look deep into yourself and then ask God if He is real to reveal Himself to you.|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	You have a God given right to believe anything you like.

I pray you find the Truth, dear one.  |`|ATPPWOpWaa	First of all your quest should be the truth and not to be simply fulfilled by some earthly religion.  Your mother is reaping what she has sewn in her failure to keep her family in a Christian church.  I cant prove God to you but can show you some end times prophesies    There are many prophesies in the Bible concerning the end times.   Concerning end time prophecy one needs to consider that these prophesies will occur within a relatively short common era of time thus compounding their validity.  Additionally, things are prophesied that ancient peoples wouldn't even have thought of or would have any way of knowing.  Below is short list of the end times prophesies;    * That mankind would greatly increase in knowledge in the last days.    * That mankind would travel to and fro far more in the last days.    * That the Jews would re-establish their homeland in the last days(Israel reformed in 1948).    * That man kinds 'chariots' would rush to and fro along the broad ways and be self illuminated and travel like lightning.    * That there would be increased natural disasters in diverse places.    * That there would be famines.    * That the Jews would again speak a common language (the Jews now speak the long dead Hebrew language).    * That Christianity would be spread to the ends of the earth.    * That there will be great distress at the end, unequaled from the beginning of the world until nowand never to be equaled again.    * The existence of a 200 million man army(China attained this capability in the 1960s).    * The Jews rebuilding of the Temple of God.  The specific piece of ground needed is called "The Dome of the Rock" and is currently held by the Muslims.    * A red Heifer (cow) must be used in the purification in the end times.  The first red Heifer born in 2,000 years was born on 1997 and another in 2004 in Israel.    * The return of the Ethiopian Jews to Israel was prophesied in Zephaniah 3:10.   Between 1984 and 1999 some 38,000 and the last of the Ethiopian Jews were airlifted to Israel.    *  That all nations of the world would have instant and live communication as they will see certain events in real time the world over.    * That the nature of people will change for the worse.  They will be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents,      unthankful,  unholy,  without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God.       Again, the important thing to note is that these things will all happen in a common era.   It is very easy to recognize the above events and their relatively recent connection to one another.  There are things prophesied that simply weren't knowable at the time that they were written.  .    |`|0fEBJinjaa	I don't know. What sounds right for one person may seem like nonsense to another, so it's hard to help people with their beliefs. I think that it's okay to believe in whatever you want - not that I believe all religions are true, I just think it's irrelevant what someone believes, as long as they're happy.

3a721af65bf5cf15676187ff7eb79ec9aa	I am amazed. You come up with questions that seriously get me thinking. You really do get under the surface...    But here the answer to your question:  It is walking in holiness. It is not wanting to walk like the world, talk like the world and not wanting to be like everyone else in our country, in our city and even in our church. We need to quit comparing ourselves by ourselves. We need to try to be like Jesus Christ.  If there is no separation recognizable in our lives we are lost and we cannot please God.  We need to live and grow in our walk with the Lord.    Ephesians 4:17-32   17 So this I say, and affirm together with the Lord, that you walk no longer just as the Gentiles also walk, in the futility of their mind,   18 being darkened in their understanding, excluded from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their heart;   19 and they, having become callous, have given themselves over to sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness.   20 But you did not learn Christ in this way,   21 if indeed you have heard Him and have been taught in Him, just as truth is in Jesus,   22 that, in reference to your former manner of life, you lay aside the old self, which is being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of deceit,   23 and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind,   24  and put on the new self, which in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of the truth.   25Therefore, laying aside falsehood, SPEAK TRUTH EACH ONE of you WITH HIS NEIGHBOR, for we are members of one another.   26 BE ANGRY, AND yet DO NOT SIN; do not let the sun go down on your anger,   27 and do not give the devil an opportunity.   28 He who steals must steal no longer; but rather he must labor, performing with his own hands what is good, so that he will have something to share with one who has need.   29 Let no unwholesome word proceed from your mouth, but only such a word as is good for edification according to the need of the moment, so that it will give grace to those who hear.   30 Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.   31 Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice.   32 Be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven you.|`|5bkmSQ3Raa	If I'm pleasing to God...and I hope that I am...it's because I do the best I can to be a good and loving human being, and I do the best to be thankful and grateful to God for what he has created.|`|WTPziKSyaa	It's not about what you do on Earth.

The person below me seems to have a grasp on it.|`|AA11476749	It is both a present and future event.  The story you mention here is about Hades, the abode of the dead.  At the time, there were two compartments.  One was Abraham's Bosom (aka Paradise), and the other was Tartarus (aka Hell).  One was a place of comfort, the other of torment.    Jesus, when He was dying, promised one of the criminals that he would be in Paradise with Him.  It was while in Paradise that Jesus preached to the faithful dead about who He was and what He did.  He then took these saints with Him to Heaven (Cf. Ephesians 4:8)    The part of Hades that is a place of torment is still doing its job.  As it is written:  "if this is so, then the Lord knows how to rescue godly men from trials and to hold the unrighteous for the day of judgment, while continuing their punishment."  (II Peter 2:9)    Finally, at the Last Judgment, the unregenerate dead will be judged and found wanting.  At that time, they will be cast into a Lake of Fire.  (Cf. Revelation 20:14-15)    EDIT:  It Is Finished, was it necessary for you to call me out by saying I haven't actually read the verses before?  FYI, I have read the passages numerous times.  Can't we just agree to disagree without being disagreeable?  We're gonna have to put up with each other for eternity.|`|CzaVtjndaa	Jesus is describing two aspects of punishment awaiting those who reject God's gift of salvation. The passage you quote does indeed mention the "rich man" who died and lifted up his eyes in Hell--but in the Greek, the word for Hell is hades. There is another word for Hell, gehenna, which refers to the everlasting punishment to come.     You can get a lot of comparison and contrast by going to a web site such as Blue Letter Bible (at http://www.blueletterbible.org and I recommend this site enthusiastically). When you get there, type the word hell in the search box, and you'll get every verse in the King James Version where the word occurs. At any verse, click on the C button and you'll get the Hebrew or Greek word used in each verse.    Hades was the general word for the place where all the dead went after their lives on earth were over. The righteous went to Abraham's bosom, which you probably noticed. This was also called Paradise by Jesus Himself.    The wicked dead--the vast majority of all people who ever lived--went to a place of torment. Jesus stated that the place of Hell was created for the devil and his angels, or those who rebelled against God and face the punishment of Gehenna, or everlasting separation from God.    NOBODY needs to go there, though, because God provided salvation!|`|GBKaftrJaa	Here is some biblical commentary on that passage.  Hope that helps.
d9fb2acd20fb4c3590182dc9f4470d89aa	Jesus Christ rose from the dead.  Therefore yes, I do believe that consciousness survives physical death.  This is what Jesus taught:     "There was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and lived in luxury every day. At his gate was laid a beggar named Lazarus, covered with sores and longing to eat what fell from the rich man's table. Even the dogs came and licked his sores.    "The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abraham's side. The rich man also died and was buried. In hell,[hades] where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus by his side. So he called to him, 'Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire.'      "But Abraham replied, 'Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, while Lazarus received bad things, but now he is comforted here and you are in agony. And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, so that those who want to go from here to you cannot, nor can anyone cross over from there to us.'      "He answered, 'Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my father's house, for I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.'      "Abraham replied, 'They have Moses and the Prophets; let them listen to them.'      " 'No, father Abraham,' he said, 'but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.'      "He said to him, 'If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.' "    Luke 16:19-31    This is not a parable, but even if it was, Jesus NEVER taught a parable based on unrealities, but only on realities.    read what this man experienced......    http://www.near-death.com/storm.html|`|1CS2KR7Taa	Here is a very nice short video on reincarnation:  http://www.kabbalah.info/engkab/kabbalah...

Re-incarnation requires buy-in to a complex religious system that includes it - no interest there.  But the idea of a continuation of our consciousness..?  I have had some evidence of the Universal Subconscious but in that context, only the echoes of your current life are preserved: it may be timeless, but there is no indication of life-after-death there, and if there was one, I think it would have appeared there.  So without other evidence, as an optimist, I choose Crunchy Chocolate Heaven - open to all: just bring chocolate or olives, not drama.

No one knows what is like for sure, but its 1000 times better than the best day on earth. The Bible has descriptions of heaven, but most images we have come from culture, popular entertainment, the clouds, white robes and angels with wings. This is a human interpertation. Trying to explain it is beyound our comprehension, but it mighty good from what the bible does discribe.     I will admit I am disappointed about a few things.

ybpUb6HCaa	Because Christianity was actually a political movement whose goal was to control first the areas where it sprang up, and then spread as far as it could, taking money, land, power, along the way and destroying, intimidating, torturing, and murdering those who refused to obey it. It was, and IS a political movement first and foremost, nothing more than a land grab for money and power. Now its power is waning as we see Islam coming up to do the same thing, and it is spreading across the world for the very same reasons, all based on power, money and politics. They have brainwashed many many of their followers into believing that it's about God (or Allah), just as Christianity did. So this is what all religions are about, ultimately, this is why they were begun and this is why they continue today.    Keep that in mind and it will make the answer to your question a lot easier to understand. It never was about God or saving souls. It has always been about power, money, resources, and land.|`|ZasNwdXaaa	I don't think its cast away.

There is a false Christian Church, however that rejects the Torah, perhaps they are the ones you are confused about.    BTW, 18 is too young to decide just what you are or are not.    Edit: You missed verse 19, of course which explains why the bat is on the list of unclean food.  Perhaps you should really read the Bible.     Slavery is not prohibited in the Bible, if you really read it.  Paul even encourages a slave who is a believer to return to his master.  The problem with slavery is folks who practice it do not practice it according to Torah.       Your question is why do Christians cast away the OT, it was not: " I hate the Bible who else hates it too"?|`|ehrWPRjwaa	Christians *don't* believe this ...     Christians do believe that we are not required to follow, say, the dietary laws of the Old Testament.  |`|AA10557268	Joe, Christians don't. In fact early in Church history there was a person named Marcion, I think, who thought that the OT should be cast out because he saw two versions of God. His idea was condemned by the Chruch. I myself say that it is impossible to understand the NT without knowing the OT. Kungfu
Fw8IngTOaa	Satan is a hebrew word that mean Adversary, Accuser, opposer and the one to question.  And Satanists are the adversary's and opposers to all religions and philosophy's that hamper our lives and human instincts,  and herd mentality, plus we question all things.  so the term is perfect for us.    Also it is a great filter to keep out the crazy people so that it does not attract any of the garbage that the christians have.    You should really read the Satanic Bible by Anton LaVey, it is all in there.  A religion based on reality I love it!|`|iMwxlU9Zaa	If someone called themself a satanist a few hundred years ago, they would have been murdered by christians.

Acts 2:36-38    36Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made the same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.     37Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?     38Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost |`|ly7F8jrtaa	I have no idea where I heard it from, but I heard that it came from the pre-Christian idea of Satan.    :D|`|q5rTjkjgaa	i understand the religion and its a good one but i dont know why they would call it satanism i think the name itself gets people to not follow |`|SqhGr6e3aa	Because Satan represents the basic idea of Satanism. Indulgance, not abstinence. The name Lucifer means 'light', or light-bringer, and so Satan is the representation of knowledge-seeking. Also, Satan is the opposition to God.

Matthew 25:41  "...Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels."  The devil/satan is not an idea but a real spirit person.|`|AA12203324	It's likely an attention-getting device.  The self, an antithetical value to Christian selflessness, doesn't suggest any obvious iconization, so another anti-Christian symbol is borrowed.  The English poet William Blake was a proponent of the gnostic idea that the tyrannical, judgmental "God" of the Bible was actually a demon, therefore the devil (or at least the idea) might be the true God.  This led him to write "The Proverbs of Hell," which aren't all that "satanic".  Latter day satanists just followed a long line of historical criticism of Christian orthodoxy.|`|v0BCIQpnaa	Don't kid yourself.  Satanism looks happy on the outside.  I'd check out information from those who have come out of Satanism.    Anton LaVey the so called "High Priest" of Satan is little more than a spooky front man who makes the whole Satan thing look cool because of his black robes, hood over his head, and Pentagram that hangs around his neck.

Labels cause people to hastily judge you based on ignorance rather than knowledge.    So they intentionally picked an outrageous label.|`|sWM66oH4aa	I see your point. I believe they believe Satan is the symbol for this:     1. Satan represents indulgence instead of abstinence!     2. Satan represents vital existence instead of spiritual pipe dreams!     3. Satan represents undefiled wisdom instead of hypocritical self-deceit!     4. Satan represents kindness to those who deserve it, instead of love wasted on ingrates!     5. Satan represents vengeance instead of turning the other cheek!     6. Satan represents responsibility to the responsible instead of concern for psychic vampires!     7. Satan represents man as just another animal, sometimes better, more often worse than those that walk on all-fours, who, because of his divine spiritual and intellectual development, has become the most vicious animal of all!     8. Satan represents all of the so-called sins, as they all lead to physical, mental, or emotional gratification!     9. Satan has been the best friend the Church has ever had, as He has kept it in business all these years!

Thus one of Englands leading astronomers, Sir Bernard Lovell, wrote of his rapturous amazement at the harmony of natural law, which reveals an intelligence of such superiority that, compared with it, all the systematic thinking and acting of human beings is an utterly insignificant reflection.    Consider, for example, all the factors that work together to make life possible on our planet, the Earth. The sun is 93 million miles away from the earth. If the earth were just a few million miles closer to the sun, no life would be possible because of the intense heat. On the other hand, were the earth just a few million miles farther away from the sun than it now is, no life would be possible on the earth because of the cold.    Contemplate also the air that we breathe. We cannot get along without oxygen, and 21 percent of the atmosphere is oxygen. But were there half as much oxygen or twice as much oxygen as there is now, life as we know it could not thrive upon the earth. Then there is the harmony or balance between plant and animal life. Plants absorb carbon dioxide but give off oxygen, whereas all breathing creatures take in oxygen and give off carbon dioxide. How did all such harmony and balance come about? Is it not evidence that God exists?    Equally forceful evidence that God really exists is seen in the literally millions of millions of cells that compose a human body. How tiny they are! Yet each of these millions of cells can be likened to a walled city where chemicals, proteins and hormones are produced. All this activity is directed by a nucleus, and the products produced are transmitted into and out of the cells by means of a network of channels. Some of the particles in these cells are so tiny that they cannot be seen even when magnified 200,000 times! No wonder that Americas leading medical journal stated that at least 80 percent of scientists in the field of biology will readily admit that biology and life are regulated by some higher power.    Further evidence that God truly exists is seen in the instincts of animals. Why can birds fly unerringly many thousands of miles to their chosen destination, and that regardless of the weather? What wisdom insects, such as bees and ants, display! Note also the wonder of the eels. Both European and American eels come to the Sargasso sea to spawn and there they die. When their eggs hatch, the baby eels go back to the place their mothers came from. It is said that never has a European eel been found in American waters, nor an American eel in European waters. What accounts for this?    The evidence is undeniable: There is a great First Cause. God really does exist. He has indeed performed countless miracles. Some men, in the name of science, would reject miracles. However, as the English poet Cowper once observed: All we behold is miracle, but seen so [regularly], all is miracle in vainbut not to those who acknowledge that God really does exist!        In passing, let it be noted that the theory on the origin of the solar system that Laplace advanced in his Celestial Mechanics has been replaced by other theories equally inconclusive.

I3rjYVUFaa	KJV Rev. 19:6 is the only occurance of the word "omnipotent",  but certainly, anyone would have to agree that a God who knows the number of hairs you have on your head DEMONSTRATES omnipotence:    Mat 10:30  But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.     Luk 12:7  But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows.    There are MANY New Testament scriptures that INSINUATE and demonstrate Jesus' omnipotence, without using the WORD:    Mat 9:6 -   But that ye may know, etc. - External miracles are the proofs of internal ones. Three miracles are wrought in this case. (I mean, by miracle, something produced or known that no power is capable of but that which is omnipotent, and no knowledge adequate to but that which is omniscient).     Luk 5:21 -   Who can forgive sins, but God alone? - If Jesus were not God, he could not forgive sins; and his arrogating this authority would have been blasphemy against God, in the most proper sense of the word. That these scribes and Pharisees might have the fullest proof of his Godhead, he works in their presence three miracles, which from their nature could only be effected by an omniscient and omnipotent Being. The miracles are:  1. The remission of the poor mans sins.  2. The discernment of the secret thoughts of the scribes.  3. The restoration of the paralytic in an instant to perfect soundness.    Joh 1:3 -   All things were made by him - That is, by this Logos. In Gen_1:1, God is said to have created all things: in this verse, Christ is said to have created all things: the same unerring Spirit spoke in Moses and in the evangelists: therefore Christ and the Father are One. To say that Christ made all things by a delegated power from God is absurd; because the thing is impossible. Creation means causing that to exist that had no previous being: this is evidently a work which can be effected only by omnipotence. Now, God cannot delegate his omnipotence to another: were this possible, he to whom this omnipotence was delegated would, in consequence, become God; and he from whom it was delegated would cease to be such: for it is impossible that there should be two omnipotent beings.    1Co 15:54 -   Death is swallowed up in victory -  ? ? ? ?. These words are a quotation from Isa_25:8, where the Hebrew is ??? ???? ????  billa hammaveth lanetsach: He (God) hath swallowed up death in victory; or, for ever. These words in the Septuagint are thus translated:  ? ? ?? Death having prevailed, or conquered, hath swallowed up. But in the version of Theodotion, the words are the same with those of the apostle. The Hebrew ????  lanetsach the Septuagint sometimes translate ? ?, in victory, but most commonly ? ?, for ever; both, as Bishop Pearce observes, in such kind of phrases, signifying the same thing, because eternity conquers all things; and accordingly, in 2Sa_2:26, where the Septuagint have  ? ?  ? ?, our English version has, Shall the sword devour For Ever? And the same may be seen in Job_36:7; Lam_5:20; Amo_1:11; Amo_8:7; from which authority the bishop translates the clause here, Death is swallowed up For Ever.  Death is here personified and represented as a devouring being, swallowing up all the generations of men; and by the resurrection of the body and the destruction of the empire of death, God is represented as swallowing him up; or that eternity gulps him down; so that he is endlessly lost and absorbed in its illimitable waste. How glorious a time to the righteous, when the inhabitant shall no more say, I am sick; when God shall have wiped away all tears from off all faces, and when there shall be no more death. This time must come. Hallelujah! The Lord God Omnipotent reigneth.    Eph 3:20 -   Now unto him - Having finished his short, but most wonderfully comprehensive and energetic prayer, the apostle brings in his doxology, giving praise to Him from whom all blessings come, and to whom all thanks are due.  That is able to do exceeding abundantly - It is impossible to express the full meaning of these words, God is omnipotent, therefore he is able to do all things, and able to do ?  , superabundantly above the greatest abundance. And who can doubt this, who has any rational or Scriptural views of his power or his love?  All that we ask or think - We can ask every good of which we have heard, every good which God has promised in his word; and we can think of, or imagine, goods and blessings beyond all that we have either read of or seen: yea, we can imagine good things to which it is impossible for us to give a name; we can go beyond the limits of all human descriptions; we can imagine more than even God has specified in his word; and can feel no bounds to our imagination of good, but impossibility and eternity: and after all, God is able to do more for us than we can ask or think; and his ability here is so necessarily connected with his willingness, that the one indisputably implies the other; for, of what consequence would it be to tell the Church of God that he had power to do so and so, if there were not implied an assurance that he will do what his power can, and what the soul of man needs to have done?

(Mar 13:7)  And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not troubled: for such things must needs be; but the end shall not be yet.    (Mar 13:8)  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be famines and troubles: these are the beginnings of sorrows.    (Mar 13:9)  But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them.    (Mar 13:10)  And the gospel must first be published among all nations.    (Mar 13:11)  But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost.    (Mar 13:12)  Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father the son; and children shall rise up against their parents, and shall cause them to be put to death.    (Mar 13:13)  And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.    (Mar 13:14)  But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand,) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains:    (Mar 13:15)  And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house, neither enter therein, to take any thing out of his house:    (Mar 13:16)  And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment.    (Mar 13:17)  But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!    (Mar 13:18)  And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter.    (Mar 13:19)  For in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created unto this time, neither shall be.    (Mar 13:20)  And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should be saved: but for the elect's sake, whom he hath chosen, he hath shortened the days.    (Mar 13:21)  And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ; or, lo, he is there; believe him not:    (Mar 13:22)  For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect.    (Mar 13:23)  But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things.    (Mar 13:24)  But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,    (Mar 13:25)  And the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken.    (Mar 13:26)  And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.    (Mar 13:27)  And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.    I figured that Jesus' answer would be better than mine, so that's why I gave you this long quote. Also, notice verse 10 where Jesus says that the gospel will first be published in every nation.

Worry about how many we can get the gospel to today.|`|N4Dg7a9Aaa	honestly, the bible says that we don't know and that anyone who says they do is a liar. not to be rude, but this is sort of a pointless question. i DO know that it will be soon, because if you remember Sodom and Gomorrah, God destroyed it because of the sin, specifically, the sexually immorality. we have a lot of that as well as other things. i think that we shouldn't be worrying as to WHEN he will be coming, but as to if we would be ready if came NOW. we should be preaching the Gospel to everyone we know. God bless ? |`|SZs9pgtKaa	it should be soon but more likely than not it wont even happen|`|YbXPnua0aa	well here's the  thing.. people say its near because that most of the prophecies have been fulfilled. Leader's in my church have said boldy like they know for sure that if the rapture is not coming in their life time its coming in the next generations. We have absolutely no right to make that claim. I mean... the disciples thought it was coming in there day and they were a little off wouldn't u think. Also.. there is a mosk built on top of where the old jewish temple was so that makes it hard for the temple to be rebuilt. I do believe there is a chance the end times are coming but we cannot be sure. I will however, believe the end times are coming sooner if Obama becomes president and seperates our ties from Isreal. But, not knowing when the rapture is coming is the best reason in the world to reach the nations. Because for all we know, it could come tomorrow. |`|b0NccAFFaa	Hi. Yes, I believe it to be in the very next few years. It depends on how accurate we've been counting the years from the birth of Christ. You may be surprised to know that we're not sure that we are exactly 2008 years from Christ's birth this year. It may have been more like 2014 years ago that Jesus was born. GFrom what I've read so far, we just can't be sure. So many assume that we counted right and that it is now 2008. If that's true, then 2033 is a very likely candidate for His return. Keep in mind that between now and His return, we still need a few things to happen namely the total destruction of Damascus, the attempted invasion of Israel by Iran and a multiple number of other countries, the 7 year tribulation, etc. 2033 is also a good candidate for another reason. According to Hosea 6:2, the time of the gentiles is supposed to last 2 days. If 1 day is as a thousand years, that means we're quickly approaching that point, if we count from Jesus' ascension nto heaven. Also, the 7 day creation account, if it also prophesies the end day of rest as the 1000 year reign of Christ, will start in 2033. The 7 Feasts of Yahweh also indicate 2033. Another reason; Islam predicts their Mahdi to arrive shortly too, which some like me believe may be the anti-christ, who is ruling when Jesus returns. So you're right. Expect Him any time. And make sure you are spiritually ready.|`|8A8cDLcuaa	Christ will return once the gospel has ben preached to the uttermost parts of the earth.  We cannot pinpoint a time only the season.

They will insist those passages, respectively addressing the Eucharist and baptism, are written metaphorically. But the book of Revelation  filled with images of a dragon, a multi-horned beast, locusts, bowls, trumpets, and Jesus with a sword coming out of his mouth  is meant to be interpreted literally        A good example of this tendency is the rapturite belief that animal sacrifices will be renewed in the rebuilt temple in Israel during Christs earthly millennial reign. Although the Left Behind series hasnt arrived there yet, no doubt the books will depict such activity. In his commentary Revelation Unveiled, LaHaye explains:     [The biblical book of] Ezekiel goes into great detail regarding the matter of worshipping in the Temple, even pointing out that the sacrificial systems will be reestablished. These sacrifices during the millennial Kingdom will be to the nation of Israel what the Lords Supper is to the Church today: a reminder of what they have been saved from. No meritorious or efficacious work will be accomplished through these sacrifices. Instead, they will remind Israel repeatedly of their crucified Messiah. . . . 7       The True Story of the Rapture  Speaking of misleading, did you know that the rapture as taught by LaHaye and others has been around for less than two centuries? The Left Behind series and LaHayes other books imply or directly claim that their version of the rapture comes from the Bible, was taught by some Christians in the early Church, and is a sign of true Christianity. But this claim is both wishful thinking and categorically false.     dispensationalists and other rapturites are actually a small, recent minority of Christians worldwide  Even the founders of the major Protestant traditions, such as Martin Luther, John Calvin, and John Wesley, didnt believe in a secret rapture.|`|xctgLOcKaa	When I see this question, I tend to go to Jesus' statement that only the Father knows.

Surely, Christs ransom sacrifice is the most potent answer to the satanic lie that we are worthless or unlovable.     Never should we forget that the agonizing death that Jesus suffered on the torture stake and the even greater agony that Jehovah endured in watching his beloved Son die are proof of their love for us.     Sadly, many people find it hard to believe that this gift could be meant for them personally. They feel unworthy. Remember, though, that the apostle Paul had been a persecutor of Christs followers. Yet, he wrote: The Son of God . . . loved me and handed himself over for me.Galatians 1:13; 2:20.    Perhaps it is through the privilege of prayer that we experience Jehovahs love in the most intimate way. The Bible invites each of us to pray incessantly to God. (1 Thessalonians 5:17)    He listens. He is even called the Hearer of prayer. (Psalm 65:2) He has not delegated this office to anyone else, not even to his own Son.|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	God's love|`|ckA71chpaa	My love for my children.

P544Sbmqaa	You are not taking any kind of mark with this, as you were born with finger prints that are completly unique to yourself.  Only you have your finger print.  You should just get your finger scanned.  Somewhere in life you will have your finger prints taken anyways.  I have had to have them taken for a couple jobs that ran background checks on me, and it is a part of my bank records.  There is nothing wrong with using your finger print.  It is actually a measure of security and has nothing to do with the mark of the beast.|`|ehBPus3Zaa	I believe that we are headed toward the time that will usher in the AntiChrist. This situation is a precursor to it being accepted that we have to scan things for a number etc. Just like going to a bank to cash a check. If you don't have an account there, they take your fingerprint. I have seen this kind of thing happening in scanning dogs and cats, putting OnStar in a car where they will know when you are hurt or be able to find you then. The Bible says that we are going to be aware that we make the decision to take or reject the mark of the beast. If you feel that strongly about getting your finger scanned, then look into options to be able to get around it. (If I felt this strongly, I would tell the office it was against what I believe in and would find another way to get lunch).|`|eAMq1iBWaa	Joseph, the mark of the beat WAS the mark of emperor worship in the first few centuries AD of the Roman Empire    You are safe!

Everything you have been asking can be found in His word.    The mark of the beast will be something put in either the forehead or the hand of those who are left behind on earth after the rapture of the church.  Born again Christians will not be here for this event.    At your school, there is nothing to worry about.|`|AA12194228	Don't worry, it is a base earthly thing. You will be fine. The Devil cannot claim you if you denounce him!|`|cIZS6Wr2aa	I think you are very dear to the Lord for wanting to obey him and but I think it's just fine to get your fingers scanned.   I believe the beast is man in general and the mark is a spiritual mark, meaning bad fruits.  So don't get alarmed!   Just get scanned and enjoy your lunch!       A born again Christian 32 years.|`|AA12203324	Yep.  Better start packing your own lunch.|`|K6UbI5Ooaa	 The finger scan is not the mark of the beast, it will more than likely be an implanted chip that can be scanned. However if you feel that God is telling you not to have you finger scanned then by all means start making your own lunch and bringing it to school.|`|HQ1t2ayLaa	Its the mark of the beast.|`|CjRfJbncaa	Getting one's finger scanned simply takes the place of entering a PIN  after sliding a debit card, in order to pay for something.  It is much more safe, as no one can easily duplicate your fingerprint, & use your money!  Paying for one's lunch has nothing to do with one's spiritual integrity!    I suggest that you read the following Bible-based articles, which clarify several things that you seem to have confused.  I encourage you to read & compare all of the Scriptures used / referred to in them, in your own Bible, too:    The Mark of the Beast---What Does It Mean? :   - 666--Not Just a Puzzle   http://watchtower.org/e/20040401/article...   - *Identifying the Wild Beast and Its Mark*    http://watchtower.org/e/20040401/article...  *(Be sure not to overlook what is says *after* the footnotes!)    Who Is the Antichrist? :   - Why Identify the Antichrist?   - The Antichrist Exposed      http://watchtower.org/e/20061201/article...|`|564d359090a6d360bec9ee3849107a51aa	Joseph, You are a Born again Christian so you will not have to worry yourself over this. The book of Revelation is written in sequence and in the order of which events shall take place according To God. I am going to show you,,,     Revelation 4:1-2 After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter.    2 And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne.    Do you see in the above scripture where Jesus raptures His church/bride? We are taken up ward and immediately in the spirit and stand before a throne.  This takes place in Revelation 4. What you are talking about takes place in Revelation 13. We Born again Christians will not be here for the events of anything that takes place after Revelation 4:1-2. God said "Come up Hither and I will shew thee things that come here after. We will not be here for anything that happens after Revelation 4:1-2, and that includes Revelation 13.     Revelation 13:17 And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.    So stop worrying. God has you safely tucked inside His hands. Praise the Lord!!!|`|7d647be57724929a656a84a04d156140aa	Joseph, you are absolutely right.  In these last days they are stepping things up a notch so when the real chip is to be placed in your hand or forehead it wouldn't be a big deal.  Many people has already taken the chip or the mark in many different countries.  They have placed them in dogs and other animals for safety reasons, but are thinking of putting them in children so that they can be easily found.  If God is telling you this, do not do it.  It is better to obey than to sacrifice.  You are a smart kid.  For more information on this, if you need I will give you for the asking.  Love, be bless.|`|Icwz678Qaa	Wow Joseph, to be only 16 you really seem to know your book of Revelation.    It is true that the antichrist will mandate that all people will take the mark of the beast or they will not be able to buy or sell anything.    You're even correct in thinking that the lunch fingerprints are the same type of thing.    Exactly as there is a dilemma for you now over whether or not to take this 'mark' and eat lunch or fight this 'mark' and not eat cafeteria lunches.  There will be a time in the near future where Christians will be asked to give into the Beast and his antichrist or to stand up for Christ.    What to do, what to do?    I think that you are on the right road in listening to the Almighty, because there is a reason why you feel uneasy about this fingerprinting issue.    Speak with your parents and/or church clergy over your concerns, to see what course of action to take.    Also pray about it and continue listening to the Almighty.    Be Blessed:-)|`|YzBMCVbPaa	I dont think GOD would tell you not to have your finger scanned. its only done to help identify you. my husbands time clock at work is like that too, its just a new scary finger scanning system..|`|b0NccAFFaa	At first glance I would agree with your suspicions except for one thing. It is the anti-christ that enforces the mark. So if it was a system that told you to change your beliefs or you wouldn't get a mark, then I'd be worried.|`|8RKwP3gpaa	I think you should talk to your parents first and see how they feel about the whole fingerprinting scheme. Keep in mind though, whether the believers are raptured out of here before the tribulation or not, you will know exactly what you are doing when you take the mark of the beast. Quit living your life in fear, Jesus set you free from that. He already beat the devil when he died on the cross. God Bless!|`|ec02b3b2ac0531db23e2884c415edc09aa	The mark of the beast will be a world-wide system. From what your school is doing, you can see how easy this step will be to make.  The "mark" represents an allegiance to a world system of "belief" also that is unGodly. Your school is not the mark of the beast though. Go ahead and buy your lunch.  Blessings to you|`|Jyxi74x0aa	Do what the conviction of the Holy Spirit tells you to do, and nothing else. We are indeed approaching the end of days.    God bless.|`|Zh2h845qaa	First of all this has nothing to do with the bible. The book is a bunch of interpertations of limited explanations. Back then they didn't know anything and interperted to the best of their knowledge. Let the book guide you morally, not figuratively. Did you know the "Age of Christ" is an interpertation of the Age of Libra? Read on the Zodian Calandar to gain some insight to the "man with water", 3 day resurection in acordance with the sun at the time of his death and resurection, etc.     As far as the fingerprinting, it's a BS process that will allow the government and police agencies put you into a database. It's crap, there's no good reason to scan your fingerprints. |`|CH6v7kCoaa	come on man...im not tryin to bash on your religion and i believe that the bible is to be takin as a guideline for life, but not the way your doin it. i don't think the school requiring a fingerprint is a bad thing. Schools just try to be cool by using whatever new technology they can get the government to pay for no matter how annoying it is for the people who use it...and i suggest you get finger printed so you dont go hungry lol|`|o3Jpfflgaa	Joseph:    If you read the book of Revelation, you'll see that when the Antichrist causes the "Mark of the Beast" to begin, the Antichrist will be a world-class leader.    One of the first things the Antichrist will do will be to establish a world peace due to his satanically-inspired intelligence and reasoning ability.  He will be recognized world-wide as a great man except by Christians (who won't be fooled).  We are all identified by government numbers, our records are mostly public and can be accessed by any minor bureaucrat.  A fingerprint isn't the Mark.    It is my personal opinion that the Mark will be a special, new, medical technique that will be developed for that purpose.  I can be very wrong, though.|`|AA11039615	The Bible says that the mark is IN your forehead , meaning IN your mind.  satan marks ones mind with his deception.   The mark on the hand really means one is doing satans work.  If you stay in Gods Word and love God, I don't think you need to worry about anything.  Just because someone scans your thumb, or even if they put chips in your body and tattooed  666 all over your body, that wouldn't change what's in your mind and heart.  God judges ones heart.|`|axT0Gl0haa	The mark of the beast isn't here yet.  It is only in the future when antichrist takes power over the whole world.  |`|2NGCD7y2aa	'MakeSure's answer "hits the nail on the head"!    Those having the mark of the 'beast' give to "Caesar" [world governments] that what actually belongs to God (Luke 20:25; Revelation 13:4,8; 14:1), by giving worshipful honor &/or support to the political state, its symbols, & its military might, to which they look for hope and salvation. Any worship that they render the true God is merely lip service.    Faithful worshippers of our Creator instead give all honor & support to God's heavenly kingdom government, ruled by his son Jesus Christ, along with his chosen brothers from among mankind . . .

dnU4OgNeaa	Are you asking me what you believe?    How about you write the faith statement first, a list (a draft in dot points) of what you believe about God and Bible and Church: then put next to each dot *why* you believe that (or where you got that belief from).  Hopefully some of those reasons will either be BIble verses themselves, or stuff older Christians have taught/told you that is based on Bible versus.    I don't think you can sum up all you believe in one verse, although you could probably choose one of the several you find which is "the most important".    (For me that verse changes, depending on what is happening in my life...God doesn't change but the bit of Him I need to focus on changes.)    BUT...standard verses like Acts 16:31, John 3:16-17, John 10:10 are pretty easy to snap off if you just want to hand in something to get the homework out of the way.    :-)|`|DCnDLfnSaa	Look in the Bible book Acts.  You can also pray the Third Glorious Mystery of the Rosary in preparation for Confirmation (The Descent of the Holy Spirit on Mary and the Apostles).  Mary has made the following promises to Christians who recite the Rosary:    1.  Whoever shall faithfully serve me by the recitation of the rosary, shall receive signal graces.  2.  I promise my special protection and the greatest graces to all those who shall recite the rosary.  3.  The rosary shall be a powerful armour against hell, it will destroy vice, decrease sin, and defeat heresies.  4.  It will cause virtue and good works to flourish; it will obtain for souls the abundant mercy of God; it will withdraw the hearts of men from the love of the world and its vanities, and will lift them to the desire of eternal things.  Oh, that souls would sanctify themselves by this means.  5.  The soul which recommends itself to me by the recitation of the rosary, shall not perish.  6.  Whoever shall recite the rosary devoutly, applying himself to the consideration of its sacred mysteries shall never be conquered by misfortune.  God will not chastise him in His justice, he shall not perish by an un provided death; if he be just he shall remain in the grace of God, and become worthy of eternal life.  7.  Whoever shall have a true devotion for the rosary shall not die without the sacraments of the Church.  8.  Those who are faithful to recite the rosary shall have during their life and at their death the light of God and the plentitude of His graces; at the moment of death they shall participate in the merits of the saints in paradise.  9.  I shall deliver from purgatory those who have been devoted to the rosary.  10.  The faithful children of the rosary shall merit a high degree of glory in heaven.  11.  You shall obtain all you ask of me by the recitation of the rosary.  12.  All those who propagate the holy rosary shall be aided by me in their necessities.  13.  I have obtained from my Divine Son that all the advocates of the rosary shall have for intercessors the entire celestial court during their life and at the hour of death.  14. All who recite the rosary are my sons, and brothers of my only son Jesus Christ.  15.  Devotion of my rosary is a great sign of predestination.     God bless!

The bible says one must be baptized of water and spirit.    In the Catholic Church, what is called baptism is "of water".  Confirmation is the "of spirit" part.    I hope this helps, but I'm not going to give you a verse.  Confirmation is very important and I encourage you to put a lot of effort into your "assignment"|`|axT0Gl0haa	There is no "confirmation" in the Bible.     Catholicism teaches a false gospel of works that leads to eternal hell (Galatians 1:6-9).     Catholicism cannot save, so avoid it. Only JESUS saves.     The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross and rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you are saved, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)  
EKmXACCIaa	I watched the clip. Basically though, there is sooooo much surrounding the new testament that was left out of the bible already that I wouldn't be surprised if there was a scroll somewhere telling us Jesus was a Street Racer from San Diego. This proves nothing to me, and certainly doesn't increase my belief in any god at all. Sorry.      But other than that, wow the sheer level of hypocrisy is astonishing.  All the whining and bitching you religious folk have poured on us atheists "You should learn to respect our beliefs!" Well here's YOUR respect for others beliefs right here!    "Islam is a newcomer religion" !?   I think 1400 years is more than enough to establish firm credentials. You should thank Islamic society for the preservation of knowledge and science. I know I do.  Whilst Muslims created a huge empire, built banks, paved and lit their streets and made advances in astronomy, mathematics and philosophy, Christians reduced themselves to living in mud hovels and arguing over the trinity. Oh such was the light of Christ!    Its even more rich coming from a Nation full of Baptists. Prejudicial, Puritanical, addicted to a 17th century Anglican propaganda bible and ideologically less than 400 years old. What makes you lot think you're anything special in the story of Christianity, let alone religion?  The Greek Orthodox are probably the closest organisation to the original church and therefore by your logic, must be the most true to god's word.    Atheists are fair game and I don't mind at all taking your vitriol as it only convinces me further of god's non-existence. It just demonstrates that inside you're as full of basic human emotions of anger and hate as the rest of us and that your faith brings you an armour of nothing.    But your lack of respect for other religions is deeply saddening. Can't you just see you're all mirrors of each other? You all believe in something with same zealous fire. Islam and Christianity are more alike it my view than they are dissimilar.

Strong feelings in this thread.    Just a food for thought for the thought that Islam is bad to women, as a Muslim woman myself, I feel I would like to offer my thoughts. Through the western eye, I think that westerners in general have a difficult time distinguishing between religion and culture. A lot of the oppression of women and other things the media shows are completely culture. For example, spousal abuse is an acceptable practice in a lot of families of Albania whether they are Christians, Muslims, or any other religion. Islam directly forbids this. To go against this prohibition is a sin. Culturally, they are doing something that is acceptable but religiously, they are committing a grave sin. Domestic violence exists in every culture and a minority of followers from every faith commit this sin. It is not an Islamic practice.    Islam affords women rights that no previous religion gave her. And this includes the right to independence and the right to respect and love from your spouse. To be abused by your spouse is a sin. Again, there is a difference between culture and religion and the myths of oppression of women stem from cultural practices not from Islam. Here is a short list of the rights guaranteed to women in Islam:  http://www.themodernreligion.com/women/w...    A verse from Qur'an says  "And among His signs is this, that He created for you mates from among yourselves, that you may dwell in tranquility with them, and he has put love and mercy between your (hearts)..." Qu'ran 30:21    "The best of you are those who treat their wives the best." Prophet Muhammed (peace be upon him)    And to clear another misstatement in this thread, we Muslims do not believe nor are we told that humans were made from blood clots. We believe God created Adam with clay soil of the Earth and God breathed life into him which is similar to the Christian belief. Please don't say mistruths unless you have educated yourself properly. It states in Qur'an: And (remember) when your Lord said to the angels: I am going to create a human (Adam) from sounding clay of altered black smooth mud.  So when I have fashioned him and breathed into him (his) soul created by Me, then you fall down prostrate to him. (Quran 38:71-72)

No one could love anybody without the love of God in your heart.  When you experienced the love of God, it is so easy to love, it's almost seems impossible.|`|atfKCzmPaa	Jesus told his followers that they would be recognized by a love that transcends racial, national, and all other boundaries. He said: I am giving you a new commandment, that you love one another; just as I have loved you, that you also love one another. Then he added: By this all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love among yourselves.John 13:34, 35; 15:12, 13. Jesus teachings about love, backed up by his example, worked a first-century miracle. His followers came to imitate their Master, learning to love one another in a way that drew widespread attention and admiration. Tertullian, a writer of the second and third centuries?C.E., quoted non-Christians as commending Jesus followers: See how they love one another and how they are ready to die for one another.  Indeed, the apostle John wrote: We are under obligation to surrender our souls for our brothers. (1?John 3:16) Jesus even taught his followers to love their enemies. (Matthew 5:43-45) What is the consequence when people truly love others as Jesus taught them to?  A professor of political science evidently pondered that question. So he asked, as recorded in The Christian Century: Can anyone seriously conceive of Jesus hurling hand grenades at his enemies, using a machine gun, manipulating a flamethrower, dropping nuclear bombs or launching an ICBM which would kill or cripple thousands of mothers and children?  In answer, the professor said: The question is so absurd that it scarcely merits an answer. So he posed the question: If Jesus could not do this and be true to his character, then how can we do it and be true to him? We should not be surprised, therefore, by the position of neutrality taken by Jesus early followers, which is well documented by many history books. Consider just two examples.  Our World Through the Ages, by N. Platt and M. J. Drummond, says: The behavior of the Christians was very different from that of the Romans. .?.?. Since Christ had preached peace, they refused to become soldiers. And The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, by Edward Gibbon, states: [Early Christians] refused to take any active part in the civil administration or the military defence of the empire. .?.?. It was impossible that the Christians, without renouncing a more sacred duty, could assume the character of soldiers.  What About Today?--Is Christlike love practiced by anybody today? The Encyclopedia Canadiana observes: The work of Jehovahs Witnesses is the revival and re-establishment of the primitive Christianity practised by Jesus and his disciples .?.?. All are brothers.  What does that mean? It means that Jehovahs Witnesses allow nothingneither race, nationality, nor ethnic backgroundto cause them to hate their neighbors. Nor will they kill anyone, for they have figuratively beaten their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning shears, as the Bible foretold true servants of God would.Isaiah 2:4.  No wonder an editorial in Californias Sacramento Union noted: Suffice it to say that if all the world lived by the creed of the Jehovah Witnesses there would be an end of bloodshed and hatred, and love would reign as king!  Similarly, a writer in Hungarys Ring magazine remarked: I have come to the conclusion that if Jehovahs Witnesses were the only ones living on the earth, wars would cease to exist, and the only duties of the policemen would be to control traffic and to issue passports.  In the Italian church magazine Andare alle genti, a Roman Catholic nun also wrote admiringly of the Witnesses: They refuse any form of violence and without rebelling put up with the many trials inflicted on them because of their beliefs .?.?. How different the world would be if we all woke up one morning firmly decided not to take up arms again, whatever the cost or the reason, just like Jehovahs Witnesses!  The Witnesses are noted for taking the initiative to help their neighbors. (Galatians 6:10) In her book Women in Soviet Prisons, a Latvian said she became very sick while working at the Potma penal camp in the mid-1960s. All through my sickness [the Witnesses] were diligent nurses. I could not have wished for better care, especially under camp conditions. She added: Jehovahs Witnesses consider it their duty to help everyone, regardless of religion or nationality.  Recently the public press in the Czech Republic took note of such conduct of the Witnesses in concentration camps. Commenting on the documentary The Lost Home, produced in Brno, the newspaper Severo?esky denk observed: It is noteworthy that even these reliable contemporaries [Czech and Slovak Jewish survivors] have with marked admiration testified in favor of prisoners from among Jehovahs Witnesses. They were very courageous people, who were always helping us in whatever way they could, although running the risk of execution, many commented. They prayed for us, as though we belonged to their family; they encouraged us not to give up|`|CUFnorZyaa	Serve them.

My religion is love, what Christ commanded, and love dictates my life. |`|7FYxl8w9aa	I would like to give you my view on this.     The Bible makes it clear that breaking God's law is sin. The ten commandments sums up all this. Jesus expounded this by telling us that so much as looking at someone with lust is committing adultry, and that hating your brother without cause is murder. The Jews had such high reverence for God's name, that some of them wouldn't even utter it. Using God's name in a manner other than reverent is known as blasphemy.    Before I knew Jesus, I was a lying, theiving, blasphemous, murdering, adulterer... and that's just the tip of the iceburg! Do you think you are any better? Answer a couple questions here -    1. Have you ever told a lie?  2. Have you ever stolen anything (Downloading music you havn't paid for, taking anything that doesn't belong to you, even a pen!)  3. Have you ever used God's name in vain?  4. Have you ever looked at someone (other than your spouse) with lust?  5. Have you ever hated anyone without a good reason?  6. Were you obedient to your parents?    If you answer yes to these questions (as I know most everyone has done all these things), that makes you a lying, theiving, blasphemous, murdering, adulterous human. Just like everyone else. Jesus said no one is good. Not one person! Isaiah tells us the very best a human can possibly do, the very, very best, is nothing but filthy rags to God, He's that good.     Only a perfect person can go to heaven and be with Jesus. Unfortunatly, nobody is perfect. There has only been one person in the entire history of earth who kept all of the law, in letter and spirit. His reward for being perfect? Crucifixion. Lucky for us He rose from His grave!    If you are not perfect, the justice and judgment of God condems you to eternity in Hell. Jesus paid the price for my sins, and he offered me forgivness and a chance to live with Him for eternity. He offers this gift to anyone who will come. Any who put their trust in Him and repent (repent means to turn away from) from their sins will recieve His forgivness.    So, to answer your question, why do some people let religion dictate their lives? Before, I was lost and headed to Hell. Forever burning in the lake of fire. Very painfull. But then I got saved from this fate! Jesus made the way for me to be saved!     It is the very least I can do to go to church, pay my tithes, do good works to show my faith (good works cannot get someone into heaven by the way), and most importantly, tell others about what Jesus has done for me, so that maybe they will believe and repent and trust. I want to see heaven so full it is bursting at the seams! Jesus did so much for me (like, DYING), I want to do as much as I possibly can to help others too!    The Bible shapes my views on pretty much every issue in the world. God says he knew and shaped David in the womb. Seems to me that means that there is life in there, and makes an abortion murder. Jesus said to give to Cesar what is his, so I pay my taxes without complaining. The Bible tells us that our rulers are appointed by God, so while I will cast my vote on election day, I don't worry about who will be elected. The Bible tells us that homosexuality is an abomination to the Lord, so I'm against encouraging this behavior by legalising marriages between gay couples.    The biggest area religion dictates my life, however, is in witnessing. On one hand, I feel a little bad that I irritate people sometimes, but then I just remember what is at stake. It's their soul, and where it is destined to go. It is nothing less than my duty to make sure as many people as possible fully understand their condition, and the consequenses of it. It is also my duty to make sure they know about the way out of the judgment. A way to escape hell. Jesus paid the debt, the hard part is done. Believe and be saved!     In conclusion, I let religion dictate my life because people's immortal souls are at stake, and I couldn't rest easy at night if I didn't do as much as I could to warn them.

Please read this; Genesis 6:5-8 Then the Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. And the Lord was sorry that He had made man on the earth, and He was grieved in His heart. So the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth, both man and beast creeping thing and birds of the air for I am sorry that I have made them. But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord. God was sorry for creating man because of their wickedness. Romans 3:23 For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. Yes all of us are sinners. Nobody is exempted including me. For this reason God sent His Son to help us. Like Noah Jesus came to offer our salvation. Like Noah he should tell the people that there is salvation through Him. Noah built the ark for 120 years giving people the chance to be saved from total destruction but nobody listened to him. The flood came and all except Noah, his wife, his three sons Shem, Ham an Japheth and their wives were saved. So God had to start another civilization through them. The Jews were the children of Shem. They were hated by the world because Satan knew that Jesus will be born through them. Genesis 3:15 this was promised by God to Satan, the woman Eve and her husband Adam that He will sent a Seed to bruise Satan's head in the end.  Anti-Semitism prospered which was highlighted by Hitler's Holocaust. This was his Final Solution to the Jewish Question. God allowed this to happen in order to cleanse them to prepare them for the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. So now they are in there proper place. What are happening to the world today are manifestations of the things Jesus had warned us in Matthew 24 please read this. To Noah there had been 120 years chances for people to repent but they did not. For the world there had been 2000 years chances for the whole world to repent. We are now in 2008 an extension of 75 years had been allotted by God for us to make good with our lives. Please read Daniel 12:11-12 this will tell us how the 75 years extension will be fulfilled. We will see the fulfillment of these things as we move along the next few years God has allotted for us. This is the reason why we would like people to understand now. God wants everybody to be with Him to everlasting life where there will be joy, laughter and songs. In contrast to the eternal torment where there will be sorrow pain and weeping. Matthew 25:30 And cast the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Mark 9:48 Where their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched. God loves us so much and his heart is always grieving because of our transgressions I for one is not exempted. Who says that he or she never sinned is a liar. I am a sinner day after day but Jesus is interceding for me every second every minute every hour in front of the Father God to forgive me. Day and night God is craving for everyone of us to come back to Him. So that we will not suffer the torment He had prepared for Satan and his angels. Hell is for Satan and all the angels that rebelled against God. They cannot escape this torment that is why they corrupted the mind of the people created by God. Satan wants many people to accompany him in hell. Satan's crafty business is creeping in all of our churches today and our only refuge is Jesus Christ no more and no one else. John 14:6 Jesus said to him, I am the way the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.    |`|79529314dfb5ac7be366558924c3393baa	They feel that either one, they're obliged to by their god, or two, they have no other way to live a happy life. Often both. It also depends a lot on the religion, some religions (like islam) are very authoritarian while others (like buddhism) are less so, and people who follow less authoritarian religions will naturally tend not to make religion an overwhelming part of their lives. Ultimately, what we see through the history of the past few thousand years is that religions are memes and evolve in a way similar to species of biological life forms, and the religions that were more forceful with their adherents tended to be more successful because they granted less opportunity for people to question them and eventually abandon them.

fdb2eb2f4c9344e092dc65cdb24a9c1eaa	My favorite verse at the moment is:Ecclesiastes 3-3:8     A Time for Everything and a season for every activity under heaven:   a time to be born and a time to dye,   a time to plant and a time to uproot   a ime to kill and a time to heal   a time to tear down and a time to build   a time to weep and a time to laugh   a time tomourn and a time to dance   a time to scatter stones and a time to gather them   a time to embrace and a time to refrain   a time to search and a time to give up   a time to keep and a time to throw away   a time to tear and a time to mend   a time to be silent and a time to speak   a time to love and a time to hate   a time for war and a time for peace       The verse helps me realize that each season of my life is truly a blessing and only happens for a short time , it helps me live more in the present moment and be thankful in all situations.  |`|Ks6Ac9SSaa	Love one another  the 23 Psalm too|`|SBF6jqlLaa	"a word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in settings of silver."

Xsen794Aaa	First, I think she should talk to someone and really take some time to reflect before she even has sex again.  As you can see, her actions right now are results of her regrets.  I'm sure if she has another baby, she'll be just as good a mother as she was with the other two, but she needs to let her brain trump her emotions just this once and think about if she really wants to have another child.    I understand not wanting to have another abortion, but she should still think about if she does get pregnant, and that child grows up are finds out that he/she was only conceived out of regret, how's that supposed to make everyone feel?  Ask her that.  Also, talk to her husband about it if you think you have that kind of relationship with him too.  Be tactful of course, as you can see this is an emotional time.|`|564d359090a6d360bec9ee3849107a51aa	I'm sorry but your friend is foolish to believe that it is Gods' will for her to pregnant again when God tells us to avoid fornication. I think she is trying to get pregnant on purpose so she can kept his baby so she can rid herself of the guilt of killing her first baby. The sad thing is that no matter how many children she has, she still killed her baby and all the pregnancy's in the world will not undo that for her. She needs to abstain from having sex all together. As a friend you should tell her that. Show her what God's word says.    1 Corinthians 7:2 Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.    Exodus 21:22 If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine.    Your friend is so misguided and so wrong in her way of thinking. Children are not disposable, only their diapers are.|`|yyDXbt6Baa	ok first of all is your friend even married. its fornication if your not married and have sex. and if she is truly sorry for having an abortion god will forgive her but i would reccomend you telling her not to have sex befor marriage.|`|SyCRNqqLaa	to answer your question:  i think she needs to forgive herself more than anything.  it'd probably help if she weren't surrounded by a bunch of people telling her how wrong abortion is.|`|7Gd8iodUaa	Make sure she takes her medication or you'll tell her parents!|`|AA10280192	Perhaps she should discontinue having sex, that's the greatest birth control known.  It would give her the opportunity to examine the road she is on.|`|100f3b822d2aae0d4998a7e0134e4d7eaa	Sure,God is in the forgiving business. |`|b7Lo5IAZaa	I think it is completely possible for a woman to be forgiven for abortion and she can let go of the guilt if repented for the abortion. If she is giving up BC as a form of self punishment or retribution that is unnecessary and I hope she will someday forgive herself and forgive whoever coerced her into it. But she needs to bring a child into this world with the correct mind frame and consideration if she can provide for the child. |`|K2dNndE2aa	is she married? because if she isnt, i highly doubt she's a TRUE christian, sorry. but ive been liek that before, just believing in God and doing stuff. once i finally got a relationship with Him, i didnt even wanna live like that anymore, and i WANTED to do whats right. so i dont think she should even be having sex.    and of course Gods going to give her a secodn chance. thats why he DIED for her. and you. and me. she asked for forgiveness and if she really means it, then he has already forgiven and forgotten about it. thats the love of god. he loves her no matter what she's done, and he'll always let her come back. but i dont think she should just be going out there having sex saying God will do what he wants, because if she is having premarital sex shes WILLINGLY sinning, and knowing shes doing and act that is ONLY for marriage. everyone has temptation, but everytime youre tempted its an opportunity to grow in character. depends how you handle it.|`|7d647be57724929a656a84a04d156140aa	1 John 2:1 "Jesus said that we should not sin, but if we do we have an advocate with the Father in heaven."

Your friend needs mental help, not another baby.|`|bqIrBR6kaa	Fine. But, is she married?|`|PsOacBMlaa	"its fornication if your not married and have sex."    Not only is this irrelevant, but it's also untrue. It says in 1 Corinthians that you can have sex before you marry as long as you eventually marry the person you're having sex with.     Anyways, I'm not a Christian, but if your friend truly believes his word, then she should know that God forgives all sin, except blasphemy, but that's beside the point.|`|cVvYirkgaa	yes of course he will!  his mercy is unlimitless!|`|I15Wjrcmaa	If she's a Christian she doesn't need to worry about how many chances she has.

Hopefully she will never make the same mistake again. If she does, that sin would be covered too.|`|oQPrvGnAaa	I think anyone who doesn't realize who's will it is to get pregnant (minus rape), is a few sandwiches short of a picnic.|`|vUIa1o7Jaa	Your friend is trying to repent by having another child. I believe if she truly wanted to repent, she only needs to forgive herself. God, as I understand the being, has already forgiven her. She is now creating her own hell, she needs to mourn and move on. I would suggest you speak to your friend about getting some professional help or to speak to her priest.   You should offer non-judgmental support and unbiased friendship. I would not try to argue reason, she needs to find that for herself. |`|TfgscKiYaa	I think she should look at her finances closely and ask herself if she can truly afford to raise a third child.

She doesn't follow the gospels...|`|QP8LdPLeaa	okay....here's my opinion.    if she isn't ready for a baby, she needs to STOP having sex, meaning, practice keeping her legs closed, she already has two and got rid of one. if she believes in God, then that should have been enough for her to practice safe sex. just tell her to forgive herself and watch out next time.|`|AA11209831	Of course God will forgive.    But, I would argue with her that she got pregnant while on birth control, so if it is His will that she gets pregnant again God can get around her being on it.    It is not medically safe to go on and off of that stuff.  I dated a chick once that explained that it regulates a woman's period, and even though I wouldn't know, I would assume that would be a good thing.|`|9cNTkhmQaa	I think God is forgiving and she will still be in his good graces.  But next time, she should make decisions based upon her self and no one else.  |`|26cb6190c99a848bb4c18aed374707c0aa	I think that if she is following God's will, she has a husband that is there as part of God's will.  If not she is picking and choosing what she considers worthy of God's approval.      God forgives no matter what when one is truly repentant.  She needs to let go of the coercion thing and realize she ultimately made that decision.

From my understanding, their position on the California prop was one about protecting their religious rights, and was never perpetrated or presented as being about being anti- gay. From my experience with mormons, most have been very accepting and loving of all kinds of people including gays. I honestly think they do not feel that this prop was about being against homosexuality, as much as it was protecting the "religious right" from religious backlash, like tax exepmt status, public officials jobs, and the public schools. At least that is what I got from the ones that I talked to. Never once did anyone mention anything about it being because they didn't like gays.|`|AA11472314	Mormons are not anti-gay, but they are anti-rewriting scripture, law, and charity for the cause of a lifestyle.|`|AA10637643	Who said we are anti-gay??

My feet get pretty dirty especially when I walk through a park. My mom always encouraged me to go barefoot often but stated the 'common sense' rule too so that I wouldn't risk injury.    As for theme parks yes I have been, not just a water park but I went to one and on a ride some girls took off their flip flops but I kept mine on (for once) anyway the ride spun us around upside down and all that and my flip flops flew off and never saw them again so I spent the rest of the day there barefoot.

You will go to heaven , where good people like you reside.    It didnt have anything to do with who you believe in.    By the virtue of your deeds and your kind heart  , your soul is gradually transformed by all these good qualities .    At the end of your life, your soul will be attracted to a place , where the beings who lived there , have the same heaven like qualities like yours .     You will enjoy bliss and happiness and you would have light shining out of your soul.    The place is called heaven.    IMHO, you have to walk your talk , whether you are Buddhist , Christian or Hindu.     I think it is of no use to just talk about labels but you do nothing to change/ improve  your character and be good and do good to other people , for other people.

The short answer is: It depends on what you mean by "believe" in Jesus. And from what you have said -- Yes, I think you are going to Hell, because it appears you are trusting the wrong thing to get you to Heaven.     I know that sounds judgmental and arrogant. So, I am going to assume that you are sincere in your question, and will attempt to give the thorough answer that this most important of questions deserves. With this question, it's important to understand that your opinion, my opinion, or anyone else's opinion does not matter. So please don't be put off by what I think. It's just my opinion, based on what you have said. What matters is what God thinks.    Just as there are absolutes in the physical realm which no one would question (such as gravity), there are absolutes in the spiritual realm. But for some reason, the idea of a spiritual absolute, or TRUTH, which is true regardless of a myriad of conflicting beliefs, is offensive.  Jesus said "I am THE way, THE truth, and THE life. No one comes to the Father except through me." (John 14:6)  The emphasis is mine, but He did claim to be "the" way, not "a" way. That sounds really narrow minded, right? Don't many roads lead to God? (Our human objections to what Jesus said sound reasonable, don't they? But remember, our opinions don't matter.)    Your question could be restated "Shouldn't I go to heaven because I am a good person and do A, B, and C good things, and I don't do X, Y, and Z bad things?" If you accept the premise that God gets to set the criteria for who goes to heaven, because HE IS GOD and heaven is His place, then to answer your question,     YOU HAVE TO START WITH GOD!    1. God is HOLY.     That means he is perfect. (1 Peter 1:15&16)    All evil is repulsive to him, or in modern terminology, evil makes him want to throw up. (Habakkuk 1:13)    He gets to set the standard for what it means to be righteous, beginning with the Ten Commandments (Exodus 20), which Jesus summarized as "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind. ... And love your neighbor as yourself." (Matthew 22:37-39)     Then, we need to look at ourselves, in light of God's holiness.    1. God is holy.  2. We (me, you, along with all of mankind) are not.    That means we fall short of the standard God has set for us, which is perfection. (1 Peter 1:15&16)    "All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God." (Romans 3:23)    You mentioned all the bad things you don't do. If you think you are perfect, you might as well stop reading now, because none of this will mean anything to you.    Can you honestly say you have never lied? (The concept of a "white lie" is man-made, not from God.)    Jesus explained the concept of sin on a different level in Matthew 5. Sin is not just external actions, but includes what's in our mind and heart (i.e. anger, lust).    If you are still not convinced that you are part of the "All" in "All have sinned . . .", think of the greatest commandment that Jesus gave us. Have you always, every minute of every day, loved God with all your heart, never made a decision based on what you wanted without seeking God's will first?    If you think you are, and have always been, and always will be without sin, pride has made you "hardened by the deceitfulness of sin" (Hebrews 3:13). And seriously, you might as well stop reading now.     But if you can accept   1. God is holy.  2. All have sinned (including yourself)                then the next thing to understand is    3. Sin has consequences.    "But your iniquities (sins) have separated you from your God; your sins have hidden his face from you, so that he will not hear." Isaiah 59:2    "The wages of sin is death." (Romans 6:23)  "Wages" in this verse has exactly the same meaning as it does for all of us who work for pay -- it's what we earn for what we do. And what we earn by our sin is death.     Sin earns the death penalty. There is physical death (Hebrews 9:27), spiritual death (Ephesians 2:1), and eternal death, or Hell (2 Thessalonians 1:8&9).  A person can be physically alive, but dead in his relationship to God because of the separation caused by his sin. If we die physically while separated from God, that separation just continues on into eternity. That's what Hell is -- eternal separation from God.    If this is all true, we're all in trouble. What can we do?? People throughout history have tried all kinds of things to get to God. A big one is religion. Another one is "good deeds." But religion or good deeds don't work, because neither pays the death penalty.       3. What we earn by our sin is death, or Hell.  4. There is nothing we can do to make up for our sin.    Mankind has come up with several mistaken concepts to try to make up for our sin. One is that since He knows that everybody is going to sin, God must grade on a curve, comparing us with each other, and looking for who has less sins or more good deeds.    What if a group of people were challenged to swim the English Channel. Some would hardly be able to make any distance at all, some would probably reach half way or more, but a few may actually make it.  This, however, is not the comparison we need to make in looking at our lives in light of God's standard of perfection. What if that same group of people were to start on the coast of California and were told they must swim to Hawaii? There would again be much variation in how far each would go, but none would even come close to making it. And relative to the total distance required, they would all look pretty much the same in how far short they fell .

Jesus said, I am the WAY the Truth, and the Life.  No man can come to the Father but through Me.  Even if an angel appears to you and tell you of another way to God...let him be cursed.  The difference between region and Christians is religions are asking you to believe this way or that way when Christians are asking you to RECEIVE someone in your life.  Christ is alive and wants to prove it to you and He will if you seek Him......Buddha and vishnu are taking many to hell.  There is no other name under all Heaven for men to call upon to be saved.  Either the Bible is all lies or all truth.  Many millions all over the world have found Christ and know the Book is true.  Christ is who He claimed to be and willing to prove it.  Man says,  God prove yourself to me and I will believe but God said....Believe and I will prove myself to you.  There is a way that seems right unto man...but the end leads to death.  There is only one way and Jesus tells us about it.  He said, I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life.  No man can come to the Father but through me.  Millions have come and there is still room for one...yes there is room at the cross for you.  Jesus said, behold...I stand at the door ( to your heart)(inner-self)(soul)and knock...if any man will hear my voice and opens the door....I will come in.

Ask Jesus to forgive you of your sins, and come into your heart and save you. You Trust in Him, by Faith.

1e80f0839685eeb7cf43835c96c7fe7faa	Haven't heard of Hebrew Apostolics, but I know that there are a number of groups that still preach the Acts chapter 2:38 experience. I was immersed in water and spoke in tongues and am thus born again by water and spirit according to John 3:5. This happend on the 18th of June 1989 at the Newcastle Revival Centre who in turn passed me on by a letter of recommendation to the chruch which is now called Christian Assemblies International (www.cai.org)    When I was about 13 years old I read 1 Corinthians 14. I was brought up as a prostestant, but did not really know God. I was really curious to find out what speaking in tongues and prophecies were, because the chapter sounded so exciting, seemed there was more to Chritstian faith than just sitting in a cold chruch mumbleling some songs trying to be a good person, I always wished that somehow I'd like to make contact with that God and that he'd intervene in my life. When I finally at age 16 heard someone speak in tongues I was so full of my old chruch doctrine that I shyly looked around in the assembly to find the Aboriginal person who I thought must have just prayed in their own tongue (this was in Australia). Though there were Americans, Indians and others I never found the Aborigine. I took heart and asked about it and discovered to my great joy that what I read in Corinthians is still alive. I went on a trip outback (the beautiful desert centre of Australia). On the bus I met a Finnish girl who had just received tho Holy Spirit prior to this travel. When I came back I got baptised and filled with the Holy Spirit on the same day. Now I know what Jesus Christ meant when he said, "Acts 1:8 ?But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth."|`|96cd1744acaf1e87751ac1ec9c729b19aa	Yes I immersed in water often when I was working as a professional diver.

Secondly i was almost hijacked in a methodist church but never really joined the church and thirdly in the Mormon LDS church.   as a child I had a couple scary incidents in the spirit. One of them was an angel voice asking me When i was going to do my mission. i think i was 9 mayb ten. but just around that time I was sleeping in the camper that was owned by my grandfather but barrowed by my father so i can spend the summer at his house. that one night I had trouble falling asleep and after i stopped resisting, something happened that took several years to think about. I was lifted up out of my bed in what appeared or felt like a catapult. as I raised up into the sky! I later thought it was a coffin that i was being raised up in. when i came to a stop high up above me, i noticed that there was another spirit being at first it seemed to look like me! but then i came face to face with it and eye to eye. Did I see the spirit of God, satan or myself?   i came back down to earth in a reverse pattern and when i opened my eyes I was completely terrified. and ran around my fathers house outside 3 times.  Later on in life i layed on my bed and got up to answer the back door of the house where i saw a spirit being  but waived him off and went back to lay down when the sound of the knock at the door happened again i had to FORCE air back into my lungs as i had stopped breathing. clearly I was have OBE.  Ok after that someone gave me a bible and i began to read and learn how to pray. One day after school an Angel of light appeared in my room and in MY MIND and filled both with light that was so much like being in heaven and being cleansed and purified I dont know what else to call it. Being born of the spirit happened in the power of the light for the first time.  Later on YET again i was reading a promise about receiving the Gift of the HOLY ghost. so much that i began praying for it as well and BEHOLD i saw a GREAT vision of the glory of the Sun and the son of righteousness that I walked inthe power of the spirit of God for a complete month before i made another transgression. the spirit promptly left me.   but then again I also had two other visions and was raised into heaven and ushered by the voice of an angel or the spirit  as well, into the presense of jesus christ.  i think somewhere i had died to receive that vision, and of course there have been many situations where I thought i had been poisoned throughout my entire life where I shouldve died and yet woke up and started breathing, only because of the will of God. in fact ONE time a spirit came to me while I was suffering intensely and He said to me its time to go.

A wife is a woman who is expected to give sex, do laundry, raise the kids, listen to endless "My job sucks" stories, keep track of appointments, make sure the bills get paid, and be happy with a warddrobe full of stained sweat pants and demin jumpers, all while holding down a full time job.    Any question as to why the women of society dislike escorts? :D    As for the men reviling prostitutes and escorts, I suspect that's mostly lip service to keep their wives from putting rat poison in their dinner.

be8bc28543b613879a69dd52009bb1acaa	For one, they grow up being able to multi-task- which is a plus    The negative is that the same things that make them able to multi-task also make them bore quickly when they don't have three or four things going on to keep their mind active.     Relationships suffer because of this inability to concentrate wholly on one thing. Their social skills are awful.    They are a lot more technically saavy, but when it comes to sitting down and hashing out a problem, this is more difficult.  Also think about how they look up information. There is no "Encyclopedia Brittanica" book set to look up information in anymore. Everything is "Googled"- and the results are not always factual.      It also grooms them to need constant positive feedback. They want instant rewards for doing something or they quit.    One thing I am curious to see is how things are going to be different when it comes to their relationships with friends. When we had friends in grade and high school that moved away, we would write letters for a while and maybe visit once or twice and then move on with our lives. Now with facebook and myspace, we can keep tabs on people that we knew in grade school just like they are next door. Socially, I don't know how this is going to affect them, but, again, I am very curious to see.     As for making them want to fight and hurt more, I don't really see any difference between that and the violent cartoons that we watched growing up.  My little brother thought he was "He-Man" for his entire childhood and now he is a fine, functioning, citizen.  I mean think about it, our grandparents grew up with REAL daily violence (WWII, legal domestic violence, public hangings, child labor) and they made it through OK.     I am scared to know what will happen if we have a huge power failure.  My husband gave me good evidence of what it might be like (We were born in the 70's). We were stuck at the airport trying to change airlines about a month ago. My husband did not have internet access to buy new tickets and wad ready to drive over 1000 miles to Texas because there was "just no way" to get tickets without the internet. I picked up the phone and dialed 1411, asked for the airline and bought tickets by phone. He was completely shocked that I thought of doing that (you know, since that was the way we did it in the "old" days) Maybe that gives a glimpse into what "reality" is like for a generation that is used to having all of this information at hand- because we're old foagies!     The same thing happens every time we leave the house without the cell phone. Its like we suddenly don't know how to function without all of our gadgets. I bet they feel like they are in hell!    And speaking of cell phones and power outages.. cable line phone goes out, internet goes out, cell phone runs out of power and can't be charged.... how you gonna call someone? Who has land lines these days? Will our kids know what to do?    And one more thing- THEY CAN'T SPELL.    I don't think all is lost for this generation, there are great books out there that kids can still sit and read like we did when we were young.  They still play sports and have to sit in class. I think that as long as parents take the initiative and make sure that their child spends so many hours a day with no media (with a book or at the table having a conversation, camping, playing outside, etc.) then the kid is going to be able to function.|`|780899f9afc7c12d8063d374f6ea44f6aa	U are right. Information overload reduces the capacity to think for oneself. Everything is packed and given in easily understandable portions. So there is no time, or perceived need for analysis. This is worrying. Particularly if the information is not free from any bias.

You need to really understand what is really most important and look for that.    You can have a strong, charismatic man who can hold his own, but he's not about to show sensitivity to any woman. And most are egomaniacs. I know. Some are friends. They are great people, but they believe women must swoon at their feet because they are THE MAN.  Or you can have a sensitive, caring man who will be a great lover, father and husband.

SM63ybQNaa	There are several different types of schizophrenia with the most common symptom of hearing voices. Paranoia and depression usually occur with this.  Most people with it do lead perfectly normal lives and symptoms usually appear occasionally - not all the time like it's led to believe.  Ideally you and your family need to find out as much as you can about his condition. Every case is different.  If you're present when he's having an episode you need to be calm and supportive. Don't say there's nothing there/no voices etc. This will only intimidate him and possibly make him more anxious. And definitely don't say you believe him.   Inside his head this is real and very frightening.  He must know that his family are behind him 100%.  Wishing you all the best.|`|8671166cbe064a422807399152e8d334aa	Why are you asking this in R&S??

They are Bush-bashing while being homophobic, and offensive towards gay people.   I do not know why he banned gay marriage, but I'm glad he did.   They should have the same rights as EVERYBODY: to marry a member of the OPPOSITE SEX.   Everyone should get another right, for which I would be willing to vote for: for EVERYONE to be able to get into a civil union with a member of the same-sex carrying the same rights as the marriage does.  It's not a debate of equal rights, because that is not violated here. If Bush banned civil unions, than I have a problem with him, if marriage, then I agree with him.

Just look at the support they give to isreal.

It is the Israel military specialist  that are alledgedly training American troops in Iraq that are perverting and brainwashing our soldiers. all with the consent of the Jewish government that controls America.    Israel is responsible for all the terrorist acts that are staged and blamed on their enemies so that they can keep Americans involved in their many wars they can't possibly win without the fake war on terrorism which they keep alive so that American people can die for Israels wars. They are a warmongering state and a leach on America. Once they attack Iran and are destroyed once and for all , the world will see that Israel is, was  the terrorist in the middle east. Then and only them  will there be peace on earth once the real terrorist are punished for their crimes against humanity. Dismantle Israel now and give the stolen land back to Palistine!

6db594b65b6117a480077dcbcbd7f3e8aa	The underlying issues you hint at are caused by the loose federation of Islamic leadership, with no coordinated definition of Islamic orthodoxy.    To me the most vital thing Islam needs is some centralized authority speaking out against the acts of the radicals. Unfortunately, Islam is very non-hierarchical, so there is no central group of perceived leaders of the Islamic faith that speak with one voice and condemn the actions of the heretical.    Where is the public outcry from Islam's theologians over the acts of these radicals? It is missing in the media and the silence among the leadership is deafening to the observers on the sidelines.    If Christian radicals were performing the acts that we see Islamic fundamentalists doing, there would be a world outcry among the leaders of Christian organizations condemning these persons as heretics. It would be in all the newspapers, television, etc.    Muslims are quick to point to the violence recorded in the Christian bible and claim that Christianitys early history was violent, too. But unlike the Bible where some very awful HISTORY is recorded, the violence described in the Quran is part of Islamic THEOLOGY. This is a very significant distinction between the two belief systems.    The famous Muslim scholar and father of modern history Ibn Khaldun states the dichotomy between jihad and defensive warfare thus:     In the Muslim community, the holy war [i.e. jihad] is a religious duty, because of the universalism of the Muslim mission and the obligation to convert everybody to Islam either by persuasion or by force... The other religious groups did not have a universal mission, and the holy war was not a religious duty for them, save only for purposes of defense...  They are merely required to establish their religion among their own people.  That is why the Israeilites after Moses and Joshua remained unconcerned with royal authority [e.g. a caliphate].  Their only concern was to establish their religion [not spread it to the nations] But Islam is under obligation to gain power over other nations (The Muqudimmah, vol. 1 pg. 473).    I believe Islam is going through what the Christian faith went through during the Reformation. During the Reformation religious leaders were forced to carefully define their doctrines, that is, what do Christians really believe? This established a baseline of orthodoxy that then could be used as a litmus test for the practices of self-professed Christians.    Islamic leaders must do the same thing. They must codify their acceptable theologies, especially the violence now part of the Sharia, Muhammads Sunna (4:24, 4:92, 8:69, 24:33, 33:21, 33:50), and the sword-verses of the Quran (e.g., 9:5, 9:29). Then Muslim leaders should defend these theologies against heretics loudly and publicly.       I have found the non-Christian religions, such as Islam, to be philosophically indefensible, being internally incoherent or undermining human reason and experience. To better understand Islam, I suggest you review the following sites:    http://www.carm.org/islam.htm  http://www.americanthinker.com/2006/04/i...|`|b2ece72e95ec61403ee2dd3a6894dc04aa	Jihadis are not terrorists.

And in Islam, you cannot force anyone to accept or convert to Islam... :Let there be no compulsion in religion"... But, nowadays as mulims are being suppressed .. people are getting a little rebellious.. hence, the hatred for west.. How can YOU justify bombing entire Afghanistan to catch a group of terrorists.. How can YOU justify killing thousands of innocentt in Iraq with your bombs to search for unexisting WMD... and in today's world is it decent to kill the leader of a country...??? And the seeds of hatred left behind by war are showing their effect (divide and rule) amongst the Iraqi population...

AA11605964	Politically, Latin America is divided into 20 independent countries and several dependent territories. Spanish is predominant and an official language in most Latin American countries with the exception of Brazil, where Portuguese prevails, and Haiti, where Haitian Creole is the dominant language.    There are several definitions of Latin America:    From a strict cultural and linguistic perspective, it would include all countries and territories in the Americas where Romance languages  Spanish, Portuguese, French, and their creoles  are spoken.   The most common view is that Latin America includes territories in the Americas where Spanish or Portuguese prevail: Mexico, most of Central America, South America and the Caribbean. The English-speaking countries of North and South America are not included in Latin America. Territories where other Romance languages such as French (e.g., Quebec in Canada) or Kreyol (e.g. Haiti, Martinique and Guadeloupe) predominate are frequently not considered to be part of Latin America from this perspective, despite the French origins of the concept. The former Dutch colonies Suriname, Netherlands Antilles and Aruba are not considered parts of Latin America, even though in the latter two, the predominantly Iberian-influenced language Papiamentu is spoken by the majority of the population. [1]   Sometimes, particularly in the United States, the term Latin America is erroneously used to refer to all of the Americas south of the U.S., including countries such as Belize, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Jamaica, Barbados and Suriname where non-Romance languages prevail[1]. Conversely, it is often used in Brazil and the Commonwealth Caribbean to designate the Spanish-speaking countries within this area, which are often known as Hispanic America.|`|cfc37c4adb4f3ec74461f347c09b84faaa	too many and their people all live in the USA.|`|AA11131811	Venezuela, Colombia, Guyana, Suriname, Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador, Peru.

NRw6BqO9aa	In Hinduism moksha is reaching the level of Mahavira, Gautama Buddha, Jesus Christ or Prophet Mohammed. Having gained kaivalya jnana... the atman within liberates forever from the cycle of birth and death. No further life to manifest... the liberated atman goes to Baikuntha (the abode of God).    The ultimate goal of life for every human being on Mother Earth is gaining moksha. Reaching the stage of moksha announces the end of cosmic life cycle for the atman within. One may travel the journey of moksha in the present life or may postpone it for any of the next manifestation is our soul prerogative... we do not know what we shall be in the next life!    Moksha can be reached by anybody after gaining kaivalya jnana... never before! When the dross within the atman removes completely... our atman reaches its old pure pristine form. This is the stage of moksha (nirvana). Every human being gets 1.1 million manifestations to reach the stage of moksha. On the earthly plane it is a journey of 12.1 million years.    Practically speaking moksha is not that easy a task. One needs to gain absolute control over the five senses and the mind, walk the path of absolute truthfulness, practice karma the Nishakama karma way, follow the path of Neti as practiced and advocated by Maharishi Ramana, practice absolute celibacy for a minimum period of 12 years and what not!    Apart from some of the ingredients on the path of moksha listed above... chanting of requisite mantras and prayers is essential. How Prarabdha karma is to be nullified is the biggest challenge of all. The mantra for nullifying the effects of path of karma is not known to anybody on Mother Earth.

In Hindu philosophy, it is seen as a transcendence of phenomenal being, of any sense of consciousness of time, space, and causation (karma). It is not seen as a soteriological goal in the same sense as in a Christian context, but signifies a dissolution of the sense of self as an egoistic personality: the undoing of conditioned mentality-materiality or nama-roopa (lit. name-form). Liberation is achieved by (and accompanied with) the complete stilling of all passions  a state of being known as Nirvana. Buddhist thought differs slightly from the Advaita Vedantist reading of liberation.    In Hinduism, liberation occurs when the individual soul (human mind/spirit) or jvatman recognizes its identity with the Ground of all being - the Source of all phenomenal existence known as Brahman. It is technically incorrect, nonetheless, to view them - both often spoken of as Self - as a monist being of sorts, something possessing substances, qualities or attributes. In actuality, Hindu scripture like the Upanishads and Bhagavad Gita, and especially the works of the non-dualistic Hindu school, Advaita Vedanta, say that the Self or Super-Soul is formless, beyond being and non-being, beyond any sense of tangibility and comprehension. Moksha is seen as a final release from one's worldly conception of self, the loosening of the shackle of experiential duality and a re-establishment in one's own fundamental nature, though the nature is seen as ineffable and beyond sensation. The actual state of salvation is seen differently depending on one's beliefs.    There are believed to be four yogas (disciplines) or margas (paths) for the attainment of Moksha. They are the ways of selfless work (Karma Yoga), of self-dissolving love (Bhakti Yoga), of absolute discernment (Jnana Yoga), and of 'royal' meditative immersion (Raja Yoga). Different schools of Hinduism place varying emphasis on one path or other, some of the most famous being the tantric and yogic practices developed in Hinduism. Today, the two major schools of thought are Advaita Vedanta and Bhakti branches.    In Buddhism, the concept of liberation, Nirvana, is slightly different from Jainism and Hinduism. It occurs when the self is extinguished from the cycle of rebirth. (In Hinduism too, the cycle of rebirth ends on liberation.)    See also: Nirvana    In Aldous Huxley's novel Island, moksha medicine is a type of mental stimulant which the residents of the island of Pala reach a state of temporary nirvana, which the users recognize as illusionary.    In Jainism, Moksha and Nirvana are the same. When a soul (atman) achieves Nirvana, it is released from the cycle of births and deaths, and achieves its pure self. It then becomes a Siddha (literally one who has accomplished his ultimate objective)    In Jainism, attaining Moksha requires annihilation of all karmas, good and bad; because if karma is left, it must bear fruit.    In Surat Shabda Yoga beliefs, attaining Self-Realization and above results in Jivan Moksha/Mukti (liberation/release from the cycle of karma and reincarnation while in the physical body  spiritual freedom here and now).|`|b50fce3ac599309a58d2842ad3345e46aa	a state of being known as nirvana    Moksha (Sanskrit: ?????, liberation) or Mukti (Sanskrit: ??????, release) refers, in Indian religions (Hinduism and Buddhism), to liberation from the cycle of death and rebirth and all the suffering and limitation entailed in embodied worldly existence. In higher Hindu philosophy, it is seen as a transcendence of phenomenal being, of any sense of consciousness of time, space, and causation (karma). It is not seen as a soteriological goal in the same sense as in a Christian context, but signifies rather a dissolution of the sense of self as an egoistic personality  the undoing of conditioned mentality-materiality or nama-roopa (lit. name-form).

You will still live in the same world but your approach about the world  will be different. You will live as you done before but you do not attach yourself with this world. You know that this world is not permanent.

xnHnhmy1aa	Not an easy question you've got here, since it kinda depend on where you're from. Myself, I just finished my B.A. in Translation here in Canada, where I was taught all the tricks of the trade (I wish!). It was a three-year, full time program (in other provinces than mine, it's a four-year program... but that's another story, lol). Canada is an officially bilingual country, English and French, so these are the main languages we study to become professional translators.    Here is a basic rule: you usually translate from a foreign language (that you understand perfectly well) to your own mother tongue (L1). The end product on your side is always in your L1, because only then can you really write like a native speaker (eg. myself, a native French speaker, I translate from English to French).    So here's what I suggest:  1. Are your language skills in Bulgarian excellent? No grammar or spelling mistakes or almost none? You have a rich vocabulary? Yes? Ok, next step --  2. How good are you in the foreign language(s) of your choice? Pretty good? Excellent? You understand all the subtleties of the language? The humour? The double meanings? A degree in French or English literature could help you get a better, more in depth understanding of the language and the culture. And then, last step --  3. Now that you've got at least two languages to work with, get started with your translation degree! You will learn techniques, common mistakes and how to avoid them, how to use the tools of the trade, terminology, etc. Pretty useful stuff, trust me.    Now, as for finding the right university... again, being Canadian, I can't really help you if you're looking for a Bulgarian university.    All in all, the best of luck, I hope you'll find what best suits you. I love my job and hope you'll be able to work in this great field.|`|78ed795ac33b45c6b8c7342244a3cc28aa	I can see why this has gone unanswered, it's a difficult question.

Islam stresses this act of worship and sternly warns against neglecting it. Prayer is the central pillar of faith. It is the key to Paradise and the first thing to be accounted for on the Day of Judgment. It is also the first of the religious obligations brought by the Prophets after faith in Allah. Allah says, addressing Moses (peace be upon him):   Verily I am Allah. There is no god but Me, so worship Me and establish prayer to celebrate My praises.   Allah relates to us the supplication of Abraham (peace be upon him) as follows:   My Lord, have me and my descendants establish prayer. My Lord, accept my supplication.   Likewise, Ishmael (peace be upon him) used to order his family to pray. Allah says:   He used to order his family to pray and pay Zakah, and he was pleasing to his Lord.   The Messiah (peace be upon him) mentioned prayer when he was in the cradle. Allah relates to us his words:   And He enjoined prayer and Zakah (alms) upon me as long as I live.   Some benefits of prayer:     1. It enriches the soul and fulfills its yearning to connect with its Lord. This gives the soul peace and contentment.     2. It purifies the heart from the effects of indolence and sin by providing a continuous opportunity for communication with Allah and for repentance. The Messenger (peace be upon him) indicated this when he said to his Companions: Consider if one of you had a river by his door in which he bathed five times a day. Would any filth remain on him? They responded in the negative. He said: Likewise, Allah wipes away sins with the five daily prayers.     This stresses the meaning of Allahs words:   Verily prayer forbids licentiousness and wrongdoing. And the remembrance of Allah is the greatest thing.   3. It emphasizes the proximity between religion and daily life. Life, from an Islamic standpoint, is to be directed to Allah. Life is an opportunity for worship and the remembrance of Allah. Praying repeatedly throughout the day, interrupting the daily activities, brings about the realization of this concept. The believer, through prayer, acquires a spiritual awareness that he takes with him throughout all of lifes endeavors.     4. It teaches a Muslim punctuality. Prayer shows how important time actually is. Allah says:   Prayer is enjoined upon the believers at prescribed times.   5. It teaches the Muslim the virtues of constancy and perseverance. Allahs Messenger (peace be upon him) said: The best of deeds with Allah are the ones performed most regularly, even if it is small.   6. It cultivates brotherhood, equality, and humility between the Muslims.|`|KrKY46Zzaa	you start with dear god    say your prayer  put in a bit about your family  confess bad things etc.    end with amen|`|be90ddde0511ed78a0e1a453d05127b5aa	I talk to God, sometimes as a child talks to his dad and sometimes as a friend.|`|xOXrMcjHaa	ACTS    A - adoration  C- confess  T- thanksgiving  S- supplication (asking for stuff... >.|`|YYbO2bEFaa	I speak to God like I would speak to a friend and i also tell him everything including secrets (even though he already knows everything).|`|bce51a80a3b5bf7503b892cabce13702aa	For the most part God just wants communication with you and to speak with a true heart, no need to find Fancy words.

When u removed your pictures he/she felt as if they'd won and they felt good about your decision because u actually listened and they felt powerful.  You have to feel good about yourself, your positive energy and self confidence will keep jerks away from u, jerks prey on people w/ low self worth/low self esteem.

061fed078f4da2ab154d01b632519d5aaa	Well, it all depends on how popular they are.  If they're like my band, and have very few fans (we're not mainstream), then they'd probably enjoy talking to you and everything.  If they're fairly popular, and have groupies, then they'd probably see it as another day at the office.    Me personally, I'd LOVE it if someone came up and said they loved our music.|`|AA10237993	Being in a band, it's not freaky at all.  It would be much more freaky if you went to all the shows and never left them alone (talking to them at all the breaks, emailing, etc.).      I would just go up to them at a break and compliment them on their music.  Something specific like "I really liked that last song", or "the mix is really good tonight" could stimulate conversation.  It's not a weird thing to do at all.  If they are smart, they will be engaging and gracious.  It's in their best interest for you to like them as people as well as musicians.  You can spread the word and bring in more fans.

aISPHpNOaa	alcohol makes you lower your inhibitions.therefore you are more likely to take the time to talk to someone and get know them. and alcohol generally just makes you feel like your having a good time. your good mood makes you think that you just love everyone. thats why guys like to by us women drinks. maybe we'll share some of that happiness with them.|`|USNNClkJaa	i'm the opposite because i find drunkenness very unattractive. you might like the way they have less inhibitions|`|oeyvyFy3aa	because your state of mind is altered|`|hce2FY9Waa	Very good question.

Even the state of mind. A person who is drunk or under the influence of alcohol becomes, more confident or the opposite, more shy or the opposite, more brave and so on. Because drinking is an occasional passion for relaxation that a person needs sometimes to have a stress free environment. And to make you more confident to say the things in your heart and mind that you can't when you're not drunk. There are chemicals or ingredients that are present in alcohol that affects a persons mind and physical state. And there are also differences on how much dosage of alcohol intake in a person...That's why you get attracted more when you're drunk because if you think a person is attractive when you're drunk, you can approach him and tell him so because you're drunk. That is also why people engage in sexual desires during or when they're in the influence of alcohol. So, don't drink too much so as not to regret anything after.

Z3hxXAeTaa	PARA responder a esta pregunta, primero hay que considerar ciertos factores bblicos. Jesucristo mismo fue el primero que fue resucitado a la plenitud de la vida, el primero resucitado a los cielos.Rev. 1:5.  Por lo tanto Jess fue el precursor de los que reciben vida en el cielo. Mientras Jess estuvo en la carne, no pudo entrar en el cielo, porque carne y sangre no pueden heredar el reino de Dios. (1 Cor. 15:50) Al entregar su carne, que dio a favor de la vida del mundo, y al ser resucitado en el espritu, el camino para los que seran invitados al reino de los cielos qued abierto.Juan 6:51; 1 Ped. 3:18.  Lo que es ms, se dice que la resurreccin de Cristo es para todos los hombres la garanta de que Dios resucitar a otros. (Hech. 17:31; 24:15) Esto no sera cierto si Dios hubiera estado resucitando y llevando al cielo a hombres justos durante todos los siglos previos.  Entonces, ?cmo hemos de entender el relato bblico acerca del profeta Elas, que dice: Mientras ellos [Elas y Eliseo] iban andando, hablando al andar, pues, ?mire! un carro de guerra de fuego y caballos de fuego, y procedieron a hacer una separacin entre los dos; y Elas fue ascendiendo a los cielos en la tempestad de viento? (2 Rey. 2:11) ?Verdaderamente fue Elas a los cielos de Dios? ?O muri?  Bueno, pues, ?qu fueron los cielos a los cuales Elas fue llevado por la tempestad de viento? Estos fueron los cielos fsicos, la atmsfera, la expansin, que tambin se llama Cielo en Gnesis 1:6-8. Una tempestad de viento solo podra existir en esta expansin atmosfrica, no en el dominio espiritual de la presencia celestial de Jehov. Elas fue transportado fuera de la vista de Eliseo por la tempestad de viento.  La Biblia no dice que Elas muri en esa ocasin. En realidad, Elas todava estaba vivo y activo como profeta por lo menos cinco a?os ms tarde, evidentemente all en el territorio de Jud. La Biblia nos dice: Al fin le lleg un escrito [a Joram, rey de Jud] de Elas el profeta. Esta carta predijo la enfermedad y muerte de Joram debido a su derrotero malo, idoltrico. (2 Cr. 21:12-15) Otra evidencia de que Elas no muri al ser llevado a los cielos es el hecho de que su siervo y sucesor Eliseo no celebr en esa ocasin el acostumbrado perodo de duelo por su amo.Compare con 2 Samuel 19:1; 1 Crnicas 7:22; 2 Crnicas 35:24.  Pedro, hablando a los judos congregados en el da del Pentecosts, poco despus de la resurreccin de Jess, se refiri al fiel rey David, un varn agradable a mi corazn [de Jehov] y dijo: De hecho David no ascendi a los cielos, sino que l mismo dice: Jehov dijo a mi Se?or: Sintate a mi diestra, hasta que coloque a tus enemigos como banquillo para tus pies. (Hech. 13:22; 2:34, 35) As es que Elas, junto con otros, estn en el sepulcro, esperando la accin del Se?or Jesucristo de poner a sus enemigos bajo sus pies al destruirlos. (Hech. 2:29) Entonces, el glorioso Cristo entronizado resucitar de entre los muertos a estos hombres fieles, y los har prncipes en toda la tierra. (Sal. 45:16; Rev. 20:11-13) Estos hombres confiables trabajarn bien con el Rey celestial para administrar rectitud y justicia en la Tierra.|`|461970eb4f14ede5cd5cc68d03f57234aa	Pues s y no    S porque bueno, Elas fue digamos que el "antecesor" a Jess, en cuanto a profetas mencionamos. Aclaro, Jess no era profeta, es el Mesas.    Y no por lo mismo, Dios ya tena ya escogido a su Hijo Amado. Recuerda el pasaje de la Transfiguracin, Jess con Moiss y Elas al subir al monte Sina, cuando lo descubrieron los apstoles Santiago, Juan y Pedro.    Eso es mi humilde opinin.    ?SALUDOS DESDE EL PABELLN DORADO DE KYOTO!|`|41fc7f1fd75de3804683f56d513c55a4aa	Tienes razn, la biblia lo corrobora  (Juan 3:13-14) 13?Adems, ningn hombre ha ascendido al cielo sino el que descendi del cielo, el Hijo del hombre.

Las puertas del cielo siempre estn abiertas aunque no lo puedas creer, lo que las "cierra" son las decisiones que tomas o dejas de tomar. El dicho es cierto, "cuando Dios cierra una puerta, tambin abre una ventana", Cuando Cristo viene al mundo es el cordero perfecto, recuerda que antes, para la redencin de pecados era necesario hacer sacrificios de sangre como el matar algn animal y en esa alma pura se limpiaban los pecados como smbolo de redencin ante Dios como usaras una toalla. Con cristo eso se acaba porque es el salvador, el que limpia totalmente los pecados, culpas, sufrimientos y dolencias en el mundo. Entonces ya no hay necesidad de ms sacrificios, porque cristo ya vino y muri por toda muerte y la venci. l vive en el cielo (Elas) junto con Cristo, el cielo te es abierto particularmente cuando recibes y concibes al espritu santo, es decir, cuando abres una relacin con dios como con un amigo que es como el aire, no lo vez pero lo sientes. Espero que sea de ayuda, observa el antiguo testamento, el cielo siempre estuvo abierto y quienes podan y pueden an en estos tiempos creer que es as, as ser, la diferencia son las decisiones que tomamos individual y colectivamente (sodoma y gomorra, el diluvio, adn y eva etc.). Comienza hoy a hablar a solas con Dios, cualquiera que creas y observars cambios. Si no resulta, es que necesitas vivir un encuentro con Dios y lo puedes hacer viviendo un encuentro o experiencia espiritual, en grupos de 4y5 paso de AA puedes hacerlo, acrcate a tu iglesia, cualquiera que sea, pregunta y te canalizarn para que vivas esto y te sean abiertos tambin los cielos, en los tiempos de Dios. Saludos y espero que sea de utilidad.|`|NvXxGY5Kaa	jajajajajajajaja|`|MCchoa0Vaa	supongo ke le exploto la bombona del gas y asi ascendio, y ascendio y ascendio y.... y bueno etc etc    ahora esta con elvis|`|lUlsG4C9aa	si estudias la biblia.que es la palabra de Dios lo entenderias.pero coje la biblia y lea en primera de reyes  capitulo 2.ahi explica todo .te recomiendo que la leas el unico libro en el mundo que hace cambiar las personas ,asi  hace  obra de ella. es muy importante te lo digo sin ofenderte y con mucho respeto.att lili moster|`|WUSgfFEBaa	Preguntas para encontrar el error.

You can have both.  Pick up the people in need.  Introduce them to the friends you already have and maybe that will help them.  God says help all.  Dont ditch the friends you have just to help others.  Help others and keep your friends!|`|AA10138787	I think love should be behind every decision a Christian makes, so I think you should continue to care and socialise and value your friends, because that is love.  If you can show love and friendship to others who might need it as well, that is great.  I think people who want to help others sometimes get out of balance and overlook friends and familly who need and deserve our love, just as others do.

This is the interwebs, where people get offended at very strange things!|`|7sEFufRbaa	it means the person blocked you from answering any of their questions.  people are really petty that way on here.

jHUzUuZRaa	I believe in God to have something or someone greater than myself to have faith in. To talk to when I am alone, to rely on in times of need, to thank in times of plenty, for courage in times of fear, for strength in times of weakness. What others believe or disbelieve is of no consequence to me. My faith is my faith, it would make no sense to other people. Therefore, I don't put other people down for their faith, nor do I very often share mine.|`|KD7yA3wVaa	we r not afraid of God we fear him as in respect him so u just got it all wrong and some Christians approach other people wrong so please reconsider what u said and if u became a Christian u would understand things better|`|Fo9ADQLBaa	Not all of us are like this.

Those people on here who resort to blocking and hitting the violation buttons just because a person who believes in Evolution more than they do in religion is justifying their answer being put. Then albeit it is their democratic right for all people to say what they like in regards to those questions put on notice for debate.    If the answer is abusive to the nature of being evil intent, swearing and racist then there may be some justification of violation.    The use of saying a person is going to Hell and is in cahoots with the devil also could be held to be a violation in a court of law. Just because that person doesn't believe in any God or the Devil could be held as slanderous in civil courts.    So Christians or what ever your personal religion might be you maybe Sinning just as much or more in-fact than the person who has put their answer in their view of atheism.

Often, people attack that which they consciously or subconsciously are afraid of..Hence the continual wars between religions over the centuries..    What many people dont realize is that what they are told repeatedly they begin to believe and that belief then becomes their *reality*, so many people*s *reality* is different and that keeps us separated and afraid of one another, just what the Creator wished us NOT to be..    So is religion for or against God, I ask myself?|`|NnFltKgsaa	Religion used to be about tolerance but now it is about reciting scripture as a weapon, My god is bigger than your god. I respect your question and your right to ask it, many have died to ensure you of that right, I am an atheist and have always questioned the existence or even the need for a higher power. To me it is a sign of weakness, to accept things based purely on faith. Your page  will be filled with people reciting their holy book but few will express a personal opinion based on life experience. .
AA11065099	I thought it was Tom Cruise at his finest, even though the movie itself lacked momentum and the voices sounded a bit muffled and difficult to hear.  He plays a real person who was a nice guy and practised real medicine.  It reflects the truth about almost everybody, and the character of the na?ve Dr. Hartford is actually easy to identify with because he lived in a sophicisticated society with his eyes wide open and yet he did not know what was really going on because of the high level of secrecy to which players on the system are kept.  I think he was being kept around in such a state to be played as a pawn in someone else's overall scheme.  The "successful" friends he encountered at the party obviously were connected with the Freemasons and the Illuminati, and the Druid-like ritual is what they all must be doing in some form, even at the lower levels.  They are really into paganlike and Druidlike religion, which seems to involve "sacrificing" people or animals, like into a fire or a hot situation.  Dr. Hartford actually becomes suspicious and becomes curious to know more.    Some of the lines were really relevant and funny.  For example, when a young woman approaches Dr. Hartford in a restaurant and tells the doctor that this time it is her keeping him alive.  The part at the party where he is asked of what significance the day is, and then, on being reminded the asker is Jewish, wishes him a 'Happy Hanukah", after which the asker breaks into derisive laughter.  I cannot remember all the details, but I thin I recall a thug at the party telling the doctor that he works in orthopedics (crushing bones).  Also, his "friends" keep buggin him about whether he studied hard at medical school or just sailed through it.  They are kind of making fun of him because he is na?ve about the big deception, what people sometimes do to the ones who are clued out.    It is not a trashy movie.  It is actually a very clever one, but it sure takes some explaining and interpretation.  As far as having so-called explicit sexual content is concerned, the only skin that I really noticed was a partial glance at an autopsy picture.  Now why would such a movie be condemned due to its "explicit scenes and graphic content"?|`|uuSj24Xxaa	It was really weird.  Siritually speaking it made me sick to my stomach.

zgL6vMCiaa	salam.  i think the ppl who we love are the ppl who hurts us all the time, bcz they mean something precious for us, a word from them can take us to the best feeling, a look from them make us shy, happy,etc.. and a bad word from them can make us cry, can hurt us..why them not others? bcz we did give them a special place in our heart what they say/do matters to us but what others do cant even touch us.  another things the ppl that we love are the most close to us, so they know more than the others our habits, our personnalities, our secrets and most important thing is that they know the point of weakness in us, so when there's a fight they  use it to hurt us so they can be relieved....but u know some ppl do it just by anger/selfishness/love to win a silly fight but that doesnt make them bad, bcz they no matter what love us and feel later guilt..but there's others who do it by hate and those arent good so we can call them close friends/lovers|`|hl6lDPvDaa	Poeple you love will hurt you the most    truly, Only my loved ones have the power to hurt me.|`|iMeh9lMbaa	people we love r the 1s who always hurt our feelings. that's life i guess. also it's pretty much easy 2 destroy than 2 built.|`|yGEROlPnaa	Because,they have no strong belief in Allah who will punishes anyone for his bad deeds.|`|LX3IqQ3Caa	Honestly You Can't Control Your Heart,  As One Of My Close Friends  Told Me Your Heart Doesn't Come  With Instructions You Can't Control  Who You Love & Whom You Don't All  You Can Do Is Follow What You Feel!

Those aren't ignorant kids.........those are adults, going out of their way to be idiots.     and THAT.............Yes, you are correct...it does make me lose faith in humanity, when you see that sort of thing.

Now that's not to say that I think I'm better than anyone else in any sense but looking at some of the questions asked, it makes me feel like there's a lot of people out there that are just lazy.     Some of the questions asked can be resolved with a quick google search. Other questions I've seen are just my opinion of people playing devil's advocate, mocking others or are simply bored. The ones I most find a problem with are the teenagers asking others to do their homework (in most cases, help is fine, but i don't condone doing it for them and thus contributing to their lack of learning anything from it) or teens asking what certain derogatory words mean or even asking about sex.    I've also found myself leaving this site rather disgusted and when I do return it's to one specific category which I've found for the most part is populated by sincerely earnest questioners.    Enough rambling. I side with you. Let's leave it at that.|`|0ylm04PWaa	I will never lose faith in humanity.  We all know there are some truly nasty people out there, but what gets thrown into that same category are those that are simply suffering, lonely, or otherwise unhappy with their lives. You have to look at it for what it really is. That way you are receptive to the people out there that want to do good because they are just giving and loving people. When you surround yourself with the thought that humanity is mostly negative it blinds you to the goodness still found in many people.

He basically was going to have to face the worse situation anyone in a human frame has ever (the load of sins and curse of the Law to be placed on Him; the physical suffering was not significant compared with that). In one account it says he was sweating blood, which apparently doctors have found can occur in extremis, when one is anticpating something most horrible. Having a human soul and emotions he was going to have experience dreadful things. His human side did not want to yield to the necesary plan of God. When he came to earth he laid aside his glory and took the form of a man, fully sharing our lot. The miracles he did whilst on earth where done by the power of the Holy Spirit available to a perfect man, rather than through divine prerogative; however John 14-16 indicates that now things are different - so we can pray to Jesus and he is able himself as well as God the Father to answer the prayer.    In other places he raised his arms to God the Father whilst standing up .. like you see in some pentecostal and charismatiic church services. Mostly it doesn't say much about body posture and only in passing without making a point of it at all. His teaching is about such matters as what you are thinking and attitudes and so on, the need for faith, God's character and so what our expectation should be and how to approach God in prayer.
BNHocZaiaa	I don't celebrate holidays designed to make greeting card companies rich.  Why not get your brother something on a non-holiday... or don't you love him then?|`|Nl64RmRWaa	Simply get him candy. Anything more is a little much.|`|yywRjouyaa	I married mine.|`|i3lXJbtFaa	I think a nice basket of cheese and wine through his car window is a thoughtful gesture to let him know you care.|`|wMunBQ9Oaa	Valentine's Day is really not a holiday to buy your BROTHER gifts.  I mean, it's okay if you're in preschool or even elementary school.  But once you're in middle school or higher, it's time to forget about buying Valentine's stuff for your brother.  People will start calling you a brother fukkker, not a mother fukkker.  Ha ha ha.   I coined a new one, didn't I?|`|iqWfufpUaa	A funny card and a gift card in a small amount  so he can buy his own kind of music.|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	boys love candy! my niece and nephew love it to no end!|`|hVEGaRMbaa	I think it would be really nice if you got him a gift certificate to that Chinese whorehouse down on 32nd St. That wouldn't make you jealous, would it?

After seeing the ignorance and intolerance spouted here, I couldn't hold that position in good conscience any longer.|`|RsnLtwyzaa	Here I think is the main motivation for my sojourn in the world of Atheism. The quote is by one Karen Armstrong author of 'A History of God': "It is wonderful not to have to cower before a vengeful deity, who threatens us with eternal damnation if we do not abide by his rules."     For me, at least, the predominant motive for unbelief was to avoid having to answer in the next life for my lack of moral restraint in this one. I knew that Christianity places human action under the shadow of divine scrutiny and accountability. So the primary motivation was more emotional than logical. The argument from logic and science was secondary and only used to legitimize the fist raising towards the heavens.    Biologist Stephen Jay Gould. "We may yearn for a higher answer--but none exists...This explanation, though superficially troubling if not terrifying, is ultimately liberating and exhilarating."|`|IBOuhyWoaa	i already was one..but it was definitely reinforced here

Without bad luck, I'd have no luck at all !|`|UujliMsCaa	Luck=Chance  Change=Randomized Events    Yes. I believe in random.    Good Luck? That would mean that chance leans in your favor. That is no longer random or chance and therefore non-existent.     No. There is no "luck" as we know it. Only chance.|`|fMth57Kuaa	well luck isn't a thing you believe in or not. When something good happens thats 'luck' it can be purely chance. Or if you believe in God and he gives you something good that can be 'luck'. My gods always make me lucky!|`|ad6XOMliaa	Yes, Sometimes It actually seems to beat skill and cunning.|`|MFKgVsoAaa	yes, but i don't think everything in the world happens because of luck. it's just one of those things that i don't disbelieve in, and it's always nice to assume that you're having good luck (:  do you?|`|BNHocZaiaa	No, but I believe in favorable random chance.|`|NnFltKgsaa	hell yeah|`|rFFYCmOGaa	You mean randomness? Sure it's called chaos theory but it's not like a belief system that one can "believe in."|`|rUgC7SPsaa	Luck is when preparation meets opportunity.|`|rcPnnfmmaa	Define luck. I believe the world is a somewhat random place. I do *not* believe in lucky rabbit's feet.|`|ROVwWPViaa	Yes I do and also that every ones lives cross paths hence effecting what choices you make in life also. Some is luck some is just blind direction to circumstances.|`|AA10472482	Luck is a false god, described in the Bible at Isaiah 65:11, NWT:    "But you men are those leaving Jehovah, those forgetting my holy mountain, those setting in order a table for the god of Good Luck and those filling up mixed wine for the god of Destiny.    Footnote: "For the god of Good Luck. Heb., laggadh; LXX, the demon; Lat., Fortunae. Compare Genesis 30:11 footnotes at this link:|`|AA10166652	No, I do not believe in "luck".....    The American Heritage Dictionary defines luck as follows:    1. The chance happening of fortunate or adverse events. 2. Good fortune or prosperity; success....to gain success or something desirable by chance.      Because we do not have the curtains drawn back to see what is taking place in heaven, we cannot always determine whether Gods active or passive will is involved in the events of our lives, but we do know that all things that take place are under the umbrella of His will, whether active or passive, and therefore nothing is a matter of mere chance.    From an earthly perspective, things may seem to happen at random, but throughout the whole of Scripture, it is clear that God is in control of all of His creation and is somehow able to take the random acts of natural law, the free will of both good and evil men, and the wicked intent of demons and combine them all to accomplish His good and perfect will (Genesis 50:20; Job chapters 1 and 42; John 9:1-7). And Christians, specifically, are given the promise that He works all things, whether seemingly good or bad, together for good to those who love Him and are called according to His purpose (Romans 8:28).    ?|`|ohUm00RYaa	Luck is real, is it a magical force, nope but it exist.  some people just get lucky.

Its ok to explode on people though. If they're being an ahole, tell them. Just dont bring their race into it, out loud at least. lol|`|52bfba7833ff67fedabdba05216f5314aa	Do you mean like when the 2 times I have been robbed it was the same race, the times that I get a door closed in front of me and it's always the same race, any number of things that have to do with manors or courtesy or being, in general, rude, it's the same race.  Is that what you are talking about?  If so, don't worry.. We are all racist to some extent. I have found that the more exposure to them the more racist I get.  It will get worse.

B5cuNTxQaa	Those two subjects are not related.    Evolution does not address creation or the origin of life, only the natural changes that occur to existing life forms.  .|`|hR7OsqtRaa	Who created Humans.? People may say The Big Bang. Then Who Created the Big Bang.? Particles ? Who created the particles ? I can keep going on and on.  Answer : Humans are not real since there is no evidence of their evolution.  Would you accept the above argument. ?  If I tell you Who Created God, then you would say Who created the one who created God and it would go on and on.  We know God is real, since we are real. If you deny God, then you have to deny your own existence, which is impossible. No matter how knowledgable or intelligent you are, you cannot deny that there has to be a supernatural force that has created our planet and our body and, that creator is God.    In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"    The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12.

In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23.

AA11212224	I'm a Christian, but there are many things I admire about Islam.  I'll name three:  1.  Their devotion to their God.  2.  The beauty of their prayers.  3.

I am half Arab, and my father and all on his side of the family are Muslim. Also, the people who work for him are like family to me--they are my Arab family. Plus, when I go to the Middle East, I am surrounded by Muslims.     One thing I admire greatly is that no one has ever looked down on me for not being Muslim. I am able to discuss religion with Muslims without them trying to convert me. They ask me honest questions about Jesus (Isa), and what He taught, and they respect Him as an important prophet, even if they don't have the same view of Him as I do. When we speak, they most often say, "Oh yes, the Prophet says something similar," and then bring up a point where Islam and Christianity agree. They don't sit around and pick Christianity apart.

According to the Qu'ran Muhammad is a prophet of God and meets with the angel Gabriel and receives revelation from him. The god Allah is supposed to be the God of Abraham.  Can any of this be true?  The God of Abraham has directed his people to test a spirit and a prophet of God to be sure they were not false prophets.  Did Muhammad test this spirit to be sure it was from God?   According to the Qu'ran Muhammad was instructed by Gabriel that if he had any doubts about this revelation he should speak with those who read previous scriptures.  This would surely mean that the scriptures from God agree with the Qu'ran at this time of Muhammad.  The Bible says they absolutely have to be in agreement with the word of God and the previous prophets of God.    Now let's see what Muhammad would have found had he had done as instructed both by God and by this unproved spirit.    Deut.13: 1 If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and giveth thee a sign or a wonder,   2 And the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them;   3 Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams: for the LORD your God proveth you, to know whether ye love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul.     A prophet of God must be in agreement with the words of the prophets and the known word of God.    1John 2: 22 Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.   23 Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: [but] he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also.   24 Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father.     1John 4:1 Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.   2 Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:   3 And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.   4 Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.   5 They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them.   6 We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.   7 Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.   8 He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.   9 In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.   10 Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.   11 Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.   12 No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.   13 Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.   14 And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.   15 Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.     Anyone who claims to be a prophet of God must agree Jesus is the Christ the Son of God who is our Savior.    2 John 1:7 For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist    Gal. 1: 8 But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.     If an angel or a man preach a different gospel he is not of God.    We can see here that the supposed imposter spirit Gabriel contrary to what he siad was not a spirit from God and the revelation he was sharing was not in agreement with the word of God.    We can also see by these scriptures Muhammad was not in agreement with the previous word of God nor the prophets and could not be a prophet of God.    Should I continue?      What would be Islam's answer to such a glaring problem?  You and I both know the answer to this question.  Islam contradicts the Qu'ran and calls the word of God corrupt.    If this were true and it is impossible you have a myriad of problems.    1) How to test a prophet or a spirit with corrupt scriptures.  Not only Muhamamd could be a prophet but so could anyone in the world simply write yourself a book and call the word of God garbage.  2)The Qu'ran itself says the word of God can't be changed and that the Qu'ran is a continuation of these previous scriptures and advises Muhammad to check with those who read previous scriptures.  Muhamamd even according to the Qu'ran could not be a prophet of God nor the Qu'ran the word of God.  3) Could Allah be the God of Abraham as he claims?  Is Allah in agreement with the righteousness of God?  From the beginning of the Torah, God warns Adam to eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil or he will surely die.  Satan, called the serpent, lies and tells Eve you will not surely die.  God does not weigh sin. The wages of sin is death from the beginning of the word of God to the end of his writte|`|pxwqB9Zyaa	At its best it was a center for learning and culture.

What a person does or 'is'  on the outside [this world]  may not reflect accurately  the heart of the individual.    It is not Christ who is condemning  people in churches, it is PEOPLE  IN CHURCHES who pass judgment.    This is where many many Christian  ministers as well as lay people go  into error thought, missing the mark,  or experience misunderstanding.  They take an awareness and turn it  into God's judgment.  And NO ONE  has that right.    An antiquated but valid phrase is:    hate the sin, love the sinner.    I rephrase it this way,   LOVE everyone regardless of their  behavior.    and I get this from Jesus:    Love God with all your heart mind soul and  strength, then go love yourself and everyone  else the same way.      So, if I apply that WHAT SOMEONE ELSE'S  LIFE CHOICES ARE is not for me to condemn  nor approve.  Each of us walks alone with God  on this planet.    I have my personal opinions about many things.    But I am a follower of Jesus, He is my Savior,  and if he is not condemning, and He is instructing  me to simply love and be love in action, then doesn't  it follow that ANYONE can be Christian - all we have  to do is invite Christ in knowing that as a human on  the planet, we misunderstand God's plan all the time,  and act out in ways that are entirely inappropriate or  'against' the Bible.  There's not a person alive today  who is perfect.    I think the Jesus' pardon of the 'adulterous' woman  about to be stoned by people who were just as  imperfect in other ways, shows clearly that we are  not to interfere with ANYONE'S relationship with  God through Christ.      Actually that's the true definition/translation of the  word blasphemy.  It's to take the Lord's name in   vain, and aren't we doing that when we condemn  someone for their behavior, whether it's listed in  Scripture or not - WE ARE TO QUIT CRUCIFYING  ONE ANOTHER.    If God wants people to be enlightened upon a certain  type of behavior I trust that God is MORE THAN  ENOUGH and is POWERFUL enough to do just   that.    So, if we'd all lean NOT on our own understanding  but instead on every word that proceeds out of the  mouth of Christ (those red letters in the new Testament)  we have little to do with being the authors of confusion....    Yes gay people, murderers, lepers, AIDS patients,  etc all can be Christian and still miss the mark  or misunderstand how that impacts their daily  planetary walk.    People need to feel safe secure and trust before  any change can trickle in - and condemnation  does not create safety security or trust.    God's big enough to condemn, I don't have that  right or luxury or privelege....    don't know about the rest of you, but  as for me and my house   we serve the Lord.    Our church does not ask your sexual preferance  nor does it address it.  Instead, we realize that  people are trying in all sorts of ways to fill holes  in souls....heretosexual marriage can sometimes  and in many cases is simply that, as well.  Now should'nt that be condemned as well???    Leave the judgment to God.    And TAKE THAT HUGE REDWOOD TREE OUT  OF YOUR EYE, before you go trying to clear  others' vision.....    those among you without sin  cast the first stone.    open hearts inviting Christ in and loving  God through Christ is all that's needed.    Some of the most incredible 'christians' in my  life that have impacted me have been devout  Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, Atheists,  Agnostics, Catholics, prisoners, liars, cheats,  etc.  I know that many cannot understand what  I am saying here, and that's ok.  It's not my  job to solve or fix anything or anyone.

We know that because of the specific word used in Leviticus that gets glossed as "abomination" in English.    That was a very technical word to the Hebrews that always had to do with idolatry.  This makes sense when you know that part of the worship of the pagan god Ashtarte was men having sex with the males priests of the temple.    In the New Testament, Paul and others use similar words.  None of them have the same meaning as the term "gay" does today.    You have a good point about hermaphrodites and other people born with vague gender qualities.  If they look female "down there," but are XY chromosomatic, they of course aren't doing anything wrong when they respond according to their own sexual feelings.    And unless those  hermaphrodites are trying to worship Canaanite idols, that scripture doesn't apply to them anyway.
BJugETlOaa	Ok I used to work at a romantic getaway and people had the ring delivered to the room alot. We had chocolate covered straberries on our menu that you could buy so this guy had this all planned out before hand. he got a small box and covered it in chocolate, we did this for him but he provided the box. then he had the box put in the middle of the strawberries and in the box was of course the ring in one of those little foam ring holders that are in ring boxes. then he had them deliver the strawberries to the room and had her answer the door. It looked so amazing! So call around and find a place that you could set something similar like this up, you caould probably do it at a resuraunt too.    Another Idea is they have those build a bear workshops you could build her a bear and have the message say "will you marry me" and her name. It is your voice so it would really surprise her. And maybe have the ring on the bear somehow, and then she will have a keepsake of how you aked her except for the ring of course.|`|fmYzcjgraa	bundle up and take her for a walk in central park. sit on a bench and propose to her...kneeling of course...as she sits down you go on one knee and propose to her...good luck...congrats|`|VDlvSMP1aa	a big screen in time square!    =)|`|vVd4pw35aa	it's very romantic and I'm sure she'll love it|`|gkqR60moaa	.... super cliche, id propose on something unique like President's Day! cuz like itll be just you two.

Many copies of the Hebrew Bible place it after the book of Psalms, and some after the Proverbs, which perhaps has given occasion to some learned men to imagine it to have been written by Isaiah or some of the later prophets. But, as the subject appears to have been much more ancient, so we have no reason to think but that the composition of the book was, and that therefore it is most fitly placed first in this collection of divine morals: also, being doctrinal, it is proper to precede and introduce the book of Psalms, which is devotional, and the book of Proverbs, which is practical; for how shall we worship or obey a God whom we know not? As to this book,  I. We are sure that it is given by inspiration of God, though we are not certain who was the penman of it. The Jews, though no friends to Job, because he was a stranger to the commonwealth of Israel, yet, as faithful conservators of the oracles of God committed to them, always retained this book in their sacred canon. The history is referred to by one apostle (Jam_5:11) and one passage (Job_5:13) is quoted by another apostle, with the usual form of quoting scripture, It is written, 1Co_3:19. It is the opinion of many of the ancients that this history was written by Moses himself in Midian, and delivered to his suffering brethren in Egypt, for their support and comfort under their burdens, and the encouragement of their hope that God would in due time deliver and enrich them, as he did this patient sufferer. Some conjecture that it was written originally in Arabic, and afterwards translated into Hebrew, for the use of the Jewish church, by Solomon (so Monsieur Jurieu) or some other inspired writer. It seems most probable to me that Elihu was the penman of it, at least of the discourses, because (Job_32:15, Job_32:16) he mingles the words of a historian with those of a disputant: but Moses perhaps wrote the first two chapters and the last, to give light to the discourses; for in them God is frequently called Jehovah, but not once in all the discourses, except Job_12:9. That name was but little known to the patriarchs before Moses, Exo_6:3. If Job wrote it himself, some of the Jewish writers themselves own him a prophet among the Gentiles; if Elihu, we find he had a spirit of prophecy which filled him with matter and constrained him, Job_32:18.  II. We are sure that it is, for the substance of it, a true history, and not a romance, though the dialogues are poetical. No doubt there was such a man as Job; the prophet Ezekiel names him with Noah and Daniel, Eze_14:14. The narrative we have here of his prosperity and piety, his strange afflictions and exemplary patience, the substance of his conferences with his friends, and God's discourse with him out of the whirlwind, with his return at length to a very prosperous condition, no doubt is exactly true, though the inspired penman is allowed the usual liberty of putting the matter of which Job and his friends discoursed into his own words.  III. We are sure that it is very ancient, though we cannot fix the precise time either when Job lived or when the book was written. So many, so evident, are its hoary hairs, the marks of its antiquity, that we have reason to think it of equal date with the book of Genesis itself, and that holy Job was contemporary with Isaac and Jacob; though not coheir with them of the promise of the earthly Canaan, yet a joint-expectant with them of the better country, that is, the heavenly. Probably he was of the posterity of Nahor, Abraham's brother, whose first-born was Uz (Gen_22:21), and in whose family religion was for some ages kept up, as appears, Gen_31:53, where God is called, not only the God of Abraham, but the God of Nahor. He lived before the age of man was shortened to seventy or eighty, as it was in Moses's time, before sacrifices were confined to one altar, before the general apostasy of the nations from the knowledge and worship of the true God, and while yet there was no other idolatry known than the worship of the sun and moon, and that punished by the Judges, Job_31:26-28. He lived while God was known by the name of God Almighty more than by the name of Jehovah; for he is called Shaddai - the Almighty, above thirty times in this book. He lived while divine knowledge was conveyed, not by writing, but by tradition; for to that appeals are here made, Job_8:8; Job_21:29; Job_15:18; Job_5:1. And we have therefore reason to think that he lived before Moses, because here is no mention at all of the deliverance of Israel out of Egypt, or the giving of the law. There is indeed one passage which might be made to allude to the drowning of Pharaoh (Job_26:12): He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through Rahab, which name Egypt is frequently called by in scripture, as Psa_87:4; Psa_89:10; Isa_51:9.

(Yes, written even before "Genesis")    Could you imagine when that was the only story that was floating around about "God and Satan"?|`|AIZvfgscaa	D:  It is all those and much more.  Here a cut and paste from some work I done on Job several years ago:-  The whole story of the Book of Job incorporates a form of psychic attack, used as a backdrop against a Test of Faith!  Some may not see it as such, but it is truly there.  To see this look at the Book of Job in the Old Testament and take special note of chapter 1, verse 8, and chapter 2, verse 9, where Satan uses Jobs wife to attack him, but note Jobs response in verse 10.   So the main lesson to be learnt from the Book of Job, is that Job was a frontiersman, a suffering pioneer for God who pointed the way for the more timid traveler to follow. Jobs faith and endurance are set down as an example to all who face adversity. Job was engaged in spiritual warfare of the most awesome kind and could have turned his back on God at any moment, as so many people do when something goes wrong. After all, it was at Gods suggestion that Satan attack Job, and not once, but twice!! And who could blame Job if he had turned his back on God, but he did not, his faith sustained him even through the subjective arguments of his friends who could not see beyond the situation, and he maintained his integrity, a key note in the Book of Job.   If an individual lets their spirit be broken by exhaustion, there is certainly no success.  But if adversity only bends an individual it creates in them a power to react that is bound in time to manifest itself.|`|GHdscZ2Haa	D) A real shame for Job's first wife and children.

If you stand on God's Promises, and covenants, keep a repetitive heart,  and Confess Jesus as your lord and Savior, nothing can stand between you and him    but if you think  that your getting into heaven by good deeds...forget it....    come Judgment day, we ALL will have to answer for all our sins....  those covered with Christs blood will be redeemed, eternal life...    those not will suffer the pit of fire and brimstone.... to burn for every sin in life they committed ... into oblivion forever.  Malachi 4: 1-end    " and on earth the saints will tread on the ashes of the emeny.   See even in God great plan, he will end the suffering of those who denied him... and thats true Mercy also....        you ever wonder just how long Satan, with all his sins will burn?  scary!|`|uFAoq4idaa	The Ten Commandments are summarized by Jesus into two greatest commandments. Love the Lord thy God is the summary of the first , second, third and fourth commandments given by God to Moses. The fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth are summarized in the second commandment which says; Love thy neighbor as thy self. if you break one of the Ten Commandments you are guilty of all. So the punishment by breaking any of the ten is a transgression of the NT commandments. For Jesus said that upon these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets. (Matthew 22:37-40) And obeying the Ten Commandments proves us to be really followers of Jesus Christ. For faith without works is dead. And Jesus also said; If you love me you will obey what I command.|`|fOfJz9OMaa	He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.

Those aren't NT commandments but ones of the OT that Jesus summed up into these two.     2. Loving someone sometimes means punishing them, but I think that branding someone is a little extreme. (But so is believing in eternally punishing someone for a one time infraction as some believe.)|`|AKFlMCToaa	Friend,    Transgression of any of the Commandments, NT or otherwise, is sin, and the Bible records that the wages of sin is death (Rom. 6:23).  That is the eventual punishment for sin that is not repented of.    In this life, however, transgression leads to certain curses in one's life (Lev. 26; Deut. 28). A person who leads a life of sin will have their share of suffering for either either by direct judgment from God or the fruit of their own doings.    Our concern should be for our own actions and our motives and our spiritual condition, not that of others.  Those who follow God are instructed to merely forgive and trust their fate to God who alone is Judge, and knows how best to deal with each individual.    Good luck.|`|Fo9ADQLBaa	~I would rather live my life as if there is a God, and die to find out  there isn't, than live my life as if there isn't, and die to find out there is.|`|X9rXRNUxaa	Romans 6:23  For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

Jesus said--whoever want to follow me  must disown themselves ,pick up their torture stake and contunally follow me...So he knew it was not going to be easy to a follower of him.     He also said that we must repay evil for evil to no one    because he came and died for we all have a chance , a chance to change ourlifestyles to become in line with what Jehovah God says.    Now we are living in the last days of this old system and the people who want a better life and  are tired of being a victem we need to continually follow christ.    Did christ kill the men that  tried to impale him? No. The time for judging is coming and it belongs to Jehovah and Jesus only not us.    So you are right if we apply love God above all else and we search for Jehovah God     You might want to show this article to your dad its about how soon this system will end and a new one will come into place by God and Jesus and he wont have to worry about his car being stolen  :)    You can beilve in a Paradise on earth  http://www.watchtower.org/e/20031115/art...|`|AA10471892	The 15 year old is not a Christian, motivated by love. So the question by your father is not relevant to Christians who have God's Spirit.    If your father believes a thief should be tatooed with a "t" on his forehead, then say to him, "if we are going to do that, then we should put a tatoo on the foreheads of a "A"  for those who have committed adultery in their hearts when they looked upon another woman or man with thoughts of lust."  Then ask him if there is any particular style of lettering he would like his "A" to look like.  Maybe then he will see what is going on. He is no better in the sight of God than the 15 year old that steals his car.      Our lives are hidden in Christ and we take on his righteousness because of his sacrifice for us.  Otherwise, we stand condemned before God, just like a common thief.
AKFlMCToaa	Friend,    Jesus did not do away with the Ten Commandments and then institute some sugary, syrupy, nebulous "law of love," where all anyone has to do is have a fuzzy feeling for each other.    In Matthew 4, Jesus said that not one jot or tittle (smallest characters) would pass from the law until all be fulfilled (the Kingdom of God on earth).      In the Greatest Commandment, Jesus was divided the 10 into two great laws.  The first four is Love toward God through obedience.  If a person truly loves God, they will worship Him in the manner He instructed by following the first four (this includes the Sabbath command, by the way).    The last six are Love toward neighbor.       The Law of God is a Law of Universal Love.      Think about it.  If a person Loves God, they will not transgress against Him.  If they Love their neighbor they will not transgress against them.    Carrying this even further, a person cannot truly love God without His Holy Spirit.  Therefore, a person cannot love their neighbor in the right manner, out of genuine concern, without first loving God.  That, my Friend is the problem with the whole world.    Jesus came to set us free with His Law of Love.  The Apostle James (his brother) called it the Law of Liberty.  The Apostle Paul said it was "holy, just and good."    Jesus, who was the author of the Bible to start with, created these laws for man's benefit, which man refuses to keep; therefore, man brings suffering and death on himself because of sin.    You will find that this Law of Love will be the basis for God's Government on Earth, the Kingdom of God, with Jesus Christ as its King.  See Isaiah 2.   Micah 4.  Jeremiah 31 and Hebrews 8.    Good luck.|`|Fo9ADQLBaa	Because God is really quite simple and yet, so complex! :D|`|c7pbvYmpaa	Simple minded authors|`|8TmK8Qklaa	Think about it, if you loved God with all your heart, soul mind and strength and then also loved everyone you come in contact with the same love you have for yourself what other law would you need?

But if you think about it, those rules are so simple and extremely easy to follow that you should do those things on an everyday basis and not even think about it.     God gave us the freedom of choice, so we can either choose to accept his Son and go to Heaven or not. We have the complete freedom to do and say what we want.|`|TkXLdosYaa	bible is corrupt and all the words in it are not the literal words of God|`|d0d7b35a707f98e4d94fb32cc3b60b5baa	Do you even have one clue ?|`|2JbCMKNAaa	Jesus came to set us Free|`|QlJBmjsraa	Christianity is not a country, therefore it does not need to set laws.|`|f821e891c77524cf69e50d2bb5629d7faa	how is loving your fellow humans a law or are you so filled with hate you want to hate everyone. and love god was also one of the 10 commandments so thats not anything new.|`|UujliMsCaa	Jesus came to fulfill the law. Fulfill means bring to its purpose. The two commands (not new) that he listed of love God and your neighbor fulfill the purpose of all the other laws.

We are freed from the penality of the Law, not from the need to obey the law.

He was just showing that those ten were all about relationships.|`|AA10471892	The new covenant law of faith is expressed through love, and love fulfills the law; all of it.  This is a result of the Holy Spirit placed within the believer; the one who believes the gospel and puts their faith/trust/hope/belief in Christ.    Laws are for the lawless; the unrighteous, and Christians are seen as righteous.  See I Timothy 1:9-10.      If you have love for others, including your enemies, then you will never do those things addressed in the old covenant law that were about doing harm to others.    .|`|NaM4ZT64aa	The real reason is that Paul wished to convert more of the pagans, do he did away with Judaic law to make his religion more attractive.|`|206820c72192d15525008e6de3c12f85aa	Because too many would spell legalism.

If you love your neighbor as much as you love yourself, you should be respecting them and treating them kindly.  Think about how you would treat yourself and then treat others that way.  As a Christian, you should always love God above all others.  That is what He expects.      I believe Jesus came to set us free.  It is our decision whether we follow what some think is His strict rule.|`|aPuj6xoHaa	All of the laws of the bible still applies to all.  But Jesus did fulfill the requirements of the law, and that is why all must believe and trust in Jesus Christ to be right with God and accept His free gift of grace.  When we turn away from sin and we believe and trust in Jesus Christ, God sees us as perfect, because He sees us through Jesus.    The first 3 commandments of the 10 commandments in Exodus 20 is fulfilled when we love God with all of our heart, soul, mind and strength.  The remaining 7 commandments are fulfilled when we love our neighbor as we love our self.  But we fail at fulfilling these commands, again that is why we so desperately need Jesus Christ.|`|f5c19a6ec11055d423269c8c414f59f1aa	Because the Jews already had the records of the old testament.  They knew the laws and then they made thousands of small laws to go with the old laws so more laws were not going to make them lawful.    Because Jesus didn't say, don't lie, it was naturally known that was not a good idea and that God didn't want them to do that.  He didn't say don't commit adultery make you believe that it was okay?  they knew the laws but they were trying to make Jesus make more laws to cover everything they did.  They were so burried under laws that they forgot how to be kind to each other.  In the world the main problem is war, violence and hate.  Maybe he was thinking if we stop those problems the others will take care of themselves.  No false religions to spur us on to war.  No one hateing their neighbor enough to kill them.  If the people who were said to be foot step followers of Christ observed those two laws and war was gone, hate was gone.
NaM4ZT64aa	Yes.    I hate fruit roll ups.    Fruit is the major staple item of my diet.

JWEZ4PMKaa	So whats the question???
0aN1xIxfaa	The account does not actually say that God suddenly invented new languages. It does say "the whole world had one language and a common speech" (Gen. 11:1) And it does say that "the Lord confused the language... so they will not understand each other." It only speaks of one language being confused so that the people would not understand each other. This event is far more subtle than we suppose.    The word 'Babel' is Akkadian in origin and means "gateway to a god". The Hebrew for 'confused' is balal and sounds like 'Babel', the Hebrew word for Babylon, and the English word 'babble'.    There's an interesting link in Psalm 55:9: "Confuse the wicked, O Lord, confound their speech, for I see violence and strife in the city." This is a prayer for God to foil the plots of the Psalmist's enemies, to paralyse the conspirators with conflicting designs. There was recently a major construction project involving several nations (some space-craft, I think) and the British contribution ruined it because they thought the measurements were imperial and not metric. It's terribly easy to confuse plans, and the more people involved, the easier it is.    You are right to flag up the apparently more immense accomplishments of humanity today, compared with building a high tower in a city. But when we consider the point to be a gateway to God, we can think more clearly. Stargate.... what was that modern fiction all about? What were the ancients up to with their amazing astrological knowledge? It's a mystery. It is not all it seems. Genesis uses astonishing economy of words to convey immense events.|`|4S5NnT7aaa	1) The Tower of Babel is mythology - At best, it's a metaphor for what happens if you challenge God    2) The Bible - and the story - were written by men.  Even if you believe that they were inspired by God, it's still a second-hand message    3) Working with people who speak one other, closely related, language is one thing. Communicating with several dozen is something else.  Clearly you haven't worked on a building site in London.|`|tdNaZ9qAaa	Do you find that in your area ,contruction and devlopers and engineers suddenly just stop all communication during a project?      No. THAT would be ridiculous.    What if an issue arrises? Then what?     Man cannot een get their act together to work on projects when they can all speak the same langauge.    Jehovah god  didnt want them to build the tower because Nimrod ( who's plan it was in the first place) was doing it in DEFIANCE to God. He brought them all in to the city which Jehovah didnt want in the first place.     And back then they would not have been able to reach heaven because they would have passed out from lack of air anyway.    God doesnt care about the space program ( aside from the fact that the fuels it sends into the water and air is polluting his world)    but with Nimrod and the tower is was the principle of the thing.     If you read more about Nimrod I think you will find it very interesting since the bible  says that he 'established himsef a mighty hunter in oppostion to God" so from the get go Nimrod was well a nimrod.      an article on languages and where they came from you find interesting    http://www.watchtower.org/e/20000808/art...|`|Ne9rXERpaa	They could no longer coordinate their efforts.

God didn't care whether or not they made a high tower - they could never have reached heaven anyway; even today we cant travel very far. The reason God caused the people to speak different languages was so that they would have to separate from each other. The people separated because what is the point of living with people whom you cannot speak to.

Because they feel they are within rights to be treated by God differently than everybody else. ]     And here is one of the better statements of the case, by a Doctor of the Church.     ===================  " But a voice came from the cloud above: "This is my Son, the Beloved. Listen to him." (Mt 17:5; Mk 9:7)  St John of the Cross said that God was more or less saying: "If I have already told you all things in my Word, my Son, and if I have no other word, what answer or revelation can I now make that would surpass this? Fasten your eyes on him alone because in him I have spoken and revealed all and in him you will discover even more than you ask for and desire  I have already spoken, answered, manifested, and revealed to you by giving him to you as a brother, companion, master, ransom, and reward ...If I spoke before [through priests and prophets in the Old Testament] it was to promise Christ ... [But if people asked God to speak to them now or ask for visions] they would offend my beloved Son deeply because they would be obliging him to become incarnate and undergo his life and death again.  You will not find anything to ask or desire of me through revelations and visions.  Behold him well, for in him you will uncover all of these already made and given, and many more  My Apostle proclaimed this in writing to the Colossians: In the Son of God are hidden all the treasures of the wisdom and knowledge of God (Col 2:3)."     St John of the Cross concludes: "Anyone wanting to get something in a supernatural way would, as it were, be accusing God of not having given us in his Son all that is required. (The Ascent of Mt Carmel, Bk 2, ch. 22.)  =======================    And that is the Christian Faith. Now you have been claiming to speak knowledgeably about that Faith and I can't accuse you of anything in that regard but I must warn readers that I almost always find some utterly incompatible statement in most of your religious posts.|`|UDXp2d8Zaa	Philippians 2:5-8  Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:     6   Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:     7 But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:     8 And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.    the verses above state that Jesus is always God.|`|9m2LvlWdaa	Pssst.

The Holy Spirit was moving in the Church of Corinth, but the women were hindering the Spirit and disturbing all by speaking out and asking questions in the middle of all of this.  Paul was simply giving instruction specifically to The Church of Corinth in regards to their particular situation.  This was also a different time when women were on a different wring of the social ladder.  Believe it or not, SOME of the Bible is, indeed, just documented history, rather than a life instruction manual.

This discovery, first proposed in 1964 by the physicist John S. Bell was first confirmed by experiment in 1972 by Professor John Clauser at Berkley. It is an almost unbelievable result - unbelievable because the logical mind has great difficulty in comprehending how it can be true. Its impact on the physics community has been enormous. Professor Henry Stapp, a physicist at Berkley and an authority on the implications of Bell's Theorem, has called it    The most important discovery in the history of science.    A description of the proof of Bell's theory, as given by Stapp reads:    "If the statistical predictions of quantum theory are true, an objective universe is incompatible with the law of local causes."    Although formidable at first glance, Bell's Theorem seems simpler once key terms are understood.    First, an "objective universe" is simply one that exists apart from our consciousness.    In 1935, Albert Einstein, together with Nathan Rosen and Boris Podolsky proposed through flawless mathematical reasoning that if the quantum theory were correct, then 'A change in the spin of one particle in a two particle system would affect its twin simultaneously, even if the two had been widely separated in the meantime'. And 'simultaneous' is a dirty word in the theory of special relativity, which forbids the transmission of any signal faster than the speed of light. Obviously, a signal telling the particle 'what to do' would have to travel faster than the speed of light if instantaneous changes were to occur between the two particles.    The dilemma into which Einstein, Rosen and Podolsky dragged the quantum theory was a profound one, coming to be known as The ERP Effect.    In 1964 Bell's Theorem emerged as a proof that Einstein's impossible proposition did in fact hold true: instantaneous changes in widely separated systems did occur.    In 1972, Clauser confirmed the statistical predictions of quantum mechanics, working with an elaborate system involving photons, calcite crystals, and photo multiplier tubes The experiment has since been run several times with the same consistent results; Bell's Theorem stands solid.    The implications of Bell's theorem are practically unthinkable.    ______________________________________...      EDIT:  Sorry, I just couldn't help myself with a little random copy-pasting.

Where people preached and proclaimed prophecies and even performed miracles in the name of Christ but were not admitted in to heaven.    What did Jesus say *would* be the deciding factor of those who got in to heaven?  Simple:    Feeding the poor  Visiting the lonely  Clothing the naked  Treating the sick    Basically caring for your fellow man as if each one were Christ himself.

As a Christian, I know that God is not like that (as to not let someone in because of that particular reason), but many questions arise from the statement. Like: is the one making the hateful statements acting according to their faith? Are they "saved" as they say they believe?     Our good works do not allow us into Heaven. Once TRULY saved, our bad ones do not release His grip either. However, one can look at the life of another and tell whether or not they truly believe in something by thier actions.     Jesus said that we would be known by our fruit. A good tree bears good fruit and a bad one bears bad fruit. Our outward expressions in everyday life are our fruit.

Acceptance of the aforementioned theme.|`|xLKPKgZXaa	I would suggest that you read it but, in a nutshell, which is what you want I believe, it starts with God creating EVERYTHING, including man, shows how man sinned and was punished and how the race of man continued to sin until there was hardly anyone on earth who believed in God.    God destroyed all of those people except for Noah and His family who replenished the earth.  Man began to sin again and God said that He would send His Son as Saviour of mankind. Some believed this and some did not (just as many didn't believe the message that Noah gave them).    Jesus DID come as Saviour and died for our sins so that those who believed Him would not be punished for their sins. He returned to Heaven after rising from the dead.    The bible ends with a revelation (vision) of what our future will be like when this life is over. For some it's good, for others it isn't.

There is a such thing as sin.  Sin is simply put, as rebellion against God..which is what Adam and Eve did when they believed the serpent, and ate of the tree that was forbidden to them.  Thus begins the Old Testament, in which God chooses the Hebrew people to represent Him, and His testimony.  It isn't just about Him leading them to a land to live in, but preparing them for the birth of His Son, who saved the world from sin through His death.  Jesus Christ is the one who born to save the world from sin.  Only through faith in Jesus, and the grace that He extends to us, can we be redeemed.  Jesus said, "I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life.  No one comes to the Father but through me".  (John 14 : 6)|`|DVuWsb2raa	The theme of the bible to me is...

There are minor discrepencies in translations, such as the number of horses King Solomon had, but it doesn't change the basic message - "God so loved this world, that He (freely) gave His (one and) only (uniquely) begotten Son, that whosoever believes in (trusts in, clings to, and relies on) Him shall NOT perish (spend eternity in hell), but have everlasting life (in heaven)."

We don't have scientific data about death because no one bothered to take a expedition and explore.    We know that we have no means of knowing life after death as a perceptual experience. But Allah has given us certain levels of consciousness that provide us with insight into realities not perceptible through the senses. The Quran speaks to our rational mind when it answers the disbelievers who ask, Who will give life to the dead bones? The answer is, of course, the One Who created them.    Allah in the Holy Quran appeals to mans reasoning and addresses his power of reflection and judgment by asking him to reflect on how rain revives the dead earth. This is something that is obvious to us; if so, how can we then deny the truth of the resurrection, when Almighty Allah can just as easily revive the dead bones as He revives the earth?

While men were sleeping, his enemy came and oversowed weeds in among the wheat, and left. When the blade sprouted and produced fruit, then the weeds appeared also. So the slaves of the householder came up and said to him, Master, did you not sow fine seed in your field? How, then, does it come to have weeds? He said to them, An enemy, a man, did this. They said to him, Do you want us, then, to go out and collect them? He said, No; that by no chance, while collecting the weeds, you uproot the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harvest; and in the harvest season I will tell the reapers, First collect the weeds and bind them in bundles to burn them up, then go to gathering the wheat into my storehouse.Matthew 13:24-30.    Jesus explained that he was the sower. The fine seed pictured his genuine disciples. His enemy was Satan the Devil. The weeds were counterfeit Christians who infiltrated the early Christian congregation. He said that he would let the wheat and the weeds grow together until the harvest, which would come at a conclusion of a system of things. (Matthew 13:37-43) What did all of this mean?    The Christian Congregation Corrupted    Soon after the death of the apostles, apostate teachers from within the congregation began to take control of it. They spoke twisted things to draw away the disciples after themselves. (Acts 20:29,?30) As a result, many Christians fell away from the faith. They were turned aside to false stories.1?Timothy 4:1-3; 2?Timothy 4:3,?4.    By the fourth century?C.E., says The New Dictionary of Theology, Catholic Christianity had become the official .?.?. religion of the Roman Empire. There was a coalescence of ecclesial and civil societya merging of Church and State that was diametrically opposed to the beliefs of the early Christians. (John 17:16; James 4:4) The same source states that in time, the whole structure and nature of the church, as well as many of its fundamental beliefs, was changed radically under the influence of a curious and thoroughly unhealthy combination of O[ld] T[estament] and neoplatonic models.

MY REPLY: Jesus is God's Son. (Luke 1:32; Psalm 83:18) He Has  a God. - Revelation 3:12. He spoke of God as someone other than himself in John 17:3.    (2) Jesus was created.   MY REPLY: Yes he was. Colossians 1:15; Revelation 3:14; compare Proverbs 8:22.    (3) Jesus was not bodily resurrected but was resurrected as a spirit being.   MY REPLY: True. That is precisely what we read in 1 Corinthians 15:44 & 45, and is indicated in Hebrews 5:7.    (4) Jesus is no longer a man.   MY REPLY: That is right; see above. Also see 1 Peter 3:18.    (5) Jesus will not return to earth literally and physically.   MY REPLY: What did Jesus say in John 14:19?    (6) The Holy Spirit is not a personality, but a force like electricity.   MY REPLY: Holy spirit is the force through which Jehovah accomplishes his purpose. Please compare the passages in Matthew 12:28 and Luke 11:20 with each other.     (7) Salvation is by grace PLUS works.   MY REPLY: This is not what we teach. Hebrews chapter 11 and James 2:14-26 makes it clear that the works involved are those we are motivated to do because of FAITH. Faith without works is dead, but it is not the works that save us, it is the faith that moves us to action. However, if we do not act on what we believe, can we really say we have faith? Also please note Matthew 7:21-23 and Hebrews 5:9. We must do the will of God in faithful obedience.    (8) The dead are asleep in the graves and are not in Heaven or Hell.   MY REPLY: Hell is the common grave of mankind, from which all will be raised. (Revelation 20:13, 14) The unrepentant wicked will be destroyed, not tortured forever. - 2 Thessalonians 1:9; Psalm 37:38.    (9) Satan and the wicked will not suffer eternal torment, but will be burned up in the lake of fire.   MY REPLY: Revelation 20:10 tells us Satan is to be cast into the lake of fire. (Please note it says the wild beast and false prophet were already there. Read the rest of Revelation and it is clearly seen that these are symbolic, not literal creatures, so cannot be tortured alive forever or for any length of time.) Verse 15 shows the wicked are to be thrown into this same lake. My response to (8) above shows the wicked are to be destroyed, and this passage merely confirms that fact. In addition to Satan (a spirit being) and the wid beast & false prophet (symbols) note also that death (a condition) and hell (a location) are to be cast into said fire. How can these things be tortured??? Whatever the end of one of these things is the end of them all. We have already seen the wicked will be destroyed. Death also is to be destroyed, according to 1 Corinthians 15:26. Therefore, the lake of fire means eternal destruction.    (10) The Jehovah's Witnesses are the only true Christians. MY REPLY: Actions speak louder than words. - Matthew 7:16-20; 28:19, 20, John 13:34, 35 & 15:12, 13.    (11) Only a few Christians will ever go to Heaven.   MY REPLY: Luke 11:32 calls them a "little flock." They will be kings and priests over the earth.- Revelation 5:9, 10. Over what are they to rule? The meek ones who will live forever on the earth. - Matthew 5:5; Psalm 37:9-11, 29; Proverbs 2:21, 22.    (12) After death some will have a second chance for salvation.   MY REPLY: No; rather some who never had a chance will have a chance. This may include some who heard the good news but did not grasp it. (Isaiah 26:9, 10; Acts 24:15; Revelation 20:12, 13)    (13) Christians should not serve or honor governments.  MY REPLY: We do not teach this; we teach obedience to human governments UNLESS to obey requires disobedience to God. - Romans 13:1-7; compare Acts 5:29.    Perhaps you should base your beliefs on the Bible rather than accusing us of the opposite!|`|P6atY3xXaa	Christendom is the term mainline religion uses for itself.  It is often found in the dedication part of their Bible versions esp. Roman Catholic ones.  It is an older term now though.  Once Protestant reform got really big and with the separation of church and state, Christendom stopped being used so much as a term.    Christendom is a blend of Christian and Kingdom and referred to the political/national realm occupied by leaders and practicers of mainline religions.    JWs DO regard themselves as Christian, but we are not part of mainline churches nor the politics they meddle with and control.    Debbie|`|WHi6h06Haa	I'm not a Jehovah Witness, but JW's are not Christians. Why?

Jehovah's Witnesses have always retained their political neutrality. Thus, Witnesses are not part of Christendom as the word has historically connoted.    http://www.reference.com/search?q=christ...  [quote]  Christendom as a polity  The term Christendom has been used to refer to the medieval and renaissance notion of the Christian world as a sort of social and political polity. In essence, the vision of Christendom is a vision of a Christian theocracy, a government devoted to the enforcement of Christian values, and whose institutions suffused with Christian doctrine. In this vision, members of the Christian clergy wield plenty of political clout. The specific relationship between the political leaders and the clergy can vary but, in theory, national or political divisions are subsumed under the leadership of a church institution.  [unquote]    "Christendom"...Those parts of the world where most of the inhabitants profess the Christian faith.Websters New World Dictionary.  .. ..(John 15:19) If you [true Christians] were part of the world, the world would be fond of what is its own. Now because you are no part of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, on this account the world hates you.      Jehovah's Witnesses use the term Christendom in reference to professed Christianity, in contrast with the Christianity of the Bible.|`|qyoXSdPCaa	I would ask how could they even be considered as Christian in the first place?

Z6TNsJluaa	There is a show that comes on local Christian radio who host a Lawyer (Jay Seckulow), who discusses the rights of Christians in the work place, schools and in the government.. You don't have to be placed as a black sheep just because you are a Christian. Know your rights and be free to live by them daily. You will have many who will be offended and will do all manner of evil against you, but know it is a sign of the times and our redemption draws near..|`|pahrtdsgaa	I think companys can take policies too far in an attempt to shield themeselves from lawsuits and stuff. as for your calendar if there was a place at your desk that other people couldn't see that would be better|`|zVSeLpCvaa	Thats stupid! i wouldnt get offended by anything anyone had unlsess it was directed towards me or somthing, but yeah Freedom of religion and everything, i think thats way to extreme espeacialy if you do practice what ever you do, because you have rights!!!!!|`|73n1SExgaa	Yes i think its extreme. and i would look for another job if i was you. It is against you rights. If your a christian how are you to witness if you are controlled by you company. Having a calender with scripture is not a big deal. By doing what your Company says offends you too  are you willing to be offended by others.  This offending thing is one sided. It is the beginning of the christians persecution. It is a time that we have to examine ourselves are we truly christians in love with Christ so much that we will accept persecution Be strong in the Lord|`|AA10873763	If it is only visible to co-workers and not clients or customers, I think you should be able to display on your desk or wear on your person whatever religious symbols you choose.  I can understand why a company wouldn't want someone who is in contact with customers to wear or display religious items, though, as they don't want to risk alienating their customers.|`|wtg8vtzBaa	I'm atheist and I don't mind if someone has a scripture calendar at their desk.  I'd just be offended if they left the scripture pages on my desk as a hint, haha!|`|47sALOGfaa	I would not be offended by your calendar.    I would not be offended by your wearing, for example, a cross necklace.  Then again, I'd just be looking at your ti ts, but that's a different story.|`|C1SOqQSkaa	If everyone would agree not to be 'offended' by such things, it would probably be OK. But they don't. Would you be cool with your workmates if they all started wearing inverted crosses or worshipping Satan?    EDIT:    There's another factor. At work you represent your company. What would happen if an important customer who was a devout Muslim saw your calendar and concluded that your company was fundamentalist Christian?|`|FpMS47sXaa	The calender should be left, as is. If people are offended, they can look away. You are not forcing anything onto them.    As far as the religious clothing or necklaces - that is illegal. I can see like no religious t-shirts or something, but not jewelry. You can take this to the ACLU if you need to. They are infringing on your own person rights to religious expression. It does not matter the religion.|`|gDVQNMR7aa	I think things that are on your desk are yours. They are personal and, providing they are not hazardous to people's well-being, they should be accepted as your personal property (meaning others should have the decency to respect you/them).    Yes, I think any company which actually tells its employees that NO religious jewelry is acceptable is ignoring the Constitution. If you aren't forcing someone to follow your belief system you aren't doing anything wrong. I've seen plenty of women wearing rather ugly jewelry at work and no-one has told them to take it off, even though it could be considered "offensive".|`|7sEFufRbaa	Freedom of religion, period.|`|hXQnR2Scaa	I think a desk calendar and tasteful religious jewelry should be just fine.

I don't think that the calendar's really a big deal, as long as it's subtle.    2. I think that's going to far. It should be subtle and tasteful, not big and gawdy or a big T-Shirt that says "I heart Jesus" or "The Goddess Loves You". I'm Catholic and I wear a Miraculous Medallion or a St. Christopher Medal at work often. But they are very small medals made of white gold. Nothing over the top. No one's ever had a problem with it.    Wearing a cross or having a calendar with scriptures at your desk is not forcing your beliefs on others as long as you don't try to engage people in conversation about it. People who get offended by crosses or Stars of David are thin-skinned in my opinion.|`|300aa90c6e4459736882fabd827b612faa	I'm an atheist and even I could care less if someone wore religious things or had a calender on their desk.

I wouldn't be offended by your desk calendar as long as you didn't try to preach your scriptures to ME.  Unless your co-worker somehow MUST see that calendar as a part of his/her daily job (which seems unlikely), being offended is THEIR problem.  They can choose not to read the scriptures, or to have anything to do with your calendar; it's your personal property, and not part of your job or theirs.    At MY employer, our Values say that we're not allowed to condemn anyone because of race, gender, religion, lifestyle, ethnicity, etc.  Those are things that I would think any reasonable adult would refrain from doing in the workplace regardless.  I'm Jewish, and wear a Star of David on occasion, and nobody has ever said a word to me.|`|P6atY3xXaa	I think they are going too far.  Your desk should be your desk.  If you have space for personal items; photos of famiy and a personal calendar should not matter whether it is scriptures, Dilbert, or Maxine or whoever.    Debbie

But if you read the bible spiritually it says the opposite of what it does literally.    In other words to love our neighbor and every human is our neighbor.    Spiritually the bible is a book explaining the path to perfect love - encrypted in an evil book if read literally. That's why religious people who take the bible literally (fundamentalist Christians for example) are always so unloving and full of pride.     The place that comes closest to exemplifiying the spiritual meaning of love when the bible is interpreted spiritually is Disneyland.

Is this teaching logical and Scriptural? The human life span is limited to 70 or 80 years. Even if someone was guilty of extreme wickedness all his life, would everlasting torment be a just punishment? No. It would be grossly unjust to torment a man forever for the sins that he committed in a short lifetime.  Only God can reveal what happens after people die, and he has done so in his written Word, the Bible. This is what the Bible says: As the [beast] dies, so the [man] dies; and they all have but one spirit .?.?. All are going to one place. They have all come to be from the dust, and they are all returning to the dust. (Ecclesiastes 3:19,?20) There is no mention here of a fiery hell. Humans return to dustto nonexistencewhen they die.  In order to be tormented, a person has to be conscious. Are the dead conscious? Once again, the Bible gives the answer: The living are conscious that they will die; but as for the dead, they are conscious of nothing at all, neither do they anymore have wages, because the remembrance of them has been forgotten. (Ecclesiastes 9:5) It is impossible for the dead, who are conscious of nothing at all, to experience agony anywhere.|`|rTplTuEdaa	YES  HEAVEN AND HELL ARE VERY REAL ,AND SO IS GOD    AND HIS SON JESUS,IF YOU KNEW THEM YOU WOULD    NOT BE ASKING THIS QUEDTION.|`|blbd7e1Qaa	Hell is actually suicide bombers heaven (the only place where to have sex after death, is hell...)

We have all broken God's Laws (we have told lies, we have been envious, and greedy, and jealous and selfish; we have disobeyed parents and other authorities, etc, etc, etc).    BUT God MUST judge all sin.  If God did NOT judge sin, then heaven would quickly become as corrupt as earth, and infinitely more so.    Believing in a fake god won't help you, because only Jesus can forgive us and set set us free from the sins that would otherwise drag us, kicking and screaming into hell.    False and fake gods just simply can not do that; only Jesus can, because having never sinned, He actually became sin FOR us, trading places with us and taking our place, and He took upon Himself the punishment for OUR sins.  But because He was not at all guilty, death could not hold Him.  As a result, He conquored death, hell and the grave, when He resurrected Himself the morning of the third day, just as He said He would, proving once and for all time that He truly is who He claimed to be, the very Son of God!    Now, with this in mind, since Jesus is the ONLY one who has ever actually conquored sin and death, He is therefore the only one who can set us free from our sins and their eternal consequences.    Following ANY one else will NOT set us free from our sins, and if we do NOT allow Jesus to set us free from our sins, then those very same sins which WE held on to in THIS life, will hold on to US in the NEXT life, and when God judges those sins, they will (as I said already) drag us, kicking and screaming into hell!    False gods can not rescue us.  False gods can not set us free.  False gods can not forgive us.  False gods can not reconcile us back to God and bring us back into right standing with God our Creator.  False gods can not get us into heaven.|`|sgHvnxe2aa	Because NONE of them can save your eternal soul......and it is the lie of satan, who is jealous of and hates God, who is doing all in his power  to keep people from salvation through the precious blood of the Lamb,   Jesus Christ, who died for us all on the cross to pay for our sins and make us acceptable to God....

Jesus saith unto him, "I am the way and the truth and the life; no man commeth to the Father but by me."    On the day of judgment, Jesus Christ will either be your accuser, or will be your advocate/defense in God's courtroom.    "And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous" 1 John 2:1 (KJB)    That means if you are born again of the Holy Spirit of God only.    An advocate is a defense or a lawyer.    The Bible says that "Except a man be born again he cannot SEE the kingdom of God."

Actually I would prefer "compulsion" to "fear", but that's the best option you gave me.    Where I suspect you are going with this is the whole "Atheists are morally superior because when we do good deeds it's not because some fictional Deity told us to, we do them because we are genuinely good people and morally superior beings" thing.    That is a fatally flawed argument, because morality is like exercise, it doesn't count if it doesn't hurt.    Every January millions of Americans join gyms, resolve to loose weight, and spend tons of money on Jenny Craig, Slim-fast, and gym memberships. Many of these people even sign up for pseudo "boot camps" which claim to be based on military, or even elite military training styles. Almost none of them actually loose the weight, or keep off what they do loose in the first couple of weeks. (  My local gym is always quite crowded from Jan 1 to about Valentines Day...and it is back to normal by mid March. )      On the other hand every year thousands of young Americans get into fantastic physical shape at places like Quantico Virginia and Fort Knox Kentucky by going to the REAL boot camp.    What is the difference? Well when you are in REAL boot camp you exercise even when you don't want to. You get up and run even when you would rather not run. You are under a compulsion... a fear if you will...(trust me I've been there, done that...Fort Knox Ky, summer 1987).     Because you exercise even when you don't want to, even when it isn't comfortable, even when it hurts... you actually grow.  For any organisim, if you want to see growth, you have to exceed your current comfort level and capabilities.     Same applies to doing good deeds.     Someone who isn't under any sort of compulsion may occasionally do something. They may send $5 or $25 to the telethon, or occasionally give blood, or buy girl scout cookes when someone comes to their door. They may even give money on occasion to a pan handler. But this will always be a function of their DISCRETIONARY spending. It will only happen when it is COMFORTABLE to do it. There won't ever be any actual sacrifice involved, because they won't be compelled to sacrifice. Without being "pushed" their charitable efforts won't ever leave their comfort zone.  It is the moral and charitable equivelent of signing up for the YMCA "boot camp" and then dropping out after a week.     On the other hand someone that is compelled by their faith into doing good deeds WILL (to use the phrase) "give till it hurts".  They will do more, and as a result of this they will grow; morally and spiritually. They will sacrifice, and will learn self discipline from it. They will give more of what they have than someone who is NOT challenged or compelled to do good.  Both in relative and most likely absolute terms, they will do more good for more people.... and more importantly they will grow more and become better people themselves...than someone who just does good deeds when and if they genuinely feel like it.     Statistics validate this theory...  http://www.realclearpolitics.com/article...  (although the divide there was political, religion and politics have a VERY high correlation, according to the Pew Center and others )    But I can also tell you that my personal experience validates it as well. Lately my family has been increasing our charitable giving, not because we can afford it (my industry is contracting and I doubt I will pass through 2009 without at least some period of unemployment) but because we, as Christians, feel compelled to give right now. People are hurting, and we, as Christians, have the job of helping them. I've given more lately, even though I've been more reluctant to do so, because I felt that I had to.    So A is definitely the correct answer.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	C    why the quiz?  even little old ladies can pray and noone but God sees so dont try to judge others.

In the most simple terms the idea is that time as we know it began with the Big Bang. But the Big Bang itself which birthed the universe was born out of another greater dimension of pure randomness from which all universes (there are supposed to be others like our own) are born.

The 12 Apostles were not elected, they were chosen by Christ.  When an Apostle was selected to replace Judas, it was not done by a vote of the other 11 Apostles.    Doctrine is not up for popular vote as it is in some other churches.  if something is fundamentally evil, it does not become acceptable just because it has been accepted by the general population.    The Catholic Church has been around for nearly 2000 years.  The Catholic Church will survive because Jesus sent the Holy Spirit to protect and guide the Church.|`|fA3fhfPSaa	The Catholic Church is not an affirmative action organization. It is a religion.    You can't have everybody choosing the pope. It's not the peoples' decision. It is God's decision.

This should absolutely never be done.|`|f7fcb6877caa0ad4f41dd9af2258ee0aaa	The Pope is not "elected".

Registration and voting of over one billion Catholics worldwide would be a nightmare.    It would not matter anyway. It is really the Holy Spirit who selects the Pope.    A Papal Conclave works like this:    ? A pope dies and is buried    ? The cardinals come to Rome for the conclave that will elect the new pope. The word conclave (Latin, *** ? clavis, literally, "locked with the key") designates:  .     ? The place in a locked section of the Vatican where the cardinals under the age of eighty elect a new pope.  .     ? The actual gathering of the cardinals.    ? The conclave begins 15 to 20 days after the pope's death.     ? The cardinals pray for the guidance of the Holy Spirit during a Mass    ? The cardinals, sealed in the Sistine Chapel, vote every morning and afternoon.     ? A two-thirds majority plus one is required for election for the first 30 ballots. After that, a simple majority is required.    ? After each vote, they burn the ballots and add special chemicals to make the smoke white or black.   .     ? Black smoke means no new pope yet.   .     ? White smoke announces the election of a new pope.     ? The cardinals may elect any baptized male they wish. There have been occasions in the past where they have elected a layman. After their election, the layman has to be ordained priest and bishop.     ? They ask the one elected if he accepts. The moment he accepts, he is pope.     ? The pope chooses his Papal name.     ? Then the new pope is announced to the world.

When it comes down to it the Pope is elective through the Conclave of men of God. There can be no Pope elected if God is not involved and with these men working to elect the Pope we know it was done with the Holy Trinity as the Center and that they were guided by the Holy Ghost.    Democratic voting would make it more like a campaign and an election, when really it is an appointment to a position of leading the church of Christ. An appointment made by God through His men.

In the US, we are a country that was founded specifically on the right to have freedom of religion.  Christianity legislating their beliefs is NOT freedom of religion because there are some religion represented here that support it, EVEN some Christian demoninations.  No one is asking the church to recognize, accept, or marry same sex couples.  They just want access to the SAME legal rights.    Many people are under the misconceptions that same sex civil unions give the same rights as marriage and that the lgbt community has made this into a fight about a word.  Its not.  The major rights we are fighting for are actually specifically denied by federal law.  In the US, no matter what state, no matter what title your relationship has, same sex spouses are NEVER considered the legal next of kin, same sex spouses can NEVER have legal joint parenting and several other major federal rights.  This is based on the Federal Defense of Marriage Act of 1996, put in place by Clinton, expected to be over turned by Obama.  Many states have their own versions of the DOMA laws, which we are fighting to have repealed so that same sex couples can have the same LEGAL rights as the next person couple.|`|sgRJRuvgaa	Same as any other gay person I'm for it but not just for selfish reasons like many straight people think but because I think two people who want to live together and be married they should have that right.

There is a regilous view (mostly) that states marriage is between man and a woman.  They cling to this view, however forget the parts of not having more that one wife, and if your divorced you do.  They also forget the Bible says the man is the head of the household.    I'm not trying to make anyone mad just pointing out that we have always picked what we want to make a stand on, and I don't think this is one we should care about.      If they want to be married then let them.  Is this right or wrong in the eyes of God, I don't think so but then again that is a descision for God not for me.

I can't say if it's a sin or not, but just think about why humans are here and what happens when we die, and you will either believe that there was some sort of accident and that this is all chance with no purpose, or you will beileve that there is a creator and he has a purpose for each one of us.

The reason most people are so adamant about their position on the existence of God is because they have made up there mind and believe they know all there is to know on the subject.  Truth of the matter is, there are many who are ignorant on both sides of the argument.  You can't possibly know EVERYTHING in this lifetime.

I am pretty darned sure that most Christians admit to at least a little bit of doubt.    Many agnostics classify themselves ad "agnostic theists" or "agnostic atheists", so you could be an "agnostic theist" believing in the Christian God and Jesus but not admitting complete faith.    I think that if there is a God, they would not be upset by your questioning and would actually probably approve of the fact that you can question as you look at the world around you. You don't need to follow your religion perfectly, do what feels right to you. At least you are honest about it, many would just continue to claim they are "perfect Christians", or wouldn't even realize they weren't following things right.|`|qzVGaVWgaa	instead why don't you avoid religion but discover spirituality.  the forces that occur within this world and beyond it are too complex and extraordinary to not believe in an intelligence, god, whatever word you call it.  religion confuses you with the word god attaching this force to more of a humanly person.  i think retiring to a label such as agnostic is unnecessary when there is so much to explore and learn and so many different views about life and our spirit.  instead of being torn between if there is or isn't, put that energy towards being curious, and learn.  ignorance is your only enemy.  all i know is being spiritual gives life for yourself a whole new meaning and fullness.  in times of struggle or confusion it makes you more comfortable and feel less alone, and in times of joy it makes you more grateful more appreciative|`|VrjF986Aaa	lol I like when Atheists say that an Agnostic person is an Atheist who is too cowardly to admit it.... you do know Christians say the same thing about you guys right?   Personally, I don't believe in the idea of sin, other than as another word for right and wrong. I wouldn't consider questioning some entities existence if there is no proof for it to be wrong. Go with your gut.|`|gQqO1sPxaa	I'm no christian so i wouldn't be able to tell you for sure, but what I am is Agnostic. I've never heard of it being a sin before, and really it shouldn't be because you are not claiming that your belief is that there is no God, you're only stating that you are uncertain as to what to believe in. In other words, you have no general religion, you respect other religions but you are unsure as to where your feelings and views fit in the scheme of things. I wouldn't worry too much about upsetting God (if there is one,) He is said to be a loving and forgiving God and in today's society, you have a right to question anything or anyone's existence. Its your freedom of speech and opinion, and if you are unsure as of yet as to what you believe in, than that's okay. As long as you do good things, and live life like a good person as you said, God (if there is one,) will surely not mind too much if you have a few uncertainties. Besides, it is not your religion or beliefs that define if you are a good person or not, it is how you live your life and how you treat others, that are the indications of your good heart. Hope this helps!|`|lh8Tn02Naa	If you're not sure there's a God, you canot in all consistency be sure that he will punish you for not believing in him.  Your concern that he might do suggests you're not much of an agnostic yet.    Frankly, you are well rid of the sort of God in whom you aren't sure whether to believe in or not.  If I thought that my God would ever dream of burning ANYONE in hell for any reason whatever, I would refuse to believe in him on principle, whether he exists or not.  Sending people to hell is what demons do.      "Having doubts" is a vital part of exploring what you believe.  What do you think your brain is for?    Give me a good person in preference to someone who SAYS they believe in God any day, if I had to choose.  It's obvious that the world needs as many good people as it can get.  It's far from obvious it needs any more theists.  The God I believe in, more or less - though I have plenty of doubts too - understands this perfectly well.|`|Qr3U4Iosaa	Do you fear "sin" because of punishment from a "higher power" or do you fear sinning because you have a set of morals and values that come from within and have nothing to do with a mystical set of rules.     If you answered YES to the latter, then congrats, you've realized that you don't need to live your life like a test for a set of rewards that may not be there when you pass on.     Ask yourself, if you only believe in God only because you fear Hell, then what is the point of belief?     Also, what if you believe in the WRONG God? I mean, isn't it just as likely that Zeus or Vishnu or Thor is running the show? You probably don't believe in those gods, which makes you an atheist for most of the gods and religions that have ever existed.|`|JzaHiMIwaa	No, its is not a sin to be agnostic. Your not a sinner for being born, either.    Many people question their faith, and decide to leave it. Its not a bad thing, if anything, its good. Your opening your mind.

I did Research, asked questions, read the bible, and discovered all the holes Christianity (as well as other organized religions) posesses. What i suggest you do is to do research and ask questions, as well as look into the history/beliefs of other religions, then make a logical decision having a wider arange of knowlage on the whole topic of religion.     People don't need to rely on a 3,000 year old book for moral values. The moral values described in the bible involve things like stoning disobidient children, stoning homosexuals, stoning adulterers/rapists, stoning rape victims, stoning those who work on the sabbath (which includes things such as lighting a fire, picking up firewood, tieing a knot etc), slavery, and many more (and it wasn't just society that pushed these things, according to the bible god instructed them).      And about burning in hell....just think about it....If there was an "all loving, all forgiving, all knowing, all powerful" god, would there really be a hell in the first place? Why would there be bad in the world? Why would evil even exist, can't the "all powerful" god just poof it away? Whats the crime in questioning something with little to no evidence? If one day your child told you they didn't love you, would you find it morally right to lock them in the basement and torture them every waking moment until they die, let alone all eternity?     If you answered NO to the last question, then congratulations, your more moral then god. If believing in the wrong god or not believing in one at all is punishable by hell....then there are currently upwards of 4.5 billion people destined for an eternity of torturing, suffering, and damnation. Just think about it. Good luck with your decision|`|I3yU4XvLaa	If there is a God and he burns people for honesty- do you want to follow him?
Uj9cLwbpaa	Nope.
ttTDiJWfaa	Great question!  I can SO answer this!    Because many freethinkers have already been through the religion mill and, after a lot of consideration, are using a More realistic approach to philosophy to enrich our lives.    It's not everyone, but some of the answers from religious apologists sound downright mean. I'm like "If god is love why all the hate?"    Some of us can do better, and we will.|`|WxNvO4t5aa	I don't want to say I am a spiritual free thinker, for fear of what connotations and preconceived notions you associate with that, but I am definitely not a fan of organized religion.  Organized religion spreads fear and devastation, faith in Jesus Christ creates a loving and nurturing atmosphere.      I don't get mad when people trash God or Jesus, because I expect it to happen.  I don't stand on a street corner screaming hell-fire and brimstone because that's not what Christianity is about.  There is no fear of God from Christians, there is reverence, there is love.  Generally speaking, the most bitter people on the planet are the ones either involved with organized religion, or the ones vehemently opposed to one/all religions.|`|JKKpwmBFaa	Organized religions revolve around inflexible dogmas that make it impossible for those who follow them to completely get along with certain people. The more spiritual people are more open-minded and see validity in other people's beliefs even if they seem strange.|`|FpMS47sXaa	I can only answer for myself, in this regard.    While I hold fast to my own faith and religion, I'm not stupid. I know that there are many things that organized religions base themselves upon that is simply (and provable) to be incorrect. All one really has to do is read the texts, itself.    IF the text is full of contridictions and mistranslations, how can one be excpeted to follow without giving up complete mental control and common sense? One can not. So, in one sense, those that do do this, are simply failing to be active in the religion. These people sit on the sidelines, never wanting to take a stand or rock the boat. To me, that is showing that you lack your own convictions.    Even Jesus, himself, challenged the then organized religion. He showed us, by his example, that we are to not blindly take what people tell us, but to question everything to have the understanding of just what it is we believe - and to acheive the enlightenment in this life that all human beings seek.    After years of study, I have come to the conclusion that one can not read the texts without the basic education needed to understand the texts. However, I would say that only about 5% of the overall Christian population have even made the effort to do this. So, those of us that have - are heretics.     When one makes the choice to follow a faith, one must give themselves over to it. That requires the education and willingness to see ALL angles and sides of ALL situations - be them good or bad.    Those that do not, really are missing out.      The more you know, the better off you are, really. I know that I am not perfect nor will ever be perfect. I know that what I believe in my heart is true for me. My faith is about me and my relationship with MY God. It has nothing to do with anyone else. So, I keep it to myself. If someone asks questions about it, I am more than willing to share, but I do not, or will I EVER force my religion onto ANYONE.    No one forced me to beleive, and no one has the right to force anyone else, either.          sorry this was so long - I get on a soap box from time to time.|`|ai4lrclMaa	Because they think for themselves. And are therefore less prone to making judgements about others based on precoceived prejudices and beliefs.|`|NNWerE4Jaa	because we appreciate life for what it is.. and not for what some dude sufford for us!!|`|0a2c15282819d7b30bdcecbde5be9249aa	that's one of the benefits of rational thinking|`|cByRtCC9aa	Because religious dogma sometimes gets in the way of reasonable thinking.|`|IL6SrhgRaa	Becouse they are not involved in religous groups they have no want to compete with other "christians"|`|BrjyljGIaa	Because they do good things for the simple reason that they are good.  Religious people don't do evil things (for the most part, don't get me started on holy wars, crusades and inquisitions) in hopes of getting into heaven.|`|O9WVH9yhaa	That is a generalization, but flattering to us spiritual free thinkers nonetheless.  Thanks.  It's probably got something to do with open mindedness...BUT    There are kind and gracious people who belong to organized religions too don't forget!     Kind and gracious people come in all shapes, sizes, colors, and religions.|`|nvYgdxk1aa	It's a matter of I am right you are wrong that is instilled in most organized religion, especially those that have been in the same place all their lives. As opposed to the no body really knows for sure so why criticize attitude, that comes from being exposed to many cultures and beliefs.    Me personally I don't think there is one set way to get to heaven.|`|iJRsJUBmaa	because  the answer to letting gods will flow through our lives is a close relationship with the wholly spirit   NOT religion|`|DVuWsb2raa	Because we are not a part of anything that requires judgment on other people based on a religious agendas.     If a christian finds out you are not Christian, they will try to convert you.. making you feel like you are judged.     An agnostic, or "spiritual free thinker" does not have an agenda and is always willing to learn about some new idea, religion, philosophy, etc.     We do not limit ourselves.. whereas those believing in only one thing, do.     We understand that living on this planet is a humanitarian thing, not a religion, race or politics take over. The reason I feel most people choose to be "free thinkers" is because they truly believe that keeping an open mind, is the best way to contribute to society.. in my opinion, it is.    I would never judge someone because of their religious beliefs, but I can not tell you how many people have told me I need to find "God." Well, as far as I am concerned, they are judging me, and I am a better Christian than they will ever be.. and I am not even "Christian." When I encounter people like this, I just hope that one day they open their eyes, ears and mind to all the possibilities of the universe.. because they are not free.. they are tied down to something that someone else told them to believe in.    On  a side note though, I know plenty of religious people who are fabulous and open minded-- but in my opinion they still think they are "right" and you are "wrong" even though I love them dearly.|`|AAgX0SDcaa	Sometimes church-goers  have an agenda that has nothing to do with faith, such as finding someone to date or becoming a politician or having a successful business, they are trying to attract more business or votes or dates. Other people become legalistic or arrogant and then shut out others they don't feel are worthy. For some church is a social club, if you don't join then you aren't a part of their little club.  Many people have grown up in a church, were forced to attend and didn't really develop their faith, but feel they are doing the right thing by attending.|`|R5f4MjZcaa	Can you give me an example of who you think is a spiritual free thinker?|`|AA11849917	In answer to your question, it's because these "free thinkers" don't really care about your eternal destiny.  They don't really care that your sins will drag you, kicking and screaming, into hell with them.    Because of that, they are more "gracious" to you, tolerating whatever sins you care to persue, and they won't try to stop you from the cliff awaiting you, and the fall that follows.  "Do your own thing" and "Tolerate everybody" are some key phrases.    The Christian, however, has a key phrase "Repent and ask God to forgive you so you won't HAVE to spend eternity in hell!"    Basically, Christians are less tolerant of sin, they understand the consequences, so they do whatever is in their limited power to try to persuade you to change your lifestyle - to quit your sins - to trust in Jesus for salvation.  So, it comes across as intolerance towards the person, while - in reality - it's intolerance towards the sin that's destroying the person.  It comes across as being less tolerant, showing no grace towards others.  But you need to see it for what it truly is - a lifesaver desparately trying to rescue the drowning; a fire fighter desparately trying to rescue the perishing - any of a number of images comes to mind, but these are just two of them.|`|7Q7dFghmaa	Faith is a wonderful thing. Religion is not.

I feel called to work on the Internet.|`|AA10628838	We haven't been brain washed and can think for ourselves.|`|8pQrIL90aa	Because they do not really think freely, they think spiritually and we heed the word as it is written, not changing the contents.    You must obey his word, and if GOD says speak your words of encouragement  seasoned with salt then this must be in place for a reason. Trust and obey him.|`|mAE7vbX6aa	We've finally come to the understanding that WE'RE the ones responsible, ultimately, for ourselves, our own behavior, our own beliefs, our own destinies.

No axes to grind.|`|4boTYkt7aa	Don't you read the questions and comments on this site?You have got to be kidding.
dYyiG90caa	LOL !!    It's registered with the Federal Government as a Religion.    Basically, it is a Belief System -- That you have lived Past Lives, going as Far Back as Before the Creation of the Earth.    The complaint from the Psychiatric Community, is that they are Practicing Psychology, without a License.    There "Less Strange" philosophy is Actually Quite Reasonable.    It's sort of a Westernized Buddhism.    They believe in what they Call "The Reactive Mind"    During your Life (& past lives) -- You have accumulated "Garbage" from being Taught various Rights & Wrongs.    Sort of an Inner Voice or Ethics that You have decided to Believe in.    The problem (they claim) happens when This "Belief System" that YOU have been Indoctrinated into --     Actually KEEPS YOU from taking Chances and Moving Forward in Life.    In other Words -- Someone Says something and you have a "knee-jerk" Reaction in your Brain that tells you NOT to believe it.    Problem is -- What if what you don't believe, turns out to be True.    SO -- Scientology's Purpose is to Un-clutter and "Clear" this "Reactive Mind" of Yours --    So, that you can see the World from a More Objective and Open Perspective.    As with Buddhism it involves Confronting your Fears and the things that Get in the Way of YOU having what you Want.    I spent one year taking a Communication Course which was Very interesting (even though My Typing looks Weird LOL :)) -- But, I don't Care if no one likes my typing or if it "Bothers" them --    Because -- "What Class??" -- Because it is THEIR "Reactive Mind" that is controlling their Emotions.    There is an Old Philosophical Saying --     "You do not Control You Emotions; They Control You"    and -- Are You having Emotions or Are they having You ? lol :))    There is not way to sum-up In-Full what Scientology is About.    The class I took was very cheap - $20 -- But when you get "in deep" -- I understand that it can Cost, Well into the Thousands.    Some of it is Really Weird and Some of it is (as I said) -- common sense stuff -- Like Confronting what is Bothering Oneself, instead of Running away from it.    As far as a "CULT" -- Anything that One becomes Addicted To -- Can be considered a CULT -- Including Religion, Science, -- All Belief Systems can be CULTs --     IF YOU Choose to Close Yourself Off -- from Outside Possibilities.    Just my Opinion --    When I took that Class -- Everyone acted like Normal People. No "glazed-over" eyes and NO Pressure to Pay for More Classes.    I don't know -- I can only report on My Experience :)    EDIT --     The reaons I laughed in the Beginning, is only because of ho you Phrased the Question - lol :))    It just struck me funny, I guess ??    EDIT 2 --    "6ofUs3 " makes a good point !!    ...and the First Book Written, is "Dianetics" --    It's actually a Fascinating Read --and it WILL NOT BrainWash You - :))    HEY !! --    I am NOT Arguing that they May be "Nutz" or that it's only about Money -- Or that it even is About BrainWashing.    I'm just saying the only things that I know.    ..and as Far as Psychiatric Medicine -- I think that Tom Cruise made a Good Point, a few Years Ago.    I have Mental Illness in some of my Family -- and the Trial & Errror of Psychiatric Medicine -- Has only made them WORSE --    Including One Suicide.    So, I think their Are 2-Sides to Scientology's Accusations.    Look at the Pharmaceutical Companies !!    That Garbage is BIG BUSINESS.    Even Many prominant Psychiatrists Admit that there are TOO MANY Children on "RITALIN"    Of course -- There are Those that Achieve Great Success with Psychiatric Medicine.    But -- There it is More Probable that there are Those that are "too easily" Diagnosed as Needing Medicines.    As Far as BRAINWASHING --    Who are the Biggest BrainWashers in the U.S. ??    The Political Propaganda that comes from Both Parties.    Oww !! I hurt me knee falling-off my SoapBox :)  .  .|`|WhUV9k6Jaa	A Sci-Fi story created by L.

They beleive that Xenu was a big evil alien that dumped a bunch of other aliens here and now they posess us or something like that.    They require money to advance and will not tell you everything they beleive until you move in. I read an estimate that it would cost you $300,000 to reach the upper levels of it. They actually tell people that if they learn too soon, they will be hurt or even die (not sure how serious the threat is).    If you start talking about Xenu, then I think they will have to walk away because of that.|`|lcvhhGjpaa	The space alien overlord Xenu captured people from other planets and chained them around a volcano, he then blew them up with nuclear weapons,  then he imprisoned their souls inside of us.  We have more than one of these souls, which are called Thetans, imprisoned inside us.  At $250,000 a Thetan, you can have them removed.  This depends on how many previous lives you have had.    The whole thing is based on a Sci-fi book by L. Ron. Hubbard.    Seriously, they are nuts.|`|rcPnnfmmaa	Soleil has it about right.    They're a mind control cult.

Serious.|`|AA10985325	Good  question..but not sure why all the antagonism .    Anyway, heres a factual description for you (from a Scientologist):    Scientology is a new religion. It is an applied religious philosophy. By applied is meant that it is for use in life and  living. You actually use it in your day to day life to change and improve existing conditions. It is a practical religion.  All religions if you study them have a basic philosophy, but they also have certain dogma, rituals and observances and a certain faith or belief is required. There is nothing wrong with this , but Scientology is not that kind of religion. It acknowledges the principle of God or the Supreme Being but does not try to define or describe this principle,  leaving it up to the individual.  It is also not a messianic religion. This means there is no worship of prophets or messiahs or gods. It is not belief or faith based. In Scientology a truth is true for you according to your own observation and experience .  The dictionary definition that applies:    Religion: The spiritual or emotional attitude of one who recognises the existence of superhuman power or powers.    The most basic principle of Scientology is that YOU are your own immortal soul, that this is not a thing you have but what YOU actually are.  Scientology believes or considers that Man is basically good. This is different from many religions that promote that he his natively evil or bad unless made good.    The whole purpose of Scientology knowledge application and procedure is to increase an individuals understanding and awareness of himself as a spiritual being and to rehabilitate his native abilities and potential.  When you do this there sphere and zones of his positive influence increases and moves outward into his life , his family and friends, his groups and Mankind of which he is part .    How this result is achieved is the technology of Scientology, which was developed by L Ron Hubbard from discoveries he made after  extensive research into the field of the mind and the human spirit.  Some of this knowledge was already existing in the sacred lore of ancient texts like the Veda or Vedic Hymns going back 10,000 years. New and additional discoveries were  made about the nature of the human spirit and fully recorded and codified .  Scientologys closest spiritual ties with any other religion are with Orthodox (Hinayana ) Buddhism with which it shares an historical lineage. But even here the relationship is based mainly on friendship and the recognition of the being as a spirit rather than any organizational ties.    L.Ron Hubbard published 18 basic books from 1950 to 1955 to fully communicate the basic principles of Scientology, the path of his research and the technology that  he developed from this.   He completed all his research before his death in 1986 and left all his materials and copyrights to the Church of Scientologys Religious Technology Centre along with most of his personal estate when he died.    The Church of Scientology is currently established iand operating internationally in over 160 countries world wide. However it is still a new religion, less than 55 years old.  The true story of Scientology as a religion goes like this:  1. A philosopher developes a philosophy about life and death.  2. People find it interesting.  3. People find it works.  4. People pass it along to others.  5. It grows.    This is just an overview.  L.Ron Hubbard explained fully the theology and technologies of Scientology in more than 500,000 pages of writings, including dozens of books and over 3,000 tape recorded public lectures. So its not possible to fully answer your question on this forum, but I hope  this helps.|`|IYF4xSTdaa	it is a religion between judaism and buddhism..it is also pratice by a lot of movie stars...some say it is a cult since that all religions are part cult and has some paganism in them...same with this..

AA11724685	I think you should just give him your treat bag. If it's got food in it, he'll like it. And hey, VDay falls on a Saturday, so ask him what he's doing. Just kind of ask him nonchalantly, that way if he has plans, then it's ok, and you don't look too eager. Maybe you guys could go do something during the day, that way it wouldn't seem like you're trying to tie him down to an actual Valentine's Day DATE in the evening. Good luck. Just go with the flow.|`|4udzUGjkaa	yes leave it at that...if you give him anything else it might seem a little bit awkward.|`|LvK6rg1caa	nothing, his just a fling dont waste your money on him if his not going to do the same.|`|xJBJn6dOaa	Well, since it doesn't sound like he's seeing anyone besides you, because he's busy... i would go for it. Ask him if he can do something that night, and he will likely accept, because no one wants to be alone on Valentine's Day! Give him a little bag of your treats and I wouldn't be surprised if he got you something too or picked up the dinner bill. Have fun!|`|nYwoC1Lmaa	So take it from a Guys Point of View darling :)   If you want my attention then give me some attention back in Return hunny.    Hell I would give him the Stuff and Tell him you have Planned a romantic Weekend and see if he is truly Interested in you and spending   the weekend with u also.    As that way you shall know what the real Deal Is sexy, as you wanna be a PT gf or a FT gf and what ever you do is once u give up the Kitty cat, your as good as gone if you stop putting out also.    HE HE damn i amazed myself also, Good Luck and Let me Know your outcome hunny.  Your Law Professor Jeffery (C)|`|ra69rxxgaa	Sex
Y8kjVeLyaa	It must be because women historically have done most of the child rearing....you have to multi-task if there is one or more babies or children in the home...you cannot ignore the cooking dinner AND the crying baby...or the three year old who has fallen and cut it's knee and the ringing phone.|`|H8MGismEaa	Yes , because we had to . So we have more practice .|`|c3474cd1d5137c5d6298fa6134dcf3c8aa	men and women ARE different and it has been proven that on average each sex has its strengths and weaknesses. Generally women are better multi-taskers and generally men have faster reaction times. The explanation I heard for this goes back to when we were all hunter/gatherers. In those societies the women were the primary care takers for the children, gathered food, prepared it, cared for the village, etc. It was necessary for women to be able to do more than one thing at a time. Any mother will tell you that is STILL true. I have two kids and its not unusual for me to be giving my 3 month old a bath while fixing my 2 year old something to eat and loading the dishwasher all at the same time. That is how things get done. Men traditionally were hunters and in order to be successful they needed to be able to react quickly (thus the quicker reaction times)|`|72a759eadcb04ef83b501e2c3dcde213aa	the female mind is not genetically mould in a way that compartmentalise everything like us men do.     For us men who used to go hunting out in the sarengetti eons ago, would have evolved mental percision and mental focus on targets. This had led us to evolve a mental compartmentalisation of our skills and ability to distinguish differences etc. i.e. a scientific mind which likes organisation, e.g. we can distinguish whether we are sleeping with women because of the sex or the love, we can only do one thing at a time    Women - due to their natural tendencies to child bearing have evolved ways to meet the needs of the child in as many ways as possible. i.e. they have evolved a brain which does a lot of things at the same time, e.g. communicate whilst feeding the baby and knowing whether the baby is hungry or not, i.e. multitask.    hope this helps|`|cRhkkBAEaa	To be honest, I have never seen a man try. :) lol|`|AA12100081	Hereditary.    Men were the hunter gatherers who concentrated on hunting meat on legs (one at a time) on gathering foods, simple tasks requiring concentration, after which (with a full belly they sat around for the rest of the day doing nothing other than sleeping and procreating).    Females however had to watch/feed multiple children at the same time as preparing food, wiping their b u m  and making their home and....trying to entice a sly male on the side.    Try doing all that with 4 or 5 kids and you will see that due to the process of natural selection, only females adept at multi tasking were capable of passing on their genes to future generations.|`|AcPq4Qd8aa	Its not that women can, its that they do. If women knew what men could do the men wouldnt get it done for them.|`|3VXGLhnMaa	It stems from generations of being mothers/home keepers/budget managers/finding "lost" items/knowing answers to the most obscure questions....need I go on?

EmOnt7FIaa	I am so tired of this same question being asked over and over again.     Obama is biracial, he is half black and half white. He is no more black than white and no more white than black. He is biracial. Sure, he has more African American features than Caucasian features, but physical appearance and skin tone alone does not determine race. Race is all about genetics.    He should consider himself biracial, because he is biracial. I really feel bad for many mulatto kids out there who are having identity crisis's over this and I feel bad for the multiracial community because he disowned them. It is not right what he is doing.|`|uVQ6OSu3aa	Dumb fuckkk. we all come from one. We all have the same blood, therefore we represent the human race, so let the dumb **** go and be part of one America and stop dividing it.|`|a1iam8Zvaa	i already have|`|ZZ5Rm406aa	Look at a person beyond his skin.

People object to things like no experience in government , and no record to stand on . We can't be too enthused over that .|`|WtXCUnoXaa	he defines himself as black hes black,  yes, hes president.  there isn't much ppl can do about it.  so get a lader && get the hel ova it.|`|WAoNhHB1aa	I'm white, and I think he's mixed, but if he wants to call himself black, whatev.

AND yes whoever doesn't like who the president  for whatever reason needs to get over it.|`|i48kxrbaaa	Accept it, or live in agony for the next 4-8 years.|`|eskZfVBkaa	In my opinion, Obama is a Black President because, due to the one drop rule, this is how he is seen in America and this is how he identifies himself as. But we should all (whether white black asian etc) just accept that there is a good president, regardless of his race.|`|j5uO9LL7aa	I wasn't aware "us white people" had not already accepted it.  In fact, it cannot be denied that "us white people" helped put him there.|`|B3c4wziWaa	I accepted him as my black president when he was sworn in. However I don't accept his ways of handling things, his policy's, his stimulus plan, lack of experience, his spread the wealth idea, his health care plan should I go on or do you understand my point I'm clearly making?|`|ImiMtrcqaa	Give it a rest.  The man has been President less than a month.   I'll wait and see what kind of job he and his Admin. do before passing any judgment.   The majority in this country elected him to the office of President.   With your attitude, do not ever run for any office including class president of your high school.|`|4sh2oRR7aa	First off, Obama is mixed. He shouldn't be called black. That just says you're ashamed of being a certain race. Also he says his mother did so much for him and to call himself black is to say she never existed which is extremely offensive. If you are mixed, you should call yourself mixed. Without multiple races in your heritage, you wouldn't exist so it counts. Secondly, white people voted him in. The minority vote combined is only a fraction of the white vote. So apparently we accept him. We put him in the white house.|`|iybezfi6aa	Oh for heaven's sake. He won by a Landslide. A vast number of white people voted for him.   He is a figure of hope. For black people. For white people. For everybody.  He is a sophisticated, knowledgable person who can raise us up if we let him.  NOW, everybody shut up and try to get along.|`|kHx1upOpaa	My president is black, i don't care what people say, white people invented the rule and now since it works against there agenda they want to say it doesn't apply now. If he was in prison it wouldn't be argued that he is black.
LuN1unJ3aa	Ask to speak with someone who can represent the particular religion. Most Rabbis, including ultra-orthodox, will be willing to talk with you as long as you show respect for their beliefs and do not attempt to push your own on them.

For instance, certain people are tempted to steal things, but they don't act upon their temptation.  People might be tempted to a homosexual life, but if they don't act upon it,  there is no reason why they shouldn't work and glorify God.|`|f7fcb6877caa0ad4f41dd9af2258ee0aaa	Homosexual orientation is not an obstacle to anything.  It is not a moral issue.  Homosexual behavior is a moral issue, and someone who has chosen that path should not be in a position of authority in the Church, just like someone who is committing adultery or living together without benefit of marriage.|`|AA11502346	I think some would take offense, depending on the church.  There are gay-friendly churches out there where gays are active in various ministries.|`|4Vt20nvoaa	Depends on the situation.  I wouldn't mind a gay person selling brownies in the church bake sale, but I wouldn't want them teaching my kids Sunday School class.|`|hj76FSKdaa	It would depend on what that person was doing.  For example, to be a church elder, there are specific qualifications  which would prevent an active homosexual from holding the position.  On the other hand, if a homosexual person was witnessing to other people, there would be nothing wrong about that.  It would be no different than a man who was having an affair witnessing about God.|`|FYQe54Akaa	Not sure; I wouldn't.  There are homosexuals that are Christians and I believe it is not up to humans to judge; we can't help who we love. In my opinion I believe we should accept people for who they are and not judge them based on their sexuality.|`|ROVwWPViaa	I heard a great statement once, that Man is Gods  creation so anything man creates is made from God as well so that is a wise statement and answer to many questions.|`|fOfJz9OMaa	Youre speaking under the assumption that deliberate sinners are somehow a Christian; they are not.

Radical fundamentalists and other extremist conservatives, though:  they might.    I was once at a gay rights rally with some other gay and gay supportive Christians.  In order to "drive our demons out"  one group started praying the Our Father very loudly.  When we joined in, some of them actually shouted for us to shut up, that we had no right to pray the Lord's Prayer.    We prayed anyway, but I thought that was an interesting reaction from the fundamentalists.|`|X9rXRNUxaa	Please tell me HOW an unrepentant sinner can do God's work?

We would also try to tell them that God does not accept homosexuals and that you are eligible to get to Heaven if you are gay. We would tell them all this, but try not to scare them while doing it. We would pray for them and have a lot of hope for them knowing that someday they might change their views and become straight and still work for the Lord.|`|96cd1744acaf1e87751ac1ec9c729b19aa	Why should they dear?

What shall be the end of Man, in the fullness of their time? What will be within their power, in a future undetermined? Shall there come some Armageddon where blood like rivers flow? Does there wait some final judgment where hell consumes, in lakes of fire, the seed of Gods beginning?  2. Come now and let us reason, both you and I together, for I would not have you fearful of ages yet to come; but would instead reveal the dream where God and Man are one, for hope is the gift which I would give you, to fill your days with joy.  3. For in a future yet unmade shall Man reach beyond this world, to touch and know of strange new worlds within the starry deep; to find therein a place of life where Man might take dominion; to build and grow throughout the ages, an alliance among the stars.  4. Why then should you dread a future which God would happy give you? Why fear a future yet undreamed, a future filled with challenge? For future times call to the past, and dares you to fulfill; leading gently through the ages to take its life from you, to grow and blossom and stand full grown in a reality still to come.  5. So let us look with hopeful hearts, and never miss a step, but face with courage the years to come while holding on to God; facing down with minds made calm, the prophets of doom and dread, seeing beyond each present trouble that place where dreams await; waiting quietly far ahead, for us to come along.  6. Hear me now and I will tell you of what must come to be; accept in faith with all your heart and place your hand in mine, and we will change the world of man, and forge a brighter future.  7. Where shall we start, both you and I, to shape a good tomorrow; where dreams do walk as mighty visions which touch the life of Man? In what place shall we begin? How make the dream come true?  Book of Wisdom 29:1-7    The future of mankind will be exciting, surprising and wondrous. And although the future, at times, will be filled with challenges, the human family will meet these challenges and overcome them. We will adapt, as a species, we will endure.

Why is it, that we can clearly see the faults in others, but neglect to see them in ourself?  We see someone make a mistake and we judge them harshly, and yet we sweeten it, when we are guilty of doing the same exact thing.

This is Latin for the 'soul of the natural Christian' and it came as the result of the interpretation of some of his poetry, especially the fourth Eclogue. This reputation has stayed with Virgil since that time and it certainly played a role in preserving his poetry when other poetry was lost during the Dark Ages after the fall of Rome in 476 AD. Although Virgil lived before the advent of Jesus Christ and Christianity, it was proposed that his poetry anticipated a Christian ethic before Jesus Christ was born. It is in the fourth of ten Eclogues that this was demonstrated most dramatically.  ... The fourth Eclogue is decidedly different in this respect. In the poem Virgil makes several statements about a child destined to bring a Golden Age and free the world from fear. Early Christian scholars (such as Saint Augustine) read this poem and concluded that this child that Virgil spoke of had to be the Messiah: Jesus Christ. Later writers, such as the Italian poet Dante, would also interpret this poem to be a prophecy regarding the Christ.

[fn]         1Cr 1:20 So where does this leave the philosophers, the scholars, and the world's brilliant debaters? God has made them all look foolish and has shown their wisdom to be useless nonsense.         1Cr 1:21 Since God in his wisdom saw to it that the world would never find him through human wisdom, he has used our foolish preaching to save all who believe.         1Cr 1:22 God's way seems foolish to the Jews because they want a sign from heaven to prove it is true. And it is foolish to the Greeks because they believe only what agrees with their own wisdom.         1Cr 1:23 So when we preach that Christ was crucified, the Jews are offended, and the Gentiles say it's all nonsense.         1Cr 1:24 But to those called by God to salvation, both Jews and Gentiles, [fn] Christ is the mighty power of God and the wonderful wisdom of God.         1Cr 1:25 This "foolish" plan of God is far wiser than the wisest of human plans, and God's weakness is far stronger than the greatest of human strength.         1Cr 1:26 Remember, dear brothers and sisters, that few of you were wise in the world's eyes, or powerful, or wealthy when God called you.         1Cr 1:27 Instead, God deliberately chose things the world considers foolish in order to shame those who think they are wise. And he chose those who are powerless to shame those who are powerful.         1Cr 1:28 God chose things despised by the world, things counted as nothing at all, and used them to bring to nothing what the world considers important,         1Cr 1:29 so that no one can ever boast in the presence of God.         1Cr 1:30 God alone made it possible for you to be in Christ Jesus. For our benefit God made Christ to be wisdom itself. He is the one who made us acceptable to God. He made us pure and holy, and he gave himself to purchase our freedom.         1Cr 1:31 As the Scriptures say, "The person who wishes to boast should boast only of what the Lord has done."|`|AyPF2TFlaa	Chinese whispers, there was only one to start with,if there is more than one it stands to reason they took from the first mixed it a little and so on so on.|`|y8yLVQJnaa	Just because there are parallels between one religion and the other doesn't necessarily mean it was plagiarized from the other.  In Statistics, we learn that correlation doesn't prove causation.    For example, there are many parallels between Jesus Christ and the Greek Dionysus, Persian Mithras, and Egyptian Horus.  However, what came first, the chicken or the egg?  These pagan gods were worshipped before Jesus Christ was born.  However, Christians also believe that prophets have been giving us prophecies of a Messiah ever since the beginning of history, and that some of these prophecies may have leaked out into other religions as they developed, and then made parallels.  Accusing Christians of plagiarizing Jesus Christ, or Noah's Ark after Babylon's Epic of Gilgamesh only works if you already assume that Christianity is false.  If these Christian accounts are really true, they would also then explain what we're seeing.  I think that's why Christians don't see that as evidence against.|`|mSFjbetxaa	After I learned about the many deities born of a virgin besides Jesus, I felt like a fool for ever believing that nonsense.|`|BQ6WmoHiaa	False premise, at least when it comes to Christianity.  It's a common myth that previously worshipped Gods (ie. Mithras, Horus, etc.) are almost identical in story to Jesus.  For instance, this garbage about Horus being pretty much the same as Jesus was completely fabricated by some two-bit anti-theist "scholar" back in the 19th century.  The fact remains, the historical record of Horus (Book of the Dead, Egyptian) tells a story that is pretty much NOTHING like that of Jesus.  Same with the other popular "twin stories" of Jesus.      The Internet has become particularly deft at being a venue for this myth to spread.  Then again, it's the Internet! :)    No biggie, just do a little studying and try again.

Some people did live into old age (60s-70s) but the majority would die younger, probably before 45.  Death in childbirth was a major risk for women until relatively recently, and infant mortality would have been higher than today.    If anything, your life expectancy would have been improved by Judea becoming part of the Roman world - aqueducts, piped water, proper drainage and sewers, and the best medical care that would be available for centuries.

e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	I think a lot of people who come here are working out their spirituality.    I bet a lot of them are pretty young and callow.  Their exposure to information might be limited their hometown library and their preacher (who might not have made it out of high school).    That behooves the rest of us to be patient with them when they answer hate with more hate, or when they show their lack of knowledge about basic Christian precepts.    Of course there are the others, too.  They come here to push their specific, narrow version of the gospel, which ironically usually has more to do with arrogance than love.

Christians worry about becoming punching bags, but often the issue is trivial and it is the Christian who makes the first move, preaching condemnation against people who were minding their own business.  Loving ones enemies, doing what is "good" for them, does not amount to telling them how wrong they are.  It is literally improving their lives here and now.  The example of Christian martyrs was not in their faithfulness to their religion but in their witness to justice, in their repudiation of evil at the cost of their lives.    Jesus only preached to people who thought they had God all figured out.  The "lost" he taught by reaching out, befriending, and treating them as respectable human beings.  It was his example of self-sacrifice and service that attracted people as much as his teaching, and his teaching was straightforward and rather anti-authoritarian.  He acknowledged the right of religious leaders to define religious teachings, but he warned the people not to emulate their hypocritical behavior, and he insisted that the role of leadership was to serve the needs of the least, not to make their own jobs easy.    A sincere Christian spends most of his time converting himself rather than others, because morality and faith can only be taught by example.  No human can see perfectly into another human's heart, so our capacity to judge is limited to physical evidence, "fruits" if you will, and even that can be misleading.  By making ones own response to life more authentic and Christ-like, one is much more likely to attract curiosity.  Such behavior is far too rare.    A belief system has to make sense, has to work, or it will not attract good followers.  If a non-believer can't understand the costs and benefits of a faith, he won't be able to take it seriously.  Christians need to understand just why they do or don't do certain things, from a human perspective.  Potential reward or punishment is a poor, inhuman basis for obedience.  If there isn't a good, altruistic reason for behavior, it can't overcome suspicion. Christians need to think really hard about what "love your neighbor" truly means. If they do, they will find the "attacks" much much fewer and harder to justify.|`|AA11502346	Most Christians like myself are respectful of other people and don't go around telling others that they will burn in hell.  The hellfire preachers are the ones that get the most attention and thus, people seem to believe that ALL Christians act that way which gives Christians and Christianity a bad rap.    If you actually talked to the average Christian (or atheist or Muslim or whatever), you will find out that the person is quite nice and respectful of others' beliefs.    In order to be a witness to Him and draw more people to Him, we need to present ourselves as humble rather than self-righteous and "holier than thou" without watering down the Gospel.

Religion and Spirituality are two completely different entities.    Religion is rigid, confining, hypocritical and limited in it's beliefs.  Religion imposes conditions on an unconditional God.      Spirituality encourages the individual to use their own minds to discover who they are.  Spirituality also reads more than 'one' book and has unlimited freedom to discover and explore and imposes no limits.    You don't have to belong to a religon to have belief in God or even Jesus.  That is very limited thinking and also passe'.      Believe as you will and allow others the same courtesy.   Christians are also infamous for damning everyone to hell.

Many believers want to deny anyone with different beliefs or lack of beliefs the right to have them or talk about them. I don't "demean my intalligence", guy, and I'm not pseudo-intellectual (Hey, you spelled it and atheist correctly once apiece.)! Anyone who is very intellectual must question beliefs based on an old book begun by ignorant shepherds that contains many contradictions and lots of ignorance about reality. The category is "Religion & Spirituality", not "Christians Only", guy. Also, in case you haven't heard, the First Amendment gives us all freedom of speech and freedom of religion. I don't think I can convince you of anything. A person must be able to think before he can question his opinions and reject them if he finds they are wrong.

You aren't qualified to judge what is intellectual.|`|AA11634944	We have just as much right to stand up for what we believe in as you do. You are generalizing the whole atheist population by assuming we all try to "deny you of your beliefs". Frankly, I wouldn't care if you worshiped a freaking hot dog. What I do care about though, is when you attack us for not following your path of righteousness. If you feel the urge to stand up to somebody who has attacked your religion, then fine, but don't start the fight because you are "holier than thou."    Do you think that you might convince us that you are "right" about god? You follow your path, and we will follow ours.    Without god I have found peace and happiness in my life, as have most athiests. Peace and happiness comes from within somebody, it isn't external.    We are not clones and will never be. For the love of your "god" please accept this and worry about your own business.|`|BBTkAacYaa	Atheists understand something that Biblical Christians also understand. That is that we cannot both be right. There is only room in reality for one of us. And so the Atheist will try to stomp the Theist and vice versa.    Atheism is sort of the "Anti-Religion." They deny everything that is supernatural believing only the physical world exists. Just like we cannot provide scientific evidence that there is a God the Atheist cannot provide scientific evidence that there is no God. Despite the Atheists best efforts they are in fact their own type of religion. They adhere to their own sets of personnel beliefs.     To better answer the question let me rephrase the argument. Lets shy away from the idea of religions and use the more accurate term of Worldview. A world view is the set of beliefs through which you look into the world. If I am a Atheist that means that the sum of a human mind is in the matter of the brain. If you are say a Christian or a Muslim then you believe that the mind is part of the soul, or that humans have a spirit. Something that transcends the natural. So if you are an atheist you look into the section and laugh at all the crazy people who think that there is something beyond the natural. But just like many other religions of the world Atheism feels the need to spread its own idea. The Atheist and Humanist will try to tell you that they are not religion when in fact some of their own organizations get religious tax exemptions upon their own requests.    I personally welcome all of the Atheistic questions. My God told me to be able to give an answer of why I believe what I believe. Instead of chasing of the Atheist I would rather have a "battle of wits." They have just as much of a right to express their religion of non religion as we do to express ours. I am a Christians which means I think everyone but Christians are wrong. WOW I am so intolerant and arrogant. Not really. To me this is like someone trying to argue that the earth is flat. Am I arrogant for saying it is round? I'm not going to harm them (intolerance) for thinking the earth is flat but I will try to correct them. If they refuse to be corrected then the earth is still round despite their argument to the contrary. The Atheist agrees with me but would say I am on the wrong side. They would say that Theism is the one crying flat-earth. That is a different argument for a different time. The Atheist is only trying to correct what he thinks is a misguided idea. If you can't answer their questions then why are you a theist? If I was wrong i would want to be corrected.|`|7ee11f32ce402e558134b3f3e6323823aa	I didn't realize it was an exclusive club.

And perhaps they would also ask questions about the beliefs of other religions.    However, my cynical side is quick to point out that atheists aren't the only non-Christians on R&S, and they'd probably start targeting members of other religions next.  Oh--and some Protestant Christians would keep attacking Catholic Christians for no good reason.  For some reason, there are those evangelicals who refuse to acknowledge that Christianity was organized into the Catholic Church relatively early on, that the only other Christian groups in existence at that time held beliefs generally considered heretical by modern Christians, and that the Roman Catholic Church was the ONLY Christian denomination in Western Europe through the entire Middle Ages.|`|AA11987172	They would turn on each other (as we have seen sometimes) calling each other "fake" or "unsaved" christians...    lolz|`|GDexucXKaa	They'd argue about who was the "better" or "true" Christian.|`|rGEZup0Zaa	They'd wonder where we all went, and about all the cool stuff we were doing.

Quote from Romans ch1 v 18 to 20  "For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness,    Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them, for God has shown it unto them.    For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead, so that they are WITHOUT excuse".    Everybody knows about God whether they realise it or not. Embedded in our very nature is a knowledge of God, his eternal power and his creation. However this can easily be suppressed by folks that would prefer to live their lives in total contrast of God's will.  All self appointed atheists have a deep down conviction of God, and the nearer to the end of their lives they get the more that conviction nags.

HOQp0gA7aa	Why do people feel the need to "confess" their sexual identity to disapproving members of their family or their community.  If you think it is ok, then just go with it.  Don't turn it into some kind of big high drama production number.      For example most heterosexuals don't feel a need to "come out" as such as in a big confession to their parents.  If you want to be treated by society as normal, stop trying to make something special about your sexual identity.  Just be yourself, keep your private business your own business, and let everyone else worry about themselves.  I as a member of the general public don't tell you details about my sexual proclivities, why do you think I need to hear about yours?      As far as finding out whether someone likes you, there is only one way to go.  Tell this girl that you like her.  Ask her out on a casual "date" sometime.  Don't try to rush into sexual relations.  This is sound advice regardless of gender or sexual orientation.  It is always best in a relationship if you let someone know you like them as a person instead of just as a sexual object.      This will also have the effect of inoculating your father against an extreme reaction when he sees you around this or another girl frequently leading up to a serious relationship.  That way if he catches on that you are having sex, it won't have to be some huge confrontation, just a comment to the effect that you like both guys and girls, and it's really none of his business.      I hope this helps.|`|FMuSs9Qtaa	1. ask her 2. just be yourself n tell her

Those that belief only what they read and are told or those that have an open mind to everything and no one can prove Evolution or Religion is a fact and any one that says they can is the FOOL.

There is a concept you may have heard of called the "Cycle of Poverty." This occurs when 2-3 generations or more of the same family live in poverty due to the lack of resources required to effectively compete in the modern world.    I'm guess that in Ghettos, the "Cycle of Poverty" began (or more accurately, continued) during the era of segregation (1920's-60's), and some people have still not gotten out of this trap.    Cycle of Poverty:    1. Your parents are poor. You cannot afford an education, and you live in poverty. You probably won't even graduate from high school.    2. Because your family is poor and you cannot afford an education, you are also poor! (Unless you're absolutely brilliant at something else)    3. Because you are poor, your children cannot afford an education. Go back to step 1.      Remember that it was only three or four generations ago that things such as segregation laws were actually in force. What you're trying to say is that enough time has passed so that these people should be back on their feet... While things may be getting better, I think your idea is fundementally incorrect. It could take a LONG time for a family to get out of that cycle.    While using "racism" might seem to be an excuse, the effects of racism are still visible in today's world.There is, however, help available for those who seek to break this cycle and get on with their lives.      Today, it may not be based on racial attributes, but more on economic status. It is easy for rich people to get even richer, but difficult for poor people to break this cycle.|`|7R3pNDJEaa	There's a lot of institutional racism still around. Did you know that schools are funded by property taxes? Let's look at a school in a ghetto area as opposed to one in an affluent area. The affluent school will have much better funding due to higher property taxes because it's a nice area where people with nice jobs live in nice houses. The ghetto area on the other hand will have much lower property taxes and because of that the school system will suffer greatly. There is a lot more to it than that, but this is just a teaser because I don't feel like giving an entire lecture when you can look it up yourself rather than just looking down from your high horse.|`|DvrpBX4saa	No...black people have been through a lot.

CS4MVhsfaa	Hi, Western Rider!    Give this a read.  Hope it answers your question.    John H
xWi4ua0Iaa	When you read Huckleberry Finn, did it say somewhere in the book that it was just an allegory?    Just because there is a smidgin of historical information within the text (probably there to give the readers and hearers of the documents a sense of relation), does not mean that the art of storytelling is not involved.  The issue most people have nowadays with ALL supposed HOLY BOOKS is that they so resemble the literature near their cultures - in other words, not exclusive to the Holy Book's own singular culture - suggesting that they all grew out of the Oral Tradition that predated writing by thousands of years.    EDIT:  What does Huckleberry Finn raising or not raising the dead have to do with anything?  Are you suggesting that the more "fantastic" the claims of a text are, the more they must be "true"?  You can't possibly be serious!  If you are I guess I should have referenced SpiderMan or The Hulk instead of Mark Twain....you do know that they're not real, don't you?  The films of them are creations of Hollywood and special effects, not documentaries...    EDIT:  The HULK isn't real...SPIDERMAN too...they are creations of STORYTELLERS....(hoping you are making the connection)...    EDIT:  The thing that is most offensive about this (and it's numerous in this question's case) is your suggestion that people must be out to "take away from the Power of God" simply by understanding the literature as allegory (personally, I prefer the term "storytelling", but to each his own).  Why would you think this?  If a superstitiously laden story didn't happen the way it is described in ANY HOLY BOOK, it doesn't detract from God because it never happened in the first place.  God (if He/She/It exists) doesn't require a written record to still be just as powerful as they wish to be.      Is the only reason you hold a belief in God because you are told there is a book about a God who chastises people with His power?  What a house of cards your faith is!  What a weak and ill-formed faith you have about the presence of God, if that is the case.  You're not espousing a belief in a God; you are turning a book into your idol and worshipping that because somebody has convinced you the book itself has magical powers.  Are you a little fat kid who is often bullied by thugs at school?  Women make fun of you because of your naive personality?  Spend a good portion of your day isolated playing video games where you can pretend to have a life different that the dull existence you continue to proliferate?  Why are you hung up on turning God into a superhero that will "bust those bullies up" for you?  Do you have any understanding about how ridiculously superstitious that is?     What you are indeed postulating is not an attribute of God, but a personal preference that you wish others to share.  Do you think you accomplish that by misleading people into thinking you understand the text, or even literature in general?  It seems to me that if the text is true or is just an allegory, it would be written down to help others lead a fuller and more just way of life - or else should be understood as information regarding a certain historical context that was prevelant at the time (enough that somebody felt it was necessary to write it down).      A need to have it be regarded as historical fact has no truth in it, no more than if I said you should believe that Oliver Stone's movie "JFK" or "W." is absolutely true (they aren't).    In such a case, I'm simply commandeering the word "true" in a manipulative manner because of my preferences.  People that do this are intellectually dishonest because they are confusing the word "true" with their own shallow subjectivity.    At any rate, I suspect that the only reason you hold any belief that it is something other than storytelling is because somebody told you you HAVE to believe otherwise or God will punish you (manipulation by fear), and by the simple fact that you don't even bother reading it for yourself (difficulty in processing theological concepts).  I hope you are simply a very young person, and will grow up before you do irreparable harm to yourself and your community.|`|1ffb5797d2e26ccb8eb17dd3db6e22c0aa	Doesn't.  However,  that does not mean that some parts are not obviously allegorical in nature.      Jesus's parables are examples of such allegories in Scripture.     We can deduce that others are meant symbollically or allegorically as well, if we use common sense and context, correctly.     In fact a lot of the ancient writers intermixed literal truth and figures of speech in order to make their points.     We ALSO do this all the time in normal conversation and we rarely announce it as "allegorically speaking" -- We merely assume that the listener can figure that out by context OR by asking questions.    Problem is,  we can't ask clarification of ancient writers of scripture, so there are chances that we may be taking some things literal when they were not meant so... and likewise, symbollically when they were not meant so.    To Non-Catholics,  Jesus's statements about being the Bread of Life and instructing his disciples to eat his body and drink his blood were meant "symbollically"  when no where does it say symbollically.  Some say "in rememberance of me" means symbollically.. but no where really does doing something in rememberance  MEAN it is ONLY symbollically.  When we remember Pearl Harbor..we don't do it symbollically,  when we remember our Grand Parents, we do it LITERALLY not symbollically.  No one says.. I symbollically remembered my Grandpa who died 2 years ago.  So rememberance and symbollically are 2 different things.    YET,  STILL many Non-Catholics have chosen to take that passage symbollically.     MAYBE because they have separated themselves from the people who could clarify the words in the bible.. from those who were around the 1st century and could ASK the apostles what was meant.       SO,  while allegorical or symbollic is not mentioned in the bible.. it doesn't mean everything is literal,  NOR do we TAKE everything literally.   I agree with you that their may be mistakes made on what exactly is allegorical and what isn't.|`|eO2rnf7yaa	God didn't explicitly tell us what each word meant either.    Common sense and our understanding of language tell us the meaning of each word.  It is also our common sense and understanding of language that tell us that parts of The Bible are allegories.   Parts are written as allegory, and anyone who is familiar with the language and literature can plainly tell that.  Your question shows the problem that can arise when everyone reads The Bible all alone.  It is a document intended for the entire community, and it should be read and interpreted as a community.  That community is the Catholic Church.  2000 years of Catholic Scholarship prevent the sort of error you described.  It is a mistake to read The Bible as if you are the first and only person to read it.   2000 years of faithful Catholic scholars have read and explained The Bible.   We should all benefit from this community.    Peace be with you.|`|s7pqFa1eaa	"God" to my knowledge never "said" anything.

It's there in Daniel and Revelation; the only instance I can think of in the Gospels is Jesus' interpretation of the Parable of the Sower.

Unless you caught God on Oprah discussing His book for the book club and I missed it. Me personally, I highly doubt God drowned every man, woman, child and beast except for two of a kind he marched onto a boat because he didn't like the noise. Or that gave instructions on selling one's daughter into sexual slavery. Or that the creator of the universe really wants us to burn entrails because he enjoys the smell. Or that a "God of love" would order all the Midianite women and male children put to the sword and the virgin girls handed over to the Israelite soldiers. I mean, we should at least expect the creator of the universe to have higher standards than a barbarian warlord that we'd execute as a war criminal, shouldn't we? We should at least worship a God that forbids us to pimp our daughters instead of one that tells us how to sell them, shouldn't we?

I can't imagine it would be a problem for you to pawn something of value for money to buy gas or groceries. If you need the money, you need it.    part 2 find a pawn shop, take your item to them they will ask how much money you want or offer you an amount, will write out a pawn ticket and take your item, and give you cash in the amount agreed upon. easy.|`|LhDde5iBaa	Pawning is selling off valuables or useless tripe for quick cash.      I have no idea where the church stands on, though.|`|LuN1unJ3aa	Pawning something of value, in my opinion, should be avoided, unless you just want to sell it and not reclaim it later. Otherwise, you are essentially looking at a very expensive loan.    How it works. You find a "pawn" shop, walk in, and offer what you have to the person who works there. They will tell you what they are willing to give you for your item and either you accept or decline. It is really that simple.    Later, if the item has not been sold to someone else, you can buy it back for the price the pawn shop has put on the item.    A resale shop works the same way, only you are donating your goods (or placing them on consignment).    If you need money to pay bills or buy groceries and have no other means, contact the local bishop and explain your situation. You may be asked to do some work, but you won't be selling anything you might value or treasure.    Edit: There are no policies against pawning valuables, but the appearance of such a practice isn't good in my opinion.|`|cc45a7835eae87c6f861540fd8f4521daa	I've never heard the church take a stand one way or the other.  You are permitted to sell the things you own if you wish.  It is unwise, as others have mentioned, to do so if it is your intent to merely obtain a "loan" for the item, as you'll pay  through the nose to get your item back compared to what you're given.    A better idea, if you really don't need the things you're selling, is to sell them on Craigslist or Ebay.  You'll get better money for your items.

JCGtfNeTaa	Don't you just love the following reply that someone made?    -------------------  Edit: Oh, this is an abortion thing? Yeah, you do have to consider viability here. Until a baby is viable outside the womb, it's completely dependent on the mother. And the mother has the right to choose the fate of something dependent upon her.  -------------------    The child, EVEN AFTER BIRTH, is still TOTALLY DEPENDENT upon the mother.    Put the baby in a bassinet but do absolutely nothing; don't feed the baby, don't talk to the baby, don't change the baby, don't have anything to do with the baby at all.    Then see how long that baby will live.    So, with that type of "reasoning", the pro-abortionist cannot be against murdering a newborn infant, since, as the replier above said, the baby is still *totally* dependent upon the mother, and the mother has the right to choose the fate of something dependent upon her.    So, I suppose, until the child moves out of the home and is at that time 100% independent from mother, the mother is free to murder ("abort") the child at anytime she so chooses.    That's an attitude that I would call PATHETIC!!!|`|AA11690436	I met someone who was a very small mass of cells.

That makes us all temples of  true "God(s)"   : }  (for those who believe)    Lisa Lee, I agree. I've meditated on some things like the miracle of life:    Mankind may be able to unite sperm and egg In some cases, but only true "God(s)" true love could unite mind, body, soul and spirit with the miracle known of life, every type of creature, and creation.    My perception, life begins at conception. An egg and sperm unite, two become one, and then grow into form. That one cell develops into every cell in our body, every organ, every feature - just an absolute incredible process.     I think every one has to make their own choice - but I am pro-life.    Our Children are our children, they should listen to their parents. They are the responsibility of their respective parents until an appropriate age determined within maturity, and legally (in my state, as this varies by state) to the age of 18 yrs. old.

That is a totally outrageous statement and 'Due in March' needs to edit or remove that!    Human life does begin by the joining of cells that quickly multiply to form a human body - in just 12 weeks!  Its a totally awesome process.  At just 10 weeks pregnant the Doctor traced my baby's heart beat!   Amazing.  It shocks me how anyone can consider that it is not life just cos it would have very little chance of surviving outside the womb.    I read a story too - maybe it was the same one as you - a woman took some tablets to try and abort a feotus but it did not die and she gave birth to a very premature little life that was looked after and nursed until she grew, put weight on etc and then was adopted.      The thing about pro-choice is there is a choice and I do agree that women have a choice - however the choice goes back a few steps to when they are in the throws of passion with the man - the choice to use contraception - or abstain - rather than think 'oh well if I do get pregnant I can always have an abortion'.|`|8cuPVvYnaa	Interesting question.

Doesnt it strick you as something odd, that the ancient Jewish never believed in hell or the after life? So if there is no after life there couldnt be hell?    (Ecclesiastes 9:5) For the living are conscious that they will die; but as for the dead, they are conscious of nothing at all, neither do they anymore have wages, because the remembrance of them has been forgotten.    (Ecclesiastes 9:10) All that your hand finds to do, do with your very power, for there is no work nor devising nor knowledge nor wisdom in Sheol, the place to which you are going.    (Psalm 146:4) His spirit goes out, he goes back to his ground; In that day his thoughts do perish.    Jesus being of Jewish decesnt would have held these view too.    Now with that in mind. Where did hell come from? Didnt the Greeks and Romans have a concept of Hell? They had the Underworld controled by the God Hades. The Romans adopted this way of thinking and so did the early Roman Catholic Church which i may add started after the Apostles died. After the apostles died the last one around 98 or 99AD the tide of Apostasy and false teaching swept thru the Christians Church.    Hell and the Afterlife does not exist if you truely go with what the Bible say, but you follow 'Orthodox' Theology then you've been lied to.    Take for example Rev L J. He's a Reverand and he doesnt quote the bible but insteads says that God created Hell. WHere does it say that? Trust me i've read the Bible and NOWHERE does it say that. What kind of Reverand doesent quote the Bible?  1 John 4:16 - God is love  With this in mind, why would a God of Love, torture people?

VRl1jENHaa	Primo, you've gotten several good answers, but they've all given the impression that there will be just ONE "in-gathering."  Actually, the Scriptures tell us there will be TWO; we are near the end of the first one at this very moment.    But first of all, it's worth mentioning that this promise is based entirely upon the unilateral "Land Covenant" that God made with Abraham.  I say "unilateral" because Abraham didn't participate, nor is the Jews' obedience required in order for God to provide it.  Instead, the fulfillment of the Land Covenant relies ENTIRELY upon God's faithfulness.  With that understood, we can now look at the Scriptural proof that there are TWO re-gatherings:    1)  The re-gathering in preparation for judgment (also referred to as "the return in unbelief"):  the most explicit prophecy that indicates the Jews would be re-gathered in preparation for God's wrath is found at Ezekiel 20:33-38:    33 As I live, says the Lord GOD, surely with a mighty hand, with an outstretched arm, and with fury poured out, I will rule over you. 34 I will bring you out from the peoples and gather you out of the countries where you are scattered, with a mighty hand, with an outstretched arm, and with fury poured out. 35 And I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples, and there I will plead My case with you face to face. 36 Just as I pleaded My case with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will plead My case with you, says the Lord GOD.  37 I will make you pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant; 38 I will purge the rebels from among you, and those who transgress against Me; I will bring them out of the country where they dwell, but they shall not enter the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am the LORD."    In these verses, Ezekiel draws a similie with the Exodus when, under Moses, God brought the entire nation of Israel out of the land of Egypt and into the wilderness of the Sinai desert.  God's plan when He did that was two-fold:  they were to RECEIVE HIS LAW via the Mosaic Covenant, and they were to build a Tabernacle, through which God would live among them.  But as you know, there was rebellion and the majority of the adults alive at that time never made it into the Promised Land.  But THIS TIME, Ezekiel prophesies God will gather His people from around the world in preparation for His wrath -- which will ensure they accept the New Covenant and experience His actual presence among them (within the Forth Temple).    Other key prophesies making the same point are:  Ezekiel 39:7 & 21-24 (which emphasizes judgement); Ezekiel 22:17-22; Eze. 36:22-24; and Zephaniah 2:1-2.    This first re-gathering began after WWII, when the Zionist Movement purchased parts of Israel and continues today.  However, Israeli census information shows that the numbers of Jews moving to Israel is greatly dwindling; eventually, it will cease during the mid-point of the Tribulation.  Interestingly, th census ALSO proves that the majority of Israeli Jews are not religious; many are atheists.  This gives concrete proof that God is still working on the first re-gathering.      2)  The re-gathering in preparation for God's blessing (also known as "the return due to belief"):  The second re-gathering begins after the end of the Tribulation.  At that time, all Jews remaining alive have received Jesus as Messiah; none who continued to reject Him will have survived the Tribulation.  They will ALL be righteous (Jeremiah 50:20,  Isaiah 4:3-6 & Romans 11:26).    The primary Scripture is Deut. 30:1-10, but it's WAY too long to quote here.  As you read it, note that the re-gathering occurs from all over the world, so God cannot be referring to the Babylonian captivity; He can ONLY be referring to the "diaspora," the dispursion that occured after 70 AD.    Other key Scriptures are Isaiah 11:11 - 12:6 (notice God says He would "set His hand again the SECOND TIME to recover the remnant of His people ..."  Again, this CANNOT refer to the re-gathering after the Babylonian captivity, since that was not a world-wide dispursion); Isaiah 27:12-13; Isaiah 43:5-7; Jeremiah 16:14-15; Jeremiah 23:3-4 & 7-8; Jeremiah 31:7-10; and Ezekiel 39:25-29 (which emphasizes re-gathering AFTER judgement).|`|VyR7efSHaa	Hon - I'm sailing through Y!A quickly - and wanted to give this reference: http://www.ifcj.org/site/PageNavigator/e...

Then it moves on to the great multitude in white robes.  I'm not sure if this is what you're asking about but it does talk about the different tribes of Israel.    God has said to Israel numerous times, "I will never leave or forsake you" which implies that they are STILL part of His plan. No matter what else happens.|`|NZ0mRaG3aa	I think Jews call it the aliyah.    There were promises made about the Jews returning from Babylon in their exile there.    Jesus said Jerusalem would be trampled on until the end of the time of the gentiles. Implying somewhat a revival of the Jewish state and nation after a long time of being badly treated and under subjugation to others; since they did not know the time of the Messiah's visitation and rejected him there was to be another Babylonian type exile according to Jesus.    Some prophecies in the Bible about the Messiah speak of his coming (2nd coming from the christian view) being in defence of an assailed Jerusalem and Judaea - eg Zechariah 12 (at leaast that's how I interpret  things; although I am no scholar.) So the Jews would have to be back in their land for that.    This is not to say that Jews have got back in their land in the most decent way - they are not more righteous than others, although certainly they have been one of the most picked-upon peoples historically. But even if some aspects of Israel's re-foundation seem very intolerant, it is true that most people movements - invasions, wars of conquest etc - are pretty unpleasant due to human selfishness. God can will the return to happen, but human freedom means human sins, but God isn't directly responsible for them.    God is honouring his promise to bless Abraham's physical descendants. Jesus is the Saviour of course, and some of the promises to Abraham were phrased by God so that whereas there is a physical blessing on Israel the ultimate blessing is on the ultimate 'seed' of Abraham - the Messiah and perfect one Jesus. We are considered to be that spiritual seed when we believe in Jesus as his standing with God is made ours.|`|AA10057370	Romans 10:         9That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.      10For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.      11For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.      12For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.      13For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.|`|rd6XkoG5aa	?|`|d0d7b35a707f98e4d94fb32cc3b60b5baa	Where do you dig up this rubbish ?|`|AA10641825	Lord god almighty, some of the questions on here --  .|`|bMJ0AYI1aa	i'm jewish, and there's no such thing as an in-gathering. we don't believe that jesus was the christ, we don't believe we need salvation. we don't believe in hell or final judgment or salvation or christian sin.

On Item 3 above no one is "saved" automatically no matter what race or ethnicity they are.    1st the issue of the Jews being scattered:    Moses prophesied it in Deuteronomy 28:64 as well as the Prophet Hosea in Hosea 9:17    In both cases the prediction was that the Jews would be scattered among the nations.     Now the Jews have been captured and taken away in captivity but those were always to one Nation, Assyria or Babylon. It was not until Rome got tired of all the revolts there and between 70AD and 135AD systematically kicked them out of the area that they were truly dispersed among the nations. In fact it was a crime punishable by death for a Jew to return to "Palestine" after 135AD while Rome was still in power.    Isaiah (Isaiah 11) and Ezekiel (Ezekiel 36 and 37) both prophesied the eventual return of Israel to a "Jewish" homeland.    The Zionist movement began to build in the late 1800's and culminated in the rebirth of the Nation of Israel in one day as prophesied in Isaiah 66:7-8.    The only thing is the process is still ongoing, it is not complete. The largest population of Jews outside Israel is in the US today.    This will change with the Gog Magog War in Ezekiel 38 and 39. When a host of nations come together to destroy Israel God will reveal himself again and all Jews not in Israel will move to Israel and as a Nation they will reestablish their Old Covenant relationship with God.    Once this happens God will begin to work and show them that Jesus is their promised Messiah and they will eventually come to realize this and accept it.    Keep in mind this focus is on a national level not individual. Individual Jews do come to Jesus and are saved.|`|jsM8F4bLaa	doesn't Israel already exist?|`|195b26e117ae8210ddab7caefa642937aa	Yes Romans 11 speaks of a remnant of Isreal the Lord is going to save.

Zechariah 12:9-14 (KJV)   9 And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.   10 And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications: and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn.   11 In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon.   12 And the land shall mourn, every family apart; the family of the house of David apart, and their wives apart; the family of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart;   13 The family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart; the family of Shimei apart, and their wives apart;   14 All the families that remain, every family apart, and their wives apart.

Also, the dude is gay because during a critical stage in fetal development his testicles failed to produce enough testosterone to re-wire the section of the brain that determines which gender you are attracted to.      All men start out with a female brain but the testosterone makes changes to the areas that have receptors for that neurotransmitter.  If not enough testosterone is produced at the critical time(for example through a trauma during pregnancy) than the man is stuck with a brain that is attracted to men.

Scripture also says He performed His first miracle when He started His public ministry at age 30, when He changed water into wine.

AA11987172	Helping others means humbling yourself.    Condemning things like homosexuality is a way for a person to lift themself up by putting another down.      I guess *some* Xtians (like their god) have an ego problem.  This would also explain the arrogance in thinking their way of thinking/believing is the ONLY way...    ;)|`|ulwXFrrJaa	Jesus said he would judge the hypocrite harder than the sinner.      All the people who call themselves Christian who don't heed "judge not lest ye be judged" might want to start looking for a good defense lawyer for judgement day.|`|Ex4Lv68yaa	"Bravo."  :)|`|jsM8F4bLaa	Jeff S, you do know that there are verses "around" that when it comes to judging right?|`|Fdo2G5BZaa	I am not aware of any "scientifically proved" facts that are opposed by any of The True Christian Faith.... All The word of God says is that God did it... and that includes every "law" which governs the various functions of the entire universe... The Word does not say how God did it... that is one of the challenges God has given us... to figure out how He did  it...  Christians need to oppose the corruption and misuse of science... which we do... not the honest examination and learning of What God has done. Which is what honest science is(even if the "scientist" may not believe in God)    homosexual acts are an abomination(sin) to God... homosexuals are free to come to God in The Way He prescribes just as are heterosexuals... homosexuals just want a special deal just for them, and God will not do that.... God makes The Rules...|`|789648a8b3c9e5c8bfae95900bfc85b3aa	I think that if there is a god, you'd have to wonder what god it is...is it the god of the old testament?  The one that is offended by census taking to the point of killing 70,000 innocent people?  Or the one that Jesus talks about?  If you pick the latter, then you are stuck because there is very little in popular evangelical thought today that actually represents the will of Jesus as depicted in the bible.  When conservative christians are flocking to people full of hate like Rush Limbaugh, you have to conclude that nobody read any of the "red letter" portions of the new testament.    I think that it would be more pleasing to that god for people to take care of one another.  To take from each what they can give and to provide to each by their need...like the communal living conditions described in the book of Acts.      The tentets of a faith that is based on the resurrection of Jesus really ought to pay more attention to the words of Jesus, I would think.  That would make god pleased.  Unfortunately, what is preached over and over is old testament power, anger and vengence.  Not the doctrine of Jesus.|`|u4af7B2Iaa	That's right.

Also, careful reading of my short comment would alert you to the fact that I was referring to an instance where I "responded" to a question which bashed the President.  Sorry for any confusion.

Edit for "Latern...": Ha! The Bible is, from beginning to end, a flat Earth book. The Bible makes repeated references to "the pillars of the Earth." According to the New Testament, everyone will be able to see Jesus upon his return. This is only possible with a flat Earth. King Nebuchadnezzar is represented by a tree so high that anyone on Earth could see it. Again, a concept only possible with a flat Earth. During the conversation between Jesus and Satan, Satan takes Jesus to a mountaintop. Satan promises Jesus control of all the kingdoms of the world - which Jesus was able to see standing on the mountain top. Again, this is only possible with a flat Earth. The "circle of the Earth" refers only to the shape of the Earth.

yJmjg9sEaa	Black people are as smart today as they ever have been -- that is, there is a range of intelligence among people of all races. No one race or ethnicity is smarter on average, nor is any one race more likely to produce persons of either above average or below average intelligence. It is fair to say that African-Americans today are better educated, on average, than in any previous period of American history. (There were a number of African kingdoms and city-states pre-dating the establishment of the United States in which literacy and scholarship were common, however, especially -- but by no means only -- in areas influenced by Islam.)    I don't believe it's accurate to say that Black people have ever been "okay with" being criticized, insulted or discriminated against by any church (or any other institution). Dr. King encouraged people of all races, religious beliefs and nationalities -- particularly, but not exclusively, Black Christian Americans -- to stand up to and speak out against injustice and discrimination of all kinds.    As to the question "Why did God wait about 150 years or so to do it from 1820-1978?" ... There are several different answers to this question, but no way for us to know which is correct. One explanation could be that the early LDS leaders misunderstood God's message, and so God was correcting their mistake, not His own. Another might be that God felt the people who first received the revelations in the Book of Mormon were not ready to accept Black believers as their equals until after the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s changed the nature of race relations in America. Non-Mormons would more likely say that, just as many other denominations' predicted a date for the Second Coming that is now many years in the past (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unfulfilled... for some examples) but continued on -- sometimes picking another date which also passed uneventfully -- the leaders of the LDS church simply changed their doctrine when it became obvious that what they had formerly said had been wrong. There could of course be many other explanations as well.|`|H8WqMK1eaa	LMAO!    I'm sorry.  ((wipes the tears away))    That was too good.

Acredito que isso varia de um indivduo para o outro.   Eu, partircularmente acredito que briga por coisas materiais n?o levam a nada, e nunca precisei de religi?o para isso.   Muitas pessoas apenas se escondem por trs de uma religi?o, e esse  o pior tipo de pessoa que existe, o "Fa?a o que eu digo, mas n?o fa?a o que eu fa?o", ou seja, o que tem muito no mundo  falso moralista. (Independente de religi?o).  N?o me recordo de ter brigado com familiar ou amigo por ter quebrado isso ou aquilo, claro que me preocupo, n?o pelo objeto, mas pela possibilidade da pessoa se machucar.  Vale a pena lembrar que o muitos Crist?os, e acredito que na maioria protestantes relacionam tanto dinheiro com ben??os divinas, e pregam tanto a prosperidade material. Mas porque fazem isso se Jesus nunca foi rico?   claro que ter conforto  bom, mas tambm tem limites, e  interessante notar que um pas Crist?o como os EUA e a outro n?o Crist?o, a China, n?o tem o menor respeito pelo ambiente, de forma que me leva a crer que a religi?o, s serve mesmo para o benefcio de seus lderes, esquecendo do povo.   Abra?os.|`|NeXRZGVraa	Querido, o que falta na humanidade, eh COMPAIXAO.    Ninguem precisa de amor, mas todo mundo precisa de compaixao, ateh os animais.  O operario cogitou que a mocinha fosse americna.  Poderia ser sueca, alema ou portuguesa.    Realmente o povo americano eh um povo de expresao fria, vivo com essas gente ha varias decadas.  Mas no meu Brasil, e, em muitos outros paises onde pisei, existe muita frieza e egoismo para com o proximo.    Porem, existem grupos humanos, onde ha irmandade e compaixao:  Cubanos,  Irmandade Galega, o povo oriundo da Galizia, Espanha.

f3SyOyMEaa	Don't even worry about ridiculous comments like that. I don't care how devoted of a Christian someone is, they would also be afraid in those type of situations. The people that say that if you put all of your trust in God that you have nothing to fear, more than likely haven't been in those type of situations or are judgmental...which of course is not very Christian like.  Being a Christian does not make you fearless at all times.|`|pxgIsS0Maa	Perhaps they are wrong... or, perhaps what they mean is you need to put your FAITH in God.

Real Christians wouldn't judge you like that. I'm a Christian and I have a real fear of snakes and we have the nasty rattler here in California. Believe me when I say that I believe in God but I also believe that if I were ever bitten it would hurt like the very devil and would probably be a painful death. There are far too many "wanna be Christians" and too few real Christians.|`|0yTM98Odaa	Don't worry I'm Christian and I fear the way I'm going to die.  Like you I don't fear the afterwards part but the process of dying.  Dying isn't always a peaceful experience like with people who die in their sleep.  I bet those who said what they said to you will have the same fear in their dieing process.

O que voc pode fazer tambm ( alm desta pergunta ) se voc ainda se sentir constrangida,  escrever um e-mail particular aos seus amigos mais prximos, aos quais voc entende que tenham se ofendido, ou escandalizado.  Mas creia-me, os amigos verdadeiros com certeza ir?o entend-la muito bem.  Acho sim que voc deve colocar um limite ao seu filho, um corretivo, que nem sempre significa surra, mas que ele aprenda a conhecer os limites e liberdades de cada um, ele n?o pode e n?o deve mexer naquilo que  seu, mesmo que seja um site; se preciso for, abra um perfil do Y!R para ele e deixe claro que isso  invas?o de privacidade, ele com certeza n?o gostar de ter a sua invadida e assim aprender que mais tarde, n?o poder invadir a de ningum.   em casa que nossos filhos aprendem aquilo que se deve fazer ou n?o, portanto, voc est no caminho certa querida.

Mais  bom ter um dialogo aberto com ele, pois ele mostrou nas pergunta o que ele pensa de voc. Ent?o,  necessrio voc conversar muito com ele, pois, na prxima vez possa ser que seja tarde demais, quero dizer: ele fazer um estrago que n?o tenha conserto.  Mais, n?o esque?a  melhor ele chorar hoje por voc do que voc amanh? chorar por ele.  Disciplina sim, mais repleta de carinho e amor.  Kiron L.do S.|`|rOg4Clvkaa	Ol Dandara querida!!!  N?o precisa se desculpar querida, quem te conhece sabe que voc tem uma boa ndole, as vezes em nossas vidas acontecem algumas coisas desagradvel para tirar nosso bom humor, mas sabemos quando uma pessoa  de m f e quem  de boa f, voc sempre teve uma otma participa??o no Yr, ent?o quem te conhece nem respondeu as perguntas que foram excludas, porque sabiam que n?o era sua!!!  Esfrie a cabe?a e converse com seu filho, adolecente sempre d alguns probleminhas, eles querem chamar aten??o de alguma forma!!!  Tenha um timo domingo querida!!!  Beijos!!!|`|CzmiWz41aa	s agora pude vir aki.bom eu te conhe?o ha pouco mas te acho legal.ta bom.beijos|`|xVFwK2awaa	Ol, Danda!  Blz? Primeiro quero agradecer pelas msgs, muito boas, positivas, pena n?o conseguir retribuir pois o meu Yahoo!Mail deve estar com algum problema no envio, volta sempre para mim uma notifica??o de erro, email n?o enviado.    Bom, vamos falar sobre esse seu Y!R?   (a) Nunca chame seu filho de aborrecente ou quaisquer outro nome pesado, isso s atrai negatividades, na sua desenvoltura    (b) Sei que vc ficou de cabe?a quente, pois houve um erro da parte dele mas ele lhe pediu desculpas. Lembre-se somos os herois e melhores amigos deles (filhos)., o mundo acabou por causa disso??? relax, amiga.    (c) Com certeza j deu para eu perceber que vc e sua familia s?o pessoas do bem, e garanto que ai esteve o dedo do sujo do "Inimigo", ou seu filho queria chamar "aten??o" !    (d) Agora como ele te conhece, Danda, sabe at que te irrita! Agora um pergunta: Voce tava na TPM, n?o n? Porque minha esposa tem esse probleminha, vixee!!! como sofro.    (e) Corrigir o filho? Com certeza, errou paga, sem agress?es, castigo, tire o que ele gosta, aqui em casa corto, brincar na rua, computador, televis?o, e etc.    (g) Quanto ao ajudar em casa seja cautelosa, mostre quem comanda, e administra a casa. Sofro tbm, tenho um rapaz de 18 anos, o mas velho, pregui?oso, mas um bom filho, t? sempre puxando as orelhas dele, e o cara e grandao, neg?o mesmo, maior que eu, mas uso de sabedoria aprendi com as historias do "Davi e Golias" , "Rei Arthur" e o "Pequeno Principe"    (h) Quanto a vergonha que passou, besteira sua, seus amigos n?o deram a mnima, pois est?o aqui lhe dando a "Luz" que tanto precisas.    Agora amiga muito cuidado, nossas palavras, nossas a??es as vezes influenciam muito na forma??o de nossos filhos, e sei que vc junto com seu marido e os amigos aqui, v?o conseguir mostra o que  certo e o que errado para ele, mas sente com ele todos os dias, perde seu tempo com o "cara" sen?o o mundo vai devor-lo. Pede a ele por na balan?a o que vc tem de bom e de ruim,  o que ta faltando, para que vc tbm possa se consertar.     Eu outro dia sentei para conversar com meus dois filhos, (12 e 18 anos) onde to errando onde to acertando com vcs? Falaram tudo, ou quase tudo! Peguei uma lata de nescau ,uma tabua, dois pratos de plastico, tres kg de feijao (lado bom) e 1 kg de arroz (lado mau), perguntei quem tem o peso maior, ambos reponderam o "O lado bom, feij?o". e ai deu resultado. Minhas virtudes maiores que meus vicios.    Muita luz n?o s para vc para vc, mas pra familia inteira, bjuss, boa semana.|`|JbgP1poGaa	deixa ele sem o pc e obriga a comer legumes

4b6b23bf337d9e8f6d3e5fcb502f33cfaa	Il y a s?rement des raisons historiques  cela, mais je ne saurais pas te les donner.  En tout cas, l'allemand est en effet largement majoritaire en Suisse (63,7%) par rapport au fran?ais (20,4%) et  litalien (6,5%), toutes trois langues nationales. Sans parler du romanche, quatrime langue nationale, qui subsiste tant bien que mal  quelques endroits seulement, malgr son statut de langue nationale.   On peut bien voir la rpartition des langues sur la carte que j'ai mise en source. Moi, j'habite non loin de Fribourg et de Morat, pour ainsi dire donc sur la "frontire linguistique".   Il est clair que la ma?trise de l'allemand est un atout majeur en Suisse et nous, Romands (= Suisses francophones), l'apprenons depuis la 4e anne de l'cole primaire. En principe, les Suisses almaniques font de mme pour le fran?ais. Souvent, ces derniers s'expriment plus facilement en fran?ais que nous en allemand, car il ne faut pas oublier qu'il y a un obstacle majeur : le dialecte. Les Almaniques s'expriment dans divers dialectes suisses allemands qu'il est souvent difficile de comprendre mme si on ma?trise l'allemand. Quand je suis en Suisse almanique, j'essaie de m'exprimer en allemand, les gens me comprennent bien s?r, mais il faut parfois leur demander de faire l'effort de parler le "bon allemand" pour que je les comprenne moi aussi.|`|CyjThb9jaa	parce que sur trois ville principales; deux sont de langue allemand:  Zurich, et Bern, Gneve est de langue francophone.|`|cX9Hyclzaa	Va voir le site de wikipedia pour trouver une explication aprs lecture et comprhension.  http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suisse|`|63456df29ba368e1d3356ee5341ab589aa	Les premiers Suisses (Uri, Schwyz et Unterwald) taient des Alamans, c'est  dire des Germains du Sud.

Whh4a9Odaa	If you speak up you risk being made fun of or ridiculed. If you don't, you might be mad at yourself for saying nothing. Maybe instead of telling them that their being racist, you might want to make a kind of joke, like "well Obama's black but at least he .... better than McCain." I wouldn't go for anything heartfelt or lecture them because they won't appreciate it. I think people respond better to a more carefree remark in these situations.|`|bJnqYE6maa	This is what happens when you talk about politics at work.  Especially in America, where politics is polarized and divisive... and so many people act like rednecks.

Analisai a Deus e ao diabo do vulgo; encontrareis no Deus o ideal poetizado do diabo e no diabo a caricatura de Deus". Eliphas Levi    "Ent?o, h mais culpveis? Todos os homens s?o inocentes; os anjos das trevas s?o os servidores da mscara Divina, a penalidade  uma injusti?a, a moral  uma trapa?a estendida aos dbeis para faz-los escravos dos fortes, os malvados s?o os mais poderosos auxiliares da virtude e o justo lhes deve suas coroas? N?o sentes, senhor, que a doutrina t?o monstruosa  subversiva de toda ordem e que, por conseguinte,  contrria a toda verdade, porque a ordem  a verdade e o que  desordem  a mentira?. Eliphas Levi    "O paraso da alma  a raz?o satisfeita; seu inferno a loucura irritada". Eliphas levi      "O mal  o solu?o eterno da humanidade que se contorce e chora,  a risada atroz do mau oprimindo o justo, s?o as profundezas infernais que se abrem dentro de ns e que em todas as almas cava, por um instante, o gnio da perversidade. O mal moral existe: reina em certos espritos,  encarna-se em certos homens; estes s?o os dem?nios. E para aqueles que duvidam da existncia do diabo respondemos: tudo o que tem um nome existe; a palavra pode ser proferida em v?o, mas em si mesma ela n?o poderia ser v? e tem sempre um sentido. O Verbo nunca  vazio."  Eliphas Levi     "Tudo o que tem um nome existe; a palavra pode ser proferida em v?o, mas em si mesma ela n?o poderia ser v? e tem sempre um sentido. O Verbo nunca  vazio."

Ora, as trevas n?o convivem com a luz e Deus  Luz. Se voc acender uma vela, a escurid?o n?o existir.   Quem interpretar os textos bblico ao p da letra, vai encontrar muitos absurdos se analis-los a luz da raz?o.  Lembre-se que h palavras em portugus, por exemplo, que mudaram o sentido em poucos anos e outras caram em desuso. Agora, imagine palavras de uma lngua morta, ditas h milnios, quando n?o existia gravador, nem taqugrafos, nem reprteres, e que foram escritas muito depois de terem sido proferidas.

Muitas s?o super contraditrias mesmo. Acho que isso depende muito das convic??es particulares da pessoa. Mas uma coisa  certa. N?o h como fechar quest?o de forma racional, pois a blia est cheia de metforas, sem contar que as tradu??es tm significados diversos, dependendo de cada autor.  Cada doutrina tenta se balisar no texto bblico, mas sempre h muitas lacunas que n?o se consegue explicar de forma satisfatria.  Eu creio em Deus por uma convic??o pessoal que  sentida e n?o racionalizada, nem foi incutida na minha cabe?a por nenhum tipo de sacerdote.

No entanto, espero que tenhamos sido tambm manifestados s vossas conscincias. ?N?o nos recomendamos novamente a vs, mas damo-vos um induzimento  jactancia com respeito a ns, a fim de que tenhais uma resposta para os que se jactam da aparncia externa, mas n?o do cora??o. ?Pois, se n?o tivemos bom juzo, foi para Deus; se temos bom juzo,  para vs. ?Pois o amor de Cristo nos compele, porque foi isso o que julgamos, que um s homem morreu por todos; de modo que, ent?o, todos tinham morrido; ?e ele morreu por todos, para que os que vivem n?o vivessem mais para si mesmos, mas para aquele que morreu por eles e foi levantado.    ?Por conseguinte, doravante n?o conhecemos mais a nenhum homem segundo a carne.

Eis que agora  o tempo especialmente aceitvel. Eis que agora  o dia de salva??o.    ?De modo algum damos qualquer causa para trope?o, para que n?o se ache falta no nosso ministrio; ?mas, recomendamo-nos de todo modo como ministros de Deus, na perseveran?a em muito, em tribula??es, em necessidades, em dificuldades, ?em espancamentos, em pris?es, em desordens, em labores, em noites sem dormir, em tempos sem comida, ?pela pureza, pelo conhecimento, pela longanimidade, pela benignidade, por esprito santo, pelo amor livre de hipocrisia, ?pela palavra veraz, pelo poder de Deus; por intermdio das armas da justi?a  direita e  esquerda, ?por intermdio de glria e de desonra, atravs de relatos maus e de relatos bons; como enganadores, e ainda assim verazes, ?como desconhecidos, e ainda assim reconhecidos, como morrendo, e ainda assim, eis que vivemos, como disciplinados, e ainda assim n?o entregues  morte, ?como pesarosos, mas sempre alegres, como pobres, mas enriquecendo a muitos, como n?o tendo nada, e ainda assim possuindo todas as coisas.

Itropoetina.... ela ajuda a estimular os globulos vermelhos.. os medicos aprenderam tbm que o corpo humano suporta niveis de anemia menore que 10.. pode chagar aos 8 sem problema...    Mas talvez o mdico diga: OU TOMA, OU MORRE!!!  Eu perguntaria para o mdico o seguinte:  Se a situa??o for realmente t?o grave, poder o mdico garantir que o paciente n?o morrer se tomar sangue?  Se a situa??o  t?o, grave.... pode o mdico me garantir que ele sobreviver caso tome sangue?    Outros talvez digam: Deixaria seu filho morrer?  Desejamos o melhor tratamento para nossos filhos, assim como tenho certeza de que todo pai ou toda m?e que tem amor o desejaria. Se que quisesse que ele morresse deixaria ele em casa... Mas, como quero o MELHOR.....  levo no hospital, e o sangue n?o  o melhor.... O MELHOR  ALTERNATIVAS. S?o mais seguras.

Quando a perda de sangue  considervel, o prprio corpo lan?a grandes reservas de glbulos brancos no sistema e acelera a produ??o de novos glbulos. Mas h necessidade do volume do lquido.

N?o precisamos ter medo de Satans ou de seus agentes humanos. (Mat. 10:28)  verdade que alguns destes talvez tenham o poder de causar o mal, at mesmo a morte. No entanto, o pior que eles podem fazer ainda  temporrio. Jeov pode anular, e de fato anular, qualquer dano causado a seus servos fiis, at mesmo ressuscitando-os. S ele tem o poder de tirar a vida e toda a perspectiva de vida futura, destruindo tanto a alma como o corpo na Geena. Felizmente, Jeov n?o deseja que isso nos aconte?a. (2?Ped. 3:9) Temos a vida eterna  nossa frente, desde que permane?amos fiis, e n?o h nada que Satans ou seus comparsas possam fazer quanto a isso. ?Sal. 118:6; Heb. 13:6.

Estima-se que s nos EUA cerca 500.000 pessoas por ano contraem o vrus hepatite C...     Meu caro.. Muitos mdicos j chegaram a conclus?o que cirurgias sem sangue  menos ariscada.... alm de ser mais barata...    pois se um paciente contrair virus ou vier a morrer .. gastar?o muito para cura-lo ou indenizar a familia.

Mas talvez o mdico diga: OU TOMA, OU MORRE!!!  Eu perguntaria para o mdico o seguinte:  Se a situa??o for realmente t?o grave, poder o mdico garantir que o paciente n?o morrer se tomar sangue?  Se a situa??o  t?o, grave.... pode o mdico me garantir que ele sobreviver caso tome sangue?    Outros talvez digam: Deixaria seu filho morrer?  Desejamos o melhor tratamento para nossos filhos, assim como tenho certeza de que todo pai ou toda m?e que tem amor o desejaria. Se que quisesse que ele morresse deixaria ele em casa...

A Cyclop?dia (Ciclopdia) de MClintock e Strong (1881, Vol.?III, p.?774) diz:  bem conhecido que os judeus, ao elaborarem suas tabelas genealgicas, levavam em conta apenas os var?es, rejeitando o nome da filha quando o sangue do av? era transmitido ao neto por uma filha, e contando o marido desta filha em lugar do filho do av? materno (Nm. xxvi, 33; xxvii, 4-7). Sem dvida,  por este motivo que o historiador Lucas diz que Jos era filho de Eli. ?Lu 3:23.    Maria era da tribo de Jud e descendente de Davi. Por isso, podia-se dizer que o filho dela, Jesus, procedeu do descendente [literalmente: semente] de Davi segundo a carne. (Ro 1:3) Atravs de seu pai adotivo, Jos, descendente de Davi, Jesus tinha o direito legal ao trono de Davi, e atravs de sua m?e, como descendncia, descendente [semente] e raiz de Davi, ele tinha o direito hereditrio natural ao trono de Davi, seu pai. ?Mt 1:1-16; Lu 1:32; At 13:22,?23; 2Ti 2:8; Re 5:5; 22:16.

LA Times, Wednesday 29 October 1997         SCIENTISTS believe they have discovered a "God module" in the brain which could be responsible for man's evolutionary instinct to believe in religion.    A study of epileptics who are known to have profoundly spiritual experiences has located a circuit of nerves in the front of the brain which appears to become electrically active when they think about God.    The scientists said that although the research and its conclusions are preliminary, initial results suggest that the phenomenon of religious belief is "hard-wired" into the brain.    Epileptic patients who suffer from seizures of the brain's frontal lobe said they frequently experience intense mystical episodes and often become obsessed with religious spirituality.    A team of neuroscientists from the University of California at San Diego said the most intriguing explanation is that the seizure causes an overstimulation of the nerves in a part of the brain dubbed the "God module".    "There may be dedicated neural machinery in the temporal lobes concerned with religion. This may have evolved to impose order and stability on society," the team reported at a conference last week.    The results indicate that whether a person believes in a religion or even in God may depend on how enhanced is this part of the brain's electrical circuitry, the scientists said.    Dr Vilayanur Ramachandran, head of the research team, said the study involved comparing epileptic patients with normal people and a group who said they were intensely religious. |`|C4x2J38eaa	Actually, there is good evidence emerging that religion does or did have a significant evolutionary value.

Feelings are also built in reactions, they fall into the line of the *but why ?* in us all.... Old stories can NOT prove anything, God, science, history, etc., it is the ability to have the *faith*, oooopsie I used the word, that those *stories* are just what they seem to be, to each of us as individuals or as a group .... Proof of anything lies with each persons beliefs, trust, up bringing, individual experiences, reactions to situations, etc...... there is no ONE proof for us all !!!!!!! go in peace....

They figured something was in charge so they started sacrificing animals and people in order to appease this entity that was controlling everything. Even today some/most people are afraid of death and other natural unknown things so they need some emotional crutch to deal with this. They still use this belief system to ease their suffering and uncertainty.  Those with more education/power figured out long ago how to take this need for prayer and make it into agency of power and control to keep the common people down and less educated. They made up stories and wrote books and forbade the people to question any of the words. They controlled all the sciences, education and birth control so the common people would always be kept in the dark, burdened with too many children and constantly struggling. Sound familiar? It's still happening today.        And this is passed on from parent to child. I figured out at 8 years old that this could not be the truth.

If I'm not mistaken close to a billion people worldwide tuned in that night to watch, I'm guessing most of them don't know the answer by now.     Christianity was started in a small town in Jerusalem (mt. of Olives) by twelve apostles who witnessed Jesus' ascension to heaven. In a time when there was no TV, no radio, no newspaper and no internet.  Why do you think people to this day are still discussing about Jesus?     The belief in God is not instinct, it's not a gene. It is the power of God preserved in the heart of believers and will continue on to eternity.      Daniel 7:18  In the time of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed, nor will it be left to another people. It will crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end, but it will itself endure forever.  |`|MbGvulmXaa	It's quite complex, first of all religion in an instinct that is passed on. Instinct is a neural stamping. E.g. a bird will build a nest, if the pattern is not correct, that style will die out (Darwin's Theory) until it is perfected, and that neural stamping pattern is passed on to future generations. Man like no other animal knows he/she is going to die, this is a big problem. There has to be a comfort to overcome this, because the strongest instinct is the will to survive. This is also passed on, you would ask why do people lose the will to live, this is a hiccup, in our mixed up instinctual thoughts. If people did not have the will to live, then they would die, before producing offspring. Being and not being is part of our lives, you will not remember after, as you did not remember before, in other words not being-being-not being, you won't know, your existence is now... Now here comes the big twist of it all, why religion? To create control religion was created, and as mentioned was imbedded into our brains. As civilization spread globally different religions clashed with each other. A prime example of this was when an Egyptian Pharaoh tried to create a different God this sent the Egyptians into turmoil, hence, they tried to eradicate his whole name from the line of Pharaohs. Man used this control, the stronger your belief the better the control, Islam is a very controlling religion, where you have to pray 5 times a day. U.S.A would print on their currency in God we Trust. With man discovering what is really in the heavens, this has created some discrepancies with God; more and more people are leaving their religion, or not bothering to pray, because they have become skeptical. Religion controls most wars were started because of religious clashes. Because Muslims have larger families stronger beliefs, willing to give up their lives they will within a few more generations will rule the earth. Enjoy, be kind and help each other this is all we have live life

jez6lGk8aa	Modeling affects popular culture through many avenues, but one of the more significant ways is by establishing a generally-accepted notion of what the ideal body type is for a particular period of time.    For example, during the 1990s, one of the predominant ideal male body types in popular culture was the muscular and sporty type often associated with fitness models.  Male fashion models tended to have athletic builds, and this look spread throughout popular culture.    Currently, very slender male fashion models can be seen far more frequently than they were during the 90s.  Models who would have been viewed as having ideal body types during the 1990s are very likely to be told to slim down by their agencies.  The result is that more slender, less muscular male figures are beginning to permeate popular culture.

(Deu. 5:17) Se, porm, examinar este texto em muitas tradu??es modernas, provavelmente encontrar N?o deves assassinar ou N?o deves cometer assassnio    Jeov notara que os habitantes de Cana? estavam arraigados na iniqidade, sendo moralmente depravados e merecedores de execu??o. (Gn. 15:13-21; Lev. 18:24,?25) Como dono de toda a terra, Deus determinou dar tal terra  na??o de Israel. E, sob a dire??o de lderes que Ele escolheu especialmente, Deus usou Israel para executar seu julgamento sobre os cananeus.  Deu. 9:4,?5; 12:31; Jos. 10:40.    Por isso, ao executar os julgamentos legais e moralmente justos de Jeov, ou ao defender sua terra provida por Deus, os israelitas n?o eram culpados de violar o mandamento: N?o assassinars.    ======================================...    Quando os israelitas saram do Egito e da sua escravid?o naquela terra, eles foram pedir [uma forma do verbo hebr. shal] dos egpcios objetos de prata, e objetos de ouro, e capas. .?.?. e despojaram os egpcios. (x 12:35,?36) No entanto, isto foi feito em harmonia com a ordem e a profecia de Deus, e evidentemente foi encarado como compensa??o justa pelos seus longos anos de trabalho escravo e pelas injusti?as sofridas por eles das m?os dos egpcios. (x 3:21,?22; compare isso com De 15:12-15.)     ======================================...    Jeov Deus permite a opera??o do erro para com aqueles que preferem a falsidade, para que fiquem acreditando na mentira em vez de nas boas novas sobre Jesus Cristo. (2Te 2:9-12) Este princpio  ilustrado pelo que aconteceu sculos antes no caso do Rei Acabe, de Israel. Profetas mentirosos asseguraram a Acabe xito na guerra contra Ramote-Gileade, ao passo que o profeta de Jeov, Micaas, predisse o desastre. Conforme revelado numa vis?o a Micaas, Jeov permitiu que uma criatura espiritual se tornasse um esprito enganoso na boca dos profetas de Acabe. Quer dizer, esta criatura espiritual usou os seus poderes sobre eles de modo que n?o falaram a verdade, mas sim o que eles mesmos queriam dizer e o que Acabe queria ouvir deles. Embora avisado de antem?o, Acabe preferiu ser enganado por essas mentiras e pagou com a vida. ?1Rs 22:1-38; 2Cr?18.    Jeov Deus n?o pode mentir (Nm 23:19; He 6:13-18), e ele odeia a lngua falsa. (Pr 6:16-19) Sua lei dada aos israelitas exigia uma compensa??o pelos danos resultantes duma trapa?a ou duma mentira maldosa. (Le 6:2-7; 19:11,?12) E quem desse falso testemunho devia receber a puni??o que queria infligir a outro por meio das suas mentiras. (De 19:15-21) O conceito de Deus sobre a mentira maldosa, conforme refletido na Lei, n?o mudou. Aqueles que desejam obter a Sua aprova??o n?o podem empenhar-se na prtica da mentira.

PRESENTS:     if your a mom you should get presents for your children the first week for december.hide them in a really good place where your children will never think of to look there. example:                                                        if you have your own bathroom you should put it in the shelf where they can't look for it.it works all the time for 3-6 year olds.  |`|EBDyOPnXaa	There is no right or wrong.

It means that a person has to deny himself absolutely, a kind of death to self. The basic meaning of the Greek word translated disown is to say no; it means to deny utterly. Therefore, if you accept the challenge of the Christian life, you willingly surrender your own ambitions, comfort, desires, happiness, pleasure. In essence, you give your whole life and everything that it involves to Jehovah God for all time. To disown oneself means more than denying oneself certain pleasures now and then. Rather, it means that a person must relinquish ownership of himself to Jehovah. (1?Corinthians 6:19,?20) A person who has disowned himself lives to please, not self, but God. (Romans 14:8; 15:3) It means that every moment of his life, he says no to selfish desires and yes to Jehovah.    To pick up your torture stake, therefore, has serious implications. Carrying a stake is a burden and a symbol of death. The Christian is willing to suffer if need be, or be shamed or tortured or even put to death because of being a follower of Jesus Christ. Jesus said: Whoever does not accept his torture stake and follow after me is not worthy of me. (Matthew 10:38) Not all who suffer are carrying the torture stake. The wicked have many pains but no torture stake. (Psalm 32:10) However, the Christians life is a life of carrying the torture stake of sacrificial service to Jehovah.|`|FYQe54Akaa	To pick up your cross and follow Christ means to count the cost.

We should be asking a different question such as How does God feel about this or that?|`|65653c6c063e99db1f7f272c5c93e006aa	Feelings are not right or wrong, they are just feelings.  What we do with them is where the questions arise.  As we all know feelings change and because of that  we must not allow them to lead instead of our will or chaos will follow.  If we focus on acting on what we believe instead of how we feel the confusion goes away.    To deny yourself is  a method of living, not based on how much you give up, but on acceptance of and willingness to put on the truth of God as spoken of in Ephesians.    By nature we tend to desire things which cripple us in the service to God if we succumb to them.      For example, by saying no to partying all night, or having a few drinks, we are closing a door which if we choose to walk through instead, would ultimately be used to destroy our effectiveness as a witness|`|io7nHB3Oaa	Embrace your feeling, deny your ability to use reason.|`|VPeb2fuTaa	In other words, you must try to do what Jesus would do, even if it's not what you would rather do.

The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8.

Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16.

Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27.

VPeb2fuTaa	Here are some good things to point out:    1.  Most ancient Romans didn't know a lot about Christianity, so they generally assumed Christians were up to no good.  (See source below.)    2.  Jesus bore a strong resemblance to other pagan gods that had been worshiped for centuries--look up information on Mithras and the Isis-Osiris/Horus mythos for more on that.  So they didn't think Christianity was anything special.    3.  Rome was one of the first societies to have religious freedom as we know it today.  People were expected to respect the religions of others.  However, the Christians generally denounced the carving of idols, worshiping of other deities, magic, etc. as evil.  This did not exactly endear them to the Roman authorities, or to the more devout pagans these early Christians encountered.|`|c7pbvYmpaa	google|`|dFBccLExaa	Well, I can tell you that the Roman Pantheon is a direct rip off of the Greek pantheon of deities. ANd that Constantine was the one who ushered in Christianity. Also, they mirrored over a lot of the pagan holidays with Christian ones, to help them convert. And when conversion didn't work, they forced people to change- either with torture or death, but that was later- after the fall of Rome.|`|ef7be53a8ea254bcecc8dd5838cbbbeaaa	Look up the planets, they are named after ancient Roman Gods.|`|9Dq2176oaa	IN TIME the Roman Empire, in which early Christianity began, collapsed. Many historians claim that that collapse was also the time of the final victory of Christianity over paganism. Expressing a different viewpoint, Anglican bishop E.?W.?Barnes wrote: As classical civilization collapsed, Christianity ceased to be the noble faith of Jesus the Christ: it became a religion useful as the social cement of a world in dissolution.The Rise of Christianity.    Before that collapse, during the second, third, and fourth centuries?C.E., history records that in many ways those who claimed to follow Jesus kept themselves separate from the Roman world. But it also reveals the development of apostasy in doctrine, conduct, and organization, just as Jesus and his apostles had foretold. (Matthew 13:36-43; Acts 20:29,?30; 2?Thessalonians 2:3-12; 2?Timothy 2:16-18; 2?Peter 2:1-3, 10-22) Eventually compromises came to be made with the Greco-Roman world, and some who claimed to be Christian adopted the worlds paganism (such as its festivals and its worship of a mother-goddess and a triune god), its philosophy (such as belief in an immortal soul), and its administrative organization (seen in the appearance of a clergy class). It was this corrupted version of Christianity that attracted the pagan masses and became a force that the Roman emperors first tried to stamp out but later came to terms with and endeavored to use to their own ends.    Church historian Augustus Neander showed the risks involved in this new relationship between Christianity and the world. If Christians sacrificed their separateness from the world, the consequence would be a confusion of the church with the world .?.?. whereby the church would forfeit her purity, and, while seeming to conquer, would herself be conquered, he wrote.General History of the Christian Religion and Church, Volume 2, page 161.    This is what happened. In the early fourth century, Roman emperor Constantine tried to use the Christian religion of his day to cement his disintegrating empire. To this end, he granted professed Christians religious freedom and transferred some of the privileges of the pagan priesthood to their clergy class. The New Encyclop?dia Britannica states: Constantine brought the church out of its withdrawal from the world to accept social responsibility and helped pagan society to be won for the church.    CHRISTIANITY was never meant to be a part of this world. (Matthew 24:3,?9; John 17:16) Yet, history books tell us that in the fourth century?C.E., Christianity became the official State religion of the Roman Empire. How did this come about?      From Nero (54-68?C.E.) well into the third century?C.E., all Roman emperors either actively persecuted Christians or permitted the persecution of them. Gallienus (253-268?C.E.) was the first Roman emperor to issue a declaration of tolerance for them. Even then, Christianity was a proscribed religion throughout the empire. After Gallienus, the persecution continued, and under Diocletian (284-305?C.E.) and his immediate successors, it even intensified.      The turning point came early in the fourth century with the so-called conversion to Christianity of Emperor Constantine?I.?Concerning this conversion, the French work ThoNouvelle encyclopdie catholique (ThoNew Catholic Encyclopedia) states: Constantine claimed to be a Christian emperor. In reality, he was baptized only on his deathbed. Nevertheless, in 313?C.E., Constantine and his coemperor, Licinius, issued an edict that granted religious freedom to Christians and pagans alike. The New Catholic Encyclopedia states: Constantines extension of freedom of worship to Christians, which signified that Christianity was recognized officially as a religio licita [lawful religion] beside paganism, was a revolutionary act.      However, The New Encyclop?dia Britannica declares: He [Constantine] did not make Christianity the religion of the empire. French historian Jean-Rmy Palanque, member of the Institute of France, writes: The Roman State .?.?. remained, however, officially pagan. And Constantine, when adhering to the religion of Christ, did not put an end to that situation. In the work The Legacy of Rome, Professor Ernest Barker stated: [Constantines victory] did not result in the immediate establishment of Christianity as the religion of the State. Constantine was content to recognize Christianity as one of the public worships of the empire. For the next seventy years the old pagan rites were officially performed in Rome.      So at this point Christianity was a legal religion in the Roman Empire. When did it become, in the fullest sense of the expression, the official State religion? We read in the New Catholic Encyclopedia: [Constantines] policy was continued by his successors with the exception of Julian [361-363?C.E.], whose persecution of Christianity was brought to an abrupt end by his death. Finally, in the last quarter of the 4th?ce

Sexual orientation is biologically based, not a conscious choice.|`|FpMS47sXaa	I have been researching this topic for almost as long as I have been researching religion.    What I have been able to discover is that it is only taught repression of your natural desires.    No actual cure, just a social and cultural change. Nothing more.      Oh - and there is NO gay lifestyle. That label was created by the far right to put some sort of negative tone on the lives gay people have. Most are just like everyone else. No "lifestyle" is needed.|`|bbEZOoUTaa	I have friends and i know people who had been freed from homosexuality completely, I know a youth pastor he was homosexual, one day God delivered him in a evangelical campaign, now he is married and he has 4 kids, he is the happiest man, he has said.

Would you ask an adulterer whether the other person was still attractive. IF you are going to be a baiter, be a good one.|`|KXQVRQdjaa	AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS 6        * "Confusion about sexual orientation is not unusual during adolescence. Counseling may be helpful for young people who are uncertain about their sexual orientation or for those who are uncertain about how to express their sexuality and might profit from an attempt at clarification through a counseling or psychotherapeutic initiative. Therapy directed at specifically changing sexual orientation is contraindicated, since it can provoke guilt and anxiety while having little or no potential for achieving changes in orientation."      * "Pediatricians should be aware that some of the youths in their care may be homosexual or have concerns about sexual orientation. Caregivers should provide factual, current, nonjudgmental information in a confidential manner."      * "The psychosocial problems of gay and lesbian adolescents are primarily the result of societal stigma, hostility, hatred and isolation. The gravity of these stresses is underscored by current data that document that gay youths account for up to 30 percent of all completed adolescent suicides. Approximately 30 percent of a surveyed group of gay and bisexual males have attempted suicide at least once. Adolescents struggling with issues of sexual preference should be reassured that they will gradually form their own identity and that there is no need for premature labeling of one's sexual orientation."    AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION 7        * "Most of the emotional disturbance experienced by gay men and lesbians around their sexual identity is not based on physiological causes but rather is due more to a sense of alienation in an unaccepting environment. For this reason, aversion therapy (a behavioral or medical intervention which pairs unwanted behavior, in this case, homosexual behavior, with unpleasant sensations or aversive consequences) is no longer recommended for gay men and lesbians. Through psychotherapy, gay men and lesbians can become comfortable with their sexual orientation and understand the societal response to it."       But churches know better, right?    I challenge anyone to follow ALL the rules of the Bible listed alongside Christianity:    When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a pleasing odor for the Lord - Lev.1:9. The problem is my neighbors. They claim the odor is not pleasing to them. Should I smite them?    I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as sanctioned in Exodus 21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her?    I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period of menstrual uncleanliness - Lev.15:19- 24. The problem is, how do I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offense.    Lev. 25:44 states that I may indeed possess slaves, both male and female, provided they are purchased from neighboring nations. A friend of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans, but not Canadians. Can you clarify? Why cant I own Canadians?    I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2 clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself?    A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an abomination - Lev. 11:10, it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality. I dont agree. Can you settle this?    Lev. 21:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses. Does my vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle room here?    Most of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including the hair around their temples, even though this is expressly forbidden by Lev. 19:27. How should they die?    I know from Lev. 11:6-8 that touching the skin of a dead pig makes me unclean, but may I still play football if I wear gloves?    My uncle has a farm. He violates Lev. 19:19 by planting two different crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of two different kinds of thread (cotton/polyester blend). He also tends to curse and blaspheme a lot. Is it really necessary that we go to all the trouble of getting the whole town together to stone them? - Lev.24:10-16. Couldnt we just burn them to death at a private family affair like we do with people who sleep with their in-laws? (Lev. 20:14)|`|8f295aef87b9e8de8081a2868c2aa68faa	i agree w oberon  ...the term "lifestyle" is just silly    edit: Not Of This World - N.O.T.W -...Ted Haggard is married too...and has kids|`|bnPPrJY1aa	People don't change their lifestyle for religion|`|rUgC7SPsaa	Ex-gay?

The question though is how long ago did they really exist?  It was not billions of Years!|`|tTc72fhoaa	It all depends on what you believe about them.  Are you trusting in their existence to convince yourself that there is no God?  If so, then maybe.  Are you simply acknowledging that as far as our science can tell us, they did in fact exist? If so, that can not be a sin.  Believing the truth is the antithesis of sin.  The fact that dinosaurs once lived can tell us that there is more to creation (and the Creator) than we can presently know.|`|AA11849917	When you say "believing", do you mean "believing" as putting your trust in, such as a paratrooper "believes in" (trusts) his parachute?

If, however, you mean the SECOND, I believe that dinosaurs really existed.  What's wrong with THAT?  That's no more of a sin than believing that dodo birds once existed and are now extinct.  So?|`|e4yczpKsaa	If so, I am too.

A-He realized the Four Noble Truths. The True Reality of Nature is-- in this world, there are no animals, person, self, we, or others but only groups of natural elements that temporarily assemble together. The natural elements, which are referred to, are all of Body and Mind.     Because we don't know this reality (Ignorance), we think that we own these Body and Mind (Attachment, Clinging). We also believe that they are good and special. We therefore love them, guard them with zealous care, struggle to make them happy and escape any unhappiness (Craving). But the Body and Mind are subjected to the Three Marks of Existence (Being oppressed, Impermanence and Non-Self). They therefore do not follow our desires, hence the Suffering.     Once we are aware that Body and Mind are not ourselves and that they themselves are Sufferings, we stop craving for happiness and clinging to our Body and Mind as self (Detachment). We give them back to the earth. This is the state of Enlightenment (Nibbana or Nirvana) where all sufferings will be eradicated.    The Enlightenment is a condition that is pure, clean, flawless, immaculate, void, formless, boundless, sublimely tranquil and immortal. Only the Mind can penetrate it. It will be overwhelmed with immense happiness and the tranquility of it is overwhelming to the sky and air and boundless. No molecule can escape the permeation of that feeling.

God will not allow anybody to buy His blessings.  He gives His blessings for FREE.     If you try to buy His blessings, then you probably won't get them.      But if you ask the Lord for His blessings FREELY, then He gives them without measure.     But it starts with you believing the truth about Jesus, who is God.  Because, if you are in a false system like catholicism or something like that, then don't expect God's blessings, ever.     Instead, believe in Jesus in FAITH ALONE.  This is how the Lord blesses.  Then you ask Him to bless you FREELY, apart from anything you do right or wrong.     Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation.     The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|WHi6h06Haa	So sorry for what your going through with your parents and all. But, God loves you so very much.

aWHvHIr1aa	Which Jews are you talking about?      The Tanach observant Jews or the Talmud observant Jews.    The difference between the two is the Tanach observant Jews can hear the voice of God and the Talmud observant Jews can not.    After the completion of the Tanach, the Talmud observant Jews declared that the era of the prophet was over and era of the rabbi had begun.  The historical event that marked the emergence of the Talmud observant was that Solomon's Temple was rebuilt and renamed, "Herod's Temple."  At this time, Rome decided who would be the high priest rather than the Torah.    The Talmud observant never explain why the God of Israel stopped talked to them after a 1500 year period of being able to hear God speak.  Or how worshipping a God that can't talk or act is different from worshipping an idol.      Many claim it is better to re-read a book that describes God's love in a time long ago than to have Him speak and demonstrate it personally today.  (I don't get the logic in that.)  It isn't that God wasn't able to be heard or His actions seen by those that are faithful.     When the Messiah came, it is little wonder that they couldn't recognize Him.  And less than 40 years after God personally raised Jesus from the dead, the Jews revolted against Rome without inquiring God.    If God had been part of the revolt,     1.  Herod's Temple would not have been destroyed and still lay in ruin today.  2.  The priesthood in the line of Aaron would still exist as DNA does not meet Ezra's mandate of being 100% certain.  3.  A messiah in the line of David would be possible.  4.  Many men would not have been slaughtered.  5.  Many women would not have the raped.  6.  And the children that were the result would not have asked questions about whether they were Jews or not....and if it was still possible to be Jewish now that it looked like the Temple wasn't being rebuilt anytime soon.    It was during this time period that the Talmud (oral Torah) popped out of the ashes of the smoldering Temple like a golden calf.    There are two valid reasons for this conclusion:    1.  If the oral Torah is from Moses:     a.  and he commanded the oral Torah to stay oral, the writing of the Talmud proves the Talmud observant reject the commands of Moses.     b.  and the oral Torah was too large to write down when Moses brought it down, it means that the writers of the Talmud rejected part of what Moses said.  This means, the Talmud can't be perfectly handed down through the generations.    2.  If the oral Torah was able to be written down in 70 AD, then it was able to be written down by Moses as well.  One should assume that Moses knowing more about the Torah than those in 70 AD would have presented the Torah as a single Torah instead of dividing the group.      As all of the Tanach describes God as one who chases after His children than one whom Him people are chasing, then it is difficult to understand where the Talmud observant get there understanding.    Hope this helps,    Edit    ***After that, other holy books include the Mishnah, which is also known as "Oral Torah" and the Talmud.***    obviously, you are one of those Atheist Jews that cat's meow speaks:    ***Atheism doesn't, strange as it may sound, violate Judaism; there are Jewish Atheists. As Atheism doesn't involve worshipping idols or other deities, and as Atheists can and do enjoy and respect the complex ethical structure within Judaism, there's not the conflict that one might expect to find.***    One can hardly be the expert in Judaism and not know the difference between the Tanach and the Talmud.        Gorgeoustx Go Spurs Go!!, expert in Judaism since birth, says:   ***For as a Christian I have also a duty to my own people.***    Just remember the Jews didn't have an army in the fight against Hitler.  Therefore, the Jews did NOTHING to earn their freedom from Hilter.  Instead, it was provided by the Christians of the west.  There would have been no liberation of the Jews without the Christians.    As the Jews didn't have a vote in the UN, and therefore, did NOTHING to earn Israel.  It was the Christian of the west that earn by their blood and sacrifice the right to extend a land to Israel.      As the Jews today depend on the Christians of the west for military supplies and technology.  If you could hear the God of Israel speak...or at least if your rabbi could stand in front of your congregation and say, "I have a word given by HaShem this week....." without your congregation discrediting him/her, you would speak differently about to whom your duty as a Jew lies.|`|38vza5Gxaa	answer: http://www.jewfaq.org/index.htm    that's a good start but I suspect you'll be researching for the next year before writing anything.

"My feelings as a Christian points me to my Lord and Savior as a fighter. It points me to the man who once in loneliness, surrounded by a few followers, recognized these Jews for what they were and summoned men to fight against them and who, God's truth! was greatest not as a sufferer but as a fighter. In boundless love as a Christian and as a man I read through the passage which tells us how the Lord at last rose in His might and seized the scourge to drive out of the Temple the brood of vipers and adders. How terrific was His fight for the world against the Jewish poison. To-day, after two thousand years, with deepest emotion I recognize more profoundly than ever before the fact that it was for this that He had to shed His blood upon the Cross. As a Christian I have no duty to allow myself to be cheated, but I have the duty to be a fighter for truth and justice... And if there is anything which could demonstrate that we are acting rightly it is the distress that daily grows. For as a Christian I have also a duty to my own people.    -Adolf Hitler, in a speech on 12 April 1922 (Norman H. Baynes, ed.

After that, other holy books include the Mishnah, which is also known as "Oral Torah" and the Talmud.     After that asking about "Jews" is like asking about "Christians". Though not as disparate, Jews are divided by mostly by how observant they are, but also what aspects of modern life they take up.     For example, your average Chassid is notably fundamentalist, shunning all forms of non approved media, and not usually working outside the community.     One the other end of the scale we have Reform, who fiercely cling to certain aspects of their faith, like Chanakah or uneasiness over intermarriage, but don't normally keep the sabbath, for example, or attend daily or weekly prayers.     Then there is everything in between, and the weirdos on the fringe, like Jews for Jesus (just what it says on the tin) or, Kach, which is a Zionist Terrorist group.

How do you expect to learn, if you don't do the homework?      How will you be able to pass the test when you get to it?      How will you be able to speak when you get off the plane in France?|`|KS2OHXCRaa	The pronoun "en" replaces the partitive article (du, de la, etc.) or de + the indefinite article (un, une, des) + a noun. It is equivalent to "some", "any", or a number in English.     So in answering question 1: Tu as de l'aspirine? (Do you have an aspirin?). You want a positive answer, which is to say "yes I have one".     To say "I have" in French is "J'ai". "En" always come after personal pronoun (in this case, "je") and before the verb. So to say "yes I have one" you say "Oui, j'en ai une" (noting that aspirin is a feminine noun).    Question 2 has the same structure so I guess you could figure what the answer is, no?    Question 3 translates to "You never talk about your health?" so you could respond with "Yes I talk about it from time to time". So knowing what I've explained above, could you figure out the answer? Try now.                                                              "J'en parle de temps en temps."  Did you arrive to this answer?|`|1TuIuuXdaa	1. Oui  2. Oui  3. Oui

You mean teachers? Well when you have only a 45 minute (which is the usual length of one period) class to go over a subject, I don't think you'll get the sufficient learning experience and understanding, which is why you need to go further into it outside class. Giving homework is a way for teachers to get students to get more understanding, their mind active and get into the subject deeper. And it's a good way to detect weaknesses in the subject too, and you can mend it fast.|`|7WTxPfPfaa	to make sure  the student have understood or not.giving homework can be a burden because it has to be corrected.|`|6c3fff62872cc7f77959a6f590498415aa	They actually don't love giving homework..      They in fact love to give you the oppourtunity to train yourself to Self motivate and teach yourself and to expand your knowledge. Theswe are things that dont come naturally to all subjects.     E.g. if u like flowers, you will read and learn about them in the library, when you may be bored. But, maths, you may hate, so the teacher sets you homework, so you pay more attention to this subject.    "The more you put in;  the more you get out "    Simply, if you do more mathamatics, you will do better at it and understand more, because you are pushing it into your subconsious. and forcing yourself to understand it, therefore you get to learn more about it.      Homework is a good thing to help you push yourself harder...    So when you finish it  tonight, ... smile ....because  you have pushed yourself a little further to success..      :)

"N?o; falta-lhe para isso o sentido."    11. Ser dado um dia ao homem compreender o mistrio da Divindade?    "Quando n?o mais tiver o esprito obscurecido pela matria. Quando, pela sua perfei??o, se houver aproximado de Deus, ele o ver e compreender."    A inferioridade das faculdades do homem n?o lhe permite compreender a natureza ntima de Deus. Na infancia da Humanidade, o homem O confunde muitas vezes com a criatura, cujas imperfei??es lhe atribui; mas,  medida que nele se desenvolve o senso moral, seu pensamento penetra melhor no amago das coisas; ent?o, faz idia mais justa da Divindade e, ainda que sempre incompleta, mais conforme  s? raz?o.    12. Embora n?o possamos compreender a natureza ntima de Deus, podemos formar idia de algumas de Suas perfei??es?    "De algumas, sim. O homem as compreende melhor  propor??o que se eleva acima da matria.

Sabei, porm, que h coisas que est?o acima da inteligncia do homem mais inteligente, as quais a vossa linguagem, restrita s vossas idias e sensa??es, n?o tem meios de exprimir. A raz?o, com efeito, vos diz que Deus deve possuir em grau supremo essas perfei??es, porquanto, se uma Lhe faltasse, ou n?o fosse infinita, j Ele n?o seria superior a tudo, n?o seria, por conseguinte, Deus. Para estar acima de todas as coisas, Deus tem que se achar isento de qualquer vicissitude e de qualquer das imperfei??es que a imagina??o possa conceber."    Deus  eterno.

Jesus advertiu no seu Serm?o do Monte: Vigiai-vos dos falsos profetas .?.?. Pelos seus frutos os reconhecereis. .?.?. Toda rvore boa produz fruto excelente, mas toda rvore podre produz fruto imprestvel. (Mateus 7:15-17) ?verdade que algum talvez aja de modo errado e precise de corre??o. Mas a situa??o  diferente quando membros da igreja, at mesmo os clrigos, se entregam  fornica??o e ao adultrio, a brigas, embriaguez, ganancia, mentiras, espiritismo, idolatria ?a qualquer uma ou a todas estas coisas ?mas n?o se administra nenhuma disciplina, e os que continuam a agir assim n?o s?o excludos da congrega??o. A?Bblia declara especificamente que os que praticam tais coisas devem ser expulsos da congrega??o; n?o ter?o nenhum lugar no Reino de Deus. (Glatas 5:19-21) Sua adora??o n?o agrada a Deus, nem lhe agradar a nossa, se escolhermos a companhia dos que ele rejeita. ?1?Corntios 5:11-13; 6:9,?10; Revela??o 21:8.    evidente que nem todos os grupos que afirmam usar a Bblia praticam a religi?o verdadeira que ela descreve. Ent?o, o que especifica a Bblia como sinais identificadores da religi?o verdadeira?  Seus ensinos baseiam-se firmemente nas Escrituras inspiradas. Toda a Escritura  inspirada por Deus e proveitosa para ensinar, para repreender, para endireitar as coisas. (2?Timteo 3:16) Mas, onde  que a Bblia Sagrada fala da Trindade ensinada pela cristandade? E?onde ensina a Bblia, como os clrigos fazem, que os humanos tm uma alma que sobrevive  morte do corpo fsico? J pediu alguma vez a um clrigo que lhe mostrasse esses ensinos na sua Bblia? The New Encyclop?dia Britannica declara: Nem a palavra Trindade, nem a doutrina explcita, aparecem no Novo Testamento. (1992, Microp?dia, Volume?11, pgina 928) E?a New Catholic Encyclopedia admite: Entre os Pais Apostlicos, n?o havia nada, nem mesmo remotamente, que se aproximasse de tal mentalidade ou perspectiva. Quanto ao conceito da cristandade, de que a alma, na morte, se separa do corpo, os eruditos eclesisticos admitem que tiraram esta idia da filosofia grega. No entanto, a religi?o verdadeira n?o relega a verdade bblica a favor de filosofias humanas. ?Gnesis 2:7; Deuteron?mio 6:4; Ezequiel 18:4; Jo?o 14:28.  A religi?o verdadeira advoga a adora??o apenas do nico Deus verdadeiro, Jeov. (Deuteron?mio 4:35; Jo?o 17:3) Jesus Cristo, parafraseando Deuteron?mio 5:9 e 6:13, declarou firmemente:  a Jeov, teu Deus, que tens de adorar e  somente a ele que tens de prestar servi?o sagrado. (Mateus 4:10) Coerente com isso, Jesus fez os seus discpulos conhecer o nome de seu Pai. (Jo?o 17:26) Foi voc ensinado pela sua religi?o a adorar a Jeov? Chegou a conhecer a Pessoa identificada por este nome ?seus propsitos, suas atividades, suas qualidades ?a ponto de que acha poder chegar-se a ele com confian?a? Se a sua for a religi?o verdadeira, a resposta  sim. ?Lucas 10:22; 1?Jo?o 5:14.  A adora??o verdadeira n?o se mancha com o envolvimento na poltica e nos conflitos do mundo. (Tiago 1:27) Por que n?o? Porque Jesus disse a respeito dos seus seguidores: N?o fazem parte do mundo, assim como eu n?o fa?o parte do mundo. (Jo?o 17:16) Jesus n?o se metia na poltica, e ele refreou seus seguidores de recorrerem a armas carnais. (Mateus 26:52) Os que tomam a peito as declara??es da Palavra de Deus n?o aprendem mais a guerra. (Isaas 2:2-4) Se a religi?o com a qual voc est associado, mesmo que s nominalmente, n?o se enquadrar nesta descri??o, j  hora de romper com ela. ?Tiago 4:4; Revela??o 18:4,?5.  A religi?o verdadeira ensina e pratica o amor altrusta. (Jo?o 13:35; 1?Jo?o 3:10-12) Deste amor n?o se fala apenas em serm?es. Ele une realmente numa genuna fraternidade pessoas de todas as ra?as, de todas as camadas sociais, de todas as lnguas e de todas as na??es. (Revela??o 7:9,?10) Distingue os verdadeiros crist?os do mundo em volta deles. Se voc ainda n?o estiver fazendo isso, dispa se do preconceito,e quando a verdade bater  sua porta deixe a entrar.

O PROBLEMA  que os melhores preceitos, que tratam do respeito ao prximo, de tolerancia, foram esquecidos. Estou escrevendo isso porque me lembrei de uma coisa:  Quando cristo vivia pregando, perguntarem-lhe que mandamentos seguir, e ele respondeu aqueles dois; mas aqueles dois n?o eram dele: est?o l um no Levtico, e o outro do Deutoronomio. Ser que porque ele tirava o essencial, o que de verdade importava,  que foi ele t?o diferente? Ao ponto de muitos se dizeram "ateus crist?os"?

O  que est?o de fora n?o est?o vendo e' que o Hamas usa os civis para que o mundo de raz?o para eles, e' uma coisa terrivel!    Em uma terra onde as crian?as que nascem ja saem do ber?o com este odio terrivel conta os judeus, uma situa??o muito triste que no's brasileiros n?o temos nem a mais longe ide'ia do que seja!    'E uma disputa economida ideologica que somente eles entendem!     Vamos rezar pra que Deus os ajude!    Dez raz?es para apoiar Israel       O lder do Hizb'allah, sheik Hassan Nasrallah.       Primero: Porque Israel  nitidamente a vtima de uma nova agress?o e  [uma obriga??o] moral apoiar as vtimas. Israel abandonou Gaza; o Hamas seqestrou um soldado israelense e lan?ou seus ataques com msseis. Pouco depois, uma chuva de foguetes de curto e mdio alcance lan?ada desde o Sul do Lbano pelos terroristas do Hizb'allah (Partido de Al) caiu sobre o pas, provocando baixas na popula??o civil.     Vrios militares foram assassinados. Israel n?o est atacando: est se defendendo  tem o direito e o dever de faz-lo.    Segundo: Porque, se Israel n?o se defender e n?o conseguir proteger seus cidad?os, repetir-se- o massacre de judeus a que o mundo j assistiu (com bastante indiferen?a) durante o nazismo.     Algum duvida qual seria o comportamento de um governo palestino integrado pelo Hamas e pelo Hizb'allah se estes conseguissem derrotar o exrcito de Israel e dominar seu territrio? A amea?a de lan?ar os judeus ao mar n?o  uma metfora, mas uma funesta promessa mil vezes reiterada pelos islamistas mais radicais.    Terceiro: Porque derrotar e desarmar o Hizb'allah confere ao Lbano a oportunidade de existir como uma sociedade prspera, pacfica e livre.     O Hizb'allah, com sua agressiva milcia armada pelos srios e iranianos (mais poderosa que o exrcito libans), n?o somente procura destruir Israel: j destro?ou o Lbano precipitando-o numa guerra que a maior parte dos libaneses n?o desejava.    Quarto: Porque Israel  a nica democracia pluralista e respeitadora dos direitos humanos que existe no Oriente Mdio.     A nica, com certeza, em que os rabes, inclusive os que detestam o Estado judeu, votam livremente e fazem parte do parlamento. A nica em que as mulheres de religi?o islamica estudam sem limita??es, gozam dos mesmos direitos dos homens e n?o s?o tratadas como seres de segunda classe.    Quinto: Porque a nica solu??o desse conflito depende da convivncia pacfica entre Israel e um mundo islamico que, finalmente, como sucedeu com o Egito e a Jordania, admita o direito desse Estado existir.     Parece que isso n?o vai ocorrer at que se chegue  convic??o de que n?o  possvel destruir o Estado judeu, algo que ficar muito mais claro se os inimigos de Israel perceberem que o mundo livre respalda sua integridade sem vacila??es.    Sexto: Porque atrs do Hamas e do Hizb'allah est?o as satrapias sria e iraniana, dois regimes inimigos do Ocidente que divergem no terreno religioso  a Sria  uma ditadura laica e o Ir?  uma ditadura religiosa , mas que convergem no dio irracional s democracias liberais.    Stimo: Porque o xito econ?mico, poltico, cientfico e social de Israel tem o potencial de converter-se em um modelo para a regi?o.     Os rabes mais sensatos de Gaza ou da Autoridade Palestina, quando comparam a vida miservel que lhes  imposta pelos homicidas da Al Fatah, do Hamas e do Hizb'allah com o estilo de vida muito superior de seus irm?os palestino-israelenses, inevitavelmente chegam  conclus?o de que a liberdade e a racionalidade rendem dividendos.    Oitavo: Porque a todo o planeta convm eliminar esses terroristas capazes de provocar uma escalada do conflito que pode levar a uma guerra devastadora.     O Ir? est a caminho de converter-se em um Estado nuclear, e seu presidente, Mahmud Ahmadinejad, tem reiterado que o Estado hebreu deve desaparecer. Ningum duvida que, se ele tentar concretizar seu desejo, Israel responder no mesmo nvel e o resultado seria uma catstrofe para a regi?o e para o mundo.    Nono: Porque o que anima os aventureiros a atacar Israel  a duplicidade de linguagem dos pases do Ocidente, a indiferen?a e a falsa equivalncia, como se as a??es de terroristas desalmados, que aspiram ser suicidas-assassinos que explodem ?nibus escolares ou disparam foguetes contra residncias de civis, tivessem a mesma legitimidade que a resposta de uma sociedade que se defende dessas agress?es.    Dcimo: Porque aquela li??o de histria que nos explicava que os fundamentos morais da civiliza??o ocidental se encontravam na tradi??o judaico-crist? era certa. No Ocidente, Israel somos todos. E se algum dia Israel perecer, isso representar um pouco a morte de todos ns.

S?o os fogos, quase sempre de origem criminosa, s?o as guerras, criminosas tambm, s?o os acidentes de via??o, em suma: s?o as desgra?as umas atrs das outras, e, qual delas, mais trgica que a antecedente...    E, como se n?o bastasse, at a maneira de veicular as notcias, algumas vezes  provocatria para a sensibilidade de quem as escuta.    Cada esta??o em jeito de quem exibe um trofeu, grita aos sete ventos e repete at ao cansa?o que foi a primeira, sen?o a nica, a saber da desgra?a que conta e reconta com um gozo doentio.    Parece at haver um certo sadismo em exibir imagens pungentes de corpos desfeitos, estropiados, irreconhecveis quase, como seres humanos.      Recentemente, o verdadeiro festival de alegria por terem sido mortos os dois filhos de Saddan Hussein foi arrepiante.    Penso, que quando aos homens parece como nica solu??o matar outros homens, todos deveramos sentir, n?o um frmito de sucesso em situa??es como esta, mas, sim de vergonha.    Vergonha, remorso e frustra??o, por nos ter sido impossvel, por n?o termos sido capazes, de resolver os problemas com respeito pela Vida do nosso semelhante.    Onde deveria estar espelhada a dor da nossa derrota, exibe-se a glria de resolver matando, aniquilando, destruindo...    As guerras sucedem-se.    J era tempo de se ter entendido que, ainda, nenhuma delas, por mais cruel e sanguinolenta, resolveu o que quer que fosse.    Nem na antiguidade o engenhoso logro do cavalo de Tria, nem a experincia arrasadora de Hiroxima, ou, mais recentemente, o espectculo televisivo da sofisticadssima guerra no Iraque, nenhuma forma de guerra, jamais, resolveu os problemas entre os homens e instaurou uma Paz definitiva.    O dio n?o se dilui em dio.    O nico solvente do dio  o perd?o,  o amor.    Em qualquer tempo, afirma??es destas parecer?o sempre utpicas, ser?o sempre polmicas.    S?o as chamadas verdades de trazer por casa...    Todos o sabemos.    Porm, quantos de entre ns nos afirmamos como crist?os e o esquecemos na prtica.    Afinal, o Amor, a Fraternidade e o Perd?o s?o a essncia da religi?o a que chamamos nossa e em teoria defendemos...    Utpica deveria ser considerada a filosofia que pretende justificar o ataque de umas na??es a outras, a destrui??o de uns povos por outros.    Antecipar o flagelo de uns, para evitar o flagelo de outros... que at poderia n?o chegar a acontecer, n?o  utpico,  uma realidade terrfica.    Guerras fazendo vtimas. Imagem: www.tamandare.g12.br    A lgica das guerras, ser sempre a ausncia de lgica.    Faz-me lembrar a tola anedota do indivduo que angustiado com medo da passagem do cometa, se matou para n?o morrer...    E, assim segue o homem seus caminhos de ambi??o, perdido do Homem, perdido de si prprio...    Os mortos s?o apenas nmeros de estatsticas...    Inimigos para uns, heris para outros.    Sempre gente.    Eu, tu, ele...Sempre gente.    Apenas gente.  (Maria Jos Rijo)    *********************  Beijos meu querido e um timo final de semana|`|F6kfeyrAaa	Pelo andar da carruagem, matar?o.

Este ltimo nome, YAHVEH,  o nico nome que  realmente o nome prprio de Deus. Os outros nomes s?o mais ttulos do que nomes propriamente.    Este nome  derivado da forma causativa do verbo hebraico HAVAH, que significa ser, ou existir.    O nome YAHVEH aparece muitas vezes no Tanach (Antigo Testamento).    Este nome  considerado o mais sagrado dos nomes de Deus.    No entanto, na maioria das tradu??es da Bblia, onde aparece o nome YAHVEH, este nome  substitudo pela palavra Senhor.    Isto acontece pela seguinte raz?o:    A partir do sculo III A.C., os judeus deixaram de pronunciar o nome sagrado de Deus, YAHVEH, porque achavam que seria uma profana??o pronunci-lo, e por isso, ao lerem a Bblia, onde estava escrito YAHVEH, eles pronunciavam ADONAY, que significa Senhor. Por este motivo, quando a Bblia foi traduzida para o grego, onde aparecia o nome sagrado YAHVEH, eles colocaram KYRIOS, que em grego significa Senhor. Posteriormente, ao traduzirem a Bblia para o latim, onde aparecia o nome sagrado, eles colocaram Dominus, que significa Senhor, e depois, quando traduziram para o portugus, colocaram Senhor.    Em algumas tradu??es mais modernas, onde aparece o nome YAHVEH, eles colocaram SENHOR, com todas as letras maisculas, para que o leitor saiba que ali a palavra SENHOR est substituindo o nome sagrado de Deus, YAHVEH.  E quando no texto original da Bblia, em hebraico, aparece o nome ADONAY, eles colocam Senhor, com apenas a inicial maiscula.      O nome YAHVEH, quando adaptado para a lngua portuguesa, fica JAV, ou JAEV.  Isto porque, em hebraico, o nome  pronunciado YAHVEH ou YAHEVEH, conforme se pronuncie de forma mais rpida ou mais pausada.    Algumas pessoas pronunciam o nome sagrado de Deus como YEHOVAH, e o adaptam para a lngua portuguesa como JEOV.  No entanto, a pronncia certa  YAHVEH.    Esta divergncia de pronncia ocorreu pelas seguintes raz?es:    O Tanach (Antigo Testamento) foi escrito em hebraico.    No alfabeto hebraico n?o existiam vogais, s existiam consoantes. N?o era necessrio escrever as vogais, porque as pessoas que conhecem bem a lngua hebraica, lem perfeitamente o texto escrito s com consoantes, e inclusive as razes das palavras, em hebraico, s?o constitudas somente de consoantes, que s?o vocalizadas de vrias formas, para formar verbos, substantivos, adjetivos, etc.    Quando os judeus deixaram de pronunciar o nome YAHVEH, este nome continuou a ser pronunciado pelos sacerdotes, no templo, quando aben?oavam o povo, com a bn??o sacerdotal (Nmeros 4:24-26).  Portanto, a verdadeira pronncia do nome sagrado continuou conhecida.    No entanto, no ano 70 D.C., o Templo de Deus foi destrudo pelos romanos, e ent?o os judeus deixaram completamente de pronunciar o nome sagrado de Deus, e por isso, aos poucos, a verdadeira pronncia foi caindo no esquecimento, embora a tradi??o judaica diga que alguns rabinos, ao longo dos sculos, sabiam a verdadeira pronncia do nome sagrado de Deus, que  tambm chamado de tetragrama sagrado, pois  formado por quatro consoantes: YHVH.    Na mesma ocasi?o em que o Templo de Deus foi destrudo, foi destruda tambm a cidade de Jerusalm, e os judeus foram expulsos da sua terra, e foram espalhados entre as na??es.    Por isso, os judeus deixaram de falar o hebraico no dia-a-dia, e passaram a usar a lngua hebraica apenas para orar e ler a Bblia, e para escrever comentrios sobre a Bblia.    Em decorrncia disso, come?ou a surgir o risco de ningum mais saber qual a pronncia correta do texto da Bblia.    Ent?o os judeus inventaram uns sinais, constitudos de pontos e tra?os, que s?o colocados embaixo ou acima das consoantes, e que representam as vogais, e colocaram estes sinais de vogais em todo o texto do Tanach (Velho Testamento).     Como onde aparecia o nome YAHVEH eles pronunciavam ADONAY, ent?o eles colocaram nas consoantes do nome YAHVEH, as vogais de ADONAY, e isto fez com que surgisse a forma YEHOVAH.    No entanto, dois escritores gregos crist?os antigos, um chamado Clemente de Alexandria, e outro chamado Teodoreto, escreveram o nome sagrado de Deus em letras gregas.  Clemente de Alexandria escreveu IAOUE, [1][1] que se pronuncia IAUE, pois em grego OU pronuncia-se U, e Teodoreto escreveu IABE, que se pronuncia IAVE, pois em grego a letra B se pronuncia V. [2][2]  A letra hebraica vav, que corresponde ao nosso v, originalmente era pronunciada com o som de u, tanto assim que em hebraico s vezes a letra vav  usada para representar o som de u. Por isso, alguns transliteram a letra vav como w, e n?o como v.    Clemente de Alexandria escreveu aproximadamente no ano 215 D.C., e Teodoreto escreveu aproximadame|`|Ua1upl2gaa	Chuck Norris.|`|V048XOQnaa	Olha.... Haja pai...

De outro as trevas da ignorancia, as religi?es.    *ignorancia  do Latim ignorantia  s. f.,   estado de quem ignora; falta de saber, de cincia; desconhecimento; impercia    As religi?es se utilizam de tcnicas de demopsicologia, magia negra, para manter as pessoas encantadas em meio as coisas do divino enquanto praticam todas as iniqidades das coisas de Satans.    Iluminismo X Obscurantismo    Essa  uma luta secular!    "Chamamos de Iluminismo o movimento cultural que se desenvolveu na Inglaterra, Holanda e Fran?a, nos sculos XVII e XVIII. Nessa poca, o desenvolvimento intelectual, que vinha ocorrendo desde o Renascimento, deu origem a idias de liberdade poltica e econ?mica, defendidas pela burguesia.     Os filsofos e economistas que difundiam essas idias julgavam-se propagadores da luz e do conhecimento, sendo, por isso, chamados de iluministas.     O Iluminismo trouxe consigo grandes avan?os que, juntamente com a Revolu??o Industrial, abriram espa?o para a profunda mudan?a poltica determinada pela Revolu??o Francesa.     O precursor desse movimento foi o matemtico francs Ren Descartes (1596-1650), considerado o pai do racionalismo. Em sua obra Discurso do mtodo, ele recomenda, para se chegar  verdade, que se duvide de tudo, mesmo das coisas aparentemente verdadeiras.     A partir da dvida racional pode-se alcan?ar a compreens?o do mundo, e mesmo de Deus.     As principais caractersticas do Iluminismo eram:   ? Valoriza??o da raz?o, considerada o mais importante instrumento para se alcan?ar qualquer tipo de conhecimento;   ? valoriza??o do questionamento, da investiga??o e da experincia como forma de conhecimento tanto da natureza quanto da sociedade, poltica ou economia;   ? cren?a nas leis naturais, normas da natureza que regem todas as transforma??es que ocorrem no comportamento humano, nas sociedades e na natureza;   ? cren?a nos direitos naturais, que todos os indivduos possuem em rela??o  vida,  liberdade,  posse de bens materiais;   ? crtica ao absolutismo, ao mercantilismo e aos privilgios da nobreza e do clero;   ? defesa da liberdade poltica e econ?mica e da igualdade de todos perante a lei;   ? crtica  Igreja Catlica, embora n?o se oponha aos protestantes.

Concordo, porque ns podemos escolher as nossas companhias. J reparou nas crian?as? A maioria entra nos grupinhos de malandragem para chamar a aten??o e para ficar rodeado de pessoas que elas dizem ser os amigos. Se os pais n?o percebem, elas acabam virando malandras mesmo. Isso acontece com algumas crian?as, porque elas n?o tm auto-estima e sentem-se sozinhas. Isso  tolervel at certo ponto, pois elas est?o aprendendo. Mas para ns, adultos, essa chance de aprender j passou, ent?o entra o ditado "antes sozinho do que mal acompanhado". Jntamente com o provrbio que voc citou, acho que antes de procurarmos a companhia ideal, devemos ser a companhia ideal. Ns podemos avaliar as pessoas antes de nos tornarmos amigos delas. Outro ponto  que existe diferen?a entre amigos e conhecidos. Um chefe ou colega de trabalho  uma pessoa com quem eu passo muito tempo, conhe?o e converso muito com ele, mas pode n?o ser meu amigo e nem inimigo,  apenas um conhecido. O mesmo pode acontecer com pessoas que tenham religi?es ou idias diferentes. Acho correto trocarem idias, informa??es, mas uma amizade eu acho difcil ocorrer. Eu sou mrmon (SUD) e estou aqui neste frum, troco idias, respondo, pergunto o tempo todo e gosto de fazer isso, mas isso n?o caracteriza amizade. As pessoas com quem eu realmente ando s?o minha esposa, meus pais, meus parentes e alguns amigos que tm idias semelhantes s minhas. Talvez eu fugi muito da quest?o, mas  mais ou menos por a.    Um abra?o e boa semana pra voc tambm.    .|`|ZY7p6U8Eaa	Para ser breve...    A psicologia diz que voc  as cinco pessoas com quem mais voc convive.

If I didn't believe it, I wouldn't belong to it.  If I didn't believe that God is the Lord of all, why would I doubt that He doesn't care where anyone is?    He does care.  He understands how fragmented we are.  That is why when we find that unity, it will irrevocably be because of Him and no one else.    We understand painfully, here and now, how impossible it is to convince anyone of anything.  The barriers within each and every one of us are insurmountable, and have been in the making for thousands of generations.    When that barrier comes down, it won't be because we thought that human intervention did it.  It will be because of God alone.  There will be no other cure.  There will be no other explanation .|`|i85Dui0maa	yes im at peace in my heart with god         were all gonna find out when we die anyway|`|AA10329469	All believers, with minor exceptions,  think that their own religion is true and stay confined to it unlike you, who tries to think of other possibilities.No matter which way one thinks or in what one believes or disbelieves,the situation remains the same ie you are at your own and with what you believe or don't.It's been like this since centuries and would continue to be so as faith does strange things to people.|`|aNycRVC9aa	The part where you said "imagining the possibilities" pretty much summed up the basis of religion in general.|`|QEcbNnWVaa	The path I follow is right for me.

And pagans feel the way they do because of what they were taught all their lives, or they were looking for something different because christianity or whatever they believed didn't answer their questions well enough. Atheists feel like they do because in all the years of the planets existence, there is no proof of a higher being except in what is written.

The one fact that I just could not leave to science or forget was that HOW could my mind show me my future when I could do anything and no one can be sure about it what I will do and what will happen.    So I would suggest, test dreams. See a dream and observe your life the following day and you will see that one or more parts of your life from that day are present in that dream.    We do everything under the influence of chemicals. What if some one could map those chemicals and guess the future?

So mating, sex, and love are the meaning of life......but not the only meaning.  It is also important for the survival of our species to ensure the well being of our fellow humans.  This means cooperation, helping others (including those unable to help themselves), and generally being kind because the world works much more smoothly when these things happen.  It is also important to do no harm if possible, because this threatens the survival of our species.  This is the actual basis for morality, not religion.  Also, you can find a very personal meaning for yourself - whether it be in expressing creativity, devoting yorself to your loved one, doing work which helps others, or simply doing what you enjoy as long as it harms no one.  There are many possibilities for finding your own personal meaning, but simply being kind and caring is always a good start.  And don't forget the love, sex, and if you desire,procreation. Any or all of these can be very fulfilling.  Hope this helps.|`|AA11923447	42.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(answer)...|`|6DQSkKgWaa	My meaning and purpose is different from yours.

W0rcm3awaa	An altar isn't needed in order to be buddhist or practice buddhism but it can be a nice addition. I've typically heard that an altar in the least should consist of three things (you can add other things to it based on your tastes but these are the basics.)    From left to right (when looking at the altar straight on) A scripture of some kind (any scripture is fine you should use something that has meaning to you), then a statue or picture of the buddha (not the fat one, thats hotei), and then a stupa. Combined these three represent the three jewels - the sangha, the buddha, and the dharma.    I'll explain what a stupa is. If you look up stupa you will more than likely find the buildings, there are large buildings with relics of buddhas and other buddhist teachers inside much like christian churchs have relics. They are generally holy places and have a specific design to them. Howeve there are also mineratures. In my case i was unable to find a stupa so i found a website that taught how to make a stupa without it being deemed a 'black stupa' which is when one is made incorrectly. You have to have a few certain things.  http://www.stupa.org.nz/stupa/stupa_cons...    Your altar can also have many levels. I've heard different things about which way it should face, i've often heard it should face the east (or where the sun rises) but i'm uncertain on this fact. I do know that it should either have its own room or if this is not possible (like in my case) it should be on the side of the room that your head faces when you sleep, its disrespectful to put it on the end where your feet are.    Here are pictures of my amateur (and very basic) altar:  http://i375.photobucket.com/albums/oo192...    This is a close up on the stupa I made:  http://i375.photobucket.com/albums/oo192...    And here is whats inside the stupa (what makes it a stupa besides its layout)  http://i375.photobucket.com/albums/oo192...    I make various other home made buddhist things too like malas and prayer flags :D.    You can also put small dishes on your altar for offerings but i won't start on that it would be a long conversation. When i go home my altar gets slightly bigger and i have incense i enjoy burning along with a few other tokens. Maybe this can be a headstart for you! Best of luck.|`|37LKDbtsaa	I have all ready answered your question.|`|czXaUPIlaa	Home altars serve much the same purpose as a formal altar in a temple. But because they are personal, they can reflect your own inspirations and aspirations.    What inspired you to begin Buddhist practice? Your altar might contain literal or symbolic representations of the person, experience, or event that led to your interest in Buddhism.    What aspirations do you have for your practice? Your altar can also contain objects that symbolize your "practice direction."    Many people have some representation of "enlightenment mind" on their altar. This can be an image or statue of the Buddha or a bodhisattva. Or it could be a beautiful stone or other object which carries that symbolic meaning.    Altars frequently carry symbols of the four elements. Air is represented by incense. Fire by candles. Water by a container of water. And earth by flowers or seeds. You can be creative with these, if you like.    The most important thing about an altar, in my experience, is to practice in front of it every day. If you do that, then any kind of object will come to inspire your efforts.    If you're interested, you can read about and see photos of the two altars I've prepared in my home on my blog: http://www.oxherding.com/my_weblog/2008/...|`|pevh5EiSaa	Generally, depending on the sect of Buddhism you follow, 3 things must be present on a shrine.  1. a representation of the Buddhas body  2. a representation of the Buddhas speech  3. a representation of the Buddhas mind    1, can be a statue of the Buddha, or even a picture of the Buddha (by the way , not the short little fat guy, that's ho'tei )  2, Most often represented as the Dharma or Buddhas teachings, so any Buddhist scripture or book or even a  mantra written on a piece of paper will qualify.  3,a Stupa or Chorten, representing the Buddhas enlightened mind, even a picture of a stupa will qualify as well.  those are the must haves, but you can add 7 or 21 offering bowls for water or for the 7 offerings :  water for washing  water for drinking  flowers  incense  light ( candle. small oil lamp, even a small lit bulb )  scented water   food  These of course vary from tradition to tradition.  other than the 3 required things  you can put most anything that makes you feel more " spiritual " pictures of teachers, a special rock, etc etc  hope this helps !

Heavenly Father loves the pauper as much as the prince.  It is for an altogether different purpose to research our families and redeem our kindred dead.      1 Corinthians 15: 29 Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?|`|XmJZkFuMaa	First, the KJV of the same verses.  2 Unto Timothy, my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.    3 As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,    4 Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do.    Hmm.  Seems his son needed to be reminded to charge SOME people who were in power.  Wonder what Paul was talking about... thankfully there's more scriptures talking about the problem.  In Titus 3 he repeats himself a lot, and in 9 sure enough he talks about genealogies again.     "9 But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain."     AH!  So we are told that the problem is that they're not doing any good anywhere, and they are VAIN.  Now how would this have ANY impact on what was going on?    Well, the priesthood in the days of the Israelites up until Jesus was restricted to certain households and certain genealogical lines.  If you could say "I am of the house of David" that MEANT something.  You were more likely to be respected.  You were more likely to be put into a place of power.  And since the coming of Christ basically made all men equal, that sort of vain power-stepping was unacceptable.  Who cares if you are related to George Washington, it shouldn't grant you a position in the army, if it did it would cause contentions.    Now, why isn't it meaning ANY genealogical work?  Simple.  If genealogy was something that was bad, something that shouldn't be there... Christ's genealogy shouldn't have been given.  Christ's genealogy work was done, if we are to follow example, how can anyone say we shouldn't also have our genealogy work done?  Not to be vain, not to draw attention to ourselves or to guarantee a position of power or to boast of the past, but for no other reason than because Christ did.|`|6fb7392757c2cda50b13cf240bc7aed7aa	I think what is trying to be said is don't allow the practice of genealogy keeping become so ritualized that it replaces true worship and work for the Lord.

Again, God is God.      You incorrectly phrased both parts of your questions.  God does not "need" anything in the manner in which a person needs something.      For the first question, God is worthy of all honor and praise and glory.  He alone should be and must be praised.  It is man/woman who NEEDS to praise, worship, and glorify God.    For the second question, God is the owner of everything.  Why?  He's the Creator.  Again, God is God.  All of our resources belong to God.  God knows that the love of money is the root of all evil, and He tells us to show our faithfulness and sincerity by giving 10% back to Him.  How you give this 10% back to Him is a different question/topic; however, the giving is not based on God's need.  Again, God is God.  Man/woman needs to give.      "Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen." Hebrews 11:1    "All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness" 2 Timothy 3:16    "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me."

Assuming that our parents are the traditional ones that are there for you, listen to your concerns and fears, steer you in the right direction, discipling you even if  you feel you are right, etc. We worship God because th created us with  free will, with intelligence, the fact we can enjoy beauti in the world and in the way he made us and he  deserves it. Second  question; he  doesn't need $, but his followers need a place to meet together in order to encourage each other spiritually. This place reflects our  feelling for him usually with the best we can offer. We do  this willing  but he expects it from all who claim to worship  him.|`|b3JKcQXGaa	The answer to both questions is this: He doesnt! God does not NEED anything from us. He asks us to worship Him for our benefit. Not His. As we worship God by following His ways, we will ultimately receive the blessings. He does not need our money either, but He asks of us to give back to Him 10% of the income He has blessed us with. This is not for His benefit, but a powerful way for us to sacrifice, and show our love for Him. It takes a lot of faith and courage to give away some of your income, but it will be returned to you in the form of "blessings upon your head that you will not have room enough to receive it."

sy7ytm9Kaa	This type of post is one that could be discussed for weeks in order to fully answer and address your pondering - which are very valid and which I have seen many times entertained by other posters but never quite fully answered because of the depth of the subject.    That being said, in order to being to begin an understanding, one must understand why God allows things to happen that seem inherently unfair, wrong or even horrendous.  A good place to start is Romans. (specifically, 1:21- 32).    But then, that does not address the respect for parents and respect for God.      God is infallible, so an awesome reverence for him is an easier item to understand at the most basic level.  However, parents can be very fallible and even negligent - much like leaders of countries and  governments.   The position is to be respected first and foremost, then the person.   It is not impossible to respect a person on a human level and not agree with a single act or word they conjure.     There are many examples of why & how in the Bible and to only post one or two adds little to the explanation.  If there is any interest in actually diving into such a subject and not just pondering perceived injustice, my email is available.|`|73n1SExgaa	God does not want your respect He wants your worship. Bad things happen and good things happen. Don't blame God for everything. Man has made of mess of the earth and life. Man has polluted it and than blames God for all of it. God allows things bad to happen for a reason. God isn't going to do the job He gave man to do. The rain falls on the just and the unjust. (believer and non believers.) Its called life. It is how we handle it all in the end. God brings things into your life to bring you to himself. He is the almighty God. The creator of all things and also rules over everything. To question God on His ways is foolish. When we Christians get to heaven we will see more clearly. Right now we trust God and leave it up to Him how it will all turn out. We need to learn to do unto others as we would want them to do to us. Live right and be an example to others. Have pity on those who are evil they don't know what awaits them. God has the finale punishment. judgment. Remember man is born sinful and  bend towards evil.

Uriah was the victim here.  Sure, there are clear "good guys" and "bad guys".  David was bad, Uriah was good.    The point of the story was that even the best men can fall, and God can still use us, no matter what we've done.  David became known as a "man after God's heart", despite all the horrible things he did.  He was an adulterer and a murderer, yet God used him to give us some of the most beautiful writings in the world.  The Psalms are a great source of inspiration (he wrote at least the first half).|`|14b43c5bae3d09bf80336812c8aece34aa	I think you may be missing the over all point.

sV4knlUfaa	Well done for summing up the nonsense that is the Mormons but I feel that you may be coming from the point of another religion which is a shame (sorry if I am wrong on this). Try looking at all the rubbish in the bible and all the contradictions that it has.

As for Gal 1:6+... you do realize that the gospel they're talking about is the gospel of Christ, and that only through Christ is salvation right?  Try reading Moroni 9.  Basically, he spends it calling anyone who does not believe in Christ to repentance.    Lev 8:7-9, among others, talk about the use of stones in communicating with God.      Murderer?  That was self-defense.  Read first link.    *coughs*  Every child knows Christ was born in Bethlehem, so don't you think it would have been REALLY REALLY stupid for Joseph Smith to say Christ was born at Jerusalem?.... the wording of Jerusalem is directed towards the land, which actually can be seen as PROOF of the Book of Mormon's truthfulness...  See second link.    Yup, money can't buy you love or heaven, and you are saved by grace and not works, but grace only works if you have faith, and faith without works is dead (all said in the New Testament.)  They're reliant on one another, like the legs of a chair.  Take away one, it all falls down.      Solomon's was the biggest temple.  Ours tend to be small by comparison with what God asked for temples in the Bible.  As for the ceremonies in the Solomon's and other temples in the Bible, it obviously was sacred enough to not be included... or is that word secret... eh, whichever you prefer.    Basically?  This has been entertaining, but you need to do more research, and use proper punctuation, if you're going to try and cause contention, tear down beliefs, and such.    Add:  See, that's the thing.  I didn't call any of it false (except the murderer charge, since that's pretty ridiculous...) but instead pointed out that what seems far-fetched is Biblical or has been verified as accurate and not a mistake.  Or that she's confused (like how some people believe we don't believe in Grace, where we strongly believe in Faith/works/grace all being necessary and connected.)      It's sort of like someone saying "That car is rusty" instead of "That car has been painted to look like rust."  They're both true, but have completely different meanings.|`|JTu1cLkYaa	Your use of the familiar Joe shows me that you have gotten your information from an anti-Mormon site.     Courage has given you the information if you'll read it.     As for the grace vs works. It says in Jas 2:20 "But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?" Faith and works are two sides of the same coin. You need both, they compliment one another.  And it says in Rev 20:12 "And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works."

XN0cYCATaa	For the vast, vast majority of people who are part of what calls itself the church in the United States, the words of Jesus above, spoken in the context of material wealth, will immediately draw an emotionally defensive response. Why? What does it mean when someone is defensive at the suggestion of living a sacrificial life for Jesus? What does it mean when people get defensive when it is suggested they do with fewer material things or 'not-as-nice' material things? Well, it probably means they are either in bondage to, or struggling with, the sin of covetousness. What is the definition of "covet"? It is to consistently desire more material things than what you presently have. It means to focus on getting more money/things as opposed to giving them away in serving the Lord. What does it mean to be in bondage to the sin of covetousness? It means one is not willing to try and follow Messiah Jesus. He who has ears to hear, let him hear!

The Repulican Party?   He went straight to the source of every Christians belief ... the bible.   ONLY the original scripters are accurate ... Torah and Gospels specifically.  Christ is the Word of God, NOT the bible.  Satan has nudged man kind to add, change and spin scripture.  Even the Canonization of the bible (chosing what books would make the 'bible') was not free of mans errors.  These errors hide who God and Jesus are.  Can't you see how that is a homerun for Satan?  What, dont you think Satan would do something like that?    There is no hell. It is a made up word and place and completely misunderstood.  Hell was made up centuries ago to keep people in their place, and the pre-trib rapture was made up also from a dream.   Its all crap.      "Fire" is actually a good thing.  It cleanses and refines:    Matthew 3:11   11 "I baptize you with water for repentance. But after me will come one who is more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not fit to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.    Fire pleases God.  It represented His loving purpose of refining mankind to be more like Him.  That's why until Christs death, He was pleased with sacrifice ... filled with symbolism:    Exodus 29:18  Then burn the entire ram on the altar. It is a burnt offering to the LORD, a pleasing aroma, an offering made to the LORD by fire.      The words 'everlasting', 'eternal', etc.  are mistransliterated.  They mean a 'period of time'.    Hell (the word never in orig. scriptures) usually meant being sent outside the kingdom (Israel).  This symbolically refers to The Kingdom of God - and many of us wont get immmediate access Christs return (ie. your passage "Lord Lord").   When Christ comes - EVERYONE  will know who He is and all will say "Lord Lord" but not everyone acknowledged him during their time on earth.   We will be there (place of refinement aka "hell") for a period of time, and be changed by a loving God.  HOWEVER ... it will suck becuase we will want to be with God more than anything and the separation will be a tremendous heart pain (torment).    Then, when your refinement and testing (by brimstone - a rock used to test the quality of metals) is complet - you will enter the Kingdom of God and be with Him for ever.     God said he desires ALL MEN to be saved.  Dont you think God gets what God wants?   1 Tim 2:3-6   God our Savior, 4  desires ALL MEN TO BE SAVED and come to the knowledge of the truth.     Here's what you do... Pray, ask God to remove all false doctrine and tradition from your heart and replace it with overwhelming love for Him.  Ask Him to put it in your heart when you have heard or read the truth. (hint: the truth will set you FREE, not burden you).   Do this often, and often give thanks as gratitude is a self imposed 'refiner'.    By believing in Christ ... you get to skip the wrath (refinement period).  You believe now, and are a done deal.  False doctrine has hid the true nature of God and made you fearful.  This is not from God.  This is Satans work.     Email me, let me know how things go for you.|`|9m2LvlWdaa	I pity you.

Of David.        Save me, God, for the waters have reached my neck.     I have sunk into the mire of the deep, where there is no foothold. I have gone down to the watery depths; the flood overwhelms me.     I am weary with crying out; my throat is parched. My eyes have failed, looking for my God.      More numerous than the hairs of my head are those who hate me without cause. Too many for my strength are my treacherous enemies. Must I now restore what I did not steal?     God, you know my folly; my faults are not hidden from you.     Let those who wait for you, LORD of hosts, not be shamed through me. Let those who seek you, God of Israel, not be disgraced through me     For your sake I bear insult, shame covers my face.     I have become an outcast to my kin, a stranger to my mother's children.     Because zeal for your house consumes me, I am scorned by those who scorn you.     I have wept and fasted, but this led only to scorn.     I clothed myself in sackcloth; I became a byword for them.     They who sit at the gate gossip about me; drunkards make me the butt of their songs.     But I pray to you, LORD, for the time of your favor. God, in your great kindness answer me with your constant help.     Rescue me from the mire; do not let me sink. Rescue me from my enemies and from the watery depths.     Do not let the floodwaters overwhelm me, nor the deep swallow me, nor the mouth of the pit close over me.     Answer me, LORD, in your generous love; in your great mercy turn to me.     Do not hide your face from your servant; in my distress hasten to answer me.     Come and ransom my life; because of my enemies redeem me.     You know my reproach, my shame, my disgrace; before you stand all my foes.     Insult has broken my heart, and I am weak; I looked for compassion, but there was none, for comforters, but found none.     Instead they put gall in my food; for my thirst they gave me vinegar.     Make their own table a snare for them, a trap for their friends.     Make their eyes so dim they cannot see; keep their backs ever feeble.     Pour out your wrath upon them; let the fury of your anger overtake them.     Make their camp desolate, with none to dwell in their tents.     For they pursued the one you struck, added to the pain of the one you wounded.     Add that to their crimes; let them not attain to your reward.     Strike them from the book of the living; do not count them among the just!     But I am afflicted and in pain; let your saving help protect me, God,     That I may praise God's name in song and glorify it with thanksgiving.     My song will please the LORD more than oxen, more than bullocks with horns and hooves:     "See, you lowly ones, and be glad; you who seek God, take heart!     For the LORD hears the poor, does not spurn those in bondage.      Let the heavens and the earth sing praise, the seas and whatever moves in them!"

Launched early in 2006, the ongoing comics series, written by prolific cultural theorist Douglas Rushkoff, almost always has three levels of narrative going on at once. The first issue begins with a familiar scenario: Abraham waking Isaac up for their appointment on Mount Moriah. Then the scene abruptly shifts to the not-too-distant future, where a grouchy young man named Jake Stern is preparing for his father to implant a subcutaneous RFID chip in his arm, in accordance with a new American law. The two plots continue in parallelsometimes very tenuous parallelas the panels cut back and forth between Torah and science fiction. Meanwhile, a consortium of gods and their representatives from various traditions (bull-headed Canaanite god Moloch, Levantine sex goddess Astarte, Egyptian creation god Atum-Ra) hover outside the first two levels panels, more or less in the manner of Talmudic commentary, discussing the dual stories and nudging them forward.     Rushkoff, who first made a splash with his 1993 survey of new digital culture, Cyberia, has turned his attentions to religion in recent years. His 2003 book Nothing Sacred proposed what he calls open source Judaismthe idea that Judaism should evolve dynamically, constantly rebuilt by its practitioners, rather than being nailed down as orthodoxy. (Understandably, it went over like a lead latke with the Jewish establishment.) The big point hes making in Testament is that Torah is comprised of written stories that resonate across time and space, and that consequently theyre meant to be rewritten. In his introduction to the first five-issue storyline of Testament (collected as Akedah), he calls the Bible the ultimate handbook for psychic revolt. . . . Think youre an accomplished magician? Check out the source code on reality hacking, and see if you can handle it.     As a piece of rhetoric, Testament is awfully clever, if nearly as full of itself as that quote. (A character who looks exactly like Rushkoff even makes a few cameo appearances as kindly Professor Ross, whos very concerned about America having descended into a new era of corporatism.) As a comic book, unfortunately, its something of a disaster.     At the start of Akedah, Jake takes refuge with a group of anti-RFID rebels in an abandoned building called The Temple, a former synagogue that curiously also contains a large swimming pool. As it turns out, those RFID chips are powerful little plot devicesthey dont just track their bearers locations, they can administer disciplinary electric shocks or kill by remote control, theyre the medium of exchange for a sinister new global currency, andoh yestheyre alive and can grow, because theyre based on an artificial intelligence program that Jakes dad, it turns out, created 20 years earlier. Theres also some tension involving Jake and his almost-legal former pupil Dinah; shes one of the Temple crew, but identifies with Astarte (which is apparently why artist Liam Sharp always draws her wearing hot pants or Gothic Lolita fetish gear) and works at a strip club callednyuk, nyukBabylon.     All that could be the setup for a standard-issue ragtag-band-of-rebels-against-the-Man plot, but Rushkoff barely lets it breathe. Almost every scene is meant to echo Torah explicitly: A woman refusing to abandon a group protest and getting zapped by the government is Lots wife being turned into a pillar of salt, Jake getting a lap dance from a masked Dinah is Judah impregnating the disguised Tamar, and so on. The pantheon of divine onlookers makes sure we dont miss any of this, interjecting comments like, Then as now, faith rules the day.     Still, for all its straining to reinvigorate biblical interpretation in a new medium, Testament isnt nearly as groundbreaking as Rushkoff seems to think it is. In the past, comics have tackled the Bible from dozens of angles, from the 40s kiddie series Picture Stories from the Bible, to the irreverent 1987 anthology Outrageous Tales from the Old Testament (which included contributions from Alan Moore and Neil Gaiman), to Dave Sims extensive, deeply eccentric Torah commentary in Cerebus: Latter Days, in which an anthropomorphic aardvark spends 140 pages explaining the first 38 chapters of Genesis to a Woody Allen lookalike. The best may be yet to come: the legendary underground cartoonist R. Crumb has been working for several years on his own adaptation of Genesis.     Rushkoff wrote one comic before Testamentthe messy 2004 graphic novel Club Zero-Gbut hes turned to the comics format here, hes explained, so that the three sections of his story can be visually adjacent to each other. In fact, theres a very specific precedent for the way Rushkoff and Sharp try to juxtapose multiple times, places, and metaphysical realities: Alan Moore an|`|vBcN2WM9aa	I havent read it...(i'm only answerin gur Q, its not for pts,)  ...

It's pretty silly though not to believe in a Higher POwer because, in your opinion, a Higher Power would/would not do certain things.     All mythology, scriptures, and human ideas and guessing aside--   If there is a Higher Power your mortal mind could not probably wrap around it's true nature, so you should probably not try to second-guess what it should or should be doing.|`|AA11598520	Clearly, you cannot say that for sure since there is no evidence to prove that.

I. First: You exist.   If matter-energy can NOT be created, how did we all get here in the first place? But here we all are 'existing'. This implies the very hand of God leaving every atheist staring in the mirror asking themselves, "But how?"      II. Second: Big Bang and other cosmological evidence.   If you truly understand quantum mechanics then you will know that the Big Bang theory requires a creator by fiat. Think of the universe in reverse until it's small enough to be completely described by quantum mechanics alone. In order for the universe to start unfolding into what we see now, our universe's specific wave function had to be brought into existence as a certain possibility out of an infinite number of other possible wave functions that had to collapse or at least decohere. At this fuzzy nanoscopic beginning, this required a 'Prime Observer' to enable this and set the expansion of the universe into motion and those initial conditions became the very facets of physical law. What we refer to as this finely tuned 'reality'. This need for an 'observer' comes from the basic quantum mechanical concept known as Shrodinger's Cat. Also, we must remember that the universe is being said to have come from nowhere which implies an act of 'creation'.  This ever increasing expansion of our universe is alluded to 11 times in the Bible:  Job 9:8 ; Psalm 104:2 ; Isaiah 40:22 ; Isaiah 42:5 ; Isaiah 44:24 ; Isaiah 45:12 ; Isaiah 48:13 ; Isaiah 51:13 ; Jeremiah 10:12 ; Jeremiah 51:15 ; Zechariah 12:1   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_bang  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schrodinger...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_functi...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decoherence      The Bible also alludes to the Big Rip:   Revelation 6:14 ; Isaiah 34:4 ; 2 Peter 3:10   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_rip      III. Third: The fulfillment of hundreds of Biblical prophecies.  For instance here is one that was prophesied almost 2 millennia ago, yet has manifested itself now. Revelation 13:16-18   http://www.verichipcorp.com/|`|ebc5fdfac8f50e088056beb5d5d6f767aa	I guess you could call the god of the Christians an illusion upheld by aggresive faithful who believe everything a book says, but can prove none of what the book says.|`|7qa2tMgCaa	So that they have something to look forward to when they are feeling like **** for when they die, that they will go to some paradise and live forever.   but ya, to be honest i don't know, the bible really doenst make any sense, so full of contradictions...  I think it has to do with a lack of education, where the individuals will believe things that make no sense, such as the universe being created as it is now in seven (or six) days.   It might be argued that there are educated religious people, but i think that they believe simply because they were raised that way, and so that is all they've known.|`|JMOLRKRraa	Because once you believe He shows Himself.

That, and people feel alone and insignificant.  They may feel a need to be cared about and for.  Someone or something has their best interests at heart.  It is amazing what people can do with their lives when they believe that someone supports their efforts and cares about them.  For those who do not have an emotional support system, a belief there is a God who loves and supports them in their journey through this life, can help them be good upstanding people and gives them a sense of continuity and justice in their life.    It's when greed and manipulation enter the scenario that a person's life goes downhill fast.   Unfortunately a lot of religions do that to people.  It's amazing what "free will' can do.    That's my opinion and I'm sticking to it.

On the other hand the hobgoblin is an object or a source of fear, dread, or harassment; a bugbear.    A bugbear is a fearsome imaginary creature, especially one evoked to frighten children.

9mLjDa5kaa	Heaven, only because I believe in Jesus alone for salvation.  That is the only way to get into heaven  :)      The  truth is that death brings IMMEDIATE heaven or hell, depending ONLY on whether you believed the truth about Jesus in this life or not.     So to be in heaven and not hell, believe the truth about Jesus now! :)     Only faith alone in Jesus saves! Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation.     The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|U64Aefc6aa	Straight into the mouths of the bugs and worms that eat everyone else.|`|VmGcNErkaa	Unlike the delusions of the first couple that posted, Like everyone I am aware that when you die yiou get eaten by Maggots Soldier of God or not...

"All that your hand finds to do, do with your very power, for there is no work nor devising nor knowledge nor wisdom in Sheol, the place to which you are going."

The bit following (choosing it, for some particular reason, above the other products available) is expanding on the bit before - therefore a colon(:) is appropriate here.|`|0KpnDHZsaa	A comma would be fine.  To be clearer, you could use an em dash ("", & m d a s h ; in HTML), though you shouldn't use too many em dashes in one piece of writing.    Do not use a semicolon; those are only for connecting what could be two separate sentences.  (That was an example.)  A colon would also be inappropriate, so I think you have only two options:  a comma or an em dash.  (That was also an example.)    Also, I advise against using the phrase "recall their product", because it sounds like a recall in the sense of a retraction of a defective product.  I suggest saying "recollect" or "remember", or rephrasing the sentence.

AA11440601	Probably not.    Angels are spirit and not physical beings.    St. Augustine says: "'Angel' is the name of their office, not of their nature. If you seek the name of their nature, it is spirit'; if you seek the name of their office, it is angel': from what they are, spirit,' from what they do, angel.'"     With their whole beings the angels are servants and messengers of God. Because they "always behold the face of my Father who is in heaven" they are the "mighty ones who do his word, hearkening to the voice of his word."    As purely spiritual creatures angels have intelligence and will: they are personal and immortal creatures, surpassing in perfection all visible creatures, as the splendor of their glory bears witness.    From the Incarnation to the Ascension, the life of the Word incarnate is surrounded by the adoration and service of angels.     When God "brings the firstborn into the world, he says: Let all God's angels worship him.'" (Heb 1:6)    Their song of praise at the birth of Christ has not ceased resounding in the Church's praise: "Glory to God in the highest!" (Lk 2:14)    They protect Jesus in his infancy, serve him in the desert, strengthen him in his agony in the garden, when he could have been saved by them from the hands of his enemies as Israel had been. (Cf. Mt 1:20; 2:13, 19; 4:11; 26:53; Mk 1:13; Lk 22:43; 2 Macc 10:29-30; 11:8)    Again, it is the angels who "evangelize" by proclaiming the Good News of Christ's Incarnation and Resurrection. (Cf. Lk 2:8-14; Mk 16:5-7)    They will be present at Christ's return, which they will announce, to serve at his judgment. (Cf. Acts 1:10-11; Mt 13:41; 24:31; Lk 12:8-9)    For more information, see the Catechism of the Catholic Church, sections 328 and following: http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt1s...

rThIVk2maa	It's okay, I understand. People are on time when they want to be on time. Occasionally things do make you late, such as an accident on the freeway or a sudden blizzard, but it's rare and if it happens enough, you learn to compensate.    I make it a rule to not wait on people who are habitually late. Once they realize they're not going to be accommodated, it's amazing how much more they are on time.|`|rJJhMQ37aa	I don't see why you need to be polite about it.  Just tell them to get up earlier.    One day, I was driving to work.  A car passed me (speeding) on a curve, and the passenger flipped the bird at me. I was doing the speed limit.  Made me angry   As I got to my job, I saw that car parked at valet and the passenger, in valet uniform, was getting out.    I went in to my office, and grumbled about it with our very young shift manager.  So, SM called valet, asked them to send the young man who had just arrived, having come down Elm St , to the shift office.       So when this kid came into his office, I heard the shift manager  yell at this kid.  "Why did you flip the bird at my MOTHER???"    The kid was dumbfounded.  (So was I.  I am not the SM's mother.  Admittedly, I look like I could be, tho.)  But the kid managed to squeak out "I was just trying to get to work on time."  The SM. yelled "So leave home 15 minutes earlier, and you won't have to speed, and upset older ladies!"    Tickled me.

Just read the tafsir below.    .........................................  In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.    Muhammed is the Prophet of God, and those who are with him are strong against unbelievers, [but] compassionate among each other. You will see them bow and prostrate themselves....(1)    ***********    Through telling of the elevated qualities and characteristics which were the reason for the Companions being the most elevated of human kind after the prophets, the start of this verse describes through its explicit meaning the excellent qualities which would mark the class of the Companions. And through its implied meaning, the verse alludes to the Rightly-Guided Caliphs, who would succeed to the office of the Prophet (PBUH) after his death through the institution of the Caliphate, and gives news of the fine attributes which were what most distinguished each of them and marked them out. It is as follows:    And those who are with him alludes to Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, who was distinguished and famous for being among the Prophet's special followers and party to his conversation, and again for entering among his special followers by being the first to die. While are strong against the unbelievers points to Umar, who in the future would cause the countries of the globe to tremble at his conquests, and with his justice would descend on tyrants like a thunderbolt. And compassionate among each other gives news of Uthman, who, in the future when the most serious dissension was being fomented, would sacrifice his own life and spirit out of perfect kindness and compassion so that the blood of Muslims should not be spilt, preferring to be martyred wrongfully while reading the Qur'an. And so too, You will see them bow and prostrate themselves [in prayer], seeking grace from God and [His] good pleasure tells that with his complete worthiness to undertake the Caliphate and government, and his heroism, and his choosing perfect asceticism, worship, poverty, and frugality, and whose bowing and prostrating in prayer was corroborated by everyone, Ali (May God be pleased with him) was not responsible for his position in the future and the wars and strife in which he was involved, and that his intention and wish was for Divine favour.

SO SAD.|`|AA10375065	12 IMAMS FROM THE QURESH?     Islam rejected the superiority of Arabs over Non-Arabs because it claims to be a Universal Religion. Why you Shia oppose the basic concepts of Islam??  Mostly you play with the words and confuse new commers / reverts. Pls. be advised that all early Calips were from different tribes of Quresh. However there was no such restriction as you impose on Muslims. You should read The Last Surmon of Prophet   before you come back on this International Forum.     Quran says:"Obey Allah, obey Rasool and Ullul-Amar amongst you (believers)".  Khilafat (Caliphood) is very well attached to the meaning of "Ullul-amar" since they were selected by the nation and they perfectly resolved all day-to-day affairs of Muslim Ummah. They inforced the Commandments of Allah and his Rasool and promoted Islam to the 4 corners of the world. What else we should expect from our National Leaders and Heros?    Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) did not desire any WASI, HELPER or a "divine-Imam" like Moses who got Haroon to lead Israelites in religious matters, because Muhammad was aware of the evil of   raceism created in Israelites after the death of Moses.   We Sunni do not believe in your fabricated Hadiths of 12 Imams from the descendants of Abu Talib - the enemy of Islam!    The word "Imam or Imamat" is not found in Quran which you Shia-sabai have reserved for Quresh rather specifically for the Banu Abutalib - the weakest tribe of the Quresh having no distinction in accepting Islam or spreading Islam during or after the prophet Muhammad (pbuh)!     The head of the Banu Hashim tribe, Abdul Munaf - means servant of imaginary goddess "MUNAF", did not accept Islam in spite of several invitations from prophet Muhammad.  His elder son "Talib" died on Kufer in the battle of Bader in 3rd Hijri. What speciality is attached with this Tribe or sect of Quresh???    You cannot change Muslim faith, belief and the historical facts:  None of the Companions (Sahaba) or Early Muslim Scholars or any Sunni Book recognized the Imamat of Ali (ra) and his descendants because Ali (ra) never claimed to be a "divine-Imam" for 26 years. He had been worshipping (praying) Allah behind Abu Baker, Umer and Osman (May Allah be pleased with all of them).    Justify your Jewish concepts and behaviour to impose 12 Quresh by virtue of Raceism! No Sunni can accept your evil thoughts.|`|SzqeeUxgaa	Khilafat means succeeding someone, taking his place.  Caliphate means to consider everybody under the Islamic jurisprudence perspective in their worldly benefits and interests, as well as in relation to the Hereafter.  He is in reality a vicegerent of the Law-maker in safeguarding the religious and worldly affairs.    Therefore, a Caliph is a person who succeeds the Prophet (Saw) in applying the Islamic jurisprudence and ruling the Muslims in their religious and worldly matters.  A Caliph is a person who safeguards the foundation of Islam according to its well-established and everlasting principles and according to the Book of Allah, the Sunnah of the Prophet (Saw) and the consensus of our righteous predecessors, and who established the Shariah and safeguards all the interests of Muslims.  He is the one who executes the rules, applies the punishments, make up for the shortcomings and equips the army with necessary weapons.    Today there is no Caliph on earth with the above-mentioned meaning.  The Muslims have to endeavour to find one, each Muslim according to his ability.     Rest Allah knows the best~!|`|uuUd5Zidaa	Never in history (in Islam) were leaders "democratically" elected, because never in history people had to sumbit to the ways of the council, or majority, or 'court'.

Imamat is in the Holy Quran,    17:71:  "(Remember) the day when We will call every people with their Imam;...."      5:12:  "And certainly Allah made a covenant with the children of Israel, and We raised up among them TWELVE chieftains..."      kalifat is somehow in the Holy Quran too, BUT NOT this kalifat.  the kalifat that Allah SWT choses, not people.    Religion is sent by Allah SWT....  ...ONLY Allah SWT choses the leaders.    when people choose their leader....  .....that's not religion, that's politics.      "O' David, WE assigned you as Caliph (successor) on the earth ..." (Quran 38:26)    Peace.        @noub    people like you will never understand.....    but i don't know....  ....maybe you do understand, but you pretend you don't.....    but let's see, Allah SWT had chosen David (PBUH) as caliph,  oh wait, but your caliphs were chosen by humans, in a so called "shura" where even Ali (as) wasn't there.....  ......you know why he wasn't there?  because while Ali (as) was busy with the funeral of the prophet Mohammad (PBUH) abubakr and omar were arguing over power......  ........it only shows how much people care.    oh wait, actually the verse did prove my point, it proved ONLY Allah SWT choses leader, and it doesn't matter if it's a prophet, a caliph or an Imam, they're ALL being chosen Allah SWT.....    if you don't get it......  ......i feel really sorry for you....                  @KTP/asker    haha, nice one  there are also these versions  mer20+10  or  mer29+1  and things like that ;)    so yeah  Khahesh mikonam ;)|`|XCTUmHPLaa	Listen my friend ,we all want to follow Islam (I am very optomist ).    My muslim Bro/sis have answered Well     As its veruy clear in muslims' mind that there is no person after Mohammad (Sallaho alaihi wsallam),who is devinly guided,infallible.and who recived revelation .    But there r Khulfah( caliphs) who r apointed by people NOT ALLAH     Caliphs has qualities like ,knowledgeable,experienced,God (ALLAH) fearing,capable of handling the issues of muslim ummah etc    But he is not Infallible And devine and not recieving any revelation     So he can be wrong in some particular issue    As we see Abu Bakr (RA) said follow me where i follow Quran & sunnah and straighten me where i go wrong .    He didnt claim that follow me bcoz i am Infallible and recieving revelation.    Omar (ra) took his decision back when corrected by an old lady on the bases of Ayah of Quran.    So thats the position of a Caliph     For the time being plz accept this short answer ,i will be happy if i can clearup any doubt u might have.  Edit @ Asker !     Dont you know abu bakr (RA)and Omar (ra) Uthman (RA)were from the clan of quraish ?  ________________________________  See the following detail for your query about Quraish    Quraysh branched out into various sub-clans, who in turn branched out into yet further sub-clans. Roughly the division corresponded to the family lines of the current chieftain of that clan having sons.    Banu Quraysh  Quraysh was divided into several sub-clans.   Banu Abd-al-dar  sub-clan of Quraysh   Banu Abd Manaf  sub-clan of Quraysh   Banu Nawfal  sub-clan of Banu Abd Manaf, clan of Mut`im ibn Adi[2]   Banu Muttalib  sub-clan of Banu Abd Manaf   Banu Hashim  sub-clan of Banu Abd Manaf, clan of Muhammad and Ali.   Banu Abd Shams  sub-clan of Banu Abd Manaf, parent clan of Banu Umayyah.   Banu Umayyah  sub-clan of Banu Abd Shams, clan of Abu Sufyan and Uthman ibn Affan   Banu Makhzum  sub-clan of Quraysh, clan of Khalid ibn al-Walid   Banu Zuhrah  sub-clan of Quraysh, clan of Sa'ad ibn Abi Waqqas   Banu Taim  sub-clan of Quraysh, clan of Abu Bakr   Banu Adi  sub-clan of Quraysh, clan of Umar ibn al-Khattab   Banu Asad (Quraysh)  sub-clan of Quraysh, clan of Abd-Allah ibn al-Zubayr and Khadijah   (uncategorized Quraysh sub-clans)  ___________________________________      Asker ! Why did not  you coment on the issue of iamam being infallible and recieving revelation ?    and u asked who is more important Abu Bakr OR Mohammad (saw)?    I dont think we should even compare a prophet to non prophet     so there is no comparison between them .    But for your satisfaction i make it very clear ,That Mohammad (sallalaho alihiwasallam)was on the top of every one >

Here's a case where if another white person was chosen, the GOP would be racist.  By selecting a black man, the GOP did it to "appear" non-racist, but still are.

oen1tuyTaa	There is nothing wrong with you.  You are obviously a very mature person and you don't see the need to have a faith in your life.  One day this may change.  People usually get brainwashed or turn to religion in times of weakness and trouble and it just becomes a plug to a hole in their life.  I am not religious either and it hasn't hurt me or harmed my life.  Im a nice kind person, my children are decent and respectful and we are very happy.  Religion/Cults...whatever you want to call it demands conditions from people...that's not real life!    Ignore the Bible bashers, this is their way of having comfort and stability in their lives, they obviously are not as strong as some but each to their own.    When you get asked on forms for your religion leave it blank or write NONE.    And when people try to shove it down your throat be polite and tell them you are glad they feel the need for mind control in their life and happy that it works for them but you arent them.    You are within your human rights to believe what you like and whatever works for you is fine by me...I couldn't care less about all this God crap either!!

AHsVdBBqaa	So the first connection I can see is neither of them are to good for you if over indulged in! They can both lead to nausea if enjoyed a little "to much."    The next connection is they are both full of nuts! When you go to New Orleans and visit Mardi Gras, you will see what I am talking about. Some of he people tend to drink a little to much and act a little nutty! Then we all know peanut butter is made out of, well peanuts!    Then the simple connection, many people spend all their money on partying. This leaves them with not much money to spend on food so they resort to cheap and simple cuisine, peanut butter and jelly.    I have also heard that during the Luling parade, there is a person dressed up as a peanut. Then they go on to play the famous peanut butter and jelly song.    You can also pack peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and they will last awhile without requiring refrigeration. This is a simple item to pack as you head out to a great party scene like Mardi Gras.    The connection I find most likely is the artists called Peanut Butter artists. they are known for their outrageous assortment of great make-up designs and outfits. You see a ton of outrageousness during Mari Gras, so I think this is the connection Helium is most likely asking for.    Not many people know of this peanut butter artistic talent. There is a large array from easy going to totally outrageously crazy styles covered in the peanut butter artistic forms.    When you browse the Internet for connections between Mardi Gras and peanut butter, you can come across man, many interesting recipes. People who frequent Mardi Gras simply seem to enjoy eating peanut butter! Manyof the recipes sound really good, and I may just have to try some of them.|`|f48d10d4bec5b5e25f9894010aed2c69aa	a lot of grease and fat and its bad for you but everyone loves it|`|JJMYeSyYaa	I used to live in New Orleans, but this is the first I"ve heard of it.

jxRHIRk9aa	Apollo is never really identified anywhere that I know of as being the driver of the chariot in Greek literature. Helios apparently came first, as he is the son of Titans while Apollo is the son of Zeus and Leto. Homer doesn't attribute any sun-god related duties to Apollo so taking that as the earliest literary mention it is likely that Apollo merely adopted more and more attributes as time progressed (A fairly common occurrence). To be honest, Apollo takes over a LOT of topics - archery, medicine, poetry, arts, music, etc.etc.etc. but that's pretty common among Olympian gods.  Titans are related to very natural concepts: The earth, sky, ocean, moon, sun, etc. They don't really branch out the way the Olympians do.|`|ODTe2l77aa	Helios really only appeared in one legend... but Apollo does the sun chariot thing after that.

MATiTs5Oaa	Dear Uriel  How old are you?  Do you have to decide what you are now, and do you need the titles and labels?   Meaning do you need to say ' I'm jewish',' I'm pagan', ' I'm buddhist ' etc now. Can't you just be what you are without feeling that inner mental chains as a bird which has been set free from her cage.....  I've read all you wrote and think you look puzzled.  I'm jewish.  I'm born one but I'm not a good one.  I don't believe everything that is written in my holy book.  But I'm not a scholar on the subject and I don't know everything about it either. Also, I don't obey all Kosher rules and all Shabath rules.  Only, to some which seem logical to me.  I relieve myself by explaining to myself that I didn't live in that Era, and if I had, I would interpret some things differently.  I take into account human error.  I tell myself that the same is true for other Holy Books of other religions as well.  The background of people create a natural bias.  Yet, I believe in God with all my heart, and I feel free to read and discover about the other religions.  I have not found anything more capturing than the one I have at hand. Even if I do, I don't have the intention of changing my religion. Yet, I have a few ideas of my own captured by points of views of other religions. They just give me a perspective.  I've read quite a few Buddhist scripts, have read the Koran, have read the second part of the Bible ( meant for Christians) , have read some Hindu material ( but failed into finishing the material I had at hand, I guess, it was difficult for me)  I think that the basics of all good religions are the same. To be a good person. First, do your best to be a good person.  At the times, the Bible was written, the Hebrew God had to be a jelaous God. One that didn't let His loyals believe anything else. Otherwise they could start sacrificing their children to Marduk again , or get lost with the beautiful virgin priestesses of the Babylon.  I'd advise you not to be afraid of God, instead to trust Him if you could, and ask for His forgiveness at quite times when you pray, even for things, you can't help believing, and for things you can't believe.  Other than that, read about other religions, together with the their history, not to find one to believe, just to understand other perspectives.  You'll be amazed by similarities.  Unchain yourself of the effort you make to make yourself believe.  Instead , just read a lot, pray, try to be a good person, and leave the rest aside.  I'll tell you a Buddhist story I like.  10 blind men wondered what an elephant was like.  So, they found an elephant, and touched it, to understand what it was like.  One touched a leg and said ' I understand, it is like a trunk of a tree.'  One touched the tail and said ' I understand, it is like a rope'  One touched a tooth and said ' I understand, it is like a sword'  One touched an ear and said ' I understand,it is like a fan'  One touched the trunk and said ' I understand, it's like a garden hose''  It goes on ...  We, the people are the blind men, and He is out there beyond our grasp. How do you know if your Goddess and Him are not reflections of Him on different mirrors?  Just relax, trust Him, read a lot, pray a lot, try to be a good person, and unchain yourself.  For a while, unchain yourself of labels too.  I'm not telling you to be like me.  In the future, you may find what you believe and believe it with all your heart.  But for now, you need to relax.  Good luck,  Amada    ======================================...  EDIT-   EDITED AGAIN _  !!!!!!!!!!!!!! WOULD YOU PLEASE READ ?   ======================================...      I went over your Q /A a little.  I am the mother of 3 teen age boys.  I really think you should not convert now.  How liberal is the Rabbi you work with?  Can you speak of your doubts with him?  Find someone who can light your path with no promises.  Tell him, you want to learn Torah, but have not decided whether you can be jewish or not. The jewish religion is sceptic, it won't embrace you with open arms, but you can be sceptic too. Just study religion without promises.   The religion should be an enlightment, a source of happiness for you, if it is a burden, you are not in the right path.  Your father's being jewish does not make you jewish at all, you must know that this religion is inherited by mothers by now. You have no obligation.  You should wait at least until it is no longer a burden.  I believe you can be more at ease if you were trying to be a reform jew.   They are better at ease with other religions, with gays or with whatever. They are more tolerant of others.  I understand this is not as strong as being orthodox.  But Let me give you an example- your situation is like a woman for instance who is trying to be the a very successfull business woman and a full time mom to 4 kids at the same time.  You can't be a wiccan and an orthodox jew at the same time.  If she takes help from a nanny, and if she accepts not to be so successful at the same time, she can be both a business woman ( sort of- she should take a lot of breaks to look after her kids from time to time- she won't be up in the hierarchy of her business- but still- she will not be a house wife either) and a mother ( not a full time mom- that is obvious ).  You can be a little new age ( not a determined Wiccan- but a few ideas of your own won't harm any one) and a reformist jew ( Who is not too religious of course) at the same time.  Plus, I couldn't read what you wrote ( Russian? Greek ? Can you translate? )?  Please would you relax and try to get happy with whatever and whoever you are?|`|NsLtN7oLaa	You've asked this before... and I have sent you a link  to my website, privately, which gives all the information  that you need to make a decision.

The past 6000 years are the percentage equivalent of the dark moon in the monthly cycle.  During this time, the earth is under the care of the male god.  The consort of the Goddess, the lover of the Goddess, and the son of the Goddess.  When this time ends, the Goddess is reborn as the virgin and goes through the cycle again.      In your example, the mother departed and the father insisted that he was the only one.  It's not that hard when simplified.  The father is bitter.  This cycle will continue and the Goddess will be reborn.      It is Her choice if she chooses to take back her old lover, or take a new one.  If She takes her old lover back, he is bound to Her will and Her ways.  If not, than a different Immortal shall take his place.  The young stag will defeat the old and reign as king.

Why would you need someone else's approval to believe in anything?  If you want to believe in something, you don't believe it.  Wanting to believe something is not the point.  You either believe or you don't, and that comes from within.      Like all human beings, you think that your point of view is the right one.  And like all human beings you'd like everyone else to notice and approve.      Sorry, belief is not like that.  It's like sexuality or skin colour: you can no more edit what you believe than you can change your skin colour.

Throughout the history of mankind, never has there been a person who has had so much effect and influence on the course of human events than Jesus Christ. The birth, life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ has not only had a profound impact on the course of human events; it has also changed the lives of countless men and women throughout history, and continues to do so today. Why? Jesus Christ said "I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father, but through Me." What exactly does this mean? Why is this of any significance to us today? When Jesus Christ said "I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father, but through Me," he was declaring that He was God. He is The Way for eternal life - not "a" way - but the only way.|`|aO4iCwtoaa	I tried answering your question before, taking it very seriously.  I'm sorry that my answer was not what you are looking for; nevertheless, it is the only answer you will get from religious Jews - of any denomination, not only Orthodox.    So long as you believe that there are many gods, and you are trying to pick the best one, Judaism is not the religion for you.  I do not believe you will ever find a rabbi willing to help you convert if you continue insisting that you are deciding whether or not to embrace the 'Jewish God' at the expense of the 'Goddess' or whichever other polytheistic religion attracts you.     I have nothing against polytheism as a religion.  It predates Judaism and will likely always exist.  There is nothing wrong with choosing to believe that there are many gods.  But Judaism does not work that way.    In Judaism, there is only one G-d. It is not that we embrace the Jewish god and reject all others, it is that we worship the only G-d there is, and reject the idea that there are multiple deities at all.  We believe that the passages in the Torah dealing with prohibiting worship of false gods or idols are not saying "don't worship them, I'M better," but are saying "I am the only G-d.  Don't take away from our relationship by worshipping that which does not exist."   The fundamental prayer of Judaism is the Shema - "Hear, Israel: Hashem is G-d, Hashem is one."  That is the pure essence of Judaism.  It does not allow for G-d to have a son, or to be separated into a trinity, or to be one among many gods.  One means there is only one.  You do not need to believe this.  But it is impossible to become a Jew unless you do.    To send back the Jewish version of your two examples:    1 - There is a young woman who is looking to be married.  There is one man in the village and he wants to marry her.  Her parents approve, but she finds things about him she doesn't like.  But she knows that there are many male monkeys in the village who have not yet found mates, and the monkeys are soft and cuddly.  What should she choose?      2 - A little child 7-10 years old has never met his mother (perhaps she died in childbirth, perhaps she abandoned him at birth, perhaps he was adopted by his father - he does not know, but she has never been in his life).  His father is a disciplinarian and even though he knows he loves him, he is not fun all the time.  He knows he should stay with his father, but he also knows in his heart that his mother must be a wonderful woman who would love him if he could just run away from his father and find her.      I realize that these two examples are not "fair" to paganism or remotely balanced.  It was hard to come up with parallel versions of your examples because your examples assume many men in the village or a human child who (by definition) could not be born without two parents originally.  So the second example doesn't really work - to make it a Jewish parallel, the child would have to be born in a lab somehow, maybe cloned from the father's DNA?  My point is, Judaism does not see G-d as a stern father forbidding his child to see their mother.  It sees G-d as the only parent, period.  You don't have to see things this way.  But in order to be Jewish, it is the only way there is to see it, because it is the way we understand the nature of G-d to be.    Again, I really think Judaism is not for you.|`|mYpVOSKfaa	It seems to me that you are torn between allegiances; haSHEM, and this goddess of yours, and that is serving two masters, or in this case a master and a mistress.  You were right when you said that the hebrew God is jealous, He did say so in the book of Exodus; I would read the whole of chapter twenty to get a better understanding of it.  Jesus did say that we should hate the sin and love the sinner.  What you need to do is choose today whom you will serve, haSHEM, or your goddess, as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.       After you have decided whom you will serve, you need to act on your decision.  This is done in three steps:        Admit: admit you are a sinner(everyone is,    including me).       Believe: believe(trust)in Jesus as Messiah.       Confess: confess your sins to Him.  I know you have probably heard that before, there are quite a number of people around handing out cards with that on them, but it is true, Jesus is Messiah, Adonai Jehoveh, and He does love you; that's why He died for you and rose from the dead on the third day.

That same black man goes and works for their competitor- and they lose profits. Equality is economically advantageous!    Another example- when people were fighting for women's rights, they promoted laws which made sure the gender ratio for universities was about 1:1. Now that more women than men apply for universities in the US, women are being discriminated against in the application process (less qualified men are accepted over them). Affirmative action backfired.    Affirmative action is discriminatory- it lengthens the process of global acceptance of previously discriminated against minorities because it promotes resentment and tries to artificially manipulate a process that will happen (and has already happened) on its own    If you need any other evidence, here is a postsecret (a blog where people send in their secrets on a post card) that says it all: http://i331.photobucket.com/albums/l476/...|`|4fgcu7bAaa	Crack vs cocaine

Yeah, its not the same as skateboarding, but everyone I roll with is straight. All of them know I'm gay; and it doesn't make a difference to them, because I can whoop their *** down a hill and I got mad skills when it comes to sliding. Obviously you've got game with your board, and if they have problem, then tell them to put up or shut up. But to be honest, most people don't care in our world. No one looks at me as 'The gay longboarder'. They just look at me as 'The douche bag who's uncle makes him longboards'. Haha.    Music. I love, read, write, breath, sleep, piss, sh* t, have sex with, and listen to music with a passion of no other. I'm in a band, the only gay member, and the great thing is, none of them care either. And I live in Idaho. Go look how republican my state is. =P Check out Pierce the Veil, they have my heart right now. Haha.    The point is, we live in the 'Alternative' scene. And for some reason, people are a little more accepting. Now, obviously, there are haters. But there are haters everywhere, bro. Someone, somewhere, whether its cus you skate or cus you're gay, wants to bring you down. And its your job to make sure that they don't. That's all you gotta do. I literally pretend they don't exist. I walk past them in stores, I don't read w/e they have on the internet, they don't exist in my world. Because in my world I can't afford to waste the time on them. Haha. Try the same.

Homosexuality has become a lot more open over the last 20 years in all kinds of different people-- football players, political figures, celebrities, etc. There are so many struggles in every ones lives and what's most important is that we continue to hold on to the things that make us happy, no matter what others might think about it.    I hope this gave you some insight, I might not be gay but that could also give you the better answer to your question. Good luck and remember how short life is, focus on you, what makes you happiest and the people most dear in your life-- forget and forgive the rest-- don't have regrets.|`|g5RS83paaa	be proud to be the gay skateboarder, there's no reason you should give it up just because your gay. People are much more accepting of it then they used to be|`|uHcGn3Yaaa	Don't let gay stereotypes rule your life.  Do what you love.  Being gay is not what defines who you are.  It's your choices and the things you do.  You love to skateboard, don't let that go because you think it's not what is appropriate for a gay person.  Like I said, gay is a label some may use, but it's not all that you are.|`|697ae04db2502a1d77e3c8fb84237406aa	i'd like to know who's creating these so   called "definitions"...you haven't come to terms with being gay.  you're still in the closet and you don't have the key to get out... turn on the light and look for the key!|`|J2VVwzJQaa	you shouldnt have to give up anything you love regardless of gender, race or sexuality. If you liked the person who you were then there should be nothing stopping you. I understand that you are scared and I think I would be too, but if you change yourself to fit in, then eventually you arent gonna be you anymore.   You will make friends in the skateboard world as long as you are you. Changing yourself will only make you miss it and you have been skateboarding for 10 years. Thats since you started secondary school. Do you really want to stop doing something which you have been doing for a while as well as something you enjoy?  I think you should be who you want to be rather than who you feel you need to be in order to fit into society,  You will be fine and you will make friends. Just dont give up and when you leave for college dont be shy but make friends. Im sure you will be fine and just remember, being gay doesnt mean you have to change who you are :)  x x x|`|N4APv37Gaa	You dont have to "Change" ur self!!!HAHAHAHahaha  anyways, i find maschline men WAY hotter! ;))))|`|uBkvqcY6aa	Why would you need to change?

Skating has nothing to do with who you're attracted to. I know quite a few gay boys who love to skateboard. I don't see why you would stop doing something you love, something that makes you who you are, just because that one little thing has change. You have to be who you are, and if who you are is a skater, be a skater.|`|NRiuGQvIaa	just beacuse you enjoy skating does not make a diffrence wether ur gay or not just enjoy skating beacuse you love it & dont ever change  for no one|`|ae3ecab489f9cbbdd2b51fb0492f64d3aa	You are who you are in every way. Why would you have to give up any part of your life just because your gay? I am female, straight and 63 years old. I have raised 3 sons and 1 daughter all straight. However, I have a lot of gay friends both male and female. My husband and I owned an advertising agency for years and we came in contact with all kinds of people. Both of us just take the people for who they are and it does not matter to us if they are gay or straight, black or white or asian or hispanic. We have raised our kids to feel the same way. Everyone is different and that is what makes life so interesting. Somehow you are under the impression that because you are gay that you can only hang out with gay people. This is not true. You can still skate board and who is to say that you might even meet a gay pal while skate boarding? Just be yourself always. You will be accepted by gay and straight people. If your going out west to college you will be meeting all kinds of different people and you will have to be accepting just as they will have to be. We are all just people. Relax and enjoy life and stop sweating the small stuff.|`|nisfxpXHaa	I always thought being yourself and even a little different was a part of the skateboard culture.

Good Luck.|`|5M45pak7aa	whats different u like dudes they like chicks your not in any way lesser than them|`|fz33SWwIaa	NO!! You don't have to change anything about who you are or what you like to do. Just do what you like to do, and enjoy who you are. I'm a lesbian and I am femanin and so is my partner; when people meet us they are shocked at the appearance of us both. Its other peoples views that are causeing you to feel this way. There is no right or wrong things to do if your gay, just be who you are.|`|LQpU6Zd8aa	Why should being gay mean you have to stop what you find relaxing and fun?  Are you suddenly going to start running people over or doing strange things?  you seem like a young man who has his feet on the ground( sorry I just realized that was an unintended pun)   And as far as the skate parks go, no one will know you are gay unless you tell them and besides being known as the gay skater isn't bad there are worse things to be called.  If you are comfortable with who you are and what you do then please don't ever let your fear of others opinions of you stop you from doing and enjoying it.   I myself find that at the end of the day if I can honestly say I helped at least 1 person or didn't hurt anyone (feelings etc) and I like myself then to heck with others opinions of me because after all it's their opinion and not mine.|`|20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	Being gay is only part of who you are. I'm straight but I don't consider that who I am! You don't have to change a thing about yourself, you have nothing to be ashamed of. Sounds to me that if you were to describe yourself to someone who's never met you the first thing you would say is somewhere along the lines of "I love to skateboard" not I'm gay. Just roll with it. Don't allow anyone to make you an outcast.|`|aWPmvPpfaa	just be yourself. sometimes other people make it hard, but you'll be better off in the long run, and they will respect you too. just don't let people make you bitter. maybe you can help other skaters come out......|`|xjEaDBFfaa	Don't think people are going to be hating you because your gay and skateboard.     I have a gay friend and I can talk to him about anything! He is very uncomfortable with his self, but we are very close and he tells me all his personal stuff. He is very uncomfortable about the way he walks because he walks like straight guys. I told him people dont care because they obiously don't a lot of guys are *** holes and only care about themselves.     It seems like all gay guys are the kind of guy you would want to be with only because they are so caring. When he askes me questions I tell him the truth. One thing I can truely say about gay guys is that you are not the only gay guy in this world. But you are the kind of people women want! If you did decide to go straight don't be an *** hole to women that really hurts when guys do that.     If you need to talk email me and I would be more then welcome to.|`|rDFnsFf2aa	no be your-self enjoy life

There have been some posts here that made a great deal of sense to me, and helped influence me a bit.

I think I'd go so far as to say that there's something out there but that most Christians/Muslims/Budhists and so on have got it wrong and are looking too deep into something they can't prove.

Mb5YUZMwaa	I'm not sure what your question is but assuming it could be two scenarios:    1. If you're looking to write an essay on extreme hair care you could just Google stuff.    2. If you're trying to get the meaning of the term "extreme hair care" it would mean taking really good care of your hair, I mean putting in a lot of time and effort behind it and looking after it, nourishing it, etc etc.....    Hope this helps.....Ciao

There is no reason you couldn't volunteer to sit in on a board session if you first told them what you were doing.  Many school boards are board run and are political.  You will have to work at it but I believe you can find a political body that will let you sit through a session or two.
UqgCazhGaa	Only those who are ignorant will protest.   See below the what Govinda means:     SC 16                  Awakening Love of God     Although Ajamila indirectly chanted the holy name of Lord Narayana through the medium of the name of his youngest son, he at once remembered Lord Narayana. Therefore in Vedic society children are given God's names. It is not that the child becomes God. If we name a child Narayana, it is understood that he is Narayana dasa, the servant of Lord Narayana. Similarly, we give our disciples spiritual names, such as Visnu dasa, Vamana dasa, or Krsna dasa. That Ajamila remembered Lord Narayana by calling his son of the same name is confirmed in the Srimad-Bhagavatam, which says that the power of the sound vibration of the holy name is absolute.     One attains freedom from all sinful reactions immediately upon recitation of the holy name, even if one does not understand the potency of the name. Whether one is chanting with devotion and reverence or without any faith, more sinful reactions are vanquished than a sinful man can commit. Krsna's name has such unlimited potency. When Caitanya Mahaprabhu was chanting the Hare Krsna maha-mantra in Navadvipa, the people used to imitate the Lord and His associates. At that time the land was ruled by Mohammedans, and sometimes the people would go to one of the government officials and complain, "The Hindus are chanting 'Hare Krsna! Hare Krsna!' dancing wildly, and thrashing their arms about." In this way they imitated the sankirtana of Lord Caitanya. In Western countries the onlookers also imitate our chanting of Hare Krsna when we go out to chant on the street. Even by imitating, however, they become purified. The holy name is so powerful that if someone derides us, saying, "Why are you chanting Hare Krsna--it is nonsense!" he also gets spiritual benefit.    680803SB.MON                 Lectures  Guest: Is it simply the nature of the name Krsna that this particular name is the most powerful?  Prabhupada: Yes. God... God's name is according to His action, God's name. Just like Krsna. This "Krsna" name is given... That is explained also.                         krsir bhu-vacakah sabdo                        nas ca nirvrti-vacakah                       tayor aikyam param brahma                        krsna ity abhidhiyate    Krsna's name... Krs means to become, to appear. Bhu-vacakah. Or attraction. We have got attraction for material enjoying, and nas ca nirvrti-vacakah. Na means ananda. Another meaning is negation. So "the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who, by His attractive features, by attraction of His bodily beauty, by attraction of His opulence, by attraction of His pastimes, so many things..." Krsna is all-attractive. And one who is all-attractive, He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the meaning of "Krsna."     Similarly, "Govinda." That also has meaning. Go means cow, go means senses, and go means land. So in these three features Krsna can be applied. He gives pleasure to the senses; therefore He's Govinda. He's very kind to the cows; therefore He's Govinda. He is the proprietor of all land; therefore He's Govinda. So in this way "Govinda" means the Supreme Personality of Godhead, "Krsna" means the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Similarly, if you have got any word which means the Supreme Personality of Godhead, you can chant.    SB 1.14.34 T      The Disappearance of Lord Krsna                                                 bhagavan api govindo                      brahmanyo bhakta-vatsalah                       kaccit pure sudharmayam                       sukham aste suhrd-vrtah                                 SYNONYMS       bhagavan--the Personality of Godhead, Krsna; api--also; govindah--one who enlivens the cows and the senses; brahmanyah--devoted to the devotees of the brahmanas; bhakta-vatsalah--affectionate to the devotees; kaccit--whether; pure--in Dvaraka Puri; sudharmayam--pious assembly; sukham--happiness; aste--does enjoy; suhrt-vrtah--surrounded by friends.                             TRANSLATION       Is Lord Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who gives pleasure to the cows, the senses and the brahmanas, who is very affectionate towards His devotees, enjoying the pious assembly at Dvaraka Puri surrounded by friends?                                 PURPORT    Here in this particular verse the Lord is described as bhagavan, govinda, brahmanya and bhakta-vatsala. He is bhagavan svayam, or the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, full with all opulences, all power, all knowledge, all beauty, all fame and all renunciation. No one is equal to or greater than Him. He is Govinda because He is the pleasure of the cows and the senses. Those who have purified their senses by the devotional service of the Lord can render unto Him real service and thereby derive transcendental pleasure out of such purified senses. Only the impure conditioned living being cannot derive any pleasure from the senses, but being illusioned by false pleasures of the senses, he becomes servant of the senses. Therefore, we need His protection for our own interest. The Lord is the protector of cows and the brahminical culture. A society devoid of cow protection and brahminical culture is not under the direct protection of the Lord, just as the prisoners in the jails are not under the protection of the king but under the protection of a severe agent of the king. Without cow protection and cultivation of the brahminical qualities in human society, at least for a section of the members of society, no human civilization can prosper at any length. By brahminical culture, the development of the dormant qualities of goodness, namely truthfulness, equanimity, sense control, forbearance, simplicity, general knowledge, transcendental knowledge, and firm faith in the Vedic wisdom, one can bec|`|Ou4oqQkeaa	'go' means 'soul/being' and 'vindA' means 'dweller/abode'. Govinda (the supreme God ) is part of all creation(beings) and 'all beings' are a part(physical) of Him. This invalidates caste,creed,race,religion. But these divisions happen(invalidates faith/principle), when someone bearing or believing in such a name of Govinda, hurts/harms other beings(incl. of animals).|`|8wHg5MECaa	Any one can do anything.

It is called earlier as 'Sanadana Dharma' which means, the righteous type of living for ALL in the world. Sanadana Dharma is not a religion.     1) Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (World is a large family):    Maha Upanishad, Chapter 6, Verse 72:    "ayam bandhurayam neti ganana laghuchetasam  udaracharitanam tu vasudhaiva kutumbakam"      "This one is a friend and that one a stranger" is the thinking of narrow-hearted people but for the large-hearted persons, the world itself is a family.    2) Kanian Poongunranar, a Tamil poet in Purananuru (Tamli Sangam poem) said:    "Yaadhum oore yavarum kelir."    It means that every place is our place; everybody is our kith and kin.    3) A sanskrit sloka ends with,  'Loka samasta sukhino bhavantu' means 'May all the world be peaceful and happy at all times'.    4) Thayumanavar, another Tamil poet said:    Ellorum inbutrirukka ninaipadhuve-allamal veronrariyom Paraparame     Oh Universal Lord, I do not know anything other than to wish prosperity for all (in the world)!     B) Govinda:    1) Govinda is the fourth name of important 12 (Dwadasa) names of Lord Vishnu.    'Go' means cow and   'vinda'  is "protector of cows".   The story of how Krishna was given the name Govinda is described in detail in the Vishnu Purana. After lifting Govardhan hill to protect the villagers and cows of Vrindavan, the lord of devas Indra awarded him the title.    A famous prayer called the Bhaja Govindam was composed by Adi Sankara, a summary of which is; "If one just worships Govinda, one can easily cross this great ocean of birth and death." This refers to the belief that worshipful adoration of Krishna can lead believers out of the cycle of reincarnation, or samsara, and into an eternal blissful life in Vaikuntha, 'beyond this material world' where Govinda resides.    2) According to Adi Sankara's commentary on the Vishnu Sahasranama, translated by Swami Tapasyananda, Govinda has three meanings:    The sages call Krishna "Govinda" as He pervades all the worlds, giving them power.     The Shanti Parva of the Mahabharata states that Vishnu restored the earth that had sunk into the netherword, or Patala, so all the devas praised Him as Govinda (Protector of the Land).     Alternatively, it means "He who is known by Vedic words alone". Adi Sankara's Bhaja Govindam prayer expresses the value of inner devotion to Krishna.    3) Govinda is a name of Lord Vishnu and appears as the 187th and 539th names in the Vishnu Sahasranama.    187.  Govindah -The word Go in Sanskrit has four meanings: Earth, Cows, Speech and Vedas. As the earth is the supporter of everything that is existing, He, who is the supporter of everything within the individual, is called Govinda; He, who is the Protector of the Cows and played the part of Gopaala in Gokula, is the very controller of the animal instincts and passions in the bosom of man; One, without whom, no speech can ever emerge out of any throat-He being the very Life in all Creatures says Kenopanishad; and the Highest Speech is the declaration of Truth in the Vedas. The Lord Himself is the very Theme and the Author of the Vedas. This great Self is Mahavishnu.     539.  Govindah -One who is to be known (Vid) through the declarations of the Vedanta (Go). In Vishnu Tilaka we read:     Here, Gobhih means the statements and declarations of the Upanishads.    C) Sanadana Dharma, The Universal Umbrella:    1) Vishnuh, Universal GOD:    (i) "Veveshti Vyaapnoti iti Vishnuh"    Vishnuh -The term Vishnu is dissolved as "Veveshti Vyaapnoti iti Vishnuh"-That which pervades everywhere is Vishnu. That which has the nature of pervasiveness is Vishnu. He is the one who pervades all and nothing ever pervades Him.     (ii) Eesaavaasyam Idam Sarvam:    All this is indwelt, pervaded by the Lord. This very same idea is described in the typical style of the Puranas, in the incarnation of the Lord as Vaamana, the short-boy (Vamana), who, with His three feet, measured the entire universe. Because of this act, the Lord got the name Vishnu, says Mahaabhaarata. Vishnu Purana (3-1) says: The root Vis means to enter. The entire world of things and beings is pervaded by Him.    2) All spiritual paths essentially lead us to the same truth.     (i)  "??? ?? ?????? ????? ??????" (Rigveda Book no. 1, hymn No. 164 verse 46).    'Ekam Sat, Viprah Bahudha Vadanti'     'To what is One, sages give many names'     (ii) "Akashath pathitham Thoyam  Yatha gatchathi Sagaram  Sarva Deva Namaskaram  KESHAVAM Prathi gatchathi"    'As all rivers join the ocean, so all the faiths reach the same Truth as their final destination. Offerings to all Gods, reach the Supreme Deity alone.'|`|AA12156048	no because hinduism is the origin of all intellectual religions,Vishnu is reality|`|1tLmTjBxaa	govinda goooooovinda,  yes welcome!....but you've gotta sacrifice your pub culture..and dont get beaten by ram sene...otherwise therez no point in beeing a hindu|`|cAnha6sjaa	Hinduism is not hierarchical, not monolithic and not committed to a specific dogma.

For example: she shouldn't be like " Guess what, I love girls" that might leave them in an awkward shock and a very long moment of silence. She should be more like " Mom and Dad I have something to tell you guys, as my parents I know you love me and that you should be understanding of my feelings, and I am gay."

She just needs to be ready for a big disappointment. She may have to move out so she needs to be prepared. But she may be surprised like I was. Only tell the parents IF she is ready and is comfortable with herself. If she is pretty sure they will be not be supportive don't tell them just quite yet. Just be true to yourself. It is very difficult and delicate situation.   I wish your friend the best and it is so great that she was able to trust you enough to tell you and you did not disown her. You are a true friend.

She should only come out to her parents if she is an adult and completely independent of them. Do you think she will be in any danger? These are things she needs to think about.

That way, if the are caught at least one or two of them have the chance to make it across.     It would sound to me that Mexican police are finally breaking down heavily on people who gather together (I would assume more towards night) in order to prevent further problems between the US & Mexico.     It would, in effect, be similar to many large cities who prevent teenagers over groups of three from being in malls after a certain hour. In order to prevent problems, they just don't like the "problem type of people" gather together.
7J1D1IyRaa	I think the best solution for this person is to not have any more operations, act like a man in public but not feel any guilt for thinking of himself as a woman in the private life.

A sex change, is a much bigger change than eyebrows, which will grow back.  On that premise alone, I can not imagine sex change operations are okay.  If someone has a bad leg, and an operation will fix that, that is one thing.  But saying God gave you the wrong gender, is something else, IMO.    Just to be clear, I hold to:  Judge not lest ye be judged.  I have known good people that do things that don't adhere to God's laws.  It is up to God to decide if such actions are okay or not; if He will forgive or not.

Everyone simply loves to cast stones to those Christians"trying" to do what's right, when they mess up once.    It is interesting though.

1cef0b31719e047b8c16caf5d29cfedbaa	In some ways yes (just look at a music video - scantily clad women, being called b's and ho's, vulgar language, violence) and in some ways no (the idea's of what's right has changed - some for the better, especially in terms of ethnic and women's rights)     Our younger generations have less respect for themselves and their bodies, as well as other people. Not everyone is that way but it sure looks that way sometimes.|`|AA10873763	Did they?  We have equal rights for all races and genders (nearly, at least), education and health care for everyone.

I think giving welfare to people who have an obscene amount of children is the very root of the cause. Why do we pay people to keep having babies they can't take care of/ afford?     Check out the movie "Idiocracy"    That's just my opinion. We have  these illegitimate and uneducated heathens by the masses taking over our country.     Just my opinion.|`|4ESlizXraa	I think in some ways you're correct, we have lost some of our moral standards or lowered them significantly.  A lot of that has to do with the informality of our society.  People use to dress up to go to the movies but now you can see people wearing really... interesting things to the movies.  I don't mind that so much as going to plays and concerts (and I'm thinking symphonies here, not Miley Cyrus or Next Door Down) and seeing people in jeans and t shirts.    There was an elegance that we lost.    More troubling, however, is the lack of personal responsibility but I think that falls more under ethics which have also taken a nose dive and to a much more serious effect.    Gone are the days when you could make a mistake, own up to it and be forgiven.  Now we feel the need to point out how other people allowed the mistake to occur and somehow make the fault theirs.    It was refreshing the other night to see an interview with President Obama where he took the responsibility for naming people to his cabinet who had issues with taxes and had to step down.  He said that should have been checked and wasn't and as the President the responsibility fell on him.  I admired him for that.    I understand if people make the same mistake over and over its a problem, but lets give them the benefit of the doubt the first time.|`|9ac4efe2c281bd465dbf8d33952bdfb8aa	Moral standards are and always have been changing.|`|Kkxl8jchaa	it didn't go south what are you talking about|`|VUqlQmJcaa	Responsibility and repercussions or the lack thereof is my reasoning behind it, there is no reaping what you sow and people have discovered ways of pawning off the blame of their actions/mistakes onto other people or at the very least lessening the blame on themselves. And you will find most people disagree that this nation has little to no morals I have discovered however that those are the ones usually that lack them the most and are trying to find ways to make you look bad for asking.
AYs6iFlLaa	I can't speak for the actions of others,or their reasoning. You know as well as I do that there are Many Christians doing wrong things too. Just as you have no power over them, I have no Power over Muslims who chose violence and hate. I was Slapped in the face by a Christian Man for being a Muslim "in his white Christian State(pennsylvania)" He said that I or my Children didn't deserve to live in America ( I was born here!) I have been spit on by children, who's parents Quoted me the Bible, and my own Mother, a devout Christian woman, will no longer allow us in her home or has anything good to say about us, but doesn't mind taking our money. All the things you listed above that Jesus (pbuh) said I live by. I no longer travel long distances alone with my kids and I rarely go to unfamiliar places alone. When the police arrived after the man hit me, he agreed with the man and I was told that I should "move along". When the child spit on me, I simply walked away. I no longer visit my Mother's home.     We have no way of controlling People who use God to crticize or endanger others, Just as you had no way of stopping anything that happened to me. If you seek out why this is happening, it comes down to Government propaganda, and misuse of religious beliefs to control the minds of People within that Governments authority. If you study Islam and it's true beliefs and values you would see that they are near to your Christian Values. Islam brought a way of Life. If it was incorporated in today's society we would see much good in the world.|`|RVWyPicKaa	How many Native Americans were massacred in America in the name of Christianity?

How many people and I stress PEOPLE were killed in the crusade in the name of Christianity? Far more than in the name of any other religious beliefs and faiths? Yet you have the gall to point the finger at others!     when medieval Europe were killing jews for nothing but the fact that they were jews it was the muslims  lands who the jews seeked refuge in. the evidence is there because when the christians recaptured spain (andalusia) the jewish inhabitants fleed with the muslims to escape the rage of anti-semetic views within the christians at the time. and soforth there are many of them living in north africa        QURA'AN:  "Whosoever kills a man then it is as if he has killed all of man kind and whosoever saves a man then it is as if he has saved all of mankind    One more point i forgot to add. What was the purpose of Seung-Hui Cho's killings at Virginia techin April 2 years ago? Was he "dying for Jesus" as claimed in the video? Was he a christian? The guy obviously had some problem in his life, no doubt about that. But for someone who doesn't understand it would think that Christianity was about commiting suicide and killing others, everybody here knows that.

Sura (2:244) - "Then fight in the cause of Allah, and know that Allah Heareth and knoweth all things."    Sura (2:216) - "Fighting is prescribed for you, and ye dislike it. But it is possible that ye dislike a thing which is good for you, and that ye love a thing which is bad for you. But Allah knoweth, and ye know not."

Sura (9:29) - "Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, nor acknowledge the religion of Truth, (even if they are) of the People of the Book, until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued."    Sura (9:30) - "And the Jews say: Ezra is the son of Allah; and the Christians say: The Messiah is the son of Allah; these are the words of their mouths; they imitate the saying of those who disbelieved before; may Allah destroy them; how they are turned away!"

The actions of Muhammad, who is the perfect example for a Muslim, show what the religion is like.  Muhammad and the history are violent and that is what islam is.  It doesn't matter what they claim.  The facts say otherwise.    EDIT:  We should clear this up once and for all.  A Christian who is violent is not following Jesus, since Jesus never hurt anyone.

I would just expect, at the minimum, a couple of weeks before I got it. This way I could spend some time video taping myself with my loved ones. It is not losing the memories I would be most scared of, but losing who I am inside of those memories. It would be difficult to completely rebuild relationships I'd had either way, but I think at least seeing the way I was before the surgery would help me to understand how much I cared about others and they cared about me.    If it were a loved one, I would encourage them to do the same, but ultimately I would let it be their decision.|`|xTRMSm7yaa	I would do anything to erase my memory...wether i had a tumor or not    edit: ok maybe not all of my memory but some, cause the one suer made a good point about religon and what not|`|R1BKmn3xaa	i will do istikhara and ask god to enlight me for the right decision  if it is a loved one i advis him to do the same|`|6Z4fKZ8aaa	My baby brother actually HAD a tumor the size of a golf ball in his brain when he was 4 and had to get it taken out in order to avoid death. Alhamdulillah if he hadn't been in that car crash, he wouldn't be alive today. But the operation totally screwed up his impulse control and so now Alhamdulillah he is fine, alhamdulillah his MRI scans are coming back clear Alhamdulillah, but he has a speech problem (not sure if that was because of his tumor or not) and sometimes he has trouble sitting still and what not in class.  But Alhamdulillah so far everything is fine.  Now the only thing we have to worry about is the shun plate in his head (he has a full shun plate inside his head to keep water from filling the brain and that will be in him for life) we have to worry about him getting seizures later on in life, death, or something else happening to him because those shun plates do come with risks which we are well aware of.  As for what I would do, well I'd probably do what I did when we first found out my brother had a tumor, I'd pray to God to let my brother heal from the tumor and offer up my salvation (even though I'm Muslim) to save my brother and ultimately leave it in Allah's(SWT) hands.|`|nzwYJbEFaa	my loved one had a bad car crash about 6 months ago in which a peice of his scull had to be removed so he still has a hole in his skull but its covered by skin he was told that if he were 2 get a hard blow to that area the result would most likely be death paralyzed  or a stroke they also advised him to go to Germany and have an operation to somehow fix his skull but he would have a 70% chance of not making it so we are still weighing our options|`|472e38086de52f52e7089f1f29ef15ddaa	I have watched a loved one die horribly of the treatment for a malignant brain tumor. His family suffers still struggling to pay the monumental medical bills. He suffered horribly because of the treatments and still died. His tumor was the kind that grows back every single time and canot be defeated. They did not explain that to him, of course , because that would mean they got less money out of him as he would die sooner without treatment (but also with NO pain but minor headaches here and there ) but would still die. ( we all have to anyway ) .     If it were my mother or my father they would know from watching the struggle of our relative their own decision. If it were my decision to make ...if it were me dying of such a cancer like my relative.. incurable.. I would just take the course of no surgery..just medication to alleviate pain until demise. I would also make sure I told every single person how much I loved them all and hug them and promise to be there to greet them with Gods permission when it is their time to go to God.

I'm not sure why other people on the forum would call you a loser. Most of them can't even spell anyway.

If you don't seem to come across as intelligent, they have no way of knowing otherwise. You could be an astrophysicist, but there is no way for them to be aware of that. So, they assume that you must be dumb based on your lack of grammar skills.|`|1cef0b31719e047b8c16caf5d29cfedbaa	The whole idea of forums is to be heard and get your point across.

After the Sumerians, Babylonians, Assyrians, Egyptians...all polytheistic, worshipping both gods and goddesses....along came the Johnny-come-lately Hebrews, who treated women like s h i t and were horrified that anyone could ever worship a WOMAN, so they created a MALE god, a monster who demanded unconditional obedience and KILLED all those who would not submit. And to put the final nail in the coffin of the GODDESS, concocted the Adam and Eve myth that made Eve a second class human being, and the seductress who was the fount of all evil.     Finally, along came Christianity, saddled with the monster god of the Old Testament...needing to distance themselves from him and his crimes...so they concocted a "SON" who was proclaimed a god of Love, the Prince of Peace, but who turned out to be a chip off the old block...an eternally vengeful godling, whose only original idea was to invent ETERNAL burning for the Finite failing of fallible men.

It's basically the enzymes from pigs that are haram.    You're also right that you cannot know whether a certain food is haram or halal, but your best bet is to look at the ingredients. If that certain food doesn't have any ingredients labeled on it, then you just eat it with knowing that it doesn't have any sort of pig enzymes, pork, etc. in it.

I 100% agree with TyPe R 2NeR's answer; perfectly accurate (Islamic) answer.   Anything that contains pig/pork-related ingredients, we cannot eat it (this includes gelatin , by the way). Always read what the ingredients of the food you're eating are, and if you're unsure, it's just best to avoid eating it then. If it contains something from animals other than pig (like cow, etc.), it's ok to eat use/eat it still.     Umm... I'd strongly suggest asking questions about haraam/halaal from Imaams or some highly educated Muslims you may know. This place is not the best for such answers. NO!

Maybe just float by your instructor first at the end of class before you plan on bringing them.  "Do you mind if I bring some muffins for us to enjoy in class tomorrow morning?"    You teacher will appreciate the heads up and you will get his/her position on your proposition.    Seriously....  You can bring muffins to my classes.  :)|`|aGRJ6MPdaa	I'd say try it once.

The beings do not realise that they are part of the Supreme being, as their perception is obsured by Maya.  When they realise they are part of the Supreme being, they are liberated from this Maya and become ONE with the Supreme being.

For example boy in spanish is " nino" and the accent goes on the "n" before the O ( ombre is also "boy')... Spanish is almost the same as french..so maybe when you pronounce them(and their kind of hard/difficult) you know that there's an accent in the word somewhere..Sorry but that's the only way i can explain it!! Hope this helps! By the way when you say "nino" you say it like " NEEN YO"..|`|3258fd9ca0baa8e13a1a5449e7bdca00aa	Rules of thumb which should help with pronunciation ...    1) If the word ends with a vowel, s, or z, the accent is on the second-to-last syllable.  (That means that for two-syllable words, the accent is on the first syllable.)    2) If the word ends in any other consonant sound, the accent is on the last syllable.    3) If the word is written with an accent that doesn't follow the pattern of  1 and  2 above, follow the written accent.    As far as writing is concerned, you don't need to use an accent mark on words that come under  1 and  2 above.  For the rest, you just have to get used to the exceptions and memorize them.  But the longer you work at it, the more you'll see even the exceptions falling into some patterns, and the easier it'll get.   Hope that helps!|`|ox45zrgCaa	here's a good tip...  most of the words ending in ON have an accent on the O when they are nouns. Example: Cancin (Song). Natacin (Swimming). Educacin (Education), Etc.   some other simple words with accents. Mam (mom), Pap (dad).  Maestra (Master - university).     hope that helps a little|`|FEGtnUEcaa	There are some rules about accents. You have to learn those rules by heart.  And the first thing you have to recognize is which is the stressed syllable in each word. Once you know the stressed sylable, you have to apply the rules of accentuation. Only stressed sylables have accents, but not all of them need it. Basically, rules say when a stressed syllable needs an accent.    1. Words stressed in the last syllable need accent when they end in a vowel or in consonat N or S.  2. Word stressed in the penultimate syllable only need accents when finishing in any consonant except N or S. If they finish in vowel or N,S, dont need accent.  3. Words with the stress in the antepenultimate syllable always need accent.  4. Words with only one syllable doesnt need accent, except in some cases, to differentiate meanings: Te (pronoun YOU), but "T" (tea); mi (adjective MY) but "m " (pronoun ME).    caER (stressed syllable ER doesnt need accent)  toMAR (stressed syllable MAR doesnt need accent)  caMIN (stressed syllable MIN does need accent)

Who knows why it's like that. Where I live, guys can't wear pink, and nobody can wear purple, or anything with rainbows without someone accusing you of being gay. Come on people, they're just colors!

Pink is bold, masculine, and daring. Blue is more weak, delicate and dainty.     People USED to be in their right frame of minds but then all of a sudden we got backwards. Like some people think the partner being the 'bottom' is the one in pain and the top only receives pleasure but actually the bottom receives MORE pleasure than the top. The bottom is also the one more in control.    So a lispy, queen in a pink shirt that's a bottom is actually innately more powerful than a straight top man with a blue backwards baseball cap.

That's why they say "It takes a real  man to wear pink". Cos most guys are too worried of what others will think of them. But I don't really get how people can see a guy wearing a pink shirt and go "Oh, they must be gay". I mean, it's like walking up to someone who's eating a banana, and going "Oh, they must be a dirty person."

The associate of pink with bold, dramatic red clearly affected its use for boys. An American newspaper in 1914 advised mothers, "If you like the color note on the little one's garments, use pink for the boy and blue for the girl, if you are a follower of convention." [The Sunday Sentinal, March 29, 1914.] A woman's magazine in 1918 informed mothers, "There has been a great diversity of opinion on the subject, but the generally accepted rule is pink for the boy and blue for the girl. The reason is that pink being a more decided and stronger color is more suitable for the boy, while blue, which is more delicate and dainty, is pertier for the girl." [Ladies Home Journal, June, 1918] This undoubteldy strikes modern readers as very surprising indeed. Some sources suggest it was not until the 1940s that the modern gender associations with color became universally accepted.     The color pink is now associated with womanhood and little girls, just like light blue is associated with little boys and manhood. However, in 1918 "Infant's Department" (an industry publication) said the reverse was the "generally accepted rule", describing pink as "more decided and stronger" while blue was "more delicate and dainty" . Pink continued to be used for both boys' and girls' clothing through the early 1960s, though it is becoming more and more associated with femininity. For example, Carrie from Sex and the City often wears pink dresses. Pink is also the signature color for Elle from the Legally Blonde movie series.  The color pink also has an association with female genitalia. Used as a slang term to refer to female genitalia.    Pink is also associated with gays, lesbians, and bisexuals, often in the form of a pink triangle. This symbolic usage stems from the symbols used by the Nazis to label their prisoners in the concentration camps . Where Jews were forced to wear the familiar yellow stars of David, and Roma people were forced to wear a black triangle; men imprisoned on accusations of homosexuality or same sex sexual activity were forced to wear a pink triangle. Nowadays, it is often worn with pride.    In 1993, artist Gioia Fonda created a conceptual piece in the form of a week long holiday called "pink week". The intention of pink week is to liberate the color pink from all dogma and simply celebrate the color pink as a color. Although the artist acknowledges that it is nearly impossible for most people in our culture not to associate certain meanings with certain colors, she hopes that we can let pink, and all colors for that matter, be just colors for one week a year.     Gender stereotyping starts even before a child is born. As  friends and family buy gifts for an upcoming birth, color  choices are often limited to pale green or yellow if the baby's  gender is to be a surprise. If the baby's sex is known, or after  the child is born, pale pinks and small flowers adorn newborn  girls' clothing, while light blue with trucks and sports  insignia adorn newborn boys' clothes.|`|AA11099954	because hwne you were yooung you were brought up in an environement were ususlly little girls and women only wear pinks but since it the new trend and generation some guys want to change the tradtion...so they are not gay! just having fun! with "PINK."     i find it very cute though haha|`|9601bf09a02282f2189d27bf5a9629e1aa	tough guys wear pink.  go you!|`|AA12202792	Cuz it's really a color associated with femininity.

Wait, not going to happen right? Yet, that happened with a witchcraft store in my city.

And their blood will actually be poured out like dust, and their bowels like the dung. 18 Neither their silver nor their gold will be able to deliver them in the day of Jehovahs fury; but by the fire of his zeal the whole earth will be devoured, because he will make an extermination, indeed a terrible one, of all the inhabitants of the earth.|`|85abd42dcefcdc439788bbbdcf4b292baa	Yes boy, there is a judgement comming, and what will you do?|`|7faa6c450d7756c69dcba5b22f24a4d2aa	I don't know where you got this quote, but I sure can't find in the Bible.

780f93d03f29a53782e40529515b8b01aa	The rapture makes no sense because it teaches there will be 2 final Judgments.  That in itself is illogical.      The Final Judgment is when God has deemed humanity worthy of resurrection.  We stand before God and account for our lives, and he gives us entrance to heaven or hell.  Then all of humanity will be resurrected, those in heaven and those in hell. Those in heaven will be given a body worthy of heavenbound.  Those in hell will get a body worthy of the hell bound.|`|95be5639aed6aa784e4750dbb0a7e356aa	Like a Thief in the Night -    The Rapture of God's Church        The word rapture (in Greek harpazo, in Latin rapere) means to be caught up or taken away suddenly.  The rapture refers to the sudden removal of all of God's people on the earth.  In the twinkling of an eye, born again Christians will suddenly be transformed out of our human bodies and will rise up into the air to join Jesus Christ.           Many Christians are afraid to talk about the rapture of the Church.  Deep down they feel an excitement about the prospect of being snatched away in the twinkling of an eye to be with the Lord and Savior they love, worship, and have given their lives to.  However, they fear being labeled or criticized for a hope that many through the ages have had; a hope that God fully intended for us to have.  God warned us against ignoring the hope that end-times prophecy gives us in I Thessalonians 5:19 when he said "Do not put out the Spirit's fire; do not treat prophecies with contempt.  Test everything.  Hold on to the good.  Avoid every kind of evil."          There is a reason Christ warned his end-times followers 13 times in the New Testament to not be deceived, and to watch and be ready.  He wanted us to be excited about His glorious appearing.          Satan, on the other hand, does not want us to be excited.  He is the master deceiver and wants us to believe his deception rather than the signs of Christ's return given to us by Jesus himself.  He will send many to deceive us and to rob us of the joy of living every day in anticipation of Christ's return.         For those who believe that the Bible is the truth and is the very word of God, it's easy to believe in and rejoice in the prophecies that tell of the rapture of God's Church.  The Bible tells us of others who have been taken up into heaven in very much the same way that we will be at the time of the rapture.  Elijah was taken up into heaven like a whirlwind.          II Kings 2:11-12 "As they were walking along and talking together, suddenly a chariot of fire and horses of fire appeared and separated the two of them, and Elijah went up to heaven in a whirlwind.  Elisha saw this and cried out, "My father!  My father!  The chariots and horsemen of Israel!  And Elisha saw him no more."          Enoch was also taken from this life so that he would not experience death.         Hebrews 11:5  "By faith Enoch was taken from this life, so that he did not experience death; he could not be found, because god had taken him away. for before he was taken, he was commended as one who pleased God.  and without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him."         So, when will the church be raptured?  We know there is more evidence today that He is coming for His Church soon, than at any other time in history.  As these signs intensify, all of us who know Christ as our savior will be looking toward heaven and awaiting the coming of our Lord.         Many biblical scholars feel that the rapture will occur prior to the Tribulation Period, or a pre-tribulation rapture.  Thus God will spare his Church from the persecutions of the Antichrist and the wrath of God that will fall upon the inhabitants of the Earth during the end times.  Those who come to Christ following the rapture will live through the persecution of Christians by the Antichrist and even martyrdom for their faith.  There are several other views of the timing for the rapture of the Church, however, here we will examine the pre-tribulation view and the biblical support for it.         One of the best supporting verses from the Bible for the rapture of the Church is found in Revelation 3:10.         "Because you have kept my command to persevere, I also will keep you from the hour of trial which shall come upon the whole world to test those who dwell on the earth."         This verse is a promise made by Christ to one of His seven churches, the church of Philadelphia.  The hour of trial Jesus speaks of in this verse is the period of time that our Lord calls the "great tribulation, such as has not been since the beginning of the world until this time, no, nor ever shall be" (Matthew 24:21).         There are many verses in the Bible that describe the rapture.  Christians in the first century church were so driven by the coming of their Lord and savior in the end-times that they shared their faith everywhere.  Paul wrote to the Thessalonian church in I Thessalonians 1:6-10         And you became followers of us and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Spirit, so that you became examples to all in Macedonia and Achaia who believe.  For from you the word of the Lord has sounded forth, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place.  Your faith toward God has gone out, so that we do not need to say anything.  For they themselves declare concerning us what manner of entry we had to you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and  true God, and to wait for His Son from heaven, whom He raised from the dead, even Jesus who delivers us from the wrath to come.         This belief in being taken up to meet Christ is the essence of hope.  A hope that Satan will fight and challenge with all of his might.         We also read the following in I Thessalonians 4:16-18          "For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet of God; and the dead in Christ will rise first.  Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up int he air, and thus we shall always be with the Lord.  Therefore encourage each other with these words."         The Lord will shout a loud command as he descends from heaven, and we will hear t|`|6e28f5d452b4e4dc99f9a7d6e4ed88f6aa	To answer your question, Yes.    FYI...    One of the most widely circulated attacks against the pre-trib rapture is the notion that a girl named Margaret MacDonald started this theological view back in 1830. The claim is typically made that MacDonald received a demonic vision, passed it on to John Darby, who in turn popularized it. Disproving this assertion proves rather easy. Pre-trib scholars have discovered a host of rapture writings that predate Margaret MacDonald.    Epharaem the Syrian said, in 373 AD, "For all the saints and Elect of God are gathered, prior to the tribulation that is to come, and are taken to the Lord lest they see the confusion that is to overwhelm the world because of our sins."    One post-trib author offered a reward to anyone who could find a quote that predated MacDonald. He had to quickly cough up the money when someone identified a scholar who wrote about the pre-trib rapture several years before MacDonald. As of late, dozens of examples have been found, and the literary surface has hardly been scratched.    With the revealing of all these pre-MacDonald writings, you would think that this argument has been debunked. Unfortunately, this is not the case. We seem to be involved in a tug-of-war with the truth. Apparently, due to their lack of research, pre-trib opponents continue to pump out publications that cite MacDonald as the originator of the pre-trib rapture.|`|58930cac908f85c4b97bee846e2f3c70aa	I met Harry Potter Last Week and he taught me a new spell.....|`|b64e671f371e45830375dbcf79e311b3aa	Rapture isn't a theory.

The general concept is that all the dead in Christ will arise all at the same time. This concept of resurrection as a group is common to all rapture theologies. There are two other theologies regarding the rapture, one is called midtribulationist and the other is posttribulationist both of these  believe that the rapture is not  immediately  going to happen any time now, both occur after events in the future.       Can you think about everybody calling out a different name in a large sports stadium??? When Lazarus was raised from the dead Jesus called him to  come forth. When Tabitha was raised by Paul  he commanded her to arise.How long would it take to call everyone by name?   It could be going on right now, but is not yet complete!

So the answer to your question would be yes.    --------------------------------------...  They came to life and reigned with Christ a thousand years. (The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended.) This is the first resurrection. Blessed and holy are those who have part in the first resurrection. The second death has no power over them, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with him for a thousand years.  ~Revelations 20:4a-6 (NIV)|`|AA12126989	Sounds that way, don't it?|`|AA12185376	The Christian dead, not all the dead.

The souls of those that have died before the "rapture" are already with God.  At the "rapture" the soul gets united with their glorified, perfected body and they are resurrected.  This happens to the dead in Christ first.  The dead in Christ is referring to the physical body, which will return to dust, not the soul.  The soul does not "sleep," it goes to be with God upon physical death.   It is the body that "sleeps" because it is dead.  At the "rapture" we will receive an uncorrupted body...so body and soul will be united.    That is my take on things anyway.|`|ff17e3c9f0be04bd0d9a562027ac9badaa	yes it does then it will be the ones who are still alive in Christ and it isn't  a theory|`|1787ba1acf3441c932d9b3869def3231aa	That is stupid dispensationalism again|`|2c99addf7e2263e7f09015bffa551a4eaa	the dead are already with christ.  After you die, you are not bound by space-time, because you are spirit, and your spirit goes with God.    revelations 6:9-11 states :When he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God and the testimony they had maintained. They called out in a loud voice, "How long, Sovereign Lord, holy and true, until you judge the inhabitants of the earth and avenge our blood?" Then each of them was given a white robe, and they were told to wait a little longer, until the number of their fellow servants and brothers who were to be killed as they had been was completed.   The rapture are for those that are still living on earth that will be snatched away the same time jesus comes back (not seven years before like taught be pre-tribulationists).|`|8408dc6d25926f2233876053b877c8b2aa	Yes... that is clearly stated is it not.... this is only those who accepted God and came to him before mortal death or , in the case of the living. befor The rapture... if you see The Rapture occuring it willbe too late to join in.

Resurrection, then the translation of the living believers in Christ.    However, please note that this Bible reference does not discuss the rapture with regard to a tribulation. The simplest view is that this all takes place on the last day of history, just as Jesus said in John 6. He said it four times there.    Please also note that according to 1 Corinthians 15:51ff. it will all happen in a split second, "in the twinkling of the eye..."

The company offered to pay a "clothing allowance".  Compliance was 100% effective, and nobody complained.  Assembly supervisors, mostly male, had to wear thick rubber gloves and were forbidden from touching ANY employees.  Sweat would build up inside the gloves and they became very uncomfortable.  The company did hear numerous complaints about that, but their hands were tied.  They couldn't find any suppliers that made silk or satin shorts for men.

95cdaa4ba159e2349140fc7a7cc0315caa	Der Begriff der "deutschen Leitkultur" in der politischen Diskussion  [Bearbeiten]Merz hatte die politische Variante des Leitkultur-Begriffes im Rahmen der Debatte ber die ?nderung des Einwanderungsrechts im Oktober 2000 formuliert, um damit notwendige Regeln fr Einwanderung und Integration als ?freiheitlich-demokratische deutsche Leitkultur zu begrnden. Er argumentiert damit gegen Multikulturalismus und Parallelgesellschaften. Friedrich Merz und wie auch Brandenburgs Innenminister J?rg Sch?nbohm forderten, Zuwanderer mssten die ?deutsche Leitkultur respektieren. Sie h?tten einen eigenen Integrationsbeitrag zu leisten, indem sie sich an die in Deutschland gewachsenen kulturellen Grundvorstellungen ann?herten. Merz verlangte des Weiteren eine Einwanderungsregelung mit dem Ziel, j?hrlich nur etwa 200.000 Ausl?nder aufzunehmen. Bei mehr wrde die ?Integrationsf?higkeit der einheimischen Bev?lkerung berfordert. ?Leitkultur wurde bis 2004 eine polemische Formel, die sich gegen die Bundesregierung, aber auch konkurrierend gegen die Neue Rechte wandte.    In Folge wurde an der Publizit?tsfront zwischen Opposition und Regierungskoalition Kritik vor allem seitens der Koalitionsparteien laut. Cem ?zdemir (Bndnis 90/Die Grnen) meinte dazu, in der Einwanderungspolitik msse es um die Integration, nicht aber um die Assimilation der Zuwanderer gehen. ?zdemir betonte, wer unter dem Begriff der "deutschen Leitkultur" den Versuch verstehe, Menschen zu assimilieren, sozusagen um jeden Preis ihre Anpassung an hiesige Lebensverh?ltnisse fordere, der verkenne die gesellschaftliche interkulturelle Realit?t in Deutschland.    Leitkultur wurde bei der Wahl fr das Wort des Jahres 2000 auf den 8. Platz gew?hlt ([1]), Deutsche Leitkultur im gleichen Jahr von der Pons-Redaktion zum Unwort des Jahres 2000.

CDU-Fraktionsvorsitzende Merz rechtzeitig zum ?Aufstand der Anst?ndigen klargestellt. Deutsche, so verkndet er, sind im Unterschied zum Rest der Welt n?mlich nach wie vor was ganz Besonderes: sie besitzen eine ?Leitkultur. Dieser Leitkultur haben sich die anderen, wenn sie schon hierherkommen, gef?lligst zu fgen:     Ausdrcklich warnte Knobloch davor, den Begriff der deutschen Leitkultur ?wieder hervorzuzaubern?,   weil der Eindruck entstehen k?nne, dass Menschen eine ?gewisse neue Kultur aufgezwungen werden? solle. ?Das sollte man tunlichst vermeiden?, wird Knobloch zitiert. Die oberste Repr?sentantin der gut 100.000 Menschen jdischen Glaubens in der Bundesrepublik pl?dierte dafr, bei dem Begriff Patriotismus zu bleiben und diesen weiter zu entwickeln.    "Deutsche Leitkultur". Nichts einfacher als das. Denkt sichs. Von wegen! Was ist das denn eigentlich, eine "Leitkultur"? Noch dazu eine "deutsche"? Wie immer gilt auch hier zur Schadensbegrenzung das alte Sprchwort: "Donner dir selbst, so hagelts dir nicht."    Das Thema insgesamt mit "Kartoffelsuppe" zu verkleistern, wie die Merkel Angela meinte, bringt uns der L?sung unseres Problems wohl kaum n?her.

Like Moses did for instance.This is not the case with Muhammed. He himself said he can't do any miracles. He did what the Christians did in the Crusades kill people in the name of God.    There are many verses in Quran that reaffirm this last Hadith, proving that Muhammad never performed any miracle and found it useless. In the following verse Muhammad is acknowledging that other prophets before him came with miracles or clear signs but still people rejected them, highlighting the futility of miracles as the proof of his revelation.     Q. 03: 138  They (also) said: "Allah took our promise not to believe in an messenger unless He showed us a sacrifice consumed by Fire (From heaven)." Say: "There came to you messengers before me, with clear Signs and even with what ye ask for: why then did ye slay them, if ye speak the truth?"  if you are truthful?        All along, the unbelievers asked Muhammad to perform a miracle so that they could believe.       Q. 17: 90  They say: "We shall not believe in thee, until thou cause a spring to gush forth for us from the earth,     And he would reply:    Q. 17: 93  Say: "Glory to my Lord!

Por otro lado cabe preguntarse qu es tener "cultura religiosa", porque si por ello entiendes el conocimiento de todos los ritos, dogmas y normas de la Iglesia Catlica, te dir que para m carecen de importancia, como los de todas las Iglesias.  Si por "cultura religiosa" entiendes el conocimiento de los textos de la Biblia, entonces basta que la leas t, que no te dejes llevar por las interpretaciones de los dems y que extraigas tus propias interpretaciones.

No todo es malo, empero, sino que el crecimiento social postmoderno ha posibilitado en muchas ocasiones la autocrtica -cosa que en otros lugares no est permitido-.

Much of the world's best and most complete scholarship attests to that very fact, along with most of human history. This sacred deposit of faith teaches us how to become pleasing and acceptable to God, and helps us understand how to overcome our sinful human nature.

(buddhism and hinduism)|`|AA10507092	thank God I'm happy with it...You know when you're born with a religion you get used to it...and from time to time you start to like it more and more... and that makes you feel happy!..It makes me  patient... feel comfortable not annoyed...protected by something... there are many lessons that it teaches us that we even don't realize that we got it from our religion!

But go ahead and do it. There are churches more in tune with you. Find one and go. Friends in your former church may ask, do not be derogatory about the old church. Just explain you are looking for something more attuned to YOU.|`|GbDAfs5Yaa	It's great that they have done so much, but it sounds like they're not doing the most important thing and that's preach the Word of God and sing praises to Him.  God doesn't frown on Praise and Worship music, as a matter of fact He loves it.  Why would God not recognize things related to the New Testament, it's all about His Son...birth, death, resurrection, ministry...you know I don't have to tell ya.  I think you should let the head know of your decision and find a church that fills you with the Word of God and sings praises to the Lord of Lords.|`|QmIK2vgqaa	Use the door and go find satan.|`|2N6oTOLQaa	Well, one option is to just stop showing up.

And don't come back.|`|kyTBaYFlaa	you are afraid to offend them? that is bs. you owe them nothing. you have been an active member and done many things for this church. if you don't agree with their beliefs go somewhere else. it is the job of the church to serve your beliefs and fill your spiritual needs. it is not your job to conform to theirs. if they are not meeting your needs....GO. Some may ask why. Be honest and tell them. Some may agree with you but they are afraid to speak out. You should not belong to any group where you do not feel comfortable and you should never allow yourself to compromise your beliefs due to peer pressure.|`|bT3mzootaa	You are  the temple of the HOLY SPIRIT, remember that the WORD says that where the spirit is there is liberty.You are a vessel for the honor and glory of the LORD.By what you have said you truly are being led by the spirit.The WORD OF GOD calls you to be stead fast in what you have been called to, and that is an ambassador for GODS WILL.Let these words remind you of the authority you have in CHRIST JESUS.You are not merely a spectator, and GOD is moving you to allow all HIS WORD to direct your paths.Beware not to follow man, as much as you love them you must remember that the WORD OF GOD says not to put your eyes on man.It strictly warns us of that saying cursed is the person who puts their trust in man and not GOD.This is one of those situations.Wherever you go make sure the HOLY SPIRIT is leading that church,and where the spirit is again there is Liberty the WORD says.Don't allow this to be such a burden to decide I know you have gotten attached to them,but THE LORD is calling you to follow HIM wholly,not partially.The WORD OF GOD says that"ALL" of the bible is inspired by the HOLY SPIRIT,remember that.It sounds like you have a great calling sis,I'll be praying that THE LORD direct your paths.GOD BLESS!!|`|ttGk4VOxaa	Don't let the doors hit you on the way out|`|789648a8b3c9e5c8bfae95900bfc85b3aa	boldly out the front door.  The new testament, if you believe, is the story that should be focused on.  While there are many that say the old is there as well so you understand the underpinnings of the new, I don't agree.  Jesus said he was come to fulfill the old law.  Jesus describes a god that can't be the same one that is in the old testament.  It sounds like your church has become the domain of a set of leaders that like things the way they are...and are no longer really interested in what the "word" has to tell you.  Leave with a full heart, and just go.  It is a religion...you can leave as you wish.  You owe them no explaination, really.  It is apparent, though, that your faith has outgrown them. Good luck to you.|`|A8kFFduNaa	Just say: "look! a hooker! i gotta run!"|`|AA11903455	Leave, just use the door and don't look back.|`|AAgX0SDcaa	What does your church thing the Psalms were? they were songs, not just musical instruments.|`|HrSnooIGaa	you tell whoever you know that you are not going to be able to come for some time because of w/e and never go back.    if they dont have any way of contacting you then just never go back|`|85vDqn6naa	Sounds like a cult masquerading as a religious organization, run fast, it is God knocking on your heart telling you to.|`|8nvesSFFaa	Just say I believe some of the things you are teaching are wrong.

Though it really is as simple as telling them that you're no longer interested. If they truely are moral, caring people, they'll understand and won't get in your way if you wish to persue other things.|`|Q5jJ05Qqaa	You should first start looking for another church, and let the leadership at your current church know that.  When you find that new church, you should either have the old church send a letter of transfer to the new church, or just let the old church's leadership know that you are now attending that new church.  They should understand.|`|AA11634944	"I feel that they try to tell you what to do and how to do it instead of give the word and allow it to help you in life."    Most religions will do that. It's ok that your open minded, there is nothing wrong with being intelligent and using it to question the things that surround you. However, with this mentality the chances of finding a church that accept your ideas is rare. Your best shot of staying close to your god and worshiping him is doing it in the solitude of your home, where you will not be judged or frowned down upon.    In leaving it is probably best to explain your reasons, then cut your ties. Leaving on bad note is never a good idea, and starting a fight won't help anything. I hope all goes well.|`|PWankIUpaa	I think you have has the teaching from this church that God sent you there for and that it is simply time for you to go on to another church!     Pray about this and ask for God's guidance and just do not go back!    I would tell them that you have decided that you are going to do some investigating on your own and then do that !     Do a lot of Praying and research the Mission statements of the churches that you are investigating before you attend and then once you have made a decision based on God 's leading then go and stay put until God leads you else where.|`|6s6wGCzxaa	You should pray on it before anything.  Ask God to guide you if He speaks for you to move He will also show you where.  Also if the Lord is leading you than you can go with their blessing letting them know the Lord led you to another ministry.      I hope they are not operating under a spirit of control. You'll know if when you try to leave they tell you your not of God... God wouldn't want you in a ministry that is manipulating and controlling its congration, and it shouldn't be a one man show.  There is a head of the ministry but it is a body of Christ.|`|elSUVcaZaa	however carefully we tread, the unreasonable will always find offence in our actions or words. instead, we have to try to be true to our own judgement and to make sure that we do what we truly feel is right, independently of other opinions. After all, only our heart can truly tell us what god feels for our actions. Go with your heart and you will do right By god.|`|JvsFHyw4aa	Sounds very manipulative. You should just get up and go. People like that give me the creeps.|`|AUsvrW8faa	You owe it to youself to work out your own salvation by being in a bible teaching church where you can feed your soul, work in your spiritual gift and develop and nurture your relationship with Christ.  Find another church in the area and start attending while you're praying for God to lead you to your new church home.  Whatever you do- DON'T stop going to church altogether- just get out of that one if you're not being fed spiritually.  Pray pray pray for God to lead you to a church home where you will be fed.  He knows what YOU need.    I don't think I'd make it in a church that only sang hymns either.  I'm in the choir and on the praise team. We have electric guitars, drums, pianos, organs, keyboards, saxaphones, bongos ...the whole nine.  The words says to make a joyful noise unto the Lord!    Don't worry about being offensive - taking your walk seriously enough to know you need more should make them proud. The Lord gave us a whole new covenant that is in the new testament........I'm not sure whey they're not teaching about it. Either way, if you leave their church, just make sure you're in somebody's church on Sunday while you're waiting for the Lord to show you your new church home.    Be encouraged    Be blessed.      http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyheJ480L...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6yhgFxDQ...|`|ViHe4VhWaa	^ Pretty spot on if you ask me.|`|MZ9UaIYEaa	Sister, please check out the source below.

Thats messed up..  as long as you are praising the Lord it is exceptable to him. You are not being too open minded. they are just closed minded.   I think that you should pray about leaving the church and if its what God wants you to do. Then he will give you a way out.|`|pko0O3rMaa	No,no,no do NOT write a letter. That will only make things more painful. Just leave and don't tell them why or else they will get very offended.|`|3PKC2yWXaa	If you feel as if you have to leave, then you owe it to yourself to do so. Tell them why you are leaving and go about it in a friendly way, but even if their response isn't what you hoped it would be, you have to face the consequences and do what you know you should do.|`|8RtWoVWiaa	okay. thats a hard one. i would say that that church, if they even believe in a higher being would be glad to accept the fact that you are no longer interested in being in that church. but since you made them sound bad they are probably trying to manipulate you through god. since when is an instrament "blasphemy" okay these people are weird. religion is about you becoming a better person. if your peers feel that they are greater than you and need to make rules, then they are in fact not religious. they just use it as an excuse. follow your heart, thats more with god than some crazy God "fanatics"|`|RZKygoPzaa	Follow your inner feelings on this matter.  Something is telling you all these rules have nothing to do with religion or God for that matter.  God created many things.  To name a few, God created the earth, the wind, the sun, the seas, and human beings.  So too, God has gifted humans with the ability to compose songs and sing and dance.  Neither singing nor dancing are sins with most organized religions.    If your church is saying that they are, then they are not in step with todays world, and frankly, it sounds too controling to me, not good for you at all.  Not in terms of your emotional growth as human being or a spiritual growth either.  It just doesn't sound Christain what they are promoting.  It doesn't sound human either. You were put on the beautiful earth to enjoy God's gifts and blessing.  Singing His praises is one of them if you choose to do so.  Never let anyone tell you that you are sinful when you know you are not doing anything like that.  Sounds like gestapo tactics to me, or mind control.  I bet you are not allowed to question anything in this organization either, are you?    Be careful of religious sects that want to conrol you, again, that concept has NOTHING to do with God.      There are other Churches out there that are not so strict and sing God's Glory at all their services..  You know what is right for you and I believe you know what to do about this. Just do it.|`|AA11183936	Get lots of C4 and blow.it.up. girl!|`|g7bQ9zSvaa	I think you should pray about it and follow God's leading, and you can pray together with people from your church - you don't need to bury them in criticism and offend them to do this.  That way when you do leave, you will know that it's God's will and you can tell them that.  Even when people are totally loving their church, God may call them to go elsewhere.  Hopefully, they will support you, pray with you and continue to be your friends, if God leads you to a different church.  They'll know that we all need to grow and sometimes God just puts it on our hearts that it's time to move on. It doesn't mean we don't love the people in our church.

EWaGs6nJaa	Please note "letzt" is not a word on its own. If you use it as an adjective with definite article der/die/das it would be    der letzte ... (masculine)  die letzte...

(neuter)    It changes if you use the indefinite article einer/eine/ein    ein letzter...(masculine)  eine letzte...(feminine)  ein letztes...(neuter)    Apart from that the word can also be used as a noun.

jHwWMwDRaa	What we have lost in this country (if we ever had it) is a sense of tolerance.  It's one of the basic underlying principles of the Declaration of Independence, and the Constitution (including the Bill of Rights).  The whole idea is to let everyone alone as long as they aren't hurting other people or the state.    It's this concept that makes America work, but all I see are fundamentalist religious right organizations trying to remove or prevent people from getting and exercising their civil rights.  Imposing their religious values on those who don't believe the same as they do.    As in the gov't should not establish an official church, but in effect that's what the religious right is asking for, to enshrine their religion's values as the law of the land.  That sounds like the beginnings of the establishment of an official church.    It's truly a sad day for America when we oppress our own citizens based upon religion.|`|U4V6TkZEaa	If you really want an answer, this article examines both sides of the issue from an economic (non-religious) point of view:|`|cLgghhuXaa	I have the right to vote as an American...(as do you assuming you are 18, registered, and not a felon.)

It's as simple as that. You are in favor of gay marriage? VOTE! And perhaps, since we live in a democracy, the majority will agree with YOU.|`|DRSv6SOLaa	You are pushing and shoving YOUR beliefs on us!!

Romans 1:18-32.  |`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	Honestly, I don't personally know any Christians who are uptight about it.  We merely believe homosexuality is a sin, as the bible says.  If you think the bible is outdated, well that's up to you.  I don't.  Sorry you're so offended by what it says.|`|AA11849917	Why do you assume that we are uptight just because we disagree?  I could ask the same thing, why are homosexuals so uptight with Christians?  Homosexuals disagree with Christians and the Bible, so from your statement, I can also conclude that homosexuals are uptight with Christians.    I saw a movie once (bear with me for a moment, please) in which a fire fighter was sitting in his fire truck at the curb of an apartment building that was on fire, with people inside crying for help.  What was he doing?  Playing one of those little Nintendo type of games.  In the movie, many people died, because someone told him to mind his own stinkin' business, and let other people live the way they want without interfering!    He was not uptight about people being in burning buildings, and he didn't hate them for being in those burning buildings, nor did he even fear them for being there.  It was his job to rescue those people from the burning buildings.  His job wasn't to put out fires, or teach fire safety, or convince anybody that fires are dangerous when you create one in the middle of your living room carpet.  His job was strictly that of rescuing people from burning buildings.  Those burning people didn't even effect his life!    What would YOU think if you were walking by, and you saw that situation that I just described?  Would you callously say, "Well, that's his own personal business if he wants to rescue those people or not." ?  Or would you get angry at that fire fighter like any sane and rational person?    Then why are you angry with us Christians?  Sin sends people to hell - no - I take that back - sin DRAGS people into hell, kicking and screaming!  Jesus can set us free from our sins along with their eternal consequences.    I realize that you just simply do not WANT to be rescued from the burning building referred to as "your life", but what WOULD you have us do?  If YOU were in my shoes, and you saw "behind the scenes" so to speak (spiritually speaking), and YOU saw people whose souls were in the process of being dragged into hell, would YOU just sit back?  Could YOU just sit and listen to all those souls screaming out in agony, and not lift a single finger?  If you CAN do that, then you're a bigger monster than I could ever imagine!   Likewise, if you insist that we Christians take that very SAME attitude, then you're an even BIGGER monster!    Sorry, but even though YOU can't see the "fire" (spiritually speaking), I can.  And, as the song says, "I once was lost but now I'm found, was blind but now I see."  So, you honestly can't expect me to just sit back and "mind my own business" while souls are screaming in agony!    I realize you won't agree with this answer, but Truth and reality never asked for YOUR agreement.  This IS the Truth, and it IS the answer, whether you like it or not.  I just pray that you will wake up before you are completely destroyed, before it's too late!|`|E9chZY74aa	God defined marriage.  We can not condone the redefinition of it now.

Get a life.  Move to Sudan for a week.  Come back and tell me all about being oppressed because you can't get married.    How pathetic.    Here, let me change a few words...    Why are some Gays so uptight about gay marriage? How do gays not getting married effect their life?    Even if it does go against their beliefs, why must they push their beliefs on everyone else? Why can't they leave people the hell alone? Because they can't tell the difference between "I want this" and "I have a right" doesn't mean the rest of the planet has to reverse on it's axis!      Hmmm... that's interesting.  Some similarities there.  But I'm sure you won't agree.    After all, it's more important that we get what we want, right?    Don't invoke the Bible on what is making a group of homosexuals basically throw a fit.  They claimed they want the rights that come with marriage, but when offered that it wasn't good enough.  No, they want marriage.    Tell me, please.  What will they want after they get marriage?  What new demand will there be that the rest of the nation - the other 85-95% of Americans - will have to bow down to?    Just answer me that much.

Even if it is wrong, they will be the ones that have to answer for it.  Why everyone is against this I really do not understand.  How is this going to have any effect on "normal" marriage.  It is not like the gay guys were gonna go and marry any women.  No one is makeing anyone marry the same sex so why can't they do it if they want to?  This no one has explained, what is the harm?|`|xWi4ua0Iaa	I could take their account about "marriage is a sacred institution" and "we're just following scripture" if they ever lived up to it - but the rejection of Jesus's admonition about re-marriage after divorce sort of makes everything they have to say about marriage suspect.  After all, Jesus never said a word about homosexuality, but he did tell them that if they get divorced they are not to re-marry (Luke 16:18).  So when I see Christian churches banning re-married people from their doors (who are a significant part of their current congregations), then, and only then, I'll think they have some deep seated need to "follow scripture"...until then, they are just finding a minority to hate and using "scripture" as a shallow justification for their bigotry...    Christians always like to say atheists don't understand the Bible...contradictory and arbitrary methods of applying it are teaching atheists plenty...and slapping a thumbs down doesn't make your hypocrisy go away...|`|xPeIvywdaa	we dont allow criminals to continue stealing do we?    it is scientifically proven that any children gays raise are more inclined to be gay    being gay is simply wrong and a peversion of true sexuality|`|Y7ZSaTOtaa	I dont push my beliefs on anyone as a born-again Christian.  I even have gay friends but I do not condone gay marriage because of my beliefs--look I am not a gay basher at all!!!! I think they should have rights to an extent but at the same time the bible states this as wrong ok? I didnt make that rule, the Creator did, he says it stinks in his nostrils the bible says that.  Its not like I personally make sure gay marriage isnt not made legal!!!    I do not go out of my way to make sure the law doesnt allow these rights because honestly it does not affect me one way or the other.|`|s40sgQ45aa	You ask the question and want our answers yet accuse us of pushing our beliefs on you... why is that?|`|QvF8dR7Taa	it diminishes the moral and respect that's suppose to be attached to the marriage concept.as it has been known for ages in almost every country on the planet,also its going against the natural order of things.if nature and god wanted men to have baby's then the gays could give birth anally,also women would have sperm saliva to do the same thing|`|35f5dd54fd31da18d4412a18f08b5e59aa	I think that it is not just sin, it is like a slap in God's face.  The Bible calls it an abomination, it tells Christians that if we approve of it , we become part of the sin.  Read Romans chapter 1.  But I think all sin is sin.  Why do you insist on pushing your belief on Christians.  Gays are oppressed because of their sin.  Just as are all sinners.  The Bible is a love letter from God.  Would you call a love letter out dated?  When a teacher can teach a child in grade school about sex,it becomes my business.  I promise not to judge you as long as you keep it in your own bedroom.  And stop asking for special treatment because you THINK you are special.|`|b85499a57edbf5a1f37bce5ce90c8557aa	Over the years I have met many Christians and heard many different takes on specifically how they regard the faith.  Many for example believe that hell is metaphor, or that it doesn't exist at all, or some literally believe there is a lake of fire where unrepented souls burn for all eternity.  Some eat meat on Fridays others do not.   A few have this huge list of "sins" while others only look to the ten commandments.. While even others don't believe in sin at all and that the only requirement for access to heaven is believing in Christ and asking for forgiveness...    But the bottom line, they pick and choose what passages to believe or support based on their upbringing and culture.     Very few people still burn bulls to please the lord.  Just as few would be willing to stone a family member to death for being a non-believer.    This whole homosexuality being a sin concept just happens to be a very popular one because they grew up all ready thinking that gay is bad and something to be ashamed of and ridiculed. It's the lesson we all learned on the school playground that being a homo was a terrible insult..     So you take those childhood lessons then as an adult revitalize the prejudice for political reasons. Homosexuals are a soft target for people who must step on others to elevate themselves. Evangelists spreading fear and distrust creating a crisis situation where they are relevant and needed is an age old technique.    Keep in mind it's only indirectly because of the bible.  Prejudices come from ignorance and misinformation.  That single passage in Leviticus is just convenient to a cause created by prejudice. Christians ignore almost all of Deuteronomy (as it is mostly medevil and violent) yet conveniently respect Leviticus.    In my opinion homosexual christians should start their own religion just like the protestants did. They can use the New Testament in full as it teaches tolerance and love without any of the jealous god stuff from the old testament. Bring a message of acceptance for all and see how many disenchanted christians jump on board. Then what will the government do? Deny them their right to worship? That would be interesting..    Gay marraige will eventually come to pass.  That is simply progress and social evolution.  But in the meantime, as always, the conservative majority will resist change.. It is a universal truth.|`|FhHklqkhaa	it's not a sin or an abomination  "homosexual" was a term coined in 1869 so it can't be a sin  the comparisons to putting your hand in fire or people in danger is wrong and false, it's a sexual orientation not a danger like they falsely claim,   many christian bigots are trying to make it seem like it's dangerous which is another lie  many are trying to make it seem like gays aren't oppressed which is another lie, lesbians, gays and bi-sexuals don't have the same rights as heteros! an example is marriage etc  edit: God didn't define marriage  it used to be open to same-sex couples before Constantius and Constans redefined marriage in 342 AD  that was after the bible's meant to have been wrote|`|4qXfQQ6Caa	the "out dated book called the bible"  is studied by the smartest people who have ever lived.. sorry its not the latest "fad".    and the reason most christians are against gay marriage,  is because it basically re-states marriage from being a sacred ordinance between a man and a woman..  to just legal forms.  i don't want my children growing up in a twisted society.|`|W11nQzVPaa	To begin with it doesn't;t effect their lives at all. Not in any way. Were that so there would be anarchy in the countries that already legally allow it. There things a perfectly fine. Amazingly the world has not collapsed everywhere it is legal. Now how can that be? Simple! It is right to allow it.   They  must push their beliefs in order to justify their existence. In other words they must keep shouting the same mindless dogma so that they themselves can believe it. And so gays as well as us who are transsexuals are targets of their collective fears and so shout at them regardless if it makes sense. It doesn't;t make any sense but that is their way. Hate!  Sharon|`|1a10b6b1127b07e424d93d828a3444d8aa	You have to understand that most people are just to dumb to live in this day and age...Christians included  They are told US is based on bible and boom it becomes pure fact..they did not check out that statement but it is now a holy write given by Gabriel to Peter  They are told bible is pure word of God so bam it is even though it was written by men, which every source admits, and most of these "faithful" have no idea what bible says...most don't even know bible says Jesus had like 6 brothers and 2 sisters but it is in there.    Finally Christians, just like other faiths, is made up of a majority that do not actually have any true faith...so to cover up that fact they scream from roofs and slaughter innocents all in God's name...as if God is unaware they "protest too much".      Look at no1home2day's answer....he/she compares a real world fire to the "sin" of homosexuality as if they were the same thing.  One is a real life natural event that will LITERALLY kill people and cause death and destruction in this physical world.....the other is a so called sin which they THINK will kill the soul...kinda like how they USED TO think masturbation would damn you to hell along with eating meat on Friday...they wanted to save people from their thoughts and their imagination has the same validity as reality to them.    That is called a psychotic delusion.  It is also arrogance even greater than that of Lucifer since they have made up this belief all on their own with no words from God or Jesus coming close.....if it was such a sin you would think one of them would have said something but they did not   *btw b4 you say soddom+gommorah please actually read the bible..the crowd wanted to rape angels and Lot offered his daughters to the mob..if they were gay then wtf would that have done..use your brain it was not a city of gays and the term that came from it sodomy actually meant any sex except missionary style vaginal intercourse..so doggie style was sodomy*    It all comes down to them trying to obtain the power to torture people with whips, chains and red hot pokers to obey their whims.  They hate+fear democracy and freedom and wish to live in a world ruled by a Theocracy where we are all slaves that are forbidden to think.    Because when you get down to it...they hate+despise God.  They worship the Devil and ignorance and spit on the gifts God gave of a reasonable mind capabale of growing and learning and becoming more than we started out being.  They wish to lay down in the filth and mud for the rest of eternity and do not want anyone else getting up out of the pits and living in the light as adult, free willed humans|`|pM6hgAr1aa	It is because they think that marrige gives rights that you dont usually get They are jealous!!!|`|rZVJi0u1aa	To be honest I'm not that bothered about it, they are only hurting themselves, this is a fallen world so abominations such as this will happen, particularly in these times.|`|cSQgIRAVaa	Really! if you were in front of me I would've hit you so hard that you'll remember your mothers milk.Just because your lust have ovecome your beliefs it doesn't means that everyone else have to accept it.The disgusting gay and lesbian thing is unacceptable in everyway moral  and social.Bare the consequences in life after death and in hell.|`|GZv6ft8gaa	There are many things wrong with homosexuality, but mainly this: It is an abomination to God. If God had thought homosexuality was okay, then he would have created another man...or just two women. But He didn't, so that's the beginning.    When God gave the Law to Moses, He was very clear about the fact that if two (of the same sex) lie together, or "know" each other as man knows a woman, then those two were to be put to death, because "it is an abomination to God." God also destroyed the cities of the plains (Sodom and Gomorrah and a couple of others) because of their proclivity to homosexual behavior.    God spoke through the Apostle Paul to re-affirm that those who practice homosexuality "shall not enter the Kingdom of Heaven." Many argue that times have changed and we need to become modernized in our thinking. But the fact is that God is the rock. He is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Therefore, we can easily conclude that He has not changed His mind. Homosexuality is still an abomination to Him.    Now this does NOT mean that God doesn't love homosexuals. He does, and He wants them to REPENT (turn away) from that which is NOT pleasing in His sight. Can homosexuals be saved? Yes, emphatically yes....IF they will repent (turn away) from that which is wrong. It isn't the sinner that is hated; it is what he or she does (the sin). Is there such a thing as a Christian homosexual? No. You can either be a Christian, or you can be a homosexual.|`|5sIg3ggmaa	For me the bible is no more then pieces of paper glued together.  I don't give a damn about it... I just live as the way God want me to live.  God isn't found on papers nor in stone.  God is found in each one of us.  We have the Power to change,.... we have the will to move froward,.... to help others,,,..... to be in the image of god.  The church is no more then a building.

Sex should not happen outside of marriage. Sex within marriage should be open to the transmission of life. Period.    I don't think it's about population control so much as sex is supposed to be about making babies, not making pleasure.|`|1yNGdGefaa	Because the church believes that sex should only occur when the person is married and ready for a child.  Yes, this is hard for many modern people to follow in modern times, that doesn't mean the rules for getting into heaven get easier, just because people have less self control.  The pope's job is to guide people into heaven, not change the rules to make things easy.  Contraceptions were forbidden in all Christian churches until last century.    It can be especially hard for non-religious people, who generally have less self-control (see article) to understand.|`|LJ6vHfgoaa	>>Is he selfishly increasing the population of catholics at all costs.

QZMvGnzpaa	Many people are atheists because it's "easier", but in my belief, having a religion (especially Christianity) is a very fulfilling life choice. For one, it opens up a whole new community to meet people, make friends, etc.  and for two, quite honestly, life is easier when you know something comes at the end of it. Also, if you look this up, you'll find out that most atheists who have been challenged to research Christian proof, or Easter proof, or any other miracle based Christian belief, have come out as strong believers. This is because there is WAY too much proof towards God and Jesus Christ. Look it up.

There are some interesting books on the subjects if you're interested in that.     God didn't preach differently to the human races, they simply approach God from different perspectives. God exists as God has always existed.    My religion, Hinduism, teaches that all religions are valid paths to God and that despite the apparent differences, really each religion is just approach the infinite God from a different perspective (because we exist in finite bodies with finite minds so it is difficult for the finite to understand the infinite).    Hindus say that the entire universe is the outpouring of God. That God, who is beyond form, created all form from Itself and that everything in the universe thus has a divine spark in it (thus everything is to be treated with the same respect that one treats with God). And with the traditional Hindu tolerance of other religions (since Hindus believe that other religions are merely different perspectives on the same God) they don't fight over religion.    Even the "fundamentalist" Hindus (as they have been called in western media) are not fighting over religion. They do claim to be "Hindus" in that that is the religion that they practice in India (which seems to be where the media says these people are), but the fight is over cultural issues (sound familiar to anything here in the US??) The "fundamenalist" Hindus and Muslims and Buddhists, etc, in India are often united by a desire to preserve Indian culture and to try to keep some of the bad "western" influences from developing in modern India. And like most "fundamentalists" in other nations, they are the minority amongst the larger population of devotees of whatever religion you happen to be talking about.

AA11550238	There are many Bharatas in history, of which Bharata the brother of Lord Rama, Bharata the son of King Rsabha, and Bharata the son of Maharaja Dusyanta are very famous. And all these Bharatas are historically known to the universe.   According to Bhagavat Purana, formally the whole earth was one kingdom and this earth planet is known as Bharata, or Bharata-varsa.  This name was due to King Bharata the son of Rsabha, or according to some due to the reign of the son of Dusyanta.   So far as Vaishnava Acharyas are convinced, this lands name Bharata-varsa was established from the reign of Bharata the son of King Rsabha. Before him the land was known as Ilavati-varsa, but just after the coronation of Bharata, the son of Rsabha, this land became famous as Bharata-varsa.  But despite all this, Bharata, the son of Dusyanta was not less important. He is the son of the famous beauty Shakuntala. King Dusyanta fell in love with Shakuntal? in the forest, and Bharata was conceived. After that, King forgot his wife Shakuntala by the curse of Kanva Muni, and the child Bharata was brought up in the forest by his mother. A full description of Maharaja Bharata is given in the Mahabharata, Adi-parva. The Pandavas, or the Kurus, are sometimes addressed as Bharata due to being born in the dynasty of the famous Maharaja Bharata, the son of King Dusyanta.  Mahabharat means History of Greater Bharat.   (from Srimad Bhagavatam 1.12.20 Purport )|`|cf4fdc395d1873b0ec16418c302d8d6faa	Bharat,the son of Suryavansi king Dushynta.he was  great from his childhood.

6dad5aa85787d81cd6924831435f4594aa	First of all you should understand the way the marriage contract is observed in Islam. In Islam Marriage is called Nikaah. The wedding couple and elders may decide that even after Nikah, the wife could live with her parents, until at a later date she moves into her husband's home. This event is called Departure (or Rukhsati in Urdu/Persian/Hindi, i am not certain if the same word is used in Arabic as well).    The Contract of Marriage Between The Holy Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him) and Hazrat Aisha(Allah be happy with her) did take place when she was 6 years old however, departure took place when she turned about ten years old.     One question arises that why The holy prophet Muhammad chose her? There are many explanations but 1 i want to bring forward is that, from the very early age Aisha (Allah be happy with her) had excellent memory. Thats why she has been credited with Narration of 2210 traditions of The Holy Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon Him). The most pious and educated Sahabaz (Companions or Apostles of the prophet) regarded her opinion to be final verdict on any matter after the death of The Holy Prophet (peace be uopn Him).|`|AA12171458	no|`|d0195ad52a3e14368513816b071fc31caa	boo !

Mephebosheth was Jonathan's son, Saul's grandson.  he was the only surviving relative of the Saul lineage and heir to Saul's throne.  David's men fought with Saul's men and when Saul heard of the defeat, he killed himself.  It was customary in those days to kill all heirs of the throne.  Upon hearing of the death of Jonathan and Saul, Mephebosheth's nurse took him in haste to hide him.  In her haste, she dropped Mephebosheth and he bacame crippled in both legs from the age of 5.  He was hiding in a place called Lodebar, that is a Place of No Bread.  David is looking for someone to BLESS in the house of Saul, for Jonathan's sake.  He finds Mephebosheth and summons him.  Obviously, Mephebosheth is scared and believes that he is going to be killed.  But instead, David shows him the kindness of God, not for Mephebosheth's sake, but for his father's sake and for God's name's sake.  Mephebosheth is ushered to the King's table  and sits a the table with the King all the days of his life, with his crippled feet hidden under the tablecloth of grace.    God was searching for us before we knew that He was searching.  When He came to us, we were scared, we knew we deserved to die.  We ask God, "What is thy servant, that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am?    But God doesnt even respond to that question.  Instead, he forgives us and restores us and we too sit with the King at the Table of Grace.|`|04f94cef83008fc05948b83dd0467468aa	"Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial for his is the crown of life that He gives to those that love him."

See in genesis 1:27 it says God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. Now if you understand the language created means to bring into being and being is existence so if God created man he came from the word of God. Now in genesis 2:7 it says and the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground. Now the word formed means to mold into shape he molded man from something that he had already created which was the dust of the ground (earth genesis1:1).  OK if he created male and female and put them into this body which was formed from the earth then the male and female spirit shared the first body and then he laid Adam down and took the woman out of him it had to be in spirit form and made a mold(body for the spirit to dwell in) and brought her to Adam and then Adam said there for shall a man leave his father and mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh.

You seen the sacrifice yet thought you could avoid it by going to a safe place, but the conviction followed you. But instead of repenting you went further away.

Obviously, it is clear as day that you are not doing something you know you need to be doing, especially for God.    It sounds like its something that you dont want to do or pay attention to, because you turned and left him.  The hall seems to be a place of decision-making.  The hall obviously has access to other rooms, because you went to one of them, leaving him in the hall.  You wanted to go into a room that he was not in.    The forest, and the crucifixions sound like martyrs.  People that were crucified were usually either common criminals, or people that were made examples of.  It was done for humiliation.  Seems that these people were murdered by antichristians for their beliefs.    Were you called to evangelize?    Sounds like you are not really listening to God and he's attempting to communicate to you.  I would suggest that you do not turn your back on him and go to another room.|`|60fbc59cd9cb3a6b4c2ea1875eb1b0afaa	a dream is just a dream.

AA12203324	Jesus is complaining that the Pharisees and teachers are distorting the meaning of their religion.  This "adultery" does not refer to sex but to "adulteration", to contamination and unfaithfulness to the true Jewish faith.  They are twisting the meanings of the scriptures to promote their own evil ideas.    Looking at the context, Jesus had just cured a blind, deaf man by casting out a demon.  The Pharisees explained that Jesus had done it with with the permission of the prince of demons.  They then demanded their own personal miracle from Jesus as a test.  Jesus was angry and accused them of discrediting any sign from God that they couldn't control.  He then brought up examples of miracles from the past, Jonah converting the hated Ninevites, the heathen queen of the South coming to learn wisdom from Solomon, to show that the Pharisees were blind to real signs of God's presence.    By calling them a "generation", Jesus was saying they were controlling the attitudes of an entire generation, setting themselves up as the authority to interpret scripture and religion in their own, twisted, Godless way.|`|AA11610394	yes youve said it and its obvious|`|2c99addf7e2263e7f09015bffa551a4eaa	It has a duel meaning.

5b761b8d18486a083fcaf2c7fa0c309daa	Sunni  The Sunni are the largest group in Islam. In Arabic, as-Sunnah literally means "principle" or "path." Sunnis and Shi'a believe that Muhammad is a perfect example to follow, and that they must imitate the words and acts of Muhammad as accurately as possible. Because of this reason, the sunnah (practices which Muhammad established in the community) is described as a main pillar of Sunni doctrine, with the place of hadith having been argued by scholars as part of the sunnah.    Sunnis recognize four major legal traditions (madhhabs): Maliki, Shafi'i, Hanafi, and Hanbali. All four accept the validity of the others and a Muslim might choose any one that he/she finds agreeable to his/her ideas. There are also several orthodox theological or philosophical traditions (kalam).      Shi'a  Shi'a Muslims, the second-largest branch, differ from the Sunni in rejecting the authority of the first three caliphs. They honor different accounts of Muhammad (hadith) and have their own legal traditions. The concept of Imamah (leadership) plays a central role in Shi'a doctrine. Shi'a Muslims hold that leadership should not be passed down through a system such as the caliphate, but rather, descendants of Muhammad should be given this right as Imams.|`|AA11117485	From my understanding, it has to do with a conflict between Mohamed's daughter Fatima and one of his wives about who should take over leadership of the religion after he died.

This sentence translates the Arabic text, above, from the Quran. It continues: Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds: The Beneficent, the Merciful: Owner of the Day of Judgement. Thee (alone) we worship; Thee (alone) we ask for help. Show us the straight path: The path of those whom Thou hast favoured; Not (the path) of those who earn Thine anger nor of those who go astray.The Quran, surah 1:1-7, MMP.    2 These words form Al-Fatihah (The Opening), the first chapter, or surah, of the Muslim holy book, the Holy Quran, or Koran. Since more than 1 in 6 of the worlds population is Muslim and devout Muslims repeat these verses more than once in each of their five daily prayers, these must be among the most recited words on earth.    3 According to one source, there are over 900 million Muslims in the world, making Islam second only to the Roman Catholic Church in numbers. It is perhaps the fastest growing major religion in the world, with an expanding Muslim movement in Africa and the Western world.    4 The name Islam is significant to a Muslim, for it means submission, surrender, or commitment to Allah, and according to one historian, it expresses the innermost attitude of those who have hearkened to the preaching of Mohammed. Muslim means one who makes or does Islam.    5 Muslims believe that their faith is the culmination of the revelations given to the faithful Hebrews and Christians of old. However, their teachings diverge from the Bible on some points, even though they cite both the Hebrew and the Greek Scriptures in the Quran. (See box, page 285.) To understand the Muslim faith better, we need to know how, where, and when this religion started.    Muhammads Calling    6 Muhammad was born in Mecca (Arabic, Makkah), Saudi Arabia, about 570?C.E. His father, `Abd Allah, died before Muhammads birth. His mother, Aminah, died when he was about six years old. At that time the Arabs practiced a form of worship of Allah that was centered in the Mecca valley, at the sacred site of the Ka`bah, a simple cubelike building where a black meteorite was revered. According to Islamic tradition, the Ka`bah was originally built by Adam according to a celestial prototype and after the Deluge rebuilt by Abraham and Ishmael. (History of the Arabs, by Philip K.?Hitti) It became a sanctuary for 360 idols, one for each day of the lunar year.    7 As Muhammad grew up, he questioned the religious practices of his day. John Noss, in his book Mans Religions, states: [Muhammad] was disturbed by incessant quarreling in the avowed interests of religion and honor among the Quraysh chiefs [Muhammad belonged to that tribe]. Stronger still was his dissatisfaction with the primitive survivals in Arabian religion, the idolatrous polytheism and animism, the immorality at religious convocations and fairs, the drinking, gambling, and dancing that were fashionable, and the burial alive of unwanted infant daughters practiced not only in Mecca but throughout Arabia.Surah 6:137.    8 Muhammads call to be a prophet took place when he was about 40 years of age. He had the custom of going alone to a nearby mountain cave, called Ghar Hira, for meditation, and he claimed that it was on one of these occasions that he received the call to be a prophet. Muslim tradition relates that while he was there, an angel, later identified as Gabriel, commanded him to recite in the name of Allah. Muhammad failed to respond, so the angel caught him forcefully and pressed him so hard that he could not bear it anymore. Then the angel repeated the command. Again, Muhammad failed to react, so the angel?choked him again. This occurred three times before Muhammad started to recite what came to be viewed as the first of a series of revelations that constitute the Quran. Another tradition relates that divine inspiration was revealed to Muhammad like the ringing of a bell.The Book of Revelation from Sahih Al-Bukhari.    Revelation of the Quran    9 What is said to have been the first revelation received by Muhammad? Islamic authorities generally agree that it was the first five verses of surah 96, entitled Al-Alaq, The Clot [of Blood], which reads:    In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.  Read: In the name of thy Lord who created.  Created man from a clot.  Read: And thy Lord is the Most Bounteous,  Who taught by the pen,  Taught man that which he knew not.  MMP.    10 According to the Arabic source The Book of Revelation, Muhammad answered, I do not know how to read. Therefore, he had to memorize the revelations so that he could repeat and recite them. The Arabs were skilled in the use of memory, and Muhammad was no exception. How long did it take for him to receive the complete message of the Quran? It is generally believed that the revelations came during a period of some 20 to 23 years, from about 610?C.E. to his death in 632?C.E.    11 Muslim sources explain that upon receiving each revelation, Muhammad immediately recited it to those who happened to be near. These in turn committed the revelation to memory and by recitation kept it alive. Since the manufacture of paper was unknown to the Arabs, Muhammad had the revelations written down by scribes on the primitive materials then available, such as shoulder blades of camels, palm leaves, wood, and parchment. However, it was not until after the prophets death that the Quran took its present form, under the guidance of Muhammads successors and companions. This was during the rule of the first three caliphs, or Muslim leaders.    12 Translator Muhammad Pickthall writes: All the surahs of the Quran had been recorded

Seu fundador foi John Smyth (1.570-1.612) e est localizada na Holanda. A histria de Smyth come?a na Inglaterra onde ele foi ordenado como sacerdote anglicano em 1.594. Logo depois de sua ordena??o, seu zelo levou-o  pris?o por recusar-se a conformar-se aos ensinos e prticas da Igreja da Inglaterra. Ele foi um orador que era rpido em desafiar outros sobre suas cren?as, mas era tambm t?o rpido para mudar suas prprias posi??es  medida que sua prpria teologia pessoal mudava. Smyth continuamente combateu a Igreja da Inglaterra at que come?ou a ficar bvio que ele n?o podia mais ficar em comunh?o com esta igreja. Assim, ele finalmente rompeu totalmente com ela e se tornou um "separatista".   Em 1.609, Smyth, junto com um grupo na Holanda, veio a crer no batismo do crente (oposto ao batismo de crian?as que era a norma da poca) e eles se uniram para formar a igreja "batista". No incio, Smyth concordava com a posi??o ortodoxa tpica da igreja; mas  medida que o tempo passava, como era t?o tpico, ele come?ou a mudar suas posi??es. Primeiro, Smyth insistiu que a verdadeira adora??o era do cora??o e que qualquer forma de leitura a partir de um livro na adora??o era uma inven??o do homem pecador. Ora??o, cantico e prega??o tinham que ser completamente espontaneos. Ele foi t?o longe com esta mentalidade que n?o permitia a leitura da Bblia durante a adora??o "uma vez que ele considerava as tradu??es inglesas das Escrituras como algo menos do que a palavra direta de Deus" (McBeth, p 35).   Segundo, Smyth introduziu uma lideran?a eclesistica de duas dobras, pastor e dicono. Isso estava em contraste com a lideran?a reformada de trs dobras composta por presbtero-pastor, presbtero-leigo e diconos.   Terceiro, com sua recm-descoberta posi??o sobre batismo, uma preocupa??o completamente nova surgiu para estes "batistas". Tendo sido batizados quando crian?as, eles todos perceberam que tinham que ser rebatizados. Uma vez que n?o havia outro ministro para administrar o batismo, Smyth batizou-se a si mesmo e ent?o continuou a batizar seu rebanho. Uma observa??o interessante neste ponto que deveria ser feita como fundamenta??o  que o modo do batismo usado era o da aspers?o, pois a imers?o n?o se tornaria o padr?o durante mais uma gera??o. Antes de sua morte, como parece caracterstica de Smyth, ele abandonou sua vis?o batista e come?ou a tentar trazer seu rebanho para a igreja menonita. Apesar de ter morrido antes que isso acontecesse, a maior parte da congrega??o uniu-se  igreja menonita depois de sua morte.   Agora voltamos nossa aten??o para Thomas Helwys. Ele tinha um relacionamento meio agitado com Smyth, mas depois que Smyth come?ou a se afastar da f dos batistas gerais, Helwys continuou com os primrdios batistas. Helwys levou seu pequeno grupo para a Inglaterra em 1611 e esta foi considerada a primeira igreja batista em solo ingls. Este grupo aferrado ao batismo do crente, rejeitou o calvinismo por uma posi??o favorvel ao livre-arbtrio (o que inclua o cair da gra?a), e permitiu que cada igreja elegesse seus oficiais, tanto presbteros como diconos (ou diaconisas). Por volta de 1.624, havia cinco igrejas batistas gerais conhecidas e por volta de 1650 elas contavam pelo menos 47 (McBeth, p 39). Apesar de alguns poderem ver o movimento batista moderno neste grupo, temos que entender que as cren?as deste grupo est?o longe da heran?a reformada que modelou a f dos batistas modernos.

Paix?o: do latim passione = sofrimento, sentimento excessivo;  afeto violento; entusiasmo, clera, grande mgoa; vcio dominador; alucina??o; sofrimento intenso (lembra-se? PAIX?O de Cristo)    Paix?o, j no vocabulrio grego deriva de paschein, padecer uma determinada a??o ou efeito de algum evento.  algo que acontece  pessoa independente de sua vontade ou mesmo contra ela. De paschein deriva pathos e patologia. Pathos designa tanto emo??o como sofrimento e doen?a.    Amor, na verdade,  um s, a diferen?a est no que as pessoas julgam estar sentindo. Muitas pessoas interpretam EMO??ES fortes como sendo amor, porm o SENTIMENTO verdadeiro n?o causam brigas, cimes, inveja, discrdia, nada disso decorre do verdadeiro amor.     Esse tipo de sentimento  resultado do nosso EU, da nossa vontade, dos nossos desejos, enfim, do nosso egosmo e nada mais alm disso. O sofrimento nunca ser sinal de amor. Quando o amor  real ele tudo espera, tudo cr, tudo suporta... o verdadeiro amor jamais acaba.    Enfim Paix?o  emo??o, amor sentimento...    Voc pensa que emo??es e sentimentos s?o sin?nimos?    - quando  Amor o que voc sente - n?o importa por quem  ou pelo qu - a sensa??o  t?o agradvel, que voc n?o  sente o mnimo desejo de se livrar dela.  O Amor  sentimento. Sentimento faz bem.    - quando  dio, voc pode notar que  como se o seu peito se  fechasse, o ar parece ser insuficiente para sua oxigena??o.  A respira??o fica ofegante e curta.  uma sensa??o horrvel.  O dio  emo??o. Emo??o faz mal.     comum confundirmos pessoas sentimentais com pessoas  emotivas e pensamos que  a mesma coisa, mas n?o :  a pessoa sentimental n?o sofre, mas a emotiva sim.  Emocionar-se  "doer-se".  Emo??o  rudo. Sentimento  silncio.    A paix?o  emo??o e, s por isso,  faz tanto estardalha?o, tanto estrago no continuar das coisas.  H quem mate "em nome do Amor", mas h um engano:  a paix?o pode fazer matar, mas o Amor n?o.    H um incontvel nmero de coisas que sentimos e  que s?o confundidas, ora com sentimento, ora com emo??o.    S?o emo??es: dio, a inveja, o cime, vingan?a, ressentimento, a culpa, a mgoa, a raiva, e por a a fora.    Voc notou como tudo isso  denso, pesado, sufocante?  As emo??es nos prendem, os sentimentos nos libertam.

AA10774783	That's a matter of who you ask:     Iran's point of view: Tehran believes in defending the historical term "Persian Gulf" against "Arabian Gulf," which it regards as a name dreamed up by Arab nationalists.    The Arab gulf states' point of view: The Arab countries on the gulf have all been influneced by the Arab nationalism. Thus, if you ask any random person from Bahrain, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, or Oman what the gulf is called, they'll reply "the Arabian Gulf", sometimes even oblivious to the fact that there is another name.    The US's point of view: In the United States, Persian Gulf has been the label sanctioned for U.S. government use since a decision by the State Department's Board of Geographical Names in 1917. This practice remains State Department policy. In recent years, due to increased cooperation with Arab states of the Persian Gulf, various branches of the U.S. armed forces have issued directives to their members to use the "Arabian Gulf" when operating in the area ("Persian Gulf" is still used in official publications and websites), partially to follow local conventions, or simply to follow local laws that ban the use of "Persian Gulf", e.g. in the United Arab Emirates. Also for similar reasons, branches of American universities in the region have also dropped references to "Persian Gulf" in their teaching materials.|`|AA11036328	Officially its Persian Gulf, but Arabs like to call it Arabian Gulf, because it touches more Arabian countries than Persian(duh)|`|039a4209d75aec6ea8da5a881910e67caa	it's the Persian Gulf on one side and the Arab gulf on the other. now, what about the English canal / lamanche, the gulf of Mexico / the Caribbean, etc.|`|9c040528120bcd41bccd904fa3d43a14aa	If you are talking about the gulf which Iraq is joined onto, then it is the Persian Gulf or the Gulf of Persia.
807896964b6a149310aa786e3a57e292aa	H um estranho paralelismo entre o programa-projeto do Romantismo, que defende o ideal de identidade nacional sacralizada, particularmente no romance histrico, e a obra de Rosrio Ferr. Tanto no romance Maldito Amor, como em seus contos, a presen?a da historicidade e da identidade nacional  marcante. O que diferencia a autora de seus precursores romanticos  o endere?amento dado a essa identidade e a esse historicismo que, longe de ser nostlgico e idealizado,  fortemente ideolgico, abordado de maneira altamente engajada e refor?ado com robustos argumentos de ordem econ?mico-poltica, de forma que a fronteira entre histria e literatura se torna movedi?a, deixando passar variados pontos de vista, mostrando suas contradi??es e distor??es ideolgicas1 canalizadas por vozes femininas.    Essa diferen?a, entre outras, deve-se provavelmente a um importante ingrediente da narrativa de Rosrio de Ferr que se apia n?o somente na defesa da mulher, mas na valoriza??o da mulher como o elemento que corta com um passado de escravid?o, de humilha??o, de violncia fsica e moral e levanta sua voz com uma coragem e uma for?a que dinamizam de forma extraordinria tanto o romance em quest?o como os seus contos.    Na obra analisada percebe-se o caminho firme e paralelo de poltica e literatura, de feminismo e de histria, de racismo e de pujante negritude; de uma histria na qual a mulher n?o  mera espectadora, mas ativa participante na prpria escritura dessa histria.    O romance inicia-se no sculo XIX e come?a tra?ando um amplo painel de Porto Rico, esa aterradora tierra de nadie (Maldito Amor, p.9)2, ambgua, bifronte, centurica, cantada como um den moderno pelo autores portorriquenhos, que glorificam a natureza e a terra em busca de uma identidade nacional que parece sempre conflictiva e insuficiente (op. cit. p.10). J a partir do nome desse minsculo pas, Porto Rico, diz a autora,  possvel delinear a identidade portorriquenha que caminha pari passu com a riqueza produzida pela terra e por sua prpria natureza geogrfica no sculo XIX, quando o pas desenvolve suas potencialidades agrrias no cultivo da cana de a?car, do caf e do fumo, por isso Rico, e a identidade do sculo XX que est atrelada a profundas mudan?as poltico-econ?micas sublinhando a grande transforma??o da ilha, por isso Porto.     pelo porto que no sculo XX os produtos industrializados partem para os Estados Unidos, e  do porto que centenas de milhares de portorriquenhos se mudam para o den americano. Saem com a inten??o de um dia voltarem. Porto Rico torna-se assim ponto de partida de nativos e de mercadoria e ponto de chegada de imigrados ou refugiados que o resto da Amrica Latina recusou. Porto Rico evidencia dessa forma sua natureza hbrida de pas apostillado por Amrica del Sur y apestillado con Amrica del Norte ... y sobre todo atracadero, desembarcadero, fondeadero del Paraso de sue?os. (op. cit., p.13).    Enquanto a primeira parte do romance Maldito Amor est envolvida com a narrativa da histria de Porto Rico, de seu desenvolvimento e industrializa??o progressiva, de sua americaniza??o (entendendo-se aqui a assimila??o do estilo americano de vida), com a forte interferncia das mulheres que corrigem, no sentido de torn-la real e autntica, a histria contada pelos caciques corruptos e autoritrios, os trs contos que integram o livro se detm mais nas personagens femininas em suas transgress?es em prol de uma histria onde a voz da mulher portorriquenha adquire um tom mais forte, mais metlico, mais capaz de ser ouvido e, sem dvida, mais autntico.    No conto El regalo, o primeiro da trilogia, temos uma narrativa em que as vozes femininas s?o predominantes. Trata-se de vozes normalmente acostumadas ao silncio, ao sussurro, n?o somente na sociedade machista dos anos 50, mas principalmente no educandrio feminino dirigido por irm?s catlicas, onde se evidencia a tremenda incoerncia da violncia da mulher contra a mulher. As meninas do colgio s?o educadas para a subservincia, para serem m?es e esposas exemplares (na subservincia e na aceita??o passivas da aliena??o, quando n?o da violncia). Mas quando a violncia, moral e material, e a injusti?a se tornam insuportveis, s?o duas alunas que conseguem reverter o quadro com um ato de insurrei??o preparado e amadurecido atravs de uma srie de alegorias que culminam com a expuls?o de Carlota e de Merceditas, mas tambm com a vitria das duas sobre o preconceito racial e social e, sobretudo, sobre a hipocrisia, o esprito fariseu do colgio e da prpria sociedade como um todo. Uma vitria que coloca em xeque uma srie de valores cristalizados como, por exemplo, o poder da reverenda madre Artigas, a todopoderosa monja que desfruta de favores especiais porque sua famlia forneceu o prdio do colgio e por isso ela recebeu uma dispensa papal que lhe permite ficar no colgio, enquanto as demais religiosas s?o removidas a cada trs anos, para que n?o criem vnculos afetivos.    Mas o poder conferido pelo novo status e pelo dinheiro tambm est presente na contram?o: o surgimento de uma nova e forte burguesia do comrcio  que permitiu a entrada de Carlota, menina mulata, no aristocrtico colgio, e que a torna rainha do Carnaval, festa tradicionalmente realizada pelas camadas de elite da cidade e agora organizada com a participa??o popular. Embora aparentemente isolado, o episdio deixa espa?o para desdobramentos que o leitor pode intuir e acompanhar, fazendo o contraponto de suas importantes conseqncias sociais, em fun??o de sua inscri??o no contexto sociopoltico e econ?mico de Porto Rico na poca da ambienta??o do conto.

Eu sei que  difcil a separa??o, mas num caso desses.. sinceramente, mesmo voc a amando porque isso s faz com que voc se sinta mal... Quem cala, consente, e se eu estivesse no seu lugar, n?o teria consentido! Se ela faz isso  porque n?o te ama ou n?o te respeita. Mostre para ela, que voc merece ser amado e respeitado. At porque s?o poucos os homens que amam e respeitam de verdade a sua mulher. Se ela n?o te merece, tenho certeza de que poder encontrar quem te mere?a de verdade! Boa sorte!    -------------------------------------    Tambem gostei muito da idia da Margot a de cima, nisso eu concordo com ela. Pode estar faltando algo no relacionamento, entao tenha uma conversa franca com ela.

The challange she faces though, is letting go of the pain of loss hence the reccurance of the dream.  It is highlighting the need to let go of the pain, allow his spirit to pass and to move on!

I'm not sure why you put this question in R&S, unless you're looking for a theological answer.    I too have had reacurring dreams, and one imparticular frightening one, but I've never looked at it from a theological point of view.      Does your mother dream often, for instance every night or even when she naps during the day?  I asked my family doctor about mine and she asked me these questions.  She pointed out what I was going through in my life at the time, and gave me a sleeping pill.    I didn't like the meds.  I felt out of touch, so to speak, when I couldn't dream.  Scary or not.      I'm sorry, I said all of that to say this, there are people who believe that the deceased do try to let their loved ones know they are okay.  I questioned it once because of my faith and was surprised at all the answers I received.  I was pointed to articles about such things.  I'm not sure there is scripture to help you, but I firmly believe that your mother will see and hold her son again and you will see your brother.  God Bless.|`|6a0dd7563167279d8fff996ef06631f5aa	It is afterall only a dream.  No hidden messages, no deep dark supernatural business about them.  Dreams are a product of our subconscious minds.  So obviously your mom has been thinking about the lost son during her waking hours and those unresolved thoughts and feelings come out in the form of dreams.

13d1b5d0008ffdb492f4a4a3e91c818aaa	Hi there... I didn't understand your question thoroughly.. If you are asking about hijab (covering hair).. then yes, muslim women are required to cover their hair and dress modestly... If you are asking about niqab (face veil).. then no, it's not compulsory... depends on one's choice. It is more infact cultural... So, the women getting fatwa to cover their face is inappropriate... and a fatwa (religious ruling) are made in accordance to the latest times where there may be some confusion, understanding an old rule. But, since Qur'an & Prophet Mohammed (pbuh) clearly encourage Hijab... and Niqab is not emphasised... then this fatwa for Niqab does not hold the strenght of what Qur'an and Prophet Mohammed (pbuh) have told.|`|fd2d82939f41bac072788622757f884caa	No, I think they DO have to wear the hijab.  It's the niqab that is optional.  But if a woman feels modest enough to want to wear the full veil, I think she should be allowed to do so.|`|d5f5edf4b62205d3ca96135279361f58aa	Do you know women are one step ahead closer to reality, as they produce next generation.  We cover our re-productive organs as being closer to reality, The reality is always covered by hi-jab in nature. You will not find any element/identity in nature without having an outer shell/skin/fur.   The religion Islam is the religion of nature, that's why Muslim women are supposed to cover their body, to get more respect in society. This is matching with principles of nature and reality.|`|fbc645affb0062326581745bee51635faa	You seem like a nice chappy and I hope you get the right answer|`|d0526f2bf35299e2ac74512f8dff025faa	Some Muslim women choose to wear the hijab.  SOME Muslim men like to keep women in subjection...hence the fatwah.  I do not believe in the tenets of Islam but do not blame them all for the foolish and nasty behaviour of a minority.|`|94aa7b5af1e3c386f126e6a3bc1c8a4aaa	Ok, I will try to explain, its Hijab and that refers to the covering of the hair, not the face veil. They are supposed to wear this out of modesty, and if you mean Fatwa's (religious verdicts) there are varying opinions of the scholars on how much should be covered. But most agree that hair covering is something that should be done out of modesty.    Some stricter people, may say that even face covering is obligated, but this is a contentious issue.     And God knows best.    Think of a practicing Muslim girl, and how she covers, then compare that to a Nun. Quite similar aren't they?|`|AA11634352	Over there, so called "scholars" can be paid to issue any kind of legal ruling.  It has nothing to do with Islam.  The covering of the face is not mandatory, although extremists will have you believe otherwise.  In the Quran, it only says to cover from the neck down, to dress modestly, and to lengthen the garments.  There is nothing about covering the head.  I am a muslim woman, and sometimes I wear full arabic hijab and sometimes, mostly in winter, I wear a nice long winter coat with a hood.  These "fatwas" should not even be allowed when it comes to women's dress, because the Quran says "Let there be no compulsion in religion".  A woman can not be made to dress a certain way just as she can not be made to marry somebody she does not want to.  Screwed up culture and religion are two totally different things.|`|a11f1cb4b0c9fc9f6f3ee4e3c3102702aa	fat wars? oh....that thing in america where obese women wrestle in a swimming pool full of jelly and custard.....|`|AA11036328	I think you mean Nikab (face veil).    "Fatwa"s are just religious statements given out by scholars, or in some cases so - called - scholars. Its not Islamic law. Some of them might be cracked in the head, sorry to say.    If you meant Hijab, it is necessary, but the veil is not part of it.|`|ca9d8fe1a1caa740320f4a00800a07d4aa	Translation required.

13d1b5d0008ffdb492f4a4a3e91c818aaa	Hi there... I know everyone wants to know about Jihad.. U see Jihad is actually to resist the worldly temptations to become a better muslim... to do all the good deeds ordered by Allah(swt)... Now, Jihad in terms of fighting is applied only and only when you or your country is under some foreigners attack... so for self defense you are to go to war... Islam clearly condemns killing the innocent, men, women or children without any reason... But, recently some extremists have edited the meaning of Jihad as it pleased them... deleted the part 'if attacked by a foreigner'.. and applied the rest... So, I wouldn't consider them muslims... nope... they could have used all their love for the religion that they claim into better things... like education for their fellow beings, upliftment of poor etc... So, Jihad is being misused...|`|4cb1f873c0f3ed9f491fe4c2fdd09ebbaa	jihad is actually supposed to be an internal thing, a war against YOURSELF and the temptations of the world, not the world itself.    stupid fundamentalists! :(|`|555dc637603d5c73aa1bdbeef82ea966aa	jihad has a lot of different ways , before a great fight a person came to the prophet mohamed asking to join the gehad but the prophet mohamed refused because that person had his old parents with no one to take care of them but him , so the prophet mohamed told him that taking care of his parents is a better jihad ..  and it is known that fighting the own person's bad ideas and needs is the highest and the most difficult form of jihad..  but i think you are asking about the fighting way of jihad , jihad is only to be announced when you're country or religion is to under attack not to attack , it is about defending your thoughts and beliefs and country..|`|4b0c342b9d3903c7e5dc043197cd2634aa	There are a great many untruths and half-truths about jihad today. But the Koran is clear. It contains numerous verses that state in no uncertain terms that unless a Muslim takes up arms against the infidels, he is not a true Muslim and has no part in the paradise promised to Muslims. The question is complicated by the fact that there are also many contradictory verses in the Koran. One of the verses most quoted by Muslims in conversation with Christians is :"There shall be no compulsion in reliigion". Most believe these verses date from the early period of Mohammad's career, when he still harbored the hope that Jews and Christians would freely accept his "prophetic" status.       Unfortunately this relatively pacifist version of Islam, was superseded during Mohammad's lifetime. Later in the Prophet's career he turned furiously on the Jews and Christians who rejected him, and began to preach that they must be conquered by force.        From the earliest days of Islam, Muslims have acted on these commands. First Mohammad unified the Arabian peninsula under his rule and directed that all religions be forbidden there except Islam(followed by Saudi Arabia to this day).         Then the Muslims turned to the larger non-Muslim world. Muslim Arabia was surrounded by predominantly Christian lands, particularly the Byzantine imperial holdings of Syria, Palestine and Egypt. The Byzantine's great rival, Persia also had a significant Christian population. Mohamad himself made the first islamic overtures to these neighbours. He sent letters to the leaders of Persia, Byzantium and Abyssinia, exhorting them to "embrace Islam and you will be safe".  None did, and Mohammad's warning proved accurate: none of them were safe. (from Arabian Muslims). In 635, 3 years after Mohammad's death, Damascus where St Paul had seen the great vision that turned him into an energetic follower of Christ, fell to the invading Muslims. Jerusalem fell two years later, in 638.       Then came the turn of Egypt, long a bastion of Christianity and home to the great saints of the early church - St Anthony, St Cyril and St Athanasius. Perhaps because there was so much resistance, the invaders were especially brutal.       Muslim armies then turned to Constantinople (now Istanbul) in 638 and 717, failing both times. Muslims rapidly swept through Christian North Africa, home of St Cyprian and St Augustine and by 711 were in position to invade Spain in Europe ( more than 300 years before any European Crusade in 1095, that initially started as a defensive measure for Europe, before its aims were expanded ) !        By 715, almost all of Spain was conquered and remained in Muslims hands for the next 700 years! Subsequent invasions of France in 732 were stopped at Tours. In 792 the ruler of Muslim Spain called for a new incursion into France which also failed, after being able to do a great deal of damage.       Arguably, the Islamic Jihad has been ongoing since the creation of Islam, for the last 1400 years and will be ongoing till the whole world is forced into submission by the Muslims. The theology of jihad was set aside only in practice, not in theory, due to the current technological inferiority of the house of Islam. This theology has never been repudiated by any significant Muslim sect.        There are still lesser forms of jihad however:  (1) Migration to infidel's lands for the sake of Muslim evanglization  (2) Oral jihad, which is the apologetic struggle to defend Islam against detractors,  (3) Written jihad, which involves publishing books, websites and other forums to defend and spread Islam, or raising money and recruits for Islamic causes,  (4) Construction in jihad, which involvs building mosques and Islamic schools especially in on-Muslim lands,  (5) Monetary support for jihad (which involves establishing Ilamic banks, insurance companies, truts and business partnerships, levying special taxes (jizya) on infidels; supporting the families of those who wage jihad in all its different forms, the Mujahideen as well as the "martyrs" who have died exercising lethal force or suiide attacks upon infidels and   (6) Intelligence jihad, which involves collecting information about Christian missionaries in Islamic countries via open public records of churches and organizations, and supplying these records to Islamic groups for the sake of countermeasures.        The system of jihad contrary to stated opinion in the West is well supported and thought out. This theology has thus never been repudiated by any significant Muslim sect.|`|a763cb1d1c1e24d6690f01f3355254d1aa	Jihad has many meanings or interpretations.    Some define it literally as "Holy War" with the emphasize on the word "war" which is not accurate.    For knowledgeable Muslims, Jihad is never meant to be "going to war blindly and kill people whoever the Muslims like"    To knowledgeable Muslims, Jihad refers to spiritual development. Today we should be a better person than yesterday and tomorrow we should be better than today.    Because Jihad has a deeper spiritual meaning, the following actions are also considered jihad:  1) Improving your family's economy;  2) Improving your country's economy;  3) Improving yourself to become a better person  4) And many positive acts    Hence, to many Muslims, it is not appropriate to use the word "jihad" to refer to general war or terrorism.    If you are referring to the current wars that have happened or still happening in this world, then the majority of Muslims view may be generally divided into two:  1. Basically fighting and killing people without a just cause is bad.  2. Anyone has the right to defend his country if his country is attacked by outside force or other country. People who defend their country should not be labelled as terrorists.    Having said that, Muslims who want to defend their country must adhere to the Islamic Law in engaging war such as the Muslim soldiers are prohibited from killing innocent people, women, children and old men.|`|e91bde9e04633732da5f64c8db459fbaaa	Just wait.

Just sit back and wait   For the Jedi Mind tricks  to come rolling in.|`|b2cd23ab11bae58e3a52d39d0d3ffe5caa	jihad is very diffrent then how the media puts it. there are many types of jihads, inner and outer. if u are tempted to smoke and u know that it is haram(forbidden) and u stop urself, thats ur jihad. as for the fighting, when someone attacks islam/muslims/country and u fight back thats jihad. what these muslims who are doing jihad are protecting their families, relatives, loved ones, people, and country. they are being attacked and they are trying to protect theirselves and for doing that they are called terrorist doing jihad. that is said by the media. please try to understand the true meaning of it. may allah help us all. take care.  :)|`|AA12295055	A Global war  (The greatest Jihad is actually inner struggle) is not Islamic. People are only to fight those who fight them first or if they are being oppressed in their lands. That is the limits God has bestowed on obedient Muslims. Muslims who wage wars to strike fear in the hearts of innocent people, people who have not caused harm to them, will suffer a great punishment.  Muslims are allowed to defend themselves, but strickly only in self defense or fighting against tyranny. Any other acts of war is a sin.                Rules of War*    [2:190] You may fight in the cause of GOD against those who attack you, but do not aggress. GOD does not love the aggressors.     [2:191] You may kill those who wage war against you, and you may evict them whence they evicted you. Oppression is worse than murder. Do not fight them at the Sacred Masjid, unless they attack you therein. If they attack you, you may kill them. This is the just retribution for those disbelievers.     [2:192] If they refrain, then GOD is Forgiver, Most Merciful.     [2:193] You may also fight them to eliminate oppression, and to worship GOD freely. If they refrain, you shall not aggress; aggression is permitted only against the aggressors.     [2:194] During the Sacred Months, aggression may be met by an equivalent response. If they attack you, you may retaliate by inflicting an equitable retribution. You shall observe GOD and know that GOD is with the righteous.     [2:195] You shall spend in the cause of GOD; do not throw yourselves with your own hands into destruction. You shall be charitable; GOD loves the charitable.               How Terriosits think who do terrorists acts in the name of Islam      [2:8] Then there are those who say, "We believe in GOD and the Last Day," while they are not believers.     [2:9] In trying to deceive GOD and those who believe, they only deceive themselves without perceiving.     [2:10] In their minds there is a disease. Consequently, GOD augments their disease. They have incurred a painful retribution for their lying.     [2:11] When they are told, "Do not commit evil, (terror, etc..)" they say, "But we are righteous!"     [2:12] In fact, they are evildoers, but they do not perceive.

I would not agree with anyone saying that raising a child by sharing religious belief is in itself abuse but I do think raising a child to reject logic is unfair. If you raise them to uncritically accept one religious text over others even when it flies in the face of reality and the physical laws of nature can be a detriment to the child and society. It also sets people up to be dogmatic ideologs who are intolerant of others who don't share their beliefs. This only to me is a problem in the deeply fundamentalist sects where I have a divided feeling between feeling this is a form of abuse and brainwashing and the belief people have the right to raise their children in their own way.     So I don't think raising a child in a religion has to be abuse in itself, depends on how it is done. After all many of us were taught as children that Santa is real and we eventually figured out the truth without too much psychological damage.|`|AA11382947	Well in my town public school has proven to be mentally and physically abusive.

However, in banning Gideon bibles and prayer, the schools have gone too far.  I have nothing against anyone of any religions.  You punish minorities by doing this.  You don't help them.

A real heart has two chambers and is kind of curved at the top.    Also keep in mind that for quite a bit of the historical record, even educated people might not have ever seen a real human heart. Anatomy lessons and realistic illustrations of human organs didn't become the least bit common until the 1600s. If someone said "this is what a heart looks like" everyone believed it; even if it was some 3rd generation copied drawing that no longer bore much semblance to the original subject.|`|d99448cabbe9c28d7e9269c76839c96daa	i think it's cuz it is easier to draw than a real heart...|`|AA11119118	good question!

Subjective truth is that God is what we wish him to be.  God is Who He is, whether we go to Him or not.  He is always faithful and always there.  God loves us just the way we are.  Shouldn't we try to do the same for Him?  God is God and He is good.  This is the time of year that we should see just what God has done for us.  He sent His Son to save us.

But on the other hand, it can go to far. Give someone a little power and they become a dictator. I believe that our government as a whole is trying to do what they can to ensure our safety. Just like us they are not perfect, they make mistakes to. We all just have to work together instead of fighting.

Inuit  From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia  Jump to: navigation, search  Inuit     Inuit woman      Total population 150,000   Regions with significant populations Greenland, Canada, United States, Russia   Language Inuit language,  Eskimo-Aleut languages   Religion Christianity, Shamanism   Related ethnic groups Aleuts, Yupiks   For other uses, see Inuit (disambiguation).   Inuit (Inuktitut syllabics, singular Inuk / ???) is a general term for a group of culturally similar indigenous peoples inhabiting the Arctic coasts of Siberia, Alaska, the Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Quebec, Labrador, and Greenland. Until fairly recent times, there has been a remarkable homogeneity in the culture throughout this area, which traditionally relied on fish, sea mammals, and land animals for food, heat, light, clothing, tools, and shelter. Their language, sometimes incorrectly called Inuktitut, is grouped under Inuit language or Eskimo-Aleut languages.    The Inuit Circumpolar Conference defines its constituency to include Canada's Inuit and Inuvialuit, Greenland's Kalaallit people, Alaska's Inupiaq and Yupik people, and Russia's Yupik. However, the Yupik are not Inuit in the sense of being descended from the Thule and prefer to be called Yupik or Eskimo.    Canadian Inuit live primarily in Nunavut (a territory in Canada), Nunavik (the northern part of Quebec) and in Nunatsiavut (the Inuit settlement region in Labrador). The Inuvialuit live primarily in the Mackenzie River delta, on Banks Island and part of Victoria Island in the Northwest Territories. There have been Inuit settlements in Yukon, especially at Herschel Island, but there are none at present. Alaskan Inupiaq live on the North Slope of Alaska, while the Yupik live in western Alaska and a part of Chukotka Autonomous Okrug in Russia.    The Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami is a national organization in Canada which represents over 40,000 Canadian Inuit.

Accordingly, in Canada the Inuit do not consider themselves and are not usually considered by others as one of the First Nations, a term which normally applies to more southern regions. However, they, the Native North Americans, and the Mtis are collectively recognized by the Canadian constitution as Aboriginal peoples in Canada. Other synonyms for this phrase include "First Nations", "First Peoples", and "Native Peoples", but these terms are generally not used by the Inuit themselves.      [edit] Eskimo  Main article: Eskimo  In Inuktitut, the language of the Inuit people, "Inuit" means "the people". The English word "Eskimo" is of uncertain origins, but most likely derives from an Algonquian language. It is widely believed to mean "eater of raw meat", although this meaning is disputed. Many Inuit consider the word Eskimo offensive, but, in absence of any other collective term, it is still in general usage outside of Canada to refer to the tribes of people, including the Inuit, who live at the northern extremities of Asia, Greenland and North America. Canadians tend to use the term Inuit in part a result of the 1977 Inuit Circumpolar Conference. The name Inuit was chosen at this meeting of Inuit from Greenland, Canada, and Alaska, representing a circumpolar population of 150,000.    The term Eskimo is also used in some linguistical or ethnographical works to denote the bigger branch of Eskimo-Aleut languages (the other one being Aleut). In this usage, Inuit (together with Yupik, and maybe also Sireniki), are subbranches of Eskimo. See details in articles Eskimo and Eskimo-Aleut languages.      [edit] Anthropological analysis  Inuit physically resemble East Asians. Inuit have some specific characteristics which were thought to differentiate them from the East Asians: dolichocephalic (elongated) heads, stout bodies and tan skin. Their physical appearance is closer to what is generally associated with East Asian peoples than to other Native Americans.       Distribution of Inuit language variants across the Arctic.The Inuit were traditionally hunters and fishermen, living off the Arctic animal life. They hunted by preference whales, walruses, caribou and seals, although polar bears, musk oxen, birds, and any other edible animals might be turned to during lean years. The Arctic has very little edible vegetation, although Inuit did supplement their diet with seaweed.    Sea animals were hunted from single-passenger, covered seal-skin boats called qajait (singular qajaq) which were extraordinarily buoyant, and could easily be righted by a seated person, even if completely overturned. Because of this property, the Inuit design was copiedalong with the Inuit wordby Europeans who still make and use them under the name kayak. Inuit also made umiaqlarger, open boats made out of skins and bones for transporting people, goods and dogs. In the winter, Inuit would also hunt sea mammals by finding, or sometimes making, the aglu (a breathing hole) in the ice and waiting for the air-breathing se|`|d06e8ec29eee77273af4a9b0c9340869aa	inuits you yank

13d1b5d0008ffdb492f4a4a3e91c818aaa	Hi there... yes, I am sure ou are confused as to why muslims bow in front of the Ka'bah... Actually, Islam prohibits Idol worshipping... Now, the ka'bah in no way represents God, or Form of God... It is simply a centre to which all muslims face towards and pray... So that unity in prayers is established. So muslims do not pray TO the Ka'bah.. They just pray FACING the direction of the Ka'bah. As to the black stone which muslims kiss on the Ka'bah.. it is said to have been sent from heaven.. So, muslims, as a sign of love and respect kiss it with emotion. It again does not represent God... As for seeing the moon and Ramadan starting.. You have to know that Muslims follow the Lunar Calendar, based on the sighting of the moon, the Holy month of Ramadan starts... So, it again does not make the moon God...   Hope that it helps...   Peace!|`|AA11684190	How can we brand.(your statement) while we know that Jews & Christians believe in the same God as we do?  Where on earth did you hear us say this??

I don't know what "golden goose" refers to here, but if you know what it means, then I assume that someone or something can be "under the pretext" of it.    But I don't know what you're trying to say with that phrase, so when you're asking if it is "correct," I don't know what sort of "correctness" you are striving for (grammatical?  understandable?  what?).  So the question is not fully answerable.|`|ca8512af7da2020d8a262f8b651b00c3aa	no, "Golden Goose" is a fable. A pretext would be more of a precedent, or paradigm one operates under.

13d1b5d0008ffdb492f4a4a3e91c818aaa	Ok Miss Ex-Muslimah... First of all, Allah does NOT ask us to lremember the Qur'an by heart... Infact, Allah has placed greater reward on those, who read the meaning and understand the teachings... Secondly, there are translations of the Qur'an in almost every language, in case you didn't know. So, as muslims it is our duty to read and understand the Qur'an in the languages that we follow.. we don't have to switch our language to Arabic... Arabic is a beautiful language.. and as non-arabic muslims learning to read Arabic is the least thing we can do to please Allah(swt)...  So, arabic for recitation... learn a few Surahs for praying purpose.. And use other languages for understanding... And finally no compulsion to By heart the Qur'an... And finally, I think due to minimal knowledge about Islam, you are now an ex-muslimah (though I doubt you ever were a muslim)...|`|c1ad51552f3bcdbd80b091510da04a61aa	Are you stupid?    We're not meant to just learn it in arabic. We are supposed to learn it and understand it. To undrstand it, you have to learn the best language which is Arabic.    So once you learnt arabi you can speak it, understand it. So when reciting/reading the Qur'aan you will know and understand the Qur'aan as well as listening to it.    And you call your self an ex-muslimah.... you don't even know this much!

Do research on all that you are considering, and if you find one that you feel drawn towards, that is your choice.

05f747c16a0214a7dc3bf09905e4cc0faa	Well my friend, I'd say find the Tao. Sound wierd. O.k. If you want to remember a single word, it is BUILD. Over time, you want to look how to build constructive approaches to problems and things.    First stop worrying about "loving" yourself. Worry about living life learning new experiences and just admit you have limitations and strengths like everything else. You problem probably is not "loving" yourself but that you are holding on to things you cannot change like the past or you strengths and weaknesses. (You can improve on your weaknesses but everybody has different limitations).    What is the Tao anyway? Its the "way", which means its kind of unexplanable. Kind of how things work or how they go smoothly and more, ...    Feeling emptiness is normal. I get that too sometimes. I find being with people helps or doing something I like to do.    Why don;t yu draw something right now. Just grab pencil and paper and draw. Don't worry about the result. When you are finished with that take a walk.    To help you more, probably have to know more about you. Feel free to e-mail me tho here.    In general tho:  1) You can't change the past. Learn from your mistakes but don't beat yourself up over them.  2) Find at least one activity a week, you like to do. Could be as simple as taking a walk.  3) Find at least one activity that puts yo in contact with people with simular interests.

Joseph Campbell states that we find ourselves by following our bliss. You have to figure out what is meaningful and important for you, what are the priorities in your life, is it family? education? travel? wealth? glory? maybe opening a little cafe by the beach (sorry, that one's mine, but doesn't it sound great??). Strive to reach your goals and enjoy the journey along the way.     Sometimes it is only through communication with others that you learn about yourself. If you need to chat you can email me. I promise to listen and communicate positively :).    Good luck!

Das war nur Show. Das Sozialsystem wird von den Staaten bisher als ein Machtinstrument gegen die eigene Bev?lkerung missbraucht.    Theoritisch geht es auch anders: ein Modell:    1.500 Euro bedinungsloses Grundeinkommen und eine noch h?here Mehrwertsteuer, als in Skandinavien, n?hmlich statt 16 % momentan (25% in D?nemark und Schweden) und 19 % 2007 satte 50%!    Das hat zur Folge, dass diese 1.500 Euro Bedinungsloses Grundeinkommen in Deutschland selber wegen der durch die Mehrwertsteuer teuren Produkte und Dienstleistungen kaum noch etwas wert w?hren.    Die arbeitende Bev?lkerung wrde erhebliche Lohnerh?hungen bekommen, die Ausl?ndischen Besucher/innen wrden statt 16% dann 50% von jeder umgesetzten Ware oder Dienstleistung dem Fiskus abgeben.    Die Sozialschwachen allerdings k?nnten nur in das fr sie dann noch bezahlbare Ausland - und dort den Leuten erz?hlen, woran das liegt, dass sie als Ausl?nder ohne Arbeit fast genausoviel Geld haben, wie dort die anderen Einheimischen mit Arbeit.    Weil sie Deutsch sind! Und weil Deutschland eben ein gutes Land ist!    Nur vermutlich drehen unsere Europ?ischen Nachbarn und unsere Gesch?ftspartner dann durch. Und wie lange das Ausland diese Nichtstuenden deutschen Sozialschwachen dann akzeptieren wollen, h?ngt ganz von deren Benehmen ab.    Und weil eben das zu extrem und zu risikoreich ist, tendiere ich eher zu einem anderen Modell der Allgemeinen Grundsicherung - meinem eigenen. 750 bis 800 Euro / Kopf / Monat. Spart um die 47 Milliarden Euro / Monatlich gegenber den herk?mmlichen Sozialen Sicherungssystemen.    47 Milliarden Euro monatlich mehr oder wehniger in der Kasse des Fiskus ist schon ein ganze sch?ner Unterschied, finde ich.  Das ist ne Menge Geld, mit der Staatsschulden abbezahlt werden, oder echte Neuinvestitionen gemacht werden k?nnten!    Das Modell kannst Du Dir hier ansehen:    http://de.geocities.com/dkdkzd/b.pdf  .  brigens: So gut wie jedes 1. und 2. Welt - Land hat eine Soziale Absicherung fr seine Brger/innen. In den USA (Welfare), Kanada, GB und Irland, die ganze EU, ganz Skandinavien, D?nemark, Schweiz, sogar Polen und die GUS haben soziale Absicherungssysteme - fr die eigenen Brger/innen. Zum grossen Teil bekommen die Empf?nger/innen schneller eine h?here Kaufkraft, als im vergleich zu Deutschland.    Zu Kaisers Zeiten bekam z. B. eine Hilfebedrftige Junge Mutter nach ihrer Entbindung 2.000 Reichsmark ausgezahlt und hat damit auf einen Schlag eine Kaufkraft fr sich und das Kind und ihre Familie von vergleichbar 20.000 Euro (Stand 2004) gahabt.  Eine Nahverkehrsfahrkarte mit der U-Bahn in Berlin Beispielsweise hatte damals 0,20 Reichsmark gekostet, heute kostet die vergleichbare Fahrkarte 2,30 Euro. Auch alle anderen g?ngigen Preise sind mindestens 1:10!    Frohe Weihnachten!    DK
6f71baa0c1df1b6e4bb4493c4d2915c5aa	One can NOT make a 'famous' person a role model. They have their own agenda. They may have certain qualities that are good, but everyone has ugly secrets. Look a decade ago when all the parents thought The Back Street Boys were a good influence. Turns out they were alcoholic, drug addicts, and gay. Good role models.     I would say that good qualities are those people who are kind, gentle, compassionate, giving, honest and trustworthy.

Was meinst Du, wie Geil ein leben ohne Mobiltelefon sein kann! Und so Strahlungsfrei! Echt, dass merkt man.    Wenn man in Mnchen viel (Winterbedingt) U-Bahn mit dem MVV f?hrt, dann macht man das Telefon am besten aus - oder l?sst es gleich Zuhause. In den meissten U-Bahn - Stationen in Mnchen gibt es da n?hmlich 2006 immer noch keinen H?ndyempfang. Die Reichen da in Mnchen fahren eben nicht MVV, sondern selber, Taxi oder mit Cheuffeur!    Und ohne Sendeempfang dreht das Mobiltelefon in der Tasche sonst richtig auf - und verstrahlt einen w?hrend der gesamten Anwesenheit in dem U-Bahn-Bereich sprbar. Du merkst dann abends zuhause an Deinem K?rper, wo Du das Mobiltelefon in der Tasche hattest! Es gibt leider keinen Menpunkt im Telefon, wo man den Sender und Empf?nger ausschalten kann, wenn man weiss, dass man sowieso keinen Empfang hat. Man kann nur das Telefon als solches ausstellen - und dann lohnt es wegen der ewigen ein.- und ausschalterei nicht mehr. Das macht dann nur viel Stress fr nichts! Und wenn man da ist, wo man hinwollte (Arbeit, Beh?rden, Einkaufsmarkt, beim Spazierengehen (enormer Strassenl?rm berall in Mnchen), Kino, ect.) kann man sowieso auch nicht wirklich telefonieren.    Und dann ist es echt erleichternd, wenn man das Mobiltelefon verkauft hat und strahlungsfrei ist! (Ey, dass habe ich noch nie gesehen: Mitten in Mnchen hat da wer im Zentrum mitten AN eine Hauswand ge...issen! Der Hammer, was?)    In Mnchen Beispielsweise hat der Professor an der Uni mit einem blutenden Auge vorne an der Tafel gestanden und die Lesung gemacht, den hatten sie in dem Krankenhaus trotz des Sportunfalls am Vorabend nicht wirklich verarztet    Kurz: Ich bin aus Mnchen auch aus anderen Grnden weggezogen und wieder in der Zivilisierten Welt.    Woanders passiert anderes: Da koten die Leute, weil sie schwul sind und zudem wegen der Weihnachtszeit zuviel gegessen und getrunken haben, kurz aus dem Mund - und kommen gleich via Rettung und Notarzt ins Krankenhaus. Dabei haben die nur mal gekotzt.    In der Stadt, wo ich jetzt bin, hatte ein Obdachloser so viele Spenden zu Weihnachten bekommen, dass der zwei Polizeibeamte als Escorte brauchte, um in sein Obdachlosenwohnheim sicher zu kommen. Dem fielen da gestern berall die kleinen und mittleren Scheine raus ... . Und andere hatten wohl nicht so viel wie der (bekommen). Der sah aus, wie das an der Mauerwand in Mnchen! Altkleiderklamotten in einem Mllbeutel und die Taschen voll. Aber nicht fr Reisegep?ck. Denn der Mllbeutel war ja seine Werbung. Und zudem sah auch so dennach aus, da wollte man nicht zu nahe kommen und wirklich kucken.  Kein Scherz! Das war "Live" gestern! Das ist auch Weihnachten!    Hier in dieser Stadt hole ich mir auch wieder ein Mobiltelefon. Hier haben die Leute, soweit wie ich sehe, berall Mobilen Telefonempfang. Mit Handy gehts eben leichter.    Ich glaube, dass ich etwa ein gutes halbes Dutzend Notrufe schon ber meine H?ndys abgegeben hatte.    Einmal kam jehmand mit blauen Lippen auf mich zu und bat mich, Hilfe zu holen, er habe gerade einen Herzinfakt und ist danach vor mir umgefallen. Der Notruf war dann schnell, aber die Rettung brauchte etwa 10 Minuten.  Ohne H?ndy h?tte der in einem halb ge?ffneten Fenster eingeklemmte Kater l?nger auf die Rettung durch die Feuerwehr warten mssen - und w?hre eine Minute sp?ter dabei vermutlich erstickt.  Oder wenn ich an die Geistig Verwirrte, die leicht bekleidet mit kaputten Einkaufswagen Nachts im Winter mitten auf einer mehrspurigen Strasse ziellos rumlief denke!  Oder an die ganzen Verunfallten auf den Autobahnen, die da standen und nicht mehr wussten, wie es weiter geht, die nicht wussten, dass und wo es Notrufs?ulen gibt.    Auch ich selber habe im Bad einmal einen Tropfen Rasierwasser im Auge, dessen Flasche eine Woche offen stand, fr mich selber die Rettung holen mssen. Das brannte auf dem Auge sehr stark und ich sah auf dem Auge nur noch dunkelgrau, ohne irgendwelche Details. Dann hatte ich mir versucht, dass Auge auszusplen und dabei habe ich das Zeug dann auch noch in das andere Auge bekommen.    Ich sah damit dann nichts mehr (nur noch dunkelgrau, ohne ein einziges Detail oder eine einzige andere Farbe, aber auch ohne Schatten, oder helle Stellen (keine Lampen), oder sonst irgendwas) und war damit auf einen Schlag v?llig orientierungslos in einer mir unbekannten Umgebung und zudem alleine - und konnte nur noch mit dem Telefon, was ich mit in das Bad genommen hatte, "112" rufen. Mit Blaulicht und Martinshorn haben die mich dann zum Augenaussplen mit einer Spezialflssigkeit ins Krankenhaus gefahren.    War das sch?n, als der Schmerz nachliess, ich in den Armen von zwei Krankenschwestern die ersten Konturen wieder erkennen konnte und dann nach und nach in der ersten halben Stunde ein Teil meiner Sehkraft wiederkam. Panik hatte ich auch schon gehabt. Ich hatte schon versucht, mich damit abzufinden, dass ich von den ?rzten eine bele Diagnose bekommen k?nnte. Bis das dann gegessen gewesen war und ich wieder halbwegs mit den Augen sehen konnte, hat das etwa eine Woche gedauert.    Ohne H?ndy w?hre das echt unangenehm ausgegangen. Das h?tte etwa 10 Minuten l?nger gedauert, bis ich im Krankenhaus gelandet w?hre. Falls ich unter Schock und Panik nach etlichen Strzen berhaupt das Festnetztelefon erreicht h?tte.    Ich weiss nicht, wie sich das Rasierwasser in der offenen Flasche Chemisch ver?ndert hatte, vor kurzem habe ich einen ganzen Spritzer einer anderen Marke, deren Flasche ich frisch ge?ffnet hatte, in ein Auge bekommen und das kaum gemerkt und mein Auge auch noch nicht einmal aussplen mssen.

Von Schneewittchen und dass dies keine Liebe ist, Regeln zu brechen und dass Jesus gehorsam und alle Regeln einhielt und Maria stolz auf ihr Kind war.   Und die Menschen, die sich fuerchten und zu denen nicht der Engel spricht: Fuerchtet Euch nicht, wie den Hirten, ihr Leben in Misstrauen und Angst und Dunkelheit verbringen muessen.

AA10358501	***Internal conflicts:    - Between the 3 prominent races, the Malays, Chinese and Indians (we are talking race, all three are Malaysian nationals). Currently, the Govt. still grants privileges to the Malays that the other races do not get, such as the right to bid for major projects. On the other hand, the Malays are worried from the strong Chinese hold over the economy. 1969 has seen an outbreak of racial riots throughout Malaysia, and the people are still tense.    - The feud between the strongest two political parties: UMNO, the racially mixed governing party, and PAS, the opposing Islamic party. UMNO portrays PAS as backward radicals, while PAS is telling the Muslim majority that their govt. is a Godless one.        ***External conflicts:    - Singapore: Constant feuds over borders and national water ownership. Keep in mind that Malaysians still look down at Singapore as the small state that broke out and got its own independence.    -Indonesia: With the on going forest burning in Indonesia, the effects are always suffered by major cities in Malaysia. Haze almost an annual event, with people having to stay at home and visibility being as little as 2 meters. While Malaysians complain, Indonesia insists on its right as a sovereign nation to do as it pleases within its own borders.    -Philippines: The states of Sabah and Sarawak are legally a part of Malaysia.

Will you be able to talk with the cousin and see if you can still visit occasionally, or at least send gifts?     If not, at least know that you have done a really good thing in giving her a great start in life. In that way, that part of you will always be in her life and help shape the person she becomes.

woJ1yJFVaa	Frher wurden Kleidungsstcke von Hand gef?rbt. Das F?rbemittel fr Blau wurde aus der Pflanze Waid gewonnen. Die ungef?rbten Kleidungsstcke kamen in einen Bottich mit Waidsud. Da Alkohol neben Urin in diesem Sud fr das F?rben sehr wichtig war, allerdings auch nicht gerade billig, tranken die F?rbergesellen den Alkohol, z.B. Bier, und pinkelten dann in den Sud. Je mehr Alkohol getrunken wurde, desto gr??er die Auswirkung auf die Gesellen, die schlie?lich ziemlich benebelt auf der Wiese lagen. Sie waren blau! Daher kommt brigens auch der Ausdruck Blau Machen, da die zu nichts mehr f?hig waren.

Beim zweiten Satzteil geht es um einen Zeitpunkt, daher fallen schon mal alle progressive- Formen (a und d) raus, abgesehen davon, dass a gar nicht existiert ("know" ist ein Zustandsverb und wird daher nicht im present progressive verwendet).     c kann nicht sein, weil davor "when" steht - damit ist ein Zeitpunkt gemeint, der im betreffenden Moment in der Gegenwart liegt. Man k?nnte auch sagen, "as soon as I know the test results". Das ist im Deutschen ja genauso - "sobald ich die Testergebnisse KENNE" und nicht "kennen werde".

Du sie erfahren hast, sie dir bewu?t sind und du sie auch in Zukunft wissen wirst.    Bei a) w?test du die Ergebnisse nur genau in dem Moment, indem du anrufst - ist also falsch.    c) ist doppeltes Futur (keine Ahnung ob es diese Bezeichnung gibt) Der Zeitpunkt zu dem du anrufst liegt in der Zukunft. Von diesem Zeitpunkt gehst du aus. Wenn du dann nochmal Futur benutzt w?re das ein Zeitpunkt in der Zukunft in dem du hoffst in der weiteren Zukunft die Ergebnisse zu erhalten und deswegen anrufst (oder so ?hnlich). Macht auch nicht wirklich sinn.    d) k?nnte auch richtig sein. Mit Futur II hab ich nicht so die Erfahrungen. Wird allerdings so gut wie nie im Englischen gebraucht.

I was near the open window, It was a quiet, sunny summer day. My infant daughter was asleep in her crib. Hubby out at work. I had the day off. The house was quiet. All my chores were done. Lawnmowers droned outside somewhere. I could smell the ocean nearby.     I sat on the step and just took it all in.     There was nothing dramatic or eventful about any of it. The ordinariness of it was what got my attention. Just this normal, everyday moment - completely illuminated by it's own wonderfulness.     Best moment of my life - because I didn't miss it.

I know; it's happened to me many times.|`|278314a9c1b47d192e22487d6a766f4caa	I agree with the first answer, discrimination is discrimination regardless of whom it is directed at.    It's to be expected though and has been repeated in history, it's human nature. An oppressed group will gain status and act as the group that once suppressed it.     In absolutely no way do I support this, make no mistake I find discrimination in any form absolutely disgusting and those that are committing this "reverse discrimination" should be overly ashamed of themselves. Basically there is no progress gained like this and really quite offensive to all the people out there that work for equality.    No matter who you are, gender, race,  sexualtiy, etc... discrimination is discrimination and if you use it against one person you support its use no matter what.

Affirmative Action actually does the opposite of what it was intended for.     Example  1 If 10% of the US population is African American , then the government must hire 10% African American in every department. Thus, they are being hired because of their race.     Example  2 While I was in college, 3% of my graduating class where women. None of the women where in the top of the class but all of them and only the women where offered jobs working for companies or the government.    I've noticed this for quite some time and companies are actually affraid to fire a person, even if they should be, if they fall into minority profile because they can file a lawsuite and 99% of the time win even if they should have been fired.|`|AA11148177	Please specify in what way you are refering.|`|AA11279122	I have no idea what topic you are talking about...but discrimination is discrimination PERIOD...you can call it anything you want but it is still discrimination.|`|6c24bd09d5554084f9dcc2b1547b01d3aa	THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS REVERSE DISCRIMINATION.

Devo ser ordenado um dia sacerdote da Igreja Catolica, e para isto me preparo, ja fui novi?o   por um ano, fiz meus votos de pobreza obediencia e castidade q agora me preparo para enfrentar os longos anos de forma??o academica em Filosofia e Teologia.  A despeito de desde crian?a eu frequentar uma Igreja dos frades franciscanos e sempre ter ficado interessado na vida q levavam, nao procurei este caminho de inicio.. Fiz vestibular para Economia e passei, comecei meu curso, namorei e vivia normalmente como q q  jovem da classe media brasileira.  Um dia foi s jornadas par aa juventude, em Roma, ano 2000, com o inesquecivel Jo?o Paulo II.  Ali alguma coisa come?ou a mudar. O impacto da personalidade do papa, o carisma, a alegria de tantos milhares de jovens unidos pelo carisma do papa tudo isto era impressionante. Rezei muito e me entreguei nas m?os de Deus.  Depois foi a Assis, terra de S?o Francisco.  Ali,na basilica , diante da pedra do transitus, eu senti que alguma coisa mudava pra sempre na minha vida. E chorei muito, pq sabia q qdo saisse dali eu n?o ficaria mais no mundo. Sabia que Deus me chamara, uma voz interior me disse, vem  e segue o que eu vou te mostrar...  E assim eu fiz, e hoje estou aqui, respondendo a vc, e a tantos outros, me equivocando as vezes, outras acertando, fazendo amigos e outros se declarando inimigos meus. Vivendo minha vida de solid?o e de esperan?a na misericordia de Deus.  Sobretudo mergulhado neste Insondvel Mistrio que  a Gra?a de Deus.  Tentando ser operrio da messe Dele.

Seja para ficarem nos bancos das igrejas adorando a Ele, ou para irem aos confins da terra pregarem o evangelho. Por exemplo, Deus me aben?oou com o ministrio de miss?es, isto , falar, incentivar e pregar a palavra de salva??o. Mas, ele tambm aben?oou alguns amigos com o ministrio de orar para as pessoas, outros com o ministrio de louv-lo, dirigirem igrejas e muitos outros.   N?o importa qual  o seu chamado, se voc j o recebeu ou ainda est esperando.

Se uns s?o chamados 100% n?o  mrito deles porque  Deus quem d a eles a gra?a de aceitar. Eu, particularmente, sinto que Deus quer mais de mim, sinto uma inquieta??o, vontade de estar a servi?o. Quando senti respondi de imediato, mas j sofri muito por isso. N?o podemos esquecer que se estamos pisando nas pegadas do Mestre e isso implica em ser crucificado, seja nas incompreens?es dos irm?os de comunidade, julgamentos, ou mesmo dos parentes, dos amigos; h tambm sofrimento quando percebemos que os que s?o chamados a ter um compromisso maior tambm s?o pecadores.

Mas muitos somente com uma busca constante para se ter uma defini??o de ministerio.. (mas todos eles sao chamados).    Vejo que se voce busca de cora??o a Deus, com certeza Deus lhe ouvira. E o chamado vira atraves de profetas, apostolos, Pr. Intercessores e at com uma revela??o direta a voce, os meios que Deus usa s?o maravilhosos uh Gloria.     Leia bastante a Palavra de Deus e observe o que o Espirito Santo te diz.. pois ELe fala .. a todos.. Amem    N?o comece um trabalho se voce nao tem certeza, pois se for um chamado de Deus Ele lhe dara a confirma??o necessaria e as provis?es... Mas se voce quer ou tem um desejo no cora??o de miss?es ore que voce tera a revela??o.. com certeza..       Jesus.. Voce  lindo.. Maravilhoso.. Tu s bem vindo em nossas vidas..

Foi ela quem lhe ensinou a n?o ter medo de Deus, por acreditar que todos os homens podem ter uma rela??o pessoal de amizade e respeito com Ele.    A cren?a da m?e o intrigava, j que ela nunca ia  igreja. Curioso, Neale perguntou como ela podia ter f sem freqentar a igreja. A reposta iria mudar para sempre sua vida: "N?o preciso ir at l para encontrar com Deus. Ele est dentro de mim e est comigo aonde quer que eu v."     Essa nova vis?o a respeito de Deus fez Neale criar, anos mais tarde, junto com a esposa Nancy, a ReCreation, uma organiza??o religiosa que tem como objetivo promover o crescimento pessoal e espiritual das pessoas.    Walsch d conferncias e promove seminrios por todo o mundo para divulgar e debater as mensagens contidas em suas obras de maior sucesso, Conversando com Deus e Uma Amizade com Deus. Seus livros j foram traduzidos para 27 lnguas, inspiraram milh?es de leitores e ajudaram muita gente a promover significativas mudan?as no seu dia-a-dia. O autor mora atualmente com a mulher no sul do Oregon, nos Estados Unidos."

Throughout recorded history, prostitution-the buying and selling of sexual services and favors-has been a part of the human condition. Evidence of it is found in mythology, art, sculpture, drama, literature, music, and archaeological structures and ruins. Societies in different parts of the world and in different eras have dealt with it in diverse ways across a broad spectrum, with its acceptance as a norm at one extreme, to its criminalization at the other.     Although we don't know when the Old Testament book of Deuteronomy was written, its condemnation of raising money for the temple by "whores" and "sodomites" (23:17-18) confirms the practice in early Hebrew history. Several other Old Testament verses (I Kings 14:24, and 15:12; II Kings 23:7) show the practice was widespread in the seventh century BCE.    Prostitution, has been present in every culture and every period of history. Sacred prostitution, at one time practiced by hierodouloi in the temples of Babylon, Canaan, Syria, Phoenicia, Asia Minor, Armenia, Greece and elsewhere, may have derived from the worship of Mother Earth and fertility. But there was always an air of sensuality mixed with profit associated with the practice, even when "higher motives" were professed.

A traducao ao pe da letra seria "a big kiss for you", mas isso nao existe em ingles. Se voce disser isso a alguem que nao fala portugues, a pessoa vai achar super esquisito. Carinho e' "affection", mas "thanks for the affection" tambem nao e' usado.     "Oi amiga" e' muito usado em portugues, mas "Hi friend" nao tem o mesmo sentido em ingles. Seria melhor colocar "Hey girl", por exemplo.    Nao sei exatamente em que contexto voce esta usando a palavra "carinho" (porque ela mostrou que se importa com voce? porque ela te mandou um presente? uma carta? por que ela foi te visitar?). A traducao de "obrigada pelo carinho" depende muito do contexto.    Eu traduziria assim:    Hey girl,    thanks for ...(por ex.) your letter/the present you gave me/coming over to visit (ai vai depender do que ela fez pra voce).    Love,    (seu nome)  .........................................    "Love" e' muito usado no fim de cartas/emails para amigos/familia. Assim como seria estranho traduzir "love" e escrever "amor" no fim de uma carta em portugues, e' estranho traduzir um grande beijo pra voce como "a big kiss for you". Escreva somente "love".    Sei que parece que eu mudei tudo mas em traducao o mais importante nao e' traduzir palavras ao pe da letra e, sim, passar a mensagem original com seu sentido original, mesmo que isso implique mudancas de palavras.    Espero ter ajudado ;)|`|807896964b6a149310aa786e3a57e292aa	Hi girlfriend, thanks for your kindness, big hug and kisses.    O "girlfriend" nao quer dizer que ela eh uma namorada, mas uma amiga.

1a4adc3c7dac039d886c78b4afcbff75aa	Hi.. Thanks for asking this..Let me try to answer this..    Jainism, is not a religion. The most famous phrase among Jains is "Jinendra" ( Jin + Indra) means one who can contol his intriyas(senses).. Any person who can control his/her senses for a good reason is a real Jain.. Jainism was not originated like other religions with one originator and all descendents were called to be in that religion.. Many people from different castes found Jain principles as their motive of life and came in Jain.. that;s why when you see around in jain subcastes.. you will see all major castes of Hindu religion like Joshi, agarwal, jangid.. they all are subcastes of jainism..     As I said.. Jainism is all about controlling your senses(surely for good of others). thats why.. principles becomes very difficult like tela(not eating for three continous days) or maskhaman(not eating for one month) and etc. etc.     One big difference.. most of jain castes do not worship GOD.. they have tirthankars.. they are not God with epics. they were human who setup example by following tough principles.. Rishabnath was first among them and Mahaveer was last till now.. I believe it is high time for 26th tirthankar who can teach these principles to the world again. Hope to see that happening soon..    also. it look so sad these days that most of Jains do not even know abt these principles.. Jainism which began as philosophy has became a religion now.. a religion with all those binding and rules..     Bye.. Have a nice time..

(Sal. 40:4; 34:8; 112:1; 119:1, 2) Deus quer sinceramente oferecer-nos o seu amor e entrar numa rela??o conosco. Mostramos compativelmente que prezamos a rela??o com ele?  Rom. 8:38, 39.    FELICIDADE  DE OUVIR E FAZER    13 Certa vez, uma mulher que ouvira Jesus ensinar exclamou: Feliz  a madre que te carregou e os peitos em que mamaste! (Luc. 11:27)  provvel que ela se apercebesse de que a Bblia enaltece a maternidade, e parece que ela achava que Maria era bendita ou podia ser especialmente feliz de que seu filho Jesus era um instrutor t?o excelente e justo. Mas Jesus sabia que existia uma felicidade maior do que a da paternidade ou da maternidade, mesmo a maternidade relacionada com o Messias. Ele respondeu: N?o, antes: Felizes s?o os que ouvem a palavra de Deus e a guardam!  Luc. 11:28.    14 Note a nfase que Jesus colocou em envolver-se em  ouvir ou ler  a palavra de Deus. A Bblia assegura-nos repetidas vezes o proveito que h em estar ocupado com a Palavra de Deus. O primeiro Salmo diz sobre o homem feliz: Seu agrado  na lei de Jeov, e na sua lei ele l dia e noite em voz baixa. (Sal. 1:1, 2) De modo que podemos perguntar: Obtemos felicidade dessa fonte?    15 As Escrituras s?o como um repositrio de felicidade, porque enriquecem a mente e o cora??o. Animam o esprito. D?o esperan?a. Indicam o caminho para uma vida produtiva e agradvel. Contm os pensamentos de Deus, sobre os quais podemos refletir a qualquer hora. Constituem a base da verdadeira sabedoria.  Veja Provrbios 3:13-18.    16 S?o tantas as publica??es que poderamos ler: jornais, revistas, novelas, livros de histria, peridicos sobre o lar ou sobre algum ofcio. Embora algumas delas possam ser interessantes e ter seu valor, podemos perguntar-nos: Nos interesses da minha felicidade, posso ajustar o meu programa ou os meus hbitos de leitura para ler e usufruir mais a Palavra de Deus? De fato, l-la por puro prazer. Leia cada dia um trecho dela, se quiser, seguindo uma programa??o. Leia a Bblia na ordem consecutiva dos livros. Leia as Escrituras junto com valiosos compndios bblicos. Leia ocasionalmente textos de outra tradu??o ou em outra lngua, se falar mais de uma. Sim, a maior leitura da Palavra de Deus ser um passo em dire??o  felicidade.  Rev. 1:3.

Also, MANY MANY MANY people have made up signs that they call "Baby Signs" or whatever else and called it a sign system and then marketed it. Why people can't use REAL ASL signs with their baby is beyond me but....Make sure what you are using is real ASL, especially if you are marketing your services as such. Tons of fake sign systems have been made up and used by select hearing people, hence the other poster's and my hesitation. I hope you really looked into being more educated about the language system you are using the the community that NATIVELY uses it.     All that said, to answer your question, because I believe education is important, there is a proper way to sign your self introduction in ASL. It STARTS with I-NAME or MY-NAME and then you spell your name, followed by a name sign, IF a deaf person has given you one. You then expand MUCH more on your background, where you were born, raised, went to school, what you do, what deaf/hearing relatives you have, and your involvement with the deaf community. In ASL and the deaf community, that's how it works.     Also, you mentioned it seeming easier to have name signs within families. While family members do have name signs, if a person in the room, you do not use their name sign when referring to them, you point to them. If you want someone's attention, signing their name isn't how you get it, a wave of the hand, a flickering of a light, or a tap on the shoulder is what does it. The only time you use a name sign is when that person is not present OR in introducing them for the first time to a new person.     Hope this information helps, feel free to ask me whatever else you like, good luck!|`|daad4ad1148c32b623cb3874463188a3aa	you have no right "pitching" your signing services if you do not enough know enough of the basics to know how introductions are done.  you are trying to make money off of Deaf people's language, instead of respecting it for what it is.  it is common for Deaf people to have a name sign that is granted to them by Deaf peers or Deaf family members.  some hearing people are given name signs if they are active and involved in the Deaf community and knowledgeable and respectful of Deaf culture.  You cannot make one up for yourself.

dc7e4a8d7d559fbcdf04fa5a73648e24aa	in my experience it is difficult to learn sign language from a web site. much better to find a class if you can or find deaf/hard of hearing groups.  Classes can be expensive depending on where you live.  however try putting in B.S.L. for u.k. or A.S.L.  for american sign lang.  good luck!!its great to learn in a group if possible.  Fascinating language!!|`|00bade83214d600796659d1fae7137ebaa	I agree with the previous poster that, just like with any language, it is much better to learn from users of the language, particularly native speakers, than from a book or video or whatever else.     Also, to clarify, sign language is not a verb. You can't "sign language." You can learn to sign, you can sign, but you can't "sign language."    Good luck with your adventures in sign, hope you enjoy them!|`|bd6b97de00c02c1080aaa6d8becf30f4aa	The good websites to learn sign language are;  1 http://lifeprint.com/ (this site will teach you how to use your hands to do the sign language plus pictures)  2 http://images.google.com/images?q  3 http://signlanguage.com/  4 http://handspeak.com/  5 http://funbrain.com/signs/  6 http://lessontutor.com/ASLgenhome.html  7 http://aslbrowser.commtechlab.msu.edu/  8 http://www.mastertech-home.com/ASDLDict....  9 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sign_langua...  10 http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/as/web/...

Mal ganz abgesehen vom leckeren Essen aus aller Welt, was w?re mit Musik und Kultur? Und die Wirtschaft wrde ohnehin zusammenbrechen - von ?rzten bis Strassenfegern. Ne ne, das wrde ich nicht wollen!|`|709ebbbe703b4703dd76619284b5e009aa	Kein Mensch auf der ganzen Welt (also nicht nur in Deutschland!) der bei Verstand ist wrde jemals einen solchen Knopf drcken, denn dann wrden wirklich berall alle Menschen verschwinden.

Und wenn daneben dann noch ein Knopf ist, der in allen Gehirnen solche kranken Anteile auf dauer heilt, w?re ich einer der zufriedensten Menschen dieser Erde - logisch, dass ich sie schon beide gedrckt h?tte!|`|6bc3ecca9ed8606a2e7fc9aaa775afe0aa	Da msste ich ja ziemlich d?mlich sein, wenn ich sowas t?te. Nicht nur, dass die Gesellschaft und die Wirtschaft nur funktionieren, weil wir viele Ausl?nder hier haben, ich finde darber hinaus den multi-kulti Mix letztendlich extrem bereichernd fr die kulturelle Entwicklung in unserem Land. Natrlich ver?ndert sich dadurch die sogenannte "deutsche Kultur", aber wer sagt denn, dass diese Ver?nderung zum Negativen ist?  Wenn es jedoch einen Knopf g?be, durch den alles faschistische aus Deutschland verschwinden wrde, dann w?re ich eher versucht, diesen zu drcken.|`|87a0b39464778f880f1d577d171f3234aa	Na, lieber nicht.

3cfee8a3f78cb29bffba26e15e362e27aa	Well...  Actually Both and None are the National Anthem.  Let me explain...      "Das Lied der Deutschen" also known as "Das Deutschlandlied"  dates back to 1841.  The lyrics to this song has a first verse as follows.    Deutschland, Deutschland ber alles,  ber alles in der Welt,  wenn es stets zu Schutz und Trutze  brderlich zusammen h?lt.  Von der Maas bis an die Memel, von der   Etsch bis an den Belt.  Deutschland, Deutschland ber alles,  ber alles in der Welt.    The song was chosen as the official national anthem in 1922.  When the Nazi party came to power, they used only  the first verse followed immediately by the Horst-Wessel-Lied.     In 1952, The West German Government adopted the 3rd Stanza of the Deutschland lied as the national anthem, which to this day is the national anthem.  The lyrics are as follows    Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit  fr das deutsche Vaterland!  Danach la?t uns alle streben  brderlich mit Herz und Hand!  Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit  sind des Glckes Unterpfand;   |: Blh im Glanze dieses Glckes,    blhe, deutsches Vaterland. :|    Hope that clears up the question.|`|6f3667633ddf4660fde8e5be1abb9919aa	Lilli Marlen.  Deutschland ber alles ist verbotten!|`|2721c496cbe0b16058dd456cc602400baa	Our anthem is called:  "Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit"|`|4OpKummOaa	They are from the same song...just different verses.  The first verse (Deutschland Uber alles) was used by the Nazi party.  It is officially outlawed in Germany today.  They use the 3rd verse instead (Deutschland lied).
