My dad wasn't one for saying that very often, and I'll never forget it or the look on his face and in his eyes when he said it. He passed away a few months later. <br>  With my mon it was  just the times we would go shopping and spend the whole day together we'd go out to eat window shop and talk. She was my best friend and I miss her terribly. I think that when you loose some one it's the little things that really mean the most and they are the things you miss the most. I suppose it really doesn't have anything to do with the fact that they were my adoptive parents, just moments that really stand out and are precious to me.<br>   Crap now it made  me cry just thinking bout them.|`|j0xfBk5Caa	With my son it's a toss up between the day he came home from the NICU and I was able to really hold and nurse him without all the people and noise and the last time I saw him. The last time I saw him he'd had his first haircut, I missed it and it made me so sad but he looked like such a little man and was so proud as he strutted around my parents home showing off and giving out the most amazing hugs and kisses. <br>  <br>  With my amom it was a bunch of times, Lemon Chicken for dinner day at the hospital. She would have the nurses bring an extra dinner tray for me and we would sit around eating dinner and chatting then do some kind of craft after, usually make jewellery or paint ceramics or something like that. <br>  <br>  With my adad it was the year that we worked together. We both got to see each other as people, instead of just father and daughter. <br>  <br>  For my nmom it was the day we met. MY FACE! There it was, right in front of me! My face, looking back at me, smiling, loving me. I waited my whole life to see that face and to feel those arms around me. <br>  <br>  Ndad is a bittersweet moment. It was the first time we met as we said goodbye. He hugged me and held me close and told me he loved me. He was crying openly, I saw the pain in his eyes of 25 missed years but I also saw pride and love that only a father can feel.|`|9Ng5sqpnaa	the most treasured moment for me was my reunion with my son. i found him when he was 21. <br>  it was so deeply primal and emotional for us both and i will treasure that moment until the day I die.|`|hzgFAJv0aa	Dear Opedial,<br>  <br>  I have one moment with each of my children that I hold on to the most and gives me the most comfort.<br>  <br>  For my son, it was the first time he called me "MamaKate". I spent the first four weeks after he was born with him and his APs, two weeks at my house and two weeks at theirs.) We shared almost weekly phone calls for the first three years of his life and he was pretty used to hearing my voice and thing were still very open. D. talked to him about me often and I was a regular presence in his life. He was just learning to talk and beginning to string together words to make actual sentences. (I remember being SO proud!) Anyway, we were on the phone during one of our regular calls and D. put him on the phone. He was so cute that at one point I couldn't help but cry just a little. (Not anything histrionic or anything, just that tight feeling in your throat that makes it hard to talk right and that quiver that your voice takes on when you're trying to keep it together until you CAN cry.) <br>  <br>  He was telling me about something having to do with their dog but his words were still a little hard to understand. I was trying to ask him about it and he interrupted me and said as clear as a bell, "Don't cry, MamaKate...I love you." <br>  <br>  With my daughter, I didn't have the opportunity to have much of a closeness with her. Our "open" adoption closed right after the finalization of her adoption. I also had less time with her physically as I did with her brother.  D. had been living with us for a few weeks prior to her delivery since we're in NC and they're in CA but after we came home from the hospital she stayed with my parent's came during the day for one week before she took "our" daughter to be with her brother. <br>  <br>  There was one night during that week when our daughter had woken up at about 3:30 am. My husband and I had agreed to wake each other up for every feeding because we knew there would only be so many. We fed her and my husband went back to bed but I stayed up with her and rocked her to sleep in my arms, staring at her sweet little face and smelling her baby scent. She was wrapped in a white blanket (I still have it.) and I had a blue light bulb in a lamp and it was the only light in the room and she looked like a little angel sleeping on a cloud. So peaceful and sweet. I stared at her and held her next to my heart for at least an hour before I put her back in the cradle.<br>  <br>  I know that neither of them will conscientiously remember these moments but they are precious to me.|`|E7MgO2pZaa	One of my most treasured moments with my amom happened not too long ago when she told me she was really proud of me. To have her be proud of me and respect me was a great moment that I will always remember.<br>  <br>  I also treasure the little things from when I was growing up. My mom singing "You are my sunshine" to me and my little sister, dancing with me around the living room, and reading us bedtime stories. Those are the things that make it easier to forgive her for some of the mistakes she made a little later on. I can see in those moments how much she really did love me even though at times I don't think she knew how or what to do with me.<br>  <br>  I don't know my first parents yet, but I hope they are out there somewhere waiting for me. I hope they are thinking about me just as much as I think about them. Just to know them, to meet them would be enough for a lifetime. And isn't that sad? That I am so desperate to know the people I should have been with my entire life that a moment or two would suffice?<br>  <br>  I guess a moment or two is better than nothing, but still!|`|29f92985b9fb483985c8c89cbc7a99b3aa	My most treasured memory with my son is his first concert at school! It was awesome to see him up there dancing and singing his little heart out.<br>  My most treasured memory with my daughter is when she asked me to tell her a secret and when I did the first thing she said was "boy mommy am I ever goin to let you down" and then proceeded to run thru the house screamin the secret at the top of her lungs lol.<br>  <br>  I guess neither of these memories have anything to do with their adoption.|`|993127072b7a2a0e8c555efdb241a674aa	bmom...lori and my brothers came to stay with me over the week of new years. the first time we have ever slept under the same roof in my life. we were getting ready to go somewhere and we were both in the mirror, side by side putting our makeup on. so stupid, so simple, so amazing. <br>  <br>  amom...the day she called and asked to meet lori. that was the day i felt she was starting to 'get it'. that she was accepting me for just being me. <br>  <br>  yup, these moments have everything to do with adoption. but i have plenty of other special times with each of them that has nothing to do with it. those are just the ones that stick out in my mind.|`|NoUkTQCgaa	The day I got married, and when I first spoke to my n Mom & when I met my n siblings. <br>   <br>  **ETA*** my wedding day, because it was a very emotional day, and the most beautiful day of my life. I guess that sort of sounded mean, lol. I didnt mean it to sound like, "K, thx bye!"|`|frpCK0utaa	when my amom took me and my twin brother to see Cinderella when it was rereleased in theaters when i was 6. I always remember that as a very special day, cuz she took us out to mcdonalds afterwards.<br>  <br>  A year later she lost her eyesight. i just remember it as one of the last days we had with her before that.<br>  <br>  Doesnt really have anything to do with adoption.|`|JP04HX6maa	When my mom made the effort to communicate over the microphone to my Baba.<br>  <br>  And when my Mama tried to say "I need you" in English.|`|xKSr1ld8aa	I have three most treasured moments:<br>  <br>  1.  Cuddling my son in hospital.<br>  2.  Finding him via the internet.<br>  3.  Hugging him the first time we met.|`|aed5cad075214254f2f176a51206a7d7aa	It was about 11 months ago when I dialled a phone number and asked for XXXXXXX and hearing my Momma say "this is she"|`|LIGYejglaa	It wasn't anything relating to their adoption, but one day my youngest twins decided they wanted to throw me a surprise party because I was working too much, they said. They baked me the most disgusting cake I have ever eaten, they misspelled "ima" (they are just learning how to write in Hebrew), and they made a big mess in the kitchen. <br>  <br>  We took the chairs from the dining room, set them up in front of the TV, got some pillows and blankets, made a fort, and watched cartoons while eating their disgusting cake - gummy bears, candy canes, Jolly Ranchers, all in brownie mix, topped with frosting from a can. I think it was one of the best days we have ever spent together.|`|HtiVTA0jaa	I don't have any most treasured moment with my (adoptive) parents.  They are my parents.  I think it would be just as difficult if you asked non-adopted children to name their most treasured moment with their parents.|`|ioNKVW9haa	My most treasured moment with my A-Mom is actually a series of memories... it's every time she ever said the words 'I'm proud of you.'  She only says it when she REALLY means it so I've only heard it maybe 8 times in my life.  Things like high school graduation, the times our band took state because I worked hard and saw it through, and most recently when I brought home a copy of a 3.56 GPA my first semester back in college.  <br>  <br>  With my A-dad, my most treasured moments is a series of them as well... The best times I've ever had with my a-dad is on his sailboat during the summers... when we take two or three weeks out of the summer to sail to our vacation spot north of here and back... because on those trips, we always get along... and we're friends.<br>  <br>  My f-mom... well, I don't really talk to her at all anymore... but I'll never forget the first time I heard her voice on the phone... and I'll never forget when she walked through the door of the coffee shop we met at.  We sat and talked for 4 hours straight.  <br>  <br>  My f-dad - I haven't gotten much of a chance to make too many memories with him.  I only met him for four hours a few months ago.  But I'll never forget that first hug.  Or the small sentimental gift he gave me.  I always look forward to his phone calls and the e-mails from him and his wife.<br>  But the most treasured?  The first time his wife M looked me straight in the eyes and said "You're family."<br>  <br>  A lot of people who aren't adopted just don't get it.  I am NOT replacing my parents!  I'm just adding to my family.  I love them all.  There are the parents who raised me, dealt with all of my crap, kissed my scrapes and bruises, and tucked me in to bed at night... then there are the parents who made me, who share more than my genetic material... they share my biological past, my blood, my features, even the same personality and quirks that I have.<br>  <br>  I have to say, the most important thing is that I can count on my a-mum, a-dad, and f-dad for support and love.  So really, choosing just one moment to treasure seems kind of difficult. :)|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	I have 2 moments that stay with me, the first time I heard my bdaughters voice on the phone and I thought, that is my voice, the other time is the first time we met in person and I heard my voice first and then there she was, my beautiful daughter.

KKGt03xlaa	I got pregnant with my 1st daughter on my 3rd round of Clomid. <br>  2 years later I got pregnant with my twins on my first round! <br>  I am from Canada and the majority of it was covered under my health plan. <br>  I have PCOS and was put on it after 6 months of trying to conceive. <br>  I didn't have any side affects from the meds - except maybe some nausea and breast tenderness.<br>  GOOD LUCK! Please keep me posted with how it goes for you|`|lzcglDnMaa	I am on my 4th round of clomid. I go Monday for my scan to see if it worked. If it didn't I have to start injections of fsh. The clomid should work for you. Do you have insurance? Have you checked to see what all it might cover? I know that my insurance will cover some fertility treatments. I am seeing a fertility specialists and my insurance has covered a lot of it. Go ahead and do the clomid for the 4 months and start praying that it works. I would tell you to buy ovulation strips, but the first response ones will give you a false reading everyday. At least they do with me. They say I have been ovulating for 3 weeks now. I have heard that if you buy the clear blue fertility monitor it will give you a more accurate reading. I guess the best tips I can give you is to chart your temp at the same time every morning and check your cm. The clomid can dry it up. so make sure you drink plenty of water. Good luck to you in your ttc journey.
QbJ04Zqiaa	It totally depends on the kids. I don't think there is any one answer to that question.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	my daughter has always had close friends who are boys.  she had a co-ed sleepover when she turned 8.  when she turned 9, i still would have been okay with it but decided enough of her friends' parents wouldn't that we made it single-sex.  now that she's almost 10, i would not ask a boy to spend the night in the same room as her.  we sometimes have friends from out of town stay with us, including a boy her age, but they sleep in different rooms and we have both sets of parents here. <br>  <br>  By 11 ... I generally wouldn't.  puberty, in my mind, is time for that to stop.  i'm sure there are special-case exceptions, but i wouldn't do it as a general matter.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	No, not at 11. Too many kids are developing their first 'crushes' at this age. So no, I wouldn't allow it. They can play at each other's houses during the day all the want, but no sleepovers.|`|m2cxGTwgaa	This one is a toughy. Hopefully you have had the sex talk with your kid. If they have been friends this long, there is a good chance nothing will happen. Though children may be naive. I think if you trust the boy, and trust your daughter, let her go. just make sure to talk to her before she goes. she might be embarrased, but she will thank you for it.<br>  <br>  if you still dont feel comfortable, ask the parents for the kids to keep the door open, or have them check in a couple times a night. If you dont like that, then have the sleepover at your place.<br>  <br>  Iff all else is icky too you, then explain to your daughter and say no.|`|AA10943329	yes, we have that exact situation but they are turning 10 next week. They both sleep at each others places. One day he will have to sleep in the lounge but at the moment he still sleep in the same room. His twin sister goes to. She is his best friend. They have known each other since the day they were born and the parents are my kids God Parents.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	i'm gonna vote no on that.  my opinion for my kids.  i dont believe i would allow it.  that me and my house...|`|kaqPSgTVaa	That one is tricky. I think it depends on your daughter, the boy, his parents, and how open you are with your daughter.|`|rhPCJfeuaa	That's a tough age.  They're just starting to think about the opposite sex in a different way than before.  And, they obviously really care about each other and know each other well.  It's not a far cry from that to feelings of love and affection.  Basically, it's like dangling candy in front of a child.  Why risk it?  I might let her go over for a late night with parent supervision and then go get her.  There are plenty of hours during the day for visits and hanging out.  Don't see the need for overnight.  Too Dawson's Creek for me.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	As long as they arent sleeping in the same room then I dont see a problem with it. I would prefer if it was at my house if I had a daughter. My friends mom would let her friends that were guys sleep over they slept on the couch and me and my friend slept in the bed with her and she locked the door lol we were 14 and 15.|`|45nSn7Rcaa	I'd say it had to depend on the children in question, but my daughters were really getting interested in boys at that age so in their cases I would not have allowed it, but my son who is 9 now, I would let.|`|AA11097184	11 years is the age for girls when they start feeling the difference of the gender. The re is no problem if they sleep in different rooms or there are other members of the family in the same room.<br>  For child hood friends, this is normal.|`|35kVNi5oaa	Well, i guess it would be ok with parent supervision and slept in seperate rooms.|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	hard one i dont think i would have ever started them staying together for fear of this happening though|`|btYjw5wQaa	well if the boy is older dont let her i think boy/girl sleep overs should stop at six yrs and stat again at 16|`|NXhgosiUaa	I would say it's all up to how you view your daughter. If you trust her, and don't think that she would do something like that, then let her. If you don't think she's the kind of girl who would do something like that - which is really all up to you - let her.<br>  <br>  Ask her about it. If she reacts completely embarrassed, and says that she hadn't even thought about it - she's probably telling the truth, and you should let her. <br>  <br>  I don't think it's a big deal, it's all about trust.|`|TXB5wVlSaa	Personally, I would say no way.  I have a 12 year old daughter.  At this age, kids are becoming curious about things.  Not to say that they would attempt anything ... but I would think letting her sleep over at a boys house at this age would send the wrong signal that it's okay.  It may cause problems for you and her later as far as you allowing/not allowing her to do things with guy friends.|`|xVEqBjDVaa	No i would most definitely not let my daughter do that! I would say...make it a late night, let her stay until about 10:30 and then come get her.|`|In11WOTSaa	That seems fine;<br>  theve known each other for a long time.
Ka52nbhNaa	How long was the period of time between your egg retrieval and transfer?  Did you do a 3 day transfer or a blastocyst?<br>  <br>  We did an IVF cycle in December 2007 - I tested at 10 days past my transfer of 2 3-day 8 cell embryos and got a positive on a home pregnancy test . . . the twins are now just over 6 months old.  A handful and then some, but completely worth it!<br>  <br>  My first symptoms included slight cramping, tender breasts and extreme fatigue!<br>  <br>  Sending you loads of baby dust and sticky vibes!|`|ROVAg1vvaa	my sister also just went through ivf and got a positive blood result on the 10th of feb, but she never took a hpt. she just said she couldn't do it, it would hurt to much to see another negative result, after having so many before going through ivf. so now she is just about 8 weeks along with baby number 2, both ivf. good luck, i hope things work out for you|`|scdOdaTKaa	I don't have any experience with IVF i just wanted to say good luck and I will be praying for you.

AA11104372	This is something you need to let Paddlin' Peggy handle. If she's not home, take him down to Mega-lo-Mart, and buy him a Chuck Mangione CD.  Make him listen to it for three days straight.  That should do the trick.|`|AA12033653	Seriously!!??  Its not like it was X rated.

Like, most movies are rated PG13 because they have a few minor swear words in them, and maybe a scene with a couple kissing, but it's never anything more.<br>  <br>  Oh, and PG also stands for Parental Guidance. Aren't you the parent?|`|ohsZhXRmaa	If you specifically told your son not to watch PG13 movies, then explain to him why you don't want him to watch those movies. If not, don't worry about it.

p0NsUYkRaa	i just correct my childs behavior for example if he hits the cat i tell him we dont hit we pet then i will show him and then when he starts petting the cat i give him praise and i just keep at things like this, sometimes it can get frustrating but it works for us, and came most natural, i dont believe in time outs for them at this age because they are too little to really have that as an effective punishment and i just cant imagine hitting a child for something he/she doesnt know is wrong or hasnt been taught|`|0ky4TktEaa	Short of taking things when they cut up, there's really not much else you can do other than telling them not to do something. As someone who deals with children every day, all day, i assure you, you WILL change your mind about the spanking and time outs when you encounter some crazy behavior that talking about does nothing to change. Some parents just need to put up with stuff until they're fed up with it. By the way, hitting and spanking are two different things. Hitting implies that you are doing it without a particular reason; as a parent, that's not how you take care of things. Spanking implies "you did something wrong, i've asked you to stop, you didn't stop, now you get a punishment". Completely different things.|`|ZRv94Pdtaa	Guilt works the best. Make them soo guilty they will come say sorry to you and hug you. Or a regretful feeling. Those work great. <br>  <br>  Or the usual disappointed feeling, even you would remember that when you were a kid, from bad grades or something. But idk if that works as well as the guilt. Also, you are the mother. The kids are born with a physiological thing with the mother. And you can make them feel guilty easily.<br>  <br>  and you know how it goes, to not regret anything before you die. Maybe if they wrecked your car at 5 they will pay you back at 32.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	We use time out and loss of privileges for our 2 year old, it kind of depends on the situation but I have taken things away, removed him from an activity he was participating in (and wanted to stick with), or simply walked away from him when his behavior was out of control.   For hurting others I remove him and comfort the victim with lavish praise, as for destroying property - well it gets put away or removed or he looses it.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	I use time outs I know you didn't ask but the way you worded it makes it sound like you think time outs are wrong. My daughter has not been adversly effected, never screams, just sits and takes her punishment then goes on her merry way. We don't have any discipline issues with her. In fact we rarely have to even give her a time out. Time outs are perfectly safe and fine for children.<br>  <br>  ADD: OK. I was just confused and hoping you didn't feel that way. :) Sorry.

Baby needs a happy mom, which for me means NOT being away from baby as them I am very, very unhappy<br>  <br>  2) If you are going out for a couple of hours your baby isn't going to starve to death if they refuse to take a bottle.  You wouldn't wake your baby to nurse if they slept 8 or even 12 hours, so you don't have to force a baby to take a bottle while you are gone.  I'm not saying you shouldn't offer the baby breastmilk in a cup or bottle but its not the end of the world if they don't want one.  Of course if baby is screaming and miserable for the sitter you go home!<br>  <br>  3) Is it irresponsible to get drunk?  Its always irresponsible to drink past the point you are responsible and in control|`|2F5HNPqPaa	I think if you make it a habit (several times a week) then it's probably quite irresponsible.  When you have a baby, you make a conscious decision to sacrifice that lifestyle!<br>  <br>  On the other hand, if it's a one off or every now and then I don't see why not!  I'm 21 and have been out drinking twice since Lukas was born 6 months ago.  Everyone needs to let their hair down occasionally!|`|AA11476951	Yes. I think it's irresponsible. But if it's what you plan to do, wait till she is bottle fed and have her stay the night with someone. Don't try to take care of a baby while you are drunk/hungover. You could end up hurting her accidentally (stumbling etc.) or you may sleep through her crying.|`|YCJz2DiWaa	I was feeling like you did, and did go out and get drunk. BIG MISTAKE! Being hungover was completely unfair to my baby boy. I just wanted to sleep. Luckily my husband was around in the morning to pick up my slack, but then he had to go to work. It's not fun feeling sick with a baby who needs you. I feel so guilty.<br>  <br>  Edit: You should go out though. Go dancing and have fun, but don't make your goal...shot after shot after shot.|`|4d9uaAG8aa	No not at all... your social life shouldn't end when you have a baby. If you do feel guilty though then maybe you are not ready but remember that you have years ahead of you to continue your social life so start when you are ready!<br>  <br>  Babysitters (family/non family) were invented for a reason!!  Enjoy!|`|HXfHkoSHaa	I think it's actually good for a mom to get out once in a while.  A couple of hours just to be herself instead of mommy does a woman good.  Getting drunk?  Probably not the best idea.  How about dinner and a drink or two.  If there was an emergency and you couldn't handle it because you were drunk would torment you for a long time.|`|dnLL4J71aa	i do.<br>  suck it up and be responsible for the baby you decided to create.<br>  and just remember your baby doesnt care if you're hungover.|`|Mw8RehZOaa	if ur not breast feeding and can manage ur duties the next day then hell no<br>  <br>  you will need her minded overnight though, u woodnt be able to look after her during the nite if u were pist.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	We all need a night off sometimes no matter how old we are. As long as you have your baby in good care. Wait until she is bottle fed though and comfortable with it. It's no fun for the person trying to watch her if she is screaming the whole time because she would rather take the breast.<br>  <br>  Word of advice though it is NOT fun getting up in the morning with a baby when you have a hang over =/ Get someone to take her all night and keep her until the next day noonish.|`|IXBl5l5kaa	Personally I don't drink but if you want to drink with friends and get away, I totally recommend it. I wish I had done it more often in the early months and now I'm desperate for a night out. You need it to keep your sanity! <br>  <br>  Here is info on breastfeeding and alcohol so you don't have to panic so much :)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/health/lifestyle/alcohol.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/health/lifestyle...</a><br>  <br>  "Guidelines<br>  <br>      * Current research says that occasional use of alcohol (1-2 drinks) is not harmful to the nursing baby. The American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Drugs classifies alcohol (ethanol) as a “Maternal Medication Usually Compatible With Breastfeeding.”<br>      * Many experts recommend against drinking more than 1-2 drinks per week.<br>      * It is recommended that nursing moms avoid breastfeeding during and for 2-3 hours after drinking (Hale 2002).<br>      * There is no need to pump & dump milk after drinking alcohol, other than for mom's comfort -- pumping & dumping does not speed the elimination of alcohol from the milk.<br>      * Alcohol does not increase milk production, and has been shown to inhibit let-down and decrease milk production (see below).<br>      * If you're away from your baby, try to pump as often as baby usually nurses (this is to maintain milk supply, not because of the alcohol). At the very least, pump or hand express whenever you feel uncomfortably full - this will help you to avoid plugged ducts and mastitis.<br>  <br>  In general, if you are sober enough to drive, you are sober enough to breastfeed. Less than 2% of the alcohol consumed by the mother reaches her blood and milk. Alcohol peaks in mom's blood and milk approximately 1/2-1 hour after drinking (but there is considerable variation from person to person, depending upon how much food was eaten in the same time period, mom's body weight and percentage of body fat, etc.). Alcohol does not accumulate in breastmilk, but leaves the milk as it leaves the blood; so when your blood alcohol levels are back down, so are your milk alcohol levels."
3t9jZ89Oaa	Allergies are not contagious like a cold, but your baby has a higher percentage chance of developing them as she grows  since she shares your genetics.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	No they are not contagious, just frustrating and snotty.
AA12343985	I think it's great!  Go with what you want.  Your friends can name their own kids!|`|UbCzA2JVaa	It's really nice and unique! I like it.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  :)|`|AA11476951	Yes. I like it. Very similar to my sons name.|`|b77a399b601ebea9dfd2bbfd3203079caa	too much|`|dau2cKj1aa	when i hear the name PATTERSON i think of a fat girl no offense.i like the first and middle name|`|ROVAg1vvaa	its cute but also reminds me of a name of an appliance. sorry|`|Zaj3m6huaa	I love it!

5saz2WV0aa	I don't know if it is a tantrum but my son does the same thing. and he will only scream once. he cries when he has needs and stuff.. and when he screams at me he also has some sort of need but it seems as though he is angry he is not getting it.<br>  and if i take "too long" to get him what he needs like i am in the bathroom and he wants to get picked up.. then after i pick him up he will sob for a bit and forget he is sobbing and remember and sob again. Cutest thing ever :D|`|7rIAd6gGaa	A child that age doesn't throw tantrums. She is only trying to communicate what she needs in the only way she has. It's completely normal. Just try everything - diaper, food, pacifier, sleep, etc. She'll calm down once you figure out what it is she needs.<br>  <br>  At that age, my daughter would scream her head off every time she got tired. The only way I could get her to calm down and nap was to put her in the baby swing. I would never call it a tantrum though. She was just tired and couldn't fall asleep on her own.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|wK4kqhHkaa	yes how else is she suppose to tell you that she needs something.|`|3t9jZ89Oaa	Babies under 6 months old cannot manipulate and can't self soothe.  If she's screaming, she *needs* something - usually one of the big 3 - food, diaper, cuddle/rocking.  If you've tried all these and nothing works, there could be something wrong - colic, reflux, etc.|`|dnLL4J71aa	at that age she doesnt have wants, she only has needs, and as her parent it is your responsibility to give her what she needs, both physically and emotionally. i bet if you hold her close she'll stop screaming
9UCvu7RYaa	Children's sleep habits depend on your routine that you establish. My children had a pretty set schedule; I noticed  that from ages 8mos - 1 1/2 (my twins and my son) all needed an AM nap (which was 30mins - 1hour) then a PM nap (which was longer maybe from 12:30- 2 or 3; Depending on how busy our day was).  Bedtime is between 8-8:30 (Now that my son is 10yrs his bedtime is a little different because of homework and projects)<br>  <br>  As they got older they didn't need as much sleep. I noticed that around 2yrs they had outgrown the AM naps, but still need the PM naps until age 4 -5.  <br>  <br>  So, Yes, sleep habits change. You have to determine what fits your child because some children need the PM nap, but if its longer than an hour they have a hard time sleeping at night. But my children were pretty busy during the day so their schedule was what they needed because they were so tired by the end of the day.|`|117abff9116e3a46733b70216ee24e7aaa	my 2 yr old still taked a nap there so busy they need naps or there crabby. Keep them on a schedule if u can. Kaylei takes a nap between 12 and 1 and then she goes to bed at 9 or 10. She wakes up about 8. Yes I have it very good shes great!!!!!!!!!!!
1MEnCmwoaa	you can either start with the newborn diapers or size one. it is all based on the babies weight. I like huggies the best, i started out using pampers but the netting was always getting stuck to my daughter and causing diaper rashes so i switched to huggies. <br>  as far as clothes, depending on when the baby is due, you need blanket sleepers with the feet, onesies, sleep sacks are great for night. anything comfy really. gowns are good the first few months before they can roll around, then they get all bunched up and it is annoying. socks and caps.|`|qImMwhUHaa	In my opinion, when they are newborn, it doesn't really matter. I normally get the less expensive brand because you have to change them so often,  If you have a problem with them leaking then I would try a more expensive brand.  I never kept my children overdressed like I think some mothers/fathers do. A onsie and swaddled in a light receiving blanket with a hat should be just fine unless you are going outside or the home is very cool.|`|TXB5wVlSaa	I'm a huggies mom all the way ... but that's just what has worked best for my kids.  It depends on the kids and how rhey are shaped.  Some brands fit better, some of the cheaper brands leak.  And with my son ... I had a problem using anything like pampers because the perfume broke his skin out.  Try different ones and see what works best.  Sizes are based on weight which is listed on the package.<br>  <br>  And yes, you need to keep your baby warm ... but if it's warm outside, don't overdo it.|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	pampers swaddlers worked well for me|`|YSASNCuIaa	AHHH that's women's work I tell ya what|`|wiAVa1H5aa	You put the same amount of clothes on them that you are wearing, if you are unsure of their body temp their neck will tell you if they are too warm or too hot if you feel it.   Type of clothes varies by the season, more or less coverage depending on what season it is - babies can get overheated easily and hypothermic easily when they are new.<br>  <br>  Diapers?   Whatever you have, Huggies and Pampers are equivalent, and now Costco carries little diapers and for our two babies they were better then Huggies and equivalent to Pampers in function for a better price.|`|f55619778e2c4f36156e3d1508aa6431aa	A lot of parents like the pampers swaddlers but newborns have small bladders and usually don't pee a lot at one time.    Almost any diaper brand will work alright.    The size is usually newborn but if your baby is over 8 pounds then you may start with a size 1. <br>  <br>  As for the dressing warm dilemma.....I have a different opinion on that one.    Got a little story for ya.<br>  <br>  Back in the early 1990s, when my oldest was a newborn I was taking about a 45 minute drive with him.    It was chilly outside before I got in the car.   I was wearing a light jacket that was unbuttoned.    My baby was wearing an oversized winter coat that was unzipped.   He was also wearing a one piece sleeper pajamas (thinner fabric) with a onesie Tshirt underneath.     The weather was getting warmer as I drove.   My air condtioner was broken so I rolled down the windows.   I was a little warm but not sweating.    I was wondering how my baby was doing in the backseat but I couldn't see his face with his car seat facing backward.   I told myself that he he is only dressed a little warmer than me since he had a winter jacket and I had a light jacket on.   My baby had been sleeping throughout the the ride.   I decided to pull over to see how he was doing.    I went to the backseat and I noticed he was soaked in sweat.   I was horrified.   He was only a week old.   I took the coat off, opened up his pajamas (to cool him off) and I fed him.   I took him outside the car to get a breeze.   I decide to leave him in only pajamas.   I also decided that I would dress my baby according to how I was dressed.   A couple of times  when he was an older baby I was told by parents that he should be dressed warmer.   Everybody has a different opinion.   My baby was awake and happy.   His feet and hands weren't cold so he was fine as far as I was concerned.   If you think he may be cold then check his hands and feet.   Younger babies don't shiver when cold  so you can't judge by that .  If you think he may be hot then check if he is sweating.   The head always seems to sweat the most in my experience.<br>  <br>  ETA:   My second son didn't sweat as easily as my first son so it's best to just keep checking the baby's skin.<br>  <br>  Here's a question somebody else asked regarding babies and shivering.   The answers seem to vary.<br>  <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090212082201AAFsYwv">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a><br>  <br>  My own babies were at least 6 months before I saw them shiver.
3OP1YIXCaa	As many Bio-type classes as possible such as micro-bio, genetics, gene-discovery, etc.. Some good math classes (science and math go hand in hand)|`|YNd65b3kaa	Chemistry, biology, physics for sure and zoology if it's offered.|`|ysvOGwVHaa	A good way to get the specifics on something like this would be to contact a college or university directly and speak with a guidance counselor...or even a counselor right there at your own high school. They can help steer you in the right direction and answer any details you might also wonder about.
RxhBUkwSaa	No one is being very helpful or supportive, are they?<br>  <br>  There isn't a legal limit on the amount.  However there are emotional and physical implications from carelessness.   I am not judging you, but you need to protect yourself from emotional hurt, and your body from physical abuse, better than you've done.<br>  <br>  Please go see a counselor at Planned Parenthood.  They can help with the abortion if you decide to get one, but also help you explore your options.  And, most importantly, they can help with a plan to prevent future unwanted pregnancies that doesn't involve pennies or going to hell.  <br>  <br>  Take care of yourself!|`|A5ctEDmvaa	If you can have 1 abortion in your state I really doubt they would limit the number you're allowed to have.<br>  <br>  There is a risk that you can damage your body in a way that will make it harder to get pregnant in the future, among other risks. <br>  <br>  I would definitely talk to a doctor about the complications that go along with abortions. Make the appointment right away. You don't have to decide what to do at the appointment. This question is complicated and the answer will definitely require knowledge of your specific medical history (stuff you know but need to share with a doctor).<br>  <br>  No judgment here, just sound advice.<br>  <br>  As a bit of dark humor, yes there is a limit. One per pregnancy. (In case you need to lighten your mood just a little).|`|ATBHG0ztaa	No. There isn't. They will ask how many you've had, but it won't affect their decision.<br>  <br>  Save yourself some money though and use condoms. Not judging, it's just cheaper.|`|AA10621971	Maybe we know the same woman. I also know someone who's had at least 12.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	Legally there is no limit.

But since your mother is condescending and goes against your parental decisions, bringing her in to care for your child is just setting your family up for LOTS of trouble. For her to come and care for your daughter will cause you more stress in the long run. More stress in the childcare area also brings more stress to a marriage. It is not a good idea.

If you don't want your mom here, don't bring her here. You'll be just fine without her.|`|AA11104372	Why on Earth did you decide to have a child, only to be away for twelve hours a day?  Your child needs you.  Not a meddling grandmother.  Not a day-orphanage.  Find a way to stay home with your child until she starts school.  You won't regret it.

Call a clinic and ask. Most places won't do abortions that late.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	wow your sick, sorry but if you wanted an abortion you should have gotten one when you first found out, im only 11 weeks and my baby moves and kicks its legs and arms, i was watchin it on the ultrasound screen the other day. Your looking at a few grand easy, some people wont do abortions that late.<br>  <br>  may I ask why you want an abortion? and why have you waited so long?<br>  <br>  here: dont worry its not pro-life crap or graphic<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDvgfenRSM&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDvgfenR...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  as far as abortion is concerned i am both pro-life and pro-choice it all depends on the situation, abortion is ok in medical cases and rape but if you willingly had sex and fell pregnant i believe you should be adult enough to deal with it, but once you find out your pregnant, you should get right on the phone and schedual an abortion not wait until the baby is far enough alone to have feelings and brain function, move and kick, suck its thumb, organs are functioning, you can even tell the sex of the baby. At least be humane about it, the baby wont get any pain medication you know, it will feel everything. Like i said if you want an abortion fine, but be humane about it and thats doing it as soon as you find out. That is something  you just dont wait with|`|i8Ch743Laa	The only way you will know is to call and ask. People need to stop with the crap about oh no don't do it,as I do understand that,but it's YOUR choice. I don't know about time periods when they do them,I'd call and get info on it. I wish you the best,and I hope your decision doesn't end up being one you'd regret. It is your choice,and these people are being too judgemental about it.|`|5H5iQfW4aa	YOUR UNBORN BABY HAS A HEARTBEAT!!!! 12 WEEKS THEY HAVE A HEART BEAT SO YOUUU BETTER THINK TWICE THATS MURDER|`|AA11476951	It will cost you a whole life of regret.|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	Most places won't do it after 12 weeks thank goodness. Have you ever watched the video Silent Scream? You can watch it on YouTube. It is that of a 12 week old fetus being aborted. It is visibly dodging the burning chemicals and it's mouth opens in pain as the chemicals hit it as it dies. Pretty horrible. In about 2-3 weeks, you will be able to feel your baby moving. How could you do that? As if early abortion wasn't bad enough, during a later abortion they insert a needle into the uterus and kill the baby with chemicals. They then dilate you and suck the baby out of your uterus in pieces and throw it in the garbage. No human being deserves that.|`|PLbmKNpvaa	In answer to the question about getting thumbs down for a response... I don't know about anyone else but I give thumbs up or down depending on how well someone answers a question. <br>  If you have answered by telling someone what you think of the decision to have an abortion rather than answering their actual question, that would get a thumbs down not because I think your opinion is wrong, but because you haven't answered the question.<br>  <br>  I know that this is a topic that a lot of people have very heated opinions about (rightly so!) but not answering her question makes it a pretty useless answer.<br>  <br>  OP - (sorry to hijack your question) As for how much it costs... I'm unsure but I was lead to believe that you can't have an abortion that late in most states. I would contact your healthcare provider as they can probably point you in the direction of people who could give you the correct information.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	I have heard that they are high I think between 300-700 dollars??

It can hear your voice and see light. What in your life is so bad that you have to abort a perfect little baby?

AA12145826	Its not like you dirtied it and left it that way so that you could clean it right when they came, right? They should understand that things like this just *need* to be done sometimes, regardless if there is "company" coming or not. If anything it was rude of them to come visit on the day you planned to clean....*giggles*<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work, say you have a friend in Ohio who has a major crisis you have to fix, and I'll be on here waiting for ya (avoiding my own MIL.....LoL)|`|IU4uNH97aa	Why don't you clean the fridge now ?<br>  <br>  I think since they came today and you cleaned maybe you should spend some time with them and clean the fridge today or another day. I think it was kind of rude for you to clean especially  if they don't come by often but if they do it shouldn't matter.|`|rhPCJfeuaa	Depends on how your husband would feel.   I want to say if they are rude to you, I would say clean away.  But, if it makes your husband upset and stresses him out, I would say save it for another time.  Who cares how they feel?!  I would care about my husband's feelings, though.|`|DQkDQraOaa	It sounds like you don't care for the in-laws, lol. But considering that they are the reason your husband even exists, and must have done something right in raising him to be the man that you love, I would try really hard to be a bit more welcoming to them while they are there. It won't kill you, and might begin a better relationship with them. I'm sure that your husband will appreciate it. Good luck. :)|`|1MEnCmwoaa	i think it is rude! it isn't like it would be the end of the world for you to sit and visit with them. plus, if you do it again then it might cause issues and make everyone feel awkward and that just wouldn't be fair to make your husband feel weird about having his parents over.|`|1VdgsZPoaa	The fridge is in an open area though my love, where they can still converse.  I think I hear a closet calling your name.  Those things get so messy and you just now have the time am I right?  Tomorrow is perfect for said closet organization.<br>  <br>  If I do remember I think I have to go move some boxes to the basement...or is it the grout in the tiles this time?|`|AA11097184	Its not correct to behave this way. When you take up another work, it looks like a cover you have created for avoiding them. Even if they do not talk to you directly, do not give them message of being away. Mix with all the members and lead the lively talk. You will get better results.|`|qImMwhUHaa	Yes, it is kind of rude but if you are trying to avoid them it is a pretty polite way. I would try next time to make a little small talk and if they didn't respond politely then I'd go to work on the refrigerator science experiments.|`|cEXzXkqnaa	Rude? a little...once maybe not...but twice in a row...ya, kinda...<br>   I think you are trying to avoid them...unconsciously or not...you seem to purposely be creating projects for yourself while they are visiting. Why not spend this time interacting with them. Clean the fridge after they leave.....|`|HXfHkoSHaa	Without trying to take their side, do you make an effort? Perhaps they feel they need to distance themselves because they think you don't like them.  Just a thought.  And if that's not it, and you've put forth effort enough times, then just clean the fridge.|`|4qiiuv6Xaa	Clean it another day.|`|45nSn7Rcaa	Its rude if they are there to visit you, but if they are there to visit the children then there is nothing wrong with that.|`|1ba96d5712bb7b62869d2c341295e4b7aa	yes it is kinda rude.. clean it before they come or after they leave but not while they are there.. sometimes i dont like to face my inlaws and i'd rather be doing something else like cleaning but it its kinda rudee|`|rBq189W1aa	Ain't no aggression like passive aggression!|`|tN2f6vWoaa	try and clean it in advance|`|4xN3ZIhYaa	2 days in a row is pushing it, your wife is keeping count|`|1K8IaPykaa	Are you trying to avoid them? Because if they came for a "visit," they probably came to see you and your partner and spend time with you. At least they're trying to be social! They may not have caught on the first time, but I think they will most likely get the hint the next time you have the urge to clean when they arrive. I suggest cleaning out the fridge after the visit. <br>  <br>  However, it would be a good idea to clean up the bathrooms and the living areas, if you are so inclined to clean recently. It'll make a great impression on your in-laws, and they will feel more welcome and comfortable in your home. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|OUvrvBNzaa	It sounds like you are trying to avoid your Inlaws. Does the fact that you have your head in the oven when they visit suggest something to you? To put it bluntly: is it a gas oven?<br>  <br>  Kick back a little and spill some beer. You must have at least one Inlaw who's a clean freak, from the sound of it. Let them have their fun. Think of it as a reality show starring you. Oh sure, they'll drag the occasional "science experiment" from the fridge and demand "what is this?" But isn't that better than charades?|`|KvOeZwWTaa	haha great question :) hm... you could make it work if you were kind of cleaning it when they arrived so it wouldn't really seem like you were just trying to avoid them by spontaneously being like "oops my fridge is dirty, better clean it!" but at least try to be a little involved this time; you never know when they might die (i can see you smiling through the computer)|`|jLXft3tFaa	I hate my mother-in-law.Go for it! Make sure you take out all of the shelves and scrub them down. Oh and make sure that you go to the store during the visit---insist that you need baking soda for freshness.|`|UqRlqrciaa	You already avoided them during your oven cleaning, so I would go with the inlaws tomorrow.|`|NjXgkn8Vaa	i dont think it's rude, because they are comming to visit you shouldn't clean, clean when they leave. they only visit once in a while right?|`|im3vWyv6aa	How often do your in-laws visit? Mine visit several times a week. I typically don't stop my "chores" to sit down with them anymore. I'm a full-time working mom. When I'm home I have stuff to do. They are welcome in my home anytime to see their son, grandchildren and even me. I will usually still speak to them while I'm folding laundry and packing lunches - I just can't sit and visit.<br>  <br>  :0)<br>  .|`|cAtWxJG1aa	lol.<br>  <br>  i usually use the opportunity to go on critical shopping trips, so i think you're better than i am.|`|j2mRop0laa	Actually that's a brilliant idea. I wonder who thought of it.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I'm thinking of making a mommy blog with opinions and funnies. Maybe you can just be part of my blog and work on that while they are in.|`|eu6UQElYaa	Yep it's rude.   Just because they are rude to you and your daughter doesn't mean you need to be rude to them.  Find another time to clean the fridge.|`|TQW5E6olaa	I think you and your daughter should have a mommy and me time, go do your nails, do some shopping, have lunch, ignore the a-holes|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Yes, it is a bit rude.They are going to get the hint that you are trying to avoid them.|`|prqrQcd1aa	If they don't speak much to your daughter either, maybe get her involved in the process of cleaning that fridge.. give her a magic eraser and have her go to town on the outside of it. I wouldn't say this is rude at all. Especially if they have no interest in the two of you anyways. Getting your daughter to join in the fun of cleaning will help her to not feel left out by these people as well! (May even get a little "raise" our of them as well!|`|cYRZpGkqaa	Clean it while they are there. I know exactly how you feel... They'll never even know the difference. Lol. Good way to get creative. I usually just sit there bored out of my mind.|`|H0sPCJQPaa	Visit the inlaws<br>  and clean your fridge later.|`|hkQSqPEwaa	Maybe you can put your in laws to work and they will never come back?|`|E5sgD6hlaa	how can they complain? "oh she is too CLEAN?"<br>  <br>  good luck :o)|`|bl3QXX6Saa	That's funny. lol<br>  I would say maybe hold off on the cleaning while they're there because they might get offended by it :]|`|JnLoHaoAaa	Ahhh go for it! If they can't show you and your daughter respect, then why show them any? Clean away, girl!|`|nrqWwQBXaa	are you trying to avoid them. i just found a good way to avoid mine thank you. not that would be just fine?
zHmZkMStaa	My name is James, and I LOVE it.  The reason is because there are so many permutations to it.  I.E., to my Dad, I was always Jamie.  To the rest of my family and dearest friends it's Jimmy.  Most others call me Jim.  But to some, I'm Jimbo. My Irish relatives will sometimes even call me Seamus!  And of course, officially, I'm James.<br>  I enjoy how others choose to call me by any of those permutations.  Also, I know that someone is feeling closer to me as they evolve from calling me Jim to the more familiar and affectionate Jimmy.  The other names you mention are all nice, but I don't think they have as many nicknames associated with them?   Also, James is a single syllable, and trips more easily off the tongue than the others mentioned.|`|2ImIgJwXaa	Jacob or James- Think if they would run for president- who would want to say President Hamish LastName? They are all cool names though. I knew a guy named Seamus once. Also, you want a name people can easily pronounce in school and in a professional setting.|`|8WbfmK5daa	Thats a hard one between Jacob and James.

Ot8lxaMEaa	Its 100% normal to worry! You dont mention how old your baby is, but as you know, once they can roll they are past the risk of SIDS. The way I look at it is if you go back 50 years, the reccomendation was for babies to sleep on their tummies! And you know what, most of the babies did survive being put on theis stomachs from Day 1. Once your little one has discovered how comfy it is to sleep on his stomach, he is not going to want to move, and for your sanity you have to try and relax.(Easier said than done of course) Good luck!|`|1VdgsZPoaa	Yes, I always changed her back to her back when she did that but she would just roll back over at some point again.  Once they roll over like that they are strong enough to get themselves back so they won't suffocate.  They are fine, it's still nerve wracking.<br>  <br>  Honestly, the worse thing you can do is buy one of those pillow things to keep them on their backs.  They can slide down and get stuck and tangled in it.  Soon they are in more danger then they were sleeping on their tummies :)|`|596ba0725523b654ae88f9a7d31dae51aa	Once they can start rolling over, life is nothing but constant "what if's." It just gets worse and worse. Before you know it, you'll be worrying about the little one falling off a sliding board, or getting hurt playing sports, or riding a bike, or going two houses away on his or her own to play. And yet we have to let them do all this stuff. Can't protect them too much. Just the burden of being a good parent.|`|YE3RREngaa	As far as I have heard the new big thing for how babies should sleep is on their side. You can put blankets on either side of your son and that will keep him from rolling over.<br>  <br>  For a while you were supposed to have them on their stomach and then it was on their back and now on the side...they are always changing it...<br>  <br>  Otherwise you should not worry...maybe talk to your doctor if you are really worried...|`|VXhOLgDEaa	Hmm..for some reason the whole sleeping on the tummy thing didn't really scare me....because that's how my mommy put me when I was a baby. I'm korean...and well from my experience I think American people are wayy more cautious and worry about a lot of things that asian cultures don't really worry about. With that said.....yes you're right....the pedi also told me that once the baby can roll around then he's perfectly fine to sleep on his belly. Another thing....SIDS are not that common as much as people say they are.....and when your baby is at the stage of rolling back and forth....risks of SIDS are 1 in a trillion.|`|gTOmztJxaa	Not anymore.  I used to be, but Victoria turns her head to the side so her nose isn't pressed against the crib mattress.  <br>  <br>  But it is scary at first!  I used to put her back on her back, but she would go right back on her tummy :-)|`|9b579e5d0c20c6295a54289ea1d57053aa	Yes it scares me too. But I leave my son if he's on his tummy so I don't wae him up. To make me feel better I have the Angelcare baby monitor. This monitor is great and it sounds an alarm if the pad can't detect any movement. It goes off more now that he is rolling around and I find him at the top of the crib..lol. It's a piece of mind though knowing it picks it up like that. Also, he sleeps in a baby sac. I use no blankets because blankets can go over his head and get tangled up. I use a Grobag and it's the BEST infection. I also keep nothing in his crib, no teddy bears no bumper pads. Just the sheet on the mattress. This make the crib much safer.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	I did at first. I can't tell you how many times I checked on him. It took about 2 weeks for me to get completely used to it and now it's normal for me. =)|`|eu6UQElYaa	Honestly, it made me nervous too.  I wasn't really ok with letting my kids sleep on their tummies until they could roll from back to front AND front to back.  So I bought a sleep positioner.   They sell them at Walmart and it was totally worth the piece of mind.|`|AwvWBROlaa	if baby can turn his whole body by himself he has enough strength to lift his head or move side to side if he feels breathing discomfort. I would make where his sleeping surface free from being too soft and put him in thicker pj and dont over stuff him with any blanket just in case he barries his little face. I was told to stop using bumper pad starting around that time. Bumper pad can actually be hazardous for babies who just started rolling over. if your still worried you can always sleep with him or next to his crib =)|`|BO3KBsPIaa	I am very scared. I bought a baby wedge to prop under my four month old girl to stop her from rolling onto her back. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.twenga.co.uk/dir-Children,Equipment-for-babies,Baby-wedge" rel="nofollow">http://www.twenga.co.uk/dir-Children,Equ...</a><br>  <br>  Its less than ten pounds, which is more than worth it for the peace of mind. I know that i could never forgive myself if she died in her sleep, on her front, just thinking about it upsets me so much. So buy one! And you wont need to worry any more!|`|HXfHkoSHaa	This will probably sound nuts to you, but no it doesn't scare me.  My son is 5 months old.  He can roll over too, but still insists on being swaddled to fall asleep at night.

Next thing I knew I actually realized that while I excelled in these classes, I enjoyed being a part of them as well. Going into high school I joined classes like Health Science Technology, Medical Terminology, Pathophysiology, etc. All these classes really opened my eyes that being a part of the medical field is my die hard passion.<br>  <br>  There isn't another thing in the world I want, or need to do. Being in medicine is where I am destined to be. I have an outgoing personality which really clicks with other people, I study hard, I go above and beyond, I volunteer, and I always have the best in mind for people other than myself.<br>  <br>  I've been to medical forums over summer and volunteered at hospitals also to insure that this is what I want to do. Everything has worked out and I plan on going to college and prepare for medical school afterwards.<br>  <br>  As for you, I don't really have any advice on how to figure out what is best for you to do later in life. As cheesy, and unhelpful, as this is I really think that it came to me because I've always liked sciences of the body and anatomy classes, so that clued me in to what I wanted to do. Good Luck, though.|`|7a9ca1e0d676415430d900245a7c2d25aa	I want to study psychology and law. Crime investigation seems like an interesting thing to study.

MqFeJiukaa	It will get better with time.  A lot of women have felt this way.  My youngest just turned 2 weeks today.  He is my 5th baby and was a shocker.  My 4th just turned 13m when he was 5 days old.  I was breastfeeding and never had a period and by the time I found out I was pregnant I was already 12 weeks.  I thought it was the biggest disaster.  I wanted my tubes tied and since I had changed jobs after maternity leave I was still jumping through the insurance and Dr hoops.  By the time I was finishing my 2nd trimester (like I said I found out when I started my 2nd trimester) I was super excited and knew I was going to be ok.  I could not imagine my life with out him.<br>  There are many programs to help.  Its ok to accept help.  It will get better once it all sinks in and you get adjusted.  Good Luck and Congrats|`|35kVNi5oaa	everything will work out. After the first three months the pregnancy gets a lot better and goes by faster.|`|v7f2bjpfaa	I wasn't expecting to get pregnant when I did either, and I remember just crying when someone asked me if I really wanted the baby in the beginning.  It does get better once you see the baby on the ultrasound and begin to feel them moving.  I'm now a mother to an 8 month old baby boy, and I can honestly say I have never been happier in my life...his father also took sometime to get used to being a father, just try to keep him as involved as possible.|`|SzMH2na0aa	There are alot of programs that offer assistance and counseling for low income family that are dealing with pregnancy.  I would strongly suggest you call you local United Way office and ask for a referral, they would be able to help you answer alot of questions and they may help you feel for comfortable with your pregnancy.|`|SSM3u4l4aa	I know all about what it feels like to be in a situation like the one you are in. I understand it and can sympathize completely. <br>  <br>  First you need to think about the baby like a blessing. It really is a blessing. New babies can inspire change in people that nothing else can. <br>  <br>  Second you need to do something about your finances. You are newly pregnant.. working would not be that hard on you. If you can't fully rely on the baby's daddy, you need to try for as long as you can to do as much as you can by yourself. Get a job if you don't have one. Save every, single penny that you can until the baby is born and try to buy all the necessities out of the money. <br>  <br>  Take all the moral support you can get. Let your family back you up and help you as much as they will. If they are not there for you then find something else like a good church. <br>  <br>  As for the not knowing anything about babies- watch the discovery channel and The Learning Channel as much as you can. Read books, talk to moms. There are tons of stuff that you can learn. <br>  <br>  Feeling like you do is normal sometimes. Having a baby, bringing a new person into the world is a huge responsibly. You are right to look at it like that. Being a parent is not to be taken lightly. You don't have to be rich to be a good mother.. that is one thing that cannot be bought. You will do fine. Just love that baby and do what you can before it is born. Diapers can be bought in cases.. clothes don't always have to be new.. love is free. <br>  <br>  Best of luck!
cf59b7a86d3c85c41cac7a7189fbda41aa	Well take the test first thing in the morning with first urination cause that carries more of the pregnancy hormone. Its good that you waited about a week after your expected period cause it will be more accurate. You should have invested in a better test then a dollar store test, like First Response. Take your test in the morning if it is positive then feel free to test again the next day to be sure. You should then see a dr to confirm that you are pregnant. If you are then congrats and good luck to you.|`|7AYnWg3paa	after u miss a period it should be accurate....no point in me telling u yes or no to the " am i pregnant" question....just to be realistic...im not a phsychic|`|KOwzDLPdaa	A test should be very very accurate if you wait until you are one week late.

I am now 37 weeks and have been dilated 3cm for 3 weeks now.They always say that dilation doesn't equal labor (which is probably why your doctor isn't worried.) Also women who have had kids before tend to dilate quicker than first-timers. Good luck.|`|9b579e5d0c20c6295a54289ea1d57053aa	I just had my 2nd son 6 months ago. I had a scheduled c-section ( 1st boy was c-section). My scheduled date was for Aug 19th. I started to have major pains and Braxton Hicks around Aug 14th. After a day or so I went to the hospital as I was in so much pain. After the exam I was not dialated and was sent home to wait for my scheduled date. After not sleeping for a day and pains every 7min I went back to the hospital on Aug 17th and I was dialted 2cm and 100% effaced. I was 39 weeks pregnant. I had my baby that day.|`|HM0cxcahaa	Im 40 +3 with my second, i have been 1cm for months :(|`|LZk3z2ilaa	I am on my 2nd and 37 weeks and no dilated at all :(  But I have another appointment on Monday.... keeping my fingers crossed.

MubTZUKXaa	For IUI, approx 3.  It's different with IVF as they try to get more to remove.  With IUI the eggs stay put and any more than 3 can give a greater risk of multiple pregnancy and greater health problems as a result.<br>  Also, just because he said you have two medium and ten small doesn't mean you will release so many.  Some may not grow big enough to release so don't worry about that.  When it comes to it you should have a few that are within the normal size range...<br>  When I had my IUI in August, I only had two eggs.  This was at day 23!  Mine were really slow to develop as I was on the lowest dose of injectables.  I got pregnant with only two eggs at a decent size, it only takes one... so if you have at least one, you have a chance.  More than three and it gets risky.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!! Baby dust xxxx|`|Ka52nbhNaa	It depends on what your RE is trying to achieve . . . I tried Clomid and only had 1 mature egg develop . . . after 3 unsuccessful cycles, we moved onto injectible fertility meds (I used Gonal F) and he was working to coax my body to produce 3 - 5 mature eggs . . . he did not want more due to the risk of high-order multiples.  Unfortunately, that did not work either so we moved onto IVF.<br>  <br>  With good sperm count, it only takes one mature egg . . . but more mature follicles / eggs - say 3 - 5 will increase your chances for success but also increase your risk for twins or more.<br>  <br>  Good luck and loads of baby dust to you!|`|Hpidy9Oraa	my first iui i was on 100mg clomid and i had 3 fully mature eggs..  Tho it didn't work for me, i'm hoping it will work this time.  I only have one tube so i may not get to do the iui every month
OQFd3pl5aa	It is best to bd on days you see ewcm. That means you are in your fertile window approaching ovulation, and the best time to ttc is prior to ovulation, the day of is also important. You can consider yourself fertile the day after O, as there is a chance your egg may live for up to 24 hours. Average is 12, and sometimes it lives as short as 6 hours, so bd'ing prior to O is crucial. The close you bd to O, the higher chance you have a conceiving a boy, according to the shettles method. As you said, there is no guarantee. Boy sperm are said to have a shorter life span, but can swim faster. Girls live longer but are slower, so according to the shettles method, if you want a girl you should bd prior to O and then abstain. A boy, you want to bd closer to O. <br>  <br>  EWCM is said to dry up prior to O. Ovulation is said to occur on the last day, or the day after the last you observe ewcm. You are supposed to O within 12-36 hours after a + opk. When unsure, just follow the signs your body is giving you. When you see ewcm, bd accordingly. Sounds like you had good timing :)<br>  <br>  Good luck and lots of baby dust!|`|tSh1zh7gaa	What did the pains feel like?

SSM3u4l4aa	Yes. You can get pregnant pretty much anytime you have unprotected sex.|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	Highly unlikely. You have to have started menstruation before you can get pregnant. How old are you? If you aren't old enough to have started your period, then you aren't old enough to be having sex.|`|F12ekJ7Saa	Yes. You can get pregnant at any time of your cycle.|`|AA10861239	As many are saying, you can get pregnant at any time of the month, even (highly unlikely) during your period. Stress, diet, hormones, lots of factors can cause someone to ovulate at unpredictable times. <br>  <br>  You are most likely to get pregnant 10-14 days after the first day of your last cycle. That is the likely time frame--but there are absolutely no guarantees. The safest sex is no sex! I'm sure you've heard that but it's the absolute truth. For people in no position to manage a baby or a pregnancy there should only be abstanance.|`|35kVNi5oaa	yup|`|uAZlvHgiaa	No. Not if you do not have periods yet.|`|hmcQJnTraa	yup|`|wK4kqhHkaa	Yes you can.  Before you get your first period you will ovulate which happens about 1 week earlier. If the egg is fertilised you become pregnant if it isn't you have a period.  So if you have sex when your ovulating before your first period you could get pregnant.|`|SzMH2na0aa	yes, sometime pregnancy symptoms start before your period is due.|`|FX4xxpTaaa	No you cannot
1MEnCmwoaa	what i did was just trade it for a sippy cup of milk and some crackers. you will have to start a new routine! <br>  every night we watch an episode of blues clues while she has her snack and then she sets her cup on the table and we head upstairs.<br>  a story would work well too of course, but my daughter won't sit through one yet!<br>  I stopped the bedtime bottle when she was about 13 months and it was no problem, by then the bottle wasn't enough before bed and she would wake up early super hungry so the crackers helped with that.|`|2F5HNPqPaa	My friends 22 months old still has a bedtime bottle... but that's the only one she has.  Don't know if that's good or bad though!  Probably bad because of teeth.  <br>  <br>  All I can suggest is you try a sippy cup at bedtime.  You could still cuddle her and give it like a bottle..|`|avx7bLnKaa	leave the bedtime bottle, she'll let you know when she doesn't need it anymore...<br>  if you do anyways then just slowly slowly reduce the amountyou give her<br>  <br>  don't do water in the bottle, she is still under a yr, let her have her "milk"<br>  <br>  my 1st son took a bottle during the night until 14-15months then i introduced the sippy at night and he refused... had to rock him with a pacifier until he grew accostumed to not having the bottle....|`|KOwzDLPdaa	I have gotten my 14 month old son bottle free by letting him have a sippy cup of milk before bed, then we brush his teeth (all 7 of them LOL), and then he gets a bottle with just water in it to take into his crib with him. He usually takes a few sips and goes to sleep and if he wakes up in the middle of the night, he drinks a little and puts himself back to sleep. We're on week two of using a sippy cup of water instead of a bottle.<br>  <br>  Its working for us! maybe you'll have some luck. And our little guy was a comfort sucker so that bottle was his BEST friend.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
HztriBPAaa	She may not appreciate it now but she may come to cherish it as she gets older. Its a gift from her grandma and unfortunately grandmas do not live forever. I have a little stuffed gorilla that my Great Aunt gave to me when I was born. I didn't play with it much as a kid but as she is declining in health it has become very important to me as a symbol of how much she has always loved me. As for your sister in law I would explain to her that you were taken aback by her asking as this is the only stuffed animal your daughter has had since she was born and it is important to you that she have it for when she grows up. Suggest she ask your mother in law where the bear was purchased so she can hopefully find another one. Be polite but firm, take the high road you don't want to sink to her level.However do not be a doormat or this is just the beginning. You can't take back harsh words and she is technically family. If you want to you can get him a bear like it after all you don't want to punish the kid because his mom is a jerk. Hope this helps and all the best to you and your family.|`|AA11476951	I wouldn't. It is a special gift from her grandmother and just because she doesn't love it doesn't mean anything. One day grandma might be gone and it will be something she held on to.|`|EmhBDHMtaa	if it's your daughters toy don't take it away from her to give to your nephew she can go buy him another one even if it's not like that one he had before...i know im not going to take a toy away from my baby to give to another one unless they TOTALLY did not play with it...plus your mother-in-law could say something about you giving it away.|`|qImMwhUHaa	I think your being a jerk.

TXB5wVlSaa	I have a 12 year old who has yelled similiar things in the past.  Sometimes kids say things in the heat of the moment not realizing the severity.  Think back to when you were that age ... didn't you ever have times when you just ''wanted to die''.  Of course you didn't really ... but in times of anger, frustration, or sadness kids say things like that.  It really depends on what kind of kid she is.  Watch for other troubling signs that might indicate she really has a problem.  If she's depressed or seems to be having some serious trouble within herself, you should get her some help.  Talking to a school counselor can even be beneficial.|`|foJm2Yftaa	Talk to her! Don't tell her to go to her room because if shes really upset she might hurt herself like um..... jumping out the window or tieng a rope on the fan and then put her neck through it, then kick the chair and DIE! Tell her soon things will get better.  You need time to understand her.|`|D8rjkxBTaa	If you're taking care of her, you need to sit with her and talk, not send her to her room!  The girl needs serious help, starting with your attention!|`|01Mu3wUeaa	It would really depend if she was screaming it out of anger or if she was serious.<br>  <br>  Can you tell the difference between the two?<br>  <br>  I would try talking to her about things once she calms down.|`|xBd96wvRaa	Call 911 a social worker will come out and admit her to a psycho ward.|`|CrZxYK5raa	she is an angry child right now.<br>  i bet there is something going on at school<br>  i would call her school and have her set up <br>  weekly appt. with the school counselor.

ubP7Lgxeaa	i am 16 and my sister is 13 and this is what i tell her. You can do what you want as go as far as you want because in the end its you who has to clean up your mess you have left behind. I think being with a guy its about trusting them and being comfortable enough to say stop even if it is not anything serious. Maybe at your age just kissing and if you feel very trusting of each other maybe your shirt off or his hands down their:) what ever happens is only experience be it good or bad and everyone has to learn mistakes from themselves...just try and make your self as educated on the subject as possible:) x|`|iDtCpN38aa	yea my mind was all over the place when i was 14 i didrt do much just kiss and feel i spose, there no harm in that aslong as you wait until your older for the more intimate stuff, my cousin was 14 when she got pregnant was'rt good just be careful wat ever you do :]|`|SWNX9hoRaa	okay. i think making out. which is open mouth kissing with tongue for a long time. (that's french kissing basically)<br>  you shouldn't do anything more and like have sex until your 16 or older.|`|xoobWcWxaa	i think making out is as far as you should go at 14 <br>  id if thats how it really is im just saying my little sister is that old<br>  and i hope that is all she is doing|`|opiXLlz1aa	Well Probably like Kissing.. You may not be lucky enough to be with him forever and it may hurt you in the long run if something happens and this kid is your first.|`|AusPef8Yaa	Making out is like a French Kiss going on and on and on...<br>  <br>  You shouldn't be going very far. Stick to little kisses and hugs :]|`|xCeaVqItaa	What is "pull" or "trap" mean?|`|cTM07yNwaa	i would say just making out,  <br>  your a little young to be doing other stuff, but do what your comfortable with.|`|oUGiIhegaa	maximum of 5 miles, 6 if you want to be a bit risky.|`|p7HaGkQUaa	you shouldn't go far at all, stick to cuddles!|`|NaYTDqmnaa	kissing hugging etc.any thing thats not sex|`|kRaVa0Wraa	making out. its open mouth kissing<br>  <br>  but people do go farther. i think that's stupid though.|`|AA11476951	Hands off! That's my opinion and that's the way I was raised as well.|`|HQyVeaPPaa	no more than making out<br>  but i wouldnt go to that step with a boy too fast or else you might make a reputation for yourself<br>  <br>  edit: making out is kissing open mouth kissing... with tongue <br>  some people call it french kissing|`|fYcYPyR3aa	Making out is snogging and you shouldn't go further than that at 14.|`|ZVUrLZpXaa	As far as walking to the library to study...|`|1RwZZ2aPaa	A peck on the lips. That's all.<br>  Making out in america pretty much means french kissing.|`|sCL6b362aa	making out is kissing... for an extended period of time, you know, like in the movies where they keep kissing and get all touchy and gushy and passionate. unfortunately making out sometimes leads to feeling and a lot of things can happen after that... =/|`|MWrwnHM2aa	Making out is kissing.<br>  I would say just kiss, hug and hold hands.<br>  You are young and you don't need to start going further.<br>  You need to know that you don't have to go further if he tries to persuade you into going further.<br>  If he doesn't agree then he obviously isn't Mr.Right|`|8dpZpH0Saa	How far should you go? Maybe you shouldn't be dating him if you aren't mature enough to know. You shouldn't being kissing, you should be holding hands and hugging. Your to young to really even think about dating.|`|eeKlogL4aa	French kissing is far enough for a 14 year old, in my opinion. If you go further (like sex) you will most likely regret it when you're older.|`|bKkea7fyaa	im 14 too and i often ask myself this question<br>  many people go too far too young but i think at 14 hugging n kissing is good n i dnt mean little pecks lol but dnt rush things good luk!|`|MTF0Rz90aa	To the end of the street and maybe for a short bus ride.<br>  Ja.|`|SaAQZiG4aa	no further than a french kiss or trap|`|FQ3mi15Qaa	i would go to open-mouth making out. if I REALLY trust him i might go into the sexual things. but thats just me

VKQzj4Pmaa	The followong article is pertaining to California:<br>  <br>  "On January 1, 2008, a law went into effect which bans smoking in cars when there are children younger than 18 present. Those caught violating the law will face up to a $100 fine. <br>  <br>  The law was created to protect children who are particularly vulnerable to the dangerous effects of secondhand smoke. The air quality in a car where someone is smoking can reach nearly 10 times over the hazardous levels set by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.<br>  <br>  California is the third state to ban smoking in cars carrying minors, but the first with a policy that protects all children under 18. In 2006, Arkansas and Louisiana passed laws banning motorists from smoking in cars with children up to age 6 and 13 years old, respectively."<br>  <br>  So, not every state bans smoking in the car with children, and as you can see, there are different rules with each state pertaining to that law.
xBd96wvRaa	You sound perfectly fine according to the symptoms you have described. <br>  <br>  I am not a doctor though. But have had two children.|`|eu6UQElYaa	bloating is normal in early pregnancy.  If this is your first you probably won't really start to show until around month 5.|`|AwvWBROlaa	pregnant women have morning sickness any period of there 3 trimester. most have it around end of first semester. First month or two i felt really bloated too. It is normal but you should be having prenatal check up every 4-5 weeks by now so you should bring it up to your obgyn or your midwife. =)|`|VXhOLgDEaa	Ok...first off..I didn't start really showing until after 4 mths. Bloating and your tummy going down and all that weird stuff is perfectly normal..nothing's happening to your baby don't worry. As for the morning sickness......NOT having a pregnancy symptom is not a sign of something being wrong. It's a sign of YOU'RE FREAKIN' BLESSED!...Like me!...haha...I only had morning sickness for less than a week and after that....nothing. Pregnancy symptoms are just symptoms that some people have and some people don't. Some go through the whole entire thing with no symptom at all besides aching back. One more thing......don't worry too much that something can hurt your baby. TRUST ME...your body is stronger and way smarter than we all give credit for....I fell down the stairs twice during my pregnancy...and everything was okay....the fetus is well cushioned and protected in your tummy.|`|d4ac61414fc4c240b01f3cc34a7003c9aa	I didn't show until at least 15 weeks.  I remember wearing a bikini on vacation at 12 weeks.  What a distant memory!  I only threw up a couple of times.  Some women never get morning sickness.  It doesn't mean anything.  Try to stop worrying.|`|AA11476951	You won't show this early. I've had 3 pregnancies and never threw up once. Some people just don't get sick.|`|1MEnCmwoaa	it is normal at this point, i was always so bloated by the end of the day and then the next morning almost normal. i pretty much stayed bloated though! with my first i started showing around 14 weeks and needed maternity clothes about 16 weeks. with #2 i started showing closer to 12-13 weeks and need maternity clothes about 15 weeks. so, don't worry about a belly yet!<br>  Also, symptoms are so different for everyone! First time, sore breasts and slightly nauseous for one week. then at 7 weeks it all stopped and i had no more symptoms. <br>  This time i was horribly sick for a week then just nauseous for the next 5 weeks and never had a sore boob the whole time. the second time i was way more tired too. <br>  i don't know what a dangy fever is! sorry!|`|wK4kqhHkaa	I never had any morning sickness and i didn't show until i was close to 6mths pregnant- i had a healthy baby girl.   Depends on your body shape and your stomach muscles as to how soon you will show and you don't have to have morning sickness.  I had hardly any symptoms, and it maybe being pregnant a wonderful experience- the best time of my life actually.  Different people different symptoms, all normal.|`|DpOF55c9aa	everything you have said sound normal to me. This is my first pregnancy. The bloating early on happened to me as well. I didn't start to show until nearly 20 weeks. And being nearly 27 weeks now I'm still not that big. Morning Sickness is different for everyone.
IbWBAwVPaa	Dump them BOTH! You don't need this. Find better friends and a better man. There are millions of people in the world who are better than these two! So forget them. They deserve each other. So say goodbye to him, her and their future little crying poop machine! Be glad SHE is having his stupid brat and not YOU! <br>  <br>  If I were you I would not want any part of this. It can only end badly and you don't want to be involved! They sound like a couple of drama queens to me! Best of luck to you. I hope this helps!|`|dPgP28Aiaa	Well if you feel so betrayed by both of them that you don't want them in your life anymore, get rid of them. This guy's your ex so he probably isn't in your life anyways I'm guessing?

She ain't a good or a close friend if she had the nerve to have sex with him only after a month of you two being separated. If it was longer I would understand but that messed up. I would quit talking to both of them cause true friends don't do that to their friends, but also remember that you can't always hold a grudge, so learn to forgive her in the long run. Good luck!!|`|FQNwJM2Waa	you guys may have had something close but then you have to look at thier relationship and you think he is not just skrewing with her then maybe its best that you wish then the best.....and hope things will move on and you will find a guy better then him maybe not the perfect guys but one that wont do that to you.|`|LZymi3teaa	um well he's your ex and is currently out of your life until your best friend she is preg by him.

If she is far enough to already know that she is pregnant this must have happened at least 2 weeks after you were broken up.<br>  And hes just an *** I suppose I would rid them  both|`|6wMOKiziaa	give her a chance. she probably needs a friend right now and most likely regrets having sex with your boyfriend|`|365d70b021fb625020b0fa8e63533e37aa	well he is your ex so it should not matter
4xsAQBZuaa	Told my nieces and nephews that they have the right to touch them selves in their room or bathroom but not in public, a few simple reminders and parents catching on, the kids picked up on it quickly and it no longer became an issue.  As far as touching others they where told straight up that it wasn't right because it wasn't their body.  They could only touch their bodies.  Being honest and open and keeping it simple kids will understand and GET IT with just a few reminders, if you aren't embarrassed about the subject then neither will they be.|`|b7ff0c6859d6ba5cc891050de578e39daa	If it's just herself she is touching, tell her to go into the bathroom to do that.  Just like peeing, that is something you do privately.  Don't tell her not to do it, that will just make her want to do it more.<br>  <br>  As for touching others, that is not appropriate and needs to be stopped soon. (but you already know that)  Perhaps you could remove her from the play area and calmly discuss why it is wrong to do it.  Be consistent and do the same thing each time she touches another child inappropriately.  Even when she can recite your speech to you, tell her again until the behavior stops.|`|XKYP0sGQaa	Don't. The more you prattle on to her about it, the more she is likely to do it. Let her. She is a child and will eventually grow out of it. It is only a phase.|`|e4596390515e8d11a71ef13fed732cc9aa	Just calmly stop the situation and in a low stern tone tell them to not do that.  That is not something she should do.  Dont just let it go.|`|HUcGxeSkaa	Smack her hand or spank her butt when she touches other kids. You should also explain why you have punished her: under any circumstances should you touch other children in these areas. It is bad. When she goes to do it again she will remember she got punished and will think twice about it the next time. I definitely do not agree with Micheal's answer, other parents may not want your child to touch their child in this way.|`|9bz6EpoLaa	If she's only 5 and doing that, I would SERIOUSLY question if she's been innappropriately touched by someone or molested. Talk with her and ask her, but be calm. Something sounds not right about a 5-yr-old that knows how to do that.|`|au1yFfuxaa	It is no big deal about herself but just calmy tell her that it is not polite to touch other people. Just tell her the "hands to herself" rule. :)|`|4c0zHQqWaa	No, No, No. To Micheals answer. Absolutely not. It is not appropriate for her to touch other people in their private areas. Tell your daughter she is allowed to touch herself. But she is not allowed to touch other people there. Tell her that those are their private areas, and only they can touch them.  Use any type of your discipline if she doesn't follow these rules about other peoples privates.|`|FpT7x2VVaa	don't think so renee -I knew a female one year old who masturbated, and I know, she was never 'inappropriately touched' by anyone. it did stop eventually.<br>  discovery at that age is normal, we just need to provide the right guidance and oversight.
lGrcLQ49aa	I would take him to the police station.  Make sure he gets a good dose of reality.  He should have had the police involved the first time, then perhaps there wouldn't have been a second.|`|124377045ceac9826f76a176d439bd8faa	Don't get the police involved. But he needs to get it returned, and if the owner wants to call the police that is his tough luck. He should offer some restitution for their inconvenience--whatever can be agreed on--but toward the high end--$100 maybe<br>  <br>  Then regardless if the owner got the police involved, there would be an additional punishment at home, in addition to raising the restitution.<br>  <br>  Mine would get a pants down paddling that he would never forget, confined to his room for two weeks--with no TV, computer, phones or mp3, and home restriction for an additional six weeks.<br>  <br>  Restitution is to be paid in full by the end of home restriction--which he can earn by doing the ickiest jobs you can think of--at a rate of not more than a dollar an hour.|`|rhPCJfeuaa	I would march him with the bike to return it and apologize in person.  Then I would take his rear end down to the police station so that he could see what a holding cell looks like.  I would talk to a police officer about allowing him to be put into an empty cell and have them slam the door on him for 15 minutes.  Then I would take him home and put him to work in the garage and back yard with some good, hard labor projects that would take 1 or two weeks to accomplish.  Since he has done this before, I would make it clear to him that you do not like the path he seems to be taking in life.  Make it clear to him, that while you will always love him, you will not condone this behavior in your house and will not protect him from the law if there is a next time.  Tell him you will personally call the police to report him next time, so there had better not be one.|`|AA11097184	You must take this as a serious signal. If he listens to you, parents should have a frank talk with him.<br>  If he does not have respect or fear from you, you must consult a counsellor. You can not afford to give him another chance.<br>  However, if you take him to cops, he would go against you and will always remember this bitter fact that you have not guided him properly.|`|GYdbXHpTaa	It's your fault for not buying him a bike in the first place.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Just joking. Make him return the bike to the restaurant with an apology and make him do charity work or volunteer.|`|PkZxBGReaa	Sounds like you are doing a good job. Some children are just hard headed. =0( Perhaps this time he should maybe work to pay back 4 times the worth of the money. I read that in a very Good Book...|`|1VdgsZPoaa	Take him to the police station and have him spend an afternoon as a "common criminal".  Tough love baby, tough love.|`|1waI9ygVaa	i'd say "good job son and get me a bike next time"<br>  <br>  encourage him to be a cleptomaniac|`|TXB5wVlSaa	I would make him return it and apologize, first of all.  If he doesn't have it anymore ... he should definitley work to pay the people back.  You then should punish him in a way that really gets your anger across ... taking away items or privlidges.  You may also want to consider getting him some kind of help since this isn't the first time it's happened.  You need to know why he's doing it.

Good luck to you.|`|KlWWh3fgaa	Make him give the bike back, and confiscate the current bicycle he already owns.

If they didn't already have a bike, they'd be working their butts off to raise the equivalent cost of a new bike which they would then donate the money to a children's charity or the kid they stole the bike from.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Where did he steal if from?<br>  <br>  <br>  If it was from a house...or if you know who he stole it from..I would make him return it with an apology note.<br>  <br>  He would be grounded for 1 week maybe two weeks without any privileges (net, tv, music, etc) he would be doing all household chores during his sentence, and would write me an essay on why it is naughty to steal and why he did it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Any further punishment would really depend if he was really sorry for the theft or not.<br>  <br>  Juvenile hall may NOT be the best option.I have seen first hand how juvy actually encouraged kids to dig themselves a deeper hole by learning new things from those delinquents.|`|AA11104372	Call the police.

NQWS4Ptjaa	The only way you will get a positive result on a HPT is if you ARE pregnant.  HPTs detect hcg (the pregnancy hormone) and you only have that if you are pregnant.  Doesn't matter how diluted the urine is.<br>  <br>  Now, if you got a negative it could be a false negative.  Your best bet is to test with your first morning urine (when the hcg levels would be the highest) and go from there.  If you still aren't convinced, call your doctor and have a bloodtest done.|`|zj8HLXI3aa	You're probably pregnant. Rockstar energy drinks are tight.|`|35kVNi5oaa	well, wait to see if you get your period tomorrow.|`|SSM3u4l4aa	They are pretty accurate. If you for a negative and you are still worried test again tomorrow. If you got a positive and you don't trust it, test again tomorrow. <br>  No, the energy drink should not affect the accuracy of the test at all but if you are thinking you are pregnant talk to your doctor before drinking anymore. Many of the energy drinks out have WAY too much caffeine for a pregnant woman to be consuming.|`|do8pdlluaa	You should do it first thing in the morning.

In fact, recent research conducted by the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) suggests that women have the potential to become pregnant at virtually any time during their cycle. While the chance of pregnancy is greater on certain days of a woman's cycle, it is never completely absent. <br>  <br>  The answer is YES you can whether it's on your first day, last day or in the middle you can get pregnant.|`|Y2WMKpHjaa	No you can't since you are bleeding and ovulation does not happen during your period sorry.|`|LMfYodo6aa	You can become pregnant on any day during your cycle.
VKQzj4Pmaa	Yes, I do. While being in public, such as a waiting room or a store or whatnot, there have been a few times where I have witnessed "out of the norm, well-behaved children". <br>  <br>  Example . . . One time a child ran up to her mother in the store carrying a candy bar. She asked her mom the obvious question. The mother smiled and said no, while she placed her hand on top of her daughter's head to ruffle her hair. The little girl did not bat an eye and even smiled as she ran to put the candy bar back. She then ran back to her mother and held her hand as they continued down the aile. I had to stop and tell her how wonderful her daughter seemed, and that I could see she was a good parent.<br>  <br>  The way that mother and child acted and interacted, you could only see how that was a result of years of good parenting, and a good growing parent-child relationship.<br>  <br>  I can only think of two other times where I found a parent/child situation to be praise worthy.<br>  <br>  I get a lot of compliments on how well-behaved my son is, how happy he seems, and how adorable he is. I also get a lot of compliments on what a good mother I am, and how attentive and loving I seem. Of course, my son is only 6 months old.|`|j2mRop0laa	Yes, I have. There is a mom at the school that parents totally opposite of me. But I have seen her with her son and I told her that I thought she was a really great parent.<br>  <br>  I get complimented in real life often, and I do not say that to brag. I think the reason I get complimented more often than some, is because it can be shocking that I am as attentive for being so young and having had my oldest as a teen. I always feel like people (friends/ doctors/ nurses/ school staff and teachers) compliment me because I am not a statistic. Does that make sense?<br>  <br>  I'm not surprised you got complimented, in the least. :)|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	honest to goodness - i dont have that many people in my small world that i admire.  i have a lot of great examples of what not to do.  i tell my parents all the time how wonderful i think they are and what would they do type questions because i value their insight but in terms of other people....<br>  i did say something to my aunt just the other day about how wonderful her one daughter is.  (she really is a great young woman!)  i gave her the chance to brag about her which i know she needed as she is going through issues w/her other daughter.<br>  other than that, i have finally meet some wonderful moms/parents here.  people who so far have my respect in terms of child rearing, outside of my small world.|`|rBq189W1aa	I'm more prone to compliment the child to the parent, while the child is there to hear it. "Vanessa had very nice manners while I was looking after her." "Tim showed me how he can count all the way to twenty!" Stuff like that.<br>  <br>  I was taught when I did my childcare course to always look for something positive to focus on, and so far that approach has served me well, both with my kids and with others.|`|AA12145826	I do, but I'm sure it usually falls into the "you make it look so effortless" category (which is still totally meant as a compliment).|`|kQEnJpOvaa	No, I actually dont. But I should|`|eXLSKI2uaa	yes, i do.

Ok then.  I think this needed to be put in your previous question, LOL!!  Now go clean the whole house so you don't have to see them.  In fact, I would now sit down with my husband and try to see why the hell he wants them coming to his house when he has children.  Now I think you are being overly polite instead of slightly rude, LOL!!|`|JnLoHaoAaa	Maybe you could ask your MIL on what could use cleaning in the house, make a list, and clean one thing each time she comes.<br>  <br>  Or you whisper to her that you have some coke, watch her eyes light and up, and then yell "Sucka!"|`|VR9KhbEgaa	I think you should just clean the fridge in a black lace bra and matching thong...lol.

AA11138222	I like it because it honors part of his heritage that people wouldn't automatically assume.

fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Of course you have to block outlets, because the first time a baby does it could be the last time.<br>  <br>  Also all poisons should not be behind child safety locks, remember these are only deterrents not guarantees.  Poisons should be higher than a child can get and preferably locked, though I admit mine are higher than a child can get but I only have a hook and eye up near the top of the door which isn't that safe.<br>  <br>  Ideally you should bolt dressers and book cases to the wall.  And put an anti-tip device on your TV (unless wall mounted, not sure what you do with those).  Again because the first time can be the last time.<br>  <br>  I'll admit I haven't got around to it yet but I think a chime on the exterior doors would be a good idea.  Even though my toddler knows he's not allowed over the gate I know some day he will go over the gate and its a toss up whether he's going out the door or into the forbidden basement ;-)<br>  <br>  Other than that its really a matter of what you want to keep away from your child that your child has a particular desire to get.  Some people need fridge locks because their kids won't stay out of the fridge (and make a mess mostly) and others don't have that problem.  Some kids like to put things in the DVD player (did you know you can get a DVD *under* the drawer?) some kids don't.|`|KOwzDLPdaa	I have a three level home and we have everything you have and we have not had any issues with our 14 month old.

It is the main room that is baby proofed. Couple things to add to your list is furniture anchors once your baby starts climbing and if you have any sharp/point furniture corners a pack of padded stick on corner protectors. They make screw on ones but who wants to ruin their furniture? Ugh. The sticky ones don't damage furniture. We have corner protectors on the desks, the toy box, etc. <br>  <br>  Also, if you have blinds you need to make sure they are up to current standards and consider shortening the cords...

SSM3u4l4aa	Your mom cannot force you to have an abortion. I would think that is something that you have to agree to. <br>  If you want to keep the baby then show that to your mom. Be really responsible.. get a job. If you can't get an actual job (which is unlikely) then you can do things like babysit. Save all the money up that you can so that you are at least trying to support the baby yourself. You can buy diapers and things like clothes if you save your money. They are not really that expensive. <br>  <br>  No doll you are not a ho. The only thing that would make you a ho would be sleeping with anyone and everyone that you can and being easy. Sex is not recreational and should never be looked at like that. When I was your age I could have EASILY gotten pregnant and would have been in the exact same situation as you are in b/f and all. I was his first and he was mine. I was really careless back then and could have gotten pregnant. It is a miracle that I didn't actually. <br>  Anyway.. do what you can to show your mom that you are going to be responsible. She will be really worried about this because she will think that she will have to fork out a bunch of cash for things like diapers and medical expenses and formula. Show her that you want to help and that you have learned from the experience. Sex should not be taken lightly.. let her know that you know that now. <br>  <br>  Best of luck to you!|`|POGZZmoUaa	I am so proud of you for not wanting to kill your baby.

No, your Mom cant make you either. Although you dont want an adoption I really think that it would be the best thing for the life of your child. You said the fathers parents were supportive though, so maybe you should move in with them. If your Mom still insists the abortion then just explain your options too her. If your not going to do adoption, then move in with the father for their support. Its not easy rasing a baby, especially when your 14. Your not even old enough to work yet to support it, and even if the father does he 18 minimun wage salary isnt gonna give your baby a lot.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Of COURSE you have to AGREE. Also you do not know how your mom is going to react until you tell her. Don't assume. Parents can suprise you. She cannot force you to get an abortion though. No one can.|`|lGKq9NXbaa	getting rid of the baby doesn't make you a hoe. sleeping around does. maybe talk to her about adoption? talk to your mom about you options and listen to her! she's there to help you.|`|aXYiOskmaa	no one can force you to have an abortion. that said, if abortion is out of the question for you (and that's your choice) i strongly encourage you to consider adoption. do your baby a favor and let him/her have a good home with responsible, adult parents. nothing personal but, there's a reason 14 yr old shouldn't have sex or babies. you simply aren't ready for this.|`|JQcIwPXJaa	It's your body and your baby no doctor can do that procedure without your permission. Best wishes! Thank you for making the right decision!|`|tDEiKXIQaa	Call Birthright  They have tons of resources and things for your baby call 1-800-550-4900 God Bless congrats on the baby.|`|kPazsMkoaa	lets c: u r 14, u r going out w/ a 18 yr old who has his own house. u want to raise the baby. i'd say i agree w/ ur mom
8WbfmK5daa	If you like the name then just go for it :)<br>  <br>  I don't think it is too close to your name.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	For Mother and daughter, Kayla and kaylee are okay<br>  For Sisters, I would not do that<br>  <br>  you know that Kayla could be short for Michaela(Mikayla)<br>  You name her Michaela, and call her Kayla, so she has a different first name, and if you fine Kayla and Kaylee to close, you have Michaela|`|lGKq9NXbaa	no. it's cute. if you like the name then it's fine.|`|KZc5Ly4Yaa	Thats pretty close! <br>  My name is Anna (Rens my middle name nickname....) and I wanted to name one of my twins Hannah, but it was just to close to my name...and when she got older someone would yell "Anna!" or "Hannah!" if it was a far distance you could misunderstand it! When i was in school there was a Hannah and anytime the teacher said Anna I would say what? lol.|`|ARVuep1waa	i think its too close|`|igMh0iL3aa	You could use it as a middle name|`|MdPTBBfYaa	its  very close in spelling. but say it KAY LA. kay lee. its just your perceptive on saying the names. if one of them is going to be kayla Karly would be a nice compliment name. they have the same letters, just different first sylabols so you wont be confused while screaming at someone haha|`|E6tkzPsbaa	I don't think it's too close. Personally, I think the fact that the names are similar and your having twin girls is already adorable enough as it is! Good luck!|`|VSTozvDdaa	As pretty as the name Kayla is, I do think that it may be a little too close to your name. It might become confusing if you both have such similar names. Good Luck and Best Wishes!|`|KguWmxUhaa	Pretty much. Kayla and Kaylee are different names, but it can still be confusing for others.|`|zOlQwUdraa	I think that makes it even more adorable.|`|tuTv0mKDaa	I don't find anything wrong with it<br>  heck my dad and my brother have the exact same name!!|`|xaiNyZSVaa	i think you should find another name it would kinda be confusing .... theres tons of nice names out there :)|`|EmhBDHMtaa	no it's fine to me.
8WbfmK5daa	If its not an existing dog then I don't think it would be too weird.<br>  <br>  It is not as if you are actually naming your daughter after the dog.<br>  <br>  Unless you tell everybody too that your previously owned a dog called Hali then no one will even no anyway.|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	I would not name a child the same name as a dog<br>  <br>  Hallie and Hali, are they the same name?|`|ns1F0p8Laa	I don't think it is nothing wrong with that name and should it matter if your dog was named that the dog is not there now is it.|`|Vp3FklU2aa	As long as you probably never tell your daughter that your fine.<br>  <br>  Names-<br>  <br>  Kerry- I really like that name<br>  Danielle<br>  Nicole<br>  Michelle- I have about six friends that absolutely love that name<br>  Debra<br>  Haley- Instead of Halli pretty good its mostly the same  <br>  Heidi- ( Hi-De ) <br>  Jaime or Jamie|`|2pQUMKb2aa	If your dog is living it would be very weird, if not maybe not so much, but it may bring back sad memories of it passing<br>  name her Haley, so it isn't the same but similar|`|gX40pgLyaa	is da dog still alive?|`|K0Oh0p6Daa	Its not weird. If u and ur husband love it I say run with that idea. But if u want some names. Arianna and anayah are gd names sisnce ur name starts with an A.|`|XCX8w4LMaa	i don't think it's weird unless u go around telling everyone that u had a dog named hali.<br>  but otherwise, i don't think it's weird at all.
8WbfmK5daa	Out of your combinations I like Emily and Ellie the best.<br>  <br>  If it was out of any of them name then I prefer Megan and Emily.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|BOJEbnCtaa	Megan and Ellie|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	I like Austin, Megan and Emily the best<br>  <br>  out of your choice<br>  Megan, Ellie an Austin|`|ns1F0p8Laa	Taylor and Gesala (gee-say-la)|`|Nieu9Oowaa	destiny and abbie|`|cErLq7f3aa	Megan and Ellie|`|CMuL7XpKaa	Abby & Ella|`|R8bXuLbTaa	ellie n abbie|`|sOkePjK3aa	Abbie and Ellie!<br>  <br>  Emily and Ellie are too similar, especially if they are identical, other people might have a difficult time with that!|`|mBHQEzd1aa	Cherie and Terie|`|9bZbyhmjaa	None of those.

And on the more serious side, these 3 names sound the best together like im sure your growing family will be.   I also think that if yo took the second option and made it Megan, A____, and austin, that it would sound nice also.|`|E6tkzPsbaa	Personally, I like Emily and Ellie. They both start with the same letter so that's really cute, but also there's a difference in the names so you won't get them confused. Plus, Austin, Emily, and Ellie sound so good together! Good luck!|`|40b38b62d7defc90cd285a9a06a65e69aa	What doeas the last name start with?<br>  <br>  Anyway, Destiny is cute.<br>  <br>  How about...Destiny Faith, and Emilee Megan (or Morgan) (or Emilee Hope)<br>  <br>  (Austin, Destiny, and Emilee)|`|PG2i5Ee6aa	Emily and Elli.

o0Q7LmMsaa	yes i have so many of them<br>  i started to write in my diary when i was in kindergarten<br>  because my teacher made us write in journals and from then on i started to.<br>  <br>  i write everything in them lol.<br>  especially if i'm mad, or happy etc<br>  and yes i do draw in them too<br>  <br>  i haven't wrote in a diary in over a year though|`|kRaVa0Wraa	no i dont.<br>  although i might make one.<br>  like online or something though so my parents couldnt read it.<br>  hmm..|`|emkT1a6raa	I have one, and it is buried under my pajamas in my draw. I write in it when i can't sleep or when i just need to vent. My BFF got it for me 3 years ago, and it's filled with memories. I draw how i<br>  m feeling. Sounds weird, but it's just me :) I write about how my dad was/went..and what i wish was/wasn't happening =]|`|Osn1xpu6aa	I like to call it my journal.<br>  it does help me a lot....besides i love writing.<br>  i write about my day, my thoughts, poems, anything<br>  yeah i draw in it too if the fancy strikes me.|`|FGZR9RwDaa	nope i don't.|`|xpUyH0psaa	nope|`|kc2Sa7ibaa	Yep :) I mainly write lists. Aspiration lists, wants, goals, to - do lists. I like listing things lol. I draw a few things like hearts and spirals, animals and a few crazy murals are in there. I actually take it to school with me and am known for just pulling it out and start sketching lol That one doesn't have much privacy.<br>  <br>  There is another one that doesn't and will not ever leave my room ever. It is more like a "dear diary" diary but it doesn't get used often. Only when I am really angry. :P I don't let people read that one though. It is my venting book.|`|QGkBZFqWaa	Well I kept a journal once. I wrote most of my things about Cody. I guess I'll have to start writing again since we just broke up on tuesday and I'm going to just be miserable without him until I have him back. <br>  <br>  :'[<br>  <br>  When I look back at my old journal it makes me kind of upset since Cody and I have been through alot over the past year and a half.|`|H0sPCJQPaa	No, I do not have a diary<br>  I wish I could start one.<br>  <br>  I try but I never stay commited to it :(|`|DWl8nfyWaa	I do not.  I've tried to, though.|`|EccBqsntaa	No..I had over 20 diaries as a little kid...They all got lost/broken/forgotten.|`|ZllkWRIOaa	No to all.|`|J3H3C5ksaa	Does a blog count?|`|oj1TszL2aa	Yes, I do, and I've kept one for nearly 10 years now (since I was a pre-teen). <br>  <br>  It helps me to reflect on what I'm feeling, as I sometimes find it easier to express myself in writing rather than in speech - things somehow look more ordered and logical when they're set down on paper. I also find it useful to write about anything that has bothered me or upset me during the day, as by writing it down and then closing the diary I feel as if I am putting it to rest and don't need to be bothered by it any more. When I write down happy things, things that I've enjoyed or just little things that have made me smile, I like that I can look back on them when I'm feeling sad and it cheers me up a little. I like that I can write down ideas or quotes that I find inspirational, and then they are always there for me to look back on. I also find sometimes that it helps to read back through my old diaries, and to realise how far I've come, both literally and emotionally, since I was that age. I hope that if I have children myself it will help me to be more understanding of them when they are teenagers, since I will be able to look back through my diaries and remember what I was like myself when I was that age. <br>  <br>  As I've kind of said above, I tend to write a little bit about my day, but mainly it will be about my reflections - conversations that I've had with people, things that I've noticed and liked, ideas, quotatations or books that have inspired me, things that I want to do in the future - films I want to see, places I want to visit, books I want to read, plays I want to see. <br>  <br>  I also draw in my diary, or sometimes doodle, but only normally when I'm really upset or stressed out and I can't really express how I'm feeling in words. When I was younger I used to write poetry or bits of song lyrics (that I'd written myself) in it as well (though I guess that comes under the category of writing) although I don't do that any more. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  x|`|JAZWe8A6aa	I don't necessarily keep a "diary" but I do write a lot. I've tried having a diary, and just couldn't stay committed to writing in it everyday. I usually write when I'm upset about something, so I've kinda made a journal for when I'm upset and need to write. That way, it's not stored on my computer or anything. <br>  <br>  It helps me by just venting what I'm feeling and not have anyone arguing with me about anything I say I'm able to keep it completely private and write whatever I please. <br>  <br>  Like I've said above, I just write out my anger.<br>  <br>  Personally, I really can't draw, so no I do not draw anything in it.|`|qJPiyGdqaa	no.<br>  i dont have diary <br>  or online diary!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  [:|`|b30a67bb9890faa58afa5ef3c9a79a91aa	I've attempted to have a diary...I wrote it in consistently for about one week after I bought it (I was in first grade haha!) but afterwards, my entries became less frequent and I haven't even wrote in it for a year.<br>  <br>  But I think people who keep a diary everyday have something to look forward to reading in the future - I love reading all my old emails, for example. xD When I did keep a diary, though, I used to draw little illustrations of the boys I had crushes on and wrote little stories about funny life events.|`|6EP71A7Baa	Yes I normally do about once a week. It's normally when I have loads on my mind or I can't stop thinking about something so I right it down (like instead of telling someone). <br>  I usually try and write about interesting stuff that's going on so when i read back on it I'm actually interested in what I'm reading.<br>  Errrrm, I decorate it with things and stuff but not pictures. I sometimes stick things in. I'm thinking about putting some pictures in it too.|`|6gthdHpnaa	Yes. I sometimes write for a while, then I stuff it in a box and forget aoutb it, so it's not onstant. I loe going ak and reading the funny stuff I said when I was 7 or 8 and writing a diary. One from when I was 8 says, "We went to a yard sale. I got an ocean boy." For some reason that makes me laugh, since I have no idea what an ocean boy is.|`|AA10673927	Yes I do. I write about my day, what happened at school, stuff about my friends, funny stories, anything and everything. It helps me remember my past self, and it's really fun to keep track of. I doodle sometimes and occasionally write down poetry, quotes, and song lyrics.<br>  <br>  [:|`|iFXe1Obvaa	Yes I do.<br>  It doesn't help, I don't know why I write. I write about thoughts I have when I can't sleep. I draw on pieces of paper throughout the day and shove them in a little folder in the back of my journal.|`|9xocw9jpaa	i had like about 2 diaries, but that was middle school/beginning of high school.

DDIBEvUTaa	Haven't tried it- I got tired of the velcro on my gdiaper covers- but i just bought a couple packs of gerber toddler training pants to put over the prefolds...I can't remember the name of the tool right now- but it's kind of like pliers but for pressing snap buttons onto fabric.  I think they're around $10 give or take a couple $.  It would be in the notions section of a craft/sewing store.  The snaps would be metal.  Very easy & shouldn't cost too much.  <br>  hope that helps : )<br>  edit- I want to say "eyelet" something or other...
PLbmKNpvaa	Sadly I think the only one that can do anything about this is your sister :/<br>  If you were to step up and say "Hang on, that's not fair!" they might get really miffed. Particularly the mother in law, she may feel that it's her RIGHT to throw the baby shower because it's her grandchild.<br>  Perhaps your sister needs to just let her know that she wants you to be involved because you're her sister and it's a journey that you've shared together for some time so she'd like you to feel included.<br>  I'm sorry you have to deal with that, it should be a happy time and to have someone stick their nose in where it isn't wanted always causes dramas :(
JAZWe8A6aa	As far as your stress goes, join the club. This last week has been really overwhelming for me; state testing, friends trying to start drama, mother driving me up a wall, that time of the month, and just the pressure of trying to do well in school. <br>  <br>  I am an ex-cutter so I know how you feel. To me, cutting actually did alleviate the pain but I know it was wrong to do. I'm glad you have realized that early. You seriously don't want to become a cutter, it's not a good idea. As far as telling your therapist, I think that's a decision you should make for yourself. You won't get in "trouble" but he/she probably will have to tell your mom because you are harming yourself and by law the legal guardians need to know. <br>  <br>  Also, I have had past suicide attempts and when I told my school counselor about the cutting of course she told my mom. I don't think that you'll be admitted to a hospital though, unless you actually make them think that you are going to try to harm yourself. I was admitted to a mental hospital last year and it actually helped me a lot. As far as the cutting goes though, I'm glad you've realized how bad it is. <br>  <br>  So the ultimate decision is yours of whether you want to tell your therapist. You most likely will not be admitted into a mental hospital, but I can't say I'm 100% sure. It all depends on the stability of the situation. I'm thirteen as well by the way... <br>  <br>  I'd really be interested in talking with you, sounds like we have a lot of the same problems. If you choose to email me, my email is 'elysehewitt1995@rocketmail.com' I'm free anytime. Almost always online, so just message me whenever if you choose to.|`|abELhjcoaa	glad you realized it wasnt for you, tell the therapist, they can give you much better coping mechanisms, and no one cut wont put you in the psych ward, but its better to tell.|`|jV1Ma10jaa	you should tell someone about it but it sounds like you are doing this solidly for attention...|`|In11WOTSaa	STOP and yes tell someone because if you would have cut to deep you could have died. its a stupied thing to do. it might feel good to see the pain come out but in the end you will end up hurting your self more. From 2 people personal experance including mine and my friends; its not going to help you; you will now always have those scares; every time you get deperesed about something one talk to someone two make a list of things that you can be grateful for three look at those scares and ask your self is it really worth maybe loosing your life.|`|nBl71aN8aa	here is my advice. I cut myself sometimes. The first time i did it, my reaction was like yours, what the hell, i'm so stupid, i'm never gonna do this again. I didn't keep that promise, and now I struggle a lot more when i'm sad, because my reaction is to try to cut myself. My own pride keeps me from seeking help, but if you can, you should seek help. You don't know if you're gonna have common sense the next time you are really sad and frustrated. Tell your therapist, you want to get better, not be concerned about what's gonna happen if it is known you cut yourself.|`|H41u0B8Jaa	You won't be put in a psych ward if you tell your therapist.  Right now you say you are out of that mood and will never cut yourself again, but who's to say that the mood won't strike you again some other time in the future?  I'd say it would be a good idea to mention it to your therapist since it is important to share this type of information so your therapy can be as effective as possible.  It is good you realized what you did was wrong...be sure to mention that to your therapist as well.  It would be good to talk about why you thought cutting might help in the first place.  That is the real issue here.   You were fortunate you didn't cause real harm to yourself.|`|1RwZZ2aPaa	Okay, calm down. Take a couple deep breaths. You don't have to tell anyone, but you really probably should. And please, try not to get suicidal. I know this sounds cheesy, but the world wouldn't be as bright without you. Go ahead and laugh. xD|`|nzyOCsOiaa	your owwie?<br>  hahahahahhahahahahaha.<br>  well you know, you did what you did.<br>  And no, cutters don't get put in psych wards.<br>  But if you do try really killing yourself, you probably will need better counseling.|`|AB5erhhUaa	You need consuling.|`|EWFtQNSdaa	You need councelling.<br>  And stop cutting yourself.|`|pIzC411yaa	oh your not crazy, I did that once but not in depression. I was bored and wondered what all the emo kids like about it so I took a kitchen knife and ran it down my arm it didn't even pierce the skin so I did it all over my arm because I figured it was dull and it tickled. then like 10 minutes later  it all started bleeding i was like holy ****! how did that happen? Anyway, as long as you know it was wrong or just did it because you are extremely impulsive like I am, you're good. nothing wrong with you.
cKKUViZCaa	1st... you just got on the pill, but couldn't wait?<br>  2nd... that was dumb<br>  3rd... the pill is going to screw up your system quite a bit, it'll be a bit until your system gets into sync... the whole time, you'll be wondering if you'll be pregnant. A home prego test won't tell you you're pregnant for a few weeks.<br>  Good luck with that|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	its too early to be noticing symptoms yet enough to know you are preg, wait until you skip your period and take a test, alot of those symptoms also come with diabetes and any number of things, or you could be noticing things that are only kinda there since you only KINDA had unprotected sex and are worried about being preg so you are hyper sensitive|`|cSm1zod4aa	really isnt a such thing as 1 week pregnant. <br>  If you miss your period take a test or go to the doctor.<br>  go to www.i-am-pregnant.com<br>  click on week by week<br>  click on week 1-3.|`|lmG2hCIqaa	congrats youre a baby having a babyyy|`|AA10153923	If its only a week you will not show symptoms.|`|3irrWRUWaa	you never know until you get that pregnancy test.|`|35kVNi5oaa	take a test|`|kpiNnkoMaa	it sounds like you are pregnant. <br>  how can you kinda have unprotectid sex. <br>  but it is to early to take a test i think.<br>  did you miss a peariod?|`|EmhBDHMtaa	how do you KINDA have unprotected sex? anyway wait until you are late to test. plus it's too early to have all those symptoms. you usually don't get those until 6-8weeks|`|wK4kqhHkaa	Pregnancy symptoms can all be symptoms of other things as well.|`|7zMtmKJaaa	if you are only a week pregnant, its too early to have symptoms. take a test.|`|Maho3P5kaa	how can you kind of have unprotected sex? <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  yes your symptoms say your pregnant. did you miss a period?<br>  <br>  <br>  just go take a test|`|jqOpIu5zaa	very well yes. but to be sure wait a few more weeks.|`|HlCXIRMiaa	very much indeed|`|bb7b4M9Xaa	It's really hard to say because you are on the pill. Its most likely  that you wouldn't be pregnant because of the pill but it is possible. in saying that though all the symptoms you are experiencing could just be due to hormones and or you might be going to get your period. All the symptoms you are describing are found to be pregnancy symptoms but like i said they could be due to a period being on its way. Can i also just say it is rare to get symptoms that early. take a test|`|B6EpHU1Waa	The pill is only 98% effective if you take it every single day and your body is fully adjusted (it takes about 2 months)<br>  So yes, you could be pregnant. You won't know for sure until you get your period or take a pregnancy test.|`|9b34894f39784ed0f97fdaae81fa480caa	Those sound like all the symptoms to me.

LbkLg4RFaa	I was 27 when I had my first.  Most of the girls I went to school with had their first after 25 or still haven't had a baby.  A lot of the women in my anti-natal class where my age or older.  There are a lot of mothers out there that have had their first baby beyond 30 even 40.  I think it's perfectly fine to have a first baby at 27.|`|IXBl5l5kaa	My cousin is 28 and will be having her first child this month and they wish to have a few more so as long as she is healthy and has a good healthcare provider she should be just fine.|`|lGKq9NXbaa	compared to the people having kids in their late thirties no.|`|Bw18seFqaa	I had my first baby at 27.. I dont really consider that "older"..  I did not have many complications during my pregnancy, and delivery was fine.<br>  <br>  I wouldnt consider it "older" until around 30-35 years and up..  the risk for complications increases then.<br>  <br>  I think the problem is that there are so many young mothers who are having babies in their teens, or right out of high school, that its unusual to see someone waiting until their mid-late 20's to have a baby.|`|hBxmFnqNaa	i don't think it is old at all<br>  one can have baby between the age of 18-40<br>  after 40 it would be older<br>  i think late twenties is the best age to have a baby|`|pzLDXL6gaa	No, that's ridiculous.

Maybe if you live on the FLDS ranch or lived one hundred years ago. But these days, if you consider the time it takes to get a college education and then find an appropriate mate, I'd say that 27 is on the young side.|`|1VdgsZPoaa	No, too old to have a baby is over 40, IMO.  25 is about the norm to be starting your family.  Anything younger is really (once again IMO) still too young.|`|Ks7lENScaa	No.  That is a nice age.  Her OB said that.  That is odd.  I would change OB doctors if I was her.|`|3hIr3Dllaa	not at all<br>  <br>  I was 30 with my first and I'm on the younger side in my mommy and baby groups|`|d6GvS2Dpaa	Absolutely not!

Sometimes OB's aren't very nice. Mine called me fat.|`|mSMDWj5Taa	nope no way. it's more common now for people to have their first child in their 30's now actually|`|hQ8uCFqEaa	27 is not old these days...its young! look at new hollywood moms|`|dUMErCGzaa	defiantly not! that's a fine age!<br>  Congrats to her  =)
HXfHkoSHaa	I don't think I fully get your question, but a good parent should feel a surpassing love for all his/her children.

fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	<a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/supply/low-supply.html#supply" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/supply/low-su...</a><br>  Is your milk supply really low?<br>  <br>  First of all, is your milk supply really low? Often, mothers think that their milk supply is low when it really isn't. If your baby is gaining weight well on breastmilk alone, then you do not have a problem with milk supply.<br>  It's important to note that the feel of the breast, the behavior of your baby, the frequency of nursing, the sensation of let-down, or the amount you pump are not valid ways to determine if you have enough milk for your baby.<br>  <br>  What if you're not quite sure about baby's current weight gain (perhaps baby hasn't had a weight check lately)? If baby is having an adequate number of wet and dirty diapers then the following things do NOT mean that you have a low milk supply:<br>  <br>      * Your baby nurses frequently. Breastmilk is digested quickly (usually in 1.5-2 hours), so breastfed babies need to eat more often than formula-fed babies. Many babies have a strong need to suck. Also, babies often need continuous contact with mom in order to feel secure. All these things are normal, and you cannot spoil your baby by meeting these needs.<br>      * Your baby suddenly increases the frequency and/or length of nursings. This is often a growth spurt. The baby nurses more (this usually lasts a few days to a week), which increases your milk supply. Don't offer baby supplements when this happens: supplementing will inform your body that the baby doesn't need the extra milk, and your supply will drop.<br>      * Your baby nurses more often and is fussy in the evening.<br>      * Your baby doesn't nurse as long as she did previously. As babies get older and better at nursing, they become more efficient at extracting milk.<br>      * Your baby is fussy. Many babies have a fussy time of day - often in the evening. Some babies are fussy much of the time. This can have many reasons, and sometimes the fussiness goes away before you find the reason.<br>      * Your baby guzzles down a bottle of formula or expressed milk after nursing. Many babies will willingly take a bottle even after they have a full feeding at the breast. Read more here from board-certified lactation consultant Kathy Kuhn about why baby may do this and how this can affect milk supply. Of course, if you regularly supplement baby after nursing, your milk supply will drop (see below).<br>      * Your breasts don't leak milk, or only leak a little, or stop leaking. Leaking has nothing to do with your milk supply. It often stops after your milk supply has adjusted to your baby's needs.<br>      * Your breasts suddenly seem softer. Again, this normally happens after your milk supply has adjusted to your baby's needs.<br>      * You never feel a let-down sensation, or it doesn't seem as strong as before. Some women never feel a let-down. This has nothing to do with milk supply.<br>      * You get very little or no milk when you pump. The amount of milk that you can pump is not an accurate measure of your milk supply. A baby with a healthy suck milks your breast much more efficiently than any pump. Also, pumping is an acquired skill (different than nursing), and can be very dependent on the type of pump. Some women who have abundant milk supplies are unable to get any milk when they pump. In addition, it is very common and normal for pumping output to decrease over time. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/babyconcerns/fussy-evening.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/babyconcerns/fus...</a><br>   Cluster feeding, also called bunch feeding, is when babies space feeding closer together at certain times of the day and go longer between feedings at other times. This is very common, and often occurs in the evenings. It's often -but not always- followed by a longer sleep period than usual: baby may be "tanking up" before a long sleep. For example, your baby may nurse every hour (or even constantly) between 6 and 10 PM, then have a longish stretch of sleep at night - baby may even sleep all night.<br>  <br>  Cluster feeding often coincides with your baby's fussy time. Baby will nurse a few minutes, pull off, fuss/cry, nurse a few minutes, pull off, fuss/cry... on and on... for hours. This can be VERY frustrating, and mom starts wondering if baby is getting enough milk, if something she is eating is bothering baby, if EVERYTHING she is doing is bothering baby... It can really ruin your confidence, particularly if there is someone else around asking the same questions (your mother, your husband, your mother-in-law).<br>  <br>  This behavior is NORMAL!    It has nothing to do with your breastmilk or your mothering. If baby is happy the rest of the day, and baby doesn't seem to be in pain (as with colic) during the fussy time - just keep trying to soothe your baby and don't beat yourself up about the cause. Let baby nurse as long and as often as he will. Recruit dad (or another helper) to bring you food/drink and fetch things (book/remote/phone/etc.) while you are nursing and holding baby.<br>  Does this mean that baby needs more milk than I can provide?<br>  <br>  No. Don't give baby a bottle -- supplementation will only tell your body that you need LESS milk at this time, and that will not help matters. Also, keep in mind that formula fed babies experience fussy periods in the evening, too -- fussy evenings are common for all young babies, no matter how they are fed. The Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine spells this out in their supplementary feeding guidelines:<br>  <br>      There are common clinical situations where evaluation and breastfeeding management may be necessary, but supplementation is NOT INDICATED including... The infant who is fussy at night or constantly feeding for several hours.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.todaysparent.com/article.jsp?content=1266685" rel="nofollow">http://www.todaysparent.com/article.jsp?...</a><br>   Wiessinger believes that counting and timing feedings may only make a nursing mother feel more stressed about what she thinks she needs to accomplish during the day. The reality, however, might actually be quite different since, as Wiessinger points out, frequent feedings tend to be short and easy to fit around other activities.<br>  <br>  Anthropologist Kathy Dettwyler from Texas A&M University says that nursing a lot is typical of babies around the world. She cites a study done in 2000 that looked at the feeding behaviour of infants aged three to four months in three different communities: families from Washington, DC, the Ba’Aka hunter-gatherers and the Ngandu farmers, both of the Central African Republic. They found that the Ba’Aka babies nursed 4.02 times per hour, the Ngandu babies nursed 2.01 times per hour and the American babies nursed 1.6 times per hour. Certainly the American babies nursed less often than the two African groups, but they nursed more frequently than many new parents expect.<br>  <br>  Wiessinger reminds parents that babies are growing faster in the first year than they will at any other time in their lives, and asks, “How often would you eat if you were trying to double your weight in less than six months?” She adds that breastfeeding is more than a way of getting food into the baby. “A baby doesn’t necessarily nurse to eat,” she explains. “Breastfeeding offers so many other wonderful things — skin-to-skin contact, warmth, the reassuring sounds and smells of mom, suckling — the milk is just a bonus.” <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.normalfed.com/Continuing/hungry.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.normalfed.com/Continuing/hung...</a><br>  How many times did you eat or drink something today?  Coffee break?  Water fountain?  Gum?  Snack?  TV nibblies?  Most adults have an urge to eat about every 90 minutes while they're awake!<br>  <br>      Why do you eat or drink?  Hunger?  Thirst?  Comfort?  For social reasons?  Just because?<br>  <br>      Are you trying to gain weight?  If you had to double your weight in 6 months, how would you do it?  Would you drink water?  Chew sugarless gum between meals?  Eat large meals at long intervals?  Or would you do lots and lots of snacking, day and night? <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kathydettwyler.org/detsleepthrough.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kathydettwyler.org/detsleepth...</a><br>  Human children are designed (whether you believe by millions of years of evolution, or by God, it doesn't matter) -- to nurse *very* frequently, based on the composition of the milk of the species, the fact that all higher primates (Primates are the zoological Order to which humans belong, higher primates include monkeys and apes) keep their offspring in the mother's arms or on her back for several years, the size of the young child's stomach, the rapidity with which breast milk is digested, the need for an almost constant source of nutrients to grow that huge brain (in humans, especially), and so on. By very frequently, I mean 3-4 times per hour, for a few minutes each time. The way in which some young infants are fed in our culture -- trying to get them to shift to a 3-4 hour schedule, with feedings of 15-20 minutes at a time, goes against our basic physiology. But humans are very adaptable, and some mothers will be able to make sufficient milk with this very infrequent stimulation and draining of the breasts, and some children will be able to adapt to large meals spaced far apart. Unfortunately, some mothers don't make enough milk with this little nursing, and some babies can't adjust, and so are fussy, cry a lot, seem to want to nurse "before it is time" and fail to grow and thrive. Of course, usually the mother's body is blamed -- "You can't make enough milk" -- rather than the culturally-imposed expectation that feeding every 3-4 hours should be sufficient, and the mother begins supplementing with formula, which leads to a steady spiral downward to complete weaning from the breast.|`|hQ8uCFqEaa	she not only does it for hunger, but for comfort as well!

qMI6H6Lbaa	i am guessing that she is pretty far along? it is normal to not be able to get comfortable during pregnancy. I suggest to go get her a snuggle pillow from babiesrus. i got one there they are pricy i know i spend i think about $60 or so on mine but i love it. it has completely helpted me ( but saddly has replaced my husband who was usually my cuddly pillow  lol) but i get good sleep now. and i have a pregnancy wedge that you can get at just about any maternity store for 15-25 dollars that wedges under her belly so her belly doesnt seam like it is all having gravity push toward the ground|`|h5cFkP35aa	it's pretty normal especially toward the end of pregnancy. tylenol pm worked great for me and it's safe during pregnancy. if that doesn't work, you need to see a doctor. good luck.|`|3irrWRUWaa	three days is a long time to not sleep at all. she has insomnia. i had it a few times when i was pregnant too. i hope she gets to sleep tonight.|`|35kVNi5oaa	give her warm milk|`|wK4kqhHkaa	this is one of the wonderful symptoms of pregnancy and prepares the mother for the many sleepless nights after baby is born.    She needs to experiment with different sleeping positions, to find out what is most comfortable.  Make sure she is doing some daily exercise.  It might just be something you will have to wait out.|`|igbdywwVaa	Definitely talk to your OB if you haven't already. You could try the doctor on-call. How far along is she?<br>  <br>  I'm having trouble already and I'm still early. I'm just uncomfortable, constantly nauseous, and have stomach pain. I often have tears running down my face as I lie awake trying to sleep. So, I feel for her. But 3 days and NO SLEEP is definitely scary. Does she sleep better during the morning hours or during the day?<br>  <br>  Hope things get better for her. Good luck!|`|58G7ZAJpaa	As mentioned, see an OB if you haven't yet done so. <br>  <br>  I, too, suffer from lack of sleep.  I'm 29w1d and am SOOO uncomfortable, and typically a belly sleeper at that.  I'm up every two hours to pee, and once I get up, I lay in bed for quite a while trying to get back to sleep.<br>  <br>  Have her try a warm relaxing bath before she lays down for the night.  dim lights, maybe a few candles.  Bubble baths with a lavender aroma are wonderful.  Helps for a few hours at least.<br>  <br>  I don't recommend OTC drugs unless its absolutely necessary.  You don't want her becoming dependent on them because she found that's the only way to get some sleep.  <br>  <br>  Hope you both get some rest!  Good luck!|`|ZWVvtIK8aa	oh dear, is she just uncomfortable? tell her to try sleeping in different places around the house. lots of pillows! try melatonin, that should knock her out too, and its very safe. they should have it in any supplement section. good luck!|`|aG1FZ7aDaa	I'm the same way, because im 7 weeks... I just think we have trouble sleeping because of all the changes|`|sYsfI856aa	Pregnancy insomnia.... been there. Tell her to try to take some benedryl, it's what my doctor told me to do. It's not harmful to the baby and can be taken any trimester. Have her take one and then curl up with a book or soothing music, in a dimly lit room. Just have her get away from any hustle and bustle of the household and relax after taking it.  Warm bath before taking one may help as well, and maybe you could be a sweet bf and massage her softly while she lays in bed after taking one, this can help lull her to sleep.<br>  <br>  It may take some time, but if the benedryl doesn't help, she'll want to go to her doctor cause pregnant women need sleep to help grow that baby and to function :D Good luck!|`|eemmWU0Haa	rub her back and touche her body and make love to her and do whatever it is she wants you to do, or better yet, go see a dr....lol

I use cloth diapers along with regular diapers and that has cut down a lot of expense.  Breast feeding is free.  You can make your own baby food and it is much healthier and a LOT less expensive than store bought jars.  The expensive things with babies tends to be diapers and formula if you bottle feed.  I would put the cost for us at around 100-150 dollars a month for our 7 month old son if that.  It's when they get older that they get expensive.

No earlier than that!|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	AFTER 6 months when the baby meets all the signs of readiness.<br>  <br>  For healthy, full term infants the ability to eat food develops around 6-9 months. In recent years there have been numerous studies looking at the risks of certain things (allergies, asthma, anemia, etc) in relation to when solids are started and almost all have shown that the lowest risks are when solids are started between 6-9 months.<br>  <br>  However it should also be noted that babies with allergies may refuse solids for up to a year, and that breastmilk is nutritionally complete for at least the first year of life despite earlier statements that it is not. An unpleasant feeling in the mouth is often a first sign of allergy and may cause babies to spit out rather than swallow allergenic foods.

This subject keeps coming up, and the answer is still the same: the current recommendations (I didn’t make these up) are to wait until six months before starting solids. Starting foods too early can result in digestive or allergy problems later in life. We have learned that the old guidelines of 4 months are just too soon, and I am willing to bet that in ten years we will be recommending later than 6 months.

A baby who is struggling to get food into his mouth is probably not quite ready to eat it.<br>  <br>  Pureed baby food is 'unnatural'<br>  <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/676279..." rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/676279...</a><br>  She said children should be fed only with breast or formula milk for six months, then weaned onto solids to improve control over how much they ate.<br>  <br>  This could prevent babies becoming picky about food.<br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>  Solids best<br>  <br>  After six months, Mrs Rapley said babies were capable of taking food into their mouths and chewing it.<br>  <br>  Therefore, feeding them pureed food at this time could delay the development of chewing skills.<br>  <br>  Instead, she said, they should be given milk and solid pieces of food which they could chew.<br>  <br>  Mrs Rapley argued that babies fed pureed food had little control over how much food they ate, thus rendering them vulnerable to constipation, and running a risk that they would react by becoming fussy eaters later in life.<br>  <br>  She blamed the food industry for convincing parents that they should give children pureed food.<br>  <br>  She said: "Sound scientific research and government advice now agree that there is no longer any window of a baby's development in which they need something more than milk and less than solids."<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.borstvoeding.com/voedselintro..." rel="nofollow">http://www.borstvoeding.com/voedselintro...</a><br>  The babies who participated in the research were allowed to begin at four months. But they were not able to feed themselves before six months. Some of the younger babies picked food up and took it to their mouths; some even chewed it, but none swallowed it. Their own development decided for them when the time was right. Part of the reason for this study was to show (based on a theory of self-feeding) that babies are not ready for solid food before six months. It seems that we have spent all these years working out that six months is the right age and babies have known it all along!<br>  <br>  It seems reasonable to predict that if parents choose to provide babies with the opportunity to pick up and eat solid food from birth they will still not be able to do it until around six months. The principle is the same as putting a newborn baby on the floor to play: he is being provided with the opportunity to walk but will not do so until about one year – because his own development stops him. But: everything depends on the baby being in control. Food must not be put into his mouth for him. Since it is very tempting to do this, it is probably safer to recommend that babies should not be given the opportunity to eat solid food before six months.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.borstvoeding.com/voedselintro..." rel="nofollow">http://www.borstvoeding.com/voedselintro...</a><br>  Many parents worry about babies choking. However, there is good reason to believe that babies are at less risk of choking if they are in control of what goes into their mouth than if they are spoon fed. This is because babies are not capable of intentionally moving food to the back of their throats until after they have learnt to chew. And they do not develop the ability to chew until after they have developed the ability to reach out and grab things. Thus, a very young baby cannot easily put himself at risk because he cannot get the food into his mouth in the first place. On the other hand, the action used to suck food off a spoon tends to take the food straight to the back of the mouth, causing the baby to gag. This means that spoon feeding has its own potential to lead to choking – and makes one wonder about the safety of giving lumpy foods off a spoon.<br>  <br>  Why not cereal?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9646449/page..." rel="nofollow">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9646449/page...</a><br>  Take rice cereal, for example. Under conventional American wisdom, it's the best first food. But Butte says iron-rich meat — often one of the last foods American parents introduce — would be a better choice.<br>  <br>  Dr. David Ludwig of Children's Hospital Boston, a specialist in pediatric nutrition, says some studies suggest rice and other highly processed grain cereals actually could be among the worst foods for infants.<br>  <br>  "These foods are in a certain sense no different from adding sugar to formula. They digest very rapidly in the body into sugar, raising blood sugar and insulin levels" and could contribute to later health problems, including obesity, he says.<br>  <br>  The lack of variety in the American approach also could be a problem. Exposing infants to more foods may help them adapt to different foods later, which Ludwig says may be key to getting older children to eat healthier.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/solids..." rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/solids...</a><br>  Cereal is not at all necessary, particularly the baby cereals. Regular (whole grain) oatmeal is more nutritious for your baby.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/faq/ci2.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.askdrsears.com/faq/ci2.asp</a><br>  The truth is, there is nothing special about these foods that makes them better to start out with. Babies don't actually even need rice cereal<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.llli.org/llleaderweb/LV/LVDec..." rel="nofollow">http://www.llli.org/llleaderweb/LV/LVDec...</a><br>  Meat provides additional protein, zinc, B-vitamins, and other nutrients which may be in short supply when the decrease in breast milk occurs. A recent study from Sweden suggests that when infants are given substantial amounts of cereal, it may lead to low concentrations of zinc and reduced calcium absorption (Persson 1998). Dr. Nancy Krebs has shared preliminary results from a large infant growth study suggesting that breastfed infants who received pureed or strained meat as a primary weaning food beginning at four to five months, grow at a slightly faster rate. Dr. Krebs' premise is that inadequate protein or zinc from complementary foods may limit the growth of some breastfed infants during the weaning period. Both protein and zinc levels were consistently higher in the diets of the infants who received meat (Krebs 1998). Thus the custom of providing large amounts of cereal products and excluding meat products before seven months of age may not meet the nutritional needs of all breastfed infants.<br>  Meat has also been recommended as an excellent source of iron in infancy. Heme iron (the form of iron found in meat) is better absorbed than iron from plant sources. In addition, the protein in meat helps the baby more easily absorb the iron from other foods. Two recent studies (Makrides 1998; Engelmann 1998) have examined iron status in breastfed infants who received meat earlier in the weaning period. These studies indicate that while there is not a measurable change in breastfed babies' iron stores when they receive an increased amount of meat (or iron), the levels of hemoglobin circulating in the blood stream do increase when babies receive meat as one of their first foods.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.westonaprice.org/children/nou..." rel="nofollow">http://www.westonaprice.org/children/nou...</a><br>  Finally, respect the tiny, still-developing digestive system of your infant. Babies have limited enzyme production, which is necessary for the digestion of foods. In fact, it takes up to 28 months, just around the time when molar teeth are fully developed, for the big-gun carbohydrate enzymes (namely amylase) to fully kick into gear. Foods like cereals, grains and breads are very challenging for little ones to digest. Thus, these foods should be some of the last to be introduced. (One carbohydrate enzyme a baby's small intestine does produce is lactase, for the digestion of lactose in milk.1)<br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>  Babies do produce functional enzymes (pepsin and proteolytic enzymes) and digestive juices (hydrochloric acid in the stomach) that work on proteins and fats.12 This makes perfect sense since the milk from a healthy mother has 50-60 percent of its energy as fat, which is critical for growth, ene|`|EHY3FnAmaa	Honestly, it really depends on the baby.

67Lvls2zaa	Don't worry about being normal - like, EVER. To be quite honest - sure, most girls these days have fancied at least one guy by thirteen. But it's fine if you're fifteen and haven't found a guy you're interested in. Maybe you're picky. So what? You could be more mature than them, and therefore not interested in relationships just yet. Or it's possible that your hormones haven't kicked in. Most likely, you haven't found someone special enough. I fell pretty hard on my first real crush. After that, they were all just... guys. They were nothing in comparison to my first crush even after I got over him. It's not until much later, though, that I had truly deep feelings for anyone. Everyone is different with these things and you don't want to rush it. A lot of young girls think it's important to be like everyone else and rush themselves into being someone they aren't and doing things they'll later regret.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Yeah. I didn't really start caring until late into my 14th year.|`|LMRaSXFeaa	yes, it is very normal.|`|kc2Sa7ibaa	Hah! I wasn't at 13 either. Now I am but that is only a year later. Just wait until someone that you REALLY like comes along :) I think it is special because you haven't had a crush on every single guy in the year level. You are normal, don't worry :)|`|QGkBZFqWaa	Yeah you're fine. It's hard for me to like a guy for some reason. I'm still really attached to my ex boyfriend.|`|VmLZFN4Taa	I am 13 and I don't like anyone yet..I see most of the guys at my school as friends anyway.|`|ZllkWRIOaa	Nothing wrong with that.|`|DoN0ayEFaa	You must be a bimbo if you think it's not normal to have a crush on a guy at age 13. 13 is young! I'm in my 20's and I never had a boyfriend. My friend had her first boyfriend at age 19. It's the sl*tty girls who are boy crazy and it's the sl*tty girls who have sex under age 18 and it's the sl*tty girls who have boyfriends at age 13.|`|JAZWe8A6aa	Yeah, I think that's perfectly normal. I'm thirteen and don't have a crush on any guys. I think in today's world of 2009, people don't necessarily actually "like" someone. I think it's just the peer pressure and people want to fit in and stuff. That's just my point of view though.<br>  <br>  But to officially answer your question, yes it is normal for a thirteen year old girl to not be interested in guys.|`|pIzC411yaa	You just have to find one guy you really like but don't listen to people who say guys are dirty we're all a little dirty but most of us just want someone cool to talk to making out is a bonus.|`|tQO9LW8Qaa	It's totally normal.

bf8lx9gxaa	It's possible to get pregnant at any time. But for most woman it's around 14 days before the day of your period. Basically it's around the time you ovulate. The time of ovulation varies from woman to woman. I would definately take a pregnancy test first thing in the morning. If it comes out negative wait a week and take another test, that is if you still haven't gotten your period. Anyways, I wish the very best of luck to you sweetie. Let me know how is goes. If you have any more questions or concerns, you can e-mail me any time.?|`|scdOdaTKaa	Anytime you have sex pregnancy is possible, but you are particlarly fertile around your ovulatoins days which vary from woman to woman.

Something where you go for one as a newborn, one when sitting and one when 1 year as a nice first year souvenir! <br>  <br>  If you choose to buy any clothes, the most helpful thing anyone did for me was buy clothes in bigger sizes (3-6 & 6-9).  Generally, parents are prepared with newborn/0-3 clothes... I found it useful having a few clothes lying around in bigger sizes to grab when Lukas was suddenly too big!|`|d4ac61414fc4c240b01f3cc34a7003c9aa	Buy her white short and long sleeved onesies in various sizes.|`|iNneJk47aa	She would probably love anything.|`|AA10893102	BIBS...the good kind (usually about ten dollars for a five pack).

I was really surprised that someone gave me the travel system that I registered for, but I doubt that happens very often.|`|DJMPQlFDaa	Diapers are always great. It all depends. I don't use high chairs or changing tables. So maybe a changing pad. I think some diaper bags have them included.

It makes the perfect gift for any mom!|`|YE3RREngaa	ask your friend where she has registered. Look for what she has listed wherever she has registered. That is your best bet for finding what she will need.<br>  <br>  Another good thing is diapers like a lot of people have said. you can never have too many diapers.<br>  <br>  But really you should just ask her or find her gift registry. A common place for  registry is Target. You can look it up on  target.com|`|qImMwhUHaa	Whatever she has on her registry.

cf59b7a86d3c85c41cac7a7189fbda41aa	If you have been on the pill for 5 years and you miss a day and had sex doesnt mean you will get pregnant. It is a very low percent that you are. It takes some time when you stop using the pill to get back on track with ovulation. But of course every women's body works differently. But I dont think you are for missing one day of 5 years on the pill. If you really want to know now and not risk babies health if you are pregnant, just go see a doctor to confirm. Good luck to you!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You don't ovualte when you are on the pill. Sperm can live in your body for 72 hours so as long as your didn't release an egg because of not taking the pill for a few days you won't be pregnant.

Birth control does not cause miscarriage but it can harm the baby in many many ways.|`|lGKq9NXbaa	you've been on the pill for a long time, your chances of being pregnant are very slim.|`|ZWVvtIK8aa	well im not on pills, so im not sure how that works, but i got pregnant while i was on day 4 of my period, and i thought you weren't fertile on your period, but i guess i was... and i even have long cycles!<br>  <br>  so i guess what i am saying is its possible|`|Tmr7f3Xgaa	About 3%. Why don't you want to get pregnant? A baby is a gift from God. I used to hang upside down after trying but it didn't work. Nothing worked.|`|BOqdtldyaa	i think you might still be in time to take that pill that will make it not get pregnant.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	Starting the next pack late can be a pretty big risk for pregnancy if you've just had sex. I'm not sure on time zones - how long will it have been from Friday for you? 3 days is too long. I would recommend the morning after pill but I guess you can't go and get that either. So all you can really do is start the pills when you can, and use condoms like you're planning. Good luck.<br>  <br>  Fertility calenders only apply to a normal cycle, your cycle is suppressed on the pill so it is not the same.<br>  <br>  Harriet
kaqPSgTVaa	You will notice. It will feel like all of the sudden you can breath again! :) That and your belly will look lower.|`|sYsfI856aa	They call it "lightening" you'll feel more space between your stomach and breast, uterus and lungs/ribs. Your belly will probably visibly be a bit lower, and you will feel heavier in the lower region, possibly feel some pressure, which will cause you to waddle even more now when you walk! It's a good feeling for some, others it can cause extra discomfort. Good rule of thumb is usually 4weeks or less before you are gonna have the baby you will drop. I dropped 4 weeks before having my son... (my mother dropped 3 weeks before having me) Not the same for all though!|`|ixmaM395aa	You'll start to feel more pressure on your pelvic bone, need to pee even more than you thought possible and your baby bump will be noticeably lower.

QYyLr0SKaa	well i babysit two kids, 6 and 8<br>  and they would give me 10$ per hour.<br>  so i think 10$ would be good.|`|ns1F0p8Laa	ask between 10-12 an hour|`|AA11123061	you can start by charging 5 dollar per hour . but if the kid requires extra attention then 10 dollars ..<br>  <br>  then later you can increase ur charges ..|`|uSeApMt9aa	4$ an hour. Some people don't even make 9.00 an hour. So charging them 9 an hour when they make 9 an hour defeats the purpose of baby sitting while they are at work. I make a fair amount but i would only charge 4.|`|u2USmGcMaa	Well the parents usually set the pay price... It also depends on how long you are going to be babysitting. Like if it's for 2 hours then you should at least get $10 and hour.|`|BNSy3xViaa	Hmmm...maybe $10-$13.50? I wouldn't push the parents unless their rich, heh...economy...|`|hYP6akCYaa	i'm 13 and i charge 8.50 or 9.00 an hour|`|hntZWnLuaa	i'm 14 and i babysit for a 2 year old including attention and changing diapers (yea its A LOT of fun... haha) and they pay me $7 an hour. $5/hr is underpaid, and $10 is overpaid, so we went for 7 cuz its in the middle! its probably the most reasonable price. and if you don't think it's enough, it adds up to a lot in the end. i have over $200 from the past year!|`|iYBTpq0laa	It's good to nogotiate, take their offer first to see what they want, and it could be alot more than you would have offered in the first place.  But, if you need a set price from the start, 15 dollers and hour is a easonable price.|`|KR1FdEZgaa	i pay 4.75 an hour for my 5 year old and 4.50 an hour for my 7 year old. if this is once in awhile charge 8 to 10, if this is every day so they can work charge 6 or 7 an hour.|`|txEMWye4aa	i wouldnt accept nothing lower than 8.00 i think that should be pretty reasonable alos it depends on how long and often your watching him for.|`|M21c8MQ9aa	I think Tori's out of her mind charging that much. I'd say cut that in half so charge 4.50 and hour or somewhere around in there|`|eo0DKI0qaa	25-27$ would be good|`|6QGWz9gDaa	if the mom is close to you id say 7 bucks an hour<br>  <br>  if not then 10|`|A2RR611caa	Well I babysit for about $5-$7 dollars. My babysitter just gives me whatever at the end without even asking how much I charge.|`|GqEsVyEvaa	It is only one kid, so you do not what to charge too high.  But since he is very youg, about $8 would be a good starting price.
2F5HNPqPaa	I have a 6 month old and if/when we go to the beach I wouldn't take him in or near the sea... maybe when he can walk and paddle, but not now.  <br>  <br>  You can take her to the beach, just not in the sea!|`|abT0o6hHaa	I don't see why it wouldn't be okay to take her to the beach. i can't think of anything in the ocean that could be harmful at all. My daughter loved to sit right at the edge of the water and splash in it:) just make sure you use sun protection for her|`|1VdgsZPoaa	I would never have thought to take my 3 month old into the water when I went to the beach.  The waves are crazy and all she would do is get a mouthful of water.  I say go to the beach lathered in baby sunscreen and of course she should have a sun hat and then stick to the sand.<br>  <br>  If she is far enough in the water to get the water in her mouth, I wouldn't be that close,  just my opinion.|`|oXEEMAL0aa	I took my son to local swimming pools when he was 5 days old but that was my own personal choice.  I think it's healthy for babies to get used to water and the outdoors.  If you are worried about diseases then you shouldn't even take her for walks on the street in her stroller as you can catch much more in public than you can at a beach. Think about all the germs that you pass when you go into a mall when you touch the door handle at the doctors office etc...<br>  take your baby just make sure she is wearing a t-shirt with some sunscreen and a hat.<br>  have Fun!|`|GzMFhJdRaa	i took my son around 4-5 months...he is now a year, still alive and healthy....has gotten all vaccinations. i think you should not dunk her in, i'm sure you know that but just dipping her lil legs in wont kill her or make her deathly ill....i think its fine<br>  give her a good bath afterwards|`|Ew2wC9piaa	we lived on galveston island for about 4 years and my mom had my brother who is now 10 at the beach when he was a month old and when we moved in land she did the same with my 7 year old brother and my 5 year old sister and they are just fine we took my son when he was about 4 months old but he was born in feb so we had to wait till it was warm enough to go. i took his bath chair he had one of those mesh ones that fold up at walmart and he had fun till a wave went over all of us. but my mom had my siblings at the beach young with no ill effects. we always take a tent and set it up so there is shade for those who need some shade|`|hQ8uCFqEaa	Maybe dip her feet in the water, but don't go in the waves or deep water....
8Rg4WODraa	Nope, marijuana completely does away with the menstrual cycle. No need for pregnancy tests, just keep smoking and you'll never have a period again!!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Take a test now. I have friend that smoked pot all throughout high school and didn't ever have late periods. Weed does NOT delay your period hun.|`|AA10015577	Weed doesn't delay your period.  You should be testing to see if you are pregnant!|`|4yr7I3dtaa	Smoking pot does not make you "bad". But you are extremely misinformed about the effects of marijuana, and should do a little research of your own before you put anything into your body. If you think you are pregnant, then I would suggest taking a test. You can never be too sure!|`|CpiLHcTlaa	i knew a lot of girls who smoked pot (i never liked it... don;t like alcohol either i hate feeling 'fuzzy" ) and they were quite regular.. and some girls i knew smoked it every day sometimes more then once a day others smoked every once and a while. take a test.  and no more pot till you know your not pregnant.|`|K0Oh0p6Daa	I would go to the clinic and find out.|`|HlCXIRMiaa	take a test cus weed doesnt make it late
AA12306951	That has happened a lot to me too. Its COULD just be discharge: your body's way of cleaning out your body. Talk to your GYN if you are really concerned. Hope everything is alright!

I think that some great combinations would be Julian Alexander and Elliot Benjmain!!! I love Lydia and Molly, but I'm really not a fan of the other girl names on your list and I don't think that Molly Lydia or Lydia Molly flows too well (although Lydia Molly is actually pretty nice!).

VKQzj4Pmaa	I agree with James. Taking away some thing that they favor for a short period of time will catch their attention. If you don't want it to be a cell phone, it can be television, internet, or video games. If that doesn't help, you may have to be a little more drastic, and perhaps ground them for a few days.<br>  <br>  I know it doesn't seem like they are doing anything horrible and down-right rebellious, but it is really for their own good that they learn to remember and obey, mild or not. Next time they do something like this, simply say, "I know you forgot, but it's really important that you remember. The next time this happens, I'm going to take away such-and-such for x amount of time for your punishment. Please try to remember, okay?"<br>  <br>  Like I said, if that doesn't help, you may have to resort to, "Since you can't remember what I tell you, then I'm going to have to ground you if this happens again."<br>  <br>  Just keep it simple and to the point.|`|OCMq6FTdaa	just take something away for a short period of time, (not cell phone because it is a saftey thing a form of communication.) for example T.V., or computer for non-school related purposes, at 14 is she going out at night with no adult supervision? how is she getting around? if she is supervized, there is no need for a curfew. anyway, good luck:)|`|m2cxGTwgaa	They may be great kids, but they still need you to guide them. You need boundaries. If your daughter is late, don't just talk to her about it. Give her reason to not be late the next time. The more there is on the line,  the more they will remember not to forget.|`|Vv7a31pmaa	I have kids 13  18  20.<br>  <br>  When they do things like this, I take away a privilege. <br>  <br>  of course this is now more effective on the 13 yo.<br>  <br>  Her cell phone is usually my target.  If she does something small then she looses a cell phone for a day.<br>  <br>  she got in a food fight and i took it for 3 days.
ew0FaElzaa	I wouldn't be too scared you body has gone through a lot hun. If it truly worries you, get to your doctor. He/She can probably assist you with your worries and put them to ease. More than likely it is just taking your body a little longer than usual to get back into the swing of things hormonally. Your doctor may do a few routine tests just to make sure.<br>  <br>  Very sorry for your loss and Best wishes :)|`|xayYdIfHaa	Hi... how far along were you?<br>  I had a stillbirth at 23 weeks, and it took me almost 12 weeks to get my period.<br>  I went to the dr at 10 weeks after my miscarriage and he told me that some people take much longer to heal than others. It depends on how far along you were, and how fast your body heals. <br>  Just make sure to take things easy<br>  *hugs*
SEzIkGNiaa	I enjoy Polls&Surveys, Other-Career & Employments, and Teen and PreTeen|`|hKJIDdVqaa	Religion, and spirituality, Government, Home and Garden, Politics, News.|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	I would say Celebrities, Boxing, and Dream Interpretation. I went in to Pets Section (more specifically Cats) and asked a question, those people there are fierce!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Computers & Internet<br>  <br>  I occasionally venture into Politics and Government but I nearly almost always regret it.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Science - but even when I am right sometimes they are argumentative, so I have to decide if it's worth the fight.|`|gyYXV3Bxaa	Etiquette|`|JnLoHaoAaa	I like the dining out section, travel, etiquette, polls & surveys, reality TV, movies, and real estate|`|um29wkUPaa	Men's Health is a blast.<br>  I've learned plenty in Diabetes.<br>  <br>  Polls & surveys gets old fast, but they're not report-happy.  Least'you know if you land there you're not going to be booted for no reason.|`|6VbNJOtfaa	Politics and Government; but I am mainly in the baby sections.
QCVzUC1baa	EWWWWWWWWW disgusting and its always the weird ones LOL<br>  <br>  This happened to me in Tesco some really weird woman comes over to my son and was touching him, stroking him, grabbing his cheek<br>  I was so annoyed I was bent down looking for something then look up and there she is and he was smiling at her. She was so odd.<br>  <br>  I think when you have a baby it always strikes up conversation with ppl but we do sometimes attract the freaks. I just HATE it when they start touching my son. I would never touch a strangers baby its rude.|`|yznZqcznaa	Ughhh no I would not and if someone did that to my child I would slap them across the face :)  No stranger will be getting anywhere near my child.  I am getting an orbit stroller and they will be facing me until they are 20 lbs.  I am currently pregnant not a mother yet.|`|OBU1eDUHaa	People are always wanting to touch my babies.  I think it's rude too! When they are in the infant carrier, I just keep a blanket over them, checking on them often.  No one wants to lift up the blanket!|`|y6g0RnuAaa	That is ridiculous. Since having a baby, I sometimes look for the hidden camera and wait for someone to jump out and say "ha ha got ya!" Totally inappropriate.|`|x6G2wPjLaa	Well i do those things because i WORK with children, I kiss the babies because they're so cute and and of course they need affection when they're away from their parents, sometimes i have to put my finger in a babys mouth because he/she is eating something they found off the floor so what the hell! I have to prevent the baby from choking. Parents dont seem to have a problem with me kissing their babys they actually feel happy they are cared for and showed love. <br>  But if i saw a random stranger on road why would i kiss the baby and put my fingers in their mouth - do people actually do that?|`|qxteTM9Kaa	Absolutely not!! That has happened to me as well and I was mortified,Its so unsanitary ...How would these people like it if strangers came up to them and stuck their funky fingers in their mouths...disgusting!|`|W0WXfNxOaa	No way that's strange. Random people have tried to give my son sweets/money before. Both of which i have politely said no to.|`|0zWJlNi1aa	I defo would not!!<br>  <br>  Neither of them<br>  <br>  How wierd!!<br>  <br>  Whats LO stand for by the way?|`|o5Ez7Gyraa	I have never had this happen, I would ask them to stop for sure and leave. that to me is strange.|`|SjX72fPyaa	Umm no I can't say I would ever do those things. I'd stop and talk to someones baby but I would never kiss them or stick my finger in their mouth!<br>  And that has never happened to me but if some random person ever did that to Aisling I can guarantee I wouldn't react very well lol. I have the 'look don't touch' policy when it comes to strangers around her.|`|IWinNj2saa	We went to a restaurant at the beginning of Feb, for my niece's birthday party, and the waitress actually picked up my son, and kissed him on the mouth, boy were we grossed out. We didn't really do anything though, what can you do, that won't seem rude? So you are not the only one who attracts oddballs. LoL|`|J2glFOkhaa	NO WAY!  I would punch someone in the face if they TOUCHED my baby let alone kissed my baby! I don't know wher you have been, do not touch my child! I never touch strangers babies. If I touch anyones baby I wash my hands thoroughly first! Even then I don't kiss on the face.. even my family, I kiss their hands|`|siDcjgJCaa	AHHHH! NEVER... i am wary about simply touching another babies leg or arm.. because it makes me nervous when strangers touch my baby... My daughter is a chubby happy lovable baby who attracts all kind of attention when we go out and at least one person tries to touch her.. and it bugs me.. but in the MOUTH or KISS another baby NEVER.. yuck!|`|1S7uXsInaa	The only scenario I can think of when anyone would put their fingers in a babies mouth is if they were choking. . .and then by all means go ahead!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I have never seen anyone kiss a strangers baby either.  People like to hold babies, but the kissing is a new one for me.|`|FidZNMmUaa	No I wouldn't, but I have seen it happen. A neighbour of mine, who I don't know very well did this to my friends baby at school.  <br>  <br>  I always hand my baby off to my other friend when we are at school so this lady doens't ask to hold my baby. She is a smoker and it makes it that much worse.|`|cab8f3eed982d7c810bf2e8fc14f2cecaa	I would never do either to anyone else's child. I would so kindly ask them to please not touch my child or put there hands on them. Its never happened to me. Course I am always watching when strange ppl come within 5 feet of me and my son. I dont really understand WHY in the world someone else would think thats ok to do so. *shrugs*|`|6lTaIXYqaa	Hi there,<br>  I personally would never do something like this -- and yes, it is quite inappropriate, especially the finger in the mouth  -- I don't think people intentionally mean to cause disrespect, but a lot of people who don't have babies themselves aren't thinking in the same mindset we are <br>  ( germ alert! ) so they aren't as sensitive -- I think I would just say something like "oh, my son/ daughter just got over the tummy flu, it's probably better if you keep your distance, I wouldn't want you to get sick....... " or something like that? and then make your escape, all the while smiling pleasantly? <br>  I don't know -- I try to cause the least confrontation around my son --  you never know how someone is going to react to a negative response to something they may think is complimentary. Anyway, I hope this helped.  I'm sure you don't attract oddballs : )|`|bMyq2nOTaa	No, and no!!<br>  <br>  My husband's work had a Fall Festival we went to, dressed in costumes, and my littlest ones (aged 20 months, and a week and a half, at the time) were in a double stroller... It was outside, and I turned the stroller around, to get out of the wind, only to be faced by the sun... Some woman I didn't know, ran up, and out her hand on my baby's forehead, trying to shield her eyes from the sun!! I was pretty miffed; I turned the stroller in the other direction, and ignored her... Had she persisted, I would have told her, "Excuse me, but my baby is not public property." I have no trouble being rude, when someone is being rude, first. (Baby was young, yes, but we only went for half an hour.)<br>  <br>  Another pet peeve of mine, is when someone is holding my baby, and they get right in their face, breathing on them! Gross! It's flu season, for goodness sake. :)<br>  <br>  *edited* I also don't like it when someone grabs my baby's hands, or even kisses their hands! Hands go right in their mouth, and they don't need someone's germ... I Purell, right away!!|`|8SMLOPvuaa	no wouldn't kiss strangers baby <br>  no wouldn't put my finger in a baby's mouth unless it was chocking or put something it shouldn't in the mouth x|`|0mbGkwFJaa	I realise lots of people have answered no and would take offence to this. However I work in a nursery and me and all the other workers wouldnt have a problem with kissing one of the babies however I would not do this if the parents were not completely happy with this, and I would never kiss the baby on the lips. <br>  And yes ive put my fingers in a babys mouth, obviously for a reason, for example eating chalk or crayon|`|AdAuTF7Iaa	o my god no way and if i could help it wouldnt let anybody do it to mine i think if sombody did i would have to say somthing x|`|9QVjNaIPaa	never! and i would never let anyone do it to my baby either!|`|z6IekuwSaa	I would never do either! Ugh, people are so gross. The finger one has happened to me many a time. I have no idea where people get off stickin their nasty fingers in my precious baby's mouth! I flip out on everyone who does this. A girl even did it when we went to get her pics done when she was just 2 months old. I flipped on her, the manager, and the customer service rep at their 1-800 number. Got me some free pics, but I'm pretty sure after that happened I'm never going back their again!|`|MuPQ3oqtaa	there is no way i would that and i would never let someone else do it to my baby either its so rude !!|`|fu5NqrsPaa	That's not as bad as what i had happen to me. At one point i was caring for three lil boys. One was a newborn, one a year old and one was three years. Well i had my new born son with me also and we went out to eat. This lady comes up and grabs the one yea old and he started crying, well she got upset threw him back in his booster and tried to reach over me and pick up the babies. I slapped her hands away of coarse and told her they are not her children and to not touch them.<br>  Some people have no manners. I hate people like that|`|jLNwrVZRaa	I would NEVER do that to someones baby!  I recently had to take my son to a walk-in and some woman touched his hand and I thought that was rude enough!  I immediately turned him around and put hand sanitizer on his hands!  I didn't know why she was there and he doesn't go to daycare yet so he's not exposed to all those germs.  I was pissed at that, I can't imagine what you must have felt!|`|Nb0Gxvsyaa	Never.  Also, I have had strangers actually get mad at ME for pulling my three month old AWAY from them in his carrier.  They act like I'm rude.  I am a raging b*tch anyhow so I couldn't care less what they think.  I find it amusing that people think I'm being rude when at the height of flu season they want to stick their germy hands and face near my child.|`|CjySz62Haa	wow! no one is allowed to kiss my baby on his face except me and his daddy!!! never let that happen again, please. keep your precious out of reach of strangers. in fact, how old is the baby. my boy is 3 month old and my stroller/car seat is always covered with something to keep him protected from noisy ones|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	No I would not but I completely understand... People do the strangest things when they see babies. I actually had a woman ask me to hold my son in Walmart! Not to mention all these strangers who ask you things like Did you have a natural birth?? are you nursing?? and do you let him sleep with you?? What's it their buiness!! LOL I just answer them and the woman who asked if she could hold my baby I said I was in a hurry and better not!|`|b8f0CfSsaa	I personally wouldn't do it and it has never happened to me! I would let it pass if someone did it the once, but if I saw it begin to happen again I would just say 'No don't she has a cold!' (I am such a pansy when it comes to offending people)|`|2LmfQUbKaa	i have had someone kiss my baby b4 and right away i washed his face and told the person no disrespect but i would prefer you not do that i dont want him getting sick! and if they dont like it screw them you got to keep your baby healthy!|`|8dhe15MUaa	no i would not|`|3CVfUiiJaa	I would never kiss a strangers baby...period<br>  I would never put anything of mind in a strangers baby's mouth either.<br>  <br>  I personally don't feel comfortable holding other people's babies as a rule either.   Just something I don't do.  <br>  I have never had a stranger kiss my son, or stick anything in his mouth.|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	Oh my goodness no! Since becoming a parent i've realised that touching another baby without the parent's permission is extremely rude. Your poor LO, those people were extremely rude!|`|AA11210211	A.NO<br>  B.NO<br>  <br>  I have had strangers touch my children's faces but most of them were little old ladies!!! I swear children attract old ladies and the occasion old man!! I simply asked them not to touch them.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	I would never go and kiss a strangers baby.... YUCK!  <br>  <br>  And for a stranger to put there finger in my babies mouth, that would piss me off.  The only other person who has ever put there fingers in my sons mouth besides me and my husband, would be the nurses at the hospital, but they were wearing sterile gloves and it was for medical reasons.  <br>  <br>  That would totally piss me off and bother me.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	I would never do either of those things. A lot of  grandmother age women have touched my daughters hands and such, but if they tried anything else I would swoop in and move my child. Some days I feel like I need to hang a legal notice from the stroller to inform strangers of my intent to physically remove them from my child.|`|IlyS8KGzaa	No, I would never do that.  I hate it when strangers get all up in my baby's face also.  I had this lady at walmart pretty much chase me to see my baby.  She said she could hear my baby crying 2 lanes over so she just had to come and see her.  I was thinking to myself at the time, "great lady, just get up in my baby's face, that will help her stop crying!"  I just wanted to yank my baby away from her, but my mom was with me, and she thought I was being rude.|`|2F5HNPqPaa	A complete stranger's baby?  Absolutely not.  I wouldn't even kiss my closest friends baby... just because it still wouldn't be my place.  I don't even really like family kissing my baby... luckily, they're not the kissy type anyway!  <br>  <br>  The finger thing... that's worse than kissing.  If I'm going to put my finger in my son's mouth (to check for teeth) I always always always wash my hands first.  I would NOT put my finger in my friends baby's mouth and would expect her not to put hers in my son's!  A stranger... chances are you're out in public if you see a stranger and if you're out shopping or whatever, you generally haven't washed your hands recently.  Wrong!<br>  <br>  Neither of these things have happened to me... occasionally little old ladies have stopped and had conversation with my son and not even glanced at me... luckily that's as bad as it gets!  You're right though, it's verrrrrrrry rude.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	NEVER<br>  NEVER<br>  but there ARE some weird *** PPL out there; my best advice is to get a 'mosquito' or 'weather' cover for the infant carrier that is mesh, you can see through but ppl can't touch baby; after having a couple weirdos touch mine and one who looked nasty actually put her passy back in, my hub came home with that, and i saw that it would work better on ppl! LOL..not what he had in mind of course!|`|CVdcrY3kaa	No, and no! That kind of stuff just drives me insane! When my daughter was sucking on her thumb an older woman walked up to her and pulled it out, my daughter started crying and it took me forever to calm her down again. I could not believe that some random woman just walked up to my daughter in her stroller and took her thumb out of her mouth!! I stood there in shock, and just excused myself.|`|zwctZ812aa	I would freak out if someone stuck their finger in my baby's mouth! I have had strangers try to kiss him on the face.  I usually just turn away.  I know it seems rude, but I would never kiss a stranger's baby on the face, and I don't want someone doing it to my baby! People I know, but are not overly familiar with have been the worst for me.  We aren't big church people, but go here and there.  When we went for Christmas it seemed like every church member was trying to kiss my 7 week old son.  I wasn't having it!!|`|1270a2c558de1c5ce444bf6f3447f4beaa	No, I would never do either to stranger's child.  The second I won't do to any child but my own in fact!!!!!<br>  <br>  A woman at my work that I do not know more than the occasional work conversation here and there did that to my son when he was about four months old.  I was absolutely flabbergasted!!!  Number one, she had not washed her hands and had just been thumbing through papers and walking through doors and etc, and number two we are no more than co-workers!!  I maintained composure though, and just walked over and said "time to come see mommy again!" and took my son back.  eww, it gives me the creeps, i wish my son could know better, LOL LOL.|`|lGcpXteaaa	wow, i would never do that to somebodies baby...just mine!<br>  I think you must attract the odd ones! lol<br>  <br>  I just attract the rude ones! Somebody once kept pulling my daughters dummy out when she was asleep in the pram in the supermarket...saying 'oh get that dummy out of your mouth'..i just kept putting it back in. She got the idea the 2nd time haha!<br>  <br>  People have been pretty decent actually, like this old woman insisted that she buy my daughter a xmas present. That was really nice of her..but maybe she just thought i was young and poor..lol idk|`|BW7Nrqjzaa	I have people peek into the sling all he time. I can't imagine doing that to someone... Umm.. Hello- ever think I might be nursing...  I usually just give them the death stare. If I want you to see the baby I'll open the sling up for you- DUH!<br>  <br>  My husband doesn't even like our family members kissing our babies on the face. And that includes our 4yr old and 2yr old.<br>  <br>  People are just loony when it comes to babies and a lot seem to lose there good senses when they see one.
avkZGv1taa	I thought they were both cute--I like the amount of light in the first better--but I think that also has to do with the amount of light coming in the windows, not just the colors.  That being said--I don't think I would follow either one exactly.  The first was too light-on-light, the second too dark-on-dark.  If you use dark furniture, do a slightly lighter background, rather than the really dark brown.  it could still be dark, just not a matching color.  I'm sure whatever you pick will be lovely!|`|e33QAXShaa	I like it if we're having a girl this time around we're doing pink & brown and the furniture is dark. There will be more pink then brown though to keep it lighter.|`|7a7a8b25f6c8edb1f3143b162357b855aa	i think the first one is cute!<br>  its light colored & looks beautiful!<br>  good luck! ;]<br>  & congrats on your baby girl<3|`|qMpykWznaa	cute...like them both but for sure the second 1|`|6sCC2zUSaa	I love them both! They are too cute!! Im so excited for you :)|`|fTd509Qzaa	I like the first one better|`|yV337gGyaa	i love both of them =]|`|My93XR2Maa	thAt is so cut i wont that when i have a Girl. get it i would|`|HW89eJEZaa	i like the first one better, it lets more light in the room! the second one is too dark.|`|lzUF22l0aa	i think that is sooo pretty good luck with putting it all together im sure it will look beautiful when its all done|`|fFX0Xk9Uaa	I also did my nursery in pink and brown...looks gorgeous!  My question is, I'm not sure about Looney Tunes with pink and brown? Is the looney tunes pink and brown too?  I'd go with more of a print theme than looney tunes, but if you have your heart set....its your room! Good luck!|`|CJvHQl5vaa	I like the first one better.  The second one was too busy.  Maybe the second one with different bedding would look less busy. I like both sets of furniture.|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	I like the first nursery picture, the brown and off white paneling on the bottom wall looks better than all brown|`|wkd5CMNaaa	I love them both, I dont think it looks stupid to have brown furniture against the wayy. <br>  Is the baby looney toons theme stuff pink and brown too?
G4qP2gATaa	Yes they will still be able to see baby! I never went into ultrasound with a full bladder and got some great shots!! XD|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	Yup they will. Your bubs is a lot bigger than s/he was at your first u/s :)|`|uuHPneEcaa	yes the 1st ultra sound I had wasn't a full bladder I had my full bladder at 19weeks.<br>  <br>  <br>  but to answer ur question they will be able to see ur baby without  a full bladder.|`|ew0FaElzaa	I hate to say it but I would do it anyways. I had the rudest lady who did my ultrasound at 18 weeks and I WANTED to know what my baby was. So to be safe and if you haven't found out what the baby is by now it would probably be in your best interest to have a full bladder rather than being turned away due to being "mis informed". <br>  <br>  Good Luck and Congrats!|`|xnhwmontaa	I would go in with a full bladder. If they think its better without it. you can empty it. Better than them saying "if only you had a full bladder" I would rather be safe than sorry! Good Luck!|`|QYYWBrG7aa	yes.i had one at 16 weeks and i didnt need a full bladder.had another ultrasound at 19 weeks and didnt need one then either and they seen the baby perfect on both|`|IWinNj2saa	The machines are so high tech these days, you don't really need a full bladder, and they can still see everything just as good. I was shocked when I filled my bladder up, got there, about to pee myself, and the tech was like, go to the bathroom, a full bladder isn't required anymore. Wish they would have told me sooner.|`|h5cFkP35aa	at a 4D u/s they requested that my bladder was empty but with a regular one they always tell me to drink 32 oz of water. and yes it makes a big difference. one day at an u/s appt. i couldn't hold it and went to the bathroom before i seen the baby and the pictures turned out blurry and hard to distinguish. i would recommend always drinking water for a full bladder.|`|AA12395149	Sounds like you have a nice ultrasound tech.  I thought the full bladder thing was agonizing!  The full bladder helps to push the baby out of the pelvis a bit more, but the tech can still see things even if the bladder isn't full.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|Hf5doDxsaa	Yes, I remember hearing horror stories from friends about how bad they had to pee during their ultrasound.  Then, I was pleasantly surprised when I was told I didn't have to have a full bladder.  Everything went great.  They could see the baby perfectly.|`|nQyJFOMZaa	Yes! Being 18.5 weeks the baby is large enough to see without your bladder being full. But if you want to be extra sure it doesn't hurt to go in with a full bladder|`|wkd5CMNaaa	Yeah, it seems to be based on the tech's preference.  I went in with a full bladder, and they told me to empty it!|`|sEihaeLNaa	yes mam they should|`|avkZGv1taa	yes... they actually had me empty my bladder when I got there before they did the u/s--and we had a fabulous view :)

4YfehneDaa	its possible, but i don't think very likely.  you most likely ovulated on around the 24th, and you only had sex twice around that time.  Obviously it only takes once to get pregnant, (although not when you are trying to get pregnant) but you should have more sex around ovulation in order to increase your chances.  I remember being sick for a few day after i ovulated when i was pregnant the first time, but i think it was just a coincidence.  Try using www.fertilityfriend.com to track your cycles, (its free) they will help you pinpoint ovulation almost exactly so that you can increase your chances of conceiving.  Good luck!|`|iKYNUni0aa	it could be pms|`|WuVW9uCAaa	well for 1 thing u dont ovulate that soon after ur period u ovulate 14 days after go to mymonthlycycles.com and it will tell u everything|`|7SVLjYHiaa	you are trying to say that you ovulated the first day/weel following your period??  that is not right at all. you would have in infertile then.<br>  <br>  14 day rule isn't right for everyone, so it depends on your own cycle length.  BUT you could guesstimate your ovulation time by subtracting 14 days by your expected period date.  ifyou have a normal 28 day cycle then you could assume (though it isn't completely accruate at all) that you would be ovulating around the 25th.<br>  <br>  you will have to wait a while longer before getting accurate results.|`|Qlr06d87aa	I am now 31 weeks pregnant and with this pregnancy I had symptoms about 1 week after I conceived.  I have one child but this is my 5th pregnancy and every time I have light cramping early on.  I never have cramping any other time than right after my period starts.  So I suppose it is possible if you ovulated and conceived a week ago that you might now be having some changes and symptoms.  But as you know a home test would likely turn out negative at this point but blood tests can tell you if you're pregnant earlier.  There are endless other reasons for what you're experiencing but if you are trying to conceive and these are unusual symptoms for you there's always a chance.|`|a44ae0ff85131fac209cb7a6b624b0fdaa	Its really hard to say - some women have symptoms a week - some not until month 3. I know for me, I have the same symptoms you are having every month with PMS and every month I wonder if I am pregnant. <br>  <br>  Now I would assume these aren't normal for you - to have such severe PMS - but all it really is telling you right now is that you have progestrone in your body... which happens before period and early pregnancy. <br>  <br>  It could be due to implantation - but honestly, you really can't tell for a couple of weeks. <br>  <br>  I am sorry that's not more helpful. <br>  <br>  In the mean time, try warm wash cloths on your breasts and boobie massages (they help) and make sure you are drinking A LOT of water to combat the pain and any water retention :)
HtyUrjrFaa	A lot of the time when the girl is mean at the school she isn't outside of school. She can be mean but she might use soccer as an outlet for her energy. You will probably become friends with her if you are on the same team considering you will be around her a lot. <br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  Cross your fingers!|`|bdc0c1d1aead267282553512169a9932aa	tell the coach...kids can't be mean and play sports these days...can you say, LAW SUIT.|`|7XJPyENFaa	Being nice to bullies often confuses them.|`|ildgJVJoaa	It's an honor to get on the team, so take up the offer! You'll definitely make friends, and if the girl is too mean to you, speak up - tell your parents, the coach, or even the principal of your school. If you're feeling very confident, try going up to her and acting nice to her. Sometimes all people need is a friend.|`|8Rg4WODraa	Exploit the fact that she's a lesbian, then come on to her.|`|Uv8TBb1Uaa	tell someonee in charge to gett you outt
cwSnDWM2aa	Rotavirus and Influenza type A and B are going around bad right now.  1 baby in our church had rotavirus and almost every kid in our church got it.  It is highly contagious.  If you go out in public and someone has either rotavirus or the flu all you have to do is breathe in the air around them or touch something they touched.  It is in the air and on items they touch.  My 1 year old son had rotavirus 3 weeks ago and ended up hospitilized for dehydration.  He caught it from church.  He was better for a week and now he had diarrhea and vomiting again.  I also got sick while he was in the hospital.  Now I am starting to get sick for the second time.  I disinfected and cleaned my whole house last time and cleaned all his toys.  The doctor said it is good to disinfect, but it is in the air and people can get it no matter how clean they are.  All you can do is keep all of you hydrated.  Gatorade, pedialyte, and water.  Also if your kid is over a year of age feed your child salty pretzels or crackers.  The sodium helps keep fluids in.  If you can't keep absolutely anything down just stick with liquids for now, and then try the brat diet (bananas, rice cereal, applesauce, toast) when you are feeling a little better.  You probably got sick from just simply being our in public.  This stuff is highly contagious!  I hope this helps!|`|wZAeBisbaa	Get some help!  I feel for you, having to take care of sick kids when you're sick too. That's so miserable. Is there someone you can call?<br>  <br>  My guess is that it's just a flu bug that will go away in a day or two, but if you think it could be food poisoning, you should see a doctor so that the source can be identified and removed to prevent other people from getting sick.  Food poisoning usually comes on within hours of eating the bad food.  If it was a day or two in between, it's probably flu.  You could have been exposed to it at the restaurant, though.<br>  <br>  Hope you all feel better soon.|`|OBU1eDUHaa	You probably did get it from going out.  Just call your MD and tell the nurse you are all sick, what does she suggest-be sure to tell her you are not sick enough to come in though.  She will probably suggest nothing to eat until not vomiting for over an hour or more.  Then sips of water for a few hours if not vomiting.  Once you've kept that down you can try bananas/rice/applesauce/toast diet.  Nothing greasy/fried/spicy/or acidic.  Good luck.  Be sure to call your MD.
ftvxAS3saa	im so excited to, i know its gunna be hard but me n my boyfriend r really excited to do it, his mom thinks its disgusiting but i dont give a crap an my mom keeps saying you wont be able to do it but i know i will!!|`|WPI0Z47saa	They can get sick or have problems in the womb but that is another issue. I breastfed my son for 18 months. You need a good support team to help you through it sometimes because it can be frustration. There is a really good book called "So that's what they are for" and it will talk you through almost any issue that will arise while breastfeeding. It is hard to get a hang of for you and the baby at first so you have to stay patient. Too many people give up way too quickly because they are convinced that they cannot produce enough milk. This is only true with less then 1% of women so please remember that. There are so many ways to build up your milk supply one being to pump after you attempt to breast feed. The more you brestfeed/pump, the more milk your body will produce since it bases how much it will make upon demand. Almost all problems with getting the baby to latch on can be fixed to unless there is a medical problem like a sensory problem but they would have a problem with a bottle in ths case as well too. Doctors will sometimes scare you into thinking that your baby is starving. Remember that doctors are NOT required to have extended knowledge on breastfeeding and most only know the basics. Many also don't want to deal with said issues since so many women take OTC or illegal substances and still breastfeed and they do not want to be held responsible. If you should run into ANY problems please contact a lactation counsiler. They will help you through anything involving breastfeeding. Also know that although it is very time consuming in the begnning to breastfed and you may feel like this is all that you are doing, it does get easier because your baby won't always eat so often. By the time you get to just 3 times a day it hardly effects your life at all. Some babies also nurse quickly after awhile and you may only have to nurse 5-10 minutes at a time. This all just takes patients and practice. So please don't start out by saying "I hope that I can do it" You CAN do it. You just have to stick to it and dedicate yourself to it. If you need any help or tips please email me. I hope this helps.|`|8oAlBL91aa	I think the only real thing you have to worry about it not producing enough milk or him refusing your breast. That's really what scares me. <br>  <br>  And really you just want him out because it's such a long time away I know how you feel I have so many baby things and no baby lol.|`|ykP7I3caaa	I don't think it's weird. People talk so much about how it will potentially be difficult that you almost can't wait for the challenge. Plus you know it's best for your little boy :]|`|KmC0K59taa	So, what is your breastfeeding question??|`|dnRte8U7aa	No, it's not weird.  It's great!  You're going to need to call on that excitement the first couple of weeks LOL  It can be tough for the baby and you to figure it out, leading to painful nipples, etc.  But once you both get the hang of it, it is SO rewarding and wonderful.  <br>  <br>  I was just thinking last night about the first two weeks.  My baby had a very fast, fierce latch and my nipples were actually bleeding.  I had to clench my teeth and fight back tears each time I nursed her while we worked it out.  Then at the end of two weeks, we "got" it and it's been a breeze ever since.  The trouble of it seems worlds away.<br>  <br>  It is Soooo worth it.  Stay excited and remember all the good you are doing your baby (and your own body!) if it happens to be hard in the beginning.  It's great you're looking forward to it!|`|b6461d8a8d3d34ce5dac5c4052085372aa	Not weird. It's  just natural, it is the best for your child! ;-)=|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	no not really- it may not come easy for you so don't be surprised if it doesn't BUT you can get help with any problems you are having with it- the first time i nursed my son was the most story book moment of my life<br>   you are not weird that's like saying someone is werid because they are excited to be a parent. you can't wait to nourish your child outside of the womb
oP504BtFaa	Today is Sunday and here we have nice weather AGAIN! We went to church this morning (it's Lent - we hardly go when it's not :\) and then I went to my yoga class while my husband made breakfast for the girls.

You could tell the animals were happy about the weather too because most of them were up and moving around for once.

Last week I took pictures of 5th & 6th grade boys basketball (individual pics and team pics). Today I cropped each of the pictures, created my specialty frames for those that ordered them and placed an order for my pictures. This took most of my afternoon.<br>  <br>  I am also on a committee that coordinates sporting events for our elementary children. Right now I'm trying to prepare my shirt order for all our volleyball teams (volleyball just started this week). I am also trying to create a volleyball game schedule... I'm getting a little confused so I decided to take a quick break from it.<br>  <br>  I really need to get stuff done around the house... hopefully tomorrow after church.<br>  <br>  :0)<br>  .|`|e0xpYnv1aa	Woke up, did some cleaning, went grocery shopping with hubby, took a nap then hubby and I went to see Valkyrie. Now we're at home, doing some laundry.<br>  <br>  It was really nice out...If any of my summer clothes fit I would have done something outside today :/ (I'm 9 months)

Such as one that only takes literally like 10 minutes for everything. Here's what you do. <br>  <br>  Grocery list:<br>  4 packs of budding beef(the cheap sandwich meat)<br>  1 2 cans cream of celery soup<br>  a loaf of bread<br>  1 of the soup cans of milk<br>  <br>  Ok She takes the sandwich meat and chops it up just into like 1/2 in squares(easiest if you keep them together and cut). Then she takes both cans of soup and puts them in a deep frying pan and adds just 1 of those cans of milk. It makes it creamier but not milky. let simmer for just a few seconds and put the beef in. While that is heating up toast the bread. However many pieces that you think that you and your family can eat. Once this is done. Just take off the stove and serve the creamy mixture also known as chipped beef over the toast. It is good and healthy and very fast. If you want more recipes like this. Feel free to email me. hope this helps and you enjoy.<br>  <br>  <br>  Another one that everyone will enjoy is Kielbasa Sausage in Salsa. I know it sounds really weird. Someone showed it to us and we were like WHAT? and when we tasted it now we have it like 2 -3 times a month<br>  <br>  Grocery list:<br>  2 packs kielbasa Sausage<br>  1 big jar of Picante sauce any style<br>  1 16 oz jar of grape jelly<br>  box of rice<br>  <br>  Cut the kielbasa sausage into pieces. Put a big pot on the stove or use the crock pot. Add the whole thing of picante sauce and add HALF the jar of jelly not the whole thing. Let simmer and kind of gather together. After it is warmed a little add the kielbasa sausage that you previously cut. Let simmer for about 2 hours on low on the stove and the same but a little higher in the crockpot. All that you need to check for it how tender you want the kielbasa sausage to be. Once you have completed the tenderness process made however much rice that you think you will be able to eat and serve the Kielbasa on top of it. This is great for the crock pot, guests, when you are in a time hurry to get things done, does not necessarily need to be watched. Just stir every once in a while and whala. You may need some tums afterwards depending on what style picante sauce you chose. And the jelly is to carmelize it and make it not sooo spicy. Trust me its great. My 2 year old even loves it. Enjoy!|`|AA12145826	Anything you can prep ahead of time and freeze for later will be a life saver.<br>  <br>  Chili (load it with veggies and lean meat but go easy on the spice if you're breastfeeding)<br>  Casseroles (the 1 pot wonders of the cooking world.

pp4384uWaa	It's your first baby and you have no man supporting you, and you know that your friends and family won't always be there like a husband would.  So, naturally your terrified!  But it's okay.  Pregnancy is different for everyone and some people's hormones make them crazy!!  I think your problem is how this is completely new and you scared about giving birth and taking care of someone else.  And your nineteen so you probably had plans of maybe going to college or traveling and now your plans are being changed because of your baby.  Your hormones are making you really emotional and depressed, but I really think that as soon as your baby is born you'll feel like you can't live without him and that you were crazy to consider giving him up.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, maybe you don't feel like you can take care of your baby all alone, or maybe you really don't want a child right now and that's fine too.  Maybe you wanted to experience things before you had kids, or maybe you didn't want kids at all!  Some people don't want to be parents and there's nothing wrong with that!  But if your really on the fence about adoption, you should wait until the baby is born and then decide, don't jump right into it and then decide you want to keep it.  Don't worry about being sad all the time, it's really just hormones and fear.  Whatever you decide for you baby will be the right thing as long as you positive its what you want, with no regrets.  But my advice is to stick it out and decide after you've seen your baby.  Good luck!|`|Ci4Ha1tfaa	i know exactly what you are going through i am 20 years old and 30 weeks preg. unfort :-/ and not with the father(dont want to be anymore anyways) i still go through times like yours all the time crying and not wanting this and then sometimes mayb even excited, even with the support, no one can really tell you what to do. yes your life (mine to) is going to be different but sometimes you just have to take what life throws at you. i think once you have the child give it a try cuz thats the best thing for the child to be with his birth mother. but if you feel that you can't raise it because of money or anything like that then certainly look at other options, best thing i can say is that your not alone and there are other ppl out there like me for instance in the same situation. give it a shot and see how it goes, could even end up being a great mistake.<br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|K0Oh0p6Daa	I been there. Im 37wks with my third and with my first kid I went through what ur going through now. U will be fine. He would be the one who's missing out. No one can love ur baby better than u. And when u see ur baby u will c that. Some people today adopt kids for money or to be mean to kids and that's just a small percentage of people. Think about it some more. The right guy will come along and help u. Look to god and ask him to help u. Whenever im lost I look to him for the answers. Gd luck I will be fine.|`|SA1y0lm1aa	welcome the pregnancy hormones they make a difficult situation worse.... all pregnant women are emotionally unfit.... its just the way mother nature does us during pregnancy and then there is some times post pardon after the baby is born.... lost of emotions......this is what i suggest   you do since you want to try and be a parent ..... have your baby give parenting a try for 2 or 3 months ..... if you feel that you cant do the parenting then they baby is still young enof to get a really good adopted family and you are happy knowing the baby will get what it needs .... ether from you knowing you can do the parenting or by giving the baby to another fam..... You are more emotionally sound then you think you are .... its mostly the hormones talking.... during my second pregnancy i was separated from the father and i didn't want to have the baby i didn't want him to come out i didn't even think i wanted to hold him when he did come out i was going to be happy being 9 months pregnant forever.....and even got back with the hubby after 6 months of separation (most of the pregnancy) but it was all hormones .... when i did have the baby the hormones changed and out of my 3 kids i held him the most as a baby..... and he was the one i didn't want to come out...lol...... good luck pregnancy does crazy things to u....|`|a095159fe0597a1cbcdff915d247b333aa	This is a tough time for you and it doesn't help that pregnancy makes you very hormonal and emotional.  It is very difficult to really think rationally and being afraid or apprehensive about the future is very normal.<br>  <br>  I don't tell people what to do, as far as whether to place a child for adoption or to parent a child.  I was a teenage mom in a crisis pregancy once and I am also an adoptive parent.  I will say that if you are even considering adoption, take the time to really research it, understand your rights and the legal process completely, before making any decision.  And yes, you don't have to decide anything until after the baby is born. <br>  <br>  There are lots of resources out there to help you parent.  There is aid available so that you can go to college.  You say you have support from your family and friends... don't be afraid to ask for help.  Even a friendly ear.  <br>  <br>  I think its normal for you to have all these feelings right now.  It doesn't mean that you are emotionally unfit to be a parent at all!  Remember, there is a lot of hormonal activity going on!  <br>  <br>  Don't worry so much about the future right now.  Just take each day as it comes.  You will find that you can be a lot stronger than you ever thought you could be.  You could also find that just being a parent and loving your baby is a lot easier than you ever thought it could be.<br>  <br>  Get something chocolate, watch a favorite movie and put your feet up.<br>  <br>  You deserve it!|`|YNH2fmYWaa	if you feel abandoned now because your babies father has left, imagine how your baby is going to feel when he/she grows up to find out that her biological mother left him/her.<br>  <br>  it is a good thing that you did not get an abortion. you can't just try parenting out, and guarantee if you do you are going to fall in love with that baby and not want to give it up. times are hard but as it goes by things will get better.<br>  <br>  and if you think you are going to be an unfit mother then you dont need to give "parenting" a try.<br>  <br>  good luck. and i wish you the best. and like you said dont be so selfish think of the future of your baby and the future in general. guaranteed in about 6 months to a year you will be over that loser who left you and your baby.|`|2ObqoJbKaa	Hey. I don't really know what to tell you, except that I understand how you feel. Life can be very hard. Your going through a tough situation, and your hormones arn't making it any better. Everything will work out. You may feel differently once the baby is born, and you look into its cute little face. Its natural to feel like you won't want the baby, but honestly that will probably change. Just have to be strong, and take each day one day at a time. Good luck. Hope you feel better. Life will work out, you will see. Everything happens for a reason.|`|CpiLHcTlaa	i know how you feel i'll be turning 19 before i have my second. i was looking at being a single mom of one and then a few weeks after i broke up with my bf (who lied and cheated on me) i found out i was almost 6 weeks pregnant!  its scary and your hormones run wild i was almost convinced with my first i was going to be alone form the get go... and i may as well have been... my sons father was never around. and i was terrified.. until i saw my sons face... then suddenly i started crying because he was so beautiful and i knew i would do ANYTHING for that baby to protect him and keep him safe. something in me clicked and i knew no matter what i would HAVE to be able to do it for him. i would HAVE to be able to take care of him and be strong. and I'm still pulling through.. i have my moms support I'm living with her and helping her with the house and paying the bills (her and my step dad divorced so she alone to). i felt all that when i was pregnant and when i saw my son they vanished because i knew i couldn't feel those anymore because he needed me to be strong and care for him. just remember that baby needs it's mom. It's okay to have bad days when your pregnant just try to remember you won;t always feel that way.|`|qMI6H6Lbaa	i had my son at 16 and my duaghter at 18 i am now 22 and will be 23 when this girl is born. i seperated from my first two kids dad after my dayghter was6 months old. being a single mom is very hard. but as long as you havea a couple friends and family that are there to back you then you will be fine. i didnt really have anyone and i have still made it. i am with my third babys dad this time so i am not feeling as epressed as before but i have been there. you will be just find. there are so many things out there for single moms to go to college and they help with chidl care tuition  and all that as well you will be fine.   but if you do decide adoption. i suggest a open adoption where you get to pick your babys parents and you get to have meetings with them and they send you pictures for the first few years if you like and i dont think they usually have a problem sending pictures later on also|`|xubIaiZaaa	aww honey :( i think you are suffering from depression - It can't help that all your pregnancy hormones are running through you right now either.<br>  I think you should book a doctors appointment and tell them what you are feeling as they can help. There are certain steps you can take that can help you get through this rough time.<br>  Once you talk to someone they can explain your options and give you a better way on how to go about things.<br>  <br>  best of luck xx
GqsLNUE8aa	Oh definitely. My oldest went from breast to cup. Neither of my kids have ever taken a bottle. A couple weeks ago my sister asked my to stay at her house while she and her man went to a movie ~ all the kids were asleep. As she was walking out the door she says "If Bethany wakes, just give her a bottle" "HUH?!" "WAIT!" "How in the hell do I do that?!" I said. THANK GOD Bethany never woke:)<br>  <br>  BTW: I think it's kinda sad that we can't even converse openly about breastfeeding without being accused of trying to start problems. Can we say sensitive:)|`|7f40a0efee482e94e2baa04fac426e33aa	do you feel awkward or naive when it comes to bottles<br>  <br>  No i breast fed and worked so i had to put the breast milk some where.And it was easier and my older ones helped bottle feed the babies. And it gave me time off the every 2 and a half hours having to sit still for 20 Min's when i had stuff i needed to do.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	I probably would have chucked the bottle right back at her.<br>  <br>  I'd rather change a poopy diaper than smell formula.  <br>  <br>  I'm also not a fan of dumping babies on people.  I won't say I've never dumped baby on daddy, but I don't do it to anyone else unless I am running to get my older child or something that can't wait the 10 seconds it takes to ask.|`|AA10015577	I breastfed exclusively for 15 months (introduced whole milk at a year) but I pumped and bottle fed as well so my hubby could have some part in the feedings.  I never felt that way I guess.|`|kGfd8DWWaa	I tried breast feeding and I don't produce enough milk (go figure with a set of natural DD breast) and I felt like a failure for not breastfeeding and using a bottle. But I finally got a hang of it with the help of my dad. He was s single parent with me and the best advice he gave me was the pillow prop which helped when i had so much to do and i needed that five minute break!|`|2DahzSWvaa	I never feel awkward or naive. It's an individuals decision if they want to bottle feed or breastfeed. I decided to breastfeed, and that was my personal decision.|`|AA10893102	Actually, yes. Mainly because people (usually other patients at my son's check ups) ask "How many ounces of formula does he take?"<br>  <br>  Honestly, I am so glad I breastfeed because formula seems so complicated...|`|FLEXqVoiaa	My daughter does get bottles while I'm at work, but I've never given her one. I do think it would be strange, even though my son was bottle fed only from the time he was 3 months.|`|txv7TIgiaa	yeah i can understand it would be weird for me to give a bottle to a baby, my daughter is like your oldest daughter....|`|OV0ujHlOaa	No, I have never felt that way. But your feelings can't be wrong or right, they're your feelings.|`|IXBl5l5kaa	My daughter is breastfed but since I work full-time she does get bottles. The few times I did offer bottles it was awkward. I did it because I feared nursing in public, but after a month or so of the hassle of carrying bottles and warming milk I just started nursing in public. I haven't bottle fed in several months and just don't care to do so. I guess psychologically it's my job to feed her if I'm available so I feel that is how it should be.<br>  <br>  I have been at my daughter's daycare talking to her provider before when she is feeding other babies formula. One baby spit up and I could immediately tell it was formula spits lol. I asked her, since she breastfed her kids, how it was to offer formula bottles. She just does it because the kiddo has to eat. She was devastated when her child weaned after 4 months so she experienced the formula feeding and knew it had to be done if her child wanted to survive lol.<br>  <br>  <br>  ***Here is info on pumping and bottlefeeding breastfed babies :)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/pumping/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/pumping/index...</a>|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	Idk, I plan on bottle feeding and breast feeding, but there will be brest milk in the bottle, Would you rather be handed a boob to feed your great step nephew? lol if you ask me that would be awkward
MHOxPs8Oaa	Your friend doesn't have her own house, you do.  This is why I am sick of people having babies who cannot afford them.<br>  <br>  Edit: Well, if you didn't have a kid would you be complaining about this right now? Also, that is why people have an option of changing jobs and moving.|`|qrfJ0ffiaa	From my knowledge of dealing with councils, if your friends mum wrote them a letter saying she could no longer stay there and there isnt enough room, then they have to move her higher up the list. My SIL had my MIL write her a letter stating that she couldnt live there anymore as she didnt get on with her step-father and they put her in a hostel for 4 days then gave her a 3bed house!!!! So maybe thats what they have done! I do agree with you though, when I lost my job through illness and had no source of income I tried to get help from DWP and local authorities only to be told that because I was co-habiting with someone who had a job (my partner) I was entitled to nothing.. Thankfully before my daughter was born he was promoted and gets over double what he was on when it was just the two of us! But at my time in need I was turned away.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	I know if I were forced to live with my mom that would be a HUGE problem, both for me and my kids.<br>  <br>  And she has a tonne of extra room.<br>  <br>  If you have an extra room (ie a bed room, a kitchen, a bathroom, and two other rooms) then I can't see why you wouldn't be able to use one of them as a bedroom.  I know lots of families that give up the "dining room" to have an extra bedroom.|`|dXVA1wHDaa	To answer your question, no I don't think it's fair.  She clearly has more than enough room, you don't.  That's the basic facts.  <br>  <br>  I don't understand how they can think a couple with a child in a 1 bedroom place is adequate housing.  What happens when your son gets too old to share a room?|`|n6XYYyoLaa	just do the best you can, too many things in life aren't fair, but unfortunately we have to make do......sorry to hear u r in this situation....but, at least while baby is young, they won't remember sharing a room with you at all...|`|zlGb9NkZaa	as someone in a similar situation to your friend, i honestly think it *is* fair. i can say that i would much rather have a one bedroom home of my OWN rather than living in *one* of the bedrooms at my mom's house with my baby. sure, there are more bedrooms, but they're full of her stuff. i also don't think it's very fair to my mom (and probably your friend's) that she had to clear out so much of her stuff to make room for us, and i'm very grateful, but feel like a huge burden. the space is NOT mine but my mom's. all my stuff is in storage. the kitchen is hers. the bathroom is hers. the living room is hers. i've only got one bedroom to share with my baby--we don't have our OWN space, my MOM has plenty of space in which we are intruding.<br>  <br>  would YOU rather live with a family member in *their* bigger house or where you already are, with your OWN space???<br>  <br>  {oh, and "<3" shut your trap}|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	I don't know what a band 5 is and I'm not sure about a keyworker housing scheme but where I live,low income housing has a system based on priority as well. If you are living in your own place (small or not) you are ranked lower because someone living with family is considered homeless. That's what my understanding of the system here is.|`|ay8tXLD2aa	Yes, I agree with you that when you look at it from one point, it seems unfair. But, the way the housing scheme works is that a family has the "right" to live in their own dwelling, not to have to live with family members. So, she is a higher priority than you are.  It's crap though when the law is written in such a way that the council isn't able to look at things individually, all they an do is apply the rules to each situation. <br>  Hope you're able to get a nice place soon!|`|f4zg7LHLaa	don't listen to <3. i had a run in with her the other day when she tried to tell me what to feed my son. <br>  <br>  are you sure your friend isn't lying to them about her situation? she could be saying she lives somewhere else.|`|etHC9ajHaa	what council you with|`|6MG9anjBaa	hi hunni don't listen to those judgemental people sometimes you gotta do what u gotta do<br>  i think it is Absolutely ridiculous how they work it all out we had 4 boys in a two bedroom flat (6 people in all) but because two of them didn't have permanent residence they weren't counted  we waited 6 years for a house there was no way we could get ￡1000 for a deposit on a house while raising 4 kids (if we wanted to eat lol)<br>  there needs to be a new system worked out that uses the overall picture not just that person has a house they are Living with family <br>  <br>  anyways good luck on getting yourselves a house. xxx :)|`|b8f0CfSsaa	The system is ridiculous. They will see your friend as someone who does not have access to her own home and you as someone who has means to provide her own home.<br>  <br>  Are you talking about the home buy scheme for key workers or is it something different? They shouldn't be telling you to use the lounge as a bedroom, on the housing benefits scheme they wouldn't (which is ridiculous as you are a key worker not someone who is reliant on the state). I don't know much about the key worker scheme but with housing benefits you are entitled to 1 room for you and your partner and 1 room for a dependant. It could be the case that because it is London and spaces are limited they are talking out of their back sides because they need to keep succesful applications down. Try talking to your local CAB office and they may be able to advise better than me (I am going on what my father used to tell me when he worked for the DWP)<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  <3, you shouldn't be so judgemental.I doubt you have any comprehension of how expensive London can be and it isn't that easy to just up and move.

It's a lovely name for a boy...Shemale Lesbian.|`|kEUhJQjvaa	its a nice name and a nice idea but it may cause bullying problems for the child in later life. you could try spelling it different to avoid teasing?|`|fc86fd8186452c131ac277bbecc2bb16aa	i would say it doesnt matter what anybody says if you like i would go with it remember if we went for the only names that people liked then we would probably all have the same name.|`|aLGe7JZEaa	If you want to use that name spell it the way it is pronouced.|`|lj1OCKGDaa	No way
w2kofruFaa	I'm in the same boat, sweetheart. My ex and I dated for a year and a half, and broke up a month ago tomorrow.<br>  <br>  I honestly want other guys to like me, to talk to someone else, but it seems like he's always there and I somehow manage to bring him up, even when I'm talking to my mom or girl friends. So far, I haven't "talked" or tried to "talk" to another guy because I don't want to get too tied down right now because I've been having so much fun partying, but I do want other guys to want me, if that makes sense. And I feel like I'm over him.. most days anyway.<br>  <br>  The only advice I can give you, and myself, is.. Don't try to forget him or what you shared. After all, he was part of your life. Just put the HERE and NOW in mind at all times. I think with time it'll get easier because honestly, I found it was less hard this weekend than last..|`|Uv8TBb1Uaa	you probably dont need to start getting into a new relationship, because you're obviously still not over your ex
9tcTtw6Vaa	My favorite is Sophia Grace (which is beautiful) and Caleb Michael, because they match. Say them aloud, and see which ones sound good together--Juliette and Thomas...Kameryn and Jack...Sophia and Caleb...Gracie and Alexander...Spencer and Zackary.<br>  With Kameryn and Jack, the name Kameryn is much more unusual than the name Jack, which could be uncomfortable for your kids. Gracie May sounds like a name that would be good for a six-year-old, but maybe not for a 21-year-old...and especially next to Alexander William, which is very formal sounding. Spencer may feel awkward when people invariably think that she and Zackary are both boys when they see the names written.  Something to keep in mind...you can mix and match the names, as long as they still "fit" together.|`|9tcTtw6Vaa	My favorite is Sophia Grace (which is beautiful) and Caleb Michael, because they match.

Also think about the first names together without the middle names. You won't use the middle names very often. Imagine yourself calling for your kids....Juliette and Thomas...or whatever names you choose...also I wouldn't recommend naming I girl who has a twin brother Spencer, mostly because it may cause some confusion about whether you have twin boys or one of each, because Spencer is more commonly a boy name.

BARCjDhnaa	Not sure if your period is late now or what? If it is you may have tested too soon or you may have just been lucky with the pulling out method, not a good way of preventing pregnancy by the way, try condoms.  Check out this site for info on pregnancy tests and the early sign of pregnancy good luck!|`|sw2R5A9iaa	what does you gyn say??
qqiVKUBpaa	Yep, I worked in a medical records department at a hospital and I saw a ton of Trinity's, no Neo's though.|`|I1ZAEmLsaa	i duno but the name trinity is well nice still.|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	Trinity, yes. I haven't heard of any Neos yet though.|`|541ni2a9aa	who cares... and if they did they are retarded.|`|9n0NrReyaa	Well I know that my fiancee's first cousin and his wife named their little girl Trinity Carrianne, she's 3 now.|`|OHfZFR31aa	I haven't heard Neo, but I've seen quite a few people on this board mentioning Trinity as a possible girls name<br>  <br>  While Neo doesn't rank in the Top 1000 names on the Social Security list, Trinity was the #72 most popular girls name in 2007. I had no idea it was a Top 100 name.|`|32747dcd374c857319720ae0aa088b0faa	The female name Trinity has actually been around forever (it's right up there with other female names such as Faith, Hope, Charity, that have religious origins). I know two people who are probably in their 30's or 40's named Trinity. But it wouldn't surprise me to hear that the name's popularity surged as a result of the movies.<br>  <br>  I have yet to meet anyone named Neo.
NYJgiVxraa	i think you need to be pretty honest with her and say that youve lost alot of contact with this girl, and youve moved on. yes this is pretty beeyotch but you wanna b truthful. shes clearly not a good influence in any particular matter. you can try asking her to go to some teen groups that get together if they are having problems emotinally and such in their lives..|`|7XizbF6Caa	nah **** tell her to **** offff
VMASMHX6aa	An ovulation test can be used as a pregnancy test.<br>  <br>  But seeing 2 lines on an ovulation test does not mean that you a pregnant!<br>  Ovulation tests detect LH. Women always have LH in their bodies so it's normal to see 2 lines. If you were pregnant the test would have come up positive.|`|ccqOhsGtaa	I was wondering the same last night as I am 5 weeks pregnant & it came up positive!!!  I realy wouldn't rely on these tho!!<br>  <br>  Good Luck x|`|oqUlYXqtaa	this is a good question, and no, unfortuantely you cannot use an ovulation test as a pregnancy test.<br>  you can also ask fertility specialists online for free, try fertilityties.com<br>  good luck and babydust!|`|jzAfst8Taa	Overall-- yes, it can be done. Ovulation predictor tests (known as OPK's because they are normally sold in a set of tests known as a "kit," thus the K) will show a positive result when a woman is pregnant, as well as when she's ovulating. <br>  <br>  Specifically-- while it works most of the time, there are good reasons to avoid using an OPK as an HPT for diagnostic purposes. If you want to pee on any stick that will stand still after you know you're pregnant, just for fun, have at it. But I would not recommend using an OPK in place of an HPT overall. <br>  <br>  Reasoning-- OPK's detect LH (luteinizing hormone) which is the hormone associated with ovulation. Pregnancy tests detect hCG, the hormone associated with pregnancy. LH and hCG are, at a molecular level, nearly identical. hCG has a beta subunit, meaning it has an extra little "doodad." To use a stupid but easy to understand example, LH and hCG are identical twins, except that hCG wears a funny hat|`|oHNrktxTaa	No, unfortunately the OPK sticks can't determine whether or not if you are pregnant. You need to purchase a HPT & test first thing in the morning. Your urine has the highest concentrate in it than.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!|`|739d2c0f3a827ed66532c97b8757d73faa	yes you can I had taken an preg test got a positive result and I took an ovulation test and got an positive and I know for sure that i was pregnant, good luck|`|vtcJsnCsaa	No you cant use an olulation test to see if you are pregnant or not. An ovulation test just tells you when the best days to try and concieve are. To see whether you are pregnant or not, it is best to use a pregnancy test. Good luck x|`|ufQgW1Cwaa	well i got a positive pt and so i wanted to know the answer to that so i did an ov test and it said no the line was not as dark as or dark than the test line|`|Npy1kswWaa	No that's why they have don't have the same name.|`|p7HaGkQUaa	no you cant. x
A8t8bcJKaa	They should have whatever rights the non-mentally ill people have, & we, as well as others should have a lawyer if something goes wrong. We're humans, too. Not all mentally ill people are bad/criminal. If you comply with psychiatric treatment, therapy, counseling, medicine, etc., then you can do as well in society as anyone else.<br>  <br>  You just have to know your triggers. What triggers your symptoms, try as much as possible to avoid it. You'll be alright.|`|Oo9B0oHWaa	I think we should lock em up in cages and claim the devil is possessing them<br>  <br>  Oh wait that didnt work out so well in Victorian England<br>  <br>  Why dont we just try to abort them as early as possible during pregancy and provide government funded social program to help out the unlucky ones who are birthed, treat them as well as we can and hope they can enjoy life as stunted beings, its harsh but true<br>  They shoudnt get any lower or special rights<br>  If you live in America its different than socialized nations like my home Canada or in Europe, you get your baby tested, if you dont want to abort them start saving for your health insuance payments now<br>  And "Asylums" or special hospitals should be government inspected to make sure their arent abuses taking place<br>  Also we need to better define who is mentally ill and who is just flat out dangerous<br>  VINCENT LI BELONGS IN PRISON, NOT A HOSPITAL, **** YOU CANADA|`|3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	If you have mental illness & are planning to have a baby, make sure you work with your psychiatrist, because most psychiatric meds will harm a fetus. But if you go off your meds, you may get very sick & end up in a hospital.<br>  <br>  As long as you are taking care of your baby/child, and are keeping them safe, and not abusing them, that is what the social services care about. There are many good parents with mental illnesses. Sometimes, mental illnesses interfere with good care though. You have to feed your baby even if you are bawling for hours in bed, you have to take your child to the doctor even if you are afraid to leave your home, etc.  You have to deal with your baby interrupting your sleep constantly. This is why I didn't have kids-  my bipolar was too severe to handle these issues. The people I have known who lost their kids to the foster care system had very dirty houses - they were too depressed to do ANY kind of cleaning.
NaJPIOheaa	Hey hun, I am so sorry for your loss! I understand how you feel, and it is very unexplainable! I had an ectopic pregnancy, and I also had my right tube removed. We have been TTC now on and off for 2 years, all together a year probably, but you have to realize that with only one fallopian tube it will take a bit longer to conceive. There are days I think, very positively, or very negatively. I too am going to get a HSG test done to see if my left fallopian tube is open. I do have to say that when you go get the lap dye test, that this usually results in unblocking the tubes(if they are blocked), and this is usually when couples conceive. Don't give up hope! I wish you the best of luck & tons of baby dust! xo|`|b8f0CfSsaa	Oh dear I am sorry for your loss.<br>  <br>  My aunt used IVF for her first post-ectopic child then two years later she had a missed period and took a test, it came back positive! So she had to use IVF once but could get pregnant without. She only had one tube btw.<br>  <br>  Don't despair, you will be blessed one day!|`|q4WtQvSZaa	So sorry to hear about your loss.<br>  <br>  I have got pregnant twice with only one ovary and tubes that have suffered from endometriosis so it can be done.  The human body is a remarkable thing, and I know lots of women who've been told flat out they can't have children who have gone on to have them - doctors don't know for usre, they can only give you their best guess.|`|ANnPZWm2aa	i know someone who went through nearly the same thing, and she still got pregnant after. she also had had kids previously. this was also 20 years ago before all the fertility treatments we have now. dont give up hope, if its ment to be, it will happen, at least thats what i always think.|`|u4FUeppNaa	You only need one tube to get pregnant since they take turns releasing eggs. a friend of mine had an ovary and tube removed due to a tumor in October, got pregnant in december and had a miscarriage and then got pregnant again in January. So it is very possible with only one tube. As far as damaged or blocked I don't know
n6XYYyoLaa	if u are concerned about it call your doc, but i think at her age, she's so close to a year, it probably won't be much of a prob..might want to mix some formula into it until you have gotten to all whole milk to make her tummy transition a little easier...|`|8a56McQzaa	I am a nurse, and we tell all of the mothers to breastfeed or formula feed until one year old.  HOWEVER!!! With my children, if they did what yours is doing, I gradually weaned them off formula a bit early. Try the milk and if there are no adverse reactions, such as vomiting, constipation, diarrhea...dont worry about it.  Make sure she is getting enough nutrients, fruits, veggies.<br>  And just a reminder, keep her updated on her vaccinations!<br>  FYI-now is the time to get rid of the bottle!|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	You can but you should consider using vitamin drops unless she eats a wide variety of other foods.|`|16827288a6ef61faf9d2e2c99f7102edaa	give her milk and a sippy cup. she doesn't need the bottle if she throws it.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	You should continue some formula at this point, but introducing a little milk at meal times is just fine.  Its will help make weaning and the transition onto whole milk and solids only much easier. <br>  <br>  Go ahead and try giving some whole milk, anyone who tells you differently is just being redicoulous.|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	Yeah you can.
FLEXqVoiaa	My husband's grandma claims he and his sister were walking at 4 months-Although his mother said he wasn't walking until after 1 year. So sometimes loved ones tend to stretch the truth-Possibly because they don't remember.|`|2F5HNPqPaa	I sat at 4 months, walked at 8 months and could read and write by age 2.  I saw an educational psychologist when I started school and he said I was the most gifted child he'd ever seen - except for my maths, that was average.  <br>  <br>  When my mum was breastfeeding my younger brother (I'd just turned 2 and was playing up), she called me a silly little cow and I replied, "You can't milk me!".  <br>  <br>  It all appears to mean nothing though.  Now I'm an everyday nobody.  It seems you're just another mystery.  Have a happy life!|`|ZXDKEe5laa	My son could say mama dada at 4 months and he was speaking in sentences at the age of 13 months and he is a normal child who actually struggles in math so yes I would say it is normal every child is different.|`|oXEEMAL0aa	maybe your mom exaggerated a bit to make you sound better than her friends who had kids your age. I know my kids all started the mama, dada, baba,etc... at around 4 months old but that's normal and those are just sounds not actual words.<br>  Hyperactivity is such a hard thing to determine at a young age.  All kids are active and excitable and curious at the age of two yet one might think it's hyperactivity when it's not.<br>  You sound like you were a smart kid as all kids are smart.  Please keep in mind that all kids develop at different rates and children shouldn't be compared with other children as all children are different.|`|xMnN99T8aa	Your mom is exaggerating a little. I guess it's because she loves you.|`|TJusfEnlaa	yeah mums do that a bit - lol <br>  what are u like now?|`|hQ8uCFqEaa	I definitely agree with Paul RN !!!

My kids made me push harder for my hopes and dreams. Funny huh?|`|AA11476951	When I had my kids, all my hopes and dreams came true!|`|bTqnkyIAaa	It doesn't have to be that way.  Why not accomplish the things you want to before you have kids?  I had my first at 25, which is considered young by some, but I still covered pretty much everything I ever wanted. I had traveled the world extensively, been to all the parties and events I could ever dream of- so when I had kids, I really have no longing for what could have been- I'd already been there done that.  I have no resentment (aside from my lack of sleep, but that's worth it) towards my kids.  The times that we do get a babysitter and go out, I wonder why I ever liked going to bars and clubs, etc.  Someday, the kids will be grown and you can do the things that you feel you missed out on.  Enjoy the present, there is no point in dwelling over the past.  Hope you find a happy place.  :)|`|oXEEMAL0aa	funny cause i used to think that until i had kids, now my kids are my hopes and dreams and they are a part of everything i do.

uVbTJw9daa	Best at his age to keep him covered up  and in the shade as much as possible. I have rarely put sunblock on a child younger then 6 months. You can use any sunblock on him, though I would not put it on his forehead or to close to his eyes. Baby sunblock is no magic cure, most are not sweat proof or waterproof, if you were to put it near his eyes it might run into them. Sunblock should really only be used this young if there is no way to avoid the sun.Use sunscreen on small areas of the body, such as the face and the backs of the hands, if protective clothing and shade are not available  Dress him in light weight clothes and keep a brimmed hat on him.Select clothes made with a tight weave - they protect better than clothes with a looser weave. If you’re not sure how tight a fabric’s weave is, hold it up to see how much light shines through. The less light, the better. Make sure the sunscreen  has a SPF of at least 30|`|d092475deaa61dba856bb6c8d78f69d3aa	Babies need to use a special type of sunscreen because one of the "chemicals" or whatever they use in adult sunscreen is dangerous to babies. I forget what it is exactly but I used to work at Babies R Us and I remember always making sure it was the correct stuff. I'm sure it says somewhere online....babycenter.com or babyzone.com...which stuff to look out for.|`|FLEXqVoiaa	It wouldn't be the worst thing to di-If you're in a situation where it's all you have, it's better than nothing. It will still protect his skin.<br>  <br>  The issue is that adult sunscreen could cause a baby's sensitive skin to develop a rash-Not on all babies, but some. Also adult sunscreen is thicker, and could block a baby's tiny sweat glands and cause overheating. If you use the thinnest layer possible, that shouldn't be a problem. And, babies tend to put their hands in their mouths-Baby sunscreen is generally formulated specially so that if your baby does ingest a tiny amount, he will be OK. I'm not sure if adult formulas are the same, though.|`|bZiAr0Djaa	no.  For one thing their skin is alot more sensitive then ours and it may cause a reaction.  Another thing is. the baby can sweat or something and some can get into her eyes.  You need to find some that is made for a baby.|`|hQ8uCFqEaa	use the baby kind for babies! babies have sensitive skin!!<br>  the kind specifically made for babies has a higher spf...<br>  make sure the spf is atleast 60 my dr said
wkd5CMNaaa	Colostrum is the first milk your body will start producing during pregnancy. Colostrum is the creamy yellow or golden substance that is present in the breasts before the mature milk is made. Colostrum is very high in protein and provides an important “super boost” of antibodies to protect your baby and strengthen the immune system. The colostrum also serves many other important functions to you and your baby.<br>  <br>  Has a laxative effect that helps your baby pass the first few black, tarry stools called meconium (usually within the first 24 to 48 hours after birth). <br>   <br>  When your baby starts suckling at your breast for the colostrum, this stimulates your body to start producing the mature milk. <br>   <br>  The suckling also creates a surge of the hormone oxytocin in your body, which helps your uterus to contract and shrink down to its pre-pregnant size.|`|nQyJFOMZaa	colostrum is not milk it is what your body produces before milk. It's Yellowish in color and a little thicker, it's low in fat and calories and has a lot of your anti-bodies in it. Breast milk comes in 3-5 days after delivery and your breast will engorged the milk then is a little thinner and is white, but blue, yellow, brown or even reddish tones in the milk is also normal.|`|AA12395149	Colostrum is more yellow than breast milk.  It contains a lot of antibodies from you to help protect the baby and more protein than breast milk.  Breast milk has a higher content of fat making it whiter, but it still has carbohydrates, protein, other components and antibodies as well (you give your baby antibodies until about six months with breast milk).|`|DO0DWnBPaa	there really isnt a difference between the two, one just has more vitamins that help support the immune system|`|f9lZK2aKaa	Babies are born with little immunity. Colostrum, yellow, watery pre-milk produced the first few days of feeding, is packed full of protective nutrients. It can also help with the baby's digestive system. This will help eliminate painful gas and cramping later on.<br>  I know it is important because I have seen the development of premature babies grow stronger from breastfeeding compared to formula feeding. Good luck.<br>  God Bless!!|`|eBEfZO9eaa	I believe colostrum comes before actual breast milk and is high in antioxidants, vitamins and minerals.  Supposed to be good for building up the immune system in babies.|`|uuHPneEcaa	its not milk I  know that for a fact. <br>  <br>  breast milk is thicker (not alot though)|`|QYYWBrG7aa	colostrum isnt milk.
oXCo6VX4aa	Oh my gosh, YES!  Due on June 26th and I can't wait!  The first trimester was horrible with morning sickness and so far the second trimester I've had my appendix out and had my first kidney stone (which incidentally will not pass due to the weight of the uterus pressing down).

That's why I'm not too anxious yet. I'm feeling good! I don't even feel pregnant. I feel so much better than I did when I was pregnant with my daughter. Hardly any back pain yet. WOohoo!

This is our first and is really going to change our world!  We are both over 35 and used to it being just the two of us, our two cats and doggie. I feel really good, except I work too much and by the end of the day I'm usually to tired to do anything but put my feet up and rest.  I'd kind of like mine to hold off an extra week or so, too.  My grandmother will turn 91 on July 5th, and I'd love for our child to be a great birthday gift to her! Good luck!|`|rh5HjBJbaa	I'm due on June 19th and no, I'm not ready yet. I have a 3 year old too and I don't think I'm ready yet to be controlling both of them! I'm definitely more uncomfortable this time than last and those pesky pregnancy things have been effecting me more this time. But, I'm still glad it's a few months away. By May, I'll be wishing it was over! :)|`|HOdblqIkaa	Im due june 5th and sometimes i want them out sometimes i wish i could stay pregnant a bit longer because i know when they get here i wont be ready even though i feel like there is nothing else i can do to get more prepared! mine are due a week after my birthday which is may 29th so im hoping they stay put till at least then. my fiancee cant wait and wants June to hurry up but i think his mother is the most excited. besides the peeing alot and the constant baby in my ribs im loving every minute of it. congrats to you on your little Robert Junior!|`|buoqtZeFaa	I feel the same way you do.  I am due May 5th (with my first) but I am hoping for May 2nd cause that my b-day lol (29ohhh nooo).  I am in most of my pain at night and it's getting harder and harder every night to go to sleep.  I try to complain less as possible but I feel I have the right lol.  It's funny though if I was having a boy we were thinking of naming him Michael Paul (after his father lol)<br>  <br>  Well I wish you the best of luck!!
oXzHvsBpaa	My son has it he is almost 4 months old and has had it since birth pretty much. They put him on Zantac twice a day and when that isn't enough Mylanta twice a day on top of the Zantac. My son is a stomach sleeper. Though when he was on his back we always put a pillow under the mattress of his crib. We also keep him up right for about half an hour after his feedings. We usually just put him in his bumbo seat. It really does sound like reflux. Drooling is a symptom of AR. My son does drool a lot. Talk to your doctor if you haven't already about maybe putting her on medicaiton.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	my dd is and has been on for most of her life zantac, she's 9 mos tomorrow...best thing is after you feed her, keep her up at least a 45 degree angle for 30mins, no tummy time or anything that puts pressure on it for at least an hour; mine drools too but it's from teething, i don't think your baby is drooling from reflux...if your baby is on a med and it still crying in pain, you need to talk to the doc and see if they can change it to something that works better for her...<br>  if she is formula fed, ask your doc about trying enfamil AR; it's thickened with rice starch to help reflux babies keep it down, thickens again when it  hits the stomach, so less is coming back up from the stomach into the esophagus...worked wonders for us....gl, hth|`|zwctZ812aa	My 4 month old has acid reflux...it kicked in around 2 weeks of age.  We give him zantac and it seems to help.  The crying when she is flat on her back is rerflux pain...are you giving her anything for it?  If you are, it may not be working, the meds should eliminate most of the discomfort associated with GERD.  My son does drool a lot, but I think it is more from teething that from his reflux.  Always make sure you hold your daughter upright for at least 20 minutes after a feeding.  This usually helps with the reflux. Do you have a crib wedge for her crib? Sleeping on an incline also helps.  If she is 3 months or older, try getting a bumbo seat.  My son loves to sit up in his bumbo seat.  A bouncer could also work for times wehn you need to set her down if she doesn't like laying flat on her back.  Good luck!|`|UghJ0XROaa	My daughter is four months and has acid reflux, she generally hates being on her back, although since she is now taking baby zantac she can handle it for longer. And yes, i do think it's because of the acid coming up from their bellies that is hurting them. I prop her as much as possible, she prefers being on her belly and i think that might be because it is more comfortable due to the acid reflux. Yes, she drools all the time, lol, i just thought that was baby drool, never associated that with the acid reflux.<br>  <br>  My daughter is also a belly sleeper, because putting her on an incline was pretty much ineffective for.|`|9L4l1OMBaa	My infant daughter had acid reflux and spent the first 3 months of her life screaming until we figured out what the problem was and worked on correcting it. <br>  She was prescribed Axid by her pediatrician which worked wonders and we also used a wedge to prop up one end of her crib mattress.  If she isn't sleeping in a crib yet, letting her sleep in her bouncy seat or car seat can help too.|`|UkQuMykiaa	Our daughter was dx'd with acid reflux when she about 3 days old and still in the NICU.  The dr. suspected when she kept spitting up most of what was being fed to her (through her tube feeding).  They did an upper GI and found that this was what is was.  Our pediatrician put he on Zantac every 8 hours. Unfortunately we had kind of slacked at giving her her medicine because she seemed like she was doing ok - big mistake! For a couple days she was VERY fussy and would gag often for an hour or more after she took her bottle. So we are faithfully giving her her medicine every 8 hours again until the dr tells us she does not need it.  I have her sitting in her car seat right now to keep her upright after she ate.  She does much better if she is sitting up a little and she doesn't spit as much.  I do believe the acid reflux causes discomfort to them just as severe heartburn would for us.  She is only 5 weeks so she does not drool too much yet.|`|EDqhhCQdaa	My daughter has had it since she was born she is 4 months old now and still has it. She sleeps next to me elevated on a pillow she has never been able to sleep laying flat.

6TuxC5BLaa	I know other people who have been through that, what i would suggest is that try not to get yourself too stressed about it (which might be difficult) and also don't do anything strenuous. Stressing yourself might cause you to loose the baby so please try and get your mind of that and think it is normal because it is.If the doctors say the baby is ok then the only thing you can also do is keep praying to God for protection and guidance.|`|h5cFkP35aa	my mother had her period for the first 6 months of pregnancy with both of her kids. she never found out why though. but if the doctors say everything is okay, i wouldnt worry hun.|`|AA10153923	I had spotting and heavy bleeding and clots for 2 weeks.<br>  I was about one month.<br>  No pain,<br>  I was just spotting, its normal.<br>  <br>  I am now 18 weeks.

I took a weeks holiday from work (my works quite physical) and i found that really helped.<br>  Nothing i say will stop you worrying, just make sure you look after yourself and talk to your partner/close freinds/family i was so glad i talked to them about my worries, it does help.<br>  <br>  Take Care and i wish you and baby all the luck, the heartbeat is a brilliant sign.<br>  x x x|`|delMvf8iaa	I had a similar thing to happen to me .The doctor said the fetus was attaching to my womb.

My situation is unique. I am pregnant with a Mirena IUD that can not be removed. I have bled the entire time I have been pregnant. Some days it super heavy, other days no so much. My cervix is also closed and the baby is doing fine so far. my doctor told me that if we do not consider the IUD as the cause of the bleeding then it could be that small parts of the placenta have broken off , causing the bleeding, then it clots itself and you then pass the clots in what appears to be some light to heavy period bleeding.He claims this is not uncommon during early pregnancy. But then again they claimed my chances of getting pregnant with a Mirena were 1 in over a million.If the bleeding is brown I would not worry to much about it, just keep your dr. informed. If it is bright red and some what heavy I would get into the doctor as often as possible to ensure the baby is still ok.
5axGfFofaa	I have found cheap test work just as well.  I took a digital CVS brand  (2 for 9.99) 11DPO this week (in the afternoon) and got a positive.  I took a $1 dollar general test 10 DPO this week and got a line (not a faint line but an obvious line)  I also took it in the afternoon.  I used to buy the expensive test but have learned to save my $$$.  In the past, I used clearblue easy digital and got a positive 9 DPO (in the afternoon)...I had a m/c so then next time, I took a Clearblue, I got negative 12 DPO (afternoon) but positive 13 DPO with first morning urine ( I had a positive 12 DPO with first response: 2 lines (very faint) 12 DPO with FMU that time)...also had another m/c so I am becoming a pee on a stick expert!  Save your money.  I also like the $1 test b/c you can buy 10 or so and test as many times as you want without killing your wallet.

FLEXqVoiaa	Yes it's normal. I vomited every time I ate/drank for an entire day after my first baby (vaginal birth) and for 2 days after my second (c-section).

I had this horrible taste in my mouth for 2 weeks and it felt like my stomach was in my throat.  I think during the c-section all your organs are pushed and pulled and I think that really upsets your whole system.  But once you recover then everything pretty much goes back to normal.|`|WPI0Z47saa	When I was in labor I actually vomited with every contraction and I did end up getting an emergency c-section but not because of that.

Vv7a31pmaa	This is sort of normal.<br>  <br>  Kids are curious.<br>  <br>  but you need to set the boundaries and tell them not to do this.|`|ns1F0p8Laa	kids will be kids they are just curious and normal.  you just have to let them know that it is wrong.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Talk to your brother/sister about how you two should deal with this.<br>  <br>  You two should then sit the kids down together and explain to them that touching anyone else' privates is naughty and you shouldn't do it.|`|8SjoUQmEaa	Well, what you should do is just explain to them that certain body parts are private, and no one is allowed to touch them except a mommy or a doctor, and only if you're having problems with them. <br>  <br>  It's normal for kids this age to be curious, but if they continue to do this after being told it's wrong, or start to try to hide this behavior (like if they know it's wrong) then you might want to investigate where they learned this from.|`|UtCkgs18aa	You need to calmly tell them both doing that is inappropriate.

Teach her about condoms... put her on birth control... but don't be scared about these things and your daughter knowing about them; you are educating your daughter, who is to become a young woman, and KEEPING HER SAFE from disease and unwanted pregnancy... as a mother should!<br>  <br>  good luck
qBtTAgBqaa	Babies and young children are still "connected" to the other side. Their crown chakra is still open and connected to the spirit world. They can see angels, spirits, etc. As they become more grounded and "skepticism" starts to appear, then these "sightings" often will stop.<br>  <br>  When my 6yr old was 2-3yrs old he used to see things too. One day I was buckling him in his carseat and he was looking over me and said "fire, mommy, fire"  I turned around but didn't see any fire. I asked him where the fire was.. he pointed to the top of my head. I was so shocked.  And for the longest time he could also see my 3rd eye. He'd point to the area of my forehead between my eyes and say "sun" Amazing.  And I know he used to see angels or something when he was a baby. I'd sit with him in the backseat sometimes and he'd be staring at the ceiling of the car. He'd smile and get excited, like something or someone was entertaining him.<br>  <br>  As he got older, and that baby/toddler innocence and fearlessness faded, so did his visions.|`|tOdjjeAmaa	I think it was a big mistake to bring the board into your house.

It shows you put some thought into the gift and didn't just pull out the credit card.  For Christmas my Mom got my daughter and me Mother and Daughter Engraved Bracelets from the store Things Remembered.  I love them, they are so cute.  I'm thinking about getting our pictures taken with them on.<br>  <br>  Check out this website.|`|ccK75CR5aa	I would be a great gift to give it to your baby girl/boy. Think for a minute, Is your child going to be responsible for the thing's that you give him/her or they gonna give it to somebody else that they know that will keep for their self.|`|eBEfZO9eaa	I think it is a very nice and thoughtful gift, but I would take into consideration if they are in any type of financial need that maybe they could use something more practical right now?  If not, the bracelet sounds like a great idea.|`|9L4l1OMBaa	Yes it's a good idea but I would go with a personalized beaded one (TONS on ebay) instead of gold because you don't want to step on any toes by buying heirloom type jewelry.|`|wkd5CMNaaa	I would rather have something I need, like a pack of diapers then jewelry for my baby.|`|5pFhnj1Laa	why don't you just try getting her some clothes and well if you are not to close to her get her something small you know what i mean.|`|t4HXotwEaa	I think that sounds VERY nice.

I know a lot of women who would toss the bracelet in a box and basically forget about it. Its not their thing.<br>  <br>  I never risk personalized stuff at showers. I give essentials like diapers and wipes and if I feel the need to splurge I get a nice cuddly blanket.|`|uuHPneEcaa	its a cute idea. I would do it. that lets the mother to be know that u still care about her and her up coming edition. I think the braclet is a great idea.<br>  <br>  and if u wanna u can get something that she needed for the baby also.
690279cb7caa51056d2e306c73dae94faa	I didn't have one because I don't have any friends and my family lives a few states away.  I didn't get anything new, I had to go to the used stores to get all my baby clothes because I can't afford anything new.|`|gyYXV3Bxaa	I did, but I really didn't want one.  I didn't feel it was right to expect my family/friends to provide for my child.  I planned to take money out of savings to buy all that the baby needed.  But my boyfriend's mother (knowing I didn't want a shower), went out and bought invitations and was going to throw me a surprise party! :-(  <br>  <br>  My boyfriend convinced her that a surprise shower would thoroughly piss me off, so she came clean and told me what she was planning.  I called it off, then changed my mind, because I didn't want to hurt her feelings.  I got a few things (diapers, diaper genie, clothes, gift cards), but most of my baby's things my boyfriend and I had already purchased.|`|8WRnqs08aa	I have had a shower with all four of my children. My first three I had just one shower. My fourth, I had two showers; one given by my sister before baby was born, the other given by my MIL after baby was born.<br>  <br>  The best shower I would have to say was my first shower. I received EVERYTHING I needed for baby and had about 40 guests.<br>  <br>  My second & third showers were very small and I received little items that came in handy.<br>  <br>  As there are 11 years between my youngest of the older children and my 8 month old, I was fortunate to have received almost everything I needed for her.<br>  <br>  I am expecting twins in Sept. If they are girls, I will not need any clothing, but I will needan additional car seat, crib, swing and a triple stroller (for my baby & the twins) My sister is giving me her crib & swing, so that really leaves nothing but a car seat & stoller - UNLESS - I have a boy or both boys, then I will need boy clothing!<br>  <br>  In the event that my twins are both girls (oh, I'd love that!) My sister has suggested that she would hold a "Diaper Party," whereas I'd have a shower, but the guests would bring diapers & wipes. I thought this would be an EXCELLENT idea!<br>  <br>  <br>  I think EVERY baby deserves his or her own baby shower (regardless of the age[s] of the previous children!)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Grateful Mother to 4 beautiful children with Twins due Sept. 2009 (Babies #5&6)|`|zwctZ812aa	I had two baby showers.  My parents are going through a nasty divorce with restraining orders, so we had one for my dad's side of the family and family friends on that side, and then one for my mom's side, my friends, and family friends on her side.  I am so glad I had both of them...people wre so great and generous..I hardly had to buy anything for my son.|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	I had a shower. We have a large family, so there were at least 50 people there.

My family threw me one and then the girls at my work threw me another one. I think that it is great for people to throw you a shower because you get a lot of stuff and that will really help you out. I am having another shower for my second baby because it is a girl and I have nothing for a little girl so my mom and mother-in-law is throwing me another. I know some only have one for their first but I think it is okay to have them for subsequent children too.|`|AA10867567	Usually with the first born your mother and mother in law throw a baby shower and invite immediate family and friends this helps the expecting parents get supplies such as diapers, wipes, receiving blankets, photo books, onsies, and several other cute stuff....this shower pretty much gets the parents ready to bring the baby home and if anything wasn't given to you from the shower the still have enough time to purchase whatever else you will need|`|OBU1eDUHaa	Yes-I had 2.  I think it is a great idea because there is sooo much to buy for baby.  Everyone you invite is going to have something in mind that you have not thought about.  Also, they will be so helpful with the advice that you get.  I found that with my shower the gifts that people bought were the gifts that worked the best for them or were the items that they really wanted but never bought for themselves.  A lot of the gifts were really lifesavers, stuff I wouldn't have thought about buying.  Good luck!|`|dnRte8U7aa	I didn't have a shower, but that was for one main reason.  My bridal shower was thrown by my mother in law and EIGHT of her friends... and it was such a huge ridiculous production that it just turned me off to showers in general.  I had 9 of my own guests, but my MIL invited FIFTY of her friends...<br>  <br>  ... and we wore name tags.  I had to wear a freaking name tag to my own shower!!  That, and the wedding (also thrown by the in laws) was so over the top ridiculous as well.<br>  <br>  I couldn't imagine sitting in a room with all these crazy women again, pimping out my child for fluffy pink clothing.  People end up sending gifts anyway after the baby is born.  You end up with way more than you need no matter what!<br>  <br>  I ended up having a lovely dinner with my very closest friends, who had all gotten together and knit me a baby blanket.  That was far more special than a big shower.  But that's just me.|`|AA10972821	My mom threw a baby shower for my first baby...I was 37 weeks along and ended up having him a week later!  I only had the one for that pregnancy and didn't have any for my second pregnancy because everyone was too busy to get one together.|`|KmC0K59taa	I had a small shower given by my MIL.  I almost had a second one given by my friend, but I just had the one.<br>  <br>  It was February and we just had a big snow storm and not too many people were able to make it.  I did get gift cards in the mail though from those who couldn't come.|`|oXzHvsBpaa	Yes I did. I had two showers. One at work and one for family and friends. I had the shower when I was around 32 weeks. I had a great time. Also guys came to both showers.|`|DvrpBX4saa	We did, but not the typical baby shower. In my culture it's common to have a shower and throw it yourself. It's also acceptable for both sexes to come. It's really one big party. We had over 50 people!|`|VTB5QpyBaa	Yes I had three baby showers. One from my husbands family, one from my family, and the people I used to work with threw me one also. Everyone was very generous, I am so very thankful for all of them.|`|CjySz62Haa	i am from europe and back home people do not do baby showers. you never know what is going to happen. you can always celebrate the baby after he is born and okay, when he is 1 month or so. best luck to you!|`|a7c44ca57676a0db1e3d8ad650499612aa	I had a shower for my 1st and 2nd just because mine where 6yrs apart.

It was a joint shower for 4 of us because we all had our babies within a month of each other.<br>  Then when I took my son home to meet grandma when he was 3 months, my relatives all came to visit separately and brought gifts.  Wasn't a shower, but it was nice to see them all.|`|0wTzlG2haa	We ended up with five showers. We didn't live near either of our families at the time, so we travleed to both places and had showers there. Friends where we lived at the time also did a shower and BOTH of the places where my partner and I worked did a shower for us. It was CRAZY! The folks at my work did a "book" shower. They all brought baby or infant books as presents. That was great because by that point we'd had the other showers and we had an insane amount of stuff.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	i did my work had one for me and my family had one. i had the one at work first. my family one was not until after he was born because he was born a month early so it was unexpected. i probably won't for my next child. i realized half the stuff you get you really don't need|`|IlyS8KGzaa	No.  My friends wanted to wait until after my baby was born because we didn't know what I was having.  She just wouldn't show us.  Now Tresa is 12 weeks old, and we still haven't had one.  I guess we probably won't.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	yes
3Sr2FgRfaa	Yes, it is possible, and with that many people in your family having twins you have a higher than average chance. But -- it's probably just paranoia. Let me offer you some scattered thoughts.<br>  <br>  I know it's possible to "know" because I knew with every single one of mine (4 plus one miscarriage, and pregnant again now, about 6 weeks) what the sex was, and knew I was PG before I could have been diagnosed. I've done the same with my friends and acquaintances for years, including twins predictions and miscarriage prediction. However, this is a very specific gift and has no explanation. I could not teach it to you or explain it to you, unfortunately. Utterly useless, except as a conversation piece!<br>  <br>  It is natural to think you're having twins if you're surrounded by people with twins. It's the norm to you, and clearly you understand the difficulties involved in twin raising, like being outnumbered. Your hormones are freaking out, too, so you are likely to wonder and stress over your pregnancy. Your most likely worry? Whatever you're most afraid of. I'm guessing - twins.<br>  <br>  There are some slight differences with multiple-birth pregnancies, mostly exaggerated normal pregnancy symptoms -- for instance, twin mothers are likely to have worse morning sickness. But since no morning sickness is the same, who's to say your terrible puking is not just normal for you? If you find studies about this, don't assume that any exaggerated symptoms you're having mean you are carrying twins.<br>  <br>  FWIW, my intuition says no, that you're having one -- a single -- healthy baby boy. Quit stressing over it already, and get on with the fun part!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Honestly I thought for sure I was having twins...I'm not. It's possible but doesn't "mean" you are having twins if you think you are. BTW I had similar circumstances where my sister had twins and a cousin had a set of twins.|`|eV7rtxmuaa	Im 9 weeks pregnant and up until my dating ultrasound I was sure i was going to have twins. I had never felt that way when I was pregnant with my daughter. However I had my ultrasound and Im carrying a singleton. I have read that if you have a history of twins in your family your odds of having twins are 1 in 72. I know allot of women that have had twins and most of them didnt know they were carrying twins until there ultrasound. All the best|`|gbirLo9Aaa	I believe that it is possible to just know. My cousin Jen jsut recently found out that she was pregnant, but prior to finding out, she felt she just KNEW that she was. She just had a feeling, and she turned out to be right. so you very well could be correct in thinking youre having twins.<br>  good luck, whatever the outcome is.|`|58G7ZAJpaa	I personally think yes.  But sometimes it could be coincidence, and it could just be your conscience.  <br>  <br>  Also, I hope you know with the information given; your chances seem EXTREMELY high for your chances of having twins.<br>  <br>  Congrats and good luck!!

fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Trust me, from experience, a baby can and will eat meat just fine with no teeth.<br>  <br>  Babies can bite, tear, and chew just fine with their gums.  In fact you can ONLY chew with the sides of your jaw where the molars eventually come in, you can't chew with your front teeth -try it.  And almost no toddlers have opposing molars to properly chew when they are entirely on table foods.  So if you wouldn't hesitate to give a food to a toddler with front teeth, than there is no reason not to give it to your baby.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.borstvoeding.com/voedselintroductie/blw/engels.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.borstvoeding.com/voedselintro...</a><br>  General principles of good nutrition for children apply equally to young babies who are managing their own introduction to solid foods. Thus, 'fast foods' and foods with added sugar and salt should be avoided. However, once a baby is over six months old there is no need (unless there is a family history of allergy or a known or suspected digestive disorder) to otherwise restrict the foods that the baby can be offered. Fruit and vegetables are ideal, with harder foods cooked lightly so that they are soft enough to be chewed. At first, meat is best offered as a large piece, to be explored and sucked; once the baby can manage to pick up and release fistfuls of food, minced meat works well. (Note: babies do not need teeth to bite and chew – gums do very well!)<br>  <br>  There is no need to cut food into mouth-sized pieces. Indeed, this will make it difficult for a young baby to handle. A good guide to the size and shape needed is the size of the baby's fist, with one important extra factor to bear in mind: Young babies cannot open their fist on purpose to release things. This means that they do best with food that is chip-shaped or has a built-in 'handle' (like the stalk of a piece of broccoli). They can then chew the bit that is sticking out of their fist and drop the rest later – usually while reaching for the next interesting-looking piece. As their skills improve, less food will be dropped.|`|427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	My youngest had no teeth until after his first birthday, and he was eating basically everything we were at that point.  <br>  <br>  I started by giving him small, pea-sized pieces of chicken, tender pork/beef (although sometimes those are too tough), turkey, ham, fish, etc.  Once he got good at that, I'd give him a small strip of chicken that he could hold and take bites of (if it was tender enough).  Oh, and ground beef is another easy thing to eat b/c it can be broken into such small pieces (like in spaghetti or other casseroles).<br>  <br>  We did almost all table food this time around (very, very little baby food), and my son could chew almost everything with his back gums.  It's amazing what they can do!|`|rjVALevtaa	Do you have a cheese grater? You could use that to shred small pieces of chicken or beef.|`|DO0DWnBPaa	if you have food processor or a blender put it in there until its small enough for him to eat.|`|ay8tXLD2aa	My 7-month old has no teeth and he eats meat!<br>  <br>  Chop it up into the tiniest pieces possible, puree it the same way you puree your fruits and veggies.  Or, mix the tiny pieces into his pureed food. <br>  <br>  Babies have STRONG gums, and they use their gums for mashing up food.  Just becuase there aren't any teeth doesn't mean they don't "chew!"|`|0mbGkwFJaa	You can use any kind of meat you wish, you dont have to buy baby food, infact you can make it at home, I do. You can use a blender and puree the meat as much as you wish, however they should start eating solids before 11 months.|`|9QVjNaIPaa	shred it...i never like pureeing meats much.|`|siDcjgJCaa	You can just chop it up into small pieces ... or you can use lean ground beef.. and crumble it into small chucks.. my daughter is 8 months with no teeth and does very well with both..|`|n6XYYyoLaa	just make sure when you feed something with substance that could possibly be a choking hazard that you are paying attention to him and are not distracted in case he does get a piece he can't handle....i have heard that their gums are very strong..my dd's seem to be when she bites down on my finger, lol...and they can gum most things well enough to eat them without any teeth...and the other poster is correct, ur front teeth are for biting something in two, or tearing it...not chewing....good luck, hope it goes well|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	small piece of chicken turkey even steak- they don't need teeth to chew as long as it's not too tough

I was convinced for a while that I was going to give birth to a cube!<br>  <br>  I'm at 32 weeks now and while I've rounded out a little, I'm still a little squared!<br>  <br>  Take a look...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jenna_alive/3314617519/in/set-72157614641108155/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/jenna_alive...</a>|`|e4596390515e8d11a71ef13fed732cc9aa	Evidently not all are round and your proof of it.  The only true way to know is when you get larger and are closer to month 9.  That is when you get big and the belly is larger due to the baby getting bigger.  Babies are not positioned perfectly round inside.  The bounce and move around until they get closer to birth.|`|qMI6H6Lbaa	remember te baby is not perfectly round. it is very possible that is the way the baby is positioned. later on the baby will turn and you will be getting rounder. before you know it you will be laying on the couch and see a foot roll across your belly. i am already starting to see my daughters feet ( or knee or something else) move and i can see when she completely turns|`|EmhBDHMtaa	i think it just depends on your body b4 you got pregnant...i'm 23w6d with a boy and looks like i gotta a soccer ball in my shirt.<br>  <br>  your belly looks fine..i wouldn't worry about it.|`|delMvf8iaa	Probably not I always wanted one of those cute round bellies but didn't have one.But all pregnant women look beautiful.So don't fret about your belly being perfectly round.It's whats inside that's perfect.Best of luck
vygYFdsSaa	I'm sure its possible. Just for a guideline, at 16 weeks the top of your uterus is halfway between your belly button and pubic bone. I started noticing the hardening you're talking about at 15 weeks|`|2DXXEOrYaa	if its at 10 weeks and stretching already, you may have more than one in there, or a dangerously large baby, maybe even a cyst on your uterus. Mine didnt start popping out til the 5th month. Im 7 months not, and its still not completely popped out yet. Good luck|`|wK4kqhHkaa	im not skinny but not big either- i didn't really start to show until i was close to 6mths.  My belly button never popped out.|`|qMI6H6Lbaa	well i started showing pretty early this time but with my first child no one could tell i was pregnant til about 7 months. I am about 6 months now (25 weeks) and my lower belly is hard and i can feel it streching but my belly button has not even started to poke out yet but im sure it will in the next month or so
9cBAUMnNaa	Implantation bleeding if I remember right can happen anytime around 4-6 weeks and you can definitely get a positive test by then. You can get an accurate result the first day of your missed period. It is usually brownish like old blood and very light light the very beginning or end of a period. If it is bright red it's probably not implantation. If you think you are pregnant take a test.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	It's usually brown and only last a day or so. Just spotting. Not heavier. Most women dont' get it, btw. <br>  <br>  Test about a week after you first notice it. any sooner and it will most likely not be accurate.|`|jzAfst8Taa	Implantation bleeding is scanty and usually pink or brownish discharge...the best time to test at 9-10 days past ovulation would be advisable|`|weBOR9YCaa	I experienced what i think is implantation bleeding on 3/5. It was light pink, and wasn't flowing like a period. Some peolple say that it may be reddish brown and may be red mixed with cm. I just know that what I had was light pink, and I only saw it because it was on the tp when I wiped and b/c it was on a tampon that I inserted b/c I wanted to be sure that I saw pink on the tp.  My period shoud start on 3/14, so I plan to test on 3/10 or so. I truly hope that I am pregnant this month. Good luck to you, and lots of baby dust!!|`|EmhBDHMtaa	it's brown..like old blood and it's not much at all...mine was kinda watery...i tested 3 or 4 days after this happened b/c it started when my period was supposed to start..so i waited thinking it was my period or it was coming...so just wait until next week to test to make sure.
rEL3BfqCaa	I like Shane|`|CJvHQl5vaa	Sean is my husband's name, and Shane is my cousin's son's name, so it is hard to choose.  The thing about Sean is that it can also be spelled Shawn, which gets confusing.

Sean is more of a generation Y name- guys in their 40s or 30s.<br>  <br>  My answer- both are perfectly acceptable. Maybe Shane for a grandpas namesake or Sean for an uncle.|`|51ba26c5906c0b70cbb710f776d21a1aaa	Shane!|`|9m9gHZhpaa	Sean|`|WPI0Z47saa	Depends on the last name since they are both nice.

iX0IgOCxaa	Me and my husband used Ovusponse that we got from their site and it worked great, it took a couple of months but we are now expecting.  I would definitely recommend getting an ovulation kit.  We got ours at www.ovusponse.com and it was around 25.00 so the cost was really not that bad.  Before I bought I went to their site and they have instruction on the site that you can look at before you decide.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck and lots of baby dust to you.|`|tdNfQWaAaa	I tried them for 2 months and no luck. One month said I never ovulated, the next month said I ovulated for a week. My doctor said you can't trust those things, some women just put off to much or to low of the LH surge to get accurate results. I'm not going to waste my money again. Use the online ovulation predictors. Best of luck and lots of baby dust!!!!! xxxx|`|jgtfWjE4aa	my friend is TTC and she bought them. she spent $20 on a kit and only used ten ...so she wasted $10.<br>  <br>  honest to god, this website was awesome and it matched pretty darn close with her ovulation days.<br>  <br>  www.baby2see.com<br>  <br>  you enter the day of you LMP and they calculate the best days to TTC are.<br>  <br>  i reccommend it!|`|bKK2fPiVaa	I can't say whether they do or not.  I just bought myself ovulation test strips.  I paid $30 for 100 ovulation tests and 20 pregnancy tests on eBay.  If it works... that's great.  If not... then it was only $30 and worth a shot!<br>  Good luck!

That's pretty impressive haha.  But nah, i think that the age difference isnt really all that bad.  It may be for your parents because you're still in high school and hes not.

AA12069058	Sounds like you guys need to break the ice. Try this: ask him something random or inappropriate and see what he says. just make him laugh and let him know its ok to be open and silly. Good Luck?|`|F5S47cWUaa	well i guess it depends what kind of things you want to start talking to him about. but if it's stuff like friend issues or family issues and stuff like that, stuff that you only talk about with people you trust, i'd go for it. don't freak him out though. just ask him if he'd be willing to talk to you about something, or give you advice on something. if he doesn't want to, or is simply just no help at all, then at least you'll know where you stand, though you'll also probably be very hurt.<br>  if he takes it really well and is super keen on helping you out or just simply talking about deeper issues, then you'll know that your relationship will be able to grow much stronger over time.<br>  <br>  basically, one of you has to take the first step and just involve the other in a more deep/serious convo. so if he doesn't do it anytime soon, it's up to you. if he's worth anything he'll be stoked that you trust and value him enough as a friend to talk to him about the deeper issues in your life. he proabaly hasn't done it himself yet coz guys find it much more difficult to open up about that sort of stuff, in general anyway. i've dated guys that are total sob stories and never shut up about their problems. but he'd obviously not like that and will therefore probably be a great guy to talk to.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!!<br>  sorry it's so long!!

7c63ef82a9b12c820787a1f534edd972aa	When a 3 year old is acting that sad and clingy you need to find out why. It's not normal behavior. Comforting her is good but doesn't solve the problem. You don't mention your age, but if you are a kid yourself you need to talk to your parents or some one. Horrible to think about, but child abuse and sexual abuse can cause these types of behavior changes. Or it could be another kid or sibling scaring her, parents fighting. So many possibilities. Good luck. I hope you figure it out and it is nothing too bad|`|tOdjjeAmaa	you freakin creep. you made ANOTHER account to ask more questions about your cousins? get a LIFE you troll. or perv. either way... it must only be funny to you.|`|124a0bbcc24398b278b496723141494baa	try watching  her favorite tv shows with her buy her an ice cream cone u could take her to a playground|`|5GPDrBPLaa	Wow.  That's kind of emotional for a three year old.  Maybe you should find out the reason behind her being so sad.  I have a three year old and when he's sad it doesn't take him long to get happy again.  <br>  <br>  Maybe you can try taking her mind off the situation by going outside to play, watch a movie with popcorn, play a game, or even try putting a puzzle together.  Have you tried finding a fun website and letting her watch while you navigate?  Noggin.com is a good start.

Your hormones will be playing their part in making you feel like this so try to consider that. But the main thing you need to do is talk to someone if your husband won't then a freind or a councilor.  No body can do it all alone you are right you do need time for you and you need to get your husband to understand that he needs to make sure that you get that time.  Only you can make the changes to improve your life and I hope it works out for you.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	inform your OB and start communicating with your partner -not Yahoo.

No matter how hard it is sometimes!<br>  <br>  Try this:<br>  <br>  Look at her schedule. Is she taking long naps in the day? Maybe shorten them to give her more of a reason to sleep the whole night. <br>  An hour before bed make sure she's had a good dinner. Give her a nice relaxing bath and read a couple of stories together. Just get her to <br>  quiet down and get sleepy. Right before you put her to bed, give her a sippy cup ( they make ones that are practically bottles, so easy to transition from bottle to cup! )  of milk. Hang out with her while she drinks it. After she's done, put her to bed and leave the room. Let her cry it out for 10-15 minutes. Once you've got some practice you can tell if she's crying and falling asleep, or just plain having a fit. If she's just freaking out after 10-15 min. go back in and lay her back down. Repeat. Eventually she should wear herself out.<br>  <br>  Personally, I leave a sippy cup full of water in my daughter's crib for her in case she wakes up in the middle of the night. It works like a charm! She wakes up during the night, has a drink, and falls back to sleep.<br>  <br>  With my baby, everything has come easy so far. It was just like one day I didn't give her a binky.... and that was the end of the binkies. Same thing with sleeping in her own room and getting rid of the bottles.<br>  Like I said before, you just have to be the boss.<br>  <br>  And on a final note: you poor thing!! To not have a full night's sleep in 16 months, plus being prego with number two.|`|8wGCUSxZaa	First, do you have a consistent bedtime routing?  My daughter is 15 months old and I swear by a consistent bedtime routine.  She walks herself to her room when she knows it is bedtime.  We do the same things in the same order every night.  We keep the timing as consistent as possible as well.<br>  <br>  If you don't have a consistent routine, adopt one now.  Kids thrive on consistency.  Next, I would adopt a modified cry it out.  Give her a kiss, put her in her crib.  Tell her goodnight.  Walk out of the room.   If she begins crying, wait five minutes.  If she continues, go in her room and gently tell her that it is not time to get up, you love her, good night, and walk out.  Continue this repeatedly at up to 15 minute intervals (I could never wait longer than 10 minutes), until she goes to sleep.  Most importantly, never, ever pick her up and take her out.  You can pat her back and gently lay her back down.  I made the mistake of taking my daughter out of her crib one time.  The next night was hell.  Continue this when she wakes up at night.  If she throws her pacifier, do not give pick it up and give it to her.  Feel free to leave a sippy of water in her crib before she goes to bed.  If she throws that out, do not give it to her.  The key is for her to learn to go back to sleep on her own.  Kids wake up often throughout the night.  She needs to learn to fall asleep on her own. <br>  <br>  I started this will my daughter at 12 months and it only took two nights for her to get the hang of it and I never had to go in more than twice.  Since your daughter is older, it may take a little longer because she is much more aware that her screaming fit gets your attention.  At this age, it is definitely a learned behavior reinforced by your giving in.  <br>  <br>  Also, I would recommend putting her crib in her own room.  If she climbs out, put her back in.  If you think that it is dangerous, get her a toddler bed.  Just keep putting her back in her room in her bed if she gets out.<br>  <br>  I know it is rough.  I cried and cried the first night I let my daughter cry it out.  But, we both needed a good nights rest, and like I said, she happily walks herself to her room at bedtime now.  It is definitely worth it to stick it out.|`|UdIvVyQNaa	I have a 16 month old who is NOT a good sleeper. <br>  I do agree, tough love is a strong possibility. It is not for everyone but letting them cry it out may be a solution. <br>  I would also recommend her sleeping in her own room, she is definitely old enough. My son still sleeps in his crib and yes, he does have a pacifier. He only uses it at night but we are not ready to take that from him. <br>  I would not let her cry it out, in her own room without her pacifier....that would be too much. It's baby steps. <br>  I would go with tough love maybe in your room first. Then, her own room and lastly, if you feel strongly, remove the pacifier.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

2F5HNPqPaa	My son had 8oz every 4 hours at that age and still wanted more, so I started him on solids.  (He was also sitting up unaided and had lost tongue thrust etc).  I asked my doctor if it was too much and she said no, if a baby is hungry you just have to feed it.  It's probably not an "overfeeding"... babies are all different!<br>  <br>  Leave worrying about this baby to her mum.  Concentrate on your own.|`|Bw18seFqaa	every baby is different.  Some need more, some need a little less.  The best way to determine if your child is getting enough is by the number of wet and dirty diapers, and also the Ped will keep an eye on your baby's weight from month to month.<br>  <br>  I dont think you can really "over-feed" a baby.. if you put too much in, its going to come right back up!<br>  <br>  <br>  "If you were breastfeeding there would be no reason to worry about over feeding him"  This comment didnt really answer the question..   also the asker did not meantion if the babies were being fed formula or pumped breastmilk...  just how much the babies eat.|`|e907f296c0cad138cf4b71ab72a9a9eaaa	every baby is different. when my son was that age he drank about that much, he didn't drink a whole lot during the day, but managed to slam at least 2 bottles a night before he went to bed for the night.|`|ZxQwFUmRaa	i have a two week old and he drinks 5-6 oz. every 4 hours. if your baby wants to eat let her eat. how are u going to look at  baby and be like wait until later to get full.|`|1dueLOdvaa	As long as she isnt force feeding her baby, it's fine.|`|TvYX1yXWaa	no that sounds about right, ever baby different . my son eats about 5 to 7 ounces every 2 to 3 hours and he eats a little bit more at night time|`|AKq6IrECaa	I would not be too worried about it.

LKxpWTYeaa	Try just interacting with him.  Babies that young are usually too young to hold toys themselves but they sometimes like rattles and toys that make music or noise played near them.  Be aware of how he reacts to the noise, if you find something he likes, use that.  Be patient because he may just want to sleep and you may not have to do anything special at all.  <br>  Ask his mother to leave a shirt with you that she has worn, it will have her scent on it.  If the baby fusses too much, put the shirt over your shoulder or arm and hold the baby so he can smell the shirt.  That will almost always make a baby happy.|`|e907f296c0cad138cf4b71ab72a9a9eaaa	To be honest I wouldn't stress out about it too much, you'll do fine. All that you really need to know to do is how to change and feed the baby. Make sure that you ask how much to feed him at a time, odds are he still needs to be burped when he's being fed. The rest is pretty easy. it should all come to you naturally. good luck|`|fmgPKOaraa	if you know the basics, then the rest is up to your preference. at that age, they do sleep a lot, but if he/she fusses and you've checked the basics, then try gentle activities like lullabies, baby massage, or just talking softly to the baby...|`|FX6fDA7jaa	Try offer toys for baby and maybe sing for him . Babies enjoy music|`|SjX72fPyaa	Don't worry yourself, its really not that hard. Just make sure that you play with him and talk to him and whatnot. Its almost impossible not to do those things with a 3 month old so you shouldn't have a problem. Their so cute that you manage to come up with very inventive ways to amuse them anyways. You'll do fine :)|`|UghJ0XROaa	Just make silly faces and sounds at the baby, talk to the baby in an excited voice to play with him. Rock the baby, gently bounce him if he get fussy.
b30a67bb9890faa58afa5ef3c9a79a91aa	Nah, that doesn't necessarily mean he's gay...maybe he just knows OF her and doesn't really watch the show? Come on, don't be stereotypical - not all guys are required to watch football. <br>  <br>  As for him liking you, it's hard to tell. Maybe he was just being nice and complimenting you. But there could be some feelings stirring up in the future, so try flirting and see his reaction. Good luck~|`|z7Zb1jY2aa	My friend watches the sweet life of zack and cody, he is a guy. The kind of guy that everyone thinks is tough and many fear him. I do not think he is gay and i don't judge him because of what he watches.|`|tBtOTiQDaa	i think he likes you, when i was a teen, i watched the lamest chick flicks, for laughs, not because i actually enjoued them, but because they where hilaqriously stupid, no offense to anyone who happens to like them, but yes, i think he likkes you|`|sMbIzXbUaa	he is not gay. sometimes guys secretly watch shows society says is effeminate.
3Sr2FgRfaa	It could be an ectopic pregnancy, which is a life-threatening condition in which the baby does not implant in the uterus but rather in the fallopian tubes or some other wrong place. If you've had any STDs or infections, your chances of ectopic pregnancy go up. Ectopic pregnancies often do not show up for a long time on standard pee-stick pregnancy tests.<br>  <br>  If the cramping stays there or gets worse, you start having dizzy spells or feeling "not quite right", you need to see a doctor right away. Same with any abnormal spotting. All these can mean that the growing fetus is crowding the wrong organs and causing internal bleeding.<br>  <br>  If you have health insurance or access to a free clinic, GO TODAY to get this checked. If you catch an ectopic pregnancy early, a shot often takes care of it. If you catch it when the fetus is too big to be reabsorbed by the body, you may need surgery to remove it -- and if you wait too long, you can die.<br>  <br>  BTW, this is in no way like abortion. The fetus in an ectopic pregnancy is almost always nonviable, but it can kill you.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Spermacide does not hurt you so it's not that. Stress can cause you to skip periods. You may want to go to your doctor if you are still getting negatives and still don't have your period in another two weeks. At that point it would be unlikely to be pregnancy if you were still getting negatives.|`|BzCYQlcuaa	well i missed a period. i took a test it was negative. then i waited until i was 2 weeks late and i was still getting a negative test. so i went to the doctors and they gave me blood and it was negative! then i went back to the doctors at a month and 1 week late! and they did a pee test and i was pregnant! they did a ultra sound and i was actually 6 weeks. they were not sure why my blood test and home test came up negative! this was just my situation. my doctor said this is not a common situation but it did happen to me!
KICQQxLxaa	I really doubt the gagging and spit up is from the Alimentum.  It is hypoallergenic and generally easy to tolerate for babies with tummy problems.<br>  <br>  It could be she doesn't like the taste (it seemed to smell different then regular formula).  Or it could just be from all the other things still in her tummy.<br>  <br>  I would offer another feeding of the Alimentum, and if she keeps it up, call your doctor.  They may have you slowly introduce the Alimentum by mixing it with her other formula.<br>  <br>  ETA:  My  DD was the opposite of Damien's mom's child.  My DD couldn't handle the powder of Alimentum, and could only take the RTF.  Maybe give the powder a shot??|`|Ew2wC9piaa	my son was on the same formula and we found that he did the same thing with the RTF kind as he had been on the powder for months and we were in a pinch so we bought the RTF and he would gag and spit up as well so i would mix it half with water and half with the formula and never had a problem after that. i think the RTF is so much thicker and they do not like it that thick.<br>  <br>   edit:if you like you can e-mail me about what we went through and i will let you know i do not like to leave answers that are to long.<br>  <br>  edit: to hannahs mommy damian was on it that long too|`|cab8f3eed982d7c810bf2e8fc14f2cecaa	I really don't know if the formula is to blame. My son has been drinking alimentum since 4 months( to due weight gain loss). His dr put him on it bc its a high calorie formula. My son's dr made him a bottle of it right in the office and it was about 8 oz. He did spit it up then but thats only bc it was too big of ounced bottle for him and he was just then getting used to taking it. So I started only giving him 6 ounces ( every 2 hrs) and slowly eased him into 7 to 7 1/2 ounces( 3hrs to every 3 1/2 hrs)  that he drinks now. That formula is supposed to be Hypoallergenic. *shrugs*. Besides the blood in the poop. Did they check her for possible acid reflux? My son took both powder and RTF and never had this problem. Only spit up like most other babies do. I hope this helped!|`|AKq6IrECaa	My son is now 1. He has been on every kind of formula you can imagine, he was diagnosed with acid reflux, obviously for babies, and we switched his formula to nutramigen, works AMAZING. My friend also has a son who had blood in his poop, and his ped switched him to the same thing. If she is spitting up, you might just want to get used to it, I was so worried about it, and he has finally grown out of it.. Or i even used to put a little bit of rice or oatmeal in his bottle just to help thicken his formula..|`|ZXDKEe5laa	Could be reflux
bf8lx9gxaa	You sure can still be pregnant. Most of the time you don't get symptoms until you're like a month pregnant. Some women don't experience symptoms at all. And if you had a faint positive, that's still a positive girlie. I'm very excited for you, I hope you're pregnant. I wish the very best of luck to you sweetie. Let me know how it goes. If you have anymore questions or concerns, you can e-mail me any time.?|`|kaqPSgTVaa	I got pregnancy symptoms a week after conception but not everyone gets symptoms that early. Actually some people dont' get ANY so it's very possible that you are pregnant.|`|AA10893102	You're pregnant...I didn't start having symptoms until the sixth week. A faint positive is still a positive.|`|oqUlYXqtaa	yes, you could def. be pregnant good luck! and the blood test will give you a clear answer.<br>  you can also ask doctors online for free and find others going through similar situations, try fertilityties.com<br>  good luck!|`|EwK9iZj6aa	You are Preggo!

Good Luck : )|`|jzAfst8Taa	yes you can still be try taking a first response first thing tomorrow morning ....good luck and keep us posted its harder to get a false positive than a false negative|`|txv7TIgiaa	usually you wont get pregnancy symptoms right away...i found out i had to pee alot and i thought i had a bladder infection so i went to the doctor and i was 3 weeks pregnant...but morning sickness cane about a month later... so some people get symptoms right away and then others have none for a while...if you are pregnant and you have no symptoms than i say you are lucky....|`|EmhBDHMtaa	it's very possible...GOOD LUCK!!!!
a1731418e68343f01ae82b7c12846cf2aa	You may not drink straight water, but the fluids you are drinking has water in them.  Apparently, they're doing a sufficient job hydrating you.<br>  <br>  It would be healthier to incorporate water into your diet due to the additional calories you're drinking, but baby would not necessarily be endangered.<br>  <br>  EDIT - For all my thumbs down fairies that mistakenly think they have a clue, <br>  "Eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day. Another approach to water intake is the "8 x 8 rule" — drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day (about 1.9 liters). The rule could also be stated, "drink eight 8-ounce glasses of fluid a day," as all fluids count toward the daily total. Though the approach isn't supported by scientific evidence, many people use this basic rule as a guideline for how much water and other fluids to drink. "<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/water/NU00283" rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/water/N...</a>|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You are supposed to drink water pregnant or not. If you don't like water try getting flavored water. You NEED to get plenty of fluids.|`|8d5f0adc83a9aec3f83894da97ca8d80aa	How do you stay hydrated? I agree, try things like Crystalight, or Propel, or those Vitamin Waters (these I find in the organic section of the grocery store) or the sobe life water... shoot, I'd say even kool aid or iced tea is better than not drinking anything.|`|pIBOSkfsaa	Just start drinking it, always keep a bottle on you, trust me it takes a while but soon you adjust and really develope a liking for it, I would advise against one of the responses in here about drinking crystal light instead, the aspartame in it is not good for you, i've heard you can actually get aspartame poisoning from drinking too much diet drinks that use the chemical sweetener. Plain old water is good for you and baby because it will always be flushing out impurities from your body that you both don't need.|`|2DahzSWvaa	You should try flavored water. (Crystal light is a good one) That may help you get your water intake in.<br>  <br>  They say you need 8 glasses a day, plus it helps with constipation.|`|4ksa4lhWaa	Drink Propal Fitness Water its very good.  DRINK DRINK DRINK I WENT IN AT 37 WEEKS PRE TERM LABOR I WAS DEHYDRATED. Its not good for baby|`|ZXDKEe5laa	You need to drink water and ill tell ya why I went on vacation and I was pregnant with my third child it was summer and I didnt wanna drink alot of water at the amusement park cuz I didnt wanna have to keep running to the bathroom I was 6 months preggo well I ended up in the hosptial when we got home from are vacation because of low fluid levels they had to hook me up to an IV to give me fluids and give me a steriod shoot in my butt which hurt like crap just in case they had to take my baby earlier if my fluid levels stayed low they went up and I got to go home but if I would of drank water I wouldnt of had to go threw all that worry so drink the water|`|kGfd8DWWaa	I would say start drinking any and all types of decaffeinated drinks. it will be the same as water, or Gatorade. it will help you stay hydrated. If you are dehydrated than you could have problems with the pregnancy, make sure your pee is always clear and never yellow or brown. than you have to go to the hospital if it is brown, means your dehydrated.|`|2ObqoJbKaa	You'll just have to try to force yourself to drink water, for the babies sake. Im sure you can do that, and if worse comes to worse, go to the doctor and have them give you an IV.|`|e907f296c0cad138cf4b71ab72a9a9eaaa	sorry but you'll have to find a way to get those fluids in you. try the flavored water, try it ice cold, try just eating plain ice, try drinking water that is room temperature or even warm. whatever works|`|3hIr3Dllaa	Drink it now and suck it up and stop complaining.  You'll do a lot of things you don't want to or don't like over the course of your child's life because it's the right thing for them.|`|qSHlehJzaa	just put flavored drinks in water, and also stop thinking about yourself and start thinking about the life that is inside you|`|FX6fDA7jaa	you can mix water with juice , it will make favor different . You should drink water now because weather become hot .|`|Ks7lENScaa	Yeah you have to drink water.  Try adding some lemon or some kind of other flavor to it.|`|bb7b4M9Xaa	I know drinking water can be boring and maybe not so pleasant but it is vital to your babies heath and growth! When i was pregnant i drank at least 3 liters of water a day. Perhaps you can add a little cordial, but in saying that you should drink extra if your going to add cordial because it dehydrates you. Good luck, congratulations on the little one, keep those fluids up and take care!|`|AKq6IrECaa	You could always buy the little packets of crystal light, and put them in your bottle of water, or even before bed, drink some night time tea, it tastes pretty good, and relaxes you before you get to bed. I know being pregnant, its sometimes hard to sleep. I also found the special k water is really great tasting.|`|HV5aRF9Maa	I absolutely HATE drinking water and the doctors kept telling me to drink water while I was pregnant.  I didn't I ended up in the hospital in labor and had my daughter 2 1/2 months early.  That is something no parent wants to go through, I came home from the hospital but my baby had to stay in the NICU and seeing your 4lb baby hooked up to all the machines and laboring to take each breath..........|`|F7i4heAcaa	Ok so I hated drinking water too. I might have drank maybe four to five bottles of water a week when I was pregnant. My favorite thing to drink was tea and yes it was decaf. But anyway the nutritionist basically told me that this was fine as long as I was getting some sort of fluid in my system.|`|hQ8uCFqEaa	I never was a thirsty person.... id drink maybe one drink a day... til i got pregnant! I wanted to do everything I had to keep the baby healthy...even if it meant making myself do it! I drank 8 bottles of water a day... water is very important....from beginning to end! If you dont drink plenty water, you could cause complications.|`|ob9oJpKbaa	Of course you should be drinking water, whether you are pregnant or not. Start asap and don't stop for the rest of your life! You should be drinking 1-3 litres per day. <br>  <br>  What can you do to drink water? Fill the glass & put it to your lips, then swallow. Not rocket science!|`|lwUHC13vaa	you need to start drinking water now! its not healthy for you of the baby! you need to drink up to 8 cups of water a day! go start now! its because when your pregnant you get certain cravings or things that you don't like! but you really need to drink water!|`|VZhhJ648aa	you should get those powder packets that you mix with nothing but water. The lemonade and the cranberry and the rasberry iced tea. All you do if jump the powder in a bottleof water and shake. They taste good and you wont know your drinking the water.|`|Sg3lc8YWaa	You should drink water everyday, wether if you are pregnant or not.|`|r6bSSVKbaa	stop being selfish and just drink the water!! who cares if you don't like it..its for the good of your baby!|`|JhIckFOXaa	start drinking water right now!!

UghJ0XROaa	He might have just wanted to be noticed, not necessarily the comfort! My oldest one wanted a quick hug and then she wanted down, no snuggling for very long. My little one, lol, is a drama queen, if she bumps her head or gets "beat up" by sissy she is a 15 minute "hold me and don't let go"|`|FLEXqVoiaa	My son has never cried too much when he takes a fall-He's a tough little guy lol. He acted the same way as your son if he cried after a tumble-He would want me to put him down right away so he could continue to explore whatever it was that hurt him in the first place lol. <br>  <br>  My little girl will sometimes cry when she falls on her butt, even if it's obvious she didn't get hurt. She'll make a big fuss until mommy or daddy picks her up and gives her a kiss.|`|VXhOLgDEaa	Well...my baby is weird...she's 10mths old. When my daughter bumps her head...she'll just stop and stare at me for a second and when I react like "awwwww are you okayyy...!!" and kind of freak...then she'll cry..the cry that sounds so sadd....but then....when she bumps her head..and she looks at me and I smile and say it's okay....she doesn't cry. hahah it's weird...if I ignore it...she won't cry...if I react she'll cry like it hurt like crazy!....lol..|`|ZXDKEe5laa	My daughter is 16 months old and bumps her head or falls down all the time I run to comfort her and pick her up she does the same thing she will cry and push on me I just think its because they are sooo upset and dont understand why it hurts when they fall bump there head etc.|`|8lcNupM2aa	Mine just turned 11 months and for the past couple months it's been like that. If he falls or gets hurt in any way he gets sort of annoyed if I try to snuggle him.. but its not just when he gets hurt its turning into all the time.. He just wants to walk, run and do his own thing. Only time he'll let me snuggle is if I tickle him or he's really really sleepy. Hehe.|`|USrhxMW9aa	My son always wants to be picked up and snuggled with if he bumps himself on the head.  But, every child is different some just aren't the snuggling type.  He probably just wants to know you are there if he needs you but not necessarily for you to make it all better :)|`|n6XYYyoLaa	she wants a quick cuddle and she's off again...she's nine mos|`|8d5f0adc83a9aec3f83894da97ca8d80aa	My youngest has always been that way, he doesn't want to be touched when he's hurt himself like that.

You do need basic, easy-to-match tones like black, brown, gray, and white -- but personality and trendiness calls for colors like red, pink, yellow, blue, green, purple, and orange.<br>  <br>  For the summer, the most basic staples are shorts, skirts, tanks, sandals, accessories. My favorite store is American Eagle and they have all that kind of stuff. They have really nice shirts and jeans there so be sure to check that out.<br>  <br>  Stores like Wet Seal, Delia's, Forever 21 and Charlotte Russe have a great collection of colorful, outspoken clothes. They are all pretty cheap. If you're into bold clothing, you should definitely check out their tees.<br>  <br>  For accessories, I really like H&M. I got a great belt there that I wear everyday now but they also have earrings, bracelets, rings, necklaces, the works. <br>  <br>  Here, I'm going to post some of my favorite stores, the best option is to go inside a couple of them to pick out the stuff YOU like.<br>  <br>  -American Eagle<br>  -Victoria Secret<br>  -Kohl's<br>  -Forever 21<br>  -Delia's<br>  <br>  Also, be sure to check out <a href="http://www.polyvore.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.polyvore.com/</a><br>  Type a key word like your favorite store or color into the search engine, and look at the outfits you like.

ff84fb7643d1504a53a38364bd63cc08aa	Keep it calm at that time of night. If its a repeat thing, every once in a while its good to have a surprise with you. If you know another family with small children that would let you borrow children's books from them, bring a special new story to read to her. Ask her parents if they are OK with her watching TV or movies before bed, and maybe make it a weekend treat to watch a new kid's movie that she's never seen or to let her pick out the movie.<br>  Bring craft supplies, but make sure its appropriate for her age and easy to clean up. A new coloring book is always fun, if you're willing to go find one at the local dollar store or have an old one sitting around.<br>  Make it fun. Have a pajama party. Hang a sheet off the back of the couch, pull out the end, and weigh it down with some bins or something to make a tent where you can have special story time before bed or watch a movie from inside the tent. Be careful of hanging a sheet between 2 chairs. If you try this, put the backs of the chairs toward the outside of the "tent" in the middle of the room. That way, if they fall backward, no one will get hurt.<br>  Just a few ideas. Talk to the parents before they leave, ask them to give you a tour of the house so you know where everything is, ask them about the normal bedtime routine, and if there is anything that they don't want the child to do or have. If you bring a book or movie or toy, show it to them first, before showing it to the child. They see you are prepared and have the opportunity to object if there's something about the thing you brought that they don't like. Don't be disheartened if they object, just put it away and let the child pick a different story or toy or movie. <br>  Be attentive, keep an eye on her, but relax. <br>  Oh, and if you want to be asked back, don't leave the house a mess when the parents get home. Have the little girl help you clean up; make it a game. I've even gotten a little extra cash for doing the dishes after putting the kids to bed.|`|m2cxGTwgaa	just be friendly. bring some toys, and have fun. ive been babysitting for 4 years, im 16 and its great.|`|EtTddxAqaa	well, she is 3 and you are babysitting from 8-2.<br>  I would say you dont even have to worry about it, she should be sleeping by 8:30 or 9 so you will only have like an hour to be with her. (:<br>  bring some toys or games that you would want to play, be nice and enjoy your time with the little one, be patient and friendly and I am sure they have toys and games so no need to bring any actually. (:<br>  good luck, awesome answer btw! (:|`|PHOyKsmPaa	Be involved with her activities. Build blocks with her, dance to songs on t.v.,Get out paper and crayons and draw together. Go outside on a walk/ stroller, Let her "help you make lunch" Get bread out, put the cheese on it..bring the cups,  make a little soccer field in the house and roll to ball to score. Read her favorite books and ask her to point to the characters, that keeps her involved. "where is the dog?"  Have her "help clean" between activities. <br>  Have fun. The more you do with her the smoother the day will go and the faster too!|`|LqulvCsoaa	You shouldn't need to worry about anything! WHY? Because three year old girls should be asleep by 7:30! If your starting by  8:00 than that girls behind should alrdy be asleep. If she wakes up during the night get her some warm milk and tell her a story that will knock out^^|`|lN0GkKgaaa	Well since you are starting at 8pm.. which is kinda late, I wouldn't get her wild up in games. Maybe read some stories, or tell stories, maybe a nice and quiet play time with a few of her toys.|`|gP0gYbBaaa	play games with her. she will be sleeping most of that time so u can like go on ur phone or something...lol<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  peacee&+lovee<br>  Kelsey
LMRaSXFeaa	your not fat!|`|kRaVa0Wraa	youre not fat unless you need to go to a plus-size store, lol.<br>  and no youre not :)|`|CRvdmFwCaa	YOU ARE PERFECT for you height.  Nothing wrong with having curves and not being a stick figure (which I'm sure at 14, a lot of your friends are??)  You have the figure of a woman... not a little girl.  And that is awesome!  Power to the curves!  <br>  <br>  I have battled with my size ( I have been size 7 or 9 in Juniors since 7th grade... depending on the day) since middle school.  I just matured a lot faster then my friends... i got my period at 10 boobs at 11.  Now That I'm 20... I am so confident in myself... I'd never EVER call myself fat... I'm within a healthy weight range for my height and bone structure. You are perfectly fine, at a perfect size... BE CONFIDENT and feel good about you.|`|Q08GpskDaa	Don't. Thats what I am, and I don't consider myself fat. And keep in mind, its winter. Almost everyone gains a little weight. But we are like the exact same size and height. You just need to find clothes you feel comfortable in, and look good on you, and then who cares what the number on the tag is!|`|Bw18seFqaa	no you are not fat...<br>  <br>  size 7 in normal jeans?  Lordy girl.. go eat a cheezburger!|`|EfaQpsd5aa	no your not fat..|`|92cb7e14719f8e1de73093976b6641ffaa	noo<br>  you're not fat.

You're body is still changing. =)|`|b30a67bb9890faa58afa5ef3c9a79a91aa	Nah, you're not fat. You probably just have wider hips, and besides, you're tall.

5rrK4o5raa	number one your gorgous and im sure your not fat.<br>  every girl is like that i swear im fat im a size 2. and im never happy with my pictures either .. look at my display one my arms are HUGE! but just tell yourself everyday that your beautiful and you will believe it.<br>  <br>  if others think your ugly ef em .. ive had so many people say im ugly buts always been because there jealous of me .. i think thats why im so confident is because i have so many haters. just believe in yourself and have a great personality and you cant go wrong.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT : tell yourself NOW im not fat im gorgous! DO IT GIRLFRIEND ?<br>  <br>  EDIT: thankss :) take now for example im getting a whole cake like my fat *** needs it. but you just gotta love you for you. remember if you have true friends thats all that matters.|`|kRaVa0Wraa	get more confidence? youre pretty. you posted pictures online (yahoo! 360). im pretty sure you dont think youre that ugly.<br>  <br>  edit: oh okay.<br>  well still. <br>  youre probably just not photogenic.<br>  i look bad in most photos too.|`|A3zAXntxaa	Oh my god, I'm just like you. I hate everything about me, even when other people tell me I'm pretty I know they're lying. But, you should just write down a bunch of good things about yourself and tape them somewhere you'll look a lot, and read them when you feel ugly or fat. I've heard it helps a lot, but I haven't done it yet. I hope I helped.<br>  <br>  (I probably didn't)<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  (P.S, from what I can see. You're really pretty and I like your hair a lot. So, you shouldn't really have to feel like that.)|`|Wtyk7086aa	oh my god girl :) you are so not ugly.<br>  society makes people think that if they think they are pretty its a bad thing. at the few minutes i see myself and smile i feel bad about it, and then i cloud over and see only the worst parts of myself.<br>  you can't let that happen.<br>  the only reason people seem perfect these days is either because of plastic surgery or they aren't real. No one is perfect.<br>  & you aren't fat.<br>  you can't think these things. i thought these things i've been there. thats why im in so much crap, thats almost impossible to reverse now.<br>  look in that mirror again, and tell yourself that you are beautiful.<br>  Because you are.<br>  And you might not know it now, but you will.<br>  You don't need people to tell you that you are beautiful.<br>  One day you'll just wake up and know.|`|Vv7a31pmaa	Grow up.<br>  <br>  If you don't, you will be a fool the rest of your live.|`|Z7dShLRLaa	Hey atleast your not ugly like meeeee|`|4fOTisCEaa	No, society just gives you the wrong values x\ Being a teenager just sucks nowadays; very few people have a decent amount of self-esteem.<br>  <br>  What most people think is fat would actually be considered healthy. One of my friends who is one of the best distance runners in my grade thinks she's fat; another friend who is on drill team and wins a lot of rollerblading competitions also thinks she herself is fat.<br>  <br>  You seem like such a nice person, and shouldn't that be what really matters?|`|WY98tbNIaa	Don't listen to James he's an a*s<br>  <br>  a lot of girls have low self esteem and from your picture you don't look fat.. at all. You should probably just get some higher confidence<br>  <br>  Get a straightner<br>  Try different hairstyles<br>  just ya know? haha good stuff<br>  <br>  also maybe join cheerleading or something, that's really fun (I was a cheerleader before I got preggers) and you get fit and have some cute outfits ;)|`|CsIwiZRoaa	i always have the same thoughts omg. i ****** hate mirrors! its so annoying i dont liek going out sometimes cuz i know i dont look good. im pretty i just feeeel so fat and then when i do get skinnier people tell me and i just get fat again because i dont worry about eating when im skinnyi dont wanna sound like a brat but being a teenager sucks :(|`|abELhjcoaa	thats a very unhealthy view of yourself, confidence and how you carry yourself is always noticed over the way you look, and no you are not fat<br>  <br>  wear clothes that highlight your best features and bring out the best of what you have to offer|`|UtCkgs18aa	I feel the same way. I always have those thoughts. I look at myself in the mirror everyday and those thoughts run through my head. I'm the same age as you. I'm tired of it too, but I don't know what to do. Sorry I couldn't help you.|`|EWFtQNSdaa	Your gorgeous!
nZVmkZSBaa	Finish high school, go to a good university, and study alternative medicine, law, or visual arts. Those are my goals -- but you never know what will actually happen. I'm not sure exactly what I want to be.<br>  <br>  If you ask a child what they they want to be, most will say a doctor or a lawyer, as that is what their parents have drilled into their brains. However, when you look at the general population, how many people are actually doctors and lawyers? Definately not as many as the ones who say they will... <br>  <br>  I find it pretty pointless to decide exactly what you want to be before even finishing high school. I'm not saying not to plan ahead, just stay open minded. I know I'll make something of myself, just not sure exactly what yet. xD<br>  <br>  I don't want to be a lawyer. It doesn't help the community to defend people you KNOW are guilty. You're just letting more criminals stand free in this world, making us all suffer. My mom is a lawyer, and personally, I hate it. I doubt I would be a doctor, just because I get too attached to people, and would carry people's problems out of the working facility.<br>  <br>  I love writing and drawing.. And photography. But IMO, those are merely hobbies. I want to be something that makes a difference in society, forget the money. I would enjoy speaking to teens about the importance of NOT doing drugs, drinking, and having sex at a young age. I did those things, and I'm going to be a teen mom. My daughter wasn't a mistake, but I hope others can learn from the hardships that I have to go through each day. <br>  <br>  I love animals, but being a Veterinarian means uthenization, which I just couldn't do. I would love to do something for teens with problems, and troubles. If I could help one person, that's one more life I possibly saved. <br>  <br>  I will do something with my life. Each person chooses what they want to be. It isn't a given. If we didn't choose our own future, we wouldn't have a brain to make our own decisions. <br>  <br>  I want my daughter to be able to look at me, and see that even though I was a teen mom, that is not always indicative of a failure, stupidity, or one who will be on welfare or foodstamps for the rest of their lives. I want to be something that my daughter can be proud of, because as of the day she was concieved, she is all I live for. She has done so much for me, it is the LEAST I could do in return. <br>  <br>  Sorry for the essay. Aha. xD|`|9OdrWhRRaa	I would like to finish high school first.

3rda58OCaa	He is fine, it's prune juice.  He won't dehydrate that quickly.  He will probably be back to normal tomorrow.  Signs of dehydration:<br>  <br>  ~dry mouth and lips<br>  ~no tears when crying<br>  ~no pee pee in 6 or more hours<br>  <br>  Give him some water in the morning, and keep him well changed and clean.  He will be just fine.|`|AFi5kTiEaa	Oooh boy!!!  Just make sure he is getting plenty of fluids and eating.  It should pass by tomarrow.  If he is dehydrated he wont have any wet diapers( I know...it will be hard to tell with the poopy) and if he cries he wont have tears.  I dont think he will get dehydrated.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	The prune juice wont hurt him as long as he is getting plenty to drink to replace what he is losing. I would get some pedialite (sp) just to make sure he is getting everything back that he is losing also give the baby some reg. crackers I know this sounds kinda nasty but it will help soak it up lol. Good luck
mx3gFmIKaa	As a minor his visitor list will only be who his guardians/parents list.  He will give a code word actually his parents will to protect his privacy so he will need to contact you.  There is nothing for him to be scared of, everyone there is just regular people like him.  He will be expected to go to groups, meet with the doctor, cooperate with the staff and tell them how he feels, meet with a social worker, and have a family session.  Most likely medications will be started.<br>  <br>  Many things are considered contraband.  He will not be able to have belts, laces, ties, hoodies with string, pencils with metal on the eraser, pens, offensive, illegal, or antisocial clothing, no shirts with 420 written on them, or Joe Camel, Jack Daniels ect.  All his belongings will be checked in and gone through.  Additionally 2 staff will do a body search, this does not include a cavity search, 2 staff will take him into a small room and inspect him for bruises.  A sheet will be drawn up.   His privates will remain behind the sheet, he will be asked to squat and cough.  He will have to hand each article of clothing to the staff for inspection.  Its really not degrading or invasive at all.  Visiting probably not, but he should be able to call you.  Also while he is there staff will look in on him every 15 minutes minimum, no shaving so tell him to get a clean shave before he goes.  The patients doors don't have locks on them, and swing open both ways, the units are locked but it doesn't feel claustrophobic.  He will be able to go to the cafeteria and to the outside courtyards with staff.|`|LMRaSXFeaa	the only thing you can do for him is to help him get better,<br>  yes you should be able to visit him.|`|kRaVa0Wraa	the circumstances could be different<br>  but last year my friend was admitted to the hospital because she attempted suicide.<br>  she was only allowed to call 3 of her friends. i havent seen her since then. we werent allowed to visit and now she goes to a boarding school in canada or something.<br>  :(<br>  <br>  so probably not. but i honestly dont know. you should ask him.|`|GUuFKaaiaa	thank God that the psychiatrist admitted him before anything dangerous happened. hopefully he can get help. the best thing you can do for him as a friend is just to be there for him i think<br>  bring him games so he doesn't get bored in the hospital and talk to him|`|H0sPCJQPaa	Bring him things that remind him of home.<br>  There should be visiting hours.<br>  Tell him not to be worried, these people are there to help you.<br>  It's a good thing hes getting help.<br>  <br>  Tell him I say good luck<br>  <br>  :)?|`|8dpZpH0Saa	Aww, good for you, for being there.

It's common, and sounds great with Kate. I can easily imagine a Kate Wilson.<br>  <br>  Richards -- Not quite as good as Kate Wilson. I think Richards is nice, but Wilson flows better.<br>  <br>  Johnson -- Johnson is too, too. It's predictable and expected, which is fine for a story, but I still love the flow of Kate Wilson. <br>  <br>  My answer -- Wilson!<br>  <br>  <br>  Married name for Kate:<br>  Hansen -- I like Kate Hansen. Hansen is the last name of my Biology teacher and my Math teacher (her husband). I really am a fan of both of the classes, so I think the last name is pretty approachable and great. <br>  <br>  Perry -- Please no. Everyone will think of Katy Perry. The one that sings "I kissed a girl"? Yeah, it's just not right... Not a good name... Please, not this one. <br>  <br>  Carson -- This one's fine, implying that you can't choose how well your last names flow, but Kate Carson does sound rather icky. I do like it though.<br>  <br>  Anderson -- I like this one also. It's fine, but I'm becoming slightly partial to Carson. Though it doesn't flow well with Kate at all, I think it suggests the brilliancy of saying that love is worth it. <br>  <br>  My answer: Kate Carson. But I also love Kate Hansen.<br>  <br>  <br>  Kate's Husband's name:<br>  Rich -- This would be funny if her maiden name turned out to be Richards... It would be nice also if this wasn't her middle name. It could remind you of the possibilities that you considered. Rich and Kate.<br>  <br>  Seth -- I like Seth, but it's always seemed a bit young to me for some reason. Seth and Kate...eh<br>  <br>  Brett -- Brett is another name that I can only picture as "young". Brett doesn't seem quite ready for marriage... Brett and Kate...not really my favorite.<br>  <br>  Bryce -- Oh, I would laugh. Brice Hansen is the name of my Teachers' daughter. Bryce is another one that seems rather young and not quite ready for marriage. Plus, I can't help but associate it with the daughter. Their other daughter's name is Owen...strange, yes. Bryce and Kate....eh<br>  <br>  Nathan -- I love Nathan. It's my brother's name. He's 20, so I suppose he's getting closer to being ready for marriage. It seems more mature than some of the other names. Nathan and Kate.<br>  <br>  Keith -- Yes, I like Keith. Keith is my neighbor's name. He's married (to a Candace, which is slightly close to Kate). They're expecting a daughter May 9th. Her name will be Tessa Dawn. They already have one daughter named Aislin (AYZ-lin) Paige. :) Yes, I like Keith and Kate. <br>  <br>  My answer: Keith and Kate. I like it. Keith Carson is nice. Nathan Carson is okay also, though.<br>  <br>  <br>  Kate's Best Friend:<br>  Olivia -- Again, it seems rather young. If Kate is married, I really don't expect her to have a friend names Olivia. <br>  <br>  Avery -- Avery is, again, pretty new...pretty popular. I can only picture "baby Avery's" at the moment. <br>  <br>  Tarynn -- Again...seems rather new. Seems rather young. Seems like Kate has a little fan following her around, rather than a best friend. <br>  <br>  Reagan -- Reagan is okay. I know some young Reagan's, but I also know a couple of high school Reagan's. That's getting closer, but still quite young. <br>  <br>  Carly -- Carly is nice. It's slightly less stereotypically young. I prefer it much more than some of the others. <br>  <br>  Autumn -- It's okay. It's easily imagined as young or old to me... And would fit, I think. But I think I prefer Carly...<br>  <br>  My answer: Carly<br>  <br>  <br>  Kate's Parents:<br>  Will & Shawna -- I have to say no to this one. The maiden name that I picked was Wilson, and I really think Will Wilson is a bit much...<br>  <br>  Henry & Sheryl -- I love this one. Henry is brilliant, as is Sheryl. They're very easily pictured as parents. Henry Wilson and Sheryl Wilson...yes, I like it.<br>  <br>  Gerard & Marianne -- This one is okay. I do like Gerard... But I prefer Sheryl over Marianne. <br>  <br>  My answer: Henry and Sheryl. Though Gerard and Sheryl would also be okay.<br>  <br>  <br>  Kate's Husband's Parents:<br>  Rob & Jillian -- Rob and Jillian Carson... not bad. I do love Jillian, but I can't picture it as a potential grandmother. It's "old" but doesn't seem "ancient" to me. <br>  <br>  Tim & Martha -- Yes, this one is amazing. Tim and Martha Carson. I love it. <br>  <br>  Jim & Joyce -- This one is okay. It's nice, but I do prefer Tim and Martha. <br>  <br>  My answer: Tim and Martha. They're so perfectly aged for the job. Brilliant. <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope this helped!<br>  -- Amy|`|OYouFVbHaa	Maiden name for Kate:<br>  Johnson<br>  <br>  Married name for Kate:<br>  Carson<br>  <br>  <br>  Kate's Husband's name:<br>  Nathan<br>  <br>  <br>  Kate's Best Friend:<br>  Olivia<br>  <br>  Kate's Parents:<br>  Henry & Sheryl<br>  <br>  Kate's Husband's Parents:<br>  Rob & Jillian<br>  <br>  That is what i think hahha idk tho just an idea|`|y0e5hG0Saa	Kate Richards<br>  Kate Carson<br>  Bryce Carson<br>  Avery<br>  Henry & Sheryl<br>  Rob & Jillian|`|9tcTtw6Vaa	Kate Richards<br>  Kate Perry<br>  Nathan Perry<br>  Avery <br>  Henry and Cheryl Richards<br>  Tim and Martha Perry|`|LTAZLZH7aa	I write as well and these are my suggestions<br>  Maiden name- Richards<br>  Married- Anderson<br>  Husband- Seth<br>  Friend- Autumn<br>  Kate's parents - Henry and Sheryl<br>  Seth's Parents- Jim and Joyce|`|J4kSN7YVaa	Richards<br>  <br>  Hansen<br>  <br>  Seth<br>  <br>  Avery<br>  <br>  Henry and Sheryl<br>  <br>  Tim and Martha|`|pl7lWGZDaa	Johnson<br>  Anderson<br>  Brett<br>  Henry and Sheryl<br>  Jim and Joyce|`|AvAPSfI0aa	Johnson<br>  <br>  Hansen<br>  <br>  Brett<br>  <br>  Carly<br>  <br>  Will & Shawna<br>  <br>  <br>  Tim & Martha|`|Hm4kzzsaaa	richards<br>  carson<br>  seth<br>  carly<br>  will & shawna<br>  tim & martha
qGfAlDd2aa	According to Quicken, we are averaging $363.77 for a family of 4 (two adults, two teens).|`|kvGDCV2gaa	We have 4 people in our house. My mom, dad, sister (11), and me (14). A week we spend anywhere between $150-230, so about $200 a week. Multiply that by 4 and you get $800. Holy crap!  I never thought about that. We have a lot of parties that we host, though. And I agree, organic and whole foods cost more[which is almost all we buy], but they're MUCH healthy for you!|`|IU4uNH97aa	well for me I have to buy food for 2 adults and 4 kids in the house with another baby on the way. I spend around $ 100 - 200 on food a week but thats because we will eat out once a week but all the others days the kids and I eat organic foods. So on average about $ 450 to 600 a month people think it's alot but its what works for our family.|`|EtTddxAqaa	I have 4 kids, I usually spend around $300 and a lot of families would say that is a lot but it really isn't for us, My kids can only eat organic foods and drink organic as well, that costs more too. we are vegiterean so we get the expensive tofu and everything, for the kids not me, I think it is nasty, I prefer my greens haha! <br>  awesome question. (:|`|XOtOMncwaa	It's just me and my son here. His father comes home once a month, when his father is coming home I spend about $150 that week, and every other week I spend about $50, with me and a 13 month old food tends to last a while around here!|`|1Du4Rudvaa	We try to keep it under $300 a month, sometimes it is under $200, but that is in the cold months when we have a lot of soup.  There are three people that live in my house.|`|81f3hYAyaa	I would love to know where everyone lives. We live in Vancouver, BC and spend $800-$1000 on monthly groceries!  It's just my husband, 11 month old and 15 year old (two - three times a week).<br>  <br>  Where do you people shop?  I'm all for saving money.|`|7f40a0efee482e94e2baa04fac426e33aa	i spend any where from 400 to 500. i have 3 little mouths to feed. <br>  <br>  We buy fruits and veggies, meats, breads,cheese,milk.And snack foods like yogurt,raisins,cereals,pretzels pop corn.Juice,canned soups, stuff like that.|`|yQDxgLBPaa	There are 4 adults in our house and on a month usually about the same as you! We buy more food that you can cook,meat,noodles,veggies. Instead of frozen food you just throw in the oven or microwave that type of food is to expensive!|`|delMvf8iaa	My food bill run about the same I liked the advice the other person gave on soup.and not buying frozen food .I do the same thing.Have a neighborhood potluck supper that would save money for everyone.|`|ZQsO1T4oaa	we spend around $200-$250 a month on food. there are 2 adults and a 2 year old who eats like a grown man lol.
irHF6CBPaa	Well I don't know much but a good side affect may be that it does make you produce more milk( if you pump ) or if you have the baby already than obviously feed him or her if the baby is eating less than every 2 hrs I suggest pumping every 2 untill you get a good amount of milk supply the bad is that some babies can taste it in the milk and some women may experience dizziness Good Luck|`|kGfd8DWWaa	Congratulations on all fronts and you might want to pump to keep the milk coming or just keep breast feeding and take pregnancy vitamins. they actually keep you healthy while you breast feed.
RFCcWPliaa	Xavier.<br>  Gabriel would be a good name, though. Gabe for short.|`|86oPkfzOaa	Tyler, definitely!|`|czHD5tPwaa	Tyler definatly!

He's only not sarcastic, and caucasion.|`|IlPsFSUHaa	im sorry but neither. xavier is a problem child and tyler is... um... :P ugh i would go with Riley or Zyan or Ash or if you like names that start with x then xan coud work?|`|NePgB9b2aa	Xavier! <3<br>  <br>  Tyler is so trendy and overused.|`|8wVj8odOaa	Xavier|`|AA11831080	Xavier|`|kQUSPstlaa	Tyler|`|iKLdGe1xaa	Tyler!!

sYsfI856aa	Get them done, but have them done much shorter than you normally would. You'll still get the "elegant" feel of having them, without as much of the worry!|`|iwtetdBoaa	i want to get mine done also,  but im also scared to , i think im going to wait till my kids or older - plus dont have time to go and sit and get them done with a 13 month old & a new born  and a 4 yr old,<br>  <br>  but i do buy the ones from like cvs or walmart  wear a few days maybe a week then ill pop then off,  plus i dont really like wearing them much so it works for me to have them when i want them off & on|`|syVPYmXWaa	it will be a little hard when the baby is first born, so why dont you just ask them to paint the french on your nails? it will still look very nice and then you dont have to worry about hurting your babies.|`|eXPBp6vZaa	YES u deserve it 9 months with a baby yes more power to u!!!|`|56b2f958b01573ec0d3749a16e27365aaa	I would be more worried about the fumes in the salon than the nails themselves as far as the baby goes.  They really are very blunt.  However, if you end up 'clamping down' on something during labor, they might pop off and that would hurt you!|`|p2Njf5gBaa	Honestly, I wouldn't.  Perhaps go in a for a nice pedi instead,  surely your feet would love some pampering after two pregnancies in a row.  <br>  <br>  Its hard to do things with fake nails and tiny babies.  Don't forget how small they are,  and how tedious it can be to put their diaper one, wipe their eye, clip there nails, suction there nose and mouth if needed.  You don't want to get them done only to find out it too hard to tend to the babe.  <br>  Perhaps if you go in for a pedi,  have them just paint your nails for you in a nice color.|`|XOtOMncwaa	I used to always get my nails done, and before my son was born I took them off... but anytime I have ever had them done they haven't been sharp, and I couldn't imagine them scratching my son.<br>  BUT I remember one time I took my son to the doctor, the nurse took him to weigh him, and when she brought him back he had a huge scratch going all the way from his chest to his waist, I asked her what happened, she explained that she was very sorry but she scratched my son with her fake nail... so ever since then I decided I wasn't going to have mine done anymore... <br>  I guess if you were really careful with them then it would be okay...
HtyUrjrFaa	Fake nails fix the problem. <br>  <br>  I used to bite my nails all the time and fake nails will correct the problem. You'll tap your nails and all of that type of stuff instead of but you won't bite them. I'm not sure if you have the money for them but they are about $50 a month or so depending on how often you want to change the polish and need refills.|`|GfCjZJbXaa	Im a biter to and I have made plans to go and get my nails done in two weeks with my friend.So I cant bite them if I want them to look good.So I suggest you set a date for a good manicure and look forward to it so you then want to never bite.Dont get fake nails they mess up your natural nails and cost a lot.Just get a natural manicure with a cute color =).Good luck|`|nUWGysszaa	Have you tried nail polish? Like putting that on and you don't wanna chip the polish so you don't bite your nails. My sister did that and she said it worked.|`|b30a67bb9890faa58afa5ef3c9a79a91aa	I was a nail biter in fifth grade! It was pretty hard to break the habit - but I did and now my nails grow ridiculously fast! Anyway, what I did was to wear gloves to school (as odd as it looked...it stopped me from biting nails because biting gloves wasn't really great) and then I would sit on my hands. During class, I would also doodle on my papers so my hands would be doing something 24/7. <br>  <br>  And try putting on the nasty-stuff again, except trying putting cayanne pepper or some spice with a really burning flavor to it!|`|sFOncR1Qaa	You're not alone, trust me. Until I was about 12 I would bite my nails. Here is a small trick that worked for me: paint you nails with a pretty color then put the varnish that tastes bad on top. For some reason, when my nails were painted, I didn't want to bite them. Good luck! :]|`|HwAFe0dUaa	Get them manicured or either put acrylic or gel nails on them for a little while.  You can't bite them with the acrylic and then when you take it off, you will  be use to not biting them.  Plus they will always be done.|`|H0sPCJQPaa	I was a big nail bitter.<br>  I just stopped because my grad. is coming up and I want pretty nails. <br>  My nails are long-ish now to :) ?|`|pcUAErpQaa	I stopped cause I had braces. Just think if you dont wanna stop than what DO YOU want to do?   Just slowly stop. Like bite your nails today then the next day a little less then the next day lesser than that day and so on and so on. <br>  <br>   Also the nails will look awful, uneven, humiliation, and BE CAREFUL. If you bite your nails to much it might break and that REALLY HURTS TRUST ME!|`|uHRnqu8Aaa	try to have a mouth appliance (braces, retainers), but if you got nice teeth and a bit pricey for you, try to have something on your nails, either fake nails or nail polish, if you know finger cots, you can put them on your fingers! I bet you can't have a chance to bite your nails again. =)
xwJGMf93aa	I've never had mastitis, but I did have a friend who had it and she was told not to feed the baby the milk while you are on the antibiotics. Then the medicine she took actually dried her up. They told her to pump and dump and then after she was done with the antibiotics she could start feeding the baby again. However, she never got to finish breastfeeding because like I said, it dried up her milk. I have heard that's very painful, so good luck honey and best wishes!|`|5GPDrBPLaa	That sucks.  Thankfully I didn't have this, so I can't provide much help.  However, if you don't find the help you need here, try calling the pharmacy you got your prescription at.  Ask to speak to the pharmacist and get their opinion.  Good luck...I heard it's painful.|`|FLEXqVoiaa	You should nurse/pump as much as possible to help with the engourgment. The milk is fine for your baby, it will not get him/her sick. I've had mastitis, and I know how painful it is! If a bra is comfortable, it may be good to wear one to bed-That way you can use a nursing pad to absorb some of the milk you are most likely leaking. If it's not comfortable, wear an old shirt you don't mind soaking with milk lol.|`|r4N3R0dtaa	I'd definitely try to let your baby nurse off the breast or pump as long as you can. Babies are usually the best answer to relieve swollen, sore breasts. If you can, hold your baby in the football hold, or angle your baby so your baby's jaw massages the sore part of your breast, as it may help unplug the duct (you can always take a bit of tylenol to relieve the pain, if your comfortable with taking it.). You can also apply a heated pad to your breasts before and after feedings to help unplug the ducts. I'm not sure if your wearing a wireless bra or not, but its recommended that breasfeeding mommies wear wireless bras as wired bras can cause damage to milk ducts.|`|S3t69kh2aa	You will feel better immediately if you empty your breasts.  Nurse the  baby, pump, or if it is too painful have your husband help you with this.  Make sure any lumps break up.  Just keep nursing.
OzvcaJhYaa	Marla? Unique. More I think about, the more I like it. At first It thought that it sounded like my grandma's name, but the more I think about it the better it sounds. Yes, I do like it. I cant stand names that are to common, Marla is a nice name.|`|cehvoAGAaa	It's Ok, I prefer Marlene.<br>  Marla reminds me of that movie "My Kid Can Paint" with that little girl who made all those "famous" paintings.|`|byVbvKseaa	um.......i don't mean to be rude but it's kind of boring.....it sounds like an old name.........im sorry.......i hope i didn't hurt your feelings|`|M7NFiBBBaa	i think its cute!|`|Yz1pzloSaa	It's okay<br>  It sounds like a name that is trying to be pretty/cute but it's just kinda....plain|`|Kdr9CRbqaa	umm honestly... no. idk it sounds like an animal's name, sorry or are u trying to name ur pet? sorry again, if it's ur name, im not trying to make fun of it, but it doesn't sound like a person's name.|`|1634875a2112f90de61c5b890983ed03aa	Oh my goodness.  It's my least favorite name.  I just had to answer because I worked with the meanest person ever named Marla.  It's terrrible how a person can affect how you feel about a name.<br>  <br>  Plus, it sounds too much like Marley.  Another name I'm not a big fan of.  What about Mable?  It's old and classic...just a thought :).|`|JHF4Xygyaa	Marla- it's okay, i dont personally like or dislike it..i dont know why exactly..<br>  <br>  But i like the name Larna- little bit alike..kind of.|`|KOcCenrEaa	I like it more then I'd like say Marley.<br>  I'd rate it about a 7 on a 10 scale.<br>  <br>  I like Margo myself.|`|8xlunDHVaa	yes i like marla but margo would be better|`|KHhRgzXtaa	we r italian , its my sisters name,, for me its ok, a little woggy, but ok, xxxxxxxxxxx i know a million marias!, lol<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT--- OMG,, im not wearing my glasses, no wonder why i thought it said maria,,lol, i just noticed now as i went back to my answered questions from a few hrs ago, lol<br>  <br>  i promise, i like marla better!!!!!!!!!!!!! hehehe|`|oE0ApHqPaa	I think it's old fashioned sounding, but pretty.

HXfHkoSHaa	I am truly sorry about this.  I have never dealt with this, so I am only going to advise what I think I'd do.  <br>  <br>  It sounds like this little girl has and is going thru so much.  No doubt she will receive counseling to help her cope.  For now, I'd just let her act like a baby.  And like you're doing, keep reminding her how much you love her and what a big girl she is.  I'm sure the counseling will eventually address the behavior.  Right now, she just needs lots of love from you.|`|AA10154698	Counseling<br>  <br>  Safe Space<br>  <br>  Molested kids sometimes become molesters - just be aware|`|FhlmiI7daa	I think that it is okay to allow some of the baby behavior becuase she really needs to feel comforted and safe right now but just praise her behavior when she does things to be helpful and point out all of the things that she is able to do that your baby can't do yet so that she can feel that she is special.|`|g9vw4ovGaa	I agree with the counseling, maybe that could help her. If the "big girl" thing is working, then keep at it. Offer her some incentive for acting like a big girl. What comes to my mind is when kids start potty training they get big girl panties with their favorite cartoon character, kind of the same thing. Maybe take her to the store and tell her she can pick out anything she wants, if she's acted like a big girl that week. Also, try to do big kid activities, only things that kids her age can do. Maybe a new barbie doll, or a kid make up kit. I'm sorry this has happened to her, and its never affected me or my family but I will be sure to keep you in my prayers.
kQUSPstlaa	Cute names :)|`|fNv2Re6baa	Lars is so masculine and retro. I think of a strong, muscular kind of guy with a body-guard image. I like it.<br>  <br>  Jewel is a really girly name.

EyKJ737daa	Hi sweetie, try grated cheese in a bowl with some grated apple.  my youngest loved it when she was getting the hang of finger foods.  You can also boil up some carrot sticks till they are just tender so they still mush in the mouth when she bites into them.  Also I found toast fingers good for chewing even if they have no teeth, chewing action is still good because it prepares them for speech and helps build up the jaw muscles.  You can also cook up some sausages and take the skin off, slice them and cut them in half again.  They were always a favourite of my kids.  Honestly though, if you feel your baby needs formula then feed her some formula first but just a small amount. Otherwise by 8 months I was actually offering food first and then a quick breastfeed.  You can always offer her smaller drinks of formula during the day to keep her hydrated otherwise water.   My youngest hardly had jarred food either, she just didn't like it so I made up a heap of veggies and boiled them up and just mashed them with a potato masher so they were soft with small soft pieces instead of putting it through the blender and pureeing.  Often I would even let her feed herself with a small plastic spoon.  Missed the mouth on many occasions but she got the hang of it and it gave her independence because at 8-9 months my youngest daughter refused to take anything off a spoon or fork unless she ate it herself.  She is now 17 months old and feeds herself with a spoon and/or fork and it's great.  Just experiment sweetie with what she might or might not like and just stay close to her and supervise her and she'll be fine. make sure you have the camera handy though, you're bound to get some great photos of her feeding herself too :-)  Take care and all the best, most of all, have fun!!|`|HIskrREJaa	My son refused to eat baby food and table food  because I was giving him so much formula that he wasn't hungry and it took me awhile to figure that out... I would at least start giving her rice cereal and oatmeal.  For tablefoods I got one of those mesh feeders and stuck mashed potatos and fruit in it. My son loved that.<br>  <br>  24 oz in how long? per day or per feeding? either way it sounds off for an 8 month old.<br>  <br>  My doc said rice cereal starting around 4 months and then introducing foods at 6 months.|`|FLEXqVoiaa	It's not strange. Technically your baby needs nothing but formula or breast milk until 12 months. It's good that you're not rushing into solids, you're doing what's best for your baby! I do think Gerber puffs are a great place to start, that's what I did with both my kids. And, I have tried them-I think they taste great :)|`|DDIBEvUTaa	sweet potatos are popular.  My son went on a nursing strike & actually started nursing MORE when we started solids...|`|8lcNupM2aa	By 8 months my son was eating finger foods and now he just turned 11 months and has mostly gone from drinking tons of formula to eating big people food.<br>  <br>  When I started out with the puffs he did the same thing and I got really scared BUT those things dissolve very quickly, especially if you buy the generic puffs as opposed to the gerber ones.  It took him about 3 days of giving him the puffs before he really started getting the hang of it.. within a week he was an expert.  After that we moved on to the cheese puffs and then later the carrot or apple wheels.<br>  <br>  At 11 months my son can now eat oatmeal with his spoon and has been done with baby food for quite some time. He wants nothing to do with it<br>  <br>  So just stick w/ the puffs and then worry about table food.. she has to get used to chewing/gumming things first before you worry about introducing other table foods.. but if you really want to know a list of some easy things.. peas or green beans in a can (with no salt added), diced boiled potatoes, yams or squash is also great and very easy.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|g9vw4ovGaa	those gerber puffs are disgusting, seriously try one! When my daughter was 8 months old she only got 2 bottles a day, once a nap time, once at bed time. At this age, she doesn't need that much formula, she can get her vitamins from the baby food, if she doesn't like it try the sweeter ones first. My daughter loved green beans and sweet potatoes, and peas! But I would give her one fruit for breakfast, a fruit and a veggie for lunch and a veggie, fruit and desert for dinner. I would let her decide when she was full. I also had her on sippy cups at that age too, so the bottles only twice a day and that was it. I'm not saying you should follow this to the letter, all kids are different and if you feel like your daughter is happy on just formula, then let her be. I gave Elizabeth honey nut Cheerios and things like that. Mashed potatoes, anything soft, that you can just swallow. She also loved mac and cheese. But she would never eat the meats out of the baby food jars, which I don't blame her. Talk to your pediatrician, i'm sure they'll tell you to lighten up on the formula.|`|DoaMYpfMaa	well you could try bananas or mashed potato's. doctors usually say to start out with vegetables but in your daughters case try starting out with fruits.  maybe if it is sweet she will eat.  you could also mix some baby rice into the bottle. also some kids don't like jared food so make her home made applesauce or mash some carrots.  make sweet potato pie anything but don't be worried i mean all kids go threw an eating stage just be patient.  good luck|`|7WcfzvPvaa	She should be eating jarred food and less formula.  Perhaps you misunderstood the pediatricain.  As for table foods, if she has a few teeth, she can eat.  No peanuts, fish or anything she can choke on.  Try mashed potatoes, cooked veggies like string beans, pasta...etc.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	Try offering a variety of tasty things.  <br>  <br>  You can begin offering finger and table foods.  <br>  <br>  Great finger foods to start with are bananas, pieces of cantaloupe, avocado,  cheerios,  pealed peaches,  steamed broccoli, steamed carrots,  steamed asparagus, and steamed pieces of squash or potato.  <br>  <br>  Table foods to being with include, mashed potato's, cottage cheese,  mac n cheese, cheese,  casseroles,  pretty much any steamed veggie that you eat with dinner,  rice, pasta,  chicken diced finely,  turkey finely diced, and pretty much anything that you like to eat.  <br>  <br>  The more flavorful and tasty the food, the more likely they are to try it.  Some babies don't like baby food, and baby food is not a necessity.  My son would never touch baby foods.  And puffs, they are like styrofoam, so I don't blame her for not liking them.  Just offer her nutritious foods that you enjoy and I am sure she will enjoy them as well.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	u might want to talk to her doc; as she should be eating 'real' food soon, she needs the practice of eating some form of food, whether you buy jars or make your own....
yOLeRiTZaa	.<br>  <br>  ~_~.<br>  <br>  Dad--<br>  <br>  First, I would explain to her exactly what a "Special Needs" person is.<br>  <br>  Then I would point out that "special needs" doesn't always have an appearance. It can be inside of us as well.<br>  Disabilities come in all shapes and sizes. By doing this, you  then, ask her if she can tell if any of her friends or family have an issue "inside". Because They Do. AND She still loves them and she's NOT Afraid..<br>  <br>  Last, I think I would try to find an animal shelter that has a dog or cat, with a leg missing or what not, let her pour her love out to the animal, and then explain how this is no different then a person. Just as the animal needs & gives love, so too, does any person w/ a disabilities.<br>  <br>  Hope I was able to give you some ideas. I think this IS what I would have done.  Take Care!!<br>  <br>  _______~_~.<br>  <br>  .|`|ejbSFv0caa	Personally I think drawing any undue attention is a bad thing.  Her fear might be from peer pressure in class?<br>  <br>  The best people to deal with this is her teachers.  Try talking to her school Head and ask if they are in a position to change her views.<br>  <br>  DON'T take her to get used to them - you might end up making her more hostile.  The school will I am sure resolve the issues, it is most likely they have an 'inclusion' policy and will have lesson to gently change the perspective of the children.  Certainly the schools I have worked with all do.|`|KHhRgzXtaa	wow,, thats weird, my kids dont really get phased by handicapped people,, phew, cos sometimes im scared theyll stare but they honestly never do, i dunno why but ive been very very very lucky,, as id expect most kids to b like yours<br>  i think all u can do is keep explaining it to her, im sure she will understand soon, make sure u do the same, never stare or remark on anything you see,,, act like nothing is different and im sure it will rub off on her, xxxxxxx|`|sDKCX43caa	That is a difficult one my friend and it is one we all have had to deal with in life.<br>  Try drawing on your own experience and how you coped with handling those with special needs.<br>  I personally think it is through education that we learn.<br>  <br>  When Aids developed there was a huge public "fear" of those people through ignorance, but over the years it has become accepted as just another disease and the victims now work just the same as everyone else.<br>  It wasn't something that happened overnight and I think it is the same with your daughter.|`|g9vw4ovGaa	Hermmm, that is a really good question, one of the best that i've seen in a while. Maybe you should try to show her some pictures of different people from different cultures, and explain to her that God made every body different and special, that's why no one looks just like her. They are special in their own way just like she is, and they are just like her, but they look different. There is nothing wrong with looking different. <br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  God bless|`|qhgw9zBxaa	Don't mention these deformities as a bad thing. Make them into different features God gives us. Oh God though he was special that is why he gave him 6 fingers...make it into something special not frowned upon. Let her see you interact with the kids too.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Maybe it is because you keep calling them "deformed" instead of a more appropriate name like "handicapped" or "challenged".<br>  <br>  <br>  Try asking her why she feels the way she does.Perhaps it freaks her out...she cannot help that.Perhaps you should take her to a special day center with challenged people to volunteer so she can get used to seeing them and won't be so afraid.|`|nOVSf06Raa	First of all it should all begin with you ,you should change your choice of words , this alone will frighten a child. If we were blessed with a healthy child we should really count our blessings, some of us only want to see  "perfect" but unfortunately  if we really give it a good look we are not , we all have some sort of imperfection remember that we don't live in a perfect world it would be nice if we could !<br>  <br>   You could take the example from Nature  , not all trees are straight and beautiful, not all flowers are whole some of them are so imperfect that they cause us to look even more and search for a beauty  but the only thing that they have is a beautiful scent for  us to enjoy  .<br>  <br>  In regard of your daughter she will feed on what you tell her and you need to make her understand that "disabilities " are okay and that she needs to  be kind and see kids from the inside and not by their appearances, you can even speak to a teacher about it and perhaps they could talk about at school and tell "all " the kids about it . <br>  <br>  You are the one in charge here! and you are the only person that can help your daughter accepting  people for whom they are and not for what they look like .<br>  <br>  <a href="http://specialed.about.com/od/physicaldisabilities/a/physical.htm" rel="nofollow">http://specialed.about.com/od/physicaldi...</a>
KDb96QS7aa	I don't have a catch all solution for you, but I wanted to see if you're giving her a transitional object? She's used to going to sleep all the time with something warm that smells like you.  Is there any way to simulate a transitional object like that?  Perhaps a cuddly stuffed animal or one of those glow worms that sings a song?<br>  I think it will take a while whatever you do. Babies just don't take well to change of any sort. Especially something like this. Stick with it, I'm sorry it's so hard right now!!!<br>  Edit: one more thought, I just read today that flannel sheets help in transitioning to the crib because it is not cold like a regular sheet when you place baby on it. I laughed at my mom when she made me get flannel sheets in the summer for my son...but he did seem to take to it better...maybe that was why?|`|p2Njf5gBaa	Don't let her cry for a full hour as someone else suggested.  I am against CIO, and some babies never take to this method.  <br>  <br>  If my son won't go to bed after about 20 minutes of trying to put him down,  I stop trying and he gets to come back out in the living room and play again.  Then I will try again in an hour or so and see how that goes.  He usually ends up getting sleepy and nods off very easily after giving up trying to put him down to sleep.  <br>  <br>  I personally find it much more frustrating trying to put a baby down to bed that doesn't want to go.  Its much easier to let him stay up longer, its more enjoyable for him and us.  <br>  <br>  The fighting sleep is a phase that will come and go.  Its a tough one, but you will get through it.  <br>  <br>  Try tiring your baby out during the day,  taking them out and about for an hour a day may even do the trick.  I know if my son spends an hour outside during the day, he is usually exhausted by bedtime that he goes down without a fuss.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	not to be rude, but it sounds like you have created a monster! :0)<br>  as her reaction is so severe and doesn't seem to be wavering, i would suggest you actually talk to her ped about it and see what they suggest....i def wouldn't let her cry herself hysterical, but you have a challenging road ahead of you from the sounds of it....does she have her own room? it might actually improve if she can't see your bed from her's, but i am not sure that would work....but i can imagine it infuriates her to see where she wants to be and not be able to get there........i would also try to start slow, with her in her room, maybe playing in the crib, make it a non-scary place to be, work her up til she's comfy, then retry the naps, if that works by some chance, then i would try her overnight...but like i said, as she has slept with you guys for so long, i would def ask a ped...i am sure they have had to help ppl through it a million times...good luck|`|FhlmiI7daa	I am not a parent yet but i worked at a daycare and at naptime we would play a cd with nature sounds or classical music turned down pretty low and they always took it as a cue that it was naptime.  Maybe try that or a white noise machine with the rest of the routine to see if it soothes her at all.|`|DDIBEvUTaa	it is not easy!!<br>  my son is 6 months.  Since about 4 months I'd gotten in the habit of nursing him to fall asleep because he was mainly nursing when he was sleepy & was underweight so I wanted to feed him as much as I could.  Anyway, when I learned a few days ago that his weight had caught up I tried getting him to fall asleep in his crib & he was not having it.  <br>  Last night was our first success.  It took 1 hour to get him to sleep, and as soon as he was drifting off to dreamland, he peed, waking himself up in a fit.  I changed him then it took about 20 minutes before he finally drifted off.  I just kept laying him down, he kept sitting up.  I leaned in close to him, stroked him, sang his favorite songs.  Grandma gave him a glow worm & that helped a bit too (I kinda rubbed it on my neck & chest to get my scent on it- it seemed to make a difference).  music really calms him down.  Is her room bright?  Blackout curtains help a lot!  We made our own- that has worked wonders for a boy who NEVER  would nap!<br>  good luck|`|FLEXqVoiaa	I usually give up when it's obvious my daughter's not going to sleep-She doesn't cry, she just starts pushing away from me or giggling. <br>  <br>  My girl is 11 months, we used to co-sleep, and her crib is still in my bedroom. I lie in bed and nurse her until she falls asleep, and then I put her in the crib and walk away. Try to feed your baby at the same time each night, in your bedroom in the dark. Don't worry about those who say it will become a bad habit to "feed your baby to sleep." My son is 3 years old, and I nursed/gave him a bottle to put him to sleep until he was about 15 months old. Now he has no issues putting himself to sleep at night.|`|3AoQBdI1aa	I think that you need to see a doctor to see if there is something wrong with her just to be shure. Second of all i think that you need to start up slow. Take down a side of the crib bars. push the crib right next to the bed. This way you can put her in her crib. Just keep a arm around her. Hopefully she will get used to the crib. Then you will probably be able to put her in her crib just in case.
apSTH4TIaa	Its possible, you can get pregnant on days 8-19 of your cycle if because that is when you should ovulate.  It is probably still too early to test.  Wait a week and take a test if you haven't started yet.|`|P19m74Itaa	why wait! save two days of wondering,take the test.<br>  IT IS NOT TO EARLY TO TEST.|`|MqFeJiukaa	If you are really stressing about it take the test.  Make sure you take it with first mornings urine for the most accurate result.  <br>  If it was me I would prob wait a week and see if my period came and if not then test but if you feel you can't wait give it a shot.|`|wGWYRD3Baa	It's almost never too early, and it's definitely not too early now.<br>  If you're scared, just take the test (Store-bought).
h3Ed9qm9aa	I had same problem with my son who is 5months and I managed to solve it only 3 weeks ago. Before this he was either falling asleep in bouncer or with me. After he outgrown his bouncer, I had no place for him to sleep in and I panicked.<br>  <br>  Now he falls asleep in his cot (later wakes up and sleeps with me, but I manage to keep him in cot more and more).<br>  <br>  My solution was Fisher Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Soother. It is a musical toy that looks like aquarium with water, swimming fish, there are bubbles, lights that change and 4 melodies and 3 sounds of water to choose from. For me it was truly a miracle buy. My boy is mesmerised by this aquarium, he falls asleep staring at it, listening to the sound of bubbles and ocean waves. <br>  <br>  I also tried Sleep Sheep but it does not work with him.<br>  <br>  Regarding bigger bouncer, I bought for my boy recently Fisher Price Infant to Toddler Rocker which is bigger compared to bouncer that he was using before and he outgrown. My son is  5months so hopefully your son can use it too.<br>  <br>  My son has other sleeping issues but these 2 items made my life better. You can read product reviews of them and you will see other parents also praise them.<br>  <br>  Before I buy equipment for him, I always read on internet reviews and  ratings by other parents.<br>  <br>  Edit: After reading tonnieRN's response, I remembered that my boy also seems not to be happy on flat surface, and I placed large books under front legs of his cot, to elevate it.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	u  might try a crib wedget that goes under the head of the crib mattress if you think he would like the little incline...you may also talk to your doc; it is slightly possible that he has undiagnosed reflux or something of the sort and that makes it uncomfortable to sleep laying flat on his back..other than that, i would try letting him play in his crib during the day while you are doing something in his room so it is not a 'scary' place, then move on to letting him sleep there for naps, at first putting him down really near sleep until he can be put down and go to sleep on his own, then do the same thing for night time....if he's not got anything else going on, once he gets comfy there, it will probably move along faster....gl, hth<br>  that;s how we have gotten our dd used to sleeping in her crib, and it worked for her...|`|kzyEuRroaa	how about in bed next to you?  That's where my son sleeps and he does great.  A few other options would be to put the crib next to your bed and take the front off, like a co-sleeper of sorts.  I have also used a hammock- took one of my baby wraps and tied it really tight, draping it across the crib and he loved it!  Good luck, baby sleeping troubles are the toughest!!|`|8d5f0adc83a9aec3f83894da97ca8d80aa	Maybe try some soft music? Mine hated their cribs too. Or you could try putting a used T-shirt in the crib with him, like as a blanket. maybe your scent will help. For mine, it was the movement--the swing, the bouncy seat, and especially the car. Lord how many nights did we go for a drive trying to quiet our oldest. And with the car it's also the white noise of the engine.|`|T1q4GWLkaa	Start by letting him fall asleep other places where it easy to pick him up and move him (even in your arms).  Place him in the crib after he falls asleep.  After a few times of waking up in the crib, he may get used to it.  It may surprise him at first though.|`|AA12243380	Can you bring his crib into your room or better yet put your bed or another bed in his room temporarily?<br>  <br>  I think that if you do a modified co-sleeping arrangement for a little while where you sleep near him but with him in his crib that might be a good idea.<br>  <br>  I did that with my twins, their cribs were pushed against our bed in their bedroom.  I could soothe them to sleep, laying down in their own crib, and not have to get up 10 times a night.  The transition to independent sleep was like a piece of cake.<br>  <br>  That said, there is another method.  My brother and his wife just let my nephew cry it out.  They put him in the crib cold turkey, turned off the monitor, went downstairs and didn't return to him until the morning.  My brother's wife told me that their baby looked like he had cried all night long and she felt bad about it but they kept doing it.<br>  <br>  I couldn't do that so I did the modified co-sleep and they are good sleeping toddlers for the most part.|`|FX6fDA7jaa	First time you should let him cry for 5 minutes before you pick up him and then next 10, 20 , 30 minutes . Don't pick up him right away . he will think if i cry someone will come and pick up me . It may takes longer for your son because he is 5 months for newborn it takes shorter , One thing you must be patient and deal with crying and don't give up . Put him in the crib when he sleepy but still awake .  I hope it help you
b30a67bb9890faa58afa5ef3c9a79a91aa	Actually, from what I know, teachers are not allowed to hand out condoms (at least here in Northern California). I'm not sure about health adminstrators, but the same rules may be in force.<br>  <br>  I think they should pass out condoms. The kids are probably going to have sex anyway, so might as well to try avoid making mistakes and hand out protection.|`|9zwSclnLaa	My school doesn't give out condoms.

Jo2DfRzaaa	every time my daughter talks my mom has her revenge - a daughter just like me - why mommy?  whats that mommy?  i'm just harassing mommy daddy!<br>  yea the child is me squared.  every day thank you.<br>  <br>  that story is too funny!  good for you hubby for taking it in stride.  at least she didn't want to take the elephant home.  my daughter has the perfect spot for elephants at our house, right next to her sandbox.<br>  <br>  edit - smile said ding dong.  lol|`|uCnmYEPBaa	That is so hilarious. Straight out of the mouth of babes.|`|AGcwdZGmaa	oh my goodness i so have heaps of times <br>  Karma lol|`|g9vw4ovGaa	I was riding in the car with my 6 year old nephew, and one afternoon he said "aunt brittany, i've been thinking." "what you been thinking about bud?" "I really want my pee pee to be big like daddy's, not like paw paws." And, when my son was potty training and just had to stand up just like daddy, I insisted that he wipe it. One day in a public restroom with tons of women around, he told me "nope, mommy, I wanna shake it like daddy does." And then he put his hands behind his head and swung it around. Never been more embarrassed in my entire life!|`|UfhE3k1baa	Hehe, that is aborable. I am glad you didn't freak out, I have seen some parents loose it really bad when their children ask perfectly natural questions. I am a mother-to-be, so no moments of my own yet. My mom keeps saying my baby won't sleep, because I screamed all night the first 6 months of my life lol. Hopefully that won't be my moment!|`|TQW5E6olaa	I think that's hilarious!! I have to agree with Stay@home, my daughter being like me, is my mother's revenge.<br>  <br>  Oh Smile...I hear ya on the ding dong talk. I was having a conversation with a friend on the subject of ding dongs the other day and we stopped and realized that we had to watch what we say soon enough since our daughters are now 7 months and 20 months but will eventually understand or repeat what we say eventually|`|j2mRop0laa	I'm going to columbus zoo next month! The week of easter. Omg- will I see the new baby elephant! I'm so freaking excited now.<br>  <br>  Anyway, that is soooo hilarious. My kids have never seen male anatomy. I'm thinking I better tell them someday soon that male species have a ding dong......<br>  <br>  lmao s@hm.. see how immature I am?
8yTP3jO8aa	Good question.

I64JOuMKaa	aww<br>  don't worry I can actually relate<br>  when I broke up with my boyfriend<br>  I could actually FEEL it , i mean like i never knew you could feel your heart hurting ..<br>  " nobody should ever forget that they don't need anybody that doesn't need them"<br>  <br>  go by that, if she didn't need you then she's missing out on a great person. I suggest getting some icecream and watch some of your favorite shows, remind yourself that you deserve better because honestly you do . You settle for less because we don't know how much good enough is. Get some ice-cream, hang out with your friends and meet new people, get your mind off her, and put asmile on your face. <br>  If she can see that you're happy even without her she will regret what she did. If she sees that she can break you down and you can't be without her<br>  her mission will be accomplished.<br>  <br>  Goodluck <3<br>  <br>  I know hwo you feel,<br>  today would've been me and my bf;s 3 months ..|`|sMuMfuAgaa	completely.it's all because of your heart rate and adreneline that mix with all your worried emotions.I personally hate that feeling and it's doesn't just happen because of heartbreaks...its kinda the same reason why you may get "butterflies" in our stomach when you're nervous.|`|AA10673927	It's actually real.

Not a good thing, but no medical condition necessarily.|`|Osn1xpu6aa	D:<br>  Yes|`|seJxUXHCaa	I thought that also -- until the real deal came =\ It sucks, I am SO glad I'm not going through that anymore, it's seriously one of the worst times of my life. Hang in there, I found hanging out with friends a lot and just being really close friends with your ex will help. Just remember, "whats meant to be, will always be". That's basically what I live by. I PROMISE you things will get better in time, everything seemed to be done for me when I was going through that and I thought I would never be happy again, but I am really enjoying life now, I'm still friends with my ex and were really close and almost going to be going back out! So, keep your head up and hope for the best! Good luck?

TvYX1yXWaa	i have my son on rice cereal mixed with stage 1 bananas and sweet potato's and my son loves it|`|5oBYGB5Vaa	My children were too old by the time they came out w/ that kind, but I would start the child on the next step whenever formula or milk no longer satisfied it's hunger. My youngest son was a "preemie" & his diaphragm was underdeveloped. We had to thicken his formula w/ cereal (fed w/ a juice nipple), & elevate his head while he slept. That put weight on in a hurry! ~:)>|`|FLEXqVoiaa	I offered my son cereal at 4 months, which he didn't take. At 6 months I started with fruits/veggies, and he did very well with them. With my daughter we skipped rice cereal at the advice of her DR and started with stage 1 foods at 6 months. It took a couple of weeks for her to get the hang of it though.|`|y8d38Sbgaa	Most pediatricians would say to wait until your baby is 6 months old before trying new foods.  The introduction of novel foods before your baby is ready for it might lead to allergies.<br>  I hope this helps and good luck!<br>  Lisa<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.babyfood101.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.babyfood101.com</a>|`|Ks7lENScaa	My son is 4 months and 2 weeks old.  I just started him on rice cereal a week ago.  At first he wasn't taking it.  This week he has taken a like to it.  So if it is working and she likes it keep doing it.|`|UghJ0XROaa	Four months i started on cereal with both girls, my oldest one quickly wen through every other kind of baby food by 6 months. My little one, since they changed the "rules" again, we are waiting for puree until closer to 6 months|`|kGfd8DWWaa	I started cereal when my boys were two months. I felt it was time because the bottle wasn't enough. if your daughter is fine with the food keep going. you and she knows what is best.|`|62ed2c415d781a32b672aaa388d79f43aa	i started my daughter at 3 1/2 months with farex cereal <br>  i went to the jar food at around 4 months she loved it just give your baby a few spoon fulls at a time at this stage.so their little bellies can adjust|`|tEEB5339aa	Well, the first thing you need to remember is that every baby is different! They're usually pretty good about telling you when they are hungry, too! That is an important thing to look out for. When you start to notice she is getting hungrier earlier than usual or her regular meals aren't satisfying her, then maybe it is time to move on to rice cereals and jar food. My son started his rice ceral around 4-5 months (from the other moms that I've taked to, that seems to be about average). Usually, they start jars soon after. My doctor also suggested starting with veggies first, then introducing fruits. If your baby has the taste of sweet fruit before veggies, you may have a hard time getting her to like the veggies. But, again, every baby is different :) <br>  Peas, green beans, squash, carrots, and sweet potatoes are good level 1 foods. As well as bananas, pears, and apples. <br>  At first, to introduce our son to the new foods, we poured a jar into a bottle with a little formula and fed it to him that way. If he seemed to respond well, (docs always want you to look out for adverse reactions in case of allergies) then we would spoon feed him. <br>  One thing that I have started with my son- he is 8 months now- is I will pour some cereal into a bowl and mix it with formula and a jar of food. You can alter the consistency with the formula to ceral ratio, too. He seems to really like it. <br>  And, of course, if you have any questions about when you should be starting what, or you don't feel comfortable....you can always call your doctor. I know hearing an expert's advice always makes me feel a little better!<br>  Good luck and congrats!!|`|gTOmztJxaa	I started giving Victoria a teaspoon of veggies around 6 months of age.  I gave her cereal at 5.5 months of age.|`|KICQQxLxaa	I tried giving my daughter cereal at 4 months, but she wanted nothing to do with it.  She was my first (and only) child, and for some odd reason, I was SO excited to give her food.  She hated it, and the more I read, the more I wanted to wait until 6 months since it is better for them.  I gave cereal again at 6 months, and pureed veggies and fruits at about 7 months.<br>  <br>  My DD was never a big eater.  She would much rather her formula then food, so I didn't really push it.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	i waited until the doc ok'd it about 5.5 mos old....|`|T1q4GWLkaa	I still haven't.  My daughter is five months and two weeks right now.  The doctor said to wait until six months unless she showed a lot of interest.  She is on breast milk only, and a whopping 20 lbs by my estimation.  She was born 7 lbs 7 oz, so obviously, my milk is doing quite enough for he right now.  :)|`|ogdm7RLYaa	Never.<br>  <br>  Have you considered BLW? Much easier, much better for baby. That way she can control when she is ready to start solids, and how much she should eat. <br>  <br>  It's best to wait until after 6 months, but my son starting showing interest at 5 1/2, so I let him have some tastes then!|`|Tc23KWgzaa	That's when I started rice cereal with a little milk and a spoon or two of jar food mixed in.<br>  <br>  TX Mom|`|SjX72fPyaa	I started my daughter on it when she was 4 months.
EWFtQNSdaa	No, because I do that.. Maybe im weird O.o|`|I64JOuMKaa	haha<br>  i wouldn't think she was weird<br>  probably one of those<br>  rich girls obsessed with the nice clothes and their looks<br>  especially if they were wearing gucci purse/sunglasses<br>  <br>  I check my makeup and fix my hair<br>  but only at my locker , cause i have a mirror in my locker<br>  <br>  LOL maybe its the same thing .. except im not walking anywhere and im not wearing gucci sunglasses/purses<br>  <br>  but ofcourse we don't wanna look weird walking around D:!|`|0fc4be2c7fe0b3251308b8c4479f2d3baa	there could be many reasons why she would be fixing herself up...while walking...which is all too common might i add.<br>  <br>  if you know something to add to it, maybe then you could possibly derive a reason, but i am fairly certain that there is no weirdness going on.<br>  <br>  what is weird is that even with the help of a spell checker that yahoo answers provides, that people still misspell the word weird.|`|UtCkgs18aa	Considering I see that everyday, I would just assume she's beauty-obsessed.|`|nzyOCsOiaa	I think that every person should fix up in the bathroom.<br>  I mean, that's what the mirrors there are for!|`|455LuvCzaa	I don't think its weird...|`|wqRwSaGSaa	i would think shs a little to concered with looks.|`|inp056fVaa	thats not weird.....lol|`|Z7kZdBkXaa	I wouldn't think she was weird at all.<br>  I'd just see a girl that cares how she looks (which definitely isn't a bad thing) and has a good sense of style.<br>  That second part depends... she might be doing herself up like that to look good to passersby, but she could also be making sure she looks good for a job interview or for a date or something. <br>  To be honest, most guys don't worry about where a girl is going on first glance, just how she looks and what sort of impression she makes.|`|Uba8Sua6aa	No I'm not a guy I just asked one... here's what he said verbatum...<br>  <br>  Um...

WHat I'm trying to say is it all depends on the guy and the moment, and his attention span|`|94043tRNaa	I would not think she is weird. Maybe she is in a hurry and has to do her makeup on the way. There is nothing wrong with girls looking good. I think guys don't care if its Gucci or not, its all the same to guys.|`|ChzeqFjlaa	I wouldn't think she's wierd....just that she is conscious about the way she looks.

gTOmztJxaa	They are your breasts and therefor YOUR decision.   Breastfeeding should be an enjoyable experience, not done begrudgingly because your man wants you to do it.  Your baby will be ok with b-milk or formula.  A happy mommy=a happy baby!  <br>  <br>  good luck|`|ZIPwq7F5aa	Having a baby is a lot of responsibility. Everyone knows that breastfeeding is way healthier for a young child (4 months is very young). This may sound harsh but, having a baby means that you are committing your life and sacrificing your body to ensure the healthiness of another (you'll have bigger nipples, gain weight ETC.). Its part of the consequences of sex.  If you really care about and love your baby which i am sure you do then you will do the right thing.<br>  <br>  congratulations on having baby|`|hcwp2mAyaa	First question for you: Whose body makes the milk? <br>  Second Question: Whose boobs feed the baby? <br>  Answer:YOURS <br>  Until your husband/boyfriend can grow boobs and start producing milk how and what you feed your baby is your decision. If he doesnt like it tell him he has the above option or he can build his bridge and get over it.|`|kGfd8DWWaa	Tell him if he wants you to keep breastfeeding to get you out of your dads house. Your the mom and it's your body. take control of it and tell your man to be a man and understand that this is what you want to do.|`|irHF6CBPaa	Well breastfeeding is you decision not your bf Have you thought about getting a blanket and covering up<br>  I also agree with the first person and what is your Q|`|r4E2zXL8aa	just stop. simple as that. if your boyfriend loves you he will accept your decision. your boyfriend sounds kind of selfish if you ask me....|`|mABE76Dhaa	If your boyfriend were a real man he'd be your husband. So do whatever you want to do and tell him to live with it.|`|AA11600455	it is your choice. if he is going to be mad at you, then he is not a good guy.|`|8XcRFF6Taa	The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends breastfeeding for at least the first 12 months and the World Health Organization recommends breastfeeding for at least 2 years.<br>  <br>  Four months isn't that long and 12 months isn't that long when you are talking about the life long health benefits provide by your breast milk:)  Are you working?  You have 4 months down already, great job, try to stay with it a little longer.  Breastfeeding being an inconvenience shouldn't be the reason you quit.  Just my opinion...<br>  <br>  Your nipples are getting bigger?  I never had that problem but any damage to your boobs was more than likely caused by pregnancy and unfortunately your boobs never go back to how they were:'(<br>  <br>  You can always use a receiving blanket to cover up, no one will be able to see you nurse.  I understand not wanting to nurse in front of anyone.  With my first I would go stand in the restroom or go to the car to feed him, if we were out in public, lol. And would always go to my bedroom if we had guests.  It's funny now because I could careless who is around when I need to feed #2:)<br>  <br>  With baby number two I never went out and got any nursing bras, I kind of feel like they were a waste of money with my first one.  It is easy enough for me to pull my shirt and bra down.<br>  <br>  Good luck with what ever you choose:)|`|8lcNupM2aa	Can't you just try to hold out until at least 6 months? I know it can be embarrassing because I had my in-laws visiting when my son was 3 months and I had to go in the bedroom all the time.   You can always turn the tv on while you're bf in the bedroom and you know it's very easy to just lay the baby on the bed next to you.<br>  <br>  As far as your nipples they will probably go back to normal, mine did.. and my boobs went down not long after I quit.  My baby weaned himself when he started getting teeth at 6 months so I didn't have to do much.. we were already down to just the night time feedings anyway and I had stopped pumping by then.<br>  <br>  If your bf doesn't want people seeing your boobs then that is pretty childish. Your boobs are specifically made to nurture and nourish your child.<br>  <br>  I say stick it out a little longer! Just a little..I think later in life you'll be glad you did.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|EzOyBLztaa	Do NOT let anyone make you feel guilty about not breastfeeding.  When I had my son, neither of us were taking to breastfeeding very well, despite trying and meeting with several lactation consultants.  He was losing weight and getting jaundiced and I started supplementing with formula.  <br>  <br>  So many people made me feel guilty about it (mostly the lactation nurses) and I felt terrible.  But I felt worse that my son was not eating and was fussy, hungry and jaundiced.  I have tried to keep up by pumping but it is mostly pretty useless.  While I do think that if you can do it, it's great and it probably is best for baby but how many millions of people have been strictly formula fed and gone on to live healthy, normal lives.  Some people make it seem like your kid will be perpetually sickly if you don't breastfeed and that's not true.  In fact, a friend of mine didn't breastfeed her first two kids for very long but the third took to it well and did it for a long time and he is the sickest of them all.|`|vFXkjvFgaa	First off - dump your boyfriend. He sounds like a pathetic, controlling loser... especially on a  topic such as this one.<br>  <br>  Your breasts, your choice.<br>  <br>  Although I think that your reasons for not wanting to BF are ridiculous. My son was born at 36w and just would not latch on. We tried and tried and tried. I would be so happy if I could have actually BF him. I had to resort to pumping and my supply dried up very soon after and now he is on formula and it makes me sick when I make his bottles knowing that I am not giving him the best.<br>  <br>  Stay with the bfing but if you really want to quit over the reasons you gave then that's on you, I suppose. But I fully understand your issue with being uncomfortable about BFing around your dad.|`|KICQQxLxaa	Ok, your boyfriend has nothing to do with this.  If you feel you are done breastfeeding, then you are done.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	if you want to stop, stop.simple. bf doesn't get a say in it. period.<br>  he will just have to deal. mad or not. oh well. he will get over it...|`|Tc23KWgzaa	BF doesn't have a choice in the matter, unless you think he'll get violent with you.  Their your boobs.  You can breastfeed or not, you can show them or not, it's your decision.  Sounds to me like like it's time.  <br>  <br>  I can't believe you end up in your bedroom for so much of the day!<br>  <br>  TX Mom<br>  <br>  PS I breastfed in front of my dad.  I just lay a receiving blanket over my shoulder to my tummy.|`|F8KmTbqjaa	Wow.............It sounds like your in a very controlling relationship.  You need to take control over your body, life and son.|`|VmLZFN4Taa	Your boyfriend sounds controlling. Stop when you want to because it is your decision.|`|8d5f0adc83a9aec3f83894da97ca8d80aa	A woman in church breastfed her baby during mass last Sunday. She had this blanket thing that went over the shoulder of the side she was breastfeeding on, and the other side went under the other arm, so it was kaddy-corner like you know? the top was elastic, so it was easy for her to get into one handed, but didn't fall off at all, it was totally secure. And it covered her completely. She just put it on beforehand, the stuck the baby under the cover. So, you don't have to expose yourself in order to breastfeed. <br>  <br>  But do NOT let your boyfriend dictate when you quite breastfeeding. That's YOUR decision, and one you should make for YOU and the BABY. Not for him. AS the baby's father, he should be more worried about the baby then whether or not people see your boob. Seriously.|`|ev8ZZYx2aa	So the reason why you want to stop breastfeeding is because your nipples are getting bigger and you don't like to go into your room every couple of hours. <br>  Think about the benefits of breastfeeding for you and your baby. There are many. <br>  Breastfeeding is actually easier then formula feeding is. <br>  But in the end the decision is yours.|`|844afb426cc1a9cf5ec93ffd1311e2ebaa	it takes up all your free time?? since when do mommies have free time?? how about putting a blanket over your babies head so you don't have to inconveniently move to another room to feed your precious baby, if you want to scrub bottles, boil and cool water, buy formula, and have a gassy baby, do what feels right, but in my books breastfeeding is the most convienent and easiest method to feeding a baby.|`|UghJ0XROaa	So your boyfriend wants you to keep breastfeeding? If seeing your boobs is the problem you can buy a nursing cover. As for your nipples getting bigger, you either deal with it or stop nursing. If you are going to stop nursing you would be best to do it gradually.|`|FLEXqVoiaa	I don't think anyone here is going to be able to help you, since you're not really asking a question, and the decision you are faced with is a very personal one.|`|aaVod31Gaa	it doesn't matter what your boyfriend thinks. it's your decision|`|w3ob12X6aa	just tell him how you feel and he shouldnt get mad at your decision, good luck|`|3hIr3Dllaa	It's your body and your choice.<br>  <br>  I'd think about how serious you want to be with such a controlling man.|`|AA12243380	I think you can just tell him that he isn't giving you enough support in making you feel confident to nurse him without being ashamed.<br>  <br>  I breastfed my 3 week old in front of my dad, stepdad, and my father-in-law and done cleverly nobody should be able to tell you're nursing.  :-)  I wear a tank top and a hooded sweatshirt a lot.  I pull up the tank and unzip the sweat shirt just enough and boom, there is a tiny little slit and you can even slightly drape the tank over your baby so no skin shows at all.  As far as a nursing bra goes, I usually just wear a sports bra but they do have some at WalMart for 6 bucks.  I bought a couple but prefer a sports bra since it's easy just to pop it out discreetly.  I've used a shield and you can put it on without anything showing.<br>  <br>  That said, I understand your discomfort, believe me.  I weaned my twins really early because I didn't want my boobs showing and I didn't want to deal with the hassle of breastfeeding.  It's Ok to just stop breastfeeding.  I think 4 months is a great job!<br>  <br>  <br>  That said-I feel like bottle feeding was WAAAAAAAAY more of a hassle in the long run but live and learn.  :-)  I wouldn't leave the room to nurse in front of anyone.  You can do it cleverly with practice.
QxJ4tuUCaa	What an interesting question. I can tell you that by the 20th week after the last menstrual period, your baby has developed anatomically enough to receive sound impulses. <br>  <br>  Much of sound is interpretation, so it is obvious that the baby will not differentiate sounds until he or she has heard them repeatedly. Some references state that the baby can distinguish the sound of his mother's and father's voice by the fifth month. I'm not sure about this but I do know that your baby can hear and react to loud sudden noises about this time -- a dog bark, loud buzz, or loud music|`|56b2f958b01573ec0d3749a16e27365aaa	I keep hearing that it's around 20 weeks.|`|xq7S9H5Raa	I think that I heard 6 months or 24 weeks|`|AA11542929	www.babycenter.com<br>  www.whattoexpect.com<br>  <br>  those two sites are very helpful.. right now my liil one can hear EVERYTHING.. lol..

However, I didnt know she was on hormones or trying to get preg.  I kept telling her that she was going into menapause and that she needed to see the doc for something to help.  It was unintentional because I didnt know, and she says that she understands, but I still feel bad.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	bit my boob while nursing it really hurt <br>   my kid is still little i am sure maore pain is on the way|`|bfb230dc1ac989ed2a0e37264327e8a1aa	I think the one thing that hurt the most was my son didn't come to see me when I was in the hospital because of emergency surgery.  Although you can't really punish a child for being thoughtless (he was a teen) needless to say a lot of extra things didn't get done for him for quite a while.|`|a095159fe0597a1cbcdff915d247b333aa	Well, it was Thanksgiving and we went to the park to kick the soccer ball around for fun.  My then 11 year old daughter and I both went for the ball and she accidentally kicked me (bare foot) in the back of my calf.  <br>  <br>  Well, she's a pretty good little soccer player and well, I'm not.<br>  <br>  So, I went down like a stone.  <br>  <br>  I hobbled around for two weeks before the bruise finally surfaced and it was another two weeks before it faded.<br>  <br>  Those deep tissue injuries hurt like hell!|`|VuUz8NgKaa	When my 6 year old daughter gets really mad at me she will tell me she hates me and one day a few weeks ago I got one to her for jumping off the sofa she told me she wished that I wasn't her mother.|`|KHhRgzXtaa	im so glad to hear that your 15 and realise!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  my daughter is 12, recently started high school, and acting like a new person [an irritating one] <br>  shes been saying lately that she dosent need me to do things 4 her, and that shed rather go shopping with her freinds than me, and that im fat, boring, ect ect,,, omg, im freakin cool, lol,, imagine what flack id cop if i wasnt what i am<br>  <br>  i hope my daughter snaps out if it soon, cos im fed up already, good luck to you, please tell ur mum ur sorry and know u acted like a jerk, im sure she will be so happy xxxxxxxxxxx|`|gcs54mvUaa	broke into my house and stole my stuff while i was at work.

UghJ0XROaa	How far above the belly button is the skin that is sinking in? My daughter had one and it went away by 6 months, and now at 2 years old she does not have a "perfect" belly button. It's got kind of an extra flap of skin inside it, it's hard to explain. But it does look like it's sunken in, but in the same as her belly button. I don't think it is related to her throwing up though. <br>  <br>  Good luck, i hope she does not have Cystic Fibrosis, i had 3 cousins who had it and personally a carrier of it. Keep us posted.<br>  <br>  EDIT-My daughter's looked like that when it started going away, then it sunk in like a belly button should be, but it's hard to explain, she kind of has a little bump in the middle of it and underneath that bump is her belly button and right above it is where the little bit of sinking was. I think it will be gone in a couple of weeks, IMO.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	i certainly don't think it is an emergency, but you need to bring it up to the doc on monday and let them test her if they think it is appropriate....best wishes
RxhBUkwSaa	You can expect to be one busy momma!  Try to get your 5 year old involved and give him or her responsibility to help you.  Older siblings can be amazing help, and really can live up to the task if you give them things they can handle... for example, please play with your brother while I feed the baby... or can you bring me diapers and wipes?<br>  <br>  Consider having a doula fhelp you occasionally for the first few weeks while you settle in with number 3.  Doulas can be so useful in so many practical ways, from helping with your older kids, to holding baby while you shower, to preparing a heallty meal. <br>  <br>  Main thing, don't expect to accomplish much more than taking care of your babies.  Don't let uncooked meals, or undone laundry stress you out.  Don't be afraid to ask for help from partner and family!  Go easy on yourself and enjoy the new baby and your older two as well!|`|kGfd8DWWaa	Let your baby kiss your tummy all the time. I did that with mine and my oldest just loves the baby. and have him or her help you, nothing big just little things like holding the bottle or something. they will fell as if they are the biggest kid ever!|`|viGqMW1Xaa	yeah you will be very busy and I hope daddy will be there. My younger two were only 12 months apart and now I am glad I cant have anymore.|`|ki3XY49daa	Expect alot of jealousy from the 10 month old.  It might get bad especially when the new baby starts walking.  At first, they'll be fascinated.  They'll get over it real quick though.  The only thing you can really do is take it one day at a time.  I can this though.  The 5 year old will feel left out, so whenever you get time to be alone with him/her, do that.  I know this from experience.  My kids will be 8,7,5,3 this year and I'm due in September with my 5th and final child.  It's tough, but trust me, you can do it.
HdiNycsNaa	I love it. =)|`|oE0ApHqPaa	My name is Elizabeth!  I love it, it's a classic, although it was very common for my age group, in the top 5 I believe, so it kind of sucked having like a million in my classes (exaggeration).  I don't really like the nickname Lizzie, only because it sounds a bit juvenile, but I was called Bethy when I was a kid, and that didn't stick when I got older, so she would probably shorten it to Liz anyway.<br>  <br>  There are lots of nicknames for Elizabeth.

obN6p3Cgaa	Yes... sorry about your loss...|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Of course it is. If it continues for too long or gets really severe you may want to seek medical attention. It wouldn't hurt to get a little therapy anyway actually.|`|E07VAMNMaa	Yes it is completely normal to go into a deep depression after a miscarriage. being so sad is normal after such a tragic event but you may want to seek some help.

9mSIQA2Baa	No I wouldn't let my daughter do that but if I came along and stayed in a different room I would let her.|`|StJGeiFyaa	If it is not legal for you to rent the condo without your parents' help, then it should not be allowed. That's the easiest way to think of it. There are laws for a reason. 16 is not old enough to be responsible for something of that nature, no matter who you are or how close to home you may be. When you turn 18 you can do whatever you want.|`|c99aa0d7f7f9c98be09c0cdfc426b916aa	Probably not......Remember Natalie Holloway?

That's not even legal.|`|DQkDQraOaa	I don't know if the resort would even allow that. Liability issues and all. I'd check with them to be sure.|`|VuUz8NgKaa	No, I would not. Just because you are responsible doesn't matter, there are crazy people in the world.|`|47HPrDe5aa	No.|`|AA12345296	that depends, do i want a pregnant daughter?|`|7pxJdyRcaa	You sound like a very mature person for 16 but I absolutely would not let you do this if you were my daughter for one reason.  You do not know who you and your friends will come in contact with and at 16 you may not recognize some danger signs.  Have your mother or dad go with you.<br>  <br>  Most resorts would not rent to anyone under the age of 18 unless a parent was present.|`|QqFPNti4aa	while you may be a resposible person at your age you are inbetween a child and an adult.  If your parents are comfortable with this, then I say go for it.  If not maybe if they chaparoned you at a nearby hotel or condo.  Not in the same room.  Then maybe this might help put them at ease.  You also have to remember that it might not be you that your parents don't trust but other adults who might see a bunch of teenagers and try to take advantage of you.|`|FKR45WLPaa	To be honest with you, I probably wouldn't.  It's not that I wouldn't trust YOU, but I wouldn't trust other people at the resort.  Is there not an older person that you all wouldn't mind going with you that you could ask?  There are so many things that could happen, they probably wouldn't, but it would be a hard sell for any parent.  Good luck and be careful.|`|8g7hshqEaa	Sounds like it would be lots of fun - but sorry, i have to say no to this one. <br>  <br>  You say now you wouldnt do anything you shouldnt, but when teenage girls get alone without parents, anything is possible. I know trust me. Maybe you should just have your friends over at your house and go to the mall or something. Good luck|`|S9sZawG2aa	how would you get there? i wouldn't want to be driving up a mountain with an inexperienced teenage driver! haha.<br>  <br>  if your mom drops you guys off and picks you up, i don't think that there's anything wrong with it.. unless there are guys too. but if it's just girls then it sounds very fun.<br>  <br>  when asking your parents, remind them that in 2 years you will be living in a college dorn doing whatever you please, and they need to start letting go. plus remind them that you've never done anything to lose their trust, if thats true.|`|pIsXofvyaa	I would, but then again I'm cool. I'm guessing your parents said no. Why not invite them out for the day and they can stay in a separate hotel? You could even take different cars. Heck, you could even pay for them to stay in a junky hotel if you're already willing to spend that much money. If they say no to that for anything other than work reasons, they're being a bit unreasonable.|`|9UCvu7RYaa	No siiiiir! I remember 16 OH TOO well, lmao!! I would definite have to go on the trip. Now that doesn't mean I would be right up under you guys, but I would be there. <br>  <br>  OMG!! I have twin girls too...I could only imagine!

Uhm, that would be a big NO.<br>  I don't care how responsible you are there are other factors you don't consider. There are alot of weirdos in the world that would love to have a group of unchaperoned teenagers alone to prey on.  There would be no way over my dead body I would let a 16 year old do this- son or a daughter.|`|a095159fe0597a1cbcdff915d247b333aa	Not without adult supervision.<br>  <br>  Also, you generally have to be at least 18 (some places, it's 21) to rent a hotel room or a cabin.  Generally,these places require a credit card number for incidental charges.  <br>  <br>  Even if everyone is extremely careful, skiing is still potientially dangerous.  An adult should be around, just in case.<br>  <br>  I think a ski trip idea could work and it sounds like a great time.  But you should have an adult along.|`|EtTddxAqaa	I would let my children do this but I am not sure it is legal. <br>  I know it isn't where we live because you are technically not an adult, check with the resort and also the parents obviously, maybe not if there were going to be any boys, if it was all girls than I wouldnt even worry about it. (:<br>  Have fun. (:|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	no because i am parent and that is way too much and no adult supervision. it does not matter you are good or whatever. its the point and its not nice.|`|AGcwdZGmaa	NO NO NO even if my kids are responsible its not just them to think about what about the people they don't know that are there anything can happen screw that
i4bjQbPcaa	I doubt they minded.  They were very late in and you do know they probably went straight to bed themselves.   <br>  <br>  You are a babysitter as long as you are in the house they will assume their kids are safe.  You would have woken up if one of the kids needed you. <br>  <br>  They go to sleep night after night.<br>  <br>  Don't stress it x|`|Y8kjVeLyaa	It's ok...after all...I sleep when my kids do at night!|`|43010267fa544a0ad1f25fbecbc72571aa	I would not mind if the babysit was napping while my kids were sleeping, especially since the monitor was on.  It's not like parents stay up all night keeping an eye on the kids.  ;-)  I'm sure if they had had a problem with it they would have let you know.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	What do you mean how would I feel? I don't think I would be upset, if that's what you're thinking. You are not a robot! You are human, and humans get tired and they sleep. The child was in bed, so you didn't really do anything wrong.  It would be different if you had the child with you, and you dozed off. <br>  <br>  I don't see anything wrong with what you did.|`|kprKXEOSaa	I fell asleep a few times, while babysitting when I was younger.  I felt stupid about it, too.<br>  But at 2:15 am, come one, everyone should be asleep.  I'm sure they didn't think a thing of it, especially if you were sitting there with the monitor on, right by you.<br>  Don't worry about it.<br>  They should be embarrassed for staying out so late.  (Unless of course you knew it would be that late.)|`|m2cxGTwgaa	its fine! they wont mind. eespecially if they didnt say anything. i fell completely aspeep before, they had to wake me up! lol. i still babysat. its fine. your human. how do you expect the parents to sleep? you think one staands on guard lisntning for a cry? nope. dont worry about it.|`|TPN1yIj7aa	if the kid was asleep in bed with the moniter on then no problem. most people generally are asleep at 2.15am anyway. have 2 kids 5 and 7mths.|`|ki3XY49daa	That's a hard one to answer.  My kids are nuts though.  They don't understand the whole "go to bed" thing.  I wouldn't have the heart to have someone stay with my kids that long, especially if I knew they worked all day.  You shouldn't feel bad at all.  It is what it is.  No wonder you fell asleep.  I wouldn't have been mad at you.  I wouldn't sweat it too much.|`|bImlg171aa	I think it depends on the parents...most parents would expect you to be exhausted and probably assume you fell asleep if they aren't getting home until early morning. I know I wouldn't be angry. Then again, there are those few "odd ball" parents who wouldn't like that...but that's weird. You should be fine...they sound like reasonable people!  =)|`|uhchod38aa	I think you are worrying needlessly. Unless you were sacked out in their bed or something, taking a nap at 2 in the morning is not a big deal.|`|HXfHkoSHaa	I'd be upset if you were sleeping while the kid was awake and playing, but if the kid is in bed asleep...no big deal.  I wouldn't be upset.|`|ae69df0205dd6e6d96e6d67fdc47b203aa	No you're OK, Pal. The parents would have felt so much more guilty than you. You should have expected a bonus for them being so late.|`|b6d778325abf39d72f52c74b7068dca2aa	Naaaah, don't give it another thought.  Even parents sleep while the kids are sleeping.|`|EtTddxAqaa	I would be furious only if the baby was awake and playing, or in the dishes or something haha. I would so not be mad if the child was sleeping and so were you. If i were you in this situation I would call them, and explain that the other night this is what happened, It was late and I bet they would understand that you needed some resting time. No big deal. I would assume the best actually and hope you had dozed off, (:<br>  I am sure things are perfectly fine, if your counciouns is still on a rollercoaster than call and explain yourself, they apologized so there is no big deal in my mind, you seem like an awesome babysitter, I would hire you. (: <br>  keep up the good work and keep earning the extra money!|`|DnNkCF6Taa	I would not mind as a parent if you were napping while the kids were sleeping.  As a young adult that is in school, I would have an idea of what your day is like, and don't expect you to stay up all night simply because your there.  If you were sleeping and the kids were running a mock, I might mind, but if they were asleep there is no trouble at all.|`|NHRVsSlTaa	I have done this once or twice! Was embaressing but all the kids were sleeping and they said to me that they didn't mind me sleeping and that i should of layed down and went to sleep or something - Just depends really some parents may find this a bad thing others may not mind! If you know them well and they are friends or family Ok but if it was a business or something that would be a bad thing.|`|WYuK1OUnaa	poor you... I dont think you should worry too much. As long as you know for sure you would have heard the baby via monitor.<br>  I am sure mum and dad are probably in bed most nights before 2.15!<br>  Pleased to hear they apologised for being late.<br>  You sound like a very responsible sitter so relax.|`|YT1vOwq6aa	I would be so sorry for leaving you till 2.15 am!!1 thats just horrible, as long as my kid was sleeping i would deeply feel sorry for you.|`|TAgAnfIbaa	you in my book are fine because you had the moniter on and it was late at night when they got home. I wouldnt worry about it.
Jhkoz18Xaa	The old "make love every other day" is out.<br>  Studies have shown that you improve your chance getting pregnant making love once a day, every day during the 5-6 fertile days and the day of ovulation. In addition making love 2-3 times a week every week also improves your chances getting pregnant.<br>  Calculate your fertile days here:<br>  <a href="http://babymed.com/tools/fertility/calendar/" rel="nofollow">http://babymed.com/tools/fertility/calen...</a>|`|jzAfst8Taa	bd every other day that way all the bases are covered since sperm can last up to 5 days and you have a better chance of getting pregnant and not missing your ovulation day good luck
jwGkGaiCaa	XD at the Chuck e cheese by my house you have to be 18 or older without a parent to even go in so my friends and I went for a friends 18th birthday, it was kind of funny. Also when we were bored as teens we'd just go to the local elementary school to hang out... There really isn't that much for teens to do if they want to be outside so I say why not as long as they're not too disruptive?<br>  <br>  ArmyandDream - What 12-14 year olds do you hang around? Maybe it's been too long since I was that age but the most "mature" content thing we talked about was maybe kissing a bf if we had one (which we usually didn't)|`|AGcwdZGmaa	yeah its pretty annoying we don't want our little kids being bothered by other kids and anyway it is for the little ones not yous bigger kids they would have been thinking omg go grow up hanging around lil kids play areas how immature|`|uvvPusctaa	hahaha lol<br>  losers!<br>  :)|`|XOtOMncwaa	I guess if your out of the way it's fine. But theres nothing worse then when my son wants to get on a slide and theres a 16 year old standing in front of it on their cell. Maybe instead of going into the little kids section you should find a different place to hang out. I don't like it when I'm in a play place and theres teenagers in there acting up, cussing, and hitting each other, that really bugs me. Maybe since your older then move on to the big kid things!|`|WtElgJDtaa	im not a parent but then its very childish what youre doing, and you should let little kids play on their area and you should go to the area thats not for little kids....Grow Up!!|`|01Mu3wUeaa	I don't know...it depends.<br>  <br>  <br>  The area was destined for kids..not teens.She had a right to be a little peeved.|`|wi0xPFhQaa	Yes because most kids 12-14 years of age like to discuss things that toddlers do not need to know about at their age, yet they hear whatyou are talking about. Then they start asking mommy and daddy questions. Ex: sex, tattoos, piercings, makeup, money, games that are not age appropriate. They have hangouts for kids your age. Moms appreciate it when you are not just hanging around in toddler areas because they are afraid their child will here these topics being discussed.|`|lc8biEdeaa	I dont see how it hurts anyone.I go to Chuck-e-cheeses with my<br>  friends too and were like 16. As long as you dont bother the little kids <br>  or say innapropiate things then I dont see a problem.Theres not much<br>  we(teens) can really do either,were mostly broke and cant shop at the<br>  mall so what is there?the play area. Its free and fun lol.<br>  <br>  And I dont see how its childish when your bored to death and trying to find something cheap to do not far from your house because you cant drive.(most of us cant get a car) ughh..|`|b9U4MjX9aa	It would depend.<br>  <br>  If you are just hanging out and not getting in the little kids' way, no problem.<br>  <br>  But if you are taking up the equipment, or roughhousing so it's not safe for the little ones, then I would be angry.|`|8YGzqHgZaa	u guys are retarded . wats so bad about it ? its not like they r harming the children in any way . i like sitting in them too and im 14 . just do it . as long as ur not bothering anyone .|`|xVEqBjDVaa	Not if your in the way of the kids or anything. You remind me of my 14 year old, she gets overly excited when we take her 4 yr old sisters to Chuckie Cheese. Lol|`|CxvUDpfiaa	wait hold up your 14 years old hanging out at chuck e cheese lmao...<br>  <br>  my question to you is WHY?

ojTcrqAOaa	Well, it'll be difficult at first.<br>  I took me a long time to get them in.<br>  It's easy to get them out, but tough to get them in.<br>  You have to clean them EVERY time you wear them(pfft, i dont).<br>  And do NOT wear them when they have a tear in them.<br>  Do not sleep in them. <br>  Your eye doctor will tell you more things.|`|kRaVa0Wraa	no. they dont hurt.<br>  they have different kinds, too. they have disposable and the kind that you keep.<br>  they have soft kinds and hard kinds....<br>  etc etc.<br>  you just have to see which one is right for you.|`|Q08GpskDaa	No, after awhile you don't notice you have them in. And I'm not sure if its just me, but I see out of them better than I do with glasses.|`|1gVDZrPuaa	They only hurt if you sleep with them in, I do that a lot and it can hurt pretty bad when you wake up.  I just never learn.|`|pOZubuOcaa	I just got some last week...<br>  they take time to get used to<br>  you have to clean them<br>  don't sleep with them<br>  etc<br>  <br>  the eye doctor will tell you though|`|af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	nope they don't hurt at all you really don't even feel them seriously<br>  <br>  at first they might irritate you but its normal the first few times you put them on your eyes are going to water as if you were crying its normal til u get use to them...<br>  <br>  also<br>  <br>  don't sleep with them!|`|Z7dShLRLaa	No they dont hurt, they hard to put in at first <br>  <br>  I've been wearing contacts since 7th grade<br>  Yea dont sleep with them, they worsen your vision.|`|xSEXFWJ9aa	They are not that hard. You just have to keep them clean and remember to take them off every night|`|LMRaSXFeaa	no it doesnt hurt, they are pretty hard to get used to though.<br>  <br>  when you put them in, its easier to just pull down your bottom lid and put them in.
SA1y0lm1aa	They left mine in till after the baby was born and then i asked when they could take it out and the nurse said if i wanted it out i have to get up out of bed walk on my own to the bathroom and go pee.... and if i could do that on my own they would take it out.... i did to they took it out.....|`|ZfRucXTMaa	When I had my daughter, they put it in as soon as I entered the hospital to give me fluids. They quit giving me fluids right as she was born.  About an hour after she was born, they took it out. I guess it could vary from case to case. If you are really concerned and want to know, I would just ask your doctor.|`|8wVj8odOaa	yes you have to have an IV in case there is an emergency. As for how long it stays in, I always demand mine is removed within 5 hours after delivery.|`|BfBMRlNNaa	You actually may not have to get one, it will really depend on your labor. If you are induced or have any other reason for getting one they will more than likely take it out shortly after you give birth.|`|9BHQ6dcEaa	Ya it just depends on the situation, but you should be sure to write it down and ask your Dr. about it.<br>  If you're anticipating going all natural, even then it's still a good idea to get an IV start with nothing attached to it, that way should something go awry you won't have to go through all the stress of getting that taken care of in the midst of all your pain, they can just hook you up as needed.<br>  Even with all that said, I had an epidural and they left the IV in me for about 4-6 hours after the birth.  Maybe less, but I'm thinking it was about that long.  I think if I'd spoken up and asked them to take it out they would have earlier-- That's the thing to remember when you're at the hospital, you're still YOU and you can still ask questions and be a little on the bossy side (nicely though!) the nurses OUGHT to be there to help you, not just do what they think is the best thing for themselves.|`|EzOyBLztaa	I got an IV the day before (I was induced).  I had it until two days after my son was born.  I wound up having a C-section and they were giving me pain meds through it for the day after.  After they just left the port in for another day.  I think it was just in case I had a reaction to something.  I have VERY small, hard to find veins (they had to stick me 4 times to find a vein initially) and they didn't want to run the risk of having to try and find one again.  I hate needles but, honestly, after the port is in, you don't feel a thing.  Also, it's the farthest thing from your mind when you are in labor.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|apSTH4TIaa	Depends on whether you are induced or are having pain meds.  I had 2 babies in the hospital and they usually give you an IV in case of emergency and it stays in until the baby is about 8 hours old as long as you are having no problems.  I had my other 2 babies in birth center and had no iV or meds at all.  Talk with your doctor about your wishes, but it depends what meds you need.  If they have to poke you even once its best to just get the IV with the lock so they don't have to poke you any more times once they have IV access.  With my last one in the hospital they put it in as a precaution, but when we didn't need it they took it out a few hours after the birth.|`|wpu8CUtnaa	My IV was taken out the day after my daughter was born. But I was put under and had a c-section. It really depends on your situation.|`|MqFeJiukaa	My son just turned 2 weeks today.  I had a drug free birth but I was induced with pitocin.  They took the IV out when he was 8 hrs old.|`|Xg3CtRGWaa	You should check with your OB or the hospital on their policy; I did not have an IV for the birth of my daughter. You may also want to look in to a heparin lock instead on an IV. I cannot speak from experience but it is my understanding that they make it easier for you to be mobile.

It takes a while sometimes for the stomach to settle.  That, combined with your nerves could be making you feel sick.|`|AA11831450	Too soon for morning sickness. You probably just have a sensitive stomach. The flu is a particularly bad one this year and the nausea, vomiting, etc. with this one is longer lasting than the regular 24 hour type of flu. Everyone I know- myself included, had stomach pain for a week or more. The really bad part only lasted 1-3 days. Eat when you can, but be sure to drink juice and water. Give yourself a break from your boyfriend - there is nothing fun about being sick on and off and having someone trying to be amourous. If he is a good guy he will understand, and even offer to fix you soup. <br>  I hope you feel better|`|kaqPSgTVaa	It's probably still from being sick. It's too early for pregnancy symptoms.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Nobody here can say if you will be pregnant or not.You will have to wait for your period or take a test for that one.<br>  <br>  More than likely you upset your stomach.What did you eat? you still need to eat simple foods since you are recovering from a stomach virus.It is only natural that you will feel icky for a few days.<br>  <br>  Prevention:<br>  <br>  Norwalk virus<br>  (Just remember that hand sanitizers will not kill this virus.House hold cleaners such as Lysol will also not kill you.You must use bleach.)<br>  <br>  The Norwalk virus causes viral Gastroenteritis which is known as the nasty 24 hour bug that causes explosive and sudden diarrhea and projectile vomiting.Usually non life threating but can cause complications in the very young,elderly and those with compromised immune systems.<br>  <br>  PREVENTION-Wash your hands before preparing food/eating food and most importantly, TOUCHING YOUR MOUTH/NOSE/EYES.<br>  <br>  The ONLY way to become infected with this virus is if you ingest the contaminated fecal/vomit particles through your eyes,nose and mouth.<br>  <br>  It is impossible to "breathe" in the virus BUT possible to become infected by breathing in aerosol "spray" droplets from someone vomiting right next to you.(the droplets settle within minuted but can still infect someone until cleaned with bleach)<br>  <br>  Even if your whole family breaks out with this virus, you can prevent it by washing your hands for at least 15-20 seconds with warm water and soap.Remember that you are not killing the virus, you are washing it down the drain even if you use an antibacterial soap (which only kills bacteria, not viruses) hand sanitizers are also not successful in killing the virus.<br>  <br>  If a member of your family comes down with the virus, let them know to wash their hands AFTER a bowel movement and vomiting.<br>  <br>  To clean infected areas, clean with BLEACH.Clean bathrooms (all infected areas) with a bleach solution as soon as possible and be sure to prevent cross contamination and wash your hands afterwards.Especially children! wipe down all commonly touched objects like door knobs, faucet handles, light switches, toilet flushers etc.<br>  <br>  People are STILL contagious even after 24 hours after their symptoms settle down so it is always important to wash your hands after the rest room (which you should do anyways!)<br>  <br>  The key to staying Norwalk virus free is to keep sanitary.Wash your hands after using the bathroom...you could prevent other peoples misery as well as yours!!<br>  <br>  TIPS:Do not share any cups/plates/utensils with an infected person and be sure to wash in a bleach solution to prevent cross contamination with the rest of your family.
3rda58OCaa	You could also elevate the head of his bed, and have him blow his nose before bed.|`|C0K3Bo2Aaa	Hi. Keeping his room on the cool side might help. We had our son in the emergency room so many times I've lost count. By the time we got to the hospital the coughing/wheezing/puking had calmed down considerably. We were told the cold air did it. Some times he would still need a breathing treatment or two but..<br>  As he got older the doctor prescribed Claritin for him, that helped too as did those plug in menthol thingys that Vicks makes. They just seem to help him breathe easier. His doctor suggested filling the bathroom with steam from the shower and sitting in there until his lungs settled down. One last suggestion from the doc which "Connor" loved, he was to have warm cups of cocoa and breathe as deep as he could through his nose. This was to help thin the drainage.<br>  Hope he feels better soon. Poor lil' boy, poor mom too!
8d5f0adc83a9aec3f83894da97ca8d80aa	Honestly, i've always rocked my babies to sleep, and if they woke up, I'd do the usual--check the diaper, is it time for a bottle, that type of stuff. If it wasn't, I'd cover them back up, rub their backs or tummies. My two were like that. When they were really little, up until they were a good 6 months old, I often had to put them in a carriage or a cradle and rock them gently until they finally went out. Sometimes I played soft lulliby music, sometimes they went into the baby swing. I never did believe in crying it out, either especially not when they're really young.|`|fd34d7830f1987fa091fa8de50613944aa	My son is 10 months. When he wakes up crying in the middle of the night, I try the bottle, and if that isn't working I pick him up and rock him. It usually takes a minute or two and he is back out. I wouldn't let him cry if he needs me, even if it is just for comfort.|`|F8KmTbqjaa	I can't answer your question until you say how old your baby is!!!!!|`|Tc23KWgzaa	My kids didn't fall asleep easily, either.  Their daddy patted their back some.  We swaddle and pacify the same as you.  I put it back in 2-3 times.  Our first had to cry...she just did.  Like you said, she was a fighter baby.  She'd be making noise until the very second she fell to sleep.  When she'd cried a little bit, worked her way out of the swaddle, now exhausted, we'd go replace her binky in her mouth and she'd settle.<br>  <br>  You do realize that before long, baby's going to cry because he wants to see you.  Big tantrums here.  I don't think he's at that point yet, but you do need to teach him to comfort himself back to sleep.<br>  <br>  TX Mom|`|uCLenopbaa	my son wont take a pacifier anymore!! :(<br>  <br>  so i wait 5 mins to see if he will fall asleep, and if he is just wining and not crying then i let him continue (he sleeps in my room, so its not like i cant hear him) and if he wont stop i check his diaper, pick him up, hold him for a while, and if he wont stop crying i  finally feed him to get him back to sleep.|`|mAJZFmIEaa	I'm a sucker for my little girl, if she won't go to sleep on her own i lay with her on my bed, Bad habit i know but i can't just leave her there, it's even harder when she uses the real tears. Everyone says she is spoilt and i am doing the wrong thing but at the end of the day it's my choice and i'm the one who will have to live with it|`|844afb426cc1a9cf5ec93ffd1311e2ebaa	I always held my baby when it was bed time, with snuggles and lots of love and kisses, now at 23 months old he goes to bed without being rocked and has a sippy cup of water for when he gets up first thing in the morning. Hold your baby, love him and use alot of affection, they grow up way too fast.|`|HqOkC2YHaa	In this case, I would let the baby stay up longer even though it is their bedtime. The baby is bound to fall asleep for the night so why force it?Then try again the following day for the bedtime|`|kGfd8DWWaa	have you tried burping him. that might be a gas bubble rather than a i need my binky cry. and trust me, sometime you will have to let them cry it out. they have to get their lungs nice and hard for being a teenager! LOL!|`|8lcNupM2aa	Well I don't know how old your baby is. When mine was just an infant I would bf or bottle feed him until he was asleep in my arms, in the dark and quiet and then put him in his bed.<br>  <br>   At around 3.5 months he stopped sleeping through the night and that lasted until he was like 10.5 months old!  It was tough but what I learned in the end is that I had spoiled him a bit by not letting him cry it out just a little early on... I had vowed never to let him cry it out but let me tell you.. by 11 months unless you have the patience of gandhi you will! even if it's only for 5 minutes.<br>  <br>  Also I have learned that more often than not it really is just fussing in their sleep.. once I learned to leave him alone for more than 10 seconds he started sleeping a lot better.  It turned out I was arousing him fully from his sleep by getting him up out of the bed etc..<br>  <br>  Btw my baby wouldn't take a pacifier past around 4 or 5 months.<br>  <br>  Good luck and do what you think is best|`|AA12243380	How old is your baby?<br>  <br>  I would swaddle and stay with my twins when they were babies until they fell asleep.  When they turned around a year old I was able to put them down awake and they would go to sleep on their own, and I didn't have to do CIO.  They have pacifiers, a book, a sippy cup, a blankie, and stuffed animals in their crib now at 21 months.  When they were a year they went down with a bottle and pacifiers (no books or toys).  Bad, I know, but I was put to bed with a bottle and I have never had a cavity because I didn't fall asleep with it in my mouth and neither do they.<br>  <br>  Anyhow, I'd use a pacifier and when they can put it in their mouth themselves they shouldn't need to cry-it-out because they'll already have their soothing "crutch"  :^)|`|gTOmztJxaa	Well, my baby falls asleep while she's having her bedtime bottle, so I just lay her in her crib and exit the room.  If she happens to wake up before midnight (which is rare, but does occasionally happen), I wait a few minutes before going back into the room.  Generally, she will fall asleep again without my assistance.<br>  <br>  But, there are times that she will sit up or stand up and can't lay down again!  So I will lay her down, make sure she has her paci, rub her back for a minute or so, then leave the room while she is still awake.  Most of the time, she will fall asleep on her own.  <br>  <br>  She takes another bottle at midnight, so after that bottle, I do exactly what I described above.  She will sleep until 6:30am/7am.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:  Oh, he's only 3 months old?  When my baby was that age, I would pick her up and soothe her back to sleep.  My baby is now 8 months old.  <br>  Good luck!|`|bb7b4M9Xaa	I Just usually give her a little more of my boob for like 5 minutes to soothe her and she falls asleep ;)|`|n6XYYyoLaa	well i don't have that prob thankfully...so far; but i wouldn't let her cry herself silly at any age...i guess i am lucky, she's always went down without a fight...and slept through..she's nine mos now....my mom says they give you an easy one for your first, so u will have more, LOL|`|pXSKSS3daa	Either my husband or myself go in, pick him up, and rock him for a few minutes to calm him down. Usually that is all it takes. We lay him down drowsy but not fully asleep.
58G7ZAJpaa	You're fine!!  I have GD, and of course during the class we have to take, the discussion of "soda" was brought up with the nutritionist.  They recommend diet anything, especially because of the carb count.  You can drink caffeine, just dont be a junky and drink 3-4 cans a day.  I limit myself to one can a day of Dr. Pepper - now DIET dr. pepper.  If I don't get caffeine, I'm a bear!! lol.<br>  <br>  No worries, your baby will be just fine.<br>  Congrats to you and good luck!|`|fG12VXSMaa	....well... how healthy can a can of chemicals, sugar and fizz be good for anyone? @_@<br>  <br>  At least while ur preggers drink something like juice or something.  U dont wanna risk anything, right?<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|8wVj8odOaa	as long as you stick with the caffeine free, you are fine! Think about it, if you ended up with gestational diabetes, what would you drink?|`|kaqPSgTVaa	That is absouletly fine. I drink a can of Diet Coke a day. My doctor gave me the go ahead to do that. You are fine.|`|BzCYQlcuaa	i am a diet coke junkie too! now that i am pregnant i only have one can a day.. or every other day. i know drink sprite or ginger ale ( stinks i know) but i think caffeine free soda is better for our baby's!<br>  <br>  congrats!!!!|`|2ObqoJbKaa	As long as you are always drinking the caffeine free diet coke, then I think it would be ok to have a can or two a day. Diet soda is fine to drink while pregnant, it won't hurt the baby. Just make sure there's no caffeine in it.|`|jgtfWjE4aa	dakota blue! that's a freakin' gorgeous name<br>  <br>  congrats!<br>  <br>  and, seriously, i wouldn't worry about it your baby will be FINE.<br>  <br>  just so you're not drinking 5 cans of coke/diet coke a day.|`|ykP7I3caaa	Caffeine is the only problem with Coke or Diet Coke besides the fact that it's technically junk food. If there's no caffeine you're perfectly fine mama!|`|JnLoHaoAaa	1-2 cans a week is definately ok! You are allowed a treat, you know :)
IU4uNH97aa	well I was always aloud to wear what ever i wanted whenever I wanted. There were a lot of us so my mom had bigger and better fights to pick with us. I used to wear my bathing suit around the house sometimes in the winter ... i was a weird child.<br>  <br>  For me daughter shes 4 i let her pick whatever she wants to wear except for when we go to church or somewhere really nice or anything like that. She does a pretty good job, she likes to match so it doesn't look horrible and she always asks me if I like it then after i can make minor changes so it looks better to me. But for the most part i let her pick.<br>  <br>  For my sons who are 3 and 2 i give them 2-3 options on what they can wear though out the day and they chose from there so it gives them the feeling of independence but only not really, haha. When they are like 4-5 ish i will let them pick out there own clothes though.|`|FvhCUHjxaa	Preschool, surprisingly I picked everything that matched and I've always been very OCD about matching since then lol go figure.|`|T1q4GWLkaa	Kindergarten some times, but sometimes my older sister would pick them out.  Everyday, probably second grade.|`|rSWX0CZ7aa	4th grade was when I started going with my mom to go shopping and pick out clothes.  Before that I didn't really care about clothes so my mom just bought whatever and I would just wear it.  But later I started becoming more interested in clothes and fashion so I wanted to pick out some stuff. :D|`|1JLEySEHaa	I started in Kindergarten.<br>  <br>  But my mom still helped me because I couldent<br>  match back then.|`|mvKbfkhGaa	When i was in 2nd grade.....i think...lol =]|`|xVEqBjDVaa	Haha, he sounds like the boys in my house! I still have to tell my 18 year old to go change his shirt cuz he doesn't match. Boys will be boys! I started when i was like 6, with a bit of help. My 4 year olds even now have an idea of what they want to wear. My 14 year old started picking out her own clothes when she was 2nd grade|`|9UCvu7RYaa	I was 1st or 2nd grade because my mom or my older sister would help me. They always negotiated if I had a special request that I really wanted to wear. As long as I matched it was fine. However, I went to private school until I was in middle/ high school so I didn't have many choses and afterschool clothes didn't matter too much....as long as I matched lol!|`|vj3WSxzWaa	Pre school age,,,not that I got to wear everything I picked out of the house,but,I did get to chose!<br>  I let me son as well,and he is 4,,,and if we are going someplace,I will give him a choice of 2 different pants and shirts,that will match,no matter what he picks!|`|jwGkGaiCaa	I started before I can remember and that's around age 3-4 when I have memories so it's been quite a while.<br>  <br>  Some guys have overly controlling moms that like to do everything for their baby boys|`|zHB0utgQaa	When I was in Grade 2 <br>  I had to think about that x)|`|S9sZawG2aa	omg haha! how lame<br>  <br>   probably like 3rd grade
BfBMRlNNaa	It would probably be easier if you find a gynecologist, or midwife now rather than after you get pregnant. A lot of the good ones tend to be pretty booked up and it will be easier to get in to see them when the time comes if you are already a patient of theirs. Plus, once you are pregnant your doc will do more than just confirm it, they will get you started on your vitamins, check for heartbeat, do blood work, etc. It's just nice to start the process with the same person who will be there with you when the baby is actually born. You want to be sure to take the time to find the right person who makes you feel comfortable and is going to listen to your needs and wants in regards to your pregnancy and delivery. Sometimes you need to go to more than one doc before you find the right one, which is another reason to go ahead and start looking now. All the best to you and your growing family!|`|oHNrktxTaa	I went to my OBGYN prior to first time trying. He had me begin prenatal vitamins for three months before my husband & I started to try. I think it is a good to have yourself checked out before & to discuss all.<br>  Of course, when you do get your BFP, than you would call your OBGYN & make an appointment.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK & HAVE FUN TRYING!!!!|`|oqUlYXqtaa	it'd be better to start looking for an obgyn before you get your BFP to be prepared and make sure it's one that you'll like :)<br>  you can also ask doctors online for free and find others going through similar situations, try fertilityties.com<br>  good luck!|`|g6pqGjrkaa	You meet a good gynaecology doctor and take her advice|`|bf8lx9gxaa	Before sweetie.?|`|kaqPSgTVaa	It's best to go before hand to get a pap smear and exam to make sure you are healthy and good to go.|`|BzCYQlcuaa	i went to the OBGYN when i was TTC. its good to go and get one you like. i really like my OBGYN she was so nice and can OBGYN can give Better advice on TTC. it took me 15 months and i am only 23 years old. i thought i would take only a month! so my OBGYN really helped me threw that 15 months! good luck! baby dust!
kzyEuRroaa	Nesting has hit me at different times for different pregnancies.  With my first, I was moving furniture at 9 months pregnant.  With my last, well, I started frantically cleaning on a Sunday, hounding my husband to do the dishes.  Good thing I did clean- my water broke at midnight, and baby was born 7 hours later.  My husband never did the dishes though LOL!!|`|MqFeJiukaa	With all my pregnancies the nesting urge kicked in about a month before labor but the detailed cleaning you are talking about I did about a week or 2 before labor began|`|PLbmKNpvaa	I've had sporadic moments of nesting all the way through my pregnancy. To the degree of getting onto my hands and knees to scrub skirting boards at one point (ok, they WERE filthy... but it's not normally something I'd do!).<br>  I think everyone is different and it depends on your circumstances as well. I'm 34 weeks now, but I was nesting as early as 12 weeks so you can never really tell.|`|A8nHjEzmaa	LOL<br>  With my first and fourth pregnancy we were moving into new houses so I guess mine lasted from the day we moved in until each child was born.  I was tired.  The first child was late and had to be induced.  The fourth child was 2 weeks early.  The fourth one was born December 4th so my nesting included stressing out over Christmas shopping.  I had almost every bit of it done before she was born on December 4th.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA11542929	i know of alot of people who nested and didnt go into labor, ive done the same and thiis my first one.. <br>  i heard alot of people say that one day they would wake up and just cleaned and cleaned and cleaned and didnt stop and ended up goiing into labor hours later..|`|SA1y0lm1aa	i nested in my 8th month every time....:P some people nest really early and others a day or two before the big event ......
e907f296c0cad138cf4b71ab72a9a9eaaa	I wouldn't go to the hospital right away, I would just try and relax for the rest of the night and see how you feel tomorrow. if you still aren't feeling well than I would call the hospital and see what they think that you should do. you're probably just overwhelmed with the shower and what has happened with your uncle and your body is trying to tell you to relax and try and get some much needed sleep|`|58G7ZAJpaa	it could be from stress, but to be honest with you, that's how I felt before I went into labor with my daughter.  I'd call the nurse/dr. on call and get an opinion, or go to the hospital.  being that far along, there's no telling.  You may need to get checked out just in case.  I'd always rather be safe than sorry.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you, and hope all works out!|`|SA1y0lm1aa	your stressed..... every thing effects you 100 times harder when your pregnant...... force yourself to eat something or you will get the shakes even worse when you do get hungry.... just a little something ..... and talk about the stress with hubby and try and get your mind on something else for about an hour and your body will calm down.....|`|rFwGnZIJaa	I would to be safe and to make sure everything is ok. Also if nothing is wrong it will put your mind to rest and maybe you can relax.|`|MXXOICquaa	your fine quit worrying its all the hormones and the bad news nothing is wrong with you just take a nap and you will feel fine|`|4E2BoVptaa	There are a couple of things that could be happening. I can tell you the possibilities, but you need to talk to you doctor to be 100% sure!<br>  <br>  1) You could have low blood sugar. Even pregnant ppl who are not diabetic can display diabetic symptoms. Low blood sugar can cause a panic attach like symptom. My OB told me about this one. It surprised me. If this is the case, eat cheese or nuts and wait a small bit and you will feel calmer but tired. <br>  <br>  2) Extreme emotional and physical fatigue. If you were out being active but you were under emotional stress. the activity could have worn you out much more than it normally would. It's like when you're little and your body fights to keep you awake. You just need to sleep and hit the reset button. You'll be fine. Oo. drinking water will also help with this.<br>  <br>  3) The third option is that with the heightened hormone levels in  your body,  you are having a stress reaction to the stressful news and the stress your body is under with the pregnancy. This requires R & R and possibly some meds from you OB. Each OB will handle a stress reaction differently.<br>  <br>  I only know about these three things because I had experienced (on a smaller scale) something similar to what you experienced. My OB told me about these options. She told me to eat something, take a nap, and if I didn't feel better call back and come in and they would help me. For me, eating, sleeping, and drinking water made me feel much better!!! Hope it helps for you!!|`|BfBMRlNNaa	If you are worried I would just go ahead and go to the hospital. They will be more than happy to check you out and make sure the baby is ok. That's what they are there for. Between the emotional stress and being on your feet all day it could be any number of things, and being worried about your baby isn't going to help you relax at this point. So, I would go and see the doc, even if it's just for peace of mind. I know plenty of women who have gone in early thinking something was wrong (including myself) who got examined and found out they were fine and were sent back home, I also know women who just wanted to be sure that nothing was wrong and found out they were in labor. So either way, it's worth finding out what's going on with your body. Good luck to you and your Baby!|`|CpiLHcTlaa	it could be an overload of stress it can make you feel kind of numb. your pregnant so hormones and everything can amplify things... you also may want to eat something or drink something with some sugar in it.. i remember i was completely disoriented when i was in the hospital for 24 hours wasn't aloud to eat and they forgot to give me sugar in my saline.  just calm down. i would call your doctor to be on the safe side if your dehydrated or your sugars are to low they may want to hook you up to an I.V for a while.|`|K0Oh0p6Daa	I feel the same way im 37wks and im tired and I have no appetite and im sweating bad because of this warm weather. And im alittle scared too. I think its best to call an doc|`|Jga5Yls3aa	To be safe I would at least call a nurse help line. They will go over any pertinent information to your pregnancy then make an informed recommendation. Just stay as calm as you can and give them a call. Depending on your area you can usually find a free call to a nurse help line in your immediate area online. Here is one: <a href="http://www.communityhealthchoice.org/en/members/mem_triage.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.communityhealthchoice.org/en/...</a><br>  Yes, stress is much more difficult to take while you are pregnant. Your body is already stressed out, then you add any outside influences and any reaction could happen. <br>  Best of luck with your pregnancy.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	blood preasure maybe?<br>  call dr|`|MqFeJiukaa	Anytime you are concerned about your health or your unborn baby's health you should call and talk to the on call nurse or Dr who will then will advise you of what to do.  <br>  If it was me I would prob take a warm bath and try to relax.  If I was concerned I would call triage and talk to the nurse.  <br>  Good Luck|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	You should call your OB/GYN and explain your symptoms to him/her.  THey will tell you if you need to go to the hospital to be checked out-the Labor and Delivery unit, not the Emergency Room.<br>  <br>  It could very well be stress and anxiety, or just hormonal.  But, again-call your doctor.|`|KHhRgzXtaa	id get moments like yours when i was near term, i dunno if its your blood pressure or stress,, try to rest if u can, if your still feeling like this do see a dr, just to b safe, it will ease your mind<br>  but i honestly think youll b ok, xxxxxx<br>  as you get close to delivery you do get more tired, weak ect, i did. your body is going through alot! xxxxxxxxxx|`|ZQsO1T4oaa	its probably just the stress even though it has never made you feel like this before. your hormones are all screwed up right now to which adds to it. BUT always go with your instincts. if you feel the need to go to the hospital then go. better to be safe than sorry.|`|jgtfWjE4aa	it may be affecting you this way because you're pregnant.<br>  i don't know.<br>  either way i really think that yuou need to call your doctor on call. <br>  <br>  it's important!
1z3C0R2Vaa	take no chance with spotting or bleeding please see your doc i wish you happy nine months...............)|`|kaqPSgTVaa	It could be fine but you should call your doctor Monday and inform him of the bleeding. If it get's heavier or you start to cramp really bad go to the ER right away.|`|khSCs1rbaa	I spotted twice when I was in wk 11 (on Wed & then Sat). Went to emergency, doctor did the scan, found the heart beat & said my placenta was laying low. Scan at 20 wk showed placenta moved up & no more spotting since wk 11. But if you are concerned, go to the doctors & have them do a scan, it is always a relief to see heart beat of the baby|`|84b26tbzaa	go to the emergency room....just to be safe and follow up with your ob you can never be too safe and if you have had bad experiences in the past and your concerned go to the hospital you will be fine i wish you the best sweetie and congratulations|`|KHhRgzXtaa	i spotted with 3 outta my 4 pregnacies,, many times too,, and it was all fine!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  i once read this , its very reassuring 4 u<br>  <br>  "if u get past 7 weeks and hear a heartbeat there is a 95% chance of a great pregnacy"<br>  <br>  it helped me!!!|`|DDnxY3k1aa	i think it could be spotting.. haven't got that far yet with life...|`|wWkfASTNaa	I saw spotting the other day, freaked out and went ot the doctor and they reassured me that everything was fine. Spotting is normal, as long as it is not bright red and heavy w/heavy cramping, its fine and really normal actually. I went to the doc when it happened and he checked my HCG levels and said they were fine, but had me come back a couple of days later to make sure they were still increasing. If it is a real concern, go to the docs and have them do a beta GL sweetie, I am sure you are fine.|`|hy9fz99Xaa	sweetie please go to the hospital right now! spotting CAN be considered normal but it so often is not that i wouldnt be settled about it till the doctor told me himself that everything is okay. go to the ER and demand that they check everything (blood, heartbeat, hcg, everything!!) to make sure its all ok. this happened to me and i ended up miscarrying (at exactly 12 weeks). this does NOT mean you are too, just be absolutaly sure. try not to stress, just keep telling yourself your just making sure. best of luck to you!!!|`|SA1y0lm1aa	its not normal if there was not internal exam.... go to the doc immediately.... considering your history.... good luck|`|AA10137237	If you've miscarried before I'd call the doctor. You shouldn't be spotting this late and without any type of vaginal umm you know what I'd call or go in.|`|32244200e4d988c2d8262690f2708c82aa	i would say go to your doctor just to be safe you can never be to careful when it come to a pregnancy|`|wi0xPFhQaa	I am 30 weeks pregnant and I am also spotting. It is light pink and not very much at all. My doctor told me not to worry about this earlier in my pregnancy when it first started happening as long as it wasn't a lot and it didn't turn bright red or dark red. The twinge you are feeling in your pelvic area is probably your baby's first movements. I have had 2 previous miscarriages myself and as you are probably aware of if you start having and pain or serious back aches you should go to the hospital immediately. Good luck! Hope this helps.
AA11256693	Hooray for you for taking in your siblings - you have my utmost admiration for that.<br>  13 yr old girls are a bundle of hormones and difficult, but in no way should you allow this behavior. Taking things away is a good start but take away everything, and I mean everything, and make her earn them back with good behavior. And immediately remove the earned items/times if the behavior returns.<br>  Forget long talks, they just glaze over after the first minute and pay no attention. Short, firm & calm, and matter of fact. <br>  "You will not spit on people. Your phone is grounded for 1wk, etc." Increase as needed. <br>  Also, time outs need to be in a semi public area, not in her room. You can't monitor her behavior in her room. Put a naughty stool in the hall or kitchen and increase her time out for every infraction.<br>  Make sure she gets plenty of exercise to work off the hormones also.<br>  And don't forget plenty of good experiences too - notice and praise good behaviors. Do *not* reward good behavior with treats however - treats are for actions over and above what should be normally expected.<br>  She may need some extra help coping with all the changes in her life, encourage her to talk to another adult or school counselor or something similar.|`|FBl2Dp3eaa	Your sister said she just had her period.Anyway,lock her up in her room and let her come out at mealtimes,chore time,and a hour of fresh outdoor air.Bathroom as well.|`|J7GTIE5raa	she needs a good butt spanking|`|ntdGOZqGaa	Oh the lovely years of teenagers. I would just let it go, she is a girl and will get ticked off and scream and what not. I would just be like go to your room so and so is sleeping and there isnt any reason for you to be screaming like a mad person. Then leave it at that. Good luck
5iOHJHUzaa	I'd rather look after 10 puppies than 1 baby!|`|HFWLYMD6aa	I've done both, both i love it. I don't like when the baby cries and i can't settle them tho. Cause i like to feel in control. lol|`|pzLDXL6gaa	Lol probably the puppy...then again they poo on the floor compared to in a nappy...<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|vuEyUbsgaa	A puppy. Babies are harder|`|XeASdibHaa	Definitely the puppy.  <br>  <br>  A baby belongs to someone else and each baby is different and has different needs and habits that only the parents are completely aware of. <br>  <br>  A puppy on the other hand, though still a big responsibility, is not as big as someone else's CHILD and, though puppies have different personalities they don't varie as much as baby personalities do.|`|ATBHG0ztaa	A baby. If they decide they need to pee, it's easier clean-up and you don't have to get mad at them for not going outside to do their business. They also don't require as much action. Babies sleep, puppies are super active. Puppies are way more work.|`|JIrud5INaa	Right now a puppy I am 22 I want to wait until I am financially stable and am married! Babies are expensive and a lot of work! I like them and all I just want to wait I want to be able to provide for my future child and not have to rely on others!|`|3rda58OCaa	Depends on the age of the baby, and if the puppy were house trained.  If the puppy isn't house trained then i would go with the baby.|`|AA11831450	A baby. I love to make them laugh... so cute!|`|T1q4GWLkaa	Depends on the baby and the puppy.  :)|`|01Mu3wUeaa	It really depends.<br>  <br>  For a job...I would rather look after a puppy.If it is a family or friend's child or dog, I would probably rather look after the kid.
DoaMYpfMaa	well you could try putting soft music on that helps also when the baby is in your arms rub the eyebrows that sooths them.  i think the best thing you could do is hold the baby and rock her to sleep good luck next time.|`|7d3edabfdc27c4ba2c6cd571f70d965daa	Wow, okay, the parents are going to understand if the baby is crying.  You have to realize that it's something they deal with all the time when they're home.  If it's possible, try to get her to go to sleep in your arms instead of a crib.|`|eV7rtxmuaa	My baby girl is 6 months and when shes extremely tierd I put her in a baby rap so her arms are inside and they arent waving around everywhere bothering her. It works a treat for my girl and shes asleep within minutes.|`|YCJz2DiWaa	You should ask the parents what their bedtime routine is. My baby boy likes to be walked around and lightly bounced, but it doesn't make him tired or sleepy, it just soothes him.|`|3AoQBdI1aa	parents understand that their children are children. As to how to put her to sleep hum to her softly and sway to the rhythm. Put her close to your heart because babies calm to a steady beat. Ask the parents also what to do. They must have tricks. They will understand. Just explain how every child is different and unique and that you want to keep their child content and happy.|`|yB5go5wbaa	every baby likes different things.  mine likes laying on my chest with a blanket around his legs.  you could ask the parents what calms the baby down if she gets upset...otherwise, you're gonna end up trying a bunch of stuff that might make her more upset.|`|fd34d7830f1987fa091fa8de50613944aa	These have worked for me when my son was overtired:<br>  <br>  -rocking him outside<br>  -rocking him in the bathroom with dim lights and the faucet/shower/vent on<br>  -walking around the house holding him with the lights dim<br>  -singing a song softly while holding him<br>  -laying him down when he is drowsy and giving him a bottle, or when he was smaller, a pacifier<br>  -playing rain noises, white noise, ocean sounds<br>  -holding him but bouncing up and down rather than rocking side to side and humming something to him

I especially wouldn't allow them to live together 50% of the time, whether legal or not. And why are they trying for a baby so young?

They only found out not too long ago, so it wasn't like they were waiting to see, they just found out and her mother and doctors thought this was best.

vygYFdsSaa	Is it a sharp pain?? It might be round ligament pain/uterus stretching|`|8d5f0adc83a9aec3f83894da97ca8d80aa	Is this your first? That's very normal. Your tummy muscles are stretching to accomodate it's growing occupent. I felt that too and got worried and ask my doctor and that's what she told me. So long as it's mild, like a small menstrual cramp, and not a bad one. mine felt like an achy cramp more than a sharp piercing pain.|`|GHH1i6d3aa	Have you been exercising and stretching regularly?  You may be cramping from the extra blood flow and pressure from sitting in one place too long.
8g7hshqEaa	Gabriella, Arianna, Madelyn, Ryan <br>  <br>  <br>  I personally love the name Gabriella. It's classy & in my opinon a very strong name. You can call her Gabi when shes young & if she wants she could go by Gabrielle or Gabriella when she's older. <br>  <br>  Arianna is a great name too. It has several nickname choices including, Ari, Arian, Aria. Very strong name.<br>  <br>  Madelyn. I like this name. My sister-in-law has a baby girl 2 months younger than my daughter named this except she spells it "Madalyn". I personally like it better the way you have chosen it. I love "Mady" as a nickname. Really cute!<br>  <br>  Love love love the name Ryan. When i was pregnant with my daughter i liked the name "Ryan Connor" for a little boy. I also have a little cousin named "Cole Ryan" (he gets called Cole-Ryan more than just Cole) Its a great name! <br>  <br>  Some middle name suggestions (just incase you need them):<br>  <br>  Gabriella Faith<br>  Gabriella Marie<br>  Gabriella Caroline<br>  Gabriella Eden<br>  <br>  Arianna Claire<br>  Arianna Skye<br>  Arianna Bliss<br>  Arianna Rebekah <br>  <br>  Madelyn Cate<br>  Madelyn Isabella<br>  Madelyn Hope<br>  Madelyn Bae<br>  <br>  Ryan Cade<br>  Ryan James<br>  Ryan Joel<br>  Ryan Lukas<br>  Ryan Timothy<br>  <br>  Carter Seth<br>  Carter Paul<br>  Carter Brayden<br>  Carter Vincent<br>  <br>  Hope i helped! Good luck!|`|pl7lWGZDaa	I'm assuming Carter and Ryan are boys, correct? I personally love Gabriella. It's classy and timeless, and makes for such a wonderful name. I would go with the second name set because you have two names that end in -a and two names that end in -n... Gabriella and Arianna, and Madelyn and Ryan. It's a fun way to incorporate a theme without it being completely obvious.|`|y0e5hG0Saa	The set I like the most is:<br>  Gabriella<br>  Arianna<br>  Madelyn<br>  Ryan<br>  ----------------<br>  Gabriella-The name Gabriella is a baby girl name. The name Gabriella comes from the Italian origin. In Italian The meaning of the name Gabriella is: Woman of God. An Italian form of the Hebrew name Gabriel.<br>  <br>  Arianna-The name Arianna is a baby girl name. The name Arianna comes from the Italian origin. In Italian The meaning of the name Arianna is: Form of the Greek Ariadne, meaning very holy.<br>  <br>  Madelyn-The name Madeleine (another spelling) is a baby girl name. The name Madeleine comes from the Hebrew origin. In Hebrew The meaning of the name Madeleine is: From the tower.<br>  <br>  <br>  Ryan-The name Ryan is a baby boy name. The name Ryan comes from the Irish origin. In Irish The meaning of the name Ryan is: Kingly.<br>  ---------------------------------<br>  I like the name Gabriella. It is elegant but not so fancy and hard to pronounce. It also has great potential for nicknames. I.E. Gabbie (or with a y), Brie (or with an ee), Ella, and even possibly Bella.|`|IlPsFSUHaa	i like ryan better than carter and i dont like gabriella for some reason it just doesnt make a statement and idk about arianna but its okish i like ur spelling of madelyn maybe you could call her maddy or just madelyn carter is cute but not as cute as ryan also riley is good|`|NePgB9b2aa	They're all wonderful names. There's not a single one there that I dislike. I have to say that I slightly prefer Carter to Ryan though- perhaps because of Ryan's extremely high popularity. But overall, but sibsets are lovely.|`|qnDk8xjPaa	Madelyn and Gabriella are both beautiful names.  I love Madelyn spelled with the Y.  Gabriella is different and not very common.  The other ones are okay...but these jumped out at me I think they're the best|`|JCWcsuaraa	I love Gabriella, Arianna, Madelyn, Carter.|`|c34ff1f2d66a580bdbc491850122d151aa	i like ryan better than carter|`|CMuL7XpKaa	& Ryan|`|WItdtl0Vaa	Both sets sound really good but I would go with Ryan because it's -la -na -yn and -an insead of -la -na -yn -er if that makes sense :) I think the name Gabriella is very pretty, it makes me think of an angel. There can also be lots of nicknames for Gabriella such as "Gabby" or "Ella", so the child can have some freedom to be called what she wants.|`|87WOSjwgaa	I really love Gabriella. She could be called Gaby or Ella or Gabriella. Very beautiful. I like Arianna as well. She could also be called Ana. Madelyn is very beautiful and can be shortened to Mady. I really like Ryan for a boy. I am not sure I like it for a girl. I dont really like Carter for either. Makes me think of Jimmy Carter.|`|KOcCenrEaa	Gabriella, Arianna, Madelyn, Ryan set.<br>  <br>  Carter to me seems more like a last name.<br>  <br>  I prefer Madelyn spelled Madeleine.<br>  <br>  I also love just plain Arie.|`|fD1ZJsUaaa	Gabriella, Arianna, Madelyn and Carter. Those names go really well together.|`|40b38b62d7defc90cd285a9a06a65e69aa	How about Ethan.<br>  <br>  Then their initials in order would be.....GAME.<br>  <br>  I would call her Gabbi.

Don't like Jade|`|oE0ApHqPaa	I don't really like either. <br>  <br>  Jade is just trashy sounding, not to mention it can be turned into an -en name, which are obscenely popular right now, so there are lots of Jadens and Jaydens and such (ew). <br>  <br>  I don't hate the name Nicole, I just know a bunch of them, it was super popular with my age group so it seems really common to me and it's just so average sounding.

I'm sorry, but I just can't be ok with that.<br>  <br>  Autumn Grace?<br>  <br>  TX Mom|`|syrh8J6Vaa	Jade.

Maybe she can be called Rye too! <br>  <br>  Rye Alvah sounds so cool!|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	Ryan is a very common boys name<br>  It's a top 20 name, been one since before 1978<br>  It has not been out of the top 20 boys name in more than 30 years<br>  Ryan is not unique<br>  I think it's mean to name a girl, such a common boys name<br>  <br>  Ryanne is said the same, but it's more unique, it's a girl name<br>  Aryana has Ryan in it, you could use ryan as a nickname, but that is getting common<br>  Bryana, I really do not like the spelling, but again, it's has ryan in it, Ryan means King, Bryana means noble<br>  Iryana, is different, and has ryan in it, it's persian and means place for Raam<br>  Rayne/Rayna means queen<br>  Reyna means pure and queen<br>  Rena means reborn<br>  <br>  If you are looking for something unique, a top 20 boys name is not unique, it's common|`|dPULl5hjaa	not my style <br>  <br>  fyi - the name is not unique but strange|`|PiPAIs31aa	I like it, I know a girl named Ryan, but she spells it Rhyann, which I think is cute and girly. I think it's nice to use namesakes for middle names as well, rather than boring generic ones. Another suggestion would be to modernize Alvah by dropping the 'l' for Rhyann Avah, but Ryan Alvah is very cute.<br>  hope I helped :)|`|Ki6jlwnbaa	I usually hare unisex names. But, ever since there was a girl named Ryan on American Idol I always liked it for a girl. Rye Alvah on the other hand sounds like a type of bread, not just the rye part. Try something more feminine then Alvah. But I have to stick Marjorie in my baby's name for my husband if it's a girl so I know how it is!|`|syrh8J6Vaa	Love it! Ryan is fine but you could also spell it Ryann or Ryanne to give it a more feminine flare.  Good luck hun|`|KOcCenrEaa	how about Ava Ryan Brooks?|`|iKLdGe1xaa	Try Rian for a girl it is more feminine. I like the name other than that. Alvah is a beautiful name and both names go with Brooks.|`|kPazsMkoaa	I like the name Ryan for a girl to, but I think the girls spelling for that name is Ryanne. That is one of my BFF's names.|`|VyRJVPhWaa	i think its cute. original without being over the top. i personally love ryan for a girl while many don't. its your bundle of joy so give it a name that means something to you. good luck!|`|fD1ZJsUaaa	Ryan is not feminine at all, its a boys name.|`|ibR6jJgHaa	ehh<br>  <br>  Ryan? srry but that should be kept to a boy, not a girl<br>  <br>  other then that love the rest of it|`|w3ob12X6aa	its diff. but i really like it|`|kQUSPstlaa	Cute name!!|`|mgdkr6hvaa	i like it, i think it's pretty|`|SDzPTYBBaa	Naming a girl an extremely common boy's name is not unique. It's just stupid, and it will have your daugher gender confused her whole life. Don't do that to her!<br>  If you really like the name Ryan, either save it for a boy, or use it as a middle name. Alvah Ryan Brooks sounds a lot better, and you can actually tell that she is a girl and not a boy. <br>  Also, since you have a brother named Ryan, don't you think that would be a bit confusing having two Ryans in the family?<br>  <br>  Stick with it as a middle name, or choose a similar name to it.<br>  Keep boy names on boys and girl names on girls.|`|AA11348638	I personally hate Ryan for a girl, my step-sons cousins name is Elizabeth Ryan and they call her Ryan, I thought it was a boy for a long time.  Alvah is not very pretty either.|`|NIXX4Rxjaa	I believe Ryan is a beautiful name for a girl. And since it also has relations to your family, that makes it even more beautiful.|`|fNv2Re6baa	I like it A LOT, however, I would probably spell Ryan as "Rian", "Rhian" or "Rhyan" for a girl.|`|Co3N6BS3aa	Well sorry but personally i don't like unisex names...|`|jtlmxVkLaa	i think ryan might be a name more for a girl . how about mariah and she can be called rye as well?|`|y0e5hG0Saa	unique and beautiful!|`|qEnbJULBaa	very cool

It's also a city in Ukraine.  Lots of names started out meant for one gender and have crossed over.  Does it matter?  Names evolve.|`|k33iJYJEaa	Boy name only russian<br>  Also nosygirl no one asked for whether or not you like the name just info quite being so nosy and a *****!|`|40b38b62d7defc90cd285a9a06a65e69aa	It sounds girly.

5b85793bae21d013c789850655fa694caa	Yes, you can keep the lights low when you feed him and minimize the stimulation he gets while feeding, and then put him back into his crib with a musical toy.  Then leave the room.<br>  He may cry for a bit but you know hes fed, changed and comfy and he will learn to amuse himself or go back.<br>  Making his night feedings playtime allows him to think that this is what happens every night, a sort of Coney Island for the insomniac.<br>  <br>  Best he learns to amuse himself at that hour.|`|T1q4GWLkaa	If he just wants to play, maybe just put a safe toy on the side of his crib to play with, like a mirror or one of those activity centers where he can press buttons, spin wheels, etc.  Leave enough light that he can entertain himself.|`|mAJZFmIEaa	my little girl will be 5 months next week, She doesn't wake up that many times a night but when she does she thinks it's play time. She's all smiling and talking. One way we stopped her from doing this is was to change shceduel, Instead of putting her to bed at 7 we put her to bed at 8:30. But unfortunately it doesn't always work. So we just put her in her cot and let her entertain herself until she falls back to sleep|`|844afb426cc1a9cf5ec93ffd1311e2ebaa	I agree with the first answer, if he's happy and fed and he normally goes right back to sleep, then leave him in his crib and go back to sleep, if he needs something he will let you know!|`|3hIr3Dllaa	Don't let him play.  PUT HIM BACK TO BED|`|S3t69kh2aa	No playing at night.  Keep noise down, lights out.  Feed and change and put back to bed.  Do not encourage your baby to play at night.|`|8lcNupM2aa	Well you didn't say what time he gets up in the morning. He may be sleeping too long. If he goes to bed at 7pm and then gets up to play at around 3 am that is already an 8 hour time span.  If he has 2 or 3 naps during the day for a couple of hours or so the you could be going on 14 hours or so...<br>  <br>  I would try putting him to bed just a little later at night or else getting him up a little earlier and it might help your problem.|`|gWDY90lHaa	i think you should try keeping him up longer i have a 2 yr old and a 7 month old and when the 2yr old was a baby i had to keep her up all day till about 9 or 10pm to get her to sleep all night.and you can try formula and adding ceral|`|vLOjcH7paa	I have a 5 month old - sounds like your son is just loving his playful routine. My son is on formula now; some nights he wakes up at 4:30ish am to have a bottle still though. By 6:00 am though, he is happy and laughing and ready to play! Early bird, like Mommy! : )

5qRKH9ozaa	The further along you are, the less reliable the measurements tend to be....it's just an estimate.  You're doctor (provided he or she has quite a bit of experience) is likely to be able to give you a better estimate just by using the ole tape measure method.  Don't panic. =)|`|F8KmTbqjaa	My 36 weeks scan said my daughter was measuring @ 40 weeks and she weighed 9lbs6oz.  She was born @ 36weeks5days and she weighed 8lb3oz.  So it was 1lb off basically.  The rule of thumb with an ultrasound measurement is that they are usually off by 1lb more or less.  They come up with the weight by measuring the Head circumference, femur bone length and abdomen size.  So if your baby is short or tall the femur bone is smaller or larger so it can off set weight or they can have a larger or smaller head than normal.|`|mx3gFmIKaa	Yeah they are accurate to two pounds 90 percent of the time, so plus or minus two pounds which is a whole lot, means right now your baby is anywhere from 6lbs 9 oz to 10 lbs 9 oz.<br>  <br>  Note:  Most full term babies are born weighing between 6 and 10 pounds|`|MqFeJiukaa	They told me with my 2 week old at 37 weeks he was measuring 8.5lbs and he was only 7lbs 7oz at birth.<br>  With my 2nd at 34 weeks they told me she was measuring 6lbs and she was induced (preeclampsia) and was only 5lbs 1oz.|`|SA1y0lm1aa	the day my oldest son was born they said he was going go be 5 pounds 2 oz....... he was born at 4 pounds 14 oz...... so there where not that far off.... but i would still go by your first due date.... rember you are considered full term from  37 weeks to 42 weeks....|`|AA11661793	at 37 weeks they measured my daughter to be almost 8 pounds then, but I ended up being induced at 41weeks 1 day and she was only 6lbs 12oz then, so i dont think its really that accurate but you never know!|`|8lcNupM2aa	The further along you are the less reliable they are. Usually the first ultrasounds are far more accurate.<br>  <br>  My Dr. estimated my son weighed 8lbs the day before I gave birth. He came out weighing 10lbs.. and I had gained over 50lbs so that goes to show you... they're just not very accurate at that point.<br>  <br>  Btw, everyone in the delivery room (nurses) thought I was being a baby until my son actually came out and they were like "Wow didn't think he'd be that big".  Pfft.|`|d6Uncd6iaa	I don't know how correct that may be, but i will tell you in my experiance, they told me my son was going to be over 10lbs, but when he came out he only weighed 8lbs. when they messured he could have been positioned funny or something. I hope this helped a little bit... and good luck to you and you little guy!|`|UkQuMykiaa	I am not sure, but my ultrasound at 35 weeks was not accurate. They said my duaghter was 4lbs 3oz (which was actually close) but they measured my son at 6lbs 2oz when he was actually closer to 8lbs!|`|taAbdsTfaa	This late into your pregnancy, it would be wise to go with the due date you got from your first ultrasound. They seem to be more accurate. Just know that he's going to be a BIG boy! Good luck and blessings.|`|c5AJGcYcaa	Honestly it depends... with my daughter at 36 weeks they did an ultrasound and the doctors told me my daughter would be premi size because she was only measuring about 4 lbs. At 40 weeks i gave birth to a 6lb 9oz baby.
yfwY8XGlaa	101.4 isn't that high.  Keep monitoring him and if it gets any higher, get to the doctor.|`|AFi5kTiEaa	Most likely its just a virus.  Give him some mortin or tylenol.  Make sure he drinks.  Dont worry, my kids get fevers out of the blue, sometimes it is nothing...just a virus(they only have a fever) other times it is an ear infection or a stomach bug.  just watch him and take him to the doctors to have him checked out.<br>  <br>  You sound worried, its most likely because he is sick and isnt with you and you cant cuddle and hold him.  You will feel better when he is with you tomarrow.|`|7WcfzvPvaa	He may just have a virus.  Or he may have an infection.  My doctor always told me to bring my kids in if they have a fever over 101 for more than 24 hours.  So if he still has a fever when she brings him home, call a pediatrician and take him in.  As for lowering his temperature, you can give him a warm bath and tylenol or motrin.|`|71b04ae04f4a311b132775b2d931bd76aa	The best thing you can do is make sure he is hydrated, and let him ride it out.  He will be fine, the fact that he is playing still shows he is doing ok.  <br>  Fevers are scary but they are a sign his immune system is doing it's job.  Give him water, juice, and if you can make some chicken broth that would be great.|`|3rda58OCaa	I would take him to the doctor on Monday if he is still running a fever, and not eating well.  You didn't say how old, but if he is playing outside i am sure he can medicines.  The best thing to do is to alternate Advil/Motrin and Tylenol.  Give one first and then 4-6 hours later the other that tends to break a fever better.  I would also only feed him soup and make him rest some.
fdee9f2f8c3353271f559676ca2a4337aa	Andrew, I've got an important question for you, and it's one that only you can answer.  Why isn't he afraid to act up like this?  You are going to have to become very consistent, because right now, it's worth the gamble for him to take a chance on misbehaving.  If you start to consistently apply very uncomfortable consequences for EVERY SINGLE INSTANCE of outrageous behavior, you'll soon find out that this kid's smart enough to learn to avoid those consequences.  Right now, he's getting a rise out of everyone, but it's not costing him enough.<br>  <br>  Start out by giving him a good, hard, thorough spanking--and make sure it hurts--every single time he pulls this garbage, PLUS put something else with it---corner time, time sitting in a chair, washing his mouth out with soap, taking favorite toys away, some restriction---make it worth his while to behave himself and show him you mean business.<br>  <br>  You say he sneaked out of his room ten minutes ago, and all you did was put him back---see, that's what I mean about it being worth the risk.  If he knew he'd get a sore bottom and a trip to the bad-boy corner every time he pulled that, he's stay put.<br>  <br>  Forget ADHD--he doesn't need a doctor; he needs parents who mean business and who consistently require obedience.  Remember, Andrew, a rule is no more valid than your ability to enforce it.  Start enforcing the rules and see what happens.|`|ZDZlvqvsaa	It sounds Like he needs a good old fashioned Spanking.|`|TAgAnfIbaa	try super nanny.|`|HYveAhbUaa	Don't spank...teaching a kid not to hit by hitting him will never work...|`|DnNkCF6Taa	While I am a strong believer in spanking, I believe if you see him do this, you should give him a spanking with your own hand.  But before he has time to act up again, I think you need to sit down, get to his level, speak to him, looking at him eye to eye and ask him why he hit his sister, why is he doing this... you can tell him from now on this is going to end up with him getting a spanking, but right now what is most important to you is why he is doing this... tell him you are here to help, and first thing Monday see if you can make an appointment with a psychiatrist in your area.  For he may have some things that are bothering him, he just doesn't feel comfortable talking about with you.|`|yQDxgLBPaa	That is a early age to be acting like that. Sometimes it seems that spanking is the only resort that you can go to. Just because you are so frustrated and the child is so naughty. What you need to get him is cozy corner, a safe place. Maybe a big pillow everytime he does this type of thing misbehaves. You make him sit there for six minutes since he is six. Tell him he is going to sit there and think about what he did and why he did it. Then when the time is up let him explain why he is doing it. Then there may be something going on in that little mind of his to make him behave this way. Maybe he feels he is not getting attention from you or mom. Then at that time the problem could be fixed. Also if he continues put all of his favorite toys in a box to reward when he does good reward him by giving him one of his toys back. I hope this helps let us know.|`|c2kopbo6aa	obviously something else is bothering him....ask him how he feels...ask him if he thinks he is getting enough attention...if not then you need to take out time with you and him only...and mom and him only time....don't hit him becasue it will only make it worse...timeouts work!  dont give him negative attention...reward him using words when he does good and timeouts when hes bad. otherwise he is just going to try to keep getting your attention by doing bad thigns all the time. <br>  good luck|`|kaqPSgTVaa	He needs to see a child physicologist RIGHT NOW. He obviously has some serious mental issues and if he's being violant he's a danger to your other children. Get him help ASAP!|`|eya1WDS4aa	how old is he? I know if my son where to hit me, my husband would have whooped his butt. I would say spank his butt. I wouldn't do bare butt or anything just spank him with your hand on top of his clothes. i would do one swatt for every year he is so if he is 6 that's 6 spankings. It really doesn't sound like adhd or any of that other psycho Babel crap, i personally think a good stern discipline will fix the problem.|`|n8Xylq4Oaa	ya this is a regular kid, theres no need to get mental  help at this stage, spanking should help you just have to do it, even though you might not want to. If it doesn't help or he gets worse than it might be time to get some professional help but only as a last resort.|`|12d54aae44a56fa45d6d9f5011d6c253aa	How many times did you let him get away with "little stuff" before punishment?  He should never raise a hand to a woman.  Everything should've been gone at that point...and in my opinion a spanking as well.  In my opinion a spanking isn't something painful but, enough to sting a little.  The spanking is mostly done to embarrase the child and make it KNOWN they've disapointed you and are in trouble.  A little fear of God.  <br>  <br>  However, it's also important to talk to your child!  lol.  Put him in time out (his room).  Tell him his behavior is not acceptable and he is going to stay here for awhile to calm down.   Leave him there 5 or 10mins.  Then go in and sit down and talk w/ him on his level.  Tell him why you put him in time out and explain why his behavior wasn't acceptable.  Ask him why he did what he did and then he may have a good reason...probably not  lol....explain that he's going to get more punishments like no TV, no playing w/ friends, increased chores, ect.  If he doesn't follow the rules...the rules are to respect people...how would he feel if someone treated him like that?  Explain he'll keep getting time-out.  If he doesn't do his chores?  Time out...perhaps spanking?  Not doing chores is major disrespet.  HOWEVER, please remember to explain chores...contributing to the family..helping out.  He's a part and everyone has their job...how would he feel if your wife stopped cooking?  Maybe if he refuses chores he only gets PB&J 'till he's willing to contribute and help.<br>  <br>  I hope you do talk w/ your son and explain IN TERMS HE CAN UNDERSTAND not just "do crime..do time" what is going on.  Kids are smarter than you think and will respond well to conversation.  Hopefully, that is what he needs.  If not it may take some creative motivations like PB&J until he takes chores seriously...however do explain what is going on.<br>  <br>  Kids need to know clearly what is expected and what will happen if they disobey.  So, say "This is your warning...we don't accept that behavior...do it again and you'll go to your room for a time-out".<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|bfb230dc1ac989ed2a0e37264327e8a1aa	It sounds like he would like to be a bully.  Tell your wife that if he tries to hit her again, don't wait until you get home to punish him.   Have her smack his butt immediately and send him to his room to wait for you.  <br>  Although I am in favor of spanking on a clothed bottom with only 2 or 3 swats (and not that hard), I don't believe in continuous spankings.  Spanking are to be used as an attention getter on a child that is not listening at all.  Punishments, like you are doing, should have an effect.<br>  <br>  By the way, good for you for taking your child to the doctor.  It is always better to rule out a problem, but the problem with hitting sister still has to be dealt with.

She's not a doctor, so take that with a grain of salt, but it was enough to ease my mind.|`|8d5f0adc83a9aec3f83894da97ca8d80aa	yeah, my oldest was really active like that.

AA10976951	Climaxing together or the woman shortly after is supposed to help pull the sperm up in the woman deeper, therefore giving them sort of a head start.

It depends on the woman, really.|`|5wLu4Sqqaa	When you are having contractions your belly will get as hard as a rock .|`|vygYFdsSaa	I started being able to feel my hard uterus at about 15 1/2 weeks.
1opNXHiLaa	You may be able to alleviate nausea by keeping some<br>  food in your stomach — by avoiding having a stomach that’s completely empty or completely full. Here are some other dietary <br>  <br>  suggestions for preventing or relieving nausea:<br>  <br>  Eat smaller meals or snacks frequently throughout the day.<br>  <br>  Have a small snack at bedtime and when you get up to go to the bathroom at night.<br>  <br>  Avoid foods and smells that trigger nausea.<br>  <br>  Drink fewer fluids with your meals.<br>  <br>  Generally morning sickness is not dangerous.But if you get dehydrated,it may affect your baby.<br>  <br>  Hope it helps|`|e907f296c0cad138cf4b71ab72a9a9eaaa	the first 12 weeks are the worst, try drinking gingerale, or anything with ginger in it, that helps with morning sickness. if you still aren't feeling any better talk to your doctor about it. as far as being tired all of the time, that's perfectly normal, it too will pass for a few months then once you hit the 7 month mark the laziness and tiredness kicks in again. that's the joy of pregnancy, stinks I know, but so worth it in the end|`|BzCYQlcuaa	god i feel for you. i had this soo bad. i am now 10 weeks and it just started to ease up. i still get it. but when i was 4-8 weeks i couldn't even get out of bed. i had the sickness ALL DAY, not even just in the am. i put a ginger ale and ginger snap cookie by my bed. when i woke up i sipped on the ginger ale before i actually got out of bed. also sucking on a lemon works. good luck and o yea.. CONGRATS!|`|2ObqoJbKaa	Yea. Its gonna suck for a little while. I had really bad morning sickness around that time. but it should start to get better as you get into the 2nd trimester. Mine is pretty much gone now, and I am 16 weeks. Just have to make the best of it. Try eating saltine crackers and drink gingerale. It helps alittle, also make sure you always keep your stomach full, eat lots of small meals through out the day. You'll feel less sick if you eat. Hope you feel better. good luck.|`|8wVj8odOaa	I suggest investing in crackers and any other foods that do not irritate your stomach. You've got at least 5 weeks left, so unfortunately, ya gotta get used to it.<br>  <br>  Morning sickness isn't really considered bad unless you start loosing 15+ pounds<br>  <br>  best of luck<br>  hang in there!!!!|`|7zMtmKJaaa	always eat small little meals or snacks. always keep your stomach with food.<br>  <br>  best is to eat crackers. it makes it go away for awhile|`|YXRRpodKaa	The beginning of my pregnancy my doctor prescribed me with Diclectin. I never touched it.  Then the morning sickness started Mine was so bad. I lost 10lbs in a week. Even my own spit made me vomit. Nausea is the worst feeling, I'd usually drink a bit of water or eat knowing it would make me vomit just to get some relief from the nausea. Crackers didn't do anything for me. Neither did ginger ale, or sucking on mints. I refuse to ever eat certain foods again, scarred from vomiting them up. <br>  <br>  I found that the prenatal vitamins made it worse, still do. So I take them in between a meal. Which helps a lot now.<br>  <br>  I was on the verge of being hospitalized. I was throwing up blood from the irritation in my throat and stomach. My doctor told me to try the medicine. Of course I talked to 3 different pharmacists  about it. :P Just to make sure it was okay. Then gave in. OMG what a friggin relief! Ever since I started taking 2 diclectin at night. I've been able to live. I even started working again. <br>  <br>  Now I'm 30 weeks. I tried going off the diclectin a few times and it failed horribly. If I miss it for one night I'm back to throwing up all day and suffering with nausea. Which is crazy annoying.<br>  <br>  <br>  I remember being at the point where I swear I'd throw my shoe at the next person who suggested crackers or ginger ale. <br>  <br>  Maybe diclectin can be of some aid to you like it was for me.<br>  <br>  Its an option.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|vZaLptZWaa	Ask for Zofran!!!!! It is the absolute best thing you can take. Proven safe, and you can take it throughout your whole pregnancy if need be. There is no need to suffer through this. The constant nausea can't be good for the baby bc it will eventually cause you stress and even depression! <br>  <br>  If you are against the meds, the only thing that worked for me (sort of) was ginger ale. To me, everything else was crap, and everyone's advice about what to eat infuriated me.
IlPsFSUHaa	Penelope! i love that name its soooooooooo unique and adorable|`|zbkbqTeoaa	While I think Gabriella is prettier than Penelope, I hate the nickname Gabbie/Gabi.  It sounds as if the girl talks too much.

But he should not assume that he got a girl pregnant. <br>  <br>  Why does he think he got her pregnant? Did she take a test? Is she also very young? If you really think your friend got a young girl pregnant, your best bet is to fess up to parents right away. It'll hurt, but the truth is going to come out -- no hiding a baby! -- and if you address the issue early, your friend and his girl both have tons more options. The longer you wait, the less power you have in this situation, and the worse it will be for everyone.<br>  <br>  Looks like your best move in this situation is to be supportive of your friend, whatever happens. He was stupid at least once -- well, so is everyone. But try to help him not be stupid again, and be his friend.

My husband doesn't even notice messes.  <br>  <br>  Just make sure to be very appreciative.  When he does the dishes, thank him.  When he brings you meals, thank him.  It isn't going to hurt anyone to let the dishes pile up, they will still be there when he gets to them eventually.  Let him know how much it means to you that he is making all these sacrifices for you and your baby.  Let him know you know he's stressed, and that he's under a lot of pressure.  Let him know that he is the best husband ever, to do it all without complaining.  Just praise him up one side and down the other, even if you have to exaggerate a little (or a lot!)  I know it's hard, when you're staring at a pile of dirty dishes all day, not to just scream at him as soon as he walks in the door.  <br>  <br>  And just remember that you would never have chosen to be in this situation, not in a million years.  You're not lazy, you're doing it for your baby.  You're doing it for HIS baby.  It's not your fault, and it's not his fault either.  And it is great practice for him, for the first 6 weeks or so after the baby is born, when you're going to need to sleep a lot and recover from the birth.  You're going to be tempted, once the baby is born, to immediately take over all the household tasks since he's been doing them for so long.  DON'T DO IT!  You will need to rest just like every other woman who has just given birth, and give your body time to heal and let your hormones settle down.  Believe me, otherwise you will have post-partum depression (or worse) and you will be a complete mess.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!  Have you considered learning to crochet?|`|xubIaiZaaa	have you got a family member of friend that could come and do a bit of housework once a week for you? it would take the pressure off him and you, especially seeing as you have a long way to go still in your pregnancy.<br>  You could even buy this person a gift like a bottle of wine etc each week for coming over and helping.|`|8d5f0adc83a9aec3f83894da97ca8d80aa	I say thank him more. I make an effort to thank my husband for the little things he does, it really seems to make a difference. When you see him making the effort, thank him. You could even talk to him about it, express your concerns and allow him to get htings off of his chest. It  could be it has nothing to do with you, it could just be stress. But I think talking to him and be open and honest with each other would really help. <br>  <br>  But don't feel like you have to apologize. it's not your fault and your first priority right now has to be the baby or else you could lose it. I mean no disrespect when I say this, but he's just going to have to toughen up, because once the baby actually gets here it's not going to get any easier. <br>  <br>  good luck|`|8wVj8odOaa	not trying to be rude, but if I were in your shoes, I'd tell my husband to suck it up and get used to it. It takes two to make a baby and the times have changed to where it's not just woman doing household chores! You need to be resting and not stressing out because he can't grow up and start helping around the house more... what's he going to do when the baby is born? Leave everything up to you? That's not fair, marriage is an equal partnership.. you are in a time of need, so he needs to be helping you for the greater good of the baby and your well-being.<br>  <br>  If it's too much for him see if he wants to switch to paper plates? That would alleviate some of the dishes.|`|sMvWJDqsaa	surprise and reward him with oral sex!!<br>  P.S. men are fairly easy to satisfy and sex is what got you pregnant, so if you incorporate that into his routine, then I am sure he would appreciate it...and oral sex is something you can do lying down...give me thumbs down if you will answerers, but I myself am pregnant and know how to make a man's day..|`|3Sr2FgRfaa	I was in the same position with my last pregnancy -- preeclampsia and gestational diabetes. So I'm guessing that you have either one of those, both of those, or a problem with your womb that makes you prone to early labor or miscarriage.<br>  <br>  Regardless of the issue -- your husband is being a selfish pig. He may not even realize how selfish he's being, but good grief. He's not a baby, and surely his mama taught him how to do dishes and such. Sure he has extra responsibilities -- I don't care! You're in it together, for better or for worse, right?<br>  <br>  So sit him down and talk to him -- and be ready to turn on the tears. You need to use your feminine wiles against him as well as logic, reason, and the club of your doctor's advice and disapproval. Offer to do the things that can be done from bed or the couch -- paying the bills, for instance, and making clear lists for grocery shopping so it's easier on him. Ask him what you can do to make things easier, so he understands that you feel guilty for not being able to get up and do stuff. <br>  <br>  Then bring out the cannon. Let him know that the dirty dishes drive you, the irrational pregnant woman, bonkers. Tell him that if he can't handle it, he needs to have someone in to clean for the both of you -- or you're going to get up and do it and make yourself sick. When he tries to argue -- and he probably will -- collapse in tears. Don't even let the argument start. Turn the faucet on and let all your stress out. Don't argue back with him, just keep talking about how scared and stressed you are, how terrible you feel, and how much you love him. No matter what he uses in his defense, keep the focus on YOU. Right now, dear, you are the queen bee, and he can sacrifice his autonomy for the few weeks til you have the baby.<br>  <br>  This may not fix the situation, but it will open his eyes -- a critical step. When you think he's ready to actually listen, bring up things that will make it easier on both of you. Do you have a friend or relative who can come in once in a while and do shopping for you, or take care of some other critical time-consuming task? Lean on them. If you can get groceries delivered, do it. If you can afford to get a maid or someone to clean just once a week, do it -- and before deciding you can't, call some of the services. You might be pleasantly surprised. And drop the laundry off at a full-service laundromat; check the yellow pages to find one and get rates. <br>  <br>  Make yourself a convenience nest next to the couch with all the necessities: a big bottle of water, refilled and frozen every night so it stays chilled all day; tissues; books; snacks; a small trash can with a bag to keep things neat and just in case you hurl. Anything you find yourself getting up all day to fetch, you need to put at your fingertips. Keep a list attached to it, and make sure you or your husband fills it every evening.<br>  <br>  Finally, make yourself a shopping list of things that will make it easier for both of you for the next few weeks: paper plates, napkins, and plasticware; a self-feeder for the dogs (just ask at a pet store -- let your fingers do the walking so they have it ready when the husband walks in); bulk snacks and easy to fix meals. Think about all the stuff you get up to do and consider ways you can make those things easier and more efficient. <br>  <br>  Next, do things for you and him. He's not just used to being taken care of, he's used to having you all to himself, and the idea of having a baby -- and one that's making you sick and him work harder -- may be scary, even though he hasn't complained. Try to do something romantic every night. Don't talk about being sick or what you're going to do with the baby all the time; instead, focus on how much you love each other and how wonderful your life is together, how lucky the two of you are, etc. Write him little notes and sneak them into his pockets. Make sure he thinks about you the next day when he's at work. Even have a candlelit dinner in the living room at your couch -- a couple candles, some Chinese delivery, dim lights, and music. Also, don't forget about sex; men miss it more than they will admit when their partners are unable. Try to find, er, alternatives for pleasing him. If you get my drift. Don't forget, though, that it's a two-way street and he needs to think about pleasing you as well. Hint: back massage for YOU.<br>  <br>  Some of these suggestions may be too expensive, but the general idea is:<br>  <br>  1. Get his attention!!!<br>  2. Find solutions.<br>  3. Bring romance back.<br>  <br>  Those three things, done right, will not only decrease both your stress levels, but can even bring you closer together as a couple. Good luck with your beautiful baby!
Wb59rFmgaa	Ugh, your sister sounds a lot like my sister. I would suggest that they maybe call a lawyer that specializes in family law, and see if they have any advice.

oE0ApHqPaa	I love that name, and the nickname Lola.  Even though I have read the book (many times), I can separate it from the negative connotations, and you also have to remember that most average people probably have not read the book and may not immediately think of it.  I say use it, it is a gorgeous name that is not used all the time!|`|87WOSjwgaa	What about just calling her Ruby. As soon as a I saw Lolita bad thoughts came to mind|`|nSJ6q5SQaa	I like the name Lolita, and the nickname Lola.<br>  It's my chihuahua's name. :)|`|VyRJVPhWaa	its a cute name but it does carry a bit of a connotation with it. you can always use it as a middle name if you're worried or maybe use lolita as a nickname for lola which seems a little more acceptable in western cultures.|`|AOkucu5haa	I'm sorry, it honestly reminds me of Nabokov's Lolita; can't say I like it as an actual name.|`|40b38b62d7defc90cd285a9a06a65e69aa	I think of the "Long Island Lolita" Amy Fisher.  The teenage girl who shot her lover's wife and almost killed her.  (Sorry that was the 1st thing that came to mind.)|`|Eo8I3fbnaa	It is a nice name. But someone who has that name is asking to be made fun of throughout school and whenever they meet someone. Think about Job interviews that name just says Sex.|`|SKJgSpdnaa	Too risque. It is however also a pet form of Dolores.|`|fNv2Re6baa	I love it especailly shortened to Lola. However, its kinda sounds like 'lolly' so I'd use Lanita or Latina.|`|pl7lWGZDaa	Lolita reminds me of a wrestler.

If it was me i'd just get my parent to sit down and then just tell them. They might yell, scream, cry,but they will calm down after that .

FLEXqVoiaa	My daughter fell off the bed when she was 9 months old. She was acting differently, very sluggish and quiet. I took her to see the DR, and they examined her and took x-rays.

My daughter fell off the bed at this age too. I was very worried, but she was fine. Just keep an eye on him.

I was terrified...worried to death...and could not leave my daughter alone the whole entire day and night. But...that's when I was very "ignorant" about the whole fall and bump thing with babies....<br>  <br>  I've talked to many pedi's about this same thing..and moms as well..and I've gotten the same answer.....babies are not as fragile as we think they are. Yes they need us because they can't do anything for themselves...but their bodies...we do not give them enough credit for. It's not like if a baby hits her head 3 times her head is going to break or anything.....their skulls are as strong as ours...<br>  <br>  My daughter has fallen off..our high high bed...onto our marble floor. TWICE....yes I have no clue how I allowed it to happen a second time but it did. She's fine...and my pedi reassured me countless times that as long as the baby isn't throwing up or anything outrageous like eyes rolling into the back of her head....then everything is fine. Other then that...babies fall off and fall down from things all the time....if they were that fragile....infant death rate would be wayy higher.<br>  <br>  It's okay mommy!|`|FHmtAMLZaa	I know how you feel. my son fell off the bed when he was 3 months old yes 3MONTHS scared the hell out of me as he was so young but he was fine afterwards. doctor sed the same just to watch him. but he was grand after.

I'd probably stay awake all night watching him sleep lol.<br>  <br>  Any concerns you have (mother's instinct!) immediately call your pediatrician!|`|Tc23KWgzaa	Very unlikely.  Did he fall onto carpet, or was the bed really high?  Babies' heads are really soft at this time, and not easily hurt.  Right on his soft spot, maybe, but if he seems okay, he probably is.  He's the authority on the subject.  If he's not crying, he's not in pain.  Take his word for it.<br>  <br>  TX Mom
Og09Q7ylaa	You are certainly not irresponsible! What is working against you is that you were on day 15 of your cycle. That is usually bang (no pun intended) in the middle of most womens' fertile time.You did take Plan B within 72 hours and it is 89% effective that way. (I don't know where the other poster got 5% after 72 hours, but I have yet to find documentation for that and it doesn't pertain to you anyhow.) Honestly, the only thing you can do right now, short of having a copper IUD inserted as emergency contraception, is wait and see. You will only have a couple of weeks to sweat it before you can take the test. Best of luck!|`|b4az9Zudaa	I dont know why anyone would think you are irresponsible? Accidents happen. Sex happens. <br>  <br>  My human sexuality professor told us last week that plan b is about 80% effective<br>  <br>  Good luck, and I hope it works for you!|`|LCHBVtaBaa	there is no way i would say your irresponsible. my doctor told me that the plan B is 89% effective the sooner it is taken after unprotected sex. the plan B is like 5% effective if 72 hours has passed since having unprotected sex. so it should b very much effective since u waited less than 2 hours. dont fret about it give yourself some peace of mind. Im 17 and i would say that i am alot like you ( expect ive never had 2 use plan b cuz i  take my BCP on time every nite n i have no medication to inteact with the pill) in that i am very careful when it comes on to sex and never let pleasure blur my sense of responsibilty. im very proud of you. :D<br>  <br>  best wishes|`|vygYFdsSaa	In my opinion you're being the opposite of irresponsible, you took Plan B much quicker than most women do. I think it will be as effective as Plan B can ever be, because it gives you a 72 hour window to take it in. Good job ;)
vygYFdsSaa	Sounds like you are sick to me. You can take a test like First Response at any time. Good luck|`|GHH1i6d3aa	Very good chance that you're pregnant.  My first signs were achy swollen breasts and spotting.  All of the symptoms you describe are first trimester symptoms.  Go get a test either way.|`|k537bk2maa	they very well could be pregnancy symptoms but the only way u r gonna be able to find out is from a test! u have 2 more days until ur next period should come, u could possibly just be sick or u also may be pregnant so go get a test so u can get urself to the doctors to be taken care of!|`|ojHVod5uaa	You could be sick,but it sounds to me like you are pregnant. Go ahead and schedule a blolod test with your doctor,they can tell that you're pregnant as early as two weeks,then go from there. Good Luck|`|7gWCMH64aa	I will bet you a nickel you are indeed pregnant.I suspect this is your first child as well. First Pregnancy's are hard to figure i.e. conception, due dates. I have known some first timers to " spot" until 7th month.<br>  <br>  It just so happens my Daughter<br>  is 20 weeks. The first 6 she felt just as you describe, tired, sick, hot etc. After about 5-8 weeks your body "adjusts" to the little one stealing your nutrition.LOL! You must keep hydrated, and eat 4-5 small meals so baby won't deplete<br>  you. All the best!
aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	You might be able to get a job in the hospital cafeteria or gift shop, but you will not be able to be employed in any other position within the hospital at your age and without a degree.<br>  <br>  You can volunteer, though.  Not only will it teach you good "bedside manner" and invaluable experience, but it will look good on your college application.|`|tbeO3Lataa	As a job, you could be an orderly. They clean bedpans, transport patients, etc.<br>  <br>  However, what I would recommend doing is starting off as a volunteer, and hoping you get further. You could take vitals, update charts etc., but the general rule is "nothing sharp" (no needles, scalpels, etc.).<br>  <br>  What would really help is getting a First Responder license. It usually a week-long class, and it's a certification that has to be updated yearly. Worth it, though.|`|9zwSclnLaa	Well, it would probably be either an intern or a volunteer.

You go around doing odd jobs like cleaning bedpans and stuff|`|AA10673927	You could always volunteer.<br>  <br>  [:|`|mx3gFmIKaa	Yes, an escort.

ykP7I3caaa	My baby is going to be half black and half white and some of the things people have said to me on here are so ridiculous that they're easy to ignore. They might as well say cats are just smaller dogs.. They're psychotic.<br>  <br>  Yesterday I answered a question, someone asking why black girls don't wash their hair and they were obviously white.. They were like 'your hair needs to be cleaned.. why don't you wash it?' I told them they were being rude and that it's not the same as other race's hair and to worry about themselves. They picked me as best answer so I could see them say "It affects me because their hair stink and your black man stinks"<br>  <br>  I've also had about three different people say that I'm a 'naughty girl' and I basically like big penises by the look of my icon [my boyfriend is black.]<br>  <br>  One stereotype about white people is that they're all racist and 'crackers' and everything else. And that they try to keep the black man down. I'm white, and when I look at someone black, white, asian or mexican, that's not what I'm thinking about at all. I swear to god, it doesn't even cross my mind. I just see people as people, nothing else. It's probably because I'm used to a lot of different races, but that's why people shouldn't stereotype. A stereotype is a term for EVERYONE who is a part of a group. How could you know something about every single person in that 'group' unless you've met them all in person? I could meet 4 black people, like two, and dislike two. I'm sick of all this racial profiling.<br>  <br>  People think asians are automatically good at math<br>  People think black people don't shower and eat fried chicken and koolaid. <br>  People think black people live in the ghetto and are gangsters.<br>  People keep telling my boyfriend not to have a baby with a white girl because she's going to be mean to him and not let him see his baby and make him pay child support... And that a black girl wouldn't do that.<br>  People think mexicans are sketchy.<br>  <br>  None of those are true for all. Im so sick of it.|`|2QvIM81Haa	Black :<br>  <br>  Ghetto<br>  Ghetto talk<br>  Gangster|`|5rrK4o5raa	Black lower class: on welfare/foodstamps, drug user and/or dealer, has multiple "babymamas", drink 40oz of malt liqor and smoke Newports<br>  <br>  Black middle class: somewhat educated, living beyond their means to try and prove they're not "poor", drive expensive cars and live in expensive houses<br>  <br>  Black upper class: rappers, basketball players, or extremely well-educated<br>  ----<br>  White lower class: live in trailer parks, survive on foodstamps, smoke Marlboro Reds and drink Miller lite, have more children than they can afford, would rather collect welfare than work<br>  <br>  White middle class: hard workers, lots of credit card debt, men play golf, women watch tv talk shows like Oprah and Dr. Phil, usually very passionate Republicans<br>  <br>  White upper class: Inherited lots of money, extremely well-educated, CEOs, doctors, lawyers, own their own business or corporation, etc.|`|aG0PtaK4aa	Black people: Love fried chicken, wear tons of fubu stuff, are all from the ghetto are better at every sport, and only listen to rap.<br>  <br>  White people: Can't rap, wear all nerdy stuff, can't dance, hate every race besides themselves, and are always smart. <br>  <br>  The only times stereotypes are useful are when comedians use them in their stand up. "Cough Cough" Chris Rock "Cough Cough"|`|b30a67bb9890faa58afa5ef3c9a79a91aa	Haha, all those stereotypes are too true. <br>  Can't think of anything else to add, though.<br>  <br>  Although, I might as well add that where I live, there are two distinct malls, "T" and "H". "H" is in an area with a larger concentration of Latinos and African-Americans and the other is an area that is mainly Caucasian.<br>  <br>  "T"'s stores are all really cheap and kinda of ghetto-ish while "H" has expensive stores like Coach, Apple Store, you get the picture...obviously stating that Caucasians have more money to burn at the mall than the other ethnic groups, sometimes true, sometimes not!|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	How about we make one about you for fun.<br>  <br>  You are too uptight to steal|`|d8afe189b896f15245363b64cafb7a7baa	White people start stereotypes against other people,<br>  White people hate everyone else.<br>  Black people like chicken, watermelon and kool-aid [Which I like too, and im asian]<br>  Black people pronounce "ask" like "axe"|`|xJqg0DFSaa	Black and white steretypes are complete opposites actually.

jcEtRUVZaa	This worked like a charm for me and my two daughters. They're teenagers now but I swear if I put this music on they'd instantly fall asleep!<br>  <br>  How to Get a Baby, Toddler or Child to Fall Asleep<br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/ehow_4767974_baby-toddler-child-fall-asleep.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/ehow_4767974_baby-to...</a>|`|eya1WDS4aa	Well she shouldnt be on a bottle at 22 months old, its not good for her or her teeth. my son is 23 months old and hasnt had a bottle since he turned one, time to take her off the bottle. For her sleeping if she has eatten and she is not wet, then just let her cry it out most kids should be sleeping threw the night by the time they are one.|`|3rda58OCaa	The only way to stop this is to stop giving her the bottle during the night.  If she wakes up get her back to sleep without the bottle, and soon she will quit getting up for it.  It is not going to be easy, but it is for the best.  She (nor you) are getting the sleep she needs, and she is probably getting way too many calories which is unhealthy for her body.  If it was my daughter i would simply tell her it is "night-night" time, and put her back to bed.  Do not mention the bottle.  If she ask just keep saying "It's night-night time."|`|E8rPB1CBaa	Keep her up during the day, no naps after 1:00 noon.  Give her activities that will wear her down such as the park, a tri-cycle, etc.  At bedtime she will be exhausted.  DO NOT GIVE HER MILK BEFORE BED!!!  SHE'S TOO OLD FOR THAT.  Give her a warm bath instead and milk before her bath.<br>  <br>  I feel your pain.  My son was a cry baby and didn't sleep through the night until he was about 2 1/2.  One thing I found out... he was crying because he was wet and didn't want to pee in the bed.|`|3bef6db1e814bbf22fd78ed76d048272aa	This  may sound mean, but just let her cry for a few night.  You know she's not starving to death, but it's like a habit for her now to get up and eat in the middle of the night.  Now if there's like a major life change going on or she's sick thats a different story.

01Mu3wUeaa	How can you leave someone in the dark and hope for the best?<br>  <br>  You cannot "wing it" in situations like this.There is not a thing as genetic similarities if it is an infant.<br>  <br>  <br>  When the child is born, YOU need to go to court and file for a paternity test.If you are not the father, she needs to inform the other potential baby daddy.<br>  <br>  <br>  Don't assume anything.Get a test.The child deserves to know his/her real dad/paternal family.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  And wear condoms from now on...you don't know what kind if STDs you can get from women like this.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	I think it's best to notify all potential fathers and get them to take a DNA test. If she doesn't want to do that then you should request one so at least you'll know if you are or not.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|ki5hZbcTaa	well, there are no guarantees so both of you need to take a paternity test when the baby is born. Don't either one of you sign the birth certificate until that is done because if the wrong guy signs it, it is very hard to get the right guy put on. The reason is because if you're not married, you sign an acknowledgment of paternity and it is sometimes hard to change. Plus she sounds shady for trying to pass it off as belonging to the guy she wants.|`|viGqMW1Xaa	take it to Maury to get a free DNA test. but yeah everyone who is involved should know the truth.<br>  <br>  and the baby can come out looking exactly like him but be your baby.<br>  <br>  i have seen it happen and it is possible<br>  <br>  use protection please|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	you know what whom ever is the father there has to be support i would get a DNA from both of you and find out and then it will be solved. she is on the other hand a not so nice person.|`|3rda58OCaa	to me there isn't enough info.  if you are in a relationship with this woman then i would get a DNA test done now before the baby is born, so you are on the birth certificate and such.  If you are going to start a family with this woman and baby then i would tell the other guy all of the information.<br>  <br>  If this is just some girl you had sex with then i would wait it out and when the baby is born (and you want to be a part of his/her life) then go to court and get a paternity test.  If you don't want to have anything to do with the child or the woman then don't waste your money and stay away from her.  Also, if you aren't in a relationship with her then i wouldn't worry about what she is telling the other guy!<br>  <br>  You won't be able to tell by looking at the baby unless you 2 men are of different races-sometimes, depending on the race, you still won't be able to tell.  You will have to get tests.  After the baby is born you can buy a test that you mail off and is so simple you just swab the insides of your mouths and mail it.|`|AA11831450	If she dosen't tell him you should. Obviously it is her place to do it- you should be present if possible. If she wants to wait and see, something is wrong! What can she be thinking? Is she just out for the money...child support from him as well as getting your help? What if the baby is yours, but she raises it to believe it is the other mans?? I repeat, If she doesn't tell him, I think you should.|`|sF3UyQsIaa	hehe, this sounds like a maury povich episode. you ARE the father... hahaha!!! lol... well what i would do is wait until baby is born and do a dna test. they have at home kits now that you can buy for 30 bucks, and mail it in and wait for the results. id look into that. leave the ex in the dark as long as you are willing to take the father responsibilities.|`|c5AJGcYcaa	I honestly say wait til baby gets here. Then take her to court for a DNA test. <br>  The "ex" may not believe you if you tell him what you know. <br>  <br>  I really hope you have dumped this dumb broad tho!<br>  <br>  Good luck hope all works out|`|S3t69kh2aa	Please look for the truth.  Anything else is not acceptable.|`|1OSo4nofaa	i wouldn't tell him until you know if he is the father or not for sure|`|XeASdibHaa	Before getting all worked up about the situation u need to be positive that this is your child. You should get DNA tests done. <br>  <br>  Now, let's assume that u were right and that it Is indeed your child.  <br>  <br>  Hes her ex therefore is no longer her significant other and should have no more feelings for her, so he shouldn't care whether or not he's the real father. However, he needs to know because he's been informed that it's his child which it isn't. <br>  <br>  Do you want to be the father?<br>  <br>  Are u up to that responsibility? If not, her ex still needs to know, but you can give him custody of the child and have him and his ex work somethig out. <br>  <br>  If you do want to be the kids dad, then you still need to let the ex know because he's been badly informed and you can get into some trouble if you do otherwise.

l42UDjFGaa	A child should have a minimum of 100 expressive (spoken words) by 2 years, so he's already delayed. I would take him to an SLP for a full evaluation of both expressive and receptive language. You've already waited...don't wait any longer. It's all about early intervention and you want to get him on track before it starts becoming a social and learning barrier for him (i.e., play dates, daycare, pre-k). In the S/L field, little boys are know to be a little behind with expressive language, in general. Doesn't mean you haven't been doing everything a parent should do. Sometimes, they just need skilled remediation to get their expressive language going, like you'll get with an SLP. Always best to check their comprehension of spoken language as well, which is a given when you go in for an SLP eval.|`|mx3gFmIKaa	Don't wait, forget the pediatrician, call early intervention yourself.  Its free, and you need no referral, they will assess and start therapy if he qualifies.  I have gone through this with all my kids, then in September he will qualify for the free preschool.|`|c271e0d140cbe1902cabe87b6f0e3485aa	You say he is not talking, but does he understand when you talk to HIM?<br>  <br>  Speech is one thing, but language acquisition is something that should be going on.  If you think he is not understanding what is said to him, then take him to your doctor who may suggest speech therapy or perhaps check his hearing.<br>  <br>  Some children don't start to talk when other children do, but the important process of acquiring speech is still going on.|`|7WcfzvPvaa	I would take him to his pediatrician.  From there, the pediatrician can recommend an early intervention(speech) therapist.  These services are free in most towns, so you have nothing to loose by checking into it.  Why wait?  Not talking at 2 1/2 doesn't mean that there is anythig wrong.  My daughter was still calling me dada (I'm the mom) when she was over two, and she is 11 and fine.|`|S3t69kh2aa	My daughter did not start talking until 3 1/2.  Her brother and sister talked for her, so she chose not to.  She understood everything.  I would suggest you ask your doctor.  But try not to worry.|`|3rda58OCaa	I would take him to he his regular pediatrician first.  I would do it now, don't wait until he is 3.  He should be talking way before 3.|`|58JgbttAaa	well my son was a late talker too! he started talking like around 2 1/2 but you have to be patient and the doctor told me that if he wants something and points to it to try to get him to tell you what he wants. i took my son to the school district because most of the districts have a Special program for kids who have problems with speech. it would help him with his speech and at the same time it's preschool. try to call your school district to see if they have any special programs for kids who are speaking late, but don't worry about it he'll come around my son is 5 now and you wouldn't know that he was a late talker. good luck!|`|yAVKWvDMaa	You should take him now before he's 3 b/c it's free.  Flash cards do not help, but it's good that you're reading to him.  Songs help, talking a lot (no baby talk like baba for bottle)and listening to your child so that you're ready to respond when he does talk.|`|TYErFAAzaa	I would consult a speech therapist or even your pediatrician.  There could be developmental delays going on and you need to catch it early rather then later!<br>  <br>  I have a 2 year old and believe me she knows over 100 words.  Please have your child checked out.

If I am freaking out for no reason over something silly he knows its hormones and just tells me everything will be ok.  Then I calm down and laugh with him.  Don't take it personal, she still loves you, but hormones can be unruly.  Definitely continue to communicate and be honest, she may not realize that she is being unusually moody.  Be supportive and it will pass.  A small sacrifice for a lifetime of happiness :)|`|HoonZJMgaa	Hi I wanted to answer you hoping I can help a bit. I am pregnant with my 7th child. I am probably thee worst person to be around when I am pregnant and I don't mean to be. I can't control my feelings or my outbursts sometimes. So what I am saying is, she may be difficult and irritating but she most likely doesn't mean to be. Just try to give her plenty of love and affection when she lets you touch her and be as understanding as possible. About marriage, make sure you are marrying her for all the right reasons not just because she is pregnant. I was married young and it was a disaster. I got older and realized he wasn't at all what I needed in a husband. I don't want to scare you but age does matter. If you do marry her, know that it will take hard work and commitment to make it work. I am now happily married to a wonderful man but it just isn't always peaches and cream you know!? I wish you all the best. God bless your new family.|`|JWp9PMyRaa	shes stressed..<br>  <br>  Just be by her side..<br>  support her..<br>  Love her|`|135595fc2caf33898d4407d277fc9683aa	this is a difficult situation. im sure its really scary for you and your girlfriend.<br>  what you need to do i get your life in order to get ready for the child.<br>  you need to make sure you are getting a good source income. this is crucial. you must support this child.<br>  then, you need to make sure you have a house/apartment so you your girlfriend and this child can live.<br>  and make sure your family knows. and you need to be committed to this. <br>  <br>  This is just as much as your fault as it is your girlfriends. and i dont mean that in a bad way or anything i am just saying this because you are responsible. its time you grow up and stop acting like an 18 year old and start acting like a daddy and a future husband.<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck|`|IB9NmwZ1aa	lots and lots of support and love and don't piss her off then you will do just fine
1z3C0R2Vaa	See your doc could be stress because if you were pregnant your tummy would grow a little bigger than it use to be. Good luck..........)|`|cj7sSPZEaa	Yes you could be.  Take another test and then see a doctor regardless of the result.  If it is positive then see the doctor for the pregnancy, if it is negative then see the doctor for your missing period.  Other reasons for a late/missing period include stress, taking certain medications, exercising frequently, rapid weight gain or loss, eating disorders, and problems with the reproductive organs.|`|BfBMRlNNaa	Some women won't test positive on a home pregnancy test, doesn't mean they aren't pregnant. You should call your doc and have a blood test done, that way you will know for sure. Also, if you aren't pregnant you can find out what's causing your period to be so irregular.|`|tSh1zh7gaa	Take another and if it says no then go to the doc. If you are not you probably have something else the matter.|`|jf1o7TFHaa	you could be stressed, if you are on the pill sometimes those make ur periods non existant.|`|QxJ4tuUCaa	Yes you could. See a doctor.|`|d6Uncd6iaa	If you have not had your period in 3 months, I would consult a doctor. Very often pregnany tests can be wrong. A doctor will run a couple diffrent tests to make sure you are not pregnant and one of the tests he/she will  conduct will check for any health risks that may occure or have occured in the past 3 months. I would not worry to much untill a doctor tells you what is going on, it may be stress or nerves. Good Luck and I hope everything works out for you.|`|135595fc2caf33898d4407d277fc9683aa	yes you can and you probably are.
tEEB5339aa	Poor baby! I went through the same thing with my son when we first started the rice cereal. I didn't know that it could bind them up like that. You could try decreasing his feedings with the cereal and see if that helps. Also, a little bit of pear juice might help loosen things up for him a bit. They have all different kinds of brands, but I like a brand called "Earth's Best Organic (you can find it at most grocery chains and Target)." It comes in little jars and its already diluted, so you don't need to mix it with water. Give him a little after his feedings, or you can pour it right in, too. I hope this helps. <br>  Of course if it gets worse you should call the doctor. But, it gets easier once they start on jar food. (a lot of it tends to get things moving again, so it kind of cancels out the binding effects of the cereal).|`|n6XYYyoLaa	do u have doc's ok to feed solids? you should ask your doc this sort of thing instead of following YA ppl regarding anything related to the health of your baby; we don't know him, his doc does...|`|u94HOVz7aa	yup that happened to my babies.  try feeding him less.  also real fruit juice is good at balancing that out.  i don't know the recommended age for juice these days, but my son's dr. has him drink 1oz of pear juice twice a day to help undo his constipation due to his soy formula.|`|USrhxMW9aa	I agree, I'd say switch to oatmeal.  That's what I did with my son who is almost 7 months old now.  The rice cereal constipated him, but haven't had an issue with oatmeal.  You could also try making the cereal less thick...I don't know how much formula you're putting with it, but the consistency should be fairly thin when just starting out since his digestive track isn't used to solids yet.  Also, if he's having constipation issues I'd stay away from bananas and applesauce which can also cause constipation, in case you were thinking of adding any fruits to his diet.|`|8lcNupM2aa	I had to stop the rice cereal and just move on to oatmeal because my son kept getting constipated all the time from it and then he would cry.  Once I gave my son the oatmeal he loved it! and shortly after that I started mixing it with different 1st foods.  He never had the same problems with the oatmeal. I also want to add that I tried the mixed grain and because that contains the rice it also constipated him.  I say try the oatmeal and he should be fine.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|nQyJFOMZaa	I had to stop rice cereal and switch to oatmeal too I mix it will gerber apple juice though. Helps with the constipation my pediatrician recommended my trying it that way. Also A bottle of diluted gerber pear juice(2oz juice-2oz water) Also will help loosen their bowel. Call and ask your pediatrician what they recommend because all babies are different and require different stuff.|`|TvYX1yXWaa	my son went through the same thing i gave him 2 oz of prune juice with 2 oz of water and it seemed to help him. he getting use to the cereal now so his poops fine. i also have him on stage 1 bananas and sweet potato's . he turned 4 months in feb

I am sorry for what you are going through with not only her health, but the terrible behavior of the children-I can not imagine how that would effect my daughter.<br>  <br>  I homeschool my c hildren, and I do recommend it-especially in your situation. We see a wide variety of children in our various activities, and I can tell you that the homeschooled children are better behaved and more well mannered than any other group (overall-not saying they are all perfect).<br>  <br>  If you wish, you can contact me via my profile. I would be glad to discuss this more with you!|`|p0prrzf2aa	AWWW =[[ them dumb lil shits >:( go straight to the principal screw them teachers, there's alot they can do besides sit there and watch them kids pick on her.|`|S3t69kh2aa	Go to school with her and protect her.  Ask the principal for phone numbers and parents names of the children offending her.  Ask the teachers why they are allowing this to happen.  Do not let this continue.

I wish I could help.|`|aXnxkT1oaa	I swear if it was my daughter I would go there and break the teeth of EACH and EVERY boy involved! disgusting attitude!! just unbleievable! they are not boys they are monsters with no respect and no education!!!!

Seriously...that is not right...and your daughter does not deserve it! <br>  I think maybe you need to go the old fashioned way and talk to some of those kids' parents. Most parents are pretty responsive to other parents...just talk to them, and keep reminding your daughter of how beautiful she is and how some people just don't understand what cancer is, and it makes them unsure, and little kids always pick on what is unfamiliar.|`|IE2YbJr0aa	Aww i am sooo sorry. You could try moving, getting her a wig so the kids at her new school wont know. There is not much you can do about it.|`|DnNkCF6Taa	I would say talk to the school administration and tell them this is the situation and make sure they know what is going on.  If the teachers are not doing anything, I would suggest that you have a talk with the teachers as well with the principle there to sort out the matter.  There is no need for your lil girl to feel that way, and I think while I do think if it doesn't progress it would be better to move to another school than to home school her.  But not just move her to another school, ask her what she wants to do, does she want to go to another school?<br>  <br>  I think if you home school it will just make her depressed as far as why does she need to stay at home to do school, does that mean that there really is always going to be people picking on her.  It bothers me quite a bit about that, but I would say that you should talk to the school administration and get this settled, and make them aware of it.  If it doesn't improve, I would simply take it to the next step and bring it up to matters with the School District until someone can do something about it.<br>  <br>  But then again, I would say that if they don't stop it may be good to bring her to another school.  But instead of just switching her over, I know this might seem strange but ask what she wants to do, so this is her decision as well.|`|UfhE3k1baa	That is disgusting. I would highly suggest going to school and raising hell. Maybe the teachers could talk to the students and help them understand. Children are horrible, and the teachers are just as bad for letting it happen. I know alot of people will tell you not to let her run away from these problems, but your child has cancer, she is allowed to run away. She has enough to deal with, and if a new school offers her a better chance, then you should consider it. Both of my younger stepbrothers have a terminal illness, and when they went into wheel chairs the kids at school were so mean to them. They would put the breaks on one side down so when they tried to move they would only go in circles, they called them fat because of the medications they had to be on that made them very bloated. The would take their things and put them places they could not get them down. It was heart-breaking. My stepmom and dad went to the school and raised hell, but it did not do any good. The teachers took the attitude that kids will be kids and my brothers need to deal with it. My dad basically told them to **** themselves, my brothers are dying, they do not have to deal with anything else. So they moved them to a different school and before the boys started there my parents had the teachers explain to the students what was wrong with them and that it was not okay to pick on them or treat them differently. They love this school and have alot of friends not, kids who actually come to their house to hang out because they know Cody and Dylan can't really go anywhere that isn't handicap ready. You are your daughters advocate, her voice until she can speak up and protect herself, don't feel any shame in doing it for her.|`|YT1vOwq6aa	Tell your daughter that they can go skrew themselves. Tell your daughter, i (a man on the internet) wishes only the best for her, and she is only picked on because the other kis are scared. She is better than them, tell her that whenever she gets picked on, to simply kick the person in the nuts or something else (not really if you disapprove)<br>  <br>  <br>  Also tell her, she doesn't deserve cancer, it happens, and she is VERY strong for fighting it. If i had cancer i probably wouldn't be as strong as this little girl, tell her i said that. And that there will ALWAYS be those who pick on her and those who look up to her because she is a brave little soul. May god bless her brave little heart.
3rda58OCaa	-My daughter slept with us since she was born, but not every night.  Some nights she fell asleep in her bassinet, she is almost 3 now and can sleep in her bed, but sometimes still wants to sleep with mommy and daddy and we have no problem with that.  <br>  <br>  -We decided it was fine for her to sleep with us, because she is secure and comfortable that way.  She is only little for so long so I want her to feel safe and happy while she still can!<br>  <br>  -She has sleep in her own bed since she was born off and on.  She sleeps with us half the time and in her bed the other half of the time.<br>  <br>  -I think it varies for each child.  My little sister slept with my parents until she was about 6, and then she thought she was too "big" to sleep there.  My little brother was even younger than that.  <br>  <br>  I think it is rare for a 9 year old to sleep with their parents, but if it was my daughter and that i how she was comfortable and soothed than she would be welcome!  I think as long as the child and the parents are happy and healthy there is nothing wrong with it.|`|427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	With my first two, we always started them in their own beds and just brought them in with us when they first woke.  <br>  <br>  My oldest started sleeping completely through the night on her own right around a year, so we were no longer co-sleeping with her (although she'd still snuggle in bed with us for a while some mornings).<br>  <br>  My middle child was a horrible sleeper and continued to nurse several times per night until shortly after her 2nd birthday when I finally night weaned her.  Around 18 months, we had moved her into a double bed with her sister, but she continued to join us in our bed in the middle of the night until she was probably 3 years old.  There were also plenty of nights until about 4 months ago that my husband would spend at least part of the night cuddling her in her bed.  She's now 4 and sleeps the whole night in her own bed consistently with only the occasional need for help falling back to sleep.  She and her sister have bunk beds, but they still choose to sleep together in the bottom (full-size) bunk most nights.<br>  <br>  My youngest is now 18 months old, and we co-slept with him full-time for the first 6 months.  Then, I started putting him in his crib for naps and to start the night.  I brought him into our bed to nurse back to sleep the first time he woke, which was usually between 12-2am.  He just recently started giving us more consistent 7-8 hour stretches, so on his good nights, he's in my bed around 5-6am.  On bad nights, he's in my bed around 1-3am.  <br>  <br>  My decision to co-sleep has always been based on what gets us more sleep.  I would expect most 2-year-olds to be able to sleep on their own for at least part of the night, but I also know lots of 5-8-year-olds who still crawl into their parents' bed occasionally.  It all depends on what works for your family.  We have a king-size bed, so we have lots of room if 1-2 children (or all 3) need to join us for the last hour or two of sleep.  I know we couldn't have them all in bed with us all night, though, or none of us would sleep.<br>  <br>  One thing that really helped my middle child was for us to lie with her in her bed as she was transitioning to sleeping more in her bed and less in our bed.  Having a double bed for the girls was great!<br>  <br>  I wouldn't worry just yet about having a full-time co-sleeper at age 9.  If you're starting to anticipate problems with the co-sleeping arrangement in the near future, try getting your little one used to her own bed for naps first and then work on bedtime.  She'll adjust in time.|`|j3wown0oaa	Get the baby out of your bed ASAP.  She has to learn to "self comfort".  Parents usually let their kids sleep with them because they're afraid, selfish or lazy.  Put the kid in it's bed and let her learn to go to sleep on her own.  When she cries, get up take care of her then put her back in her bed.  Since she's been sleeping with you, it's gonna be a bit of an undertaking to get her to change.  However in the long run it's what's best for her and it should be what's best for you.  Aside from a Saturday morning pajama snuggle, I can't imagine my son sleeping with my husband and I.  It would totally infringe on our privacy and personal space.  Even when my son has been sick, I or my husband get up and comfort or care for him in his room.  Then we come back to our bed.<br>  <br>  Good luck . .  .|`|BqqDJXkjaa	I started letting my daughter sleep with us when she was 6 months old - we moved interstate and I found I got more comfort and more sleep if she was next to me. <br>  When she was about 18 months I started keeping her in her cot as she started sleeping sideways and kicking etc. <br>  I was too sacred to sleep with her when she was first born, but I think I probably will do it if I have a second child. You just get more sleep!|`|2WoUvFUJaa	My son is now four years old. I let him sleep with me because I would find that when he slept in his crib, somehow throughout the night I would wake up and put him in my bed anyways so I just started letting him sleep there because I was afraid I would end up falling down with him (we shared a room, but still...). We started trying to get him to sleep in his own bed at 18 months and he did for about six months until he went to a toddler bed and then he would get up and never stay in it so we let him sleep with us til he was about three then we said no more. We fought for almost a year to get him to fully stay in his bed all night (he is VERY stubborn). Now he pretty much stays in his own bed. Every once in a while he still comes into our room at night. I would recommend starting as soon as you feel the time is right. You will know as a mom. You will know what is right for your baby. Best of luck to you.|`|vj3WSxzWaa	Our son is now 4,and slept with us for a year,,and then in the same room,for another year and a half due to living situations,he still to this day,gets out of bed,between 12 and 4 am to come sleep in our bed,,it is very very hard,,,trust me,lose the sleep now,because it is tough getting up 3 or more times to take them back to bed when they are older!<br>  it is going to very hard next month as we have our second child due the first week of April,and I know all the work we have done,is going to have to be re-done with the new baby sleeping in the room.<br>  BTW,we decided to co-sleep for the same reasons as you,it was easier at the time,more sleep for us ect.<br>  I hope this helps!<br>  Good Luck!|`|S3t69kh2aa	And how are you going to get your child to move to her own bed when the time comes?  The longer you wait, the harder it will be for her to  make the change.  Babies can sleep in their own bed the day they are born.  If you ever want privacy you better think about it now, or you will spend hours and hours and hours and hours and hours trying to correct this problem.  I don't understand why parents don't understand this?|`|703c83fe1a687f02e99bde09a9966ecfaa	Boy, some of these people sure are judgmental!<br>  <br>  We co-sleep with our daughter because it's best for her.  I don't think it's right to leave a baby alone in the dark to cry until she vomits on herself.  When she cried so hard I thought she'd hyperventilate and pass out, I decided the responsible thing would be to abandon cry-it-out in favor of common sense.  I know cry-it-out works for some people, and that's fine.  It didn't work for us and that doesn't mean we are lazy.  Every baby is different.  It's not always ideal having her in bed with us, but a lot of things about having a baby aren't ideal.  You can't just decide to go to a movie at the last minute.  You can't be quite as spontaneous.  You aren't #1 anymore.  We certainly never thought having a baby would be easy.<br>  <br>  Anyway, we started co-sleeping after seven months or so when my daughter started having lots of teething pain.  She needed extra love and understanding, and not to be taken to her crib and left in the dark to cry.  We got a bed rail from Toys R Us and put it on our bed to keep her from falling out.  It was wonderful to wake up to her happy little face rather than frightened crying.<br>  <br>  For a while we moved the crib into our room, removed the front rail and pushed it up to our bed, but she hated the crib.  We'd let her cry in the crib and she remembered that.  So she pretty much stayed in our bed until recently.<br>  <br>  She's 21 months old now, and for a month or two we've been working on a transition to a toddler bed.  My husband built it and it's really low to the floor.  We put it in our room right near our bed so she doesn't feel separated from us.  If she needs us she just climbs on up, and we don't make a big deal of it.  I know the pressure is what ruined the crib for her, and we are not going that route again.  She sometimes sleeps in her bed, and sometimes in ours.  If her dad lies next to her for a few minutes she does better with it.  If she's really sleepy (or totally asleep) it takes very little effort to get her to sleep there most or all of the night.  I am thinking that by the time she is three she will be in her own bed and probably her own room, but it's not a deadline.  I am pregnant again and we expect the birth of her new brother or sister to push this back a bit, just like it would potty training.  We have an Arm's Reach Co-Sleeper for the baby, so there won't be an issue of her (or any of us) rolling onto the little one.<br>  <br>  I don't want my children to ever feel they can't come to me, even in the middle of the night.  Privacy, sleep, societal norms--they are all secondary to my children's needs.  Call me crazy (or lazy).  I call it following my instincts and being a good parent.
gfmTgLDKaa	It's really hard to tell, but they are unusual signs that can't be taken lightly. If I were you I'd get checked by your doctor, and don't worry about anybody finding out it is confidential.<br>  <br>  Get a pregnancy test from the store, but the best way is to go to the doctor.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps even if by a little, Good Luck! :D|`|5wLu4Sqqaa	Gosh.. go get one of those early home pregnancy tests it can tell within <br>  two weeks of getting pregnant !! Good luck!|`|VSYhHiOeaa	it's hard to say for sure because in order to maintain the cells in you body's homeostasis they need to maintain the normal temperature of your body, but the symptoms do seem to match. you should wait till your further in, and then get tested. best wishes!|`|ATBHG0ztaa	A lot of PMS symptoms and pregnancy symptoms are similar. Go get a pregnancy test if you really want to know. The digital ones are worth the extra few dollars.
kqDbWzKvaa	They think they are the center of the Universe.  A pretty simple answer.  Can you remember back when you were 10 years old?  Everything was about you.  When you become a teenager the world is about you and  the opposite sex (especially boys)  He will grow out of it.  He likes the attention it makes him  feel important and loved.  Go along with  it.  He is only going to be 10 years old once.  Make a game out of it. Smother him in attention and see what happens. Ask him interesting questions about himself.  What he likes and what he thinks of the world and other people, what he is studing in school.  I bet you could make a friend here.|`|kRaVa0Wraa	uhh because youre his BABYSITTER? they dont pay you to get on the internet.<br>  go get your *** up and interact with the kid. now.|`|GUuFKaaiaa	i think sometimes they do it because they don't get enough attention from their parents or other siblings. my little brother does it when he wants attention too. also its just a part of being a kid- you go through stages when you are really annoying. try and play a game with him that you always have to be talking to him or something|`|ntdGOZqGaa	Because to him he thinks its soooo cool what he is doing and he wants to show you and share it with you. Plus he is trying to get your attention bc that is what he want is for you to pay attention to him.|`|peDJSnQPaa	idk why do people care so much about unborn babies when they are just parasitic lifeforms|`|2QvIM81Haa	Your his babysitter smart one! Get your asss off the computer and play with the kid! You seem like a horrid babysitter..|`|ixV9SfK6aa	i agree with tofu <br>  you  are not getting paid to sit on your *** and chat on facebook or myspace <br>  your job is to look after and entertain the child so do just that
HIskrREJaa	responsible, stable environment, good medical history, no drug-use or smoking, specific race if you want the same race as you (or not if you don't care)... everything else I would leave up to chance. I wouldn't care about their IQ, occupation, etc.|`|EHY3FnAmaa	A healthy family history|`|WCICeezjaa	First the previously mentioned donor should to be female<br>  She should probably be smart<br>  Be multilingual<br>  Be non-felon|`|tLGbtmGsaa	I would not care just as long as I know that the baby would be healthy.
hORVMOHKaa	my first test had a faint line that was barely noticeable, and now im almost 5 months pregnant! i would test again in a couple days. Good Luck!!|`|scdOdaTKaa	A faint line is a positive providing the test was done correctly and read in the right amount of time. Did you take both tests with first morning urine and do them both correctly? Wait a few more days and retest with first morning urine.|`|T1q4GWLkaa	Even a faint line means pregnant, but only if you follow the instructions and read it within the required time limit.  Try again in a few days to be sure.|`|eV7rtxmuaa	If you had a faint line it means your pregnant. Id re-test in another couple of days or request a HCG blood test from your doctor.|`|jzAfst8Taa	take another test in the morning and read it within the time limit to rule evap line other than that a positive is a positive no matter how faint good luck and keep us posted|`|gjVeJFRtaa	i had a very faint line and i was 6 weeks but i had a miscarry so gd look|`|RAEJAsa0aa	Well what I  would do is take like 3 more, I know it sounds weird but take 3-4 more and whichever has more negative or positive is your answer. Or you could go to a doctor and they will most likely tell you whether you are pregnant or not.
vygYFdsSaa	She's probably in the clear, only 2 days late and it doesn't sound like she has an extremely regular cycle. Just tell her not to stress out because that can make her period late. If her period still doesn't arrive in 3-4 days, she should take a test|`|ATBHG0ztaa	My advice would be to wait a few more days, tell her not to stress, then test. A lot of PMS symptoms can also be pregnancy symptoms. But if she stresses and she's due to get her period it can come later. <br>  <br>  But have her test in a few days otherwise. Accidents can happen.|`|zRaRSDy4aa	she can be pregnant no matter what, test her cus they are 95% accurate, idi you have on a condom cus that would make the situation a whole lot easier
MqFeJiukaa	Its normal end of pregnancy discharge|`|eV7rtxmuaa	Heavy discharge is very normal in late pregnancy. As far as I know you cannot lose your plug over a period of a month so i highly doubt you have lost it. I think you just have discharge.|`|qhgw9zBxaa	I was wondering if I lost my plug for a month too. Then I really lost it and  I finally knew what losing it really was. Sooo goopy. I could keep pulling the goop out of me. It was in the toilet one day when I woke up. It is not the little mucus stuff.
427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	It's hard to be so little!  What will really help you is to try to pinpoint what's making him so upset.  <br>  <br>  Is he trying to communicate with you, but can't?  That can be so frustrating at this age.  You can help him to try to say new words or even use signs/gestures to indicate his wants and needs.<br>  <br>  Is he trying to get your attention?  You will get better results with him if you give him lots of positive attention throughout the day.  The more you try to push him to do things on his own without you, the more upset he's going to be and the more he's going to want to be with you.  (Not saying you're doing this, just another possible idea.)<br>  <br>  Give him as many choices as possible.  Instead of just telling him that no, he can't have something, find a way to give him a choice.  So if he's asking for candy, ask if he wants an apple or a banana (or whatever is an acceptable choice for you).  He might still be frustrated about what he can't have, but at that age, they're usually happy to get to make some kind of choice.  <br>  <br>  Most of all, continue to distract, distract, distract.  Remove him from the situation if necessary, and find ways to calm him down.  Always pay attention to his needs, and try to understand whatever he's trying to communicate to you.<br>  <br>  You cannot spoil a child of any age with love.  If you're spoiling him with toys or treats, then that needs to stop and will be difficult.  But you can never give him too much of your time and attention.  He will learn to be independent from you soon enough.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	Probably just spoiled, which is ok. You just need to try to make the 20 month old understand which I know is near impossible that even though they cant have it they will be ok. As long they arent getting hurt then its ok for babies to cry sometimes bc sometimes they dont even know what they want. Good luck|`|AA11256693	Might be time to start time outs for unpleasant behaviors - including whiny crying. <br>  One minute per year of age, and fair warning, the first few times you do it will be a major test of your patience. <br>  My daughter was extra stubborn and our first time out session took 6 hours to get her to sit on the naughty step for 2 whole minutes. Just be calm (no yelling) and determined (do NOT give up and let him win) and tell him what is what.  I gave her several days warning that we would start time outs on Saturday and what they were about also, so that it wasn't a crazy parent just springing a new thing on her.<br>  I have an egg timer now, and at 5+ all I have to do is (dramatically) add a minute for each time out defiance move and she shapes up and sits nice very quickly. She doesn't want to sit there any more than she has to, but knows by now that it only makes timeout longer if she misbehaves.|`|hQ7UGldvaa	we ask ours if its a big deal or a small deal... if its a small deal we ask her to put her tears away and we will help her.
j7enSIr5aa	well as someone that as asked this question too soo many times I can understand how you feel. With me it seems that I find symptoms that are more pre-menstrual than pregnancy-- and once I finally take a test or stop concentrating on it I finally start my period-- and its such a let down (only if you are trying of course) <br>  but I understand that sometimes you just want answers and may not have access to a test or even money to buy one -- it happens to all of us-- <br>  only thing I can tell you that the with my two kids I had absolutely no symptoms but trying for a third I seem to conjure up all these symptoms bc I want to be soo bad-- <br>  the blood with my first lasted for about 1 day and not even enough to put on a pad so I hope this helps you!|`|ATBHG0ztaa	It definitely sounds like you could be. But as much as you might not want to, go buy a test. I suggest the digital ones because you can't really question the results. They're worth the few extra dollars. Women don't all get the same symptoms, so you could just be experiencing a few of them right now.<br>  <br>  Go buy a test, that way you have a definitive answer.|`|NOz2FRlraa	Take a test. That's the only way of knowing. <br>  <br>  With the symptoms you're having it's possible, everyone is different (so not everyone gets sore breasts)|`|058cbe8f080311800ecccf5877b18677aa	Just go take a test and get it over with.  Instead of doing all this "research" and stressing out, they are very accurate and you'll know within minutes.|`|cgctTeK7aa	My opinion: visit a doctor|`|32244200e4d988c2d8262690f2708c82aa	go to a doctor. no one on here can tell you for sure|`|XEiIYjT7aa	Your spotting doesn't sound like implantation bleeding...more like a light period. Implantation bleeding is a one-time, hardly noticeable bit of blood. If it happens on more than just one day, it probably isn't implantation.<br>  <br>  But, since you are worried I do suggest a test. I don't suggest a digital!!! They aren't very sensitive, and are more likely to give you a wrong diagnosis than a regular line test. You can buy tests at the dollar store, but the best to use by far are First Response Early Response tests. Good luck!|`|wWkfASTNaa	The only way to know for sure is a pregnancy test. And while for me, most of the online ovulation calculators were fairly accurate, not every ovulates right in the middle like those calculators lead you to beleive. you may have ovulated late, so your period would be late. Tender breasts arent a sure sign, and most of your other symptoms are pregnancy signs. But I normally had tender breasts with PMS but not at all with my pregnancy. Take a test, it will help you out alot.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	Yeah you definitely could be. <br>  <br>  Take a pregnancy test!<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|S4DNQkFraa	Sounds like you are to me, take a test because the sooner you know, the sooner you can get started on what you need to do. G/L!|`|AA11900069	FOR THE LOVE OF GAWD, HOW MANY TIMES will women ask on here "Am I PREGNANT?"!!!!!<br>  <br>     You buy a testing-kit, pee on it.  It tells you. <br>  <br>  We can't, ok?  We just can't.  We can't get you to pee into your computers' USB port, and then analyse your urine...  Go to the chemist or supermarket, and sort it all out.<br>  <br>      Good luck with that.|`|tUpvQbwGaa	I'm telling you now. my cycle was 40 some days long and i just found out that i'm about 6.5 weeks pregnant. I had all the same things as you but the spotting. i never did spot|`|BlA60kDVaa	Pregnancy is normal.<br>  <br>  Raise your child better than ever!|`|1z3C0R2Vaa	Sound like you are take a blood test good luck...............)
8lcNupM2aa	It is completely normal and yes it is a phase. My son is 11 months and he went through that phase where he would hit his head on his high chair.. then he went through one where he would shake his head "no" over and over.  I found out that the more I paid attention to him doing it the more he would do it. When I started ignoring him while he did it, it soon stopped.  <br>  <br>  Babies are funny and they will do all sorts of strange things at this age.. mine still sometimes hits the back of his head on the wall when we are in the bed and then he will look all strange.. I really think he just like the way it sounds or something.<br>  <br>  Anyway! Don't worry.. he's perfectly normal!|`|p2Njf5gBaa	I have seen and heard of many babies doing this, my son included.  Its pretty much a stage.  They learn a new thing, its a different sensation, and perhaps they even get your attention and a reaction from it.  He should grow out of this in short time.   <br>  Best thing you can do is pay it no attention and he will learn that it isn't that neat, and probably stop doing it.  My son did this for about a month.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	probably a phase, if you are worried call his doc and ask them if it is a 'phase' or if it could be a sign of a more serious problem..|`|AA11780203	My daughter used to do that. I took her to a specialist and they found that she was cognetive impaired. Take him to a specialist as soon as possible so he can get the help he needs.|`|3AoQBdI1aa	i would say take him to a doctor just to be safe an all. It's normal for most children but it may be something a little mor serious and you want to find out if it is bad right away|`|DoaMYpfMaa	i don't think that it is normal i would ask your pediatrician they would be able to help more.|`|YDol78ymaa	its pretty normal. my little guy is 19 months. he didn't start doing things like that until he was about a year. sometimes when he's angry he will bang his head..on walls, toys, the floor. anything he can do.<br>  <br>  its usually because they don't have the words to tell you what they want and get frustrated. <br>  <br>  if he's not hurting himself i wouldn't worry. of course you can always ask his pediatrician about it if your concerned.
JP2h62qiaa	You can get insulated cups. They sell them at walmart. you can also get a little freezer ice pack to keep it next to in the diaper bag. Gerber also makes insulated bags for food and cups. The strap on mine fastens with a button snap so I can snap it onto my diaper bag, nothing more to carry.    You can also take him a 4 ounce juice box to church with a sippy cup that has some water in it already to mix in the juice.  I just poke a hole in the JB and squeeze it into the sippy cup.  You can give him milk with his afternoon snacks on sundays, if you want to skip it for the trip.  You will find all kinds of neat tricks. It is cool to get different ones from people on here though. Good luck|`|EyKJ737daa	No way sweetie, don't go to so much trouble and creating more bags to lug around for yourself!!  If he is almost fully weened onto cows milk then buy yourself some of those little popper milks in the tetra packs.  They are fantastic.  I take them with me when we go out. They don't need refrigerating and still taste just fine, it's just that UHT (Ultra Heat Treated) milk.  My girls love a milk treat when we go out even to dinner.  Just open and pour into the desired drinking cup or bottle and baby is set to go. It's generally not cold either so it goes down better!  Good luck and all the very best.|`|m1RTNmqsaa	Im not sure about it sitting our, sorry. =/ I think Ive heard people talk about a hour or 2 before.<br>  <br>  Id go ahead and take the insulated bag just to be on the safe side.|`|HIskrREJaa	i use insulated sippy cups and put ice in them as well|`|8yTP3jO8aa	I guess I don't see it as a problem because I don't see any reason to ever need to transport milk like that.  I mean, it's just a drink, so while out running errands or to eat or whatever, water is perfect.  It doesn't go bad, doesn't create problems if spilled, and is super easy.  <br>  <br>  So, my question to you is "Does your baby/toddler actually need to drink milk while you're out?"  It's not a large portion of a baby's nutrition, and definitely not something that has to be given like formula, so I've found it's just super easy to leave the milk for home and give water to drink while out.<br>  <br>  But, milk generally has a 2-4 hour exposure time instead of 1 hour with formula.  WIC and most other places will say not to leave it out at temperatures between 41 degrees (F) and warmer for longer than 2 hours, but others say it's okay to be out for not longer than 4 hours provided it is in a super clean container that provides less opportunities for bacteria to grow.  Milk still is going to be high moisture, high protein, and low acid, though, making it a prime growing spot for bacteria.|`|8NBq70JPaa	Regular fresh milk is pastuerised to remove any food-poisoning bacteria, but food spoilage bacteria are still present in the milk. Generally I would not drink the milk if it was at room temp as it is not as nice, but in terms of spoilage there is no exact time as the temperature of the environment it is in makes a very big difference as does the initial load (amount) of bacteria in the milk. I would discard it after two hours just to be sure - although there would be no detectable off smells after this time in average conditions|`|HztriBPAaa	I was told by my biology teacher in the sixth grade that Milk can be left out for up to eight hours before it is dangerous to consume. Personally I would probably get some insulated containers or sippy cups. You could always put it in a thermos in the morning. By the way if your avatar is Noah he is adorable and thank your husband for his service. Good luck and god bless.|`|z6T7nznLaa	Milk doesn't last very long under room temperature.  If you plan on going to a restaurant, you could request milk, then pour it into the sippy cup.  If you do not plan on this, take the milk in an insulated container like a thermos, or with an ice pack.  These often last several hours, which will keep the milk fresh.|`|r4E2zXL8aa	It's pretty much just like formula... keep it cold until he wants to drink it. So bring an insulated bag or whateva they're called and keep it in there. Don't let it sit out any longer than 2 hours. Taste like crap after that and gets spoiled. =)|`|AA11600455	just puchase a whole bunch of those little milk to go bottles and take one along with you in a themos.|`|zPYyGw8oaa	You need the bag...they make great little ones everywhere now, and they are cheap too :)|`|kSEO2w8Aaa	pack a tiny cooler in your diaper bag|`|vLOjcH7paa	I'm sure he'll be ok. I know that warm milk is drunk in other countries...kids have strong immune systems! : )|`|KICQQxLxaa	<a href="http://www.horizonorganic.com/products/milk/single-serve.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.horizonorganic.com/products/m...</a><br>  <br>  Horizon Organic have the single serve milks that do not need to be refrigerated.  I use these for Hannah when we are going to be away from home for an extended period of time and I want her to have milk.  I just throw them in my diaper bag.<br>  <br>  For other times, Hannah either has a sippy of water or a sippy of juice/water mix whenever we go out.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	I usually fill a sippy cup when we leave the house,  and I let him drink out of it for up to about 3 hours.  He has never had a problem with it.  Considering its cold here,   I leave it in the car if he doesn't need it at one stop or another and it stays pretty cool.  <br>  <br>  During the summer its going to be a different story,  at that time I will probably just get one of those insulated Thermos containers and keep it cool in that, and then pour some into the sippy cup as needed.
pXSKSS3daa	Unfortunately you hear about this all too often. For the life of me I cannot begin to understand what goes through people's minds when they do something like this. I look at my son and I just cannot understand it.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't feel obligated to have Jaiden spend more time with her. You certainly CAN but don't feel as if you have to. Maybe you can set aside some time every week(when convenient for you) that you, Jaiden, and she can "hang out". Go for a walk, go to the park, a soft play area at the mall, her/your house. It may be good therapy for her.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Everything happens for a reason.For every choice, there is a lesson.<br>  <br>  And I do understand how someone can kill their child if they are killing themselves (Although I cannot understand why they do it out of spite) it is difficult to explain.|`|lGcpXteaaa	I could NEVER harm my child, my job is to protect her and i have to do my job!<br>  I guess you never know what goes on in some peoples head...sometimes (as a sufferer of depression) i can understand that you dont exactly think anything remotely logical but still, ending my childs life i know would not enter my head.<br>  Thats such a sad story :( <br>  <br>  I think you should make an effort for her to see Jaiden more, if it were me i would really appreciate that!<br>  <br>  Have a good weekend! x|`|pJiTbIpYaa	Wow, that is so heartbreaking. I guess for you it is harder now you know the truth and i am sorry for that. I would just say to this woman that she is welcome to spend time with you and Jaiden whenever she wants. I am sorry i really don't know what to say. I guss the most important thing is for her not to know that you know what happened back then. It may make her feel uncomfortable around you and Jaiden if she knew you knew. Good luck.|`|xRZ1PRZwaa	It sounds like there was a serious mental illness issue, and I'm so sorry that she went through what she did. A parent can never recover from such a loss.<br>  <br>  Being around your daughter is most likely a real treasure for her. Being around you and your husband is most likely quite nice too! I'd be sure to invite her to your barbeques and to visit every once in a while.<br>  <br>  You're a very nice friend!|`|b0567ce2ec94aad1068db86dfdd2c890aa	I personally think, you should be reasonable about the amount of time u spend with her, but maybe its a chance for her to open up to you. <br>  <br>  Who knows?|`|HFWLYMD6aa	It's a very sad story, but i wouldn't overdo it with having your daughter around her cause he could bring back the memories of her deceased child and make her sad.|`|MeYILJeSaa	Oh wow. That's horrible. That just makes me sick. I don't understand how anyone could take the life of their own child. I just don't get it. I think of something happening to Graham, and it just makes me want to throw up. I would die if anything happened to him. I can't imagine being the wife/mother-that must be just awful. I'm a Christian too, and it just doesn't seem right when these kind of things happen. I guess this is the kind of situation where you have to have peace that passes understanding. As hard as that is.<br>  About seeing Jaiden, I'm sure she would love it-especially since she already enjoys seeing her. I don;t know how well you know her, but I might say something like, "If this gets to be hard for you, let me know. I can't imagine being in your situation." It's difficult to think of something to say sometimes.|`|PA7LOoQ9aa	that is a horrible situation.  i would say yes you should go around her more but i wouldnt always let it be about her spending time with your kid. bc it could sadden her more as well. you never know. if nothing else you be there for her. be a friend and ear and someone to hang out with, and allow her to decide about how much to be around your kid. its a great idea , but its tough too because i know if i were her it may sadden me and make me depressed to see or play with others kids and knowing mines not here anymore.  god bless, be safe. my bro is police officer and i here alot of stories!!! alot of officers dont think twice of others they just do their job but its good knowing that you have a heart.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	since i am sure she probably knows where you work, i wouldn't go overboard with visiting and hanging out suddenly; if u want to do it, start slow and as u become better friends, then you will naturally spend more time together...if u all of the sudden start trying to spend a lot of time with her, she may figure out that you have come across the info that u have....and u don't want that...if she decides at some point to tell u that's diff, but  u don't want her to feel that you have been snooping or her privacy has been invaded...
5rrK4o5raa	i just did you body weight mass and your in normal range!<br>  dont worry about it sista, your fine :) but if you want to loose weight and get good grades why not do both at the same time .. go to the gym and bring a book get on the tred mill and study instead of watch tv! drink only water my friend drank only water for lent last year and lost 15 pounds in what 6 weeks.|`|1gVDZrPuaa	Just do the homework and workout, it's not that hard to do, I'm pretty sure there is enough time for both.|`|H0sPCJQPaa	Play sports at your school :)<br>  <br>  Imma genius :)|`|vj3WSxzWaa	Well,you dont look overweight or anything,and you are young,so you will grow into your so called "baby fat"<br>  But,if you want to drop some weight,,,I suggest eating better,eat healthy for breakfast and snack on fruit and veggies,as well as walking and other exercise,,,maybe study for 30 mins and then take a break to work out for 20,then go back to hitting the books!<br>  I really would worry about the school grades before the weight unless you are at an unhealthy weight,,but it is fairly easy to manage to do both,,just dont push yourself to hard,or you will wear yourself out,and do worse in school!<br>  Drink lots of fluids,and get lots of rest,eat well,and exercise,but dont over do the work outs and burn yourself out!<br>  Good luck!|`|I64JOuMKaa	YO YAWL !..<br>  sorry i just had to mimick you LOL!<br>  <br>  anyways<br>  DUUDE i seriously don't think you're fat<br>  and p.s why don't you switch middle schools?<br>  <br>  anyways, what about studying everyday afterschool until 6, go for a run around the block 5 times, come home eat dinner, study until bed time?<br>  <br>  or walk/run home, study and run after dinner<br>  or come home, study while doing crunches<br>  or or , come home, run around the block , go home and study , eat<br>  <br>  watch what you eat too,<br>  cut out the cookies, and the fatty meats, eat lots of fruits and vegtables and drink plenty of water :)<br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|Z7dShLRLaa	30 pounds is alot how much do you really weigh?Height also matter too.<br>  <br>  I dont think your as fat as you make your self seem.<br>  <br>  You arent fat!.<br>  You are normal.<br>  At 5'5" you should weigh 115-145 pounds >:@.<br>  <br>  I actually need tolose weight because i am 5'4" and 154 pounds D:.! im in the process of losing weight|`|9cQ4cxg1aa	You can easily do both. I am on a competitive dance team, plus track and cross country, and I also do Diamond Dolls. I don't get home until around 9 most nights. I get straight A's. I'm 13, 8th grade.<br>  <br>  I suggest working out at 4 and ending at 6. Then eat a light dinner, and do your homework afterwards. Limit your TV/computer time to one hour total. Read before bed. Go to the library (public, not school) and look in the adult nonfiction section. Seriously, you learn sooo much from there! Eat one sweet a day, and make sure it is not too much. For example, one medium sixed cookie is perfect to fulfill your sweet tooth quota for the day. Go vegetarian! Your body feels so much lighter, and meat packs a lot of calories. <br>  <br>  Some things you should do for your daily workouts:<br>  <br>  Yoga- I do yoga daily and love it! It is so relazing and therapautic. Here is an introduction to yoga <a href="http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/sequence_builder" rel="nofollow">http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/sequenc...</a><br>  <br>  Cardio- Go for a run! If you can't run outside or on a treadmill, there are several other things you can do. Jumping jacks, putting on a song and dancing, and aerobics are alternitaves to running. Here are several at home exercises you can do. <a href="http://exercise.about.com/library/blcardioblast.htm" rel="nofollow">http://exercise.about.com/library/blcard...</a><br>  <br>  Strenth training- The best way to build up muscle is to lift weights or use machines. If you have a gym membership, that's great! If not, there are some other things you could do. Push ups, sit ups, squats, and lunges are some examples of this. Here is a list of workouts you can choose from: <a href="http://exercise.about.com/od/beginnerstrengthtraining/Strength_Training_for_Beginners.htm" rel="nofollow">http://exercise.about.com/od/beginnerstr...</a><br>  <br>  A guide for your daily nutrition:<br>  <br>  Calories- I know people hate to count calories, but it really helps you. Make sure you write every little thing you eat down, including drinks and sauces. You should try to get 1400-1600 calories daily. Here is a great website that counts your calories for you. <a href="http://www.calorieconnect.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.calorieconnect.com/</a><br>  <br>  Breakfast- Make sure you eat breakfast! If you don't, your metabolism is less efficient. Plus, you'll have more cravings come lunchtime. If you skip breakfast, not only will you eat more at lunch, your body will store everything you eat as fat! Some breakfast ideas are half of a whole grain bagel with cream cheese and an orange, 2 egg white with a piece of whole wheat toast and apple juice, or a fruit smoothie.<br>  <br>  Lunch- Try to eat a healthy lunch that gives you energy. A turkey sandwich on whole wheat bread with lettuce and lowfat mayo, an apple, and a glass of milk would be good. Or a salad with light dressing, optional grilled chicken, lowfat cheese, and homeade croutons (not too many!) with grapes. Or a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, baked potato chips, and a small piece of dark chocolate. Try to make it healthy, yummy, and energizing all at the same time!<br>  <br>  Snack- One of my favorite afternoon snacks ever is one stalk of celery filled with peanut butter and topped with raisins. Its a real pick me up when you're running out of steam. You could also have carrots, an apple, or crackers and cheese.<br>  <br>  Dinner- Dinner is a dangerous time- you're more likely to splurge when you're tired at the end of the day. Try grilled fish, asparagus, a roll, and a glass of red wine. Or non breaded chicken wings and green peas. Be creative. If you have to have your sugar fix, try low fat ice cream.<br>  <br>  School:<br>  Okay, this is a tough one for me. I've never really had to work hard at school, and I don't study that much. But one tip- always do your homework! Sometimes I shrug it off too, but it is very important. Listen in class and get a good night sleep. You'll pay attention better that way. Take notes, even when they're not required. Review what you did in class 10 minutes each day per subject, on top of your homework and studying for tests. Ask the teacher when you're confused- don't just sit there not knowing what you're doing! Read a lot. I learned everything I know from books, and I go to the public library weekly. Reading is an aquired taste; once you start doing it more I guarantee you'll love it.<br>  <br>  As for hating school:<br>  Why exactly do you hate it? Do the kids pick on you? Could you pleace specify so I can further evalauate your situation?|`|obzOgcaPaa	Dont worry about fittin in with the crowd. Just be yourself and you'll find people that like you for you. And as for school that comes first, trust me you dont wanna be behind and when it comes time for a party you're stuck catching up on work. And to lose weight just eat right and make sure you exercise, just cut out the unnecessary stuff.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|w69QiAqOaa	sign up for a gym class. i took a "real" not a blow off...im getting sooooo much stronger, and its helping my GPA (really important in high school)<br>  <br>  your goal should probably also be more oriented towards "avoiding health problems" rather than comparing to "bikini" models...just sayin.|`|Xkl1Ukpraa	Motivation and self-control.<br>  That's it.<br>  And it's not like you're 5' 300 pounds. You're actually pretty normal.|`|abELhjcoaa	those same people that taunt you have numerous insecurities, theres no need for you to have any cause youre fine, and your true friends will also think so too.
AusPef8Yaa	That happened to me too, once.<br>  Your cycle is probably a little irregular still. It'll get back on track soon so don't worry.|`|fa571b1e23d4b992ac1d5df0e55b19a3aa	STD. haha nah, im just messin with ya......unless you've had sex. then it might be an STD. <br>  But if you haven't had sex then im sure its just a stray blood clot. no worries.Your period doesn't come if your stressed of malnourished.|`|Q08GpskDaa	If you have only had your period for a while, its normal for it to be irregular. As for the brown blood, its also normal, its just old blood that has built up.|`|AA12069058	Its just spotting from your hormones being a littleout of whack. Just see if it continues to happen.If it does you might want to get on birth control to help regulate it.Good Luck ?
J6vd8Gsbaa	Don't give him hot sauce. Spank him if you have permission and if he back talks wash his mouth out with soap. (don't use concentrated just use bar soap)<br>  Tyffannie|`|NAzAmFDnaa	I think his behavioral issues are more in depth than something a one-time punishment from an uncle will correct.  His parents have dropped the ball somewhere.  He needs consistency, solid rules and solid consequences that are inforced every time he misbehaves.  You can explain to him about what appropriate behavior is and how his behavior is inappropriate.  Then you can explain to him about consequences.  For example, since he was naughty towards you tonight, he should lose the privelage of playing with toys or watching TV in the morning when he wakes up.  After he shows appropriate behavior, he can earn a toy or TV show.  Kids thrive in stable environments where they know what is expected from them.  I think his issues are deeper than something hot sauce will fix.|`|FiUprYsvaa	Don't let him play with the toys tomorrow. <br>  If he doesn't want to put them away then he won't play with them.|`|in7qi4oZaa	Just give him a little spanking.|`|QM6wiVtVaa	If you had time to type this, punishment won't really at this point. Too much time has passed and I'm sure he has his mind on something else, and completely forgot about picking up after himself.|`|X5H8RHH1aa	Well not now after this time has passed but if he acts up again shout at him sternly and make him sit on the bottom step on the stairs for 2 mins. when he has calmed down talk to him and explain why you did this. If he doesn't stay on the step for 2 mins keep putting him back there without a word until he stays there for the time you told him. He will soon learn who is boss. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|iZfHSwi3aa	Is this the same nephew who's mom "made his a** glow like a flashlight"?  I think you are a little too interested in punishing kids.
zQAWuMN4aa	Not yet anyway. My daughter went down rather peacefully. It's just getting her to stay that way is another story when Daddy isn't home. He is in the Air Force Nat'l Guard & goes to a base one weekend a month. The last time he left she puked. The time before that she just wouldn't sleep! She was playing with my nose after her bottle so I decided to put her in her crib. Right now she's talking to herself. It's 7:30pm in Ohio.|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	My daughter was, she's 7 weeks old. It's now 00:47 and she's finally drifting off.... yay, i'm so tired!!|`|oF2kOKlnaa	Our six month old son gave us a bit of a work out last night.

Sometimes a year or two older.. but never younger.<br>  I was in a shop the other day, and this lady came to me and said: ''Excuse me, ma'am, but do you have this in size....'' XD That was awful. <br>  <br>  And there was also this homeless man two years ago who came to me, told me his name, told me he was homeless and asked if I could provide him a roof above his head, oh my god.. So I asked him: ''Sir, have you even asked about my age?'' He answered: ''No, how old are you?'' I said I was thirteen. <br>  <br>  Three days later I encountered the same man on the very same spot, and he asked the very same thing.|`|b2ef69c67e136d3bdd82ab0851201d08aa	People asked me if I was a Freshman in high school.

Lots of pleasant company, lots of great food and drink, lots of opportunity to take candid photos of everyone. <br>  <br>  Today was a warmish day (got up into high 50's) and I looped past the beach on the way home to at least see some sun even though it was a little windy. <br>  <br>  The only downer was while going to the party as I stopped at a traffic light driving through the rundown city of Lynn on the way to an adjacent beach town someone shot out my driver's side window.|`|EtTddxAqaa	hello little girl.

tbeO3Lataa	I have had to do that many times. Walking into a BBQ restaurant in a dress and three-inch heels? Kind of weird.<br>  <br>  The key is to own it. Know you look good, and nicely dressed, and the use it! Do the catwalk strut, LOL. No, but seriously, no one else will notice you're overdressed if you don't feel overdressed.<br>  <br>  And no, that sounds fine! Have lots of fun!|`|Q08GpskDaa	Nope, that sounds fine. I am so jealous of you for getting to see it. Have fun, it is amazing.|`|9OdrWhRRaa	OMG.<br>  I love Wicked.<br>  I saw it.<br>  BTW, do you live in Melbourne?<br>  I do. :)<br>  <br>  Hmmm.

Get some cute accessories and dont forget a jacket!  <br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|y1lmY4mXaa	hmm i saw wicked a couple of weeks back when i was in london<br>  <br>  its not really my thing (:<br>  <br>  that would be fine.<br>  <br>  anything would be ok as long as you feel comfortable in it. :)|`|nzyOCsOiaa	no, in NY I saw people walking around in full out ball gowns.<br>  No idea why...<br>  you'll look pretty when you watch.|`|vLOjcH7paa	I wore dress pants and a nice top...|`|WSwkPljYaa	Lucky, You get to see Wicked! :D<br>  <br>  I saw it in NYC last year, and it was amazing. I wore a nice shirt, skirt, and heels, but I also saw people there in ripped jeans and t-shirts. I think its fun to dress up for theater.|`|ElJetpDTaa	I wore skinny jeans, a nice top and heels. Just wear whatever you are comfortable in, that doesn't mean a lounge look though.
2irmTjQ3aa	You should not be worried abut std's and that stuff... you should leave him now. How can you allow him to cheat on you while you are pregnant??|`|21Lnhdfeaa	It might simply be an old condom.  Have you thought about talkign to him about it?|`|MqFeJiukaa	If you are going through his wallet and have a feeling he is cheating then you need to sit down and decide if you want to be with him.  If you do not trust your partner then you don't have a good relationship.  Things will just continue to get worse.  Esp if you guys go through eachothers wallets looking for evidence of cheating.  I have never even thought about going through my husbands wallet even if he was there.<br>  Good Luck|`|m2aznd8xaa	you need to confront him about it. your carring his child so he should be home with you not partying.if he isnt gonna grow up  than he aint being a good role modle for your child and if you dont want that than you need to really think about your relationship with him. you shouldnt be going through this kind of stress at all. shame on him. if he cant straighten up than you need to let him go hun. and dont give him any if he is cheating it can have a big affect on you and the baby if he gives you an std.  good luck to you.|`|xq7S9H5Raa	women's instincts are strong.  If you feel that he is cheating then he is.  I had a gut feeling one time and surely I was on point.  If you want more proof than watch him.  Men are stupid and eventually he will be caught.|`|AA10458750	I don't want to upset you with my answer....but as a been there, done that...if you are having ANY feelings that he is beign unfaithful, he probably is. You don't realize, but your female intution is a special gift you were born with, you just have to listen to it. The reason you found the condom was to let you see for yourself. Next, it will only get worse in the future, you will catch him in the act or see him somebody else and it will hurt you so bad. The point is, get out of the relationship now and allow yourself to heal before the baby comes. You don't need all the drama, lies or pain that guy is gonna cost u.|`|EOIxLhBxaa	Confront him. I also found one in my bf's wallet and he said sometimes he likes to use one alone or with me, though we don't use them. I don't think he ever used them with anyone but it still pissed me off and he's not allowed to have them in his wallet. I think it's disgusting.|`|dcNmRPGPaa	shame on him for putting more stress on the baby!<br>  confront him, I would. You're giving your body carrying his kid and he can't respect that SMH|`|fUK9y3Qkaa	You dont need that stress right now. Leave him alone.|`|ZLsWyPn8aa	Leave him. You're better off.|`|7zMtmKJaaa	if you are positive he is cheating, leave him|`|hORVMOHKaa	dump him and then file for child support after the baby is born|`|3Sr2FgRfaa	The wallet being left is weird for a guy. Pretty good chance he was going somewhere with an ATM inside that would tempt him to spend more money than he wanted to spend: a casino, some bars, a strip club. Also, does he have a ring pattern worn into his wallet from the condom? If not, it's possible someone pushed it on him and he put it there -- there are other explanations. <br>  <br>  You need to ask him about the condom. He may have a completely innocent answer, so be ready to accept that if he comes right out with it. If he beats around the bush, I'd be assuming he was planning on beating around some other bushes, if you get my drift.<br>  <br>  It is time for the where-are-we-going talk. Y'all are having a BABY; the commitment of marriage is sort of secondary to that commitment. Time for a ring!|`|AA11831450	Well if the condom wasn't there 2 months ago, and you are obviously not going to get pregnant so he doesn't need it for you, he is either getting prepared to cheat or has done it. The good things are... if he just went out and bought condoms recently preparing to cheat - the one you found wouldn't be expired so it is an old condom. It may be the only one he had. Next, He didn't take it with him! It is possible he is considering cheating but hasn't done it yet. Cheating is a great way to end or ruin a good relationship. It is time you had a serious "where are we going" talk. You need to get a committment or a moving company. Your baby needs a Mommy that is not sick from worry wondering where her man is and who he is with every time he is out of the house. Get your questions answered ASAP. I hope he has been faithful. Congratulations on your baby

You can get saline drops (salt water) and put them in your nose then blow to get some of the mucus out of your nose.   If you can't get drops, you can make your own salt water with 8 oz of warm water and 1/4 tsp salt.

I did however at 3 months introduce oatmeal mixed with formula. They have a feeder with a larger hole for this. It was very easy and worked well. I also gave them a little mashed potatoes about that time and gradually worked up to more solid foods. My last child had a cast iron stomach and she even enjoyed stuff like ice cream and many other soft foods at an early age. The more solid food they eat, the sooner they sleep all night which is wonderful when this becomes the normal. At 8 months they were all on milk from the store, cold from the refrigerator, because they were eating so well from the table. I did not use a spoon too much until they got older, it was just too darn messy. And by then they were old enough to feed themselves pretty well.

He eats again around noon, at 4pm, and dinner is at 8pm right before bedtime. <br>  <br>  At each meal he gets 1 jar of food at 4 oz. Sometimes, I will subsitute his jar for a 4 oz. cup of baby yogurt. Then he eats an 8 oz. bottle of oatmeal cereal and formula.<br>  <br>  This has worked well for us, and it is what our doctor recommended. But, every baby is different -- just like you said! :)<br>  <br>  I hope you find something that works for your little one!|`|3AoQBdI1aa	6oz just about and every 3hrs.|`|c23e2e9ba321447351d3dc720a353187aa	My son is breastfed so I don't know how much of that he gets but he only eats about an ounce or less of solid food a day.  He'll be 8 months on the 20th.|`|BMfn0D9gaa	My daughter just turned 8 months old today and her doctor says she needs at least 24 oz. of formula per day and however much baby food, as long as they get their required 24 oz.  My daughter has had many ear infections, which I believe has made her eat less, so she really only takes about 4-5 bottles and baby food when she wants it.  She's not a big eater like she was before all the ear infections.

I dont like the name Lillian but love Lily. Just as i like the name Victoria but dont like Vicky.<br>  <br>  Both are nice names, but i like the way Victoria looks as well :)|`|dwrDfQdKaa	Lillian !<br>  <br>  Because When Your Baby Girl Grows Up Especially Round The 15 / 16 Age She Wud Like To Develop A Sense Of Style Round Her Name. && Lillian Can Be Spelt  Differenaly And Shortened Nicely :) <br>  Good Luck Wiv Everything<br>  && Congratulations!<br>  <br>  ?

I'm planning to name my future daughter Lillian, it's been my favorite name since I was a little girl. She'll probably be called Lilly for short although I just love the name Lillian so maybe not.. .|`|fZGcufB7aa	I absolutely love both names. If I had to choose, I would choose Victoria because you can shorten it to Tori and I think that is so adorable. I like Lily too, but Tori is cuter to me.|`|IuzaNq2Uaa	I think Lillian is slightly prettier and more feminine.|`|fD1ZJsUaaa	Victoria.|`|H0sPCJQPaa	Lillian|`|XCgmsEsZaa	Victoria
UcgWrGaAaa	Funny that this question should show up in baby and newborn.  <br>  <br>  Anyway, yeah, know that the condom failure rate is 86% even when used properly.<br>  <br>  Also, in my experience the best way to bore a bf is to have sex with them.  Seems paradoxical but boys tend to get bored with what they already have.<br>  <br>  Does he have a job in the event that you get pg?  <br>  <br>  Did you know that you can get several different STDs even WITH a condom including herpes, genital warts and crabs.<br>  <br>  Sex is definitely about bonding, are you ready for the broken heart when he tells you goodbye?  How many times do you really want to experience it? <br>  <br>  You know, sex is over rated especially when it comes to fly by night partners.  I have to say that it only gets good for us women when our partner really gets to know us...unfortunately it takes a real man to give you your cookie before he takes his.  If you do it you are going to wonder why you did it the next day, your virginity is one time.  Did he say that he loves you.  Have you ever heard the saying that boys will give love to get sex and girls will give sex to get love.  <br>  <br>  It's not a toy, and it is definitely not for children.|`|w3ob12X6aa	yeah dont have sex at all, just wait how long have you been dating him if its not really long and you dont plan on being with him its not worth it|`|r4N3R0dtaa	Make sure your 100% ready. If you have any doubts or fears, make sure you address them with your boyfriend. If you're still concerned or worried even after you talk to your boyfriend, it never hurts to wait a bit longer to have sex.|`|AA11600455	good luck. just in case the condom breaks, buy the morning after pill to take just in case. light some scented candles and use silk sheets. play romantic classical music|`|vLOjcH7paa	Don't do it!|`|RkjOxucAaa	don't do anything your not ready for
8lrozLcVaa	Its pretty!!!|`|hORVMOHKaa	there a singer named Ami lee (may be spelled differently though) but it is cute|`|yvMmTEOCaa	I like it but people are going to think its because of Amy Lee from Evanescence|`|HdiNycsNaa	That's cute! When I read it fast, it sounded like a really unique first name. :)|`|9Ypxwuxbaa	no not realy..|`|jpTl3o5naa	It's okay but why spelled Ami instead of Amy? Just want to be different? Just wondering. Lee can be a male or female name.|`|UUktAQlGaa	thats my sisters name! but its spelled Amy Leigh .. i like your spelling too though|`|KOcCenrEaa	reminds me of the girl from evanescence.<br>  <br>  Aimee to me is the best spelling.<br>  Lee is an okay but safe middle name.|`|6yD5k9Azaa	i don't really like it.<br>  but theres a german name Aveline (av-ah-leen) that kinda sounds like those names put together. that's one of my favortie names.|`|hrRh0CqNaa	Plain|`|o9Ckf0h4aa	very popular/common! But, yes I do like it!

So of course i love it! (also, have you considered Kaiser?) If its pronounced like Keiran, i dont really like it, sorry.<br>  <br>  Oh and Parker is a really cool middle name.<br>  <br>  ? Bee|`|UbCzA2JVaa	It's pretty nice. I would prefer Parker Kryan Harris.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  :)|`|4mSpN3Rxaa	i love it!|`|5Dr5cvkwaa	well it reminds me of the japanese beer (Kirin)|`|vgQBoU4Uaa	I don't like the first name, sorry, <br>  but Parker is a cute middle name! =]|`|Tmr7f3Xgaa	It's OK if you want an OK name.

r7q8LW7Aaa	The motorbike... that damn motorbike...<br>  Anything to do with that thing makes my blood boil. He spends most of his free time in the garage - dry humping it most likely, I don't know what else he could be doing for all that time. I sometimes call it names when he's not listening and I'v even kicked it a few times. I hate it...<br>  Anyway, he now needs to spend ￡100 on a new tyre for it. There's my pet peeve!|`|j2mRop0laa	He is never in a hurry and I'm always in a hurry. He makes me late for everything. He considers 15 minutes to 30 minutes late "on time." He moves at a slower pace than a snail and it is the brunt of most of our spats. I am the most impatient person on the planet and that is HIS pet peeve.|`|s8VgyzE2aa	mine is that my husband tries to use our kitchen table as a desk and then leaves for work and doesn't put all his stuff (laptop, checking book, bills, papers, pens etc...) away. He works second shift so he is not home at dinner time so I constantly have to clean up all his crap so I can actually serve dinner at the dinner table. <br>  <br>  I finally got him to buy one of those small laptops they sell thinking that would be better and he could just keep it at the side of the table and the big one can just stay in the closet. Nope, NOW I have TWO laptops on the kitchen table, a big one and a little one so it just added to the clutter which by the way, if you know me, you know clutter does not exist in my world! LOL<br>  <br>  wow that felt good, thanks for letting me vent :)|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	MOST of all I'd have to say his love of everything video games and gaming....he's gotten better since I met him and fell in love with him..but I could honestly do without his PSP, his online games, and his fantasy "siumlation" baseball game and have him want to pick up a book and read something <br>  <br>  I'd love for us to get a Wii to use as a family, but everything else can just go.|`|jLYTKr33aa	First, I'll answer for my husband.  I'll admit that I'm guilty when it comes to the TV on habit.  I also will leave every cabinet open while I'm cooking, and then go back 15 minutes later to close them all.  If my husband beats me to the kitchen before I have the chance to close all of the cabinets, he jokes that we must have a poltergeist in the house.<br>  One of my husband's annoying habit is leaving lights on all over the house when we're out.  He also is terrible when it comes to forgetting to lock the door, which I can't stand!  I ask him if he locked the door, and he'll say he thinks he did.  I'll then go check, only to find that he didn't lock it.|`|AA10199093	My wife and I have a "War of the Roses" type relationship and she cuts me while I'm sleeping with an exacto-knife.  I'm a very sound sleeper and she doesn't cut that deeply, but she cuts me and puts neosporin on it.  A few days later the cut heals, scabs and starts to itch incessantly.  We're constantly trying to out-do each other without causing serious damage, but I'm afraid that one day one of us is going to go too far, so I would suggest you ease up on the TV peeve.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	Gosh I can only say one....It would have to be that he is so slow I really think he is part turtle, I'm dressed and have our son dressed and he is barely getting out of bed. Sigh so now I wake him up twenty mins early and tell him its the time he wanted me to wake him up so then he is sorta ready by the time we are. Hehe|`|Q7jMH5praa	My husband blames me for everything. He misplaced his jump drive not to long ago and blamed me for it. I didn't even touch the thing and I'm somehow supposed to know what he did with it. He'll leave a plate in our bedroom floor and I'll step on it and he'll look at me like it's my fault when he is the one that left it there in the first place. UGH!!|`|ki3XY49daa	My biggest thing is only a "thing" because he does it knowingly.  My husband will walk in the bedroom, stand right beside the hamper, strip and leave his dirty clothes right in front of said hamper.  It drives me up the wall.  He's been doing it for ten years.  I don't imagine he'll stop doing it either..LOL|`|9776485a7510046fa4388cd98356e6d6aa	Im am 30weeks pregnant and I hate how my b/f of 8 years says "Your belly is getting so big !" I feel fat as is I am normally 117 pounds and I weigh 128-131 pounds depending on the day .<br>  Or how he has been "too tired for loving" and falls asleep .|`|IU4uNH97aa	I hate that my husband is so indecisive, can never narrow down anything He likes everything to remain open but that's only when it comes to things about himself or the simpler things in life that you can chose within 2 minutes he takes about 10 min, like what he wants to eat. Decisions about real things he pretty set on and after will not change his mind ! No wonder we don't have a name for this baby picked yet ....<br>   <br>  I hate when he leaves the toilet paper roll empty, but the new roll of toilet paper is on the cabinet or he takes one out but just leaves it on top of the toilet it just takes like 10 seconds ! But he does this more often now considering i can barely bend over anymore !|`|xVEqBjDVaa	My husband has this big phobia or something about food in bed...when we first got married, he had never lived with someone else beside his parents, and even through college he was by himself. He's weird like that. So a few weeks after we are married and we are living in this apartment, i climb into bed with a big whopping bowl of vanilla ice cream drizzled with chocolate syrup and whip cream...and he takes one look at me, and FREAKS OUT! He was like," i don't think that's going to work lauren. Not in my bed, no way! Go in the kitchen with that, you are going to be washing sheets if you spill that!" We got in the biggest argument that night over FOOD! Lol. We finally agreed that i wouldn't eat in the bed if it was something that left crumbs or i didn't have a towel. He said that when he looks at me eating food in bed, he see's food everywhere...and like he's sleeping in food. Lol, i don't get it...he's silly.<br>  <br>  Edit: Opps! I read the question wrong! Ah, i thought u meant THEIR biggest pet peeve. But my biggest pet peeve is when i fold all his laundry and he throws it in different directions looking for one shirt. Argh! lol|`|b6EyFLgUaa	There is a few, my biggest one is he doesn't cut his toe nails so at night he just cuts up my ankles It drives in insane and is so GROSS. My other one is his memory, he can go up stairs to get something for our daughter, and come back down with out it completely forgetting what it is that he went up there for. The last one is that he has very selective hearing. I can be yelling at him, like our daughter is doing something wrong and im scrubbing the floor, and he just doesn't hear me at all.|`|58X0RRPgaa	When he hogs the blankets! I mean, I love him to death and I want him to be warm, but seriously? He doesn't mean to...he's out cold when he does it, but he is much bigger than me! He's a man! I can't get those blankets back from him! And I wake him up in the middle of the night..."Can I pleeease have some blankets?" And he smiles and we cuddle...so he makes up for the cold air, I suppose! Hahahaa!|`|bImlg171aa	When he says, "What?"  EVERY TIME I say anything. Like, I'll say, "Hun, do you know where my keys are?" he says, "huh?" I say, "My keys? Where are they?" He says, "What?" <br>  <br>  I HATE repeating myself hahaha!|`|kM3t3iDsaa	His lack of self happiness/confidence.<br>  <br>  He has put a little weight on, and it is effecting him. It honestly annoys me. I still see him as the sexy hunky man I knew 10 years ago, and I love him dearly. But I am sick of telling him, I am not going to leave him.|`|AA10626566	My old lady gets all excited because occasionally I will suddenly wake up, grab the 45 off the night stand and scan the perimeter.|`|hneeLWfCaa	His chewing.  The loud smacking noise, when his tongue hits the roof of his mouth.  Drives me crazy!!!|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	Mine is that my husband constantly leaves his clothes lying all over the bedroom and bathroom floors.  Wherever he takes them off is where they stay until I come along and pick them up.  Dang that irritates the crap outta me! LOL|`|TQW5E6olaa	I hated it when he left the tv on, because he'd watch DVDs and the title menu (which replays every 5 or 10 minutes) music would invade my sleep and my dreams and sometimes nightmares would become choreographed to the music.<br>  <br>  Also, he had to have his crap everywhere, something of his covering every surface in the house, drove me crazy.

i6mydMOyaa	Yup!  Mine definitely does hurt too!!<br>  <br>  In fact, I can feel the gas long before it's ready to come out!  It hurts for like 2 minutes!!!  Always in the same spot too!<br>  <br>  My mom gets mad when we're out and I have to let one go, she wishes I would hold it...but with the pain it causes, I hold for no one!<br>  <br>  And honestly, in bed at night my husband and I usually have a few giggles with how many come when I finally lay down and relax!!! It's quite entertaining!|`|lvGSEvjSaa	Mine does the same thing, it's like alot of pressure and makes your stomach hurt. But once you relieve yourself it's alot better huh...lol!|`|VHJ6Jp5qaa	all 3 pregnancy's it was nasty but preggo farts are normal and yes sometimes my tummy did hurt!!!|`|vWb8fquvaa	Oh yea!

pXSKSS3daa	Doubtful. Those didn't even really work for my son when he was teething.<br>  <br>  It's hard to tell if they are REALLY teething are just having an off day. Go ahead and treat for teething.|`|c4e0f4398cbb2577d252628c76d0781baa	Honestly, I seriously doubt it - especially b/c they are homeopathic.|`|OgzHcNMsaa	I don't understand why you would give a baby something for something he doesn't have. Would you give your baby cold medicine if he didn't have a cold?|`|7jXChfBNaa	no it wouldn't harm him...they are all natural and homeopathic...|`|OI3bf4yjaa	I highly doubt it.|`|AA11134717	no I don't think they would it says that they are made all natural.
Ybo6HS8Caa	Hmm, I don't think so.  I know that adults can sell their bodies to science if they wish, they just have to have it put into legal documentation that after they pass away, and after the family has the servcies (if that's what they want), then the body can be taken to whatever facility it was sold to.  I don't think parents can do this with their children though, because it isn't their body to sell, it's the childs, and a minor cannot legally enter into a contract, so I don't think it would happen.|`|VKy89MoGaa	Yes, but unfortunately today's kids are lazy, and lack manners. So, you probably won't fetch enough to make it worth your while.....|`|4712f79c3b66a688114af1fc7e707671aa	I'm not sure if you can or not, but you ARE legally bound to do what's best for them, so maybe if selling them is what's best, you could pull it off.<br>  You could also try the Black Market, I'm sure there's a way to sell kids there. XD|`|AA12145826	Well, I think you can, but not on Ebay.....they have that whole "no body parts" clause (you might be able to find a loop hole by stating that you are selling the WHOLE body and not just parts).|`|T3BXC8qXaa	No, but you can make threats...lol<br>  <br>  It's illegal to sell another human, you can give a child up for adoption. I don't think science wants children....too much work!|`|nrqWwQBXaa	why would we want to sell our kids that is sad that you even asked that?|`|WjxEsxTpaa	In China yes, but in the US i believe so, though I have never heard of anyone doing such a thing here. If they don't want a baby they can give a baby up for adoption.|`|tkAcXWMHaa	I guess you could, but who would want to sell a child? I sure wouldn't. I don't have any kids, but when I do, I will try to be the best dad that I can! :-)|`|V8Ybetq4aa	yes, it is legal to sell your children. the legal document is the birth certificate|`|95FH48Q6aa	well i know in china you can<br>  but in the u.s you can't<br>  hey it be like<br>  Buy one get one free <br>  ~~50% off your next child|`|KSUPtqCaaa	Only in a Monty Python movie...|`|34vGrrVwaa	I tried, but nobody would buy them.|`|9emPPFTOaa	yup, at your garage sale|`|aVY52WDgaa	What an awful thought!!!
46cd2ca02c07674e58e26d9c11367762aa	It is normal. Thats one of the things of pregnancy I find so weird. Of all the things to get swollen.. does it have to be that?? haha. <br>  It will go back to its normal shape and size when baby is here. The pressure and the weight of your baby down there causes swellings. Its very normal. <br>  Smile, its just another great thing that we pregnant women get to experience. ;0)|`|8ifHo5F3aa	im a little swollen too and im only 6 months...<br>  and if you look at my righ leg its awfull my ankle is not visible and i have veins all over popping out on my right leg and is so swollen that i cant even fit or buy shoes i just wear sandals bec whatever fits my left leg wont fit my right... im waiting to be over w. this pregnancy...<br>  I asked my doctor about the sweling and he said: oh you are okay..<br>  I guess they say this to everyone!<br>  Good luck !|`|D3RCNSGiaa	It's normal, don't be surprised if it gets a bit worse.  Yes, it will go away after delivery. This may be tmi, but women can get hemorrhoids at their vaginal opening late in pregnancy.  Hemorrhoids, the usual ones, are swollen inflamed veins caused by pressure.  You know you have pressure in your vagina, so....Best wishes.|`|5qRKH9ozaa	Yes, definitely normal.  I didn't experience it to a great degree with my first two, but this go round, I actually went in to my doc one day thinking "something" was falling out because it was right there at the opening.  That's just how swollen it has become for me....not a big ordeal though! =)|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	yep... and its embarrassing and uncomfortable on occasion. I asked the same question and they tell me not to worry and who else is going to be looking at it right? <Eyes rolling> I also have balloon ankles, my skin is discolored. I asked my doc will it be back to normal... I get  "Maybe" yeah thanks doc for the great support and help right???|`|AA10458750	I am a few weeks behind you and I just asked a question about this...lol...it is defiantly embarssing & something I wasn't expecting as none of the pregnancy books say anything about your privates turning into balloon animals! Find comfort knowing you are not the only one =)
46cd2ca02c07674e58e26d9c11367762aa	With my first pregnancy, right around the time you are now, I started having bp issues. They did the tests for pre eclampsia and there was nothing. They said I was borderline hypertension. It never went beyond that with her. I went 2 weeks overdue with no issues to the pregnancy at all. With my last 2 pregnancies, and this one I have had pregnancy induced hypertension with all of them. It didnt go any farther then that, and so far hasnt with this one either. They gave me medication to keep it stable and at a good level, and that works well. <br>  Keep your chin up,  you wont necessarily have pre eclampsia, and chances are a bit of medication will do great. Try not to worry.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	I had high blood pressure throughout my entire pregnancy.  I was tested for preeclapsia at every appointment I went to because of my blood pressure.  <br>  Other then my high blood pressure, everything was perfect for my pregnancy.   It never lead to preeclapsia,  in fact I ended up going two weeks overdue and ended up having to be induced.  High blood pressure doesn't always lead to complications.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck and hope everything works out for the best for you.<br>  <br>  Watch sodium intake,   take it easy, and avoiding stress are all ways to help keep your blood pressure down as well.|`|F8KmTbqjaa	I was diagnosed with Pre-Clampsia at 36 weeks.  I started to show high blood pressure at 20 weeks, it was pregnancy induced.  The good news for you is that only 8% of women who have high blood pressure in the third trimester will develop Pre-Clampsia.<br>  <br>  My symptoms were:<br>  *Severe head ache on the top of my head<br>  *Black flashes or spots in front of eyes when I would blink<br>  *Swollen feet,face and hands<br>  *Protein in my urine<br>  *Dizzy spells when I could stand up<br>  *I felt very confusing about things Example:  I was in the shower and forgot what I was doing and how I got there.  I sat in the tub for 30 minutes until my husband came and got me!<br>  *I just felt off in general<br>  *My blood pressure stayed at 165/90 <br>  <br>  Good Luck and I hope you don't develop it!|`|dR4QN0gHaa	I had high blood pressure with my first and was watched for preeclampsia but never developed it. With my second, my blood pressure was normal the entire time but at about 34 weeks I tested positive for protein in my urine. I did a couple 24 hour urine tests and was told that I had preeclampsia. The doctor decided to induce a few weeks later. When I had preeclampsia my blood pressure never got very high, I just had headaches, protein in my urine and severe swelling.|`|a095159fe0597a1cbcdff915d247b333aa	My blood pressure went up during pregnancy as well.  They were watching it pretty closely but it didn't turn into preeclampsia.  I did, however, pretty much have to be home and off my feet for the last month.  Not strict bedrest, but I had to be on very light activity.|`|OBuzcIDbaa	I had high blood pressure too, but no preeclampsia. Hang in there and try to relax. The more you worry, the higher your blood pressure can go up.|`|m2aznd8xaa	yea i went thruogh it with my second pregnancy and  my blood pressure was a little high when i had my c section as well.   i was never diagnosed with preecclampsia  .before being realeased from the hospitl i was given low dose of blood pressure pill and at my two week postpartum  check up it was gone and dr said i could stop the pills but to always check my blood pressure.   excessive weight gain and stress can cause high blood pressure. im petite so i was just told to take things easy and not stress . anger and yelling can lead to high blood pressure and preeclampsia so just take it easy and try not to go over the limited  amount of weight. you should gain 26-30 lbs being the max during pregnancy so just eat healthy and relax. good luck to you.|`|3Sr2FgRfaa	I had high blood pressure -- really close to your measurements, in fact -- that did lead to preeclampsia. But as long as you stay on bed rest and take care of yourself, even preeclampsia isn't too bad.<br>  <br>  Eat lots of fresh dark-colored veggies (broccoli, tomatoes, peppers, etc.) and dark-colored fruits to help keep your b/p down, and drink plenty of water. Ask the doctor about exercise. The blood pressure doesn't lead to preeclampsia by itself, but if you can keep it down and it's being caused by something leading to preeclampsia, you can keep the icky disease from developing. And make sure you never, ever miss a doctors appointment. Preeclampsia is a stealth disease, so if it does develop you can get sick in a matter of hours.

tEEB5339aa	By now he should def. be on jar food, some have even had little bits of table food by now. He is probably nursing so long because he is hungry, and the meals of just breastmilk aren't satisfying him. Sometimes, babies don't catch on to rice cereal and jarred food as well or as quickly as others. Every baby is different. Try a little bit of rice cereal or oatmeal cereal mixed into a bottle of breastmilk or formula. After that, you can always introduce him to jars by pouring a jar of food into his bottle and mixing it up with breastmilk or formula. Let him take to that at first and then try spoon feeding. The most important thing to remember is to not give up. Keep trying and he will get it!|`|DDIBEvUTaa	he is 6 months, & sometimes 2 minutes, sometimes 2 hours(in the early morning)... i'm sure at your son's age he would make it clear to you if he weren't getting enough to eat.  He is probably just enjoying the comfort so he's taking his time.  It's normal for weight gain to slow down a bit as babies become more active.  <br>  : )|`|844afb426cc1a9cf5ec93ffd1311e2ebaa	He could be latching and using you as a pacifier, which in my case its fine for me, as for not eating as much, thats fine since food takes longer to digest, he doesnt drink as much milk, some may call this baby led weaning, try feeding naturally fatty foods like avocado and egg plant, purred sweet potatos and oatmeal, are all filling and healthy.<br>  I would try to introduce a schedule when it comes to milk, feed him milk first thing in the morning, right before nap time, lunch time, before afternoon nap time, dinner, and bed time.And  feed solids in the morning, lunch and dinner meals. <br>  If he wants more milk in the day, give it to him, but if not thats ok too.|`|62ed2c415d781a32b672aaa388d79f43aa	at that age you need to offer more solid food my daughter only goes for 10-15 minutes and only 4-5 times in 24 hrs plus 3 solid meals and she is 9 months old.

f6qmRicQaa	If she hasn't finished school then she needs to stay in and finish.  One of the best tips I can give is for her to be informed.  Go out an get some child care and child development books.  Learn all you can about taking care of your child in every stage of it's life.  <br>  Also be dedicated.  Your child needs you to be consistent in your care for him or her.  They need the small things, the kiss goodnight for example.  Play with your kid.  Run, swing, dance and be silly with your him or her. <br>  Be resolved with the word no.  Never go back to yes once you've said no, NEVER!!! if you do it once they will see it as a chink in the armor and they will fight to get their way from then on. <br>   Be a firm disciplinarian, but never raise your hands or voice in anger.  A calm quiet mom getting down on their child's level is much more effective  <br>  This is a lifetime commitment.  If you love your child you will get it back unconditionally which is the best reward.|`|OCMq6FTdaa	i'm not a mom, but tell her to always let her kid now how much she loves them, lots of hugs, kisses, i'm proud of yous, good jobs and i love yous. Don't let them get away with crap, but pick your battles as they get older. DO talk to your kids about EVERYTHING. when they do something right or wrong, talk about it, check in with them daily to see how their lives are going.NEVER judge your kid, and never punish them when they admit to something or they won't tell you anything. respect them and their opinions. Most of all, if their is one thing you instill in them is that you love them NO MATTER WHAT, and will never judge them.|`|PBI3tCKaaa	Parenting is a tough but rewarding full time job.

5saz2WV0aa	I don't think it is weird at all. i also don't think that just because you have those feelings you are more likely to act upon them judging from the obvious level of maturity you show in the way you ask this question. <br>  I was the same way at an even younger age and i didn't have a baby until now when i was ready ( i am 24, he is 2 months). <br>  It is a nice dream to be able to build up to :D|`|SrRafsqraa	How your feeling I can't say whether it is normal or not--but it really shouldn't be.  Fifteen is way too young to have a baby.  You will have to grow up way too fast and you will miss out on alot.  Having a baby is alot of work, no sleep, constant attention and care to the baby, hardly anytime for yourself, and sorry to say but most relationships at 15 years old aren't going to last until your old and gray.  Please wait, you have no idea the responsibility and hard work a baby really is and having a baby at 15 is nothing to be proud of.|`|g7XmorbCaa	I think you think by having a baby You will have Your boy friend forever -There is a 90% chance -No matter what he would say -Your relationship will dissolve by the time you were in your third trimester. It isn't fair to try to get Pregnant on purpose -Your ruining someone else life without there consent. Wait five more years and then see how you feel about the guy. Sex is not everything. Yes it is normal for a woman to feel the need to want a baby-But remember timeing is everything in your life -5 years you will have at least graduated high school and can support yourself when he decides to leave you and your baby for a piece that doesn't have baggage.|`|YsvpLwy6aa	GROW UP|`|VMiJiOW7aa	I don't think it is weird at all. I wanted a baby young to. I still don't know what I want to do career wise but I always knew I wanted a family. At school and other events people ask you what you want to do when you get older or what you want to study for...I never knew and am still trying to figure it out. I am 21 and have a 4 month old daughter! yes my social life is gone and I really miss have no real responsibilities.  Babies are great but there is plenty of time for that. Be careful and I recommend waiting until older than me. Get some life experience in so you don't feel like you missed it.  take the time to just be young with no one else to take care of!!|`|z6qYebkvaa	now days its normal. i was the same way and by the time i was 17 i found out i was pregnant me and the daddyu  was together for 2 years and broke up then stopped haven any contact i got so sick i was in the hospital the whole time i had to quit school in the 11th grade and my job and till this day im still a single mom of a 2 year old and still stugglein|`|FHT6wsUpaa	It's not weird.

Your body is growing and developing and that is what female bodies are made for.  However, it is NOT normal to act on these u feelings.

8lcNupM2aa	Oh my.. it depends on what kind of formula you gave her. Did you give her that pre-mixed kind that's really thick?  <br>  <br>  I would think 4 oz of formula on top of breast milk was way too much. My son was eating around 4-5oz of either or at one time when he was 4 months.<br>  <br>  Just go easy with it at first.. a few ounces at a time and I don't really see any point in mixing the two. I'm surprised she liked it.. my son made the most awful face when I first gave it to him but within no time that's all he wanted.. so if you don't want to quit breastfeeding be careful!|`|vLOjcH7paa	It was probably the formula that you used.<br>  We started on Similac - didn't work<br>  Went to Enfamil - didn't work<br>  To our surprise, Parent's Choice Gentle works very well!! And, it's like half the price of the name brand stuff.|`|6fiYhtACaa	Forget the formula and just bring the pump with you. Although the formula may have started off sounding like a good idea I'm afraid it'll just mess with both your and the baby's systems. If you're only going to leave her with Grandma a couple of times, just pump the night before and the morning of your outings. That will leave you with two feedings and then feed her right before you leave. It really sounds like this formula debacle will be a bigger hassle than just pumping.|`|qBtTAgBqaa	Have you thought about even trying to pump? Her system probably isn't used to the formula. Her tummy has been digesting breastmilk, which is so easily digested. The formula makes the tummy work much harder, which is why she probably threw it up.<br>  <br>  You should try one of those broken down formulas. Like Enfamil's Gentlease? Or Carnation Good Start formula. Ask your pediatrician to suggest a formula with broken down proteins.<br>  <br>  But I say.. try pumping your milk. Or just leave her with grandma between feedings.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	I don't think I'd want to risk another reaction, if it is an allergy next time it could be far worse.<br>  <br>  I don't see what the problem is in pumping enough milk for "a couple of times" -and at 4 months she can go 8-12 hours without breastmilk if she chooses, so its not a big deal if she won't take it from a bottle.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.got-breastmilk.org/Onebottlewillhurt.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.got-breastmilk.org/Onebottlew...</a><br>   This mom worked hard to establish her breastfeeding and soon was successful. Things were going very well until she decided to go shopping one day and leave formula behind for her husband to feed her 6-week-old son. She was not concerned because he had already had formula and shown no adverse affects.<br>  <br>  When her husband fed her son, the baby began having severe reactions and was rushed to the hospital. Hospital staff did not think that the problems were related to the formula. This little guy was subjected to thousands of dollars in tests – all negative. He went home exclusively breastfeeding. A few weeks later when his daddy gave him another bottle of formula, he turned blue, almost stopped breathing and was once again rushed to the hospital. It was determined at last that he was allergic to formula. His allergies began with the early formula sensitization in the hospital nursery. Needless to say, he never got formula again. Formula is not so innocent for some babies.|`|QzOCkKGjaa	Solution:  Start pumping!
O3EtP4vOaa	I have PCOS and Endometriosis so pic my brin with ny questions you have.  The endo will prevent you from getting pregnant depending on where it is located and the only way to know for sure is you have it is by having surgery.  Do not let just any doctor do the surgery.  You need to ditch the regular ob/gyn and go to a specialist.  Find a fertility specialist that specializes in Reproductive Endocrinology.  Do not waste your time with a regulr gyn.  I did this for almost 7 yrs getting missed diagnosed a bunch and treated incorrectly.  What area do you live in?  I can recommend doctors depending on where you are.  You also want to look for a doctor that removes the endo surgically and not by cauterizing (burning) it away.  If they burn it and do not remove it it will grow back quicker and require another surgery.  Also if they suggest you go on Lupron Depot I will strongly strongly advise against it!!! Make sure you do your research on it before you let them talk you into it, it is the most horrible medicine in the entire world, I can not stress this enough do your own research.  <br>  <br>  Anyway email if you want and I can help you with all the questions I have been diagnosed w/ endo for 3 yrs now and research like crazy about it and PCOS I just got my official diagnoses but I knew I had it for awhile.|`|oqUlYXqtaa	metfomin and clomid when taken together can increase your chances to conceive if you have PCOS< also if you have PCOS it doesn't mean that you have endometriosis and just proceed with the treatments as your dr. recommended, don't worry many women with PCOS can get pregnant especially if your tubes are ok!<br>  you can also ask fertility specialists online for free, and find others going through similar situations with PCOS and taking those meds,<br>  try fertilityties.com<br>  good luck!!

SlBsJ3NRaa	My 10 month old just recently grasps shaking his head yes or no. If I'm trying to lay him down and he doesn't want to sleep, he vigorously shakes his head no. If I have his baby food, he starts to grin and nod yes. And if I say "Awe, lovey baby" he gives hugs and cuddles. Babies are quite smart even if they aren't that vocal. Mine also recently learned that gagging himself gets me to run in the room practically mid-pee or mid-cooking...|`|iTXnHiwTaa	It's crazy how fast things happen... like day to day, its something new :)

I know if i ever met a woman named Liana Cola, I would want to lick her, just to see what she tasted like.  If she tasted better that either coke or pepsi, I would marry her.

Fv8ArTrIaa	Just so you know, if you see a doctor about fertility options your hubby can actually be put on a temporary fertility profile and will be excused from work for a few hours on the days around the time that you are ovulating. I know this sounds crazy, but that was actually what my hubby and I had to do when we were trying to concieve, I don't know how it works with the Marines, but the Army doctors were all very helpful with the whole thing.|`|S3t69kh2aa	The timing is not too bad.  Try on the 16th.  Good luck.|`|oqUlYXqtaa	sorry to hear you're going through this,<br>  trying now won't hurt as sperm can live in your body for a few days, the chances are low, but worth the try!<br>  you can also talk to your doctor about freezing your husband's sperm so you can do an artificial insemination when he's away and you're ovulating.<br>  you can also ask fertility specialists online for free and find other ladies going through similar situations, try fertilityties.com<br>  good luck!!|`|O3EtP4vOaa	you could always cut out all the middle stuff go to the doctor have them test you to tell you exactly when you are ovulating and get IUI.  Its quicker than trying to time sex when he is gone all the time.  Just a thought???  It's  not as fun this way but it is less stressful.

XEiIYjT7aa	Sometimes, even though everything looks just fine with both partners, it just takes time to conceive. It's known as (adequately enough) unexplained infertility. My aunt took 4 years to conceive her first child...and for no apparent reason. I hate to say this (I know what TTC is like, and it's KILLER!) patience is the only method. <br>  <br>  It wouldn't hurt to have hubby checked out though if after a year you haven't conceived. Stuff happens.<br>  <br>  But again, you haven't even been trying for a year, so give it some more time, and I'm really sending tons of baby dust your way!|`|325dc58fe0dad7a757aae14664382449aa	try this: before you have sex have your husband repeat the following phrase: "Don't worry baby, no one gets pregnant the first time."|`|ntdGOZqGaa	You guys are trying that's the problem lol It seems like when you throw your hands up in the air and say to hell with it, you will get pregnant.  You could talk to your doctor about maybe putting you on an infertility med called clomid, but don't be surprised if you at least get two kids at once. I was reading the other day that a women around your age if they try for longer then 6 months to talk to a doc about infertility med. No offense by the way :) If you dont want to do that then just have fun practicing until he gets ya. Good luck|`|AA11831450	ok, maybe your diet is to acidic, coffee, sodas, tomatoes, who knows. Prior to baby making activity, douche with baking soda to lower the acidity. High acidity will kill the "swimmers".
1tmX7xbRaa	i don't blame you. i would be LIVID if i found out my kids did that to another child. it is weird though and i think you should ask them why they would do something like that. but i don't blame you for doing what you did however not only would i have spanked them i would have punished them... taking away tv or something. they need to understand what they did was horribly wrong and unacceptable. and you should NOT fee.l guilty.|`|5ujzs0k3aa	If you dont feel what you did will rok, why dont you take them to see a chil behavior specialist. What they did is very disturbing and can get them into a lot of trouble. I think it is best to sddress any issues behind this, there has to something going on for them to do such a thing.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	We still know its you. You know that right?<br>  And I will say the same as I said then<br>  Keep your weird fetish and your imaginary perverted children to yourself|`|FiUprYsvaa	You again?|`|bfb230dc1ac989ed2a0e37264327e8a1aa	First of all, your initial reaction was correct.  Your kids are way past the age of innocent "playing doctor" usually around age 5 or 6.  The 11 year old boy certainly knows better.  However, I would not have had them expose themselves to each other, but I would have spanked.  Sending them to their room was also a good idea, it gave them time to think about their actions.|`|O6DSFJbTaa	You must feel you did not deal with this properly if you keep questioning yourself and asking others.<br>  <br>  I would not have pulled my kids pants down, and I would not have hit them.  Causing pain on children does not teach anything other than to cause pain to others to get the point across.|`|pnL5WTXMaa	wow. this is like dejavu - you asked this like last week. you ask questions about spanking all the time - it is a total fetish thing for you. and it's creepy.|`|kGPwLTyqaa	Pulling their pants down and spanking them shows that you have a sign of pedophilia.|`|KyFCYs0Yaa	You asked this same question before. That is sick.|`|DnNkCF6Taa	You did the right thing, while I am not a mother, I say you did the right thing.  Your kids wouldn't do that again.  Don't stress about what random people say online, most of the people that respond to these questions don't believe in spanking.  So if their answers get you down, don't worry about it, you did the right thing.|`|LwbwMFX9aa	your kids are horrible, OMG, id beat the **** out of my kids<br>  <br>  and if I had been your friend, that friendship wouldve ended right then and I would have charges pressed against your sickos|`|xLFQiBrdaa	Wow! This is a tough one! I think having them pull their pants down was a little too much because it would contradict the point you are trying to prove. They will probably think "If mom made us do it than maybe is not as bad as she is saying it is". It is normal for kids to be curious but it is our jobs as parents to teach them what is unacceptable behavior. I am a believer in spanking but is this case (based on their ages) I don't think it would have the effect you want. I would take away ALL priviledges for a week after having a very serious talk with them. This would emphasize that what they did was very wrong.|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	You did good but I think that it is time to have a chat about good touch and bad touch and what is wrong to do. They are old enough and this could be a problem and could be happening between each other when you are unaware. Also I dont think you should have made them pull there pants down.<br>  Tyffannie
b09a95122fd9bc36dd862d2d74cf004faa	Your parents don't want you to grow up to be a loser. You have shown that you are very irresponsible by your actions. So what should your parents do to help you understand that you need to behave in a more mature manner? Perhaps they should ground you until the grades improve and you have savings of the amount that they originally requested.|`|rid4brOnaa	How in the world did you ever fail 3 classes? Why would you defy your parents and spend all of your money? On your friends, yet!<br>  <br>  Young lady, you most certainly do deserve a spanking. Maybe 3. One for each F. I'm trying to think of a reason why the spanking(s) shouldn't be on your bare bottom. <br>  <br>  3 hours in the corner may be a stretch of sorts, a full month being grounded certainly isn't.|`|angW1Lkfaa	Did you learn the point of the punishment|`|in7qi4oZaa	You should have studied at worked hard. What type of person will spend all their money on their friends. You got to be crazy for that. Failing 3/5 of your classes. You need to buckle down and get to work. I see why your parents were so angry.|`|PxawVQ7Xaa	It's hardly your fault that you failed, do people honestly believe that would purposely fail just for the hell of it?

It's your money so you can do what you want with it.|`|124377045ceac9826f76a176d439bd8faa	Sheesh--instead of writing into Yahoo Answers complaining about your punishment--which was quite fair and well deserved, why don't you use the time constructively to avoid a repeat?|`|j0Jkq4z2aa	you should get spanked (+ stand in the corner for 2 hours) and then be grounded for 2 weeks. you deserve it. what you did was wrong and you have to accept responsibility for it. take your punishment and then it will all be over. good luck!|`|SX9zoVEQaa	That's way too harsh...  If they want to spank you, its up to them.  Corner like 15 mins.... Not 3 hours!!  <br>  <br>  A week of grounding is better, 1 month is far too long.|`|bJh1MesQaa	You should have thought about that before you failed your classes.|`|hORVMOHKaa	well seeing how your a kid.. so if i was a kid i would listen to my parents. BECAUSE THATS THE ONLY OPTION!|`|96674fa67547cfd48aac1f7c7bd6d5c7aa	a spanking and standing in the corner and you are how old?|`|DnNkCF6Taa	Honestly your punishment should be a big spanking, one that leaves you not necessarily wanting to stand in the corner, but needing to stand... I know that sounds harsh but your parents are the ones that are in charge.  I do understand that you hate the idea of the spanking and being grounded for a month, but look at the reason why they are doing so.<br>  <br>  You failed 3/5 of your classes which means you will have to retake them, which could affect what college you get into or if you can.  Then look at the fact that if you work for the money or if your parents give it to you, they told you they want you to save some of it.  They are trying to teach you some very valuable lessons, that if you don't learn now you can get in worse trouble in the future.  <br>  <br>  Let's put in terms of this economy and how the country is going now.  If this wasn't school but a job and you were out on your own, where would this put you.  If you failed to meet your commitments for your job (which as a student your job is going to school), if you failed at your job you would probably would be fired.  If you didn't have the foresight to save you would probably end up not only not being able to pay the bills, including housing and food costs.<br>  <br>  In the real world there is no one to help you back up, hold you accountable, and yes spank you, and help you move forward.  If your parents are going to spank you because you performed poorly in school that is the way it should be.. and to be serious if you were my daughter it wouldn't just be one spanking but three.<br>  <br>  But also look at it this way, they are not giving up on you, they are disciplining you, and it might seem like a lot now, but it is not that bad.  They are disciplining you and guiding you, and in the discipline you need to know that they are still standing behind you.<br>  <br>  I think what you need to do is to take responsibility for your actions, and not fight your parents with discipline, but walk down there, and accept it and get it past.  But before you accept to tell them that you understand that they are doing this to look out for you, and you were wondering if you guys can talk about how you are doing in school, or get a weekly report from the teachers so you won't fail again.<br>  <br>  This way you can be sure without a doubt not only will you get this discipline, but you will be able to learn from it.  And with getting your grades reviewed, you can make sure it never happens again.  Because with everything else that would happen as an adult, this type of discipline really isn't that bad in comparison.
FbWpO6Wxaa	You poor thing - classic case of colic and the terrible news is there is nothing that you can do except wait it out. I have a really good friend who's a pediatrician and her son was exactly the same as your son - to the letter. She tried everything too and nothing worked. He'd only sleep at night lying on her chest and while she sat upright on the couch!!! She said that she knows this sounds terrible, but she finally understands why some women shake their babies (not that she'd ever do it, but she understands the compulsion now). Her son finally started getting better around three months and things are fine now (he's seven months old). Hang in there - get plenty of support, go for a walk outside with him in the stroller, or better yet, go for a walk by yourself just to get a breather and just have faith it WILL get better. Hang in there!|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	Honey, sounds like he has colic.  Not much you can do, but except the fact that he's gonna cry.  Buy a nice head set, and put then on, and try to drown out the crying while you rock him.  But except the fact that you won't always be able to get him to stop crying.  I stressed myself out major trying to make my colicky daughter stop crying.  And then just count down the days.  Colic is at it's worse at 6 weeks, and usually get's better around 12 weeks.<br>  <br>  Try to enlist some help.  So your not the only one going through this, and listening to a baby cry every night.  Whether it's dad, or some one you trust.  But don't leave a colicky baby with any old baby sitter, your gonna put up with a lot more then some teen ager will.  Try to make it family.<br>  <br>  But if you have to walk away, then do it.  You don't have to be super mom.  If he's fed, changed, comfortable, and all other needs are met, set him in his crib, and walk away to regroup.   Colic is probably one of the hardest things I've dealt with.  But it will get better.  When I think of those horrible days, and nights I sat up with my daughter crying they're like light years away!<br>  <br>  Good Luck, you're way stronger then you realize right now, but you will make it through it!  I promise!  E-mail me if you want!|`|kzyEuRroaa	Oh mama, I feel for you!  I went through colic with my second child (thankfully the only one).  Some nights the sound of the vaccum would calm her a bit, or putting her in her carseat on top of a rumbling dryer, other times driving, singing, bouncing, swaying, you name it I tried it.  It went on for a bit over 2 months and then it was over.  It was the worst thing ever!  I remember at one point laying her on her changing pad, flopping to the ground and patting her tummy while singing over her wails.  Keep trying everything, and remember it does get better.  Until then, just hold tight to your little man- and your patience!!|`|7HzfgRmwaa	Yep - call your doctor on Monday and see if they can get him in. My son also has been getting fussy lately. not like you described though. At his  feeding (8ish) he cries and acts hungry but will not take the breast. he just screams. I've begun sitting him in the burp position and patting his back like im burping him. This calms him tons and sometimes gets him to sleep. If that doesn't seem to work then i just lay him belly down on my shoulder and pat his back that way. He will fall asleep one of those ways. See if that works for your little guy<br>  <br>  Also - for colic babies at my daycare we swaddled them tightly and turned them away from us so they are looking out at an angle and rocked/swayed them. <br>  <br>  I hope one of these works for you. Good luck|`|qBtTAgBqaa	Sounds like colic:<br>  <br>  Colic is one of the mysteries of nature. Nobody knows what it really is, but everyone has an opinion. In the typical situation, the baby starts to have crying periods about two to three weeks after birth. These occur mainly in the evening, and finally stop when the baby is about three months of age (occasionally older). When the baby cries, he is often inconsolable, though if he is walked, rocked or taken for a drive, he may settle temporarily. For a baby to be called colicky, it is necessary that he be gaining weight well and be otherwise healthy.<br>  <br>  The notion of colic has been extended to include almost any fussiness or crying in the baby, and this may be valid since we do not really know what colic is. There is no treatment for colic, though many medications and behaviour strategies have been tried, without any proven benefit. It is admitted that everyone knows someone whose baby was cured of colic by a particular treatment. It is also admitted that almost every treatment seems to work—for a short time, anyhow.<br>  <br>  See full article here:<br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/newman/02colic_in_bf_baby.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/newman/02colic_i...</a>|`|w3ob12X6aa	maybe he has gas my daughter use to scream and scream and i could never figure out what was wrong with her but what helped was i would push her legs in and out for like 30 minutes and run her stomach, seemed to calm her down but if its not gas then maybe he is over tired fighting his sleep? but you should call the dr. and tell them what going on and ask to be be seen before your app. it sounds like nothing is working, so you should make sure everything is ok with him good luck to you|`|yzc0cAt1aa	He may need a burp. Same thing was happening to me but not like you are saying every day at the same time. If you stay calm that will help. Babies feel when you are nervous. Drops and water doesnt help. They just make things worst. All your baby needs till the 6 month is breastmilk. It is not unusual for babies to sleep with their moms. So... I know your husband wont like it and i know you feel awful but other thing you can do stay in a chair with the baby whatever you find more confortable for you. Not a bad idea for the doctor to see him. I hate doctors. I mostly disagree with mine but take his opinion too. He may have colics. If he refuses to nurse the only thing is hold him or make your husband hold him. Babies need daddy too. Mine was calming down with his father while was fussy with me so you can try. He may have white build up on his tongue from the breastmilk. That may hurt and make him cry. Not much you can do. It will go by itself. I was cleaning it with baking soda but that was my mother advice the doctor didnt approve it and i dont know if it was the best thing to do. Thats going by itself you just have to wait. Thats what i can say.|`|3AoQBdI1aa	Go to the doctor ASAP. he might have an insect bite or something irritating him at a certain time (if it had venom). He also might be allergic to your breast milk. (if you only feed him your milk than i don't know) these are only assumptions ok this to check out i'm no doctor or am i totally shure hope it works out though.|`|FX6fDA7jaa	Oy happened my little boy too , it is age for baby very fussy , they called it is colic  , it will be worse until he is around 3 months it will get better and better . My boy wanted to be held ( sleeping ) all time and we firgued to buy swings to help him go to sleep and it help little bit but nothing you can do with this age , just patient and deal with it , make sure your baby not hungry , dirty diaper or sick ( by check his temperture )|`|QqFPNti4aa	Yes call your doctor, even if they treat you like an idiot at least your son may be helped and you might find some relief.  Have you thought about what your diet is also.  Are you taking any mediciene of specific foods that you eat anywhere from a couple of hours before the last breast feeding.  Remeber everything you eat goes into your milk.  He might be having a reaction to your milk.|`|r4N3R0dtaa	Oh sweetie,I know exactly what you're going through, my little man did exactly the same thing when we first brought him home. I'd try to get your baby into your doctor's a little earlier if you can, it sounds like he may have colic. One thing you may want to try changing is things in your diet, like cutting down dairy products, and see if that makes a difference, since some babies react mommies milk that eat dairy. Another thing that my husband and I did for our son was take him to a chiropractor( I was really leary at first because I didn't want anyone yanking and pulling on my baby, but it was really gentle and massage like.) The chiropractor told us that the birth process is extremely hard on babies as well as mothers, and it's easy for their bones and joints to be out of place after birth. My son ended up having a bit of a kink in his neck, and once the chiropractor massaged his neck a bit, we saw a complete difference in our baby's attitude the following day. I hope this helps, and wish you the best of luck.|`|vife8MOzaa	Call your doc and ask for a prescription for Zantac or whatever they recommend for heartburn. It's quite possible your baby has GERD, it's awfully painful and crying makes it worse. It's safe to try the Zantac, takes about 3 days to start taking effect but if it doesn't work after a couple of weeks, it's likely to be colic. If that's the case you won't be able to get him to stop crying but you can do your best to try to comfort him through it. Just accept that he's going to cry and try your best to support him. If it makes you feel better Google GERD. My son developed it at 2 weeks and I was told that it was colic. <br>  <br>  That didn't go away for 4 months like it was supposed to so I went back and was told it could take 6 months, after 6 months a friend suggested GERD and I realized that my son had every symptom. I'm beginning to think it's a very common thing to have. My newest edition has it but we caught it early so it hasn't had a chance to get worse. He would spit up constantly, he fusses a little, but NOTHING like my older son. <br>  <br>  I wish you he best of luck and congratulations!
4vRTPnL1aa	by 35 weeks i would have the hospital bag ready to go and the diaper bag i would have ready just so its ready and you wont have to do it later
vWb8fquvaa	Absolutely. Every women ovulates at different times and can even vary from month to month. Sperm can live up to 7 days. If you ovulate anytime within that period there is a possibility. <br>  <br>  Condoms or other forms of birth control can help you with worrying about this.|`|pIvN6TY7aa	Yes. <br>  <br>  You can get pregnant at any time of your menstrual cycle. <br>  <br>  Some times are chancier than others.

dcNmRPGPaa	i understand the fact that you're upset about changing doctors, I'd bu mad,too, but take it from me diabetes is NO joke.<br>  Congrats to you for changing your diet!<br>  Depending on how you maintain your sugars throughout the remainder of your pregnancy you may be able to just control it with diet and exercise. You may have to go on Metformin or even insulin to help maintain it. They may even put insulin in your IV. Your baby will be big, but you won't necessarily HAVE to have a c-section. Only if there are complications. <br>  Good Luck!|`|p4R1c6fraa	I just don't understand why your doctor is making you switch so close to the end.Do they not have enough experience to deal with gestational diabetes? Well just make the best of the situation and keep up your diet.The one you need to bond with is your beautiful little angel you will be meeting sooner than you think.God bless you.<br>  <br>  I'm 17 weeks and 2 days myself.|`|vygYFdsSaa	Its understandable that you'd be a bit emotional about the doctor switch (especially considering the hormones LOL) but its in the best interest of your bebe to switch to the new doctor. I don't have any firsthand knowledge of the diabetes so I'll just say good luck and god bless x|`|HoonZJMgaa	Hi. I went through the same thing with my last child. I was highly upset  as well but I never formed a bond with the new doc I was just mad as ever until I delivered. But no there is no reason you will have to deliver by c-section unless the baby is too big. But my son was 8lbs 14oz and I pushed him out!  Don't worry just eat right and you and the little one will be fine.|`|GrZTwERlaa	Hi, I completly understand your situation, i am too diabetic and my GP will not look after me when i am pregnant because of that risk. It is very upsetting that you have to see someone new. But for the sake of your babie health it is best to see your new doctor.<br>  <br>  Now your obsticals you MAY come across, i stress the MAY because you mught not get them at all and i don't want to worry you any more.<br>  <br>  * you may have to start injections of insulin if your sugar levels can't be managed by diet<br>  <br>  * You may retain more fluid than usual so make sure you put a brick under the foot of your bed to help it go down over night<br>  <br>  * You have the chance of having a larger than usual baby, (i'm from australia) so depending on where you are you'll have more ultra sounds to keep an eye that your baby doesn't get too big for your birth canal<br>  <br>  * and again depending on where you are, they will more than likely enduce you 2 weeks early, doctors like to make sure your labour is controlled enviroment so they can monitor your sugars<br>  <br>  * after your baby is born the nurses will be checking your baby's sugar levels as it takes a little while for your little ones pancreas to start acting on it's own. Possibly spending a little time in the special care nursery. <br>  <br>  But if you are carefull and keep your sugars inder check hyou should be fine!<br>  <br>  congrats to you on your baby, i hope all goes well|`|OBuzcIDbaa	I don't think you'll have to have a C Section. I didn't and I had gestational diabetes. Hang in there. You won't be pregnant forever and it'll all be over except for the dirty diapers. (-:|`|MqFeJiukaa	There is a little higher risk of a c-section.  You are doing the best you can by changing your diet.  You may be induced a little early if the baby is measuring to large.  <br>  I understand why you are upset about changing your Dr but you trust your old Dr and they refered you to this Dr so you should trust that the new Dr is great.  Good Luck

Also some other fun ones might be- Wicked, Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, Cinderella by Rodgers and Hammerstein (a good production- not a community theatre version, usually).  Cats is good, but for her age it tends to get really long in the middle, it might loose her attention.  Lion King or Aida would be good too.|`|6JOTtBSGaa	Annie, High School Musical on ice, uhmm Jonas Brothers 3D movie, Ahaha, Uhmm, Not really sure whats out there ^^|`|hPagd7N2aa	See if anybody is playing "Peter and the Wolf" It's really fun and enjoyable also the music for it is great!|`|swxiulwtaa	Well, my fav musicals when I was 12 and still today are Chicago and Moulin Rouge.

My son is 8 and I've taken him to "Pirates of Pinsance", "Swan Lake", "Nutcracker" and recently his first Opera "Aida". He liked all of them.  (plus I keep plenty of candy on hand)
kaqPSgTVaa	Spotting can happen when one is stressed. Excitement over getting pregnant is actually considered stress, go figure. LOL. Implantation bleeding does not last that long and isn't that common so it was most likely not that. You may have tested too early and could still be pregnant though. Light spotting in very early pregnancy can be normal.  Take another test in a few more days.|`|jzAfst8Taa	try using first response first thing tomorrow morning if no positive wait 2 to 3 more days and try again

You ovulate in the middle of your cycle, so find out how long your cycle is and divide it by two.

Also, there are tests out there that will tell you when you're ovulating. I suggest getting one of those and take it when you believe you should ovulate to make sure you really are.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|pq2q0upuaa	get a ovulation calculator, i know it might sound weird but when your ovulating and your having sex flip upside down (that's what i did)  put your head and shoulders on the floor and keep Your bottom on the bed and when he cums don't get right up stay there for at least 5 mi or longer if you can stand it just keep doing that and you should get prego! good luck|`|rUjUmXNjaa	First Response? - OVULATION CALCULATOR<br>  Then increase your chances further by predicting the two days you're most likely to become pregnant with the FIRST RESPONSE?

KPmfrevlaa	i am EXACTLY the same, but i am due 9.5.09 and i have been getting ALL of those symptoms you just said. so, unless we r both in early labour then i would just say its probably our bodies preparing for the birth. not yet, though you dont want it to happen now its way 2 early. :) good luck :) where in AUS r u? me- NSW|`|m2aznd8xaa	it very much so prelabor it can last a day or weeks so just have those bags packed and ready. you can feel like this til your due date just make sure you keep track of how far apart contractions are if you start getting them your body could also just be getting prepared for the real thing  baby wont move as much since its having less room. call your dr and let him know your symptoms you might need to get checked  to see if you have dialated at all. at 8 months its very safe to have the baby now but i know eery mom would rather wait the full tem .so hope everything goes well for you. with my second pregnancy i went through the same thing  i had my 2nd daughter at 8 1/2 months.i was having those same symptoms at 7 1/2 months  i was due for a repeat c section  and had her early. she was 7lbs  and very healthy.  best of luck and cograts|`|ntdGOZqGaa	Sounds like you might be getting ready for labor or might be in early labor I would talk to your doc about it all though. If you are leaking fluid from your vagina then you need to see a doc right away bc that could be your water breaking it doesnt have to gush out it can leak out too. Good luck|`|AA10458750	although your contractions are irregular, all other signs point to pre-term labor. it may not be, but neither you or me s a Dr. to determine that. i would call your Drs. office first thing monday mornign and get checked out.|`|lvGSEvjSaa	Well this is a sign that your body is getting ready for labor, even they got your due date could be wrong. I really think you should get it checked out again...just to be safe....
46cd2ca02c07674e58e26d9c11367762aa	It might not have been implantation bleeding, but it could have been ovulation bleeding. You usually ovulate about 2 weeks after your period, which would have put you somewhere near the first of March. Sometimes when the egg is released it can cause a small amount of bleeding/pink, brown, redish discharge. I think you are more close to ovulation rather then implantation. <br>  Good luck.|`|lwaSJn3Gaa	if i was i would wait a couple more days because when i was pregnant with my son which was my first pregnancy i got a very faint + line and that was a week after my period was due. i have heard of many women getting pregnant and taking many tests and all of them come back negative until their like 2 months pregnant. good luck!!!|`|1z3C0R2Vaa	Could be implantation bleed you can test in a week time and see what is the out come Good luck.......)
AA11831450	I would say go back to a hospital immediately, but I would not walk around or drive. I would take an ambulance. It had to be a big jolt for your baby when you belly flopped!  If you did lose amniotic fluid in that major gush- and I think you did, your Hailey isn't as well protected as she was with the extra cushion of amniotic fluid. Mucus plugs usually show on delivery day. The cervix always faces down...did she say effaced? that is flattening out. You will probably meet your daughter tonight or in the morning. Congratulations...now get back to a hospital!|`|lGcpXteaaa	Oh wow, that must have been scary!<br>  I really dont have a logical explanation what the water was but i did fall on my stomach after chasing a little girl in the playground where i worked when i was 37 weeks...<br>  I also felt the gush of water and was rushed to ER...they explained the pressure of the fall caused me to pee myself. Although it didnt smell like pee! lol My daughter was fine and nothing ever bad came of that accident thankfully!<br>  Embarrasing huh! Well keep nagging them to keep checking you ok?<br>  Wish you all the best hun x|`|m2aznd8xaa	you should definitely call your dr.  its hard for a nurse to tell because you body will produce more amniotic fluid for the baby. it gets replenished.  if your lossing the mucus plug than you can be going into labor soo. best bet is call your dr who know best.  good luck to you. you should call him/her now. you can call any time 24-7 that is what they are there for. call the office and youll be told if it an emergancy to dial a certain number usually 0 your dr has nurses on stand by who will page  dr for you and the dr will call back within 20 minutes. it better to tell the dr than to keep worring. the dr might want to see you.|`|vWb8fquvaa	What you described seems like amniotic fluid to me!! <br>  <br>  Go back, ask for a fetal fibronectin test. this can determine if your water has broken. There are also 2 other tests to determine too but i am unsure of what they are called. <br>  <br>  Follow your instincts. If you feel something is up go back to L&D and demand to be re-examined|`|f4df9712869843dd814c1e02d77242eaaa	it sounds like amniotic fluid to me too.  i'd definitely go back to the doctor.  if they won't let you be seen by a doctor then you should go somewhere else.  try not to worry, which i know is easier said than done, but it'll help to keep any more stress off of you and your baby.  God Bless to you and your baby as well...and i hope everything turns out well.  :)|`|WvWFmwQoaa	i would definitely get another opinion this doesn't sound right i would go and see your doc...  this fluid leaking thing happened to me a few weeks ago i woke up and got out of bed and heaps of fluid started coming out and when i went to the hospital a doctor came in and saw me and checked me out and he said everything is fine and did a thing like a paps-mere he said everything was fine it was just discharge but when the mid wife was asking me questions she asked "what did the fluid smell like" ? and i said it didn't have a smell she said that's good and that if it smelt sweet then they may have a problem but everything was fine for me but you should get a second opinion about this.  good luck and i hope all goes well :))<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  YES that cough thing is what they made me do when i got checked i think you should really have a second opinion quickly that whole belly flop thing could of really hurt your baby.. good luck and i hope everything is ok ..|`|yKS2UI87aa	I'm assuming by belly flop you hit your stomach? Decreased movement depends anything under 10 times per hour should be reported to your Dr. As far as the water breaking they have a special type of paper that changes color when it comes in contact with amniotic fluid, so they are probably right as long as they used that. Being denied to see a Dr.? I wouldn't have left until my concerns were addressed. I've never heard of cervix facing down; it's normally called thinning out. If the nurse said you are losing your mucus plug than delivery should be w/in a week. If you are asking did you lose your mucus plug it looks big and snotty like in appearance possibly with a little blood. Good Luck|`|YmZbtFxtaa	I would def go back to the ER because there are test to tell if your water has indeed broke. Or call ur dr and ask him/her to meet you there because you feel you wasn't treated right and mostly they will meet you there. Always go with your gut instinct. Same thing happen to a friend of mine and she wasn't so lucky, im not trying to scare you though because it could be nothing.|`|bbe253b8bd16b56edbb017e1a281d44eaa	Go back to the er! Sounds like you got a nurse that might not know what she is doing. Demand to see a doctor...that is your medical right.Even ask that they do a test to see if you are leaking amniotic fluid. Sounds like you had a major spill and your water may of broke. If you are refused again try a different hospital or ask to speak w/ the hospital administrator.Good luck~|`|i6mydMOyaa	I was in a car accident a few weeks ago, and I asked about leaking fluid, and the doctor told me you would know for sure. He said it would be gushing down your leg, and would not stop. <br>  <br>  It could still have been urine. If you were very hydrated it might not smell or have a colour. <br>  <br>  He told me that if I was worried I was leaking, to lay down for 1/2 an hour, then stand up suddenly. He said if you were leaking, you would feel a major gush. If not, you are ok. <br>  <br>  But if you are concerned, go to an ER. Better safe than sorry!<br>  <br>  Also, to make sure baby is still moving, I was told to have a glass of apple juice, then relax, laying down, for 1/2 an hour. The sugars in the juice should make baby dance and laying still you won't miss any movements!<br>  <br>  But again, don't stress, just go get checked at an ER!<br>  <br>  Good luck!!

Probably not, because she has no experience onm anything..What have you taught your son??? Has he been  a part of taking care of the baby??? if he has been, then you might be ok...Only you know your 13 year old son....

Make sure you kid is always by the baby's side then, and that everything is locked.

Other than that I would find another time to do those things or put my baby in a sling and 'have baby, will travel'.|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	It all depends on how responsible you 13 year old is. I cant tell you I do not know your son|`|ZftI0W4Eaa	No, Not until they were 15-16<br>  13 isn't very old but It does depend on how mature they are.|`|sxecXFgraa	I would as long as my 13 year old was responsible.  <br>  <br>  For the poster who mentioned jail time, in most states, 13 year olds can legally watch younger siblings.

MzHwklzKaa	You want to adopt one of the babies that have been dropped off under the "Safe Haven" law?<br>  <br>  You have to be a foster parent registered with the state.  Generally, these infants are taken to the city's crisis nursery and stay there until the waiting periods and paperwork is complete.  <br>  <br>  Reunification with the mother is always the priority, and I'm sure there are waiting lists for babies.<br>  <br>  Contact the child welfare department for more info.  Laws and procedures will very by area.|`|HmkCFddAaa	I believe the safe havens are just where a woman can leave her baby and it will be taken care of no questions asked. Then the safe haven places the child with social services and then the child is put up for adoption.|`|ftSsVFQNaa	No. They go strait to foster to adopt through the state. You might be able to adopt one if you do foster to adopt. Call your local family and children services.|`|RTTgiNn1aa	Google project cuddle. It's a program for women who want to relinquish their child, but I believe that they still get to choose the family. It just all happens after the baby is born....
Xrwvu5Uraa	go to your doctor. then you will know for sure.<br>  <br>  or go buy another test.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	That's what a faint line looks like...Take another test in a few mornings. It will be darker. You are pregnant.|`|AA11724307	I had a test like that once....it was one of those +/- tests and I wasnt pregnant.  Thats not to say you couldnt be though.  I would wait a day or 2 and test again....its about all you can do right now.  good luck|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Hmm, I've never seen one come up with a dotted line before. The test could be defective. If I were you I would probably just take another one to verify the results.|`|PXnn6LoPaa	just take another one girl.  you know, you buy chinese products, you get another lanugage:-)  it is strange...take a picture of it!|`|hoX7hoINaa	The test probably wasn't taken accurately, so you'll want to test again. If you can afford it, buy a digital test.|`|wWkfASTNaa	I have never seen a dotted line pregnancy test LOL do you have a pic? I noticed on one of the 6 tests I took a few of them had kind of a break in the line, where it wasnt as dark in one part of the pos line. Maybe take another test. see what happens. Digitals are easier to read :) GL!<br>  Edit: It could be because there is not enough HCG in your urine to go on the whole line you know? Test again with FMU to make sure.|`|a03926b8639516be0ab0e273c8f5c0e7aa	A line is NOT always a line, take it from someone who has seen and HAD too many false positives to count.

BEST OF LUCK!|`|0iYoPLGIaa	Take another test to be sure
xtmFBjO9aa	I took paxil on and off for years.  I was actually taking paxil when I first found out that I was pregnant and I am 17 weeks now.  The same day that I found out I was pregnant was the same day that I abruptly discontinued the medication.  It is never advised to do that.  I was in a downward spiral after I did that.  Things got worse, but then my OB prescribed me Zoloft which is considered class C.  It is safer than paxil which is a class D medication.  Look up the classes.  So, what I am trying to say is that it is going to very hard to just discontinue the medication.  You may want to consider a switch in brand.  See if your doctor will do that for you and if you do that, please do not get discouraged at the fact that you may feel a little off or different for a short time.  It does improve and its all for the baby.
3RW0uJfAaa	if you arent bleeding, cramping is extememly normal and youll experience it mildly all throughout your pregnancy. Youre only 7 weeks pregnant, alot of miraculous things are happening inside your belly :) Take is easy and dont sweat the little things. Youll know if there is a problem :)|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	sounds like your bub is growing and its causing a little stretching of the uterus. Thats totally normal. As long as its not regular or getting stronger you are fine|`|AA10153923	Cramping happens, <br>  And the pains is probably your uterus starting to stretch|`|IRlVBGWOaa	This is probably from your uterus stretching.  Your body is going through sooooo many changes and sometimes its gonna feel uncomfortable.  I wouldn't worry unless you notice any bleeding.  If that happens, then call the doctor.  If the cramping gets worse, however, it could be a urinary tract infection.  That happened to me when I was 10 weeks pregnant.  It hurt like hell and I was terrified.  But I went to the ER and got some antibiotics and was up and about the next morning.  As of right now, the cramping and tightening sounds completely normal.  Hope this helps :)|`|1UrMbDZHaa	i used to have REAL bad cramps during my first month 6 weeks. i thought i would die. but it got better. your uterus is stretching and ligaments are tearing. it should ease up though. theres nothing to worry about unless you are bleeding. then i would discuss with your doctor. even then it could be nothing.|`|2CeLtVlsaa	I asked my wife.

rNvXWMOMaa	a well behaved child|`|sxecXFgraa	If used properly, it can be an affective punishment.  Not all kids are the same so time outs and taking away a favorite toy doesn't always work.  My kids know spankings are an option for me to use if I feel they need one.  They don't hate, disrespect, or fear me and they don't hit other people.<br>  <br>  Spankings are not abuse.  They can be, no one can deny that, but so can time outs.  Also, I have seen and heard some parents "explaining" to their child what they did wrong that could be perceived as verbal abuse.|`|e8yt5PrGaa	I agree with Mike but only if done for serious offenses ..|`|rSWX0CZ7aa	The kid might be obedient, but more than likely he/she would be behaving out of fear, not because they actually know right from wrong or have actual respect for their parents.  That has been my experience in school.  When I was younger a lot of the kids who were hit at home were really badly behaved in school because no one there could hit them.  That shows that they didn't really know right from wrong or respect authority, they had just been taught to behave out of fear when the person who hurt them was around.  My parents didn't believe in corporal punishment, but they still used different methods of discipline and taught me right from wrong, and since I knew right from wrong I never misbehaved in school.  So maybe you could say something like that for your essay.  You could say that it could make the kid behave when they're younger, but also include how more than likely they're just behaving out of fear, and that when they become teens they might become rebellious since they'll be too big for their parents to hit them anymore.  So you could say how some people might consider it good that they're afraid to do anything wrong, but that it can turn out bad in the future.|`|FiUprYsvaa	There are no positive sides.<br>  <br>  <br>  It makes people behave. (BUT only out of fear and not because they should or out of respect.)|`|GIlTkQu6aa	it teaches kids a lesson and they know not to do it anymore|`|P5Iq6nufaa	Done in a reasonable manner, corporal punishment, or spanking can serve as a long term reminder to a child/teen that deters repetition of the same behavior. Does it every time? No. Why? Because children are human beings and every single human being reacts differently to stimuli and feedback. The entire concept of punishment/discipline (they are the same thing, regardless of what all the so-called experts say) is to create feedback that the person dislikes so that the person will wish to avoid a repeat of that feedback. As long as the person (a child in this case) can link the behavior to the feedback, the child can make a logical connection, i.e., I snuck out of the house at night...mom and dad caught me...I got spanked...I didn't like that because it was painful and embarrassing...I want to avoid it happening again...I will not repeat the behavior (sneaking out of the house) that clearly caused it. This entire process is called learning and the human mind, especially from birth to about the age of 25, is quite capable and efficient when it comes to learning.<br>  <br>  By the way, I don't care what all the supposed BAs and MAs in psych in the world say about what they have convinced themselves to be facts. Unless a study shows the things our little BA/MA is claiming are true 100% of the time, it is not a provable fact, it is a correlation. One would think that someone with an MA would know the difference. Having actually raised a child, as opposed to sitting in a classroom reading books about them, I know what works and what doesn't work. If a parent chooses not to use spanking, that is their prerogative and bless them.|`|qPbKJeXzaa	Do you have a scary teacher?  I don't like the sound of this assignment.  You are right in what you believe and should be able to express your views freely.  Are you brave enough to write why you think corporal punishment has no positive side?<br>  <br>  Are we talking about hitting children? Or could the assignment be about the lashes that people can receive in public for crimes committed in other countries?  If that is the case perhaps you could research whether the crime rate goes down or not after such punishments....|`|pnL5WTXMaa	release of frustration for parent. (stress reduction)<br>  temporarily stops a behavior<br>  <br>  ...that's about it.<br>  <br>  edit- sorry thumbs down fairy...those are just facts - not necessarily opinion.<br>  <br>  edit- hey robocop or whoever - i am supportive of parents who want to spank. the questioner was asking for DATA not opinion. we're not talking about correlation or causation - she's asking about what are the products (positive) of corporal punishment. those are observable products - hence scienific. where's your data/research?|`|DnNkCF6Taa	Here is an odd question, did your teacher assign the idea of corporal punishment when it has to do with kids?  Is it possible your teacher wants you to argue corporal punishment when it comes to the death penalty and items of that nature.... or are you sure it is about child rearing?|`|rnfxNYx3aa	I have sat there and thought and thought and I, as you, can see none whatsoever.  Abuse only instills another abusive generation and then another.|`|pYJ0I0cXaa	if you get smacked for doing something really bad (like my dad used to take the belt to my (***) if I was really out of line), I knew for darn sure NEVER to do that thing again.|`|jbJvTUfPaa	It will deter the aberrant behavior that the person participated in and it will deter someone else from doing that same behavior if he/she knows that would be the consequences of their actions.|`|eVY7Oilbaa	At least the kid will think twice about doing it again.
bf8lx9gxaa	It's possible. When symptoms show up or what symptoms show up vary from woman to woman. So yes, those could be early pregnancy symptoms. Keep me updated on how everything's going. And if you have any questions or concerns, you can e-mail me anytime doll.?|`|hORVMOHKaa	everyone has signs at different times and some people dont have any at all. My first sign was extreme fatigue and it started a couple days before my missed period|`|jzAfst8Taa	possibly everyone is different some get them right away others dont have them for awhile after there pregnant good luck|`|Ql44BXFHaa	I just finished an IVF cycle so I'm very positive about my ovulation date because it's also the egg retrieval date - Ovulation 2/22.  I had blood tests done last week on M-W-F and the blood work picked up + on Friday.  I poas today - just so I could see with my own eyes - and it was +.  So for me it took 12 dpo to show in blood and 14 dpo to show on home test.  Maybe it would have showed on home test sooner but i was afraid it wouldn't and then i'd be disappointed.<br>  I can't really help with the symptoms because I'm also taking progesterone and I'm not sure if I'm experiencing early symptoms or it's the prog.  For what it's worth...  I've had bad headaches off and on throughout the day since Thursday, no nausea other than when the headache gets really bad but that's normal for me and my chest went from a B cup last week to a C cup.  I don't think that last one is normal since I would only be about 4 weeks today...  I'm betting that's the progesterone shots talking (and I'm not complaining!).|`|PwhrTNZraa	With my last pregnancy, I had symptoms (especially cravings for instant maple and brown sugar oatmeal and rotini pasta) show up RIGHT after ovulation, however I didn't realize that they were "symptoms" because I didn't find out for like another 2 weeks I was pregnant (I wasn't really following my cycle, symptoms or testing at that time).  Then with this pregnancy, I just KNEW at 8dpo.  My boobs WEREN'T sore right after ovulation, which they normallly are, so when they got sore at 8dpo accompanied by a fatigue I've never felt before I just knew.  Got my BFP at 9dpo, but I had a 27day cycle with a 13day LP.  I don't think it's too early to be feeling symptoms, it's different for everyone.  Keeping you in my thoughts and my fingers crossed tight!!|`|HFWLYMD6aa	Everyone says you won't feel symptoms yet as it's too early. But then again the professionals say that everyone is different. I would give it another week and a half and then do a test. Good Luck.

xRZ1PRZwaa	Isn't falling love with a child the most glorious feeling in the world?<br>  <br>  My suggestion is that you and your husband check out the feasibility in regards to parental involvement, adoption process, fees, etc. If it's doable from all of these perspectives, then I would ask your young brother-in-law.<br>  <br>  And - when it happens, I would have a celebration for this incredible event to welcome him as one of your children, much like a shower for your new baby (okay, but for a 14 year old!).<br>  <br>  Congratulations on your baby, by the way. It sounds like you have an incredibly warm and loving home!|`|rN0b4jWHaa	Yes just ask him hes 14 and should be mature enough to handle and he already wants to call you mom[: im sure he would love it and its so amazing ud do that for him.<br>  and "lil lady"..he would only be confused if he was 3 not 14.|`|vuEyUbsgaa	If its what you and your husband wants and its what his little brother wants then I guess you should go for it!|`|I64JOuMKaa	I think he really wants you to be his mom :)<br>  <br>  just bring it up one day maybe while eating dinner<br>  and ask him how he would feel if you adopted him and he legally became your son and you were his mom?<br>  <br>  I'm pretty sure he would love it since he already asked to call you mom and since he hasn't experienced a moms love before he's looking for it in you :) you're a wonderful person ! to show him that you can be his mommy when he doesn't have one that is a good role model :)<br>  <br>  I think the custody battles would be worth it so he wouldn't have to expereince his mom in and out of his life anymore :)<br>  <br>  goodluck!|`|YSbCVt3Uaa	No, do not adopt him. You are starting your own family. Your husband adopting his own brother seems silly since they are already related. And you are already his sister in law. Also, there are many legal implications that could come up later. You are only responsible for your immediate family. You can raise him until he's 18. However, he already has a mother. Tell him he should call you his sister in law. Don't confuse this kid more than you have to. You can't pick your family. Its just one of those things. Your mom is your mom and your dad is your dad. Being raised by other family members is fine as long as you don't blur the lines.|`|pnCYdBUuaa	I very much agree with the person that said to find out if it's possible and then ask him.  Just asking him, even if it isn't something he wants, will help give him the reassurance that he needs right now and let him know how much that you do love him.  If the three of you decide together that it's something that you want, then go for it.  I wish you all the best, and I wish there were more people like you becoming parents! :)|`|k4Ek3jAqaa	Let me put this image in your head, Oh who's that? That's my Mom. Who's that? My brother. Wait aren't they married!? If you adopt him you're not only going to confuse the heck out of him but make things a lot more complicated. It sounds like things are good the way they are, you're pregnant with your own child do you really want the added stress of a custody battle while your pregnant?|`|FhlmiI7daa	I think that it is a great idea and he is getting old enough that the courts would be inclined to agree with what he wanted so if he wants you as his mom then I would say go for it.|`|w69QiAqOaa	wouldnt it be weird to be a sister-in-law turned mother? i dont think that should be the term used...anyways the idea sounds great! helping out family always gets a thumbs up!|`|9cQ4cxg1aa	Just wondering, how old are you? The bigger the age gap, the less awkward this would be.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Before you ask him you should look into see if it would be possible. If it is then ask him for sure! :) It sounds like he would love it and you all would be happy.
oQ5oKILHaa	It will be all the way through high school. Just don't give into it. I remember middle school was so lame I was constantly switching groups of friends lol, I was always fighting with someone for any reason. <br>  Once you are out of school you will realize how petty it all was. And once you are working you will realize how catty grown women are. HAHA it never ends. Isn't that sad?|`|XrKviWgSaa	it does not stop until you graduate, even if you leave the school and do home schooling if you still talk to people from that school drama comes into your life, at work drama. there are seniors at my old school (im a senior also just left and went to homeschooling) that still act like they are freshman. but once you get older the drama might die down a little bit but it will never go away completely no matter how much you try, even once you get out of high school and college and start working there will be drama there too.|`|Fc2DkArMaa	You need to surround urself with positive ppl. Also take a look at urself too cuz I always hear the most dramatic ppl say "I hate drama, I don't know why it's always following me" It's becuz they r creating it.

FKR45WLPaa	It sounds like just a plain old nightmare.  Children don't remember night terrors and often go right back to sleep afterward with no memory of it the next morning either.  Discuss this with her parents.  Maybe something happened to make her think that she will be abandoned and left alone.  Constant reassurance that she won't be alone will ease her fear. If something traumatic happened in her life, she may need professional counseling.  She is lucky to have someone like you in her life.|`|T3BXC8qXaa	That's just a nightmare, a night terror is something totally different. You should hold her, talk to her, ask if she needs to go to the bathroom or get a drink and generally comfort her. Good luck :)
2irmTjQ3aa	It could just be another pregnancy symptom, but it could also mean you have gestational diabetes, make sure you talk to your doctor about this so they can test you for it because excessive thirst and tiredness as well as headaches are all signs of gestational diabetes.|`|OBuzcIDbaa	Could be gestational diabetes. Have your doctor do a blood test and make sure and tell him/her all your symptoms. I had these same symptoms and was diagnosed with diabetes.  I know it's tough, but there is an end to the misery.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	Sounds like you are slightly dehydrated. I know how it is I too feel like all I do is drink drink drink, and it seems like I'm still thirsty no matter what. My doc told me that being pregnant just drains so much water out of you, bc the baby takes it then your body takes it. So it seems like its a losing battle. I drink a gallon of water a day and that seems to be the only thing that helps. As long as you dont drink more then a gallon and a half you are ok. Hope this helps|`|mqHL4UcRaa	Your migraines could be caused by dehydrations, which may be the underlying reason your so thirsty. Your body has a high demand for fluids during pregnancy. Keep bottles of water by your bed at night. If you wake up to toss or turn, take a sip of water or chug it if your really thirsty. Carry waters around with you while your out & about.|`|sF3UyQsIaa	hmm. bring it up at your next appointment. could be gestational diabetes. good luck.|`|dcNmRPGPaa	Holly's right that is one major sign of gestational diabetes|`|AA11481774	Get to a doctor right away, not major major, but excessive thirstiness is abnormal during a pregnancy! Dont worry!
PCK5bJt3aa	I completely understand where you are coming from, my daughter seems to be drinking all day! I was concerned about her health but the Pediatrician ok-ed her so we resorted to always watering down whatever she drinks. She loves juice, so we buy organic juices and ones that have a low sugar content and then we water them down..usually 50/50 and add ice. As long as she is drinking an adequate amount of water, if he doesn't want to eat there is little you can do about it. Toddlers go thru those phases where they don't want to eat, besides remember toddlers stomachs are very small.Unless he is severely malnourished and underweight I would not be concerned.|`|AA11256693	Kids are pretty good self regulators with food/drink.  <br>  As long as it is water or (normal amount of) milk I wouldn't worry too much.  <br>  If it is a behavior/control issue, you might try taking away the sippy and only let him drink from an open cup sitting at the table. And offer healthy foods several times a day.<br>  A toddler will not willingly starve himself, he will eat if he's hungry.<br>  If you are really worried, first, remember his tummy is only the size of his fist, second, withhold the cup until he takes say, 2 bites of green beans etc.|`|jsoSKMEmaa	My 14 month old is just the same! She'd drink from her sippy cup all day long if I let her! So long as he's not showing any signs of being ill (if he was then there would be something to worry about) then its ok. All I do is make sure i've taken her drink away around 1 hour before feed time else my ittle girl is too full of drink to eat!!|`|PmcV6Zzmaa	He is probably filling him self up with what ever it is he is drinking and just is not hungry. Try giving him just water, then if he still seems to be drinking excessively I would get him checked out at the doctors.<br>  Of course I didn't mean never give him milk.|`|hQ7UGldvaa	what is he drinking.. water/juice/milk?<br>  <br>  maybe try to limit the drinking to meals and after active activities... unless he is crying uncontrollably for it.. if he's in day care some centers allow the children to get their cups whenever they want it.. teaches them Independence|`|4tWt7jEkaa	tell him no. he only needs to drink at meals & snacks. my son is the same way! i give him milk when he wakes up at 8, juice at 10 with a snack, water with lunch at 1, juice with snack at 3, milk with dinner at 7. if he coniues to ask say no or give him water.|`|J7GTIE5raa	make sure he eats first and then let him have all the drinks he wants. but if he is doing more drinking than eating, that is not good. only teaching him early in life he can get away with things|`|B24W8w43aa	Just give it to him. He's obviously thirsty. The only time you need to worry is if he's sick.
01Mu3wUeaa	1.Don't believe in everything you hear.<br>  <br>  2.You don't do ANY type of cleanse while breastfeeding.<br>  <br>  3.Acai berry is a very good antioxidant...that's all.It will NOT make you lose weight.The only thing that will help you lose weight is changing your eating habits (note I didn't say diet...diets don't work) and exercise.|`|FLEXqVoiaa	Your body needs calories to produce breast milk-A "cleanse" usually involves consuming nothing but liquid for several days. Ask your DR, but it sounds like a bad idea. And I know I don't have to tell you that the only real way to safely loose weight, sustain the weight loss, and get into shape is with a sensible diet and a good exercise routine.|`|GHH1i6d3aa	If it's going to help you lose weight, it's going to help your baby lose weight, which isn't what they need while nursing.  But if you're doing it just for the energy boost, I don't see it being harmful as there are lots of antioxidant benefits.
HztriBPAaa	"How long does cocaine stay in my body after use? Cocaine by-products can be found for 30 hours in the urine of the pregnant woman, and for 2 to 4 days in the newborn after the drug is used." That answers your question. On a personal note this baby is very likely to have special needs that are going to have to be attended to in the near future. I am a social worker who works with adults with disabilities and I cannot describe to you how painful it is to see my clients that still suffer from drug exposure in utero. I strongly urge you to contact social services in your area (you can do it anonymously she doesn't have to know it was you) and get some help for your cousin so that she can be there for her baby. Please for the baby's sake get her some help. Good luck and I will be praying for the baby.|`|LVZdzPmpaa	Call Social Services and alert them to the situation. Depending on where she lives, your cousin can be charged with endangering the life of her unborn child. Regardless of the law, what she did is criminal and she shouldn't be having or raising children.|`|i8Ch743Laa	She doesn't NEED to be doing that being pregnant. It's not good for the baby,at all,it can be born an addict. I'm not sure if it can,but I hope they do,it seems like she's more worried about "good times" than taking care of herself and her baby.|`|MqFeJiukaa	First of all you won't just get custody of the baby because you are at the hospital.  I know this because my mother in law works for cps AND my mom is a recovering cocaine addict and has had 4 of my siblings taken away at the hospital for testing positive for cocaine.  It leaves the baby's system in 3 days.  However if she is a regular user the placenta shows signs of substance abuse and the baby will as well.  You may eventually be able to retain temp custody of the baby once they have checked your home and you have passed a background check (as well as any roommates).  You will also have to sign a safety plan.  <br>  I won't even go there on a personal level about this situation.  Cocaine has destroyed my family and I will pray for this baby|`|OBuzcIDbaa	Call Social Services and take that baby away from her regardless.<br>  She has no business with a baby.|`|aaVod31Gaa	she is killing her baby. you need to call social services NOW|`|m2aznd8xaa	its possible.  baby can have withdraws from it too/|`|ehVzo0zFaa	It doesn't seem your cousin is responsible enough to even have thought of having a baby. Social Services should be called. With the cocaine, if your cousin was using it on a regular basis, the baby will need to be weaned off, for it will have withdrawals, and thats terrible for a babies system and not a nice was to be welcomed into this place. So really it all depends on how often she used. But please call social services. Here in australia it would be Department of Children Services.|`|9776485a7510046fa4388cd98356e6d6aa	Wow ..I feel god awful that I wasn't able to quit smoking cigarettes and was only able to cut down to 3 cigs a day.<br>  How come you aren't trying to get custody of that poor innocent child .<br>  If my cousin was using cocaine I would go cps and try for custody because if she is high on cocaine who knows what she might do to the baby .What if she shakes the baby to death while she is high on drugs or what if she leaves the baby unattended and the baby chokes to death how would you feel knowing you could of prevented those scenarios from happening .|`|w3ob12X6aa	wow she doesnt deserve to have that baby anyways, i just dont understand how someone can do that to a helpless child.|`|AA10153923	Maybe you should get custody, she used cocaine when she was pregnant, I can just imagine after she gives birth.<br>  <br>  I hope the baby is ok and not sick|`|PLbmKNpvaa	They can tell by testing her hair. I hope you do get custody, obviously she shouldn't have a baby. *Shakes her head* The poor thing :(|`|1baaf1590b68ac256de6d448c39d1c92aa	no cocaine only stays in ur body for 3 days|`|dcNmRPGPaa	for the child's safety I hope they come|`|1z3C0R2Vaa	Yes.......)|`|Az8XgIbVaa	What an idiot.|`|pnCYdBUuaa	Cocaine leaves the system pretty quickly, generally within 24-48 hours but definitely don't let this one slide.  Do what you can to make sure the baby gets cared for properly, and not by a woman who thinks she should do a quick line while she's 9 months pregnant or anyone that would supply her, witness her or in general think that it's ok.  Best of luck, don't give up, sounds like the child needs more influences in their life like you, and not like their mother.|`|fUK9y3Qkaa	That's horrible. Why would she risk the baby like that. Im sure that cant be the first time she has done it while pregnant. I feel sorry for the baby Poor thing probably gonna come out addicted. Yes it can happen. My cousin did cocain while she was pregnant and her baby was  premature and addicted and went through horrible withdrawls. <br>  <br>  I hope you do the right thing and let them know she did this. For the baby's sake. If not she might walk out that hospital with the baby. Anything could happen after that. She could get so strung out that she leaves th baby by itself to get  her fix and the baby wounds up alone for days. SMH! Ima pray fro the baby. I hope cps does take the baby. The baby deserves a better life than that.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Thanks in ADVANCE for the THUMBS DOWN!!!|`|d6Uncd6iaa	Hmmm, well cocaine passes through an adults body in 24hours so it may be out by now, But in all honesty that baby may not be very healthy, I would tell your cousin to call her doctor immeditly before something terrible happens. I hope you give her that advice, and i hope they both come out of the hospital safe,.|`|RgKZVbjoaa	Cocaine is out of the body within days....but a baby is probabilly the same...? that's messed up though! that baby needs taken away!|`|ATBHG0ztaa	This is disgusting. Tell someone and take action. She doesn't need a kid! It could still be in the babies system as well. Call Social Services and they can answer all your questions.|`|wi0xPFhQaa	Yes it lingers in the umbilical cord. They won't test for it though unless they have reasonable cause to or she is on the state's medicaid.|`|7zMtmKJaaa	Is your cousin retarded? I hope social service is there so you can raise it. damn|`|YsvpLwy6aa	if the baby comes up clean or not, she shouldn't have custody of the baby because she is already a awful parent. tell on her stupid a**|`|AA11831450	Why not try anyway. If your cousin is using cocaine pregnant, she will use it after the babe is born. Can you talk her into getting help?|`|n54adPiBaa	yes there are many different ways to test 3 months in blood stream, your strands of hair will have history of everything you do as long as your hair is.|`|vWb8fquvaa	Wow. Your cousin gets the Greatest Mom Award. I hope social services comes.|`|hORVMOHKaa	i would call them and have them there anyways, if shes doing drugs she doesnt need to raise the baby|`|vygYFdsSaa	Well thats really messed up. But coke stays in your system for 5 days MAX|`|DOUWdX9Oaa	hell yea! why would she take a risk like that? dummy|`|7pl5QLqCaa	Yikes... <br>  <br>  no it shouldn't still be in the baby's system because cocaine only stays testable in a person's blood for a few days.<br>  <br>  Kinda disturbing the idea of a person using cocaine while pregnant though :(|`|xLjzwcPmaa	no
AA11831450	You can take one anytime now, it has been long enough since you ovulated to give you accurate results.<br>  The baby wouldn't be harmed from playful activity- but rough activity will increase your chances of miscarriage. Make sure there's no more rough stuff down there. Even if you are not pregnant, you should be careful not to get yourself hurt.|`|Py3kFnDyaa	i honestly think you are pregnant! if you are your bf isnt hurting your baby though! even at 9 months he really cant hurt the baby with wild sex. you should take a test prob. tomorrow . the 5 days earlier one though. and if its neg. and you still feel you are go to your gyn and ask for blood work .. thats a definite!!|`|LtZ064eoaa	if you are pregnant i don't think you hurt the baby it haven't grown yet and also take your test A.S.A.p the sooner you know the Better|`|OBuzcIDbaa	You could probably take one now. Sounds like you are and you probably did it on purpose. Why I can't figure out is why. You don't sound like the mature, responsible type to be having a baby. Play rough your first semester and you'll likely lose it.|`|YP3rEESUaa	well I'm guessing the second "period" was just break through bleeding so you should be able to test with in a week and get a positive test result if you are pregnant.  if you do and its negative, and you still don't get your period then I would have a blood test done at the Dr. office.
581c2e6d54ade700c0979035c2b62013aa	i was eating like a horse at 2 weeks. that was weird i coulnt get full.|`|o6RQnxnYaa	First sign is missing your period. Other than that you might feel bloated, irritable. Pretty much what feels like really bad PMS.|`|tSh1zh7gaa	I would like to know the same thing.

SEzIkGNiaa	You could try getting a job at a daycare center.  Put up a flyer at your local grocery store on the bulletin board, in the community center, dance/gymnastics studio, local church or make a flyer and put it in mailboxes around your neighborhood. This is a good way to advertise, particularly if you're certified or have other qualifications. It's also an opportunity to state the pay you're expecting and your availability.<br>  <br>  =]|`|jLI0IgWkaa	put up signs at the YMCA advertising your availability to babysit. also try putting in ads in your local circular.<br>  <br>  you can also create cheap "buiseness cards" and hand them out at local playgrounds.<br>  <br>  good luck .
Wtyk7086aa	aw sweetie. i know what you're going through. but congrats for wanting to get yourself out and realizing it before it was too late, trust me, me of all people would know. you really don't want to make a habit out of cutting yourself, even if at the time, it felt like everything drained out of you, well the anger and pressure. I would suggest going to talk to someone about it, and when you feel stressed, use different ways to get out of it. Take a bath, go for a walk, watch a movie, read a book, scream in your pillow, just don't cut yourself. And its good that you want God to help you. I think that you should really go talk to someone though, it really helps people, it helped me. If you feel like you'll never do it again, it might not be necessary, but you still might want to.<br>  Best of luck sweetie,<br>  Rachel|`|umEgRb7Vaa	Part of the reason people will cut themselves is because it allows them to control something which causes them pain and destruction in their lives. They feel helpless concerning other things in their life which are causing them harm and cutting lets them at least have some say in their pain.|`|abELhjcoaa	it mostly happens due to stress or guilt<br>  talk to somebody you trust, or a counselor, there are better ways to cope such as talking out|`|5PaXbgJ8aa	Not that big of a deal just let it heal then don't do it again|`|hORVMOHKaa	get counseling|`|e0ttkqI6aa	Don't worry about it. Just forget what happened and you'll be fine ^_-|`|EbmieiNHaa	honestly.... smoke weed. it fixes everything, there are no side affects, no risk of death. its just a plant.
hORVMOHKaa	wait a few days and test again this happend to me also and im almost 5 months pregnant now, so you possibly could be!<br>  <br>  Good luck and Baby dust!!|`|oqUlYXqtaa	it can be a possibility and best to see your Doctor to get a blood test and confirm and make sure everything is ok.<br>  you can also ask doctors online for free, try fertilityties.com<br>  good luck!|`|YsvpLwy6aa	i am 31 weeks pregnant and when i took the pregnancy test the first time, i could barely see the second line but it was there. if you can see any second line at all, the test is detecting hCG and that means pregnancy. so you need to make a doctor appointment. good luck!|`|243d2a766c11518b1bb39f8c56aa84f4aa	you could be pregnant...when i did the pregnancy test i had i solid and a really faded one...and some people even if they were pregnant they can still have some blood coming out..... i have a friend who is 4 months pregnant now but she's still see some blood coming out but she's still healthy...but if you're not sure..go to the doctor so ur questions and worries will be answer.|`|P0Z2NvNgaa	You might be pregnant, or these symptoms may be because you think you are pregnant. Go to the doctor and get a proper test.|`|0OL5VOjOaa	go to the docter uhhh im so sorry but it mght be a miscarage|`|3fur16Rgaa	Go to a doctor and don't be shy, any thing held back and one day you just might regret it.
vLOjcH7paa	Sweetie, he will LOVE to see you no matter what!<br>  You are his love and you have given him a child...I know it's our nature to try and "look" the best that we can...but, really, it will truly be ok!<br>  <br>  Trust Me : )|`|Ew2wC9piaa	if he loves you and the fact that you just had a baby he will love to see you now matter what your weight is or what you look like. there is no way to lose it that fast with out surgery. sorry<br>  <br>  <br>  edit to: ibbabygirl2 re read the question the man she is going to see is the daddy not grand dad|`|bGcUdRkyaa	work uot video do it alot! and you will have resalts in a week trust me it works|`|AA11600455	y would you need to?|`|U1wAKo1Gaa	Cocaine!!! JK - the point I am trying to make with that ridiculously horrible answer is that there is no safe method to super-quick weight loss.  Don't worry sweetie, number one, he'll be so focused on the beautiful grandbaby you brought to him that he won't even notice your weight; secondly, you just had a baby....gaining weight is expected and encouraged....he will think you're beautiful for simply being his grandbaby's mommy.  Don't worry, you will lose the extra weight in due time - just focus on that little one for now - truly a blessing, huh?|`|uNvF299Caa	Breastfeed!!!  You burn so many calories. It's crazy.  Just breastfeed.  And don't worry if you haven't lost all the weight by then, because he'll love you no matter what. :) He knows that you just had his baby. It's fine. <br>  <br>  My husband said it was funny playing with my tummy after I had the baby. :)|`|T1qOvZpAaa	Ive just started the shake supplements with lotsa sit ups and other excersises similar and Ive lost 2kg this week. I ve also just had a baby. But Ive finished breast feeding.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	The fastest way would be to starve yourself and get all the water weight off you but it's not healthy.....I wouldn't recommend it, especially if you are breast feeding. I know how you feel wanting to look good but you have to lose it over time. He'll probably love your body just as much as he did before since you just had his baby.......|`|HIskrREJaa	you shouldn't worry about loosing right now, just worry about staying healthy right now... your boyfriend is not going to care.
KPmfrevlaa	thats slack!|`|mx3YK5rLaa	It won't work! By "dummy" do you mean pacifier or thumb? My husband said that when he was little his parents told him that he was going to die if he stuck his finger in his mouth one more time......it worked, but I don't recommend that. If it's a pacifier you're just going to have to take it away. She'll cry, but in a matter of 3-4 days she'll be over it, it won't be forgotten, but she won't make a fuss over it anymore. <br>  <br>  I never gave my kids a pacifier so I never had this problem........lucky me!|`|S0n3DinFaa	To stop my granddaughter from using a pacifier we explained she was to big for it now and made a deal with her.  She packed all her pacifier's up and we put them in the mail box for the "pacifier fairy" to give to new babies who needed them in return the "pacifier fairy"  brought my granddaughter a new baby doll!<br>  <br>  This worked for my granddaughter, sure she asked for it for a few days afterwords but we reminder her that the "pacifier fairy" gave her pacifiers to new babies who needed them and she now has this great baby doll to play with because she was a big girl now !|`|qEGl3J4jaa	I personally would not recomend that!!!! My son cried constantly from the day he was born. We let him keep his dummy until he was nearly three. We explained to him that he was getting to big for it. We slowly lost his dummys one by one untill they were all gone. Took him a few days to get over it but he did. If it is not there then she can't use it!!!|`|R2OMEjrhaa	For my daughter we just took them all away and put them up. She cried for them for about a week or two. It was tough not to give in, but if she really wants to do it.I would suggest this. But she will have to disipline her self, and then prepare for a really cranky whiny baby.|`|k4Ek3jAqaa	I would advise against pepper. She might could choke on it. However if she's stuck on that try a drop of mild hot sauce it'll do the trick and it's not flakey.
azE51WGRaa	You'll be fine to drink this (it's caffeine free, so even better). My mother in law drank 4-5 cups of coffee a day with her little girl and she's fine at 5 years old (just a little more active, I'd say. Maybe that was the side effect of the coffee =D ) As long as you're not craving paint chips or something like that (My WIC office asks me at every appointment if I'm craving those..how weird), then you'll be fine. Good luck and congrats!|`|PwhrTNZraa	As long as it's edible, cooked properly and not anything like sushi for example, go ahead and indulge yourself.  Just don't go overboard.  You might find that one or two of them will satisfy your craving and your onto craving something else....that's how my cravings have been.  I drank lots of caffeine free diet coke when I was pregnant with my first, I just couldn't get enough.....I was careful how much I drank though.  You can even have some caffeine if you feel you need it.|`|ZQsO1T4oaa	go ahead and drink it. its not any worse than any other junk food.|`|1z3C0R2Vaa	don't think so but go easy on it good luck....)|`|xDEYAUwGaa	Haha caffeine free soda is perfectly fine to have.  I mean it's not the healthiest thing to have, but its not going to hurt anything.  You can even have a little bit of caffeine every day if you want.  Like a cup of coffee is perfectly fine.  <br>  Just be happy you aren't one of those pregnant ladies that crave gravel, laundry starch, dirt/mud, or things like that.  <br>  Good luck with everything!|`|lvGSEvjSaa	Well that is actually alot better than caffeine soda, my doctor recommend that you drink that than regular soda.|`|rx0ekB9Paa	yes some cravings can be bad, i crave alcohol,i would love to get drunk or even just take a few shots,but i havent drank a drop.<br>  <br>  my doctor said its fine to drink 1 soda a day.|`|m2aznd8xaa	yea its fine   my dr said its okay to have up to two cup of caffeinated drinks a day.  so a cup of coffee and a coke is fine. im a mom of 2 girls 9 years and 21 months i always had my two cups and my kids where very health  7 lbs and up and they where fast learners too.  sat up at 4 months cruising by 6 months walking by 9 months and potty trained by 18 month.  so even regular coke wont harm baby.as long as its limited.  my kids are not over active so it never affected them at all i think thats a myth . i craved soap any anything else that smelled clean. i would take 2-3 bath just to lick the soap .yea i think its gross now . i never digested it . i just craved it lol

qWNSRq4xaa	I'm a father of two girls, and the oldest is 11 soon. I often ask myself what I'll do when they're your age. On one hand, I want to give them freedoms and trust them, on the other hand it scares me to death, the prospect of something happening to them while allowing them such freedoms. It's likely a similar fear that causes them to smother you. It shows love. It also seems that they've done a fine job raising you, so there should be room for you to do the things your friends are doing...within reason. Hell, listen to me! I need answers just as much as you!|`|AA11451028	Talk to your parents tell tehm axactly what you are saying here , maybe ttehy will tell you their fears or why is taht they dont let you do anything , tell them to trust you and to let u go somewhere at least once that way you can gain their trust tell them how can i gain your trust if u dont let me do anything , but like i said tell them exactly how u feel maybe they will look at it in a teenage way, Good luck but talk to them dont argue!1|`|mx3YK5rLaa	Here's the deal: The world we live in is SO crazy, it's full of monsters, rapists, mean people, and others who just want to take advantage of you. You are a teenager and you can not see the consequences of your actions. Like your example of going to the movies with 5 boys, well, what if they don't take you to the movies but to a secluded area and rape you. You can say that they wouldn't do that because you know them, but you don't. Your parents are strictly trying to protect you, they love you, and are the only people who got your back-for real got your back. Sure they should be a little more lenient because you give them no reason to mistrust you, but I think you are just going to have to deal with it and know that before long you will be out of your parents house and doing whatever you want.<br>  <br>  It's not that I live my life scared it's that I have experience in this area. Someone I knew, someone I thought I could trust, someone who was supposed to be there for me, my dad, molested me as a child. It's not that I am telling you to live scared it's just teenagers do not have the ability to see the consequences of their actions (I was once a teenager to, a very stupid one at that-I'm 27 btw) and forseeing a situation is not something that has been developed yet. I'm just saying your parents only have your best interest at heart , but they should also allow you to make mistakes on your own, this is how the ability to predict future outcomes is developed. I think they just don't want to see that their baby girl is growing up a needs some space.|`|ZSBZ83Dpaa	Your parents seem overprotective. They may find it difficult to accept that you are not their cute little girl any more, or they may be overly fearful that something bad may happen to you. This is difficult for you to change. The best approach may be to involve other adults and make them talk to your parents on your behalf, pointing out that you are a reasonable young lady (which you are, from what you have said here). Perhaps you can talk to an aunt or uncle, or a friend of your mom's, or a parent of one of your friends whom your parents already know, or even a teacher. They could let your parents know what the "going rate" is among people your age in your community, and then you take it step by step, making sure you call home when you're out beyond 9 p.m., letting your parents know where you are, etc.<br>  See, for parents it is often difficult to let go of their children. They too have to learn, and by being nice and ready to compromise you can help them do so.

6SwaWSoyaa	I like Emma Rae better than Emilee and Ally. <br>  I also like Alexis Rae or Alexa Rae.|`|syrh8J6Vaa	Amelia Rae<br>  Hayli Rae<br>  Allyson Rae (Ally)|`|R2OMEjrhaa	I like them both,but Ally is my favorite, but I think it is just because my daughters name is Allyson Rileigh. So Yea I like Ally. I  too I am a young mom. I had my daughter when I was 17(got pregnant when I was 16) It isnt easy,But my daughter is my world. So dont let people make you fell bad or anything. Your going to give baby a wounderful life. Anyways some other names:<br>  <br>  Isabel <br>  Autumn<br>  Kiera<br>  Madelyn<br>  Alexis|`|KOcCenrEaa	Allyson I love but I like Emily<br>  My cousin is Allison Emily<br>  maybe you could use that<br>  so you both use the names <br>  you like and she could go by either|`|3lV7ZY3raa	love Emilee Rae. not so much Ally, as its a ridiculously common name.<br>  <br>  p.s congrats on the baby!|`|ot0TqzSvaa	How about Rylee Mae?<br>  <br>  Of your suggestions, i prefer Emilee.<br>  ? Bee|`|NePgB9b2aa	Both of those sound very nicknamey/trendy. Think about it- could it something suit a professional? Can you see a Dr. Emilee or President Ally Rae? How about Emmeline or Emily, or Allison nickname "Ally"?|`|K6XZ18uHaa	i like the name emilee rae!<br>  but my some of the names i like are:<br>  Leilana Brooklyn<br>  Lula Madison<br>  Madeline Taylor<br>  Lula Grace<br>  Brooklyn Grace<br>  <br>  good luck!  :]|`|YgzpSbxdaa	I prefer Emilee. Ally seems incomplete.|`|DEyTBQ1yaa	Emme Rae<br>  <br>  Amy Rae<br>  <br>  <br>  (they are Emilee and Ally mixed together)|`|vgQBoU4Uaa	I love your first names and middle name,<br>  but Aly Rae sounds really bad together.|`|4mSpN3Rxaa	i like emilee rae.|`|NqMx7YOtaa	How about Calie Rae?|`|Lo5yiBqzaa	I like them both.|`|O1WkxVMlaa	Raffi Rae =D hey name wise im sure what ever you pick will be good but here is some helpful advise never fight in front of the baby if he leaves its not the end of the world many people will still like you if you can get help from your mom and dad..and when little Rae is at the age to go to school invest in a fast skilled carrer such as EMT basic so you can earn a better living for the both of you good luck|`|wRHhpanmaa	Allyson Emilee Rae ___________<br>  <br>  you can put them together and give her 2 middle names.

gP0gYbBaaa	beautiful name. <br>  its love.|`|ot0TqzSvaa	For a girl, definately!<br>  Although I MUCH prefer Rylee Taylor..<br>  <br>  If you're set on using Taylor as the first name, maybe you can consider some more feminine spellings... eg Tayla or Taela...<br>  <br>  For a boy, the way you spell Rylee is too feminine... But Riley is okay for a guy.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped,<br>  ? Bee|`|R2OMEjrhaa	For a girl. My daughters name middle name is Rileigh, I really like this spelling it makes it more feminine. Her names is Allyson Rileigh|`|4mSpN3Rxaa	not together. Taylor Rae sounds better for a girl.|`|GdgHSFY4aa	oh my goodness.. i think that is the most adoreable name i ahve ever heard!!!! my sister used to be obsessed with that name! haha.. she used them in her little stories she would make up... i think that would fit a boy or a girl... also Rylee Taylor would be cutest for a girl.. and Taylor Rylee for a boy.. but it would be cute either way for either of them ,.. hah.|`|6hb04Ow0aa	Taylor is pretty masculine, and so is Riley, but Rylee looks more girly. I'd go with Tyla or Tayla/Taila for a girl and Taylor/Tayler or Tyler for a boy. It's really up to you though.|`|Tmr7f3Xgaa	I don't like Taylor. Sounds like a last name and you can't tell if it's a girl or boy. I think you ought to know if a person is a he or she by their name.|`|vgQBoU4Uaa	i don't like the name at all, sorry<br>  but if you really want to name your child that<br>  then it must be a girl<br>  i think it is too feminine for a boy.|`|F49y3gImaa	For a girl, it's freakin' ADORABLE! :D<br>  I don't like it when people misspell names just so they will be unique, but I actually think that the way you spelled Rylee is cute :)|`|n0WnEIopaa	I like Rylee Taylor better but its cute the other way too, I like it for either a boy or girl, but girl more.|`|yV2c25RTaa	ya its ok 4 a girls name|`|biKMQ2I1aa	does it matter what "we" like? it is your child??|`|VHJ6Jp5qaa	Yes i love it for either sex but i tend to like the name taylor for more of a girl name<br>  my nieces name is taylor and my first born i was told was a girl and i had the name taylor picked out but when my first turned out to be a boy i changed it|`|qnZk5uSCaa	ACTUALLY I THINK IT WOULD BE GREAT FOR EITHER.<br>  SO IF U PLAN THE NAME WITH OUT KNOWING THE SEX OF YOUR CHILD..THAT WOULD BE A PERFECT ONE..CAUSE IT CAN BE USED EITHER WAY|`|5nwDq07Uaa	Maybe not such a good idea to name the child you aborted.|`|7jXChfBNaa	i like it for a girl... it's very cute.|`|jyqep8QOaa	Sounds lame.|`|YGPTg5hqaa	OMG<br>  BEST NAME EVERRR<br>  <br>  THAT GIRL IS SOOOO LUCKY|`|RSWsmYAYaa	no|`|XkWTsyJdaa	better for a girl by far. for a boy, 2 b/g names is slightly too girly. id prefer if u'd make the girls first name Rylee and do a more girly middle name to balance it out. but taylor rylee is fine|`|6SwaWSoyaa	It doesn't fit well together. I like Taylor and Riley (spelled that way) for boys.
qYVqSMDyaa	I am so sorry. I had an ectopic pregnancy last month but they had to remove my right tube along with my right ovary. You'll have pain off an on probably for a few months until your body gets back to it's normal cycle. If the pain gets worse I would definatly call your ob and schedule an appointment. Just hang in there. I think your chances of having a healthy pregnancy is very good. I lost a tube and an ovary and my chances only dropped 15%. Good luck with everything! Just keep your head up and try not to stress about having another kid right now. I know it's hard. Just take care of yourself!|`|oqUlYXqtaa	yes some pain can be normal during this phase, but contact your doctors if it becomes to uncomfortable for you.<br>  you can also ask fertility specialists online for free, and find others going through similar situations with past ectopic pregnancies, try fertilityties.com<br>  good luck!!!!!
hPkSWRAkaa	It worked for me! It said I was going to have a boy and I did!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	:) it's not scientific at all, just for fun...but I think it's fun!!!! :)<br>  <br>  It got it right with my first pregnancy and we think we are haivng a boy this time (due to an earlier ultrasound) which would make it right again. I also asked all my friends and family and 7 out of the 8 had it guess correctly as well. I asked a while back on here and it had worked for the majority of people as well. I think it's a lot of fun!|`|giRRCXU4aa	It worked for me, but that was definitely just coincidence. It definitely didn't work for any of my friends. I wouldn't rely on it.|`|AA11882884	when i checked about 10 children of my friends and family it worked for them,  iT worked for the 2 of my 3 kids only though. <br>  <br>  also, notice, there is more than one lunar calender on line and they give different answers1<br>  <br>  I used this for my 3rd because I really wanted a boy, and ended up with a cute little baby girl!
M1KYxcvSaa	It would be around the 23rd.|`|fec699811ba6e1b0d043374af7afd151aa	Your fertile days were from the 16th-20th of February|`|NShMySwBaa	It depends on your cycle. For example I have a long luteal l phase (the time between when I ovulate and when I start my cycle over) of 17 days normally. You can find out by using ovulation predictor kits or by tempting go to <a href="http://www.fertilityfriend.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fertilityfriend.com/</a> for extra help with that. Good Luck and lots of baby dust to you!!|`|jY28SNtcaa	O.K., first off stop trying and just let things go the way that things are meant to go. Second, get as drunk as you can and jump his bones while he is trying to sleep. It has worked twice for us.
3rda58OCaa	Eek, I am not sure that your bf is going to think this prank is very cool, but you should get a pregnant (or recently pregnant) person to pee on it.  That is the only way i know.  Unless you borrow one from someone who saved one from their previous pregnancy.  Have fun, you sneaky girl!|`|wiAVa1H5aa	You could use a ovulation test when you ovulate, they don't have the test name on the stick usually and it looks like a pregnancy test - just put it with a pregnancy test box.|`|yDWcYXl5aa	A drop of blue food coloring diluted over the test area.<br>  <br>  It's not a cool prank, but it could be a way of getting both of you to wake up and use better birth control.|`|EZFHa4NIaa	Draw "+" sign on the pregnancy test after wetting it. That should be enough to fool him. Just make sure you have second one ready when he asks you to redo it.|`|gdCqKl89aa	You can buy a positive used pregnancy test on ebay...or list a wanted add on craigslist...we sold ours for $10 :-) when we were preggo!|`|PBI3tCKaaa	There is no way unless someone pregnant pees on it.  That is a horrible prank by the way.
xq7S9H5Raa	not necessarily.  Sometimes they have their father's blood type.
256cVXsmaa	Oh god I feel that same exact way everyday of my life.  I no it's selfish but it's harmless to think this way, as long as we don't act on it (drinking that is).  I mean my boyfriend isn't pregnant so he goes out with his friends all the time and I just feel so alone sitting at home caring for our child inside me. It drives me crazy at times, it's so unfair.  I love being pregnant and feeling him inside me but it's so overwhelming.  When your young it is likely you are the only one that is pregnant in your group of friends so you tend to be at home by yourself all the time.  Luckily I have a friend that is pregnant with me so I can go see her and we just lie around and what not but it is still VERY boring and it gets old fast.  I just feel like life has been so pointless lately because there is absolutely nothing to do, I find myself wishing time would past faster.  I even get to the point where I force myself to sleep all day long because, what else is there for freakin do. It's quit annoying. I just can't wait till the little one comes out!!! than I will always be busy! lol.<br>  Your not alone on this.  i think it partially is hormones but some of the feelings should be normal for anyone when you are stuck at home doing nothing everyday lol|`|ejQ3yg9Naa	Your not alone. But you just have to look at as you've gotten to a different stage in your life, that's what I do. And what we're doing is much more meaningful than what they're doing. Try finding some more younger mom's in your area who are where you are. Your friends will get their eventually but just remember your life just got a whole lot more rewarding than just being drunk on a Friday night.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Nah, its not just you. I was pregnant at 19 and when all my friends where out livin la vida loca, I was getting fat and depressed. <br>  Why don't you join some mother baby programs|`|vuEyUbsgaa	When I was pregnant I was still going out. But now since I've had my son I dont really go anywhere anymore. Its so boring just sitting here everyday.|`|35kVNi5oaa	yes, same thing going on over here.|`|hTieELhTaa	why dont you still go out and hang out with them? Just cuz you cant drink dont mean you cant have fun right? Or you could have a glass of red wine when you go out with them. Have you told your frineds that you feel like this? Maybe they think you want to be alone maybe they feel like you dont want to be invited out. If their your frinds they should care that your feeling lonely and do something to help. Thats what friends are for right?|`|acf04d254df37f166e0d974c5d4b2136aa	This makes me so sad, I can only say that it sounds like you are not ready to have a baby.  It is quite natural that you want to go out and have a good time I most certainly did when I was young and I am so glad I did as now I have children I am happy to be in with them as I waited until I was 37 to start my family and I had partied and been to most parts of the world first.  I so wish you young girls would enjoy life before you have children, it is so true that you are only young once, you should enjoy it.|`|1VdgsZPoaa	I was always like that when I was pregnant.  I was pregnant from the time I was 15 into age 16 and while all my other friends were out partying, and drinking, etc.  I was inside, just being fat and lazy waiting for my kid to pop out.  I still kind of feel that way and I am 25.|`|VNQHUIo1aa	yeah my friends still do that to me... and my kids are both tots...so just ask them to go somewhere u can as well like go out to eat or something fun....that don't involve drinking|`|KlWWh3fgaa	I life is school, work, homework, and my daughter. <br>  <br>  My friends are 16 & I'm 16. I don't blame them for not taking interest in me anymore. In all honesty I don't care. I love the time I have with my daughter. I like it because I know she'll never take advantage of me, or ditch me when I can't go to the hot parties or cheerlead anymore. I know that her (my daughter's) love is unconditional ::: vise verse. To my friends I don't matter anymore. They don't matter to me anymore. My social life isn't my priority anymore. I'm sure when I'm older, I'll be capable of balancing things, and making everything an importance. But, at this moment in time I need to prove to myself that I can be the best of the best. You will learn how to balance things too. Just give it time. Depending on your friends, I doubt their going to show much interest. Everything depends on their age. Your family is what you need now.|`|F8KmTbqjaa	Real friends would make time for you weather they drank or not!  I was pregnant young (21) all my friends drank and partied but made time to come see me and feel the baby move and hang out.  They always brought me food too!  : )  It sounds like you need some new friends!  I would suggest to try and meet some other expecting Mom's to hang out with.  Drinking is not the only thing people do to have fun.
dqvZmj22aa	Addiction is a word that gets thrown around a lot.  I don't think it's an addiction until you lose a job, marriage or ruin a career over something.  Until it gets THAT much of a hook in your life it's still a bad habit, not an addiction.<br>  <br>  You may be more into it that is good for you, however.  But you may just need to set it aside and get other hobbies.  I'd have to talk to you to know.|`|AA12069058	You can be addicted to it, but at such a young age it is most likely not an addiction, just an infatuation. Good lUCK?|`|SWOeg0jFaa	yes they can.
UgIOVl1jaa	Spicy food will definitely be contributing to your heartburn.  If you want to avoid it, eat more mild foods ie the more bland the better.  Don't eat an hour before bed, if you are going to lie down after food be sure to at least prop yourself up a little to help your digestion.  At the first sign of heartburn drink a glass of milk (this usually helps), if that doesn't help, then try Mylanta, that always works for me.  Acidic foods will also cause heartburn ie sugar, tomatoes etc.  Hope this helps :)<br>  <br>  PS - can't comment on the hairy part lol but I'd guess that's an old wives tale :)|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Try drinking milk and sitting at  a reclined angle. Spicy foods DO aggravate heartburn so I would steer clear of those foods. <br>  <br>  Heartburn does NOT make your baby hairy. Whoever told you that is an idiot.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Well, you need to ask your OB as all of them have different viewpoints on medication safety, but mine recommended taking an acid reducer, like Pepcid, daily to prevent heartburn since I was getting it severely as well with no relief from Tums.<br>  <br>  Spicy foods can cause irritation and more heartburn but honestly you would probably have it even if you didn't eat them. It's very common in pregnancy. And the whole hairy baby/heartburn thing is just an old wives tale.<br>  <br>  Hope you feel better. :]|`|DErBSfZgaa	No, when women get alot of heart burn is because the baby<br>  usually has a full head of hair. how does it make sense?<br>  i don't know but it's usually true. lol. <br>  <br>  and get Prilosec :)<br>  <br>  go to this site and it'll tell you about it<br>  but make sure you talk to your doctor since your prego<br>  <br>  <br>  P.s-i know people in my family who use it and it works.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	The hair thing is an old wives tale...it could go either way.  The reason we get heartburn is because the baby and the uterus is crowding your stomach and leaving less room.  This is also why we get constipated...your intestines get cramped.  It is best to eat really small meals often and keep taking the tums.|`|y5sWmbtnaa	My doctor put my on Prilosec?, I had heart burn so bad it gave me an ulcer in my esophageus. Ask your doc first though. You can also Take Zantac 75?|`|Ueix2Q7Taa	I got heartburn from eating toast when pregnant it was that bad. Try drinking milk and laying down for a while. I ate tums like they were candy. I literally had heartburn my whole third trimester and my baby doesn't have a whole bunch of hair. He's has a normal amount but not alot.|`|35kVNi5oaa	Try drinking milk, or eating ice cream, and the thing about the baby being hairy is wrong..|`|lfhnChXXaa	I never suffered with heartburn until I was pregnant.<br>  My son did have a very full head of hair.<br>  I lived on Mylanta, but you should ask your Doctor or pharmicist first.
EmhBDHMtaa	you can test in the morning when the pregnancy hormones is most present..if negative...and still no period wait until next week this time and retest if still no period.<br>  <br>  If you took one 2weeks ago it was probably to early to tell...|`|lc2WYfeTaa	Well, if it's 3 weeks late and you are having these symptoms, I would go to the dollar store and pick up a pregnancy test!! At least if it says your not pregnant you didn't spend a fortune to find out!!!|`|IoWoDxG8aa	If you are 3 weeks late you should take a pregnancy test.|`|uAZlvHgiaa	Take a pregnancy test. They are so cheap. I don't know why people continue to ask if they are pregnant. This is not a physic hot line.|`|PJH9vHf1aa	Go to Wal-Mart (they're open 24 hours) Get a Pregnancy test. Follow the directions.|`|SmWuSrHYaa	Did you take a test??|`|35kVNi5oaa	um take a test|`|SzMH2na0aa	i would call you doctor's office and ask for a blood test to be sure.
SSM3u4l4aa	The soreness might go away, it might not. It depends on the person honestly. There are things that can help with that though. Get a really, really, really, really good support bra. Something that minimizes the bouncing. I talk from experience on that part. I went from a C to a DD before it was all over with and boy were they sore! Enough support for them should help some.<br>  <br>  The itchiness and peeling has to suck! Um.. have you tried Vaseline on them? You could put that on your areolas when you are at home with an old worn out bra over it to keep it from making a mess of your shirts. That will help with the peeling.. it should anyway. <br>  <br>  And sorry hun but they will probably get bigger. The average growth is about two cup sizes. After DD there is E and then EE. I feel for your poor back already. Mine never went down after I had my baby (three years ago) and they are a full DD. My back always seems to ache. <br>  Once again I have to recommend a good support bra to help with that.|`|Qn2gU67Jaa	I had the same issue of sore breasts when I was pregnant. What helped me was to get a bigger bra for the daytime and wear sleeping bra at night. You can get the sleeping bra's in the maternity stores. <br>  In terms of how big can they get, I too started as a D-cup and I went up to a G-cup (sorry!). I was sure that my breasts were trying to stay head of my belly. They did come down to an E-cup after the baby was born. I can't tell you if they go back to original size after breastfeeding, because I'm still breastfeeding. Most of the other mother's I know, their breasts returned to their original size after breastfeeding, if that helps.<br>  As for the peeling, I wouldn't put baby oil on, try one of the nipple creams for breastfeeing mothers that you can get in the drup store. Ask the Pharmacist to help you.<br>  I hope that helps.
DWl8nfyWaa	My friend was in that same situation once.  She sent him the pictures and a few weeks later, he turned on her and threatened to print them and hand them out to people if she didn't stop talking to one of her guy friends.  She thought she could trust him and he turned out to be a jerk.  So, I would say that your friend shouldn't give him the pictures.  He may seem like a nice boy now, but there's always a chance he could be a real jerk and use them against her in the future.|`|DkT8znckaa	Actually, if you're underage and you send nude pictures to anyone it's illegal. It qualifies as child pornography. If she sends the pictures to her boyfriend, if he's underage it is distributing pornography to a minor. These are major offenses, and they mean jail time! Teens can be registered as sex offenders for this stuff! 4 to 5 months is really short, especially for being in school. There is no reason to send naked pictures. If he really wants to see her naked, they can do that in person.... although it wouldn't be advised. If the pictures do get around, she can get in serious trouble, not only with the law but in school too. It could cost her membership of any clubs and/or sports teams. Naked pictures are very bad. Below if you read the article there is a lot of info on nude pictures and statistics and such. That's where I found out that if you sent them, you could be charged with child porn.|`|9zwSclnLaa	Nope, the only way a guy should see you nude is up close and personal.  When pictures of yourself naked get in the wrong hands it is always ALWAYS a bad idea.  They always ALWAYS end up getting sent around.  Boys like to brag.|`|459948c9c4124486ce62f73d24b95fe3aa	He'll send them around.  Tell her not to do it.  If she is underage she could be in trouble, and so could anyone that recieved the photos because they would be considered child porn.  Boys always show their friends, always.  Even if it's just one he is going to tell and show a friend.  Tell her no.  It's a stupid idea to send anyone naked pictures of yourself.|`|2GGgllKeaa	She should not do it. I even read about these girls who got arrested for sending pics of themselves naked to their bfs. They got arrested for sending child pornography because the police were all saying that they are children and now they may be called sexual predators. Plus people will call her names and all, the guy will send it around they always do. Plus most of all it is wrong to do and she should act more morally.|`|bKkea7fyaa	my friend had the same thing and then one day her mum found the pic n yeh shes in trouble for quite some time n i know shes silly for nt deleting it but i would say dnt do it|`|9cwFzgl5aa	Send them, but cut your head off of the picture.  That way, you get the trill of sending them but it cant come back to bite you.|`|zWowRddEaa	Don't because he might send them around and  some guys only try for booty nothing more so no only in person not any other way|`|xoobWcWxaa	haha my boyfriend asks for them too but tooooo many times i hear about them getting around b.c some how someone else gets there hads on it even if he doesnt want one of his friends to see it i garuntee that someone will|`|qFDcKWlbaa	i was just watching the news and some girl did that for her bf and they broke up and he sent it to some girls and it got everywhere! she ended up killing herself.|`|kRaVa0Wraa	DO. NOT. LET. HER. SEND. THEM!!<br>  <br>  it'll get sent around.<br>  trust me.<br>  i am 100% positive.<br>  and she will be called a whore.<br>  if he wants to see her naked i guess he'll have to wait. :)
6ldBBuWSaa	Have you ever tried confronting your mother about this? Tell her what you feel and what's been happening.<br>  If she laughs at you again, tell her that it's true.Tell her, what you've been doing.<br>  Is she proud of you? When you get straight A's?<br>  Personally I feel that they are being quite rude.<br>  Hope this helps. Add some more info, and hopefully I can help you some more.|`|txEMWye4aa	When I was about that age the same thing happened to me. I know that its not fair but its a part of growing up i understand what your saying but you will eventually get over it im 17 now and no one still buys me anything and my mom does the same thing for dinner she calls my brother, sister, and her husband to come and eat and leaves my food in the pot. (lol)|`|zTiHCq51aa	Well it's simple they just don't like you!
YYJ2SlKbaa	Well how young is young? I mean, yeah it's wrong for 3 year olds to be getting pregnant, but really, that's not even possible|`|PLbmKNpvaa	Looking at it from a biological standpoint, It CAN be wrong. It depends on the person and their age. I say that it could be wrong only because up until a certain point the female body isn't able to carry a pregnancy without some bad consequences. Sure, at 11 or 12 you may get your period (or even younger) but it doesn't mean that your body can cope with it. Obviously everyone is different, but that doesn't mean that it should be attempted without knowledge of the risks involved.<br>  <br>  As to a moral standpoint... Well, that's impossible to answer as everyone's opinion is different, and depends on your definition of "young".|`|YNH2fmYWaa	not wrong. <br>  <br>  sometimes not smart.  and it also depends on the age.|`|y9N3DsKBaa	Wrong based on what criteria? Everyone does not use the same set of standards. And how young is young?|`|7zMtmKJaaa	not wrong just irresponsible|`|35kVNi5oaa	I don't think so.|`|qtCO2p6maa	Not at all, when i turn 18 i think i'll have one of those clinically induced babies, cuz i don't believe in premarital sex.|`|DpOF55c9aa	Not wrong or irresponsible it just depends on the maturity of both the parents to be|`|h5cFkP35aa	wrong? no. irresponsible? yes.
ZllkWRIOaa	Talk to him... One big thing is I HATE girls that talk to EVERY guy.
CRvdmFwCaa	I think a lot of women masterbate.  And I think there would be a lot less pregnacies if girls would masterbate instead of using a real penis to satisfy them.  There is nothing wrong or shameful about it.  I think guys do it alot sooner and a lot more than girls though....|`|rK1nSum8aa	Yes. A lot of girls do it and a lot of girls don't do it. Some of them might be saying that and others might really think its gross. Its all personal preference.
35kVNi5oaa	Tell her it's your life|`|fUsb2Ihraa	The best thing to do is to just talk to her. I think if you listen about what she wants for you and take it into consideration, and she listens to you and hears what you want and take it into consideration then nay situation will work itself out.|`|3ev65eAvaa	Be patient, you just have one mother. Tell her that you love her.|`|tlfEHsdiaa	tell her how u feel in a poem <br>  <br>  www.perfect-poems.com|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Pick her

AA10015577	It takes around 3-4 weeks to get a positive pregnancy test and feel some symptoms.  You wouldn't feel anything yet.  <br>  <br>  Some symptoms are nausea, fatigue, frequent urination, sore/tender breasts, odd sensations in the pelvic region, and food aversions/cravings.  The ones you feel most earliest are sore breasts and frequent urination, but remember everyone is different!  HTH!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You cannot physically get pregnancy symptoms until after implantation. Implantation does not occur until at the earliest 4 days after sex, at the latest 16. You start getting symptoms at the earliest 3 days after implantation, no earlier. When implantation occurs your body realizes it's pregnant and start to produce HCG, the pregnancy hormone. It takes a few days (usually 7) for your body to start feeling the effects of the hormone and therefor get symptoms.<br>  <br>  You are not experiencing pregnancy symptoms.|`|AA11476951	You won't notice till at least 4 weeks or so|`|YNH2fmYWaa	not at all. once you have intercourse and the sperm reaches the egg, it will take 6-12 days for implantation to happen, which is the egg attatching to your uterus.<br>  <br>  then most people still don't have any symptoms until a few weeks after implantation.<br>  <br>  so its just best to wait and see if you get your next period.|`|eemmWU0Haa	no, not that soon but everyone is different good luck.
