When I worked as a bather I couldn't believe how many people took their dog to the groomers for just a bath.....tiny, small, medium, and large.   Versus doing it themselves.      I wash both my dogs myself (my poodle goes to the groomer for grooming)  I just didn't realize nor do I understand why people send their dogs in just for a bath.      Why?         (I bathe both labs in my family in the tub, my uncle bathes his boxers in the tub)      I couldn't believe someone sent in a tiny little chihuahua just for a bath.      I'm not criticizing I'm just curious about this.....i never realized.      It was a learning experience

I also want to try him at agility, which I'm doing in 2 weeks.  The other dog would be a great agility dog (speed, energy, and drive are all there), and I'm going to try her out on it in 2 weeks as well.      What exactly is involved in these events during competitions?   Are there different skill levels in the competition?      I'm going to the UKC Premier show in June, and want to try my dog at obedience and agility depending on if he likes it.  I want to know what I can do until then to prepare him.

Don't get me wrong, I still hang out with people, but sometimes, animals just seem to treat me better. Of course I have friends that are people, but sometimes there are people that make fun of me or try to bully me and I really don't like it. When I hang out with animals, they understand how I am feeling. I always treat them nicely and they treat me the same way. I also try to be nice to people, but it doesn't always work out. Even my parents don't treat me well sometimes (they usually do treat me nicely, but a couple of times things have gotten rough.) The animals that I hang out with never get rough with me. I have been good with animals my whole life. They understand me and I understand them. Sometimes, I just think that it would be better to be an animal (I would like to be a horse because they are my favorite animal.)      Please don't make fun of me or anything. I just wanted to get some opinions.

My shiba inu has been on Lotus Chicken kibble (22% protein) with a little bit of ground chicken mixed in for about 5 months. He was getting bored of it and had started to get loose stools so over 2 weeks I gradually switched to Wellness Core Chicken/Turkey which is a grain free 6 star dog kibble. He liked it at first and then started refusing to eat any of it. Then explosive diarrhea started after 2 weeks. Has anyone else had problems with this higher protein kibble? I'm stumped now which kibble to go back to. My vet has him on Hills Science ID canned for now so I have to transition back to a kibble. Any suggestions. I've looked at the food analysis website but the best kibbles seems to have very high protein content.

She has lost weight, and eats her food better when I mix rice or egg whites (the main ingredient in her kd food) in it.

He was having fits and they ran a set of blood tests which all came back clear with the exception of his calcium being "a little bit low".

She then treated him for poisoning but says he's not responding.      I don't understand, surely poison would show in his blood tests?      If you can't be sensible please don't reply!

20090226121159AA0wM6Y	Pets;Dogs	My Shih-Tsu is acting very strangely.  I'm very worried.  Please help.?	Okay, so my dog usually gets very hyper when it's eating time or when someone is at the door but lately she's not been.  All she does is sit and nothing more.  I have to move her to food and to her bed.  However when she goes for walks outside she seems perfectly fine.  We took her to the vet and the vet said she had back problems and prescribed pain-killing medicine.      She is still acting strangely.  I don't think this is just a back problem because she walks fine outside.  But inside she'll go to the middle of the bathroom, a place she never used to enter, and just sit down all day.  If we remove her, she'll return.  At night, (she usually sleeps on my bed) she jumped off my bed and somehow found a place under my bed to sleep.  She got stuck and began barking.  It nearly scared me to death and took me forever to find her.      She still empties her bowels regularly, but has recently stopped eating.  I tried petmd.com but that was useless and the vet keeps insisting that it's back pain.  If you know what's wrong please help.       She's 11 years old, if that helps.

He came with most of his shots done, besides rabies and neutering. (we need to double check his forms to know which shots for certain.)      I called up a grooming agency which i like the sound of earlier, and they told me that we cannot get him groomed there without proof of his puppy shots from 16 weeks old, we still need to arrange this. However, his nails are dangerously long, another place we know of doesn't need the proof of shots to book an appointment, so if we book him up there to get him groomed, will it be safe? Or would it be a safer bet to have his nails clipped, have the shots done and then have him fully groomed?      Any advice is really appreciated,      Thank you in advance.

20090226110410AA9rX9u	Pets;Dogs	Is my dog sick? She is very lethargic...?	My dog is 4 years old. She is a chocolate lab and this morning we noticed she is very lethargic, not enjoying her walks or greeting other dogs in the neighborhood as usual.      I also noticed her mouth seems dry. Her nose is still wet, but she walks so slowly (which is extremely unlike her).      She seems sick but if she is, what sort of illness could this be?
20090226110635AAfHFg8	Pets;Dogs	2 year old dog still doing business on floor!?	Getting ridiculous.  We got him when he was 10 months old, he was strictly an outdoor dog then, but we got into a routine and he did very well after about a month of going outside and waiting until we come home to go.  Went about 6 months and then one day we came home to a mess on the floor, we scolded him and brought him right outside, and still continue to do this.. but it's been about 6 months and he is STILL doing this.  I'm now unemployed and have been home a lot more, and when I'm home all day he doesn't go on the floor.. If i leave for 5 minutes to get the mail or something, i come back to a mess... What is going on!?   He isn't fixed yet (sooooon!!!) but I didn't think this would have much to do with it.  Any suggestions? Am I doing things wrong??  We cannot crate train him, we initially tried as soon as we got him but he freaks out as soon as we leave the room.  Any suggestions would be appreciated... I'm sick  of cleaning up after a 2 year old dog.

We already supplement with salmon oil, but we did switch his food recently. He is now eating Acana Pacifica, which is a grain-free, fish based food. We are in San Diego, so it's not cold/dry weather related. He doesn't have fleas. Any thoughts to what could be causing this? Anything he may be missing in his diet?

So I rescued this stray cat about 2 weeks ago and I put him into our spare bedroom to feed him and give him a warm place to stay with intentions of getting him fixed and more trusted in me. At first it was going good. He used the litter box, and let us pet him a little. But now two weeks later, it has gotten WORSE. He hides behind the dresser and won't come out or do anything. I do not want to just throw him back outside, but I don't know what to do. Do you think I should maybe put an ad on craigslist asking someone to take him that has a farm or something? That way he can be outside and still get some food and shelter? Please help!

He's just about torn it to shreds and I need to find a replacement. Unfortunately, she doesn't remember where she bought it.         So, this is what it looks like:      Its a leather printed cat teaser. The wand is made of black plastic and the teaser "string" is about 1 inch wide and made of leopard printed fake fur. On the end is a NON-DETACHABLE set of feathers and one silver bell.         I've found many that have detachable feathers, but none with just regular attached ones. This cat won't play with the wrong toy and will keep us awake at night if we don't get him another "Leo"         Also, I live in the DFW area of Texas, but I don't mind shopping online.

OK I just recently moved in a new house with my fiance and we discussed what would happen if I brought my dog with me to move in .. which was during the day she would have to stay in the basement until we got home .. well when it became bed time i put her @ the bottom of the bed and my fiance started flipping out and said she has to also sleep down in the basement at night.. what do I do .. shes living back at my mothers house for the moment but soon I will have to make a decision to either give her away or keep her down in the basement:( shes a Chihuahua that has been used to getting all the attention and is used to being near people not alone by herself .. Do you think that she will get used to the fact of staying in the basement with her chew toys and blankets during the day and @ night and just getting about 5 hrs out to roam the house free or do you think it will just be horrible punishment to her and I should get rid of her ???? Keep in mind that Im also about to have a baby and Ive had this dog every since she was 3 months old and she has been my first and only pet !!!!

20090226140009AAvurVw	Pets;Dogs	Why is my English Bulldog limping?	We noticed he was limping around (it's his back right leg) this morning.  We're not sure when it started but I felt around on his leg and everything felt normal but when I got around to the side of his leg he began quivering a bit like he was in pain.  He doesn't seem to be in much pain otherwise though.  Later on today I was checking up on him and, when I looked at his leg, I noticed a wet, yellowish spot on the inside of his ankle about halfway between his foot and kneecap.  When I touched it, I noticed I had a clear liquid on my finger that smelled kind of like pus.  He really began quivering when I touched it so I think I've definitely found the problem.  It didn't seem to be swollen or real red either.      What could be causing this?  Is this something that will eventually get better or should I take him to a vet immediately?

I need some advice, any help is welcome.   My main question is..   I have two saddles right now, both of them are very important to me. I realize I probably won't be lucky enough to find someone with their own tack (of course if they did I would check the fit carefully). One of them is a really really nice AP in pretty much new condition. The other is a very nice older close contact, in good condition for its age but clearly not new. The CC is my jumping and show saddle, the AP is for flatwork. I'm probably going to only let the leaser use the CC since its already worn, but would it be fair for me to put in my lease contract that they must replace any tack they break? Or is that too sketchy sounding and would that frighten too many people off?

20090226144754AAJHRsI	Pets;Dogs	Dog not pottying. Please help?	A day ago my dog ate about ten pieces of juicy fruit. I talked to the vet, he said he should be fine. But, he hasn't pooped since then. Well, I take that back, he pooped almost immediately after eating the gum... but there's no way ten pieces of gum could have passed that fast. He didn't take another potty the rest of that day, and hasn't today either. I am waiting on an answer from the vet, so I thought I'd ask in the mean time. Do you think his lack of pottying is being caused by the gum, or what? I am starting to worry about him. He's acting like his normal old self, though. Sorry for the details. Thanks in advance.

It is a shame. She had a collar on so I don't understand why no one would bother putting any effort into looking for the dog. (No id though).      Anyways, I was thinking. If her owners just by chance (slim) happened to find her now (she is still with us) would we be required to give her back to them? I mean if they had proof that they owned her?      She came to us (she is a mutt) pregnant and we let her have her babies here and we rehomed them and then we got her spayed. So if the owners were allowed to have her back after all this would we be allowed to make them reimburse us for what we have spent at the vet on her?

I have a new dog, he is a shelter rescue and we're guessing about 1.5 to 2 years old. I have had him exactly 28 days now and this is the first dog I've had that's mine all mine and totally my responsibility. I have to work obviously and when I do I leave him in a gated section of the apt free from computer cords and expensive shoes. He has a soft bed, toys and a bone to chew. When I return, I notice everything is exactly where I left it. Bone sits unlicked, treats from Kong lay openly on the floor in plain sight (mentioning now that this dog is extremely food driven). The bed, I don't think even gets used. I am pretty sure he sits and waits until I get home.  He doesn't drink water or anything. Is this what dogs do?

20090225112321AAmWd6r	Pets;Dogs	Sores on my Chihuahua's ears?? Important (with pic)?	So my Chihuahua is 7 months old.. And she has these round crusty-ish sores on her ears (inside). Also along the top outline inside her ears it looks like the hair is missing along the edge. She doesn't itch them.. Never whines.. When I touch them she doesn't care, unless for too long then she moves her head away or shakes it..       I have already taken her to the vet 3 times!!   The first time he said, just put neosporin on it.   The second time, I went back saying it did nothing, so he said put peroxide on it..   The third time I went back, a different vet was subbing for him that my dog has never been to before and she said get her checked for ring worm. But I looked up ring worm and I don't think thats what it is.      I'm really mad because my vet has not helped me! Also the first time I went to him, he said "God you worry about every little thing wrong with your dog, no need to spend money for cream, just use neosporin."      He said that because yes I do worry about every little thing.. I love her and don't want anything wrong with her.   I took her to the vet for this bump that was on her butt and he said i worry too much it's a pimple. But better safe then sorry!!      here is the best picture of her ears I have. I folded them back.. See the pink areas are the sores. This pic is from like a month ago and now there's more hair missing along the top and a few more sores!       http://i99.photobucket.com/albums/l283/I...       What is wrong with her?! Can YOU tell me what you think? Please don't say take her to the vet because I have..   Thanks

At home, she gets along great with my other ferret and she doesn't bite her. But if you pet her, she'll bite you and almost break the skin. The last time she bit, I scruffed her and tapped her nose.         Returning her is out of the question. I could not live with myself.      Is there any way to stop her biting?

20090226150148AA95bFx	Pets;Dogs	Question about Teacup Dogs?	First of all, let me start off by saying that I do not endorse the idea of breeding together two runt dogs to produce runt puppies. I don't own one, and never will.      Now that that's out of the way, what do you think the chance of of teacup dogs ever being accepted in the AKC is? I was thinking the other day about toy poodles, which are a recognized breed. Now I know that toy poodles are not nearly as tiny and delicate as a teacup breed is, but they are still a lot smaller than a standard poodle. It seems like there are several breeds of dogs that have been downsized, but are registered breeds, like the toy fox terrier and the toy Manchester terrier (although, admittedly, the latter breed is only recognized by the American and Canadian Kennel Club, and not by the UK).  Is the reason that teacup dogs aren't accepted because of all the health problems they're usually riddled with?      Also, I'm not saying that I would want teacup dogs to be considered recognized breeds, I'm just curious about why they aren't.      Thanks!

20090226152425AA3mhNt	Pets;Dogs	Questions about Terrier breeds?	Well i might soon get a Terrier Mix from the pound.   He is 10 years old and they know nothing of his past.      I was wondering if 10 year old dogs can be active?   Like do they like to run at all? Will they play? or is that not the stage they are in right now.   I'm not trying to say that i want this dog to be crazy i was just wondering if they can run. He has no medical problems      My next question is that they said that he might not be good with kids because he does not liked to be picked up.   Can the pound really make that decision? i know i wouldn't want to be picked up if i lived in a cage for so long.   I am 14 and i'm not crazy. If my little cousins came over i can always put him away with my other dog.      And my last question is:   What are terriers like? ANY information about the type of dog would be great. He isn't a specific kind but they think he is part Westie.      Anyfeed back would be great!!!      here he is:    http://www.petfinder.com/petnote/display...       THANKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I guess ill wait a couple days untill incusbtion or till I can see if its moving like most doo in a couple days.      This is what I see:     . A nice formed air sac not too big at all. Couple cm.     . Veins? I suppose.     . When I turn it one spot there is a dark mass. That may be it..      Do they sleep or take a break or are more activve at night? It was late at night like 9pm pr so and I saw it move a few days ago.      What do you think?      Fingers crossed....

Okay, i've had my cat for almost a year now. and she's not pure bred, but i know she is siamese. well, when she was little, she was really light tan. and now that she's getting older she has these two REALLY dark round grayish tannish spots by her hips/thighs. and she's getting darker colored. I was just wondering why that would be?
20090225112027AAxcNDy	Pets;Dogs	Help with crate training my yorkie?	I have a 3 month old yorkie that I got for Valentines Day. He's doing very well but I'm trying to get the potty traning down. During the night, he does very well. He wakes up 2xs to go potty. However, he doesn't bark or cry; I just hear him moving around. I let him out and he runs directly to the puppy pad. During the day, he's in his crate for about 4hours because I'm at work and leave @lunch to take him out but by the time I get there he's already pooped in his crate. How should I handle feeding and toileting. I feel bad keeping him in the crate for majority of the time but that's what the training book is telling me.   Please help.

I'm going to get a cockatiel, but first I want the cage set up...since  alot of people don't buy a cage until they get the cockatiel...but I am going to set my cage up first.      So first, I don't want to spend over $200 on a cage. I know everyone is gonna think I'm a bad person, but honestly, I can throw that extra 200 for other places more useful and I know there are cheaper cages out there that don't cost $200+. (So if you know of a great deal for a perfect cage for a cockatiel please link it to me)       BUT      What is the bar spacing supposed to be? Like from what to what? I look at some cages that have 5/8 bar spacing, but it looks really far apart and looks big enough that the tiel's head would stuck.      So please, someone help me! I can't find any site that gives bar spacing for birds!

20090226150703AAQM3kj	Pets;Birds	Is it possible my Tom Turkey is Depressed?	I have a 2 yr old Bronze  broad breasted Tom Turkey .   We've had him since he was he was a baby.    He lost his mate last fall to a dog attack.    we recently added 11 chickens to Toms pen , He was sharing the lg pen with 3 other chickens now he has 14 room mates .   We also added cracked corn feed to the pellet mixture we were feeding Tom & the other chickens.    The chickens we added were healthy looking with no signs of upper respiratory infections. Every thing was fine for the first week .    For no apparent reason Tom was hanging his head with his legs stance wide apart keeping balance .    He was not acting like he normally does. which is a semi aggressive stance and guarding of the water bucket . .    With his head hanging low I knew he wasn't feeling well so I removed him from the pen and put him in the barn in his own stall .    Now hes laying down and wont eat .    I got him some tetracycline type medicine for fowl and added it to his water . He still wont eat or drink so I force fed him some corn meal and honey water ( he was not happy about that and mustard enough energy to get to his feet ) but shortly after that he sat back down and hasn't gotten up since .    He truly shows no signs of illness or trauma .   The day I moved him to the barn I noticed small tracts in the snow that may have been a young raccoon or Large weasel , although missing a belly drag track in the snow making me  think is was raccoon tracks even though I didn't see the print that would be the thumb print , hence thinking it was a weasel .   either way the tracks went to the chicken coupe and again away from the coupe .   I thought maybe a coon had grabbed him causing him to go into a semi state of shock , Or Is it possible that due to spring being in the air perhaps hes lonely and depressed and only needs a girlfriend .    Any ideas are welcome .    Im continuing to force feed him antibiotics and polenta mush.    Grandpa is a DVM and recommends I butcher him and stick him in the oven before I ruin him with antibiotics.    He is a pet and Id like to see him well .    Im open to ideas.    Thanks.

I know everyone buries their pets anyway, and there's not really a way to enforce this law, so i always thought it was just one of those joke laws that you're supposed to follow but if you don't nothing bad will really happen.   I think maybe there's a possibility it can spread disease or something?   Are you supposed to call animal control to pick up the body?   I know a neighbor of mine tried to throw out a deer from hunting and the garbage man had to call animal control to pick it up and dispose of it properly.

I breed mice (fancy mice only) but aswell as that, I also care for orphaned field mice (usually either 1 or 2 that get dropped off after their mother had been either killed by a cat or some other horrible thing).   Recently though, I got my first ever litter bigger than 2; I got in a litter of 9 beautiful babies.    Well, I raised them until their fur grew, eyes opened and were able to wean like always but now when its the time to separate males from females, I check and all 9 of the babies are boys. (I know how to check so don't say I must be mistaken)   Might there be a genetic problem? I have never heard of this before but then again, I have never had a litter of 9 that were not normal fancy mice.

And I adopted a 7 month old 40 lbs pit bull from the pound about 2 weeks ago and they were getting along just fine until earlier when they had a fight and my pit bull had my papillon by the neck. My papillon was screaming cause he was scared and probably hurt, and if I hadn't been there to pull my pit bull off of him with all my force he could have been dead.      I REALLY don't want to take my pit bull back to the pound, it would break my heart to leave him there. We were just starting to bond. But I also don't want to risk the well being of my papillon I love more than anything. I'll never be able to leave them alone because I can't have this happen again.      Is there anything else I can do other than take him back to the pound? :(      Only serious answers please, this is serious.

Anyways how are they otherwise. I'm not going to use it for hunting bears, but how are they for family protection? Some say the best guard dog, while others say they aren't protective? Any insight would have

20090226151731AATCePL	Pets;Dogs	Should I get my dog a friend?	I have a lab/boxer who is a year old and he loves to play.  Once I get home from work I really feel like laying down and relaxing.  It sounds fair to him to get another dog that can play with him.  What do you think?
20090226151746AACPhSa	Pets;Dogs	How do we calm down and control our dogs when we go out for a walk?	We have 2 small (maltese X) dogs. When they find out they are going for a walk they get so excited that they become impossible to control. Once they get outside, they usually spend the first 5 minutes barking and biting each other. It is making it very difficult to walk them, let alone the embarrassment when everyone thinks we are hurting out dogs. What can we do? Thank you for your help!

20090226153642AAC5mzQ	Pets;Horses	How should I feed my mare?	Okay, I have a 4 yr old mare. She gets grain & hay AM & PM. When I first got her I feed her with a normal bucket, she would go crazy! She would lay her feed bucket on top of her water bucket (so it was sideways) and eat like that! She would knock it back and forth against the wall, anything to make noise, and I mean A LOT of noise.       People said, "Oh, she's just playing" but it gets very annoying.      I switched to a ground feeder. She is a lot quieter but has now learned she can move it with her nose! When she moves it, she spills it...and my little princess doesn't like eating off the ground. Which I suppose is good.      I have a corner feeder but have not put it up yet, do you think it will do any good? Any ideas on this? She is really great in her stall she'll let you do anything. When she's eating she doesn't mind if you play with her, and never tries to bite at you while eating. It just frustrates me.       She is outside most of the time, only inside to eat & when weather gets bad.      Any details needed, i'll add them. :)      Thank ya
20090226094651AAC72id	Pets;Horses	Horse that constantly mouths at the bit...?	I have a new 7 yr old rescue gelding that hasn't been ridden in about 4 months supposedly.  I bridled him up yesterday (twice, with two different bits) and the entire time he was bridled he would "mouth" at the bit.  Not really chewing on it, just kept opening and closing his mouth.  Kind of hard to explain.  We weren't working or anything, he was just standing tied the whole time.      Anyway I don't plan on riding him for probably a couple of months, until he gains weight and muscle tone.  My question is what should I do about this mouthing thing?  Should I let him wear the bridle a lot just to get "used" to it?        His teeth and mouth are fine, btw.

It lasted a minute or so..... then she got up into a standing (on all fours) position on the sofa and then quickly fled to our kitchen.
20090226094347AAUMFGd	Pets;Cats	Free feeding cats or fixed amounts and do you think my 2 are over weight?  How to fix...?	Hi,       I recently switched my 2 cats over to Filidae cat food and noticed on the bag they should each be eating aprox 1/2 a cup a day.  I have been putting 2 cups per day in the bowl and they are still wanting more.  THey have always been free fed but I think they (especially the grey one) is overweight.  The vet never mentioned it but I never asked.      Is it recommended to put them on a feeding schedule like a dog (twice a day) or should I just let them be?  If a schedule is better or what not how do you do it? Is it 10mins with the food like a dog and then pick it up?      Any help would be appreciated. Thank you!

20090226154548AAMZIQt	Pets;Dogs	My pom is acting really weird- head bobbing...?	He was his normal self then out of the blue started acting really odd. He threw up 1 time then went to lay in his open kennel. about a half hour later I went to reach for him and he looked frightened of me for no reason and kind of looked at me like he was hallucinating and bobbing his head from side to side slightly.He also seemed off balance. He is only 6 mo. old. Last night the landlord repaired our window and I noticed some pieces of the caulking in his dog bed so I am thinking he may have ingested some that he found beneath the window that I was unaware was there-? He ate when I offered food, and about 15 min. after, he even ran around, darting around super fast, coming to me to be loved and barking his playful bark... but he then layed back down, which he keeps resorting to after I get him up and going. Anyone experience anything like this with their dog? Yes I will take him to a vet if this continues throughout the hour.
