0KmJwYunaa	Jet fuel, kerosene and diesel are all very similar and in fact there's a lot of overlap in terms of the distillates blended in to make each of them.  Typically jet fuel, kerosene and diesel will be hydrocarbons of chain lengths from 7 through 15 atoms of carbon where as gasoline and AV gas would be hydrocarbons of chain lengths of 5 through 12 carbon atoms.   On average, Diesel has a higher energy content than gasoline 37.3 MJ/l versus 34.2 MJ/l (bio-diesel has 33 MJ/l) but the real advantage is that it's not throttled.   A gasoline engine is intentionally throttled to control it's speed hence it's constantly working against a restricted airway, this is called pumping losses.    AV gas would actually be a lower octane rating than automotive gasoline due to the altitudes that a plane operates at which allows for lower octane fuels to be used without pre-ignition due to compression.   You learn this in first year Organic Chemistry, and when some idiot high school student your parents enlisted to help rebuild your car's engine blows a piston out when he puts in AV gas thinking that it's a higher octane.<br>  <br>  You won't get any carbon credits or tax breaks but you will enjoy the pleasures of burning less fuel in terms of gallons (liters in your case) and perhaps saving a bit of money.|`|npBCankMaa	there are no diesel certified engines.

Whether anyone else can do better is something we'll need to wait and see.<br>  <br>  Carbon credits aren't enough to be able to actually offset anything (if they were they'd be unaffordable), basically all they do is allow people to pay a bit of money to feel less guilt (just like the Catholic church used to do with indulgences) but when you look into the matter it turns out that most of the places that get the carbon credits would have gone ahead anyway meaning that they didn't actually help (and are a fraud).|`|0me6vDF3aa	Carbon Credits is a huge Ponzi scheme!

Why the change? Because they needed an addition to account for the cooling the Earth is experiencing).<br>  <br>  2) The facts don't support it. Polar bears populations are rising, as are ice masses in Greenland and Antarctica. The entire Co2 argument is, well, sad. Co2 makes up under 1% of greenhouse gases.

This means that most people would actually use more energy if they switched to blackle.<br>  <br>  IPS and *VA LCD panels do use more power to display white than to display black since they need to unblock the light form the backlight to display white.  Those panels tend to use more power anyway as they need more powerful backlights for the same brightness (which is why they are extremely rare on laptops which pretty much all use TN-Film) but they also tend to only be used on high end monitors due to the higher cost (colour reproduction and viewing angles are better with those technologies though, those who do graphics design really do need them).<br>  <br>  But all LCDs regardless of panel technology have a very small difference in power consumption between black and white, to the point at which I don't let power usage influence the colour scheme on my laptop (and with laptops there's actually a good reason to be obsessive about energy saving, since batteries are crap, if you have a grid connection and LCD then using blackle is more likely to be a sign of mental illness).<br>  <br>  CRTs do have a significant difference and so you can get a significant reduction in energy usage by using dark colours (since an electron gun has to be fired to light up the screen for anything other than black).<br>  <br>  Of course there's also the fact that saving energy doesn't really matter for those who don't use laptops, environmental concerns would be better dealt with by building nuclear power plants which would reduce CO2 by much more than you could get from saving energy (there's a limit to how much energy you can save and it isn't enough for wind and solar to be viable for our civilisation).<br>  <br>  Besides, most people are using a screen that uses less energy to display white.

Only then can we set an intelligent climate change policy.<br>  <br>  Unless we determine GHGs do not contribute to global warming, we should stop increasing our output of GHGs now.  One way to do so is to ban sales of new gasoline-engine cars that get less than 30 mpg.  Another is to stop offering subsidies (Via loan guarantees) for homes that are not energy efficient.  We should also encourage the use of natural gas.  We should ban natural gas flaring, and require that it be captured and sold.  We should fund natural gas digesters.

The problem is "environmentalists" get shoved under one category rather than two. Since the people who are louder and annoying are remembered better, people view environmentalists as people who are annoying and want to take away all the technology and chain themselves to trees. These peoples want to save the Earth and get in the way of people who want to "destroy" it so much that they do things that actually harm the planet without realizing it. The only people who actually doing something about the matter though would be your first group, the people enhancing technology and finding ways to save energy, which would be your environmentalists.<br>  <br>  So basically:<br>  1.

There are less eccentric environmentalists but they still believe in the same central principle.

That is a perfect example of radiant heat.<br>  <br>  convection - back to the bonfire.  Think of the flames when they are only 6 ft high.  If you are building this fire and the trees are lets say 110ft in the air, eventually they will catch fire without flames touching them because of convection heat<br>  <br>  conductive - heat transfers from the radiant heat waves to your vinyl seats.  When you sit down with bare skin a sudden transfer of heat from your vinyl to your skin occurs.  This is conductive heat. <br>  <br>  Photo-electric effect : this occurs when high energy photons interact with atoms and the atoms discharge a lower energy photon and give off a low energy electron.<br>  <br>  Sorry I can only think of four. If you had more types of energy then there are more ways or if you want to put more detail other than just solar energy (for example solar radiation, solar waves, solar light) That has six ways, 2 for each of the above listed.

We need more thinkers like this. <br>  <br>  Your idea of using living organisms is actually a big field of study right now; the general idea is "biofuel", and they can be made from virtually any kind of organism out there, from corn to bacteria. One idea that is getting a particularly large amount of attention right now is the use of algae to make a substitute for gasoline: <a href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/algae-biodiesel.htm" rel="nofollow">http://science.howstuffworks.com/algae-b...</a><br>  <br>  Another one that I personally find to be pretty exciting is the idea of using bacteria to produce hydrogen, which is a rich and versatile (and clean) energy source.

Greenhouse warming is thus about 33°K.  This is much more pronounced around the planet Venus, whose atmosphere contains over 90% carbon dioxide (CO2), a prominent greenhouse gas. Without a greenhouse effect the mean surface temperature of Venus would have been 227°K, but greenhouse warming raises it to 750°K. This represents warming by 523°K!" <br>  <a href="http://www.ias.ac.in/resonance/Mar1996/pdf/Mar1996p54-65.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ias.ac.in/resonance/Mar1996/p...</a> <br>  <br>  "If we include the effect of Terrestrial albedo which is about 30% (meaning the actual amount of solar energy absorbed by our planet is 70% of top of atmosphere irradiation), the above equation gives an average Earth surface temperature of 255 K only.

AA11813187	Drink wine and save water.<br>  <br>  HOW TO SAVE WATER <br>  <br>  Don't flush the toilet every time you use it - as the saying goes: "If it's yellow let it mellow; if it's brown flush it down". <br>  <br>  Install a dual-flush toilet - then if necessary you can use short flushs for a pee and a longer flush for the rest. <br>  <br>  Put a suitable container in your toilet cistern - this could be a brick or plastic container or so-called hippo and it will restrict the amount of water used with each flush. <br>  <br>  Turn off the tap when you brush your teeth - a running tap uses more water tha necessary. <br>  <br>  Take a shower instead of a bath - a conventional shower (as opposed to a power shower) uses around two-thirds less water than a bath. <br>  <br>  Don't use more water than you need to boil the kettle - if you're only making one or two cups of tea/coffee, you simply don't need to fill the kettle. <br>  <br>  Keep a jug of water in the fridge - then, when you want really cold water, you don't have to run the tap to get it. <br>  <br>  Don't run taps to rinse washing up - again this uses more water than you need for the task. <br>  <br>  Use cold, waste water to wash out jars for recycling - it does the job just as well. <br>  <br>  Only use the washing machine with a full load - even half-load programmes use more than half the water of a full load. <br>  <br>  Only usethe dishwater with a full load - if you have to buy more dishes and utensils, then do it. <br>  <br>  Never leave a tap dripping - if it needs a new washer, fix it. <br>  <br>  Don't use a garden sprinkler - it uses far too much water. <br>  <br>  Use plants that can withstand drought - Mediterranean species like lavenders, rosemary and cistus can survive with little water. <br>  <br>  Don't overreact to a brown lawn - it will come back with rain in the autumn. <br>  <br>  Use 'grey' water on the garden - this is old bath and washing up water (a reasonable amount of detergent will be no problem). <br>  <br>  Collect rain water - this is most easily done with the installation of a rain butt. <br>  <br>  Consider rainwater 'harvesting' - this is the posh version of a water butt and consists of a large tank that collects rain from the house guttering and pumps it into the home to be used for flushing the toilet. <br>  <br>  Wash the car with a sponge and bucket - a hosepipe uses far too much water. <br>  <br>  Consider installing a water meter - then you'll only pay for the water you actually use and having a precise measure will encourage you to economise. <br>  <br>  Report burst pipes immediately to the local water company - then make sure the burst is fixed as soon as possible.|`|CItkUGxtaa	you can find posters on save water on www.awarenessideas .com/1.water-conservation-posters-large-...<br>  Good day|`|va8quhPtaa	I think you need to draw about better utilization of available natural water resources.|`|AA12157096	jitendra answered it all..|`|QOyl6LxIaa	Never draw water directly from tap for use.

gSSF3Vx4aa	No, they are not pure. That is why people always filter and add chlorine before using it.|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	Urinating in water will not load it with bacteria, under normal circumstances. It will add nitrogen to the water, but this is not usually a problem in fresh water.<br>  <br>  Urban rivers are generally contaminated with industrial wastes. Rivers in agricultural areas are generally loaded with nitrogen, phosphorus, , pesticides, sediment, you name it. If there is gold to be found upstream, count on mercury in the water. If there is no sign of civilization at all, all you have to worry about are the occasional parasites. I guess you have to decide beforehand what you mean by "pure". No river has distilled water in it.|`|uFQFRdczaa	Very few rivers in Africa are pure.  Most are loaded with parasites.|`|SO0bBMFlaa	Harare, Zimbabwe (Jan 25 2007) <br>  <br>  The pollution of rivers, lakes and acquifers from domestic and industrial wastewater discharges, mining runoff, agro-chemicals and other sources in now a growing threat to water resources in most countries in Southern Africa.<br>  <br>  According to a new report titled: 'Water Quality Management and Pollution Control' in southern Africa, written by Prof Ngonidzashe Moyo,|`|TyqGdBw1aa	no... there are few pure rivers in the world. especially in tropic zones. because animals will go there to drink and defecate and urinate in the water... making even the fastest flowing river a bacterial cesspool always boil water from any body of water before drinking unless it's from a natural spring or a water table that has burst open|`|IXL9RPd6aa	most likely not.
kn9hQZ1xaa	I noticed that on much of the news coverage.  I guess we haven't made all that much progress in fire proof building material.  I think some one reported that hot embers were carried on the wind ahead of the fire.  Then these embers dropped onto the houses and poof.|`|uFQFRdczaa	Trees are loaded with moisture.  Houses are made of lumber, which has had most of the water removed.  Dry wood burns better than wet wood.  Once again, nature does it better.
