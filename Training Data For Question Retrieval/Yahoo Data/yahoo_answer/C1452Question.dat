Wenn Leute etwas erz?len und nicht wissen ob es eine Frau oder ein Mann ist oder es beide Geschlechter sind, dann sagen sie immer die m?nnliche Form.   Dies hatte zur Folge, dass zumindest in Texten ein "er/sie" und das sch?ne "M?nnInnen" eingeführt wurde. Ich finde, das kompliziert alles ein wenig. Sollte man nicht lieber darauf verzichten und weiter eine maskuline Sprache sprechen (Spanisch zB ist viel extremer) oder gleich neutrale Formen bilden. Also quase eine neue Sprache bilden.

20061212023854AAt9HC9	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Whats harder? Working or staying home?	No matter what gender. What would you think is harder , working 10 hours daily. Or staying home being with (your) kids and cleaning?   In my opinion working 10 hours a day , would be worse. Since work is stressful and it isn't a pleasant place to be , for some people. By this I mean getting crap from some one maybe a boss. Or people constantly calling you/asking you questions.      But staying home can be harder depending on the situation , If the kids are 10 months - 4 years old , then that might be tough.       Anyways , what's harder in your opinion? Also if you have a husband and he goes to work an you don't and you have young kids. Does he expect dinner from you all the time ? Does he expect you to do all the cleaning around the house to? If so , I think that's pretty stupid.          So , what do you think? Opinions.

I don't think that there is anything special about being Italian.....at least not any more than being from other parts of the world.

When I was 18I had a sexual relationship with a 34 year old woman, she broke up with me because I told her my real age. I met her at a bar( How I got in- Fake I.D) and we kicked it off ever since. We both shared the same level of intellect, independence and maturity...so then why when she found out I wasn't 22 but 18 she broke it off and told me to never contact her ever? I mean I know a lot of men whom are 30,36,45 years old whom could never call themselves half the man I was at 16, 18, 19 years old.. 18 and 22 are only 4 years apart, whats the big deal?

20070123123553AAaQL02	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Could this currency be counterfeit?	I recently purchased an "authentic" uncirculated 10K Iraq dinar off ebay. When it arrived, the holographic strip along the side was about halfway peeled off. And when I touched it, it just crumbled away completely. This seems odd, because if it peeled off so easily, how would it be expected to last if the bill were ever circulated?      Also, it appears to be a poor print job because the graphics are not lined up correctly with the paper's edge. For instance, on one side, I can see the edge of the next bill which was printed on the same paper, like it was cut at a slight angle. The whole thing is sort of ****-eyed, actually. It just doesn't look right to me.      Are these particular bills known for their cheap production? Or could this be a counterfeit bill that I have here? Thanks for any info you might have.

20070202022315AAIs0hs	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why are humans so ignorant and egoistic?	Thinking each of their religion is right disregarding and disrespecting the religion and personal beliefs of others and without consideration mocking them, ridicule and insult though it isn't actually rewarding to them, only hurtful to those insulted. Even as a Muslim, I don't go around saying "My religion is the one, true religion in this world, you all will go to Hell." While the rest of the muslims I see are doing this and only spreading hatred, ignorance and prejudice instead of setting examples. This behaviour is comparible with many others in this world, not just Islam. Why can't we all just get along?      A verse from the Quran:      "My religion is my religion, your religion is your religion."

Well I hate to bring the disappointment to those who think that just because they annointed they can do whatever they want: I think I have the right to confront evil preachers. Whether they are a Pastor or Bishop or whatever is completely irrelevant. You don't decieve people for your own personal gain and try to indirectly force poor people out of the congregation!

A gay male (GM) and straight male (SM) are both living in the same house for more than a year.     GM is dicreet, dominant and high achiever and is older by about 5 years. SM is 22, very handsome, and works in one of GM's business associates company, upon GM's recommendation.      Things turn in different way when SM refuses to be affectionate to GM. GM feels sad and asks for more affection like touching while i bed. Both sleep in the same bed. SM gaps himself from GM saying he is taken advantaged off by GM. But GM does not think so. GM is just affectionate and all affections are done privately.     But why SM thinks that GM is taking advantage of him? Why does he refuse to give GM affections?     SM mentioned of a "neutral relationship". What does it mean if applied in this specific case?     GM helps SM sincerely, in fact the GM offers SM a place to stay without any payment, while working overseas. They have sex but it was agreed upon before SM moved in to Gm's condo  year ago.

In another black history month and seeing the same parades and facts about the first black this and that and so called black leaders making sure they get their camera time I cant help but wonder what is the point of it all when black people are in a worst state then ever before.      I understand ho w important it is becaue black history was historically surpressed, but what about the future - it looks bleak.  Yes there was a time when black people at least could count on the lowest paying jobs but with the influx of hispanics and how happy they are to work the bottim jobs for low pay, and even middle level jobs requiring some kind of higher education, along with the rising number of out of wedlock births, drugs, incarcerations, etc....Isn't it a good chance black people might be headed the way of the native americans and other people who became marginalized in their societies?

20070312105425AAe52Yw	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	In the Christian corner:  What are the categories of atheism/theism?	Question: Please provide corrections or comments, if you wish.      (1) They say they know without a doubt there is no god.      (2) They say it is unlikely there is a god      (3) They say at least the Bible god does not exist.      (4) They say it is unlikely there is any god      (5) They say there may be a god, and perhaps they will look.      (6)  They say there is a god, and it is probably the Bible god.      (7) They say there is a god, a Jesus, a heaven and hell.      (8) All that, plus no evolution.      (9) They say your belief in Jesus must be loud and clear.      (10) They are totally consumed by god-Jesus-heaven-hell; and they must proclaim it with great diligence and urgency.      Question: Is this a good gamut, is it a good scale, upon which to plot beliefs?   A god-scale, if you will?      Where does your belief fall on here?  Or should it be more than a 1-to-10 scale?   Do you know anyone that is higher than a 10?

20070324043402AAMPhRZ	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Do you think Dr. Phils show has changed?	I used to love Dr. Phil when the show first came on. His guests were people with everyday problems, and most of the show was spent focusing on solutions for the problem. Recently though, I can not stand to watch it.Every show is spent arguing with the guest about quotes they had made. He spends too much time grilling them about what they did wrong and what they said wrong. He is exploitng his guests and making them look bad on TV. He is no longer focusing on solutions to problems, all he wants is to have that "shock value" by exploiting the problems of his guests, and taking there quotes out of context. On every single show this seasen Dr. Phil reads a quote that the guest flat out denies saying, then they just argue about it. This happens so often that I am starting to believe the guest did not actually say these things, or they are somehow being swayed by the producer to say shocking things. Does anyone else agree with me here? Dr. Phil is no more respectable to me than Maury.

20070430064642AAmvKYZ	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Why do some young people with kids act so darn condescending? :(?	I'm sick and tired of young people(late teens, early 20s) who act like important know-it-alls just b/c they have a kid outside wedlock. It's annoying and they make me feel like I'm naive & inexperienced b/c of it.      I know it can be tough to raise a kid when young, but most of the ones w/ kids that act condescending, are doing well for themselves. For example, they make more $ than me. Or they come from a rich family where they are given lots from their parents, therefore they end up actually working less hard to support their kid, than I do to support myself. At one point, I had problems WORSE than having a kid...I was homeless, in debt, owed $ to practically the world, constantly ill, had 2 loved ones pass away, etc. At that time, I actually had more financial obligations than it'd cost to raise a kid!(I looked up the stats) And I didn't have a kid to love at the end of the day. But oh, it doesn't matter...I haven't actually "lived" til I have a kid; I have no hard life experiences.

It had blood red drapes and wall hangings, and there was a permenant breeze making them sway. I was tied up somehow (my arms I think). The bed was directly in the centre of the room.To my right the wall was not there, instead there was some kind of other world, not evil looking but not heavenly either, just weird trees, colours etc. To my left was a very attractive man, dark hair, dark skin, almost oriental looking in some ways. He wanted to dance, he wasnt saying anything to me but somehow I knew he wanted to dance?   Then when I stood close to him, i looked in his eyes and knew he was satan.      Does anyone know anything about dreams? this one has stuck with me and I remember it so clearly, almost as if it happened. It has not faded over time.

20070815123637AAdOLGk	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Tormenting Job:?	Someone just asked the Christians what reasons God gave for tormenting Job.  Most of the Christians agreed that God allowed Satan to do these things to Job in order to test his devotion to God.  Someone said that “God prepares us here, for the next stage in our lives (death).”  My question is:  What does this mean for Jobs’ family members whom God allowed Satan to kill?  Were they just variables for God’s faith test of Job?   Could it be that the only reason some of us are here on earth is so that God can use us as a variable in his test of someone else’s faith?  How does he decide who is a subject of experimentation and who is merely a variable?  Or, should I just shut up and repeat to myself that God works in mysterious ways until I believe it?

Did anyone else read that? It was really disturbing for me to read.    I really hope they find this person and help them or I hope this is just a twisted joke and nobody gets hurt from it all.

20090205141908AAYjdJX	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Muslims: Question about pregnancy and abortion?	Assalaamualaykum. I know the fetus gets a soul at 4 months gestation from the angels (right?)  making it a human being.  So if it gets aborted prior to 4 months gestation it's not a human being and ceases to exist, neither going to jinnah or jahannam because it didn't live long enough to get a soul.  My question is, if my mother were to get pregnant with her 5th or more child(ren) and aborted them (as she does not want any more kids) before the period of 4 months, would they go to jinnah even though they wouldn't have a soul? If not would God at least let me see them on the Day of Judgment or could I ask God to let them live in Jinnah when they and I had no choice in their deaths? Shukran. Reason I ask this is because the last time my mom went off birth control 6 years ago, she got pregnant with my brother and is now going to go off birth control at 38 years old (she was prescribed birth control by her doctors to regualte her iron count, she's anmeic and planning on going off it as is it makes her "sick") and yes she still gets her monthly period so she could still end up having kids. I'm asking as I'm concerned (yes I know for something that may never happen but only Allah(SWT) knows), and I already have 3 non Muslim siblings, 1 of whose a bad influence on the youngest 2.  What I mean by a bad influence is she drinks (mom and stepfather let her), she wears bad clothing in front of my younger sister and brother, and brings boys(depending on if she's dating) and her little girl friends over to the house and talks about basically inappropriate stuff when she's supposed to be watching my younger siblings. I've tried talking to our mother about this type of behavior but she refuses to listen to me, despite me having my 2 younger siblings best interests at heart.

20060829140221AAxvbNf	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Il bestemmiatore è da considerare un cittadino di serie B e un grandissimo ignorante cafone?	Se è vero che , anche il linguaggio è segno dei tempi e cartina di tornasole del livello di civiltà della società, non si può che rattristarsi dinnanzi all'incontrastata proliferazione della bestemmia .   E' sotto gli occhi di chiunque che non esiste alcun ambiente o ceto immune da questa immonda ed incivile piaga sociale. La bestemmia, ancor prima  di mancare di rispetto ai sentimenti e ai valori religiosi, offende il comune sentire delle più elementari regole di urbanità e convivenza.   Le cause di questo incivile vezzo nazional-popolare, secondo alcuni esperti del comportamento, risalirebbero al fatto che il bestemmiatore si servirebbe semplicemente della bestemmia per inveterata abitudine, disinvolto intercalare, candida parolaccia o innocuo vizio. In breve: un semplice fatto di costume. Diversamente, secondo altre analisi di tipo sociologico, l'uso della bestemmia sarebbe riconducibile ad alcuni fenomeni sociali di massa: emulazione, ispirazione, imitazione, identificazione. Ma anche in questo caso la diagnosi non cambierebbe: la responsabilità non sarebbe mai completamente del bestemmiatore. Mi rifiuto di credere a queste interpretazioni buoniste, giustificazioniste e permissiviste, giustificate talvolta da educatori o da moderni genitori, amiconi dei loro figli.   E’ più verosimile che i bestemmiatori, sia giovani che adulti, siano semplicemente delle persone vuote di valori, di morale, di contenuti, di linguaggio, di cultura, di sostanza, di Dio…naturali frutti di una coscienza assopita sul fondo di un'abissale vacuità. Ma non è meno responsabile, neppure chi farisaicamente si scandalizza ad udire una bestemmia, ma nei fatti non profferisce una singola parola per tacitare o richiamare gli instancabili stacanovisti della bestemmia, nascondendosi o giustificandosi  dietro il paravento del comodo, ma pretestuoso, timore di essere tacciato di moralismo clericale o per la vergogna di non voler apparire illiberale o antidemocratico dinnanzi ad una società che ha fatto della libertà di espressione il suo cavallo di battaglia. Anche la giurisprudenza da un paio di anni , accodandosi supinamente ai nuovi e moderni costumi nazionali, ha depennato dal codice civile e penale il reato di vilipendio alla religione, per cui “grazie” alla totale assenza di ammonizioni civili, religiose o giuridiche gli impenitenti bestemmiatori perseverano nell’opera di infangamento sociale e religioso. Se nella cattolicissima Italia, il secondo Comandamento ( Non nominare il nome di Dio invano) è ancora un obbligo, credo sia giunto il momento in mezzo a tanta vergognosa indifferenza, reagire in prima persona senza esitazioni, soggezioni o complessi di inferiorità, avendo il coraggio di zittire chi umilia la civiltà cristiana.

20090205145040AA5oU8p	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Why is it lots of Hispanic men come across as aloof and confrontational?	I walked by one I worked with and he gave me this ****** look. Like I was a ****** person. There's nothing wrong with me. But it was like this aghast concerned look. WHAT?, I asked. It was rude. I don't have one eye.     Then he said "What's up?"....."What's up?".    Ok, so it was ok for him to unexplanatorily look at me like I was a ****** person, like I was a lepur that dug out of a cave, but if I even remotely call him on it he's asking me to get confrontational?     Then another time, I was waiting in line and another Hispanic male was staring me down like he clearly didn't like me. I never saw the guy in my life. Ever. But he looked like he wanted to take a baseball bat and bash me in the shoulder.     I wasn;'t having it, so I calmly walked up to him and said "Im sorry, do I know you?"     "DO I know U???" he said back mockingly.     "Can I HELP you?" I retorted.     "CAN I HELP UUUUU?" he said back, then a woman came out that I guess he had done business with and he said "Hey, call the police he threaten me. Help, call the police"    I was stunned and speechless.     Im having the cops called on me because im calmly asking him if I could help him (he needn't had done that---if you're going to give someone you don't know a look of death, be prepared to be called on it.     So a guy pulled him away and talked to him and the guy accusing me of "he threaten me" had a weird smile on his face, like his teeth showed, but he had no emotion, like he was faking.    Someone explain why if I did that to someone and they came up to my face and if I said "Help, he threaten me, call the police!" when I hadn't even rose my voice to the guy, I'd be called mental and put in jail for disturbing the piece.    Sorry, why the free pass. NO he didn't deserve to go to jail. He deserved to have been told off and left on his way.....      Lastly, my sister's bf was spit in the face by a Puerto Rican guy shouting PUERTO RICO......    and another one accused me of "Damn why you spying on us, ****" and trying to call my bluff, when the aparment complex her roomie was in in college was in MY apartment, and under MY number and he was smoking pot in MY apartment and I was around smelling it and she called me out on it.    I want to trust Hispanics, but I can't. Lots of you rub me the wrong way.   *****Keep in mind, Ive had a rough childhood socially. So over the years, I've come more protective. I've worked on those issues, those trust issues.    However, none of you best refer to me as a racist. Just because these issues annoy me and frustrate me to no end, they're not troublesome. Troublesome is cancer, family illness/tragedy and being laidoff.    Im not comparing these incidents to that, but I am alikening them to negative reinforcement. I know my heart more than you, and distrust stems in the brain, not the soul.    I swear to God, if any of you politically correct zealots brand me, I will report you.    If you disagree, fine. You're entitled.    Just what am I missing here?       BTW I never said I was the victim in these situations.

I say this is because most asians are smart and come from a strict household. I know american guys don't care but I'm just curious because I've never dated an asian before.

20090205152756AAQv53j	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why did God really "send" his son to die?	ok, so christians believe that God created the universe.      are you telling me that, above every other creation in the universe, God views humans as so important that he came to earth, in the form of Jesus, to die on the cross for our sins.       sins that, according to the bible, we know we aren't supposed to commit, and commiting them incurs the wrath of God, sending us to hell.        Why would God kill himself to cancel out all of the sins that have and will ever be commited?   (and don't say love, because that's bullshit, jesus didn't want to die on the cross for your sin, jesus even prayed for god to give him a way out...)   besides the sins still exist, every action we ever commit, according to christianity, is recorded in the great book in heaven...or whatever.      and while i'm at it, what's stopping a sinner from living an absolutely evil life, and on his deathbed asking forgiveness and "accepting jesus into his heart."  a man with no real remorse for what he did, except in his last few fearful moments on earth, gets just as much of a free pass as a lifelong saint?      this doesn't make any sense to me....

Okay, my brother wanted me to come to this outdoor event where he'll be competing.  He said that he will have a game from about 12pm-1pm and then about 8pm-9pm.  And he said we can grill between those times.        Later on I thought, hey, I think it'd be cool to have some other friends come out to just hang out with us.  He has never met them, they're nice people though.  And I told him about them and how they're good people, and asked if he minds them coming.      He said "Doesn't matter to me.  I'll be pretty busy anyways and won't be able to hang out with them."      So now I'm thinking, huh?  Seems like a contradiction.  I'm sure it's just that he doesn't want them to be there.        How can I respond and still let him save face?

20090205115936AAN4XzP	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Will someone please clarify this for me....?	It's about death and the grave, so I apologise in advance for it being depressing kinda...      So I know that when we die, we stay in our graves until The Judgment Day, and we either get good or bad treatment in the grave while we wait. We answer for our deeds, to Allah(swt), on Judgment Day right? So how is the treatment we get in the grave determined? (by the Angels?)      Say for example, someone committed a major sin, but they truly repented, and hopefully Allah(swt) will forgive them...but if we don't answer to Allah(swt) until The Judgment Day, does this then mean that the person will get bad treatment in the grave for that sin they committed, or will it already be forgiven (since he/she repented).      (I know all that was confusing, I hope it makes sense, if you don't get it, tell me, I will try and clear it up)      Just curious.   Thanx in advance =)

20090205153231AA8HIg7	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Atheist, and religous folks  Why is it so hard for you to understand an agnostics belief about god?	Everyone likes to be understood  this site is suppose to be for understanding correct?  First you need to understand why we all have beliefs.  The reason being there is something about that belief which makes sense to you, so you believe it.  There is always some kind of kick back, or payback, or payout, that goes along with that belief        Most atheist believe there is no god.  Let me ask you atheist (What sense is there in believing there is no god)?  What is your payout, kick back or pay back, for believing this?             For me it makes no sense to believe there is no god.  That is why i don't choose That choice.  Religious seem to be happy and lead enriching lives.  I already am a good person and Iam a very happy person. It makes no sense to me for believing what religious folks believe, because of These reasons.  There are so many different religions and they believe differently,  Most seem to think their religion is the (One true religion)  Many religious folks will condemn other religions to hell because of their beliefs.  There are so many different interpretations of the bible.       Since we weren't there when the bible was written we have our language scholars try and  figure out what the words back then meant.  It doesn;t make sense to me that they are going to get all the meanings of words correctly.  If this is so then the many interpretations of the bible may be incorrect.  Many folks of the same religion will have many different interpretations of the bible.  And maybe the biggest reason of all which makes not sense to me is,   Religious folks because of their belief about god. Makes it nearly impossible for them to have an open mind about anything which has the words god or bible in the discussion, unless the discussion is about strengthening their beleifs.  This observation is from experience.       So if it doesn'n make sense to me to believe there is no god,  and it certainly makes no sense to me that with all the chaos surrounding religion and the beliveing in god and the bible  to make that choice.  Well what choice does that leave me?  It makes perfect sense to me to believe there may or may not be a god.  If they sounds wishy washy,  fence sitting,  weak mindedness,  or illogical to you. Then i suggest you  take the time to look more into why we choose the beliefs we choose

20090205152951AAoXziP	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Does God look human? Did God make us in his actual image?	Romans 1:21-25   "21For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened. 22Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools 23and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like 'mortal man' and birds and animals and reptiles. 24Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another. 25They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator—who is forever praised. Amen."      Doesn't that passage state that God does not look like mortal man? Yes, it says that God made us in his image but are we reading that wrong? Maybe it means that God made us in his "likeness"      Catechism of the Catholic Church NO. 370:   "In no way is God in man's image. He is neither man nor woman. God is pure spirit in which there is no place for the difference between the sexes. But the respective "perfections" of man and woman reflect something of the infinite perfection of God: those of a mother and those of a father and husband."      Maybe when it says God made us in his image it meant made us in the "mental image" he had for us. In hebrew the root word used which was translated into image was Tz L M, which is the root for the words in english such as image, snapshot, photography, shade, or shadow. In this sense it may mean that we were made in Gods shadow? Is that more realistic if God says that worshiping images made to look like mortal man is incorrect?

20060921105830AAqfJXs	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	We can't all get along but Can we all be respectful?	This forum is an ideal place to bounce ideas and questions off one another, but it seems like it's rarely used that way. As a Christian, I understand that there are some things that I've experienced in my life that many have not. What I don't understand is when did it become okay to imply that the experiences I've had only occured because I am less of a human being than the rest? Just because you may not have experienced the same things does not make any less intelligent, educated, or trustworthy.      I extend to you that your lack of religion or belief does not make you less intelligent, educated, or trustworthy. You simply haven't experienced what I have.       We may never see eye to eye, but do we need to be hurtful to one another in our questions and comments?      Please don't tell me that some Christian once said this or that. I'm talkingn about two wrongs not making a right here. You can't judge us all on the actions of a few. What do you think? Can we be respectful?

I tasted a delicious, rich, creamy , handed down recipe. The owner will not share his family's recipe. I cannot find such a similar recipe. He claims some of the ingredients are slowly cooked in a saucepan on top of the stove.  Then it is taken off and some more are added,stirred in. Then you pour it all into a unbaked pie crust. Then bake it in the oven.    The recipe has 3 eggs, brown sugar I know for sure. The pumpkin pie recipes I have come across that you cook some ingredients in a saucepan, then pour into a BAKED crust, then cool and refrigerate. I have not come across one where you cook some ingredients, then add the milk I believe, then pour into a crust then bake. I hope someone can help me.  This pie is very rich and the best I have tasted.  I want to fix this recipe and give this person a piece of pie and show him up!

Today, the only people who could make it to rehearsal were me and two of the women. At one point, they messed up on a particular phrase and said: "Whoops, sorry, I'm retarded!" And, as if that weren't enough, they made their hands clawlike, used the universal denasal cerebal palsy voice, and started stomping and limping around the room. I didn't want to start a confrontation as the accompanist was there (who said nothing!) but, I use a wheelchair, and although I am not retarded myself, I empathize with the mentally handicapped as we both have to go through similar things. How  do I politely tell them that that kind of humour offends me if they do it again?       P.S: I should also mention that this immature behavior came from 2 20 YEAR OLDS!!

The mom-to-be can not have certain foods because she has Celiac's disease.

How do I state, in the invitation, for guests to not bring food or drinks?  We don't want things at mom's party that mom can't have (not very fair to her).

My roommate recently got let go from her job and is now looking for a new one. She's not getting really lucky, but she also hasn't been trying super hard, either. Anyway, she saw some open positions on my company's website is now asking me to look into it.       This is terrible but I really, really don't want to work with her! She is a little annoying and while I love her as a friend, and can deal with her as a roommate, I don't think I could add co-worker to the list. My time at the office is time by myself and not at home.      I am tempted to not look into it for her and tell her I did... but is that the meanest thing ever?! I can't say I don't want to work with her either.. because she is really struggling for a job

20090205124501AAeLUw7	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Is it condescending to say "good girl" to a young adult?	Honestly, wouldn't that be more appropriate for a dog or a little girl under 12? Most people would prefer to be treated with dignity and respect. The most disturbing part is when a teenage girl is productive on her job and her boss says it to her. The most patronizing is when a young woman simply did a chore and a parent or friend's parent says it to her. Or given a good grade on homework/test, a teacher says it to a high school junior. Would you give a damn if someone said that to you?

It's not that she's not NICE, she is, but she's like a genius or something. She has like 7 instruments and she's always writing some music for something. She's writing a book too. She always uses big words and I feel stupid talking to her, but then I feel bad when I get angry because you can tell that she's not doing it for that purpose; she just really doesn't know how to relate to people. What do I do? She's really nice, but it's so awkward being around her because we have nothing in common and nothing to talk about.

We go out to dinner or drinks with a couple about 2-3 times per month and they have expensive taste. They always want to go to expensive restaurants (which my boyfriend and I cannot afford) and they always order a bottle of wine and pressure us to share the wine. On several occasions they have split the bill by 4 even though my boyfriend and I clearly got less. For example, they had dinner and alcohol and we only had drinks. I'm think from now on to ask for separate checks so we aren't stuck with paying for their meals/drinks! Is it rude?

The other day, he added me on facebook, and on my wall, he wrote," Hey, I'm looking for a Valentine. Would anyone like to be my Valentine? =) 10 more days to go!"    I assume, he is asking me on a date on Valentine's day.      The thing is...I don't know him, and I'm not attracted to him...I do want to get to know him better.    By the way, I went on a date once.  I guess, I don't want to get into any relationship right now. However, I tell myself that I should go, just for the sake of experiencing the dating world.     I'm thinking of just going out as friends, nothing else.    Well, some of my friends are hanging out at hollywood on Valentine's day, so I guess, he and I can go together with my friends, does that sound good?   My questions:      1. Should he and I go on our date with my friends?      2.What do you think this message mean, "Hey, I'm looking for a Valentine. Would anyone like to be my Valentine? =) 10 more days to go!"?
