It's somewhat hard to breathe and I have some pain in my stomach and around my diaphragm/lung area.  I feel like I need to throw up and my whole back aches and hurts.  I also feel really dizzy.  I've had headaches but took something for it and it kind of went away.  I know I should go to the doctor, but I can't because I have a lab I can't miss tonight.  So I was wondering if anyone had any idea what was wrong.  Thank you!

Do u think it would be appropriate to ask him to do a heart test that would sample crap out to check for infection? Is he capable of ordering this because out of two other doctors I have seen, he's the only one that was respectful and really took the time to listen to my concerns.

I have noticed that vasaline does a pretty good job if I saturate my feet in it daily, but it is uncomfortable because I always have to have socks on or I will get it on the floor.  I also like to wear sandles and I cannot wear sandles with my feet full of vasaline.  I also have something hard, about the size of a small marble, under my pinky toe.  I think it might be a bunion but when I went and bought that thing you stick on it to draw it up (something I got from the drugist) it did not work.

20090205132227AA2Ewr7	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Heart Diseases	After I passed out in school yesturday I had an EKG done, what could this mean?	OK so I passed out in school yesturday and I don't remember anything from the time I felt like I was about to get sick, to when I woke up on the floor when the nurse was there. She said my blood pressure was too low to be taken, and that my pulse was 45. My dad took me to the doctor and the doctor said it was probably just a sugar drop in my blood levels. I was not allowed back at school so I just went home and slept. Later that afternoon, the school nurse had contacted my pediatrician and told her how bad my levels were. Then the doctor called my parents and suggested I have an EKG done. I did go into the hospital yesturday and had it done, with results to be expected tomorrow.      Over the past few years I have randomly occasionally (once or twice a year maybe) felt pains in my chest near my heart. I always thought it was from just eating greasy food or something.       What could all this be? I am only 15, what could be wrong? I am really scared.      Thank you!

20090205140453AAf2wpq	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Heart Diseases	Can you develop  alcoholic cardiomyopathy within drinking for about a year?	I recently stopped drinking cold turkey, but did have a problem for this past year. My dad died and I was going through a very difficult time and took comfort in alcohol. I drank about every night or every other night. Sometimes heavily. Sometimes just a glass of wine. Thank God I have seen how bad it has become. I have recently been having chest pains accompanied with panic attacks. I went to the doctor and he diagnosed me with panic issues. I guess due to the fact I've been reading up more about heart issues, I'm concerned this could be a symptom of the drinking.  Is it possible to develop such a condition in a year? By the way I am 22.

I've had this mild dull achy pain on and off for a few weeks now that started in my lower chest/upper abdomen where the ribcage ends and I thought it was just a muscle pull for a while.  It did seem to feel better when I would lie down but right now it's pretty persistent no matter what position I'm in.  It also feels a slightly more inflamed in that area.  I know I may seem paranoid but I was worried that it may be an aortic aneurysm.  But I hope it is just a muscle pull that I keep re-aggravating or something not serious or life threatening.  Any input would be appreciated.

My appetitie has dropped dramatically, I'll eat about 1 meal a day and be full, when I used to eat about 3 times a day. The thought of me being very full makes me sick to my stomach, so I don't really eat until I am full. I also use to suffer with low self esteem as a child and during HS. I was always, always made fun of and sometimes it doesnt go away. I thought I could boost my self esteem by  being involved with "popular/cute" guys, but that only made it worse, and made me felt used.

Sometimes I feel like I'm not pretty enough for a guy to ever want to be in a relationship with me.I don't know what is going on with me...any suggestions...advice.

I took seroquel 400mg nightly for approxmatly 5 months, from June 27th to mid november. I would always gain weight like crazy, no matter what i eat. Even after a month of being off i would gain like crazy and no matter how much i exercised i wouldnt lose anything and if i did it would pile back on.       Its now been 3 months, and i dont gain weight when i eat! i even ate a HUGE ammount of food one day and didnt gain anything, and just from exercising today my weight went down some.      i know its water weight probably, but i never used to be able to lose ANYTHING on seroquel.

20090205152352AAdfd7H	Health;Women's Health	Your opinion on this creepy teacher situation?	**please read this. i know its long but its really important**      Okay, so im a freshman in high school, and at the beginning of the year, i got a bit of a creepy vibe from one of my teachers. Normally, my first impressions of people are always right. I grew to like him more throught the first quarter, but after that he started to get creepy again. He would get erections in class, and since there were only 3 girls in the class (and 2 boys) we would joke "ooh it one of us!!"   we were kidding, but i started to worry it was me.       I told him his class was too hard for me and i needed to drop down a level. He tried to blackmail me into staying in his class. he said things like    "if i get a call you're dropping my class, i will make a call to guidence, and your mother, and tell them both about how you disrespect me and misbehave in my class"   I DID talk a lot, but that was just the attitude of the entire class. We all talked a lot, most of it was started by him.    He called my mom, and when i talked to her she said he was saying a little too many bad things about me....like he was trying to get her to say "well can she stay after school?"   i finally left his class, and my friends said he kept talking about me. He looked up where i live, and was bragging about it in class. although all teachers have acess to that stuff, i thought it was creepy he had done it after i left his class.       The most disturbing thing was that my friends said he stopped getting erections after i left class. He would get them a lot, and they said he just stopped when i left.       he always seems to be in the lunch line when i am, (which is odd, considering the teachers have their own lunch line) and he recently kicked me out of the computer lab for no reason. he even took the time to escort me out, when normally teachers just say "leave"   he made sure i was right behind him the whole time.          I've told my mom, but im worried if i tell the school the media could get involved, and i really cant have that happen considering im involved in some other legal family issues at the moment.       what do i do???

20090205144238AAgqb2g	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	Do I have a low pain tolerance? and are there methods of increasing your pain tolerance?	The reason i ask is because I play as a soccer goalie for my school's girls team and in a match 2 weeks ago i bumped together with another girl and injured my ankle.   I remember the pain being excruciating and I couldn't help but to completely bust out crying in front of everyone. To me and to the others watching it seemed sure that i had severely broken my ankle only to find out later in hospital that it had only been a sprain. Of course i was relieved but it really made me think once again about my ability to tolerate pain! Kinda the same happened to me like half a year ago when i broke 2 fingers (again as a goalie) and again broke out into tears.   Why do I seem to tolerate less pain than other people? And are there any methods to increase pain tolerance?

The Tylenol 3 is alright, makes me more dizzy than the hydro. does but Darvocet doesn't seem to work to well.

20090205150912AARwWmT	Health;Dental	Legal/Orthodontic Question!?	I have had braces for over three years now, and all that really remains is to take care of an impacted canine. I have had two oral surgeries to address this. The second chained it to bring it down, but it came off. (Which I know happens sometimes). But when we went back to my oral surgeon, he measured my mouth and said that there had never been enough room to bring the tooth down in the first place. The only reason I had the surgery was because I was told by my orthodontist that the room had been made, but the tooth just wouldn't come down. So I had two treatments all for nothing due to the negligence of my orthodontist, who had left the assistants to take care or me and was not monitoring my case closely enough. Also, there was no informed consent of the risks involved if my tooth would not come down. (bone grafting, implants, etc.) I would never had agreed to this method of treatment had I known. I believe I have a case on grounds of lack of informed consent and professional negligence. Do you?

So I ignored my top two wisdom teeth that grew out (theyre still kind of not fully out but they're not impacting my gums or anything.. i don't think) but now my bottom left one is half way out and was ripping my gum. I brushed my teeth today and saw blood in my toothpaste so I figured I must of fully ripped my gum (did the job for my wisdom tooth) and when I felt that area with my tongue there was flappy skin so I knew I ripped something. Is it bad the longer you wait to get your wisdom teeth pulled? Why isn't it easier since its already half way out the oral surgeon might not have to break the bone or dig to find it under your gum? I know that leaving it longer could effect my other teeth but I'm talking about the surgery procedure etc. I will see a dentist ASAP, I am really busy with school right now and I have to find a new dentist.       http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=h...       instead of . com i put DOTcom in that link, copy and paste then replace DOT with..well..."."

I have a mamogram scheduled in two weeks.  I have to say that I am scared. I know as a woman the body goes through changes. For me it's been on my right breast. I have gone to two GYN doctors who say they haven't felt any lumps or concerns. What I feel is a tightning above my breast which is called the Peri...??. muscle. Sometimes it itches and sometimes not. I have begun to have upper back pain sometimes on the right side too, but not all the time. I had a massage therapist give me a massage last week and she said I am very tense on the muscles. I had a wedding to organize, a father who died of prostate cancer and some family difficulties, all within a year. I have concerns about cancer or can it be stress? My right side of my body has begun to give some difficulties, my right hip has begun to be a little achy too. Is it all in my head?  Just some suggestions from those who can relate or understand.

From around 8 to when I fell asleep, I was the happiest I think I've ever been. After that day though it all went downhill. I think I got worse than before. After 3 pills I had to stop because the side effects were horrible. I know it takes about two weeks to work, but if I had waited that long would that great happiness have been a constant feeling?       This was about a month ago, and I told someone it was 20 mg Paxil daily and they told me that's a very large dosage used mainly for severe depression and psychosis, neither of which I have.

20090205095711AAvq2VA	Health;Optical	Eyes: Flashes of Light and TONS of Floaters?	Ever since I started Paxil 20mg, I have had a ton of floaters with flashes of light in the corner of my vision that always catch my attention. NOW that I have been off Paxil for almost 5-6 months, I still have the floaters and flashes of light.    The floaters take up my entire field of vision, and sometimes in certain light I can see them all. They look like very tiny bugs swimming in my eyes all over my entire field of vision. This is 24/7! I also get these big ones that move slowly when I move my eyes right or left in the center of my vision.    I've had this for almost a year now and its driving me crazy. I doubt it could be a detached retina since I've had it for so long. I go to the walk-in clinic and the doctor says I'm fine, but it frustrates me to Hell because I KNOW this isn't normal.     What could this be? What could I do to fix this? It gets worse when I'm tired, and when I'm preoccupied I barely notice it. I was on Paxil for anxiety, do you think these symptoms could be somatogenic? Could it be neurological? Could it be an optical problem?    I hope someone knows.. as my doctor is useless as he pawns everything off as, "oh its nothing." (One of the downfalls of free healthcare in Canada as some doctors seem to not give a crap.)

The trouble is she is very aggressive and the family are not sure that she will settle.She visited the home last week ,they just said it was a day outing -she enjoyed her day but said when asked that she wouldn't like to go back.   Problem is-should they move her and all her familiar things in at the same time.   If you move her TV,table, pictures,vases etc she will know it is for good.   If however she goes in ,and you just say it is for a day or so,and keep repeating this for a few weeks she may well forget that she is not at home.   Any help would be appreciated   The Social Services did an evaluation of situation 10 days ago -in her home with her present.Her children were there and SS spoke openly about her being admitted into care,as they said she could no longer be cared for in her own home.   MIL went ballistic-and begged my husband not to put her into a home.!   However,no one can cope with her anymore as she is double incontinent and her children have their own lives to lead   This has been going on for over 2 years and her children are mentally and physically  exhausted.

20090205124229AAwsHjf	Health;Mental Health	I am very depressed now that I know that I messed up so badly...?	Well I have been suffering from extreme anxiety and depression the last two years (after a friend's suicide). I went from being the kid who had all the friends, was as skinny as a twig, would have straight A's, etc. to a kid who failed half of his classes last year and same this year, has almost no friends, and is now almost 150 pounds at just 5'5". It has affected my attendance so badly and it's awful. Everyone keeps telling me it's not my fault, but I just feel like it is. I feel like I have ruined THEIR lives as well. Especially my parents. They are very supportive of me and I know the last two years for them have been Hell and it's all my fault. Last year, my therapist and I figured out a plan to graduate with my class (I'm a Sophomore in HS). It went fine, but once again, I messed up this year. Nothing has improved. I'm suicidal and I hate myself. Now my therapist is telling me that it is basically impossible to graduate with my class. That is making me feel horrible. I am a very self-conscious person so now that I am going to be forced to stay another year and lose ALL my friends and all respect from anybody I have ever met, I want to die basically. I'm on medication, and yes, it works. But nothing cures my problems completely. It's almost as if my body works its way around the medication and figures out a new way to ruin my life (I now have mild ADD and OCD too). I just don't know what to do... Advice...?

20090205120706AArlVRO	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Cancer	Breast Lump & Lymph nodes?	I am undergoing treatment for breast cancer.  In the last few days of January 2008 I noticed a lump in my breast - I called immediately to set up a mammogram.  Mammogram was on February 1st, as I was leaving the mammography unit I called my OB and told them that I had found a lump and would need to come see them.  I saw the Dr on February 6th.  He felt the lump and stated it was about 4 cm and referred to it as the size of a golf ball.  Said he would wait for mammogram result to decide if he was going to do anything but said most likely fibrocystic change and nothing to worry about.  So I trusted him.  At the end of June I noticed the lump felt larger and decided to set appointment to have it removed in conjunction with elective plastic surgery (breast lift).  Figured best to have a surgeon who may be more careful about removal since it is a breast.   The plastic surgeon appointment was set for right after I got back from vacation on (August 7th or 8th).     The plastic surgeon said he could not remove the lump but could work with a general surgeon so remove it so that the cuts can be made by him to lessen the scaring and proceed with the breast lift.   Fast forward to August 12th.  I am getting ready for work and as I put on deodorant I feel pain under my arm - decide this can't be good and I call the OB office and tell them this, they say they will get with dr as soon as out of an exam room and give me a referral.  2 hours goes by with no contact from them so I go see my Primary care Dr who was willing to get me in right away and they immediately refer tme to a breast surgeon.  Unfortunately the surgeon is on way out fo town and wil not have an appointment until August 29th.  I call the ob back and again explain the issue - the fact that someone was supposed to call me back earlier and request a referral (this isn't a stubbed toe) I am again told they will get  with the dr when he gets out of the exam room. They did not call me back until 5:10 that afternoon.   I had called a friend of mine who has an ob as a friend and she told her OB what was going on and her ob said to give me 3 names of surgeons and if I am not able to book an appointment very quickly to call her back directly and she will call from her back office.     The next morning armed with the names I make calls and no one on the list has anything anytime soon.  When I am on the phone with the last referred physicians office I ask if NY of their Drs has anything sooner and am lucky to find out that one does on the morning of the 15th.  I go in and he immediately does a biopsy and schedules additional imaging tests.  I find out a week later I have Triple Negative Breast Cancer.     Many people say the dr should have done a biopsy or additional imagine tests in February as this was much too large a mass to ignore and that it's advancement into my lymph nodes probably happened in the last couple months.  Does this seem likely or could it have been in my lymph nodes for 6 months without me knowing anything about it.

20090205123757AAhdqDj	Health;General Health Care;Other - General Health Care	I lost my sense of taste...any help?	I was sick the past few days and I still have some congestion in my throat and nose. I was also having ear issues where my ear feels clogged. A few days ago, I noticed that I can't taste anything. I used to think that it was because of my nose being stuffy, but I used nose spray or whatever to open up my nostrils and there aren't very clogged. Does it have something to do with my ear? Is there any way I can get my taste back within the next few hours? How can I get my taste back?

I have been noticing this for quite some time now, but when I urinate and I push hard to drain my bladder, I get a milky white substance that comes out of my penis.  It looks like semen but I cannot understand why semen would be coming out.  This is happening quite frequently when I push to basically get the last drop in my bladder any time I urinate.  Any suggestions?

She told me that it wasn't cold in the house and my mother also said it. So later that night when my friend and my friend's mother left, I was feeling terrible. It was about 1am and every time I tried to turn my body, when I lift my head up the outside of my throat was hurting. So every time I move my head, it hurts my neck. Now, whenever I try to eat or drink, it hurts when I swallow. I still have my tonsels but I don't know if it is strep throat. Can somebody please help me?

I know this question has been asked before but I was wondering if anyone has used Trilastin during their pregnancy and if it worked for them...especially on their tummy.Also I"m 37 weeks pregnant today and don't have stretch marks yet..when will I know that I'm safe and won't get them at all?       Also if you got them after giving birth,how many weeks after did you get them?Did you have have to keep putting lotion especially on the breasts since they will get bigger after giving birth?      Really appreciate your input and thanks so much
