Do you first get a 4 year bachelors in "general biology" and then pick a specialization field to earn a graduates degree in? And is a graduates degree necessary to earn a higher pay (like 60k plus?)      Also, what kind of biology jobs are available that do NOT involve teaching, pharmaceutical drug/chemical testing, or the use of lab animals?       I am trying to decide what field would be best for me. I love animals (against animal testings so I'm unsure if laboratory jobs involve this) and I am big on nutrition and natural medicine. I enjoy anything that has to do with biology so if I could get a job in biology that involves nutrition or naturopathy that'd be great.      Any advice is Greatly appreciated, thank you.

I get shocked way more than anyone I've ever known, it's like I'm a metal rod. As soon as winter hits, I start getting shocked constantly. I can't even get up from my chair at work without getting shocked by my desk or computer. You know how when you get shocked it's a weird kind of hurt that isn't really painful, it's just strange? Well I get those but I also get horribly painful shocks that will make me scream, and sometimes they really scare me. I had to stop wearing my head phones at the office because I was actually getting an electric shock from the computer through my EARS. It was a horrible popping sound and my ears felt like they were going to bleed. (They didn't.)    Just so you know, I always wear shoes with rubber bottoms, I don't drag my feet when I walk, and I don't wear wool.    So... does anyone know what I can do to stop this?

20090225113353AAb33QB	Science & Mathematics;Biology	Is there a way to test to see if a man only produces one type of sperm (like only girl or boy)?	I have read that the man is the one who determines the gender of the baby. Well, in my husbands family, only boys are born. He came from a family of just boys, his older brother only had boys, we only have boys, etc. However, my husband's father had 4 half-sisters (same father). So, it would appear that both genders are in the family lineage, if my husband's grandfather fathered girls as well as boys.       Then, my father-in-law says he had some type of football injury in high school to his testicle(s) - would that affect the lineage AFTER that point? (like only being able to have boys)?      But, I guess back to my actual question - is there a medical/scientific way to test sperm to see if it only contains "boy sperm" or what the ratio of boy-to-girl sperm is for a particular person?

This might seem a little lengthy ..Please bear with it and help a lost soul out ....      A concave mirror forms an inverted image four times larger than the object. Find the focal length of the mirror, assuming the distance between the object and image is 0.6m      Solution:       Magnification = -q/p      -4 = -q/p      4p=q ------- [1]      Lens equation 1/p + 1/q = 1/f      q-p = 0.6m =====>> Why is this so ???        Is it because earlier in [1], it is shown that q is greater than p by 4 ??      Another case taking the example of a convex mirror...      A convex mirror forms a virtual image half the size of the object. Assuming the distance between image and object is 0.2m, determine the radius of the curvature of the mirror....      Once again M = -q/p                      1/2 = -q/p                   -2q = p                    In this case, the image is expected to be formed on the back side of the convex mirror. Giving q a negative value. Thus in this case, why is the distance between image and object is given by                           p-q = 0.2m instead of p+q =0.2m      I am confused with all the sign conventions ......please somebody explain...

20090225130630AAQaHR7	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Calculus made easy. Figure 4 help?	I'll give you the back story as to why I even care after my question.      Here is my question, I'm reading Calculus Made Easy by Silvanus P. Thompson    (which can be found here:  http://djm.cc/library/Calculus_Made_Easy...        I'm having trouble with figure 4 (pages 10 & 11). I understand that the triangles both the original and the "small" one have the same 30 degree angle on one side. I understand that y/x is equal to dy/dx what I do not understand is why then that dy/dx=1/173? (and for all I know it may be 1/1*73 because I'm not sure if the dot in the page is the result of a 1940's printer or because he meant to imply multiplication, and if that is the case why not just say 1/73?).      I'm guessing the reason I'm not getting it is one of two things, 1. My algebra skills are very, very rusty or 2. I've missed something completely or knowing that it would equal 173 is impossible with the information given. I'm leaning toward #1 sadly.       I'm trying to learn calculus on my own, I'm sitting at work with a junior college education and from my current surroundings it shows. ha. I'm considering going back to school and learning this is kind of the basis of what I would want to go back for, well this and physics. And this is a huge jump for me I was a "dumb jock" in high school and I never took a math class higher than Algebra 2. So I may be asking a million more dumb questions about this book. I understand the value of a good education now, now all I have to do is convince myself I'm capable and then we'll see how far I go.       But for now any help understanding figure 4? Why dy/dx= 1/173?

20090128114813AADaMWC	Science & Mathematics;Astronomy & Space	For all of those people who believe in evolution and the big bang theory, tell me this.?	Cells. We know where they come from, they divide from other cells.   Right? But if the cells we have today divided from other cells, and so on to the beginning, where did the first cells come from? They couldn't have appeared out of nowhere.      And genealogy. evolution says the earth is billions of years old. If you do the math, even with the earths population in the billions, a COUPLE HUNDRED years ago, technology wasn't even close to being advanced. We were just getting started. medicine, health and all.   Wasn't that good. the worlds population was only in the millions. do the math of birthrate, death rate, family tree and all of that, and tell me   if we were here billions of years ago. Oh wait, that's right. We came from the sea. whatever.           adaption can be seen, within a couple generations. Yes, it can be really fast. but this doesn't mean we jumped from species to species.   If we evolved from monkeys, and the weaker, recessive things are supposed to die off, why the h~ll are there still monkeys?    And if we mutated from other species, and those from others, and so on, try this. the ratio of positive mutations to negative mutations is unbelievably low vs. an extremely high side. what are the chances of us evolving from blobs, fish, monkeys, and everything else into what we are today? and millions of other species evolving into more dominant things. I'm talking about the positive-negative ratio.    According to science, not just us, but EVERYTHING in the world that lives today came from one creature. put this ratio and your math to work, and see if its possible for millions of creatures, or even billions, to have received all these positive mutations and to have become so unique, starting from one creature that was smaller then the tip of a pin. I didn't think so.      Don't forget the big bang. Yes, I believe somewhere in the universe, stars explode and everything else. But someone show me a site of the odds of earth forming with just the right materials to support life, and earth getting within just the right distance from the sun as of not to be scorched or frozen. Don't forget the conditions for everything to   come out of nowhere and make life, sustain it, and interact with everything else for a balance.      Think that's to much? The big bang wasn't only about the universe crunching into a giant mass, and exploding. When you think about it,    either the universe exploded and formed the specific conditions to support life, and sustain it, this segment is only a little piece of it.      this is my question. what evidence do you have to go against this?

20090128095917AAxdKxe	Science & Mathematics;Physics	The index of refraction for radio waves traveling through ice is 1.30. ?	The index of refraction for radio waves traveling through ice is 1.30. If radio waves enter a sheet of ice in Antarctica that is 2000 meters thick, how long will it take the radio waves to travel to the bottom of the ice and back again?      I know that the speed of light in air is close to 3.00 x 10^8 m/s and that I somehow have to take into account the 2000 meter thick ice, but I end up with frequency even though I know 2000 meters is not the wavelength. I found that 2.31 x 10^8 m/s is the speed of light through ice.

If the density if the center of the sun is 1.40g/cm^3 at a pressure of 1.30*10^9 atm, calculate the temperature in degrees Celsius.      Okay so, in class I learned about the ideal gas law:PV=nRT.   Then from here I have to form an equation involving density which is:       MM(molar mass)=(d(density)R(ideal gas law constant)T(temperature))/(P(pressure))      (P.S: R= (L*atm)/(mol*k))*    OKay so when I plug in all the values i can't cancel out the the litersw and cm^3. So what should I do because I'm only supposed to end up with Kelvin (K).   PLease help!!!!      Thank you!
