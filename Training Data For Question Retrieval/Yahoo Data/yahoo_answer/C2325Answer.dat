4ab2ea36c0069d71d94055356c32ea00aa	What makes your question a little hard to answer is that there are Montessori schools in the public schools in many areas, so it's hard to really know where to begin.  Those are different from most Montessori schools in some ways because they've had to make adaptations a little in the curriculum design and they have to worry about testing.  So, if I may, let me rephrase the question to ask what most people want to know and hope that it helps.  "How is Montessori different from other forms of education?"<br>  <br>  As far as your question on whether or not they are challenged more, the answer is "kind of yes and kind of no."  It depends on what you mean by "challenged."  The way Montessori schools perceive challenging students has to do with a much more internal method.  We don't perceive challenging students in terms of them trying to keep up with the rest of the class and with the teacher's pace.  We see challenging the student as taking what they already know and adding more skills to it.<br>  <br>  This brings up both the pro and the con of the Montessori method.  The positive:  We are able to meet the students were they are and move them forward.  I have a class of 3-6 year olds right now.  There are 14 children in the class (which is small...I wish there were a few more).  I have one three year old who is working on 1-9 and another three year old who is into building 4 digit numbers with the beads.  It is Ok for them to be at different stages.  My goal is to continue to interest them in work that meets their needs so they will continue to choose that work and get them to move forward.  In the end, they tend to have a stronger base of educational outcomes if we look purely at a standardized list of things they end up learning because they're always met where they are and taught to move forward a little more each time.<br>  <br>  The problem arises mostly in that parents often do not have the same educational goals as a Montessori classroom.  Rather than moving education forward, some parents do believe that it is more important to have the students learn to learn the basics and be prepared for standardized testing.  That's not said to be a shot at those parents...there is some truth in importance of those things.  There are also parents that want actual evidence of learning, which often isn't reflected in the Montessori curriculum.  Montessori students learn something then move on to the next thing -- they don't learn something then spend days or weeks practicing it in worksheets.  They practice it through applying it in newer concepts so it becomes more meaningful.<br>  <br>  In my blog, there are 2 that really apply to what you said.  Visit<br>  <a href="http://www.myspace.com/montessoriblog" rel="nofollow">http://www.myspace.com/montessoriblog</a>   <br>  <br>  Click on the link to view all the blog entries.  Scroll down until you come to Thursday, September 18, 2008  "How do Children Learn?"  That blog and the one after it, "Where are the results?" give you a good idea of how Montessori works - from both a practical side (what happens in the classroom) and the theory behind it (why it happens that way).<br>  <br>  Hope that has helped some!<br>  Matt|`|AA11770802	Everything Matt says is correct. I'm going to add to it and give you a little different perspective.<br>  <br>  I am a Montessori Teacher in a public school. Our program is very small, at the moment we have 40 children k -3.  The rest of our school is "traditional".  I go to staff meetings and grade level meetings with the other teachers so I know very well what my students do compared to the traditional students.<br>  <br>  Let's get to your question, "Are public school children more challenged?"  I'm assuming you are asking, do public school students do harder work?  To that I must answer, "No." my Montessori students have to take the same benchmarks and standardized tests as the traditional students.  But, unlike the traditional students, when they have mastered a concept they get to go on, they don't just sit there and wait for the district pacing calendar to tell the teacher that it is time to move on to the next concept.  They also don't get busy work to keep them quiet, which is what happens to bright students in the traditional classes.. Additionally, my students learn science, social studies, history, and geography, things that the children in the other classrooms aren't learning because it is not on the test at the end of the year and the only thing they are learning in the traditional classrooms is the information that is going to be on the test. spending time on anything else is considered "a waste of valuable education time".<br>  <br>  Now to be honest, I do have  children who are "below" grade level.  These children I have working at their "cutting edge" of development.  They are challenged, but not overwhelmed. Something that often happens to children not at grade level in more traditional settings. More so, since they are working at their "cutting edge", they are more apt to learn and more apt to increase their learning curve.<br>  <br>  Of course all the information I am giving you is anecdotal.  If you are looking for scientifically based research on Montessori you can find links to a plethora of studies here  <a href="http://www.montessorianswers.com/scientifically-based-research.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.montessorianswers.com/scienti...</a><br>  <br>  But the most comprehensive longitude research on Montessori Education in comparison to traditional education was published last year by a psychology professor at the University of Virginia, Dr. Angeline Lillard.. Her recent article was so well researched and documented, that it is the only educational article ever to be published in a scientific magazine.<br>  <br>  Her findings and other studies’ report that Montessori students have:<br>  <br>  *more interest in learning,<br>  *more self disciplined<br>  * have a greater understanding of truth and fairness<br>  *more creativity, especially in their writing<br>  *are more independence<br>  *a better understanding of concepts from grammar and story structure to mathematical operations, algebra and geometry<br>  *have a deep understanding of and how geography, history, social studies, and science are all related.<br>  <br>  For more information check out Angeline Lillard Ph.D's book Montessori: The Science Behind the Genius|`|fKhGVwGiaa	The primary difference is that Montessori classrooms are child-centered; children make their own choices; the teacher is not an authority figure but rather a facilitator; and children are  encouraged to spend as little or as much time on an activity as they wish.  How can this be?  Again and again, the Montessori method shows us that when children make their own choices and have freedom of choice and movement, they LOVE to learn; see learning as an enjoyable process; are inspired by their own work; and are motivated to progress through the materials and discover new things.  This can happen in a traditional classroom, but so often children grudgingly do their school work to make their parents and teachers happy--which does not lend to a lifelong learner but rather one who looks for external rewards.  When those external rewards dry up, they are no longer motivated.  Montessori children learn because they are driven by their own curiosity and desire to explore.  Hope this helps.

q2b3C8AMaa	She would have to go back to school and get her Masters in Education. At least in my state if you don't have a Bachelors in Education and want to be a teacher, you have to go get your Masters in it. Since she already has a Bachelors in Biology she probably would be able to teach it in school, probably grades 9-12. She will also have to pass the state licensing to become a certified teacher. A lot of schools won't hire these days if they are not certified. If they do hire them and they are not certified they have to full fill their certification within a certain time frame. I would have her talk to a school where she would consider going to get her Masters and get more info on from them on what she would need.

sYxDRcyeaa	medical school is a very long winded thing it will proberly be about 10 years untill you can be a doctor because you will have to have a internship t a hospital and study medicine for a few years. a lawyer you have to : Four years to earn an undergraduate degree, the major can be almost anything but most students choose Criminal Justice or Political Science; some institutions offer a Bachelor's Degree in pre-law. Before being accepted to law school you must take the LSAT which is a test for admittance. If the law student carries a full credit load they can conceivably finish in three years.<br>  After graduating from law school the person will have a Juris Doctorate and may then take the bar exam in the state where they choose to be licensed. This usually occurs a few months after graduation. Most states offer the Bar exam in February and July, about two months after most schools graduate their classes. Results can take many months before they are announced. (July exam results are typically published in November!) psychology is the easiest|`|5EGm6ZLhaa	It's all relative. If you don't have the grades, i.e. a high GPA, coupled with high scores on the applicable entrance exams then all of those programs will be just as difficult to enter.<br>  <br>  You will *nearly* always, get into some form of graduate program, medical or law school regardless of your grades, but if they are poor, then you may be looking way down the tables at the schools that will admit you and then you need to wonder if it will be worth your time and money to attend.|`|mb17ouvUaa	I agree with the first answer guy. It's relative. If you have a high GPA and a high LSAT (law school admissions test) then it will be easy to get into law school. If you have a low GRE then it will be difficult to get into clinical psych program. I know people who did horrible on the LSAT and settled for a MA in psych. Personally, I think the LSAT is a much more difficult test than the GRE. So, in that sense, it's more difficult to get into law school.<br>  <br>  Also, you should look at your applicant pools. Law school applicants are usually in the top 25% of their undergrad school and to get into a decent (top tier - top 50) law school you have to be in the top 15% on the LSAT (160 and above). Psych programs are not typically as number-focused as law schools are. Also, think about lawyer personality v. clin psych personality and realize those people are your competition.
Wfe7eAY4aa	lol thanks for awnsering mine yeah basicly its 18 units grading system works as continual assesment and the more you work the more you get. in a unit you do the pass criteria then you work on merit criteria and if youve got time distingshun criteria.  to get each criteria it usally takes an essay or a task. pass's are the longest essays. merits are usually more in depth essays looking into what you explained in your pass and then distigshuns are usally conclusions. In IT there is also a lot of practical work so pass's can be like building a program or making a website.<br>  <br>  each grade point you acheive gets you diploma points <br>  <br>  so <br>  <br>  p=6 points<br>  m=12 points<br>  d = 16 points<br>  <br>  you add all your diploma points up to get a total and then there is a grade sheet which tells you what you have acheived at the end of the year. <br>  <br>  it takes 6 distingshuns and 12 merts to acheive the highest possible grade DDD which equals 360 ucas points or AAA a level.<br>  <br>  its much easier and more laid back to normal school life and its all done on computers not pen and paper especially in IT. <br>  <br>  Your timetable - because they never tell you this till your in the course<br>  <br>  1st year usally youir in one long day 9 to 3 one then one shorter one to like 2 and then 3 days to 12.30 or 1. in second year its commen to have one day of the week off.<br>  <br>  most good universitys ask for a DMM which is just acheiving merits in all 18 units however a lot of also good universitys also accept MMM which takes less<br>  <br>  It really isnt hard and dosnt take to much work to get a good grade. Also you can go on to do an HND with only a PPP which is a pass in everything which is so easy you barley work but getting a degree is a much better option.<br>  <br>  thats all i can really say lol i tried to tell you as much as possible because i was always unsure of a few things but i dont regret doing a diploma im in class now :p should be working im hoping to get a DDM or DMM my university choices asked me to acheived in the range of MMP to DDM and all are in the top 40 universitys in the uk one was in the top 10 which wanted a DDM<br>  <br>  lol hope i helped :p good luck it is much better than the academic route if i had of stayed in my old school i would have been screwed. and usally in the diploma they get you other qualifications to i did 3 essential skills courses on top of my course to get an extra 50 ucas points in ict, managment, and some other one :P. <br>  <br>  right time for me to go cya

c0d5a7f1a33c499c9bd68cf8ae1e72e1aa	Let me clear this up for you, my friend!  Yes, RA is a resident assistant, but for many schools, CA stands for commuter adviser.  Why do some people call CA's community advisor's?  Simple: because there are so few commuters at schools they simply don't care to learn what it really stands for!  Many smaller schools do not provide free board if you are an RA, but will provide a room.  CA's do not get room or board, but will usually get $1000 off of tuition.  CA's may or may not be in charge of some monitary funding from the university, depending on their responsibilities.  Bottom line: CA's and RA's do NOT share the same responsibilities and benefits.  People living close to their respective colleges tend to prefer the duties of a CA over an RA because they can not become RAs...they can only become CAs.  Many Loutima-Viscera-ShaqG's be upon you.|`|P0jExZHNaa	RA is a resident assistant and a CA is a community adviser<br>  <br>  They are basically the same thing, but many colleges and university switched from calling them RA to calling them CA.<br>  <br>  The pay is typically room and board (free room and meal plan) and anywhere from $750/yr to $1000/yr

AA10988289	There's no evidence at all to show that it does.  All people offer are examples of correlation, not causation.<br>  <br>  For example, all the best schools have school uniform, so the uniform must cause the best results.  This is flawed because the results are probably caused by a variety of other factors.<br>  <br>  School uniform may be a feature of academic and well-disciplined schools, but again it doesn't necessarily follow that there is any causal link.<br>  <br>  Imposing a uniform on a poorly performing school does not necessarily improve behaviour (and therefore results).  One observation is that teachers spend so much time enforcing uniform regulations that they have less time for other behavioural issues that actually do have an effect on teaching and learning.  The counter-argument is that by picking fights over uniform, at least you are avoiding more significant confrontations.<br>  <br>  It is interesting that most European countries don't have uniform and most of them have more successful education systems.  However, this could be yet another example of confusing correlation and causation, since these other countries don't necessarily have good education systems because of the absence of uniform and their systems could be even better if they did adopt uniform.|`|7i6qj4OXaa	It improves the discipline in the school and helps the morale of the students.

LVZdzPmpaa	When a coin is widely distributed with the intent of normal, daily use, that's "regular distribution." Some coins are minted in limited numbers and intended for limited circulation as they will ultimately end up in the hands of collectors. For example, mint sets are made for collectors and are not intended to be used for regular circulation. <br>  <br>  "Currency" is paper money.|`|8YVo2Wogaa	It means there were a lot of those coins being used<br>  <br>  A coin can be "legal tender", that is usable, but there are none or very few actually being used, in "regular circulation".|`|ZzXK3nAAaa	"Regular circulation" means legal money in common usage among the public and which the U.S. Mint or General Printing Office still produces. When a coin or bill stops being made it wears out or goes into the hands of collectors, and eventually stops circulating except through rare money dealers. For example, silver coins and Silver Certificate bills have dropped out of regular circulation, though they can still be purchased from rare coin dealers. I have a few old silver coins, just so my grandchildren can see what "real" money looked like. You can't get silver dollars, Liberty Head dimes, or Indian head pennies unless you buy them.|`|Gabo2Uc7aa	It means that it was regularly used everyday by everyday citizens and was not minted with a limited number amount and/or just for collector's purposes.

fcc8fd1dee17699f35d307b5b28ee8f6aa	. At our school, to be suspended, the act or situation usually envolves an extreme act against the schools policy...like fighting..cursing a teacher..drug use..smoking..stealing etc.Usually the parents are called and told the issue but, maybe not all schools do that. They may send a letter by mail and have you sign it or just to let you know the altercation. Usually the length of the suspension is dependent upon the  seriousness of the altercation.<br>  Students are given in school suspension (ISR) for simple things like being chronically tardy, failure to obey, mouthing off, being late to class.<br>  I think most of the time students are given a paper saying why they are suspended and the exact days they will be out. Teachers are notified and the students have the option to get work from school or not but this is a policy different from district to district. Hope this helps..but if any child is suspended the parent should always follow up.<br>  And by the way...the suspended student is not allowed on school property until the return date<br>  Since your writing a novel here is a true, but unique situation that happen to me. <br>  About 10 yrs ago my neighbors son would get on the bus and head to school but when let off, he went to his buddies house to smoke pot.

At the top, you'll see tabs for 'fiction and poetry' and 'archives' where older issues are kept.<br>  <br>  And/or go to a library and ask a reference librarian for classics that will help you in this endeavor.<br>  And/or go to a used bookstore (or a new one, if you have the money) and look for the books listed as award-winners here:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_literary_awards" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_lit...</a><br>  That, in full, says 'list of literary awards' and as you will see, all in blue are links.

Compiling a list of words selected randomly from a dictionary doesn't necessarily help you acquire a greater command of the English language. In fact, unless you are using those words daily, you are liable to forget them. What I would suggest is reading (and not on the internet!). I think one excellent way to build your vocabulary is to expose yourself to literature (think classics) or to "academic" articles on a subject that interests you. You will frequently encounter words with which you are not familiar (that's when the dictionary comes in), but you will also have some idea of how the word is used in the English language.|`|LVZdzPmpaa	Improving vocabulary and spelling is ALL about studying. It's about discipline. You need to decide how important spelling and an expanded vocabulary are to you and set priorities. By the sounds of your post, you want mostly to take a "smart pill" and be done with it. Unfortunately, it doesn't work like that. If you can't make time and you don't want to study, you'll never improve anything academic, much less your vocabulary.|`|j7rBM2yTaa	Better speling and an improved...er...thingy both come from reading. <br>  My advice would be to read more books.

yijmoNbSaa	Imperialism in its purest sense removes ALL rights of the governed.<br>  <br>  We humans have taken "stabs" at imperialism, and ALL of them have come up short!  Why is this?  Have we not "tried" hard enough to make them work?<br>  <br>  Nope!  They are DOOMED to failure due to the nature of humans.  The Founding Fathers put it quite succinctly when they explained in the Declaration of Independence that we are "Given these rights by a Higher Power, and that these rights are the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."<br>  <br>  With imperialism, you are given your rights by a human figure - the leader - think Kim Jong Il or whoever the leader of China is - Hoo, Wat, Wen, Were, Wy, or How.  *laughter*  Chavez in Venezuela is the latest to embrace socialism.  Your "rights" are dependent on how he feels on any given morning.  There may be ONE morning where he decides that he tires of you and your plight, and that it is time to SEPARATE you from your life, however miserable HE decides it is.<br>  <br>  Now, we have a president, here in this country, who may not subscribe to this ideal completely the the DOI expresses so succinctly.  Since he has rescinded GWB's efforts no longer to fund abortions all over the world, he has made it apparent that he DOESN'T subscribe to the idea that all humans are guaranteed the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  His support of abortion here in the States illustrates he feels the same way about unborn Americans as well.|`|eca735eb563a6a25bedeef0050127389aa	But is imperialism always bad? Extending  influence thru trade, diplomacy, assistance etc are means of implementing imperialistic programs by powerful countries. Most places under the sway of imperialism profit from it...roads, schools, hospitals,communications, constant power supplies, and industrialization are its  common by-products.  Some nations pose a danger to this country because of uncontrolled native or not so native diseases, which if unchecked now, can have universal impact later. Some present more insidious dangers; Noriega in Panama was overthrown for endangering the US  with drugs, Mossadegh for  jeopardizing the flow of oil to the west. The liberal left justifies some of these interventions on humanitarian grounds; the conservatives on the grounds of national interest. On whatever ground, intervention is necessary whether it be for the human good or the national interest.<br>  Former colonial subjects rarely acknowledge the advances made under imperial influence without questioning the imperialist's motives. The roads, the railways, the organized mines and  plantations were built for their profit. Of course they were, but the motives are irrelevant. What were the results, beneficial or not?  Always there is benefit and education gained in these situations that enriches the entire population, particularly at its lower levels. For countries unable to help themselves grow, imperialism can be a good thing..|`|53c333d4e58da793c5bfbbb274584982aa	It includes the taking over of other countries. In the 18th century men would try to take over 'unclaimed' parts of Africa so they would try to civilize the natives. They thought they were doing a good thing however they were simply telling the Africans to forget their own religions to become Christians of whatever religion they were themselves. Also, often these invaders would make the natives work for them (collecting ivory and such) and they would treat them very cruelly.

AA11327222	Suffrage (from the Latin suffragium, meaning "voting tablet", and figuratively "right to vote"; probably from suffrago "hough", and originally a term for the pastern bone used to cast votes) is the civil right to vote, or the exercise of that right. In that context, it is also called political franchise or simply the franchise. Suffrage is valuable to the extent that there are opportunities to vote (e.g., initiatives, referendums, or elections). Therefore, suffrage varies on two independent dimensions: who is eligible to vote and voting opportunities.

But the traitor moves amongst those within the gate freely, his sly whispers rustling through all the alleys, heard in the very halls of government itself. For the traitor appears not a traitor; he speaks in accents familiar to his victims, and he wears their face and their arguments, he appeals to the baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men. He rots the soul of a nation, he works secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of the city, he infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist. A murderer is less to fear.

Ftkr9jqYaa	In most cases of murder, the victim's body can provide the police and forensic scientists with cluesabout the time, manner and cause of death. Where there has been a murder but no body is found, theinvestigators obviously have a much tougher job. In the following case, the police and forensicteams had nothing to work on than a few disconnected fragments of evidence, all of it is some strange goings-on in a pub a Billinge, near St.Helens in Mersyside.  Late one Tuesday afternoon in February 1988, Helen Mitchell telephoned her mother to say she?was,coming home early from the office where she worked in Liverpool. Helen was going away that evening with a young man she had never been on a date with before. She wanted to get home early "and have her evening meal by 5.30, so there would be time to get herself dressed and ready for the special event. Before Helen's mother put down the telephone she warned her daughter to be.careful coming home, because it was blowing a gale outside.  "I'm always careful, " Helen said. "Love you, Mum. "Bye" Those, were the last words Mrs Mitchell ever heard her daughter say. Helen did notiome. home thpt-;night. By morning she was officially a missing person. Although young people routinely disappearand turn up again a day or two later, Detective Chief Superintendent Eddie Alldred, a senior policeofficer connected with the case, felt that Helen Mitchell's disappearance was a potentially moreserious matter. In his experience, girls didn't telephone to say they were coming home early, thenfail to turn up at all.Radio Mersyside broadcast a description of Helen and the clothes she had been wearing - longbrown coat, dark trousers, red scarf and green woollen mittens - when she was last seen. Police enquiries, proceeding with some urgency, established that Helen had taken a train from Liverpool to St. Helens and had chatted to friends on the bus to Billinge. She had last been seen near the bus stopin Billinge, only 360 metres from where she lived. "Visiting Helen's home and talking to her mother reinforced my instinct that something sinister had occurred," said Chief Superintendent Alldred. "The next day, therefore, there is a strong possibility Helen had been abducted by a passing motorist, so we stopped evocar in the village case any of the locals had seen anything."Another possibility was that Helen had come to harm at some place on her way home The policetherefore searched every house, every garage, and every shed - in. fact every building on the route. The search included a pub, which was on the main street, just around the corner from the bus stop.  The police were particularly interested hi this pub, because they had learned that a large partof tne 'missing girl's leisure time was regularly spent there. During routine questioning the head barman, Terry Scott, told à detective that on Sunday night therehad been an argument in the ladies toilet, and Helen Mitchell had been involved. He was about toexplain in more detail when Detective Superintendent Tom Davies entered the pub. The detectivereported what the barman said; Tom Davies told him to take Scott to the police station and get astatement from him there - die press had arrived at the pub and Davies didn't want them getting holdof sensitive testimony before the police had had time to follow it up for themselves.<br>  <br>  Davies and a detective inspector then went upstairs to the flat occupied by the landlord of tibe pub.The sole sign of life was a Rottwieller dog, chained up near the door. It barked noisily as the ^--,,detectives came in. jThe flat was very untidy. Female clothing was scattered around the bedroom, and the living roomlooked as if it hadn't been cleaned or tidied for some considerable time. Moving around the placeslowly, the detectives noticed a suspicious stain on the wall by the bath, and some grit in the bathtubitself. There was also grit in the toilet.A detective sergeant appeared in ihe flat, to the accompaniment of more barking from the RottweilerHe had brought with him the pub landlord, Gary Butler. He was in his early thirties, a fit-lookingman with oiled, combed back hair and a small moustache. There appeared to be scratches on hisneck. "When he was asked by Davies if he knew Helen Mitchell he said yes, she was- a regularDavies then asked if Helen had ever been in this flat. "No", Butler snapped i,:Never"Tom Davies was deeply suspicious of this man's behaviour. He led him to the bedroom and askedhim who owned the clothes strewn about the place. "My girlfriend stays here with me," Butler said"I thought you were married." Butler said he was. His wife lived up the road He added that sheknew nothing about his girlfriend.Tom Davies decided he should find out a lot more about this character. He took Butler and thebarman Terry Scott to die police station for further questioning. Because this was now potentially amurder investigation, Davies also decided to have a Forensic Service examine the pub and GaryButler's car."During the initial stages of our enquiry," said Detective Chief Superintendent Eddie Alldred,"dozens of police officers interviewed hundreds of witnesses, trying to piece together whathappened, or may have happened, to Helen Mitchell.  Among those asked to recount their movements on Tuesday night was Gary Butler's girlfriend,...Sharon Tully. "I usually see Gary in the pub about seven in the evenings," she said, saw him about lunchtime and we said we'd meet at seven as usual. But about ten past six phone me up. He was talking in a whisper, so ? thought he must be at home and his wlfew?s there,.,.He said, "Sharon I'll see you at half eight." I asked him why and he said, "Nora" his wife-thought he'd been arguing with her so I said OK."<br>  <br>  'But Gary didn't return to the pub until after ten, Sharon said. She was rather huffy with him for taking so long and for a while she didn't want to talk to him.  "I was still mad at him for being late. He asked me what the matter was, and then hé said, "Sharon, "I've told her. She knows. She went berserk. And he pointed to these scratches on his neck. He said, "Look what she's done... " And then he had a bath.<br>  <br>  Sharon's account of Butler's movements on Tuesday night did not tally with Butler's own version ofevents. When a grim-faced detective who insisted that he tell the truth confronted him, Butleradmitted that some of what he had told them hadn't been true."I'll tell you the truth now," he said. "Sharon and me talked about telling my wife. I decided to tellher that night. I phoned Sharon and told her either Nora was at the pub, or I was going to see her -one or the other. I went about half past seven. I couldn't tell her. I was upset. I decided to go toSouthport. Just parked on the prom and had a think. I was crying a bit.<br>  <br>  When he got back to the pub Sharon was mad, he said. He saw her looking at his throat, so he told Sharon his wife had gone berserk and scratched his neck. He had a bath then and put make-up on tocover the scratches. He told the police he had actually sustained the scratches the Sunday beforewhen he broke up a fight between two girls at the pub "Helen Mitchell and another girl," he added."I've not seen Helen Mitchell since then."Meanwhile Dr Eric Moore, a forensic scientist, had examined the mysterious stain by the bathtub inthe flat above the pub. A chemical reagent test had shown that the stain was not blood.when Dr Moore repeated the test on stains he found around the rubber seal on the boot Butler's car, the result indicated that this time he had found blood. <br>  <br>  He collected some long hairs too, and an earring. He decided to take the entire;.carpet from the Boot of the car back to the laboratory, together with dried mud samples from the/oiiisiiàe.ahd inside of the vehicle<br>  <br>  Later, Detective Chief Superintendent Eddie Alldred visited Mrs Mitchell and showed her the fear ring Eric Moore had found. Mrs Mitchell identified it as her daughter's. "Mildred, than asked if Helen had ever been a blood donor. Her mother said no, she hadn't. Before he left, ál|<ired asked if she could take Helen's hairbrush. Helen used heated rollers, Mrs Mitchell said.<br>  <br>  Once we had confirmed the earring was Helen's," Aildred explained later, "we had enoughevidence to arrest Butler. The law then allowed us a total of three days to build up the evidence, tryto find Helen's body and break Butler's story."Shortly afterwards an Alsatian dog, roaming free on a canal bank at nearby Hollins Green, cameacross a bundle of heavily bloodstained clothing. The dog's owner reported the find to the police.The clothing was picked up, bagged and sent directly to the Forensic Science Office at Chorley.At that point Dr Moore was examining specimens of Helen's hair from her heated rollers. It was very long hair - individual strands of up to 45 centimetres were found and it had been subjected to a variety of tints and treatments, so the hairs showed a gradual colour change along their length.<br>  <br>  Dr. Moore believed these samples were useful, because hair as unusual as that would be easy enough to distinguish from other specimens. When the hair from the rollers were microscopically compared with the ha§s found in the boot of Butler's car, they matched. Distortions of the root structure of the hairs taken from the car showed they had been forcibly pulled out.  All this time a massive search was going on for Helen Mitchell's body. The area where she lived is with lots of water, and while divers made extensive underwater searches, the ground, was carried out by hundreds of police officers from several forces, augmente

Of course it's politically incorrect and just plain insensitive to use such words in public. I can remember Tiger Woods being berated in the media when he stated "I putted like a spazz" in a US Open - meaning like a handicapped person. Of course if you're sitting around a fireside chatting with your old friends, you can call each other names and it's never taken out of context nor intended as insults.

72a759eadcb04ef83b501e2c3dcde213aa	putting your effort in the wrong places does not help lol - just because you put a lot of effort into something, it doesn't necessarily mean it will turn out great<br>  <br>  right to make your essays more thrilling to look at:<br>  <br>  analyse your audience and tailor it to their vocabulary and their interests<br>  use a variety of words ( using for instance 3-4 times in the same page can be mind numbing)<br>  vary the length of your sentences<br>  use impact words - they are short and punchy (if you want some ideas on this try reading a tabloid newspaper for about 2 weeks and you should begin to see it in your essays)<br>  <br>  structure it so it seems obvious what you're talking about e.g. introduction you may talk about how teenagers today maybe messed up and provide some points to talk about; use these points in your body and make each point a paragraph that flows for instance you could say how drugs is a problem, then say how drug promotes antisocial behaviour because of the chemicals in them then link it to aggressive crimes like knife crimes or bullying then mention how they fund their drugs via stealing etc. do you see how it seems to flow in a chain?<br>  <br>  you might notice that writing essays is not the same thing as writing obituaries or reports on a tree's life cycle. It's dynamic, it is bounded with your interests and you can put your ideas on paper so not only one person knows but whoever isn't there to hear you talk about it will also know. writing essays is about self expression and you should enjoy it to the full.<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|kTlbsuKZaa	I had the same trouble until somebody pointed out to me that I hadn't been taught the correct way to write essays. They recommended: a beginning, a middle and a finish. For your beginning you have to state clearly what your essay is aiming to do and then introduce your reader to the subject and ideas.  Your second section is where you give concrete evidence fr your beliefs, citing various publications etc and going into the matter as deeply as space will allow.  For your third part you sum up what has gone before and come to your conclusion, ad always, but always, try to keep to your topic and don't stray.|`|DD6QxUURaa	Spider diagram and writing frames always help me to get started and once I have it is much easier. I stick a big bit of paper on the wall with the question/essay title in the middle and then just write anything that comes into my head about what it is. It doesn't have to be anything to do with it but I put everything down, it could be whole sentences or just words or ideas from books that I've read or films I've seen, something that happened to me recently, descriptive words... anything.<br>  <br>  Then I draw large boxes onto pieces of A4 and put a title in each box like "start" "character" "story plan" and "end". Then I sort my ideas into each box writing in proper sentences. <br>  <br>  When I've filled them all in, I go and do something like half an hour on the computer and go back to it fresh. <br>  Works for me! HOpe that helps|`|hJHJyUWPaa	unless you like the topic, essay writing can generally be boring unfortunately! always have a beginning middle and an end. always read over it at least twice before you hand it in to make sure it reads well, and do any editing you feel necessary.|`|tvF86mRDaa	Yeah here's the best advice I got-<br>  "if you fail to plan, you plan to fail" - plan out all your essays!!|`|2ihu3SDuaa	Use lots of examples and just explain them if writing about a task. Use your imagination and include more information about things you find more interesting parts of the topic. Set yourself a time to do it e.g you will do it in 1 hour and no less or more or however long you think is reasonable. <br>  <br>  Try to do it all in 1 day otherwise you will have to keep re-reading your work and forgetting where you were up to. If not do a plan of what you will add to it each day so you do not forget any ideas.<br>  <br>  Also, if you write an essay and then type it up copying it you often think of better ideas to change it slightly so it flows more or you notice if you have left anything out that you wanted to put in it.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|9CHjZ8sBaa	Make sure your essay follows a logical flow of thought, making it easier to understand.<br>  <br>  This may seem like overkill but: <br>  1.get a batch of post-its <br>  2. Take the essay in small paragraphs<br>  3. Write down on one post-it the key words<br>  4. Clear a space on a wall where you study and stick it so that there is room going left-to-right and a good space down so more will fit.<br>  5.Take the next paragraph, do the same. And so on.<br>  6. When finished, glance at them in order and try and recite the essay in your head as well as you can. Then write what you retain down on paper.<br>  It may sound silly but it helped me write boring as hell history essays.

frx92Y3kaa	Hey there,<br>  <br>  I never took either of those three for my options, but i've heard good things about graphics.<br>  <br>  Graphics is when you employ computer skills with artistic skills, and I think it goes hand in hand with ICT (or IT) . Im guessing career options could be in the world of computing, designing (because modern design e.g interior or fashion uses graphics) and gaming, I guess.<br>  <br>  Art - in my school, the course is more "Fine Art" - which is very hands-on approach. For example, my friend does a lot of painting, drawing, like you'd expect from art. You dont just need to be a painter when you grow up, you can be a designer - the type who sketches out ideas and such or a job that needs delicate arranging of things.<br>  <br>  Both art and graphics need a lot of time and care because you will be building up your portfolios and having a long ten-hour(?) exam at the end of the course for your grade.<br>  <br>  In food, there's a lot of practical work in year 10 as well as theory, its mainly to do with nutrients, health and safety and stuff like that. You don't just need to be a chef, you could be a nutritionist, health consultant, all sorts of job if you have an interest in food and wellbeing.<br>  <br>  Just remember that even if you choose a subject, dont just choose it because you want to aim for something specific in the future. For year nine options, keep them open and try to choose the subjects you really, really enjoy. Then you'll do them for the course- you cant just do a subject you think is ok but it might help you in the future, cos chances are if you do that you may be disappointed in your future job. So keep an open mind and do whatever you wish!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|0TEvBSQyaa	Art definatly, because with food tech its a GCSE wasted if you dont get into the Culinary career.

AA10176626	Joey:<br>  <br>  The HOPE Credit and financial aid have no influence on one another. When you submit your FAFSA, your calculated Expected Family Contribution score is based entirely on the information that you provide on the application - the Department of Education has absolutely no way of "knowing" what credits or deductions you have claimed on your IRS forms - and conversely, the IRS doesn't get to see your FAFSA form, either.<br>  <br>  When the financial aid office evaluates your aid eligibility, they, too, are not working with your tax returns - they base their assessment on that EFC score, and your tax treatments are irrelevant.<br>  <br>  The ONLY time the financial aid office would ever see your tax forms is if your FAFSA were chosen for verification - and even then, they would only use the returns to verify the income information you claimed on the FAFSA.<br>  <br>  So - no, there's no effect of tax credits or deductions on aid eligiblity.<br>  <br>  HOWEVER - the fact that you have Florida Prepaid money will impact your aid eligibility. The aid that you are eligible to receive is determined by your financial aid "need" - so the money available from the Prepaid is going to lessen the amount of "need" that needs to be made up by financial aid. In other words, since you have some "cash" to put towards your own expenses, you'll need, and receive less aid.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps.

4ab2ea36c0069d71d94055356c32ea00aa	Children can learn to read early, but here's the thing:  It just happens spontaneously.  It's really just a matter of the brain making connections that you simply can't create.  However....<br>  <br>  It seems you're skipping a step entirely.  Can your 2.5 year old spell out words yet?  That's the next step after they know the letter sounds.  Buy a movable alphabet (just google it).  See if that sparks an interest.  You can give her a 3 letter phonetic word - cat.  Have her hold up 3 fingers.  Pinch each finger (not hard so it hurts...you know what I mean) and say each sound ~ one for each finger.  /c/   /a/   /t/.  See if she can figure out what those are.<br>  <br>  Once she has done a few words, go back and read the words slowly...first by sounding them out, then by sounding them out faster...and faster...and faster...until you have it.<br>  <br>  Again, it will likely just take some time and a lot of time with you reading to her.|`|i5tOQGgFaa	Yes, I see you understand that, from a teacher's point of view, for typical developing children, this is a bit early.  But, as a mom of an early reader and having a sibling coming behind and definately already showing signs of being an early reader (mainly because of the foundation we have set right from infancy...go mom!) I can understand why you are thinking about this now. <br>  <br>  Consider rebus stories for now.  Grasping the concept of pushing these sounds together to form a word is something that doesn't naturally come along for awhile...but here are some ideas to help her along the way.  <br>  *  I like the method of putting the dots under each letter (or because she's not really reading yet or writing...point to each letter) saying the sounds and do it again and again until you are saying it fluently.  If you are showing her with something you can write on...put a dot under each letter then go back and draw a line ending in an arrow to show which directions the letter goes in.  <br>  *I've seen teachers touch their arms from shoulder to wrist as they spell or sound out the words and then doing it quicker until it's a nice smooth line down your arm.  <br>  * You can, also,  make or purchase letter manipulatives (tactile are the best) and push them together as you say the sounds so she sees the action.  <br>  *  There are letter sound cards where the child puts the picture together and it also forms the word.  I would just let her do the picture and then hand over hand go from letter to letter and sound out the word...without putting to much emphasis on it.<br>  * Leapfrog has the WordWhammer toy.  Gets a lot of use here.  Be sure to purchase the lowercase letter sets.<br>  <br>  Good luck!  Have fun...that's most important!|`|BWVDKixeaa	I suggest you try using elkonin boxes.  Each box represents a sound in a word (not the letters but the sounds) Eg cat has 3 letters, 3 boxes and 3 sounds but sheep with 4 letters will again only have 3 boxes because it has 3 sounds sh-ee-p. <br>  <br>  The children move a counter along the boxes as they hear the sounds.  You can also ask the children where they hear that sound in the word Eg Where can you hear the t in cat?  They would move the counter and put it on the end box.<br>  <br>  Here is a website to help you along...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.u-46.org/dbs/roadmap/files/Appendix/5Elkonin-soundbox.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.u-46.org/dbs/roadmap/files/Ap...</a>|`|efMkbRCuaa	A technique I use with my preschoolers is "Let's Make Cookies" We take each ingredient to make chocolate chip cookies and mix them together and when we are done we have cookies. Then I explain to them that when we take each letter sound a mix it with other sounds we have words. Now, take the flash cards and hold up each one individually. Hold up a C ask your child what sound C makes. Then hold up and A. What sound does A make? Now let's blend the sounds together CA. Now hold up a T. What sound does T make? Now let's put all the ingredients together and see what type of cookie/word we have. C-A-T. <br>  It may take a few days for your child to get the hang of it. But keep practicing!!!!

YMI6Yl18aa	He was a womanizer who held a great deal of power over the women of the court and especially of the queen. <br>  <br>  Because of his healing powers and his ability to heal the prince, he also had a lot of power over the king and queen. <br>  <br>  It was reputed that he was also having an affair with the queen, and though this might not actually be true, we do have letters written to each other that show that Rasputin had a lot of control and sway over the queen.

If so, in criminal cases juries will be used in Crown Court cases, GBH, theft over a certain amount (you'll have to google magistrates to find out what the financial limit is in the magistrates court before it goes to Crown), rape, attempted murder.  In a criminal trial the jury has to decide beyond a reasonable doubt, they have to be very sure before they can convict.<br>  <br>  In civil cases juries try defamation, libel, slander, personal injuries, they have to be satisfied on the balance, ie. 51% sure is enough.

AA10895799	I want to know why U don't to study slavery.  In many cases, the truth is still not told about slavery in the US and in Europe and in other countries.  this is necessary to prevent it or something similar from happening again.  An example is the Holocaust in  Europe by the Nazis.  t's happening again, but to different people.  U must study all history even painful topics.|`|0gn8VI2aaa	They say history repeats it self, so knowledge is the best way to keep it from happening again|`|dQvKvnVuaa	It's a part of history, so it should indeed still be taught.|`|ALvp7YRuaa	ii think we should but not do the same old thing like reports and stuff... ii mean they need to stop living the past and move on to wha tis happening now in days...|`|ljwJr6u8aa	I feel it should be a short lesson to keep morals right. they need to tell it and tech it the way it happened though.

62998c1eb5a3f349422d1d49f36b44e8aa	Learning theory is founded upon the ideas of reward and punishment. Both are critical elements to learning new behaviors. It is fundamental that we reward behaviors that we want to see repeated (desirable ones) and punish those behaviors that we want to extinguish. Therefore, if bad behaviors are learned, then the only way to get rid of them (according to learning theory) is to punish them.|`|XmxN58XCaa	the most common way to "learn" from the "sins" IS by being punished. ie. prison|`|Rp7VvIOdaa	Your point there is correct....Sinners are sinners because although they learned bad habits and were bdly influenced from the society around them they still know what's good and bad and they choose themselves to do bad deeds. That's why conscience exist for people to recognize between good and bad. However each individual has a different conscience which he developed when growing up and that's why some deeds which are considered awful to some people are no big thing to others. So the society has part of the guilt but since no one can control the society then only the individual gets punished.|`|tA8T4QYFaa	Your friend is wrong, everyone has freedom of choice, to do what they know is right and what they know is wrong (it has nothing to do with sin or religion). <br>  <br>  Blaming one's wrong choices on environment or on others is simply a way to avoid taking personal responsibility.|`|f1006988bdbdd7ae5e5276623f046308aa	Well I bet if he got shot,rapped, robbed,etc. He would change his point of view real fast and want that person who assaulted him or what-ever punished.(Sent to jail)|`|81Ru1OL6aa	wtf|`|fFSad2QJaa	no JOkes???..<br>  Awww man and i just had a good one in mind <br>  seriously everyone is a hypocrite no matter what sombody is always <br>  doing something wrong and judging the ones who do the seriously wrong to put it in a nutshell ..on my opinion is no matter what this world is going to be judmental on everyone till the end of time when ever that may be its human nature,.. but i Believe when we die we forget how to judge therefor we are renewed once again..|`|yIYEmkZyaa	Your friend's position will not be accepted as a defence in any court unless perhaps he is a child or mentally impaired.<br>  .

hheEB0wpaa	Everyone learns at their own pace and in any subject you just have to remember that just like everyone learns at their own pace everyone also learns in their own way for instance lets look at math I'm really good at math and can read equation very easy that may not be the case with you or someone else I teach my friend in chocolate bars you should try it that way or with something you like or know, it's works good because my best friend and I had a math test and we both forgot to study but it not being a big problem with me so I helped her study in the 15 mins we had to study before the test and I told her my theory  with the chocolate  bars ans she understand it perfectly me being quote on quote a "strait A student"t in math I get good marks on test well after helping her study for 15 mins she got a better mark then ME and we were both surprise so you just have to remember that you learn at your own pace and you learn your own way so find ways to to so because just because your slow or you have to have things repeated  doesn't mean  your not smart because everyone is smart people just to stupid things sometimes.|`|8TmK8Qklaa	if you have to ask ...|`|Y5jiOlAUaa	Ask again in another decade!!|`|1Ad7jJgwaa	Everyone is smart, trust me. It's all in your approach. You have to ask yourself the right questions to get the right answers. Practice your math problems constantly, like always do your homework. If you have to, stay after class to discuss it with your teacher and have an after-class lesson. It's all about taking the right approach to solve your problems, and that goes for everything in life.|`|xAEV32MUaa	Everybody is smart at their own subjects...

You just have to realize how much you really know and pursue it to see your true potential =].|`|r8j0Fglgaa	I think that might all be in your head that you're not smart.  You probably are very smart; I think it might just be a confidence issue.

Not sure what that means, but I am sure you don't either.|`|AA11489856	Nobody is born smart despite of what people think. What we call "smart people" are those who take less time to learn something than the "regular" people do and also they remember it longer. But you can do as well as they do, but you have to make much more effort than they do.  It takes you longer to learn something and you need to constantly review them so that you don't totally forget.<br>  Also you need to be motivated and determined that's all. You are not dumb or whatever you just gotta work harder. If they can do well you can do well too and even better than them.<br>  My advice to you is to stop complaining and dwelling on your low grades. The real questions you should ask yourself are why did you get those grades, what went wrong? Find out what you didn't understand, work it out and you will be fine.
Dh0JX2Onaa	The way that you write and ask questions leads me to believe that you are smart./|`|QO5p0kTXaa	Just revise longer hours. Go over it every day that way you'll be likely to remember it longer.

Take care.|`|rtk9flZ9aa	perhaps use commas instead of full stops.... it makes it flow more, in my opinion|`|4A2IxqI6aa	It's pretty common to feel like you're using too much punctuation in informal writing.  Don't worry about it - your syntax is nearly correct.<br>  <br>  The periods are fine.  Ironically, you missed a few commas!<br>  <br>  If you don't like all those periods, you can use a dash (in informal writing!) to indicate a pause as a transition to a different idea.  E.g.:<br>  <br>  Thanks, Pepo, for the help - I really appreciate it a lot, man.

South America, Spain there are jobs for English teachers everywhere. <br>  <br>  And then there always is the Far East (Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Thailand etc) if you need more adventures. <br>  <br>  Qualifications are mostly optional, unless you want to teach in a serious school. Age is not a problem ; and opportunities should be plenty. <br>  <br>  Just be careful to screen the schools before accepting a job. There is plenty of info available on the internet.|`|dLoLQHiXaa	look too see if any of the countries you are interested have National Skills Shortages.

yPfxcIb9aa	hi,<br>  <br>  I am TEFL qualified (through i-to-i), and have previously done a 1 day TEFL course. Personally I think that the longer course was much better as you cover a lot more and gain more experience plus you can do it at your own pace. When I did my TEFL course, it also included a weekend course which gives you the chance to put what you have learnt into practise, whilst at the same time learning new skills.<br>  <br>  in order to be able to get paid jobs abroad, the 100 hour TEFL course is suitable (although some countries do require a degree).<br>  <br>  Personally, what I am planning on doing is gaining a couple more years experience before attempting the CELTA course, as this will hopefully give me more knowledge of classroom management etc. plus the price difference is a lot!! Supposedly, the CELTA course is tough, so would recommend that you get TEFL qualified and then gain experience, then go for the CELTA course.<br>  <br>  it would also be a good idea to shop around for suitable TEFL courses- several of the mainstream volunteer organisations offer these courses (i-to-i, travellers worldwide etc.)<br>  <br>  hope this helps

AA10833602	To become a plastic surgeon you wil have to go to medical school which takes between 4-6 years depending on your university.<br>  From there there are 2 years of internship within the hospital before a speciality is selected, in your case this speciality is plastic surgery.<br>  After you have chosen your speciality you then train for up to 8 years in this speciality.<br>  After the 8 years you then choose a specific area of plastic surgery you would like to do (eg, facial reconstruction or breast implants)<br>  and train in this.<br>  As for right now just research lightly into medicine and this field of interest, you are still young and have plenty of time to prepare!<br>  Importantly maintain a good academic level but remember to get yourself involved as much as you can in hobbies and sports teams aswell as getting involved in your community and people. All this will help your eventual application into medical school.<br>  Best of luck!|`|9RA7mPYBaa	By the time you are 31/32, you will be all set, with all of the schooling needed|`|MVZ6Mpa1aa	You would be doing well if you qualified at 28.  32 more likely.

i4I0cuudaa	way - noun<br>  to have - verb<br>  a - indefinite article<br>  friend - noun|`|wtMOXTMAaa	The part of speech can vary with how the word is used in a sentence.<br>  I would assume, from your choice of words, that "only" is used to describe "way"--and thus is an adjective.  See the first answer for "way" and "to have" and "friend"--one is a pronoun here--and, "a," of course is always an adjective.

But on the other hand you'll be two years older and have two years more learning behind you.<br>  <br>  But the most important difference is that (if you make sensible choices) you will be doing subjects that you like - which is an enormous amount easier and more fun than grinding away at the ones you don't like.<br>  <br>  To that extent, many people find their A-level years easier than their GCSE years.<br>  <br>  Plus, you are not doing so many subjects.|`|e8FiZHkRaa	I thought it was quite a big step. When I was in Yr.11 I always used to think that science was really complicated. Now I do Biology at A-Level and I look back and think "you know...compared to this, GCSE was a piece of cake!". You may think there's a lot of pressure now but it's nothing compared to what it's like at college. Just relax! GCSEs aren't as difficult as people make them out to be.|`|OEu0wy2waa	Yes, they are. If the pressure is too much take a break after your GCSEs. You're never to old to go back to education. Just make sure you fill your time constructively and if you can't get a job in the current climate do some voluntary work, which may actually look better on  your CV than a couple of A levels. Good luck!|`|AA10847326	Yes, they're a completely different way of studying.  At GCSE level you're almost spoonfed the work, whereas at A-level you have to be a lot more independent and do a lot more 'reading around' the subjects.|`|YJGpcnxOaa	Yeh if you think the pressure is bad now its worse I'm doing my *** and am really stressed.

gqQGG9Wiaa	depends what else your interested in................ I would recommend triple science and something else fairly acedemic.

Good luck. i hope u enjoy whatever subjects u choose!|`|6qsocyK3aa	I guess you're thinking aboout your GCSE's.<br>  <br>  They will make you take the compulsery subjects for medicine such as the Sciences, you have no choice.|`|hmhrHqD1aa	Biology, chemistry and possibly pe. maths definately too|`|xqHBYiGxaa	Just choose triple science. Try your best to get at least a B in your exams.<br>  Do well in the three core subjects like : Maths,English,Science.<br>  That is mainly what they care about in Med School.<br>  If you want to get into a good med school choose some impressive subjects like ICT and History.<br>  No offence but they would rather have someone with geography than dance or drama. But chose what you enjoy because you have to do it for two years.<br>  Get some experience in when you do work experience. Go everywhere and try and get a placement. Volunteer in your community. Med school like well rounded people.<br>  <br>  Then just chose the chemistry and maybe physics A-Level and get high grades.<br>  Then all you have to worry about is Med school/Uni.<br>  <br>  The Very Best of Luck in Your Journey,<br>  <br>  Felicity<br>  x|`|CV963cQFaa	I want to do medicine too so have done loads of research into it. When I chose my options i did triple science, maths, statistics, business communications (we had to do this), history, geogrpahy, french, spanish, english lit, english language. <br>  Make sure you do a lot of extra curricular and start getting voluntary work in. THIS IS IMPORTANT!!!! they dont just look at grades. You need lots of extra stuff because it all gets awarded points to give you an overall score when they decide who gets into med school. To get these points you need to do loads of extra stuff!<br>  <br>  try duke of edingburgh award, child care/babysitting courses, voluntary work and clubs!<br>  <br>  good luck<br>  <br>  just pick subjects you'll do well in and enjoy. rounded subjects is the key!!!|`|0TEvBSQyaa	Triple Science  <br>  Sociology<br>  Depends what the school offer.|`|59c1e316d0427b8f362c88275ce81c5daa	Do as much science as you can. If your school offers a double or triple science, go for it. And for your other options, do subjects that you want to do, because there's always the chance that you might completely change your mind in the future and want to do...hairdressing or something else. Maths is always a good one to choose as well, and a humanities course (history, geography or RE).<br>  Good luck in choosing.

The 2nd one seems really helpful. Good luck! ;)|`|ZzPD423paa	Music.  Music is a universal language.  Music makes memories.  "Music is a world within itself --it's a language we all understand."(Stevie Wonder).  You picked a very cool topic!  Did you know that many studies have been done to see how listening to music might impact a person's test scores in school?  I find this aspect of music very interesting and I THINK you might too for your essay.<br>  <br>  There are differing views.  That is good.  There are many studies and some even tell which type of music makes a difference.  If you believe that listening to music can have an impact on a person's brain to where they perform better on tests, then your thesis statement might be:<br>  Music is indeed the universal language; its impact on the brain and a person's test performance has been proven many times.<br>  <br>  IF you don't think this is true, then your thesis statement might be:<br>  Music is supposed to be a universal language, but when it comes to enhancing test performance, the results just don't show this to be so.<br>  <br>  So, for your intro, start off talking about music.  Quotes about music, favorite music, whatever.  Then end paragraph one with your thesis statement.  This is the statement that you are going to prove with quotes from your sources.  It's that easy!  <br>  Conclude by going back to some basic ideas about music, restate  your thesis in a different way, and voila! you are done!<br>  <br>  Good luck!   I included three sources to start you off!|`|iPje1iyGaa	Write about the evolution of a certain type of music and how it's affected society.
c2c7a5700a2d44609d3cdf659c65a995aa	I would have thought that Matilda was rather difficult for a girl of 6 to read although it would be a good story for her to listen to being read. The trouble with the "big" words is that not being to read them and/or understand them will spoil the sense of the book's story. Have a quiet word with her teacher about this matter. Ask if your daughter's reading age has been "measured" and if so ask what it is.  (A "good" reader will have a reading age at least 12 to 18 months "older" than her real age. The school has to tell you the reading age, if known. If her reading age has not been measured you can do it at home using the Burt Reading Test (1974) Revised which you can download from the web.  <br>  It may be that your daughter has a high reading age and that her teacher thinks that Matilda is a suitable text for her.|`|5c9d5f5ba969f07d8f9e8e3aa0985cbbaa	Books are generally classified by the state in which you live to what grade they are appropriate.

34VXCyvVaa	You are more likely to get into a med school if you list it as your first choice (the med schools are seeking a high "yield" of their admitted students), but it IS dishonest to play that game with all the schools you're applying to.  It is possible that they share information within the state, so you don't want to take that chance.  List your preferred school as your first choice if you have a realistic chance of getting admitted there.|`|85DmWzHaaa	The first school doesn't matter too much. The school you and your family are most familiar with or if its location is in any way convenient to you, you should choose it. The second school usually won't mind if you went to another school before, and if they do you'll probably still be able to apply and study there.<br>  <br>  Good luck,<br>  Johnny|`|uaVQ0sd8aa	If you list a first choice you need to be a very competitive candidate.  Med schools will consider these applicants first, however they will only take from the best (as per my pre-med adviser).  The downside is that your other applications are submitted later (I think) which can negatively effect your ability to get into an alternate school.<br>  <br>  If you are pretty competitive for your particular school of interest go for it, however I would strongly caution you if you are an average applicant.  <br>  <br>  Either way, med school is med school...if you go to Harvard/BMS or a Caribbean school you still are a doctor and you will get to do what you love!  And it will still be a rough, rewarding 4 years.

7b6d9b71ec244bad6e5e7cd334ec64e6aa	Generally when publishing books you have to do a certain number of pages thats divisible by 8 or 16 so if they don't have enough info in the book to fit the exact publishing requirements its cheaper to just produce blank pages at the end to fit the printing capabilities.<br>  <br>  Also, thats why most fiction books have details of other books at the end to fill the pages. Why not use the extra space to advertise.|`|vtTUn0zcaa	These pages are called flyleafs, they are there for you to scribble ur own notes, drawings, etc.|`|Y0RBIZJzaa	scratch paper? note paper?|`|XZ4RcUHWaa	It's either the way the book was bound or it's for notes.|`|b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	Books have to be printed in multiples of eight pages.

W3UYWpxiaa	I'm 24 and 5'4'' and I understand how it can be hard to stand part from the students when you are young.  You are doing the right thing by wearing dress slacks and tops. You don't have to be flashy.  Keep doing what you are doing.  If you have the money to invest in a really good pair of heels they'll do you a lot of good.  They make you look taller and more mature.  (Just make sure they are comfortable.)  As for makeup, do a natural looking eyeliner and mascara.  Stay away from anything glittery or sparkly.  Make sure you wear a bold, yet conservative lipstick.  If you have a pair of pearl (or fake pearl) earrings or necklace pair it with your sweaters and tops.  Pearls can make anything look classy.  When you go shopping look for items that you can wear with slacks or jeans, so you get more bang for your buck.|`|AA12187539	Time will fix this by itself.  As you get older, you will also look older.  The best help will be when more of the people who work at the school know who you are.  That too will happen with time, although you should make a point of attending teacher meetings, hanging out in the teacher lounge, and participating in other activities with teachers.  I have been working at schools for a long time, and I see some young teachers too who look like students at first.  A couple of them still look like students (even a few years later), but they are good friends of mine now.  That is the key.  People who don′t know you might mistake you for a student, but as people get to know you this problem will go away.<br>  <br>  *** My first year teaching at high school, some student wrote in her evaluation of me that I had a nice butt.  It made me laugh then, and I was quite flattered.  No one says anything about the way I look now though.  The best complement I got this year was that 38 is not really old!  Enjoy being young.  It will pass soon enough.|`|IWSc7xkiaa	I would definitely "mature" that wardrobe up as much as possible. Maybe (and this sounds dumb, but I'd try it) add a broach or pin to your shirt. Borrow one from your granny if you have to. Make up might be a plus, but you have to be careful. That might make you look more like a student. Do you have a name tag? That could be a pretty big sign that you are a visitor and not a student. Do you carry a bag? If you can find one that is "teachery" you might look a little more like part of the staff. Just a few thoughts. When I started teaching I was 24 and a random student thought I was a student and asked me to the prom. I found it hilarious, but I guess that's my humor. He felt dumb when he learned that I was a teacher.|`|LIJ8qnOVaa	Well if that's you in the picture I can see where that misconception comes from, you look as if your 17.

I'm 23 teaching high school biology to students who are usually taller than I am.  The students even try to use my first name on occasion.  <br>  <br>  It already sounds like you're dressing properly.  So don't worry any more about that. Or about the make up either.  Unless you are trying to add more wrinkles or something.  <br>  <br>  Honestly, just let it go.  If people make the mistake, just laugh it off.  Use it as a conversation starter.  Let the person know that you hope they will make the same mistake ten years from now. <br>  <br>  One tip I could offer you is: carry around something only a teacher/older person would carry around.  Like... keep all your paperwork in a office type briefcase or something.  That way they'll think twice if they see you holding the item.|`|9AWjBQuaaa	I am a petite 25 yr old high school teacher who is constantly mistaken for a student.

Just ENJOY it, laugh it off and still maintain your professionalism. You're young and pretty so what the heck? Be yourself.

You shouldn't try and change yourself too much. But if you have an ID badge that says your a substitute teacher make sure you wear it. That will definitely get the hint across.

I always use the principals name and the name of ther head of department and the teacher I am replacing. It is not about apppearance, but the attitude and the status you convey.

tBxmhtx0aa	Many of the answerers are describing illegalization. Please note, decriminalization is not illegalization.Currently, possessing marijuana is a felony crime that's accompanied by jail in most cases. The cost of incarceration is very high.I actually just saw on the news another prison is closing so there is also not enough space in prisons. Decriminalization will lower the consequences.It would remove the felony charge and impose different penalties. For example maybe instead of going to jail for possession, there might be a X amount fine.

BgClmJb8aa	erm, I'll send you through my personal statement, you can play this to your benefit, say stuff like you're a well travelled person<br>  <br>  also, at some colleges you can take gcse's there for the first yr, mention your family commitments and some will accept that, perhaps it mightn't be bad to go back a year to year 11, because of your circumstance you should be allowed to do this, I'd advise it, it's the best way to maximise ur potential. And if you are applying to college, do it quickly!!! most deadlines in my area closed in january<br>  <br>  Personal statement:<br>  I am intending to study 5 subjects at Colchester Sixth Form College (Economics, Maths, Modern History, Classical Civilisation and Critical Thinking) my choices are all based around my interests and my future plans for work. I have chosen to take Modern History and Classical Civilisation because history is my strongest subject at school and these 2 periods of time interest me the most. I am currently aspiring to obtain a career in the economy or commerce, due to my interest in maths, the economy and the world of business; I intend to take economics at university to reach this target.<br>  <br>  I have often been told that I have numerous qualities that benefit both my working life and my social life. I am ambitious, but at the same time realistic, in my future plans in life; my last report supported these comments adding on that this has been a reflection of my hard work at school and at home. The report also commented that I enthusiastically take the role of being a team leader but am also willing to support others when they take a leading role. These qualities have contributed to my selection as a Prefect and an Induction Prefect (introducing year sevens to the school).<br>  <br>  I have gained several achievements in the past two years including: a silver certificate in the intermediate maths challenge and grade 1 in piano (I am currently working towards my grade 2.) In year 10 I was involved in the Young Enterprise scheme at my school, which I thoroughly enjoyed, our team progressed from the first round of competitions and won an award for a use of ICT in the second round, through this I developed business skills and confidence in speaking.<br>  <br>  For my work experience, I went to Stoke by Nayland Gold Club for the first week and Milsoms Restaurant for the second week. Through this I learnt how to make a good impression in the workplace, through being both polite and confident, the experience also taught me how to take initiative in the workplace. <br>  <br>  I have many hobbies including reading, playing tennis and golf, cooking, playing the piano and meeting up with friends. At present, I am reading The Pillars Of The Earth by Ken Follet; I also enjoy books by Anthony Horowitz. I also enjoy travelling and have previously lived in Dubai, I have also visited various other countries including: Singapore, Australia, Sri-Lanka, St Lucia and Italy.|`|KFX3dTwZaa	OMG i'm soo sorry. ive no idea, im a slow person but why not ask your form tutor? or any other teacher?|`|NohyNWKuaa	thanks for answering my question but i have no clue how to answer yours b?c idk how the UK skool system works how old r u guys when u graduate???

So many beautiful females!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Lots of fun|`|AA10494971	I just graduated from college and I can say that it was a good experience but far from the proverbial bed of roses that a lot of people make it out to be. I still had to work my butt off while I was in there and now I have to face the new challenges of the "real world" that everyone has always warned me about. Personally, I would tell you to enjoy your time in there while you can because you will probably never get those types of experiences again. As for it being the best time of your life, it kind of scares me that some people would place so much importance on one part of your life when life itself is made up of so much diverse and enriching experiences far from the classroom. So I would tell you to work hard throughout your time there, have fun along your way, and to remind you that life can be tough when you leave-so prepare yourself as much as possible. Good luck!

ZqaImrbLaa	The Raven by Edgar Allen Poe<br>  <br>  Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered weak and weary,<br>  Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,<br>  While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<br>  As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.<br>  `'Tis some visitor,' I muttered, `tapping at my chamber door -<br>  Only this, and nothing more.'<br>  <br>  Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,<br>  And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.<br>  Eagerly I wished the morrow; - vainly I had sought to borrow<br>  From my books surcease of sorrow - sorrow for the lost Lenore -<br>  For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels named Lenore -<br>  Nameless here for evermore.<br>  <br>  And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain<br>  Thrilled me - filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;<br>  So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating<br>  `'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door -<br>  Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door; -<br>  This it is, and nothing more,'<br>  <br>  Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,<br>  `Sir,' said I, `or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;<br>  But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,<br>  And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,<br>  That I scarce was sure I heard you' - here I opened wide the door; -<br>  Darkness there, and nothing more.<br>  <br>  Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,<br>  Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before<br>  But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,<br>  And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, `Lenore!'<br>  This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, `Lenore!'<br>  Merely this and nothing more.<br>  <br>  Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,<br>  Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.<br>  `Surely,' said I, `surely that is something at my window lattice;<br>  Let me see then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore -<br>  Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore; -<br>  'Tis the wind and nothing more!'<br>  <br>  Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,<br>  In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore.<br>  Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;<br>  But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door -<br>  Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door -<br>  Perched, and sat, and nothing more.<br>  <br>  Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,<br>  By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,<br>  `Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,' I said, `art sure no craven.<br>  Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore -<br>  Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!'<br>  Quoth the raven, `Nevermore.'<br>  <br>  Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,<br>  Though its answer little meaning - little relevancy bore;<br>  For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being<br>  Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door -<br>  Bird or beast above the sculptured bust above his chamber door,<br>  With such name as `Nevermore.'<br>  <br>  But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only,<br>  That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.<br>  Nothing further then he uttered - not a feather then he fluttered -<br>  Till I scarcely more than muttered `Other friends have flown before -<br>  On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.'<br>  Then the bird said, `Nevermore.'<br>  <br>  Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,<br>  `Doubtless,' said I, `what it utters is its only stock and store,<br>  Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster<br>  Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore -<br>  Till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore<br>  Of "Never-nevermore."'<br>  <br>  But the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,<br>  Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door;<br>  Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking<br>  Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore -<br>  What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore<br>  Meant in croaking `Nevermore.'<br>  <br>  This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing<br>  To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;<br>  This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining<br>  On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er,<br>  But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er,<br>  She shall press, ah, nevermore!<br>  <br>  Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer<br>  Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.<br>  `Wretch,' I cried, `thy God hath lent thee - by these angels he has sent thee<br>  Respite - respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!<br>  Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget this lost Lenore!'<br>  Quoth the raven, `Nevermore.'<br>  <br>  `Prophet!' said I, `thing of evil! - prophet still, if bird or devil! -<br>  Whether tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,<br>  Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted -<br>  On this home by horror haunted - tell me truly, I implore -<br>  Is there - is there balm in Gilead? - tell me - tell me, I implore!'<br>  Quoth the raven, `Nevermore.'<br>  <br>  `Prophet!' said I, `thing of evil! - prophet still, if bird or devil!<br>  By that Heaven that bends above us - by that God we both adore -<br>  Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,<br>  It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels named Lenore -<br>  Clasp a rare and radiant maiden, whom the angels named Lenore?'<br>  Quoth the raven, `Nevermore.'<br>  <br>  `Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!' I shrieked upstarting -<br>  `Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!<br>  Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!<br>  Leave my loneliness unbroken! - quit the bust above my door!<br>  Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!'<br>  Quoth the raven, `Nevermore.'<br>  <br>  And the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting<br>  On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;<br>  And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,<br>  And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;<br>  And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor<br>  Shall be lifted - nevermore!|`|gNHHGFNMaa	EDIT: What Lala said...<br>  <br>  MY favourite poem, by the way.|`|PqY0xNxHaa	The Raven by Edgar Allen Poe.

7Jt0kLV4aa	iPod, most definitely.  Rock band is fun and all, but my iPod is my life.  I would recommend not getting a touch.  Again, they're cool, but they don't fit as much as I'd like.  I have nearly 40 gigs on my iPod, and I listen to all of it.  Music is amazing, it is a brilliant art form.  Again, rock band is really cool, but not enough songs, and you can't really update.  An iPod can carry your music everywhere with you.  So yeah, iPod for sure.  But I'd get an 80 gig or even a 160 depending on what you listen too.  (Classical and jazz and books on tape take up plenty of space, as well as movies and such, plus if you like getting discographies of artists, and if you experiment a lot with new groups, and of course if you want the music in the highest quality available.)<br>  But it really depend on how diverse your music interests are, and what you want on it.  If you're not gonna get bored with Rock Band, get it, by all means, but my friend has it, and thats good enough for me.|`|eOb841qbaa	iPod touch. (:|`|ifYOXajoaa	I-Pod Touch. LoL! i want one!

It also must be insignificant, so people insulting you is not a pet peeve. For example, if you find that elevator doors closing before you can get in annoys you, but does not annoy all the people around you, it's a pet peeve, as it meets all three criteria: insignificant, experienced by all, and only you and a few others are annoyed by it....|`|ugRN86bYaa	Something you really dislike; usually something someone does around you.<br>  Examples of some of my pet peeves<br>  When people talk loudly on cell phones in public places.<br>  When people smoke in a public places.<br>  When parents don't take crying babies out at weddings, restraunts etc.)|`|Z5bXE2faaa	A little thing that gets on peoples' nerves.<br>  <br>  For example:  The sound of someone tapping their pencil on a desk while the rest of the room is in utter silence.|`|SFHOx2yNaa	Some little annoying thing, or acts others do that absolutely gets under your skin!!<br>  <br>  Mine is tailgaters especially in the winter weather.<br>  <br>  and back stabbing two faced people I have to work with!!!!

uZo5cLscaa	i think you are off to a pretty good start, i personally would just change the first paragraph/line to a less typical beggining, simply stating the place and time and even the excact date, try using a more abstract way of getting the point across, through dialogue, action or the character's feelings. For example, the lead "the summer breeze crept through the trees" would get the point across that it was summer, without the author having to actually say, "it was july 29th."

It can be something small like, "if I read 2 chapters tonight, I'll go out to dinner."  If it is something bigger, set a bigger reward.  "If I get A's and B's on my finals, I'm going on a shopping spree."  Try that and see if that helps.

(Possessive singular as opposed to simple plural)<br>  <br>  Imagine my surprise when the question involved boobs and body butter making them bigger.  I guess the question is about alliteration.<br>  <br>  It made me think of the old verse:<br>  <br>  Betty bought a bit of butter but it made her batter bitter.<br>  But Betty bought a better butter and it made her bitter batter better.<br>  <br>  Now we have Betty bought a bit of body butter but it made her boobies bitty.  Perhaps a bit of better body butter would have made her bitty boobies bigger.<br>  <br>  Oh, and no.

AA10023710	With rolling admissions, so long as they still have spaces available, they will consider your application. But naturally, the longer you wait, the fewer spaces are available, and more than that, the less financial aid may be available to you. So it's best to apply asap. <br>  <br>  Before you apply to Purdue, go ahead and call admissions. Make sure they aren't full up - ask if they are still accepting applications for Fall. If so, then go ahead and apply.|`|sx8MsmPSaa	If they have space, they'll consider you, so I'd go ahead and apply.
62998c1eb5a3f349422d1d49f36b44e8aa	I find it the height of irony that people who don't like an Americans exercising their Constitutional rights (and the very rights that ostensibly our soldiers are fighting to uphold!) invoke those soldiers to try to force that American into acting like "they" think they should. America is founded upon the right to certain freedoms. That includes the right NOT to engage in certain behaviors just as much as it includes the right TO engage in certain behaviors.|`|a66nvk0taa	Fuss over nothing. America is a free country right? so she has her freedom do so as she please. What has a Iraq war go to do with freedom? the Iraq war was about oil not freedom. That is pure rubbish. You are brain washed over there about freedom. Define the word freedom?<br>  <br>  S can't even spell half what she wrote there lol <br>  many family's.? she means families<br>  role modal? model<br>  those innocent life's, ? she means lives|`|vlVdn5GFaa	no. she should do what she wants. i believe not everyone believes in god. so when they say "in god we trust" some people may not believe that.  i do stand up for the pledge and put my hand over my heart for the soldiers, but i don't always believe what people say.|`|LIJ8qnOVaa	I can completely see where you're coming from. It's total disrespect on here part. And also as a teacher she should not be stating her opinion on politics, she is breaking a policy. But she must be your typical ignorant liberal to blame all of our current situations on Bush. Yes he was not the best, but he kept this nation;us Americans safe. If anyone is to blame on this war is Clinton for doing nothing when they attacked during his term, and leaving a bad economy. He made us look scared as if we wouldn't do anything. So then they attacked again during Bush's term in office and since then you have not seen a attack sense. Why? Because he kept this country safe.  We can not be a at peace with everyone, which liberals tend to think. But I do not blame anyone but the terrorist who attacked and killed all those innocent life's, and how much pain it caused many family's.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I cannot express enough how thankful I am for the soldiers(My brother) who are out there fighting for the sake of our freedom and safety. And also how much I am thankful I live in this great country. I have nothing but the up most respect for America, and am proud to be an American. When people like your teacher are inconsiderate as she is, it tends to make many mad especially people like me. And just know you are right to feel how you feel, because it's a sign of disrespect toward America and she is supposed to be a adult and role modal, not the adolescent.|`|W3UYWpxiaa	I can understand why your teacher is upset with the state of the country.  Things haven't been going well for us the past several years -- it has been rough.  Your teacher should, however, be mature enough to realize that we have a new president and our country is supposed to be headed in a new direction.  G.W. Bush  is no longer in office (and didn't do anything that happened in the past 8 years on his own...but I guess that's another question), so even if she 'blames' him for everything there is no excuse for her not being supportive of her country.  You can't make her say the pledge anymore than she can make you, but it's a shame that she is being such a poor role model for you and your classmates.|`|v905m6jRaa	David,<br>  "It takes all kinds" -- that's what the US is all about.  If you make a fuss about this you can almost bet the strongest union in your town -- the TEACHERS UNION -- will get involved.  Then you'll see what Bush bashers are really like.<br>  <br>  The liberal bias in the educational community is undisputed.  I guess we'll have to live with it until the pendulum swings back or ??<br>  <br>  Please visit this site: <a href="http://www.therightbrothers.com/indoctrinate-u/" rel="nofollow">http://www.therightbrothers.com/indoctri...</a><br>  <br>  there's a good song there (SHUT UP AND TEACH!) which you can hum to yourself when your teacher gets on her soapbox (paid for by our taxes, thank you!).|`|1UOnrM1Maa	Let me relate some personal feelings first. Then I'll answer your question directly.<br>  <br>  I don't say the pledge. I haven't in a while. I live in America, I love our ideals, but I don't think I need to talk to a flag in the front of the room everyday to show my respect. Our country has many flaws, but we don't impress upon those, do we? Therefore, it is my constitutional right not to say the pledge of allegiance, as well as your teacher's. <br>  <br>  Your principal can not legally force your teacher to say the pledge. The pledge of allegiance is very controversal in America, and many teachers have gotten fired off of making kids say it. There's no way a principal could be a hypocrit, and make a teacher say it. Besides..He has no authority over the teachers, in most cases. If you really feel a need to change something, you have to go to the school board.<br>  <br>  Try being an adult in America. Tough economic situation right now, bud. Fluctuating gas prices. Value of a dollar dropping exponentially. It's been predicted that 9% of Americans will be unemployed by the end of this year. That's a LOT of people. You have to understand why people may not be so proud to live here, right now. Sure, we've got people fighting off in Iraq. But could you tell me why? Because we initiated a war for NO REASON. <br>  <br>  It is not your place to tell an adult how to be an American citizen. Leave it be.|`|483e49b9ba8ea322e76bb65dc8f82a66aa	She is probably not saying it because she objects to the state this country is in. I spent the last 8 years being ASHAMED TO BE AMERICAN!! Now that we have a president with half a brain, I feel more optimistic and hope in a couple years to say I am proud to be american! If I was in school I would not have said the pledge either for the past 8 years, but I would now. America is one country based on government more than any other one is, people came here back in the day to start a new country where people could be free and would treat each other and other countries with respect, when our country is invading other places and in general making asses of themselves, we the people have nothing to be proud of. You sound like a miss guided kid who wants to be a good ole boy, do some research on the state of America right now and you will get her point.|`|AA10176794	I too am very offended by your teacher.  She should be setting an example of good citizenship for you.  The answer that she is angry about George Bush is unresponsive and irrelevant.  George Bush did not attack the United States, he defended it.  I'm glad that you let your feelings be known to your teacher.  She should be ashamed of the example she is setting and should have to answer for her offensiveness.|`|luwWqKCIaa	No offense, but you are a silly child.  Don't worry so much about what other people are doing and just worry about how you represent your self to the world.  If this person does not feel that they are obligated to say the Pledge of Allegiance, then just be satisfied that you are doing what you feel is right.  They are not, in fact, obligated to say the Pledge or do anything else that is not required by law, and, honestly, who care that this offends you?  Do nothing, because it isn't your problem.

oBYpsgVuaa	antigens are receptors on a pathogen (virus or bacteria) that indicates that it is foreign to your immune system.<br>  <br>  Yes, your cells have antigens, they are different to the antigen of a pathogen that is why they are detected by your immune system.<br>  <br>  Antibodies attatch to the foreign antigen and prevent it to entering a cell. It is complementary.<br>  <br>  Antibodies are protiens that are Y shaped. They are designed specifically to a particular antigen. The V part of the antibody attatches to the antigen and the I part prevents the pathogen accessing cell's receptors to enter it's host. This is because it does not fit any receptors except the phagocytes (white Blood cell) which engulf (like eating) the pathogen. If you want to sound clever say aids phagocytosis.<br>  <br>  Plasma cells which are a type of B-lymphocyte another type of white blood cell

If you want to be a CPA in the US, you will need 150 credits, usually a BBA and MBA in accounting.<br>  <br>  <br>  As for which is more prestigious, neither. a Bachelors degree is just that. There are many programs that have a BS in Fine art and that degree (depending on the institution) is considered equal to the BFA in terms of rigor and program depth|`|Moz2d806aa	Bachelor of science is better and harder. However, there are also easy/joke bachelor of science degrees. It depends on the major.|`|AA10988215	They are of equal merit, along with degrees such as B.Ed (teaching) or B.Eng (Engineering).  All Bachelor degrees are of the same level (undergraduate) and level of difficulty will vary by course.  This will be reflected in the entry requirements for each course-the higher the grades needed for entry the more challenging a course is perceived to be.<br>  <br>  However it is not necessarily the case that all science degrees are more difficult or valuable than all arts degrees-many arts degrees are also difficult.  Different people will struggle or succeed in different degrees, both arts and science.  The best degree for anyone is a degree which gets them where they want to be in life.  Often science degrees are perceived as being more 'applied' in that they may be more relevant to the workplace but again it all depends on the type of career a person wishes to pursue.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|IXskJPlVaa	Degrees/courses don not have a comparative scale to measure.

You will not fail and get a low paying job just because you drop out of High School.  Let's face it, in today's society, people expect every kid to do good in school and the only thing that they consider a good job is a good pay.  So it's all about the money and nothing else.  People are way too shallow.<br>  <br>  If you're under the age of 18, you need to get your Parents' permission and have them fill out the proper forms for you to drop out.  Go to your guidance counselor to ask about the forms.<br>  <br>  Take all the break you need, and when you get ready to go back to College, give it your all.  Although dropping out now will eliminate you for all scholarship opportunities, but if it's not the money problem, then you'll be fine.  You can get your GED, get your Associates at a Community College, transfer to a University, then go to graduate school if you ever plan on being something such as a Doctor.  Once you become a Doctor/Dentist/Lawyer/Engineer whatever it is that you want to do, the jobs that you apply for won't see if you got a stupid High School diploma from like 8 years from now.  All they care about is the graduate and probably under graduate school that you attend, and your license.  <br>  <br>  Come on people, learn to accept that not every kid is fit for school.|`|AA11041425	As a teacher, I can tell you that a majority of kids that drop out try coming back when they realize how hard it is to get a job with a GED or proficiency diploma.  I don't think it's too much to ask to finish a year or two of high school, rather than ruining the next fifty, sixty years of your life.  Besides, what do you think is going to happen when you work in the real world?  Freedom and choice of hours?  You've got to be kidding.|`|9llyTp1zaa	You're going to need the education for later, but I would suggest, since you don't like the normal school, to take courses online.

I know in FL you can drop out at 16, but you have to have a parent or guardian sign off on the papers. If your 18 you can sign yourself out. You just have to go into your schools office to do it. My friend and I both dropped out at 16, we both took the state exam and got our high school diploma's from the state (Different from a GED). She went straight into college and got her 2 year degree when she was 18. I lived on my own and had to work a full time job and a part time job to support myself. To be honest, the real world isn't as cracked up as it sounds, you still have responsibilities and instead of school hours you have work hours. After your get your diploma your days will be spend either working a stupid minimum wade job or hanging at home being bored while all of your friends are hanging out at school. It will be hard to get a decent job until your 18 since a lot of companys can't hire minors. I still don't have a college degree, but at 22 I'm making $70,000 a year. You just need to have the motivation to get where you want to be.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|yj7fKi2Kaa	its easy<br>  I did it and now i earn five hundred dollars a day on online poker.<br>  its the way to go<br>  find an outside friend and drive and dont come back<br>  study poker through the pros books and you will be on the world series of poker before you know it<br>  good luck|`|sERi28Z1aa	And you think life is going to be better in community college?

MPvYodKdaa	Quite honestly, the only reason I started volunteering and joining all the clubs was to get some hours so it would look good on my College transcript; there's really no other reason.  I'm in 2 clubs and I stay after school twice a week and it gets me 2 hours, or depending on how long I stay for.  Any other activities with the club also earns me more hours.  I'm also planning to volunteer at a hospital this coming summer for more hours... so yea, it's all for College.  If Colleges didn't consider this, I'd be at home sleeping instead of wasting my time.|`|6qsocyK3aa	It looks great on applications or resumes/CV's/whatever you call them because it proves you're willing to work without a money incentive. <br>  You gain new skills and face new sitations.<br>  You meet new people.<br>  You do a lot of good for the world.<br>  It also does wonders for how you feel about yourself.|`|YvuCN6qWaa	The reason I love volunteering as a high school student is because I like to help out. I want to learn more about my community and get involved. It's a great way to go back to where you use to go to school (if you're volunteering at your old elementary school) or to just do something when you have nothing else to do. You can also do them for community hours that are great on applications for college. Many volunteering opportunities are fun and enjoyable - not boring at all. You learn a great deal out of it and you might even want to do it again. I've signed up for about two volunteering opportunities this week and I'm super excited! :)|`|jnMtUDlcaa	Volunteer hours look great on college applications. And if you get a certain number of volunteer hours you can get the volunteer cord when you graduate.<br>  It also feels great when you volunteering. I volunteered at a overnight summer camp for a week and I went on a few 3 day mission trips. It is also alot of fun to volunteer with friends.<br>  There are tons of opportunities to volunteer at your school: library, tutor, etc.. <br>  I highly recommend it.

Yes, purple.  But we humans love to alter things so far that they are unrecognizable.  Now, carrots are orange and no one thinks about it, at all.|`|ZzPD423paa	Diana,<br>  <br>  When we cut down forests to build condos, houses, and office buildings, we are impacting the environment.  Fewer trees mean less shade, less mineral fixing roots, less oxygen being released into the air through photosynthesis.  Without thinking about what we are doing, we are making huge mistakes with our earth's healthy balance.  We build highways and tear out rain forest.  There is some speculation that what we are doing is creating the right environment for the large number of storms we are having.   We simply have to ban harmful chemicals that get into our waterways and into the fish we eat.  We need to stop polluting our air with carbon emmissions.  We need to live responsibly so that this earth will be a GOOD place for our children when we leave.  Right now, it's a big mess....But it begins with you and me.  Stop using plastic bags and use paper or cloth bags instead.  Stop throwing batteries into the garbage and take them to the hazardous chemical pick up site.  Stop buying fruits or veggies sprayed with chemicals in countries that don't control what chemicals can be used.  The list of what we CAN do is huge.  So the question is, what are we doing about it???|`|r1OQi2Lhaa	We have had a huge impact on soil and vegetation. We shaped the landscape to accomodate for farming etc and then we went beyond that changing from small houses to towns and cities. I doubt that the countryside used to be all grass with some tree belt, we made it all to accomodate our own needs. Eg, destroying forests to make way for more land redevelopment. You could also talk about reclaiming land, land that natural erosion has done away with being reclaimed to make way for airports, houses, hotels. <br>  I'm sure you'll find alot to write about on this subject.
1Mc6BOvKaa	Anything from a four days to six weeks. It all depends on how lucky you get.<br>  <br>  Although its called surface mail or sea mail, sometimes it gets flown out anyway, but only if there is space without taking out any prioriy airmail. You also may find that it is posted in time so that it just makes a sea crossing, speeding it up. Remember the sea crossing takes six to seven days.<br>  <br>  However, the official line is to allow six weeks.<br>  <br>  <br>  You also have to factor in US Customs, who may wish to inspect your mail, shipping companies, and the efficiency of the US Postal Service, and how seriously they treat surface mail. These are circumstances beyond Royal Mail's control, and this is why they give such a long estimate. It should almost certainly be out of the UK after one week.

tdJuvdeXaa	Here is how you figure this out: 120/360 is the fraction you have for the Maniacs. Now all you have to do is simplify that fraction. <br>  <br>  You can start by dividing by any number that goes into 120 and 360, like try 10. Divide the top and bottom of the fraction by 10 and then you have 12/36. Now find another number that goes into both of those, like 12. If you divide both sides of the fraction by 12, you end up with 1/3. (You could just divide by 120 from the start to make it go faster, I'm just making it easier to understand.)|`|IUOxJASHaa	120/360 equals to 1/3.<br>  <br>  I love maths! <3|`|AA12270393	I suppose you mean Maniacs.  <br>  <br>  Well, a circle has a total of 360 degrees, and the maniacs take up 120.<br>  120/360 = 1/3 or 33.3%|`|ZdQKPnvdaa	4/120|`|1jltjtjSaa	i have no clue.

deYOzBwKaa	STUDY TIPS<br>  <br>  ===========================<br>  I'm just here to give you some study tips.<br>  ===========================<br>  <br>  For a big test like this, you want to focus on what YOU know the least. <br>  <br>  For you, that's what you've forgotten in your freshman year. Assuming you have a old reference to what you learned as a freshman, you should read the entire textbook. Well, everything you've already seen, look at again.  <br>  <br>  Take notes, review, jot down what you want to refer back to, and summarize each topic with a few sentences.<br>  <br>  It's much better to have a partner recite to you the facts. Then you should ask a friend, preferably who isn't taking the test, to make a mini "quiz" for you as you study more for the exam. <br>  <br>  -----<br>  <br>  Today is devoted to getting into AP biology, so don't let anything distract you, even a younger sibling. Have a light, yet fulfilling meal such a grains and get back to work. No music.<br>  <br>  Sign out of any chat program like AIM and focus on the task at hand.|`|AA10556677	I'd review everything, to be perfectly honest. Regular biology is pretty basic stuff, so if you just get a copy of your old biology book and skim each section (look at the chapter review), you should be fine.<br>  <br>  Make sure you know:<br>  -organelles<br>  -heredity (Punnet square stuff)<br>  -DNA/RNA<br>  -Mendel<br>  -photosynthesis and cellular respiration<br>  <br>  By the way, if you're going to a public school, I'm pretty sure that the counseling office is OBLIGATED to let you take AP Bio if you want to, regardless of how well you do on the test. If they don't let you in initially, go talk to your counselor, schedule a meeting with the principal, etc. <br>  <br>  Good luck.

LVZdzPmpaa	Read over the Gettysburg address to understand that it means.<br>  <br>  Then, break it down into sentences. Memorize the first two.

Also called Estates-General.<br>  <br>  <br>  national assembly<br>  <br>  French parliamentary body. The name was used first during the French Revolution to designate the revolutionary assembly formed by representatives of the Third Estate (1789) and then as a short form for the National Constituent Assembly (1789 – 91). It was used again when the National Assembly of 1871 – 75 drafted a new constitution. In the Third Republic (1875 – 1940), the name designated the two houses of parliament, the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies. In the Fourth Republic (1946 – 58) and Fifth Republic (from 1958), the name was applied only to the lower house (the former Chamber of Deputies). The National Assembly consists of 577 deputies, elected in single-seat constituencies for five-year terms.
LwywrSRkaa	Hi, I go to a public school and I reckon you'd be fine. Maybe the quality of education might not be as good as private schools but I do find that some of my school teachers are rubbish and some are brilliant!<br>  <br>  Hah you shouldn't expect them to be as posh depending on where you go and so on. And if you're someone who gets along with people easily then people will fall head over heels wanting to be the friend of 'the new guy'.|`|YvuCN6qWaa	Don't worry about it - Public school is just as similar as private school minus the fact that in private school you pay, wear uniforms and learn about christianity(?). It's fun and the experience is great. The teachers depend on the school - some are amazing and fun, others are boring and insane. You'll make many new friends and have great time. It's just like regular private school without the private haha :) Have an awesome time!
388c35fd82cb2bf66c918c5cd9047dc3aa	Yes, they are all good classes for someone planning to go into biochemistry. Especially for a junior. Remember that you don't need to be too specialized in your classes while in high school, colleges prefer to see a strong schedule with core academic courses. Honors or AP (which is what I assume you mean by University) are also very good. Just make sure to keep your grades up and not overload yourself. Get involved in clubs, because colleges love to see that. Community service is also really good.<br>  <br>  Also, try to make sure you do something you enjoy and have some fun, otherwise you might burn out.<br>  <br>  And I know how you feel about guidance.

wQTaSyosaa	Hi!<br>  <br>  I researched both schools before deciding to go to the Academy, which I totally LOVE! Both schools cost about the same thing, I think the Academy is a little bit cheaper. <br>  <br>  If I were you, I'd go with the school that could help me be what I wanted when I graduated. The Academy doesn't have a game design degree, but you can major in animation & visual effects or illustration and work as a character developer, production artist, 3D artist, rigger or other art centered jobs on games. <br>  <br>  If you're interested in the artistic side of game development, I don't think you could go to a better school that the Academy. If you're looking for programming, you might want to look into another school.<br>  <br>  Call the admissions departments of both schools to get a better idea of what they offer compared to what you're looking for.

It sounds like you'll get pell, however 2,000 a semester  won't even put a dent in your costs.<br>  <br>  However, if you just set on that college, try to get loans or work study.  Just honestly, unless you know people, play sports, or just smart as hell, chances that you'll get a full ride, or even a half a ride is small.|`|7Rs2z1UIaa	First, calm down and take a calming deep breath. <br>  Now, if you missed the school's deadline for FAFSA, does that also mean that you missed the federal deadline? For this information, look online at the FAFSA website because I believe their deadline is in March but don't quote me on that. <br>  Secondly, make an appointment with your student advisor or with the school's financial aid department. Just because you missed one deadline does not mean that you have absolutely no way to pay for your school year. There are actually a great many ways to pay for college. If you have some scholarships, that will help; as will the part-time job. I would also suggest looking into student loans because most are only repayable once you either quit school or within a certain time span once you graduate. Also, because of your financial status, the school itself may have information not normally available to those of us outside academia which help alleviate some of the financial burden. <br>  Good luck and stay calm.

First, the question of colleges:  It doesn't matter, unless you are trying to apply to a language academy.  Either French or Spanish will do just fine.  The other questions you raise require a bit more thought.  If you live in the Southwest and plan to live there the rest of your life, Spanish probably makes more sense, for the very reason your parents mentioned.  French is lots of fun (I studied it myself) and it really is personally satisfying to be able to watch a French movie or read a book in French, but outside of the few times that has happened, my years of French study were pretty much wasted.  I live right on the Mexican border, and am unlikely to move anytime soon.  But I have a need for Spanish every single day!  You might consider two possibilities.  If the only choice you have available is "Spanish or French" (no other languages), try doing something "different from everybody else" by excelling in Spanish.  Americans are notorious for terrible pronunciation and awful grammar in other people's languages.  Break the pattern, and learn to speak like a native!  The other choice is that if other languages are available, pick one which is likely to be of value in addition to being interesting.  Russian is much easier than people think, and Arabic and Chinese scare people because they don't want to learn a new alphabet.  How silly!!  They learned this one when they were tiny children!  Can't they do it again now that they have more reasoning power??  Whatever you decide, best of luck.|`|Ee39pTcyaa	id take french its easier to learn and you may get better grades it it

e9b8d9a2dcb7d7a40bd5c28a9ae6306daa	The answers above are absolutely correct.  But I believe what you are getting at as well is, how does this work when comes time to solve equations?<br>  <br>  Most suggest that you do not get in the habit of memorizing pre-set number values and that you are best to derive the answers when it comes to solving an equation.  Memory can fool you and let you down!  For example, we know that 2.54 centimeters equals 1 inch.<br>  <br>  But what happens if you have random integers, which you do not know the equivalences to?<br>  <br>  Well, in this instance, you are best to derive them, such example wherein you are given the values and can can then assign these to the units.  <br>  <br>  What you are really doing is trying to align the steps first:  inches are closest to centimeters.  Yards are closest to meters.  <br>  <br>  Then what you are doing is using in-between steps to arrive at the values.<br>  <br>  You will want to plug in the number values in terms of the units which in your question are to be transposed into the value for centimeters and these in turn for meters: <br>  <br>  _ft/in [1ft = 12 inches]... multiplied by # in/cm...multiplied by # cm/m by # m/1  = #meters.<br>  <br>  Hmm... that's confusing.  It is this.  First match your transpositions: inches to centimeters; centimeters to meters, for example.  Then, after each step, use the values given in the next expression that match with the inches to the centimeters, then to meters and so on...  <br>  <br>  Notice that the numerator in the last quotient, [m/1] (meters divided by 1)] indicates that you now have the solution in meters, just as you sought.  The numerator in the last expression should be the same unit of measure you are seeking the answer for. <br>  <br>  You are essentially performing two steps in one: first you are corresponding the units of measure, then you are using these measures matched to the values given.<br>   <br>  This method can be lengthy and cumbersome, but it 'is' more exacting.  'Because you are not guessing when using this method.  It leads you automatically to your answer.  After some practice you do get used to it. <br>  <br>  As you go up and down, you are multiplying each succeeding numerator across then dividing each succeeding denominator across till you resolve to your answer.      <br>  <br>  Hope this doesn't confuse it...  <br>  <br>  You are correct in that the metric systems moves by increments of 10's and 10ths, 100's and 100ths, and thousands and thousandths and so on increasing or decreasing: these are your units of measurement -- but not the actual values, which show just how much of the measurement is there.  <br>  <br>  What you are doing is transposing English units into Metric units first [ or Metric to English] so that the units align to one another -- it is a twofold process.|`|LANeKStMaa	to  change  centimeters  into  meters  you  divide  by  100.|`|c1zAW18xaa	you can divide by 100 or some otha way i just for got it!  =)|`|9prnVLPMaa	100cm   =  1metre<br>  <br>  changing a metre to centimetes - you have to divide by 100|`|ihAFSbClaa	you multiply the #of meters given by 100 because there are 100 centimeters in a meter

W3UYWpxiaa	You have teaching experience on your side.  A lot of new teachers (like me) have a hard time competing with those who have several years experience under their belts.  If you get to go abroad you may be able to work with both children and adults.  You'll already know how to teach the children and the adults will respect you more because you are much more mature than a 20 year old.  I think it's a great idea!  Good Luck!

W3UYWpxiaa	You do not have to go to medical school to be a pharmacist.  You will need to do a pre-pharmacy major in undergrad which you should be able to complete in 3-4 years.  (You don't have to have an undergrad degree, but it would look great if you had it.)  Then you are looking at 3 years of pharmacy school.  Once you graduate from pharmacy school you'll be set.  Nursing would be a much harder career, but probably an easier degree to get time-wise.|`|Lr0s0gvuaa	No, med school is totally unrelated to being a pharmacist.<br>  <br>  You do need to go to a pharmacist graduate program (and these programs prefer people with bachelor's degrees, usually in some type of science).  My friend is in a graduate program for pharmacy in arizona.  After three years, she should be good to go as a pharmacist.  However, if she wants to work in a hospital setting (as opposed to at Rite aid --> working with retail), she'll have to do a residency somewhere (similar to med students who want to be doctors).  Completing a two year residency will open more doors for her career-wise.  She has heard people complaining about how boring working in retail is as a pharmacist.<br>  <br>  It is not easy to be pharmacist.  It's competitive, and unless you are wealthy will require loans.  <br>  <br>  It is difficult to compare nursing with pharmacy because nursing relies on how far the person wants to go.  It is possible be a nurse with only an associate's degree (two years).  However, other nurses require a Bachelor's and more.  And these programs can be competitive to get into as well.

It is something you know and must fulfill. The hero's destiny.<br>  <br>  fate has a negative sound to it. Nothing can stop fate. It would be like death or something serious. Or a pull. Fate brought them together.
1cfd26f25289a1245a86fe8db1bf3dc2aa	It will take time.... You will need to be serious about your role for at least a few weeks. They will test you and your limits. Set clear expectations and guidelines. Also, develop relationships as much as possible, teach them first that they can trust you and talk to you...and at the same time, you are a real person! <br>  Also, in the content area... engage them in your lessons, always keep their best interests in mind. If something doesn't work out, be the first to admit it. Know that you are learning along with them and that you need to be able to take risks, and so can they. Use as many primary (real) sources as you can. Make it real... allow them to explore all sides of an issue. Give them the opportunity to construct their own learning, and guide them through it. I would really recommend the book "Teaching Social Studies Today" by Sara Shoob and Cynthia Stout. It is a great resource. Also, for any guidance help, "Learning to Trust" by Laura Ekins. Good Luck, and Have Fun!!!!!<br>  <br>  Take advantage of this time to try things out, when you have someone to support you! Don't be afraid to try things other teachers aren't doing. But, definitely set your guidelines with them early!|`|h8fp5qs0aa	Its hard.  I remember when I was a S.T. I was not that much older than some of the students.  Try to remain formal but friendly, you are their teacher not their mate.  Do not shout, remain calm and keep your voice level.  Wear  formal close, nothing too revealing or casual (you would be surprised at what some student teachers think appropriate).  <br>  You are not on the same authority level as the teacher so do not try to be.  Nevertheless that does not mean that the students do not owe you respect and courtesy, keep it formal but friendly.  Always have your own equipment (pens paper etc.) and try not to get flustered.  If anyone makes a smart remark, reply in a level but cold tone.  Do not shout or raise your voice, but that is not the same as being quiet and mousey.  <br>  <br>  Do not wear too much make up or oover the top jewellery, some students teachers I have had act as if they we going out for the night instead of helping to teach the class.<br>  <br>  Ask the teacher in advance what he/she wants you to do, and have your prep work done well in advance. <br>  <br>  Good luck, I am sure you will be fine.|`|IXr6hdgYaa	well if your major is history.... then you know about Hitler right?<br>  <br>  then do sort of what he did. but not being cruel.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  well my suggestion is be sort of strict. don't act too nice. and BE ABLE TO MANTAIN ORDER<br>  <br>  don't worry of what the students think.   only the smart will like you and treat you correctly. and others won't but it doesn't matter. you don't have to waste your time with the loosers......I'm not trying to offend anyone....I'm just trying to make sense|`|H3Va1OKqaa	Don't be afraid to be hard on them, that's where most new teachers go wrong. Don't let them bend the rules. Good luck =)|`|1jXvhdyuaa	Congrats on the great career that awaits you! I know how you feel..I was once there. That is, counting the days until I would be able to teach and maybe, just maybe make a difference in a student's life. I will leave you with 3 small rules to live by when you teach:<br>  1. The Golden Rule: Treat others how you would want to be treated! This goes both ways! Small students are just adults trying to grow up! they are always a lot smarter than you will ever realize! You will be very surprised with how fast they learn and how fast they forget!<br>  2. Remember that there is a fine line of being a teacher and being a friend! A teacher teaches! A friend is someone who loves, sacrifices, and invests time and emotions into a relationship. I liken it to being a successful parent: It has been said that a successful parent is one who knows which end of the child to pat!  Don't ever be confused or forget to always see them as they might be rather than as they presently are. Honesty is the ONLY policy!<br>  3.  Never stop loving them and never give up on any of them!!! Remember how you feel right now! Your eagerness to make a difference, your whole future lies in front of you, your desire to be the best teacher any student ever had, and your open heart that waits to be tested, tried, stepped on, and hopefully, overjoyed! Sadly over time, many of us teachers lose and forget that young-at-heart ambition and accept indifference, routine, and being average. Your career is what you make of it! The best way to love these students is to hold on to the positive and overlook the negative!  Accept the challenges and remember to enjoy the bad and rough days for they will help you to appreciate the good ones!|`|5HjcVkmKaa	To be a good teacher, you must have a good heart. You also must have enthusiasm. This is very important. Always have a bag of tricks! :)<br>  You also must be adventurous. Do not be afraid to try new things. This is important. Have creativity also! The children will love your creative ideas. The crazier, the better! You mest also ALWAYS have conidence....NO MATTER WHAT! Always have confidence in your students. NEVER give up. Have Balance too. Don't get too stuck inteaching. You have to have a life to teach! And most of all, have compassion. Don't stand for bullies, rude comments, or innapropiate behavior done to a child. It can harm the child intensley. For a last tip, have a sense of disipline. If you bring your rules up SLOWLY but STRICTLY, in past cases, they will FALL FOR YOU!<br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|s9aWvVCeaa	im a student; here are some things i hate that teachers do.<br>  -Speak in monotone voice [instead try, changing tones to keep them interested]<br>  -dont ask if anyone needs help [theres always going to be a kid who doesnt knows, so ask twice]<br>  -a push-over[ i hate teachers who let people sit and text during class, and they even see it, so un-pro]<br>  -don't let the class get too you, thier gonna try to burst your bubble if they smell fear, walk in show them whos BOSS. <br>  trust me, if kids see a push over subby they TREAT then 10 notches low|`|9AWjBQuaaa	Do not be Ms. Nice. You need to always be firm and consistent with what you say and do. Do not try to be their friend. As a teacher it is always great to be able to have great discussions with the kids and talk to them about their lives and joke around. However, before you can get to that point you have to make it clear who is boss!|`|4db6Rzyyaa	I am in high school and I have had so many horrible student teachers. <br>  Bad qualities<br>  -didn't let students ask questions<br>  -gave out incomprehensible work and then ignored students<br>  -thought everything they did was right and were unreachable when a student asked for help<br>  -were shy and bent under pressure to loud mouth students<br>  -were cranky all the time|`|gDpFqiuzaa	be nice!! kids will love u if u r nice!!|`|ItleV9qeaa	well I'm 16 in high school so who better to tell u how to handle students then a student<br>  well to sure your authority on the first day u have to display u are strong but u are strict <br>  by doing so u simply tell everyone I'm here to help u excel and i will give u the same respect u give me and if ever u try to help them and they give u lip just send them to the office it shows other students ur strict<br>  but if anything think on the teachers u had growing up and remmeber what u liked and disliked about them and learn from it|`|l2ma3RYraa	First off you do not necessarily have the same authority level as the teacher.<br>  Second off you need to earn their respect and trust.<br>  Third lead by example.
dWovTD6Saa	I am home-schooled and I like it better because your time is spent much more productively, you don't have to wait for the 10 dumbest kids in the class to ask questions you knew the answer to 2 years ago, giving you less time to get answers to your real questions. You also get your instructor's undivided attention, so your time isn't wasted at all. There are many companies that help you out with home-schooling, and they are much better than the teachers at public schools.|`|pINonh84aa	I love it. When I am sick I don't have to make up like crazy and I don't have homework! I have friends and a life and its great to be able to graduate  early|`|NMjM2X4taa	I loved it. I learned a lot better and I didn't fall into to the drugs, sex, and drinking crowd... I know its different every where, but in MY town 90% of high school students have done drugs, 75% have had sex, and 99% admit to drinking at parties. <br>  <br>  I looked up heath dept records and found that 49% of teens in this county have an STD. <br>  <br>  I am very thankful that I did not go to public school. <br>  <br>  and if you want to know why we don't move, it's because we can't. I can't say what my dad's job is, but it is the reason we can't move.|`|mGEwdQyvaa	I *LOVE* being home schooled. I'm in 12th grade now (graduating in a few months), and I home schooled all through high school. It has been the most awesome experience, and I wouldn't trade my high school years for anything. They say home schoolers miss "the high school experience" but honestly, I feel bad for kids in public school. Sure you get dances and prom and sports and clubs and time with your friends every day, but so do we (believe it or not), and we have the chance to do a lot more that public schoolers just don't have the time for. To put it simply, I love home schooling because it provides more academic and social freedom and opportunity than the public schools in my area do.

leCSVYgAaa	You have two ways of doing this.<br>  <br>  The simpler way is to do this all to scale and measure it out.<br>  <br>  First of all, we can draw a vertical (North-South) line.  We are told that Tony is due South of Sharon, so we put Tony (T) at the bottom and Sharon (S) at the top.  This line represents a distance of 22 km, but of course your line isn't going to be that long!  Your line could be 22cm long, for convenience, but in theory you could use any scale provided you are good at converting.<br>  <br>  Now what do we know?  We know that the boat (which we can call B) is on a bearing of N26E from T.  This means that starting from North, if we move around 26 degrees towards East (so clockwise) we have a bearing of N26E.  If this is confusing, think of North-East as N45E.  N26E isn't quite as far around clockwise as North-East.<br>  <br>  So you can draw a line extending out in that direction from T, at 26 degrees clockwise from North, using a protractor.  You don't (yet) know how far the B is, so extend the line as far as you can.<br>  <br>  Do the same from point S.  This time the direction we want is 10 degrees away from South (the vertical) towards East, this time of course we are going anti-clockwise.  Extend this second line as far as necessary, until it meets the first extended line.  Where the two lines cross is the position of the boat (B).<br>  <br>  Now measure horizontally across back to the original line between T and S (the first line you drew, which represents the beach).  Convert this distance back to km and you have your answer.<br>  <br>  The second way is more mathematical, and you don't need to draw the diagram to scale.<br>  <br>  Again, we call our original two points T and S, with T due South of S, at a distance of 22 (22 "what" doesn't actually matter, it's all about ratios).  We also have a point B which is somewhere to the North and East of T, and somewhere to the South and East of S.  You can draw in a point B just to visualise it, but your drawing doesn't need to be exact.<br>  <br>  We now have a triangle STB.<br>  <br>  If we draw a line from point B perpendicular to line ST, so that it meets ST, we now have two right-angled triangles.<br>  <br>  And we know what the great thing about right-angled triangles is, don't we?  We can use sines, cosines and tangents.<br>  <br>  The point at which our perpendicular (horizontal) line from point B meets the line ST, we can call point X.<br>  <br>  We therefore have a right-angled triangle XSB.  We need the distance XB.  <br>  <br>  We don't know SB, and don't need to.  We know the angle at point S, it is given to us as 26 degrees.  We do have *some* information regarding XS, only that it is part of the beach which is 22 units long.<br>  <br>  The appropriate ratio is therefore tangent, since tan26=XB/XS.<br>  <br>  Doing the same thing for the other triangle, we get tan10=XB/XT<br>  <br>  We also know that XS+XT is 22.  <br>  <br>  So doing some rearranging of the first equation, we can say XS=XB/tan26.  Rearranging the second equation, we can say XT=XB/tan10.<br>  <br>  Putting these values into the third equation, we get:<br>  (XB/tan26) + (XB/tan10) = 22.<br>  <br>  Now tan26 is approximately 0.49 (use a calculator or look it up), and tan10 is approximately 0.18. <br>  <br>  So XB/0.49 + XB/0.18 = 22.<br>  <br>  Take out XB as a common factor on the left hand side, and you get:<br>  <br>  XB *(1/0.49 + 1/0.18) = 22<br>  <br>  then<br>  <br>  XB*(2.04 + 5.56) = 22<br>  <br>  so XB*7.6 = 22<br>  <br>  and finally<br>  <br>  XB = 22/7.6 = 2.89.<br>  <br>  This is very close to answer B, not to the nearest tenth (we would get 2.9), but only because I've been working to 2 decimal places to make the calculation easier to follow.  If you retain additional decimal places during your working, no doubt you will get an answer closer to answer B, within 1/10 as the question asks.<br>  <br>  Hope that is easy enough to follow - haven't studied this myself for 15 years so remembering and trying to explain is quite tricky!

7uGMyGn2aa	All i do is jst listen in class. Its easy, plus it means u dont have to do any 'extra' wrk outside lessons catching up. Even better when u revise its jst like ure refreshing ure memory of wot u already know, so it dosent take as long as it wud if u hadnt been listening to it in class.<br>  My personal revision preference is to do noting - lots of it. But i cant revise 4 weeks b4 cause i jst 4get it after a while, so i jst revise for a couple of days b4 the exam, becuase my mind is so set on learning the info cause ive got an important exam in a cuple of days that it jst seems to go in. <br>  But the most important thing is be confident. If u think ure good at something then u r likely to learn it better or without noticing try harder or do more wrk 4 that subject.<br>  And i know how u feel! im doing A levels this summer in History, English Literature, Classics and Genreral Studies :s.....and im terrified! hope this helped and good luck :)|`|9CHjZ8sBaa	Didnt study those but i can offer you some advice which has seen me through 2 degree courses<br>  <br>  - Sleep 8 hours a day when studying for exams and keep well hydrated.<br>  - Avoid stimulants like caffeine and sugary foods in large doses, these actually hinder retention of information<br>  <br>  - Dont be afraid to ask questions if you dont understand any topic, thats what the teacher is there for.<br>  - Get used to writing out lengthy paragraphs of information in bullet point form and in your own words as it makes it easier to process.<br>  <br>  - Always try and practice copying diagrams yourself, its no use just to learns the labels of what each thing is.|`|lkNJNnlSaa	Best advice i can give is just to do your homework on time - you don't want it all building up trust me.<br>  <br>  If you don't understand something MAKE SURE you go and tell your teacher and ask for help - that's what they are there for, just keep pestering them for help----> this is very important, use your teachers!<br>  <br>  Start revising early, don't leave ita couple weeks before the exam like i used to!! i always got away with it with great grades, but i don't recommend it.<br>  <br>  Print off every exam paper you can find from the exam board with the answers and go through them all - any questions you don't understand, you will know you will have to go back and re-read on it.<br>  <br>  Most importantly it's really down to hard work and the time you put in. It's not like GCSE where you can just doss around and get away with a decent grade.|`|v811KD7raa	the best tip i can think of is keep on top of the work, that'll make revision at the end a lot easier.  also, a good way to test your understanding is to get people to ask you questions then you answer them by explaining the answer aloud.  if you can explain something to someone else and get them to understand it, it shows you understand it|`|QO5p0kTXaa	Well you know it there's only two thing to do STUDY and LISTEN IN CLASS AND PAY ATTENTION.

MINy26pjaa	Like other palatable sweet foods, eating chocolate triggers the release of endorphins, the body's natural opiates. Enhanced endorphin-release reduces the chocolate-eater's sensitivity to pain. Endorphins probably contribute to the warm inner glow (or feeling of happiness) induced in some chocolate eaters. This sensation explains why chocolate gifts are a great way to bring joy to a loved one.<br>  <br>  This is only one of the many qualities of chocolate that are being discovered that show that chocolate, or at least dark chocolate, is actually good for us.

Your having dual citizenship won't hurt you or benefit you re: college admissions. <br>  <br>  The only way it could benefit you is if you actually are Irish, living in Ireland. Then, because you hold dual US/Eire citizenship, you would be considered American re: admissions, and would be able to qualify for US financial aid, which is a big deal. Foreign applicants don't qualify, but your citizenship would mean you would. <br>  <br>  Some US universities only accept a certain percentage of foreign applicants - but again, because you're an American citizen, you won't be considered foreign.

20M2yA9eaa	Good Country People" starts with the introduction of Mrs. Freeman and Mrs. Hopewell. O'Connor's most blatant humor is found in the revealing of these two characters, a simple humor for simple people. Immediately, the reader begins chuckling at these two from a decided feeling of superiority over them. Their sacred cliches and gossip routine automatically make the reader want to put them both in the category of "good country people," which, in itself, is an ironic title in that it suggests an immediate air of superiority by bothering to judge a class of people that are generally considered to rest somewhere towards the bottom of society's social order. Clinton Throwbridge further supports this notion when he states, "The titles of many of Flannery O'Connor's short stories are in themselves examples of what might be called "plays on cliches." What kind of rural snobbishness as well as Rousseauistic view of man is really hidden in the title "Good Country People?" (78).

mqPxgp9vaa	Can you transfer to UC Irvine?  It should be closer for you.  You didn't mention your major.<br>  <br>  I'm a community college transfer student who attended UC Santa Barbara.  CC is okay, but they're dealing with a lot of cutbacks, and you'll probably only be able to get into the most basic classes.  <br>  <br>  If I had it to do over, I would have gone into UCSB as a freshman.  That way, in my third year of school I wouldn't have been trying to start from scratch, figure out what the school is about, and making new friends.  <br>  <br>  My advice is to stay where you are and examine all the reasons why you don't like your school.

(approx $90 a credit) and coming this fall, itll be my 3rd year at a college and ill be transferring to a 4year university. technically ill be a freshman transfer student, butill have enough credits to graduate in 2 years, making me a junior. gluck on your decision.<br>  <br>  and i notice some ppl calling a CC a joke. its true.. its mad easy. but thats better for you. my gpa first year was a 3.89. that gave me soo many other schools to possibly get into. because out of HS i only have a 3.4. so itll help. also ive made the deans list every semester i was at my school. that also looks good on your transcript and resume.|`|AA10556677	Ask the student affairs person at Davis. By the way, I think you'll be bored out of your mind at CC, if you're at Davis right now...|`|AA11946812	This isn't a bad idea, as long as the credits you're taking at the CC will transfer to whatever university you will be attending.  Set up an appointment with an academic adviser - preferably, at the university you're planning to attend (UC Davis?)  <br>  <br>  Here's what you need to find out:<br>  1) What classes you need to fulfill the general education requirements for your desired major (English 1, History, etc.)<br>  <br>  2) Whether the comparable classes from the CC will fulfill those requirements.  This is the key part - just because you've taken Statistics from one place doesn't necessarily mean it will be accepted to fulfill a requirement for Statistics at another.  Make sure they have an articulation agreement.

My only advice is, just plug thru it.  It's got to get done, it's like doing laundry.  No one enjoys it.

Stuff just happens which is really nasty (and you run into some people who are really nasty) and that's the way it is.  But going around hating it every minute of every day isn't healthy, and you know this to be true.  So, what do you do to make it less awful?  First, don't let your entire life revolve around school, as many people do.  Do you have a job?  If not, can you get one?  Are you a member of any service organizations or clubs?  (Joining a club at school is O.K. because it puts you in contact with other people who are interested in the same things you are.)  Are you learning to play a musical instrument or becoming involved in community activities such as community theater?  Can you volunteer and work with others toward a goal you believe in?  All of these things give you associations with people who will like you and treat you well because you share something with them.  You will still have to go to school every day, of course.  But it will not be your entire life, and, trust me, that fact will make it much easier to handle.|`|04280f2c7903f27f68084cac15b5b958aa	i felt the same way. you will going to find friends more when time pass by! dont worry.. even if you cant.. dont worry..you have your own friends! you guys can take same classes next year~ time passes by so fast.. just enjoy being in high school|`|h4UzjZVnaa	I changed schools my junior year..

She is impatient and irritated, but Jonas reminds her that with the ceremony each year, good things happen. This year, she will start her volunteering, and the year before, she had gotten her front-buttoned jacket as a Seven. All Fours, Fives, and Sixes are required to wear jackets that are buttoned in the back so that they can learn to depend on one another. As Sevens, the children wear jackets that are buttoned in the front. As Nines, they start riding bicycles, signaling their independence. <br>  <br>  Soon, Mother, Jonas, and Lily are on their way to the Auditorium. The days of the Ceremony provide a two-day holiday for the community so everyone can attend. As a Nurturer who participates in the Naming for the newchildren, Father will join the family later. Unfortunately, Gabriel is not among the newchildren to be named. Normally, a newchild like Gabriel who has not been gaining weight normally and not been able to sleep well is released from the community. But Father had gone on behalf of Gabriel to speak to the committee who had agreed to give Gabriel one more year for nurturing at the Center. The newchild will continue to spend his nights with Jonas and his family unit, but the family had signed "a pledge" that stated that they "would not become attached" to the baby and that they would give him up to be assigned to a family at the end of the year. <br>  <br>  Inside, Jonas is glad that Gabriel had not been released. When people are released from the community, they are sent Elsewhere, never to be seen again. <br>  <br>  The first Ceremony begins, and each newchild is named and assigned to a family unit. The audience applauds for each naming, but becomes more enthusiastic when a male child is named Caleb. The child is a replacement for an earlier male child of a couple who had fallen into the river. Losses like this are very rare in the community where children are carefully protected, but when Caleb had been lost, a Ceremony of Loss had been performed. Everyone in the community had murmured Caleb's name during the day, getting less frequent and softer as the day went on so the child would slowly disappear from the minds of the citizens. Now, with this replacement child, a Murmur-of-Replacement Ceremony is performed. Everyone repeats his name, becoming louder and faster as though willing the first Caleb to return. Such rituals are performed only for the newchildren who are replacements of losses.<br>  <br>  After the ceremonies of Two, Three, and Four, there is a break followed by the ceremonies of Fives, Sixes, Sevens, and Eights. The rest is to continue tomorrow. As a new Eight, Lily goes up to the stage to receive her Eight jacket. The jacket has pockets, showing her to be old enough to take care of her personal belongings. She will also start her volunteer hours. <br>  <br>  The next day begins with the Ceremony of Nine during which the Nines receive their bicycles. A Nine named Fritz bumps into the podium after he has received his bike. Fritz is always very clumsy and awkward that he is constantly being chastised. During the Ceremony of Ten, each girl's braids are cut off, and each boy receives a short haircut. Elevens are simply given new clothes. Girls are given different undergarments for their changing bodies, and the boys are given longer pants with pockets for calculators to be used in school. <br>  <br>  Before the Ceremony of Twelve, there is a break. Jonas and his groupmates are nervous about their assignments. Asher tells Jonas about an Eleven who swam away to another community after being given an Assignment as Sanitation Laborer. Jonas dismisses Asher's story as being false, but Asher reminds Jonas that it is possible to join another community. The rules say that one can apply to be released and go Elsewhere if one does not fit in, but Jonas thinks to himself: "How could someone not fit in? The community was so meticulously ordered, the choices so carefully made." Chapter 6, pg. 48 <br>  <br>  Even for matching of spouses, there is a long period of consideration before they are actually matched so that one's application for a spouse is approved. Factors such as "disposition, energy level, intelligence, and interests" are all taken into consideration, so the husband and wife will complement each other well. <br>  <br>  For Placement of Newchildren, the Committee of Elders observes the matched spouses for three years before granting them permission to apply for children. Thus, Jonas feels confident that his Assignment will also be the right one for him; the Committee of Elders will have chosen it after long and careful thought. <br>  <br>  Chapter 7<br>  The Elevens sit in front of the stage in the order of the original numbers that were given to them at birth. The numbers are a rarely used form of identification. Jonas is Nineteen which means that he is the nineteenth child born his year, born after Fiona who is Eighteen and before Pierre who is Twenty. <br>  <br>  The

ZHH31udHaa	Well I think you should let them know all the reason you want to homeschool yourself. Present the idea that you aren't learning enough being in the big classes and so much time is wasted and things like that. Let them know you feel you would learn better at your own pace. If they say no ask them their exact reasons for not wanting you to and try to counter their reasons with your thoughts. Just basic reasoning would probably work best. I have provided an article for you to read to help you build your case. I would be interested to know how it goes. Good Luck.

Just the summary on the back jacket.|`|9prnVLPMaa	Detective Lincoln Rhymes, the foremost criminalist in the NYPD, is put on the trail of the Coffin Dancer, a cunning professional killer who has continually eluded the police. Rhymes —-a quadriplegic since a line-of-duty accident — must use his wits to track this brilliant killer who's been hired to eliminate three witnesses in the last hours before their grand jury testimony. Rhyme works with his eyes and ears, New York City cop Amelia Sachs, to gather information from trace evidence at the crime scene to nail him, or at least to predict his next move and head him off. <br>  <br>  So far, they have only one clue: the assassin has a tattoo on his arm of the Grim Reaper waltzing with a woman in front of a coffin. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ORRRR HERES ANOTHER LONGER MORE DETAILED ONE :<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Lincoln Rhyme is back – as arrogant and occasionally obnoxious as ever. And this time, the brilliant, quadriplegic criminalist is after a killer as intelligent as himself. The "Coffin Dancer," so called because of the tattoo he wears – the Grim Reaper dancing with a woman in front of a casket – is one of the rare failures of Lincoln's past career with the NYPD. He was responsible for the deaths of Rhyme's co-workers. <br>  Rhyme's team, which includes his protege, the beautiful, red-haired, criminalist-in-training Amelia Sachs, has to find the Dancer before he kills the last two remaining federal witnesses to a crime. Time is running out. They know the Dancer plans to complete his evil mission in the next 48 hours. <br>  <br>  Throughout Manhattan, from safehouses to subways, with Sachs doing the legwork and Rhyme in the command station in his townhouse, they analyze and process one crime scene after another, trying desperately to capture the cunning Dancer. <br>  <br>  Sometimes the expectation of a long awaited sequel brings disappointment. But in the case of The Coffin Dancer, Jeffrey Deaver has actually improved on the original, The Bone Collector. Sachs and Rhyme come alive in this book, and readers glimpse their growing personal relationship amidst the mounting tension. If the autocratic Rhyme, whether from his bed or wheelchair, sometimes seems superhuman (how can he be the expert at everything – fingerprints, blood splatters, chemicals, etc?) , Sachs' growing self confidence and equally sharp mind usually keep up with him. <br>  <br>  When you arrive at the last hundred pages of this book, put a Do Not Disturb sign on your door. Because those final pages are so gripping, so compelling and so shocking, that any interruptions could be detrimental to your blood pressure. <br>  <br>  The Coffin Dancer is psychological suspense at its finest.

Ftkr9jqYaa	A mystery is loosely-defined as synonymous with detective fiction — in other words, a novel or short story in which a detective (either professional or amateur) solves a crime. The term "mystery fiction" may sometimes be limited to the subset of detective stories in which the emphasis is on the puzzle element and its logical solution (cf. whodunit), as a contrast to hardboiled detective stories which focus on action and gritty realism.  However, in more general usage, "mystery" may be used to describe any form of crime fiction, even if there is no mystery to be solved. For example, the Mystery Writers of America describe themselves as "the premier organization for mystery writers, professionals allied to the crime writing field, aspiring crime writers, and those who are devoted to the genre." However, a mystery story can also be a story that has a villain that is ghostly and unknown. In this type of mystery story, it is just word of mouth that passes on the story from one person to another, and the being that is the villain may never be found by the reader or detective in the story; hence the name mystery fiction.<br>  <br>  Although normally associated with the crime genre, the term "mystery" may in certain situations refer to a completely different genre, where the focus is on supernatural mystery (even if no crime is involved). This usage was common in the pulp magazines of the 1930s and 1940s, where titles such as Dime Mystery, Thrilling Mystery and Spicy Mystery offered what at the time were described as "weird menace" stories – supernatural horror in the vein of Grand Guignol. This contrasted with parallel titles such as Dime Detective, Thrilling Detective and Spicy Detective, which contained conventional hardboiled crime fiction. The first use of "mystery" in this sense was by Dime Mystery, which started out as an ordinary crime fiction magazine but switched to "weird menace" during the latter part of 1933.<br>  <br>  Mystery fiction can be divided into several categories, among them the "cozy mystery", "police procedural", and "hardboiled" (for instance, Dashiell Hammett's The Maltese Falcon's main detective, Sam Spade).<br>  <br>  MYSTERY ELEMENTS:<br>  <br>  Alibi:  A plea offered by an accused person of not having been at the scene of the crime. <br>  <br>  Clue:  Something that appears to give information toward solving the crime. <br>  <br>  Deduction:  Collecting the facts and drawing a possible conclusion. <br>  <br>  Evidence:  Someone or something that proves who committed the crime. <br>  <br>  Motive:  A reason for doing something. <br>  <br>  Red herring:  A false lead that throws the investigator off the track. <br>  <br>  Sleuth:  An investigator or detective. <br>  <br>  Suspects:  People who appear to have a motive to have committed the crime. <br>  <br>  Witness:  Person who has personal knowledge about the crime. <br>  <br>  MYSTERY COMPONENTS:<br>  <br>  The story has a beginning where the crime and characters are introduced.<br>  <br>  The story has a middle in which the main story is told. The detective investigates the crime and interrogates the suspects.<br>  <br>  The story has an end in which the detective explains how he solved the crime.<br>  <br>  The suspects and criminal appear early in the story.<br>  <br>  All clues are given. The clues lead to the solution.<br>  <br>  The suspects have alibis.<br>  <br>  A motive is given.<br>  <br>  The story includes characters' dialogue.<br>  <br>  The story contains an element of suspense.

EvRIwz4Laa	don't you hate those types of questions...They are like Hi if you really want to come to this school tell me three good reasons why I should not let you in ;) What I usually do for these questions is weaken up some strengths. For example, I am a very hard worker and sometimes I am so dedicated to my work that I neglect my social life. Or I am too much of a yes man... what you should not say is something like I am lazy or I am addicted to drugs LOL (which I am sure your know) Good Luck|`|B1iJTtUbaa	i care too much|`|AA10556677	"I work too hard." That's cliched and a cop-out answer. Don't use it.<br>  <br>  For my interviews with private schools, I had decided that my "weakness" was going to be that I had hit a rough patch in my relationship with my parents. I wasn't home a lot, and was "distant." I never had to use it, but it seemed like a pretty good answer since it was honest, answered the question, and wasn't an academic weakness. What you don't want is something that will make them reconsider admitting you.
Ss0DaPyDaa	Hey.<br>  <br>  I would certainly look into Bordeaux, Poitiers, Tours or Université de Paris I-Panthéon Sorbonne for Law, as they maintain a close affiliation with UK institutions as well as American universities (i.e. Columbia University) for studying abroad programs. If you are from another country I advise you contact them directly with respect to your qualifications and see where you fit. Also bear in mind the costs you will incur with studying in France, in addition to the advantages and disadvantages of obtaining a French law degree as opposed to a J.D.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.
tRx5ARcSaa	My advice to you would be to skim the books over again. Write down the names of the characters, a little something about them and maybe a central theme and symbol of the book. Sparknotes or Cliftnotes are helpful for reviewing the plots and themes (but you won't be helping yourself out at all if you use them *instead* of reading the book itself!) Most of all, try not to stress yourself out too much! Set a time amount for yourself to study and then get up and do something else for 10-15 minutes (a walk around the block or just up and down some stairs can really help to clear your head)<br>  <br>  Good luck!

By extension to the female the term is also used for clitoridectomy, which can range from the ritual drawing of blood to infibulation (the removal of the clitoris and parts of the labia). Male circumcision has been read in the West to be a sign of everything from sexual hygiene, to cosmetic appearance, to tribal identity or a mark of adulthood, to either diminishing or enhancing sexual desire, to increased or decreased fertility, to patriarchal subjugation, to enhanced purity, to the improvement of sexual endurance, to a form of attenuated castration, to menstrual envy, to a substitute for human sacrifice.<br>  <br>  In Pharaonic Egypt boys were circumcized between the ages of 6 and 12.<br>  <br>  (more..........)|`|Tnh4Nz3kaa	Circumcised is when a male gets his foreskin removed from the head of his penis|`|ZjXJaPozaa	is the removal of some or all of the foreskin  from the penis

lQIKWXDuaa	As an undergrad, you can major in anything. Medical school dont have a major requirement. They just need you to complete the pre-medical school requirements. You can do whatever else you want have a double major, a minor etc...<br>  <br>  The pre-med requirements that you need to complete while in college are:<br>  Biology (I &II), Chemistry (I &II), organic chemistry (I &II), physics (I &II), Calculus (I &II), English composition (I&II). Extra classes to make your self competitive are : anatomy & physiology, Biochemistry, Microbiology, Statistic.<br>  <br>  You need a cumulative college GPA of 3.5+<br>  <br>  You also need to have research experience and clinical experience. Shadow a doctor or something. My advice to you is become an EMT or an RN while you complete your pre-med requirements, this will give you plenty of clinical experience.<br>  <br>  <br>  MCAT: you need to ACE the medical entrance exam known as the MCAT 35+ should be your goal. You take this test in you Junior Year in college. Use Kaplan or another test preparation center. Get the examkracker book it is very helpful.<br>  <br>  Familiarize yourself with this website. They are the one who give the MCAT exam and you will need to apply for medical school through them. <a href="http://www.aamc.org/students/amcas/" rel="nofollow">http://www.aamc.org/students/amcas/</a><br>  <br>  You will need 4 STRONG letters of recommendation.<br>  <br>  <br>  ss|`|XbJCCg4Raa	yes, at least an Intro. to Psych. course.|`|B1iJTtUbaa	yes it would be very helpful
4BBjhHAnaa	You can go to law school with any undergrad degree.  Poli sci is a very popular one.  Art history is not exactly common, but as long as you have good grades and do well on the LSAT, you will be fine.<br>  <br>  Some of the best degrees for law school are actually engineering and math degrees, as these take a great deal of rigor to study and demonstrate advanced logic skills, which are highly valued in law.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA10556677	You can major in anything, literally anything, and go to law school. In fact, I have a friend at Stanford Law School who majored in Biology. Do what interests you.|`|5EGm6ZLhaa	Yes, on both accounts.<br>  <br>  Academics, make sure they are rigorous and develop your critical thinking, writing, research and communication skills; hence why an art major alone would be worthless, but a double major with history is just fine.<br>  <br>  Finally, remember to work on keeping your GPA up and study for the LSAT.|`|5Kd9tdNDaa	Yes, you can major in political science and still go to law school. I am currently in law school and law school admissions welcome all majors. A political science major would help you more during law school then an art history major. :)

(Sometimes it's a "no," but at least I know)<br>  <br>  The best rule of thumb is to call or submit an email (depending on how the company likes to be contacted) the next day, but keep it simple.  Tell them how much you enjoyed meeting with them and how much you appreciated their time.  It's also okay to check to see if they needed any more information from you.  This lets them know you are serious about the job.<br>  <br>  Then for the hardest part.  Wait for about a week after that.  If you haven't gotten anything form them, call back and let them know you are still interested in the position.  It might feel pushy at first, but there is nothing wrong with being a go-getter.

IJluQFi0aa	You need to take one or the other to apply to colleges. Some people take both to see which one they do better on. <br>  <br>  The SAT is out of 2400, the ACT is out of 36. There is no failing grade but some colleges set limits like "you need this score to apply here." Also a higher score on these tests makes it more likely that you'll be accepeted to any given school. Each school has an average range of scores it accepts. <br>  <br>  So getting a good score on these tests helps you a lot in getting into college, you might also get a scholarship if you do really well. If you don't do well, it just makes it harder for you.

That's all I can really recommend. Junior year is when you can really get some opportunities at electives geared towards your future career. Also if the high school offers JROTC, I would take that.

IWSc7xkiaa	I think the most important thing is to just be yourself. If you try to be someone you are not, then that will come through and make you look silly. Also, be honest. No one like to hear "I don't know" when it comes to questions, but if they ask you a hypothetical and you honestly don't know what you would do, then say it. This actually happened to me and all I could tell my interviewers was that I would seek the advice of my fellow teachers for help or improvement in that situation. I wanted them to know (and I think I said this) that I knew I had a lot to learn, but I was willing to go the extra mile to do so.<br>  <br>  The answer to the weakness question changed for me after I had been teaching for 3 yrs. and moved to another system.

As long as it doesn't interfere with the way they do their job I don't see how they can be fired or forced to lose weight.|`|4db6Rzyyaa	These teachers are supposed to be a good influence to students. If the teachers that are supposed to be encouraging students to become more active and telling them about how important it is to maintain a health weight are overweight themselves it kills the motivation of the students because the teachers are contradicting themselves.

AA12025366	So i see you left out buckman and thomas probably because of the A/C thing.. well.. just realize you can bring your own and it is not that big of a deal.  I am considering them in my answer.<br>  <br>  Okay so the Murphree Area dorms are all very similar and pretty much the same.  Fletcher, Sledd, and Thomas all kind of pile into each other and are all one building essentially and I really wouldn't suggest those just because the entrances to them are in wierd places.  The entrances to Murphree and Buckman are on the road and it just makes it easier to orient yourself.  Buckman's location is hands down the best; it is very close to the library and is close to class. Oh and you get a sink in your room in buckman.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind all these dorms are "sectioned" instead of "floored" so the physical layout of the dorm is different than halls like Broward.  This makes it a bit more difficult to make friends in your hall if that matters to you.<br>  <br>  I could keep going about room size and bathrooms and all that jazz but in reality all these dorms are extremely similar to each other and I would just choose based on location.  Buckman is closest to everything important but not by much, the entire murphree area is good location-wise.  If you really dont want to consider it then choose murphree or fletcher because they are recently renovated.
56Vk2smLaa	Yes, they are both easily seen as guarantees.  Article 4 Section 1 guarantees that each state's decisions MUST be respected by other states.  The only way these can be changed are through Congress.  However, nowadays this is interpreted differently than it was when this was written.  Article 4 Section 4 guarantees a Republican government, and also guarantees each state protection against invasion from other states.  I see all of this as a guarantee, and I would say the answer to your question is yes.|`|p6iOehzPaa	I think they are because they're both promises made to the states.

KwuTnnNUaa	Hoagies gifted site just has a lot of info you can find on ADHD, both the commonness in gifted kids as well as misdiagnosis in gifted kids who just have a lot of energy, many interests and get bored easily!  I know you already think you have it, and maybe you do.  I say, at your age, just work with it, instead of drugging yourself.  Just my bias.<br>  <br>  As far as the SAT goes, Collegeboard is the SAT site.  I say look in their "contact us" section and fire someone off an email on this.  Since you already have a diagnosis as a exceptionally to profoundly gifted kid (educational options site I gave), what are you looking for in testing yourself more?    <br>  <br>  You sound like you have enough energy and smarts and creativity to be an entrepreneur, big time.  You really do need a lot of energy and it sounds like you have it.  Maybe Bill Gates was also ADHD...|`|e7663cf7226c2b25f5a64eeea04103cfaa	Have you been officially tested for ADHD?  And if you have, and you were not diagnosed, I would say that you probably do not have it.  It is very difficult to do as well as you do with ADHD.  You make your own potential.  That may not sound smart because I didn't put it into numbers or whatnot, but nobody has a "limited" potential.  Everything depends on your surroundings, how your week went, how your last hour went.  That is the only limit to your potential.  The first time I took the SAT, my critical reading score was very high, my math score higher than I thought it would be, but I was disappointed with my writing score.  When I took it a second time, my reading score and my math score dropped, while my writing score increased dramatically.  The first time I had slept well the night before, not under a lot of pressure, etc.  The second time, my boyfriend had just broken up with me the night before, etc.  The reason that you had increased scores was because you may have started reading more, maybe you had a moment of clarity on the SAT exam, etc.  There are so many causes.  The SAT is different from your standardized testing.  You may have felt the SAT was more important - etc.  Don't blame it on your undiagnosed ADHD, there are so many other factors that are involved on how a person does on a test on a particular day.  In statistics, when we pinpoint the chance of something happening to any one person, it drops dramatically (in comparison to the chance of it happening to an array of people).  The chance of exactly one thing happening to exactly one person, is 0.  So with those very small chances of you making a certain score on a test, that means there is a good chance that they will vary uncertainly and often. <br>  <br>  There is a decent chance that you could score 1560+.  If you are looking for old tests, go to your teachers and see if they have any.  Also, try e-mailing or mailing the College Board Foundation (the people who make the SAT) to see if they have any that they can give you.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind though, the difficulty of the SATs usually increase.
