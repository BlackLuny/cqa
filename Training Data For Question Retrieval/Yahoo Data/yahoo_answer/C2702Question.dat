Even after lunging him for 20 minutes at a time, I hop on him and he flips out. He is barn sour so he runs to the gate in our arena and tries desperately to get out some how...if I OPEN the gate...he will bolt down the field bucking and snorting..with me on him...he is such a different horse...what can I do to make him feel better about the cold??

20090305085231AAFBcJK	Pets;Reptiles	Who should get the Iguana- how often do I have to handle him? Please help?	Ok, I am making myself sick over this... About a year ago my teenage brother bought an Iguana without even knowing what it was. At the time, I did not live at home, so I did my best to relay information to him and my parents to ensure a proper living space, food and everything else.       I recently just moved back home again and find myself hanging with Iggy nearly everyday. I have become so attached to him it makes me cry to think that I will have to leave him with my family in June when I move to Chicago. However, it just sort of hit me, my brother is turning 18 next year, possibly going off to college- is getting a job now, which leaves his schedule at school until 3pm- then work until 10pm about 4 days a week.       When I leave, will Iggy be okay with being handled everyday or is this really necessary? I have done so much research and I can't really find a real answer on it. My brother doesn't even take good care of him anyway, his heart is in the right place but he is... a teenage boy and my parents don't even enforce the responsibility on him.       So I was thinking, if the apartment complex allows it, maybe I could bring him with us. I love him that much, I wouldn't mind about the extra expense of feeding or anything- I just want to make sure he is healthy! But I will be working 35-40 hours a week, so is it okay for an Iguana to be alone 5 days a week until like 5-6 at night?       I just don't want to see him sad, even worse,  I don't want to have to surrender him... it breaks my heart!
20090305084702AAJzQtU	Pets;Dogs	What to expect when neutering?	Okay, first off, let me explain- Neither of my male dogs have had access to an unfixed female, so we've never really rushed to have them fixed. I know, I know- Totally irresponsible- But I'm not in charge of vet bills for my dogs, and I've been banging on at my parents for months to get them done.   Anyway. What is the recovery for an older (7/8 year old) dog? He's a Jack Russel/ Miniature Pinscher mix, and I want a general idea of how he will behave after getting snipped. I have the other male, so I want an idea of how long to keep them separated, and also how long will it take for him to stop being so... Well, male. Him and my other dog fight, and he marks his territory, which I know will have to be trained out. The other dog will be neutered too, but later on. I'm not as worried about him, he's only 1 and a bit, so I imagine he will have a much faster recovery, and won't need retraining to the same extent.    Also, what's a general idea of cost? It doesn't matter, it's still going to be done, but I want an idea so I don't get ripped off.    Thanks to anyone who can help-I've never been old enough to really understand what this all means with a male dog- The last male dog we had neutured was when I was about ten.

20061203110428AApLxPx	Pets;Dogs	Infrequent Urination?	My almost 2 year old Aussie mix, can hold her bladder until the cows come home, and usually only pees 3 times a day.        I know that I should be grateful, but I'm starting to get concerned.  The last two days she's been holding it for 10 to 12 hours.      She  seems otherwise healthy and has a good appetite and has water available 24/7.  I'm afraid that she may end up getting a bladder infection holding it so long.  She doesn't strain when she finally does go and her urine is clear.       I am calling the vet in the morning, but want to know if  if this is something to be concerned over, or should I be grateful that she doesn't want outside every hour.      Serious answers only please.

20070706094352AAxhuLe	Pets;Cats	Cat mourning, aggressive behavior?	Okay, I have four female cats: an old 15 year old named Kitty, a fat 6 year old named Sady, a crabby 1 year old named Titus and my new 8 week old named Ella. A few months ago, we had another cat named Calley who was a little over a year old. My sister made the mistake of opening a window when Calley was still in the window sill and Calley got out and was killed by my dog. I'm concerned about Titus, because she was best friends with Calley and I knew that she was mourning Calley's loss because she got really aggressive after Calley died. Every time I picked her up, she bit and scratched me. She recently went into heat and she's really cuddly then and friendly. She's been acting like Ella is her new friend now, playing with her and licking her face and stuff. Has Titus found a new friend, or is she just looking for attention while she's in heat?

El problema es que antes, corría a su plato para comer y se acababa todo como un desesperado, y hace un par de días he notado que ya no le llama la atención su comida. Llega su hora, le sirvo, lo huele y se va. Ayer paso toda la noche sin comer nada, y hasta hoy se comio lo de su cena.   Que pasa con el? Será que no le gusta su comida?   O porque ha perdido el apetito.         De animo esta muy bien, no está enfermo, ni triste, ni nada diferente mas que eso de la comida.

One of the groomers who works for my parents breeds Chihuahua's and her best show dog is going to have puppies any day now! She said that I could have one, but it's just a matter of convincing the Parentals...   Money's not such a big issue, they cost Australian $500. And we get special discounts and stuff for food/vets because of my parents buisness.   I've wanted one since I was 5..thats 9 LONG years!   My parents don't want me to get one because they just think that it will be a nuisance and we already have 4 cats. But that's not my fault, they are all my Mum's!

I have an 11 year old Shih Tsu who is petrified of thunderstorms and it's worrying me that he's going to give himself a heart attack he gets so worked up.  I have medication that is supposed to calm him down, but they do not work, at least not when they're supposed to. And he has also gotten to be a bit more aggresive in his old age, so he doesn't like being held either. I am trying to find some other methods that could potentially help him to not become so hysterical.
20080315132217AAmEbgz	Pets;Dogs	I rescued a dog a year and a half ago, but...?	ok, I rescued a dog who was a mother in a puppy mill. She had been in a tiny kennel for 4 years, only coming out to breed with another Golden Retriever. She went to another home but it didn't work out and they gave her to a rescue. She was doing a little better, but she would hide all day, only coming out for food. We had to drag her out to go outside. She enjoys walking, though, and she loves running, so I sometimes take her on walks. She has come along way, but she scares easily, and everything I have done with her, all the training and bonding, disapears. How can I help my poor dog?

20081009123033AA0Pr4x	Pets;Dogs	What kind of dog is this?	Okay so, apparently there's A LOT of stray dogs that find it necessary to come into my (un fenced) back yard while my doggy is out there doing his thing. (Doing business, playing with toys, etc.) but yesterday, there was a blonde female dog, slightly smaller than my dog, Copper. I didn't get a picture of that one, but I did get a picture of this male dog, which I THINK is a pit bull, but I'm not sure. Usually pit bulls don't necessarily like other dogs, but he didn't seem to mess with my dog at all. (can't say the same for the but sniffing female. xD)       Here are some pictures of the dog. I took the pictures from my window.       http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g224/d...        http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g224/d...       He seems nice enough. When I whistled at him, he wagged his tail and his ears went down, which is what usual dogs that have owners do, but his ears aren't cropped (a lot of owners crop their pit bulls ears...dunno WHY.), and he didn't have a color. so I think he's a stray.      So, can anyone tell me what they think he is?

It's small enough to keep in the house, but big enough so that it's very hard to loose!      Give a reason for your animal!
20090227034315AAbVHSu	Pets;Cats	Cat pees on bathroom floor?	One of em keeps peeing on the bathroom floor.      All 3 bathrooms.      At first it was just on the rugs.      I took the rugs out.      Found cat urine on lenolium floor.       The amonia smell was overwhelming.      THE URINE IS SEMISOLID & JELLY-LIKE!      WHY?      Any chance if I take them both to see the vet that getting this jelly-urine problem fixed will stop the floor wetting?
20090305063502AA91Duv	Pets;Dogs	Does anyone know which product I can use?	I am looking for a product, that I can use to clean a New Leather Couch and Leather Loveseat, when they do need to be cleaned. My problem is, that it has to be a product that would be Non-Toxic to my dogs. They jump up on the couch Occassionally and I'm worried that if they get any of the product I use on their Paw Pads and lick their paws, that it may hurt them! Call me paranoid, I don't care! I'm not willing to take any chances! I normally use Armor All or regular Leather Cleaner, to clean leather, but because of my dogs, I think that it's probably toxic, if I use it on my Couch's! For any of you that have dogs, who have access to Leather Furniture in your house,  what do you use to clean your Leather Furniture with? Any other suggestions, or other ways to clean my couch's, without having to worry about it hurting my dogs, would be greatly appreciated.  It also has to obviously be a safe product to use on Leather! If you would please STAR this question, so my contacts can also see it, that would be great! Thanks!

20090305065106AAkbaHf	Pets;Dogs	How would you react to this?	Me and my husband have a 13 week old pit bull puppy. She is still at the stage of using the bathroom in the house and chewing and tearing up stuff in the house. Now I don't want her because she is causing me to put out more money to get things fixed. I had my cell phone on my night stand, she put her paws on the nightstand and knocked off my cell phone while I was in the living room cleaning and my husband was in the bedroom with her (not watching her). So she chewed my phone up so bad I couldn't put the battery back on it. So I was highly mad because now I can't get a phone until April when my 2 year contract is up and time for a upgrade. So I am pretty upset about that still. My husband has been off of work since yesterday, he had her out running around the house and was not watching her, he was in the bedroom and she was in the living room. Well she scratch some part of the carpet, got the cable wire chewed that up and tore up my rug that was sitting in front of the door. My husband said when he found it, he got on to her. I asked my husband if you can't keep an eye on her, put her in her kennel because she is going to destroy everything we've got! We're putting out more money than we have to. If this was your situation, how would this make you feel? I keep telling my husband, I don't want her anymore, she is causing too much trouble. We've got plenty, I mean plenty of chewing toys. If this happen to you, would you be mad, upset....? I mean I am just emotional stressed and tired with all of this, bills, money, working...I just don't want to handle this anymore

I took a sample of water to my local pet store and the PH and ammonia levels were extremely off. They suggested scrapping the tank and starting fresh. I bought a test kit and went to different store with the results. They said my PH was 5.4 and that it needed to be lowered before anything else so they had me get PH Down and add 5ml per HR  for 5 hrs, until the PH was back into the acceptable range. This morning the Ph is between 6.8 and 7.0. I am afraid to add more PH down because I think it will go past 7.0. The ammonia level today is down from 8.0 to between 2.0 and 4.0. What should I do?

20090305073855AAfbyzg	Pets;Dogs	Why does my dog have thick mucus, increased appetite and other symptoms?	My dog is 5, and has been very healthy until last fall.  She nearly constantly has a very thick, rubbery mucus from her nose, and does a reverse cough several times a day.  Additionally, her stool is looser than normal, and sometimes has mucus in it, and she is MUCH hungrier than normal.  I have taken her to the vet, they have taken x-rays (normal), done bloodwork, flushed her nose while she was under, and in general said they can not find anything else without me doing an $800 cat scan.  Does anyone have any ideas or suggestions I can make to them?  I am considering a second opinion, as she is starting to look ill.

20090305061231AAb7nzs	Pets;Birds	Keeping a chicken in my house?	We got a few game chickens a few weeks ago and we put them in a small pen just for a few hours while we made their real pens and the dogs got to them and killed to and hurt a hen really bad. We put the cage in the house and finished the pens and then put all the chickens out side but the pullet that was hurt really bad. We left her in the house and not in a pen. A day or so later the dog got in the house and got her again and she got hurt again. A day or so later my son stepped on her foot and she couldn't walk for over a week. Then when I took her to my mom's to let her see her my mom's do got to her and hurt her again. We got rid of all our dogs and the pullet is better but she is so spoiled. She eats at the table with us. Sits with us on the couch. She even sleeps with my son. She flies onto our shoulder when she wants our attention. We have two full grown hens and they are quite mean to each other. We had to put them into separate pens because one had pecked the other's head so bad  it looked like her brain was about to come out. I  have become very attached to this pullet in the house, not to mention my son that sleeps with it. But I am tired of cleaning up after it. I thought about trying to get it to use a litter box but I am afraid that it will just try to eat it. Have we spoiled her so bad that she will not survive with the others? Will we have to put her all by herself in her own pen? Or can we really train her somehow so we can keep her in the house? And one other thing. We have made places high up for her to roost but she always wants to roost on the stove. There is no food or anything there. Why is that? There is always a light on by the stove too. Don't they like it to be dark when they roost?

20090227035218AA9H2Bh	Pets;Cats	My kitten is a bit mental!?	Hi I have a kitten I have had hi, for 5 months now he is part siamese so he matured early. When we got him he meowed quite alot which we though was down to his ,issing his ,u, as the guy who gave him to us was a bit mental n seperated the two too early as he lied and told us the kitten was 2 months when he was infact around 1. So we put up with his miowing and strange behaviour which seemed to calm down a bit after a while, however the past month or so he has started again we thought it was because of his early maturing, so we got him chopped as we have a lady cat too, but now he's even worse, about 5mins after we sleep he starts miowing so we ignore him like u would do with a child, however then all mentalness breaks loose and he attacks us tries to turn on the computer to wake us up (oh yes this is no ordinary kitten!) diggs in the sheets and he is becoming unbearable he is like a new born on speed :/   Please anyone with any advice would be gratly appreciated!!!!

I really want a BC but im not sure if our situation is ideal and would just like an outside opinion. OK here's the deal me and my partner both work full-time but our days off are different so it works out that the dog would only ever be left for a max of 8 hours 3 days in a row. we own our home and have quite a large garden (also we live close to lots of green areas) i like to get up at 6am and go running usually until 7.30am and would be happy to make this walking time before work. i would also go for another 30mins+ walk in the evening. i also have 4 cats and 2 ferrets. do you think it could work?      I thought i would just add in case it makes a difference      1.my ferrets live outside in a giant hutch   2. I have previously had a lab that was a dream and the cats loved her   3. we are thinking of having a conservatory built for the dog as a room for him/her while we are out   4. my neighbours have recently got a king charles pup and so they may be ok with dropping in to let puppy out while we are at work but will have to ask.

I don't understand why this happens, because when i put them in the net they all seem healthy. This has happened twice already. So now i have about 20 little babies and i need to get them confined because the boy convict has become a little terror towrds all other fish in the tank, including the mom! I don't have the option of moving them into another tank.Does anyone know if i'm doing something wrong by putting them (baby fry) in the breeder net??

20090305082409AAO2kc5	Pets;Dogs	Do most puppies start losing their teeth at the same age?	if so, its like 4months right?  i ask because we got an australian cattle dog on dec 16 (we were told he was australian shepherd by the people we got him from).  he looked very VERY young when we picked him up, but they said he was 8 weeks old THAT DAY.  they had gotten the litter from someone else and were "rescuing them".  i dunno.  whatever.  anyways, if he was 8 weeks when we got him, than that would make him 4.5months (4mo, 13 days to be exact).      anyways, dates aside, last night we realized he had lost his first 2 teeth (one of the middle ones on the bottom, and one next to his canine on top - how cute?!).  i didnt know if different breeds usually lost them around different times, or if in general it was all about the same, so i figured this would be a good way of figuring out about how old he really is.      thanks!

20090305081959AAb62Ef	Pets;Dogs	My dog needs to mellow out!?	We have a lab, hes about a year old so i know he is still considered a puppy. Labs usually calm down at about 2 and a half to 3 years dont they? Right now he is a huge ball of energy, always on the go, jumping and running and bouncing around! He does get plenty of exercise. We walk him for an hour in the morning and an hour later in the afternoon. It's not just a mellow walk either, its a really fast paced walk, a lot of times jogging. But as soon as we get home, he goes crazy, its like the walks didn't even help his energy! I have honestly hardly ever seen this dog nap! He's either running to you for attention or wanting you to fill up his kong! I know we need to train him. I don't want to go to a trainer yet, because he is a very fast learner and doing very well for us training him ourselves, and we are going to stick with that until we need help. If you have a lab, has yours settled down some? How old is he/she?  Any other ideas to keep my dog busy?      also, I know that labs are a breed that like to have a job. He loves fetch and frizbe and all of that. Right now, if we let him off the leash, he takes off and runs away! Does anybody know where I can get the leads that are really long? It would be nice to not have to chase after him! Even in an enclosed area he can still jump the fence! (My in-laws watched him hop the 7 foot fence!)       Thanks!

Why do they do nothing? i was always under the assumption that the main religion of china was buddhism. Does Budhism not teach that you should love all animals?   Is their anything people can do to put pressure on the chinese? i know animal rights groups do as mush as they can, but surely there is something we can do?   i have included a couple of links to websites about animal mistreatment and china. it is easy to be able to emphasise with the plight of tortured omestic pets/ animals such as dogs and cats. but let us not forget they are not the only animals that suffer at the hands of people in china.    i know not all animal rights abuse is down to China but they are the biggest problem.        http://sirius.2kat.net/cats.html        http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-...        http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-... 
20090305085732AAtqDxZ	Pets;Dogs	Territorial Issues.....is this normal is this situation?  How to fix it?	We used to live in a second floor apartment but about 7 months ago moved to a first floor at a new complex.   I have 2 dogs they are both small dogs both are under 30 pounds.   They have lived in an apartment their whole lives.  Since we moved to this new apartment they have become extremely territorial around our unit and in our breezeway.   If they are out in the breezeway and see anyone walking through there they start barking like crazy.   This normally happens when we are coming in from letting them out to potty or coming back from our walk.   The worst part is its normally the smaller of the two causing problems.  But our good dog the bigger one catches the flack for it.  She has been called vicious on numerous occaisons just sitting there while our smaller dog just goes nuts.   No one seems to care that such a small dog is barking.  Infact they think its cute and get upset when we reprimand him but our bigger dog who barely barks they think is a killer.   I don't understand.   Back when we lived at our last apartment they were both so good and well behaved.   But since we moved here we have had a lot of problems.  I am personally hoping we can just get through our lease without drawing too much attention to ourselves and them and then get into our house where this won't be a big problem.   My wife however feels we need a trainer or behavorist to help.   She doesn't get we don't have the money for a trainer or behavorist.   Honestly she is the one home with them all day so I don't know what she puts up with.   I know she gets real upset because she doesn't feel I'm doing my part on training.  Because I don't get on to them when they are barking or walk the other way.   She says I don't need to just stand there and let them bark.  But I have never delt with dogs that do this.   I mean I'm doing the best I can.  When somebody comes by sure they bark and I just hold them back until I can get them inside....but my wife says we need to do more.         Is it normal for them to become territorial after moving to a first floor apartment and how can I fix it?

20090305090720AAu4pwu	Pets;Cats	Catnip: What is it and why do cats love it?	I just got a new scratching box last night that came with a catnip bag. My kittens went CRAZY. Literally. They went so goo-goo that my boyfriend and I were wondering if catnip is safe for them, lol. So...      What exactly is catnip? I thought it was a natural plant, genus Nepeta. Am I wrong? Or do they add chemicals? And besides for crazy-cat reactions, is there anything to worry about?      One web site commented that Europeans actually used catnip as tea before they started trading with other lands. And another said it's like an aphrodisiac to cats, causing euphoria. So I'm assuming it's ok for cats to eat catnip but could they over-dose on catnip??

I would do anything and everything for any of them!      I don't have children of my own, but i feel so strongly about animals that i know it wouldn't change. I don't even know if i want kids, i'm very content with what i have now.      What are your thoughts and opinions?      I see with the current recession we're in people are surrendering their pets to the local shelters because they can on longer care for them. I'm fortunate enough that this situation isn't something i've had to deal with *yet* (and i pray i never do) but i can honestly say if i had to live on canned soup and kraft dinner until things got better and i could afford food for myself.. i would absolutely keep my children.. whatever the cost was.. I couldn't surrender them. I would find a way!      What do you think? what would you do? what would be the last straw for you?

Today I got news from the breeder they had the litter, so their pup would be ready in 2months. We want to get this pup too.. they both would be males and just wondering if it's "ok" to have the 2 of them? The one would be 4months and the other 2 months. We have 5acres of land and it's definitely not a question of having the room to run and play.. but rather having 2 dogs at the same time..    Any ideas or comments out there? Maybe you have 2 dogs and can share your experience.. all would appreciated.

She was prego when I took her in to get fixed. She had  kittens. They all get along just fine. Lilly even helps Mama take care of the kittens.       This morning I got up and did my daily routine. Took a shower, blow dried my hair, and I turned on my straightener. While I wait for my straighter to get hot I give them fresh water and put food in their bowl. Then I go over and give them all some love. Well after I gave them some love I was sitting on my bed and all of the sudden Mama and Lilly were both on my head. It all happened so fast. I started screaming and put my arms up to push them off. So I have scratches on my hands, arm, forehead, neck, face, and all over my head. There was blood everywhere. My cats have never done anything like this before.      After that all happen Lilly was scared and hissing and I put Mama and the kittens in the other room.       My question is, what would make them do that and do I need to get a shot or something?
20090305090608AAUgcHI	Pets;Cats	Kitten with eye problem.?	We have adopted a new kitten to our family. Our older cat has gotten used to her and they love playing together now. When we adopted her we knew she had an infection and her previous owner and my husband and I took her to the vet together to ensure that she will be ok and to make sure our cat won't get anything. Her previous owner had explained the kittens birth, which was a difficult one. Her mother had trouble giving birth and the owner had to pull out the babies. Being that there were many the owner had some delay in breaking the sacs, plus she is 8 months pregnant and was by herself when her cat started giving birth. So some of the placenta of the sac got in her eye. Which gave her an infection. The doctor gave us vetropolycin hc to put in her eye 2 times a day. Now a couple weeks laters, we picked her up from her previous owner and had her for about a week and a half before showing her to our older cat. After a while (3 days!) They got along, and her infection cleared up.       Now the problem is while her infection was clearing up, I noticed her other eye getting irritated. I noticed more last night. I wanna know what's going on with our new baby! We can't taker her to the vet till tomorrow but I wanna know what we can do till then. Any help will be much appreciated!

She will sit and/or cry at the door to be let out.  She still does "the deed" inside!!!  We've done positive and negative re-enforcement to get her to stop going inside.  We've reward her with treats when she goes outside and uses the bathroom and saying "good girl!".  We've put her nose in her urine (when she goes inside) and say "No ma'am, bad girl" and spanking her.  It doesn't seem to phase her what-so-ever.  When she does it SHE KNOWS she's doing wrong because she hides behind chairs and cowards.  I don't know what else to do.  My older dog learned house training when she was 3-4 mo. old.  I hate to compare but I just don't have anything up my sleeve to do in order to stop the younger dog from using the bathroom in doors.  Any suggestions or additional ideas?

They are bringing in an 8 week old Staffordshire Bull Terrier.      I don't know much about the breed but I know that many bully breeds are under a lot of scrutiny and I know what is going to happen with this dog.      My uncle divorced my cousins mom years ago and she isn't a very responsible woman.      My cousin told me the other day that about 2 months ago they  had to get rid of all 3 of their current dogs.      They had 2 pit bulls who they rehomed and a Husky/Pit mix which had to be put down because he bit someone.      They dogs had never had a day of training in their life he said.  I asked where the would be keeping the new dog.      He said: "Outside just like the others"   "We will probably have to chain him to his doghouse for awhile until he learns not to run away"      In other words this dog will spend his whole life with them (which won't be long with their track record) outside on a chain.      They don't have real strict dog laws where they live...and there are a lot of chained dogs up there.      I worry for this dog and I worry for my cousin who is learning from his mother that its okay to get rid of a dog because it turns mean or because they don't want it anymore.      Is there anything I can do to help my cousin so this doesn't happen again?      (His  mother does not like me at all)      I just worry that this little pup is going to have a bad fate      What can be done?

I asked this question before and got an answer saying it would be fine that was helpful but I am just checking!
20090305093659AAcZkCc	Pets;Dogs	What should I do with my dogs?	I'm closing on a new house 3/25 but not taking possession until 4/30.  I have 36 days of "homelessness" to contend with.  Which of these options would you do?      1-Stay with mom and board the dogs.  Con - it will cost 1,100-1,500 bucks to board that long and I don't have that kind of money right now, let alone mom and I not trying to kill each other.  Pro - I would be rent free and I'd be well fed.      2-Stay at my boyfriends for 100/week to put me, 2 dogs and my cat up.  Con - he's very anti dog and I'm afraid if one of them destroys something or messes in the house, it would hurt our relationship.  Pro - It's cheaper than boarding and he's not my mother.      3-Stay with friends who have 2 dogs, 2 toddlers and have to sleep on the floor.  Con - I'm too old to sleep on the floor and I think it would be very crazy there with 4 dogs and 2 toddlers and have to pay 600/month.  Pro - they are dog people and have a fence.         So, help me decide which route I should take to not burn any bridges or traumatize my dogs.

Hi my friends dog has been throwing up yesterday and the night before, he only brought up water/spit and that's it, he seems to have gone off food and water altogether for the past day and a half to 2. He looks down in the dumps not his energetic self and has quite bad breathe. All he wants to do is lay down and relax and not do anything.       Has anyone been or are going through this that has an idea on whats happening and why?       Could it be his diet??       Eaten something that may have poisoned him?      All answers will be grateful.      Thanks for taking time in reading this question and answering it.       Thanks

He is a hyper year old lab, and doesn't like to listen when he is called. He will usually run away. I asked a question earlier about this and someone had recommended whistle training. I have also saw this on "It's me or the dog." Has anyone else ever done this? I'd really like to try it and see how he does with it. I know how to do it, I just wanted some feedback from people that have done it as well. Was it successful for your dog?        Thanks!

Nothing makes me happier than to hear them all start cackling once one of the girls have laid an egg.

20090305100010AABZd8V	Pets;Birds	Question about two love birds.?	We just got 2 black masked love birds. I set them up a big cage with all kinds of toys and treats. we have had them for about 5 days now.  Most of the time, they are very quiet with a few squaks here and there,   except when i have the radio on, or the tv,  then they dont seem to want to stop "talking"    as soon as i shut the sound off, they are quiet again.   Is the noise annoying them  or do they just like it?        Also,  if they are squawking  and i walk into the room, they shut up, and when i go over to softly talk to them, they turn their backs to me.    Are they still just getting use to me?  are they still scared?    I know not to handle them for at least a week , and i havnt , except for one time,   somehow  1 of them found their way out of the cage, hes an escape artist  lol   and i had to pick him up to put him back in, ( of course i for bit)   but other than that they havnt been handled.      anything else i should know about caring for these 2 would be greatly appreciated.       I have the right food for them, and i give them veggies and fruit, and i do cover them at night so they get enoug rest, so they wont be "cranky"  lol

20090305093137AArPBLY	Pets;Dogs	Any ideas on pregnant *****?	Right before i start i DONOT require insults, im just looking for any reasonable idea, i am a registered breeder of the UK KC (although this is only my 3rd litter), YES my ***** is heart tested, YES both the sire and dam are championship qualified (so both up to breed standard) this litter has been well planned and temperament and looks taken into consideration. I feel i have to say this as idiots just send me insults and tell me im a back yard breeder otherwise.   I have a pregnant boxer who is 66 days post 1st mating and 64 days post 2nd, it is her 1st litter (its not mine but ive never had a ***** go over). Me and my stud breeder who is very experienced are out of ideas on this matter.   I just would like to know if anyone has had a ***** gone over and they have done something which has started labour, my girl is at the vets tmw as they want to do a c section either tmw or sat. Obviously this is a fairly big operation that i would like to avoid not because of cost but for the well being of my dog and pups (money is no object on this litter i have put plenty aside for emergencies) so if anyone has any tips or ideas of how to bring a dog in someone suggested going for a drive that didnt work.   Shes very well in herself still active and playing, eating, drinking, sociable. She has had a few signs nesting etc but nothing definate, milk appeared 2 days ago. The pups are still very active seemed to calm down yesterday but are wide awake again today. Im willing to try anything sensible to avoid the operation.

He does this maybe once a week but he does it enough that his tail used to be really puffy and now the part closest to his back and his back has barely any fur. It looks really funny. I try correcting him when I think he's about to do it but he still continues to do it even when I'm not home.  Any tips on how to make him stop doing this?
20090305100337AAZUVKa	Pets;Dogs	My dog went to the vet yesterday...?	The thing I asked about before... his eyes are just from allergies. And the thing on the back of is neck, he got bitten by something and scratched it too hard, making a cut..then probably step in something and scratched the cut, causing bacteria to get in and what not.. By the way.. I found it like 2 days ago! So all that "have you ever hear of a vet?!" crap was unnecessary!       ANYWAY! So..he has a cone on now so he wont scratch his eyes anymore..but he cant drink from his water bowl..it just spills over. And he wont let me use a syringe to let him drink. I dont know what to do to allow him to get to his bowl..the cone blocks everything! lol

Hi, i have a puppy who i have loads of time to spend with. when she gets scared she will run to me, when she wants something she will come to me and when she wants to play she will come to me. she is an extreamly hyper dog and being a puppy sometimes its real hard to calm her down and its like crazy half hour! out of me, and my mom, its only me who gets through right away. my mom will sound to me calm and assertive but to the dog i guess she is just another noise. its hard for my mom to settle her, or to tell her a command etc like if she jumps up at my mom, then mom says 'down' but the puppy won't until she's said it at the least 3 times! with me, i say 'down' and shes down. i dunno if this is because i have spent most pof my time with the puppy, more than my mom, or if its our energies. also, it was me who wanted a dog, my mom never really liked them but she said i could have one and she'd try and make an effort which she really does! so can you tell me any ideas - is it just that im a doggie person and my moms not, because she will listen to my granda who isnt too much of a doggie person but he does get along with all animals. also when my gran died, i was really heartbroken because we were so close and i believe that my gran has chosen this dog because she is the perfect dog for me and i feel like she carries my grans spirit. if you make a nasty comment about that then i will report you because im being real open here and only my mom and grandad know about this so....you know, just be nice about it yeah? thanks.

20090305102049AAtYz30	Pets;Dogs	Is it normal for a dog to have a comfort blanket and suck on it like its a pacifier?	My one year old toy poodle, Simba, has a blanket.  He knows this blanket is his and won't let anyone grab it without him trying to take it back.  He does not chew on the blanket but he does something very interesting:  Almost every night around 7 or 8 PM Simba grabs the blanket and takes it into any one room where most people from my house are in (ie living room or bedroom).  He grabs a part of the blanket and twists it so that he can lay down with a small part of it in his mouth while he hold the rest of it with his two front paws and never falls asleep.  He looks like a small child with his security blanket.  He does this for long periods of time (around one to two hours).  We try to distract him sometimes because we worry about him but all he wants to do is be with his blanket.  My question is - is this normal?

20090227071020AAvJ4Bf	Pets;Dogs	Is my puppy sleeping enough?	We wake up at 7:30 AM and she is awake for about 2 hours. Then she'll sleep for another 2 hours or so. After that nap she'll be up for the rest of the day, with maybe one or two 30 minute naps in the afternoon. She goes to sleep at about 10:00 PM. She is 4 months old and I was hoping she'd sleep more... lol. And sometimes when she has been awake for a long time she'll start barking at me. Does that mean she is tired? She has her own bed but I let her sleep in mine at night, and so far she sleeps through the night with me. I try to walk her a lot (which doesn't work so well right now - she will refuse to walk for treats, toys or praise and giving her a slight tug does nothing but make her pull back more.) It's also hard to keep her attention on her toys to make her more tired.. she usually gets bored very quickly and will start to chew the wrong things. I have many toys for her and I don't give them to her all at once. Is this all normal?

Do you we have any other rodentists out there? :D Our ratties love sticking their heads in our mouths and cleaning our teeth! How about some mega-groomers? Flower loves to stick her nose in my husband's hair and pick out all the dandruff. <3 I'm curious what others' rattie habits are! :)

20090227071214AAGkz64	Pets;Cats	My Kitten just got fixed.. why is the other kitten hissing at her?	I've had these two kittens for about six months now. We got the male fixed about 2 months ago but the female was too small. She recently went into heat (at a very young age). We went and got her fixed yesterday... Since she got home last night our male cat has been hiding under our bed. Now today the male kitten who is already fixed keeps hissing at her today. Not like he wants to fight her.. because they still sit next to each other and eat together he just hisses once she comes by. Also a little background he was much more "loving" to us when she was gone. Does he not like her here? they had always been very close (snuggling etc) before yesterday
