Watching the U-20 World Cup I have seen incredible acts by players who are diving to draw fouls all over the place. It came to a head in the Canada-Chile match today when a Chilean player collided with a Canadian. He fell to the ground and appeared to be in agony to such a point that he was taken off on a stretcher. Less than 3 minutes later he was up, fine and wanted back into the game. What is up with football these days?

Alot of people I think would be to send Dave Bush down to the minors, but recently he has been pitching a lot better, and earlier wasn't pitching terrible, just was a victim of some bad luck. I don't think he deserves to be demoted.      Personally, I think Gallardo should go back down to the minors to continue to improve and will act as a safety net in case of another injury.

They also took arts from different schools (rumors).  Another bad experience was a martial art school that taught ninjitsu, they were so bad they made my last school look very good. So all these bad martial art schools destroyed my hope of finding a good one. Is it to late for me to get back into martial arts at my age?

20081106074627AAJyk96	Sports;Fantasy Sports	Who to start at QB this week?	I start 2 QB's in a 12 team league. Brees is one, and for the other, I can choose between Garcia (Bye), Collins(vs. Bears), or Rosenfels (Ravens).       I'm leaning towards Collins right now - the Bears are 30th vs the pass and weaker on defense. Of course, the Titans passing attack is pitiful, so that doesn't help his case.       The Texans passing attack has been potent recently, and Owen Daniels and Andre Johnson are great weapons, but the Ravens are a great D (4th against the pass, 6th in points), but have given up pretty big days recently (vs colts, Dolphins, and even the Browns put up 200 yards and 27 points on them last week). Rosenfels would typically be the better play, but a turnover machine going against the Ravens scares me, but at the same time, he could put up good numbers if he gets a few big plays to Johnson...      What do you think?      PS - Scoring is as follows:   Passing Yards (25 yards per point)   Passing Touchdowns (5)   Interceptions (-2)

20081112024452AAfK5Wb	Sports;Fantasy Sports	Help! Favre v Quinn? Two of Jones, Hightower, Johnson?	Who should I start out of Brady and Brett?      I like Quinn's short under game at Buffalo (especially as I have Winslow) - can't see too many interceptions, but maybe not huge yardage. I can see the opposite with Favre, gunslinging downfield for a lot of yards but a few picks, especially if the Pats shut down Thomas Jones.      Which leads into question two - who should I start from Thomas Jones, Tim Hightower and Larry Johnson?      Jones has been a stud but I'm not sure I like him in New England, only Ronnie Brown has really burned them on the ground this year, Hightower I like for goal-line touches but with Warner in the form of his life it looks like they will go to the air even more down the stretch, and Johnson is just a huge question mark with Thigpen playing well, but it's a great match-up with the Saints and I just have this feeling he might come out with something to prove...      Any advice much appreciated, thanks for taking the time to read.      Will
