If you mean most productive then there are tons of other species out there that are more productive and if you mean superior as in how well built the physical body is then anything that has an exoskeleton is better than us.<br>  <br>  It all depends on what you mean by Superior.|`|CNy6yLZvaa	I'm thinking that if civilization were to collapse the greatest immediate threat to humans would be packs of wild dogs.  Does that make them superior?  I don't think so.  What would it take to be FAR superior? well, I think ants are pretty successful.  So are some squid.  And good luck wiping out bacteria.  But I think humans are always going to be partial to judging themselves as superior to all other species.  So I'll say "no".|`|cl4wdRnvaa	I say Pan Paniscus, The Bonobo Chimpanzee are superior. If I were them, I would be embarrassed to be relate to us (Humans/ Homo Sapiens) and The Pan Troglodytes (Common Chimpanzees).

I think teens are wrapped so tightly and try to fit in with their peers that they keep their real selves hidden so as to fit in with the crowd.  <br>  <br>  Alcohol lowers their threshold for holding their real self back and the real self comes out.  The next day friends think you were just drunk, when in reality the real self came out and that is who they are seeing.  Therefore, it allows you to be yourself without rejection as people just think that you were drunk.<br>  <br>  Also, they use it to escape the pressures of being a teen: academic pressure, parental pressure, peer pressure, as they don't really know who they are yet but have all this pressure to be someone.|`|AA10372530	I personally think one of the main reasons is that most of them are programmed to be open in the sense that they are very receptive to outer circumstances and very connected to them, so they are (maybe subconsciously) motivated to experience various sensations and events. They're too "connected" to external influences, which reduces their control and level of awareness.|`|6kBAj12gaa	I think a lot of it comes down to peer pressure and the desperation to be accepted by "the cool kids" so anything about peer pressure and even rebellion would probably give you quite a bit of into <br>  <br>  : )|`|1sOWpQR2aa	I think its one because they get addicted to the things that happen when under the influence of alcohol.

0rpN2419aa	I never found anyone really repulsive, but this guy in high school liked me and would kind of follow me around at the school dance if I didn't have a date, and I wasn't interested, so would walk around to the other side of the gymnasium.  I didn't know what to do.  Now I feel bad that  was rude, but it is difficult when some one really likes you that you are not interested in.  I feel bad now that I am older, about the way I acted in high school   I am no better than anyone else, we just have different interests.  Most of them are really nice people, but if we have differences that is the way it is.  I hope you aren't really thinking  people are repulsive, but you just have differences in what you like and don't like.  We can be such jerks when we are or were in high school.  I was at times, and I hate to admit it.  As we grow older we have more of a tendency to treat people the way we want to be treated. It is better not to think of people as repulsive.  If they are really screwed up on drugs and a bad life style, it is okay not to like their lifestyle.  If everyone treated people as repulsive, it wouldn't be a very happy world, and sadly those who are thought of as repulsive end up being the ones that do bad things because they have a poor self image.  It is okay to be friendly to people without getting into being concerned that you are better than them.  No, you aren't being narcissistic, but you might have an ego problem and I hope you aren't putting yourself on a pedestal.|`|AA10389562	Sounds like it is you who is repulsed by YOU.  Low self esteem and believing you are not worthy of a nice guy's affection may cause you to see your own perceived failings in others.|`|517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	You probably have low self-esteem and are afraid that you can't sustain a meaningful relationship. So you play it safe. You avoid relationships and justify it by over-inflating your self-esteem and look for faults in others.  <br>  <br>  And as for hot guys, you'll have to compete with other girls for them, which means that there's a good chance you might not be the guy's pick. <br>  <br>  Either way, you're not in a relationship -- you're safe.|`|UtYOwE4Laa	You have low self esteem and believe that nobody should like you, so much to the point that you don't like the kind of person who would like a person like you.|`|rYg3SOFpaa	just because they like you, doesn't mean you have to like them<br>  ur repulesd because it's in your nature, cause you know you will have some ugly *** kids if you have sex with this this guy... there is nothing wrong with you|`|7Q7dFghmaa	You are so full of yourself.<br>  <br>  <br>  Eat Funyuns.|`|BRmdwyzsaa	It's in your genes.  As we have evolved as humans women have developed a need for a male that will protect her and who will have good DNA that will ensure the survival of her offspring.  This means that you instictually want someone withh a lot of self worth.  When a guy says he likes you and acts like a nice guy then he is basically saying you are better than him.  This does not show worth from your opinion.  You are most likely more attracted to guys who don't give you the time of the day because that is a sign that they are stronger and better than you and therefore have good survival DNA.|`|uLHtXibRaa	No..you are not a narcissist....i think that you need to search deep down inside you and find out what it is you really dont like about yourself here...and i do not mean that as an insult..there is something preventing you from liking yourself and thats why you are angry with boys..you are unsure how to deal with the fact they find you attractive and so it scares you.. you really need to be honest with yourself..its easy to hide behind a wall of closed confusion because we do not want to face the problem is so deep we have to search ourselves to face ourselves..this is very natural and the mind has a habit of pushing traumatic information into a kind of vault which seeps posion forcing us to deal with it in the end.. you are angry with the fact they find you attractive because theres a deep rooted reason for you to dislike yourself throuoghly the fact that they find you attractive you find a threat..and its making you feel you cannot hide anymore from facing your emotional state..   ...this is probably due to some kind of injustice done to you by a male you trusted even a family member in the past and you are dealing subconcioussly with the anger and hurt this way.. by rejecting them you are rejecting your womanhood because you fear it...thru yor past trauma.Once you reconise what this injustice is, how is affecting you you can gain positive proffesional steps to regain your confidence and mentally medicate yourself thru discussion and counselling.. learning to like and understand yourself and accept that you have something that will always attract the opposite sex , learning to appreciate it and view it wisely and psoitivley.Hope this helps.|`|bGyVJ6meaa	i'm not sure if you know what a narcissist is.<br>  <br>  Certainly not someone who'd come onto Yahoo!!! answers, worried they might be a narcissist.<br>  <br>  You probably have some deep seated insecurity issues, assuming that for someone to like you must in turn have something wrong with themselves.|`|O9HLoDj9aa	I agree with several of these answers. There's several possibilities.

You could think that you do not have any good qualities and be insecure about your own attractiveness.  Therefore you would think that any guy who thought you were attractive was obviously mistaken and had something wrong with him to make him think like that.  <br>  <br>  You should think about the kinds of things that you find wrong with the guys that like you, and see if those are actually displaced feelings of dissatisfaction with yourself.  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps a bit.|`|z0B0fyT6aa	No, i think you probably like the badboys, or the ones who you have to work towards getting them to like you. The one guy who I dated who I felt like I pursued, I thought he was amazing and so cool the whole time, whereas every other guy I have dated who treats me like a queen, I get sick of them or find flaws in the fact that they like me too much or show it too much? i don't know.. I don't think youre crazy|`|CLFwZ3MBaa	nah your standards are very high, i think u have made something out of your self like a great job or worked very hard to be where you are. and you dont want guys just to approach u for your looks but for your brains , also you want a guy who is kind of perfect like hard working good looking family guy etc.. ( sorry i am married already  ;-) ) , so you raise your standards very high. and guys dont come to those expectations.|`|1sOWpQR2aa	Nah. You just like a challenge.

DsEEATKSaa	Sex: modeling, "massage therapy", advertising, writers<br>  <br>  Aggression: boxing, sports, etc<br>  <br>  ~Dr. B.~|`|AA10372530	A socially acceptable expression of the aggressive side can be seen in sports - as a way of constructively channeling the assertive tendencies. In this case the tendencies are expressed in a way that seems tolerable and acceptable because it's required by the situation. They're utilized in a way that is seen as useful and so they blend with the pattern, their essence becoming imperceptible, but in a different context where they would be expressed individually, they would be seen in a different light.<br>  <br>  As for the sexual side, it's usually expressed in the same way through the media, publicity and such. When taken into consideration as individual elements, sexuality and aggression in their natural form are not exactly socially acceptable so the key is to attach them to other patterns or factors that can alter their purpose if only superficially. The essence of the tendencies is the same, it's just adjusted.
VgPG5WMsaa	Yes. Huck Finn. And by the way, I see young girls wearing sandals in the summer with their jeans rolled up below their knees. The only thing they lack is a straw hat and a corncob pipe!|`|NAGiNKFWaa	Yes, they did when I was a child.  Often times clothes were handed down from siblings or cousins so pant legs might be too long at first, so boys and girls rolled them up until they grew into them.|`|rrp9c2tnaa	Yes, boys in rural areas often did.  There were many reasons, some of which would be the mud of the dirt roads and fields, the stickers and cockleburs that grow in rural areas, and also the fit -- hand-me-downs were a way of life for the poor, and you couldn't tell if they were too short if they were rolled up.  Especially in the 1800's to mid-1900's, the time period that you mention, poorer rural boys often only had one pair of shoes that they could wear to church and school.  Otherwise, they had to go barefoot.

AcgDcQG0aa	I don't think that's likely to happen.  <br>  <br>  Because the US dollar in an international currency that many other countries use for international investment and trade besides USA.  USA also has borrowed a lot of money from foreigners by selling them US government bonds. <br>  <br>  Which means that an official devaluation of the US dollar would be similar to a default by USA on a significant part of its foreign debt.  And such devaluation would also disrupt a lot of international trade and investment.<br>  <br>  It would create more problems than it solves.  And for this reason it's unlikely to happen.|`|2XJmReP6aa	Our current economic issues are testing novices and experts alike in many ways. I think we need to be cautious in our assumptions since so much of what we are dealing with right now has not been seen before within our modern economic system. If any person suggests that they know for certain what is going to happen in the future given current world events, I would be cautious about their advice.<br>  <br>  During unusual times like these, I prefer to look at “broad-brush” ways of thinking instead of focusing on specificities. In other words, staying close to the trunk of the tree is a more stable area than way out on the branches. <br>  <br>  On Friday of last week (Feb. 13), I believe the most important news of this year was announced to little or no fanfare. I have included a link below from the original Bloomberg article entitled “China Needs U.S. Guarantees For Treasuries, Yu Says”. Speaking on behalf of China, Central Bank Advisor Yu Yongding stated that China is requesting additional assurances and/or guarantees from the U.S. that their investments in dollar-denominated assets are safe as a prerequisite for more purchases. <br>  <br>  This news is enormous in its implications and yet very few people outside of chief economic circles understand how dangerous the potential impact of this type of threatened economic behavior could be to our western civilization. <br>  <br>  Again, describing this with a “broad-brush”, the U.S. has allowed insignificant trade restrictions and tariffs on Chinese goods. This allows China to sell their products to the U.S. at a much lower price. The result over the last 20 years has been a dramatic escalation in the amount of Chinese goods sold in our country. In return for this major economic concession, China is “required” to invest a certain percentage of its U.S. Dollar wealth from the sale of these goods to purchase back U.S. Government treasuries and other debt instruments. Everything works fine with this “sweetheart relationship” as long as the U.S. Dollar remains strong; thereby China receives a currency of strong value that measures well against all other currencies. <br>  <br>  But what happens when too many artificially created U.S. Dollars are poured into our economic system? (Think TARP/Stimulus Bill). This creates a classic case of inflation with too many dollars without any fixed support (like precious metals or energy). When these policies continue, governments get caught in a spiraling escalation of inflation that cannot be managed without forcing depression in order to dramatically curtail the creation of these artificially created fiat (no-backing) dollars. <br>  <br>  The last time a major western nation realized such an event was in the early 1930s. Germany, then under a pre-Hitler regime, was forced to repay a massive amount of debt created from an agreement with the U.S. and European countries emanating out of Germany’s culpability for being the catalyst of World War 1. Germany agreed to pay a large sum of money to other nations because of the damage created. Germany found themselves unable to pay this debt without creating a large number of German Marks via the printing press. While this gave them the cash they needed to pay their debt obligations, it also dumped an enormous amount of currency on the world economic market. The result of this irresponsible behavior, while temporarily solving their debt problem, caused a runaway inflationary cycle to begin. You have read stories about German workers getting paid twice per day so they could buy goods during the middle of the day before the prices would go up by the end of the day. In the end, stories of people taking wheelbarrows full of German currency to the markets for a loaf of bread were everywhere. <br>  <br>  Today we don’t have to run the printing pre

As therapist empathy accounts for 67% of the variability in your data, it shows it is a good predictor.<br>  <br>  But it also shows that a third of the variance is not accounted for by therapist empathy, suggesting that other factors influence patient outcome, maybe something like patient motivation.

jiMAtaCraa	A prodigy is a child who has talent in a certain field on the level of highly-trained adults. Typically speaking, prodigies are noticed before the age of 13 - usually in the realms of Literature, Mathematics, Sciences and Arts. Given, it is ultimately possible to conclude that much prodigies are prodigies due to certain 'anomalies' in their genetics that differentiate them from the large majority of the human populace.<br>  <br>  I would not classify a 19 year old who is extremely intellectual as being a "prodigy". Although some do in fact say that adolescence in its actuality stops at 21, mainstream scientists point to the fact that much of the major processes that goes on in the body virtually comes to a halt at around 16 thereabouts. That is why classical IQ tests use the divisor of 16, as it is believed that it is much easier to ascertain the reasoning ability of someone after the age of 16 due to stoppage in major developments occurring in the body. Being extremely intellectual at 19 means just that - being extremely intellectual. I could study, if I wished, on the realms of the quantum mechanics and topology to the realms of "expert level", and I'm 16. Would that make me a prodigy? No. The choice to learn quantum mechanics and topology was a deliberate one; prodigies seem to have no choice but to succumb to their natural abilities.|`|AA11632160	you are not a child at 19|`|5O7op0oIaa	Given your spelling and grammar, I wouldn't worry too much about it.|`|yPncyjK1aa	I think the term for an intellectual 19 year old would be a 'geek'.|`|AA11261867	You are not a prodigy.

BNhLWBEqaa	The males talk about sex often and they are don`t shy when they talk about it, sometimes they tend to lie a little about their sexual experiences<br>  The females talk about sex too, but they talk about sex in different way : they talk about it with feeling, or either just with diplomacy, because is very rare that type of girl who tells you how was her boyfriend jerking off ( <- 4example )<br>  So, both talk about sex, just in different ways|`|FSpL3s1raa	I am female.<br>  <br>  I think that both males and females talk about sex to their friends. These days, I would even say that the words used are just as explicit and detailed when females talk about sex with their friends as when males do.  However, I think there is still a difference in the way males and females feel about sex when they're talking about it.  For example, a male sharing a story about a sexual experience he had is likely to feel proud of it, while a female sharing a similar story is more likely to feel ashamed, embarrassed, or to view the event as a mistake.|`|u89DpTmwaa	I am male and have both male and female friends.  This question is to broad and generalized to give an accurate answer.  Both males and females talk about sex to their friends.  But then there are both males and females who don't.  It depends on the age group, level of maturity, family upbringing, religious beliefs, and a multitude of additional variants.  I think you should limit it to your perspective because that is the only one that could be accurate.|`|24cec6e3d7aec8df481a24425e55b214aa	i think you should also consider emotional maturity in your essay. i'm female, in my 20s. I wouldn't say I'm emotionally mature; perhaps almost devoid. I like having sex with good-looking guys and try to grasp at strands of a connection before I get bored and move on. <br>  <br>  I am in no way looking to settle down or get married; in fact, I think monogamy is unnatural and boring. <br>  <br>  Emotionally, I find it difficult to connect with people on a meaningful level. Having good sex alleviates this longing for a period of time as I feel intimate and close to someone even if I wouldn't feel that way when we weren't having sex. <br>  <br>  I often gloat about my exploits to my friends. I know it's not classy to, but it feeds my ego to know that I can get hot guys in bed and make them fall in love with me. <br>  <br>  You know what? I think i'm a narcissist.|`|L38sFy7waa	we men need sex!!! we cannot live or die without doing it, female are havemore control of their sexual desire, i see that sex is important in a relation but there must be the right time to do it, also i masturbate once a day and i dont say it to anybody is more than personal, unless, i show it to my friends lol well i dont do that by te way, sex is|`|jtNF9oLVaa	getting children
FL67UPPHaa	"What I'm trying to get at I guess, is that both sexes excel in different ways. We both have strengths and weaknesses, and we can both contribute to society in different ways."<br>  <br>  That pretty much sums up my views too.<br>  <br>  I believe men and women, in general, have naturally different abilities and interests. We're equally important for the functioning of society, and our roles complement each other.<br>  <br>  I think we should all have equal opportunities, but outcome will never be equal because men and women make different choices. Women should be allowed to do physical jobs only if they meet the requirements -- standards shouldn't be lowered for women. The average man will be stronger than a strong woman, and so of course sporting events shouldn't be mixed.  <br>  <br>  The idea that men and women are the same, or that gender differences are "socialised", is the main area in which I disagree with feminism. There's so much evidence against this; the brains of males and females are different from birth. Girls can't do everything boys can do, just as boys can't do everything girls can do. Two genders were made for a reason -- to support and complement each other.|`|Olz3goEaaa	I would guess that very few people are on about men vs women in sports. No one with half a brain thinks this or cares. There is an obvious difference. It's like me being jealous that I can't have a baby.<br>  <br>  If there is any real competition it's between who gets the best tv ratings and the most butts in the seats. There is where some real money is on the line.|`|mZVk3fP4aa	Men are stronger it's true. But that doesn't mean she should be discriminated against when it comes to job she CAN do. The differences have been exaggerated through history. Women haven't been given credit for much of anything through the ages.|`|521978f4254c4b8f2b7244300239e951aa	Good question.  Perhaps you're right, it's not always equal, and in my mind, it's not supposed to be.  If you're talking about sports, there are some sports that women absolutely could be better than men, and the competition is based on skill rather than physical strength.  And there are the exceptions -- women bodybuilders could give an average man a run for his money.<br>  <br>  It's important to know the difference between gender and sex.  Gender is social and sex is biological.  The issue of men and women getting paid equally for the same job is a gender issue, but the fact that women make better astronauts than men is because of the biology of their sex, not their social gender.<br>  <br>  Perhaps a woman wouldn't make a great linebacker on a male football team, but that doesn't mean she can't be president, or a surgeon, or a poker tournament winner.  There's biology, and then there's brains.  It's important to understand the difference.|`|1suTgWGoaa	When I go out to eat, I try to find the best,  NOT the Average one.<br>  <br>  When I want to read a book, I try to find the best,  NOT the Average one.<br>  <br>  When I go out to see a movie, I try to find the best,  NOT the Average one.<br>  <br>  Any thing I do, like every body else does, looks for the best,<br>  <br>  Where should I look regarding women, that I can find the BEST and NOT the average one?|`|15Uz3lO2aa	I am a feminist because I do believe men and women are equal and that we should have equal rights and opportunities. BUT when I say equal, I mean that women as a whole are stronger in some areas than men are, and vice versa, so really we are two different halves that together make a whole.<br>  <br>  To me, one quality or characteristic isn't "better" than the next. Just as I respect men in general for their superior mathematic capabilities, I demand respect for women in general for having superior language capabilities. These are just two examples of the ways that brains of men and women differ from the moment we are born. It's pure science. I also know that I have met many men that are superior to me in regards to language, and have met many men that I am superior to in regards to mathematics, but that's looking at two individuals, and not two genders. <br>  <br>  I believe that although we are equal, men and women can't do the same job and expect the same results, because we each excel in different areas. That's why we fall in love with each other, learn from each other, and need each other... because we compliment each other to create, together, a magnificent team that would be, literally, "half as good", if we went through life independently.|`|wkjncmHTaa	I've never said that I think women can/should compete in most sports against men. Women are generally physically smaller and weaker. It would be just as unfair for different boxing weights to compete against each other. <br>  <br>  I fail to see what this has to do with equal rights though.<br>  <br>  Edit: well, it seems daft to me that the average woman would be able to outrun/fight/etc. the average man. But I also think that women can and should be able to participate in all kinds of sports.|`|oVeGMNsLaa	To me, the biggest point here is that NOT ALL WOMEN ARE THE SAME.<br>  <br>  There are some skinny, lightweight boys out there who couldn't last a minute in a football game, for example, but nobody bars them from trying out for the team.<br>  <br>  There are a few big, strong girls who can seriously kick a**.  No, they do not represent the majority of women.  Nobody's trying to say they are.  But what we are trying to say is that not letting her compete with the guys just because she has a vagina is stupid.<br>  <br>  I don't mind segregated team sports, mind you.  It's not a problem for me, and I think that they SHOULD exist, so that the average girl can compete with those with similar levels of strength, size, etc..  But it would make me happy if a girl who wanted to play with the boys, and proved she could do so, was allowed to.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I've seen some women who are seriously more built than men.  Very rare, but to say that there is no woman who is an even match-up to a man, in the entire world, is more than a little ridiculous.
NworBT5saa	I don't believe it will. However, there is a chance that it becomes a fulfilling prophesy - because they have seen the dream, they will see a lot of situations that they believe is the situation in their dream. The fact that you dream something so many times just shows they are dwelling on the dream, which it turn causes it to be dreamt more.|`|5KkcnYqcaa	I don't know <br>  i wish it would come true<br>  i had the same dream for a few weeks, even though it was scary i liked it.<br>  It is probably from you think of it and it just comes back at night|`|0jlG2clBaa	yea,why not?<br>  dreams are real.<br>  so is hope,and belief in magic.|`|AA11447210	No. It may or may not.

Its all about selling sex, looking HOT, and using it to a fools advantage....GET REAL LADIES!!!!|`|483e49b9ba8ea322e76bb65dc8f82a66aa	I do agree, and I also think its true that nice people finish last, ALWAYS, but, I don't think it's fair. I have had a lot of people (usually older folks) tell me I am beautiful for years, but people my own age do not find me remotely pretty, I get hit on by 45-50 year old men, never 20 somethings like myself. Being "pretty" has never done anything for me though, I have worked in a younger peoples market and so like I said I am not considered hot or attractive in their way, I do feel I have been passed over to have a "hotter" person do the job though. Its also about confidence, if someone thinks they are attractive, they act like it, and they are confident in life, others see this as being capable and confident. "ugly" people tend to be more shy and reserved so bosses and the general public think they are less capable and confident. <br>  So in answer to your question, people should try to find themselves attractive as they are and then other people will find them so as well. Most people do not have the money for plastic surgery, if you do, you have already made it anyway, you got the job or you married the rich guy or you were born rich, so why bother? If you can afford it and really want to go through the pain, go ahead though, and by all means, dress and wear makeup to highlight the good about you and hide the flaws.|`|Uq026rA2aa	i don't think that surgery or any type of change in necessary to make an individual more beautiful.  yes society has made it as though woman can have a great deal of power if they look great but then again how much of it is confidence??  I think that as long as a woman knows how to carry herself and yea proper Hygiene, shower and all that she Will  be just fine and can have the type of power that you mentioned.  i do not believe that plastic surgery, constant make up touch ups, boob jobs, eye lifts etc. are necessary.<br>  <br>  at the end of the day the husband or boyfriend sees you without make up as you wash your face before bed. so i think as long as the woman is happy that is all that matters and that confidence that they have in themselves will take them a lot further then a make up brush will.|`|xdbc1cm8aa	This might sound cliche, but beauty is not really just a physical thing. I (as well as you more than likely) have seen alot of cases where a person's physical features aren't exactly stunning but because of their whole personality, the way they carry themselves, the joy they give off to other people, their smiles, they end up looking more beautiful than another person with more 'beautiful looking physical features'. <br>  Looking beautiful has more to do with your confidence and sharing a softness and warmth with other people. No matter how  'physically beautiful' someone might look, if they have a nasty personality and soul it somehow etches itself on their face and demeanor and they will end up looking less beautiful than a person whose physical features are not exactly eye catching but whose internal beauty glows, overpowers  and makes up for their physical imperfections|`|0d183ab8af4fe4c2164d74294bd981adaa	Thats not a womans fault, its a mans fault because its the man that puts the value on looks above anything else.

You can either go with t and take advantage of it, or you can reject it and accept any possible consequences you may face for it.<br>  <br>  I don't think it's fair or great, but I accept it just *is* and I rape the hell out of the fact that looks matter. Milk it for all its worth. <br>  <br>  Whether people agree or disagree doesn't much matter to me, really. If it works, it works =o)|`|oVeGMNsLaa	I guess I see what you're saying, but I believe that modern technology can turn almost any woman OR man into a stunner . . . as a less-than-conventionally-attractive woman myself, I would rather than value wasn't so attached to looks, for women or for men.<br>  <br>  Moreover, beauty is fleeting.  Who wants to be told that they are valued, so long as they are young?  That's how you get women like Joan Rivers, who have been stretched so much in an attempt to stay beautiful.|`|uXqDYPNVaa	Why would I be happy about that? It would mean that my genes, not something I made a concerted effort to do, are responsible for my success. If I can't have advantages in life because I actually did something to earn them, I don't want them.|`|V1MptCMiaa	No, eventually everyone gets older and if all your had was your physical attractiveness and a b*tchy attitude, I would guess you're just gonna end up alone.  But yeah, I think women do feel that extra pressure to look perfect thanks to society.|`|5c907c92a6c7447ccb431133ac7208abaa	Looks fade, and some of us respect ourselves as we are and don't need to change our looks to feel better about ourselves (excluding ppl who have been in car accidents, ill etc). Unfortunately, many women, young and old, and now some men, are convinced by their family, society, friends or the media that they must spend money and endanger their health to look good or look better. I think it is very sad, that our society encourages something so shallow that ppl are willing to starve themselves and risk their lives to attain or keep beauty. Yes, it can open doors for you, but at what cost? I value my self-respect and have decided I can live without being perfect, like some of society thinks I should be.|`|jk0rAkEjaa	Actually, I think they are happy. Women in 2009 welcome objectification and we see it in all aspects of life. I personally believe that it is over done and has started to trickle down to age groups who are not prepared to deal with it.|`|LR48Rtv2aa	"Should women be happy that so much of their value is attached to their looks?"<br>  <br>  No one should be anything they don't have to be.|`|P1VXjLPOaa	I don't know if I would use the word "valued". I would agree that beautiful women are desired.|`|RQWyYV6Laa	Hehe....good question by the way!|`|9YlQ5HEhaa	I'm going to get thumbs down for this...but I agree.<br>  <br>  In order to get what you want, you use all the tools at your disposal and if looking good helps with your goals, that's just the way the world works. I have no shame about this - I think if I'm looking good, I get much better reactions from everyone.<br>  <br>  I've never understood why anyone would think being ugly made them a better person... <br>  <br>  Inner beauty may be more important, but that doesn't mean that outer beauty isn't important too, to a variable extent.|`|SLSX6QQsaa	No, I am not happy that so much of my value is attached to my looks.  I am 5'8" and I have always worn no bigger than a size 4.  That is, until my 26th birthday.  Now I am 27 and I wear a size 8.  I am tall, size 8 isn't fat, but its not model thin like I was.  I am sick of people who I haven't seen in a while making comments about how I look.  It should be acceptable to be a healthy size (not fat, at all!) and not have to worry about eating boring salads and bananas for breakfast to make sure I don't get fat.  I refuse to live like that but still somehow I feel some guilt when I go to eat a cheeseburger or taco.  Even though I try to block out those ideas its still there in my mind. Very annoying.  People always expect me to walk around like a living Barbie doll (or Kendall in my case lol) and I just can't stand to limit myself to be that way.  Oh well, I guess we're gonna see a curvvvvy Kendall then lol|`|ZYp1AEspaa	Making an effort to look good is a socially accepted form of consideration for others and reflects healthy self-esteem. On the other hand, trying to look like someone you're not is a recipe for downward-spiralling, narcissistic disaster. <br>  <br>  Congratulations on the rethink. Top marks for openness! <br>  <br>  But since we are naturally attracted to beauty, the issue probably won't go away any time soon. I think the key is to have enough else in your head that you will survive such aesthetic challenges as ageing, illness or accident, and to possess (cliché alert) Inner Beauty, which comes from kindness, openmindedness and purposefulness.<br>  <br>  The reason I think the original question is less than great is that it suggests that women, and only women, should be happy to be judged on their appearance and should turn this to their advantage. Most of us try not to be in a war all the time. Life is full enough.|`|un0C52G8aa	I don't think so. That's because most women don't fit the current narrow ideal for feminine beauty and not only that but standards for beauty keep changing over the years. There's nothing wrong with trying to look as good as you can but I see some of these older entertainers trying to look younger and they end up looking like freaks in the process. I am so sick of seeing cheek implants, crooked puffy lips, faces stretched so tightly that the person can no longer make facial expressions, and eyebrows that have been pulled so high that the person looks perpetually surprised.

tsq5P9pzaa	As a person who's had hundreds of creepy and nightmarish dreams, I'll have to say that the reason you had this dream is because of freaked out you've been over the Grudge. Every once in a while I'll have a strange movie related dream because I was either thinking about it as I was laying down to sleep or because I had just recently seen it. Not only that, but depending on if you ate something before going to sleep that could also affect your dreams. For example, if you drank milk or had hot sauce on something, that would stimulate certain chemicals in the brain and could possibly cause you to have a strange dream. I wouldn't be too worried about it though. You just have to stop thinking about the Grudge so much. Its a scary movie but, its just that, a movie.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped :]|`|eArLd5taaa	WoW...that does sound creepy...<br>  <br>  <br>  But I think that it was all just because of the horror flick you watched...AND because you keep thinking about it and being scared...I guess it all sort of like...came back at you in a dream...I guess...<br>  <br>  Just stop thinking about the grudge and think about other things...and most importantly...keep yourself busy...to get your mind off of those horror thoughts...|`|145911b5154c5d91455135bf422cd573aa	I have had a similar dream, but in my dream my parents were not acting like themselves. The only explanation I could come up with was a doppelganger, someone who looks just like you.<br>  <br>  From dreammoods.com: "To see your own double in your dream, suggests that you are attempting to recapture the past and the good old times. Alternatively, the dream may indicate that you are needlessly working twice as hard or doing double duty." and "To see yourself in your dream, is a reflection of how you act and behave in your waking life." For the mention of the sink, "To dream that you are washing your face and/or hands in a wash bowl, signifies that you will be consumed with passion for someone close to you." For the sight of your mother, "To see your mother in your dream, represents the nurturing aspect of your own character. Mothers offer shelter, comfort, life, guidance and protection. Some people may have problems freeing themselves from their mothers and are thus seeking their own individuality and development."<br>  <br>  It seems to me that, if you have had some trouble that you and your mother disagree on, you want to fix that problem and your relationship with her, the way you two used to be like. This desire to change could stem from your own personality. Perhaps, as you were looking at yourself, you consider yourself as both an actor on the stage of the world and as on observer in the audience. Maybe you are uneasy with how you are acting around your mother.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry if I assumed wrong, but, from each element, it seemed the most likely interpretation.|`|RRJFI9Oqaa	Dreams are dreams.<br>  Sleeping brain is very much playful.<br>  Do not catch in it.|`|s0VqdZsxaa	Attic <br>  To see an attic in your dream, represents hidden memories or repressed thoughts that is being revealed. It also symbolize your mind, spirituality, and your connection to the higher Self. Alternatively, it signifies difficulties in your life that will hinder you from attaining your goals and aspirations. However, in the end, after a long period of struggle, you will overcome them. <br>  <br>  To see a cluttered attic, is a sign to organize your mind and thoughts. Perhaps you need to rid yourself of the past and let go of the past emotions that are holding you back.

If you were to kill yourself as soon as someone leaves you then it doesn't speak highly of your character, what would the other person think? I think they would be surprised and dismayed at your selfish actions.|`|517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	Life changes, new options open up, new people enter your life, and you can make new choices. Suicide's permanent, you would have sold yourself short. <br>  <br>  I also agree with LIPPS above.|`|iz03uvV4aa	I dont understand this question entirely but...if I take it literally though....the obvious answer would be that the bad part is losing a life as a result of it.  Very sad.  Suicide is not only hurtful to the person engaging in this "solution" but it hurts so many others around them - friends, family etc.  It's a selfish way out.  It causes so much more greif than someone engaging in it thinks.  Its unfortunate how many are so in the dark and who think of this option.  Its unfortunate that they dont know how much they are loved, appretiated and how beautiful they are.  <br>  <br>  EDIT**<br>  It's very different then dying in a car crash....so much more than you know.  Suicide is a deliberate attempt to lock out (for good) all the people who DO love and care about you.  A car crash is an accident - sad but not intentional way out.  If this is something you are personally struggling with, I hope you find it inside to talk with someone about it and find how beautiful and worthy you are to stay here with the people who care and love you.|`|BNhLWBEqaa	You leave behind yourself, because this life is given to you for growing your soul, gaining experience and find for why have been you living<br>  If you throw your life away, that mean that you are too damn scared of it, so you can`t continue, but this kind of people suck !<br>  I`m sorry that I`m so straight with you, but open your eyes : live your life, don`t search your hell, because don`t think that you will get to a better place if you commit suicide <<- Don`t expect something for nothing|`|eyKx05LKaa	Well for one it's hurts the people left behind.  I think that is pretty bad!!!!!<br>  <br>  LIPPS - Very well said.<br>  <br>  Ok you have admitted there are people that care about you, so you know that you will be hurting people if you do this.  And you will hurt people, I know I had a friend take her life.  Stop being so selfish.  I'm sorry to hear that you are hurting over this girl, but think of how this hurt feels.  You will inflict that same hurt on other people, the people that care about you.  Nobody is worth killing yourself over.  Furthermore, these people that DO care about you, maybe you should start doing a little caring in return!!!!!|`|1c8b3f1b010227dade0229a14ba8bd73aa	Who cares about YOU.....it's about who you leave behind jack*ss!!!|`|AC0yjVJjaa	Trust me, you let your loved ones down.

Some interesting experiments run behind the "Iron Curtain" during the "cold war" have proved that it is also a receiver.<br>  Two men in labs in different cities several hundred miles apart were hooked up to EEG machines at the same time.  Subject A was told to look at an image on a piece of paper and "send" it to subject B.<br>  Subject B did NOT consciously "get" the image that was sent - but during the precise interval of time when it was being "sent", BOTH men registered the EXACT SAME brainwave pattern on their EEGs!<br>  THIS is clear evidence that the message really DID get through - but ONLY as far as subject B's SUBCONSCIOUS.  It never did come all the way through to his conscious awareness.<br>  <br>  As with ANY paired-up sending and receiving devices, the sending station and receiving station must be "tuned" to the same frequency for the transmission to be "picked up".  The further apart their frequencies, the weaker the signal and the less likelihood of its being received.<br>  <br>  Each human being has his/her own bandwidth (range through which the individual's frequency varies).  No two of us have exactly the same frequency range.  Some of our bandwidths DO overlap, and the more they overlap, the closer we feel to that person - the more we are attracted to eachother.  However, within a range of probably multi-thousands or even millions of possible energy signatures, the chance that any two people will cross frequencies at exactly the same measurement at exactly the same micro-second are worse than infinitesimal!  <br>  It DOES happen spontaneously, once in a while, but I do not believe anyone has the ability to do so at will on an ongoing, controlled, basis.  In order to do that, one would have to be able to consciously and deliberately detect and match, exactly, the frequency of any and every other person they met.  I do not believe that ANYONE has EVER had that anbility.<br>  <br>  Some of us cross signals with others more frequently than others, but I believe it is still a spontaneous, uncontrolled thing when it happens.  My boyfriend and I often think the same thing at the same time, but it is not so much because we are tuning in to eachother's frequencies, as because our frequency ranges are so close that we just naturally "think alike".|`|f2cQrG7jaa	You're thinking that it's very unlikely that anyone will guess what you are thinking.

acHnMNr2aa	The real worst case scenario lies not with any domestic depression we might experience. It has been noted many times that this is a /financial/ tsunami, but that the underlying American economy is still productive. Even if unemployment hits Great Depression levels, which I consider hugely unlikely, we'll be OK eventually. The dollar can't become worthless, simply because ownership of capital assets like land will always be valuable, and at the last resort, they're denominated in dollars. What happened to Iceland is a financial tsunami, but the Icelanders will pull out of it before too long. They're still productive people, and they still have plenty of...fish!...at the very least.<br>  <br>  The worst case scenario, I'd contend, lies in overseas political instability. American free speech and democracy offers outlets for the huge frustrations a serious depression would release. China's, Iran's, Pakistan's, the entire Middle East's especially Egypt's, political structures do not. All of those areas, save China, have a very high proportion of young people as well, and any historian will tell you that the proportion of unemployed young men is the best indicator of likely political disorder. <br>  <br>  Other areas, especially Russia, have histories of lashing outwards whenever there is strife at home. If a consensus develops in China that the Communist Party no longer enjoys the Mandate of Heaven to rule, be very afraid. And in India, another nation full of young men, economic pressure is likely to lead to far greater strife between Muslims and Hindu nationalists, likely exacerbated by more struggle with Pakistan. Now, of course, both sides have nukes. Yay.<br>  <br>  All of this will be greatly exacerbated by environmental catastrophes, primarily the increasing toll pollution is just starting to take on China and drought conditions created worldwide by the triple threat of overpopulation, deforestation/desertification, and global warming. We may see endemic wars over water and huge populations of refugees swamping international borders. <br>  <br>  What I fear is a repeat of what followed the Great Depression, except this time engulfing even more of the world, not just Europe and parts of East Asia. Nuclear weapons may spare us World War Three, but I don't think they could contain epidemic unrest and smaller scale wars engulfing huge swaths of the planet. Much of the world has seen, through TV and the Internet, that it's possible to live far better than they actually do live. They are no longer content to live no better than their grandfathers did. Do you think they will be content to starve?|`|OYNTMiwiaa	With all the things happening right now, the devaluation of the dollar is coming. when you print more and more money, it becomes worth less and less. that is how inflation works, and it will be fueled by the things happening on capital hill right now.|`|P9RauQ7laa	Don't mean to scare you, but we are headed for the worst economic depression the world has ever seen.|`|OHs8yJiOaa	Worst case scenario?<br>  <br>  People utterly lose ability to trust financial systems and those coordinating them at all and the dollar becomes worth little if anything. Economic systems elsewhere in the world start to crumble themselves. Survival largely reverts to a barter system and/or extreme dependency on government for food and medicine results, assuming government is even able to keep functioning. Things deteriorate as crime, disease, starvation/poverty become widespread, and we essentially revert to living in "Mad Max" land. Life becomes a day to day struggle to find food for survival, while electricity, water, etc. shut down. Over time the human race largely extinguishes itself via plague, violence, and lack of ability to coordinate survival resources. People survive in pockets here and there and continue in a basic agrarian society, essentially living as occurred during the Middle Ages.<br>  <br>  And in a really really bad scenario, some country with nukes or WMD's collapses or "cracks" somewhere and they get set off, perhaps elsewhere after being smuggled out. Another one could occur if a country or group of countries decide to "blame" someplace / someone else and decide war is the way to "fix" the world -- that's more what ultimately happened with the Great Depression in World War II.<br>  <br>  But it would probably be more likely that the U.S. in a "worst case" scenario would start selling off land like Hawaii or Alaska while the government itself increasingly shifts to a socialistic system to ensure survival stability of food, transportation, etc. They would nationalize banks to start "steering" the economy first.|`|vKFneEuIaa	Ultimately, if the country continues to produce there should be no problem. The debt can be payed down in future. Every recession panicky and frightened people predict the end of the world as we know it. This is ridiculous. It is like small children hiding under the bed at the sound of thunder. Mostly ignorance and the fear it fuels. The dollar has value because the goods it represents exist. As long as Americans continue to be hardworking and honest people, the dollar will continue to have credibility.

I hope it helps you.|`|61AjTvw7aa	I've a virgin myself and I'm waiting for marriage too<br>  <br>  I don't know the percent of women waiting but don't let the nut jobs on site make you feel like it's stupid to wait.<br>  <br>  They're all bitter and high on birth control with several broken relationships they're currently trying to forget about by sleeping with as many people as possible.|`|Olz3goEaaa	If you want a virgin, I'm sure you can find plenty, but I would guess that in 2009 making a marriage work is going to have very little to do with whether or not some other dude has had a poke at your intended.|`|b0dee10a6de166bc265de45ecc7668e0aa	Only about 3% of couples do not engage in premarital sex.

There is something seriously wrong with a 23 yr old male who thinks sex is disgusting - premarital or otherwise. You should consult a sex therapist. And "Getting old" !? I'm in my eighties and I still have sex.<br>  Maybe you need a testosterone shot ? "Pure virgin girls" are extremely rare - they masturbate, if nothing else. You're really weird !!|`|9679eed4decfc91fdcea2e17ae362313aa	Well, I'm 20 and I'm still a virgin. My fiance is also. We both waited until marriage.

I waited and so did my husband. So did my brother and his wife, and my bro-in-law and his wife, and my sister who is still not married yet. I know some other married young couples who waited too.<br>  <br>  All of us are born-again Christians and I'm sure that has something to do with it. Your chances are not null. You just have to know where to look. You are unlikely to find a virgin at a rave or club. lol<br>  <br>  And you will probably get flamed for daring to think that premarital sex is wrong and wanting a woman who is a virgin like you. Don't sweat it. It doesn't make you a bad guy or a loser. The world could use more people like you; imagine how fewer STDs there'd be floating around out there.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	Bear in mind that 'virgin' doesn't necessarily mean clean, virtuous, kind, etc.  It simply means that she has not experienced vaginal penetration (with a penis, anyway).  There are a lot of people (too many) who think,"Well, I can't have 'regular sex', so I'll just do everything else".  What's worse, a girl that had protected sex with 2 different guys, or a girl that basically takes it up every orifice except her vagina?<br>  <br>  Also, a woman's hymen can break for reasons other than sex, so it's not as if that's the only way to tell if she's a virgin or not.<br>  <br>  Virginity does NOT equal purity.|`|V1MptCMiaa	I'm not sure if I want to wait till marriage or if I'm just waiting until I'm with someone that I won't regret.  I'll probably wait till marriage though.  There are women out there who will wait just like you.  Congrats for having morals and self control.|`|ZncV5gc0aa	I had sex before I got married- but it was with the guy I married. I think it depends on where you are and what crowd you are in.

I always wonder what I would be doing at that very moment if he hadnt passed away... it really makes you wonder.|`|wULV3ZGnaa	Yes I have! <br>  When I was 15 and in 10th grade I became Anorexic. I lost 75lbs in 3 months and got placed in the Hospital for care. I was watched over 24hrs of the day for 2 weeks and no matter what I did I had a nurse behind me. I was forced to eat all my meals even if I couldn't stand the amount of food in my stomach. With me there were 2 other girls going through the same thing I was. <br>   I had always been chubby and I'm 5'11", reaching 124lbs was definitely not healthy. But when you have an eating disorder you don't really consider what you are doing and you are basically blinded by it. After I went into the hospital I told myself I wanted to get out as soon as humanly possible. So I did everything in my power to get the hell out. I was the first one to get out from the 3 of us that were there for Anorexia. <br>   This experience opened my eyes to many things in my life. It wasn't easy to see my family suffering because of me or to see myself dying off. I had my whole life in front of me and I realized what I was doing. It has helped me to definitely take better care of myself and I've become increasingly closer to my family and especially my mother. She is now my best friend, not only my mother. It has also given me a definite different outlook in life.|`|ahko2bOSaa	You can analyze anything in your life to be a life changing experience.  Every day we experience different things, some good and some bad.  For me, I went on a mission for my church and saw how people that didn't have God in their lives -- appeared to be unhappy compared to those who did.  Just my personal observance, but for me, I know that He'll always be in my life!|`|VtkA4KQraa	when I was 15 I participated in a summer camp called Seeds of Peace in Maine and it totally changed my life.

It started by a serious inquiry into why 19 Muslims would commit suicide by crashing planes into buildings. I did not believe it could have been "because they hate our freedoms."<br>  <br>  I soon discovered that over half of the accused hijackers had not died in plane crashes as reported by mainstream press. They had volunteered to be interviewed by the press. Apparently, the list of hijackers provided within days of the attack was a fabrication. This list has never been updated.<br>  <br>  I also looked into the demolition of WTC1, WTC2, and WTC7 from purely a scientific and engineering perspective. I learned that the conclusions of the Bush 9/11 Commission Report was totally wacko.<br>  <br>  After that, I investigated US foreign policy according to Noam Chomsky and false flag operations throughout history. I lost my naive faith in America. Today, I continue my search for the truth.<br>  <br>  The government provides information that is biased toward itself and large corporations.

oTwymgpIaa	Well, you said you dreamed of your step father and have recently met your real father in real life. I think this dream comes from hidden guilt or worry concerning your step father once you made the decision to meet your real father, and the girl represents the way things were before your real father came into the picture. Your subconscious may be telling you that you are hurting or worried about hurting your step father. This is what I interpret it to mean. ;-)|`|WuskPQ6Qaa	It could be a interpretation of a life & death decision you will have to make latter in the future or later in life|`|7oF2o4q5aa	I believe this is a dream about the world you hope to find later in your life when on your own and the coming separation of you and your parent(s).

9okusH1kaa	Because the most vocal feminists are frequently horrendous people. They refuse to accept reasonable arguments and come off as bitter and angry. They focus in on the tiniest aspects of modern culture and make a big deal out of it, such as the use of a word rather than another word, while many people have to deal with real problems. <br>  <br>  Basically, they come across as spoiled rich girls that took fake jobs and complain constantly because not everything in their life is perfectally the way they want it.|`|9VAnsWYUaa	For lack of a better word.|`|5c907c92a6c7447ccb431133ac7208abaa	They don't, but some ppl  do associate feminism with some very old stereotypes from the 1960's and 1970's, but the main ones I see who have such antiquated ideas about feminism, post here in GWS or in MRA web sites and blogs.

7oF2o4q5aa	You may feel that something bad is going to happen or are dealing with a problem or some stress in your life.

The turning away or disappeared part may just mean you have some sort of denial about things you can't face.|`|X8t4VBlCaa	Maybe it means when you see yourself in a difficult situation you always get someone to blame, a scapegoat, so you get away. Many times dreams are just our brain trying to solve problems, nothing else. If you have a misconduct it may bother you even though you got away with it. Try to focus your behavior, analise your reactions and get rid of those actions which you are not proud of. The monster would be yourself  in relation to others. If I am right the dream is a good signal showing that you do not feel comfortable in relating this way with people. Get rid of the monster and the dream will go away. Good luck.|`|3L4citcnaa	There are several ways to interpret this dream. It is possible that you often see yourself as the victim, or in danger, and then others step in to take your place. Perhaps, Freud would say, you are suffering subconscious guilt? An important aspect of the dream that you did not mention was how you felt about all of this. Obviously, you held fear for the monster, but what did you feel when the people died? I think that once you take some time to consider this, you may find the answer you are looking for.|`|oTwymgpIaa	I think it means you worry to much about the conduct or problems of others who place themselves in jeopardy knowing their isn't anything you can do to help or stop them, and this is the reason you always escape but others don't. ;-)|`|87Dne23saa	dreams come from thoughts in your subconsious. i read somewhere in a magazine that colors of things in your dreams are symbols. people are taught that blue is sad, red is angry, yellow= happy...

DsEEATKSaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  Systematic desensitization (i.e., exposure with response prevention) is the most effective, scientifically tested method for treatment of phobias. If necessary, the treatment (exposure portion) can be "virtual" rather than in vivo.<br>  <br>  ~Dr. B.~|`|EMh3cD7Maa	They say facing your fears eventually will desensitize you to them.<br>  I would advise the help of a therapist.|`|n8nGuu70aa	welll whirlpools u can forget about because what r the chances ull have to go into one. and clowns are just normal pple in a stupid costume that do stupid trickss- just face ur fears|`|SmgC9Y83aa	Yes there is ....<br>  <br>  As has already been mentioned ... desensitization is one way to overcome fears/phobias. And if you have lots of fears/phobias ... then there maybe something else that is a root cause of your anxiety. The biggest challenge with desensitization is that people avoid it because they know they are going to have to 'face' their fear.<br>  <br>  However, there are also some other very effective means of dealing with fears, anxiety, and phobias. I am not including in this list the medical approaches either (i.e. anti-anxiety medication).<br>  <br>  1. Psycho or Hypno analysis<br>  2. Neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) derived approaches<br>  3. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)<br>  4. Hynposis<br>  5. Energy derived approaches such as Emotional Field Therapy (EMT)<br>  <br>  At one point I was helping 5 to 10 people a week with phobias with a combination of 2 and 4, 5 and sometimes 1 - with excellent, long-term results. I'm just letting you know this so that it encourages you to go and seek out help from a therapist who works with phobias on a regular basis.<br>  <br>  All the best on your quest!|`|0YQRbq9faa	It sounds like you are generally a fearful and anxious person.

U69Q6rsWaa	There are numerous ways to look at the distinction between them, some of them feature more of a debate than others.<br>  <br>  Quantitative research has typically been the aim of science for quite some time, on the basis of lines of thought in psychology such as "Whatever exists, exists in some amount and can be measured" (1). Quantification establishes trends and norms, and arguably (or so those who quantify would) if research doesn't aim to generalise about the way things are (by inferring trends from samples to populations) it has little value outside of those examined. <br>  <br>  From a functional point of view, qualitative research has often been used by people who believe the above as a starting point for quantitative research. When measuring attitudes for example, often you will ask open ended questions to people (e.g. what comes to mind when you think about ___), so you can get things to later include in closed questions/ratings (___ is true of me). Its very common for exploratory research to use qualitative methods, and there are also methods which blur the line somewhat (content analysis for example).<br>  <br>  Otherwise, there are also philisophical arguments behind the two ideas. Quantification assumes that the things measured exist with this intrinsic structure (e.g. length is intrinsically quantifiable), whereas qualitative research is often identified with a relativist position, and does not. People like Foucalt (who was very influential in discourse analysis) might suggest that quantifying attitudes and beliefs is not useful, that they are not stable within and across people/populations. They suggest that the topic of interest is "in the moment", how do people talk about a given thing at a given time (as such, discourse analysis focuses on ways of talking about things, and the meanings people ascribe to concepts and use language to construct their ideas of the world.). A lot of the big theorists in relation to qualitative ideas in this sense were around in the 50s/60s/70s in social psychology/sociology etc. (e.g. Michel Foucault, John Austin).<br>  <br>  The philisophical side of things isn't that strong in research anymore (after all, people who take a hardcore relativist view tend not to get into the area of research), not to mention the methods and analysis were criticised heavily for their reliability. It can difficult to replicate something such as a discourse analysis (and heavily depends on researcher interpretation), but as noted above, repetition isn't the aim of such methods.<br>  <br>  Contrary to what the two previous posters said, it isn't always a matter of what you look at, or even your source of data; but rather what you want to know about it,  what you think the nature of it is, and how you get your data. You can easily quantify observations, or ratings (which is quantifying, you're ascribing a numerical value to it) of how tasty or pleasant things are, but it may not be what you want to know about people in that case. Similarly, you can use qualitative methods in the case of things that you do think is measurable (e.g. attitudes such as racism or politics, experiences of illnesses).|`|a8c7dd05335ffea47dbc2766a29af9d7aa	Qualitative information is based on observations, and quantitative information comes from numbers that can be recorded.|`|f9ca42c2ce9db1da6f59a3825b706314aa	Quantitative answers are measuable ie something tangable that can be measured ie height, weight or distance.<br>  <br>  Qualitative is a subjective entity which depends on the point of view of the observer ie   how pleasant something is, how tasty it is  . Something that can't be measured but can be rated.

89Yf55oEaa	I live in Maine just five minutes from the Canadian border and I can tell you there are several very large business that are based in Canada that would fall in the category of secondary industries.  Even in the small area of New Brunswick there are large mining and refining industries.  Many minerals are refined in the area.  In addition McCains is a canadian based company that produces many goods for consumption such as french fries, cakes and the like; this company is actually the second largest producer of McDonalds french fries.  Finally in our area there is alot of open forest that Irving, started as an oil and gas company in canada, takes advantage of and produces thousands of board feet of finished flooring and building materials daily.  In my opinion I would say that Canada produces a large amount of secondary industry, much that we Americans consume as well benefiting their economy.|`|AA10023809	secondary meaning manufacturing?

The body/mind obviously are connected and feed off of each other.<br>  <br>  My experience with the issue (and it is a touchy one) is that there is a lot of personal and emotional pain involved with those that get to that level.   It's not that they consciously want to "commit suicide" - it's just that lots of other things in life are out of balance, to the point that food becomes a combination of obsession and compulsion, or it may just be a symptom of boredom/anxiety related illness. Sometimes, people simply "reverse" their anxiety the other way and become anorexic.<br>  <br>  Food is an "ideal drug" for many reasons;<br>  1.   People *have* to eat - so it's automatically acceptable.<br>  2.   You can eat when you're happy or sad.<br>  3.   You can eat when you're alone or with others.<br>  <br>  On a physical level, a horomone called cholecystokinin has been found to be lacking in (some) obese people - it's a hormone that makes people feel "full".  Also mentioned in literature are  neuropeptide Y, peptide YY and leptin.   inbalances of these can lead to over/under eating.<br>  <br>  <br>  Wiki "Eating disorder" for a lot of info on the topic.|`|oI4jdfXaaa	no not at all some people cant help it cheer up you are just fine i love big people|`|eS9nPWqBaa	It is.<br>  <br>  But I try not to be judgmental about it.  <br>  <br>  There are medical issues that a lot of families tend to overlook.<br>  <br>  1.  Depression - which could cause someone to start overeating because they are unhappy with something in their life.  This could be the same situation for someone who is anorexic.<br>  <br>  2.  Thyroid, Ovarian problems.  I personally found myself ballooning and I don't eat a lot and i'm very active.  I searched for 6 yrs trying to fiqure out the problem and finally found an endocrinologist.  It turns out that I have a "PCOS" and my body does not consume carbs instead it turns it into fat.  I have began taking medication and lowering my carb intake.<br>  <br>  3.  Some families just aren't educated enough to deal with these issues.<br>  <br>  4.

5mtDxigSaa	You're internalizing everything that they say, probably taking it to a degree higher than what they meant it to be. Also remember, we psychologically "teach" people how we want to be treated, so if you're not confident or assertive or always passive or putting yourself down, then people will treat you this way. Try not to focus so much on what they say. Remember, you can't control anybody's thoughts and actions except your own. Don't internalize what they say and make you feel bad. Remember what they say is "external" just like everything you say is "external" to them because they can't control you. Once you do this, and realize that what they say isn't really true unless you really believe  it, then you can teach them not to treat you this way. Remember that reality is only what the individual perceives and interprets it to be as the events are taking place. Your reality is completely different from anybody else's.|`|anF78HOxaa	Well usually people try to bring others that they don't like down. Maybe there's something you do that just annoys them, or they're jeolous of you, or they have a misconception about you that makes them dislike you and try to get at you. <br>  Face it though, people are cruel and some people have no kinds of morals. You just have to tough it out sometimes because people can be cruel, and if it's getting to a point where it's affecting you a lot, you should do something about it, I don't want to encourage anything, but sometimes people don't realize what they're doing until they get a taste of it, so maybe a taste of their own medicine will help, or you can just be above it and ignore it. <br>  <br>  I hope that helps =\|`|8uCjC3GYaa	Well one major lesson I learned is that you draw everything to yourself. I changed many things in my life once I realized this. The reason people pick on you is because you demonstrate some quality in your personality that just asks people to pick on. Find out what that is, and do your best to change it. Ie: Simon wasn't respected by his elders because he cursed all the time. One day he quit cursing and gained the respect of his elders again.<br>  <br>  EDIT: This is not to say become who everyone else wants you to be.

People allow others bring them down.  If  happiness depends on how other people behave toward us we will never be happy.

And I think most people have around the same amount of humor, only the sense of humor is different.<br>  Maybe I think something is funny, but you don't understand that it's humor, so you take it seriously or you declare it as nonsense. Then I think, you don't have sense of humor. Then you say something, what you think it's funny, but now I react seriously. <br>  Result: you both think of eachother to have a lack of sense of humor, but in fact you both have it, only it's no the same sense of humor. I've never seen anyone with no sense of humor at all. So, maybe, are you annoyed by people with a different sense of humor?|`|ZA5QTj3Zaa	The trouble comes from the fact that you can not read the emotion behind a typed answer.

And some of the answers were "get a life" and the all famous "that's a stupid question".  Meanwhile I later added details that I did the same thing and it was because I was scamming free water.  I just think, answer the question, or not, without all the insults and attitude.<br>  <br>  Also, sometimes I am on di-stress mood and want to answer questions about what colour my socks are without the party-poopers' negative comments|`|jEZbYZwMaa	Oh yes.

You may think you want a boyfriend but sometimes they cause a lot more sadness then they bring to the table. But if you find the right guy that might help you out.

xsyAljhaaa	As usual a number of the people answering have no idea what they are talking about. There is a big difference between the layman's conception of what a narcissist is, and what the psychological definition is. Some call them malignant narcissists and that they suffer from narcissistic personality disorder, which is a fancy way of saying, " a really f'd up, rotten, piece of garbage. As someone said Freud believed that at birth we all go through a phase of narcissistic behavior, but the NPD person never grows out of it, possibly from lack of attention from the parents.Someone with NPD is stuck at a maturity level of a 6 yr old, and they have the same lame fantasies that are like a 15 yr olds throughout their lives. Someone has no idea of what they are talking about said it was mostly females who suffer from NPD, that is the diametric opposite of the truth. Seventy-five percent of NPD sufferers are male. Personality disorders aren't mental illnesses, they are people who fit a psychological profile of someone with a messed up personality in a specific way. Someone else said that NPD guys can change--also the opposite of the truth. They can't change, almost none of them ever change at all, even though they tend to mellow with age, and usually suffer from depression. It is very rare that anyone with NPD gets better. They won't even admit they have NPD let alone seek help. It is a common misconception that a narcissist loves himself, but malignant narcissism is a form of self-loathing. They tend to self-aggrandizement, see people in black-and-white, are pathological liars, given to slander, think way too highly of themselves without warrant, will lie about their accomplishments. If you know someone you suspect suffers from severe NPD, it would be best to cut them off and never speak to them again. I've had to deal with a few of these disgusting cowards, and it isn't worth your effort. They live in a fantasy world where they are great and special, and try to destroy people's lives to feel good about themselves.<br>  <br>  Edit: DGB, it is of my understanding that NPD eases up later on in life after looks fade, crazy dreams of ultimate power, etc., even to them becomes obvious that their askew reality is a bit off. Also, BPD is quite treatable. It may not be easy, but advances in behavioral therapy in recent years have proven quite successful. BPD responds to drug therapy, while NPD does not.|`|9VAnsWYUaa	Sigmund Freud believed that some narcissism is an essential part of all of us from birth and was the first to use the term in the reference to psychology.<br>  <br>  Andrew Morrison claims that, in adults, a reasonable amount of healthy narcissism allows the individual's perception of his needs to be balanced in relation to others.|`|qPlx1Ejhaa	Boys are raised, mostly by their mother, to be self-reliant, strong, and independent.

aLGe7JZEaa	Onychophagia or nail biting is a common oral compulsive habit in children and adults, affecting around 30% of children between 7 to 10 years and 45% of teenagers.<br>  <br>  Bitten fingertips can become very sensitive to pain, usually at the place the skin meets the edge of the nail. Hangnails are broken skin on the cuticle. When they are improperly removed, they are susceptible to microbial and viral infections producing whitlows. When the nails are infected with saliva the scratching of them makes the skin get red and infect the skin.[1] Finally it may also result in the transportation of bacteria that are buried under the surface of the nail, or pinworms from anus region to mouth.[2][3] Nail biting is also related to dental problems, such as gingival injury.[4]<br>  <br>  Regarding social effects the aesthetic aspect of the nail may affect employability, self-esteem, and interaction with other people.[5]<br>  <br>   Treatment<br>  <br>  Behavioral treatments are based in discouraging the habit and replace it with a more constructive habit. The most common treatment, as it is cheap and widely available, is a special clear nail polish that has to be applied to the nails. It releases a bitter flavor on contact with the mouth which discourages the habit; and has demonstrated its effectiveness.[6] There are also mouthpieces that prevent biting.[7]<br>  <br>  Behavioral therapy is beneficial when simpler measures are not effective. Habit Reversal Training (HRT), seeks to "unlearn" the habit of nail biting and possibly replace it with a more constructive habit and has shown its effectiveness versus placebo both in children and adults.[8][9] In addition to HRT, stimulus control therapy is used to both identify and then eliminate the stimulus that frequently triggers biting urges.<br>  <br>  Finally nail cosmetics can help to ameliorate nail biting social effects.|`|8j7FCEOraa	I bite them when Im watching a suspenseful movie.

It doesn't bother me or the people around me. I dont chew anything else, or have any other habits like taping pencils or twirling hair.<br>  <br>  Add: I dont think there are behavioural treatments for this kind of thing.

It is an oral fixation.<br>  When we are young, we go through stages. One being the oral phase. This is when we use our mouths to feel things. A lot of people get stuck on this phase. It could be from anything, like having a hard time getting off the bottle, getting off the pacifier or a number of other things.<br>  When you get fixated on this phase, you are more likely to have habits such as chewing on pens, smoking, and even biting your nails.

3rINL3lEaa	1) Phobias can be aquired from an idea or story. It has happened to me before, and believe me, all it takes is one small story to get you very scared about something. For example, at school, I overheard a kid talking about people shooting kids at school (school shootings), and I was constantly making sure the people around me did not have guns, or weapons capable of a mass murder. And Virginia Tech didn't help it one bit. I have had many things such as this occur.<br>  <br>  2) I am not completely sure what the names are, but I am positive that it is out there somewhere. Here is a website that has every phobia listed- <a href="http://www.phobialist.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.phobialist.com/</a> <br>  <br>  3) Yes, phobias can be eliminated or cured, however you want to put it. Like I said earlier, I cured my fear of school shootings just by simply not thinking about it, and just enjoying life. All phobias can be cured, it just takes time and tenacity.<br>  <br>  4) You can get Professional help, or you can just simply forget about the phobia altogether.

The novelty of her being the bread winner wears off quickly, and you will become a loser in her eyes before you know it.<br>  <br>  2) When both people in a marriage are so focused on professional lives- the house is really messy and life becomes artificial. Kids become spoiled and lonely. Generally speaking- you'll be at her beck and call.<br>  <br>  3) when you have two captains on a ship- the ship sails in circles. i'm dizzy from this- I say black, she sais white.

When a guy who is a total loser makes fun of his accomplished friend by saying "you do such and such like a girl", it pisses me off because if we want to get technical the guy who is the loser is the one not being a man!|`|YQOT68xFaa	Not really. I don't much care what they say. They aren't talking to me.|`|IwUpusQiaa	in general, i can recognize an insult like that as humorous.<br>  <br>  but personally, i try to refrain from using such terms & terms that make men & masculinity seem like a negative thing as well.|`|V1MptCMiaa	No, because I say those things too to my dad and my brother.  And when my mom gets frustrated and starts yelling, I just remind her that she's acting like a guy.|`|zIqfIIlMaa	Apparently not, cause they are the one that use it more than men do.|`|cWxwHMQWaa	Not me personally, nope.|`|ZYp1AEspaa	Something to think about: "girl" and "woman" are insults. "Be a man" is an exhortation to behave admirably. A "sissy" is not admired; a "tomboy" mostly is. And the worst insult for a man refers to a female's private parts. <br>  <br>  I don't waste time getting offended. I point out the obvious, since you ask.|`|9YlQ5HEhaa	I don't get offended, it's just an expression and to be honest, girls don't throw well or drive as confidently... But I bet some shrieking feminists will find it extremely offensive and kick up a fuss. <br>  <br>  *sighs*<br>  <br>  Have people no real problems? If they had, they wouldn't kick off about something so innocuous.|`|9679eed4decfc91fdcea2e17ae362313aa	People who are aware of social issues do. So yes, I do get offended.<br>  <br>  However, you must realize it is such a common expression most are desensitized to it.<br>  <br>  For example, " omg that is sooo gay."<br>  <br>  That can definitely offend people but most don't mean it in a negative way even though it is.<br>  <br>  Hope that makes sense. :)|`|XKk101Kqaa	Yes, because it has a negative connotation, which originally stemmed from something very sexist.. but most of us don't get too offended, because if we do, "we are crazy feminists" and face even more scrutiny. Although, we do try to over compensate for our perceived shortcomings...it's sucks to be underestimated just because you have a vagina. <br>  <br>  I imagine its the same for reaction for gay individuals, as their orientation has made it to the current vernacular as translating into something "stupid". It's pretty demeaning, although, it's so common that it looses a bit of its luster. <br>  <br>  I really don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing.|`|gHxmYuGmaa	I usually hear it done in jest and amongst peers.. I don't typically get offended by it.  It's a sense of humor thing and relative to the company you are in.  I think that one should just be cognizant that in some cases it could be cast in a pretty derogatory way.|`|fDGPbwdsaa	I've seen several feminist blogs whining about how men are called "women" to insult them... predictably, they ignore that women are called "men" to insult them too.

AA10023809	Natural resources benefit only the few people who extract and export them. Basically you trade natural resources for food, and there is no other economic activity.<br>  <br>  Human capital means you have many skilled workers, who earn a lot of money for themselves, as well as provide more & better goods for the rest of consumers and higher income for investors, which in turn attracts foreign capital and technology, and leads to even more growth.<br>  <br>  If you want an example, Japan has lots of human capital but no natural resources. Middle Eastern states have lots of natural resources. Which one is doing better?<br>  <br>  In fact, most poor countries that discovered natural resources remained poor (UAE is a rare exception); all the countries that grew rapidly in the past 50 years did not have natural resources.
XDcOhAALaa	This is a psychological phenomena. It's something that is very hard to explain by logical means. <br>  <br>  A lot of people tend to be drawn romantically or even just simply attached to people who have done them wrong in the past. <br>  <br>  For instance it's pretty common that a girl that has been physically abused or emptionally abused in some way that they would be drawn to someone who has done the same thing to them.<br>  <br>  A girl who has been abused or hurt by alcoholism in their past may either be completely revolted by alcoholics or romantically drawn to them. <br>  <br>  Your friend saounds like they need to get over this person. I mean is there really anything going for them? explain to her how you feel and watch things unfold.|`|J5zj8dWRaa	I don't know about a "disorder", but it sounds like they are gluttons for punishment.  They are in a destructive cycle that should be broken.|`|OdoLSDlXaa	It's like asking why does someone stay in addiction when it is repeatedly self destructive.  They get back together because grief of a break up feels like crap.  When she says she wants to break up again just call her on it and say, "you know you'll get back with him in a month," or if she gets back with him, say "you know you'll just break up again in a month."  That's all you can do.  They will eventually get tired of the see-saw, but it takes a long time.  <br>  <br>  There is likely some family of origin issues too where they feel fighting and making up is normal.
AA12098193	Throughout Latin America the introduction of multicultural politics in the 1980's has been followed by legal reforms in almost every country so as to recognize specific rights for indigenous people including the right to self government and the right to a legal jurisdiction. This of course, according to the Country. Except for Chile, all have ratified ILO's Convention 169 that grants rights to indigenous people. Some have also reformed their constitution to declare their nation as multicultural or other such form of plural definition of the Nation. Others have already recognized autonomic regions such as Nicaragua, Panama and Colombia, where customary law is applied.
ws3JZbcZaa	Acculturation is the act of understanding a new culture and it's ways, then eventually taking them on as your own.  Indigenous people are the original people who lived somewhere. Indigenous people were/are being accultured to western-european ideas since first contact. The goal was often to convert them to Christianity and the social norms, morals, language, dress, behaviors, etc. that are "normal" for european christian people.<br>   In reverse, imagine you were sent to Brazil, deep in the rain forest to live with a tribe of people whom had never seen others like you. You would learn their language, their religion, their ways of dress, their idea of right and wrong, their concept of beauty, their ways of getting food and or producing items, their homes, family units, etc. When you "turned native" and took on their culture as your own (ie. gave up your culture) you would have become fully accultured.<br>     With the indigenous people in the Americas, (and other places) this was unfortunately often done by force, and the process of acculturation ended with the europeans being the ideal and the natives never being able to be fully acceptable within white culture even when they had given up much of their own cultural practices.|`|U4V6TkZEaa	Ever hear of a thing called a "dictionary"?<br>  <br>  man, are young people lazy these days.|`|vtkuEr5Kaa	When the indigenous members of a specific geographical local become assimilated into modern culture.<br>  <br>  Although, my question to you is, why do you care? Anthropology, at every turn, refutes the existence of Jesus, God, and other equivalently fictional deities.<br>  <br>  Not to be rude, I'm just curious for a theological perspective.
OdoLSDlXaa	I think the backdoor represents a mistake you feel bad about.  It wasn't a big deal at the time but it caused some hurt to someone else and you are regretting it.  You left something undone and someone else had to fix it.  You've done this before, which makes it a little worse.<br>  <br>  Dreammoods says:<br>  To dream that you are bleeding or losing blood, signifies that you are suffering from exhaustion or that you are feeling emotionally drained. It may also denote bitter confrontations between you and your friends. <br>  <br>  Backdoor <br>  To see a backdoor in your dream, suggests that you need to search a little harder to find an answer to your problem. Sometimes the solution may not be obvious.
g4APbW4Naa	Who said that America's problems were caused by consumers buying too much?<br>  <br>  The Treasury Secretary has said that the economic crisis was caused by the correction to the housing market, which was triggered by the sub-prime mortgage disaster.<br>  <br>  A loss of confidence in the value of securitized mortgages resulted in a crisis that prompted an injection of capital into financial markets.  The root cause of the financial crisis was the collapse of the $8 trillion bubble in the US housing market.  The sub-prime mortgages were only part of a far more extensive problem affecting the entire $20 trillion US housing market.  The bubble began to burst in 2007, as the building boom led to so much over-supply that prices could no longer be supported.<br>  <br>  I don't see how outlawing advertising would fix that, or restore confidence in the U.S. financial system.|`|jd14u32qaa	It's not that they were buying TOO MUCH, they were buying more than the could AFFORD.  'Too much' is relative.  What you see as too much, I may see as not enough.  As long as we can afford the stuff we buy, the actual amount doesn't really matter.  Advertising is Pepsi's, or McDonald's, or Ford's way of saying 'Buy OUR stuff, not the other guys'.  It's a necessary part of business.|`|2GNFQPdmaa	point by point:<br>  <br>  1) it should be self-evident that the fewer things that are purchased, the smaller the economy will be. A shrinking economy is a BAD thing<br>  <br>  2) Advertising is a kind of speech. And speech is something we have freedom of, remember? Outlawing it is a no-no.<br>  <br>  3) The advertising agencies employ millions. Why do you think putting these people out of work would be good for the economy?<br>  <br>  4) all a corporation is, is a group of people who are trying to make a living. You talk about Corporation like the word means some kind of malevolent, tentacled alien. If you got rid of a corporation that employed millions, and had millions more customers, you would be increasing the suffering of millions.|`|19f3d453105301c1e4c25cb7c7b96aceaa	Without advertising, there would be no TV shows, no movies, no entertainment. You realize ads pay the salaries of the actors, directors, and producers on your favorite TV shows, miniseries, reality shows, etc.<br>  <br>  Do you realize the huge greedy corporations employ millions of people and their "greed" make up 17% of the economy? I don't mean to insult, but you don't know very much about macroeconomics, do you? I suppose you think government should stop spending entirely and raise taxes too, right?|`|XmFdJLCiaa	honky275, that's nonsense, the crisis happened due to banks lending to people who could not afford to service the mortgage once the 'teaser' rates came to an end (the banks sold these mortgages to other banks, investors, etc, as mortgage backed securities). The adjustment in the housing market came as a result of an increase in housing stock following the huge numbers of foreclosures.

1168bcccfff6f3a578ef3a0223e4cce5aa	rockbottom503 - Louisebro and myself are NOT and never have been an item, married or anything else; please stop making this assertion! <br>  I am happily married with a child and rumours like this can get out of hand. I believe Louise bro IS married like you say, apparantley to another user of the site (type17), although this may well be a civil partnership. I wouldn't like to say either way as it's none of my business who people want to sleep with and doesn't change my perspective on a person in the slightest.<br>  The reason for our little spat the other week was, I suspect misunderstandings on both our parts. To my own fault I attempted to engage her in conversation and debate on her assertions where this was clearly not wanted and, to be honest, took a little to much offence at the manner in which she answers her questions (dripping with disdain and sarcasm 90% of the time). She then made a few requests through the weeks (stop addressing her in questions, later on not to do so in answers we both had addressed and finally to just buzz off) which I did my best to work around and adhere to - these actions seemingly causing only more offence to her. <br>  At the end of the day there's more to life than this forum and I blocked her; I mailed her husbands account after getting a complaint from her (ghosting her husbands account) for trying to 'censor her' by blocking the account. I'm not going to divulge the content as it was a private mail but basically I left the option open that I will unblock and converse if she so desires, it's up to her. I have no hard feelings over the little interchanges and if she prefers to concentrate her efforts on sarcastic answers which fly in the face of feminism rather than engage in debate (which she, quite rightly, points out this forum is not designed for) that's up to her. I've just got to learn to not let it bother me!<br>  So now you know what's gone on please STOP making up these things.|`|3qLIRorjaa	First of all, you're making an assumption that Lesbians are all butch with short hair. <br>  <br>  Maybe those men are making assumptions about you for many reasons, maybe it's just because they've never seen you with a man etc.|`|67204bd052a33365d7bd0f82da0dcc95aa	I'm sorry but the concept of lesbians and men don't belong in the same sentence! Lesbians are lesbians because they love women, not because they can't get a man...and the last thing to cross 'our' mind is I wonder if 'he' thinks I'm attractive? And men are the only people who can critically and objectively judge a woman's attractiveness, eh?<br>  I don't think so...on here they tell you feminists, lesbians are all so unfortunate no decent self respecting man would want us...bloody good job then, as I would not want one stuffed and used as a draught excluder...lesbians find women attractive amd we don't take tips from men! And being a lesbian is not a terrible state of being, or an insult to be hurled about.  We do alright ta very much! And by the way, can the homophobic lesbo bollocks, nasty personality is so much more unattractive than anything physical!<br>  I am loathe to respond to dross like this rockbottom, but I felt I must. Firstly, I'm delighted that my sarcasm irritates, but guess what sexist, woman hating homophobic claptrap pisses me off too, so I feel that makes us equal. Secondly,  as for the poster who writes such lengthy nonsense about me...blocked my ****, husband's account...what cloud are you on? Trust me my feminism, my lesbianism, the fact that I may or may not be joined in Civil Partnership is neither a source of embarrassment or ridicule! And I will remind you that inciting hate on the grounds of sexuality is in the UK, thankfully, a criminal offence.  However, what should be made criminal is the fact that some of you, and you know who you are have persuaded women to bear your children in the first place! And if you are so happily married you will not be remotely bothered about my status. Attrempt to have integrity in your arguments, you are equalists, humanists, or even male supremacists well be so with the knowledge that you don't have to be homophobic shits to prove your often spurious points!<br>  So, I really don't know who you think you have blocked, or emialed but it ceratinly is not me...and I will repeat...no husband, no 'ghost' just a long collection of Q & A and the points I wish to collect...2 at a time..ok?|`|mZVk3fP4aa	Men claim to be able to think logically, but you can tell that's not the case.

Both lesbians and striaght women come in all shapes and sizes, and some are attractive, some not. <br>  <br>  You probably are more attractive than you think. And maybe it is your personality -you may be more assertive than most girls they know or less flirty or something? I say, dont change. You will find men who like you how you are.

Social Work a strong degree, Personnel management good, Grant writing incredibly lucrative.   I use my sociology background every day.  I see it as a sort of shoe horn.  It makes slipping into a difficult situation much easier.

You won't ever forget it, You might not totally get over it but you can learn to live with the knowledge of what happened and to move on with your life.  I know I have I will be 54 in aug and the first time I was 9 when I was molested, I can still see it as clearly as if it had happened an hour ago.  But I've also had a lot of beautiful and great things happen in my life since than. I have had some really great relationships, I have three beautiful daughter's and I have a person whom I love and who loves me.  But that came after I dealt with what had happened in my life and how it made me feel and how it changed who I was.  It wasn't easy, it wasn't quick but with a lot of work, sweat and tears literally, I got better and learned how to function in the rest of my life.

ohUm00RYaa	Basically, slaves worked from dust to dawn.  The people who were called overseerers where white guys on horses with dogs who stopped slaves from running away.  Anyone who knows anything about horses, which was lots of slaves because they made horse shoes, were horse doctors, and basically did all the work, knows that you cannot ride a horse at night, especially of trial.  This is why slaves did not work in the night.  You can see branches, the rider and the horse can get hurt.  A horse can easily break its leg especially in mountanoes or hilly terrain like in Jamaica or Haiti.  So this made it ideal for slaves to run away.  Horses also cannot go through the thick brush.  <br>  <br>  Is also unclear who really controlled Jamaica because when the spaniards first brought slaves they did unchain them and they all ran away at the same time.  So since the 1600s really half of jamaica was controlled by maroons but they were always fighting the colonialist.  This is why spain did not fight back when england took over jamaica because they saw it as more trouble especially with all the pirate raids going on.<br>  <br>  Its not that maroons outlasted slavery the average lifespan on these sugar plamntations was 7 years, so it was runaway or certain death.  This is why maroons took over the island of jamaica in 1765 before america was even a country.  After being double crossed the british broke a treaty with maroons in the 1770 and sent them all to nova scotia.  By the 1800s acompa nanny basically took over jamaica and sent all the white people back to england and refused to sign a peace treaty with the British until a long time after and that was basically the end of slavery in jamaica.  Nanny acompag basically ran away at night and would run down in the night and free all the slaves and kill all the white people and set the horse free so that they could not chase them come day time.<br>  <br>  The slavery the maroons endured was the cruelist slavery in history more cruel than american slavery so that is why they overthrew the whites.<br>  <br>  <br>  Maroons also knew that the key to controling jamaica was population so they would invade the british occupied parts of the islands and take slaves to join their army.

2GNFQPdmaa	The impact is huge: we've advanced to a point in medicine where we can keep people alive longer than ever but we can't necessarily keep them healthy. This means that they're retiring at the same time as their parents did but living sometimes 20 years longer, and usually during this time they have prescriptions, regular doctor's visits, surgeries, tests, nursing care, etc. <br>  <br>  To reduce it to a few logical statements, the aging population creates the following pressures on healthcare:<br>  <br>  1) more people need more care, more often. This means that unless we have more doctors and more medical facilities to cope with this increase, there will be longer waits and worse quality of service. Also, the basic concept of supply and demand suggests that this kind of increase in demand would cause a massive price increase, unless supply were also increased.<br>  <br>  2) retired people will be a higher proportion of the total population. Most retired people are on a fixed income that's not very high. This creates pressure on the health care industry to keep costs down, and if they can't keep costs down there will be pressure on the government to nationalize health care, which would be a radical shift from the current system (and whether you're for or against that shift, one has to admit it is a big deal and would mean many changes)<br>  <br>  So basically, more demand for health care should drive prices higher and higher and make prompt service less and less a reality, meanwhile an aging population will be less and less able to pay those high prices. This is why many see a crisis ahead in healthcare.|`|JQjl5obUaa	75% OF ALL USA's GNP (a preceding marker of the economy before Reagan "watered down" economic reporting to make himself look better; it proceeds the GDP and roughly ~ very roughly ~ correlates) was generated at one point by intelectual property.<br>  <br>  As a fellow can hold a patent at 98 (if you don't elect conserfatives and they don't pay back favors to foreign interests by taking his right to own patents by "de@dbeat daddy" "law"~ presumably because as a conserfative scrooge his children would have been better off...) you could have rested assured a bright future.<br>  <br>  But you (I presume if your not in jail or a mental intitute you are at least a budding "Cons Serfative") did ruin the USA by electing Cons Serfatives...<br>  <br>  So now de@dbeat daddy canot be Einstein, Edison, or Ford.<br>  <br>  Instead we have 35 trillion in government assured trade debt and 10 trillion (soon to be 12.5 trillion I hear) in federal debt, because of nothing more than rhetoric stating that Cons Serfatives are somehow truer to the USA's Constitution by ignoring that it protects free speech, inventors, gun owners (yes the average Liberal cannot legally own a gun ~ thus rhetoric to the contrary Cons Serfatives are not Pro-Gun even if 5.11 trillion dollars in US government imported illicit dope does buy the best propaganda in the known universe.)<br>  <br>  So, treason = knee jerk reactionaries + dope addicts who trade votes for cons serfative dope and prove they have voted thus via electronic camera (the real reason Reagan was elected ~ portable electronic pen cameras that made election fraud a cinch).<br>  <br>  The cost is fear.<br>  <br>  The fear already cost us our nation.

AHJZeo8Oaa	A woman with PMS is not really driven by her hormones, they just make her feel physically terrible.  Just like being tired can make you snappy, jumpy, bad tempered, etc.  Obviously, some women say it does have an emotional effect on them, but from what I have experienced and observed myself, it's mainly that they feel terrible, they might not have slept so well, they know they've got a week of bleeding all over the place approaching and basically, they feel sorry as hell for themselves and not in the mood to put up with anything from anyone.  I can't really comment on the effects of testosterone on men as I don't know how they perceive it.  Ultimately, if a person says they are driven by their hormones to act in a certain manner, that is for a doctor / mental health professional to ascertain, but I don't really think so, in the case of PMS (or that much, in the case of men and testosterone, tbh)  :-)|`|YQOT68xFaa	1.

It would never occur to me, or most of the people I know, to vote for a politician based on gender, skin colour, presence or absence of facial hair etc. but many people do base their choices on these irrelevancies.<br>  <br>  Sometimes, though, when politicians take support for granted, they insult the voters. Look how Segoléne Royal's support (in her campaign against N. Sarkozy year before last) plummeted when she stated that she would win because the women of France would have to vote for her since she is a woman. <br>  <br>  The politician whose values are close to mine and who appears to have a decent chance of a productive time in office is the one who gets my vote.|`|ea49eff6b5328302dbce4a3790181947aa	I'm glad you brought it up. I am worried they are going to put a woman in there, just because well, its interesting. Then people die and the country goes down the tubes. Don't get me wrong-  if she can do the trick then that's great...statistically speaking- if you have 1000 men applying for that role and 10 women also applying- i'm putting my money on one of the thousand 1000 men. When that stat hits 500 and 500, then that means we are doing our job as voters.  Here is the thing- did we ever consider that women DON'T want to be in that role as commonly as men do?
YTasscmKaa	Yes, there are innate qualities that our DNA gives to us. They may make us inclined to be good a music or baseball. But it is our choice what we do with it and how we express it.

By character I mean the strength of mind to choose your ideals and then stick to them come hell or high water. Some of us have character. Most of us have personality instead. Instead of believing in something and shaping ourselves around those beliefs, we look at ourselves and proclaim how great we are, and rationalize behaving according to our whims.<br>  <br>  Character exists. Developing it is a choice and a challenge. You can make yourself into whatever you want, as long as it's in line with your natural talents.<br>  <br>  If you are as "amazing" at music as you say you are, you can choose whether to be the lead cellist in the orchestra or the saxophone player in the subway station, living on tips. Your favorite author can be credited for using his talent to bring joy to people instead of using it to create very clever fraud schemes. Or he could be criticized by someone who thinks his talent would have been better used as an advocate for a political cause. Don't believe that you can't make something with your life.

At best, one person is naturally more aggressive, another more submissive.|`|c6eae266bb501e0a315d4b3e606f9c99aa	Of course we have a say in who we become, but I would suggest that our say is somewhat limited.  The parameters of who we may become are set, primarily by our parents.  Our parents have provided us with our genetic endowment - it is almost a given that you received the capacity for being musical through your genes.  As well, our parents are instrumental in providing our early experiences.  The "free will" of an infant or a toddler is pretty limited.  Babies do not "choose" to be good or bad.  While everyone is born with an individual temperament, it is up to our parents to provide us with the nurturing environment that will allow us to develop normally.  And to expose us to possibilities.  Would your musical abilities be evident if your parents had never exposed you to music?  Perhaps or perhaps not as much.  Who knows?  However, it was definitely your choice to develop your talent and to use it to your liking.  The older we get, the more we are able to move within the parameters of who we become.  But those parameters have begun to be set well before we  have an awareness of the possibilities.|`|wgE9AhIsaa	Yes, we are all naturally unique and I'm not sure why you're saying that people don't get credit for being unique, or especially talented. It happens all the time. Just having the privelege of being a published author is credit enough, or getting a solo during your concert is credit. Don't strive for excellence as a means to get attention or credit;your work will always lack that extra something people can only attain by having a personal passion for it and a drive to be better for themselves.<br>  <br>  Free will, and predetermined destinies are two completely different theories in my opinion. From a religious standpoint, they say that your life is "predetermined" meaning that God or Jesus or Allah is already aware of the desicions and choices and paths you will take in life, not that someone else has decided what life will mean for you. These paths are of your own free will. A more secular belief system such as existentialism would take free will to an extreme. Every person, place, part of your life is there because of the choices you have made. Anyway, we make our own choices and have the power to become any kind of person we want to be, with any talents. Some people have a natural inclination or ability for certain things and some will allow that to define them, but it doesn't always have to be that way. <br>  <br>  Anyway, keep asking questions, keep believing in your own path, whether it's eccentric or not. Curiosity is one of the most important characteristics for an intelligent individual.<br>  <br>  In response to WHY? From a psychological point of view the reason why kid A likes football and kid B likes music is because there was a time when the brain associated those activites with a pleasurable response. For instance, kid A used to throw a football around with his dad when he was little and he had a great time. The brain releases dopamine which causes pleasurable feelings, and makes a memory of this activity. The brain knows pleasure is a good feeling and wants to feel this, or stimulate this response as much as possible. So the brain will know, football is something that releases dopamine so it's good. If you think about the fact that you can always remember the most horrible or most wonderful times of your life more clearly, then it makes sense. Human emotion and personality to an extent is controlled largely by chemical reactions in the brain. Some poeple have said personality is determined by the environment a child is brought up in and also by DNA. If your parents reinforced a behavior, then you are more likely to do it b/c the brain wants to avoid a negative reaction(corporal punishment or time outs) or gain the dopamine effect(candy, praise, special privleges). Anyway I hope this helps... and I am an atheist as well, but you can always turn to religion as a theory and seek truth and virtue from it. Peace!|`|jTh0Vf7saa	If you are talking about our lives being predetermined through fate, I dissagree. But What I think you mean is that if we are born with the capability to do good/bad then surely we should not recieve credit for these qualities we possess. You are correct in assuming this, to some degree, but there are alot of factors to take into account when we are growing up that make us who we are. We arent just born with these capabilities embedded in us. Some people may be naturally good at football, while others may practise until they become good and because they are confident. Others might be terrible at football and refuse to try and get better because they dont have this confidence to because they were bullied about it. Others might be confident but naturally terrible at football! Theres lots of factors that make a person, we arent just born with all these predetermined abilities and qualities programmed into us! Genetics usually play a smaller factor than people think, How people are raised and environmental effects on behavior are all very important!<br>  Hope I have helped

Both sexes have to take responsibility for their own actions and the consequences.|`|e07f8c1e78556e477bf544de03c31b1aaa	No more than I fault men who allow sexual services from women they don't know.|`|qPlx1Ejhaa	It's called marriage.|`|9679eed4decfc91fdcea2e17ae362313aa	If you want a cheaper way to get women just learn where the clit is.|`|P1VXjLPOaa	Not at all my friend. I support every woman's right to debase herself.|`|kePcrUYTaa	they can do what they want, its their life|`|Xy1XH5gVaa	Maybe someone should inform Tommy that women actually fall in love , and SHOCK, HORROR that we enjoy sex as much as you do. We've just come to terms with our sexuality, unfortunately some never will. By the way many of us are the primary wage earners for our family. Oh and its painfully obvious that you're not getting any,( I wonder why?).|`|ea49eff6b5328302dbce4a3790181947aa	being a man- i think it s fun getting serviced. Reality is, if women were against this, they wouldn't do it. So- do you have any idea how old a trade this is? It will never die. Because its in our biology. Men need it- women give it. And both are happy.|`|FUIBscKGaa	We know they're not servicing you now, Tommy, so why pretend you have insight?  <br>  <br>  What's social affluence?  I think somebody needs a dictionary before he tries commenting on grown up topics.|`|9VAnsWYUaa	I don't find fault with women for choices they make with their lives, as long as they hold themselves responsible for the consequences. Same with men.|`|YQOT68xFaa	Yes, I do. They don't have to do that but they choose to. Why reduce yourself to a warm body in order to get ahead? Why not actually earn it by your smarts and abilities instead of just selling yourself?<br>  <br>  It isn't unavoidable. It isn't necessary. And women aren't futile.|`|2RzEaod9aa	Uh, I'm not sure what women you've met that you think all women have a relative economic and social futility so they just do the best to get by, but you certainly can't make it a blanket statement. <br>  <br>  Anyway, another way to look at it is to ask why men would give away hard-earned money and goods for something that a 99 cent bottle of lotion and a hand could do for them. <br>  <br>  We all make our own choices in life. I'm not about to assume all men are pathetic losers who must pay women to service them, or are people with absolutely no scruples or ethics that they will allow a boost in a woman's status (a promotion, for example) simply because she services him. On the same token, don't assume all women are in that kind of position. Some of us actually work for a living (and are into bodybuilding, and served in the Marine Corps).|`|S2vI4VEXaa	You're too cute..<br>  You know perfectly well that the vast majority of single working women don't earn their income or social status by servicing men sexually.<br>  And for those who do, it's none of my business.<br>  I'm hardly in a position to pass judgment, are you?|`|K4zsztkRaa	DUH<br>  <br>  I don't give a flying crap why they do it, it's illegal, and no one is forcing this on them. It's a poor choice made on their part.<br>  <br>  It's is always avoidable unless they had a gun to their head.<br>  <br>  It's never something you HAVE to do. It's a choice plain and simple. Need money? Go do something else, this is never something someone has to do to get by.<br>  <br>  -Connor|`|2e41580c4f9ca26f64c21c7dcc27e33faa	The real question is this:  are the men who are on the receiving end, the men who are being unwittingly used for social gain, are they victims?  They're being sexually abused aren't they?<br>  <br>  Role reversal is so much fun
Kil7sZUSaa	It doesn't cost a cent to be an optimist, sweetie.  It's quite easy to convert negative thoughts to happy ones.  Let's give it a try, okay?  When negative thoughts start to creep in, stop it/block it/kick it.  Keep your mind busy with something else- like watch a comedy (yeah get yourself some DVDs), read a book (spy thrillers would be nice!; stay away from love stories), or do some puzzles (crosswords/sudoku/etc.).  Or start puttering around the kitchen.  Anything to drive those negative vibes away. Here's my personal favorite.  I crank up the music and dance my blues away.  Need a partner for a swing?  Use the doorknob.  Another good release - write down whatever dark thoughts are bugging you.  After awhile, you'd grow tired writing that you'd rather not think of such things anymore coz you don't enjoy writing it down.  LOL  Use these free techniques available at your disposal.  <br>  <br>  And sometimes, happy positive thoughts are only a click away.  Stay here at Y!A...ask and answer.  There's a lot of helpful, friendly folks here.  Cheers.|`|8j7FCEOraa	Whenever a negative thought comes in your head<br>  Tell yourself NO! And force yourself to think something positive<br>  After awhile it will be easy, and then it will come naturally<br>  It takes time and practise, just like all things.|`|9SWklMBBaa	Congratulations.<br>  You wole up from the american dream. You can tell the world's messed up and it's getting to you. That distrust of your boyfriend is merely a side effect. I've been through it to. But my girlfriend respects that I hate anyone and everyone cuz they're humans, and has gotten over it.<br>  If you want to wuss out and go back to your lemming existance of following the sysem, see your doctor about anti-depresants|`|6YbxTlDCaa	well the fact that you are wrestling with it is a positive sign, compared to those who insist there's nothing wrong and intend to continue on the same path. I was in love with one of those for a long time. You say you are happy but you are not or you wouldn't be here telling this story and asking this question.<br>   Start off by tossing out his contradiction cause it makes you sound like a dog chasing it's tail...."I'm so unhappy , but I am really happy"...this is crazy. I am not saying do not be happy; I am saying just stop trying to convince yourself of anything for the moment... <br>  You cannot fix what you cannot identify. Are you sure that you want to label this "NEGATIVITY"? <br>  I think it's more of a CONTROL issue. You are going crazy wanting to control what you cannot and in the process, you are destoying the very thing you hope to keep. Does this remind you  of chasing something you will never reach if you keep going this way? Absolutely! <br>  What has happened in your life to make you afraid ? <br>  You cannot avoid the pain of life unless you stop living it. It is a part of life and love. You cannot control how it goes, all you can do is work on yourself and be the best you can and then and only then will you attract what you want.  With your issues, you are going to be spending your  life working on it. because it is imbedded within you...  if you don't do the work and continue on this path you are now on, you will only wreck yourself and those you want to be the closest to. <br>  You cannot control anything but you. If someone is going to stay with you, it will be because they love who you are. Work on that. Work on letting  go of the fear...fear that you cannot control life. Life is in charge, we are here to experience it and learn from it.|`|AA11562326	That sounds like a normal human tendency to me.<br>  <br>  We worry about finding food, but if that's not a problem, we worry about money.  If money's not a problem, we worry about love.  And if everything is perfect, we worry about losing it.<br>  <br>  I've been in this position where everything was just about perfect.  From experience, I'd say focus on doing as much good in the world (and as many kind things as you can for your boyfriend) while you're there.  You won't be sorry.|`|JQjl5obUaa	No information usually equals something your not saying.<br>  <br>  And something your not saying is what the boyfriend actually is.<br>  <br>  Is he a kind man? Or is he a narcissistic sociopathic drug pusher?<br>  <br>  Cause, the later can tend to make a person happy, but any fool knows not for long.<br>  <br>  And that is that. And you are no fool, I hope.<br>  <br>  Course, I don't know either of you. All I'm saying actually is not for you, but for those majority like you who ask the same half question.<br>  <br>  Cause all too often those people will have drug dealers or wanna be sociopaths as boyfriends.<br>  <br>  Worst case might be he's a pimp, cause personally I think being date rape drugged for your spouces profit and pleasure is not so fun (really ~ I know).<br>  <br>  Or, hey, you might be the pimp for all I know. And a drug pusher on the side... If So, it might be guilt you feel.<br>  <br>  Come on, more info please...|`|5F9IPrMJaa	I always think negative too. I don't know why.<br>  <br>  My best advice to you is that just be the happy person you are now. Don't think about negativity in the future. Think it in the future as your bf is going to be your life partner forever and you guys going to be happy forever. That's a positive think. One day you'll get married and have kids, have a happy family.|`|skxhE5owaa	Try Christianity, surely it's worth a go?|`|0lCCuBxfaa	you might want to go to a doctor to get some anti-depressants. they could really help you if you give it a try|`|eJIo2YJ8aa	sorry but idk google it|`|PYIA2FCFaa	go to your local movie rental store like blockbuser (or call first) and see if they have a movie called The Secret.<br>  <br>  The Secret is all about the negative stuff we think about and teaches you how to turn that around. Its more like a doctors documentray. When I watched it completely made me cry b/c it made me realize that my negative thoughts are the reasoning behind my stressful life. Its about The Law of Attraction and it really does help. I am still practicing it but, ever since then life seems to be so much happier for me.<br>  <br>  i know it sounds so stupid to rent a movie but, I am telling you that you to at least try to watch it. its interesting and real. you will feel so different after you watch it. you will start to look at things so differently. TRUST ME!! please do it and let me know what you thought. my email is listed. keep me posted. it worked for me and my sister. she had me watch it cuz I was constantly in a negative state about everything and anything(and so was she). I went out and got the book too but, the movie is a lot better to understand. Ok good luck and PLEASE let me know how it went!!|`|esj8o2Uqaa	i have the same problem, my boyfriend is perfect but i always have this little thought in the back of my head asaying negative things like hes cheating or hes using me. but i have learned that if you just realize that your negative thoughts aren't true than you can eventually overcome them. its hard to just ignore them but if you try to think how irrelavant they are it really helps.<br>  hope that helps... sorry.<br>  <br>  ** and you don't need anti-depressants that chick is stupid.
3E9plH9Iaa	The most intelligent description of dreams with regard to substance and meaning is based on "Random Selection!"  Meaning,,all dreams in the subconscious,,are an as-semblance of thoughts generated in the conscious,,projected in the subconscious,,and randomly chosen to make the dream..Any and all dreams are of a composition of thoughts or our thinking's while in a conscious state.. It may be a thought you had days, months,,even years ago,,which is being retained in the mind..Its like having thousands and thousands of sheets of paper hanging on wires which the mind picks and chooses bits of each..Dreams can be pleasing and enjoyable,,or disturbing and quite bizarre.. Regardless,,make no mistake about it,,YOU have created your dreams out of your thoughts !! The more we think or dwell on things,,the more chances we will dream about them in time..If we have demons that haunt us,,they will haunt our dreams..Sometimes our deepest,,darkest,,fears,,manifest themselves in our dreams,,because we cloak them so well in our conscious state,,that the only time we can allow ourselves to face them,, is in our dreams..Dreams while interesting,,can never be considered meaningful,,unless we use them to explain something our thoughts are professing.. They also can be larger than life itself,,but one should never give any dream too much credence,,much less credibility !! I do wish you ''pleasant dreams!"  SOLOMON|`|8j7FCEOraa	Not sure, but I defiantly dont think they are meaningless.|`|YupMCYHlaa	Dreams are your subconscious mind trying to make sense out of noise. <br>  <br>  You know how if you tune your TV to a channel that doesn't have a station on it you get 'snow', a random distribution of black and white dots that changes 30 times per second.  If you sit and stare at that noise for a minute or two, you start 'seeing' things in it.  This is your brain trying to fit patterns to random input.  It's how your brain works, looking to make sense out of any input, whether there is sense there or not.<br>  <br>  Dreams do this with random neuron firings in the brain, but it's your subconscious that is doing it so once it 'recognizes' something it fills in all the details--colors, smells, textures, sounds, etc.<br>  <br>  Do dreams -do- have some meaning, like a Ouija board has meaning. What you dream about has to do with what you are thinking about, what your brain is sensitive to, that's what your brain is looking for in this noise, so it's what it's most likely to find.
VelE30y7aa	It means your stressed. Chill out a bit. You might be over worked.|`|PgH12EjGaa	i don't really know but when you have a dream it is what your body is subconusously telling you. Sry i dont no how to spell that. Anyway when you dream, it is usually abut something that is bothering you or maybe it is something you heard in your sleep on tv and your brain picked up the noise and started to think about it and it came out in dream version. it is hard to tell what your derams mean but is anything bothering that might have to do with forgetting something or lying about something. it could also have something to do with your fears. For example if you are afraid of getting trapped somewhere, that might be what the many curtains represent! hope i helped!|`|8mV7lR2Maa	looks like you want to enjoy sex with the next door neighbor in his garden when the sky is clouded but you want to make sure your husband is out of town.
YupMCYHlaa	Sometimes you can just think a problem through.  If you live with it for a while, you think about it a lot, and you turn turn it over and look at it from different directions.  Over a few weeks you can spend a lot of time on a problem, you use up a lot of 'processing time'.<br>  <br>  It helps to talk to someone only because they might see it differently from how you do, they might have ideas that haven't occurred to you.  Plus it's just comforting to share a problem with someone who cares.  But it's not absolutely necessary.<br>  <br>  I would say you should talk to a close friend. That's what friends are for!  A good, understanding friend is better than a counselor because he/she knows you and cares about you.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|4Ey6v8YBaa	Talking is the best way, next to time.  I'd advise you to talk to strangers (community counselors, etc) that you would never need to befriend again.<br>  <br>  As for family and friends: you can tell them what's going on overall, but DO NOT bog them down with the details.  Or you risk losing their friendship.|`|AUcPY9Veaa	you can never solve a problem without telling it to others.you can share it to everyone so that it will lessen your stress.|`|esj8o2Uqaa	you could talk to someone you dontg really know.|`|yj3GT7jOaa	School counselors, clergy, county city community health clinics and family are your best bets.  Counselors and the community health clinics will offer the most professional service and will generally go according to your income.
2GNFQPdmaa	You talk about hoarding wealth like Bill Gates has billions of dollars hidden under his bed.<br>  <br>  Wealthy people's wealth is invested. That means it's in the economy, helping the economy to grow. Taking it away from them because you think you know better is likely to cause more economic harm than good. Capitalism has its ugly side but that ugly side is a result of freedom, and freedom encourages people to be more productive. <br>  <br>  Let me paraphrase from a famous economist: Every single example in the history of the world of a poor society becoming a rich society has used free enterprise as the way to get there. Every. Single. Time. I don't think it's at all unrealistic to say that capitalism is the only reasonable way to raise the common people's standard of living.<br>  <br>  You say that people are losing their houses, and they are. But I want you to think about the life of a modern poor person and a medieval poor person. The lower-middle class in America is healthier, better educated, eats better and lives longer than medieval KINGS did. Do you think Charlemagne could have fresh apples in spring? I can if I have 2 dollars and can get to the store.<br>  <br>  Capitalism did that.|`|AA10023809	Do you think Google founders would build their search engine if knew they cannot get filthy rich? Do you think iPod would be developed if Apple knew they'll have to sell it for $50 instead of $200?<br>  <br>  You are right that human greed is a strong force needs to be limited. But you need an equally strong force to do that, and modern capitalism does find such a force - greed of another human.|`|8LZuzkXgaa	Where to begin....<br>  <br>  Every time I step into a Kinkos Copy Center and get ready to printout dozens of nicely collated and stapled copies of documents that I need, I can't help but thank God for Capitalism.  The same thing goes for my sentiment when walking into a grocery store, a computer store and so on...  I almost forgot about hospitals.<br>  <br>  For some reason we are all forgetting what lame, unproductive and horrible economic systems were defeated because of Capitalism.  Having traveled to Eastern Europe in the late 1970s I assure you it was really ugly.  I could go to different restaurants and be greeted with the same menu.  That was followed by trying to order off of the menu, only to be told that nearly 90% of the items weren't available.  What was really odd was that the women all had on one of four different styles of shoes!  Great central decision making! <br>  <br>  Where are citizens not being cared for or catered to?  Where is there hunger in the developed world?  Who is hording money?  Really grow up and stop living by headlines.  <br>  <br>  You ended your idiotic diatribe by asking that same assinine question that Communists were asking for decades.  Clearly a government, by the government, for the government and of the government will never ever support the freedom and choices that we have enjoyed.  <br>  <br>  Please always know that individuals making decisions for their own benefit, whether those decisions are greedy or those decisions are made by a careful review of one's good conscience is the only way for humans to thrive! Capitalism is therefore the only systems that lets the individual's decision making really matter.
ddH7owHhaa	I'm sorry you were hurt, but you got to remember to judge each person by his/her character. What difference would it had made if he was Indonesian or British or Chinese or anything, as long as he acted the same way.<br>  <br>  Ignore that one person, but it's unfair to think that everyone from the same country as him act like that.|`|8mV7lR2Maa	There is a lot of intra-family lovemaking in Indonesia. Its not unheard of to see a brother marry his sister. This genetic mutation makes them have slanted eyes.You want to avoid indonesians who don't eat pork because the Pig looks like their mothers.|`|SohrsIBoaa	well thats just stupid.|`|e2DEQ6Euaa	Stay away from that guy but please don't judge an entire country based on one prick. I have had a lot of indonesian friends (all guys) and their all decent people. Maybe next time he says that you could kick him in the crotch or something. Then you could smile and tell him you think he'll never be able to get a girl.
QM2UqZmuaa	If you like religion, all the good things that religion has done for the world and how humans need religion.<br>  <br>  If you don't like religion, all the wars it has caused and the things they drive to control people, and how humans will reach peak maturity when we outgrow the need for them. You can start off with "the Judaism lie" and how it led to the birth of the next 2 monotheistic religions.
AA11440210	Yes I do.  I think what goes around, comes around and that like attracts like. So that's why I am trying to be a better person and become not only a money magnet, but also attract exciting and dynamic people into my life.|`|AA10023809	what the guy above me said - it can attract better people into your life, but it will not pay your rent.|`|AUcPY9Veaa	yes.|`|yj3GT7jOaa	IDK the current Law of Attraction.  People have always had certain attractions that satisfy individual characteristics and emotional needs.  I would think you mean birds of a feather flock together.  That part is true.

rGWiOVDIaa	I never thought of it like that. lol, but yes. I love that show. So does my niece and sister. If you think about it, the whole show is sexist.

I believe the ultimate feminist would more likely be along the lines of Susan B. Anthony, or Betty Friedan, or even Kathleen Hanna! But not Mandy. read up on your feminist literature, kid.|`|SDLzdQV5aa	i think so. billy and mandy is one of my favorite cartoons. but i love billy more. haha|`|BC4oDVCHaa	It's hard to define the "ultimate feminist".  I know women who are stay-at-home moms and feminists, and I know women who hate men and are not.  I'd personally say she just has a chip on her shoulder and everyone who gets in her way is equally inadequate in her opinion.
cACf8VZLaa	Yes, I believe I have lived before my present life and most of us living today have as well, though as world population is continually increasing a proportion of those born today will be on their first visit,   <br>  <br>  Historically Past Life  was a central belief of the Pythagoreans and Orphics and passed to the Platonism and traces of it appear in the mixed eschatology of Virgil. <br>  <br>  Mark of Laughlin disagrees with these and dismisses the very idea of past life solely on the grounds that bible, quran and torah "all agree" he suggests that there is no past life. But conveniently he omits to mention that other faiths of much longer standing like Hindus and Buddhists do very strongly believe in it and they can furnish convincing proof that people on earth have lived past lives on earth. Whereas it seems to me Christianity, Islam and the Jewish Faiths do not seem so able to provide any evidence that everybody alive on earth today has not lived a previous life on earth but their contention is after our one and only life on earth we all go to either Heaven or Hell when we die and remain there for evermore. I find this unconvincing. <br>   <br>  From those who do believe in past life there are different theories about which I have an open mind. Hindus believe an individual soul comes into the world and makes its way from a lowly condition to the very highest whereas Buddhists believe in Karma. They view rebirth not so much as trans migration of soul but in that each succeeding mlife must be considered the karmic effect of the previous life and the cause of the following one. This is also believed by various practioners of the occult, and some hypnotists claim they can take youn back to your past life and help you to correct some psychology problem dating back to then. I believe them.|`|RWEyZZXWaa	No, you did not live as someone else before.  It's a one way trip from start to finish.  Dreams seem more real than reality simply because there are no distractions in a dream; you are totally focused on the images as they occur.|`|PYIA2FCFaa	I believe that we all had a past life. in this life we are set out to learn our lessons from the past. then in the next life we will be someone else but still be set out to keep learning from mistakes me have made previously..if that makes sense. it goes on and on except we take on different faces, personality and bodies. kinda like re-carnation.|`|3sbjV043aa	There could be a last life.but deja vu,realistic dreams and other such stuffs are all got to do with the present life.
YWe5fYAhaa	A big problem with Freud's theories is that they are unfalsifiable for the most part, i.e. there is no way to prove them right or wrong. Take, for example, the theories about the unconscious mind (id, ego, superego etc) since no one can see into the unconscious there is no way to conduct an experiment to either see whether the theories about the unconscious are true or untrue.<br>  I think there may be some empirical evidence against some of the stages of development (e.g. oral, anal, phallic stages etc) and perhaps the oedipus complex but off the top of my head I can't think of a reference sorry. x|`|NGrOwP9vaa	None of Freud's theory's can be disproved as i think all of them are hypothetical contrusts, which are thing we believe exist like the mind but we can not scientifically measure them. However there has been quite a lot of research into testing the stages E.g for the oral stage they tested babies who wereweenedd earlier and assesed their personality in comparision to later weened babies.

6qPTQDdZaa	Michelle Wie is getting attention specifically because people thought she was going to break the gender barrier.  Then people found out she couldn't even beat the women golfers, much less the men.  ESPN is a big reason she was jammed down our throats so much.  <br>  <br>  I would almost agree with you except for one thing.  Some men have gotten spots they didn't really deserve due to sponsor's exemptions too.  Mark Rypien (think that's how you spell his name), former quarterback for the Washinton Redskins, got a sponsor's exemption in a tournament outside of Washington once and he didn't belong at all.  Wie is better than that.<br>  <br>  Michelle Wie gets way too much attention.  If anyone should be upset it should be those women golfers who actually win on the LPGA tour.  It's pretty bad when the first thing ESPN leads off on talking about women's golf is Wie missing the cut compared to somebody, say Paula Creamer, actually leading the tournament.  It's definitely skewed.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	"She is taking up the spot of a male that has worked his way through Q-school and EARNED his spot."<br>  <br>  LAME.

I don't know why she was allowed to play in men's tournaments.

As for my personal opinion on the matter, it would be easier to keep certain tournaments all male, all female or mixed to avoid argument, but rather than just watching all men, I want to watch the best level of golf I possibly can, and if that means having a female on a tour that is traditionally all male, makes no difference to me.|`|FUIBscKGaa	Your question is in the wrong category.  I haven't seen a lot of golf fans here.  But I'm sure a whole bunch of your sockpuppets are and will comment accordingly.<br>  <br>  Shallow?  Pot, let me introduce you to kettle.
YQOT68xFaa	Yes, we have. We are told that getting an education and having a career and "fulfilling yourself" and "self actualization" and "self esteem" and...you get the picture, it's all about bloody "self".... are more important than having a family. We tell young people to "have your fun before you have your family", because obviously family means no more fun (note the sarcasm!). Family and especially children take the back seat to career, money, education, and even entertainment, and are viewed by far too many people as an expense, a burden, and a chore. <br>  <br>  And when the kids finally do arrive, they get shuffled off to daycare because mom and dad don't really like actually raising the children they brought into the world. Oh I'm just not cut out for being home, they say. Well if you aren't cut out to be a PARENT, why have KIDS?? Kids need raising, not daycare. If you don't like the daily reality of childrearing then do not have children. Or they say they love their career and don't want to leave it. Again, if your stinking job means that much to you, then get a dog. They don't mind being neglected and it won't create issues that they'll have to deal with later in life. <br>  <br>  To answer your question: yes, I care about this. It sucks for the children more than it does for the parents. But it also sucks for the general population, because we have a huge aging population and not enough up-and-coming young people to run the economy and take care of the old folks at the same time. It is not a good thing at all.<br>  <br>  I wish people would wake up. Work is simply a means to an end, a tool to bring in money so you can enjoy your life with your family. Children are the only real wealth in the world. They are a treasure, a blessing, a joy. They make life worth living!|`|DHyUnhS1aa	Considering we're already quite overpopulated I'd consider that a good thing.|`|DxohE884aa	Go read some books about antisuffragists. That is so not a valid point.  The world is overpopulated! And females were not meant to sit around making babies - we actually have brains. The female suffrage movement was staged over time with so much effort and without firing a shot, just to fight points like these so that women could vote. I'm sure this point came up in other places, but wow it's really old.|`|2RzEaod9aa	Well, as soon as you fix the economy so both people aren't forced to work, you'll see this trend continue.|`|S2vI4VEXaa	The cycle of human life is not in danger of extinction.|`|uXqDYPNVaa	Family and kids are not important to me. Someone else can have them. I won't be scared or shamed into it.|`|un0C52G8aa	The reason people are having fewer children is because they don't need large families anymore. We are no longer an agricultural society so there is no need for more children to help out on the farm. Not only that but there is no need to have extra children as a way to ensure that at least one of them survives to adulthood because it used to be common for parents to lose children to now largely eradicated childhood illnesses. <br>  <br>  Why should it be left up to only women to "smell the coffee" and realize that family life is important? What about the men involved? Shouldn't they also wake up and smell the coffee and realize that family life is important? It starts to sound like that it's only women who should give up all their career aspirations and outside interests and raise the children all by themselves while the men can pop in and out of their lives as long as they provide an income and occasionally spend time with the children.<br>  <br>  The reason immigrants are being brought in is not because there is a shortage of children. It's due to a desire by greedy corporations to drive down wages and undercut regulations by bringing in cheap foreign workers who are ignorant of local laws, don't know the language, and are unfamiliar with the customs. The immigrants come because they are desperate for work and are more willing to work under horrendous conditions and for a lot less money than American workers. Many of them are unable to find work where they live and they have families to support. That's why they come.|`|oaOZ2wlRaa	Bahahaha.<br>  So women should give up their careers and start having more babies? How about both men AND women take equal responsibility for children.<br>  <br>  The world population is always increasing, so I don't see your problem anyways. Unless of course you just want to get women back in the kitchen. <br>  <br>  So my question is, why don't YOU wake up and smell the coffee because the days of misogyny and having more kids than you can care for are over.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	Maybe more people are realizing that kids are not for them, rather than farting out kids that they really don't want and will later regret and/or abuse.  <br>  <br>  It's not about 'time to make babies' (they're humans, not pies!).  It's about people making better decisions for themselves.  Children are a blessing, not an obligation.|`|b0dee10a6de166bc265de45ecc7668e0aa	We are doing just fine in the population department.  Men whine women won't have babies; then you whine because they do and you have to support them.   Shakes head.......<br>  <br>  EDIT The idea that women should not work if they choose to have children is asinine.  I really resent the attitude that we can't have a family if we don't do it 'your way'.   Our children turn out fine.|`|rGWiOVDIaa	Here's why I'm not a mom<br>  <br>  1) Not married.

Giving every person 1/4 acre in Australia would only work if we could redistribute rainfall.

The trouble with THAT plan is that many of them age themselves right out of the marriage market. Their looks are going, going, gone; The men their age want a girl at least a decade younger; the single men over 30 will remember the runaround they got from these women when they were younger.<br>  <br>  What do YOU want: a career minded woman of 35, or some hot young thing right out of high school?<br>  <br>  By the way, birthrates in the Third World are NOT declining.

AA10510845	No, it is not normal for grandparents to be that possessive just because you lived in their home during a rough period in your life, and they contributed child care help and financial help.  Now it's time for them to let you resume the responsibility of raising your daughter. I think your proposition to them to have unlimited visitation and an occasional weekend with their granddaughter is more than generous, and they should be satisfied with that arrangement.  You're her mother, and what you want for your daughter is more important than trying to please your parents.  They probably mean well, but what they're demanding is rather selfish.  I would definitely agree that they should be in your daughter's life, but not to the extent that it robs you of the responsibility and the joys of raising her.  They are being unreasonable in expecting you to jump just because they snap their fingers.  I'm a grandparent myself, and I love my grandkids more than words can say.  But I would never interfere with my daughter and son-in-law's jurisdiction over them, or demand a certain set time to be with them.  I raised my kids, and now it's their turn, and they have done an amazing job.  Don't let your parents intimidate you.  Stand up for what you believe is right.  It's your child, and not theirs.  And I would also let them know that they must not show favoritism to your daughter, and remind them that you have another child who needs the love of his grandparents, regardless of who his father is.  That's immaterial and irrelevant.  Let your parents be in your kids' lives, but that doesn't mean to let them dictate to you, or take over your job.  You are first and foremost the person to raise them according to your standards and values.  Good luck and God bless!|`|AA11065140	Hm...normal?  Maybe.  Helpful?  Definitely not.<br>  <br>  YOU get to define what's normal for your family, and IMO, a half brother is just as much a brother as any other kind.  You are absolutely right to tell your parents that they can't have her 1/4 of the time...that really is too much.  And yes, it could be harmful to your daughter...she needs to know without question that her home is her safe place to land, but if home changes all the time, it might be confusing.<br>  <br>  Your parents currently don't have ANY legal rights to ask for visitation.  If they really want to push it, they could press for Grandparents' Rights, but unless they can prove to the courts that your home is unstable, they're not likely to get anything other than what you're offering.<br>  <br>  Perhaps it might help to set up a schedule in advance.  Look at your calendars, and find a time twice a year that she could visit for a week at a time.  Find another weekend or two in between, and ask your parents to plan for visits to your home a few times a year.  Maybe if your parents know that her visits aren't being ignored or put on the back burner, they'll be satisfied - and they'll always have something to look forward to.  It might also help you with your planning, since you'll be able to get some one-on-one time with your son.|`|7bhtbwQyaa	NO ABSOLUTELY NOT JESS!!!! me and you go back n forth with our problems and you have given me great advice in the past, in this situation i would say they can have her 2  or 3 days every 2 months. i think that letting her go there and they can compromise by coming up there every other month to see her, and why is it that they are only wanting to see 1 of the children, why not your son?  i understand they were closer with the girl cause she lived there but i think favoritism is not right. i would, like i said let her go there 2 or 3 days every other month and they can come see her the month she doesn't go there.|`|wgE9AhIsaa	First of all, I guess the question you should be asking is this normal behavior for people? Regardless of whether or not they are the child's grandparents they were there for you and her when she was a baby, and when you needed support. Of course they might feel some sort of attatchment or feel protective because she doesn't have a traditional biological father, brother link, or they miss having children around. I'll ask that you keep these factors in mind. However, I find it inappropriate that they would ask to have you daughter over for an entire week, once a month. If they wanted her to spend the night or a weekend every now and then I think that would be acceptable and quite normal, but she is your daughter and it is important that she spend time with her immediate family. As long as your new husband is loving and understanding of your daughters situation, and theres not an emphasis placed on the fact that her brother is only a half brother(a brothers a brother whether he's half or whole) then it seems to me that you're all in a healthy environment. Spending time with grandparents is normal, important, and fun but scheduling a week long stay with them each month is a little out of the question and could prove to be very confusing for your daughter, especially bc she already goes to her fathers a couple weekends a month. She should have a sense of home. I hope you can talk this over with them calmly, compromise and let them know they can visit whenever and that your daughter will still spend time with them at their home as well(if you will allow that). I agree with you, don't find your actions to be selfish, and wish you the best of luck.

JRBUCImNaa	No one really knows, they can't narrow it down really there 2 theory, <br>  ONE- some have relation to Melanesia, and two they are the Southeast Asian- both are correct but not in the way most think, Polynesia consists of thousands of islands, some islands such as Fijians  appear more African, and then there are the Micronesians and islands Samoa who are more Asiatic origin. Polynesia means many islands- each island has it's own range. the first Asiatics are found in Southeast Asia- Polynesians are the Southeeast Asians- it can't be pinpointed because no one knows at what point the adaptation turned into the Asian- 90-70,000 years ago the first Homo-sapiens out of Africa that then spread across the world.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  some scholars attempt to point it in China, but they aren't lieing either- because Southeast Asia sometimes includes South China depending the era of the political line. 50000 years ago there was no political line drawn on a map. so if you see a headline saying Polynesians are from China, they are not lieing, just not going into detail, since it is just an article. lets just they're very very very old

If you understand what someone's incentives are, you can understand what they will do.<br>  <br>  To answer this question as an essay, here are some subjects to explore: What are incentives? How well do people understand their own incentives? In what ways can people's incentives be changed or controlled?<br>  <br>  A supporter of free enterprise wants a system where as many people as possible can understand and respond to their own self interest, as defined by their incentives. Since you are writing this question from the perspective of a supporter, think about things that worry supporters of free enterprise, like government intervention. Government intervention distorts incentives, sometimes creating negative effects in the economy.

Later in life, exposure to trauma can be damaging, but only very severe trauma has the same ramifications as that which occurs in infancy and childhood.|`|JQjl5obUaa	Yeah, they keyed on common complaints for the word damage...<br>  <br>  But a person becomes damaged in several ways.<br>  <br>  Basically you could try looking at this from the undamaged person's perspective and thus gain a greater perspective.<br>  <br>  Undamaged people look to find a means of discriminating against others. <br>  <br>  This provides, for instance, doctors for instance with an exclusive "right" to "medical opinion". <br>  <br>  Why do I note doctors? They damage (officially) more people than anyone. (At one point a prominent psychiatrist noted that 50% of the USA had already been diagnosed as mentally ill). <br>  <br>  And they have government support in this, just as the Bushman Chief would support his witchdoctor. If a doctor calls you insane, for instance, he cannot be sued in the State of Maine where I live. You can grieve, you cannot sue even for obvious medical malpractice.<br>  <br>  Why? Because they are un-damageable (sic). <br>  <br>  Why? Because you (the big you, not you personally) elected Al Qaida stooges to office. They practice "farce law" (some call this "natural law"). or the justice of the Farsi.<br>  <br>  As people practicing discrimination, poking fun of, and hate crime based "justice" they are aware of the value of lying to you and I about it. Some people call lying about injustice ~ and calling that justice ~ "propaganda".<br>  <br>  In the former Yugoslavia they recently (when you get my age anything in the last ten years or so is recent) tried and convicted their "fearless leader" for hate crimes, not much different than we commit in the name of "psychiatry" here in the USA.<br>  <br>  Yes, damaged people can be legally executed here in the USA, by these infallible self proclaiming doctors and their pundits in the MOB and in government. How? Well it's easy as falling off a rock of cocaine dear. <br>  <br>  They take profits from cocaine sales and opium sales (as they are the leading importers ~ I was shot wearing a State o' Maine Depute's Badge trying to stop our government from supporting drug importation, then run over and shot again after being hired to a couple of police department's respectively, then shot again as a guard at the white house itself).<br>  <br>  Good for them I can almost hear the druggies screem.<br>  <br>  It's OK, druggies are sick I get that allot.<br>  <br>  But do you know Reagan was sicker? He was importing dope in a Soviet Nuclear Sub with a leaky reactor in the bilge. Not a kind man though very greedy.<br>  <br>  So you druggies that clap every time you hear the story of how my brother took 20 + rounds and I took 13 and how a little girl saved me, well, just remember, doctors diagnose AIDS.<br>  <br>  And AIDS and low level radiation sickness have identical profiles.<br>  <br>  And doctors are "untouchable" and "unsueable" and say we are as a nation 1/2 nuts.<br>  <br>  So, we become damaged in this world mostly by electing fast talking goombas who hate us but won't admit it. Instead they sing our collective praises whilst stabbing in the back and twisting the knife.|`|OdoLSDlXaa	damage comes from trauma.|`|Y8CH3nVBaa	FROM A PERSONAL ASPECT, A PERSON BECOMES DAMAGED AFTER YEARS OF ABUSE EITHER PHYSICALLY, MENTALLY OR EMOTIONALLY.A LOT OF US JUST HAVE A WAY OF PUSHING THIS BACK SO FAR IN OR MINDS THAT WE DON'T ACTUALLY THINK ABOUT IT.BUT ITS STILL THERE AND EVENTUALLY WE WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH BEING"DAMAGED"!|`|5mtDxigSaa	usually from a really bad incident that they can't get over or some psychological gene problem they inherited, or perhaps brain damage.

Tell her your true intentions for doing so then, and tell her that you hope that she can forgive you for it. An apology should be given so you can feel better about yourself and show that you have learned better and see where you've gone wrong; that you've improved and are above that now. Show her that you wish for her forgiveness the most, and that's all, there's nothing else to it. <br>  <br>  Be honest and it should take you far, because no matter what happens, you'll know that you did what you had to do and what was right

These are the two best examples because they apply to everyone (as long as you live long enough), and they are paid for by everyone (as long as you have any legal income). Medicaid would be another possibility, because we all pay for it, and in theory any of us could use it if we became poor.<br>  <br>  So that would be income for the elderly, health care for the elderly, and health care for the poor that have been socialized.|`|rLP9wjPtaa	first class postage<br>  military and police security<br>  road and highway operation <br>  airport security and air traffic control<br>  Primary education|`|jWljrvOaaa	Will you rather loose your job and house to live under the bridge while you boss has taken all the money as CEO of your company?<br>  Are human beings not suppose to be social animals?<br>  Or do you really support jungle rules of cannibalism survival of the greedy?<br>  There is nothing wrong with a little bit of socialism especially when extreme capitalists have hoarded the wealth and money of the country.<br>  I think it is time for maximum wage/wealth.<br>  Human being needs only so much to live this life.<br>  A business lady left $3 billion in her will for a DOG.<br>  That is in USA where others are crying woes about social security for fellow human beings.<br>  In my opinion, most of the rich Americans are extreme capitalist monsters insatiable appetite for wealth and money.<br>  Albert Einstein, Issac Newton, Pavlov, Archimedes and all the early inventors did that for the good of their communities/countries and not for money.<br>  The world will still do fine without this extreme greed.<br>  And USSR did better those days compared to TODAY's individual countries of that block that jumped into the band wagon of capitalist boat.<br>  Shame on mankind that a man has billions in a country where people have no jobs or house or even daily food..

Do you think it is too simple and not worth your time?  <br>  <br>  If you can figure out WHY you don't do your work then you can talk to your parents or counselor or teacher about how to make changes.  For example, if your homework is too boring, maybe you need to be moved up a grade or put into a GATE class.<br>  <br>  If you don't understand your work, maybe there is an after school tutor program at your school or another nearby school that you can go to a few times a week.<br>  <br>  If you think you're just an average teenager who doesn't like school, that's okay too, but you have to finish high school.

IF they speak correct English, if they don't have to resort to slang or incorrect English to get their point across they are articulate.  That's the simplest way of finding out.  As for someone's intellect that's a different story.  You can't tell that just by talking to them, I have a daughter and a sister both of whom were and are(my sister died) articulate and were able to get their point across very clearly and with a good vocabulary. They were both developmentally delayed, but since they'd been taught correct English and were talked to using a extensive vocabulary as children they learned to speak that way.  But the way that you speak isn't the only measure of intelligence. For two people who were developmentally delayed they were close to normal IQ but they weren't quite there. So speaking isn't every thing, you can be articulate and speak well and have below average intelligence. That's why IQ tests are considered very subjective.  The best measure of intelligence is how someone reacts to life and the situations around them.|`|t27SvIPbaa	One who challenges your conditioning and ideas.

e2DEQ6Euaa	As convincing as that theory sounds, the giant flaw in it is the part where the will to live is irrational. Yes, we have war, depressions, rape, theft, murder and other crap, but don't we also have love, family, friends, games and other things that bring joy into our lives? Everyone has their own reason to live and that is why we go on living. It is up to every individual to find the things that bring them joy in life. For example, some people may like the rush of extreme sports, others may like spending time with their loved ones. Teachers like me endure the crap our pupils give us because we love to see them succeed in the end.<br>  <br>  With the good comes the bad. Hence, we suck up the crap so that we can get the good stuff too. People who commit suicide are the ones who have lost or forgot their reason for living or have deemed the good stuff isn't worth going through the crap for. I find such people very simple minded.

I mean, if you want to reject the sociobiology, then you are rejecting the very thing that makes most of us keep trudging along. <br>  As for philosophy, I would say that hope keeps most of us going. Hope is neither rational nor is it controlled by "the times" or sociobiology. It is not selfish. We live in the hope that things will get better. We hope that as we drag ourselves through our daily hell the good will outweigh the bad. We hope that each day smiles will outnumber tears. Regardless of our circumstances, hope lives within almost every one of us.<br>  Philosophically, hope would be the only reason I can think of to stop oneself from ending one's existence here.

DaokQBKhaa	If what you say is true then it certainly is a gift. How did you feel when you saw the events you dreamt taking place in the real world? Scared, intrigued, amazed? If you were not scared then you have nothing to worry about. if you were a bit scared however then all you need to control is that fear - not your dreams. <br>  <br>  It's probably best that you let the dreams come to you - don't try to force them on or manipulate them. This could cause your gift to disappear, especially since you're still coming to terms with everything.<br>  <br>  These abilities do exist, quite prolifically around the world so you shouldn't feel alone either. It's just that its hard for people to understand or believe you when they haven't experienced the "paranormal" themselves.

There are good people out there, and when you meet a special one who really cares about you and shows you what a normal decent relationship should be like you start to heal :)|`|3rq39Pgmaa	Absolutely, but it does take time. Don't expect an over night fix. I was in an extremely abusive relationship in every sense, mentally, physically, sexually. Yes even romantic relationships can be sexually abusive. I was in the relationship for 5 years, he was extremely controlling so I had learned that that was the way I was supposed to live. It's like I had forgotten that life was supposed to be happy. I never spoke to anyone about the situation and I always made people think that I was in the perfect relationship, I let myself get to a point where I didn't know anything different then the life I lived. For a long time after the relationship ended I struggled with various issues, mainly trust, but the baggage does go away. The memories may not go, (which is good because they remind you not allow anyone to treat you that way) but they get easier to cope with. The most important thing that you recognize that you're worth so much more, don't settle for less. The hardest thing for me to do was stop believing the lies (I'm worthless, ugly, boring, etc.) The reason it was so hard to quit believing was because I didn't realize that I was "believing" that, I was so used to hearing it that it was just the way I acted. I was shocked when people told me they loved my personality etc. So ignore the lies, everything abusive said and start looking at all the positive attributes you possess. Change the way you think about yourself, rebuild your self-esteem, there is nothing more attractive then confidence. Eventually, talking about the situation or writing, helps to bring some "catharsis" (emotional release) but more than anything- find the things that make you happy and do them. Enjoy the fact that your out of the abusive relationship. That alone is a reason to smile, and eventually you'll realize, that the peice of **** you were with isn't worth carrying baggage over, and you'll have not problem letting it go. Oh yeah, and forgive him/her... hard thing but holding a grudge will only eat you from the inside, they're not worth it.

This one I believe is stress. Death in a dream is a good omen. But nobody died. No sexual pleasure. Premonitions in dreams are never directly related.

cAMleGWlaa	Standards are just people's "perfect idea of something". We tell ourselves that we will never go below them, but in reality we are forced to compromise in order to be happy. <br>  Example:<br>  It's better to be somewhat happy by taking the 2nd best thing than to be disappointed because you waited to get the #1 best thing but it never came and you weren't willing to compromise. <br>  <br>  People don't realize it but we tend to compromise a lot in our everyday lives. I do this too. But this is not necessarily a bad thing- it is a way to get by. And to answer your question: love CAN sometimes be the result of settling for something less than you would ideally like because of fear of being lonely. it depends on the circumstances... Like the example above, it's better to be happy with the next best thing than to not get the best thing and be sad. When in doubt, compromise.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|4da135398a7b35e6755650407e9396adaa	Well maybe bacause there is no perfect person out there or because the good qualities outweigh the bad.|`|AA11332561	I have found a great man and married him.

Human in general make up expectations that are too high or too particular to achieve. its all about finding compromise. taking the middle path. it doesnt have to be either or its just finding a happy medium. we can't always get wat we want but can find our prince charming in the most unlikely places. figuring out what you want to do with is all up to :)

AA10510845	Since hynotism is basically power of suggestion, no one can be unwillingly hypnotized.  It just doesn't work that way.  If you feel relaxed and comfortable around her, it's because there's something about her that makes you feel calm, and that's a positive sign that it's a good friendship.  There's no need to "stop this", because your friend is not doing anything wrong.  It takes a lot of practice to be a hypnotist, and not everyone is capable of doing it.  And I would see no reason, even if she was an expert, why she would want to hypnotize you.  It just doesn't make any sense to me.|`|9EVcTnUWaa	A person can not be hypnotized against their will, because it's will that allows you to be hypnotized in the first place.  You have to want to be hypnotized in order for it to be effective. Why can't you be feeling good around this person because she's a good person and knows how to make others feel comfortable around her?? A lot of people know how to make others feel comfortable around them and to make others feel cared for.  That's one of the things that makes people popular, the ability to make others feel comfortable and to enable others to have someone to talk to.|`|15Uz3lO2aa	If she's creeping you out, don't hang out with her lol.
AA12044809	Ok. I'll see if I can answer each one of these.<br>  <br>  1) You've been watching too much tv<br>  2) You've been watching too much tv<br>  3) You've been watching too much tv<br>  4) You've been watching too much tv<br>  5) You've been watching too much tv<br>  6) You've been watching too much tv|`|IFQFt25naa	Here are a couple of web pages that might be helpful.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dreammoods.com/dreamdictionary/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dreammoods.com/dreamdictionar...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.thecuriousdreamer.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thecuriousdreamer.com/</a><br>  <br>  while i do believe that some dreams have meaning, for me i find the actions/what is happening in the dream play just as important if not more important of a role than what things, people or objects were in the dream.  (everything ties together).   <br>  <br>  Now I will also be quick to say not all dreams have meaning.  and some can be very enlightening.  The "trick" is to understand which is which.<br>  <br>  May Our Creator watch over you and your family,|`|Rpa1hXXDaa	It is very simple, you are scared of the things about to come.<br>  Better dreams next time.

8yE2sYGeaa	You want to take the relationship to the next level, but you are uncertain what will happen when you do and you are concerned it may damage what you already have
AA12196812	It is hard to say from what you're describing. The answer will also depend on your culture. Were you right to challenge your wife's father? <br>  <br>  Regardless, offer an apology.<br>  <br>  It is best to keep family peace.|`|7oF2o4q5aa	You stepped into a situation that you did not witness.  Bad idea.  If your FIL is elderly, I would let it go.  I would not appreciate his smirk either but you don't actually know what the smirk was for as you are not him.  Better to take the high road and try to disregard the situation.  If you feel that you should apologize, do so.  If not, let it go and see what happens.  Confrontation just begets confrontation.  Give it some time.|`|BeLcoS6Aaa	you were not wrong at all. Most fathers, have this mentality that they can do and say whatever they want to their grown daughters, and sometimes boss the new husband around. so your father in law just needs a large shoe stuck in his ***|`|bp6IeRg3aa	Because your wife walked away that shows she has a lot of respect for her father and because you stood up for her that proves how much you care for her but if you had done it rudely you would have overstepped your bounds but I find nothing wrong with saying it respectfully and I think that he is the one at falt here because your wife had nothing to do with it except probably work with the guy he was arguing with and her being pregnant does make what he did worse and I just think that you did the right thing but you still need apologize to him and say that you meant no harm when saying that because without the apology there might still be some beef later on.

Kil7sZUSaa	Organizations thrive on systems and procedures.  In the absence of clear-cut guidelines, an organization could disintegrate because of lack of structure.|`|f2cQrG7jaa	It hurts them actually. It is great for establishing a hierarchy, but not for education. Tests don't teach. Grades don't educate. The school system = schizophrenia.|`|RQpasDZaaa	Systematic approaches help provide a baseline which can be referred to and altered for increased learning and development.  The second reason is that the systematic approach allows organizations to quicken the learning process, when dealing with multiple persons, ages, groups..etc
kkHM445Taa	Here I go<br>  s.  I think that this has to do with your subconscious opinion of your relationship status.  You're not in the game (football in dream).  do you think that you are in the dark ? (game at night)  You can be joked about but it would not make you violent.
0IG3lEpaaa	Interesting dream. Several times I dreamed I was dreaming. It's a most unusual thing, but it happens.<br>  <br>  Okay, about dreaming about the baby... did you, or do you know someone who had an abortion? Forgive me for asking this, but it's the first thing that popped into  my head. You don't have to answer that.<br>  <br>  Do you have a friend who is having a baby or had a baby? Do you feel somewhat jealous of that fact?<br>  <br>  Are you a bit older and feel that your biological clock is ticking?<br>  <br>  Oh, I just got it! Do you yearn for a baby and feel that it will never happen to you and that it can only be a dream??????
