20090222100811AASeXUw	Food & Drink;Vegetarian & Vegan	Does anyone else feel queasy when they smell flesh foods?	I'm a vegan and I'm not posting this question to be a troll. I just want to know if this is a common occurrence. I gave up meat, dairy products and eggs exactly a year ago, and it just seems that the more the days go by, the more I am repulsed by the scent that emanates in restaurants, at my very own house, etc...       When my mother prepares omelets for the family in the morning, I literally feel like puking, so I eat in another room. Also, they just ordered chicken right now and my stomach hurts from inhaling it... the stench is just so strong, I can smell it from the basement! And also, when I eat in the cafeteria at school, I can't STAND being next to someone who eats a salami sandwich, it literally upsets my stomach... also yogurt is something I can't handle too well.      Anyone else like this? WHY is this happening? Why?
