20080929170516AA7H1db	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	How come everyone has an iPod?	There are so many Mp3 players that are much better than the iPod in pretty much every category. Here are some quotes I've heard.      "All around a much better digital music player than any of Apple's iPods"-PC world on the Creative Zen X-Fi      "Sound Quality is only average"-Cnet.com, on Apple's current iPod nano       http://news.ecoustics.com/bbs/messages/1...       You also can't tell me the iPod has better looks. The iPod nano is also much more expensive than the Creative Zen X-Fi, and Creative includes a $50 pair of in-ear noise cancelling headphones. The Creative Zen X-Fi uses "Extreme Fidelity" (X-Fi) that is found on their computer sound cards, that are regarded as the best in the business. The Zen X-Fi has a 2.5" Widescreen, the Nano has a 2.0". The Zen X-Fi also includes an SD card expansion slot which allows you to achieve 48GB of total storage on a flash based player (12GB more than twice that of the Nano). The Zen X-Fi also comes with Wi-Fi which is only found on the iPod Touch which is $100+ for each storage capacity. I can honestly say the iPod nano does not do anything better than the Creative Zen X-Fi.

20090222224959AAheGDh	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	IPhone vs Crackberry?	I'm trying to decide between an iPhone or a Blackberry (Bold or poss. Curve) and I wanted to get some opinions. While they seem to be pretty comparable, overall I think the iPhone would serve me the best. I don't work for a big corporation, so the better email features on the Blackberry wouldn't effect me all that much. I like the bigger screen on the iPhone, and I admit I love how it works with 'gestures' like a swipe of the finger across the screen to scroll, or swiping fingers together or apart to zoom etc.. The iPhone has a better OS (although no cut/copy/paste?!) and there are all those applications!!       My biggest issue is pricing! You are required to carry a data plan ($30) as long as you have the phone. You can never take the data plan off and just use it as a phone. I don't imagine I'd ever do this, since data is such a big part of why I'm getting a smart phone, but I want the option if I ever needed it! I don't like being stuck with anything like that.       The data plans are $30 for both phones, plus $20 for unlimited text for either phone. The Blackberry has a bundle adding another $10 for tethering. From what I understand, you do not have the option  to tether your iPhone to your laptop without jailbreaking it.       I realize jailbreaking it voids the warranty, but is it illegal? I'd like to know more about the pros and cons of jailbreaking  the iPhone.       Also, if I went with the Blackberry bundle with tethering, it caps my data usage at 5GB. AT&T does have a handy chart showing how much data certain online activities use, but I am wondering about streaming Netflix movies by tethering the phone to my laptop. Would the connection be fast enough? How much data would that use up?  Without the tethering option I would have unlimited data using just the phone, so I imagine streaming radio/music would work but I'm really wondering about the movies, which I would need the tethering for (assuming the connection was fast enough). I would love to use my phone to watch movies online when I'm not at home.       Also, if you can tether to your PC/MAC why wouldn't it be a good idea to just replace my home internet service with my phone internet? I don't understand the way it all works; is this idea ridiculous??       Thanks in advance for any help!!!       :) Stacie

20071205131848AAeuggo	Consumer Electronics;TVs	A TV digital é uma "roubada"? E agora?	O Alamar Régis Carvalho disse que:   1. Todo HDTV é tv digital mas nem todo tv digital é HDTV.   2. Nem todo televisor de LCD ou de Plasma, é necessariamente um televisor HDTV .   3. Para podermos receber um programa verdadeiramente de TV em alta resolu??o, é necessário que: a emissora de televis?o da sua cidade esteja transmitindo programa??o em HDTV. Para isto ela precisa comprar um novo transmissor, que n?o é barato, e todos os demais equipamentos em HDTV, como cameras e um novo parque eletr?nico; e o seu televisor deve ser HDTV de fábrica, ou seja, já ter sido fabricado com esta qualidade. Já existem vários, embora poucos, equipamentos assim em algumas lojas.    4. A TV de alta resolu??o, com as suas 1080 linhas, n?o pode ser comparada a uma TV "convencional" ligada a um "set-top-box", por melhor que seja.

I can play anything or use any DVD player or whatever with it and it works perfectly, but when i play my PS3 i get a buzzing noise from my TV. You can't hear the buzz if i turn my volume down really low (too low to really hear anything), and you can hear the buzzing noise really loudly if i raise the volume way too much. And of course on normal volume levels i still get this buzz, which is why it annoys me. I tried using a different yellow/white/red cord (from my PS2 since it's compatible) but it still made that buzz noise.  So how can I get rid of this noise?

20090222175045AA91mPg	Consumer Electronics;Cameras	Is more camera megapixels better for me?	i want to be able to read text and little fine prints just from snapping a picture of a sign or poster from really far away, there was this commercial where a guy gave this girl a beautiful love letter but it got blown away in the wind, so he instantly took out his camera James bond style while the girl just uselessly screamed and fainted. as she woke up he read her the letter but off his camera which i thought was a nifty feature. so was he able to do that as result of more megapixels and if so how much like 12 megapixel camera or 14, or does it come down to lens, optical zoom and all those other factors like brand name,       any and all answers are appreciated

20090223014143AAXiPIo	Consumer Electronics;Cameras	Which SLR should I get?	Hi, I'm an amateur photographer and so far I've been using a Nikon COOLPIX P5100. Here are some examples of the work I’ve done so far:  http://dbhd.deviantart.com/    I’ve used my teacher’s camera on occasion, a Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ8, and I was thinking of getting an SLR.      I’m between a Beginner to Intermediate user and my budget is under $1000 (Singapore).   I do a lot of macro shots so I need the SLR to have inbuilt macro capabilities.   I really liked the super zoom function of the Lumix so a good zoom range would be preferable too =D   I’ve heard a lot about the Live View feature and was wondering if there have been problems with it so far. Also I’ll be bringing this SLR with me on an upcoming trip so I need something that isn’t too bulky and cumbersome.      So I was wondering if anyone has any suggestion for a good SLR for me to start out with…      All help is appreciated!!   Thanks! ^^

20090223020653AAzraHj	Consumer Electronics;Cameras	Suggestions for a good digital camera (compact)?	Hey,    I broke my camera and am looking at which one to get now. I'm a beginner photographer, but doesn't mean I'm not willing to learn. Basically, I've stuck with the Canon SD Powershot series and absolutely loved them. I'm looking for a small camera, that I am able to be creative with.    My style of shooting is spur of the moment, so I need a camera that can keep up and that can take a bit of a beating as well. I like to do nature shots, or portraits. I'm big on different angles, and lighting is important to me. I need something that can have both a soft effect, and a sharp effect.   I would really like to stick to the Canon Powershot series, but out of them I am unsure which one to purchase. I know that I want a good macro range, which is the main reason I am holding off on getting the SD990. I also would like time-lapse movie mode.    So, what would you suggest along those lines? Before I purchase anything I would like to be able to play with it, so go ahead and suggest any thing you think would be suited.    Thanks!

My first electric guitar and (only electric currently) is a Series 10 Stratocaster copy I bought roughly about 95 - 96. I have had a little work done on it, and it still is kicking. However I went to a specialty shop, and I am thinking about getting the works on it. I thought about getting nice humbucker pick ups and the whole deal. However my only concern is, is that just pointless. Should I bite the bullet and buy a new guitar.       This was my first guitar, but Idealy I would like to turn it into a hard rocking beast like how I first felt about it when I was ten, and have some fun playing it. It would cost a lot of money to get it fixed up, I am thinking about replacing the pick guard, to the tuning pegs. anyone else own one of these ole guitars, and get it fixed up?      also whatever happened to "Series 10"?      thank you in advance for your answers :)
